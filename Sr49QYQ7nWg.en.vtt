WEBVTT

00:03.520 --> 00:13.400
He was son of God and He came on this Earth
with a very great message that you are to

00:13.400 --> 00:15.219
be resurrected.

00:15.219 --> 00:26.810
It is not only that you have to maintain yourself,
and you don’t eat this and don’t do that

00:26.810 --> 00:35.739
and all those Ten Commandments, but He came
to give us a message of our rebirth.

00:35.739 --> 00:42.770
We are to be born again; not by any just a
ritual or some sort of a ceremony we go through,

00:42.770 --> 00:52.110
but there has to be something living that
has to take place.

00:52.110 --> 00:55.550
He has always talked about [the] living God.

00:55.550 --> 01:00.680
So something living must happen and what happens
when it is something living?

01:00.680 --> 01:08.039
When it is something living we start finding
the transformation taking place.

01:08.039 --> 01:13.579
For example: you sow a seed and the living
process starts; the tree starts transforming

01:13.579 --> 01:25.200
into the root and a shoot; and then the shoot
start transforming itself into leaves and

01:25.200 --> 01:27.409
then into fruits.

01:27.409 --> 01:36.950
It’s not static: not that we take one piece
from here and keep it there and it is transformed,

01:36.950 --> 01:48.759
but there is something that happens within,
something very spontaneous which brings forth

01:48.759 --> 01:55.249
this transformation and you see it with your
own eyes.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.520
And this transformation has to take place
within you.

01:57.520 --> 02:08.569
Now, in a case as I told you of Cathy or someone
like that one can say all right you must have

02:08.569 --> 02:11.790
consoled or you give her love and this and
that she be consoled, but that’s not the

02:11.790 --> 02:12.790
point.

02:12.790 --> 02:24.000
As I told you there are many people who have
got everything, still they are unhappy.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.100
And if you ask them they will say, “No,
we don’t know.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.190
We are not happy.

02:32.190 --> 02:33.190
We don’t feel happy.

02:33.190 --> 02:34.330
There’s no joy in our lives.

02:34.330 --> 02:35.400
We have lost our heart."

02:35.400 --> 02:37.800
They can’t explain but it is there.

02:37.800 --> 02:42.220
What have they lost?

02:42.220 --> 02:56.380
The time has come for the whole world to know
their Spirit.

02:56.380 --> 03:01.769
This is the time which is prophesised even
by William Blake where he describes England

03:01.769 --> 03:05.110
is the Jerusalem.

03:05.110 --> 03:11.610
The time has come for you to know your Spirit.

03:11.610 --> 03:13.240
That has to happen.

03:13.240 --> 03:20.480
It’s not a thing by which I tell you, you
stand on your heads or hold your nose or start

03:20.480 --> 03:25.720
taking some names, like a one track mind going
on chanting some names like madcaps.

03:25.720 --> 03:35.330
It’s not that, but something that must happen
within yourself and that must transform you.

03:35.330 --> 03:43.850
Of course, one must understand [that] if it
is a living process, you cannot pay for it.

03:43.850 --> 03:48.652
How can you pay for a seed to sprout?

03:48.652 --> 03:53.800
The seed doesn’t understand; the living
process doesn’t understand money.

03:53.800 --> 03:58.970
It’s the dead work of human beings.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.980
How can you organise it also?

04:01.980 --> 04:02.980
You cannot! It’s spontaneous.

04:02.980 --> 04:03.980
There is no technique.

04:03.980 --> 04:04.980
It’s all built-in.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.290
The technique is built: in the little seed
that you see, the whole technique of its growth

04:09.290 --> 04:10.290
is built-in.

04:10.290 --> 04:16.220
The technique is built-in and all its maps,
how it is going to be, what tree it is going

04:16.220 --> 04:25.800
to be, how the tree is going to grow, in what
height, in what thickness, everything is inside

04:25.800 --> 04:29.159
that seed.

04:29.159 --> 04:36.990
In the same way it is a spontaneous thing,
which has to happen within you and if it is

04:36.990 --> 04:39.169
so we have to find out.

04:39.169 --> 04:44.490
That’s how the search started: people went
to India, went all over the places to find

04:44.490 --> 04:45.490
out.

04:45.490 --> 04:46.870
They thought we cannot find the solution here
let us go up there.

04:46.870 --> 04:57.270
It has to be that way, because if you grow
too much outside you have to find out your

04:57.270 --> 04:58.650
roots.

04:58.650 --> 05:06.870
Because you develop that fear that you may
not be able to sustain this outward growth

05:06.870 --> 05:16.030
unless and until you find out the depth or
the source on which this is to be sustained.

05:16.030 --> 05:18.590
So people started searching and searching.

05:18.590 --> 05:27.580
I have met many of them, many thousands, and
I find they were misled many a times.

05:27.580 --> 05:29.689
They were really misled.

05:29.689 --> 05:37.300
They were so anxious to get to it that whatever
somebody said they just accepted blindfolded.

05:37.300 --> 05:41.740
People asked for money, all right take money.

05:41.740 --> 05:50.199
They starved themselves, collected money and
gave this to these swindlers and these cheats

05:50.199 --> 05:52.419
and thugs.

05:52.419 --> 06:00.009
How can anybody exchange money for the Spirit?

06:00.009 --> 06:03.729
It’s absurd! It’s illogical.

06:03.729 --> 06:11.610
But we understand money to such a great extent,
I was amazed, that we think that Spirit can

06:11.610 --> 06:19.419
be bought by giving some money to someone,
or some sort of a material thing.

06:19.419 --> 06:27.850
Logically all these things have to be understood.

06:27.850 --> 06:36.999
Now to say that logically you cannot understand
God, is wrong.

06:36.999 --> 06:39.750
You can, logically; not rationally but logically.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.419
There’s a difference between the two.

06:41.419 --> 06:46.265
For example, if you have not come to London,
you have not seen London, I have not been

06:46.265 --> 06:48.720
to Newbury, I did not know it’s a beautiful
place like this, then I cannot understand

06:48.720 --> 06:49.720
it.

06:49.720 --> 07:00.779
But if I have come here, then I see with my
own eyes, “Yes it is so."

07:00.779 --> 07:06.110
Then I have to say, “Yes I have seen it.

07:06.110 --> 07:07.289
It’s so."

07:07.289 --> 07:12.029
I have seen it, I have felt it.

07:12.029 --> 07:13.900
I know it is so.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.569
Then it becomes, the whole thing becomes logical.

07:16.569 --> 07:20.099
But rationally if I sit in India somewhere
in the corner and think of Newbury, “Now

07:20.099 --> 07:24.400
I am going to Newbury."

07:24.400 --> 07:33.499
Just putting my wings of imagination outside:
will I come to Newbury?

07:33.499 --> 07:43.629
But if I come, this is very important to understand,
if I come here, actually I come here, in person,

07:43.629 --> 07:50.899
then I know the place and I know the people
of Newbury and I know it.

07:50.899 --> 07:56.310
That means it has to be an actualisation.

07:56.310 --> 08:02.869
If it is not an actualisation then whatever
you decide about it, this way or that, way

08:02.869 --> 08:06.400
is absolutely illogical, because you have
not been there; very simple as that.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.680
Some people say, “We believe in God."

08:08.680 --> 08:11.289
Some people say, “We don’t believe in
God."

08:11.289 --> 08:17.219
Both ways, whatever they are saying, they
are doing it I don’t know how.

08:17.219 --> 08:24.180
If they believe in God, maybe it’s innately
built in us to believe in God.

08:24.180 --> 08:32.680
But even they don’t believe in God, it’s
all right, because they don’t understand;

08:32.680 --> 08:35.710
they have not been there.

08:35.710 --> 08:49.410
But you must keep yourself open: open to understand
that if something has to happen to us, which

08:49.410 --> 08:57.030
is a living process, some transformation has
to take place within us.

08:57.030 --> 09:04.380
It has to be an actualisation, not a lecture
to you or a sermon to you, or some sort of

09:04.380 --> 09:08.110
a service and then you disperse.

09:08.110 --> 09:16.820
You must start feeling some transformation
coming within.

09:16.820 --> 09:23.890
In the Bible itself, it is written: “I will
appear before you like tongues of flames."

09:23.890 --> 09:31.680
Nobody can explain what it is like; they cannot.

09:31.680 --> 09:44.330
It is written that: “The Tree of Life will
be fed by the water of life."

09:44.330 --> 09:45.330
It’s a prophecy.

09:45.330 --> 09:47.660
Now what is Tree of Life?

09:47.660 --> 09:49.190
Where is it?

09:49.190 --> 09:53.730
Where does it exist within us?

09:53.730 --> 09:56.240
Nobody has tried to find out.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.780
They say, “You must have faith."

09:58.780 --> 10:00.910
“Yes, whatever is said is true.

10:00.910 --> 10:03.910
You must have faith."

10:03.910 --> 10:11.670
But if you have faith, after some time you
will be disillusioned.

10:11.670 --> 10:14.360
That’s blind, absolutely blind.

10:14.360 --> 10:22.190
Because where is that Tree of Life, you have
not seen, felt or it has not manifested.

10:22.190 --> 10:31.100
For this we can refer to other scriptures
also, specially in India where people have

10:31.100 --> 10:32.490
been more meditative.

10:32.490 --> 10:42.510
As you have been more outward and seeking
[the] overpowering of matter, in India people

10:42.510 --> 10:47.500
tried to find out what’s happening within.

10:47.500 --> 10:52.500
I mean there are genuine people also, not
all are thugs.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.200
They are not in the market.

10:55.200 --> 10:59.340
They are hiding themselves somewhere in Himalayas
and all these places.

10:59.340 --> 11:07.410
But in the sixth century only, we have the
description of The Tree of Life.

11:07.410 --> 11:10.550
And the Tree of Life is shown here as you
see.

11:10.550 --> 11:20.630
Now you are not to have blind faith in what
I am saying, there’s no need.

11:20.630 --> 11:24.620
But you should not also deny me.

11:24.620 --> 11:32.800
You should try to understand what I am saying
and see for yourself [if] it works out or

11:32.800 --> 11:33.800
not.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.420
If it does not work out we give another chance
to you.

11:37.420 --> 11:48.670
Because you must know that I have come here
to give you something, not take anything from

11:48.670 --> 11:49.670
you.

11:49.670 --> 11:52.790
I cannot take, that’s my nature.

11:52.790 --> 11:56.360
That’s how God has made me.

11:56.360 --> 12:01.610
It’s something funny, but I cannot take
anything.

12:01.610 --> 12:10.040
If I have come to give you then there’s
nothing selling, there’s no shop.

12:10.040 --> 12:17.890
Try! If you should be open it would help you
better to understand what I am trying to tell

12:17.890 --> 12:18.890
you.

12:18.890 --> 12:29.940
Here now, you see the Tree of Life (chakra
chart) and when this Tree of Life is given

12:29.940 --> 12:34.380
the water of life then what happens?

12:34.380 --> 12:37.630
How the nourishment reaches?

12:37.630 --> 12:41.110
And how it starts activating?

12:41.110 --> 12:46.700
It is as simple as connecting this machine
to the mains.

12:46.700 --> 12:55.800
Any machine, say a television is there, once
it is connected to the mains you can see the

12:55.800 --> 12:58.440
manifestation of the machine very clearly.

12:58.440 --> 13:04.750
And you are amazed [that] for a villager,
if you show, that he is surprised, and he

13:04.750 --> 13:09.480
cannot understand how this is happening, how
are these pictures coming, from where these

13:09.480 --> 13:13.510
music is coming, how these colours have been
shown.

13:13.510 --> 13:15.700
He can’t understand it.

13:15.700 --> 13:31.350
In the same way, once your machine becomes
connected, connected, with the Divine you

13:31.350 --> 13:37.430
start finding Its manifestation.

13:37.430 --> 13:48.200
Now in this picture we have shown you here
the subtle being that exists within us: just

13:48.200 --> 13:50.890
like a structure of a seed you can say.

13:50.890 --> 13:58.520
As in the seed there is a primule of the germinating
power.

13:58.520 --> 14:14.870
In the same way, in that triangular bone is
the power which is going to give us rebirth.

14:14.870 --> 14:17.660
This is your own.

14:17.660 --> 14:23.680
This is your Mother who is going to give you
your rebirth.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.960
She exists in all of us.

14:27.960 --> 14:32.020
She is dormant, but She knows everything about
you.

14:32.020 --> 14:33.800
She is like a tape recorder.

14:33.800 --> 14:38.730
She knows all your past and She knows your
seeking and She knows you value.

14:38.730 --> 14:45.240
She knows your defects and She knows what
mistakes you have committed, who has troubled

14:45.240 --> 14:49.500
you and who has looted you, and who has deceived
you.

14:49.500 --> 14:50.770
She knows everything.

14:50.770 --> 14:52.470
But She is dormant.

14:52.470 --> 15:00.130
She lies there in a dormant stage and She
is called as ‘Kundalini’ in the Sanskrit

15:00.130 --> 15:01.130
language.

15:01.130 --> 15:07.010
Kundalini is the word [which] comes from the
coiled.

15:07.010 --> 15:10.310
The word ‘Kundalini’ means ‘the coil’.

15:10.310 --> 15:18.040
And She is in three and a half coils, coiled
together, and just like, they call it like

15:18.040 --> 15:20.790
a serpent, She is lying down there.

15:20.790 --> 15:31.910
But you have seen mostly, most of the energies
are kept in a coil, because if any chord has

15:31.910 --> 15:35.430
to be used we put it in a coil always.

15:35.430 --> 15:39.250
The one end has to come out so it is kept
coiled up there.

15:39.250 --> 15:46.940
Why this three and half is also a big mathematics
which, of course later on, you can find out

15:46.940 --> 15:52.390
what is the meaning of this three and half
coils.

15:52.390 --> 16:01.940
Just now, I will just give you a very, very
short description, an outline, about this

16:01.940 --> 16:04.720
power that resides within us.

16:04.720 --> 16:08.710
It resides in the triangular bone called as
sacrum.

16:08.710 --> 16:16.500
That is at the back of us, our backbone, at
the lowest point.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.110
You can see there is a triangular bone behind.

16:19.110 --> 16:21.560
Now see this is called as sacrum.

16:21.560 --> 16:22.670
Sacrum means ‘sacred bone’.

16:22.670 --> 16:31.050
It has been found out that when the human
body burns this bone does not burn.

16:31.050 --> 16:33.750
That is why they call it sacrum long time
back.

16:33.750 --> 16:37.230
But the reason is the Kundalini is inside
that bone.

16:37.230 --> 16:49.330
Now above that, you find there are six centres:
one, two, three, four, five and six.

16:49.330 --> 16:53.890
And the lowest one is below that.

16:53.890 --> 17:03.930
All these centres are subtle centres which
manifest outside our plexuses, the physical

17:03.930 --> 17:06.360
plexuses that we know of.

17:06.360 --> 17:19.750
These centres exist as energy pockets and
they supply the two lines: you see the blue

17:19.750 --> 17:23.600
and the yellow line.

17:23.600 --> 17:34.010
They try to balance and arrange the power
to flow into these two channels.

17:34.010 --> 17:44.390
These two channels represent within us, on
the left hand side, the one which comes as

17:44.390 --> 17:56.850
the blue line which you see comes actually
from the right side on top and comes down

17:56.850 --> 18:00.810
and meets the first centre there.

18:00.810 --> 18:08.140
This is the line of Ida channel which controls
our emotional line.

18:08.140 --> 18:15.330
It controls our past and is also called as
moon line.

18:15.330 --> 18:21.640
It is, it represents our desiring power, our
desiring power.

18:21.640 --> 18:33.410
The another line you see is the yellow line
which represents our power of action, through

18:33.410 --> 18:34.750
which we act.

18:34.750 --> 18:40.560
First we desire, we want to have something
and then we act.

18:40.560 --> 18:50.780
So this line represents your physical and
mental being which goes in the front side

18:50.780 --> 19:04.300
and the left side of the brain and forms the
ego, which is a by-product of our activities

19:04.300 --> 19:06.760
for our actions.

19:06.760 --> 19:16.730
The first power of desire or the emotional
power, when it acts, for example say Cathy

19:16.730 --> 19:23.490
was emotionally disturbed: her this power
was acting too much and was using all the

19:23.490 --> 19:30.720
power from all the body and was creating a
superego there.

19:30.720 --> 19:41.430
So actually on the left hand side and in the
front is the ego and on the right hand side

19:41.430 --> 19:50.760
and the back is the superego, covering our
limbic area which is in the brain above this

19:50.760 --> 19:51.760
centre.

19:51.760 --> 19:59.110
This centre, Agnya, is the centre of Christ.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.680
Christ resides there.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.870
People say Christ is within us.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.280
Where is He?

20:04.280 --> 20:05.440
Which part?

20:05.440 --> 20:08.020
Where is He placed?

20:08.020 --> 20:09.880
He is placed in this centre.

20:09.880 --> 20:13.630
Now when I say that He is placed in there,
we can prove it.

20:13.630 --> 20:19.220
It can easily proved, because when the Kundalini
rises and if She stops at that centre — which

20:19.220 --> 20:26.170
you can see and feel it, that it has stopped
there — you have to take the name of Christ

20:26.170 --> 20:29.390
and request Him that, “Please allow the
Kundalini to pass."

20:29.390 --> 20:36.840
If He is awakened, of course, that can only
be done by a person who is a realised-soul.

20:36.840 --> 20:44.400
Any Dick, Tom, Harry cannot do it: you cannot
call Christ or anyone because what is the

20:44.400 --> 20:45.530
right you have got?

20:45.530 --> 20:52.300
There has to be a protocol, a connection by
which you can call Him.

20:52.300 --> 21:00.870
Any such person when he calls Christ, He can
be awakened and the Kundalini rises from there:

21:00.870 --> 21:07.730
that’s how you know this is the centre of
Christ.

21:07.730 --> 21:12.000
What is the mantra of this centre?

21:12.000 --> 21:15.240
Surprisingly, it is our, Lord’s prayer.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.410
It’s the mantra.

21:17.410 --> 21:23.690
It’s not only the Lord’s prayer, it’s
a mantra for this centre.

21:23.690 --> 21:28.130
And the weapon of Christ is forgiveness.

21:28.130 --> 21:33.500
When the Kundalini stops here, that means
you think too much.

21:33.500 --> 21:42.230
Imagine all the Christians, or I can say the
Christian nations, think too much.

21:42.230 --> 21:46.000
It’s surprising! We should not think at
all.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.220
I mean Christ has done that for us.

21:47.220 --> 21:50.440
We are not supposed to think.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.030
But we think about everything, we plan about
everything.

21:53.030 --> 21:54.790
We are mad with thinking.

21:54.790 --> 21:57.600
I mean, it grows like a mad weed.

21:57.600 --> 22:03.960
I was in Switzerland, there was a doctor who
came to see me and he said, “Mother, you

22:03.960 --> 22:11.270
can cut my neck or you can break my teeth,
do what you like but stop my thinking!”

22:11.270 --> 22:15.190
He just could not stop thinking.

22:15.190 --> 22:22.320
What is the solution for this thinking in
Sahaja Yoga is you have to forgive.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.800
You have to forgive.

22:23.800 --> 22:29.450
If you forgive, then this centre can be resolved.

22:29.450 --> 22:37.190
But forgiveness is just a myth, because what
are you doing?

22:37.190 --> 22:44.650
If you are troubled by another person, if
you do not forgive that person, that person

22:44.650 --> 22:45.650
is successful.

22:45.650 --> 22:52.130
Because you go on worrying about it, crying
about it, weeping about it, and whatever he

22:52.130 --> 22:58.500
wanted to trouble you for, you are just a
complete proof of it.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.200
So forgiveness means what?

23:01.200 --> 23:06.010
What you are doing is to get rid of his power
over you.

23:06.010 --> 23:12.410
And this is what Christ has said that, “Forgive”
and the greatest thing He did on the cross

23:12.410 --> 23:16.260
was to say that, “Forgive."

23:16.260 --> 23:23.660
Because these people really committed the
real crime of crucifying the Son of God.

23:23.660 --> 23:28.220
But still He said, “Forgive for they do
not know what they are doing”.

23:28.220 --> 23:34.530
They do not know what they are doing, that
He was the Son of God.

23:34.530 --> 23:40.210
It was impossible for people to believe Son
of God.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.330
Imagine! Is He Son of God?

23:43.330 --> 23:47.270
What makes Him that?

23:47.270 --> 23:51.200
His resurrection proved it.

23:51.200 --> 23:56.120
Till then nobody believed Him.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.940
His disciples never believed Him.

23:58.940 --> 24:08.700
He looked like a very ordinary person, carpenter’s
son, having hardly two robes to wear, living

24:08.700 --> 24:12.050
in a very poor condition.

24:12.050 --> 24:19.270
What made Him feel that He was the Son of
God?

24:19.270 --> 24:24.559
His own knowledge about Himself.

24:24.559 --> 24:31.500
Now supposing, somebody is the Son of God,
what should He do to prove it to human beings

24:31.500 --> 24:32.500
are just like walls?

24:32.500 --> 24:39.520
Sometimes I find I am talking to walls, absolutely,
or to some people are looking this side, that

24:39.520 --> 24:42.510
side, and they are not understanding what
I am talking.

24:42.510 --> 24:49.360
How are we to prove that He was the Son of
God?

24:49.360 --> 24:50.429
It’s an impossibility.

24:50.429 --> 24:58.860
And if He was born in modern times He would
have been crucified only when He was five

24:58.860 --> 25:04.040
years of age I can tell you! Because now we
are so ego-oriented.

25:04.040 --> 25:08.900
That time people were stupid but now we think
we are very intelligent: “We know everything!

25:08.900 --> 25:10.180
We know God.

25:10.180 --> 25:17.650
We can organise Him!” There are many who
say that, “We don’t believe in God.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.830
We have created this world.

25:19.830 --> 25:21.440
We are the scientists.

25:21.440 --> 25:23.040
We are this."

25:23.040 --> 25:32.190
Oh God! In this mad world, thank God He was
not born, otherwise He would have been crucified

25:32.190 --> 25:33.210
much earlier.

25:33.210 --> 25:50.340
So, was is impossible to convince at the time
that He was Son of God, but today we can prove

25:50.340 --> 25:55.590
it! Because at that time human beings had
not reached that stage that they could be

25:55.590 --> 25:56.590
given Realisation.

25:56.590 --> 25:59.830
Today, Realisation is working en-masse.

25:59.830 --> 26:11.460
Even in England we have now quite a lot of
people: “Even in England,” and I say.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.850
England itself is really a great country.

26:13.850 --> 26:16.370
It’s the heart of the universe.

26:16.370 --> 26:23.540
It’s the greatest country, as far as the
articulation is concerned.

26:23.540 --> 26:33.179
And the source of all that is good comes from
this country.

26:33.179 --> 26:40.110
But the people, English people, have lost
their self-esteem completely I feel sometimes,

26:40.110 --> 26:45.790
the way they copy French and Americans and
things like that.

26:45.790 --> 26:54.190
If they could have their self-esteem, I still
say that the English youth are the best in

26:54.190 --> 26:55.450
the whole world.

26:55.450 --> 27:02.040
Surprisingly in my own experience I found
that they are the best.

27:02.040 --> 27:09.470
But rather difficult nuts to be cracked! If
they are cracked they are the best.

27:09.470 --> 27:15.590
And once they are there they sort it out because
they understand.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.470
They are very scholarly.

27:17.470 --> 27:26.050
I think by temperament that they understand
when I say, “You cannot pay money for that."

27:26.050 --> 27:31.160
You cannot organise God, and something has
to happen within you.

27:31.160 --> 27:34.370
Some actualisation has to take place.

27:34.370 --> 27:39.520
This is what you should understand if you
are really an Englishman.

27:39.520 --> 27:49.890
Because anything stupid and illogical should
be shunned completely.

27:49.890 --> 27:55.419
Now what is the transformation takes place
[is] that, when this Kundalini rises, She

27:55.419 --> 28:01.190
passes through these different centres which
are already exhausted within us.

28:01.190 --> 28:15.190
For example the second centre that is within
us is the centre for our activity.

28:15.190 --> 28:24.200
Supposing, you think too much, your brains
cells are to be replaced.

28:24.200 --> 28:35.960
This poor little centre has to work very hard
to replace those cells in your brain.

28:35.960 --> 28:42.450
It starts working a bit too hard and neglects
all other duties it has to do.

28:42.450 --> 28:51.410
For example, it has to look after the liver,
the spleen, the pancreas, the kidneys and

28:51.410 --> 28:55.140
the uterus.

28:55.140 --> 29:03.230
But when people indiscriminately just go on
thinking like mad — even thinking about

29:03.230 --> 29:07.220
God — what is it?

29:07.220 --> 29:11.510
It’s like, as I told you, not coming to
Newbury and just thinking about it.

29:11.510 --> 29:13.090
It’s that mad.

29:13.090 --> 29:28.530
Then this centre it gets so tired, and so
tired, it’s so exhausted that diseases like

29:28.530 --> 29:40.740
diabetes, liver and other complications, even
[the] blood centre of this spleen can be so

29:40.740 --> 29:46.550
crazy with this kind of activity that one
can develop blood cancer.

29:46.550 --> 29:51.880
For example, now we are supposed to be running
a rat race.

29:51.880 --> 29:53.210
I mean we are supposed to be.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.360
We are in a race somehow.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.140
Everybody is in a race.

29:57.140 --> 30:04.320
Whether it is in the modern race or in any
other race: we have to belong to a cult or

30:04.320 --> 30:08.590
some sort of a group where everybody is running
a race, you see.

30:08.590 --> 30:17.870
In that racing we forget about the way we
eat our food, then we rush about.

30:17.870 --> 30:28.010
We don’t even give rest to our different
organs as it is required to balance its activities,

30:28.010 --> 30:40.590
[so] what happens that a thing like spleen
get so upset, it’s so upset, that it does

30:40.590 --> 30:43.690
not know when to create more blood cells and
when not to create.

30:43.690 --> 30:49.049
You are eating your food suddenly a telephone
call comes in, you have to get the telephone.

30:49.049 --> 30:51.540
There’s a little child crying, you are looking
after the child.

30:51.540 --> 30:57.169
Now you have to go to the office just leave
your food halfway or whatever you have eaten

30:57.169 --> 30:58.559
and you just rush out.

30:58.559 --> 31:02.690
You run to the bus and the bus is missing
so you run to another bus.

31:02.690 --> 31:10.930
All this madness make this poor spleen really
mad because it does not understand what to

31:10.930 --> 31:20.580
do, how to supply the new blood cells, and
the result is you develop blood cancer.

31:20.580 --> 31:25.299
It’s a very simple reason why people develop
blood cancer.

31:25.299 --> 31:31.400
And then blood cancer we say is curable through
Sahaja Yoga.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.390
It is.

31:34.390 --> 31:40.010
Actually cancer does not settle in to people
who are realised.

31:40.010 --> 31:45.120
But it’s absolutely curable through Sahaj
Yoga.

31:45.120 --> 31:50.151
All kinds of cancers can be cured through
Sahaj Yoga, no doubt, but we are not here

31:50.151 --> 31:52.480
to cure people.

31:52.480 --> 32:01.420
Only those who are seekers the Divine is interested
in.

32:01.420 --> 32:10.570
You will be surprised, a very rich man, I
would say one of the wealthiest men from India,

32:10.570 --> 32:19.080
brought somebody to be cured and I said, “I
am sorry Sir, I cannot cure this person."

32:19.080 --> 32:22.000
And he said, “Why not?

32:22.000 --> 32:26.250
If you cure I’ll build a hospital for you,
I can give an Ashram for you."

32:26.250 --> 32:34.640
I said, “You may do whatever you like, but
I am sorry he cannot be cured."

32:34.640 --> 32:40.160
I did not tell him the reason for that, but
the reason is this: this man has exploited

32:40.160 --> 32:43.630
many people, he’s tortured his wife, he’s
tortured his children.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.990
He’s a horrible fellow.

32:45.990 --> 32:53.730
He has never sought anything good.

32:53.730 --> 32:54.890
He has no compassion.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.460
He has no love.

32:57.460 --> 33:00.360
He’s for himself, a very selfish and a tyrannical
person.

33:00.360 --> 33:05.450
Tomorrow if Hitler comes and say, “Mother,
you give me Realisation."

33:05.450 --> 33:10.850
Do you think Divine is supposed to give him
Realisation, because he thinks no end of himself?

33:10.850 --> 33:17.850
It is for the Divine to decide for you.

33:17.850 --> 33:22.169
It is not for you to decide for the Divine.

33:22.169 --> 33:25.309
The Divine has to say that you are all right.

33:25.309 --> 33:28.730
It’s just the other way round.

33:28.730 --> 33:31.200
Because you may do whatever you like.

33:31.200 --> 33:40.610
You may think that you must get all the blessings
from God, but God has to know that whether

33:40.610 --> 33:44.950
He is going to be gracious on you or not.

33:44.950 --> 33:46.590
Even His anger is His graciousness.

33:46.590 --> 33:54.160
Because that is what you deserve and through
His anger and wrath He is going to cure you

33:54.160 --> 33:56.730
and improve you.

33:56.730 --> 34:01.620
Sometimes we have wrong ideas also about our
seeking.

34:01.620 --> 34:08.250
The seeking comes to us from the third centre
which is in the navel.

34:08.250 --> 34:11.629
We call as ‘Nabhi Chakra’.

34:11.629 --> 34:14.179
Is the navel point.

34:14.179 --> 34:17.630
But it’s all in the spinal cord.

34:17.630 --> 34:26.280
Now this third centre is the centre which
gives us seeking from the very beginning when

34:26.280 --> 34:27.700
we were amoeba.

34:27.700 --> 34:36.629
We started seeking food then, as we became
higher and higher and higher in our seeking

34:36.629 --> 34:46.669
of food, we became human beings, then we started
seeking say, money, position, power, fame.

34:46.669 --> 34:57.490
Then the spiritual seeking came: we started
seeking in religions outside us, organising

34:57.490 --> 35:05.609
religions, calling God, devotion, dedication,
but nothing worked out.

35:05.609 --> 35:09.610
So we started a deeper seeking, meditating.

35:09.610 --> 35:17.910
At this time also, people came down from all
over the world to teach you meditation.

35:17.910 --> 35:27.060
Now meditation cannot be taught, it’s a
happening, when you are in meditation.

35:27.060 --> 35:35.920
You cannot go to meditation: it’s not like
a small little house or a temple or a building

35:35.920 --> 35:37.800
where you can enter into.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.750
It’s a happening.

35:39.750 --> 35:44.300
You are pushed into it.

35:44.300 --> 35:46.790
You just become in meditation.

35:46.790 --> 35:57.580
And this happening take place only when this
Kundalini pierces this fontanel bone area

35:57.580 --> 36:02.859
and you get an actual baptism — actual,
not artificial.

36:02.859 --> 36:13.609
You can see with your naked eyes, the pulsation
of this Kundalini, the rising of this Kundalini

36:13.609 --> 36:21.849
and also the pulsation on the head here, till
it stops and you start feeling the cool breeze

36:21.849 --> 36:24.880
coming simultaneously.

36:24.880 --> 36:32.980
That should happen to you; otherwise don’t
believe in any tall stories.

36:32.980 --> 36:38.270
For which you cannot pay.

36:38.270 --> 36:43.300
For which you cannot think.

36:43.300 --> 36:47.830
For which you cannot organise.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.810
You cannot put in any effort.

36:49.810 --> 36:54.050
It has to happen spontaneously.

36:54.050 --> 36:56.790
So the question comes in: how?

36:56.790 --> 36:59.200
How it happens?

36:59.200 --> 37:03.810
It’s all in, in there.

37:03.810 --> 37:07.920
It’s your own, within yourself.

37:07.920 --> 37:17.020
But say there’s a light, say this is a candle
which has got a wick which has got a wax,

37:17.020 --> 37:19.710
it’s just ready to be enlightened.

37:19.710 --> 37:22.250
Then what you do?

37:22.250 --> 37:30.240
You take one enlightened candle and bring
it nearer the other and you get the results,

37:30.240 --> 37:31.240
finished.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.030
What do you do?

37:33.030 --> 37:44.120
The enlightened candle just acts as a catalytic
agent, and enlightens the another candle without

37:44.120 --> 37:47.200
any effort, without any trouble.

37:47.200 --> 37:54.430
In the same way an enlightened person can
enlighten another person.

37:54.430 --> 37:56.880
It’s very simple.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.470
But that person has to be enlightened.

37:59.470 --> 38:13.880
And the enlightened person must know how to
maintain your enlightenment for the time being.

38:13.880 --> 38:22.560
Like a seed you sprout: now the children may
sprout the seeds and they would not know what

38:22.560 --> 38:23.560
do with it.

38:23.560 --> 38:33.150
But a gardener knows: which sprouts the seed,
then it takes all the saplings separately,

38:33.150 --> 38:43.690
looks after it, allows it to grow, then again
puts it in the soil properly, watches for

38:43.690 --> 38:48.200
its growth till it comes to its maturity.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.430
He looks after it.

38:49.430 --> 38:55.970
In the same way the person who enlightened
should be able to guide you up to that point.

38:55.970 --> 39:04.230
Such a person is called as ‘guru’ in Sanskrit
language but he has to be a guru who should

39:04.230 --> 39:06.230
be able to raise your Kundalini.

39:06.230 --> 39:11.750
Because these days if you say the name of
‘guru’, horrible names and horrible faces

39:11.750 --> 39:16.960
start coming before me and they are not gurus
they are just like satanic forces.

39:16.960 --> 39:19.080
They are horrible people.

39:19.080 --> 39:28.150
How can they be a guru, those who live on
your money: parasites of the worst type! You

39:28.150 --> 39:29.200
should see that.

39:29.200 --> 39:34.690
I mean, if I ask you come and live with me,
for no money at all, will you accept such

39:34.690 --> 39:37.120
a situation?

39:37.120 --> 39:39.140
And these are even worse.

39:39.140 --> 39:43.710
And much worse than any dog, I would say.

39:43.710 --> 39:51.920
Even the dog eats food at your house at least
looks after your house! This is only one way

39:51.920 --> 39:52.920
traffic.

39:52.920 --> 40:01.020
You have to go on giving them money, money,
money, money, becoming poorer and poorer and

40:01.020 --> 40:03.550
what do you get?

40:03.550 --> 40:08.360
Nothing! You must see their lifestyle, it’s
absurd.

40:08.360 --> 40:17.220
They live on your money, they have all the
weaknesses that a scoundrel can have and after

40:17.220 --> 40:21.270
few years you find they’ll land up in the
prison.

40:21.270 --> 40:22.580
Already we have problems with the prison.

40:22.580 --> 40:26.590
So don’t allow any of those gurus come down
here.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.280
Where will you put them?

40:29.280 --> 40:35.080
Like in Switzerland I went and saw one gentleman
there.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.690
He told me that, “There’s a horrible guru
who lives here.

40:38.690 --> 40:41.710
Mother please come and just pay attention
to his ashram."

40:41.710 --> 40:43.160
I said, “All right."

40:43.160 --> 40:49.710
I went with him in his car, and looked at
the place: a huge lavish place he has created

40:49.710 --> 41:00.350
for himself, with very tall walls like a big
palace! And you could see from outside the

41:00.350 --> 41:05.369
amount of money this fellow must have gathered.

41:05.369 --> 41:15.090
And within eight days a nurse fell in love
with a policeman, and this nurse was the private

41:15.090 --> 41:27.230
secretary of this guru who had used that nurse
to poison some oranges to kill some people.

41:27.230 --> 41:35.160
And so the guru, the great, now is in jail
for 14 years.

41:35.160 --> 41:44.160
All such horrid people what have they got
to do with Divine?

41:44.160 --> 41:50.880
But they mesmerise, and once you are mesmerised
your seeking becomes absolutely stupid and

41:50.880 --> 41:51.880
foolish.

41:51.880 --> 41:55.790
You cannot see you are mesmerised.

41:55.790 --> 41:59.220
You cannot understand how you are mesmerised.

41:59.220 --> 42:00.790
You don’t want anything for yourself.

42:00.790 --> 42:07.490
There’s another one who was coming here
the other day, and he said that, “If you

42:07.490 --> 42:10.480
give me a Rolls Royce I’ll come."

42:10.480 --> 42:12.849
Imagine! He was to come from America.

42:12.849 --> 42:21.690
He had already got 58 Rolls Royce from you
people, from you, the English, very wise.

42:21.690 --> 42:28.410
I must say the wisest people in the whole
world, have given 58 Rolls Royces to this

42:28.410 --> 42:35.710
14 year old fellow! Now he has become yankee
in America, taken away all your money, befooling

42:35.710 --> 42:36.710
you.

42:36.710 --> 42:38.859
He has 58 Rolls Royces, he wants 59th.

42:38.859 --> 42:41.680
I don’t know why he wants one more.

42:41.680 --> 42:47.050
Poor boys and girls, they don’t have so
much money now.

42:47.050 --> 42:50.109
Here the young people don’t have much money.

42:50.109 --> 42:55.570
Like in our country maybe rich people’s
children get a lot of money, but here I find

42:55.570 --> 42:58.020
that the young people have to find their own
way.

42:58.020 --> 43:04.780
They starved themselves, ate only potatoes
and fasted, did all kinds of things to save

43:04.780 --> 43:14.099
money to buy a Rolls Royce for this scoundrel,
just think of it! These are all seekers who

43:14.099 --> 43:15.099
did it.

43:15.099 --> 43:24.060
So foolish and stupid! And when he came they
presented him with this Rolls Royce.

43:24.060 --> 43:28.480
My heart really weeps and I really don’t
know what to say to this kind of foolishness

43:28.480 --> 43:29.480
people are doing.

43:29.480 --> 43:38.270
Naturally your parents do not believe in you!
They think: what stupidity you are doing?

43:38.270 --> 43:40.060
I can understand.

43:40.060 --> 43:44.910
Even if they doubt me, I wouldn’t mind,
because really this kind of stupidity you

43:44.910 --> 43:46.280
have done.

43:46.280 --> 43:50.520
And how can you believe such stupid fellow
who asked for a Rolls Royce?

43:50.520 --> 43:55.790
You should have really given him a toy Rolls
Royce and 3, 4 slaps on the face and he would

43:55.790 --> 43:56.790
gone back.

43:56.790 --> 43:58.610
That’s what he deserves.

43:58.610 --> 44:04.440
Now he got this Rolls Royce very nicely, he
cheated you all and went back.

44:04.440 --> 44:12.400
And he’ll come back next year and you will
be again doing the same thing for him!

44:12.400 --> 44:16.290
Now when some of the Sahaja Yogis went and
asked these people that, “Why did you do

44:16.290 --> 44:19.680
it?” They said, “He has given us something
so great.

44:19.680 --> 44:20.970
This is metal.

44:20.970 --> 44:29.320
If we give him the metal and if he gives us
the Spirit why not do it?” It’s foolishness!

44:29.320 --> 44:33.181
Can you get Spirit for giving some metal?

44:33.181 --> 44:34.181
Can you?

44:34.181 --> 44:41.050
Spirit, can you purchase it or could exchange
it?

44:41.050 --> 44:50.470
But
from where this kind of stupidity walks into

44:50.470 --> 44:51.470
your heads?

44:51.470 --> 44:53.010
I mean you are not such stupid people.

44:53.010 --> 44:55.060
Most of them are educated in university: Oxford,
Cambridge.

44:55.060 --> 45:00.070
Did you learn all these stupidity there?

45:00.070 --> 45:04.390
No! It’s some sort of a mesmerism I feel.

45:04.390 --> 45:08.690
Some stupid spirits have entered into their
minds.

45:08.690 --> 45:11.370
That’s the only solution I can get.

45:11.370 --> 45:18.880
I cannot understand what is the reason for
these people to go about buying Rolls Royces

45:18.880 --> 45:20.600
for their gurus.

45:20.600 --> 45:26.109
Then another guru comes up here and tells
you, “I will make you fly."

45:26.109 --> 45:29.190
Very big, big people are out to fly.

45:29.190 --> 45:31.360
But why do you want to fly?

45:31.360 --> 45:35.580
Do you want to become birds?

45:35.580 --> 45:39.830
Have you to become birds now?

45:39.830 --> 45:46.480
You have to become a superior human being,
with superior value systems, built within

45:46.480 --> 45:47.480
you.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.880
You want to fly.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.290
I mean it is stupidity.

45:50.290 --> 45:57.180
Even if somebody gives you ideas like that,
better ask him to fly himself, drop him from

45:57.180 --> 46:03.690
this leaning tower of Pisa and see where does
he lie, which part.

46:03.690 --> 46:07.470
Why do you believe such stupid things, I can’t
understand.

46:07.470 --> 46:09.130
You are supposed to be English.

46:09.130 --> 46:13.130
I mean at least Indians have great ideas about
your brains.

46:13.130 --> 46:14.130
H.

46:14.130 --> 46:15.130
G.

46:15.130 --> 46:18.590
Wells has said that English will have one
day having only heads and no bodies.

46:18.590 --> 46:23.099
But I don’t think that’s going to happen
with the advent of all these stupid gurus

46:23.099 --> 46:27.599
coming here and you people passing out all
your money to them.

46:27.599 --> 46:29.220
I don’t know what is going to happen.

46:29.220 --> 46:35.240
As it is we are suffering from so many other
things, plus this kind of a nonsense coming

46:35.240 --> 46:37.330
all the spirits coming down.

46:37.330 --> 46:43.510
All this negativity working into us I don’t
know what is going to happen to this country

46:43.510 --> 46:44.510
of ours.

46:44.510 --> 46:45.510
I don’t know.

46:45.510 --> 46:46.770
I can’t understand.

46:46.770 --> 46:52.650
Now everybody is meditating in this country,
trying to fly.

46:52.650 --> 47:01.330
Imagine! Doing nothing, sitting at home, meditating:
lethargy of the worst type! Trying to fly.

47:01.330 --> 47:03.210
This is what it is.

47:03.210 --> 47:08.560
That’s what has happened to our seeking
in various ways, in this way or that way or

47:08.560 --> 47:09.560
that way.

47:09.560 --> 47:10.920
No, this is not to happen anymore, enough
of it.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.290
You must get your Realisation.

47:12.290 --> 47:16.440
That’s what you have to have.

47:16.440 --> 47:23.950
The Kundalini has to rise and you have to
get it because you are seekers of ages, ancient

47:23.950 --> 47:24.950
times.

47:24.950 --> 47:27.760
You are born today, here, to get your Realisation.

47:27.760 --> 47:34.000
That’s your right to have it, and not to
be befooled by these people who just come

47:34.000 --> 47:38.880
here and exploit you and have floated a market
and enterprises.

47:38.880 --> 47:44.080
Now this Kundalinis thing comes to you through
that centre.

47:44.080 --> 47:53.630
When it comes to awakening centre, that centre
of your seeking.

47:53.630 --> 48:01.560
Then you start seeing what you are seeking.

48:01.560 --> 48:09.690
You are seeking the joy of your Spirit, the
bliss of peace within yourself.

48:09.690 --> 48:22.630
When the Kundalini rises and shoots off, the
seeking is complete because you have found

48:22.630 --> 48:28.310
it: you are just there, no questions.

48:28.310 --> 48:33.350
Supposing you enlighten the light then what
does the light do?

48:33.350 --> 48:35.900
First, she is asking for the light, all right,
“I must have the light.

48:35.900 --> 48:40.910
I must have the light,” [then] she gives
light — finished.

48:40.910 --> 48:46.440
Then you don’t sit there, you sit here with
me and you give vibrations to people, you

48:46.440 --> 48:49.330
raise their Kundalinis, you awaken them and
give them Realisation.

48:49.330 --> 48:50.500
Yes, it happens.

48:50.500 --> 48:54.740
You all have those powers.

48:54.740 --> 49:01.530
In a split of a second you get that and you
become that.

49:01.530 --> 49:06.760
That’s your style [because] you are human
beings, you are not worms.

49:06.760 --> 49:19.250
You are created out of the billions and billions
of creatures, special ones, the chosen ones,

49:19.250 --> 49:27.930
to bestow this bliss upon you so that you
enter into the Kingdom of your Father, the

49:27.930 --> 49:34.550
God Almighty, and enjoy your being and that’s
what you are.

49:34.550 --> 49:38.180
Why are you wasting and frittering away your
energy on these nonsensical people?

49:38.180 --> 49:41.789
Pay attention to yourself.

49:41.789 --> 49:43.280
Just find out what you are.

49:43.280 --> 49:48.290
It’s a very easy thing: it should happen
to you.

49:48.290 --> 49:53.820
It has happened to so many in this country
and should happen to people in Newbury.

49:53.820 --> 49:57.329
It is Cathy who has brought me here.

49:57.329 --> 50:07.520
Actually now I am on my way to India and you
had this idea not to go out of London, because

50:07.520 --> 50:08.720
I have really travelling too much in Europe.

50:08.720 --> 50:11.119
Of course, I must say Europeans are also very
sensible people: they can see through now.

50:11.119 --> 50:17.170
But I think you have to go through all that
otherwise you would have never understood

50:17.170 --> 50:19.490
the value of Sahaj Yoga.

50:19.490 --> 50:25.980
Perhaps that was necessary for them to spend
a lot of money on these gurus and to suffer

50:25.980 --> 50:27.170
from all kinds of diseases.

50:27.170 --> 50:33.030
There are some here sitting, from there only
suffering from epilepsy and all kinds of horrible

50:33.030 --> 50:34.030
diseases like blood cancer.

50:34.030 --> 50:35.030
They are here, some of them sitting.

50:35.030 --> 50:43.250
Then you will realise the value of Sahaja
Yoga which gives you bliss, joy and happiness.

50:43.250 --> 50:48.540
First of all it gives you the physical well
being.

50:48.540 --> 50:51.849
It just gives you the physical well being.

50:51.849 --> 50:58.560
Like any place where God has to be brought
in, you clean that place.

50:58.560 --> 51:02.890
So the Kundalini cleanses your physical being.

51:02.890 --> 51:06.690
That’s how you get your diseases cured.

51:06.690 --> 51:12.890
Cancer is very simple, extremely simple, to
be cured, very simple to be cured.

51:12.890 --> 51:19.481
But for doctors it is impossible to accept
that there is God, in the real sense of the

51:19.481 --> 51:20.481
word.

51:20.481 --> 51:22.099
Ah, they will have a photograph of Christ
in the house.

51:22.099 --> 51:25.820
They might wear a cross, you see, that’s
at the most.

51:25.820 --> 51:37.420
But to believe that you can cure cancer through
Divine power is an impossibility for them.

51:37.420 --> 51:39.970
But we have some doctors also here.

51:39.970 --> 51:41.900
But if they come to me they think they are
all mad.

51:41.900 --> 51:44.150
Cancer is a simple disease.

51:44.150 --> 51:50.440
Now they have reached a point where they are
coming nearer to Sahaj Yoga.

51:50.440 --> 51:59.270
On the left hand side and the right hand side
we have certain areas, and now they are talking

51:59.270 --> 52:04.960
about these areas which exist within us and
they say there is an attack from these areas

52:04.960 --> 52:15.780
which are built within us from the time of
our creation, and these areas have those deposits

52:15.780 --> 52:24.340
and they send forth some protein matter, which
we cannot identify otherwise, which might

52:24.340 --> 52:28.119
have gone out of circulation of evolution.

52:28.119 --> 52:31.359
When they attack us cancer is triggered.

52:31.359 --> 52:34.320
And now this I have said at least ten years
back.

52:34.320 --> 52:40.150
I have been saying that there are entities
who enter into us.

52:40.150 --> 52:46.920
’Us’ meaning the central path, the middle
path, the middle road.

52:46.920 --> 52:51.260
They come from the sides and attack us.

52:51.260 --> 52:56.910
But actually when we go to the extremes of
the left or to the right, we ourselves become

52:56.910 --> 53:01.980
vulnerable and we are attacked and that’s
how cancer is set in.

53:01.980 --> 53:09.349
So down below is the hell, the left side is
the collective subconscious, the right side

53:09.349 --> 53:14.470
is the collective supraconscious, which is
the future side of it.

53:14.470 --> 53:22.829
In the top is the Divine Power, which is the
superconsciousness we can call it, or the

53:22.829 --> 53:29.609
collective unconscious as they call it, which
becomes conscious as soon as the Kundalini

53:29.609 --> 53:30.900
touches it.

53:30.900 --> 53:37.290
Your attention goes there and the whole thing
is lifted just like the tent being lifted

53:37.290 --> 53:46.250
up, and you find that nothing can enter into
your attention anymore.

53:46.250 --> 53:48.385
You are in that area where you cannot get
attacked.

53:48.385 --> 53:59.369
And this is what has happened to you, to many
of you, and is going to happen to the rest

53:59.369 --> 54:03.420
of the people who have come here for the first
time.

54:03.420 --> 54:10.700
I must say, Newbury, I must find out about
it much more, because I find this place has

54:10.700 --> 54:12.480
tremendous vibrations.

54:12.480 --> 54:18.070
Only when our car arrived here I asked them,
“Where is the water somewhere here?” I

54:18.070 --> 54:22.480
was not dousing but I can feel vibrations
of the water somewhere.

54:22.480 --> 54:25.400
And the place has tremendous vibrations.

54:25.400 --> 54:33.060
Actually I was thinking, “How am I going
to speak?” because as soon as I reached

54:33.060 --> 54:39.030
this place my whole body started emitting
all kinds of energies from the body and I

54:39.030 --> 54:43.700
was really very much worried as to, “What’s
going to happen now?

54:43.700 --> 54:50.980
What am I going to speak?” But this has
worked out and I hope you have been able to

54:50.980 --> 54:52.540
understand it.

54:52.540 --> 55:00.010
Now for the rest of the details you just don’t
worry.

55:00.010 --> 55:05.050
We have all the books and everything for your
information which you can read later on.

55:05.050 --> 55:12.080
It’s is a simple thing, like coming in the
room, you ask me how to put on the lights.

55:12.080 --> 55:17.530
I have to just tell you, “Just press the
switch and it will be on."

55:17.530 --> 55:21.970
In the same way everything is built within
you, you don’t have to do anything about

55:21.970 --> 55:22.970
it.

55:22.970 --> 55:26.369
It will work out in no time.

55:26.369 --> 55:31.250
But once it is worked out then you [should]
try to understand it, what it is, and try

55:31.250 --> 55:33.569
to maintain it for a while.

55:33.569 --> 55:41.460
And you will be amazed that, here in Newbury,
you can start a centre of your own of Sahaj

55:41.460 --> 55:44.570
Yoga, giving Realisation to many people.

55:44.570 --> 55:47.680
May God bless you! Thank you.

55:47.680 --> 55:54.390
If you have any questions you can ask me.

55:54.390 --> 55:57.290
Yes, please.

55:57.290 --> 56:05.990
Man: Yeah I have got a question okay.

56:05.990 --> 56:09.850
Earlier on you were going on about if you
have family, children, and such as, who interrupt

56:09.850 --> 56:11.220
you and the telephone.

56:11.220 --> 56:15.069
What were you trying to say?

56:15.069 --> 56:16.609
Do you want us just ignore this?

56:16.609 --> 56:19.890
Shri Mataji: Oh, not at all! If you are not
married you cannot get Realisation.

56:19.890 --> 56:21.650
Man: Then what do you mean by this?

56:21.650 --> 56:27.619
I tend to think you are you trying to say
that you must try and ignore household attractions

56:27.619 --> 56:28.619
and this…

56:28.619 --> 56:32.500
Shri Mataji: When did I say that?

56:32.500 --> 56:35.070
Man: I don’t quite know.

56:35.070 --> 56:41.530
I had a job to hear everything you say but…

56:41.530 --> 56:46.230
Shri Mataji: No, no, no! Who said that?

56:46.230 --> 56:47.990
Not at all!

56:47.990 --> 56:54.430
Man: What did you mean when you say, “The
telephone rings.."

56:54.430 --> 57:04.050
What do you mean, “You must suddenly stop
and answer the telephone,” but what do you

57:04.050 --> 57:05.050
mean?

57:05.050 --> 57:07.710
Yogini: Mother, it’s when you were talking
about the spleen.

57:07.710 --> 57:10.950
You said that the trouble is that there are
so many distractions that the spleen can’t

57:10.950 --> 57:12.190
handle it, and I think he’s misunderstood
you.

57:12.190 --> 57:13.190
Man: Yeah, that’s right.

57:13.190 --> 57:16.640
Shri Mataji: Ah! No, no, no, you should only
look after your child and not the telephone,

57:16.640 --> 57:17.640
I was meaning.

57:17.640 --> 57:18.640
You must have your priorities properly built
up.

57:18.640 --> 57:19.640
Ours are not.

57:19.640 --> 57:22.520
What I was trying to say a child is lying
there, you are eating your food, a telephone

57:22.520 --> 57:28.550
is coming, now you have to rush out, the child
is neglected, you run away, you are worried

57:28.550 --> 57:30.900
about the child — never that [what you were
suggesting].

57:30.900 --> 57:33.130
You don’t know in Sahaja Yoga you have to
be married.

57:33.130 --> 57:35.010
There’s a centre of marriage.

57:35.010 --> 57:36.400
You will be amazed.

57:36.400 --> 57:39.420
If you are a so called ascetic, I can’t
give you Realisation.

57:39.420 --> 57:42.300
Another man: You can’t what?

57:42.300 --> 57:46.849
Shri Mataji: You can’t get your Realisation
if you are an ascetic.

57:46.849 --> 57:48.150
So called.

57:48.150 --> 57:50.180
Asceticism is within yourself.

57:50.180 --> 57:55.869
A person like Guru Nanaka and all these great
people they were all married people.

57:55.869 --> 57:59.390
It doesn’t mean that you have to give up
your family at all.

57:59.390 --> 58:05.170
On the contrary, we have to have families,
beautiful families and beautiful children

58:05.170 --> 58:07.270
and we are having Sahaja Yoga marriages.

58:07.270 --> 58:12.150
Do you know there are three or four couples
here who were married through Sahaj Yoga.

58:12.150 --> 58:15.270
And they are beautiful people, they have beautiful
children.

58:15.270 --> 58:22.680
And moreover I must tell you a greater news:
that there are lots of realised-souls who

58:22.680 --> 58:25.270
are born in this country.

58:25.270 --> 58:28.760
And you have to be married so that they are
born to you also.

58:28.760 --> 58:34.050
Now this child is a realised-soul, she is
sitting, towards me.

58:34.050 --> 58:40.140
To be sitting that quietly is not possible
unless and until they are realised.

58:40.140 --> 58:41.140
This Alison is born-realised.

58:41.140 --> 58:42.710
Man: My children, my three children: They
are not realised and they are sitting here

58:42.710 --> 58:43.710
all quiet!

58:43.710 --> 58:44.710
Shri Mataji: Who?

58:44.710 --> 58:45.869
Man: My children, my 3 children, they are
not realised so you are taking…

58:45.869 --> 58:46.869
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

58:46.869 --> 58:47.869
Let me see where are they?

58:47.869 --> 58:48.869
Man: One, two, three.

58:48.869 --> 58:49.980
Shri Mataji: They must be born-realised, I
am sure.

58:49.980 --> 58:50.980
Man: They are not! They are not!

58:50.980 --> 58:53.280
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

58:53.280 --> 58:55.990
How do you know?

58:55.990 --> 58:58.030
We’ll tell them.

58:58.030 --> 59:00.760
How do you know?

59:00.760 --> 59:08.280
You don’t know, you are not yet realised
but they are, must be I am sure, 100%.

59:08.280 --> 59:13.589
Man: Well it seems that anything you say,
goes.

59:13.589 --> 59:15.060
Shri Mataji: We’ll teach you how to know.

59:15.060 --> 59:16.060
We’ll teach you how to know.

59:16.060 --> 59:17.060
You should get your Realisation.

59:17.060 --> 59:18.060
Where are they?

59:18.060 --> 59:19.060
I would love to see them.

59:19.060 --> 59:20.060
I can’t see them.

59:20.060 --> 59:21.250
Man: But they are quiet all the time.

59:21.250 --> 59:22.490
I say it’s instinct.

59:22.490 --> 59:24.680
Shri Mataji: Come along, come, come.

59:24.680 --> 59:26.760
They must be born-realised to be quiet like
that.

59:26.760 --> 59:27.760
I would like to see them.

59:27.760 --> 59:28.760
I am sure.

59:28.760 --> 59:29.760
How would you know their value?

59:29.760 --> 59:31.920
I would love to see them.

59:31.920 --> 59:35.950
Oh that, she is realised 100%.

59:35.950 --> 59:40.740
Are you doubting her Realisation?

59:40.740 --> 59:43.369
She is born-realised.

59:43.369 --> 59:44.619
She is born as a realised-soul.

59:44.619 --> 59:46.480
She is born-realised, no doubt.

59:46.480 --> 59:50.570
I mean I knew, I was going to ask about her.

59:50.570 --> 59:52.060
How do you know?

59:52.060 --> 59:55.650
You are a great person to have three children
born-realised, I must say.

59:55.650 --> 59:59.780
For example, the little one there is a born-realised
and the little in that corner is a born-realised.

59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.250
And there are many born-realised people, also
there are people who are there.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.670
Where is Alan is he there?

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:07.690
Man: It’s just natural it doesn’t need
a big word for it, does it!

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:11.570
Shri Mataji: They are born-realised because
they got their Realisation in their previous

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:12.570
lives.

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:15.350
It is a very big thing for people who are
not realised.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.930
Man: What do they know about previous lives?

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:20.180
They don’t know anything about previous
lives.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.560
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am going to tell
them.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.330
That’s why I am here.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:26.800
They are born because I am here.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.220
Do you know that?

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.150
I am going to tell them what it is.

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:34.830
See these, these are all born-realised [those]
two people [who] are coming.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:36.170
Ask them about it.

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:41.410
I never gave them Realisation they are born-realised
but I gave them the knowledge about what they

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:42.410
are.

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:46.540
(Sit down my child, sit down.) They are all
realised-souls, no doubt about it! Not [just]

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:53.069
realised-souls but they could be very great
souls born on this Earth.

01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:55.990
It is not [that] they are quiet because they
are told to be.

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:59.990
If they were not realised-souls they would
have run away.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:03.540
They would not have been sitting because they
are enjoying it.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.869
Their Spirit is enjoying it.

01:01:05.869 --> 01:01:07.260
You will know it very soon.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.750
Man: They will sit quietly anywhere!

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:11.820
Shri Mataji: No, no, they might because they
are realised-souls.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:15.830
Man: No, it doesn’t mean they are realised-souls,
it just means they are children.

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:19.850
Shri Mataji: They are very different types
of children, very different type, something

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:20.850
so unique.

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:24.620
Once you get your Realisation you will start
seeing their beauty much better.

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.080
Oh! They know such a lot you can’t imagine.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.380
My four grandchildren are born-realised but
my own daughters were not.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.550
What am I to do?

01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:40.040
And four of them are great people, but my
own daughters were not.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.280
What to do?

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.720
They are born-realised.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.110
You will see that.

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:49.110
They are that.

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:50.800
You should be a proud man.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.870
But you better get your Realisation, all right.

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:57.780
I am happy you are so concerned about your
children.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.080
I am very happy.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.380
May God bless you.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380
Any other questions?

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:07.910
Seeker: I am very impressed with what you
said about Christ having done thinking for

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:13.710
us and we ourselves are trying to think too
much.

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:29.510
Isn’t there a danger, if we all become child-like
trusters, that we could be exploited?

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:34.140
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is a danger, of course.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.690
I mean you are already exploited 100%.

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:38.310
There is a danger, no doubt.

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:41.220
I have already told you about the danger.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.339
But to become child-like is not easy.

01:02:43.339 --> 01:02:47.859
You can be befooled but to be child-like is
the best thing.

01:02:47.859 --> 01:02:49.850
Innocence is the most powerful thing.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:56.260
If you are innocent nobody can touch you.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.250
But very difficult to be innocent.

01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:05.440
The centre of innocence has to be awakened
within us, then you will be like children.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:13.119
Now would you say that Christ was exploited,
many people feel that way that He was exploited:

01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:16.050
no! It was all planned very well.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:17.640
He just played a drama.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.160
Such people do not suffer.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.550
I do not suffer, never.

01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:25.730
Even if I say that I am suffering it’s just
a joke.

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.810
Never take that seriously.

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:29.640
It’s a drama.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.079
Such people don’t suffer.

01:03:32.079 --> 01:03:36.670
He never suffered, in the sense you understand
suffering.

01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:41.069
Of course, with the physical body you do feel
little pain here and there.

01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:48.869
But you just see it as a witness.

01:03:48.869 --> 01:03:50.990
You are not really in it.

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:57.099
And when you become that, yourself, a witness,
nobody can exploit you.

01:03:57.099 --> 01:04:03.780
Because what happens you develop a new type
of a dimension, an awareness, which is called

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.780
as vibratory awareness.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.570
By this enlightenment of your fingers you
become collectively conscious.

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:16.619
Immediately you know who is who, what is what.

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:19.450
Children know it, those who are realised-souls
specially know it.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.650
Any funny man comes in they start crying and
weeping.

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:26.180
Like this girl’s father and mother were
involved in a nonsense.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:29.490
They are here now.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:34.260
Both suffered a lot the mother became epileptic
and all that.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:41.869
And this child used to scream whenever she
saw their revered guru, and she used to shout

01:04:41.869 --> 01:04:45.880
and resist and she used to kick him.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.320
She is just a child but she knew how to protect.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:55.820
And these people with all their intelligence
and education and this and that, were absolutely

01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:00.970
useless! Because you develop that new awareness
within you by which you can feel a person,

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:01.970
you know.

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:02.970
You cannot be exploited.

01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:03.970
All right.

01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:11.250
That has to happen to you.

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.950
That’s a happening.

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:19.450
Such a powerful personality develops, such
a powerful personality.

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:25.940
That way, many of our Sahaj Yogis also think
that I am a quite an innocent person, I mean

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.940
they think so, but now they know I know everything.

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:35.089
I may look such a fool, but I am not.

01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:43.870
And the powerfulness is such, that first the
compassion, the compassion itself is so powerful,

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:46.320
so engulfing, it’s so rewarding.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.460
Then you are not bothered about anyone.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:52.140
What are they going to do to you?

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:58.150
Like in India when I started, right and left
criticising, all these gurus, taking their

01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:59.150
names.

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:02.250
I started saying, “Now these people are
like this.

01:06:02.250 --> 01:06:05.540
These people, they are making money and befooling
you."

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:11.369
Some of the guru’s people, who were [become]
Sahaja Yogis, one of them was some Raja or

01:06:11.369 --> 01:06:15.359
some place, he came to me and said, “Mother,
what are you doing?

01:06:15.359 --> 01:06:16.359
They will kill You."

01:06:16.359 --> 01:06:21.440
I said, “This time let them try killing
me! Who is going to kill me, I’ll see?

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.950
That was done once for all.

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:27.470
Now let me see who is going to kill me."

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:32.070
I said, “Let them lift their hands towards
me, if they can they’ll shake.

01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:33.740
They cannot kill me."

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:41.530
It’s the most powerful thing is your innocence
which we have lost sometimes foolishly.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.440
It is the highest thing.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:50.150
And nobody can exploit an innocent person,
nobody can befool.

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:55.690
You have seen simple village folk, how do
they exist with all the cunning of the very

01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:58.250
well educated and sophisticated people, how
do they exist?

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:10.710
They can manage them just like this (clicks
Her fingers) And you must see the intentions

01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:23.310
of the person: why a person should exploit,
what is the need of the person.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:27.390
People don’t even see the credibility of
a personality who comes here.

01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:28.420
It’s very surprising.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.140
Like one guru came here.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:38.460
I would say, it’s something, another foolishness
who was living in a tin shed, that is what

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:47.730
Peter told me in South Africa, and thousands
and thousands of people are his disciples.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:48.730
To such an extent you will be surprised.

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:52.150
I mean, I don’t know what to say, this is
complete blindness.

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:56.390
I went to Norwich, so far away.

01:07:56.390 --> 01:08:00.640
This fellow has come to London only.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:09.310
And I met three elderly ladies who were his
disciples and this gentleman was later on

01:08:09.310 --> 01:08:17.750
found to be having whisky every night and
using women, and he had all kinds of things.

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:24.210
And his private secretary herself disclosed
everything about him.

01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:25.923
And then they found it out and they verified
it.

01:08:25.923 --> 01:08:27.319
But these three foolish women still said,
“Whatever it is Mother we cannot give him

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:28.359
up, we love him."

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:30.830
Now what to do to with such stupid women?

01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:32.780
You just tell me.

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:48.110
I mean the question of you also wanting to
get exploited! I mean he is exposed, everybody

01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:56.150
knows about it, this gentleman about whom
I told you who was asking for a Rolls Royce,

01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:59.430
was caught for smuggling three hundred watches
in India.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:03.949
I mean how can a man like that be interested
in smuggling?

01:09:03.949 --> 01:09:12.910
Just think of that! But all these people who
carried those watches went to the police and

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:17.589
said, “We brought it for ourselves."

01:09:17.589 --> 01:09:22.580
Three hundred watches this fellow was carrying!
And they would not give in.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:29.970
And when he went to jail, they put a big show,
and the Indian government did not know what

01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:33.530
to do so they said, “All right you take
him away.

01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:39.310
We don’t want to keep him in jail that otherwise
your government will come and say why our

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:45.680
three hundred Britishers are arrested,”
imagine! So they sent all the bad lock, stock

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.819
and barrel back.

01:09:46.819 --> 01:09:49.009
So he came back here.

01:09:49.009 --> 01:09:52.089
From here he has gone to America.

01:09:52.089 --> 01:09:58.199
Now if you don’t want to see: I mean, isn’t
it clear cut what I said?

01:09:58.199 --> 01:09:59.699
So clear cut.

01:09:59.699 --> 01:10:02.560
If you don’t want to see it what can you
do?

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.190
I mean I tell you, sometimes I feel it is
the people who want to get exploited or they

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.570
don’t want to see it.

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:14.340
Now I would like one of them to speak to you
it would be a good idea.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:19.240
Because you will know how he was caught and
how he was disillusioned.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.240
Peter (Pierce)?

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.890
Is he there, just tell him.

01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:26.230
So you will know how he was befooled.

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:35.580
He was supposed to be a great, he is, he was,
a great diamond merchant from South Africa;

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:42.460
married a granddaughter of a Duke of your
country, and that the granddaughter is also

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:43.460
here.

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.460
Peter?

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.590
Where is he?

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:46.670
Peter?

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:50.070
I would like you to tell them what happened
with you and how you got exploited.

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:51.070
That would be a better idea.

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:52.070
You have it from your own kith and kin.

01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:53.070
Just tell them.

01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:54.070
(End of Amruta recording)

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:57.239
Shri Mataji: No, but the question is like
this you were out, I must ask you the question

01:10:57.239 --> 01:10:58.239
is that, “Why did you get exploited like
that?

01:10:58.239 --> 01:10:59.239
What happened actually, what happened to you
people that you accept this kind of a situation,

01:10:59.239 --> 01:10:59.248
is the point, isn’t it?” Ah! That’s
the question.
