1
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,460
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis.

2
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:13,273
In this beautiful surround, surroundings,

3
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:26,805
many of you are wondering why God has created these beautiful things.

4
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:30,725
Because you people had to come on this Earth

5
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:34,611
and enjoy the beauty that is one of the reasons.

6
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:40,887
And now God feels very much fulfilled

7
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:55,933
with the joy and satisfaction and a kind of a completion of His desire.

8
00:08:56,014 --> 00:09:05,315
Why God has created this beautiful universe
has been a question

9
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:09,100
asked for thousands of years.

10
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:17,373
The reason is very simple to understand:

11
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:24,759
this beauty that is created cannot see itself.

12
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:35,210
In the same way, God who is the source
of beauty, cannot see its own beauty,

13
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,224
like a pearl cannot enter into itself to see its beauty,

14
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:46,712
like the sky cannot understand its own beauty,

15
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:52,011
the stars cannot see their own beauty,

16
00:09:52,091 --> 00:10:03,969
the Sun cannot behold its own brilliance.

17
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:13,858
In the same way God Almighty cannot behold His own being.

18
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:17,188
He needs a mirror

19
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:25,132
and that is how He has created this
beautiful universe as His mirror.

20
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:31,679
In this mirror He has created now beautiful things like the Sun,

21
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:38,577
then the Sun has to see his own reflection also.

22
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:45,727
So, he has created these beautiful trees to see that

23
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:53,299
when he shines, they come up so well and look so green.

24
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:58,503
Then He has created those birds to rise early in the morning

25
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:05,850
 to greet the Sun, so the Sun knows that: “Yes, I am there, I am existing”;

26
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,820
or else He has created these beautiful lakes
for these trees to see their reflection

27
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:18,560
and the lakes to feel their existence when the
ripples start moving within themselves.

28
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,210
So then He created human beings.

29
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,139
The human beings cannot also see their own beauty, their own glory.

30
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:31,370
That is why they are in the darkness, they are ignorant.

31
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,913
They cannot see what lies within themselves.

32
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:44,269
So they are running after something
which is absolutely against themselves,

33
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:50,582
which is ugliness, which is self destructive.

34
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:56,509
And the struggle to get to is such a lot,

35
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:59,964
that as a result, they destroy themselves.

36
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:05,432
Like as people have taken to these drugs, taken to all bad
habits

37
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:08,930
– of in this place, they say a lot of smuggling going on –

38
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:14,201
and all such endeavors that people take up because they do not know

39
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:16,840
what beautiful things they are.

40
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,037
So now a mirror has to be created for them,
to see for themselves how beautiful they are.

41
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:27,171
Their mirror is their Spirit.

42
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:32,418
That Spirit is to be brought in their consciousness, their attention.

43
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:37,827
If it comes in their attention then they can see their image.

44
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:47,928
Now this attention that comes in as an enlightened attention

45
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:53,980
is called in Sanskrit language as chidabhas

46
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,942
is the expression of the attention which is enlightened.

47
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:07,164
But it is also said that it is got a nature, which is very transitory,

48
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:13,156
or, we can say, which is disappearing every moment to moment.

49
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:17,261
When
this is happening what is to be done?

50
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:23,396
For that you have to steady yourself with meditation,

51
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:29,135
with hearing the enlightened talks,

52
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:38,090
by seeing the good things of life without thinking about them,

53
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,852
by seeing also the goodness of others

54
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:47,134
and then you start seeing
goodness in yourself also.

55
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:50,990
That is why I always say that one should not feel guilty.

56
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:59,322
Because you are feeling guilty of something, which is just, just an illusion.

57
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:04,347
You are guilty that you have got a shadow. It is something like that.

58
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,022
So if you know that you are beautiful beings

59
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:13,870
and that you have got a shadow is nothing to do with you and your beauty.

60
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:20,479
If you can see you own beauty then you will be amazed that within us lies

61
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,748
all those joy giving, all those beautiful
things, which we are seeing outside.

62
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:29,428
But just now, the mirror is not all right,

63
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:32,716
that’s
why you have to see in the nature the beauty.

64
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:43,124
But, when you are one with your Self, then
you see all these nature within yourself,

65
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:46,860
all the joy giving qualities of this nature within yourself.

66
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:53,420
So I wanted you to come to this place just
to learn how God has created this beautiful

67
00:14:54,846 --> 00:15:00,027
area for you people to enjoy and to be here.

68
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,240
May God bless you.
