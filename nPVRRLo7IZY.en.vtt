00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.847
It is so Sahaj today that the day
of celebration

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:24.343
has fallen onto the birthday
of Shri Ganesh.

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:30.777
Every month they celebrate the fourth day
of the moon

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:39.636
as the birth date of Shri Ganesh,
and today is that date.

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:48.156
Luckily, we are here for the Puja
of Shri Ganesha on His birthday.

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:58.568
I’ve said a lot about Shri Ganesha
and His importance in our life.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:07.540
He is the giver of wisdom, but this wisdom
comes from our innocence.

00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:14.676
Innocence that is innate within us.

00:01:14.877 --> 00:01:27.061
As children we are innocent, but as we
grow we start exerting ourselves

00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:32.165
in a manner that we start losing
our innocence.

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:39.287
We lose it in two ways; once we have
lost our innocence,

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:43.100
we cannot believe that others
could be innocent.

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:49.984
Another is, that we think innocence
is not important.

00:01:53.274 --> 00:02:01.324
Innocence is the sustenance, is the basis
of spirituality.

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:07.903
If a person doesn’t have innocence,
he cannot rise in spirituality.

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:11.562
That’s why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is

00:02:11.763 --> 00:02:15.991
to establish Shri Ganesha within you,
to awaken Him.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:21.887
As soon as the Kundalini awakens, you must
know that Shri Ganesha comes into being.

00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:28.288
Without His awakening within you,
Kundalini cannot be raised.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.578
But it could be temporary, or it could
be a permanent thing.

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:40.900
It could be very temporary with people
who are not yet adjusted

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:49.793
to the new method, or to the ways
of God’s love.

00:02:49.994 --> 00:02:54.909
Those who have not understood, or those
who have not gone through those traditions,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.641
it is rather difficult for them to establish
Shri Ganesha within them.

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:09.336
At this point I find, there are people
who fight with their problems,

00:03:09.537 --> 00:03:15.398
and try to overcome the outward problems,
and establish Shri Ganesha.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.636
But there are other people who are still
not there;

00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:26.892
they start doubting others’ innocence.
In Sahaja Yoga is a very common failing.

00:03:27.093 --> 00:03:30.233
I have seen people complaining
about others,

00:03:30.434 --> 00:03:33.580
saying that their innocence is not
established.

00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:37.828
Is the first sign that your own innocence
is in danger.

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.542
Because you doubt yourself, you are
doubting others.

00:03:41.743 --> 00:03:46.508
If you are doubting others, then be sure
that you are not going to gain anything.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.102
Your job is to look after yourself,
and not others.

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:54.377
And if you start doing like this, gradually
in your Mooladhara,

00:03:54.538 --> 00:04:00.598
there will be lots of these bhoots
that will just jump in.

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.056
And they’ll give you more ideas and more
ideas of doubting others.

00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:10.633
By doubting others, you can never correct
them, and never yourself.

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:18.073
So those people who indulge into this kind
of practices, go away from their innocence.

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:22.606
They try to find out what others are doing,
what are their ways

00:04:22.807 --> 00:04:29.373
of using other people in Sahaja Yoga,
for their own purposes.

00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:36.489
Or some sort of a funny spy-like attitude,
they develop.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.375
In Sahaja Yoga, you have to only spy
yourself, and not others.

00:04:40.576 --> 00:04:43.636
Those who start spying themselves,
criticizing others,

00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:46.776
will never rise higher than what you are.

00:04:46.977 --> 00:04:50.238
In the beginning, I have seen many
Sahaja Yogis who come,

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.843
also try to do this, to criticize others;
this is the sign of their immaturity,

00:04:56.044 --> 00:05:04.165
sign of their, also, poor awakening
of their Shri Ganesha.

00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:07.709
So those who come for the first time
should be very careful

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.306
that still we have to achieve a lot,

00:05:10.507 --> 00:05:14.562
and we should not start doubting others,
making remarks about others.

00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:22.030
Because in innocence, people can be very,
very simple, very friendly,

00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:26.996
but inside their hearts there is no malice,
there’s no filth.

00:05:27.197 --> 00:05:31.040
But those who come for the first time
sometimes have the filth within them.

00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:35.460
And they see the reflection of their
own filth in other people.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.723
I had gone to a program in Kolhapur,

00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:41.153
and you know how your Mother is innocent
and pure -

00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:45.153
and a gentleman came and he told Me
that he has a Nabhi problem.

00:05:45.354 --> 00:05:49.339
So I said: ‘All right, you put your hand
on My Nabhi’. He put his hand there,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.157
and the women there, who were really
funny women, they said:

00:05:53.358 --> 00:05:57.240
‘Why should Mother allow another man
to touch Her knee?’

00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:01.660
They could not understand that: ‘How could
anybody touch a lady’s knee?’

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:07.898
But once you are at that level, you don’t
really know that there is bad in it.

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.500
And you just say: ‘All right, it’s
all right, you can touch my knee.’

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:15.193
And the fellow got all right with his
trouble with his Nabhi.

00:06:15.394 --> 00:06:18.410
So you see, the thing is, if your eyes
are clean,

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:21.976
you can understand what is clean
and what is unclean.

00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:27.560
But if your eyes are not clean, you start
seeing something that you want to see.

00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:30.757
Or sometimes you see something that
never exists.

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.516
So I would request all the new Sahaja Yogis
who are here,

00:06:34.717 --> 00:06:39.730
not to criticize the old Sahaja Yogis, and
this is very anti-God activity.

00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:45.852
Never say a word about the old Sahaja
Yogis. Because I have heard complaints,

00:06:46.053 --> 00:06:48.902
people came and complained to Me.
And I was amazed.

00:06:49.103 --> 00:06:54.059
Those who are just now there, how can they
start criticizing other Sahaja Yogis?

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.586
That means you are trying to hit
the roots of Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:58.787 --> 00:07:01.393
And this is not the way you are going
to help.

00:07:01.594 --> 00:07:05.564
So I have to request you, please, look
after your own vibrations,

00:07:05.765 --> 00:07:12.342
look after your own ascent, look after what
you have done for Sahaj Yog, and then talk.

00:07:12.543 --> 00:07:17.981
Suddenly, if you just enter into Sahaja
Yoga and start criticizing others

00:07:18.182 --> 00:07:22.776
about their innocence, you are hitting
the Ganesha at the root of it.

00:07:22.977 --> 00:07:26.797
So be careful; of course, you’ll be hit,
no doubt.

00:07:26.998 --> 00:07:30.762
And such people, who have done like this,
I have seen, have ended up with cancer.

00:07:30.963 --> 00:07:35.142
Because Ganesha is the one, when He gets
angry, the first thing you get is cancer.

00:07:35.343 --> 00:07:39.351
So be careful, I’m warning you, don’t try
these tricks anymore.

00:07:39.552 --> 00:07:45.898
Try to improve your spirituality, so that
you can enjoy the joy of Shri Ganesha.

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:52.963
This is one side; and the second side is,
that to keep Shri Ganesha intact

00:07:53.164 --> 00:07:59.063
we have to have certain maryadas, everybody
must have certain maryadas.

00:07:59.264 --> 00:08:02.274
Like that, I would say that I will ask
a lady

00:08:02.475 --> 00:08:06.114
to put her hand even up to My heart point
from the front.

00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:10.211
But I would not ask a man to do that,
because there is a maryada -

00:08:10.412 --> 00:08:13.390
if you are a man, you are not supposed
to touch My front side,

00:08:13.591 --> 00:08:17.541
but you can touch My backside. There are
maryadas for everything,

00:08:17.742 --> 00:08:22.524
and if you do not observe these maryadas,
or these boundaries,

00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:33.026
then you are apt to get out of it, despite
the fact that you are pure.

00:08:33.227 --> 00:08:36.258
And you might create a problem
unnecessarily.

00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:38.973
I’ll give you a very good example
of Shri Mahavira,

00:08:39.174 --> 00:08:42.906
who was the incarnation of Bhairava.

00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:47.746
Himself Bhairava took on this work, and to
Bhairava what is cloth? What is dress?

00:08:47.947 --> 00:08:53.113
I mean He is a person - to Him the whole
universe is His clothes,

00:08:53.314 --> 00:08:56.883
or the whole directions are His clothes,
He is a digambara.

00:08:57.084 --> 00:09:02.502
To Him, what does it matter. He is so
innocent. He is absolute innocence Himself.

00:09:02.703 --> 00:09:06.026
And the innocence that is destructive,
that will destroy.

00:09:06.227 --> 00:09:10.224
Through Him only you get your cancer,
when you start misbehaving.

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:17.549
So it’s such a simple man like Him, in the
sense that He never knew what was impurity,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.474
He didn’t know what sin was. Such
a personality came on this earth

00:09:22.675 --> 00:09:27.347
to teach people to be innocent, to be
dharmic, to be good.

00:09:27.548 --> 00:09:34.715
Now this one once had to go to some forest

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:40.613
where half of His cloth got caught up
in the bushes.

00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:44.832
So He had to cut it off, and He was left
with half of the cloth.

00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:51.490
And when He came out on the village
outskirts, He met a person,

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:56.112
who was actually Shri Krishna, who tried
to take His pariksha [ED: means ’test’],

00:09:56.313 --> 00:09:59.936
just came there, and He said that:
‘Why should you have any cloth?

00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:04.177
There is no need, but I am a human being,
I’ve no clothes on My body.

00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:09.122
So You are a God, You are an Incarnation,
so why don’t You give your cloth to Me?’

00:10:09.323 --> 00:10:12.579
He said: ‘All right, take it.’ He gave away
the part that was there.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.528
And that’s how, for a very short time,
He was without clothes – very short time.

00:10:17.729 --> 00:10:21.875
But that people have exploited, and are
making Him nude,

00:10:22.076 --> 00:10:24.969
and making all His private parts
in such details.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.928
All nonsense they are doing. Now many
people ask Me:

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:31.775
‘How is it that Jains indulge into this
nudity and all that?’

00:10:31.976 --> 00:10:37.247
This is all absurdity; it’s nothing,
nothing anywhere near Mahavira.

00:10:37.448 --> 00:10:41.392
Nobody’s a Mahavira to become even nude,
even for a short time.

00:10:41.593 --> 00:10:46.166
So why should they do it? Because
everybody tries to find out

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:52.848
something that is a loophole, just to cover
up their own weaknesses.

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:57.274
And all such weaknesses tell upon
the progenies.

00:10:57.475 --> 00:11:02.775
Now that has gone so far, that they cannot
understand that Shri Mahavir –

00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:07.833
He was a digambara, He was a person
who did not need any clothes.

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:12.641
Still, just to keep the samayachar, He did
wear His cloth throughout,

00:11:12.842 --> 00:11:17.802
and later on also; but for a short time
He gave away His clothes.

00:11:18.003 --> 00:11:20.056
That doesn’t mean that in the public
He became nude,

00:11:20.257 --> 00:11:23.460
suddenly He took out His clothes and
all that, it doesn’t mean that.

00:11:23.661 --> 00:11:29.898
He respected the public and that, not only
but He respected His parents to begin with,

00:11:30.099 --> 00:11:34.746
before He took to real sannyasa.
He respected His parents,

00:11:34.947 --> 00:11:39.957
and He said that: ‘Now the time has come
for Me to give up this worldly life.

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:46.098
He had - I have been indulging into worldly
affairs, and I have to take to sannyasa’.

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:49.742
Sannyasa doesn’t mean that He was not
a sannyasi, He was – but means

00:11:49.943 --> 00:11:54.835
that the worldly life of His parents, and
other people, He had to give up.

00:11:55.036 --> 00:11:57.859
Because if you have to indulge sometimes
into this life –

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.693
like in the Hindu tradition, after certain
age, say, seventy-five they say,

00:12:03.894 --> 00:12:08.483
you have to take a sannyasa, in the sense
that your family, your children,

00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:12.278
are settled down now, there’s no problem,
so you have to take a sannyasa.

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:15.646
But for that, the wisdom has to be gathered
in young age;

00:12:15.853 --> 00:12:19.399
otherwise, in old age, still there is
no wisdom, and you are behaving

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.400
like a young man of sixteen years –
is better you don’t take sannyasa.

00:12:25.387 --> 00:12:33.313
So the whole understanding about life
in India has to be very subtle.

00:12:33.514 --> 00:12:36.955
And to understand these great and great
people,

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:40.506
you have to be little bit greater than
what you are.

00:12:40.707 --> 00:12:46.693
If you are just mud, how can you see
the goal? You cannot.

00:12:46.894 --> 00:12:49.163
So you have to remove this mud
from your eyes.

00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:54.775
This is a very common feature in the West
that, either they are suspicious,

00:12:54.976 --> 00:12:58.620
or they are in it; there’s nothing
in between.

00:12:59.525 --> 00:13:02.410
Either the people who are suspicious
of others,

00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:08.714
or there are people who are indulging
into it, so have it a middle way.

00:13:08.915 --> 00:13:12.453
First thing I have to request, because you
are the first Sahaja Yogis now,

00:13:12.654 --> 00:13:16.078
who have come for the first time to India,

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:25.534
that this soil of our country is full
of rhythm of Shri Ganesh.

00:13:25.735 --> 00:13:30.560
You are sitting on it; you have to vow
that: ‘I will establish my Ganesha.’

00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:33.844
Don’t worry about others, your attention
on others is wrong.

00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:38.114
‘I’ll establish my Ganesha, and let this
Mother Earth

00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:42.639
give me the full strength to establish
my Shri Ganesh.’

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.362
This is very important because, unless and
until your Shri Ganesh is established,

00:13:48.568 --> 00:13:54.720
you cannot be connected to the whole, nor
can you have the enjoyment of your Spirit.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.746
You’ll be a half-baked personality,
which you should not be.

00:13:58.947 --> 00:14:06.192
So far, I’ve seen that the western Sahaja
Yogis are extremely assiduous.

00:14:06.393 --> 00:14:09.425
And they take things very seriously,
they get to it.

00:14:09.626 --> 00:14:13.350
Because, they know, if they have to have
joy, they have to work it out.

00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:17.646
So you have to be an introvert, as far
as you are concerned.

00:14:17.847 --> 00:14:23.380
And as far as others are concerned, you have
to be just seeing the good points of others.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.310
Always see the good points, not the bad
points.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.963
Otherwise you’ll create problems
for yourself,

00:14:29.164 --> 00:14:32.024
and a day will come, you’ll have to get
out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:32.225 --> 00:14:34.997
It has happened with many who tried
these things.

00:14:35.198 --> 00:14:38.198
And they are out, absolutely out
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:41.817
If you have to be in Sahaja Yoga, you have
to understand

00:14:42.018 --> 00:14:46.409
that, to be one with the whole, try to look
after yourself.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:51.183
Another thing I have told you that in every
country I have to have somebody

00:14:51.384 --> 00:14:54.156
on whom I have to depend. Just like
Shri Ganesha,

00:14:54.357 --> 00:14:57.735
I depend on Him for many things;
He looks after many things;

00:14:57.936 --> 00:15:02.087
in the same way, in every country, I have
to have somebody there.

00:15:02.288 --> 00:15:05.595
I do not like that all the time you are
complaining about a person

00:15:05.796 --> 00:15:09.588
with whom I’m in connection. You need
not correct that person;

00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:12.479
I’ve told you a hundred times, ‘Don’t
correct that person.’

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:17.108
I know, because I’m in contact, I know
about that person; you don’t know anything.

00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:21.331
I know everything about that person and
I can correct that person.

00:15:21.532 --> 00:15:25.151
But I was surprised, in London also, some
people came and said something - you know -

00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:29.395
funny about others, and I was surprised
that they think I don’t know anything.

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:34.615
I know each and everything. You leave it to
Me. It is not your job to do such things,

00:15:34.816 --> 00:15:41.100
and this is very mediocre approach
to Sahaja Yoga, extremely mediocre.

00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:44.482
And if you are going to be mediocre,
I cannot help it;

00:15:44.683 --> 00:15:47.883
but a day will come you might have to get
out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:48.084 --> 00:15:52.883
This is the first warning I want to give
you, because now we are going

00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:55.977
into a interior of Maharashtra.

00:15:56.178 --> 00:15:59.056
You will see women and men never sit
together in Maharashtra,

00:15:59.257 --> 00:16:03.630
they sit separately, they keep a distance
with them; we must learn those things.

00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:07.546
In the West we are very open people,
it’s all right, you could be open -

00:16:07.747 --> 00:16:12.427
there are methods and ways, how we are
open, how we keep distances.

00:16:12.628 --> 00:16:17.340
Like I’ll be much more free with the son
of Mr. - Dr. Sanghvi,

00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:19.603
but with him I’ll keep a little distance.

00:16:19.804 --> 00:16:24.513
Is a style that, a lady, her elders,
she must keep a distance.

00:16:24.714 --> 00:16:28.813
And a man, must keep a distance from
younger - younger generation.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.691
This is a system by which this country
has worked out its innocence,

00:16:32.892 --> 00:16:35.191
and we all should try to follow this point.

00:16:35.392 --> 00:16:39.624
That keep a distance with the ladies
who are younger to you.

00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:43.652
And keep a distance from the gentlemen
who are older than you.

00:16:43.853 --> 00:16:48.531
Is a - I mean, there even a eighty-year-old
woman marries an eighteen-year-old girl,

00:16:48.732 --> 00:16:52.376
such a confused state of affairs where
you cannot talk of these things.

00:16:52.577 --> 00:16:57.365
But here when we are trying to sort out
our confusions, our mistakes,

00:16:57.566 --> 00:17:01.308
we should try to adhere to certain pattern
which has helped people,

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:06.298
our social life is much better. And to
understand why the social life is better,

00:17:06.499 --> 00:17:10.600
is because of Shri Ganesha’s importance.
Where Shri Ganesha is not there,

00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:14.217
you’ll find even Sahaja Yoga does not
work out.

00:17:14.836 --> 00:17:18.253
Say in the north of India there’s no
Shri Ganesh much worshipped.

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:21.525
So the Muslims came in, if and Shri Ganesha
was there,

00:17:21.726 --> 00:17:25.266
they would have fought the Muslims.
They accepted Islamic culture,

00:17:25.467 --> 00:17:29.004
and when that culture came in from
the Nawabs and all that, licentious people,

00:17:29.205 --> 00:17:31.909
it all trickled down. But not
to that extent,

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:39.084
still I would say that there is a sense
of chastity in people in India,

00:17:39.285 --> 00:17:41.503
and we all should have that sense
of chastity.

00:17:41.704 --> 00:17:45.689
But the most thing is, that in your heart,
in your mind,

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.181
don’t allow funny ideas to come in.
First of all watch what’s in your mind.

00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:55.144
It will give you ideas like, ‘This man is
not good, that man is not good.’

00:17:55.345 --> 00:17:59.259
Just don’t listen to these things, just
listen to yourself,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:04.342
that ‘Where am I?’ ‘What am I doing?’
‘What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?’

00:18:04.543 --> 00:18:10.121
‘My vibrations – are they all right?’ ‘Am I
helping others?’ ‘Where is my attention?’

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:15.006
The attention has to be: ‘What am I doing
with what Mother has given to me?’

00:18:15.207 --> 00:18:19.599
So today is a very great day, we must
all pray to Shri Ganesh

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.175
that He should give His blessings, because
He is the source of joy,

00:18:23.376 --> 00:18:27.007
He is the source of joy. He is Christ,
He is in your heart,

00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:31.846
resides as Spirit, so He is the one,
the innocence you have to achieve.

00:18:32.031 --> 00:18:37.172
And that is the beginning of Shri Krishna –
(She corrects Herself) Shri Ganesha’s being,

00:18:37.357 --> 00:18:45.203
which evolves at the head here, you see
on this [plan?] as Aum it becomes.

00:18:45.372 --> 00:18:50.249
So the same Shri Ganesha ultimately becomes
‘Aum’ within ourselves.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:56.551
So to have the purest form of enjoyment
of your Spirit,

00:18:56.728 --> 00:19:00.988
we must try to see that we establish
our Shri Ganesha.

00:19:01.189 --> 00:19:05.909
And let everyone follow a proper pattern;
you don’t try to correct each other.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.809
That’s a very wrong attitude in Sahaja Yoga

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.606
and it’s very detrimental to the growth
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:15.666
Anybody who tries this is thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga in no time,

00:19:15.867 --> 00:19:21.602
by some way or some other. And also
I have seen people getting cancer.

00:19:21.803 --> 00:19:24.047
And they asked Me: ‘Mother, how is it
we were doing Sahaja Yoga

00:19:24.248 --> 00:19:28.301
and how did we get cancer?’ Because
of this nonsense.

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:33.311
Don’t try to go against other Sahaja Yogis;
must respect, they are all saints.

00:19:33.512 --> 00:19:36.258
And respect the older Sahaja Yogis because
they have been there,

00:19:36.459 --> 00:19:40.737
you have to learn a lot. They have worked
very hard to establish Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:45.767
So I have to make a very simple
announcement today,

00:19:45.968 --> 00:19:50.913
that on this day of Shri Ganesh,
all My children

00:19:51.114 --> 00:19:55.044
who are born like Shri Ganesh only,
in the same pattern,

00:19:55.245 --> 00:20:01.971
should become dynamic like Him, innocent
like Him, great like Him,

00:20:02.172 --> 00:20:07.939
working twenty-four hours - this little
Child is working

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:13.542
throughout the day and night to give you
this source of joy.

00:20:13.743 --> 00:20:16.243
May God bless you all.
