WEBVTT

00:10.540 --> 00:16.847
It is so Sahaj today that the day
of celebration

00:17.048 --> 00:24.343
has fallen onto the birthday
of Shri Ganesh.

00:24.544 --> 00:30.777
Every month they celebrate the fourth day
of the moon

00:30.978 --> 00:39.636
as the birth date of Shri Ganesh,
and today is that date.

00:39.837 --> 00:48.156
Luckily, we are here for the Puja
of Shri Ganesha on His birthday.

00:51.156 --> 00:58.568
I’ve said a lot about Shri Ganesha
and His importance in our life.

00:58.769 --> 01:07.540
He is the giver of wisdom, but this wisdom
comes from our innocence.

01:07.741 --> 01:14.676
Innocence that is innate within us.

01:14.877 --> 01:27.061
As children we are innocent, but as we
grow we start exerting ourselves

01:27.262 --> 01:32.165
in a manner that we start losing
our innocence.

01:32.366 --> 01:39.287
We lose it in two ways; once we have
lost our innocence,

01:39.488 --> 01:43.100
we cannot believe that others
could be innocent.

01:43.301 --> 01:49.984
Another is, that we think innocence
is not important.

01:53.274 --> 02:01.324
Innocence is the sustenance, is the basis
of spirituality.

02:01.525 --> 02:07.903
If a person doesn’t have innocence,
he cannot rise in spirituality.

02:08.104 --> 02:11.562
That’s why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is

02:11.763 --> 02:15.991
to establish Shri Ganesha within you,
to awaken Him.

02:16.192 --> 02:21.887
As soon as the Kundalini awakens, you must
know that Shri Ganesha comes into being.

02:22.088 --> 02:28.288
Without His awakening within you,
Kundalini cannot be raised.

02:28.489 --> 02:34.578
But it could be temporary, or it could
be a permanent thing.

02:34.779 --> 02:40.900
It could be very temporary with people
who are not yet adjusted

02:41.101 --> 02:49.793
to the new method, or to the ways
of God’s love.

02:49.994 --> 02:54.909
Those who have not understood, or those
who have not gone through those traditions,

02:55.110 --> 02:59.641
it is rather difficult for them to establish
Shri Ganesha within them.

02:59.842 --> 03:09.336
At this point I find, there are people
who fight with their problems,

03:09.537 --> 03:15.398
and try to overcome the outward problems,
and establish Shri Ganesha.

03:15.810 --> 03:21.636
But there are other people who are still
not there;

03:21.837 --> 03:26.892
they start doubting others’ innocence.
In Sahaja Yoga is a very common failing.

03:27.093 --> 03:30.233
I have seen people complaining
about others,

03:30.434 --> 03:33.580
saying that their innocence is not
established.

03:33.781 --> 03:37.828
Is the first sign that your own innocence
is in danger.

03:38.029 --> 03:41.542
Because you doubt yourself, you are
doubting others.

03:41.743 --> 03:46.508
If you are doubting others, then be sure
that you are not going to gain anything.

03:46.709 --> 03:50.102
Your job is to look after yourself,
and not others.

03:50.303 --> 03:54.377
And if you start doing like this, gradually
in your Mooladhara,

03:54.538 --> 04:00.598
there will be lots of these bhoots
that will just jump in.

04:00.799 --> 04:06.056
And they’ll give you more ideas and more
ideas of doubting others.

04:06.421 --> 04:10.633
By doubting others, you can never correct
them, and never yourself.

04:10.834 --> 04:18.073
So those people who indulge into this kind
of practices, go away from their innocence.

04:18.274 --> 04:22.606
They try to find out what others are doing,
what are their ways

04:22.807 --> 04:29.373
of using other people in Sahaja Yoga,
for their own purposes.

04:29.574 --> 04:36.489
Or some sort of a funny spy-like attitude,
they develop.

04:36.690 --> 04:40.375
In Sahaja Yoga, you have to only spy
yourself, and not others.

04:40.576 --> 04:43.636
Those who start spying themselves,
criticizing others,

04:43.837 --> 04:46.776
will never rise higher than what you are.

04:46.977 --> 04:50.238
In the beginning, I have seen many
Sahaja Yogis who come,

04:50.439 --> 04:55.843
also try to do this, to criticize others;
this is the sign of their immaturity,

04:56.044 --> 05:04.165
sign of their, also, poor awakening
of their Shri Ganesha.

05:04.371 --> 05:07.709
So those who come for the first time
should be very careful

05:07.910 --> 05:10.306
that still we have to achieve a lot,

05:10.507 --> 05:14.562
and we should not start doubting others,
making remarks about others.

05:14.763 --> 05:22.030
Because in innocence, people can be very,
very simple, very friendly,

05:22.231 --> 05:26.996
but inside their hearts there is no malice,
there’s no filth.

05:27.197 --> 05:31.040
But those who come for the first time
sometimes have the filth within them.

05:31.241 --> 05:35.460
And they see the reflection of their
own filth in other people.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.723
I had gone to a program in Kolhapur,

05:37.924 --> 05:41.153
and you know how your Mother is innocent
and pure -

05:41.354 --> 05:45.153
and a gentleman came and he told Me
that he has a Nabhi problem.

05:45.354 --> 05:49.339
So I said: ‘All right, you put your hand
on My Nabhi’. He put his hand there,

05:49.540 --> 05:53.157
and the women there, who were really
funny women, they said:

05:53.358 --> 05:57.240
‘Why should Mother allow another man
to touch Her knee?’

05:57.441 --> 06:01.660
They could not understand that: ‘How could
anybody touch a lady’s knee?’

06:01.861 --> 06:07.898
But once you are at that level, you don’t
really know that there is bad in it.

06:08.099 --> 06:11.500
And you just say: ‘All right, it’s
all right, you can touch my knee.’

06:11.701 --> 06:15.193
And the fellow got all right with his
trouble with his Nabhi.

06:15.394 --> 06:18.410
So you see, the thing is, if your eyes
are clean,

06:18.611 --> 06:21.976
you can understand what is clean
and what is unclean.

06:22.177 --> 06:27.560
But if your eyes are not clean, you start
seeing something that you want to see.

06:27.761 --> 06:30.757
Or sometimes you see something that
never exists.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.516
So I would request all the new Sahaja Yogis
who are here,

06:34.717 --> 06:39.730
not to criticize the old Sahaja Yogis, and
this is very anti-God activity.

06:39.931 --> 06:45.852
Never say a word about the old Sahaja
Yogis. Because I have heard complaints,

06:46.053 --> 06:48.902
people came and complained to Me.
And I was amazed.

06:49.103 --> 06:54.059
Those who are just now there, how can they
start criticizing other Sahaja Yogis?

06:54.260 --> 06:58.586
That means you are trying to hit
the roots of Sahaja Yoga.

06:58.787 --> 07:01.393
And this is not the way you are going
to help.

07:01.594 --> 07:05.564
So I have to request you, please, look
after your own vibrations,

07:05.765 --> 07:12.342
look after your own ascent, look after what
you have done for Sahaj Yog, and then talk.

07:12.543 --> 07:17.981
Suddenly, if you just enter into Sahaja
Yoga and start criticizing others

07:18.182 --> 07:22.776
about their innocence, you are hitting
the Ganesha at the root of it.

07:22.977 --> 07:26.797
So be careful; of course, you’ll be hit,
no doubt.

07:26.998 --> 07:30.762
And such people, who have done like this,
I have seen, have ended up with cancer.

07:30.963 --> 07:35.142
Because Ganesha is the one, when He gets
angry, the first thing you get is cancer.

07:35.343 --> 07:39.351
So be careful, I’m warning you, don’t try
these tricks anymore.

07:39.552 --> 07:45.898
Try to improve your spirituality, so that
you can enjoy the joy of Shri Ganesha.

07:46.099 --> 07:52.963
This is one side; and the second side is,
that to keep Shri Ganesha intact

07:53.164 --> 07:59.063
we have to have certain maryadas, everybody
must have certain maryadas.

07:59.264 --> 08:02.274
Like that, I would say that I will ask
a lady

08:02.475 --> 08:06.114
to put her hand even up to My heart point
from the front.

08:06.315 --> 08:10.211
But I would not ask a man to do that,
because there is a maryada -

08:10.412 --> 08:13.390
if you are a man, you are not supposed
to touch My front side,

08:13.591 --> 08:17.541
but you can touch My backside. There are
maryadas for everything,

08:17.742 --> 08:22.524
and if you do not observe these maryadas,
or these boundaries,

08:22.725 --> 08:33.026
then you are apt to get out of it, despite
the fact that you are pure.

08:33.227 --> 08:36.258
And you might create a problem
unnecessarily.

08:36.459 --> 08:38.973
I’ll give you a very good example
of Shri Mahavira,

08:39.174 --> 08:42.906
who was the incarnation of Bhairava.

08:43.107 --> 08:47.746
Himself Bhairava took on this work, and to
Bhairava what is cloth? What is dress?

08:47.947 --> 08:53.113
I mean He is a person - to Him the whole
universe is His clothes,

08:53.314 --> 08:56.883
or the whole directions are His clothes,
He is a digambara.

08:57.084 --> 09:02.502
To Him, what does it matter. He is so
innocent. He is absolute innocence Himself.

09:02.703 --> 09:06.026
And the innocence that is destructive,
that will destroy.

09:06.227 --> 09:10.224
Through Him only you get your cancer,
when you start misbehaving.

09:10.425 --> 09:17.549
So it’s such a simple man like Him, in the
sense that He never knew what was impurity,

09:17.750 --> 09:22.474
He didn’t know what sin was. Such
a personality came on this earth

09:22.675 --> 09:27.347
to teach people to be innocent, to be
dharmic, to be good.

09:27.548 --> 09:34.715
Now this one once had to go to some forest

09:34.916 --> 09:40.613
where half of His cloth got caught up
in the bushes.

09:40.814 --> 09:44.832
So He had to cut it off, and He was left
with half of the cloth.

09:45.033 --> 09:51.490
And when He came out on the village
outskirts, He met a person,

09:51.691 --> 09:56.112
who was actually Shri Krishna, who tried
to take His pariksha [ED: means ’test’],

09:56.313 --> 09:59.936
just came there, and He said that:
‘Why should you have any cloth?

10:00.137 --> 10:04.177
There is no need, but I am a human being,
I’ve no clothes on My body.

10:04.378 --> 10:09.122
So You are a God, You are an Incarnation,
so why don’t You give your cloth to Me?’

10:09.323 --> 10:12.579
He said: ‘All right, take it.’ He gave away
the part that was there.

10:12.780 --> 10:17.528
And that’s how, for a very short time,
He was without clothes – very short time.

10:17.729 --> 10:21.875
But that people have exploited, and are
making Him nude,

10:22.076 --> 10:24.969
and making all His private parts
in such details.

10:25.170 --> 10:27.928
All nonsense they are doing. Now many
people ask Me:

10:28.129 --> 10:31.775
‘How is it that Jains indulge into this
nudity and all that?’

10:31.976 --> 10:37.247
This is all absurdity; it’s nothing,
nothing anywhere near Mahavira.

10:37.448 --> 10:41.392
Nobody’s a Mahavira to become even nude,
even for a short time.

10:41.593 --> 10:46.166
So why should they do it? Because
everybody tries to find out

10:46.367 --> 10:52.848
something that is a loophole, just to cover
up their own weaknesses.

10:53.049 --> 10:57.274
And all such weaknesses tell upon
the progenies.

10:57.475 --> 11:02.775
Now that has gone so far, that they cannot
understand that Shri Mahavir –

11:02.976 --> 11:07.833
He was a digambara, He was a person
who did not need any clothes.

11:08.034 --> 11:12.641
Still, just to keep the samayachar, He did
wear His cloth throughout,

11:12.842 --> 11:17.802
and later on also; but for a short time
He gave away His clothes.

11:18.003 --> 11:20.056
That doesn’t mean that in the public
He became nude,

11:20.257 --> 11:23.460
suddenly He took out His clothes and
all that, it doesn’t mean that.

11:23.661 --> 11:29.898
He respected the public and that, not only
but He respected His parents to begin with,

11:30.099 --> 11:34.746
before He took to real sannyasa.
He respected His parents,

11:34.947 --> 11:39.957
and He said that: ‘Now the time has come
for Me to give up this worldly life.

11:40.158 --> 11:46.098
He had - I have been indulging into worldly
affairs, and I have to take to sannyasa’.

11:46.299 --> 11:49.742
Sannyasa doesn’t mean that He was not
a sannyasi, He was – but means

11:49.943 --> 11:54.835
that the worldly life of His parents, and
other people, He had to give up.

11:55.036 --> 11:57.859
Because if you have to indulge sometimes
into this life –

11:58.060 --> 12:03.693
like in the Hindu tradition, after certain
age, say, seventy-five they say,

12:03.894 --> 12:08.483
you have to take a sannyasa, in the sense
that your family, your children,

12:08.684 --> 12:12.278
are settled down now, there’s no problem,
so you have to take a sannyasa.

12:12.479 --> 12:15.646
But for that, the wisdom has to be gathered
in young age;

12:15.853 --> 12:19.399
otherwise, in old age, still there is
no wisdom, and you are behaving

12:19.600 --> 12:24.400
like a young man of sixteen years –
is better you don’t take sannyasa.

12:25.387 --> 12:33.313
So the whole understanding about life
in India has to be very subtle.

12:33.514 --> 12:36.955
And to understand these great and great
people,

12:37.156 --> 12:40.506
you have to be little bit greater than
what you are.

12:40.707 --> 12:46.693
If you are just mud, how can you see
the goal? You cannot.

12:46.894 --> 12:49.163
So you have to remove this mud
from your eyes.

12:49.364 --> 12:54.775
This is a very common feature in the West
that, either they are suspicious,

12:54.976 --> 12:58.620
or they are in it; there’s nothing
in between.

12:59.525 --> 13:02.410
Either the people who are suspicious
of others,

13:02.611 --> 13:08.714
or there are people who are indulging
into it, so have it a middle way.

13:08.915 --> 13:12.453
First thing I have to request, because you
are the first Sahaja Yogis now,

13:12.654 --> 13:16.078
who have come for the first time to India,

13:16.279 --> 13:25.534
that this soil of our country is full
of rhythm of Shri Ganesh.

13:25.735 --> 13:30.560
You are sitting on it; you have to vow
that: ‘I will establish my Ganesha.’

13:30.761 --> 13:33.844
Don’t worry about others, your attention
on others is wrong.

13:34.045 --> 13:38.114
‘I’ll establish my Ganesha, and let this
Mother Earth

13:38.315 --> 13:42.639
give me the full strength to establish
my Shri Ganesh.’

13:42.840 --> 13:48.362
This is very important because, unless and
until your Shri Ganesh is established,

13:48.568 --> 13:54.720
you cannot be connected to the whole, nor
can you have the enjoyment of your Spirit.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.746
You’ll be a half-baked personality,
which you should not be.

13:58.947 --> 14:06.192
So far, I’ve seen that the western Sahaja
Yogis are extremely assiduous.

14:06.393 --> 14:09.425
And they take things very seriously,
they get to it.

14:09.626 --> 14:13.350
Because, they know, if they have to have
joy, they have to work it out.

14:13.551 --> 14:17.646
So you have to be an introvert, as far
as you are concerned.

14:17.847 --> 14:23.380
And as far as others are concerned, you have
to be just seeing the good points of others.

14:23.570 --> 14:26.310
Always see the good points, not the bad
points.

14:26.510 --> 14:28.963
Otherwise you’ll create problems
for yourself,

14:29.164 --> 14:32.024
and a day will come, you’ll have to get
out of Sahaja Yoga.

14:32.225 --> 14:34.997
It has happened with many who tried
these things.

14:35.198 --> 14:38.198
And they are out, absolutely out
of Sahaja Yoga.

14:38.399 --> 14:41.817
If you have to be in Sahaja Yoga, you have
to understand

14:42.018 --> 14:46.409
that, to be one with the whole, try to look
after yourself.

14:46.610 --> 14:51.183
Another thing I have told you that in every
country I have to have somebody

14:51.384 --> 14:54.156
on whom I have to depend. Just like
Shri Ganesha,

14:54.357 --> 14:57.735
I depend on Him for many things;
He looks after many things;

14:57.936 --> 15:02.087
in the same way, in every country, I have
to have somebody there.

15:02.288 --> 15:05.595
I do not like that all the time you are
complaining about a person

15:05.796 --> 15:09.588
with whom I’m in connection. You need
not correct that person;

15:09.789 --> 15:12.479
I’ve told you a hundred times, ‘Don’t
correct that person.’

15:12.679 --> 15:17.108
I know, because I’m in contact, I know
about that person; you don’t know anything.

15:17.309 --> 15:21.331
I know everything about that person and
I can correct that person.

15:21.532 --> 15:25.151
But I was surprised, in London also, some
people came and said something - you know -

15:25.352 --> 15:29.395
funny about others, and I was surprised
that they think I don’t know anything.

15:29.596 --> 15:34.615
I know each and everything. You leave it to
Me. It is not your job to do such things,

15:34.816 --> 15:41.100
and this is very mediocre approach
to Sahaja Yoga, extremely mediocre.

15:41.301 --> 15:44.482
And if you are going to be mediocre,
I cannot help it;

15:44.683 --> 15:47.883
but a day will come you might have to get
out of Sahaja Yoga.

15:48.084 --> 15:52.883
This is the first warning I want to give
you, because now we are going

15:53.084 --> 15:55.977
into a interior of Maharashtra.

15:56.178 --> 15:59.056
You will see women and men never sit
together in Maharashtra,

15:59.257 --> 16:03.630
they sit separately, they keep a distance
with them; we must learn those things.

16:03.831 --> 16:07.546
In the West we are very open people,
it’s all right, you could be open -

16:07.747 --> 16:12.427
there are methods and ways, how we are
open, how we keep distances.

16:12.628 --> 16:17.340
Like I’ll be much more free with the son
of Mr. - Dr. Sanghvi,

16:17.555 --> 16:19.603
but with him I’ll keep a little distance.

16:19.804 --> 16:24.513
Is a style that, a lady, her elders,
she must keep a distance.

16:24.714 --> 16:28.813
And a man, must keep a distance from
younger - younger generation.

16:29.020 --> 16:32.691
This is a system by which this country
has worked out its innocence,

16:32.892 --> 16:35.191
and we all should try to follow this point.

16:35.392 --> 16:39.624
That keep a distance with the ladies
who are younger to you.

16:39.825 --> 16:43.652
And keep a distance from the gentlemen
who are older than you.

16:43.853 --> 16:48.531
Is a - I mean, there even a eighty-year-old
woman marries an eighteen-year-old girl,

16:48.732 --> 16:52.376
such a confused state of affairs where
you cannot talk of these things.

16:52.577 --> 16:57.365
But here when we are trying to sort out
our confusions, our mistakes,

16:57.566 --> 17:01.308
we should try to adhere to certain pattern
which has helped people,

17:01.509 --> 17:06.298
our social life is much better. And to
understand why the social life is better,

17:06.499 --> 17:10.600
is because of Shri Ganesha’s importance.
Where Shri Ganesha is not there,

17:10.801 --> 17:14.217
you’ll find even Sahaja Yoga does not
work out.

17:14.836 --> 17:18.253
Say in the north of India there’s no
Shri Ganesh much worshipped.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.525
So the Muslims came in, if and Shri Ganesha
was there,

17:21.726 --> 17:25.266
they would have fought the Muslims.
They accepted Islamic culture,

17:25.467 --> 17:29.004
and when that culture came in from
the Nawabs and all that, licentious people,

17:29.205 --> 17:31.909
it all trickled down. But not
to that extent,

17:32.110 --> 17:39.084
still I would say that there is a sense
of chastity in people in India,

17:39.285 --> 17:41.503
and we all should have that sense
of chastity.

17:41.704 --> 17:45.689
But the most thing is, that in your heart,
in your mind,

17:45.890 --> 17:50.181
don’t allow funny ideas to come in.
First of all watch what’s in your mind.

17:50.382 --> 17:55.144
It will give you ideas like, ‘This man is
not good, that man is not good.’

17:55.345 --> 17:59.259
Just don’t listen to these things, just
listen to yourself,

17:59.460 --> 18:04.342
that ‘Where am I?’ ‘What am I doing?’
‘What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?’

18:04.543 --> 18:10.121
‘My vibrations – are they all right?’ ‘Am I
helping others?’ ‘Where is my attention?’

18:10.322 --> 18:15.006
The attention has to be: ‘What am I doing
with what Mother has given to me?’

18:15.207 --> 18:19.599
So today is a very great day, we must
all pray to Shri Ganesh

18:19.800 --> 18:23.175
that He should give His blessings, because
He is the source of joy,

18:23.376 --> 18:27.007
He is the source of joy. He is Christ,
He is in your heart,

18:27.208 --> 18:31.846
resides as Spirit, so He is the one,
the innocence you have to achieve.

18:32.031 --> 18:37.172
And that is the beginning of Shri Krishna –
(She corrects Herself) Shri Ganesha’s being,

18:37.357 --> 18:45.203
which evolves at the head here, you see
on this [plan?] as Aum it becomes.

18:45.372 --> 18:50.249
So the same Shri Ganesha ultimately becomes
‘Aum’ within ourselves.

18:50.450 --> 18:56.551
So to have the purest form of enjoyment
of your Spirit,

18:56.728 --> 19:00.988
we must try to see that we establish
our Shri Ganesha.

19:01.189 --> 19:05.909
And let everyone follow a proper pattern;
you don’t try to correct each other.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.809
That’s a very wrong attitude in Sahaja Yoga

19:09.010 --> 19:11.606
and it’s very detrimental to the growth
of Sahaja Yoga.

19:11.775 --> 19:15.666
Anybody who tries this is thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga in no time,

19:15.867 --> 19:21.602
by some way or some other. And also
I have seen people getting cancer.

19:21.803 --> 19:24.047
And they asked Me: ‘Mother, how is it
we were doing Sahaja Yoga

19:24.248 --> 19:28.301
and how did we get cancer?’ Because
of this nonsense.

19:28.502 --> 19:33.311
Don’t try to go against other Sahaja Yogis;
must respect, they are all saints.

19:33.512 --> 19:36.258
And respect the older Sahaja Yogis because
they have been there,

19:36.459 --> 19:40.737
you have to learn a lot. They have worked
very hard to establish Sahaja Yoga.

19:40.946 --> 19:45.767
So I have to make a very simple
announcement today,

19:45.968 --> 19:50.913
that on this day of Shri Ganesh,
all My children

19:51.114 --> 19:55.044
who are born like Shri Ganesh only,
in the same pattern,

19:55.245 --> 20:01.971
should become dynamic like Him, innocent
like Him, great like Him,

20:02.172 --> 20:07.939
working twenty-four hours - this little
Child is working

20:08.140 --> 20:13.542
throughout the day and night to give you
this source of joy.

20:13.743 --> 20:16.243
May God bless you all.
