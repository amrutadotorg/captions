1
-00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:01,420
[missing start]

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:04,780
very anxious that Sahaja Yoga should be established.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,210
And the fourth thing he said that
there is going to be anniversary,

4
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,717
 some fourth anniversary or something, of the U.N.

5
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:13,950
And the gentleman who is in charge is that Muller fellow,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,280
who is already suffering from something,

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,670
and he will definitely need My help.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,960
And he said that they, they are
going to have a spiritual dimension

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,050
to their celebration,

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,660
in which he wants Me to come
and give a lecture to them.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,540
And also he said I should go to UNESCO

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,230
 and give a lecture there

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,390
and also I should go to Senegal to give a
lecture there and to establish Sahaja Yoga.

14
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:41,005
Though he is a Muslim,

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,829
he believes in Sahaja Yoga very ardently.

16
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:45,329
So all good things have come out of him.

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,469
And this gentleman, Mr. Angel, whom I’ve met yesterday

18
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:54,559
was very positive and he said
he will try to get also a..

19
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:58,838
our Rustom here, with whom he will discuss
and other Indians will be discussed

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,608
and we’ll be able to find out something very positive,

21
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,468
 because he got a tremendous
experience of realisation yesterday,

22
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:11,338
that he felt the cool breeze and all
that and he is a man of great learning.

23
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:17,808
And I was very happy that he got
this realization and he was so good.

24
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:26,126
So it seems that we are now about to take
a big leap into a new type of people,

25
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:34,402
who will bring Sahaja Yoga to a much wider
level and that is going to help all of us.

26
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:42,441
At the same time I have to tell you, that we all Sahaja Yogis have to understand certain things, which are very important.

27
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:47,385
Of course, I was very much pleased with the
way you had done this thing and all that.

28
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:48,295
It’s very good.

29
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:52,165
But certain things must be understood very clearly.

30
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:54,705
And one of them was that some people,

31
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:56,645
of course, come to complain to Me also.

32
00:01:56,645 --> 00:02:01,095
You must know that, that they said that
the charges were rather too much for them,

33
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,940
for this programme and that the food was not sufficient

34
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:10,470
and some of them didn’t get sufficient food.

35
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,120
All right, whatever it is.

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,861
so from next time we have to remember that we must keep charges little lower, try to give sufficient food.

37
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:22,361
Then I discovered that I was rather angry

38
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:27,301
with Christine and I told her that, “How
is it that the food was not sufficient?”

39
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,880
Then she said it was a caterer. But you
don’t have caterers; that's not proper.

40
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,690
We shouldn’t have in Sahaja
Yoga any caterers or anything.

41
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,040
There are Sahaja Yogis; they should cook.

42
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,260
That’s the best way. There are so many of us

43
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,314
and we should not arrange with the
caterers because the caterers are,

44
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:49,744
you know, they make their own profits and they are not bothered whether everybody has got food or not.

45
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:53,114
So that should not happen. Next
time we should have a more...

46
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:55,527
I mean, actually I could have cooked for you.

47
00:02:55,557 --> 00:03:02,927
I’m very good at cooking Myself, but I didn’t know there was a caterer or anything.

48
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:09,107
So, this is what one has to see to it, that you should arrange things in such a way.

49
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:17,460
And then another thing I have decided tomorrow to open an account in My name, in one of the banks here.

50
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:22,450
And so that those who have to send
money for next year’s programme

51
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:25,851
should send it there directly, or
they can send it to Christine,

52
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,359
and Christine has to send all that and keep
a receipt of that and she has to tell Me.

53
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,531
This is very important; one must understand.

54
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:38,666
Secondly, I would say that you all should
have all the accounts properly written down.

55
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,801
That is one of the most
important things in Sahaja Yoga.

56
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:44,521
When I asked Christine, “What
about the accounts and all that?”

57
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:47,971
She said that there isn’t any
system like that existing.

58
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:50,331
I said, “That’s something surprising.”

59
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:57,021
Because in London, though whatever it is, you know
that very well, every penny is accounted for.

60
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:03,614
Even I am so meticulous about it, that if I
borrow even twenty p from you or anything,

61
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:06,114
 I return it, see to it, because it haunts Me.

62
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:09,919
And in the same way I think the
accounting is very important.

63
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:14,930
One of the reasons why you suffer from money,
may be, that the accounts are not there.

64
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:23,350
Must keep accounts, because I may not see the accounts,
but I may just have a glance at it and look at it.

65
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:29,070
Actually, I would like to know what sort of
money is coming and what sort of money is going.

66
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,445
It’s important. Is the Lakshmi
tattwa, which you must look after.

67
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:36,725
It’s very important. It’s extremely
important. So next time when I come,

68
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:39,964
anything you do, you must have proper accounts.

69
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,488
And just to show Me. That’s all.

70
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:46,848
I am not going to deal with it, but I must
just see. My glances must be on that,

71
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,878
so that if there is any problem
of the money it can be solved.

72
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:56,175
Like, we did, in North America
was a big mess, I must say.

73
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,175
Last time. It was a very, very big mess,
and the whole thing took so much of money

74
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:07,506
and the way it was wasted, er, we must,
because there was no accounting system.

75
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:14,456
If Patrick was to be put to the account system that, “We have to give account to Mother of every pie and everything that is important.”

76
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:16,762
There he could not have run
away with all that money.

77
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:21,436
And despite that, he was a banker, because he didn’t
know where he was spending, what he was doing.

78
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:27,166
And if you don’t keep that kind of an accounting, saying that, “This is Mother’s accounts,” you see, what will happen?

79
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,256
Money will slip out. You’ll over-spend money.

80
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,356
That’s what exactly happened last time.

81
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:35,396
And this time I don’t want it to be repeated.

82
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,936
This is God’s money; this is His work.

83
00:05:37,936 --> 00:05:42,306
And we have to be very careful
with every paisa that we have.

84
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:44,821
This is a very important thing
which people don’t understand,

85
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:49,496
and I was amazed when Christine told Me she has
no accounts of things and amazed how is it.

86
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:53,044
She is the leader of New York
and she should have kept it.

87
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:56,624
And I’m really sorry that she
had no accounts of anything.

88
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:58,784
 It really surprised Me.

89
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:05,413
How could she do like that? And she knows; she has
lived in London and she knows what is to be done.

90
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:09,033
This is another thing, because I must tell you
all these things, because you should not repeat.

91
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,113
Then another very important
thing I must tell you:

92
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:15,902
I felt yesterday while the Puja was on,

93
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:22,302
I tried to raise your Kundalini. A terrible catch
of a very worst type on the Heart, Vishuddhi,

94
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:27,177
went into the chakra here.

95
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:34,147
Now, that means there were some people
who were not fully Sahaja Yogis.

96
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:36,989
So, it should never be done.

97
00:06:37,007 --> 00:06:39,507
Even in France, they did the same thing.

98
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:45,469
And I told them, “You shouldn’t get half-hearted
people, just who have come for the Puja.

99
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:50,450
If they are friends of somebody or something,
Puja, you have to be very, very cautious.

100
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,760
Because it gives Me pain.” You don’t want to give
Me pain and don’t want to trouble Me, isn’t it?

101
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:58,700
I’ve come here to solve
problems, not to get into these.

102
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:02,103
And it was really so painful
yesterday, you have no idea.

103
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,343
But somehow I managed to take it out.

104
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:10,013
So I would tell you, those people
who are not fully realised

105
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,478
who are not in doubtless awareness,

106
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:15,266
you must not have them for Puja.

107
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,766
It gives Me trouble or they may go off.

108
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:22,123
There was one fellow, I told him not to
come in, in France, and he became crazy.

109
00:07:22,123 --> 00:07:25,493
And then he will go to the jail, he
will go to the people and say

110
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,986
that, “Because of Kundalini Jagruti I got it.”

111
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:31,603
 But to see to awaken
Kundalini is not an easy thing.

112
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:35,433
And when everybody’s Kundalini is
rising, his Kundalini also may rise

113
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:40,038
and may have such a problem that we
cannot solve it. So you be careful.

114
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,033
First of all, you should be really
very, very strict with people

115
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,173
that you should say, “You must all become.

116
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,673
Unless and until you have
become, you cannot come to Puja.”

117
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:50,173
And I tell you, this works much better.

118
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:53,723
Then everybody tries to be that;

119
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,043
everybody tries to race themselves.

120
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,693
That, it’s a competition, sort of
thing, you know, they set into,

121
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,523
and they say, “We must do this.
Otherwise, how can it be?”

122
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,223
So they try to improve.

123
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:08,423
But if you allow right, lovey-dovey
style, it goes on like that.

124
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:14,153
It’s not that. And France, it’s one of them, which
has suffered so much because of this kind of thing.

125
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:18,103
And I find in France then the wave
comes up and suddenly it drops down,

126
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:22,343
again comes up, goes down, because
there are no solid people there.

127
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:26,523
So you have to create really very,
very, very, very solid people.

128
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:29,263
That is important, and Puja
is only meant for them.

129
00:08:29,298 --> 00:08:32,699
Yeah, there may be only five, there
could be only ten; doesn’t matter.

130
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:35,876
Not important to have many people for Puja.

131
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,146
We can have it for programmes. So remember:

132
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,356
I’m telling you very clearly
anywhere. You want to have a Puja,

133
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:46,586
supposing now, say, in, er, San Francisco
or San Diego, you want to have a Puja,

134
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:54,006
anything of even of the photograph, then please do not
admit people to come in, who are not realised fully.

135
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:57,736
Remember that. Never get them. You’ll have trouble, your children will have trouble,

136
00:08:57,766 --> 00:09:01,178
your husbands will have trouble
and their bhoots will get into you.

137
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:08,198
Because they’ll be so frightened as to face it,
that there could be very serious things happen.

138
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:14,664
So remember my words: do not allow people who are
half-hearted, half-baked to come to Sahaja Yoga

139
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:19,118
in a way that is in the inner circle.

140
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:25,268
Sahaja Yoga has three circles, as you know. One
is the periphery, where people come, go, like that.

141
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:28,678
Second circle is where people
come and settling down.

142
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,498
And third one where they are settled down.

143
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:35,463
Only the third one can do the Puja. They only
have the privilege; it’s a special privilege.

144
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,963
Everybody cannot have that privilege. All right?

145
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:41,893
This is one thing, then. Another
thing which really frightened Me was

146
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:45,834
the little child here. He
was very badly caught up.

147
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:53,354
 And now I don’t know why, but I must say
that you must have your vibrations corrected.

148
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:55,854
May be something wrong that how
could you not feel the child.

149
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:59,854
Means he would have gone mad the way
he was. You don’t know how he was.

150
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:02,369
It was very dangerous. It could be with any other child.

151
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:07,324
Why I am telling it openly? That it could
be with any other child that can happen.

152
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:10,676
So be careful about your children. Be very careful.

153
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:14,966
Always feel their vibrations. They,
you see, you are just trustees.

154
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:16,826
They are My children.

155
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:22,811
I was so amazed, I tell you. And he is so aware,
so intelligent and such a great soul like him.

156
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,011
And he was suffering within himself, you see.

157
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:29,501
Not only him; anyone of them could be
like that, anyone of the children.

158
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,081
He’s just an example.

159
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:36,131
It came to My mind yesterday,
and I was really very much upset,

160
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:40,481
very upset, because they
are My children, not yours.

161
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,177
They are in your trust, and nothing
should happen to My children.

162
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,477
Otherwise, I’ll take them away.

163
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:51,667
You have to look after them.
Keep your vibrations all right.

164
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:57,127
Remember that. Never get them. You’ll have
trouble, your children will have trouble,

165
00:10:57,137 --> 00:11:01,487
See how they are. Look after them. It’s
not the responsibility of one person.

166
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,987
 It’s the responsibility of the whole centre.

167
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:07,502
Like, Olympia got lost very much.

168
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:10,988
And I was amazed how she got lost so much.

169
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:15,348
I went to find out what was the reason,
how this child got into this thing.

170
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:19,448
To Olympia, is such a great soul,
and I gave it to Gavin and Jane.

171
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,368
And why this child is lost?

172
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,150
Now Jane is gone out there to learn some Sanskrit.

173
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,590
There was one lady who tried to be
over sort of possessive of Olympia.

174
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,904
 She ruined her completely.

175
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:36,160
So, but one thing about English is
that they all are joined together.

176
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:39,070
All the children are there. They
always see them in the programmes.

177
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,669
They are all the time there. Even if they are running, jumping or doing anything, even sleeping; doesn’t matter.

178
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,509
But they bring the children to the programme.

179
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:48,052
So the children are checked all the time.

180
00:11:48,052 --> 00:11:51,189
And they immediately informed Me about this.

181
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:55,939
And we have now arranged her to go to
some other place, not with the parents,

182
00:11:55,957 --> 00:11:59,479
but she will be staying with somebody
else. So there is no more problem.

183
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,979
You see, you must know it’s very important.

184
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:06,109
Because of their grace, we are getting so many things.

185
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:12,408
They are great souls God has given us. They are great
saints God has given us. We have to respect them

186
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:17,208
We have to allow them to grow in Sahaja Yoga.
They should not be denied any opportunity.

187
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:21,018
They should be brought to the
programmes, they should be tested by you.

188
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:23,518
They should be looked after. They are in your trust.

189
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:27,128
So if something happens, say,
in San Francisco to children,

190
00:12:27,119 --> 00:12:33,128
I will definitely catch hold of someone in
San Francisco, why it has happened to them.

191
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,163
All of you are responsible.

192
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:37,977
It’s not only Judy, who is responsible for her children,

193
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,597
but all of you are responsible for these children.

194
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:43,657
It’s not only that he is responsible for that child,

195
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:46,567
but everybody is responsible for that child.

196
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:52,435
So children are a collective
responsibility; this we must understand.

197
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:57,655
 Otherwise, we’ll be in trouble because
if you do not look after the saints,

198
00:12:57,661 --> 00:13:01,271
God is not going to be happy with us.

199
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:09,441
That is very important for all of you to look after the
children in such a way that’s a collective responsibility.

200
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:12,361
Every child must be looked after.

201
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:18,771
Moreover, in England, after all,
because I’m there, I’m very alert.

202
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:26,692
And sometimes I find it happened even
in Switzerland something like that.

203
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,192
And I was amazed how one child was so caught up.

204
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:33,169
And then we found that the father was
trying to play some tricks with him.

205
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:36,252
And now he might go to jail, his father.

206
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:42,064
But you see, you should be alert. What I am trying
to say is you should be all alert about it.

207
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:45,174
This is your responsibility. This
is your collective responsibility,

208
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:51,224
and I would say that I will hold all of you responsible
if something goes wrong with My children. So be careful.

209
00:13:51,224 --> 00:13:54,653
They cannot suffer. They are not to
suffer. They have to enjoy life.

210
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:56,074
They have to be happy children

211
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,784
and you have to see their needs and things and they
are a collective responsibility all of us have got.

212
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:04,514
They are not the children of the
parents; you must understand that.

213
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:07,468
They are your children, they are My
children, they are everybody’s children,

214
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,970
They are people’s children, they are important things.

215
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,188
Till they are grown up let them be
here, then we’ll arrange their schools.

216
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:15,688
We’ll look after them. They are very precious things,

217
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,368
extremely precious, all right?

218
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:24,842
And this is what I would like to tell you
that no child should suffer in My absence.

219
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:28,032
I was quite disturbed because
he's such a great thing, Scott,

220
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:33,820
he’s such a great thing. First day I came
here I know. I was so happy to meet him.

221
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,340
This is a great personality.

222
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,862
But they should not suffer, you know. They will get
rid of it, but they’ll have to fight it out too much.

223
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:45,621
If you help them, if you are alert, you
should see to whom they are talking,

224
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,390
what they are doing, where
they are going. Keep a watch.

225
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:54,840
Be alert, because everybody is under attack.

226
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,323
All the children are under attack.
All the satanic forces are there.

227
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,877
You must take them to programmes. That’s one
thing you must do, because there it cleanses out.

228
00:15:04,891 --> 00:15:08,947
You should not be afraid of taking them to; even
if they sleep off or anything, doesn’t matter.

229
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:12,987
Take them in sleeping conditions;
doesn’t matter. It’s all right.

230
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:17,817
But they should be there. It works out.
They should be kept always very alert.

231
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:23,237
Then the last thing that I have to tell you,
that all of you must clear out your vibrations.

232
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:25,547
You all should become really sensitive.

233
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:32,889
You should be able to see how much you have improved
in your sensitivity. That’s very important.

234
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,159
You cannot play games with yourself.

235
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,399
 You have to be very sincere. You
all should know how far you are,

236
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,799
how far you are identified with your Spirit.

237
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:50,522
Is very important, because you are yourself,
you are great seekers, of a very great value,

238
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:53,752
 and you should not play about with yourself.

239
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:55,892
Pay full attention to your Spirit.

240
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:58,582
Pay full attention to your sensitivity.

241
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:03,796
How far you are sensitive, how far you can feel
others, how far you can understand others.

242
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:13,684
And if there is somebody you find is rather, er, bit
too much caught up, just tell Me on the photograph.

243
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:15,586
 I’ll look after that person.

244
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:18,169
We’ll try to improve him or improve her.

245
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:21,259
If she does not, then we’ll get rid of her.

246
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:25,926
But don’t get caught up yourself;
don’t get into trouble yourself.

247
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:32,058
You are saints. You are great things. You
are not to suffer anymore. That’s over now.

248
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,991
 Let Me suffer for you. You
don’t have to suffer at all.

249
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:37,281
So you be careful about yourself.

250
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:42,001
Now, know your personality, respect
your Spirit and rise in that.

251
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:48,311
And don’t in any way allow yourself to be
exploited, or to be tortured by anything.

252
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,521
Try to rise.

253
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:52,640
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know,

254
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,631
the time as it passes you become
matured and matured and matured

255
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:03,191
and, and that’s why we have everywhere, I have
appointed somebody as the leader of the thing.

256
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:07,551
One person has to be the leader. I cannot
contact all of you, I’ve said many a time.

257
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:11,361
So now, as we have one leader of every place,

258
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:14,701
let us have everything done through one leader,

259
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,408
because if I have to scold I can only scold
one person. That’s Christine in New York.

260
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:25,034
Or I can scold Danny in one place like
that, or I can scold some Alexander.

261
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:30,263
Now, say, in France they created a
problem for Me this Jean Francois,

262
00:17:30,293 --> 00:17:33,813
you see, he’s another mad cap, I should
say. I don’t know what to call him.

263
00:17:33,813 --> 00:17:38,326
I never said anything to him, because
I don’t know French language

264
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,566
and I don’t know. How will
I speak anything to him?

265
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:44,535
He’s just saying that, “Mother said you are
a great leader. You are this. You are that.”

266
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,361
He’s behaving just like Patrick. Can you imagine?

267
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,451
Why will I say to him that, “You are like this”

268
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:55,333
and if I say, supposing there must
be somebody to translate, isn’t it?

269
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:59,103
But he is self-appointed person
there. I’m getting news about him.

270
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,645
That’s why we've decided not to go to Toulouse.

271
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:05,574
But this kind of a nonsense is
not going to work out at all.

272
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:11,358
This kind of, you cannot use Sahaja Yoga
for money. You cannot use it for power

273
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:13,194
You can only use it for your ascent.

274
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:16,886
Like some people think, “I’ve
become the leader of this.”

275
00:18:16,914 --> 00:18:19,414
How can you become? And, “Mother told me.”

276
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:25,223
Of all the things, I don’t know French,
a word. I know three, four words.

277
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,729
And he doesn’t know English.

278
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:32,018
How will I, how will I tell him
something, which I don’t know,

279
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:37,638
and that nobody knows about I am telling him in
privacy or can I talk in privacy French language?

280
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:46,617
Who is from there? From
Toulouse? Somebody has come? No.

281
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:50,546
No, no, no, nobody from Toulouse.

282
00:18:51,546 --> 00:18:52,956
You are from Toulouse?

283
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:57,869
Now what do you say of him?

284
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:05,227
 It was beautiful because for us
it was a big programme, I mean…And

285
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:05,987
Loudly.

286
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:17,771
 Well, it’s some strange thing because I was going big distance because I have many things and because to get here tonight.

287
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:26,949
Because at last tour I was too remembering for (unclear)

288
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:34,229
And we have things from Paris, we have things
from Toulouse and we didn’t know how to manage

289
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:40,071
and at last, things are at clear tonight. Thank you.

290
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:44,751
But I made it extremely clear,
of course, in English language

291
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:53,395
but I, I made it so very clear that
it is Alexander with whom I deal.

292
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,294
Yes

293
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,794
What do you say, Marie?

294
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:09,040
It was extremely clear, but somehow he managed to work out the contrary as to what You said, and to tell other people.

295
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:13,170
I mean, this sort of a thing you should
refer back to Me. Thank God it is referred.

296
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,820
At least it won’t go too far.

297
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,640
Like, Patrick appointed himself,
self-appointment, the leader of the North America.

298
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,258
Just imagine. And I never knew.

299
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,168
Who told him, I don’t know.

300
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,679
And how much he troubled Me.

301
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,584
So anybody says like that, you refer it to
Me. Please refer it to Me, immediately.

302
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:43,341
And understand that these useless, egoistical
people are trying to be very funny.

303
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:48,241
Let him do what he likes in Toulouse, but you do
exactly what Alexander says, and I’ll see him.

304
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:53,001
I’ll talk to him. He was a
headache, in India, was he not?

305
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:59,527
He was a big headache there and
suddenly now he becomes a leader.

306
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,485
I just don’t know. So please
don’t do all these things.

307
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:09,840
Try to keep one person in charge. I appoint
somebody by understanding that person.

308
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:15,349
Everything I understand, and then I appoint
that person. So don’t challenge Me, please.

309
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,859
None of you should do that. I
would request you not to do this.

310
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:25,129
So for all practical purposes, all North
America should work through Christine.

311
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:34,449
 Christine has to inform Me. I cannot telephone
to all of you. Otherwise, I’ll become bankrupt.

312
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:41,905
If we have every telephone is one leader,
say, then what will happen to Me?

313
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,846
So just keep to one person, all right?

314
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:47,396
Is it all right, Steve? Do you understand that?

315
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:52,685
You refer it to Christine, all of you. Refer it to Christine.

316
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,865
All right? She is the main person here.

317
00:21:56,895 --> 00:22:02,945
And for others who are in their particular
places, like you are there in Boston,

318
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:09,817
or somebody is there in Vancouver, like that,
in every place you have one person in charge.

319
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:12,067
But let her be in charge of all that.

320
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:16,295
I cannot telephone even to San Francisco, to San Diego.

321
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,795
So you must accept it,

322
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,527
because she is the one who came all the
way from there to start Sahaja Yoga.

323
00:22:22,527 --> 00:22:26,259
It is she who started this Sahaja Yoga, isn’t it?

324
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:32,099
Like they told me that one Mr. Arizono
came here and you named the thing at,

325
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,618
he has (unclear: named) even
today that’s how she came here.

326
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:39,369
So I know her. There’s nothing wrong
with her. Her vibrations are good.

327
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:42,729
She’s perfectly all right. She’s very sensitive.

328
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,739
 If I find anything wrong with her I will correct her.

329
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:50,621
Now this is, say, simple plain English
language which I have learned.

330
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:56,694
But you do not read into words now,
anymore. It is simple as that.

331
00:22:56,731 --> 00:23:02,676
I want to make it very clear, because I shouted at her and she was very nervous and she cried and wept and all that; happened.

332
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:06,255
 Doesn’t matter. But I’ve shouted at
her, because she is responsible.

333
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:16,351
She has to assert herself and she has to see and accounts from Boston or from Vancouver should be brought to My notice.

334
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:20,831
They should be sent to India. I would
like to see how you people are managing.

335
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:28,611
So the one account will be for the future plans and
one account should be, you should manage ad hoc.

336
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:34,714
Like you want to have a, say, you want
to have a programme of your own.

337
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:37,034
 For that you want to collect
some money; is all right.

338
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:39,534
But one should never start collections.

339
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:44,324
You know, in India. It’s very common in
the West. In India nobody does that.

340
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:47,744
Very common; we had a horrible time in London.

341
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:52,304
There was one fellow called
Peter Pierce. He came from TM.

342
00:23:52,304 --> 00:23:55,444
And when I went away he
started a Building Account.

343
00:23:55,453 --> 00:24:00,130
I don’t know which building it was. Without
the land, without anything, a Building Account.

344
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:05,726
And he had taken one house, that
Chelsham Road, and he started it.

345
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:12,179
And they collected five thousand pounds, and
no-one knows what happened to that account.

346
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:17,739
He took two thousand pounds from My husband.

347
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:22,039
Can you imagine such a thing? And within
three months’ time when I was in India.

348
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:25,492
 But I don’t know why My
husband trusted him so much.

349
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:31,452
Then everybody gave him five
thousand pounds and two thousand;

350
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:33,972
seven thousand pounds he had nicely with him,

351
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,108
but the result was such that he became bankrupt.

352
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:42,758
And it was such a bad result that the
government asked him to get out of the country

353
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:48,139
and he had to leave the country and now he
is in Africa in a very, very bad state.

354
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:54,169
Whatever he did for seven thousand
pounds has ruined him completely.

355
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:58,209
Imagine; he’s nowhere now.
I mean, he is gone away.

356
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:05,946
His wife and children he lost. Everything he lost. And he’s just all alone there in a very bad shape.

357
00:25:07,655 --> 00:25:10,155
I’ve told you that it is God’s money,

358
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:17,186
 and these are saints. You cannot collect out of
saints something and spend it the way you like.

359
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:20,456
 Ravanna used to do that way, and
you know what happened to Ravanna.

360
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:24,666
So one should never, because I do not take money.

361
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:29,096
That doesn’t mean that anybody should collect
money like that; seven thousands pounds...

362
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,627
Danny knows all about it.

363
00:25:33,477 --> 00:25:35,136
It’s very wrong.

364
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:39,415
You understand that this is God’s work.

365
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:42,335
 And you cannot do anything like that.

366
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:45,655
This is very important. Otherwise,
money problem will never be solved.

367
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,725
It will never be solved. For
the time being you might feel,

368
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:51,763
but then everything will be wasted.

369
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,301
So be careful on that; be very careful.

370
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:56,801
You have to be honest people.

371
00:25:56,801 --> 00:26:01,383
Just now that Doudoudiem was telling Me
that in Sudan they are having a shariat

372
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:07,475
that anybody steals even a, say,
a fruit, they cut the hands.

373
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:09,585
In Sudan; just imagine!

374
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:15,652
Now we don’t want that kind of a thing to happen here,
that people should cut anybody’s hands or anything.

375
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:23,226
But it is a serious thing, because this
is God’s money; this is God’s work.

376
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:28,499
Has to be done with that
understanding and dedication.

377
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:38,202
Every paisa that was collected for even Indian tour
was recorded, put into things, every bit of it.

378
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:43,712
Yes, I’ll just have that little one.
All right? And thank you, thank you all.

379
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:48,034
But I think I speak for everyone here
that everyone will support Christine.

380
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,564
And I would think everyone here feels the same,

381
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:54,919
that she’s the ideal choice to be
the leader of America, North America.

382
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:59,429
Thank you, thank you very
much, thank you, thank you.

383
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:09,239
And you don’t judge your leaders. Let
Me judge them. All right? Just let Me.

384
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:14,089
Try to, try to understand that our, most
of the instructions are coming from Me.

385
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:18,415
Because I shout at her and
she looks at Me like this.

386
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:22,905
So I said, “What are you doing?
Why are you not strong?

387
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:28,196
(Break in this version of the talk. Recommences as She Mataji is talking about photography.)  Horrible!

388
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:34,874
But must be something special about you
people, that you handle this subject like that.

389
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:39,744
 Like today, you see, in the shop, the lady
said, “Oh, You, You had come with Your husband.”

390
00:27:39,744 --> 00:27:42,744
And I said, “Which one?”

391
00:27:44,524 --> 00:27:48,834
And that was Raja, Rajabhai Modi. I said,
“That’s My son. What are you meaning?”

392
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:55,654
 Imagine, what age I must have looked.

393
00:27:55,678 --> 00:28:01,024
 Just imagine. I was wondering what, what camera
she must have used to create such a nonsense.

394
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:05,016
Very nice lady, very nice.

395
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,380
Camera is Mahamaya.

396
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,880
(Shri Mataji unwraps a present.)

397
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,310
Lotus in a lotus.

398
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:29,575
Is it American made?

399
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:32,103
I don’t know Mother, I don’t know.

400
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:39,103
I see all that.

401
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,619
But is it made in America, no?

402
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:49,100
 I must see that because......

403
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:53,430
Yes, beautiful. I would like to
see what porcelain Americans make.

404
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:57,839
Nothing there.

405
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:00,353
Beautiful porcelain, isn’t it?

406
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:10,052
What an idea. It’s really beautiful porcelain.

407
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:18,857
Because in the shops you don’t find
any American porcelain anywhere.

408
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,517
It’s all Chinese or something.

409
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,040
So I wanted to know.

410
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,380
But I didn’t find any American porcelain anywhere.

411
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,880
I think they are not very much interested.

412
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:39,028
Nor did I find any crystal, American crystal.

413
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:43,611
 I don’t think they make any. Do they?

414
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:53,132
I don’t think so, Mother. I think most of Americans buy
Waterford crystal, made by the Irish, German, Yugoslav.

415
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,391
They don’t have any crystal, no?

416
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,991
And the, and the, this also,

417
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:05,050
this they don’t make. But the, the
crockery you use, is from where?

418
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,660
Mainly crockery that the most
people like is English.

419
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:13,922
There are all kinds of Royal
Doulton, all that kind of thing.

420
00:30:13,952 --> 00:30:18,512
Americans, there are also some china,
but I really don’t know so much of that.

421
00:30:21,992 --> 00:30:26,938
I mean, they never had this in America?

422
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:30,428
So what other hand-made things they do?

423
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,954
I mean before they started this.

424
00:30:32,954 --> 00:30:35,454
They must be doing some handwork.

425
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,738
Woodwork?

426
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:45,236
That, that’s all right, that’s,
they are not Americans, in a way.

427
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:48,770
But to what handwork they
must have done before.

428
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,120
Can you say?

429
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,766
Good carpenters, Mother. They are good carpenters
and they make nice interiors of houses,

430
00:30:55,782 --> 00:31:02,501
wood houses, wood floors, cupboards.
But they, they made a lot of …

431
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:05,032
No, but I mean in decorativeness.

432
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,129
What do you say?

433
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:09,659
In decorativeness, what
Americans have been making?

434
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,949
Sculptures.

435
00:31:10,949 --> 00:31:12,179
Sculptures?

436
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,439
Yes, all plastic, Mother.

437
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,739
No, but in olden days they must be making.

438
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:17,666
Jewellery?

439
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:19,839
Jewellery, they are best in the world.

440
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,339
Is it?

441
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,999
Yes, Mother. They are the
best in the world, Mother.

442
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:28,169
Their designs are, they have the most
designs; Cartier, New York.

443
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:29,139
 Is it?

444
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:30,649
Excellent jewellers.

445
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:33,149
I didn’t find anywhere.

446
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:42,469
Mother, we have to go in the market. We have
to do the market. It’s not far from the hall.

447
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:45,029
No, no, what I am saying before all this started.

448
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:50,197
Yes. Beautiful, exquisite [unclear]
glass stone You will find there.

449
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:53,742
Glass made.

450
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:56,392
Crockery they make? What, which one?

451
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:57,442
They made before.

452
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:58,432
Before, yeah

453
00:31:58,432 --> 00:32:09,168
And even now there are good potters, but they have a choice between making special things, which they have to get as it is very expensive.

454
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:12,209
Oh, hand-made must be expensive here, isn’t it?

455
00:32:12,228 --> 00:32:19,679
But there isn’t anything like in India or in Mexico where good quality things are available. (unclear)

456
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:23,899
And the weaving they must
be doing in the olden days?

457
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:31,169
You remember, Christine, you sent Me one, you’ve
seen… But that’s not American? That is Mexican.

458
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:37,774
Yes. Just American china. American
china and I haven’t mentioned that.

459
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:40,279
American china is there?

460
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:42,769
In silver?

461
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:45,269
Old silver, yes.

462
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:47,844
Old silver what?

463
00:32:47,844 --> 00:32:50,344
 Old silver [unclear] in America [unclear].

464
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:55,922
But there’s no demand for any.

465
00:32:55,922 --> 00:32:56,558
What?

466
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,921
There’s no demand for any. The masses
don’t demand it so there is no profit in it.

467
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:03,021
I didn’t follow.

468
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:08,971
Not enough demand for it, Mother, not enough people
want it. So they don’t produce too much of it anymore.

469
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,001
What is that?

470
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:17,361
The... you know, aesthetic, [unclear] things like
that. The average person simply can’t afford it.

471
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:19,907
But what is that they produce actually?

472
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:24,970
OK, although they do produce a lot of things [but
I think], they do heavy machinery production.

473
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:31,890
And there’s, there’s not much that goes into the
household items, so much imported, that is in plastic.

474
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:35,220
But not on these finer things, I think.

475
00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:37,719
(unclear)

476
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:59,410
Only in Toledo I found they were
making beautiful glass things,

477
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:05,040
beautiful bells of glass and all
that, hand things, hand-made, Toledo.

478
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:09,240
 Tiffan was the name of the place
where I went. It’s a village like...

479
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,968
Murano.

480
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:14,086
And I was really surprised how
they were moulding into things

481
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:17,768
and beautiful things they
were making out of glass.

482
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:19,869
Very nice.

483
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:23,849
Like bangles not there, but
something like this kind.

484
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:36,757
So there must have been lots of things of that kind here, because industrial development took much late, isn’t it?

485
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:40,409
It came much later in life.

486
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:48,647
So they must have lived with, you see, some
sort of plates and things must have had.

487
00:34:59,574 --> 00:35:02,074
Oven thing.

488
00:35:06,086 --> 00:35:08,586
But that, too, was made in Poland.

489
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:11,086
I’ll try next time.

490
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:16,059
It’s like, you know, you want to
see something made in America.

491
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:18,019
You don’t find anything.

492
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:25,109
But if we are looking then in the assembly line which
is, was the, the exploiter of the mass production.

493
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:28,769
So we moved away from the er what
we would call cottage industry.

494
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:34,038
No, but sort of, we want to have,
say, something made in here.

495
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,167
Eh? What she’s saying?

496
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,048
They make blue jeans.

497
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:42,548
They make blue jeans here.

498
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,558
Blue jeans.

499
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:49,018
The American hand-made things.

500
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:50,569
 Blue jeans?

501
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,139
 The Americans have no taste.

502
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:53,439
Americans what?

503
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:54,789
They have no taste.

504
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:58,159
I think they are the greatest,
that's why you are all existing.

505
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:08,036
They buy from all over the world. You
don’t know, you get Chinese goods here.

506
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,626
Every sort of good you can get in America
where you cannot find it anywhere.

507
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:17,968
All the best things there. I've even bought
all the old things from all over the world.

508
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,268
I mean, they have a good taste, no doubt.

509
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:23,448
They are the ones who got
the sense of antiques also.

510
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,948
They are the ones who introduced
this idea of antique.

511
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:31,332
I wouldn’t say that, but what I am
saying that there should be something.

512
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,442
Why I am asking you this question is this:

513
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,370
everything I say has something behind it.

514
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:46,517
Now you tell Me why. Let’s see how
far you understand Your Mother.

515
00:36:46,517 --> 00:36:51,031
Course we should be, we should be doing
something. We should be making handicrafts.

516
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,311
What is needed…

517
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,861
No, no.

518
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,361
To create the beauty.

519
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:57,461
Not that. No, no.

520
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:02,562
Some sort of enterprise that
Sahaja Yogis can do together? So

521
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:05,091
You are very near.

522
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:10,362
You see, why I am saying so…

523
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:13,272
First I was thinking that we’ll come to America.

524
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:17,832
We’ll propagate; it will work out
very well, Sahaja Yoga, this, that.

525
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:22,332
But I found the people, you see, they get realisation;
then they are finished. They are no more there.

526
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:26,514
They do not take it that seriously.
They become frivolous or thing.

527
00:37:26,514 --> 00:37:30,027
So how to settle them down? Because
the environment is very bad;

528
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:35,260
environment is so bad that everything fizzles
out, you see; everything sort of fritters away.

529
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:38,457
Everything. I mean, the
seriousness of it goes away.

530
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:43,627
 People just try to play with Sahaja Yoga, little
bit here and there. They don’t take it seriously.

531
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:47,015
So I thought of a plan which
I’ve told you before also,

532
00:37:47,044 --> 00:37:55,442
that in a big land in India, I was thinking of
starting a school for teaching them Indian crafts.

533
00:37:57,982 --> 00:38:02,652
And that for that, whatever you are
not making here, we can make there.

534
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:06,269
But now I find that you are making nothing. So…

535
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:19,232
So I was thinking of inviting people
from America to come down there,

536
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:22,522
settle down there for three months
and learn a particular craft.

537
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:25,034
We can have about twenty-one
crafts I've found out,

538
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:33,134
which are very, absolutely very, very Indian crafts and old crafts, and they can be taught very easily.

539
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:35,233
Within three months you can pick up the craft.

540
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:40,233
But by that, learning by that, you
won’t be able to do it yourself

541
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,715
 because it’s a, it’s, er,
labour, it’s very expensive here.

542
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:47,775
But what you can do is that,
supposing you like something,

543
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:52,395
and now you have, now for
example this piece of silk.

544
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:57,441
Now to get it in the market it’s
easy that you go and get it.

545
00:38:57,451 --> 00:39:05,967
But supposing you know the craft, then you can precisely say what sort of a thing you would like to have to sell it.

546
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:09,154
So you might have something
very unique things to suggest.

547
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:12,676
Because Indians whatever they will
send you whatever they have.

548
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:17,756
But your style, what you want
to have or what is you like,

549
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:22,796
whatever you will be using that only
if you know the craft you can... Yes.

550
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:25,852
Mother, Radha was having an idea,

551
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:33,712
because there is good leather in India which
is imported in form of raw material [unclear].

552
00:39:33,723 --> 00:39:40,567
Theoretically, tradition of leather was here in this country, and there’s definitely a market for it also.

553
00:39:40,564 --> 00:39:43,757
That is just an idea.

554
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:46,267
I mean, you want to export.

555
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:51,987
You see, all such handmade things from
here cannot fetch you much money,

556
00:39:51,987 --> 00:39:54,787
because the reason is, it is very expensive.

557
00:39:54,804 --> 00:39:58,544
But you can get it, cheaper things
from other countries, like Taiwan,

558
00:39:58,544 --> 00:40:01,044
 this, that, is sending to you, but cheapish stuff.

559
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:03,814
But from India you can get genuine, good things.

560
00:40:03,814 --> 00:40:06,014
That’s what I am talking about.

561
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:07,034
Leather work.

562
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:16,894
Leather work from India, made in USA. For the
American market. That’s what I am talking about.

563
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:22,022
But that is the taste part of it you
can tell us if you know the craft,

564
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:23,592
isn’t it?

565
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:30,332
If you don’t know the craft little bit, at least, you
won’t be able to exactly say or design it and say.

566
00:40:30,332 --> 00:40:34,742
Another thing says, Indian furniture or
something, it’s quite good, hand-made.

567
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:40,858
Now if we send you the parts of the furniture,
if you know the craft, you can assemble it.

568
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:43,382
it would be much cheaper to send it here.

569
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:46,542
(short break)

570
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,388
country, which you can first of all what I
would suggest that you must learn the craft,

571
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:57,488
little bit, to understand what can be done.
Supposing now this is the thing in pieces.

572
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:04,698
Now you should know in this what we can do,
how far can we go, what colours we can use.

573
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:09,254
And then you exactly tell that
this is what we have to do.

574
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,758
Then the people can do it.
Then you can sell them here.

575
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:17,833
But Sahaja Yoga should never be
involved with any, any business.

576
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:22,743
I hope it is clear. No business should
be done under the name of Sahaja Yoga.

577
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:29,562
Hah, you can have your own cooperative
or anything between yourselves,

578
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:36,773
but never, never use Sahaja Yoga, the
name, My name or anything for any business.

579
00:41:36,783 --> 00:41:39,893
 Sahaja Yoga is doing no business at all.

580
00:41:39,893 --> 00:41:50,973
But by this kind of a thing, we’ll generate a better taste,
better aesthetics, better living standards in this country.

581
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:55,161
So I would suggest that when
we start this programme,

582
00:41:57,463 --> 00:42:03,511
I have to also get one more “Yes”
from you, because you are Americans.

583
00:42:03,511 --> 00:42:10,002
And I think if that happens I will say that this,
My programme, has really reached its climax,

584
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:13,332
because that’s one of the things
I wanted to know from you.

585
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:17,828
That when we have that place done,

586
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,548
I didn’t want to have it into cement and all that,

587
00:42:21,555 --> 00:42:29,952
to make cement houses and all, but I wanted to make it
into ethnic style of huts, but comfortable and clean.

588
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:31,752
What do you say?

589
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,257
Yes. Yes Mother.

590
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:46,543
That’s good. Then that can be
done very easily, very soon.

591
00:42:46,568 --> 00:42:51,703
And we can start it this year, of course not, but
maybe next year we might start that kind of a school.

592
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:56,603
We have already got teachers, we’ve got
everything and we’ve got land also.

593
00:42:56,636 --> 00:43:03,596
Can you imagine? And the land will be near some river
where you can jump into it every day, every minute.

594
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:15,341
That would be nice near a river. We should have
a big place where you all can enjoy yourself.

595
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:19,621
Anything else? Any other suggestion?

596
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:23,201
Cooking classes.

597
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,791
Yes, Indian cooking. We would
like to know Indian cooking.

598
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:31,281
 One of them is that. There are twenty-one crafts.

599
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:36,093
Indian cooking, Indian sewing.

600
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:42,673
Sewing also. Embroidery, then housekeeping.

601
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:54,165
 Husband management.

602
00:44:04,254 --> 00:44:08,565
How Indian women manage their husbands!

603
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:11,084
Without arguing, without fighting.

604
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:14,965
The husbands, just, you see,
never allow them to cook.

605
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:22,405
No cooking will be allowed to be learned by men.

606
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:32,340
So the women will know only the cooking and
men will have to come home to have their food.

607
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:45,394
That’s how we manage our husbands.

608
00:44:45,431 --> 00:44:49,004
Best way to manage your husband is
through his stomach and tongue.

609
00:44:51,284 --> 00:44:54,625
Every man is a child as
far as this is concerned.

610
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,125
Children marketing, Mother.

611
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:01,944
Children. They are all children as
far as food is concerned, you see.

612
00:45:01,953 --> 00:45:07,328
So, if you know how to make Indian food, I tell you
there are so many permutations and combinations,

613
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:12,014
that they look forward. You see, every day
you don’t have the same stuff in India.

614
00:45:12,034 --> 00:45:18,674
The repetition may come after two, three days or
maybe after two, three years if you are an expert cook.

615
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:20,252
It’s like that.

616
00:45:22,078 --> 00:45:29,787
So… and decorations of the
house, everything we’ll have it.

617
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,291
Like stone carving.

618
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:39,651
Stone carving, wood carving, ivory
carving and there are other carving also.

619
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:47,235
We have what you call, yes, this is a
silversmith, goldsmith, that is there.

620
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:53,630
And also weaving, weaving of different types.

621
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,635
What else? There are twenty-one,
we found out, which are very easy.

622
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:00,578
What about painting?

623
00:46:00,578 --> 00:46:01,438
Aaaa?

624
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:02,878
What about painting?

625
00:46:02,874 --> 00:46:04,308
Painting.

626
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,928
In the village I think it’s called
Madhubani, if I’m pronouncing that correctly.

627
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:10,333
I beg your pardon.

628
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:19,987
Madhubani, I’ve read in a book about a village or area
in India where almost all of the women learn to paint.

629
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:21,727
Oh, that’s in the north.

630
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:25,953
Yes, I gave you paintings out of
that. You didn’t get the paintings?

631
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:28,474
 Those who got married, in their house, there?

632
00:46:28,474 --> 00:46:29,363
You have one?

633
00:46:29,363 --> 00:46:34,013
We have one, somewhere. You have given Daniel
one, I think. We have it, here. I’ll show them.

634
00:46:34,046 --> 00:46:40,073
 Yes, I see. We have, the whole village
will be doing carving of the wood.

635
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:42,433
Then one village will be doing the inlay work,

636
00:46:42,423 --> 00:46:44,923
one village will be doing painting work, like that.

637
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:46,813
We can do that.

638
00:46:46,813 --> 00:46:51,663
That’s something very, very
remarkable that painting business.

639
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:56,091
Not one village but quite many.

640
00:46:57,977 --> 00:46:59,301
Madhubani,

641
00:47:00,357 --> 00:47:08,203
Madhubani painting, yes. And then also
this, what you call knitting and cane work.

642
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:10,517
Oh, beautiful!

643
00:47:10,517 --> 00:47:13,017
Canework,

644
00:47:13,017 --> 00:47:18,972
canework and making mattresses, chatais,
what you call, mats, and things like that.

645
00:47:19,015 --> 00:47:21,515
Canework; that all can do.

646
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:30,017
inlay work, inlay work, inlay in wood, inlay
in under stone, inlay; all that you can learn.

647
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:36,304
Could be many things, much many more like the,
you see, these things also we make very well,

648
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:37,864
very decorative.

649
00:47:37,886 --> 00:47:40,984
Mandapas, we call them.
Extremely beautiful, they are.

650
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,484
Very well done.

651
00:47:45,984 --> 00:47:48,484
Also many things we can learn it.

652
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:58,143
Silver is very, very, nice, but in India they
don’t make silver utensils out of sheets.

653
00:47:58,163 --> 00:48:02,048
They make it out of, what you
call them, aaa....

654
00:48:03,785 --> 00:48:04,438
 I don't know.

655
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:06,228
moulded, moulded one.

656
00:48:06,246 --> 00:48:09,043
I’ll have the tea I think.
it has gone cold or not?

657
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:12,400
It is moulded.

658
00:48:12,408 --> 00:48:13,740
 And wax.

659
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:14,743
Wax work?

660
00:48:14,743 --> 00:48:18,330
And in wax and then they melt it like for the casting.

661
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,634
Casting.

662
00:48:19,634 --> 00:48:24,862
And also, they do wax work
on the saris and clothes.

663
00:48:26,412 --> 00:48:29,114
That’s very… what they are called? Batik.

664
00:48:30,422 --> 00:48:32,542
They do a batik also on the leather work.

665
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:35,942
Leather work, batik, very
beautiful leather. Batik work.

666
00:48:35,942 --> 00:48:41,012
But only thing is when you will be there you will be
as it is that the American taste, as he’s saying.

667
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:43,547
We’ll have something with the American taste.

668
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:49,919
Then we are very good at doing certain
things which are very, very expensive here;

669
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:59,418
 is making frames out of
silver, gold, out of, er, horn.

670
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:02,581
Horn, we are very good at horn carvings.

671
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:05,872
Out of horn you can make
so many things in India

672
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:09,349
And then this metal work,

673
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,489
brass.

674
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,949
 All kinds of brass work. Glass work!

675
00:49:14,946 --> 00:49:20,186
We have tremendous glass and
our crockery also is very good now.

676
00:49:20,186 --> 00:49:24,176
 Our crockery is now being exported to Russia.

677
00:49:24,201 --> 00:49:27,476
And also our crystal.

678
00:49:29,877 --> 00:49:35,920
Then we have, what you call, all kinds of
glass work; beautiful glass work we have.

679
00:49:36,928 --> 00:49:40,030
Beautiful animals and things
they make, beautiful.

680
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:49,928
(Shri Mataji is shown something.)

681
00:49:50,964 --> 00:49:51,788
How did you get it?

682
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:55,025
I don’t know. I just find
it somehow and it’s there.

683
00:49:57,906 --> 00:50:00,406
Yes, they are very different, aren’t they?

684
00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:08,583
She doesn’t want to leave you.

685
00:50:14,671 --> 00:50:15,661
Shanti.

686
00:50:15,673 --> 00:50:18,173
Is she still with Me or with You?

687
00:50:18,173 --> 00:50:20,673
Somewhere.

688
00:50:21,112 --> 00:50:22,302
Shanti.

689
00:50:28,452 --> 00:50:31,735
Then also we have our temples.

690
00:50:31,785 --> 00:50:34,885
How we make our temples, it’s
very interesting, you know.

691
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:36,595
We remember that, its
stone carving, Mother.

692
00:50:36,628 --> 00:50:40,763
Stone carving. No,
that’s you carve stones.

693
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:48,413
Then the carved stones are put in such a way that they, the complete pillar is made, you see, out of that.

694
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:50,433
But that is also very big art.

695
00:50:50,453 --> 00:50:58,829
Sometimes the carved stones are such that you cannot make out whether it is one stone or there are many pieces.

696
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:00,869
They are great.

697
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:04,429
So we can learn so we can
make some temples here.

698
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:08,099
Yes, you can, you can have.

699
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:15,086
But what I would say that, it would be better that you, you learn it and tell them what do you want, you see.

700
00:51:15,086 --> 00:51:18,981
Like now we have lot of
carving, but say, Greek style.

701
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:22,746
Or something, you have
four dimensional things.

702
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:27,361
That they don’t do. You can tell them, “We
want four dimensional.” They can do it.

703
00:51:27,365 --> 00:51:30,741
Work it out on stone or marble,
anything you want to do.

704
00:51:32,046 --> 00:51:33,454
And toy making.

705
00:51:33,544 --> 00:51:34,674
What about mirror work?

706
00:51:34,685 --> 00:51:35,254
I beg your pardon.

707
00:51:35,254 --> 00:51:35,764
Mirror.

708
00:51:35,764 --> 00:51:39,284
Mirror work? Quite a lot. That’s
in embroidery and all that.

709
00:51:39,287 --> 00:51:40,017
And also...

710
00:51:40,017 --> 00:51:43,027
Oh Mother, I don’t know, elephant and
things we can hang on Christmas tree

711
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:45,277
Yes, yes. That is, that is made there.

712
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:48,487
That’s quite a lot; that’s
quite a lot you can do.

713
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:53,300
Plus you see what they do, it is a mirror
work on the clothes and things like that,

714
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:54,865
that also quite a lot.

715
00:51:54,865 --> 00:51:57,365
There is the whole country is
doing it;

716
00:51:58,425 --> 00:52:03,475
the whole country is. You won’t
know how, where to stop it.

717
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,585
We make the beautiful
Ganapatis and all other things.

718
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:15,680
Especially from Nagpur from where I
come, they make the best Ganapatis.

719
00:52:15,706 --> 00:52:23,084
There’s a kind of a... Now here this clay that
you use so expensive; in India is very cheap.

720
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:26,764
Only thing we do not have proper firing.

721
00:52:26,764 --> 00:52:34,754
But we have crockery; we have got,
what you call that, er, porcelain,

722
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:38,367
kind of a porcelain, beautiful.

723
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:41,827
And we have ceramics; all
these three things we have.

724
00:52:41,832 --> 00:52:45,927
But they are to be properly understood
in Indian style. It’s very different.

725
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:50,385
Like I went to Japan. I said, “I want
to, I’ve come to see some ceramics.”

726
00:52:50,415 --> 00:52:55,315
I went to one place where they were
making some ceramics with their hands.

727
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:57,685
So they said, “Here they are all on leave.”

728
00:52:57,685 --> 00:53:02,915
I said, “Really? They are on holidays?” They said, “No, no, they have now gone to India to learn ceramics.”

729
00:53:02,938 --> 00:53:07,315
So I looked at them. I said,
“From where do you learn?”

730
00:53:07,324 --> 00:53:09,975
Then they told Me the place
from where they learn

731
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:12,514
and that place is so close
to My husband’s place.

732
00:53:12,514 --> 00:53:15,706
When I went there I went to
see that, and it was there.

733
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:24,636
 Like that, so many, because, you see, we
haven’t got machinery so we, our hands work out.

734
00:53:24,636 --> 00:53:32,268
Kashmir work is, papier-mâché
work is so much, so much.

735
00:53:35,138 --> 00:53:39,510
There’s no end to it. Everything
they use it for making.

736
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:42,838
They never allow any lines to go straight.

737
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,990
It has to be worked out into something.

738
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,446
Out of these also they make tent, tent things.

739
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:56,376
But you see, that is how one should live
with the matter, to make it beautiful,

740
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,415
and that can be brought
here for no money at all,

741
00:54:01,435 --> 00:54:06,875
quite cheaply, compared to these people are
making so much money and they have no taste also.

742
00:54:06,915 --> 00:54:14,455
But if you can get something like that, you can sell it for
a cheap price and people will have better taste to live.

743
00:54:14,475 --> 00:54:26,482
There I have been investigating it, the import
laws, and they are rather strict in this country.

744
00:54:26,482 --> 00:54:32,728
I’m not sure what they would consider, if they would consider things that are in pieces coming from another country

745
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,878
(unclear)

746
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,438
Certainly four things are heavily tariffed and controlled.

747
00:54:41,462 --> 00:54:43,962
So there is, export is high.

748
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:48,833
(Unclear) If hand-made, is a labour by the
country which [unclear] no taxes at all.

749
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:52,143
You see, if it is hand-made
in America, no problem.

750
00:54:52,153 --> 00:54:53,683
No tariff at all. True.

751
00:54:53,683 --> 00:54:56,893
You see, if it is hand-made, even
in England you’ll be surprised,

752
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:01,815
such a conservative country.
If it is hand-made, nothing.

753
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:05,455
You see, they want to enrich their country
because they don’t have hand-made things.

754
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:08,815
Ha, for other things they do it.

755
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:14,675
Not only that, but anything that is more than
hundred years it’s absolutely free of cost.

756
00:55:14,675 --> 00:55:17,945
Anything hand-made!

757
00:55:17,955 --> 00:55:21,586
You just find out; you’ll be amazed.

758
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:25,046
Otherwise, you will have
no hand-made things here.

759
00:55:27,578 --> 00:55:30,078
We’ll be all moving in plastic bags.

760
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:37,538
Horrible! Horrible picture!

761
00:55:37,538 --> 00:55:43,858
To change all that, to bring in Sahaja Yoga, we have
to have natural things, beautiful things around us.

762
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:47,392
And it’s very simple to do,
to get all these things here.

763
00:55:47,392 --> 00:55:49,876
But also then their taste will develop.

764
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,375
People will think more.
You see, you have brains,

765
00:55:52,375 --> 00:56:00,715
you have better aesthetics and you can suggest
better things which Indians may not have.

766
00:56:00,715 --> 00:56:03,215
But that you can suggest and get things;

767
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:04,295
Knitted!

768
00:56:04,305 --> 00:56:11,344
Knitted, hand-knitted clothes, hand-knitted
shirts, hand-knitted things, you can get very well.

769
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:16,024
Cotton, beautiful cotton!

770
00:56:16,048 --> 00:56:22,364
Now here you get very good cotton, but that cotton
is to be stitched into proper dresses and things.

771
00:56:22,394 --> 00:56:23,474
Children’s wear.

772
00:56:23,474 --> 00:56:26,384
Children’s wear? Oh, beautiful children!

773
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:31,274
We have one lady, she’s making such
beautiful children’s wear, Mrs Nigham,

774
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:36,820
but she says, “The market here is so
great that we don’t want to export it.”

775
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:44,770
Just imagine. But now supposing, I mean, if
there are some people like you help her out,

776
00:56:44,774 --> 00:56:49,660
then she might give you something for export.
For she makes.... she says she has no time.

777
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,676
Many people have stopped exporting.

778
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:54,207
The market is so great in India itself.

779
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:56,901
Handicrafts!

780
00:57:01,883 --> 00:57:05,121
And you can give lots of
suggestions, lots of suggestions.

781
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:09,822
 Like, say, now you have got this brass.

782
00:57:09,832 --> 00:57:11,722
Now, how to keep it shining all the time?

783
00:57:11,722 --> 00:57:15,152
You might be able to give
some suggestions also.

784
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:17,812
We have lots of treatments, lots of
chemical treatments to make them shine

785
00:57:17,812 --> 00:57:20,312
Ha, that’s what we don’t have.

786
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:25,113
Also, like, we don’t have
good buckles in India, say.

787
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:29,213
Really, we don’t have. We don’t
have proper glues in India.

788
00:57:29,232 --> 00:57:36,122
 And we don’t have zips. You should export your
zips from here and get a, get a purse instead.

789
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:41,799
Yes, we don’t have. Many
things we don’t have there.

790
00:57:41,809 --> 00:57:48,699
Proper, what you call, today, this, Marie showed
Me something in which you can fix a picture.

791
00:57:48,705 --> 00:57:54,286
That’s such a nice, beautiful,
er, latch. We don’t have.

792
00:57:54,286 --> 00:57:57,505
In India we don’t have such nice latches.

793
00:58:01,756 --> 00:58:04,256
So many things!

794
00:58:04,256 --> 00:58:11,086
You can also export from here your taps, but I don’t
know; American taps are such that they don’t fit anywhere.

795
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,900
Everything is so funny here.

796
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,994
Your, er, this thing, electrical is hundred and ten.

797
00:58:20,015 --> 00:58:22,515
It doesn’t fit anywhere.

798
00:58:23,825 --> 00:58:26,325
Hundred and ten!

799
00:58:28,197 --> 00:58:32,070
 Everything is like that. You can’t
buy anything electrical from here.

800
00:58:32,491 --> 00:58:34,991
Your television is  different.

801
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:38,390
You cannot use the cameras that you use here.

802
00:58:40,571 --> 00:58:42,893
How is the videos?

803
00:58:42,891 --> 00:58:45,103
You cannot use for videos, you see.

804
00:58:45,103 --> 00:58:48,103
We cannot use your tape recorders.

805
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:50,403
Nothing electrical we can use.

806
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:51,883
So what a bulk is gone.

807
00:58:51,923 --> 00:58:54,423
See, what will you export?

808
00:58:54,423 --> 00:58:57,823
I mean, your government is seeing to
it that nothing should be exported.

809
00:59:02,688 --> 00:59:04,628
What will you export then?

810
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:08,541
Electrical goods are out.
Now take another. Your cars:

811
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:12,241
your cars are funny. Nobody wants it,
because one reason: they are too big.

812
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:22,972
But [unclear] it started here. I don’t understand how the rest of the world got out of sync or we got out of sync.....

813
00:59:23,899 --> 00:59:26,749
That’s the thing with them
is, that’s the main thing.

814
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:30,171
It is that they want to
do something different.

815
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,431
Can I have My sweater please?

816
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:35,821
They always want to do something different.

817
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:42,899
And in doing so, they have alienated themselves,
separated themselves from the rest of the world.

818
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:51,631
That’s the point is. They, they just
don’t want to do the way others can do.

819
00:59:54,421 --> 00:59:56,921
I mean, a simple thing like a sweater, you see.

820
00:59:56,921 --> 00:59:59,421
I wanted to buy one for My son-in-law.

821
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:02,901
It’s all funny style. It’s
not one that he would wear.

822
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:08,311
Whatever generally people wear, is not
available here. They were all English.

823
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:13,038
Otherwise, with a neck like
that, with a collar like that.

824
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:17,208
And the frocks you try to buy for your
children, they’ll have all funny things.

825
01:00:18,858 --> 01:00:21,833
All is funny things they make.

826
01:00:21,853 --> 01:00:24,353
I went to see the socks.

827
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:27,783
Socks are colours like,

828
01:00:27,803 --> 01:00:30,303
what you call them,

829
01:00:30,303 --> 01:00:32,803
what colours, shocking pink!

830
01:00:32,803 --> 01:00:35,303
Now imagine Me wearing a shocking pink.

831
01:00:38,353 --> 01:00:44,996
Ha, then we went to buy, I mean it’s like
that, went to buy what you call them, goggles?

832
01:00:44,996 --> 01:00:48,633
The ladies’ goggles, all of them, are like
this. You’ll like a witch, you know.

833
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:51,148
All of them having like this. This is ladies’.

834
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:57,581
All of them had some sort of a white stuff or a golden
stuff or anything coming out up to this point.

835
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:02,887
I mean, if you wear, it is for
the witches to wear like this.

836
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:06,177
And no Indian woman would
wear a thing, I don’t know.

837
01:01:06,207 --> 01:01:07,977
What to buy? Then I didn’t buy.

838
01:01:07,977 --> 01:01:09,737
Same with the watches.

839
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:12,877
 Everything big problem,
you know. It’s odd-looking;

840
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:15,387
nothing decent.

841
01:01:15,387 --> 01:01:19,207
It’s odd-looking. I mean, simple things like this.

842
01:01:19,207 --> 01:01:21,027
What is the....?

843
01:01:21,037 --> 01:01:26,018
Traditional style. The traditional styles you can’t
get. They import them from England and Switzerland.

844
01:01:26,018 --> 01:01:31,318
 No, no, all right, I don’t say traditional it
should be, but something near decency, isn’t it?

845
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:39,478
Now supposing you have a sweater like this. I mean,
you are not some king or someone to walk like that.

846
01:01:39,478 --> 01:01:41,978
It looks so funny, na?

847
01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:45,398
All funny looking, I mean to say.

848
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,318
Mother, and they sell clothes that are
already worn out. So when you buy them

849
01:01:51,348 --> 01:01:52,568
Ha, with holes.

850
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:53,258
Yes!

851
01:01:57,926 --> 01:02:00,426
It is I can’t understand.

852
01:02:13,665 --> 01:02:17,406
Anything that we found that was
really something, we can say,

853
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,816
 it’s traditional or something
that anybody can wear decently,

854
01:02:20,816 --> 01:02:25,336
was all English.  All English!

855
01:02:25,344 --> 01:02:29,256
 Or Polish or anything else but American!

856
01:02:31,096 --> 01:02:37,529
Either the pants would be baggy or would be so
tight that once you wear it you cannot take it out.

857
01:02:48,779 --> 01:02:51,279
Very difficult.

858
01:02:51,899 --> 01:02:56,156
That’s why they have junks here. Nobody
can take it and nobody can purchase it.

859
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:07,039
Same with jewellery, I must say.

860
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,019
Jewellery is also quite odd, you know.

861
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:13,979
In the ear such big, big things you
know, hang from here up to here.

862
01:03:14,009 --> 01:03:16,979
There are jewelleries also very funny and queer.

863
01:03:16,999 --> 01:03:21,609
The original jewellery they used to make
was beautiful but they stopped making it.

864
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:24,269
They import all the stuff now.

865
01:03:27,536 --> 01:03:30,746
I don’t know what to say, but really I feel

866
01:03:30,759 --> 01:03:38,886
that people must come to some universal understanding
in this country which stands for universality.

867
01:03:38,896 --> 01:03:42,313
It’s, is the centre of collectivity.

868
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:47,946
Then you go on seeing people also like that.

869
01:03:47,946 --> 01:03:52,484
They become very queer. There’s
no universality in them.

870
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:56,796
Somebody will talk like this;
another will talk like that.

871
01:03:56,796 --> 01:03:59,576
Every time you have to adjust
your ears to every person.

872
01:04:01,468 --> 01:04:03,424
That’s not good.

873
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:09,134
 I mean, if you have to have rapport with the whole
world, you must have certain norms, isn’t it?

874
01:04:09,153 --> 01:04:14,154
And this country should create
norms. On the contrary, I would say.

875
01:04:35,424 --> 01:04:39,025
In these, I think twenty-five years or so,

876
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,520
they have deviated so
much (teacup falls over)

877
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:43,620
in individualism and all that. It’s too much.

878
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:46,920
Now this is also a very
small cup, American style.

879
01:04:49,044 --> 01:04:50,310
It’s all right; doesn’t matter.

880
01:04:50,306 --> 01:04:54,687
Can you get something to clean?
It’s rather a small cup for a tea.

881
01:04:55,518 --> 01:04:57,597
It’s all right. You just bring some cloth.

882
01:04:57,597 --> 01:04:59,917
It’s all right. Doesn’t matter. Nothing to be worried

883
01:04:59,917 --> 01:05:02,967
So this is what happens.

884
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:07,426
 And one has to bring it to that normalcy.

885
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:13,276
I don’t know when will be they think about it?

886
01:05:13,298 --> 01:05:18,908
 It’s all right. That’s all right. We just only,
you have to use a little wet cloth for this,

887
01:05:18,908 --> 01:05:21,828
because the tea takes....,
the silk might get it.

888
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,998
Just wet, wet it and little bit water.

889
01:05:30,698 --> 01:05:33,198
So,

890
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:41,397
 I would suggest that when you people try to do something,
like even having a video now, we had a problem.

891
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:47,403
I said, please try to buy something
in which you’ll also have VHS,

892
01:05:47,436 --> 01:05:50,783
because now we can’t make for
Americans something separate.

893
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:52,943
And you will be missing all the videos.

894
01:05:52,943 --> 01:05:54,663
We are, Mother.

895
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:56,033
You are missing it.

896
01:05:56,033 --> 01:06:00,703
Now, to get one like that , it's
very cheap here in the market.

897
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:05,091
 because I know that it doesn’t cost. So
now if you have to buy any television,

898
01:06:05,091 --> 01:06:08,662
buy that one, which has got both the, isn’t it?

899
01:06:08,662 --> 01:06:12,231
I think this Doctor Bhaava has bought one.

900
01:06:13,687 --> 01:06:16,187
Aaaa?  (unclear). Yes!

901
01:06:16,187 --> 01:06:17,193
And it cost?

902
01:06:17,193 --> 01:06:20,683
Three, three hundred, three hundred dollars.

903
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,944
Yeah!

904
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:31,514
 I mean, most of the recording
is done by this particular thing.

905
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:36,751
So if you buy that now, I mean,
instead of buying anything else.

906
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:41,771
Can you? No, is it, is it little bit wet?

907
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:44,397
It should be wet.

908
01:06:44,397 --> 01:06:47,457
Yes, water. Little water on it; that’s all.

909
01:06:47,477 --> 01:06:49,977
Bring some water on it; that’s all.

910
01:06:49,977 --> 01:06:55,499
If you buy something like that, then wherever we have
the films, anywhere in the world,

911
01:06:55,525 --> 01:07:00,189
you can see it. Except for America, everybody can see it.

912
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:05,171
A very big problem!

913
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:10,761
And to adopt anything from this
one to yours is very difficult.

914
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:14,161
But more difficult it is from yours to this.

915
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:17,598
 Is even more difficult!

916
01:07:33,787 --> 01:07:36,662
He’s so playful. Let him play,

917
01:07:36,662 --> 01:07:39,162
let him play.

918
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:51,667
He’s feeling shy.

919
01:07:51,702 --> 01:07:54,202
He's hiding from us.

920
01:08:01,332 --> 01:08:03,832
Hello, Bhima, I can see you.

921
01:08:03,832 --> 01:08:06,332
Aaaaaa!

922
01:08:09,512 --> 01:08:12,650
Are, baba, so much problem.
Just, just a little wet cloth.

923
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:22,807
It’s too much. Just have it wet cloth.
She's rubbing. She knows. Just a wee bit.

924
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,877
Here it is wet.

925
01:08:23,877 --> 01:08:26,377
Yes, it’s all right. Anything will do.

926
01:08:26,377 --> 01:08:29,284
Just, just a wee bit it stands.

927
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:32,687
It takes out the stain; that’s all.

928
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:36,244
It’s a... you see, always there’s a stain with this.

929
01:08:36,247 --> 01:08:37,024
Clean, ha.

930
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:42,857
A bigger cup would be better,
not such a small one.

931
01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:46,717
You see, normally they use that
small one for the coffee, isn’t it?

932
01:08:46,717 --> 01:08:49,217
North India, America, I don’t know.

933
01:08:52,937 --> 01:08:56,316
There, it’s faded, already.

934
01:09:03,836 --> 01:09:08,776
No, it is, it's there a little bit, already there.

935
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:12,246
You can take it out there.

936
01:09:14,606 --> 01:09:16,217
The stain is there also.

937
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:16,887
Aaaa?

938
01:09:16,887 --> 01:09:19,387
It is a half-cup, like a half-truth.

939
01:09:19,387 --> 01:09:24,117
But you don’t have it anywhere in
the world, one like that, you see.

940
01:09:24,117 --> 01:09:27,807
It’s for a coffee after dinner.

941
01:09:27,812 --> 01:09:29,277
That’s a wee bit.

942
01:09:29,277 --> 01:09:35,339
But for tea they don’t have it. But you see,
in America you have to accept everything.

943
01:09:43,586 --> 01:09:46,086
Does soap help?

944
01:09:46,086 --> 01:09:48,586
No, just water, cold water.

945
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:51,086
Yes. Is done, I think.

946
01:09:51,116 --> 01:09:53,304
One little bit there.

947
01:09:53,306 --> 01:09:55,806
And a bit there.

948
01:09:55,806 --> 01:09:59,324
Yes, I think so. He is very good at taking.

949
01:09:59,327 --> 01:10:03,741
Oh, Danny is another, a real Englishman.

950
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:05,741
He is so resourceful; you have no idea.

951
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:09,481
Oh, he’s extremely resourceful.

952
01:10:15,329 --> 01:10:20,393
He is so resourceful man, I have to
come across another person like him.

953
01:10:20,401 --> 01:10:22,901
He’s like Jeeves, you know.

954
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:28,348
Leave it to Jeeves; leave it to Jeeves.

955
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:32,551
Extremely resourceful.

956
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:51,044
Thank you.

957
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:59,530
He’s very straightforward and very resourceful.

958
01:10:59,563 --> 01:11:00,964
(More tea is offered.)

959
01:11:00,974 --> 01:11:04,244
Ah, this is a proper cup.

960
01:11:20,294 --> 01:11:24,274
 Ha, that’s it. That’s it, very sweet. Thank you.

961
01:11:28,924 --> 01:11:31,424
Very good, thank you.

962
01:11:35,284 --> 01:11:37,784
English put the milk first.

963
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:43,654
But that’s not very logical.

964
01:11:46,994 --> 01:11:50,996
You see, if you put the milk first, then you
don’t know how much milk you need, isn’t it?

965
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:57,480
 Isn’t it? Not very logical, I think.

966
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:03,123
You must put first the tea and then the
milk; you know how much it is to be put.

967
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:12,062
 But they are competing with you in everything.

968
01:12:12,062 --> 01:12:17,833
Specially now they have produced a special one thing
in which they have got the highest marks, is punks.

969
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:31,346
That’s a good idea to keep the left Agnya
open like that, eh?

970
01:12:33,072 --> 01:12:35,572
That’s a good idea.
