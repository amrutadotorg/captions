00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:28.567
So today is a day according to Indian calendar

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:34.689
called as Parivartani Ekaadashi.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.129
Now, today’s the eleventh day of the moon,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.895
eleventh day is Ekaadashi.

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:48.333
Also, in Sahaj Yoga you know about Ekaadasha Rudra

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:56.075
which is here, which will ultimately destroy all those things

00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:58.919
which are not required anymore.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.284
That is Ekaadasha here that is the eleventh,

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.547
but today is a special day where we are going to use

00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:13.320
the power of Ekaadasha

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:17.859
to do the parivartan which means the transformation.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.609
It is not for destruction but for transformation.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.820
Is such a day to be here in New York

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.225
where we use the destructive powers

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:31.928
for the transformation of human beings.

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:34.748
So, it’s a very great day today

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:42.908
that we are going to transform people

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.214
by the manifestation of the Ekaadasha’s powers.

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:55.097
And they are eleven placed over your forehead here

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:59.222
and you know how they work out.

00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:10.540
So, these ten come out of destructive powers of the Void.

00:02:11.056 --> 00:02:15.871
Void has got ten destructive powers also,

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:23.043
out of those ten the destructive part settles down here.

00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:26.020
So when a person is on his destruction

00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:29.676
say for example a cancer is setting

00:02:29.877 --> 00:02:36.965
then you might feel a throb here at the apex of your Void.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:39.746
The throb.

00:02:39.947 --> 00:02:41.708
And, it doesn’t logically means

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.606
that if there’s a throb set in there’s a cancer,

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:47.020
but if there’s a cancer there will be a throbbing here going on.

00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:53.239
That means the force of life is trying to push it

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.278
but the obstruction there starts accumulating on both the sides

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:08.122
and in the center is the center of Vishuddhi of the Virat

00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:14.615
where Shri Krishna has become the Virat the Great Primordial Being.

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:19.498
So, this is the eleventh power of destruction.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.396
He has a power called samhaara shakti

00:03:22.597 --> 00:03:25.753
by which he kills people

00:03:25.954 --> 00:03:31.390
so before killing them and finishing them off in the compassion of your Mother

00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:34.796
we have to first try to transform them.

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:37.694
If they cannot be transformed then it’s alright

00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:40.233
then let Ekaadasha take over.

00:03:40.434 --> 00:03:46.913
So, their eleven destructive powers will be used by the Kalaki

00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:52.061
the one who is going to manifest on a white horse.

00:03:52.262 --> 00:03:55.053
Before that today is a very great day

00:03:55.254 --> 00:04:01.652
that these powers you are going to use for transformation.

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:09.136
Now how can destructive powers be used for transformation?

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:13.657
First of all when people know

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:18.391
that there are destructive powers manifesting,

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:21.969
they start fearing,

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.203
they get afraid that we’ll be destroyed

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:32.133
so we must take to God that’s one of the ways.

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:36.203
Secondly, if a person comes to know about

00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:40.742
any destructive disease like cancer

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:43.945
he wants to find out a method.

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:48.687
And there is no method available on a human level.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:54.960
So then he thinks of God. And wants to come nearer to God.

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:58.343
The fear brings him closer to God.

00:04:58.544 --> 00:05:01.929
He depends on God more then on his rationality,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.765
then on his ego or superego, and he wants to depend on

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:14.717
God’s powers to cure him or to save him from his destruction.

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:17.196
Because he’s now on the brink of destruction,

00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:20.766
as soon as cancer is set in he knows that

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:26.927
there’s no end to it and he has to be destroyed.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.399
So, this is another way we people take to transformation,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.438
change their attitudes, change their value systems.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:44.961
I’ve known of many husbands or wives who got cancer

00:05:45.162 --> 00:05:47.702
and their counterparts

00:05:47.903 --> 00:05:53.835
became very mild, gentle, kindly, romantic people.

00:05:54.036 --> 00:06:01.085
They try to give all the love, all the protection,

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:06.382
all the good things to a person who is going to die now of Ekaadasha.

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:13.124
So a kind of a transforming temperament starts coming in a man

00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:18.304
that he sees that the person with whom he has lived all his life

00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:21.327
is now going to be no more

00:06:21.528 --> 00:06:26.257
so a kind of beautiful feelings towards the person

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:31.476
of giving whatever you have beautiful within you starts

00:06:31.677 --> 00:06:36.781
and that’s how people develop another kind of personality

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:39.945
which was never apparent before.

00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:47.289
So all the harshness and the aggressiveness drops out

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.716
and all the sweetness starts pouring in.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.921
So the compassion in a man is a big thing,

00:06:58.122 --> 00:07:02.304
by which she gets transformed, many people who have lost

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.101
their relations kith and kin

00:07:05.302 --> 00:07:11.640
become much more gentle kindly people,

00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:15.562
because Ekaadasha has expressed its awe.

00:07:15.763 --> 00:07:20.164
And also another kind of a fear comes into the minds of the people

00:07:20.365 --> 00:07:23.625
that tomorrow this can happen to me also.

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:27.219
So I must do something about it.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.274
So at this time Sahaj Yoga helps them a lot.

00:07:31.475 --> 00:07:34.837
They come to Sahaj Yoga because such an emergency

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.579
is created within themselves

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.813
and they are rushed for their transformation to Sahaj Yoga.

00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:47.977
But, there’s another subtler way this destructive force helps

00:07:48.178 --> 00:07:53.704
by destroying all that is negative within us.

00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:59.868
Because unless and until that negative is destroyed within us,

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:06.532
we cannot become people who can enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:08.993
We have our ego, we have our superego,

00:08:09.194 --> 00:08:12.423
and both can be represented here.

00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:16.329
When you have your ego very much great ego

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.360
then you’ll find a big blob-like ego coming out on this side,

00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:23.751
a very big one here. Or if you have a superego

00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:28.501
you can see another big thing jutting out on the brain here.

00:08:28.702 --> 00:08:31.126
So on both the sides you may get both the things

00:08:31.327 --> 00:08:35.235
if both the sympathetic are overactive.

00:08:35.436 --> 00:08:38.446
If you are not a very collective person

00:08:38.647 --> 00:08:40.555
also you might get a blob here

00:08:40.756 --> 00:08:43.946
so you might get all the thing filled up with your ego,

00:08:44.147 --> 00:08:53.900
superego and this Virata’s center again, blown up,

00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:59.728
in a way that a person develops a face

00:08:59.929 --> 00:09:01.580
like a monster sometimes,

00:09:01.781 --> 00:09:04.721
this portion becomes too big thick jutting out,

00:09:04.922 --> 00:09:07.252
there’s a character I’ve seen like that

00:09:07.453 --> 00:09:10.588
I think it is Frankenstein or someone.

00:09:10.789 --> 00:09:13.486
Is it?

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:15.463
Frankenstein.

00:09:15.664 --> 00:09:19.065
Yes, that has come from the unconscious, Frankenstein character,

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:23.393
is all this swollen up, jutting out and this face like that.

00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:28.049
That’s really the one that happens to human beings

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.960
when he becomes a devil himself.

00:09:36.347 --> 00:09:39.732
So this is how the Ekaadasha works within us

00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:43.998
to destroy our negativity within us.

00:09:44.199 --> 00:09:51.981
In India so many people fast on this day, for atonement,

00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:55.481
on eleventh day is very common you must do Ekadashi

00:09:55.682 --> 00:09:58.887
all the Hindus and all these people do Ekadashi

00:09:59.088 --> 00:10:02.207
that is the eleventh day they don’t eat anything at all.

00:10:02.408 --> 00:10:05.770
But you shouldn’t do it after the advent of your Mother.

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:08.403
Because I’m the Ekaadasha Myself,

00:10:08.604 --> 00:10:10.567
so why should you do it now when I’ve come,

00:10:10.768 --> 00:10:12.825
it was done when I was not here just to call Me

00:10:13.026 --> 00:10:16.067
so now I’m back here so you need not do this anymore

00:10:16.268 --> 00:10:20.544
the penance of Ekaadasha. But you have to be careful.

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:25.669
Now Ekaadasha comes as I told you from the Void.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:34.044
So, firstly it comes when you accept someone as your guru.

00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:40.958
Say who are false, who are anti-God, anti-Christ,

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:45.106
so you develop a kind of a thickness on this side

00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:50.645
when it is the person whom you are worshipping as a guru

00:10:50.846 --> 00:10:54.239
or are respecting as a guru, is a guru to you

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.841
who is not really a guru so you develop a superego

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:02.857
which shows on this side this part.

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:06.091
Now the other side of it shows when a person says,

00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:11.216
“I’m my own guru, I’m practicing my own meditation,

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:13.880
I’ve nothing to do with anybody’s guidance,

00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:16.388
I’m quite alright as I am,”

00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:18.279
such a person develops the other half,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.154
so you have this half developed because of that

00:11:21.355 --> 00:11:24.388
and this half developed because of the superego

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:29.784
that you get these false and fake gurus.

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:36.348
Now what happens sometimes, that when you get involved into

00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:47.371
this kind of superego behavior

00:11:47.572 --> 00:11:55.970
at that time it so happens that you might take over from that

00:11:56.171 --> 00:12:02.259
and start using it for your ego, that’s the worst type for you.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:09.173
At that time what you do is to act like the devils yourself,

00:12:09.374 --> 00:12:13.915
and once you start doing that your Ekaadasha is completely finished

00:12:14.116 --> 00:12:18.404
and then I don’t think it’s easy to get rid of it,

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:24.974
it’s very difficult. But if it is one-sided it is much easier.

00:12:25.175 --> 00:12:29.696
So today is the day which is called as the Ekaadasha

00:12:29.897 --> 00:12:33.657
which is going to bring the transformation.

00:12:33.858 --> 00:12:36.126
When you are transformed

00:12:36.327 --> 00:12:40.407
so many things are automatically destroyed within you

00:12:40.608 --> 00:12:43.259
as you can see very clearly

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.165
that all your misidentifications drop out.

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:50.149
The misidentification that, “I am an American”

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.040
that “I’m a Christian” or “I’m a Jew” “I am this” “I am that,”

00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:59.024
all these false misidentifications drop out

00:12:59.225 --> 00:13:01.831
and you becomes a naked human being first of all

00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.292
you are a human being

00:13:04.493 --> 00:13:09.159
and then a superhuman being without the ego,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.440
without the ego, so your ego is destroyed,

00:13:13.641 --> 00:13:17.909
your superego is destroyed, your conditionings are destroyed

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.792
and all your false ideas about knowledge are destroyed.

00:13:22.993 --> 00:13:27.136
So what remains and emerges out is the reality.

00:13:27.337 --> 00:13:35.159
Now see when a flower becomes the fruit

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.206
everything practically drops out of the fruit,

00:13:41.407 --> 00:13:45.761
of the flower you can say, like the Calyx is dropped out

00:13:45.962 --> 00:13:52.769
then the petals are dropped out and then the

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:58.941
Epicalyxes is there that is also dropped
out, but what remains is the seed

00:13:59.142 --> 00:14:03.746
actually if you see, around the seed all these things develop

00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:07.848
and the fruit remains the rest of it drops out.

00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:12.301
In some fruits some part is used in some fruits

00:14:12.502 --> 00:14:17.141
nothingly is used, a very little shoot comes out as fruit

00:14:17.342 --> 00:14:21.352
and becomes the ffruit while the flowers are finished.

00:14:21.553 --> 00:14:30.000
So in us also whatever becomes Spirit remains,

00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:34.851
the rest drops out, and that is what it is when we call it

00:14:35.052 --> 00:14:41.585
the Ekaadasha which brings forth the transformation.

00:14:41.786 --> 00:14:47.467
And one has to understand we have to drop out many things.

00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:50.498
Some people I’ve seen they say, “What’s wrong?

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:53.484
I’m smoking still my vibrations are alright.”

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:57.656
Some say, “What’s wrong? I’m drinking still my vibrations are normal.”

00:14:57.857 --> 00:15:01.867
“I’m going to this guru still my vibrations are there.”

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:05.172
“I’m having the same type of licentious life

00:15:05.373 --> 00:15:07.969
still my vibrations are there.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:13.477
Now it goes a very long way,

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:18.485
vibrations are still there but suddenly they stop

00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:22.344
and you find you’re out of the bounds,

00:15:22.545 --> 00:15:26.547
you’re thrown out completely,

00:15:26.748 --> 00:15:29.351
but you do not feel how you are thrown out

00:15:29.552 --> 00:15:32.117
gradually you find like a tangent you go out

00:15:32.318 --> 00:15:35.156
and so one has to be careful about them.

00:15:35.357 --> 00:15:41.695
So within us lies a force which is centrifugal

00:15:41.896 --> 00:15:44.742
and a force that is centripetal ,

00:15:44.943 --> 00:15:49.484
so Ekaadasha’s force is centrifugal by which we are thrown out.

00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:53.523
Sahaj Yoga does not fall onto anybody’s feet,

00:15:53.724 --> 00:15:57.242
doesn’t request anyone, it doesn’t flatter anyone,

00:15:57.443 --> 00:16:01.906
if you want to be there, you have to be positively there

00:16:02.107 --> 00:16:04.070
and if you don’t want to be there

00:16:04.271 --> 00:16:07.492
it throws you much faster than what you want.

00:16:07.693 --> 00:16:09.703
That’s the trouble with Sahaj Yoga is

00:16:09.904 --> 00:16:12.755
and this is the loophole of Sahaj Yoga which I must tell you

00:16:12.956 --> 00:16:17.383
as a Mother, that it’s very anxious to throw you out.

00:16:17.584 --> 00:16:22.781
I’ll tell you when Christine, just now she told Me also,

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:29.523
got engaged to Michael, half of them were thrown out

00:16:29.724 --> 00:16:33.570
because they had a conception that you must have a romance

00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:36.547
before marriage, without a romance if you have a marriage

00:16:36.748 --> 00:16:38.813
then there should be no marriage.

00:16:39.014 --> 00:16:42.102
I don’t know on what conception it is based

00:16:42.303 --> 00:16:44.618
but if you have the romance before the marriage

00:16:44.819 --> 00:16:46.860
what’s the fun of having the marriage?

00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:50.258
I mean it’s like if you have to give somebody a present

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:53.203
you hide it, you keep it to that date

00:16:53.404 --> 00:16:56.398
and then give the surprise to the children,

00:16:56.599 --> 00:17:00.921
in the same way if you have the romance already done

00:17:01.122 --> 00:17:04.991
what’s the marriage? What’s the celebration for?

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:09.403
It’s absolutely illogical, there is no romance in such cases

00:17:09.604 --> 00:17:12.176
actually we have seen that after the romance

00:17:12.377 --> 00:17:14.457
the marriage ends in a divorce.

00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:18.144
It’s always like that because you become stale

00:17:18.345 --> 00:17:20.747
and you find the romance you had before marriage

00:17:20.948 --> 00:17:23.974
was something a fantasy that has dropped out

00:17:24.175 --> 00:17:29.701
and now after marriage there is nothing left to enjoy

00:17:29.902 --> 00:17:33.881
so you’re fed up and next month you are in the divorce case.

00:17:34.082 --> 00:17:37.826
But the marriages that take place without the romance,

00:17:38.027 --> 00:17:42.014
kept all reserved for a particular day

00:17:42.215 --> 00:17:46.569
just for that day when you are going to have the real romance

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.639
and real feeling of oneness, everything,

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.647
in India it’s a very big thing you see the first night of the marriage.

00:17:55.848 --> 00:17:59.319
And that’s why our marriages last you know

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.639
I would say I’m an old woman of sixty years, My husband’s sixty-three years

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.323
and you can see how romantic he is still

00:18:05.524 --> 00:18:07.617
you see the romance never finishes,

00:18:07.818 --> 00:18:10.664
because it starts on an auspicious day

00:18:10.865 --> 00:18:13.484
with the sanction of the collectivity

00:18:13.685 --> 00:18:18.570
everybody taking interest in that romance,

00:18:18.771 --> 00:18:22.140
it is such a big thing to be married,

00:18:22.341 --> 00:18:26.195
all the people enjoying the marriage and enjoying.

00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:29.148
[YOGINI: Would you like to take some fruit, Mother?

00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:31.421
No, No, Thank you.

00:18:31.622 --> 00:18:33.319
So now,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.076
this kind of thing when happens to the people who are western people,

00:18:37.277 --> 00:18:39.357
people think romance is very important

00:18:39.558 --> 00:18:42.130
but I don’t think one can learn anything from

00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:44.591
the marriage system of the western people

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:49.888
because all their marriage system is absolutely in a [DWINDLE DOWN?]

00:18:50.089 --> 00:18:52.357
there’s nothing to be learned from them as for as that,

00:18:52.558 --> 00:18:54.310
we can learn many other things

00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:57.904
for example we can learn how to operate a camera,

00:18:58.105 --> 00:19:02.974
but to operate a marriage it’s better you learn from Indians.

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:06.169
We have a very solid system of marriage,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.655
first of all the way they are trained from childhood

00:19:08.856 --> 00:19:11.046
how to make a marriage successful

00:19:11.247 --> 00:19:13.062
such a lot of importance is given,

00:19:13.263 --> 00:19:15.851
then without the horoscope they won’t marry,

00:19:16.052 --> 00:19:18.624
without the auspicious day they won’t marry,

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:21.866
everything they work out in such details

00:19:22.067 --> 00:19:25.272
so that the marriage cannot fizzle out,

00:19:25.473 --> 00:19:27.381
moreover it is working in a such a collective way,

00:19:27.582 --> 00:19:29.990
for example supposing My husband wants to trouble Me,

00:19:30.191 --> 00:19:32.560
say for example you see,

00:19:32.761 --> 00:19:37.912
so, the sister of My husband will take him to task,

00:19:38.113 --> 00:19:41.607
everybody can interfere if they try to do anything against

00:19:41.808 --> 00:19:46.099
the marriage, everyone in the family will be after the person

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.685
who tries to break the marriage and so everyone knows that

00:19:50.886 --> 00:19:53.505
I’ll be left high and dry you see if I have a divorce,

00:19:53.706 --> 00:19:56.896
nobody has place in the society

00:19:57.097 --> 00:20:00.349
but in England when we went first we were shocked.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.193
They had no shame about this, they said, “I’m already divorced

00:20:03.394 --> 00:20:06.131
thrice and this is the fourth woman I am living with.”

00:20:06.332 --> 00:20:08.342
So shocking it was oh God.

00:20:08.543 --> 00:20:12.584
To us a divorce means worse than leprosy.

00:20:12.785 --> 00:20:16.100
Why are you divorced? What’s the problem?

00:20:16.301 --> 00:20:20.147
How can you be divorced? Such an auspicious thing is the marriage,

00:20:20.348 --> 00:20:24.491
such a blessing it is, it is God blessed how can you do it?

00:20:24.692 --> 00:20:28.007
It’s such a big fall and that’s how it works out

00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:32.011
and in no way we are less than you people as married

00:20:32.212 --> 00:20:36.816
because we can produce much more children than you can produce,

00:20:37.017 --> 00:20:40.504
and children only want to be born in India not anywhere else,

00:20:40.705 --> 00:20:43.379
you’ll be surprised that’s the problem we are facing.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.715
Our population problem comes from the point that

00:20:46.916 --> 00:20:50.254
the marriages are so successful, the people are so peaceful,

00:20:50.455 --> 00:20:55.340
the children hate to be married in the nightmares of New York,

00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:58.457
naturally because you don’t know where will be the mother tomorrow

00:20:58.658 --> 00:21:03.793
and where will be the father, now we are blamed for a high rate

00:21:03.994 --> 00:21:06.965
of fertility but what to do, children don’t listen

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:10.254
they don’t want to go to all such places

00:21:10.455 --> 00:21:14.121
where there’s no stability for them

00:21:14.322 --> 00:21:17.293
specially the realized children,

00:21:17.494 --> 00:21:19.676
if they are of a very high quality they do

00:21:19.877 --> 00:21:22.449
I mean they have to be like they’re devils to get into this,

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.613
so they may try or maybe they’re real devils

00:21:25.814 --> 00:21:30.691
they can take advantage of, but normally

00:21:30.892 --> 00:21:35.371
people who want peace in life, who want joy in life

00:21:35.572 --> 00:21:39.152
and the love of their parents want to be born in India.

00:21:39.353 --> 00:21:41.746
And that’s why

00:21:41.947 --> 00:21:45.605
recently you’ll find that India is growing so fast in population

00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:49.043
that we don’t know what to do about it.

00:21:49.244 --> 00:21:54.777
So this marriage system came in which shocked them

00:21:54.978 --> 00:21:57.840
because they couldn’t understand that there has to be a romance

00:21:58.041 --> 00:22:00.814
and this and that.

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:08.075
Now the more understanding of Ekaadasha should be there,

00:22:08.276 --> 00:22:12.341
that we should not allow it to be built within us in anyway,

00:22:12.542 --> 00:22:15.380
because these are self-destroying things.

00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:18.286
It starts with doubting.

00:22:18.487 --> 00:22:23.700
When you start doubting Sahaj Yoga the build up starts

00:22:23.901 --> 00:22:28.716
and the doubting starts building up throughout the medhas,

00:22:28.917 --> 00:22:35.976
this is the plate here you see. And it can become a thick, big plate there,

00:22:36.177 --> 00:22:40.070
like today I saw that lady saying, “Touch wood,” you see,

00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:42.883
touch wood means this wood you see touch wood means

00:22:43.084 --> 00:22:45.649
there should be no wood here anymore you see

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.485
or you can say touch stone.

00:22:48.686 --> 00:22:52.563
If you say something like a bragging you say, ‘No, no touch wood.”

00:22:52.764 --> 00:22:57.165
I am not meaning that, I mean people are quite conscious,

00:22:57.366 --> 00:23:00.235
unconsciously they say but they are quite conscious

00:23:00.436 --> 00:23:03.766
not to say something that would sort of give an idea

00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:08.313
of boastful nature or something bragging

00:23:08.514 --> 00:23:12.969
or something big so that it may go wrong.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:19.201
So they say touch wood, this is the wood. This is the Ekaadasha.

00:23:19.936 --> 00:23:24.282
So, we are quite conscious of this force building within us

00:23:24.483 --> 00:23:27.172
and now we have to be conscious that this force

00:23:27.373 --> 00:23:31.610
is going to transform people so today we are going to pray

00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:37.127
that this force has to transform America

00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:43.815
through its capacity to frighten people

00:23:44.016 --> 00:23:45.651
so that they come to Sahaj Yoga.

00:23:45.852 --> 00:23:49.135
Because when things have reached this stage of ego

00:23:49.336 --> 00:23:52.455
then when people say, “What’s wrong?”

00:23:52.656 --> 00:23:56.331
Like in England when I started talking first they said

00:23:56.532 --> 00:24:01.261
this is Victorian woman out of date absolutely useless,

00:24:01.462 --> 00:24:06.363
I said alright, I don’t say anything, but you’ll have such diseases

00:24:06.564 --> 00:24:10.152
that you’ll have to come back. That was the time they passed the law

00:24:10.353 --> 00:24:12.566
that homosexuality should be allowed,

00:24:12.767 --> 00:24:14.550
permissiveness should be allowed

00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:18.386
and all these things should be allowed

00:24:18.587 --> 00:24:21.152
and now you have AIDS.

00:24:21.353 --> 00:24:25.793
You have AIDS now here already operating,

00:24:26.002 --> 00:24:32.731
now the AIDS have given the fear of the Ekaadasha.

00:24:32.932 --> 00:24:36.817
Now have it, “What’s wrong?”

00:24:37.018 --> 00:24:40.236
What about that?

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:47.340
So this awe and this fear is very important,

00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:52.824
it’s an extremely important thing that we must have the awe

00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:59.449
and the fear that God is Almighty

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.129
and we are nothing before Him,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:08.176
here we have to remember that we are part and parcel of that God

00:25:08.377 --> 00:25:12.551
and that we have to awaken ourselves to the consciousness

00:25:12.752 --> 00:25:20.314
that He is the whole and we have become one with the whole.

00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:26.002
That’s how we are going to overcome our Ekaadasha.

00:25:26.526 --> 00:25:31.481
So today I bless you all with the power of Ekaadasha

00:25:31.682 --> 00:25:37.402
which is going to transform you. May God bless you all in your

00:25:37.603 --> 00:25:41.832
work which you are trying to do for the good of Americans

00:25:42.033 --> 00:25:45.168
it is your responsibility to save America,

00:25:45.369 --> 00:25:48.902
you know it is the Vishuddhi chakra and all the responsibility

00:25:49.103 --> 00:25:51.629
of Sahaj Yoga rests on Vishuddhi chakra

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.387
so how important it is that the transformation is to take place

00:25:55.588 --> 00:25:58.043
unless and until the transformation comes in

00:25:58.244 --> 00:26:02.496
you will see it will not work out, you cannot talk to people,

00:26:02.697 --> 00:26:04.504
you cannot communicate with them,

00:26:04.705 --> 00:26:09.887
so you must pray that transformation process must start,

00:26:10.088 --> 00:26:13.067
must trigger, and must gallop

00:26:13.268 --> 00:26:16.653
and must go on spreading like wild fire,

00:26:16.854 --> 00:26:19.255
this should be our prayer today.

00:26:19.456 --> 00:26:23.776
May God bless you.

00:26:27.656 --> 00:26:32.593
May God bless you.
