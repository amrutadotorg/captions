00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:12,444
THE ASPECTS OF VISHUDDHI CHAKRA (PART 1 and 2)

2
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:21,649
So now the other center which we have
here is very important center,

3
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,508
called as the Vishuddhi Chakra. This is
the center Vi-shuddha.

4
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:32,227
One is “shuddha”, means “pure”, but
“vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

5
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:39,258
This has got sixteen petals, as we have got
the cervical plexus expressed in the gross,

6
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:47,014
which has also got sixteen sub-plexuses.
It tallies with medical science completely.

7
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:52,766
Now let us see how this Vishuddhi Chakra
made is.

8
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:58,992
All the vowels that we use come
from Vishuddhi Chakra.

9
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:04,537
And like in Devanagari language it is

10
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:12,299
A AA - I II - U UU - E AI - O AU

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,635
RU RUU - LRU LRUU - AM AHA.

12
00:01:16,836 --> 00:01:23,074
So as you know that you cannot compile
a word without a vowel, is so important.

13
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:29,220
The consonant is weak,

14
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:35,068
without - nirbal [weak], without
any strength, without the vowel.

15
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:41,262
So the strength of a person

16
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:45,113
comes through the Vishuddhi Chakra
in his speech.

17
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:49,628
Is the center, what we call, here,
is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

18
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,946
is the center where human beings raised
their head up.

19
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,079
This is the center that has made us
a human being,

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,509
and from this center only rises the ego
and superego,

21
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,681
because this is the center of collectivity.

22
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:08,329
Because we speak through this center,
we talk through this,

23
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,259
we have rapport with other people through
this, and as a reaction to that,

24
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,970
ego and superego is built within us.

25
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:20,353
When that is built within us, we become
a personality –

26
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:28,758
I am some, he is some, you are some.
At that point we become

27
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:34,477
a person who has the consciousness
of I-ness.

28
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,321
Like then I’ll say “I like this, I want
this.”

29
00:02:39,522 --> 00:02:43,220
Say, I will say “I’m an Indian,” you’ll say
“I’m an Englishman.”

30
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:48,242
All these misidentifications start because
you become an individual

31
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:51,525
who tries to identify with many things.

32
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:56,228
That's how we become separated
from that power.

33
00:02:56,429 --> 00:03:01,287
This is the freedom we get, where
we have to ourselves

34
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:06,110
learn from our errors and trials what is
right and what is wrong.

35
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:11,183
This Vishuddhi Chakra is, has got sixteen
petals and looks after

36
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:14,589
our ear, nose, eyes, throat, everything.

37
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,096
Our face, everything is looked after
by this center.

38
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:22,808
Now this center also has left and right –
all centers have left and right –

39
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,894
and when you feel guilty the left center
catches,

40
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:32,659
which is a very dangerous thing because
this gives you diseases like angina,

41
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,940
or maybe diseases like spondylitis and
lethargic organs.

42
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,245
Right – when a person is very aggressive,

43
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:44,393
talks very aggressively and tries
to dominate others

44
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:50,933
and use his power of speech to show off,
the right side catches.

45
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:54,980
The reactions of this can be many:
that the hand gets frozen,

46
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:58,175
and they also get the cancer of the throat;

47
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:03,963
all kinds of things can happen with this
chakra being in trouble.

48
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:19,739
Now a person who shouts and screams
and talks loudly

49
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:29,521
and loses his temper in a very loud voice,
or who speaks very loudly all the time,

50
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:34,136
they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi.

51
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:39,900
So one should understand that even when
you have to scold somebody,

52
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:43,448
you have to just say, "What are you doing?
Why are you doing like this?"

53
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,315
Otherwise: "Why did you do like this?!?"

54
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:51,070
Finished, Right Vishuddhi, over.
It’s finished now.

55
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:54,860
Now this is the thing is.
On the right side

56
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:01,026
if you are talking loudly, if you talk
too much,

57
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:10,262
if you intimidate people with your talking,
then you catch on right Vishuddhi.

58
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:13,756
So for that best is to take some rest

59
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:19,418
and give some rest to your right Vishuddhi
by stopping your talk.

60
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,947
Go into mauna they say, just don't talk.

61
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:25,815
For some time if you don't talk
you will see that

62
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:29,676
your Vishuddhi will be improved,
your problems will be improved.

63
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:33,479
So what is the divine diplomacy?

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,018
You don't have to shout, but you change
the subject.

65
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:46,702
If you want to bring somebody to a,
some conclusion -

66
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:49,913
then best thing is first you change
the subject

67
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:55,202
and gradually, if you are clever enough,
then you go on changing, changing

68
00:05:55,403 --> 00:06:02,764
and you bring it back to the right thing.
That's the clever thing to do.

69
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:11,538
What is the essence of this diplomacy?

70
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,460
Is benevolence.

71
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:26,843
You have to achieve the benevolence
of the whole humanity.

72
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:31,710
This is the essence of it. If you are
doing it, you are not doing for yourself,

73
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:35,569
for your gain. You are not doing
for the gain of any particular person.

74
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,468
But you are doing it for the benevolence
of the whole humanity.

75
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,772
So once you know this is the essence,
so what is the need to shout?

76
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,812
By shouting you are not going to achieve
anything.

77
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:55,350
So to play around with it and bring it
to that point which is benevolence.

78
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,437
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have

79
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:09,277
a temperament, a culture, a style,
a behavior

80
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,851
which has got the quality (…) which is
called as madhurya,

81
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:16,775
means melodious, melodious.

82
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:22,267
We should talk in such a manner that
it should be melodious.

83
00:07:22,468 --> 00:07:26,926
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be
sweet like that.

84
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:32,772
When you talk to someone it should be
melodious.

85
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:38,662
It should not be aggressive, at all, but
on the contrary it should be melodious.

86
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:43,021
It should not be sarcastic; it should not
hurt another person.

87
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:50,968
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

88
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:55,797
So in no way one should hurt.

89
00:07:56,295 --> 00:08:04,500
The another quality which we can express
through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

90
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:09,703
But there are two types of diplomacies:
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

91
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:16,727
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have
to take to a certain standard

92
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:23,016
or you don’t have to read some books
to know what is diplomacy.

93
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:30,861
Is a - genuinely it comes to you. It,
the whole thing works very sweetly,

94
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:33,746
in such a genuine manner.

95
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:39,625
I, I’ve used it many-a-times Myself, and
you all can use it also many-a-times.

96
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:46,743
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry
with them; not possible if you are angry.

97
00:08:56,263 --> 00:09:01,313
Relationship between brothers and sisters
has to be established. They’re very pure.

98
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:07,523
Brothers and sisters relationship is
without any lust or greed.

99
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:16,185
It’s pure relationship where the sister
prays for the protection of the brother,

100
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:29,029
and brother prays for the self-sufficiency
of the kshema – well-being - of the sister.

101
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:36,163
So this time you have to think of your
other Sahaja Yoginis

102
00:09:36,364 --> 00:09:42,311
and Sahaja Yogis who are like your brothers
and sisters.

103
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:47,319
You have to think like that. Purify
your hearts.

104
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:50,314
It’s something funny in these countries,
you know that,

105
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:54,093
there’s no such relationship exists.

106
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:57,630
Purify your mind today on that point,

107
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:02,997
that everybody else is my brother
or sister.

108
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:07,341
If you are married it’s all right. But look
at everyone,

109
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,138
try to look at everyone as a brother,
and a sister.

110
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:18,130
When the sister, who is your pure relation,

111
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:22,372
is not treated as a sister,

112
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:29,208
when the attitude of a person towards women

113
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:38,371
is of indulgence and of lust, then
he develops the Left Vishuddhi.

114
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:45,483
When he develops a Left Vishuddhi very
strongly, and if he has a bad Agnya,

115
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:48,709
or if he has eyes which are roving eyes,

116
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,397
then this Left Vishuddhi causes lot
of trouble.

117
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,707
Left Vishuddhi can be also caused

118
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:59,965
by, as you know, by feeling guilty about
things for nothing at all.

119
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:03,996
All these problems arise from Vishuddhi.

120
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:11,418
The left-side center is caught up when
a person feels guilty

121
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:18,887
and obstructs the ascent of the Kundalini.

122
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:24,301
That’s why I always request all
the Western seekers

123
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:31,676
first to say in their hearts, “Mother,
I’m not guilty.”

124
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:41,199
These are the conditionings that have
come to us

125
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:49,637
from so-called religions, from so-called
psychologists,

126
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:56,118
and other people who are responsible
for our development in our childhood.

127
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:05,399
When material things [were] very important
for the parents,

128
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,757
they all the time shout at children
or correct them, saying that,

129
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:17,493
“Don’t spoil the carpet, don’t spoil that,
don’t spoil that”,

130
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:29,572
and that is how we develop a kind
of a guilt within us.

131
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:34,064
When we grow up in the schools
and colleges,

132
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:39,318
this can be built up very heavily
within us, too.

133
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:53,124
So how much important it is to understand
the value of left Vishuddhi.

134
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:56,958
All of us catch on left Vishuddhi,
and we do not think

135
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,930
that it is such an important thing.

136
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,451
But we say, “Oh, left Vishuddhi catching
means I’m feeling guilty.”

137
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:04,248
We do not understand that “What have
I done?

138
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:09,177
I have crossed the limits, that’s why
is showing there.

139
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,545
I’ve neglected some kind of a morality.

140
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:17,482
I’ve gone on a wrong path against
Mother and Father,

141
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:19,795
that’s why left Vishuddhi is catching.”

142
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:27,647
Left Vishuddhi is the indication of
the mistakes, of the wrongs, of the sins.

143
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,272
We can’t afford to have left Vishuddhi,

144
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:33,203
Sahaja yogis cannot afford to have
left Vishuddhi.

145
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:40,511
Now what I have seen that when this
negativity starts acting,

146
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:44,157
people, instead of facing it, facing
the mistakes that

147
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:47,969
“I’m wrong, I should not have done it,
it’s a wrong thing to do,”

148
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,860
start giving explanations. Once you start
giving explanation,

149
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:58,993
this left Vishuddhi starts becoming like
a bloated big lump,

150
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:04,265
and then there’s no possibility of curing
you, no possibility of cleansing you.

151
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:08,610
So people start giving explanation,
“Why I did it, why I did this.”

152
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:11,563
Once it is said is wrong, is wrong;

153
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:16,274
to be accepted, “All right, next time I’m
not going to do it, I’m very sorry.”

154
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:22,236
But in the center when you rise - the Kundalini rises -

155
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:27,882
most of the people have their Vishuddhi caught up, most of the people.

156
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:30,488
So they have to either see that they are not guilty

157
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,457
or they have to see that there is no shouting - nothing -

158
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:39,613
they are not aggressive in their shouts. And, plus, they have to see

159
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:44,254
that they are completely in balance with themselves.

160
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:50,488
So they are in the central path by which they become sweet, kind and nice.

161
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,542
So for us it is important to understand

162
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:58,335
that our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear, first of all

163
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:02,322
we must have a beautiful heart, a very clean heart.

164
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:07,392
And find out what's wrong with you, get it corrected -

165
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:14,621
which can be done by anyone - and see that you just have

166
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,785
a full idea about yourself, about your Vishuddhi.

167
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:23,418
And that's only possible, only - again it's a vicious circle -

168
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,996
if you have a good Vishuddhi.

169
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:29,066
If you don't have a good Vishuddhi you can never see yourself

170
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:33,394
because at the Vishuddhi point only you become the witness.

171
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,629
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi point.

172
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,316
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi a witness.

173
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,746
If you have achieved the witness nature

174
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:47,927
then you can see in your Vishuddhi what's wrong with you,

175
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:52,654
what's wrong with your problems, with your atmosphere, everything,

176
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:57,519
and you will end up here only, thinking: "Oh, this is the one that is wrong."

177
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,848
Now the main problem before us today is something else.

178
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:17,807
Is that we all have to ascend, and ascend with an equal strength.

179
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:29,066
There’s a story about some birds who were caught in a net,

180
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:34,480
so they decided that we should get out of this net, and they tried.

181
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:40,124
Everybody tried to get out. But nobody individually could work it out.

182
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:45,030
So they all decided to fly together, “One, two, three, and go!”,

183
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:53,274
and they took all that net with them. And they said, then they requested the rats

184
00:16:53,355 --> 00:17:01,455
that “Please come and cut our net”, and they were freed.

185
00:17:02,236 --> 00:17:08,835
So if it can happen between the rats and the birds, why not between us?

186
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:16,555
So in collectivity, you’ll be amazed in the collectivity how we could be helpful

187
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:22,225
and joyous with each other. Now say something is wrong

188
00:17:22,306 --> 00:17:26,772
with your mother, father, sister, somebody, doesn’t matter.

189
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:31,686
After all you have the Ocean of Joy here with the collectivity,

190
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:35,098
and your problems can be solved if collectively,

191
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,279
if you want to solve your problem.

192
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:45,358
So we have to depend on the collectivity. Very much to be one with the collective.

193
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:50,842
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

194
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:57,553
the joy itself draws you together. Meeting each other is such a joyous thing.

195
00:17:57,634 --> 00:18:02,357
We have had so many experiences of that, of Sahaja Yogis who have told me

196
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:07,263
how happy they were to find Sahaja Yogis somewhere

197
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:11,858
out of the blue, and how they felt happy.

198
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:21,504
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis is really the most joyous channel,

199
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:28,294
and that is what is the source we should say, of our becoming one together.

200
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:32,330
Once you start enjoying each other…

201
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:36,161
Collectivity doesn’t mean that we all should be stuck together

202
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:42,431
with some glue or something, or we all become like Gibraltar,

203
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:46,810
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

204
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:53,285
It means wherever you are, you are connected. That is collectivity.

205
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:58,607
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

206
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:04,086
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

207
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:09,298
I think, people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity -

208
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:16,389
where there’s not the other, Ananya. Where there’s not the other,

209
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:21,376
there’s no other personality.

210
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:26,113
These personalities

211
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:33,349
are separated from you because of left and right. Or could be both.

212
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:43,528
But you are yourself fully when you are absolutely detached

213
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:50,800
and your Kundalini is dancing – you are alone and never alone.

214
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:03,676
This oneness with the whole gives you

215
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:10,016
all the security that you want, all the joy you want.

216
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:18,802
And that’s why Kundalini Awakening means "collectivity".

217
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:30,147
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being, Kundalini won’t rise.

218
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:50,449
Now this chakra is - it is, you know, placed between the two eyebrows.

219
00:20:53,004 --> 00:20:57,182
Now, two eyes represent the left and the right side.

220
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:09,605
So this center is very much guided by our eyes,

221
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:19,510
by our ears, by our nose, tongue, teeth, throat.

222
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:28,032
Is a very important center because the Vishuddhi,

223
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:36,236
which has to look after sixteen petals, which sixteen petals which look after

224
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:42,652
all these ear, nose, throat, different, different organs within us,

225
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:48,475
also it has to communicate with the Virat.

226
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:55,391
So it has to pass through this center of Hamsa Chakra.

227
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:10,161
Hamsa Chakra is the very pivotal center

228
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:19,286
which expresses auspiciousness in our awareness.

229
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:26,403
That means if this center is alert and awakened,

230
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:31,917
then we immediately know what is auspicious and what is not auspicious.

231
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:37,574
Or we can call it - we get the Divine Discretion.

232
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:50,282
I think it is a part of the genetics that people have discretion

233
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:59,550
between good and bad, destructive and constructive.

234
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:14,623
Virat is the ultimate,

235
00:23:15,015 --> 00:23:19,825
the complete development of the Vishuddhi chakra is Virat.

236
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:26,342
And as you know the chakra is here, here at this point.

237
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:33,098
If this chakra is not all right, you are not collective.

238
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:37,761
You behave in a manner that is not collective.

239
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:44,175
You cannot communicate with other Sahaja yogis.

240
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:53,404
You cannot be friendly, loving and one with other Sahaja yogis,

241
00:23:54,387 --> 00:24:00,026
unless and until this center here, Vishuddhi, is all right.

242
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,276
And it is part of Ekadasha.

243
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:08,559
Vishuddhi is the center of the Ekadasha Rudra.

244
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:16,933
The discretion power becomes so beautiful of the Hamsa Chakra,

245
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:22,247
because they are all connected, the Vishuddhi, Hamsa and Virata.

246
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:26,966
They are all connected centers.

247
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:34,689
It’s not only that the Virata improves, but Vishuddhi improves and Hamsa.

248
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:42,124
So now what happens that you jump into collectivity.

249
00:24:42,702 --> 00:24:48,478
And the love and the affection and the understanding

250
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:56,821
that you have for each other is remarkable, is very enjoyable and very beautiful.

251
00:24:58,023 --> 00:25:04,503
So all that happens, absolutely happens in your brain.

252
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:15,230
That’s how your brain, which is the one which receives all the information

253
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:19,121
and creates all the information,

254
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:26,379
creates all the mental projections becomes a new vehicle

255
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,674
to create a dimension which goes higher, not declining.

256
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:38,572
All of you are part and parcel of that, all of you

257
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:43,862
are part and parcel of that and all of you are important.

258
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:50,621
All of you have to support that, all of you have to raise it. It is very important;

259
00:25:50,702 --> 00:25:57,572
you all should understand your own responsibility.

260
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:05,582
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment, all the subtleties

261
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:12,400
of the brain and the knowledge starts manifesting and expressing itself.

262
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:16,806
But the greatest thing that happens, that integration takes place in your brain.

263
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:21,416
It’s not that your heart wants one thing and your brain wants another thing.

264
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:25,158
The integration takes place. And when that integration takes place

265
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:28,901
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

266
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:35,681
Even without thinking about it, without
reading about it, you just become dharmic.

267
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:40,215
You are not to be told that you have to
be dharmic. Innately you become dharmic

268
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:46,502
because your brain, which normally is used for rationality,

269
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:53,706
for justifying all that is wrong, becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

270
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:59,071
So this is what one has to realize, that after realization

271
00:26:59,152 --> 00:27:02,936
a person gets ideas which are always constructive.

272
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:06,882
And if they are not, then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

273
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:13,069
Constructive and dharmic - that is very, very important for us

274
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:18,866
to understand, where is our mind going? Is it contradicting,

275
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:24,501
it is telling something else than what it is?

276
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:29,212
We have to just keep a-watch and you’ll be amazed to see

277
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:33,744
how your brain has changed its ways.

278
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:37,821
The upside brain has become normal.

279
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:46,978
This you can get very easily if you just meditate every day

280
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:53,203
and see for yourself how the expression of your Sahastrara

281
00:27:53,284 --> 00:28:00,209
is penetrating into your being and is acting in your life.

282
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,688
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

283
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:11,053
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,
and others will never doubt you.

284
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,860
May God bless you.
