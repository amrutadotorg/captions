WEBVTT

00:02.660 --> 00:05.662
You have come here to learn

00:05.662 --> 00:09.815
something, to go deep into your experiences

00:09.815 --> 00:16.664
of the knowledge of your roots.

00:16.664 --> 00:21.873
Shri Krishna has said that this is

00:21.873 --> 00:25.616
a tree which is upside down, the

00:25.616 --> 00:29.604
roots are upwards and the

00:29.604 --> 00:32.563
leaves are outwards.

00:32.563 --> 00:35.313
In the same way, you

00:35.313 --> 00:38.772
know that Kundalini, really, when

00:38.772 --> 00:42.498
it rises in the Sahasrara or above

00:42.498 --> 00:45.763
Sahasrara, then you start getting the

00:45.763 --> 00:51.156
feeling of Kundalini. So, one has to

00:51.156 --> 00:55.150
understand that when we are now getting

00:55.150 --> 00:58.204
subtler and subtler and trying to

00:58.204 --> 01:00.766
feel the Kundalini, we should try to

01:00.766 --> 01:05.971
get out of materialistic attitude and

01:05.971 --> 01:09.036
materialistic viewpoint and materialistic

01:09.036 --> 01:13.225
sticking point. I had met one

01:13.225 --> 01:15.694
guru before, because you know I went

01:15.694 --> 01:18.498
to all of them. And I asked one of

01:18.498 --> 01:21.432
them, I said, why do you take money,

01:21.432 --> 01:24.441
so much money from these people who

01:24.441 --> 01:27.497
are western people? So much, why do you

01:27.497 --> 01:30.659
take and just they become beggars,
absolutely, like beggars they become

01:30.659 --> 01:33.694
because you charge them so much and

01:33.694 --> 01:38.487
so heavily? And he told me that unless

01:38.487 --> 01:40.715
and until you make them beggars

01:40.715 --> 01:43.244
they will never take to God. They are

01:43.244 --> 01:46.335
too rich to be near God. I mean,

01:46.335 --> 01:49.894
this explanation I just could not

01:49.894 --> 01:53.154
understand. It was absurd, I could not

01:53.154 --> 01:58.896
understand: How can this explanation
have any proper meaning that you should

01:58.896 --> 02:01.888
make people beggars and
then they be nearer to God?

02:01.888 --> 02:04.205
I said, in India we have
many beggars; do you think

02:04.205 --> 02:08.085
those beggars are nearer to God??So he

02:08.085 --> 02:10.335
said, 揘o, otherwise, you see, they get

02:10.335 --> 02:12.718
stuck up with their money and you

02:12.718 --> 02:16.055
must just make them absolutely without

02:16.055 --> 02:19.327
any money, moneyless people.

02:19.327 --> 02:27.120
So, I mean, of course to such a
stupid person what can you talk?

02:27.120 --> 02:28.750
What can you convince?

02:28.750 --> 02:34.346
I couldn't say to him, then
why are you taking the money, if you are?

02:34.346 --> 02:39.411
Then he would have said,
because I am detached.?

02:39.411 --> 02:46.003
You see, anything one can say like that. If you
start like that, you cannot just stop it.

02:46.003 --> 02:51.945
But one has to understand that
materialism has gone into our roots.

02:51.945 --> 02:57.477
And if we have to clear out our roots
we must get out of materialism.

02:57.477 --> 03:01.316
That's important, but that does not
in any way mean that you torture your

03:01.316 --> 03:03.527
body or anything, I dont mean that.

03:03.527 --> 03:06.377
But what Iam saying, your attention.

03:06.377 --> 03:11.370
[Shri Mataji addresses some
children] you shouldn't do like that.

03:11.396 --> 03:15.326
Always Natali you get up which you know is not
good.Always disturb is not good.Sit Down.

03:15.326 --> 03:17.778
Now even if there are so many
childrens sitting down here.

03:17.778 --> 03:20.912
Please sit down and dont
disturb any more sit down.

03:20.912 --> 03:24.179
Sonu come and sit here. Sonu come here.Better....
and then she gets the diarrhea always.

03:31.708 --> 03:44.993
You are not here just to enjoy but you are here for a
puja do you understand that. You are grown up girl now.

03:45.019 --> 04:23.109
Look at all these children's how they are sitting quitely.Will they move out? they don't understand English.I have seen all our English children whether it is in Caxton hall or whether it is any hall all of them must go out and
make a big noise and play there. It's always seen they cannot sit down. Look at them these children how quitely they are sitting. What a quality it is! They are just feeling the vibrations and they are enjoying it. They dont want

04:23.135 --> 05:39.616
to go out.There is no enjoyment outside. Its inside. See them. See the contrast.You must keep eyes open to see. See our children. Now Linda is there she will tell you. She has to manage the children outside the caxton hall.They are shouting,screaming and the caxton hall people will always tell me that its better not have childrens for your program because they make suchh a lot of noise. Its very common problem. They have atleast told me 10 times that please
don't allow children to come in. But the children will never sit quitely even for 5 minutes. As soon as 5 min. will start they will say lets go out.. They can't sit quitely. Poor Sonu whenever she goes out she gets a diarrhea. .....All right Orea you sit somewhere out from there separately. You also.You have only here 3 childrens and you will always see them walking about. and another is Mathews where is he? I have to keep eye on them. It's dangerous.

05:41.202 --> 05:45.537
So now, when we are
dealing with our

05:46.248 --> 05:50.950
roots we have to be in the centre.

05:50.950 --> 05:55.864
In the core. In the core mean we are

05:55.864 --> 06:00.866
taking in, sucking in the feeling

06:00.866 --> 06:03.116
or you can say the?

06:03.100 --> 06:10.671
Feeling and awareness put together, what do you
say to that in English, is there any word?

06:10.671 --> 06:14.936
Is there any word which makes
awareness and feeling put together?

06:14.936 --> 06:20.197
Is there Gavin?

06:20.197 --> 06:23.519
[answer: Experience]

06:23.519 --> 06:26.036
Oh, yeah, experience, you can say the

06:26.078 --> 06:29.789
experience into your awareness and feeling.

06:29.789 --> 06:34.517
You have to get the experience
into your awareness and feeling.

06:34.517 --> 06:38.218
In Marathi it is a very simple word janiv

06:38.218 --> 06:40.495
comes from the word ja.

06:40.495 --> 06:45.955
Ja comes the word spontaneous.

06:45.955 --> 06:48.608
Also ja has two meanings:

06:48.608 --> 06:57.274
Ja also means dnyana, awareness, and
also it means spontaneous. Janiv.

06:57.274 --> 07:07.638
So you start sucking that within yourself, when
you are not entangled into other things.

07:07.638 --> 07:12.538
If your attention is entangled
outside, you cannot enjoy.

07:12.538 --> 07:16.827
So, to be lost into which is
samaadhi you see, is the one where

07:16.827 --> 07:21.402
your attention is completely
drowned into the experience.

07:21.402 --> 07:25.028
That iswhat we have to achieve.

07:25.028 --> 07:29.817
So it is  not only materialism: also emotionalism, all kinds of "isms".

07:29.817 --> 07:33.159
We are attacked by all kind of isms?

07:33.159 --> 07:40.282
since the history of word started in this
world I think and now the unholy thing that

07:40.282 --> 07:46.034
the ism? latest is, could be sahaja
Yoga-ism?

07:46.034 --> 07:52.712
also could be the greatest word because now
there has to be an attack on Sahaja Yoga also.

07:52.712 --> 08:02.004
In this one is that as I told you, I didnt explain
it properly or you didnt hear Me properly that day,

08:02.004 --> 08:15.413
that Sahaja Yoga does not mean lethargy or
slowness, not at all, but is a quick and a fast

08:15.413 --> 08:20.048
stepping in into the dissolution.

08:20.048 --> 08:23.110
Very quick.

08:23.110 --> 08:27.005
And once you very quickly

08:27.005 --> 08:29.955
dissolve into it, the whole movement

08:29.955 --> 08:31.797
of your body is quick but not jerky,

08:31.797 --> 08:39.647
is smooth and quick. Rhythmic. Is musical,

08:39.647 --> 08:42.813
neither is awkward nor lethargic,

08:42.813 --> 08:45.889
but is musical. It has a rhythm about

08:45.889 --> 08:49.852
it. Is very gracious.

08:49.852 --> 08:54.442
The whole movement of dissolution can happen

08:54.442 --> 08:59.687
to you very easily if you don't allow

08:59.687 --> 09:07.014
your attention to be attacked by all these "isms."

09:07.014 --> 09:08.543
There is no end to it.

09:08.543 --> 09:12.793
I mean, if I have to write all of them I
think we will have to need at least one book

09:12.793 --> 09:18.878
to write all the ism's of the world, there
is no end to it, which we have created.

09:18.878 --> 09:23.185
Then the worst of all is now,
I think, Sahaja Yoga-ism

09:23.185 --> 09:30.432
in which first of all is
the feeling of lethargy:

09:30.432 --> 09:35.615
"It will happen Sahaja. Sit down,
Mother will do everything for you."

09:35.615 --> 09:38.834
Another is Sahaja Yoga-egoism

09:38.834 --> 09:42.604
in which we haven't got one fellow lying there.

09:42.604 --> 09:50.758
In which people, Sahaja Yogis, get into tantrums, try
to show off that they are great Sahaja Yogis.

09:50.758 --> 09:56.686
they have reached the third stage
or the seventh stage or whatever they may be.

09:56.686 --> 10:02.434
Now it's good this example is a very
good example, I wish you had taken up.

10:02.434 --> 10:08.875
But see the expression of the Indian,

10:08.875 --> 10:11.359
the enamoured expressions. You see, it

10:11.359 --> 10:15.329
so genuine, they can't control within themselves, seeing Me.

10:15.329 --> 10:22.688
Now, see, it's like, I just don't know, but people
think it's a package deal sort of a thing.

10:22.688 --> 10:26.114
It's so nonsensical, I tell you. That either

10:26.114 --> 10:28.274
they could be taken out all their money

10:28.274 --> 10:33.631
or if they are to be told now for puja.
All of them are paying twenty-one

10:33.631 --> 10:39.167
because they have to do this or this extra work, so
they are charging twenty-one.

10:39.167 --> 10:42.981
And if you tell them [it’s] for puja they
will even give them fifty-one.

10:42.981 --> 10:51.183
But I have told some of you have even refused
that. I mean it's so shameful, I tell you!

10:51.183 --> 10:55.855
It's absolutely shameful! Can you imagine?

10:55.855 --> 10:58.016
What is twenty-one rupees to you?

10:58.016 --> 11:05.662
To them it's quite a lot, because it's some sort of
part of you you are giving which is so nonsensical.

11:05.662 --> 11:14.598
Just is a feeling. Is a sign of complete negativity. Left Nabhi.

11:14.598 --> 11:18.202
It's a problem. Materialism
it's complete materialism.

11:18.202 --> 11:26.299
Those who have been, say, doing
vegetarianism are materialists in India,

11:26.299 --> 11:35.071
we have seen the cases, like you see the Jains
and the Marvari and the Gujaratis.

11:35.071 --> 11:40.925
They are all vegetarians, supposed to be compassionate people.

11:40.925 --> 11:46.573
They build some temples also and sometimes
they give to poor people also and

11:46.573 --> 11:50.562
sometimes to people like Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna
who are begging in India.

11:50.562 --> 11:54.897
They give money to them. Supposed to be very compassionate

11:54.897 --> 11:59.252
They are more compassionate to
chickens than to human beings.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.741
We have that kind.

12:01.741 --> 12:08.650
And the same kind I have seen in the
West also. Such materialistic people,

12:08.650 --> 12:15.620
I mean, they have no shame.
So when you just turn and

12:15.646 --> 12:22.227
see that, should abhor that.
Abhor it. It's shameful!

12:22.290 --> 12:25.555
How could you be like that even
in Sahaja Yoga?

12:25.597 --> 12:31.143
So as I have told you, there are
some people who are materialistic,

12:31.143 --> 12:37.815
some people who are emotionalistic
and some people who are egoistic.

12:37.815 --> 12:43.121
Now leave all these things on the
sides, then you come in the centre.

12:43.121 --> 12:46.163
Now you are in the centre.

12:46.163 --> 12:54.027
In the centre, people enjoy just the love
of their Mother, like Shri Ganesha does.

12:54.027 --> 13:01.872
Just think how your Mother loves you. Finished!
Can you? It’s a very sweet feeling

13:01.872 --> 13:05.188
And who is your Mother if you
really believe in Her, in Sahaja

13:05.188 --> 13:11.608
Yoga, these two things should solve the problem.
No more thinking.

13:11.608 --> 13:14.139
Just think how much your Mother loves.

13:14.186 --> 13:22.655
That means you are jumping onto My Kundalini
and when you jump onto My Kundalini,

13:22.655 --> 13:29.043
then there is no thought.
You cannot think.

13:29.043 --> 13:37.162
When you think that, how much your Mother loves
you, you are jumping onto My Kundalini. And

13:37.162 --> 13:40.456
that time, there is no thought.

13:40.456 --> 13:43.795
It is very simple to
meditate in Sahaja Yoga

13:43.795 --> 13:46.535
because you have somebody in person.

13:46.535 --> 13:49.847
They never had somebody in person.

13:49.918 --> 13:52.308
So I can understand their problems-

13:52.348 --> 13:54.525
there was nobody in person;

13:54.567 --> 13:58.240
they had to do it in the air.

13:58.240 --> 14:04.625
But here a sure-shot thing:
you can feel your vibrations

14:04.625 --> 14:14.973
you can feel My love and you
can feel your own quality.

14:14.973 --> 14:21.456
It's very simple.

14:21.456 --> 14:29.610
But it's not the love that is selfish, it's not the love where you

14:29.610 --> 14:33.074
say, Oh Mother loves me so She look after me,
She will do everything for me,

14:33.074 --> 14:37.994
She is going to do
everything.

14:37.994 --> 14:43.570
It's the love that other loves me so much,
what can I do for Her?

14:43.570 --> 14:49.304
Which is the best flower I can give to my Mother?

14:49.304 --> 14:52.103
What does She need? She needs nothing.

14:52.103 --> 14:58.986
She doesn't need money, She doesn't need anything.
What can I give Her?

14:58.986 --> 15:01.582
Which is the best flower

15:01.582 --> 15:09.754
Like Shri Hanuman was given a gold necklace by Shri Sitaji.

15:09.754 --> 15:14.657
And He saw that, and He was sitting on a tree and

15:14.657 --> 15:24.411
He was breaking one by one all of those
big-big gold balls of His necklace.

15:24.411 --> 15:28.119
So Sitaji said, what are you doing?

15:28.119 --> 15:33.623
He said, "I am trying to see in these balls where is Ram."

15:33.623 --> 15:41.983
He said, none of them has, so I am just breaking
them to find out. Otherwise why should I wear it?

15:41.983 --> 15:45.256
And then She said, "Really? Where is Ram?"

15:45.256 --> 15:52.659
He opened His chest. He said,
see in My chest. He exists there.

15:52.659 --> 15:57.893
So it is never a one-sided sort
of a thing. It is a thing that

15:57.893 --> 16:02.231
exists within you and you feel that
and then has to be reciprocal.

16:02.231 --> 16:14.959
In the water, if there is a ripple it goes
to the shores and then it returns back.

16:14.959 --> 16:23.880
So with this force only, I tell you, you
can conquer your ego and superego.

16:23.880 --> 16:29.969
There is no way out.

16:29.969 --> 16:35.835
And for these Indians it is very easy to do because they

16:35.835 --> 16:41.096
know their Mother's love.

16:41.096 --> 16:46.060
I know there has been an attack on that point and

16:46.060 --> 16:48.176
the mothers have been funny there.

16:48.176 --> 16:53.192
But doesn't matter; when you see
something, just put yourself to it.

16:53.192 --> 16:58.148
To feel your roots.

16:58.148 --> 17:03.248
These are your roots. And then you see the enjoyment.

17:03.248 --> 17:06.795
The Mother Earth Herself
is sucking you now.

17:06.795 --> 17:13.612
She is sucking you down.

17:13.612 --> 17:16.061
That is how you meditate now.

17:16.104 --> 17:21.871
This is how you have to meditate, and it's
such a security giving thing.

17:21.871 --> 17:25.963
It will change your expressions, faces, everything.

17:25.963 --> 17:38.170
And that enamoured expressions that you find in these
people will be on your face very soon

17:38.170 --> 17:47.100
And complete silence will exist once you come on My Kundalini.

17:47.100 --> 17:59.173
But not through your mental projections, but
through your meditative, spontaneous experience.

17:59.173 --> 18:02.863
It's very joygiving.

18:02.863 --> 18:05.712
Just feel the joy of that.

18:05.712 --> 18:13.976
You are all with Me here and the joy of that
feeling will really enlarge your hearts,

18:13.976 --> 18:19.704
and then, then you can give it to others.

18:19.704 --> 18:23.200
You don't have to be crazy about these things,

18:23.200 --> 18:31.672
but just to feel it within yourself.

18:31.672 --> 18:37.821
All right. Now I move on to Indians because

18:37.821 --> 18:41.927
they are a different style of people.

18:41.927 --> 18:46.582
May God bless you!

18:46.582 --> 18:48.793
(Marathi talk)

31:38.749 --> 31:40.759
Now, I was telling them, I must

31:40.759 --> 31:46.184
translate it to you in English is the
most important point

31:46.184 --> 31:51.759
I was telling that now you are transformed,
now you have become saints, no doubt of it.

31:51.759 --> 31:54.678
Now from an egg you have become a bird,

31:54.678 --> 32:01.020
but, now what should happen to you?
Your Kundalini is still in the sacrum.

32:01.020 --> 32:06.260
How it has happened that now you
have got all the Ganesha Shakti?

32:06.260 --> 32:12.872
I have made you like Ganesha, in the same
pattern as I had made Ganesha you are made.

32:12.739 --> 32:20.725
Now you have become a Ganesha,
and from this Ganesha stage,

32:20.725 --> 32:30.109
which you think you are a Ganesha now,
if I offer you a throne of Shri Ganesha,

32:30.109 --> 32:35.649
if you have to sit on that throne
as a king, then what should happen?

32:35.649 --> 32:40.922
Actually, that now your Kundalini should
not be anymore in the sacrum bone,

32:40.922 --> 32:46.013
but in your stomach, because Ganesha's
Kundalini is in the stomach.

32:46.013 --> 32:49.276
In the stomach means in the Nabhi Chakra.

32:49.276 --> 32:55.862
Means all your seeking has been
so far in materialism,

32:55.862 --> 33:01.566
has been in other things like in money, or in

33:01.566 --> 33:05.964
power or in love or whatever it was.

33:05.964 --> 33:11.295
But now your Kundalini itself
is in the Nabhi Chakra, means

33:11.295 --> 33:16.187
your seeking is nothing but
itself has become the Kundalini.

33:16.187 --> 33:22.514
Your seeking has become the Kundalini,
means that you are the giver,

33:22.514 --> 33:26.425
now you are the Guru, you have
now become the Guru.

33:26.425 --> 33:32.386
When the Kundalini starts from the Nabhi
that means now you are the Guru,

33:32.386 --> 33:38.746
now you have to give all the
blessings,everything, as a Guru does.

33:38.746 --> 33:41.285
Now you all have become Gurus.

33:41.285 --> 33:44.355
But that's only possible when the Kundalini has risen,

33:44.355 --> 33:50.301
has lifted Her abode from the sacrum
to the stomach,

33:50.301 --> 33:55.716
and this stage, unless and until it has
arrived, you are not a confirmed Guru.

33:55.716 --> 33:58.983
Once that has happened you
become a Guru and then

33:58.983 --> 34:05.047
you can really impress
people and work it out.

34:05.047 --> 34:07.267
It has to be done very fast.

34:07.267 --> 34:11.019
It has to work out very fast
and for that, first of all,

34:11.019 --> 34:14.474
please get rid of your
entanglements which are stupid.

34:14.474 --> 34:18.330
If you really believe that you
have to progress in your seeking,

34:18.330 --> 34:23.261
that you have to have your Kundalini
coming up from your Nabhi,

34:23.261 --> 34:31.060
then please, please hurry up, please try to
work out, otherwise you are very few who

34:31.060 --> 34:39.938
have been given also the privilege of
doing My Puja, very few.

34:39.938 --> 34:43.201
And those who have been given have a chance

34:43.201 --> 34:46.213
to develop to that stage, and
once you become that, all

34:46.213 --> 34:51.777
of you who have achieved that
stage can become the Gurus.

34:51.777 --> 34:55.412
And for that, you have to have only wisdom.

34:55.412 --> 34:58.621
Wisdom, keep to your wisdom,

34:58.621 --> 35:04.289
and like Shri Ganesha has His
wisdom and in that wisdom He knew

35:04.289 --> 35:07.411
one thing: that His Mother was all powerful

35:07.411 --> 35:11.952
and that He doesn't have to worship
anybody else but His Mother.

35:11.952 --> 35:17.116
And He has to have all the
powers which are granted by Her.

35:17.116 --> 35:22.994
His powers, no one, even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha does not have.

35:22.994 --> 35:24.914
They cannot reach Ganesha;

35:24.914 --> 35:28.699
They cannot reach His stage because
They are one-sided but

35:28.699 --> 35:32.669
Shri Ganesha has all the powers,
all the Chaitanya powers He has.

35:32.669 --> 35:36.640
So to become like that, to be like
that,He should be your ideal:

35:36.640 --> 35:43.338
how He behaved and how He would sacrifice
anything for the sake of Mother.

35:43.338 --> 35:49.904
Here there are people who don't even
want to pay for something like a puja and ..stuff

35:49.904 --> 35:54.298
which you may just spend away
somewhere in nonsensical things,

35:54.298 --> 35:58.379
because your attention has to
be brought round completely.

35:58.379 --> 36:04.601
It has to be completely severed from
all these nonsensical entanglements

36:04.601 --> 36:09.058
and there should be less talking and more experiencing.

36:09.058 --> 36:13.188
Then only it's going to work out.

36:13.188 --> 36:21.830
It's a good pleasure and a great
thing to be here in this holy land,

36:21.830 --> 36:25.295
it's a very holy place
you can see it, so peaceful.

36:25.295 --> 36:28.221
Try to feel the peace within yourself that

36:28.221 --> 36:31.839
is within every human being and after

36:31.839 --> 36:33.803
that you have to know that this

36:33.803 --> 36:37.722
peace that you are achieving
has to be given to others.

36:37.722 --> 36:43.157
In Sahaja Yoga, perhaps you have realized,
whatever you have got from the nature,

36:43.157 --> 36:45.774
you can release it back.

36:45.774 --> 36:50.964
For example if you give vibrations
to a plant you can make it grow.

36:50.964 --> 36:56.739
If you give vibrations to a flower
you can make it sustain its life.

36:56.739 --> 36:59.986
For the first time you are giving
something to the nature,

36:59.986 --> 37:03.762
but as soon as you grow up to that state of a

37:03.762 --> 37:06.657
Guru then you can give the peace

37:06.657 --> 37:13.917
that is in the nature, you can give the
feeling of bliss that is in the nature.

37:13.917 --> 37:17.184
But first achieve it within yourself.

37:17.184 --> 37:23.772
Make this go inside you and see
that bliss settle down within you.

37:23.772 --> 37:27.441
You don't see other nonsensical
things which are very disturbing

37:27.441 --> 37:29.532
sometimes to your western mind.

37:29.532 --> 37:36.696
For example if a telephone is not working or the road is not all right, if the
bathroom is not this.

37:36.696 --> 37:43.066
These nonsensical things have no meaning, but
feel the peace outside,

37:43.066 --> 37:52.194
try to establish that peace within because
this peace you have to give to others.

37:52.194 --> 37:56.322
The whole development plan
that I have is very fast

37:56.322 --> 37:59.101
and I am sure you will keep pace with me.

37:59.101 --> 38:00.172
So may God bless you!

38:00.172 --> 38:07.079
When you sit down just feel the peace and
try to achieve that peace within yourself.

38:07.079 --> 38:12.001
Don't pay attention to nonsensical
things and this with this your little

38:12.001 --> 38:16.790
brain trying to criticize, but try to
achieve the peace within yourself so

38:16.790 --> 38:20.168
that you can give peace to others.

38:20.168 --> 38:26.324
It's not proper that some of you are looking after
the negative people all the time, it's not proper.

38:26.324 --> 38:28.189
You don't have to look
after the negative people.

38:28.189 --> 38:29.812
Just leave them alone.

38:29.812 --> 38:34.265
Keep out of that because negative
people can always bring you down.

38:34.265 --> 38:39.156
Don't try to improve the conditions of the
negative, leave them behind. You go fast.

38:39.156 --> 38:45.069
Once you have achieved that state
then we can arrange for them to come.

38:45.069 --> 38:49.113
For example, if My car has failed, all
right, I got into another car, which

38:49.113 --> 38:51.685
was all right because I have to come to the program.

38:51.685 --> 38:55.107
Then I can send the tempo
from here to get that another

38:55.107 --> 38:59.912
car where there were some people who
were not supposed to be at the program.

38:59.912 --> 39:04.031
That's how you have to be quick and
not bother your heads too much

39:04.031 --> 39:08.368
about the negative people who are sick
people, trying to be compassionate.

39:08.368 --> 39:09.353
There is no need.

39:09.353 --> 39:10.866
Tell them, tell Mother.

39:10.866 --> 39:12.360
Let you talk to Mother.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.898
Look after yourselves and
don't be bothered about them.

39:15.898 --> 39:19.197
This is another nonsensical
idea of compassion you have got.

39:19.197 --> 39:22.252
Compassion is not mental projection I told you:

39:22.252 --> 39:25.024
the compassion that works, that flows.

39:25.024 --> 39:28.996
It's all mental you see for us
compassion is mental, every idea,

39:28.996 --> 39:34.591
peace is mental, bliss is mental, God
is mental, everything is mental for us.

39:34.591 --> 39:41.260
He is not. He is the one that
resides in the heart as Spirit.

39:41.260 --> 39:43.858
He is the one who works
through the compassion.

39:43.858 --> 39:49.980
And now you know My compassion is
that it flows, it works, it acts.

39:49.980 --> 39:54.898
It's not mental.

39:54.898 --> 40:00.475
So don't try to be mentally concerned
with people and try to be compassionate.

40:00.475 --> 40:01.448
All right?

40:01.448 --> 40:05.944
I hope you understand that the
compassion is not a mental idea

40:05.944 --> 40:10.416
that we are compassionate, we are working
for the unity of the world.And all that.

40:10.416 --> 40:15.963
Even unity and all those ideas, even
the idea of collective understanding

40:15.963 --> 40:20.428
is in the heart, it should work.

40:20.428 --> 40:23.972
In Sanskrit it is Kaaryanvit.

40:23.972 --> 40:27.175
In English there is no word. Kaaryanvit

40:27.175 --> 40:30.066
is embodied with the working capacity,

40:30.066 --> 40:32.917
embodied with the working out capacity

40:32.917 --> 40:35.953
actually working out capacity
you can translate like that.

40:35.953 --> 40:36.993
It should work.

40:36.993 --> 40:41.345
If it does not work out then what's the use
of looking after somebody who is sick?

40:41.345 --> 40:46.194
all right, come along This is
nonsense, this is very mental.

40:46.194 --> 40:54.438
Just don't waste your energy; you have
not come here to look after the sick.

40:54.438 --> 41:01.469
I hope you understand this idea of looking after the
sick and being very

41:01.469 --> 41:04.734
is all ego-oriented, see we are trying to help the sick,

41:04.734 --> 41:08.603
we are trying to help this, that,?all ego-oriented.

41:08.603 --> 41:13.199
Another superego-oriented that we
are sacrificing this and that and

41:13.199 --> 41:18.265
we are becoming beggars in India like the
Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna. Beggars, parasites.

41:18.265 --> 41:21.804
Both are just the same, now
please don't do all these things

41:21.804 --> 41:31.321
and try to keep yourself glued to one ideal:

41:31.321 --> 41:34.735
that you have to ascend faster.

41:34.735 --> 41:41.148
You have to individually ascend faster
and collectively pull out everyone

41:41.148 --> 41:45.876
but not those who are heavily
laden with problems and

41:45.876 --> 41:49.282
who are creating problems and
objecting your progress.

41:49.282 --> 41:53.115
That doesn't mean that you are
not compassionate.

41:53.115 --> 41:59.249
You know how much compassion that I have but
My compassion doesn't make stories,

41:59.249 --> 42:02.310
I am so compassionate and I am this and that.

42:02.330 --> 42:07.581
Up to a point is all right but don't so too much
bother about people who are dragging you behind.

42:07.581 --> 42:10.091
You have come here for a training,

42:10.091 --> 42:18.440
a training into the understanding
of awareness which is compassion.

42:18.440 --> 42:22.671
You all have to, even, when you go to the
school, you are not bothered about a person

42:22.671 --> 42:26.328
who is lacking in the
class, do you?

42:26.328 --> 42:29.086
You want to study fast so that you come up well.

42:29.086 --> 42:32.539
In the same way, I would
request you not to bother your

42:32.539 --> 42:36.552
heads too much about people who
are trying to pull you down

42:36.552 --> 42:39.478
because I don't want you to be pulled down.

42:39.478 --> 42:45.710
That's My compassion for them and for you.

42:45.710 --> 42:48.630
Let Me look after them and you just
don't worry your heads about them.

42:48.630 --> 42:51.693
They will be all right.

42:51.693 --> 42:52.849
So, may God bless you!

42:52.849 --> 42:59.919
Lets have a puja today, and
this puja will be simple today.

42:59.919 --> 43:05.580
I think we will have Ganesha's Puja and
then we will have Devi's Puja today,

43:05.659 --> 43:12.286
and then we will have a good havan.
That is a good place for havan.
