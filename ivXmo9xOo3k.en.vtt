00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.320
I talk to them in Marathi language,  because here

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.920
so many of them don´t understand any other language but Marathi.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.280
Today is the day of Gauri Puja.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:12.480
Gauri is the one who, as a Virgin, created Shri Ganesha.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.400
And in the same pattern you have got your realization.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.200
In the same pattern!

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.680
So you have to use the same power within you that is of Gauri,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.840
that you keep your heart clean. You must have a clean heart.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.280
You must have a clean thinking.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.400
There should be purity in your mind.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.200
Of course, the bhakti does  give that purity,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.560
but if there is anything lingering in your mind

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.240
I have to tell you there are three things

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.000
that are going to happen from today.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.680
First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.600
You are under the

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.160
vision of Shri Ganesh,

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.000
under the guidance of your Spirit,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.440
and under the blessings of God Almighty.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.120
But be careful, because once you become that,

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.640
you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.800
If you are dishonest from today onwards

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.920
you be careful, anything can happen to you

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.319
if you get out of the maryadas.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.120
Till you keep the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.760
evening, night that: “I am a Sahaja Yogi”,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
nobody can harm you, hurt you. Nobody can trouble you.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.760
On the contrary you will be enjoying life

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.440
if you keep to the maryadas.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.319
But if you leave the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.920
you will have big problems.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.880
So this is the second thing I want to tell you

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.440
that today we have started the great vision,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.960
which was promised long time back of realized souls.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:19.400
Now the third is that

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.640
with all these things we are doing,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.240
we must promise to God also

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.480
that we will know about Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.640
through proper understanding, reading every word of it.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.800
We'll master the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.120
We’ll keep ourselves clean.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:48.360
And completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.640
This is what you have to promise in your heart.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.960
Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy,

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.680
bliss and peace.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.520
In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.600
This is how today we have to decide once for all.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.440
Today is the day as you know, my forefathers

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.080
called it the first day of the year(*).

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.320
and they have the kailasha and the shawl of the Goddess

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.040
as the emblem

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.680
or you can call it as a flag of Shalivahan.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.880
In any way my delay is important because

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.440
there was Amavasya (last lunar day of dark fortnight) earlier,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.560
and we had to get rid of that Amavasya for the first day to start.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.720
That's how the delay was there,

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.560
there was jam, everything is arranged.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.200
We should not worry: “Why there is delay, why there is this?”

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.440
Sometimes I may come earlier, I may come later, it's all arranged.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.720
Because during Amavasya how can you have my puja?

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.840
Simple thing like that. It is all arranged, it's all worked out.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.240
Everything is fine, just be your Self.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.560
Do not get upset with anything, do not get worried or anything.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.480
Just try to keep absolutely peaceful.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.680
I´ll  give you some tests by seeing

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.560
how much you keep to that situation,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.880
of complete peace within yourself.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.680
If you have done no wrong, if you are a Sahaja yogi,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.880
there should be no disturbance.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.360
If others have done wrong, it's alright,

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.680
doesn't matter, you have not done anything wrong

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.520
As long as you have done no wrong there is nothing to worry.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.120
And as it is, even if you have done some wrong,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.960
God is there to forgive you.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.280
So don't have any worry, nothing. Have all the strength,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.840
have all the courage and go ahead with this promise onwards.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.040
Because I see now Sahaja Yoga is going to take a new turn.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.160
Definitely it is going to take.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.040
We are going to come up to a stage

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:59.280
where thousands and thousands will join hands.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.640
But first of all those who are in the foundations,

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.160
who are the first people

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:08.960
must work very hard to keep themselves above

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.640
all kinds of foolish temptations

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.280
all kinds of foolish things you have been doing,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.200
which is asahaja (not Sahaja).

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.760
Language should be sweet, your behavior should be good,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.920
it should be very gentle and soft.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.840
You should move like a yogi, live like a saint,

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.240
and people should see through you the greatness of Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.120
May God bless you!
