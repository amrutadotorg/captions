14:56.240 --> 14:59.320
I talk to them in Marathi language,  because here

14:59.560 --> 15:03.920
so many of them don´t understand any other language but Marathi.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.280
Today is the day of Gauri Puja.

15:06.520 --> 15:12.480
Gauri is the one who, as a Virgin, created Shri Ganesha.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.400
And in the same pattern you have got your realization.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.200
In the same pattern!

15:20.960 --> 15:25.680
So you have to use the same power within you that is of Gauri,

15:25.960 --> 15:29.840
that you keep your heart clean. You must have a clean heart.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.280
You must have a clean thinking.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.400
There should be purity in your mind.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.200
Of course, the bhakti does  give that purity,

15:40.400 --> 15:44.560
but if there is anything lingering in your mind

15:44.760 --> 15:46.240
I have to tell you there are three things

15:46.440 --> 15:49.000
that are going to happen from today.

15:49.240 --> 15:54.680
First, we have started Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

15:54.880 --> 15:59.600
You are under the

16:00.040 --> 16:04.160
vision of Shri Ganesh,

16:04.560 --> 16:08.000
under the guidance of your Spirit,

16:08.240 --> 16:11.440
and under the blessings of God Almighty.

16:11.760 --> 16:16.120
But be careful, because once you become that,

16:16.320 --> 16:20.640
you have to keep to that Dharma, you have to be honest about it.

16:21.120 --> 16:26.800
If you are dishonest from today onwards

16:28.200 --> 16:31.920
you be careful, anything can happen to you

16:32.200 --> 16:34.319
if you get out of the maryadas.

16:34.560 --> 16:39.120
Till you keep the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga, saying morning,

16:39.360 --> 16:43.760
evening, night that: “I am a Sahaja Yogi”,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
nobody can harm you, hurt you. Nobody can trouble you.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.760
On the contrary you will be enjoying life

16:49.000 --> 16:50.440
if you keep to the maryadas.

16:50.640 --> 16:55.319
But if you leave the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga,

16:56.120 --> 16:58.920
you will have big problems.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.880
So this is the second thing I want to tell you

17:02.160 --> 17:07.440
that today we have started the great vision,

17:07.680 --> 17:12.960
which was promised long time back of realized souls.

17:14.280 --> 17:19.400
Now the third is that

17:21.000 --> 17:24.640
with all these things we are doing,

17:24.920 --> 17:28.240
we must promise to God also

17:28.480 --> 17:30.480
that we will know about Sahaja Yoga,

17:30.680 --> 17:34.640
through proper understanding, reading every word of it.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.800
We'll master the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.120
We’ll keep ourselves clean.

17:42.360 --> 17:48.360
And completely surrender our lives to Sahaja Yoga.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.640
This is what you have to promise in your heart.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.960
Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy,

17:55.160 --> 17:57.680
bliss and peace.

17:58.240 --> 18:03.520
In that you are the gainer, nobody is a loser in it.

18:03.720 --> 18:08.600
This is how today we have to decide once for all.

18:09.480 --> 18:13.440
Today is the day as you know, my forefathers

18:13.880 --> 18:18.080
called it the first day of the year(*).

18:18.560 --> 18:23.320
and they have the kailasha and the shawl of the Goddess

18:23.560 --> 18:28.040
as the emblem

18:28.280 --> 18:32.680
or you can call it as a flag of Shalivahan.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.880
In any way my delay is important because

18:36.120 --> 18:37.440
there was Amavasya (last lunar day of dark fortnight) earlier,

18:37.680 --> 18:42.560
and we had to get rid of that Amavasya for the first day to start.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.720
That's how the delay was there,

18:44.920 --> 18:46.560
there was jam, everything is arranged.

18:46.760 --> 18:50.200
We should not worry: “Why there is delay, why there is this?”

18:50.480 --> 18:53.440
Sometimes I may come earlier, I may come later, it's all arranged.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.720
Because during Amavasya how can you have my puja?

18:56.960 --> 19:00.840
Simple thing like that. It is all arranged, it's all worked out.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.240
Everything is fine, just be your Self.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.560
Do not get upset with anything, do not get worried or anything.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.480
Just try to keep absolutely peaceful.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.680
I´ll  give you some tests by seeing

19:12.880 --> 19:15.560
how much you keep to that situation,

19:15.800 --> 19:17.880
of complete peace within yourself.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.680
If you have done no wrong, if you are a Sahaja yogi,

19:20.920 --> 19:21.880
there should be no disturbance.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.360
If others have done wrong, it's alright,

19:24.600 --> 19:26.680
doesn't matter, you have not done anything wrong

19:26.920 --> 19:29.520
As long as you have done no wrong there is nothing to worry.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.120
And as it is, even if you have done some wrong,

19:32.320 --> 19:33.960
God is there to forgive you.

19:34.200 --> 19:38.280
So don't have any worry, nothing. Have all the strength,

19:38.600 --> 19:43.840
have all the courage and go ahead with this promise onwards.

19:44.120 --> 19:48.040
Because I see now Sahaja Yoga is going to take a new turn.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.160
Definitely it is going to take.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.040
We are going to come up to a stage

19:53.280 --> 19:59.280
where thousands and thousands will join hands.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.640
But first of all those who are in the foundations,

20:01.840 --> 20:03.160
who are the first people

20:03.400 --> 20:08.960
must work very hard to keep themselves above

20:10.080 --> 20:12.640
all kinds of foolish temptations

20:12.840 --> 20:17.280
all kinds of foolish things you have been doing,

20:17.600 --> 20:19.200
which is asahaja (not Sahaja).

20:19.520 --> 20:23.760
Language should be sweet, your behavior should be good,

20:24.080 --> 20:26.920
it should be very gentle and soft.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.840
You should move like a yogi, live like a saint,

20:31.040 --> 20:35.240
and people should see through you the greatness of Sahaja Yoga.

20:35.520 --> 20:39.120
May God bless you!
