WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:08.700
The other day I told you about the instrument
that we have already within ourselves, for

00:08.700 --> 00:16.900
us to have our own Self-knowledge, which is
an actualisation, which is an experience,

00:16.900 --> 00:26.140
which is a happening by which we become That.

00:26.140 --> 00:34.180
It is the becoming, it is not any brain washing
or sermoning but it’s a becoming I’m talking

00:34.180 --> 00:35.180
about.

00:35.180 --> 00:46.390
When we say, we are the seekers of Truth,
how truthful are we about this seeking?

00:46.390 --> 00:49.489
This is one point we should try to understand.

00:49.489 --> 00:53.149
Are we really, genuinely seeking?

00:53.149 --> 01:05.140
Are we genuine about it, or we are doing it
because it’s nice to say that we are seeking

01:05.140 --> 01:09.780
the Truth?

01:09.780 --> 01:15.900
If you have to seek something genuine, you
have to be truthful yourself.

01:15.900 --> 01:22.720
This is one of the greatest hurdles in Sahaja
Yoga.

01:22.720 --> 01:31.900
Sahaja Yoga is a system by which you jump
into the Truth itself.

01:31.900 --> 01:41.680
You become the Truth, you don’t see the
Truth, you don’t understand the Truth, but

01:41.680 --> 01:46.320
you become the Truth.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.950
It is most amazing thing that human beings
don’t understand what to expect out of Truth.

01:52.950 --> 02:03.210
They are seeking Truth but they have no conception
about the absolute value of Truth.

02:03.210 --> 02:07.270
Truth, we cannot compromise.

02:07.270 --> 02:16.700
It doesn’t have two sides: like you have
day and night, you have right and wrong.

02:16.700 --> 02:20.200
It’s absolute!

02:20.200 --> 02:22.160
There is no compromise about it.

02:22.160 --> 02:30.030
For example, as the other day I told you that
when you get your realisation, you start feeling

02:30.030 --> 02:34.520
the cool vibrations flowing from your hand.

02:34.520 --> 02:42.010
And these cool vibrations are the indication
that the Divine power has started flowing

02:42.010 --> 02:43.760
through you.

02:43.760 --> 02:55.739
Now, these vibrations that you have are flowing
through you like a cool breeze, are absolutely

02:55.739 --> 03:05.430
genuine, they are much more genuine than genuineness,
because human beings always have relative

03:05.430 --> 03:07.780
idea of genuineness.

03:07.780 --> 03:16.569
For example, say, if you take carbon atom-
it can be placed in any way, it has got four

03:16.569 --> 03:24.209
valencies, but it can be placed any way in
a molecule.

03:24.209 --> 03:30.770
You can change the form of it, but still,
if you go to the details of it, the carbon

03:30.770 --> 03:35.060
will remain carbon.

03:35.060 --> 03:40.739
And a hydrogen will remain hydrogen, in its
basic structure.

03:40.739 --> 03:51.280
So, the Truth that is the basic thing, cannot
change.

03:51.280 --> 03:56.030
You cannot mould it, you cannot befool it,
you cannot act it.

03:56.030 --> 04:04.739
When these vibrations are flowing from you,
if there are no vibrations then you are not

04:04.739 --> 04:06.360
there.

04:06.360 --> 04:14.269
Nobody can say that you are there, that you
are a realised soul because you are carrying

04:14.269 --> 04:16.850
a big horn on your head.

04:16.850 --> 04:23.630
You may carry any signs and signatures saying
that you are a great person, you have so many

04:23.630 --> 04:28.169
following and there are so many people running
mad after you.

04:28.169 --> 04:31.509
But still you are not a realised soul and
you are not.

04:31.509 --> 04:38.279
Even if you are crucified and you are a realised
soul you can feel it that this one, the one

04:38.279 --> 04:47.639
whom we have crucified, is the one who is
emitting vibrations.

04:47.639 --> 04:55.909
But if the seeker is not truthful or is conditioned
and he’s trying to cheat himself all the

04:55.909 --> 05:01.119
time, he is not going to gain anything.

05:01.119 --> 05:04.159
In Sahaja Yoga you have to gain.

05:04.159 --> 05:10.169
Nobody else has to gain, it is you who has
to gain.

05:10.169 --> 05:15.419
So, you have to be genuine about it.

05:15.419 --> 05:20.279
You cannot purchase it with money.

05:20.279 --> 05:24.930
You cannot hide it by any false means.

05:24.930 --> 05:29.789
You cannot kill it.

05:29.789 --> 05:36.119
It is eternal.

05:36.119 --> 05:40.550
If you lose your vibrations in your hands-
many people have told Me that “Mother, we’ve

05:40.550 --> 05:42.840
lost the vibrations, now, what to do?”

05:42.840 --> 05:47.940
As if they have achieved something great by
losing the vibrations, sometimes I feel.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.639
It’s a mistake!

05:49.639 --> 05:55.699
There’s something wrong with you somewhere
which you must get it corrected.

05:55.699 --> 06:03.869
If you think by talking or by befooling, by
hiding things you are going to achieve anything,

06:03.869 --> 06:07.960
you are sadly mistaken.

06:07.960 --> 06:16.279
So, we have to be extremely truthful to ourselves,
we have not to cheat ourselves when we are

06:16.279 --> 06:20.699
facing God, when we are facing Truth.

06:20.699 --> 06:27.849
There are some people in this world who destroy
others and there are some who destroy themselves.

06:27.849 --> 06:35.360
In the same way, there are some people in
this world who cheat others and there are

06:35.360 --> 06:36.960
some who cheat themselves.

06:36.960 --> 06:45.029
There are so many things in this world which
helps you to do that – is to cheat yourself.

06:45.029 --> 06:48.089
So, be on the alert!

06:48.089 --> 06:57.919
Like you read some books- they pamper your
vanity, sometimes, pamper your ego and make

06:57.919 --> 07:02.969
you feel ‘Oh, I’m all right, I feel all
right!’

07:02.969 --> 07:08.949
And you think that you have really achieved
the goal that you wanted to, because certain

07:08.949 --> 07:12.419
books say ‘so, so, so, so…’

07:12.419 --> 07:20.229
Or maybe, somebody is a man who is not interested
in your well-being and your Truth-seeking,

07:20.229 --> 07:27.039
may give you an idea that ‘All right, this
is the Truth, all right!’

07:27.039 --> 07:38.960
So, you believe that this is the Truth and
you accept it, that this is the Truth.

07:38.960 --> 07:47.080
And with that kind of a conditioning, with
that kind of an idea within your head, you

07:47.080 --> 07:50.990
go ahead and carry on your life.

07:50.990 --> 07:53.580
One life, two lives, three lives…

07:53.580 --> 08:00.069
You are supposed to be a seeker of Truth!

08:00.069 --> 08:03.659
How many lives are you going to waste seeking?

08:03.659 --> 08:08.800
Are you really genuine about it?

08:08.800 --> 08:21.229
Or is it, because there is a fashion that
one has to talk like that or similar/ly?

08:21.229 --> 08:25.650
Of course, to cheat other is, of course, is
a sin, no doubt.

08:25.650 --> 08:38.879
But to cheat yourself, itself, is also a big
obstacle in the seeking of Truth.

08:38.879 --> 08:51.070
So, we have to realise that we are here to
face the Truth.

08:51.070 --> 08:58.680
And God has created us in such a way that
He has placed everything so beautifully within

08:58.680 --> 09:08.629
us for this thing to happen, for us to get
our Self-knowledge.

09:08.629 --> 09:15.990
You are not to go in wilderness to find it
out!

09:15.990 --> 09:20.150
You are not to read anything about it!

09:20.150 --> 09:26.240
Which university did Christ go to, or Krishna
go to?

09:26.240 --> 09:37.480
What education did Rama have as far as university
education is concerned?

09:37.480 --> 09:47.829
You have to read within yourself, your own
book is within yourself, and to see for yourself,

09:47.829 --> 09:54.680
in a very humble manner to understand, ‘Where
am I?’

09:54.680 --> 10:01.110
Sahaja Yoga is a system which says, ‘saha-ja’-
‘saha’ means ‘with’ and ‘ja’ is

10:01.110 --> 10:02.110
‘born’.

10:02.110 --> 10:04.420
It is born with you.

10:04.420 --> 10:10.199
Everything born with you is genuine.

10:10.199 --> 10:11.770
Do you know that?

10:11.770 --> 10:13.570
We do not know.

10:13.570 --> 10:16.689
Our hands are genuine- they never cheat us.

10:16.689 --> 10:20.779
Our feet are genuine- they never cheat, do
they?

10:20.779 --> 10:26.710
Our eyes are genuine: you see something white,
it looks white, it is white.

10:26.710 --> 10:31.340
Our eyes never tell us that it is black.

10:31.340 --> 10:45.170
Only when we are sick, then the whole composition
changes and you get all kinds of wrong information

10:45.170 --> 10:47.870
from this body of yours.

10:47.870 --> 11:03.839
Your heart is genuine, but we teach our heart
to cheat, we teach our eyes to cheat.

11:03.839 --> 11:15.020
We have pretensions and the Truth knows you.

11:15.020 --> 11:20.399
When I say this we should not have self-pity
about ourselves.

11:20.399 --> 11:25.620
It is never the way to go from one extreme
to another.

11:25.620 --> 11:30.379
This is a very common condition of human being.

11:30.379 --> 11:34.399
If you tell them one thing, they go from one
end to another end.

11:34.399 --> 11:48.699
No, you just stand in the centre and see for
yourself: How much genuine are we to receive

11:48.699 --> 11:52.120
the blessings of God?

11:52.120 --> 12:03.740
Are we really seeking God or we are seeking
something else behind the name of God?

12:03.740 --> 12:11.230
I tell you, everyone who professes any religion
should just have this test and he’ll be

12:11.230 --> 12:18.670
surprised that either he is seeking money
out of Him or he is seeking power out of Him

12:18.670 --> 12:37.420
or he is seeking some sort of a physical or
maybe a material advantage of Him.

12:37.420 --> 12:43.290
That is how we are disillusioned by these
people who teach us about Truth, because we

12:43.290 --> 12:52.680
find that they are not seekers of Truth, they
are cheating themselves.

12:52.680 --> 13:04.129
A seeker of Truth has his attention all the
time inside, on his seeking.

13:04.129 --> 13:11.410
He is not bothered about other things.

13:11.410 --> 13:21.569
The seeker wants the Absolute, the Perfect.

13:21.569 --> 13:29.379
The seeker doesn’t want something that he’s
not seeking.

13:29.379 --> 13:36.019
That’s why innocence is the best way one
can seek.

13:36.019 --> 13:41.339
Like a small little child once was lost in
a fair.

13:41.339 --> 13:46.199
So, the child started crying for the mother.

13:46.199 --> 13:49.970
And the police people got the child in the
hand.

13:49.970 --> 13:55.569
So, they said, “All right, just now wait,
we’ll get your mother, but first of all

13:55.569 --> 13:56.810
you have something else."

13:56.810 --> 14:00.269
They gave a nice balloon to the child, to
play.

14:00.269 --> 14:03.720
So, the child says, “No, I don’t want
any balloon, I don’t want.

14:03.720 --> 14:04.970
I want my mother."

14:04.970 --> 14:08.500
So, they said, “All right, let’s take
you down, we’ll give you some ice cream

14:08.500 --> 14:09.500
to eat, some chocolates."

14:09.500 --> 14:16.879
The child says, “No, I don’t want any
chocolates, I don’t want anything like that.

14:16.879 --> 14:21.490
I want the presence of my mother.

14:21.490 --> 14:22.800
I want my mother.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.519
I won’t have anything else."

14:25.519 --> 14:33.129
They tried and tried their level best to pacify
the child, but the child would not take anything

14:33.129 --> 14:43.100
else but would just ask for the mother.

14:43.100 --> 14:54.069
Because child had lost the mother and it was
seeking the mother, it was doubting everything

14:54.069 --> 14:58.209
else but that.

14:58.209 --> 15:12.420
But our sense of discrimination, our sense
of understanding, our wisdom is so developed,

15:12.420 --> 15:18.829
is so foolishly developed, I would say, that
we always miss the Truth and grasp the untruth.

15:18.829 --> 15:22.410
I don’t know how human beings can do it?

15:22.410 --> 15:26.120
It’s difficult for animals to do but human
beings just manage.

15:26.120 --> 15:31.600
That’s all we have done so far in the history,
if you see.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.690
Such great incarnations came on this Earth.

15:34.690 --> 15:38.209
What did we do out of their lives?

15:38.209 --> 15:44.959
We crucified them, gave them poisons, we put
them in the jails, we did whatever was possible

15:44.959 --> 15:46.310
out of them.

15:46.310 --> 15:56.029
How many followed them, one or two?

15:56.029 --> 15:58.139
But take Hitler now.

15:58.139 --> 16:10.360
How many followed him?

16:10.360 --> 16:23.029
Because we have a special identification with
falsehood, not with Truth, we have lived with

16:23.029 --> 16:27.730
falsehood all our lives.

16:27.730 --> 16:32.339
Moment to moment you’ll find we are doing
like that.

16:32.339 --> 16:38.570
In the name of money, in the name of power,
in the war, they say, everything is fair,

16:38.570 --> 16:42.649
in the name of so-called love.

16:42.649 --> 16:50.569
With all this, we expect to find the Truth?

16:50.569 --> 16:56.759
Also we expect that Truth should fall at our
feet?

16:56.759 --> 17:08.439
So, to all the seekers of the Truth of this
world, I request to know that if you are seeking

17:08.439 --> 17:14.890
the Truth, this time you don’t miss it.

17:14.890 --> 17:31.370
It is a genuine, absolute, eternal, joy-giving,
being within yourself.

17:31.370 --> 17:42.899
Yourself, within your heart it resides, is
the Atma, is the Spirit within you.

17:42.899 --> 17:44.850
It does not like cheating.

17:44.850 --> 17:50.600
It knows you are cheating, it knows all the
field – kshetrAgnya ( the Knower of the

17:50.600 --> 17:51.600
field).

17:51.600 --> 17:56.450
It knows what you are doing, what you are
playing with, what you are doubting?

17:56.450 --> 18:01.330
It knows everything.

18:01.330 --> 18:12.220
Because this Spirit within you is one with
the Whole, it keeps absolutely in harmony,

18:12.220 --> 18:16.230
unison, concord, with the Whole.

18:16.230 --> 18:28.679
It is we, with our intelligence you may call
it, or ego, or superego, whatever it is, we

18:28.679 --> 18:32.390
try to cheat it.

18:32.390 --> 18:37.929
It doesn’t like it, at all.

18:37.929 --> 18:44.909
If you have to become that, if your attention
has to get dissolved into that Spirit, then

18:44.909 --> 18:48.279
keep your attention pure.

18:48.279 --> 18:59.340
Purity is the way you are going to get into
it.

18:59.340 --> 19:08.200
It is something between you and yourself.

19:08.200 --> 19:23.059
It is something which is your own concern
within yourself, it is for you to decide and

19:23.059 --> 19:30.470
to understand.

19:30.470 --> 19:38.010
If you are getting vibrations in the hand,
if the cool breeze is coming, if your Kundalini

19:38.010 --> 19:49.690
has touched the Sahasrara, maybe, it is the
Grace itself is pouring into you.

19:49.690 --> 19:54.279
But do not take it for granted.

19:54.279 --> 20:01.880
You will not progress fast if you go that
slow way.

20:01.880 --> 20:08.220
You can only progress if you go on drenching
yourself in that Grace.

20:08.220 --> 20:16.190
This is the first problem of Sahaja Yoga,
I find, specially in the West.

20:16.190 --> 20:22.860
And that’s why I have seen, that you are
more enamoured by people who are not genuine

20:22.860 --> 20:32.830
and least bothered about someone who is absolutely
genuine.

20:32.830 --> 20:43.210
The second point that comes to My mind, which
is very important, the other day I hinted

20:43.210 --> 20:51.760
at it, that when you get your Self-realisation,
it’s just the Grace that you get it, at

20:51.760 --> 20:54.620
the first shot, you do get it.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.220
It’s just the Grace that you get it!

20:57.220 --> 21:01.630
To maintain it, is your job.

21:01.630 --> 21:04.409
You lose it very fast, so many of you.

21:04.409 --> 21:11.309
Because as soon as you get it in Sahaja Yoga,
you start doubting it.

21:11.309 --> 21:19.309
Firstly maybe, because you do not think that
you are capable of getting a Self-realisation.

21:19.309 --> 21:24.410
You undervalue yourself, because you don’t
know how much God loves you.

21:24.410 --> 21:29.120
His creation will be destroyed if He does
not give you Self-knowledge.

21:29.120 --> 21:36.870
It is out of this divine Love that you have
got your Self-realisation.

21:36.870 --> 21:41.019
But you lose immediately the vibrations so
many of you, because you start doubting.

21:41.019 --> 21:42.409
What are you doubting there?

21:42.409 --> 21:55.850
Because you are confused!

21:55.850 --> 22:00.440
What are you going to gain out of doubting
or lose out of doubting?

22:00.440 --> 22:02.919
There is no shop here.

22:02.919 --> 22:05.250
There is nothing selling.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.130
You have paid no money for it.

22:07.130 --> 22:11.180
You are not going to lose your powers or anything.

22:11.180 --> 22:16.000
If you are a king, you’ll remain a king,
may become even a greater king.

22:16.000 --> 22:21.600
If you are a student, you might become a better
student.

22:21.600 --> 22:26.350
What is there to lose that you’ve started
doubting and playing with it?

22:26.350 --> 22:31.370
Perhaps, very few realise the value of Self-realisation.

22:31.370 --> 22:37.789
I’ve seen the sick realise it more than
the healthy people, sometimes, because sick

22:37.789 --> 22:39.750
feel comforted in their body.

22:39.750 --> 22:44.390
But how shallow we are!

22:44.390 --> 22:48.110
Just think of it.

22:48.110 --> 22:58.000
Sometimes, this Ambrose, this amrut is given
to someone who doesn’t know the value of

22:58.000 --> 23:02.250
this.

23:02.250 --> 23:11.470
I had some great saints in India who told
Me, who know Me, and who know My work, that,

23:11.470 --> 23:17.110
“Mother, You are wasting Your energy on
these people, they are no good."

23:17.110 --> 23:18.890
They don’t want to come down.

23:18.890 --> 23:21.799
I say, “Why do you say like that?

23:21.799 --> 23:28.179
I know they are seekers of the ancient times,
they’re great people who have been seeking

23:28.179 --> 23:31.370
the Truth and today they are born as normal
householders."

23:31.370 --> 23:39.890
But they said, “They are so identified with
other thing that it is going to be very difficult

23:39.890 --> 23:49.980
for them to accept the Truth."

23:49.980 --> 24:01.610
You have to steady yourself on the platform
of Truth, which itself plays around.

24:01.610 --> 24:02.610
It tests you.

24:02.610 --> 24:05.840
There are ways of testing you.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.110
Every minute it is testing.

24:07.110 --> 24:15.409
You
have to settle down on it.

24:15.409 --> 24:19.580
While, I’ve seen many people saying, ” Then
why should we lose vibrations?”

24:19.580 --> 24:22.080
I mean, see the attitude, I’m saying.

24:22.080 --> 24:24.139
You are a seeker.

24:24.139 --> 24:32.240
Truth is not the seeker, sir.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.429
You have to settle down there, isn’t it?

24:36.429 --> 24:41.669
You have to sit down there, isn’t it?

24:41.669 --> 24:52.620
Because you are going to gain, you are going
to get the joy that is Truth, that is Love,

24:52.620 --> 24:54.580
that is Eternal.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.929
It is you are going to benefit.

24:57.929 --> 25:01.809
So, why be that shallow?

25:01.809 --> 25:04.130
Why be that frivolous?

25:04.130 --> 25:09.820
Because you are people, of ancient ages, have
been seeking the Truth.

25:09.820 --> 25:19.490
There’re people you have seen the other
day, I had met a man who was on the TV or

25:19.490 --> 25:25.700
something and he was talking big thing about
wholesomeness and also of seeking and self-knowledge.

25:25.700 --> 25:34.950
When he confronted Me, I found him absolutely
shallow, good for nothing, absolutely useless

25:34.950 --> 25:35.950
fellow.

25:35.950 --> 25:38.840
He said,”I must have the experience."

25:38.840 --> 25:39.840
I said, “Why must you have, sir?

25:39.840 --> 25:42.360
Why do you entitle?

25:42.360 --> 25:48.159
Because you can give big lecture in BBC, because
you have read this book of this man, that

25:48.159 --> 25:49.279
book of that man?”

25:49.279 --> 25:55.779
It judges you, My children, it judges you
every minute.

25:55.779 --> 26:08.389
You are judging it, but it judges you!

26:08.389 --> 26:31.710
Perhaps, I hope in My lifetime, I may be able
to see that Truth is dawn upon this Earth,

26:31.710 --> 26:44.200
in your heart and that thousands and thousands
of you, who are really the seekers, receive

26:44.200 --> 26:45.200
it.

26:45.200 --> 26:49.669
But it’s a living process.

26:49.669 --> 26:52.410
It is not a artificial process.

26:52.410 --> 26:58.080
It is not just a movement, linear movement
like that.

26:58.080 --> 27:01.240
It is a living process.

27:01.240 --> 27:06.059
There are so many things that have to work
it out.

27:06.059 --> 27:14.649
Like you can have many plastic flowers, but
to get one flower, how much time one has to

27:14.649 --> 27:21.650
spend watching it blossoming?

27:21.650 --> 27:35.090
This growth does not cut anyone, it doesn’t
move in a linear way as other growths do:

27:35.090 --> 27:40.110
like your power, like your political, economic
growths.

27:40.110 --> 27:46.970
They move in lines, they have no relationship
with others, you see.

27:46.970 --> 27:51.750
There is no relationship with the Whole, they
have no sense of proportion.

27:51.750 --> 27:58.539
Like somebody’s nose increasing, somebody’s
ears increasing.

27:58.539 --> 28:01.820
It’s a cancer!

28:01.820 --> 28:06.639
All these movements will lead to cancer, means
they will eat you off.

28:06.639 --> 28:08.810
They have to eat up somebody to make their
way.

28:08.810 --> 28:15.820
They just start blindly moving one side, then
they cannot turn round.

28:15.820 --> 28:27.240
It’s a wholesome, living movement.

28:27.240 --> 28:31.340
And that takes time.

28:31.340 --> 28:36.980
It can work out very fast.

28:36.980 --> 28:40.240
It can go into a chain reaction.

28:40.240 --> 28:53.480
I can assure you: if you all decide to be
genuine about it and humble about it, if you

28:53.480 --> 29:03.390
little bit change your attitude about Sahaja
Yoga: that there is nothing selling here,

29:03.390 --> 29:12.720
that you are the seeker, you have to knock
the door, you have to ask for it and then

29:12.720 --> 29:14.230
you will be blessed.

29:14.230 --> 29:24.710
This is the biggest gap I find, and that’s
why sometimes, I feel extremely helpless.

29:24.710 --> 29:29.060
Please, try to understand.

29:29.060 --> 29:38.860
Please, understand this is the situation:
you are seekers, you are really genuine seekers,

29:38.860 --> 29:41.809
you have been seeking for thousands of years.

29:41.809 --> 29:46.240
It has been said in the scriptures.

29:46.240 --> 29:57.380
And you are born on this Earth to get your
right as the citizen of Kingdom of God.

29:57.380 --> 30:01.130
But seek That!

30:01.130 --> 30:14.250
Do not seek anything else, because nothing
else is important, neither fulfilling, nor

30:14.250 --> 30:19.240
rewarding, neither perfect.

30:19.240 --> 30:25.570
Today, we are going to have the meditation
now after this.

30:25.570 --> 30:34.139
In Sahaja Yoga the meditation has only one
simple meaning is that the Kundalini has to

30:34.139 --> 30:43.320
rise from the triangular bone there, and has
to touch the Sahasrara, here, and open you

30:43.320 --> 30:45.160
to the subtle point.

30:45.160 --> 30:50.590
This is a simple thing, is meditation.

30:50.590 --> 30:56.210
After realisation also, meditation means the
same that you keep your Kundalini high up

30:56.210 --> 30:58.820
hanging there.

30:58.820 --> 31:07.750
You are with the subtle collective consciousness,
with the Universal all-pervading power of

31:07.750 --> 31:08.860
God’s love.

31:08.860 --> 31:16.070
Once you are there, you are just hanged up
into that blissful state.

31:16.070 --> 31:21.429
Then diseases don’t come to you, then mental
tortures don’t come to you.

31:21.429 --> 31:29.059
You become a witness and you become the instrument
of that power, which is all-pervading and

31:29.059 --> 31:33.669
you get the collective consciousness within
you.

31:33.669 --> 31:40.400
It happens to you.

31:40.400 --> 31:46.700
If it does not happen to you, then genuinely,
there are some defects somewhere, which one

31:46.700 --> 31:51.139
has to correct.

31:51.139 --> 31:55.929
For which I am willing to work hard.

31:55.929 --> 32:00.310
And there are so many who have got it also.

32:00.310 --> 32:07.720
So, you are also going to get it and you are
also going to feel it.

32:07.720 --> 32:11.500
There is no problem about it.

32:11.500 --> 32:26.570
It is a gift, it is not an enticement.

32:26.570 --> 32:32.620
Do not mislead yourself any longer- you have
done quite a lot.

32:32.620 --> 32:40.520
Now please, receive the gift and establish
it within yourself.

32:40.520 --> 32:44.770
Do not identify yourself with all false ideas.

32:44.770 --> 32:49.120
Say, if you are a Christian then, ‘I am
a Christian.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.010
Only Christ is the One.’

32:51.010 --> 32:54.120
Yes, He is the One, no doubt, but He means
many thing.

32:54.120 --> 32:59.660
Or if I’m a Muslim, then Mohammed Sahib
is the only One.

32:59.660 --> 33:06.210
Or if I’m a Jew, then I do not believe in
Christ.

33:06.210 --> 33:11.889
There are many like these mad caps all around.

33:11.889 --> 33:19.019
You are not that type!

33:19.019 --> 33:30.450
Get over these boundaries and false identifications
and raise your vision higher, which is called

33:30.450 --> 33:33.480
as adhishthana, you put yourself higher than
what you are.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.299
Which you are!

33:36.299 --> 33:38.960
And just say that, “I’m a seeker of Truth!

33:38.960 --> 33:41.990
Does this behove me, my personality.

33:41.990 --> 33:45.970
How can I think like that about it!”

33:45.970 --> 33:56.370
The Truth has to be universal and has to be
for all of them, whether they are Christians,

33:56.370 --> 34:01.230
Jews, Hindus, Muslims, atheist.

34:01.230 --> 34:05.549
It has to be for every one of you.

34:05.549 --> 34:17.420
So, you do not put it into compartments and
strangle it, because then that is the end

34:17.420 --> 34:19.910
for your seeking.

34:19.910 --> 34:24.460
That is the death of your seeking.

34:24.460 --> 34:40.340
As I told you before, a tree has many flowers
and it has beautiful, one, whole personality.

34:40.340 --> 34:46.670
People take the flowers with them saying,
“This is my flower.

34:46.670 --> 34:49.010
This is my flower."

34:49.010 --> 35:00.210
They remove it from the whole and the flowers
become ugly and die out.

35:00.210 --> 35:08.070
The sap of life moves in the tree all over,
it does not stick on to one flower because

35:08.070 --> 35:14.610
it is one in unison with the power of God.

35:14.610 --> 35:26.220
We, human beings, are separated, specially
for the purpose of our independent development,

35:26.220 --> 35:35.900
but, in our wisdom we should be able to see
all this around us and learn from it.

35:35.900 --> 35:43.850
There are so many thing which teach us that
do not get into compartments.

35:43.850 --> 35:54.390
Does a tree say that ‘I belong to England’
or ‘I belong to India’?

35:54.390 --> 36:05.310
If it cannot prosper in one climate, it does
not, that’s all.

36:05.310 --> 36:15.870
As human beings you are the highest and are
the wisest and the best.

36:15.870 --> 36:24.920
Let God see how this blossoming time flowers
you into beautiful fruits of His work, of

36:24.920 --> 36:29.890
His creation.

36:29.890 --> 36:34.190
May God bless you all!

36:34.190 --> 36:48.810
Will you put your hands like this, towards
Me, just like this and take out your shoes?

36:48.810 --> 36:54.290
Now, you are here for seeking and not for
any mental acrobatics.

36:54.290 --> 36:58.890
So, please, tell your mind to shut up for
a while.

36:58.890 --> 37:03.320
So far you have not been able to find it.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.950
All right, so let us go ahead.

37:05.950 --> 37:11.430
And now do not put your mind to any exercise.

37:11.430 --> 37:17.730
Just put your hands in a very simple manner
like this, in a most comfortable position.

37:17.730 --> 37:21.050
Do not put any strain on your body.

37:21.050 --> 37:24.880
If there is anything tight, please, remove
it.

37:24.880 --> 37:31.570
And let us sit little comfortably.

37:31.570 --> 37:57.540
Just most comfortably, but put both the feet
touching on the ground.

37:57.540 --> 37:58.900
[Pause for 2 minutes]

37:58.900 --> 38:00.270
Please, close your eyes.

38:00.270 --> 38:05.170
Please, close your eyes, because when Kundalini
crosses over the Agnya, there’s a dilatation

38:05.170 --> 38:16.200
of the pupil.

38:16.200 --> 38:22.530
And then eyes little bit, you see a little
bit, blind for a little while, but please,

38:22.530 --> 38:26.160
keep them closed, otherwise the Kundalini
won’t cross, you see, because She doesn’t

38:26.160 --> 38:28.350
want to disturb you, you see.

38:28.350 --> 38:30.880
So, She’ll keep below the Agnya.

38:30.880 --> 38:35.030
Now, if you cannot close your eyes properly,
in the sense that there is a little flickering

38:35.030 --> 38:42.140
in the eyelids, please, open them.

38:42.140 --> 38:49.030
[Pause for 30 seconds]

38:49.030 --> 39:01.090
Don’t be angry with yourself, you see.

39:01.090 --> 39:05.680
It is not true of everyone what I said you.

39:05.680 --> 39:13.310
But it is a little bit in everyone of us,
a little bit of that lacking sometimes, you

39:13.310 --> 39:14.310
see.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.790
So, please, don’t be angry with yourself,
but love yourself.

39:15.790 --> 39:20.290
By loving you will be able to judge it; what
is good and bad for you.

39:20.290 --> 39:21.840
Just don’t think about it.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.790
It will work without thinking.

39:23.790 --> 39:26.270
With thinking it is not going to work out.

39:26.270 --> 39:28.590
So, just leave your thinking one side.

39:28.590 --> 39:29.920
You’ve not to think.

39:29.920 --> 39:38.910
Most of you have become blank.

39:38.910 --> 39:55.000
[Pause for 30 seconds]

39:55.000 --> 39:58.740
You have to get it like a small child wants
to have his mother.

39:58.740 --> 40:02.550
In the same way, you have to get to the Truth.

40:02.550 --> 40:05.750
That’s all, very simple.

40:05.750 --> 40:14.090
But tell your mind to rest a while, not to
take you to too much thinking.

40:14.090 --> 40:22.630
That is very important, because this mind
only cheats you all the time.

40:22.630 --> 40:32.780
Train it up properly.

40:32.780 --> 40:53.590
[ASIDE] You should record it, vibrations.

40:53.590 --> 41:17.950
[Pause for 2 minutes]

41:17.950 --> 41:22.340
If you are getting any cool breeze in your
hand…

41:22.340 --> 41:29.020
All those who have come for the first time
should see if there is any cool breeze coming

41:29.020 --> 41:31.250
in your hand, through your fingers, fingertips.

41:31.250 --> 41:32.780
[Pause for 30 seconds]

41:32.780 --> 41:38.650
You are [UNCLEAR] to the experience.

41:38.650 --> 41:44.590
Very good.

41:44.590 --> 41:54.190
[Pause for one and half minutes]

41:54.190 --> 42:08.010
Now, those who are getting cool breeze, please,
raise your hands, all of you.

42:08.010 --> 42:11.970
Mother addressing somebody in Hindi.

42:11.970 --> 42:15.130
Tumhe nahi aa rahe?

42:15.130 --> 42:18.690
(Means ‘You are not getting?’)

42:18.690 --> 42:21.660
[rest is UNCLEAR]

42:21.660 --> 42:34.120
Those who have come today for the first time,
please, raise your hands who are getting cool

42:34.120 --> 42:35.810
breeze.

42:35.810 --> 42:38.870
For the first time…

42:38.870 --> 42:43.640
Mother asking a Sahaja yogi: “Aa raha hai
unke cool breeze?

42:43.640 --> 42:44.930
Nahi aa raha?

42:44.930 --> 42:47.970
Unko bandhan do tou tumhara aa jayega."

42:47.970 --> 42:50.570
[Meaning: “Is he getting cool breeze?

42:50.570 --> 42:51.570
Not getting?

42:51.570 --> 42:52.570
If you give bandhan to him then you will get
it."

42:52.570 --> 42:53.570
]

42:53.570 --> 42:55.360
Now, those who have come for the first time
and are not getting cool breeze, please, raise

42:55.360 --> 42:56.540
your hands.

42:56.540 --> 43:00.680
First time and are not getting cool breeze,
please, raise your hands.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.650
Have you come for the first time?

43:02.650 --> 43:04.020
Have you?

43:04.020 --> 43:06.770
This lady… ask her.

43:06.770 --> 43:07.850
Have you come…

43:07.850 --> 43:08.850
Yes.

43:08.850 --> 43:10.180
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

43:10.180 --> 43:11.350
Then raise your hands.

43:11.350 --> 43:13.080
Did you follow My point?

43:13.080 --> 43:19.530
Those who have come for the first time and
are not getting cool breeze, please, raise

43:19.530 --> 43:20.950
your hands.

43:20.950 --> 43:23.970
Hanna is he getting cool breeze?

43:23.970 --> 43:24.970
Haan?

43:24.970 --> 43:25.970
[Meaning: ‘Yes?’]

43:25.970 --> 43:27.070
What’s the matter?

43:27.070 --> 43:28.070
Doubting?

43:28.070 --> 43:33.790
You are going to waste all your time, like
this, My child…

43:33.790 --> 43:36.170
[Unclear] How are you going to listen?

43:36.170 --> 43:37.170
Please, raise…

43:37.170 --> 43:38.170
Are you getting cool breeze?

43:38.170 --> 43:39.170
No.

43:39.170 --> 43:40.220
Then again, raise again…

43:40.220 --> 43:48.280
All of you who have come for the first time
and are not getting cool breeze, please, raise

43:48.280 --> 43:50.310
your hands.

43:50.310 --> 43:55.390
Are you getting cool breeze?

43:55.390 --> 43:56.400
Good.

43:56.400 --> 44:00.470
[Unclear] I’m so happy!

44:00.470 --> 44:02.500
Very happy!

44:02.500 --> 44:06.560
You all have got.

44:06.560 --> 44:11.640
Are you feeling better now?

44:11.640 --> 44:16.710
One, two, three, four…and four…

44:16.710 --> 44:19.590
What about that lady there?

44:19.590 --> 44:22.859
Are you getting cool breeze, no?

44:22.859 --> 44:23.859
Getting it?

44:23.859 --> 44:24.859
Very good!

44:24.859 --> 44:27.530
All right, let it work out.

44:27.530 --> 44:32.080
Close your eyes, it will work out, all right?

44:32.080 --> 44:35.620
Only four people are not getting vibrations.

44:35.620 --> 44:40.910
Have you been to any gurus?

44:40.910 --> 44:42.410
Have you been to any gurus?

44:42.410 --> 44:43.620
Guru, guru.

44:43.620 --> 44:52.070
What you call them, masters or gurus or I
don’t know… what all names.

44:52.070 --> 44:54.619
What do you say to gurus?
