00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.700
The other day I told you about the instrument
that we have already within ourselves, for

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.900
us to have our own Self-knowledge, which is
an actualisation, which is an experience,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.140
which is a happening by which we become That.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:34.180
It is the becoming, it is not any brain washing
or sermoning but it’s a becoming I’m talking

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.180
about.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:46.390
When we say, we are the seekers of Truth,
how truthful are we about this seeking?

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.489
This is one point we should try to understand.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.149
Are we really, genuinely seeking?

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:05.140
Are we genuine about it, or we are doing it
because it’s nice to say that we are seeking

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.780
the Truth?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.900
If you have to seek something genuine, you
have to be truthful yourself.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.720
This is one of the greatest hurdles in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:31.900
Sahaja Yoga is a system by which you jump
into the Truth itself.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:41.680
You become the Truth, you don’t see the
Truth, you don’t understand the Truth, but

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.320
you become the Truth.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.950
It is most amazing thing that human beings
don’t understand what to expect out of Truth.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:03.210
They are seeking Truth but they have no conception
about the absolute value of Truth.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.270
Truth, we cannot compromise.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:16.700
It doesn’t have two sides: like you have
day and night, you have right and wrong.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.200
It’s absolute!

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.160
There is no compromise about it.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.030
For example, as the other day I told you that
when you get your realisation, you start feeling

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.520
the cool vibrations flowing from your hand.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.010
And these cool vibrations are the indication
that the Divine power has started flowing

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.760
through you.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:55.739
Now, these vibrations that you have are flowing
through you like a cool breeze, are absolutely

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:05.430
genuine, they are much more genuine than genuineness,
because human beings always have relative

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.780
idea of genuineness.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.569
For example, say, if you take carbon atom-
it can be placed in any way, it has got four

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:24.209
valencies, but it can be placed any way in
a molecule.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.770
You can change the form of it, but still,
if you go to the details of it, the carbon

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.060
will remain carbon.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.739
And a hydrogen will remain hydrogen, in its
basic structure.

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:51.280
So, the Truth that is the basic thing, cannot
change.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.030
You cannot mould it, you cannot befool it,
you cannot act it.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.739
When these vibrations are flowing from you,
if there are no vibrations then you are not

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.360
there.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:14.269
Nobody can say that you are there, that you
are a realised soul because you are carrying

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.850
a big horn on your head.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.630
You may carry any signs and signatures saying
that you are a great person, you have so many

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.169
following and there are so many people running
mad after you.

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.509
But still you are not a realised soul and
you are not.

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:38.279
Even if you are crucified and you are a realised
soul you can feel it that this one, the one

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:47.639
whom we have crucified, is the one who is
emitting vibrations.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:55.909
But if the seeker is not truthful or is conditioned
and he’s trying to cheat himself all the

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.119
time, he is not going to gain anything.

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:04.159
In Sahaja Yoga you have to gain.

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:10.169
Nobody else has to gain, it is you who has
to gain.

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.419
So, you have to be genuine about it.

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.279
You cannot purchase it with money.

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.930
You cannot hide it by any false means.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.789
You cannot kill it.

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:36.119
It is eternal.

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.550
If you lose your vibrations in your hands-
many people have told Me that “Mother, we’ve

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.840
lost the vibrations, now, what to do?”

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.940
As if they have achieved something great by
losing the vibrations, sometimes I feel.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.639
It’s a mistake!

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.699
There’s something wrong with you somewhere
which you must get it corrected.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:03.869
If you think by talking or by befooling, by
hiding things you are going to achieve anything,

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:07.960
you are sadly mistaken.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:16.279
So, we have to be extremely truthful to ourselves,
we have not to cheat ourselves when we are

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:20.699
facing God, when we are facing Truth.

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:27.849
There are some people in this world who destroy
others and there are some who destroy themselves.

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:35.360
In the same way, there are some people in
this world who cheat others and there are

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.960
some who cheat themselves.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:45.029
There are so many things in this world which
helps you to do that – is to cheat yourself.

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.089
So, be on the alert!

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:57.919
Like you read some books- they pamper your
vanity, sometimes, pamper your ego and make

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.969
you feel ‘Oh, I’m all right, I feel all
right!’

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:08.949
And you think that you have really achieved
the goal that you wanted to, because certain

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:12.419
books say ‘so, so, so, so…’

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:20.229
Or maybe, somebody is a man who is not interested
in your well-being and your Truth-seeking,

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:27.039
may give you an idea that ‘All right, this
is the Truth, all right!’

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:38.960
So, you believe that this is the Truth and
you accept it, that this is the Truth.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:47.080
And with that kind of a conditioning, with
that kind of an idea within your head, you

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.990
go ahead and carry on your life.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.580
One life, two lives, three lives…

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.069
You are supposed to be a seeker of Truth!

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:03.659
How many lives are you going to waste seeking?

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:08.800
Are you really genuine about it?

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:21.229
Or is it, because there is a fashion that
one has to talk like that or similar/ly?

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:25.650
Of course, to cheat other is, of course, is
a sin, no doubt.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:38.879
But to cheat yourself, itself, is also a big
obstacle in the seeking of Truth.

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:51.070
So, we have to realise that we are here to
face the Truth.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:58.680
And God has created us in such a way that
He has placed everything so beautifully within

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:08.629
us for this thing to happen, for us to get
our Self-knowledge.

00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:15.990
You are not to go in wilderness to find it
out!

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.150
You are not to read anything about it!

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:26.240
Which university did Christ go to, or Krishna
go to?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:37.480
What education did Rama have as far as university
education is concerned?

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:47.829
You have to read within yourself, your own
book is within yourself, and to see for yourself,

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:54.680
in a very humble manner to understand, ‘Where
am I?’

00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:01.110
Sahaja Yoga is a system which says, ‘saha-ja’-
‘saha’ means ‘with’ and ‘ja’ is

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.110
‘born’.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.420
It is born with you.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:10.199
Everything born with you is genuine.

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:11.770
Do you know that?

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.570
We do not know.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.689
Our hands are genuine- they never cheat us.

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:20.779
Our feet are genuine- they never cheat, do
they?

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:26.710
Our eyes are genuine: you see something white,
it looks white, it is white.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.340
Our eyes never tell us that it is black.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:45.170
Only when we are sick, then the whole composition
changes and you get all kinds of wrong information

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.870
from this body of yours.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:11:03.839
Your heart is genuine, but we teach our heart
to cheat, we teach our eyes to cheat.

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:15.020
We have pretensions and the Truth knows you.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:20.399
When I say this we should not have self-pity
about ourselves.

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:25.620
It is never the way to go from one extreme
to another.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.379
This is a very common condition of human being.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:34.399
If you tell them one thing, they go from one
end to another end.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:48.699
No, you just stand in the centre and see for
yourself: How much genuine are we to receive

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:52.120
the blessings of God?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:12:03.740
Are we really seeking God or we are seeking
something else behind the name of God?

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:11.230
I tell you, everyone who professes any religion
should just have this test and he’ll be

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:18.670
surprised that either he is seeking money
out of Him or he is seeking power out of Him

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:37.420
or he is seeking some sort of a physical or
maybe a material advantage of Him.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:43.290
That is how we are disillusioned by these
people who teach us about Truth, because we

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:52.680
find that they are not seekers of Truth, they
are cheating themselves.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:13:04.129
A seeker of Truth has his attention all the
time inside, on his seeking.

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:11.410
He is not bothered about other things.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:21.569
The seeker wants the Absolute, the Perfect.

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:29.379
The seeker doesn’t want something that he’s
not seeking.

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:36.019
That’s why innocence is the best way one
can seek.

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:41.339
Like a small little child once was lost in
a fair.

00:13:41.339 --> 00:13:46.199
So, the child started crying for the mother.

00:13:46.199 --> 00:13:49.970
And the police people got the child in the
hand.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:55.569
So, they said, “All right, just now wait,
we’ll get your mother, but first of all

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:56.810
you have something else."

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.269
They gave a nice balloon to the child, to
play.

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:03.720
So, the child says, “No, I don’t want
any balloon, I don’t want.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.970
I want my mother."

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.500
So, they said, “All right, let’s take
you down, we’ll give you some ice cream

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500
to eat, some chocolates."

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:16.879
The child says, “No, I don’t want any
chocolates, I don’t want anything like that.

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:21.490
I want the presence of my mother.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.800
I want my mother.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.519
I won’t have anything else."

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:33.129
They tried and tried their level best to pacify
the child, but the child would not take anything

00:14:33.129 --> 00:14:43.100
else but would just ask for the mother.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:54.069
Because child had lost the mother and it was
seeking the mother, it was doubting everything

00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:58.209
else but that.

00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:12.420
But our sense of discrimination, our sense
of understanding, our wisdom is so developed,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:18.829
is so foolishly developed, I would say, that
we always miss the Truth and grasp the untruth.

00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:22.410
I don’t know how human beings can do it?

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.120
It’s difficult for animals to do but human
beings just manage.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:31.600
That’s all we have done so far in the history,
if you see.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.690
Such great incarnations came on this Earth.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.209
What did we do out of their lives?

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:44.959
We crucified them, gave them poisons, we put
them in the jails, we did whatever was possible

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:46.310
out of them.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:56.029
How many followed them, one or two?

00:15:56.029 --> 00:15:58.139
But take Hitler now.

00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:10.360
How many followed him?

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:23.029
Because we have a special identification with
falsehood, not with Truth, we have lived with

00:16:23.029 --> 00:16:27.730
falsehood all our lives.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:32.339
Moment to moment you’ll find we are doing
like that.

00:16:32.339 --> 00:16:38.570
In the name of money, in the name of power,
in the war, they say, everything is fair,

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.649
in the name of so-called love.

00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:50.569
With all this, we expect to find the Truth?

00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:56.759
Also we expect that Truth should fall at our
feet?

00:16:56.759 --> 00:17:08.439
So, to all the seekers of the Truth of this
world, I request to know that if you are seeking

00:17:08.439 --> 00:17:14.890
the Truth, this time you don’t miss it.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:31.370
It is a genuine, absolute, eternal, joy-giving,
being within yourself.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:42.899
Yourself, within your heart it resides, is
the Atma, is the Spirit within you.

00:17:42.899 --> 00:17:44.850
It does not like cheating.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:50.600
It knows you are cheating, it knows all the
field – kshetrAgnya ( the Knower of the

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.600
field).

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.450
It knows what you are doing, what you are
playing with, what you are doubting?

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.330
It knows everything.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:12.220
Because this Spirit within you is one with
the Whole, it keeps absolutely in harmony,

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.230
unison, concord, with the Whole.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:28.679
It is we, with our intelligence you may call
it, or ego, or superego, whatever it is, we

00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:32.390
try to cheat it.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:37.929
It doesn’t like it, at all.

00:18:37.929 --> 00:18:44.909
If you have to become that, if your attention
has to get dissolved into that Spirit, then

00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:48.279
keep your attention pure.

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:59.340
Purity is the way you are going to get into
it.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:08.200
It is something between you and yourself.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:23.059
It is something which is your own concern
within yourself, it is for you to decide and

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:30.470
to understand.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:38.010
If you are getting vibrations in the hand,
if the cool breeze is coming, if your Kundalini

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:49.690
has touched the Sahasrara, maybe, it is the
Grace itself is pouring into you.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:54.279
But do not take it for granted.

00:19:54.279 --> 00:20:01.880
You will not progress fast if you go that
slow way.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:08.220
You can only progress if you go on drenching
yourself in that Grace.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:16.190
This is the first problem of Sahaja Yoga,
I find, specially in the West.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:22.860
And that’s why I have seen, that you are
more enamoured by people who are not genuine

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:32.830
and least bothered about someone who is absolutely
genuine.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:43.210
The second point that comes to My mind, which
is very important, the other day I hinted

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:51.760
at it, that when you get your Self-realisation,
it’s just the Grace that you get it, at

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.620
the first shot, you do get it.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.220
It’s just the Grace that you get it!

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.630
To maintain it, is your job.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.409
You lose it very fast, so many of you.

00:21:04.409 --> 00:21:11.309
Because as soon as you get it in Sahaja Yoga,
you start doubting it.

00:21:11.309 --> 00:21:19.309
Firstly maybe, because you do not think that
you are capable of getting a Self-realisation.

00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:24.410
You undervalue yourself, because you don’t
know how much God loves you.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:29.120
His creation will be destroyed if He does
not give you Self-knowledge.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:36.870
It is out of this divine Love that you have
got your Self-realisation.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.019
But you lose immediately the vibrations so
many of you, because you start doubting.

00:21:41.019 --> 00:21:42.409
What are you doubting there?

00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:55.850
Because you are confused!

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.440
What are you going to gain out of doubting
or lose out of doubting?

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.919
There is no shop here.

00:22:02.919 --> 00:22:05.250
There is nothing selling.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.130
You have paid no money for it.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.180
You are not going to lose your powers or anything.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:16.000
If you are a king, you’ll remain a king,
may become even a greater king.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.600
If you are a student, you might become a better
student.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.350
What is there to lose that you’ve started
doubting and playing with it?

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.370
Perhaps, very few realise the value of Self-realisation.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:37.789
I’ve seen the sick realise it more than
the healthy people, sometimes, because sick

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:39.750
feel comforted in their body.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:44.390
But how shallow we are!

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.110
Just think of it.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:58.000
Sometimes, this Ambrose, this amrut is given
to someone who doesn’t know the value of

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.250
this.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:11.470
I had some great saints in India who told
Me, who know Me, and who know My work, that,

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:17.110
“Mother, You are wasting Your energy on
these people, they are no good."

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.890
They don’t want to come down.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.799
I say, “Why do you say like that?

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:28.179
I know they are seekers of the ancient times,
they’re great people who have been seeking

00:23:28.179 --> 00:23:31.370
the Truth and today they are born as normal
householders."

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:39.890
But they said, “They are so identified with
other thing that it is going to be very difficult

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:49.980
for them to accept the Truth."

00:23:49.980 --> 00:24:01.610
You have to steady yourself on the platform
of Truth, which itself plays around.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.610
It tests you.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.840
There are ways of testing you.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.110
Every minute it is testing.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:15.409
You
have to settle down on it.

00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:19.580
While, I’ve seen many people saying, ” Then
why should we lose vibrations?”

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.080
I mean, see the attitude, I’m saying.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.139
You are a seeker.

00:24:24.139 --> 00:24:32.240
Truth is not the seeker, sir.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.429
You have to settle down there, isn’t it?

00:24:36.429 --> 00:24:41.669
You have to sit down there, isn’t it?

00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:52.620
Because you are going to gain, you are going
to get the joy that is Truth, that is Love,

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.580
that is Eternal.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.929
It is you are going to benefit.

00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:01.809
So, why be that shallow?

00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:04.130
Why be that frivolous?

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:09.820
Because you are people, of ancient ages, have
been seeking the Truth.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:19.490
There’re people you have seen the other
day, I had met a man who was on the TV or

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:25.700
something and he was talking big thing about
wholesomeness and also of seeking and self-knowledge.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:34.950
When he confronted Me, I found him absolutely
shallow, good for nothing, absolutely useless

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:35.950
fellow.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.840
He said,”I must have the experience."

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.840
I said, “Why must you have, sir?

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.360
Why do you entitle?

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:48.159
Because you can give big lecture in BBC, because
you have read this book of this man, that

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:49.279
book of that man?”

00:25:49.279 --> 00:25:55.779
It judges you, My children, it judges you
every minute.

00:25:55.779 --> 00:26:08.389
You are judging it, but it judges you!

00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:31.710
Perhaps, I hope in My lifetime, I may be able
to see that Truth is dawn upon this Earth,

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:44.200
in your heart and that thousands and thousands
of you, who are really the seekers, receive

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.200
it.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:49.669
But it’s a living process.

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:52.410
It is not a artificial process.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:58.080
It is not just a movement, linear movement
like that.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.240
It is a living process.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.059
There are so many things that have to work
it out.

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:14.649
Like you can have many plastic flowers, but
to get one flower, how much time one has to

00:27:14.649 --> 00:27:21.650
spend watching it blossoming?

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:35.090
This growth does not cut anyone, it doesn’t
move in a linear way as other growths do:

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:40.110
like your power, like your political, economic
growths.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:46.970
They move in lines, they have no relationship
with others, you see.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.750
There is no relationship with the Whole, they
have no sense of proportion.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:58.539
Like somebody’s nose increasing, somebody’s
ears increasing.

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:01.820
It’s a cancer!

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:06.639
All these movements will lead to cancer, means
they will eat you off.

00:28:06.639 --> 00:28:08.810
They have to eat up somebody to make their
way.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:15.820
They just start blindly moving one side, then
they cannot turn round.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:27.240
It’s a wholesome, living movement.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.340
And that takes time.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:36.980
It can work out very fast.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.240
It can go into a chain reaction.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:53.480
I can assure you: if you all decide to be
genuine about it and humble about it, if you

00:28:53.480 --> 00:29:03.390
little bit change your attitude about Sahaja
Yoga: that there is nothing selling here,

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:12.720
that you are the seeker, you have to knock
the door, you have to ask for it and then

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.230
you will be blessed.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:24.710
This is the biggest gap I find, and that’s
why sometimes, I feel extremely helpless.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:29.060
Please, try to understand.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:38.860
Please, understand this is the situation:
you are seekers, you are really genuine seekers,

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.809
you have been seeking for thousands of years.

00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:46.240
It has been said in the scriptures.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:57.380
And you are born on this Earth to get your
right as the citizen of Kingdom of God.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.130
But seek That!

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:14.250
Do not seek anything else, because nothing
else is important, neither fulfilling, nor

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:19.240
rewarding, neither perfect.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:25.570
Today, we are going to have the meditation
now after this.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:34.139
In Sahaja Yoga the meditation has only one
simple meaning is that the Kundalini has to

00:30:34.139 --> 00:30:43.320
rise from the triangular bone there, and has
to touch the Sahasrara, here, and open you

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.160
to the subtle point.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.590
This is a simple thing, is meditation.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:56.210
After realisation also, meditation means the
same that you keep your Kundalini high up

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.820
hanging there.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:07.750
You are with the subtle collective consciousness,
with the Universal all-pervading power of

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:08.860
God’s love.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:16.070
Once you are there, you are just hanged up
into that blissful state.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:21.429
Then diseases don’t come to you, then mental
tortures don’t come to you.

00:31:21.429 --> 00:31:29.059
You become a witness and you become the instrument
of that power, which is all-pervading and

00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:33.669
you get the collective consciousness within
you.

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:40.400
It happens to you.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:46.700
If it does not happen to you, then genuinely,
there are some defects somewhere, which one

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.139
has to correct.

00:31:51.139 --> 00:31:55.929
For which I am willing to work hard.

00:31:55.929 --> 00:32:00.310
And there are so many who have got it also.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:07.720
So, you are also going to get it and you are
also going to feel it.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.500
There is no problem about it.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:26.570
It is a gift, it is not an enticement.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:32.620
Do not mislead yourself any longer- you have
done quite a lot.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:40.520
Now please, receive the gift and establish
it within yourself.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.770
Do not identify yourself with all false ideas.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:49.120
Say, if you are a Christian then, ‘I am
a Christian.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.010
Only Christ is the One.’

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.120
Yes, He is the One, no doubt, but He means
many thing.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:59.660
Or if I’m a Muslim, then Mohammed Sahib
is the only One.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:06.210
Or if I’m a Jew, then I do not believe in
Christ.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:11.889
There are many like these mad caps all around.

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:19.019
You are not that type!

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:30.450
Get over these boundaries and false identifications
and raise your vision higher, which is called

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.480
as adhishthana, you put yourself higher than
what you are.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.299
Which you are!

00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:38.960
And just say that, “I’m a seeker of Truth!

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.990
Does this behove me, my personality.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.970
How can I think like that about it!”

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:56.370
The Truth has to be universal and has to be
for all of them, whether they are Christians,

00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:01.230
Jews, Hindus, Muslims, atheist.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:05.549
It has to be for every one of you.

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:17.420
So, you do not put it into compartments and
strangle it, because then that is the end

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.910
for your seeking.

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:24.460
That is the death of your seeking.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:40.340
As I told you before, a tree has many flowers
and it has beautiful, one, whole personality.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:46.670
People take the flowers with them saying,
“This is my flower.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.010
This is my flower."

00:34:49.010 --> 00:35:00.210
They remove it from the whole and the flowers
become ugly and die out.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:08.070
The sap of life moves in the tree all over,
it does not stick on to one flower because

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:14.610
it is one in unison with the power of God.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:26.220
We, human beings, are separated, specially
for the purpose of our independent development,

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:35.900
but, in our wisdom we should be able to see
all this around us and learn from it.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:43.850
There are so many thing which teach us that
do not get into compartments.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:54.390
Does a tree say that ‘I belong to England’
or ‘I belong to India’?

00:35:54.390 --> 00:36:05.310
If it cannot prosper in one climate, it does
not, that’s all.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:15.870
As human beings you are the highest and are
the wisest and the best.

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:24.920
Let God see how this blossoming time flowers
you into beautiful fruits of His work, of

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:29.890
His creation.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:34.190
May God bless you all!

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:48.810
Will you put your hands like this, towards
Me, just like this and take out your shoes?

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:54.290
Now, you are here for seeking and not for
any mental acrobatics.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:58.890
So, please, tell your mind to shut up for
a while.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:03.320
So far you have not been able to find it.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.950
All right, so let us go ahead.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:11.430
And now do not put your mind to any exercise.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:17.730
Just put your hands in a very simple manner
like this, in a most comfortable position.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.050
Do not put any strain on your body.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.880
If there is anything tight, please, remove
it.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:31.570
And let us sit little comfortably.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:57.540
Just most comfortably, but put both the feet
touching on the ground.

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.900
[Pause for 2 minutes]

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.270
Please, close your eyes.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:05.170
Please, close your eyes, because when Kundalini
crosses over the Agnya, there’s a dilatation

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:16.200
of the pupil.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:22.530
And then eyes little bit, you see a little
bit, blind for a little while, but please,

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.160
keep them closed, otherwise the Kundalini
won’t cross, you see, because She doesn’t

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.350
want to disturb you, you see.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.880
So, She’ll keep below the Agnya.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.030
Now, if you cannot close your eyes properly,
in the sense that there is a little flickering

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:42.140
in the eyelids, please, open them.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:49.030
[Pause for 30 seconds]

00:38:49.030 --> 00:39:01.090
Don’t be angry with yourself, you see.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:05.680
It is not true of everyone what I said you.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:13.310
But it is a little bit in everyone of us,
a little bit of that lacking sometimes, you

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:14.310
see.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:15.790
So, please, don’t be angry with yourself,
but love yourself.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:20.290
By loving you will be able to judge it; what
is good and bad for you.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:21.840
Just don’t think about it.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.790
It will work without thinking.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:26.270
With thinking it is not going to work out.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.590
So, just leave your thinking one side.

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.920
You’ve not to think.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:38.910
Most of you have become blank.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:55.000
[Pause for 30 seconds]

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.740
You have to get it like a small child wants
to have his mother.

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:02.550
In the same way, you have to get to the Truth.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.750
That’s all, very simple.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:14.090
But tell your mind to rest a while, not to
take you to too much thinking.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:22.630
That is very important, because this mind
only cheats you all the time.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:32.780
Train it up properly.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:53.590
[ASIDE] You should record it, vibrations.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:41:17.950
[Pause for 2 minutes]

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:22.340
If you are getting any cool breeze in your
hand…

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:29.020
All those who have come for the first time
should see if there is any cool breeze coming

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.250
in your hand, through your fingers, fingertips.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.780
[Pause for 30 seconds]

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:38.650
You are [UNCLEAR] to the experience.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:44.590
Very good.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:54.190
[Pause for one and half minutes]

00:41:54.190 --> 00:42:08.010
Now, those who are getting cool breeze, please,
raise your hands, all of you.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.970
Mother addressing somebody in Hindi.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.130
Tumhe nahi aa rahe?

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.690
(Means ‘You are not getting?’)

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.660
[rest is UNCLEAR]

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:34.120
Those who have come today for the first time,
please, raise your hands who are getting cool

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.810
breeze.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.870
For the first time…

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:43.640
Mother asking a Sahaja yogi: “Aa raha hai
unke cool breeze?

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.930
Nahi aa raha?

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.970
Unko bandhan do tou tumhara aa jayega."

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.570
[Meaning: “Is he getting cool breeze?

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:51.570
Not getting?

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.570
If you give bandhan to him then you will get
it."

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:53.570
]

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.360
Now, those who have come for the first time
and are not getting cool breeze, please, raise

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.540
your hands.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.680
First time and are not getting cool breeze,
please, raise your hands.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.650
Have you come for the first time?

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:04.020
Have you?

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.770
This lady… ask her.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:07.850
Have you come…

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:08.850
Yes.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.180
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.350
Then raise your hands.

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.080
Did you follow My point?

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:19.530
Those who have come for the first time and
are not getting cool breeze, please, raise

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.950
your hands.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.970
Hanna is he getting cool breeze?

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:24.970
Haan?

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:25.970
[Meaning: ‘Yes?’]

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.070
What’s the matter?

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.070
Doubting?

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:33.790
You are going to waste all your time, like
this, My child…

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.170
[Unclear] How are you going to listen?

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.170
Please, raise…

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:38.170
Are you getting cool breeze?

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:39.170
No.

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.220
Then again, raise again…

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:48.280
All of you who have come for the first time
and are not getting cool breeze, please, raise

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.310
your hands.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:55.390
Are you getting cool breeze?

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:56.400
Good.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.470
[Unclear] I’m so happy!

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.500
Very happy!

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.560
You all have got.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.640
Are you feeling better now?

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:16.710
One, two, three, four…and four…

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:19.590
What about that lady there?

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.859
Are you getting cool breeze, no?

00:44:22.859 --> 00:44:23.859
Getting it?

00:44:23.859 --> 00:44:24.859
Very good!

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:27.530
All right, let it work out.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:32.080
Close your eyes, it will work out, all right?

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:35.620
Only four people are not getting vibrations.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:40.910
Have you been to any gurus?

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:42.410
Have you been to any gurus?

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:43.620
Guru, guru.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:52.070
What you call them, masters or gurus or I
don’t know… what all names.

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.619
What do you say to gurus?
