EASTER EGG AND REBIRTH - Excerpts

00:00:13.114 --> 00:00:20.293
On the Easter day we give people eggs

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:26.305
to remind them that, "You are egg now
and you have to become the bird.”

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:35.227
But I don’t think people know that,

00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:41.557
because resurrection is the message
of Christ.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:49.592
Crucifixion is the accomplishment, but
resurrection is His message.

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:58.881
An egg is a very significant thing and

00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:08.162
it is written in one of the ancient
scriptures in India

00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:17.609
why Easter should be celebrated
with an egg. Is most surprising.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:26.618
It's very clear there if one can see
how Christ is symbolized as an egg.

00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:31.610
Now what is an egg?

00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:38.230
In Sanskrit language, a Brahmin is called
as dwijaha.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:43.967
Dwihi jayeti means the one who is born
twice.

00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:51.141
And a bird is also called, any bird,
is called as a dwija,

00:01:51.342 --> 00:01:57.878
means twice born. Because first the bird
is born as an egg

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.615
and then reborn as a bird.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.972
In the same way a human being is born
as an egg

00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:14.365
and then is born as a realized soul.

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:21.370
Now see how significant it is that both
are called by the same name.

00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:27.231
No other animal is called as dwija unless
and until it has an egg-form first

00:02:27.432 --> 00:02:33.490
and then it comes out as a... another
thing.

00:02:35.178 --> 00:02:38.695
For example no mammals,

00:02:40.692 --> 00:02:45.891
none of the mammals, are called as dwija
except for human beings.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.846
It is remarkable in the zoology if you read
that mammals do not lay their eggs,

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:57.726
they give birth directly to their children.
And we are also mammals.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:06.035
But despite that, human beings are called
as dwijaha just like birds.

00:03:08.047 --> 00:03:14.019
So that means human beings, when they are
born are eggs,

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:17.147
or they become eggs.

00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:21.911
How do they become eggs?

00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:28.641
Is the way our ego and superego develop
within us.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:33.147
Now you all being only Sahaj Yogis I think
you understand what I'm saying.

00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:38.458
When the ego and superego...
[Aside: "What's this supposed to be?"]

00:03:39.505 --> 00:03:44.631
When the ego and superego...
[Aside: "There's no chart, is it?"]

00:03:44.832 --> 00:03:52.453
develop in a human being, to the full
extent

00:03:52.654 --> 00:03:59.809
and the fontanel bone area is completely
calcified, then you become an egg.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.280
You get completely separated from your
Mother,

00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:10.318
from all the Pervading power of God

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.380
and you are left to yourself as an egg

00:04:15.612 --> 00:04:22.371
till you mature within yourself inside
the shell of the egg, in your freedom,

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:28.487
to a point where you are ready for
hatching.

00:04:28.898 --> 00:04:34.133
The Mother bird has to pierce on the head
of the egg

00:04:34.334 --> 00:04:39.084
and you come out as birds. You're already
there inside developed

00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:48.978
and then you fly out into the space
of All Pervading power of Divine Love.

00:04:50.822 --> 00:04:56.733
So how significant is Easter, and why
Christ?

00:04:58.832 --> 00:05:06.163
He came on this earth because He had
learnt the idea,

00:05:07.195 --> 00:05:15.951
He had practiced the idea, or we can say
that He was an expert on this.

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:21.256
That He could

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:28.311
Himself surpass that hurdle

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:36.882
by which He becomes the dwija, but He was
that already.

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:43.615
But how are you to believe that you can be
dwijahas, you can be reborn?

00:05:43.816 --> 00:05:49.534
It was said by every religion, by every
prophet,

00:05:49.735 --> 00:05:56.476
that you are to be born again. Unless
and until you are reborn -

00:05:56.677 --> 00:06:01.516
that means baptism, not this kind
of baptism but the real one -

00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:07.239
unless and until this shell is broken
on your fontanel area,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.922
you cannot become the dwijaha.

00:06:11.123 --> 00:06:18.082
Is written in all the scriptures, said by
all the prophets;

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:23.029
somebody had to show you that this can
be done.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:31.460
He being the Divine power itself,
the Pranava, He being the Brahma itself.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.193
His rebirth was resurrection, bodily
resurrection,

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:45.818
while yours is a resurrection which is
in your consciousness.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.672
And you see it clearly. This is what is
Easter is.

00:06:57.356 --> 00:07:03.365
I wonder how many Christians know
the significance of an egg.

00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:11.574
Now egg signifies a stage where you are
before realization,

00:07:12.063 --> 00:07:19.373
when you are in your eggshell; that you
are Mr. X, you are Mrs. Y, all that.

00:07:19.574 --> 00:07:23.785
But when you mature fully inside,

00:07:23.986 --> 00:07:28.937
the bird is ready and that is the time
you are hatched.

00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:32.931
This is the time you get twice born.

00:07:33.132 --> 00:07:37.832
So, actually the resurrection of Christ
signifies that,

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.337
and that’s why we give that egg

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.978
to people saying, “You are an egg”,
a reminder of that,

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:50.579
and this egg can become the Spirit.

00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:55.097
And also it is written that it was an egg
when He came.

00:07:55.298 --> 00:08:00.210
First He was created as an egg. Half of it
remained

00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:06.758
as Shri Ganesha and half of it became
Mahavishnu.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:12.854
Then He came on this earth and He departed
with all His elements

00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:17.686
and the pure vibrations formed His body,

00:08:17.887 --> 00:08:25.939
and He remained there within all of you,
to be awakened.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:32.469
And when the Kundalini takes your attention

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:38.214
through that point, there you also become
the Spirit.

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:43.809
That’s why He said, that “I’m the gate,
I’m the door”.

00:08:43.986 --> 00:08:48.119
He didn’t say, “I’m the destination.”
He said, “I’m the door,”

00:08:48.887 --> 00:08:52.316
because you cannot become Christ.

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:56.272
That’s why he didn’t say, “I’m the
destination,” that you have to achieve Him,

00:08:56.473 --> 00:09:01.889
but He has created this space for you.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:10.220
You can become spiritually awakened;
you can become your Spirit.

00:09:10.421 --> 00:09:16.026
But Christ is an incarnation, He was
the Son of God.

00:09:16.227 --> 00:09:21.810
And so He is an incarnation, and that
incarnation came on this earth

00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:28.914
just to pull you out of your elements,
to make you become the Spirit.
