1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Shri Mataji has asked me to share with you what

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,160
was the last experience of Her Divine visit in Russia.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,560
And I must say it was really a dramatic breakthrough,

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:22,120
because in the scientific conference She had in Moscow,

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,120
there was the participation of a very well known scientist,

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,840
a physicist.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,400
His name is Anatoli Akimov, he is very well known

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,760
all over Russia and all over the world also.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,360
And he came with a theory and he has been studying

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,320
this theory for a few years,

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,720
which is based on the vacuum body and he studied

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,960
something like the torsion fields and he could explain

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,040
in a very clear way, in a very scientific way,

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,880
the vibrations that Shri Mataji is emitting.

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,320
So, at the beginning he was studying some Yogis

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,520
which were meditating and he could notice that

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,720
they were emitting vibrations,

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,960
there was an aura around them.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,920
But then, when he came to Shri Mataji,

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,680
when he saw Her pictures, the miraculous pictures,

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,440
then he could really find out what it was and he said

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,360
that in Her case, it was something which is infinite,

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,360
which is unlimited.

24
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,160
And also it was very nice, because at one point he said:

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,120
"As a man of science, I have to admit that

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,720
all the scientists that so far made some exceptional,

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,200
unique discovery...,

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,680
I have to admit that all this did not come

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,640
through some scientific process, through the brain,

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,920
we can say.

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,120
But it come only through some divine inspiration.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,680
We can mention Newton, we can mention Einstein and so on."

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,960
And he said: "Also in my case, when I was studying

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,000
and working on this theory, at some point

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,600
when I saw the picture of Shri Mataji

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,480
then I got the inspiration."

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,280
And then now Shri Mataji has invited him

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,960
in September to come.

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,680
And he has already written a book in Russia

40
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,120
which will be translated in English and he is preparing

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,920
a new book on which of course the major topic will be

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
this unique discovery.

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,520
So now we have somebody

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,760
who has scientifically proved what Shri Mataji is.

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:30,160
In Russia the people somehow are very open-minded.

46
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,160
Not only that,

47
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,520
the scientists specially are very open-minded

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,280
and were suppressed very much,

49
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,680
so they tried to find out

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,920
the subtler things;

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,440
not only finding out about chemicals

52
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,720
or about some physical properties of the light,

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,200
but they wanted to go into the subtler side.

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,920
And they had find, found out

55
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,000
already a great deal of knowledge

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,120
about the auras -- auras around the hand,

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,920
auras around the body --

58
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,080
they had done so much of research

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,680
and it was accepted all over the world, their findings.

60
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Now this gentleman was a specialist, I think,

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,800
because he's a very well-known, very, very well-known person

62
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,520
and he's holding a very big position.

63
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,440
He was saying that he was, he has to run 150 organizations --

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,680
very humble and very nice person.

65
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,120
And when he came out with this discovery

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,600
I was happy in a way, because scientifically if it is proved,

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,920
then nobody can challenge it.

68
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,760
He has already written a book with all the algebraical

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,360
complications of what he wanted to prove.

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,160
And he said there is a vacuum,

71
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,760
beyond the consciousness there's vacuum,

72
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,680
and in that vacuum only you can know the reality.

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,560
And once all this becomes the reality it is a science,

74
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,600
and that's how it is made into science.

75
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,720
He showed so many of My photographs,

76
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,400
specially the one where lot of energy is coming out

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,560
of My Sahasrara when we are on a boat.

78
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,120
So he said, "She is the Source of all the cosmic energy."

79
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,920
And that's what is Adi Shakti is:

80
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,240
She's the one who creates everything.

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,640
The whole atmosphere that we know of is very artificial,

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,560
but when you understand what She has done ...

83
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,240
The first thing She does is to --

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,560
in My book also I have written down about it,

85
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,640
but I would like to tell you -- that Her first,

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,640
should say, manifestation is on the left-hand side.

87
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,680
That's the Mahakali's manifestation.

88
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,160
So She comes on the Mahakali system, the left-hand side,

89
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,960
and that is where She created Ganesha.

90
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,040
Shri Ganesha is created because His purity,

91
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,480
His innocence and auspiciousness,

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,600
this had to be created before She created the universe.

93
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,440
So first thing She does is to create Shri Ganesha,

94
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,760
and He's settled down.

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,520
Then She goes up, of course in the body of the Virata,

96
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,680
and then She goes round and goes up

97
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,000
on the right-hand side in the other way;

98
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,280
and there She creates all the universes --

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,920
as you call them, bhuvanas.

100
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,200
One universe -- there are fourteen bhuvanas -- means

101
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,480
these many, many universes make one bhuvana.

102
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,320
And She creates all these things

103
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,560
on the right-hand side.

104
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Then She goes up and then She descends down,

105
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,440
creating all the chakras,

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,240
the Adi Chakras or the peethas.

107
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
She comes down, makes all these peethas

108
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,800
and then She's settled as the Kundalini.

109
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,640
But Adi Shakti is not fully the Kundalini, we can say,

110
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,200
Kundalini is, is a part of it.

111
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,160
The rest of the work is much more than this.

112
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,680
So the, all the, we call it the residual energy --

113
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,680
means after going through all this journey,

114
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,400
then She comes round and She goes as Kundalini.

115
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,640
Because of this Kundalini and the chakras,

116
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,320
She creates a area which we call

117
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,720
as the chakras in the body.

118
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,400
Now first She creates these chakras in the head:

119
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,240
we call them the peethas of the chakras.

120
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,880
And then She comes down and creates these chakras,

121
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,680
which are in the body of the Virata.

122
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,920
Now once this has happened,

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,800
then She creates human beings, but not directly:

124
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,480
through the evolutionary process She goes through,

125
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,160
and that's how the evolution starts.

126
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,080
And then it starts developing from the minute,

127
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,280
small little microscopic organisms in the water,

128
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,360
and then it starts evolving.

129
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,560
So when She creates water and

130
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,600
She creates all the universes,

131
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,080
She chooses this Mother Earth as the best place

132
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,840
to play Her evolutionary process,

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,400
and there She makes this little microscopic thing.

134
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
Of course I have written all about it,

135
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,160
and when My book will be released

136
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,480
you can see that how first hydrogen,

137
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,960
carbon and oxygen and all of these things

138
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,240
were mixed up and how nitrogen comes into play,

139
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,400
and how a living process starts.

140
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,200
All this I have done it in My another book

141
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,920
that I am going to write now.

142
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,480
I mean, I have mostly finished,

143
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,240
but there's some more chakras are to be dealt with.

144
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,520
Now with this happening, you see,

145
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,240
one thing is there that whatever I write,

146
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,240
now people won't doubt.

147
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,480
They will know it's a scientific fact,

148
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,040
and that's what whatever I say is a fact.

149
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,560
Now to believe in the car...

150
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,800
in the, even, a Mother, Adi Shakti, was impossible.

151
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,320
Specially you'll be amazed that Christian religion

152
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,760
somehow or other avoided the mentioning of the Mother.

153
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,880
Then the Islam, that also avoided

154
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
the mentioning of the Mother.

155
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,920
There's completely negation towards the Mother.

156
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,840
But only Indian philosophy had the Mother,

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,400
and the Indians are actually Shakti-worshippers.

158
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,080
So this is how it was kept up

159
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,240
and brought to this position now,

160
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,440
that people have got, people have got full idea

161
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,480
as to Mother Principle that has worked out everything.

162
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,680
On this Mother Principle in India people are very sure

163
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,160
that it's the Mother who does everything,

164
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,760
and thus we have in India many, we should say,

165
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,960
many swayambus, means things

166
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
that are created of the Mother Earth.

167
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,400
For example, you know in Maharashtra

168
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,920
we have got Mahakali's place,

169
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,280
Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi,

170
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,440
and also we have got a place for the Adi Shakti.

171
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,640
Some people who have been to Nasik

172
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,960
must have seen Chaturshringi.

173
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,680
How many people have you been to Chaturshringi,

174
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,600
out of you? -- it's good.

175
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,360
So this Chaturshringi represents the Adi Shakti:

176
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:42,080
Adi Shakti which is the fourth dimension of this Power,

177
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,480
which gives you the ascent.

178
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
And ultimately through Mahalakshmi channel only,

179
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
you get your realization.

180
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,320
All this is a process,

181
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,000
all was created by the power of Adi Shakti.

182
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,760
It's a tremendous task.

183
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,120
The previous ones were not difficult,

184
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,920
because there for nature to create it was very easy.

185
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,000
The Mother Earth is one with the Adi Shakti,

186
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,040
the whole atmosphere is one with the Adi Shakti,

187
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,560
all the elements are one with the Adi Shakti,

188
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,160
so She could create all that without any difficulties.

189
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,960
But when human beings came, they got their freedom.

190
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
That's the only, I should say, the species

191
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,000
which fell into the maya of thinking

192
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,080
and of having the ego in them.

193
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,400
With this ego a maya worked on them, I should say,

194
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,520
and they forgot about the Principle

195
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,480
that created this universe --

196
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,200
they took it for granted.

197
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,560
They felt that this is their own right

198
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,800
that they are there, this is their own achievement

199
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,880
and they are the owners of everything.

200
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,000
This started working in their minds so much

201
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
that they invaded other countries,

202
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,080
they destroyed so many people and

203
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,640
they never felt bad about it.

204
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,200
All their lives they have been thinking about aggressing others,

205
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,240
controlling others and doing all kinds of harmful things.

206
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,200
But they never even thought or

207
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,240
never did any introspection to see that

208
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,760
what we are doing is very, very wrong

209
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,040
and it should not be done.

210
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Because of the freedom they have,

211
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,480
there's such a turmoil in this world.

212
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,320
And the people who were in charge of affairs,

213
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,360
they were very, very cruel and extremely --

214
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,160
had no feelings for the other people.

215
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,480
And this happened so many times in the, on this earth.

216
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,320
Now Sahaja Yoga has started.

217
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,240
Once Sahaja Yoga has started,

218
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,400
we have Sahaja yogis who are now receiving

219
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,120
the blessings of the Adi Shakti directly.

220
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,320
But still I must say, among Sahaja yogis also

221
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,480
we don't have people whom I would call as very well-matured.

222
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,760
They are Sahaja yogis, some of them, are just because

223
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,560
it's a fashion; maybe it should be better from their angle,

224
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,800
or from their selfish angle or whatever it is.

225
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,400
Is a very wrong thing.

226
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,360
If you are in Sahaja Yoga you must know now

227
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,480
you are responsible for the whole world.

228
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,200
You are the only people who have come forward,

229
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,720
you are the only people who have achieved something.

230
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,960
And then at this juncture

231
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,600
you should behave in a manner that,

232
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,440
that behooves a big saint or a realized soul;

233
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,120
but sometimes you find them behaving in such a manner,

234
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,160
is shocking sometimes.

235
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,200
They have no respect for themselves or for others,

236
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,400
and their whole attitude is very funny.

237
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,400
Some of them are money-oriented, some of them are power-oriented.

238
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,640
And those who are power-oriented are more dangerous, I think,

239
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,320
than money-oriented;

240
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,760
because those who are power-oriented

241
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,920
try to bring such bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

242
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,800
They are very insulting, dominating and horrible people.

243
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,000
Their whole attitude is to achieve power in Sahaja Yoga,

244
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,200
and they try all tricks to achieve that power.

245
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,520
But for some time they, they look all right --

246
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,400
after some time you'll find

247
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,960
they'll all disappear from the field of Sahaja Yoga.

248
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,080
It's a very big cleansing process going on.

249
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,120
You must understand that you have come in the,

250
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:01,000
in the field of very high consciousness

251
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,800
where you are in contact with the Divine.

252
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,080
Now here if you behave like ordinary people

253
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,400
who have no divinity within them,

254
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,960
how long will you continue like this?

255
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,080
So this is very important that you should try to meditate

256
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,920
and evolve yourselves,

257
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,000
and become really very good Sahaja yogis.

258
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,040
In some places we are very, very lucky.

259
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,280
In some, some countries we are very, very lucky.

260
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,920
But in some countries I find the people are just deaf and dumb.

261
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,880
They can't understand Sahaja Yoga.

262
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,720
For My program they do come,

263
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,080
and afterwards just they disappear.

264
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,120
This one I think is also --

265
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,720
Sahaja yogis are responsible for this.

266
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,440
The way they go about,

267
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,400
the way they want to do Sahaj work is not Sahaj.

268
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,800
Must be something definitely wrong with the whole thing,

269
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,160
and that's why it's not working out the same way

270
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,000
as it is working out in many places.

271
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,240
So I have to tell you that all this is there,

272
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,200
that Adi Shakti is there,

273
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,840
and all this has happened through Adi Shakti.

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,160
But now the further work has to be done

275
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,040
through you people because you are the channels,

276
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,160
you are the one who have to transform people.

277
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,240
Now everybody should understand and know

278
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,880
how many people we have given realization.

279
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,200
We have to think about it:

280
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,160
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

281
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,760
Once I was traveling by plane and I saw it was so --

282
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,280
met a lady who was sitting next to Me,

283
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,960
and she was so hot, I couldn't understand.

284
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,240
Then she told me she is a disciple of a guru

285
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,840
and very proud of it, and she started telling Me

286
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,640
all about him and things.

287
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,920
I was amazed, that look at this woman,

288
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,040
she hasn't got anything from him and she was just saying,

289
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,000
"I have given so much money to him,

290
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,520
I have done this thing to him," and all those things.

291
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,240
But she had nothing, and despite that

292
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,320
she was talking to Me,

293
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,080
a stranger person, about the guru.

294
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
But in Sahaja Yoga I've seen people are rather shy.

295
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,400
They don't want to talk about Sahaja Yoga openly to others,

296
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,600
which is a very wrong thing you are doing because

297
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,080
you are responsible for this work.

298
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,920
You have been given realization --

299
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,880
of course you were seeking, everything is all right --

300
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,400
but all of you must try to give realizations to others.

301
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,280
I must say that somehow men have been more dynamic

302
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
and working it out.

303
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,680
The women in Sahaja Yoga are not yet coming up

304
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
to that level as they should.

305
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,360
They have to be more sensible about it,

306
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,040
and they have to work it out.

307
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,760
They can do it, but only trouble is, I think

308
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,560
they have certain minor problems

309
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,280
about which they are worried.

310
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,720
Always I get letters from ladies saying this is wrong,

311
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,720
that is wrong, complaining all the time;

312
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,240
when I'm so fed up of their letters now that

313
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,600
I think they're useless to read them also.

314
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,800
So I have to tell you all that it is important

315
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,240
that men because they are dynamic,

316
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,160
women should be much more,

317
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,600
because they are shakti and I am a woman.

318
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,760
So I find that the men are more sort of active

319
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
and dynamic about Sahaja Yoga,

320
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,160
and I don't know what is the reason why women are not.

321
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,560
They can transform so many people.

322
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,000
They can do so much good to others.

323
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,720
They can bring so much love and compassion,

324
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,240
because this love and compassion

325
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,080
is a quality of a mother, of a woman.

326
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,000
And if the women don't have that quality,

327
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,080
it's useless to be a woman.

328
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,000
All the time if you are busy about your

329
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,040
useless things like fashions or faces and all that,

330
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,480
then the time is all wasted.

331
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,840
You have a short time now, you've got your realization

332
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,800
and you must decide what have you done so far,

333
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,680
what have you achieved for so far.

334
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,440
But I would say that also in Sahaja Yoga I've found

335
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,400
there are all kinds of funny ideas growing here.

336
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,080
Like certain rituals they'll take up.

337
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,440
Then they prescribe certain rituals,

338
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,840
they'll talk about it,

339
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,160
and kind of a power-orientation is there.

340
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,360
They want to oppress others,

341
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,800
and they want to take over and frighten people

342
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,760
and behave in such a manner that,

343
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,040
as if they are very good.

344
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,280
Some of them start saying that

345
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,040
"Mataji said so. This is Mataji's ideas."

346
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,800
By their own power-orientation

347
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,800
they manufacture things and talk like that and ...

348
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,240
But ask them,

349
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,520
"How many have you given realization?"

350
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,640
The first thing is, you must determine is positivity:

351
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,000
how many you have given realization?

352
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,040
Is just talking about others, criticizing others,

353
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,680
talking about the defects of Sahaja Yoga,

354
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,000
seeing in the Sahaja yogis;

355
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,720
is I would say, is still a very preliminary things

356
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,920
that have happened before, and it should stop now.

357
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,240
Now as it is, once this book is out,

358
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,400
all over the world, it will be known about our work;

359
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,360
we'll be not challenged any more.

360
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,800
But still we have to see for ourselves that

361
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,480
if we have achieved this kind of recognition

362
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,640
then we should be up to that,

363
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,160
our capability should be up to that.

364
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,680
We should not be lagging behind.

365
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,240
For example, if you ask some Sahaja yogis,

366
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,960
specially Sahaja yoginis,

367
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,040
they don't know much about Sahaja Yoga,

368
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,960
they don't know about chakras,

369
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,760
they don't know anything about the deities;

370
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,440
nothing they know -- how can they be Sahaja yogis?

371
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
You have to know all about it.

372
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,720
Only thing that you don't realize,

373
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,880
that it's not outside that you are a Sahaja yogi

374
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,680
but it is inside.

375
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,200
Inside you have to have that kind of an understanding

376
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:42,080
of the chakras and of Sahaja Yoga, how it works,

377
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
how it helps you.

378
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,280
Now supposing if I'm the Source of that energy,

379
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,560
which you know very well I am,

380
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,880
then you achieve yours also,

381
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,440
a kind of a perfection about dealing with people

382
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,880
and bringing them to Sahaja Yoga.

383
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,400
Is a very important work you have to do,

384
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,480
is to bring Sahaja yogis in Sahaja Yoga.

385
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,760
What I find that some people are very much still lagging behind,

386
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,240
and it's very surprising that they live in that country,

387
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
they are part and parcel of that country

388
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,160
and they are not bothered.

389
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,920
Under these circumstances they'll be blamed,

390
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,480
that "Why didn't you do? Why didn't you find out

391
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,560
the ways and methods of convincing at least your countrymen?"

392
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,440
So Sahaja Yoga at the brink of growth

393
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,560
cannot grow only with one country or two countries;

394
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,200
all the countries have to be brought into Sahaja Yoga.

395
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,920
All the people that we could call into Sahaja Yoga

396
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,680
will be a very good idea.

397
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,400
And then we have books to convince people,

398
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,480
we have to talk to them about it.

399
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,160
But what I find about Sahaja yogis,

400
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,480
that once they start spreading Sahaja Yoga also

401
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,520
their ego comes up, and this thing --

402
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,280
they are very great Sahaja yogis, they are great leaders --

403
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,640
all this kind of stupid ideas

404
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,760
walk into their heads, which is wrong.

405
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,200
You have to just think in a very humble manner.

406
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,720
The more you have, the more you become humble,

407
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,080
like a tree when laden with fruits, it bends down.

408
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,720
In the same way you have to be very humble.

409
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,000
But that humility is sometimes very difficult,

410
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,400
because the culture of the West is not humble culture --

411
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:49,800
it's a culture of aggression, culture of domination.

412
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,160
So far they have been, they think because of

413
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,240
domination they could go all over the world,

414
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,080
they could achieve so many things.

415
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,440
What have they achieved? Nothing.

416
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,360
In their own countries if you see,

417
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,160
there's drug addiction.

418
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,680
Why should people take to drugs so much?

419
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
Then all kinds of sinful things they do

420
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
which I don't want to mention,

421
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,720
but you know what they are doing -- which in India,

422
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,040
which is a poorer country, one cannot even think of.

423
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,160
Such things are happening around you,

424
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,720
so find out what's wrong where

425
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,800
and how you can correct these things,

426
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,800
if you can help them.

427
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,800
Actually now, as I told you,

428
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,840
I am going to start some sort of organizations

429
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,920
that will do good to human beings.

430
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,880
But you all can join also.

431
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,960
You can also start in your own countries something like that.

432
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,320
But first you have to get rid of your ego.

433
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,760
See, that once happens to you,

434
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,800
then only your attention would be steady.

435
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,480
And this ego is very simple for you

436
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,040
because you worship Christ, and the Christ is the one

437
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,680
who was settled on the Agnya chakra.

438
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,320
You all worship Christ,

439
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,000
but that humility of Christ is not there --

440
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,840
just the opposite of it.

441
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,840
It has happened everywhere that

442
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,880
whatever is preached in the religion,

443
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,160
people did just the opposite of it.

444
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,160
For example Hindu religion,

445
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,400
I would say Hindu philosophy is that

446
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,920
in everybody resides the spirit.

447
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,560
Now in everybody if there is spirit,

448
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,200
then how can you have different caste systems,

449
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,000
and how can you have somebody higher and lower?

450
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,280
Other way round, now Christ has said

451
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,080
that you have to forgive, forgive everyone,

452
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,280
and you have to humble down.

453
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,600
And that's what one finds,

454
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,400
that among Christians they don't know humility,

455
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,480
they have no idea of humility.

456
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,000
Men are like that, women are like that,

457
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,600
and the men and women then go on fighting.

458
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,240
There's no question of anybody being humble,

459
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,080
peaceful and all that.

460
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,760
So it's very artificially they are showing off

461
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,080
that they are very philanthropist and all that,

462
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,080
but inside in their heart I don't find there is any love,

463
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,400
there's any compassion in the real sense of the word.

464
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,680
So when we are dealing with reality,

465
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,880
we have to know that we cannot just go on

466
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,560
with things which are artificial,

467
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,080
which are befooling others,

468
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
but we have to really become that.

469
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,280
Once if you become that, when you are really like that,

470
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,560
then only you have done the job for which you are born

471
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,520
at this juncture of blossom-times.

472
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,240
Otherwise you could have been born earlier

473
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,000
and could have been something different.

474
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,640
But you are specially born so you realize your value,

475
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,400
realize yourself what you are and try to understand,

476
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,560
have a self-respect, and try to do things

477
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,000
which are very important as Sahaja yogis.

478
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,320
Of course you are doing a job,

479
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,400
you are doing other things;

480
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,760
but you'll be amazed, if you do work of Sahaja Yoga

481
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,320
you will find more time for everything.

482
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Once you start doing God's work, God does your work.

483
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,560
And that's how you'll be amazed

484
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,760
how you get so much time to do the right thing.

485
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,040
Now it is for you to go back and introspect,

486
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,560
see for yourself.

487
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,640
Now the Adi Shakti Herself has come.

488
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,400
But I'm very simple, I'm very simple to look at;

489
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,440
in My behavior I'm very, very humble,

490
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,160
and people take Me for granted.

491
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,560
I don't do anything. I don't want to punish you,

492
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,040
I don't want to do anything like that.

493
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,840
But you yourself get punished,

494
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,840
you yourself become useless

495
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,120
if you do not look after yourself and grow yourself.

496
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,680
This finding is so great,

497
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,960
and this man had never known Me before.

498
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,160
He's very learned but he's very humble,

499
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,800
and what he told Me that

500
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,800
"Just imagine, I'm sitting before the Creator of this world

501
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,360
and still I'm very normal."

502
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,880
So I said, "What should happen to you, what do you think?"

503
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,560
So he said, "Mother, it's a big thing to realize

504
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,440
that I am sitting before You,

505
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,400
and that You are here."

506
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,760
I said, "It's good that you don't feel My presence

507
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,000
so oppressive or so dominating. I'm very happy."

508
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,240
"No," he says, "I just feel the love,

509
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,040
just feel the compassion, that's what it is."

510
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,080
We have to know that we should have

511
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,560
just love and compassion;

512
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,880
compassion and love for ourselves

513
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,000
in the way that we should not harm anybody's heart.

514
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,160
To say something to hurt someone is very sinful.

515
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,520
But some people enjoy that very much,

516
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,520
they think they are very clever -- it's not so.

517
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,320
When you talk to someone you must say something

518
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,840
which is very soothing and good.

519
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,240
Another thing is the temper of a person, is a temper --

520
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,360
that a slightest thing here and there,

521
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,280
they get into tempers.

522
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,240
Now this has to be told, this temper, that "You keep quiet.

523
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,840
I have nothing to do with you."

524
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,040
That is one thing.

525
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,720
Then there are people who are very subtly,

526
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
I should say, power-oriented, very subtle.

527
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,880
They have tricks and trades by which they know how to control others.

528
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,840
What are you going to gain out of it?

529
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,320
What is your gain?

530
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,640
By doing all these things what will happen?

531
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,240
In these worldly things you might be little bit popular,

532
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,280
little bit having a position or something;

533
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,040
but what is it, after all? That is not going to help you.

534
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,240
What is going to help you the most is

535
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,960
to make yourself a perfect channel for Sahaja Yoga,

536
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
to be a perfect channel.

537
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,600
In that you will be amazed how you'll be helped.

538
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,560
So I would say for you people who are in the West,

539
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,680
I would say you must develop humility.

540
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,080
It's very important.

541
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,480
I was surprised, in Russia itself

542
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,080
the people are not only humble, but such dedication,

543
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,880
such dedication -- unbelievable!

544
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,120
They don't even raise their eyes to Me.

545
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,440
I don't know how they got this idea.

546
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,040
This is not after the discovery, but even before that.

547
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,160
They were so nice and so humble and so full of love;

548
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,240
and even the children brought Me small, small presents, you know,

549
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,080
just to give Me, so sweetly.

550
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,080
This is something surprising how these people in Russia

551
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,920
have achieved that capability to become.

552
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,280
And I think in the West, Russia is the country

553
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,480
which will achieve a very great height in spirituality,

554
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,560
and that means they'll be the most powerful people.

555
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,480
Let us see what you are doing in your own country

556
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,840
and how you are going to work it out.

557
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,840
See, there are so many things you can do very easily,

558
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,480
if you see for yourself that you are the instrument of the Divine.

559
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,560
And then your temperament will change,

560
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,800
the nature will change; you'll become a very, very

561
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,160
sweet person, likable person,

562
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,680
and everybody will think that this is a saint walking around.

563
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,000
So that's all I have to say about this.

564
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,760
Whatever is the discovery is not a discovery for Me,

565
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,840
but discovery for the whole world.

566
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,840
And I'm sure once it is established

567
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,560
and is exposed to the whole world,

568
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,936
things will change for you, and for Me also.

569
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,600
May God bless you.
