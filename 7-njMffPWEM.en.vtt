00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.640
Today, you are all here to worship your Guru.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.280
It is

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.200
a common practice, specially in India,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.560
that you must

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.800
worship your guru,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.920
and the guru has to

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.400
fully be in control of his disciples.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.920
Guru Principle is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.480
extremely strict,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.680
and the strictness made many people

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.880
could not conform to the ideals of a disciple.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.120
In those days the guru had to be,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.920
absolutely, the authority

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.280
and it was

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.760
the guru who would decide

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.880
which disciples he’ll have.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.320
And one had to go into great tapasya,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.440
to great penances, to even become a disciple.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.360
And this hardship

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.280
was the only way the guru used to judge.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.680
Gurus would always live in jungles

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.240
and they would select their disciples, very few, very, very few

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.800
and they had to go and beg food

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.760
from the neighboring villages,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.360
and cook food for their guru with their own hands,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.560
and feed the guru.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.400
That sort of

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.560
guru business is not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.680
That basically we must understand

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.560
that the difference between those styles

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.680
of guruship and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.120
that we have now is this,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.440
that very few individuals

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.760
were given the chance to become the guru, very few.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.080
And these few also were selected out of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.200
quite a lot of people and they felt

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.560
that they were something really special that they are being selected,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.800
chosen, and that whatever

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.600
they will have to go through is all welcome.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.440
With this idea, they became the disciples.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.720
But Sahaja Yoga is a very different thing.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.080
I would say just the opposite.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.880
First of all, your Guru is a Mother

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.520
and who suffers from Sandrakaruna.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.440
At the slightest things that happen to you

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.320
My eyes get filled with tears.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.840
So as a Mother

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.840
to be a Guru is a very difficult thing.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.880
At the same time, for you to achieve heights is also difficult.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.040
Because you get lost

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.880
when I love you so much

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.840
and in that love you forget sometimes,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.720
that the progress in your being is very slow.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.880
It is important

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.960
that in Sahaja Yoga you have to be strict with yourself.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.480
That’s why I said that you have to be your own guru,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.200
which people do not understand what it means.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.720
You have to be your own guru means you have to guide yourself;

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.280
you have to treat yourself as your disciple

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.600
and you have to trim yourself.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.840
If you do not understand

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.720
the responsibility as Sahaja Yogi,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.600
of working it out yourself everything,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.600
you cannot move very fast,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.080
because

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.000
it is a different type

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.440
of relationship between the Guru and the disciples.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.320
So first I have always said you become your own guru.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.320
So you have to make

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.760
a lot of introspection

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.400
and fix your ideals.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.520
Before you I am sitting.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.640
You have seen Me how I am.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.680
I can eat anything;

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.920
I need not eat at all for days together.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.640
I can sleep anywhere;

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.320
I may not sleep at all.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:25.680
I travel for miles together untiringly.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.800
I have this energy because

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.480
I’m a Guru of Myself also.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.200
So the first thing is that there should be lot of introspection,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.520
“What’s wrong with me?” Not wrong with others.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.760
“What’s wrong with me?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.280
Am I seeking the comfort of my body?

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:07.480
The attention, is it on my body or on my spirit?

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.960
If so, what am I doing?”

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.320
I think best thing is to write it down.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.160
“Can I sleep on the grass?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.760
Can I sit on the stone?”

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.040
You have to make this body work.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.240
“Can I sleep anytime I like,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.400
and can I keep awake anytime I like?”

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.480
I have seen people doze off.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.200
The reason is this, not that they are bad

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.200
or in any way indisciplined people

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.520
but because inside they are tired.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:02.240
If you are tired inside then you feel tired all the time.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.160
You’ll see on the television, if you see people in the West,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.240
they’re always sitting like this.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.200
Because they are so very tired.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.000
Why are they so tired? They don’t work so hard.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.680
So introspect how you behave.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.640
Now when you start introspecting yourself,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.240
you’ll also start introspecting your surroundings

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.040
and your styles
and your methods,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.800
and what you are doing to yourself

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
because of the conditionings of the outside.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.320
Now the conditionings of the outside in the West,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.200
are of a psychological nature.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.400
Indians have other conditionings which are also quite surprising,

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.520
or we should say the Western  people,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.960
they must wash their hand ten times,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.640
even if their skin comes out, they’ll go on washing like mad.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.240
They must have a bathroom attached to them all the time.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.360
They must have their baths.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.680
If they don’t have bath they are not comfortable.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.680
They have other conditionings also.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.331
All kinds of stupid conditionings they have

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.080
but the conditionings that we have in the West

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.040
are more psychological and that’s why

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.680
you cannot find out what’s wrong with you.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.000
The physical conditionings are not so dangerous,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.600
you can get over them or you can manage.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.080
But when you have conditioning of your psychology

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.280
you cannot understand what’s wrong with you.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.080
Now if you see, if you introspect around,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.760
what you will find is a very subtle thing.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.560
Firstly, that

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.640
because of the wars maybe, I don’t know why

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.880
but everybody is afraid of everyone.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.480
Specially I think, Freud.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.680
Because of Freud, even the mother is afraid of the child,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.760
and all these things to Indians are absolutely

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.320
they can’t understand this.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.960
But, you people know that very well.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.800
They won’t touch anybody;

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.680
they won’t hug anyone.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.480
First of all when they used to play football, they used to hug.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.080
But now I see they don’t hug they just touch hands like this.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.680
After sometime I think they may

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.080
just do like that or something.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.440
So frightened that nobody, even the children I’ve seen,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.680
are frightened of hugging their parents.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.640
So the expression of love is not there

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.720
and when there is no expression there is no love inside

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.200
and that’s how it goes on drying you up and drying you up and drying up.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:29.040
There was a little girl in Sahaja Yoga

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.640
and I had some present for that child.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.240
She was quite young, must have been about ten years of age.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.080
So I gave it to one Sahaja yogi, Western Sahaja yogi,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.160
that you go and give it to her and say that I have given.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.640
“No Mother. I won’t give.” I said, “Why?”

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.480
“She’ll misunderstand me.” I said, “What will she misunderstand?”

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.520
It has gone so much into the heads of people.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.400
And this has created really

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.640
the psychological insecurity within you.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.560
From very childhood this insecurity has been working,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.760
and that’s why you are frightened of each other.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.640
Even of your parents, of your brothers, your sisters.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.920
Psychologically you are suffering.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.440
And when first I came to England they used to say

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.280
it is the insecurity. I said, “What insecurity?

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.680
The whole world is afraid of the Western world.”

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.640
And what are they suffering from insecurity?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.000
They have made everybody insecure all over the world.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.480
And why, what are they insecure?

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.840
They are insecured within themselves

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.280
in their own society, in their own family,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.560
in their own groups.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.760
They are so much frightened of each other.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.880
So the first thing, you should be fearless.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.080
You are a Sahaja Yogi, you are no more immoral,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.920
cannot be immoral.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.880
If all the time if you start thinking that you are immoral,

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.360
and if you do something it is immoral,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.840
and that you have to go and do some confession somewhere,

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.920
then what is going to happen to you?

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.640
What sort of a personality you will have?

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.640
We have to change this by changing ourselves.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.320
So among Sahaja yogis there should be

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.680
no insecurities but maryadas.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.840
You must know how to respect each others privacy.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.680
The second thing that if you find with the Western mind,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.240
which is a very common thing,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.960
that they are bombarded by criticism.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.720
There are so many critics

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.360
that now there are no more artists left.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.480
Only critics are criticizing critics.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.560
All artists are finished.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.960
They are all the time criticized.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.440
Somebody will come in – there’s an education on criticism –

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.400
they may not know how to play any instrument,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.120
they may not know how to sing,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.960
but they can criticize all right.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.480
So all the time in your mind, is a way

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.480
that you always feel that somebody will criticize if you do this.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.160
All the time the fear is there that somebody will criticize.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.520
So, “Should I say or not?”

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.120
As Sahaja yogis, you shouldn’t worry about

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.560
these stupid people because they are blind.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.560
And if they want to criticize you, let them criticize.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.600
What does it matter? Makes no difference.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.960
But this you have to build up within yourself.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.840
Now the third is even worse,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.160
which I don’t know if you have noticed or not.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.080
I don’t know how it has gone into the heads of the Western minds

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.760
that you must always see

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.760
to the other side of the bank,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.720
even if you are standing on this side,

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.280
to be fair

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.680
and never to say something that you are sure of.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.840
Like you ask anyone, “How are you?” He’ll say …

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.840
Always.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.040
Nobody say, will say, “I am perfectly all right,

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.640
nothing wrong with me.”

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.960
“What’s wrong?”

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.440
“Perfectly all right, thank you very much.”

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.080
But it is never.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.520
They are not sure of themselves, all the time, is shaking.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.120
And this shaking inside

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:43.680
gives you a personality which can never progress.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.120
Progress comes when you put your step forward,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.560
you put your foot firmly on that point

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.320
and then put the second step forward,

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.080
like as you climb on a mountain.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
But in the first place only if you are still thinking

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.040
that it’s half way through,

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.200
then how can you go further?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.800
You’ll only move on two steps, this or that or this or that.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.840
This is another very big psychological

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.640
deterrent I should call it,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.800
or detrimental thing for your progress.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.600
Now the third thing you have learned

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.600
which is also, third or fourth maybe,

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.120
that you must argue out yourself.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.400
Like you have a problem,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.120
you’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, this problem I have got.”

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.760
This is very common with everyone,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.160
“I have this problem.”

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.040
I’ll say, “All right, this is the solution.”

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.680
Then you’ll come out, “No, no, no. But in this, this will happen.”

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.040
Then You tell another solution,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.640
“No, no, no, no, no Mother, this can't be this way.”

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.360
All right, You tell third solution,

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.760
“No Mother, in this, this can happen.”

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.840
Tell fourth, “This can happen.”

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.720
You are standing against yourself all the time.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.640
Then I have to say, “This is your problem, not Mine,

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.520
and I am giving you the solutions

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.480
and if you want to solve your problem,

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.120
better take a positive attitude.”

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.800
The brain is this way.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.160
In our Hindi language it’s called “ulti khopdi.”

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.800
You are all the time arguing against yourself.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.240
So how can you progress?

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:20.920
This is another great problem of the Western mind

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.080
that it doesn’t

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.720
try to face any problem as your own,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.840
but go on arguing with yourself like a lawyer.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.880
You see. there are two lawyers:

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.720
one yourself, another lawyer – go on arguing.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.840
So is a double personality in the body, being;

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.960
is not a single personality.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.960
As I said, it is very, very psychological

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.560
that people have to

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:05.480
take to this kind of a turn suddenly,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.360
without understanding how dangerous it is.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:22.760
With the enlightenment of your brain, this should disappear.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.320
On the contrary in Sahaja Yoga, it’s very dangerous.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.360
Because you say something, you are all Sahaja yogis,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.920
you are connected with the all-pervading power.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.760
Whatever you say gets connected

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.480
and it acts.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.920
Is very dangerous

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.080
for you people not to realize that you are realized souls,

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.280
and not to assume your own powers.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:08.320
Like you see, I have to say something secretly

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.720
then I must put My hand here and then say it

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.160
because it is connected to the mains.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:21.640
But supposing I keep it open like this and say something,

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.880
it goes to everyone.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.640
In the same way

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.920
whatever the Sahaja yogis say or desire or want,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.960
there are just people sitting there, see here and here,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.200
you have put them there.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.040
They are listening to you all the time.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.680
They are so anxious to do your work,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.920
“All right, you say so, done.”

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.720
So whatever you think or whatever you desire

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.280
or whatever you say, you have to be extremely careful.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.680
And when, now, I mean, old people, all right,

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.520
I can say that very conditioned, they have problems and all,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.480
but the generation that is here, most of them,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.560
are all capable of improving yourself

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:21.360
and making your brain straight

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.680
by bringing it backwards to the forward.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.000
This psychological problem you do not say.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.280
The another psychological problem is,

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.680
which you do not know, which is very surprising,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.920
that whatever is the

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.520
entrepreneur’s ideas

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.840
you must act,

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.320
because the whole fundamentals of Western life

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.040
is to see and to be seen.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.120
So, “Oh that’s the fashion so we should do like that.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.800
This is the fashion so we do like that.”

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.600
Like the other day, about a year back,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.920
I went to England and I found all the Sahaja Yoginis having their hair here

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.680
I said, “What’s this?”

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.360
So I asked an Indian girl, I said, “What is this supposed to be?”

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.360
“This is a new fashion.” I said, “What new fashion?”

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.720
Called as “ziprya” in Marathi you know, we call it ziprya fashion.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.280
The Maharashtrians can ….

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.760
And they all had their hair here you know, like this, all.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.480
I said, “My God, this is Agnya, this they are covering,

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.800
their eyes will become squinty.”

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.120
But the fashion if it comes,

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.480
and the whole fashion is with the hair alone.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.920
Hair I don’t know what.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.720
There’s so much interest in the hair.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.360
And they lose the hair so fast in these countries,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.400
without using the oil, which they should use.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.720
They lose their hair very fast.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.720
Starting from the hair, the Sahasrara.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.400
Then fashion means –

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.680
What is this these entrepreneurs,

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.000
these stupid people are creating ideas

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.120
and there why should we follow?

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.440
I don’t say that Sahaja yogis should all look alike, not at all.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.720
You can dress up the way you like; you can live the way you like

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.000
but you should not get yourself enslaved by any entrepreneurs.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.400
You are free people now – know that very well.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.200
Know that you are absolutely free

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:53.440
and your freedom is absolutely in the light of your enlightenment.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.760
You can never do wrong.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:02.160
But first of all, have that confidence within yourself

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.000
that whatever you have to do,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.480
you are not going to enslave yourself to entrepreneurs,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.560
what people have to say, how you will look,

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.200
how you will appear before.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.600
This is a very important point

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.320
that half of the time we are laboring just to look like many others.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.200
It’s very surprising

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.160
how these entrepreneurs have befooled the Western people.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.240
In India it won’t work, won’t work –

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.760
specially the Indian women.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.360
This “in-between” came, a mini sari,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.240
came up to Bombay for about four-five days, I think, disappeared.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.800
No Indian woman would wear a mini-sari, finished.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.280
Nothing doing.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.760
Any sort of fashion now, comes in India, doesn’t stay

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.800
because whatever clothes we have now in India -

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.560
is traditionally - has been there,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:13.080
has been tested and error and trial and error and trial,

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.440
and we know now this is the best, now stop it.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.800
At certain age you stop.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.760
This is the style that suits us the best.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.920
But anything goes on and the styles go on changing.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.480
And this is what you have to be very careful to see

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.520
that you do not take to stupid things,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.000
which are being created by entrepreneurs,

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.120
but to sensible things, which are required for you.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.240
So one of the enslavement I feel, is

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.520
that you have to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:58.160
But a slavery is very deep and is so psychological;

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:05.040
in so many ways it is extremely hidden

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.760
and so subtle that you cannot make it out.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.360
So, in the introspection you find out

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.840
what’s gone wrong with you,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.960
how you are made this way.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.200
“What’s wrong in my own personality –

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:34.840
it has come from all the surroundings

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.280
and the way people have been putting ideas into my head.”

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.200
You should have your own ideas.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.040
You shouldn’t worry what Plato said

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.440
and what Socrates said and what this thing said.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.680
What do you think?

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.720
After all, you are enlightened people.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.440
But then there is another psychological thing,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.640
which is even the worst.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.480
And that “Mother, if we are very sure,

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.800
then we are putting up our ego.”

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.120
They are so much afraid of their ego

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.000
that as if after some time they’ll take off.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.840
“The ego will bloat so much that we’ll take off.”

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.560
This is another fear people have, that if we assert,

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.440
“All right this is what I want, this is the right thing to do,

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.400
then I’ll get off so I don’t want to say such a thing;

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.200
I have an ego.”

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.560
So, with Sahaja Yoga also, certain fears have crawled in.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:49.560
One of them is that “Mother, I should not have any ego.”

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.240
Now, what is the problem of ego?

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.160
That also surprising despite all fear and everything.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.120
As a reaction to it people have developed

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.440
a kind of a protesting character.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.600
But again these entrepreneurs have pampered your ego.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.680
Like, in the morning you ask the child, “What will you have?”

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.480
Then child will say, “I’ll have this.”

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.760
The mother has to run and get it,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.640
or she must keep everything in the fridge.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.720
In India that’s not the case.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.960
Whatever is cooked in the house, you better have.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.000
If there is no salt, all right without salt, come along.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.960
Otherwise don’t eat, doesn’t matter.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.200
In any case you will eat.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.800
So when the disciplining comes within yourself

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.360
and you understand this,

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.920
then you do not say, “I desire only this, I desire only this.”

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.280
What you desire, you tell yourself:

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.360
“All right, you’ll not have it for one month, let’s see.”

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.200
Once I must tell you about Myself that

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.200
little bit comfort grew upon Me, sometimes, I think.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.480
So, we had, had a transfer,

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.120
and My family was not with Me at that time.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.760
We had only one small little bed where My husband slept.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.840
And I slept just on the bare cement on the earth,

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.240
and next day I started getting the pain in the body.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.600
I said, “All right.” I slept on the cement for one month.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.680
“On the cement you get pain? All right. Sleep now.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.480
One month,” I said, “I’m going to sleep on the cement.”

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.600
Then cement lost its power on Me.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.000
Then, might be the cement might be feeling the pain.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:15.760
So, that’s what you have to do, is to master your mind.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.920
Now the problem only will come:

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.760
"What is the discretion? - This ego will come up Mother.”

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.240
Because, your ego, as I said, is developed by reactions,

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.840
by protesting against things,

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.480
and also by the pampering of the entrepreneurs.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.920
All right, whatever may be the reason,

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.680
we are not going to psychoanalyze ourselves.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.760
But the fact is, also we have a ego problem.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.800
Why?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.320
I have already told you that, if a balloon is bloated many a times,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.840
it can easily be bloated.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.720
At the slightest air, it bloats.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.120
And that’s why you are afraid that suddenly

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.160
my ego might become so big

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.280
that I may be like a balloon in the air, somewhere moving.”

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.360
But, how to get rid of this is to know that

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.040
you are an enlightened soul.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.760
Respect yourself.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.960
Once you start respecting yourself,

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:38.120
you will not fall into any traps of ego.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.640
Very simple.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.280
Respect yourself.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.200
You have to say,

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.560
“I am a Sahaja yogi.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.200
how can I behave like this?

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.800
After all, I am a Sahaja yogi.”

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.360
A kind of a dignity that develops,

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.480
and then you will start feeling shy

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.680
of doing something that is stupid,

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.560
because ego makes you stupid, that’s the point is, absolutely.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:25.400
So now, if you develop this respect for yourself,

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.680
“I’m a Sahaja yogi,

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.960
so I can’t behave like this.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.680
I’m a Sahaja yogi.”

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.920
If you say like that to yourself,

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.040
then you will be amazed

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.680
that the dignity of a Sahaja yogi

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.760
will definitely keep you down to earth.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.520
You will not get into the trap of your ego.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.000
So one side is the conditioning, another side is this ego.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.440
Simple thing is ego.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.080
That dignity has to be developed.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.880
You’ll be surprised – among animals there are maryadas.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.400
Like a tiger won’t behave like a snake

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.280
and snake won’t behave like a tiger.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.920
So we are now Sahaja yogis.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.960
We are tigers among human beings, we are lions among humans,

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.320
the highest; we are the highest human beings.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:48.400
It’s not necessary to have ten, what you call,

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.560
medals on your body to show that you are something great

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.640
but you are Sahaja yogis, you are Mahayogis.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.320
So, develop that

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.680
respect

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.760
and you will be surprised the humility

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.200
will immediately came into you,

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.320
I mean will walk into you, humility.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.480
I have seen some Sahaja yogis sit like this,

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.160
sometimes sit like this,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.600
sometimes they,

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.000
one, if the Left Vishuddhi is there, like this,

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.320
Right Vishuddhi is there, like this.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:40.000
But then you see yourself.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.040
Like a bridegroom has to dress up

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.560
and he remembers, “I am the bridegroom,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.680
I cannot behave like other younger boys who will be there.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.880
I have to have my own personality.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.320
I am the bridegroom;

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.600
I am going for my wedding.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.480
I cannot behave like all my other friends are there.”

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.440
You have to behave in a particular manner.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.520
So assume this.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:14.760
Still we do not know that we are Sahaja yogis.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.520
Once we know we are Sahaja yogis,

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.360
that dignity will develop within us,

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.480
and with that dignity you’ll be amazed

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.480
you’ll also see what is wrong in your own country,

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.440
what is indignified.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.520
Now with the whatever has happened in France,

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.760
you can find out what’s wrong with French laws.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.280
But French are more interested in drinking and eating

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.480
and other things. So they never paid -

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.200
“Oh, let it be, what do we care for laws, let it be as it is,

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.680
doesn’t matter, who should bother about these things,

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.560
is nothing important.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.840
After all, if you can get something to drink .…”

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.080
You go to any French village, at seven time,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.640
you cannot meet anyone, even a drunkard.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.760
They are sitting inside and drinking, drinking.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.720
I mean that’s the main religion, main pastime.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.960
Next day with a hangover they come,

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.000
so they see everything the other way round.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:29.800
Like this fellow, these journalist who went to India,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.200
they saw an iron gate

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.880
and they thought this was the iron curtain of Hitler.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.520
Everything expanded, you know, so big,

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.520
crooked because hangover, you know.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.480
So the whole life in the West like a hangover.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.200
Either they see things too big or too small,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.920
they don’t see things as they are.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.960
Now most of these things are written, which you will read,

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.200
the psychology and all those things and the books,

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.520
mostly they are drunkards.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.560
If you see their lives, they have been drunkards.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.520
So whatever they have written,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.800
why should we take them so seriously?

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.240
Except for very few who were realized souls,

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.640
most of them were drunkards.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.480
Like those who wrote about Greek tragedies

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.480
must have been really drunkard people

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.320
In – they must be taking lot of things

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.720
inside and then must be writing something like that.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.960
Because most of the drunkards,

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.960
when they write, they say that “Why, why should I live, I must die.”

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.920
And like that we too have in India

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.680
many people who have written ghazals who always say that

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.760
“Why should we live, we should die.”

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.120
So if there’s one poet who has said,

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.280
“Now you are talking of dying, why don’t you die once for all?”

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.880
So, you will realize that

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.560
what you will write,

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:15.480
what you will say is higher than all these people.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.560
But Sahaja Yoga has worked so smoothly in you

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.840
that you do not know what you are.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.200
Today, on Guru Puja, you are worshiping your Guru.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.640
At the same time I bow to your guru within yourself.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.680
Let your guru come up and show itself.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:53.640
Specially the kind of a Guru you have –

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:59.160
I am not strict with you, I am very gentle.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.880
Because, as I told you, fundamentally is a different thing

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.080
is that it is not for an individual, but it is for the collective.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.400
And if something has to spread collectively,

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.560
then you have to understand

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.520
that it has to be only love that is going to work it.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.400
There is no other way we can spread Sahaja Yoga

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.240
because we cannot be like Hitler giving wrong ideas of hatred.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:34.960
Either it could be hatred or love.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.680
You teach people we hate this one – fundamentalism,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.960
this, that – you’ll get thousands ready to fight.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:48.160
You can elevate their baser self and say,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.720
“All right, come along, let us fight.”

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.920
Racialism, this, that, anything, even nationalism.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.160
All right, they are people.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.600
But when I say love, is very different.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.160
Try to understand.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.880
And because of our collective work, we have to know

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:12.400
that love is a source of energy

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.960
that makes things grow

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.600
in a living manner.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.880
It is the energy which is a living energy.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.920
Try to understand now. This is, people don’t understand.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.720
Love doesn’t mean that you hug somebody or do something,

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.920
but living energy that understands,

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.000
that makes you grow.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.120
I hope you have seen My books, and I hope you have read it.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:46.160
In that I have described you to you very clearly

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:51.440
what is the living energy within us that works,

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.400
and anything that is working. For example see this flower.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.560
Now, I cannot order this one to go straight.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.680
It’s moving in its own way – let it be.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.960
It looks nice because no flower should look like another flower.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.480
Living energy never creates the same thing exactly than another.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.200
Only plastics can be done.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:19.040
Now, when it is growing, it is growing in its own way.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.160
So whatever is built in within you, which is a living energy,

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:28.480
built in, but living energy, and a living thing that works –

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.560
it blossoms by itself.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.720
The water of pure love is to be given.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:46.120
In pure love what you see in another person, as a guru,

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:53.320
“What’s the matter with myself

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.680
where it is obstructing me to go further.”

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:03.040
In another person, as a guru, what you see

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.600
is how to handle this man, with love,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.840
so that he comes closer to reality.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.640
Is a very gentle process

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.760
is very loving process,

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.840
and nothing like really enjoying your love.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.160
Just to know that I love so many people itself is so great.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.520
And you too see feel that “I love so many.”

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.800
But it should be samadrishti – means:

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.040
With the same eyes you should see everyone.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.360
You see everybody with the same eyes, isn’t it?

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.680
Only two eyes are there.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:00.680
But, you see everyone with the same eyes – they are different.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.760
All right, you see them as different.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.040
But you do not … your eyes do not discriminate.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.480
Your eyes do not see somebody black, somebody white,

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.840
somebody blue.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.600
They see what they are.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:25.320
When you start seeing with samadrishti, means the same eyes,

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.240
same sight,

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.480
not to change your ideas.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:39.560
Because, what happens that your own mind twists it,

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.680
and you start seeing somebody as different, somebody as different.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.320
Now, with the eyes I see the fan.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:53.520
But supposing My mind is off, I might see as a human being.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.880
So if you are a sane person,

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.840
then you will see everyone as they are.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.640
This is samadrishti is that

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.480
you have the same eyes for everyone.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:13.360
Do not get twisted, so that you cannot have:

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.960
somebody is your special friend,

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.520
somebody is number two friend, somebody as number ten friend

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.560
and some as your enemy.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:27.560
Once you start looking at things like that,

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:34.000
everything will get into proper shapes.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.240
Otherwise, one can go crazy.

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.520
Also, it should be samyak.

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.320
Samyak means “integrated”.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.000
There should be an integrated knowledge.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.040
Like the eyes when they see,

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.160
they see where you are sitting, where you are,

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.040
where is this person, where is that person,

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.680
what is the relationship.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.800
So the knowledge about others

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.840
is in relationships with each other.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:16.640
Now supposing there’s a gentleman who has a child,

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:21.120
and there’s a problem between that gentleman and the child.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.560
To approach that person,

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.960
you must know that he has a child;

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:33.080
not to just make him separated from others, singularizing.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.640
You take somebody, say, he is from, say from England

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:41.160
or he is from Italy.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.880
Then try to understand him

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.480
that he is from that particular background

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:53.600
and that background is around him, so he is like that.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.680
If you can have this kind of a full knowledge of others,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:02.600
there will be no problems, no quarreling, nothing.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.240
Otherwise there is a conflict all the time

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.560
and that’s how one feels very tired.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:18.640
Eyes do not react; eyes just see;

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.920
whatever is there, they just see.

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.440
Eyes never react,

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.000
but the mind reacts.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.120
And this reaction is the one which is responsible

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.560
for spoiling your attitude towards people.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.200
So now,

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.480
you should have a witness state.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.000
As Gyaneshwara said, “Niranjan pahane. –

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.440
Niranjan pahane”

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.720
To see somebody without any reaction.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.520
Just to see and you’ll know everything about that person,

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.840
as soon as you see that person.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.480
"Niranjan pahane”

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.480
Because, as long as your brain is there

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.920
you do not see that person as he is.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.280
But as soon as you see that person,

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.800
you just know what it is.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.560
And then, immediately you will know

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.080
his chakras, his kundalini, everything you’ll penetrate.

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.040
But your mind, which is loaded with nonsense,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.000
will not allow you to go to that level.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:37.040
So the niranjan pahane, the one where you just see something,

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.280
that kind of a eye we have to develop it.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:49.360
So, with that a detachment starts,

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.800
automatically you do not criticize anybody

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.120
because your mind is like this against that person;

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.600
you do not love somebody because your mind thinks this way;

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.320
you too cannot form groups;

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.560
you cannot have some people who are dear to you, some are not.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.800
Sometimes, if I do not smile at some people

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.400
then they grumble and say,

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.880
“This time Mother didn’t smile at me.”

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.695
I mean, I cannot keep all the time a smile, you see.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:31.640
You must also think of My muscles.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:39.000
All the time how can I keep My smile on, you know?

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.920
But there are people who feel very bad that

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:44.440
“You see, this time Mother didn’t smile.”

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.680
So I have to go on smiling all the time at every one.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.600
I try.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.320
So the

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.920
attitude towards others

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.280
has to be with niranjan

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.800
attitude, because it’s a collective work.

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.160
It’s not strict;

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.000
it is not in any way clamping anything

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.040
because it’s a living work,

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.360
absolutely it’s living, we cannot.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:38.400
But it is definitely the work, which

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:45.240
creates harmony, love,

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.480
affection, feeling of oneness.

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.160
Imagine, to think about someone

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:58.120
who is not kind to you or he’s … is a horrible thing.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:03.280
Better think how nice you could be to that person.

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:09.080
So the attitude should be that

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.160
how nice I am going to be with that person, you know.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.160
See, somebody is angry with you,

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.960
is easy to fight, “Come along. You are angry, I am angry.”

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.440
No. Go and just tickle.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.640
Simple thing like that,

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.840
and enjoy.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.320
Because you cannot enjoy hatred;

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.680
you cannot enjoy rivalry;

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:41.200
you cannot enjoy separatedness.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:45.920
Like this hand has to enjoy this hand,

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.280
in the same way you have to enjoy each other.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:55.640
If you cannot enjoy then you have lost the point,

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.960
lost the point.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:08.360
So, in the collective progress we have to know that we cannot

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.080
progress if we have no sense of collectivity,

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.520
that we are part and parcel of one person.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.960
If I pull My one ear, it’s not that My ear will come out

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.600
but it will give pain to the whole body.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.360
That’s why I say pull both is better.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.880
And when you start, you see, seeing this way yourself,

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:44.520
then you’ll be amazed a kind of a sweet humor about yourself develops.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:51.160
And you really become a very interesting, magnetic personality,

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:59.000
and a very enjoyable person, extremely enjoyable.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.400
Everybody will seek your company.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:08.760
This is what is the sign of your Guru Principle being enlightened.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.520
Of course, they have said that you should get detachment;

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.400
you should not have any attachment to this and that and that and that.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.560
This is all talking.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.400
But actually, only introspection

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.240
and assumption

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.800
or, we can say,

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:34.440
the knowledge of your own depth,

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.720
itself, will give you that feeling.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:45.000
If you have that knowledge that I am a Sahaja Yogi,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.280
and my depth of divinity is so great.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.880
That itself will be more than sufficient

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:03.920
for you to exist as the topmost guru.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.960
Actually, I am no more a Guru, I was never a Guru –

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.160
I am a Mother; I am hopeless Guru.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:16.000
Because, a Guru who cannot be strict is useless,

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.560
and I have to prepare Myself to say things, you know.

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.040
If there’s problem between two people,

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.600
and then if there’s some gap of time

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:28.320
when I have to say to them, then I start,

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.400
“How to become strict?” I tell Myself.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.400
“Hah” spontaneously if something comes,

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:40.200
then I say, “Why are doing like this?” At the most. Spontaneously.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:45.520
So, you have to develop this special style of guruship

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.440
within yourself, which is for the collective working.

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:54.280
Again, remember it is for the collective working.

00:55:56.280 --> 00:56:01.280
So today, you worship your Guru Principle within yourself

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.120
when you are worshiping Me.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:07.200
I would not say that you should try to follow Me,

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.720
because I am hopeless in many things.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:15.080
Say, banking I don’t understand, money I don’t understand,

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.080
I mean there’s so many things I don’t know, really.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.360
I am hopeless, law I don’t understand.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.960
I mean, you should not be like Me, agreed.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.560
But,

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.920
you should be able to say as I say that

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:34.200
“You see, I have these problems.”

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:45.160
But one thing for sure you must have

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:50.560
complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:55.400
or desire to know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:03.160
If that works out,

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:10.440
then you will swim into this ocean of knowledge,

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.720
like a jet.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.040
And whatever you want,

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.680
whatever you want to know, you will know.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.640
But there should be a desire to know.

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.240
Never get satisfied

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.960
that I know sufficiently enough about Sahaja Yoga, no never.

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:32.400
In all other things you can be satisfied.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:37.120
But only on one thing, that's Sahaja Yoga, still,

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.560
I have to know through my brains,

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:47.280
and my heart

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.920
should have that knowledge.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.160
It should be in my heart, not only in my brain.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:57.200
I should know through my brain, it should be in my heart.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:06.680
Like when you see a film, you see King Kong.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.160
Then you know it’s King Kong,

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.640
all right, this is a film, doesn’t matter.

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.840
Normally our knowledge is like that.

00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.120
But if you see Mr. King Kong standing here,

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.400
“Oh my God,

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.480
he’s already here.”

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.560
In the same way, when our knowledge is in the brain,

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:34.680
it is just like a film, is away from … it’s not in our heart.

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:39.920
But when it is heart, it acts, it works.

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.160
It doesn’t work through brain.

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.920
In the brain it just stays but in the heart it works.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.280
And in the heart resides the spirit.

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:55.000
Is very simple, that

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.720
we are people

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.280
who are more living with our brains, not with our heart.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:06.160
But know that we are in reality.

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:09.320
You see, King Kong is standing before us.

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.640
You are not seeing a film; it’s in reality.

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.200
And in reality,

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:20.160
the heart has to work, not the brain,

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.800
because reality is only through the heart,

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.320
not through the brain.

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.320
Once you understand this,

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.920
then you’ll open your heart, enlarge it,

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.000
“Now this is in my heart.”

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:39.560
So the whole thing will be so clear-cut in your head

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.040
you will know everything clearly.

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.840
What is to be done, how to react, how to work it out.

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.080
If you put all this knowledge of Sahaja Yoga into your heart –

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.320
first of all you’ll have to enlarge your heart

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.440
otherwise you can’t put this ocean –

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.360
and then you see, “This is Sahaj Yoga.”

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.600
To Me everything seems to be Sahaj Yoga,

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.000
buying this house, coming to this place,

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.680
all this is Sahaj Yoga. I can see clearly.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.480
Anything that I see, I connect it to Sahaj Yoga immediately,

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.120
“This is Sahaja Yoga.”

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.800
Why this is so? This is because of Sahaj Yoga.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.640
This is Sahaj Yoga.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.360
So everywhere you start seeing Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:29.000
when your heart knows what your brain knows.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.880
I have known people who know all the mantras very well,

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.040
everything very well and all that but in the heart.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.520
So put it in the heart.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.000
In Sahaja Yoga the guru is not

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.880
through his brain but through his heart.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.240
May God bless you all.
