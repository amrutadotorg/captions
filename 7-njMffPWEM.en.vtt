00:03.520 --> 00:09.640
Today, you are all here to worship your Guru.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.280
It is

00:23.600 --> 00:31.200
a common practice, specially in India,

00:31.600 --> 00:34.560
that you must

00:36.960 --> 00:39.800
worship your guru,

00:40.120 --> 00:43.920
and the guru has to

00:44.120 --> 00:51.400
fully be in control of his disciples.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.920
Guru Principle is

01:00.120 --> 01:04.480
extremely strict,

01:06.960 --> 01:12.680
and the strictness made many people

01:13.520 --> 01:20.880
could not conform to the ideals of a disciple.

01:21.920 --> 01:28.120
In those days the guru had to be,

01:31.880 --> 01:36.920
absolutely, the authority

01:37.160 --> 01:41.280
and it was

01:45.600 --> 01:49.760
the guru who would decide

01:50.000 --> 01:52.880
which disciples he’ll have.

01:53.480 --> 02:01.320
And one had to go into great tapasya,

02:01.520 --> 02:07.440
to great penances, to even become a disciple.

02:10.520 --> 02:14.360
And this hardship

02:14.560 --> 02:19.280
was the only way the guru used to judge.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.680
Gurus would always live in jungles

02:26.880 --> 02:31.240
and they would select their disciples, very few, very, very few

02:31.640 --> 02:36.800
and they had to go and beg food

02:38.520 --> 02:42.760
from the neighboring villages,

02:43.040 --> 02:47.360
and cook food for their guru with their own hands,

02:47.560 --> 02:50.560
and feed the guru.

02:56.280 --> 03:00.400
That sort of

03:00.880 --> 03:05.560
guru business is not in Sahaja Yoga.

03:07.080 --> 03:11.680
That basically we must understand

03:11.880 --> 03:17.560
that the difference between those styles

03:17.760 --> 03:21.680
of guruship and

03:23.280 --> 03:27.120
that we have now is this,

03:27.320 --> 03:31.440
that very few individuals

03:31.680 --> 03:37.760
were given the chance to become the guru, very few.

03:38.440 --> 03:44.080
And these few also were selected out of

03:46.320 --> 03:50.200
quite a lot of people and they felt

03:50.400 --> 03:54.560
that they were something really special that they are being selected,

03:54.760 --> 04:00.800
chosen, and that whatever

04:01.560 --> 04:05.600
they will have to go through is all welcome.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.440
With this idea, they became the disciples.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.720
But Sahaja Yoga is a very different thing.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.080
I would say just the opposite.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.880
First of all, your Guru is a Mother

04:25.600 --> 04:29.520
and who suffers from Sandrakaruna.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.440
At the slightest things that happen to you

04:33.640 --> 04:37.320
My eyes get filled with tears.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.840
So as a Mother

04:43.040 --> 04:46.840
to be a Guru is a very difficult thing.

04:47.480 --> 04:53.880
At the same time, for you to achieve heights is also difficult.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.040
Because you get lost

04:59.280 --> 05:05.880
when I love you so much

05:06.200 --> 05:12.840
and in that love you forget sometimes,

05:13.760 --> 05:18.720
that the progress in your being is very slow.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.880
It is important

05:26.040 --> 05:32.960
that in Sahaja Yoga you have to be strict with yourself.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.480
That’s why I said that you have to be your own guru,

05:37.680 --> 05:41.200
which people do not understand what it means.

05:41.720 --> 05:46.720
You have to be your own guru means you have to guide yourself;

05:47.000 --> 05:54.280
you have to treat yourself as your disciple

05:54.480 --> 05:58.600
and you have to trim yourself.

05:59.920 --> 06:05.840
If you do not understand

06:07.400 --> 06:11.720
the responsibility as Sahaja Yogi,

06:11.920 --> 06:16.600
of working it out yourself everything,

06:16.800 --> 06:20.600
you cannot move very fast,

06:20.880 --> 06:23.080
because

06:25.120 --> 06:28.000
it is a different type

06:28.200 --> 06:33.440
of relationship between the Guru and the disciples.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.320
So first I have always said you become your own guru.

06:41.720 --> 06:45.320
So you have to make

06:46.800 --> 06:50.760
a lot of introspection

06:50.960 --> 06:54.400
and fix your ideals.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.520
Before you I am sitting.

06:59.960 --> 07:04.640
You have seen Me how I am.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.680
I can eat anything;

07:07.880 --> 07:11.920
I need not eat at all for days together.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.640
I can sleep anywhere;

07:16.160 --> 07:19.320
I may not sleep at all.

07:19.640 --> 07:25.680
I travel for miles together untiringly.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.800
I have this energy because

07:36.200 --> 07:41.480
I’m a Guru of Myself also.

07:44.040 --> 07:48.200
So the first thing is that there should be lot of introspection,

07:49.400 --> 07:52.520
“What’s wrong with me?” Not wrong with others.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.760
“What’s wrong with me?

07:55.960 --> 08:00.280
Am I seeking the comfort of my body?

08:00.520 --> 08:07.480
The attention, is it on my body or on my spirit?

08:07.960 --> 08:10.960
If so, what am I doing?”

08:11.280 --> 08:14.320
I think best thing is to write it down.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.160
“Can I sleep on the grass?

08:20.840 --> 08:24.760
Can I sit on the stone?”

08:26.240 --> 08:30.040
You have to make this body work.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.240
“Can I sleep anytime I like,

08:33.440 --> 08:36.400
and can I keep awake anytime I like?”

08:39.160 --> 08:42.480
I have seen people doze off.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.200
The reason is this, not that they are bad

08:46.520 --> 08:49.200
or in any way indisciplined people

08:49.800 --> 08:53.520
but because inside they are tired.

08:54.760 --> 09:02.240
If you are tired inside then you feel tired all the time.

09:02.440 --> 09:06.160
You’ll see on the television, if you see people in the West,

09:06.400 --> 09:10.240
they’re always sitting like this.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.200
Because they are so very tired.

09:14.400 --> 09:18.000
Why are they so tired? They don’t work so hard.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.680
So introspect how you behave.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.640
Now when you start introspecting yourself,

09:29.840 --> 09:33.240
you’ll also start introspecting your surroundings

09:33.440 --> 09:37.040
and your styles
and your methods,

09:37.240 --> 09:41.800
and what you are doing to yourself

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
because of the conditionings of the outside.

09:47.120 --> 09:51.320
Now the conditionings of the outside in the West,

09:51.520 --> 09:54.200
are of a psychological nature.

09:54.440 --> 09:59.400
Indians have other conditionings which are also quite surprising,

09:59.640 --> 10:01.520
or we should say the Western  people,

10:01.720 --> 10:03.960
they must wash their hand ten times,

10:04.160 --> 10:07.640
even if their skin comes out, they’ll go on washing like mad.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.240
They must have a bathroom attached to them all the time.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.360
They must have their baths.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.680
If they don’t have bath they are not comfortable.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.680
They have other conditionings also.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.331
All kinds of stupid conditionings they have

10:23.560 --> 10:27.080
but the conditionings that we have in the West

10:27.280 --> 10:30.040
are more psychological and that’s why

10:30.280 --> 10:34.680
you cannot find out what’s wrong with you.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.000
The physical conditionings are not so dangerous,

10:39.200 --> 10:41.600
you can get over them or you can manage.

10:41.880 --> 10:45.080
But when you have conditioning of your psychology

10:45.320 --> 10:49.280
you cannot understand what’s wrong with you.

10:50.680 --> 10:55.080
Now if you see, if you introspect around,

10:55.800 --> 10:59.760
what you will find is a very subtle thing.

11:00.480 --> 11:05.560
Firstly, that

11:06.280 --> 11:10.640
because of the wars maybe, I don’t know why

11:10.880 --> 11:14.880
but everybody is afraid of everyone.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.480
Specially I think, Freud.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.680
Because of Freud, even the mother is afraid of the child,

11:26.320 --> 11:28.760
and all these things to Indians are absolutely

11:28.960 --> 11:31.320
they can’t understand this.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.960
But, you people know that very well.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.800
They won’t touch anybody;

11:38.000 --> 11:40.680
they won’t hug anyone.

11:40.880 --> 11:44.480
First of all when they used to play football, they used to hug.

11:44.680 --> 11:49.080
But now I see they don’t hug they just touch hands like this.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.680
After sometime I think they may

11:53.920 --> 11:57.080
just do like that or something.

11:57.440 --> 12:02.440
So frightened that nobody, even the children I’ve seen,

12:02.640 --> 12:06.680
are frightened of hugging their parents.

12:06.920 --> 12:11.640
So the expression of love is not there

12:12.120 --> 12:16.720
and when there is no expression there is no love inside

12:17.440 --> 12:22.200
and that’s how it goes on drying you up and drying you up and drying up.

12:24.320 --> 12:29.040
There was a little girl in Sahaja Yoga

12:29.480 --> 12:33.640
and I had some present for that child.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.240
She was quite young, must have been about ten years of age.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.080
So I gave it to one Sahaja yogi, Western Sahaja yogi,

12:40.280 --> 12:43.160
that you go and give it to her and say that I have given.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.640
“No Mother. I won’t give.” I said, “Why?”

12:45.840 --> 12:49.480
“She’ll misunderstand me.” I said, “What will she misunderstand?”

12:49.680 --> 12:53.520
It has gone so much into the heads of people.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.400
And this has created really

12:56.640 --> 13:00.640
the psychological insecurity within you.

13:01.600 --> 13:06.560
From very childhood this insecurity has been working,

13:07.040 --> 13:11.760
and that’s why you are frightened of each other.

13:11.960 --> 13:15.640
Even of your parents, of your brothers, your sisters.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.920
Psychologically you are suffering.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.440
And when first I came to England they used to say

13:23.640 --> 13:26.280
it is the insecurity. I said, “What insecurity?

13:26.480 --> 13:29.680
The whole world is afraid of the Western world.”

13:30.080 --> 13:32.640
And what are they suffering from insecurity?

13:32.840 --> 13:36.000
They have made everybody insecure all over the world.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.480
And why, what are they insecure?

13:38.680 --> 13:40.840
They are insecured within themselves

13:41.040 --> 13:44.280
in their own society, in their own family,

13:44.480 --> 13:47.560
in their own groups.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.760
They are so much frightened of each other.

13:53.800 --> 13:58.880
So the first thing, you should be fearless.

14:00.040 --> 14:04.080
You are a Sahaja Yogi, you are no more immoral,

14:04.760 --> 14:06.920
cannot be immoral.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.880
If all the time if you start thinking that you are immoral,

14:12.280 --> 14:15.360
and if you do something it is immoral,

14:15.560 --> 14:20.840
and that you have to go and do some confession somewhere,

14:21.440 --> 14:24.920
then what is going to happen to you?

14:25.600 --> 14:29.640
What sort of a personality you will have?

14:33.600 --> 14:38.640
We have to change this by changing ourselves.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.320
So among Sahaja yogis there should be

14:42.520 --> 14:46.680
no insecurities but maryadas.

14:46.880 --> 14:51.840
You must know how to respect each others privacy.

14:54.840 --> 15:00.680
The second thing that if you find with the Western mind,

15:01.720 --> 15:05.240
which is a very common thing,

15:06.120 --> 15:10.960
that they are bombarded by criticism.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.720
There are so many critics

15:14.920 --> 15:17.360
that now there are no more artists left.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.480
Only critics are criticizing critics.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.560
All artists are finished.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.960
They are all the time criticized.

15:26.640 --> 15:30.440
Somebody will come in – there’s an education on criticism –

15:30.640 --> 15:34.400
they may not know how to play any instrument,

15:34.640 --> 15:37.120
they may not know how to sing,

15:37.320 --> 15:40.960
but they can criticize all right.

15:41.400 --> 15:46.480
So all the time in your mind, is a way

15:46.720 --> 15:51.480
that you always feel that somebody will criticize if you do this.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.160
All the time the fear is there that somebody will criticize.

15:57.400 --> 16:01.520
So, “Should I say or not?”

16:02.680 --> 16:06.120
As Sahaja yogis, you shouldn’t worry about

16:06.320 --> 16:08.560
these stupid people because they are blind.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.560
And if they want to criticize you, let them criticize.

16:11.760 --> 16:15.600
What does it matter? Makes no difference.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.960
But this you have to build up within yourself.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.840
Now the third is even worse,

16:28.040 --> 16:31.160
which I don’t know if you have noticed or not.

16:31.400 --> 16:37.080
I don’t know how it has gone into the heads of the Western minds

16:39.200 --> 16:42.760
that you must always see

16:42.960 --> 16:45.760
to the other side of the bank,

16:45.960 --> 16:48.720
even if you are standing on this side,

16:49.280 --> 16:51.280
to be fair

16:51.760 --> 16:56.680
and never to say something that you are sure of.

16:57.280 --> 17:01.840
Like you ask anyone, “How are you?” He’ll say …

17:02.640 --> 17:04.840
Always.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.040
Nobody say, will say, “I am perfectly all right,

17:10.640 --> 17:13.640
nothing wrong with me.”

17:14.280 --> 17:15.960
“What’s wrong?”

17:16.200 --> 17:19.440
“Perfectly all right, thank you very much.”

17:21.680 --> 17:24.080
But it is never.

17:24.280 --> 17:29.520
They are not sure of themselves, all the time, is shaking.

17:32.800 --> 17:37.120
And this shaking inside

17:37.320 --> 17:43.680
gives you a personality which can never progress.

17:45.440 --> 17:50.120
Progress comes when you put your step forward,

17:50.640 --> 17:55.560
you put your foot firmly on that point

17:56.200 --> 17:59.320
and then put the second step forward,

17:59.520 --> 18:03.080
like as you climb on a mountain.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
But in the first place only if you are still thinking

18:08.360 --> 18:12.040
that it’s half way through,

18:12.240 --> 18:16.200
then how can you go further?

18:16.920 --> 18:21.800
You’ll only move on two steps, this or that or this or that.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.840
This is another very big psychological

18:27.040 --> 18:29.640
deterrent I should call it,

18:29.840 --> 18:33.800
or detrimental thing for your progress.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.600
Now the third thing you have learned

18:38.800 --> 18:41.600
which is also, third or fourth maybe,

18:41.800 --> 18:46.120
that you must argue out yourself.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.400
Like you have a problem,

18:52.040 --> 18:55.120
you’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, this problem I have got.”

18:55.320 --> 18:57.760
This is very common with everyone,

18:57.960 --> 19:00.160
“I have this problem.”

19:02.600 --> 19:06.040
I’ll say, “All right, this is the solution.”

19:06.800 --> 19:10.680
Then you’ll come out, “No, no, no. But in this, this will happen.”

19:10.960 --> 19:14.040
Then You tell another solution,

19:14.400 --> 19:19.640
“No, no, no, no, no Mother, this can't be this way.”

19:19.920 --> 19:22.360
All right, You tell third solution,

19:22.560 --> 19:25.760
“No Mother, in this, this can happen.”

19:25.960 --> 19:28.840
Tell fourth, “This can happen.”

19:29.800 --> 19:33.720
You are standing against yourself all the time.

19:33.920 --> 19:38.640
Then I have to say, “This is your problem, not Mine,

19:38.840 --> 19:43.520
and I am giving you the solutions

19:43.720 --> 19:48.480
and if you want to solve your problem,

19:48.680 --> 19:52.120
better take a positive attitude.”

19:53.640 --> 19:57.800
The brain is this way.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.160
In our Hindi language it’s called “ulti khopdi.”

20:03.960 --> 20:08.800
You are all the time arguing against yourself.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.240
So how can you progress?

20:14.440 --> 20:20.920
This is another great problem of the Western mind

20:21.120 --> 20:25.080
that it doesn’t

20:25.280 --> 20:30.720
try to face any problem as your own,

20:31.920 --> 20:35.840
but go on arguing with yourself like a lawyer.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.880
You see. there are two lawyers:

20:38.080 --> 20:40.720
one yourself, another lawyer – go on arguing.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.840
So is a double personality in the body, being;

20:45.040 --> 20:47.960
is not a single personality.

20:49.800 --> 20:53.960
As I said, it is very, very psychological

20:54.240 --> 20:58.560
that people have to

21:00.120 --> 21:05.480
take to this kind of a turn suddenly,

21:06.960 --> 21:11.360
without understanding how dangerous it is.

21:15.880 --> 21:22.760
With the enlightenment of your brain, this should disappear.

21:23.360 --> 21:28.320
On the contrary in Sahaja Yoga, it’s very dangerous.

21:28.600 --> 21:32.360
Because you say something, you are all Sahaja yogis,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.920
you are connected with the all-pervading power.

21:37.120 --> 21:40.760
Whatever you say gets connected

21:42.320 --> 21:44.480
and it acts.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.920
Is very dangerous

21:50.120 --> 21:55.080
for you people not to realize that you are realized souls,

21:56.080 --> 22:01.280
and not to assume your own powers.

22:02.440 --> 22:08.320
Like you see, I have to say something secretly

22:08.640 --> 22:11.720
then I must put My hand here and then say it

22:12.240 --> 22:15.160
because it is connected to the mains.

22:15.640 --> 22:21.640
But supposing I keep it open like this and say something,

22:21.880 --> 22:25.880
it goes to everyone.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.640
In the same way

22:28.840 --> 22:32.920
whatever the Sahaja yogis say or desire or want,

22:33.120 --> 22:35.960
there are just people sitting there, see here and here,

22:36.160 --> 22:38.200
you have put them there.

22:38.400 --> 22:42.040
They are listening to you all the time.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.680
They are so anxious to do your work,

22:44.880 --> 22:47.920
“All right, you say so, done.”

22:48.920 --> 22:52.720
So whatever you think or whatever you desire

22:52.920 --> 22:57.280
or whatever you say, you have to be extremely careful.

23:01.960 --> 23:05.680
And when, now, I mean, old people, all right,

23:05.880 --> 23:09.520
I can say that very conditioned, they have problems and all,

23:09.720 --> 23:12.480
but the generation that is here, most of them,

23:12.680 --> 23:16.560
are all capable of improving yourself

23:16.760 --> 23:21.360
and making your brain straight

23:21.560 --> 23:25.680
by bringing it backwards to the forward.

23:30.240 --> 23:35.000
This psychological problem you do not say.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.280
The another psychological problem is,

23:39.480 --> 23:42.680
which you do not know, which is very surprising,

23:43.960 --> 23:46.920
that whatever is the

23:48.280 --> 23:51.520
entrepreneur’s ideas

23:51.720 --> 23:54.840
you must act,

23:55.080 --> 23:58.320
because the whole fundamentals of Western life

23:58.520 --> 24:02.040
is to see and to be seen.

24:04.320 --> 24:09.120
So, “Oh that’s the fashion so we should do like that.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.800
This is the fashion so we do like that.”

24:13.240 --> 24:17.600
Like the other day, about a year back,

24:17.800 --> 24:22.920
I went to England and I found all the Sahaja Yoginis having their hair here

24:23.200 --> 24:25.680
I said, “What’s this?”

24:26.360 --> 24:29.360
So I asked an Indian girl, I said, “What is this supposed to be?”

24:29.560 --> 24:32.360
“This is a new fashion.” I said, “What new fashion?”

24:32.560 --> 24:35.720
Called as “ziprya” in Marathi you know, we call it ziprya fashion.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.280
The Maharashtrians can ….

24:39.760 --> 24:43.760
And they all had their hair here you know, like this, all.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.480
I said, “My God, this is Agnya, this they are covering,

24:47.680 --> 24:50.800
their eyes will become squinty.”

24:51.520 --> 24:54.120
But the fashion if it comes,

24:54.320 --> 24:57.480
and the whole fashion is with the hair alone.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.920
Hair I don’t know what.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.720
There’s so much interest in the hair.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.360
And they lose the hair so fast in these countries,

25:06.560 --> 25:10.400
without using the oil, which they should use.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.720
They lose their hair very fast.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.720
Starting from the hair, the Sahasrara.

25:16.920 --> 25:20.400
Then fashion means –

25:20.600 --> 25:22.680
What is this these entrepreneurs,

25:22.880 --> 25:25.000
these stupid people are creating ideas

25:25.200 --> 25:28.120
and there why should we follow?

25:28.400 --> 25:32.440
I don’t say that Sahaja yogis should all look alike, not at all.

25:32.640 --> 25:36.720
You can dress up the way you like; you can live the way you like

25:36.920 --> 25:41.000
but you should not get yourself enslaved by any entrepreneurs.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.400
You are free people now – know that very well.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.200
Know that you are absolutely free

25:47.400 --> 25:53.440
and your freedom is absolutely in the light of your enlightenment.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.760
You can never do wrong.

25:57.320 --> 26:02.160
But first of all, have that confidence within yourself

26:04.440 --> 26:07.000
that whatever you have to do,

26:07.200 --> 26:12.480
you are not going to enslave yourself to entrepreneurs,

26:12.680 --> 26:15.560
what people have to say, how you will look,

26:15.800 --> 26:19.200
how you will appear before.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.600
This is a very important point

26:22.800 --> 26:28.320
that half of the time we are laboring just to look like many others.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.200
It’s very surprising

26:31.400 --> 26:34.160
how these entrepreneurs have befooled the Western people.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.240
In India it won’t work, won’t work –

26:37.440 --> 26:39.760
specially the Indian women.

26:39.960 --> 26:43.360
This “in-between” came, a mini sari,

26:43.560 --> 26:48.240
came up to Bombay for about four-five days, I think, disappeared.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.800
No Indian woman would wear a mini-sari, finished.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.280
Nothing doing.

26:58.280 --> 27:02.760
Any sort of fashion now, comes in India, doesn’t stay

27:03.000 --> 27:05.800
because whatever clothes we have now in India -

27:06.000 --> 27:08.560
is traditionally - has been there,

27:08.760 --> 27:13.080
has been tested and error and trial and error and trial,

27:13.280 --> 27:15.440
and we know now this is the best, now stop it.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.800
At certain age you stop.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.760
This is the style that suits us the best.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.920
But anything goes on and the styles go on changing.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.480
And this is what you have to be very careful to see

27:29.680 --> 27:32.520
that you do not take to stupid things,

27:32.720 --> 27:36.000
which are being created by entrepreneurs,

27:36.200 --> 27:41.120
but to sensible things, which are required for you.

27:42.640 --> 27:46.240
So one of the enslavement I feel, is

27:46.440 --> 27:51.520
that you have to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

27:52.280 --> 27:58.160
But a slavery is very deep and is so psychological;

27:58.960 --> 28:05.040
in so many ways it is extremely hidden

28:07.160 --> 28:11.760
and so subtle that you cannot make it out.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.360
So, in the introspection you find out

28:15.560 --> 28:18.840
what’s gone wrong with you,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.960
how you are made this way.

28:25.160 --> 28:30.200
“What’s wrong in my own personality –

28:30.400 --> 28:34.840
it has come from all the surroundings

28:35.040 --> 28:39.280
and the way people have been putting ideas into my head.”

28:40.920 --> 28:44.200
You should have your own ideas.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.040
You shouldn’t worry what Plato said

28:47.240 --> 28:49.440
and what Socrates said and what this thing said.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.680
What do you think?

28:54.440 --> 28:57.720
After all, you are enlightened people.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.440
But then there is another psychological thing,

29:01.640 --> 29:03.640
which is even the worst.

29:04.120 --> 29:07.480
And that “Mother, if we are very sure,

29:07.680 --> 29:10.800
then we are putting up our ego.”

29:11.080 --> 29:14.120
They are so much afraid of their ego

29:14.320 --> 29:18.000
that as if after some time they’ll take off.

29:18.480 --> 29:22.840
“The ego will bloat so much that we’ll take off.”

29:23.720 --> 29:27.560
This is another fear people have, that if we assert,

29:27.760 --> 29:31.440
“All right this is what I want, this is the right thing to do,

29:31.640 --> 29:36.400
then I’ll get off so I don’t want to say such a thing;

29:36.600 --> 29:39.200
I have an ego.”

29:39.400 --> 29:43.560
So, with Sahaja Yoga also, certain fears have crawled in.

29:44.120 --> 29:49.560
One of them is that “Mother, I should not have any ego.”

29:53.440 --> 29:57.240
Now, what is the problem of ego?

29:57.960 --> 30:02.160
That also surprising despite all fear and everything.

30:02.880 --> 30:06.120
As a reaction to it people have developed

30:06.320 --> 30:12.440
a kind of a protesting character.

30:16.200 --> 30:20.600
But again these entrepreneurs have pampered your ego.

30:20.800 --> 30:24.680
Like, in the morning you ask the child, “What will you have?”

30:25.600 --> 30:27.480
Then child will say, “I’ll have this.”

30:27.680 --> 30:29.760
The mother has to run and get it,

30:29.960 --> 30:32.640
or she must keep everything in the fridge.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.720
In India that’s not the case.

30:35.920 --> 30:39.960
Whatever is cooked in the house, you better have.

30:41.040 --> 30:45.000
If there is no salt, all right without salt, come along.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.960
Otherwise don’t eat, doesn’t matter.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.200
In any case you will eat.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.800
So when the disciplining comes within yourself

30:56.000 --> 30:58.360
and you understand this,

30:58.560 --> 31:01.920
then you do not say, “I desire only this, I desire only this.”

31:02.120 --> 31:05.280
What you desire, you tell yourself:

31:05.520 --> 31:10.360
“All right, you’ll not have it for one month, let’s see.”

31:13.440 --> 31:17.200
Once I must tell you about Myself that

31:18.600 --> 31:22.200
little bit comfort grew upon Me, sometimes, I think.

31:22.440 --> 31:26.480
So, we had, had a transfer,

31:26.720 --> 31:31.120
and My family was not with Me at that time.

31:31.560 --> 31:35.760
We had only one small little bed where My husband slept.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.840
And I slept just on the bare cement on the earth,

31:40.240 --> 31:43.240
and next day I started getting the pain in the body.

31:43.440 --> 31:48.600
I said, “All right.” I slept on the cement for one month.

31:49.960 --> 31:53.680
“On the cement you get pain? All right. Sleep now.

31:53.880 --> 31:57.480
One month,” I said, “I’m going to sleep on the cement.”

31:58.560 --> 32:02.600
Then cement lost its power on Me.

32:03.400 --> 32:08.000
Then, might be the cement might be feeling the pain.

32:08.800 --> 32:15.760
So, that’s what you have to do, is to master your mind.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.920
Now the problem only will come:

32:19.120 --> 32:22.760
"What is the discretion? - This ego will come up Mother.”

32:22.960 --> 32:27.240
Because, your ego, as I said, is developed by reactions,

32:27.440 --> 32:30.840
by protesting against things,

32:31.040 --> 32:36.480
and also by the pampering of the entrepreneurs.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.920
All right, whatever may be the reason,

32:40.120 --> 32:42.680
we are not going to psychoanalyze ourselves.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.760
But the fact is, also we have a ego problem.

32:45.960 --> 32:46.800
Why?

32:47.000 --> 32:51.320
I have already told you that, if a balloon is bloated many a times,

32:51.560 --> 32:53.840
it can easily be bloated.

32:54.040 --> 32:58.720
At the slightest air, it bloats.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.120
And that’s why you are afraid that suddenly

33:01.320 --> 33:04.160
my ego might become so big

33:04.360 --> 33:08.280
that I may be like a balloon in the air, somewhere moving.”

33:12.200 --> 33:17.360
But, how to get rid of this is to know that

33:19.240 --> 33:22.040
you are an enlightened soul.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.760
Respect yourself.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.960
Once you start respecting yourself,

33:32.160 --> 33:38.120
you will not fall into any traps of ego.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.640
Very simple.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.280
Respect yourself.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.200
You have to say,

33:48.400 --> 33:51.560
“I am a Sahaja yogi.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.200
how can I behave like this?

33:57.600 --> 34:00.800
After all, I am a Sahaja yogi.”

34:01.320 --> 34:06.360
A kind of a dignity that develops,

34:08.600 --> 34:12.480
and then you will start feeling shy

34:12.680 --> 34:14.680
of doing something that is stupid,

34:14.880 --> 34:19.560
because ego makes you stupid, that’s the point is, absolutely.

34:19.760 --> 34:25.400
So now, if you develop this respect for yourself,

34:25.600 --> 34:27.680
“I’m a Sahaja yogi,

34:29.800 --> 34:31.960
so I can’t behave like this.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.680
I’m a Sahaja yogi.”

34:35.160 --> 34:38.920
If you say like that to yourself,

34:40.840 --> 34:44.040
then you will be amazed

34:44.240 --> 34:47.680
that the dignity of a Sahaja yogi

34:47.880 --> 34:52.760
will definitely keep you down to earth.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.520
You will not get into the trap of your ego.

35:00.720 --> 35:06.000
So one side is the conditioning, another side is this ego.

35:06.200 --> 35:09.440
Simple thing is ego.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.080
That dignity has to be developed.

35:18.960 --> 35:23.880
You’ll be surprised – among animals there are maryadas.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.400
Like a tiger won’t behave like a snake

35:27.640 --> 35:30.280
and snake won’t behave like a tiger.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.920
So we are now Sahaja yogis.

35:34.120 --> 35:37.960
We are tigers among human beings, we are lions among humans,

35:38.160 --> 35:42.320
the highest; we are the highest human beings.

35:43.400 --> 35:48.400
It’s not necessary to have ten, what you call,

35:49.360 --> 35:53.560
medals on your body to show that you are something great

35:53.760 --> 35:58.640
but you are Sahaja yogis, you are Mahayogis.

35:59.400 --> 36:02.320
So, develop that

36:04.680 --> 36:06.680
respect

36:06.880 --> 36:09.760
and you will be surprised the humility

36:10.000 --> 36:12.200
will immediately came into you,

36:12.400 --> 36:15.320
I mean will walk into you, humility.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.480
I have seen some Sahaja yogis sit like this,

36:18.720 --> 36:21.160
sometimes sit like this,

36:21.360 --> 36:24.600
sometimes they,

36:24.800 --> 36:29.000
one, if the Left Vishuddhi is there, like this,

36:29.520 --> 36:32.320
Right Vishuddhi is there, like this.

36:35.720 --> 36:40.000
But then you see yourself.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.040
Like a bridegroom has to dress up

36:44.240 --> 36:46.560
and he remembers, “I am the bridegroom,

36:46.760 --> 36:50.680
I cannot behave like other younger boys who will be there.

36:50.880 --> 36:55.880
I have to have my own personality.

36:56.240 --> 36:58.320
I am the bridegroom;

36:58.520 --> 37:00.600
I am going for my wedding.

37:00.800 --> 37:04.480
I cannot behave like all my other friends are there.”

37:04.680 --> 37:07.440
You have to behave in a particular manner.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.520
So assume this.

37:09.720 --> 37:14.760
Still we do not know that we are Sahaja yogis.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.520
Once we know we are Sahaja yogis,

37:19.720 --> 37:22.360
that dignity will develop within us,

37:22.560 --> 37:25.480
and with that dignity you’ll be amazed

37:25.680 --> 37:29.480
you’ll also see what is wrong in your own country,

37:29.680 --> 37:32.440
what is indignified.

37:35.760 --> 37:40.520
Now with the whatever has happened in France,

37:40.920 --> 37:45.760
you can find out what’s wrong with French laws.

37:46.200 --> 37:51.280
But French are more interested in drinking and eating

37:51.480 --> 37:54.480
and other things. So they never paid -

37:54.680 --> 37:57.200
“Oh, let it be, what do we care for laws, let it be as it is,

37:57.400 --> 37:59.680
doesn’t matter, who should bother about these things,

37:59.880 --> 38:01.560
is nothing important.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.840
After all, if you can get something to drink .…”

38:05.080 --> 38:08.080
You go to any French village, at seven time,

38:08.280 --> 38:11.640
you cannot meet anyone, even a drunkard.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.760
They are sitting inside and drinking, drinking.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.720
I mean that’s the main religion, main pastime.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.960
Next day with a hangover they come,

38:21.160 --> 38:24.000
so they see everything the other way round.

38:24.200 --> 38:29.800
Like this fellow, these journalist who went to India,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.200
they saw an iron gate

38:32.400 --> 38:35.880
and they thought this was the iron curtain of Hitler.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.520
Everything expanded, you know, so big,

38:38.720 --> 38:42.520
crooked because hangover, you know.

38:42.880 --> 38:48.480
So the whole life in the West like a hangover.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.200
Either they see things too big or too small,

38:52.400 --> 38:55.920
they don’t see things as they are.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.960
Now most of these things are written, which you will read,

39:01.160 --> 39:04.200
the psychology and all those things and the books,

39:04.400 --> 39:07.520
mostly they are drunkards.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.560
If you see their lives, they have been drunkards.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.520
So whatever they have written,

39:13.720 --> 39:16.800
why should we take them so seriously?

39:17.640 --> 39:20.240
Except for very few who were realized souls,

39:20.440 --> 39:22.640
most of them were drunkards.

39:22.840 --> 39:26.480
Like those who wrote about Greek tragedies

39:26.680 --> 39:29.480
must have been really drunkard people

39:29.680 --> 39:32.320
In – they must be taking lot of things

39:32.520 --> 39:35.720
inside and then must be writing something like that.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.960
Because most of the drunkards,

39:39.160 --> 39:44.960
when they write, they say that “Why, why should I live, I must die.”

39:45.720 --> 39:47.920
And like that we too have in India

39:48.160 --> 39:50.680
many people who have written ghazals who always say that

39:50.880 --> 39:52.760
“Why should we live, we should die.”

39:52.960 --> 39:56.120
So if there’s one poet who has said,

39:56.320 --> 40:01.280
“Now you are talking of dying, why don’t you die once for all?”

40:03.640 --> 40:07.880
So, you will realize that

40:08.360 --> 40:10.560
what you will write,

40:10.760 --> 40:15.480
what you will say is higher than all these people.

40:17.120 --> 40:20.560
But Sahaja Yoga has worked so smoothly in you

40:20.760 --> 40:24.840
that you do not know what you are.

40:27.560 --> 40:32.200
Today, on Guru Puja, you are worshiping your Guru.

40:32.640 --> 40:38.640
At the same time I bow to your guru within yourself.

40:43.160 --> 40:47.680
Let your guru come up and show itself.

40:48.720 --> 40:53.640
Specially the kind of a Guru you have –

40:53.840 --> 40:59.160
I am not strict with you, I am very gentle.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.880
Because, as I told you, fundamentally is a different thing

41:03.120 --> 41:08.080
is that it is not for an individual, but it is for the collective.

41:08.880 --> 41:13.400
And if something has to spread collectively,

41:13.600 --> 41:16.560
then you have to understand

41:16.840 --> 41:21.520
that it has to be only love that is going to work it.

41:21.720 --> 41:25.400
There is no other way we can spread Sahaja Yoga

41:25.600 --> 41:30.240
because we cannot be like Hitler giving wrong ideas of hatred.

41:30.440 --> 41:34.960
Either it could be hatred or love.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.680
You teach people we hate this one – fundamentalism,

41:38.880 --> 41:42.960
this, that – you’ll get thousands ready to fight.

41:43.640 --> 41:48.160
You can elevate their baser self and say,

41:48.360 --> 41:50.720
“All right, come along, let us fight.”

41:50.960 --> 41:55.920
Racialism, this, that, anything, even nationalism.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.160
All right, they are people.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.600
But when I say love, is very different.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.160
Try to understand.

42:02.360 --> 42:05.880
And because of our collective work, we have to know

42:06.120 --> 42:12.400
that love is a source of energy

42:12.600 --> 42:15.960
that makes things grow

42:16.400 --> 42:18.600
in a living manner.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.880
It is the energy which is a living energy.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.920
Try to understand now. This is, people don’t understand.

42:25.120 --> 42:28.720
Love doesn’t mean that you hug somebody or do something,

42:28.960 --> 42:32.920
but living energy that understands,

42:33.920 --> 42:36.000
that makes you grow.

42:36.760 --> 42:41.120
I hope you have seen My books, and I hope you have read it.

42:42.280 --> 42:46.160
In that I have described you to you very clearly

42:46.360 --> 42:51.440
what is the living energy within us that works,

42:51.640 --> 42:55.400
and anything that is working. For example see this flower.

42:55.600 --> 42:59.560
Now, I cannot order this one to go straight.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.680
It’s moving in its own way – let it be.

43:02.920 --> 43:06.960
It looks nice because no flower should look like another flower.

43:07.240 --> 43:10.480
Living energy never creates the same thing exactly than another.

43:10.680 --> 43:13.200
Only plastics can be done.

43:13.400 --> 43:19.040
Now, when it is growing, it is growing in its own way.

43:19.240 --> 43:23.160
So whatever is built in within you, which is a living energy,

43:23.360 --> 43:28.480
built in, but living energy, and a living thing that works –

43:28.680 --> 43:31.560
it blossoms by itself.

43:31.760 --> 43:36.720
The water of pure love is to be given.

43:39.080 --> 43:46.120
In pure love what you see in another person, as a guru,

43:46.800 --> 43:53.320
“What’s the matter with myself

43:53.560 --> 43:58.680
where it is obstructing me to go further.”

43:59.480 --> 44:03.040
In another person, as a guru, what you see

44:04.280 --> 44:09.600
is how to handle this man, with love,

44:09.800 --> 44:13.840
so that he comes closer to reality.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.640
Is a very gentle process

44:18.840 --> 44:21.760
is very loving process,

44:21.960 --> 44:26.840
and nothing like really enjoying your love.

44:27.120 --> 44:32.160
Just to know that I love so many people itself is so great.

44:33.560 --> 44:37.520
And you too see feel that “I love so many.”

44:38.160 --> 44:41.800
But it should be samadrishti – means:

44:42.000 --> 44:45.040
With the same eyes you should see everyone.

44:45.240 --> 44:48.360
You see everybody with the same eyes, isn’t it?

44:48.560 --> 44:51.680
Only two eyes are there.

44:54.600 --> 45:00.680
But, you see everyone with the same eyes – they are different.

45:01.360 --> 45:04.760
All right, you see them as different.

45:05.680 --> 45:09.040
But you do not … your eyes do not discriminate.

45:09.240 --> 45:13.480
Your eyes do not see somebody black, somebody white,

45:14.320 --> 45:15.840
somebody blue.

45:16.040 --> 45:18.600
They see what they are.

45:20.760 --> 45:25.320
When you start seeing with samadrishti, means the same eyes,

45:25.920 --> 45:28.240
same sight,

45:28.600 --> 45:32.480
not to change your ideas.

45:32.720 --> 45:39.560
Because, what happens that your own mind twists it,

45:39.880 --> 45:44.680
and you start seeing somebody as different, somebody as different.

45:45.440 --> 45:48.320
Now, with the eyes I see the fan.

45:48.520 --> 45:53.520
But supposing My mind is off, I might see as a human being.

45:55.680 --> 45:57.880
So if you are a sane person,

45:58.120 --> 46:01.840
then you will see everyone as they are.

46:02.040 --> 46:04.640
This is samadrishti is that

46:04.840 --> 46:08.480
you have the same eyes for everyone.

46:08.760 --> 46:13.360
Do not get twisted, so that you cannot have:

46:13.560 --> 46:15.960
somebody is your special friend,

46:16.160 --> 46:19.520
somebody is number two friend, somebody as number ten friend

46:19.720 --> 46:22.560
and some as your enemy.

46:22.760 --> 46:27.560
Once you start looking at things like that,

46:28.880 --> 46:34.000
everything will get into proper shapes.

46:36.360 --> 46:39.240
Otherwise, one can go crazy.

46:40.680 --> 46:44.520
Also, it should be samyak.

46:44.720 --> 46:48.320
Samyak means “integrated”.

46:50.360 --> 46:53.000
There should be an integrated knowledge.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.040
Like the eyes when they see,

46:55.240 --> 46:58.160
they see where you are sitting, where you are,

46:58.400 --> 47:01.040
where is this person, where is that person,

47:01.240 --> 47:03.680
what is the relationship.

47:04.480 --> 47:07.800
So the knowledge about others

47:08.000 --> 47:10.840
is in relationships with each other.

47:12.400 --> 47:16.640
Now supposing there’s a gentleman who has a child,

47:16.840 --> 47:21.120
and there’s a problem between that gentleman and the child.

47:21.680 --> 47:23.560
To approach that person,

47:23.760 --> 47:25.960
you must know that he has a child;

47:26.680 --> 47:33.080
not to just make him separated from others, singularizing.

47:33.280 --> 47:38.640
You take somebody, say, he is from, say from England

47:38.880 --> 47:41.160
or he is from Italy.

47:41.360 --> 47:44.880
Then try to understand him

47:45.080 --> 47:48.480
that he is from that particular background

47:48.680 --> 47:53.600
and that background is around him, so he is like that.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.680
If you can have this kind of a full knowledge of others,

47:57.880 --> 48:02.600
there will be no problems, no quarreling, nothing.

48:04.840 --> 48:08.240
Otherwise there is a conflict all the time

48:08.480 --> 48:11.560
and that’s how one feels very tired.

48:14.280 --> 48:18.640
Eyes do not react; eyes just see;

48:19.440 --> 48:21.920
whatever is there, they just see.

48:22.120 --> 48:24.440
Eyes never react,

48:24.640 --> 48:27.000
but the mind reacts.

48:27.200 --> 48:31.120
And this reaction is the one which is responsible

48:31.600 --> 48:35.560
for spoiling your attitude towards people.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.200
So now,

48:40.960 --> 48:43.480
you should have a witness state.

48:43.680 --> 48:47.000
As Gyaneshwara said, “Niranjan pahane. –

48:47.200 --> 48:49.440
Niranjan pahane”

48:49.640 --> 48:53.720
To see somebody without any reaction.

48:54.640 --> 48:59.520
Just to see and you’ll know everything about that person,

48:59.720 --> 49:02.840
as soon as you see that person.

49:03.160 --> 49:04.480
"Niranjan pahane”

49:04.680 --> 49:06.480
Because, as long as your brain is there

49:06.680 --> 49:08.920
you do not see that person as he is.

49:09.200 --> 49:12.280
But as soon as you see that person,

49:12.480 --> 49:15.800
you just know what it is.

49:16.800 --> 49:20.560
And then, immediately you will know

49:20.760 --> 49:24.080
his chakras, his kundalini, everything you’ll penetrate.

49:24.320 --> 49:28.040
But your mind, which is loaded with nonsense,

49:28.240 --> 49:31.000
will not allow you to go to that level.

49:32.240 --> 49:37.040
So the niranjan pahane, the one where you just see something,

49:37.880 --> 49:42.280
that kind of a eye we have to develop it.

49:43.720 --> 49:49.360
So, with that a detachment starts,

49:49.560 --> 49:53.800
automatically you do not criticize anybody

49:54.040 --> 49:57.120
because your mind is like this against that person;

49:57.600 --> 50:00.600
you do not love somebody because your mind thinks this way;

50:00.800 --> 50:02.320
you too cannot form groups;

50:02.520 --> 50:07.560
you cannot have some people who are dear to you, some are not.

50:11.680 --> 50:16.800
Sometimes, if I do not smile at some people

50:17.000 --> 50:19.400
then they grumble and say,

50:19.600 --> 50:21.880
“This time Mother didn’t smile at me.”

50:22.080 --> 50:25.695
I mean, I cannot keep all the time a smile, you see.

50:26.800 --> 50:31.640
You must also think of My muscles.

50:34.760 --> 50:39.000
All the time how can I keep My smile on, you know?

50:39.200 --> 50:41.920
But there are people who feel very bad that

50:42.120 --> 50:44.440
“You see, this time Mother didn’t smile.”

50:44.640 --> 50:47.680
So I have to go on smiling all the time at every one.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.600
I try.

50:58.600 --> 51:00.320
So the

51:04.520 --> 51:06.920
attitude towards others

51:07.120 --> 51:11.280
has to be with niranjan

51:12.800 --> 51:17.800
attitude, because it’s a collective work.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.160
It’s not strict;

51:22.360 --> 51:26.000
it is not in any way clamping anything

51:26.200 --> 51:29.040
because it’s a living work,

51:29.240 --> 51:32.360
absolutely it’s living, we cannot.

51:32.560 --> 51:38.400
But it is definitely the work, which

51:41.320 --> 51:45.240
creates harmony, love,

51:45.440 --> 51:49.480
affection, feeling of oneness.

51:49.920 --> 51:53.160
Imagine, to think about someone

51:53.360 --> 51:58.120
who is not kind to you or he’s … is a horrible thing.

51:58.320 --> 52:03.280
Better think how nice you could be to that person.

52:06.280 --> 52:09.080
So the attitude should be that

52:09.280 --> 52:13.160
how nice I am going to be with that person, you know.

52:15.480 --> 52:18.160
See, somebody is angry with you,

52:19.200 --> 52:21.960
is easy to fight, “Come along. You are angry, I am angry.”

52:22.160 --> 52:24.440
No. Go and just tickle.

52:25.040 --> 52:27.640
Simple thing like that,

52:27.840 --> 52:29.840
and enjoy.

52:30.080 --> 52:33.320
Because you cannot enjoy hatred;

52:34.160 --> 52:36.680
you cannot enjoy rivalry;

52:36.880 --> 52:41.200
you cannot enjoy separatedness.

52:41.400 --> 52:45.920
Like this hand has to enjoy this hand,

52:47.440 --> 52:51.280
in the same way you have to enjoy each other.

52:51.480 --> 52:55.640
If you cannot enjoy then you have lost the point,

52:56.400 --> 52:58.960
lost the point.

53:03.800 --> 53:08.360
So, in the collective progress we have to know that we cannot

53:10.480 --> 53:13.080
progress if we have no sense of collectivity,

53:13.280 --> 53:16.520
that we are part and parcel of one person.

53:18.960 --> 53:22.960
If I pull My one ear, it’s not that My ear will come out

53:23.160 --> 53:26.600
but it will give pain to the whole body.

53:26.800 --> 53:30.360
That’s why I say pull both is better.

53:34.360 --> 53:38.880
And when you start, you see, seeing this way yourself,

53:39.080 --> 53:44.520
then you’ll be amazed a kind of a sweet humor about yourself develops.

53:45.240 --> 53:51.160
And you really become a very interesting, magnetic personality,

53:54.480 --> 53:59.000
and a very enjoyable person, extremely enjoyable.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.400
Everybody will seek your company.

54:02.920 --> 54:08.760
This is what is the sign of your Guru Principle being enlightened.

54:09.240 --> 54:12.520
Of course, they have said that you should get detachment;

54:12.720 --> 54:16.400
you should not have any attachment to this and that and that and that.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.560
This is all talking.

54:18.760 --> 54:22.400
But actually, only introspection

54:23.200 --> 54:27.240
and assumption

54:27.440 --> 54:30.800
or, we can say,

54:31.040 --> 54:34.440
the knowledge of your own depth,

54:34.640 --> 54:37.720
itself, will give you that feeling.

54:39.920 --> 54:45.000
If you have that knowledge that I am a Sahaja Yogi,

54:46.000 --> 54:51.280
and my depth of divinity is so great.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.880
That itself will be more than sufficient

54:58.080 --> 55:03.920
for you to exist as the topmost guru.

55:05.320 --> 55:07.960
Actually, I am no more a Guru, I was never a Guru –

55:08.160 --> 55:11.160
I am a Mother; I am hopeless Guru.

55:11.440 --> 55:16.000
Because, a Guru who cannot be strict is useless,

55:16.440 --> 55:19.560
and I have to prepare Myself to say things, you know.

55:19.760 --> 55:23.040
If there’s problem between two people,

55:23.320 --> 55:25.600
and then if there’s some gap of time

55:25.800 --> 55:28.320
when I have to say to them, then I start,

55:28.520 --> 55:32.400
“How to become strict?” I tell Myself.

55:32.920 --> 55:35.400
“Hah” spontaneously if something comes,

55:35.600 --> 55:40.200
then I say, “Why are doing like this?” At the most. Spontaneously.

55:40.400 --> 55:45.520
So, you have to develop this special style of guruship

55:45.720 --> 55:49.440
within yourself, which is for the collective working.

55:49.640 --> 55:54.280
Again, remember it is for the collective working.

55:56.280 --> 56:01.280
So today, you worship your Guru Principle within yourself

56:01.520 --> 56:03.120
when you are worshiping Me.

56:03.320 --> 56:07.200
I would not say that you should try to follow Me,

56:07.480 --> 56:10.720
because I am hopeless in many things.

56:11.160 --> 56:15.080
Say, banking I don’t understand, money I don’t understand,

56:15.280 --> 56:19.080
I mean there’s so many things I don’t know, really.

56:19.680 --> 56:22.360
I am hopeless, law I don’t understand.

56:22.680 --> 56:24.960
I mean, you should not be like Me, agreed.

56:25.160 --> 56:26.560
But,

56:28.120 --> 56:30.920
you should be able to say as I say that

56:31.120 --> 56:34.200
“You see, I have these problems.”

56:40.120 --> 56:45.160
But one thing for sure you must have

56:45.920 --> 56:50.560
complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

56:50.760 --> 56:55.400
or desire to know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

56:58.560 --> 57:03.160
If that works out,

57:03.640 --> 57:10.440
then you will swim into this ocean of knowledge,

57:11.600 --> 57:13.720
like a jet.

57:14.280 --> 57:16.040
And whatever you want,

57:16.240 --> 57:18.680
whatever you want to know, you will know.

57:19.160 --> 57:22.640
But there should be a desire to know.

57:22.840 --> 57:25.240
Never get satisfied

57:25.440 --> 57:28.960
that I know sufficiently enough about Sahaja Yoga, no never.

57:29.280 --> 57:32.400
In all other things you can be satisfied.

57:32.600 --> 57:37.120
But only on one thing, that's Sahaja Yoga, still,

57:37.680 --> 57:41.560
I have to know through my brains,

57:43.360 --> 57:47.280
and my heart

57:47.480 --> 57:48.920
should have that knowledge.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.160
It should be in my heart, not only in my brain.

57:52.360 --> 57:57.200
I should know through my brain, it should be in my heart.

58:01.480 --> 58:06.680
Like when you see a film, you see King Kong.

58:07.360 --> 58:09.160
Then you know it’s King Kong,

58:09.360 --> 58:12.640
all right, this is a film, doesn’t matter.

58:12.840 --> 58:15.840
Normally our knowledge is like that.

58:16.080 --> 58:19.120
But if you see Mr. King Kong standing here,

58:19.320 --> 58:21.400
“Oh my God,

58:23.320 --> 58:25.480
he’s already here.”

58:26.840 --> 58:30.560
In the same way, when our knowledge is in the brain,

58:30.760 --> 58:34.680
it is just like a film, is away from … it’s not in our heart.

58:35.080 --> 58:39.920
But when it is heart, it acts, it works.

58:41.160 --> 58:43.160
It doesn’t work through brain.

58:43.360 --> 58:46.920
In the brain it just stays but in the heart it works.

58:47.120 --> 58:50.280
And in the heart resides the spirit.

58:51.720 --> 58:55.000
Is very simple, that

58:56.120 --> 58:58.720
we are people

58:58.920 --> 59:03.280
who are more living with our brains, not with our heart.

59:03.480 --> 59:06.160
But know that we are in reality.

59:06.400 --> 59:09.320
You see, King Kong is standing before us.

59:09.520 --> 59:12.640
You are not seeing a film; it’s in reality.

59:12.880 --> 59:16.200
And in reality,

59:16.440 --> 59:20.160
the heart has to work, not the brain,

59:20.360 --> 59:23.800
because reality is only through the heart,

59:24.000 --> 59:27.320
not through the brain.

59:27.840 --> 59:30.320
Once you understand this,

59:30.840 --> 59:33.920
then you’ll open your heart, enlarge it,

59:34.120 --> 59:36.000
“Now this is in my heart.”

59:36.240 --> 59:39.560
So the whole thing will be so clear-cut in your head

59:39.800 --> 59:43.040
you will know everything clearly.

59:43.840 --> 59:47.840
What is to be done, how to react, how to work it out.

59:49.200 --> 59:53.080
If you put all this knowledge of Sahaja Yoga into your heart –

59:53.280 --> 59:55.320
first of all you’ll have to enlarge your heart

59:55.520 --> 59:58.440
otherwise you can’t put this ocean –

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.360
and then you see, “This is Sahaj Yoga.”

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.600
To Me everything seems to be Sahaj Yoga,

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.000
buying this house, coming to this place,

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.680
all this is Sahaj Yoga. I can see clearly.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.480
Anything that I see, I connect it to Sahaj Yoga immediately,

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.120
“This is Sahaja Yoga.”

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.800
Why this is so? This is because of Sahaj Yoga.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.640
This is Sahaj Yoga.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.360
So everywhere you start seeing Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:29.000
when your heart knows what your brain knows.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.880
I have known people who know all the mantras very well,

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.040
everything very well and all that but in the heart.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.520
So put it in the heart.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.000
In Sahaja Yoga the guru is not

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.880
through his brain but through his heart.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.240
May God bless you all.
