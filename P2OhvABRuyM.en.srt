4
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,296
The other day I was telling you

5
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:10,270
about our growth within, after Self-realisation.

6
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:17,951
The germination takes place very easily;

7
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:23,606
the Kundalini rises very easily;

8
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:33,789
also pierces the fontanelle bone area very easily.

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,129
That is really, as you call it, ‘Sahaja’.

10
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:42,261
It’s a tremendous happening.

11
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:47,417
It takes thousands of years for people to get realisation.

12
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:49,691
That’s also a fact.

13
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,749
They had to be born again and again

14
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:59,659
and very few selected got realisation.

15
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:05,213
But today, as I said, the time has come

16
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:12,743
for many flowers to become fruits.

17
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:19,202
So this happening doesn’t take much time,

18
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:23,217
it’s just [a] split of a second in many people.

19
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:28,181
But about the growth I was talking last time,

20
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:33,757
I ended up at Self-realisation, what is Self-realisation is

21
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:39,062
and what do we expect from Self-realisation.

22
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:43,599
The first thing that happens to you, as you know,

23
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,342
when the Kundalini rises, [is]

24
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:54,309
that you start feeling physically better; your health improves.

25
00:01:55,323 --> 00:02:01,085
Though the Kundalini rises from the centre most nadi,

26
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:05,828
called as Brahmanadi, inside the Sushumna, in the central part.

27
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:16,331
And first thing that happens is the physical being which is helped.

28
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:23,369
That is not the innermost core of every centre.

29
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:29,910
The innermost core of every centre is the Spiritual.

30
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:35,815
But how is it [that] first the physical being is helped?

31
00:02:35,935 --> 00:02:38,215
Is very interesting to see.

32
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:48,768
The Kundalini rises through many centres, passes through Agya,

33
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:50,837
pierces through fontanelle,

34
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:55,484
and becomes one with the All-pervading Power.

35
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:04,548
So, first thing that receives the information is the seat of Sadashiva,

36
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:10,078
is the seat of your Atma, your Spirit, on top of your head.

37
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,899
But the Spirit is in your heart.

38
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,331
So the first awakening takes place, or enlightenment takes place,

39
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:21,335
in your brain. It’s a very important point to be seen.

40
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:28,639
In your brain resides the conscious mind,

41
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,666
that means the present,

42
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:41,993
and when it is enlightened that means your awareness is enlightened;

43
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:45,582
you get enlightenment in your awareness,

44
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:50,200
in your attention.

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,711
As I told you last time that attention is enlightened first.

46
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:57,193
So through your attention you can find out

47
00:03:57,313 --> 00:04:00,157
what is the matter with other persons, you can find out

48
00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:01,928
what centres are catching,

49
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:06,885
what your centres are catching. So, on the physical level,

50
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:14,157
you know what’s happening.

51
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:20,258
That’s the, we should say, the present.

52
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:25,255
We feel our gross (physical) being enlightened,

53
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:29,425
we can feel them on our fingers.

54
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:38,856
But when the Kundalini is rising in your being,

55
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:46,261
She goes straight on to the fontanelle bone area.

56
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:50,741
Of course, if there is a hurdle or anything then She stops

57
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:53,340
and tries to indicate.

58
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:59,778
At that time, if She is not successful,

59
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:03,095
for example you have got a liver problem,

60
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,265
then She will come and throb at liver problem,

61
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:09,283
informing you that there’s something wrong with the liver.

62
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:14,560
That’s why a Sahaja Yogi has to give vibrations from outside.

63
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:23,993
When the Kundalini rises above the Agya,

64
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:30,316
She goes up to this fontanelle and pierces.

65
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:35,567
But when She cannot go beyond Agya She spreads out here.

66
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:40,404
She can spread out here also.

67
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:45,261
And then She starts trickling down,

68
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:48,885
the grace on the…

69
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:55,892
or you can say She starts relaxing

70
00:05:56,567 --> 00:06:00,444
this area which is called as murdha (brain)

71
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,807
and that’s how She makes more space in the Agya.

72
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:12,659
And this relaxation works out the outer side of the physical being.

73
00:06:13,555 --> 00:06:16,196
Also when She pierces through

74
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:25,113
in anyone who has a simpler personality,

75
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:30,001
who is not so complicated, first thing that happens

76
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:34,110
is that the grace starts falling through from the sides;

77
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:41,205
and the Grace starts falling into the Ida and Pingala

78
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:49,156
and then She comes down by which She supplies Ida and Pingala.

79
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:52,040
The Grace, not the Kundalini,

80
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,563
you should not confuse these two things.

81
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:59,316
Because of Her piercing, there’s an opening made

82
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:04,698
and the Grace starts coming down, and She,

83
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:13,255
I should say the Grace Itself, feeds all the centres from outside.

84
00:07:14,548 --> 00:07:18,618
So, first the physical being is improves.

85
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:31,536
The second one, I’m now going from outside inside,

86
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:42,183
the second one is the mental being.

87
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:49,384
Now the mental being relates to our awareness as well,

88
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,672
also to our sense of understanding, intellect and all those things.

89
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:01,416
When the Grace starts flowing more and more within us,

90
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:05,786
then our mental being gets enlightened.

91
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,276
When the mental being gets enlightened

92
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:14,209
then you start feeling centres of other persons.

93
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:20,167
Some people you know just get cured.

94
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:24,625
They don’t feel any vibrations, nothing, just they feel cured.

95
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:28,670
They get cured of cancer, this, that, all sorts of things.

96
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,340
But they do not get vibrations, they do not get a feeling,

97
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,517
they cannot make out whether it is this chakra or that chakra,

98
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:38,927
they do not feel anything.

99
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:45,712
So the first thing that would happen to anyone is the physical gift,

100
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:50,684
the physical being improves – that’s the Grace of God.

101
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,782
Because if you are not well,

102
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:58,079
if you have some pains and some troubles and some diseases,

103
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:02,363
how are you going to pay attention to God and Spirit?

104
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:05,708
That’s very important.

105
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:11,445
But before it comes to the mental self,

106
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:17,929
something else happens also,

107
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:23,450
that, when the Kundalini pierces,

108
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:31,392
the falling of Grace first comes down

109
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:38,457
to the lower centres starting from Nabhi downwards.

110
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:46,257
And Nabhi is a great sucker, Nabhi starts sucking the vibrations,

111
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,976
or you can say the Grace.

112
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:55,659
And Nabhi starts getting awakened first of all.

113
00:09:56,452 --> 00:10:01,473
From Nabhi rises the Swadhishthana Chakra which goes round and round,

114
00:10:01,593 --> 00:10:07,630
which is connected with Nabhi, so it flows to Swadhishthana

115
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:14,582
and then Swadhishthana also starts working out itself.

116
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:21,250
Swadhishthana sucks in as much as possible

117
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,005
and works out all the centres,

118
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,220
I mean all the organs, which are supplied by it.

119
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:40,709
But Nabhi, when it receives surplus Grace,

120
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:45,300
then it starts opening,

121
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:57,805
and its opening helps us in very gross material life also.

122
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,259
You are helped materially.

123
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:07,309
Supposing if you are materially absolutely hopeless,

124
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:11,344
then you are not going to pay attention to God also.

125
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:14,022
So it’s the responsibility of God

126
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:17,374
to first give you a little material well-being.

127
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:20,227
Like I received a letter and also on the tape

128
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:26,017
they have mentioned about somebody who wanted to come to India, from Australia.

129
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:30,264
She got her realisation, she felt very much better,

130
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:36,519
and she wanted to come to India but she had no money to come,

131
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:42,194
and that desire was there. Because of that desire in her

132
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:48,715
she may not have put full attention to her Spirit.

133
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:54,851
And that’s how our material desires get satisfied.

134
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,695
And her daughter discovered, she had a bracelet,

135
00:11:59,815 --> 00:12:02,978
many bracelets and things she had, and she went to a jumble sale,

136
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:10,071
for selling them for some sort of a programme they had for children.

137
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:14,046
And they discovered that one of the bracelets that she had,

138
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:19,421
which she thought to be a junk, was of gold, surprisingly.

139
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,508
And she sold it for $1500.

140
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:27,859
 She was going to sell it for 20c, you see,.

141
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:34,137
And that was exactly the amount needed for their travel, for both of them.

142
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:39,164
Now one would say that – how it works out?

143
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:46,849
It is miraculous, that’s all I can say, because the machinery is such.

144
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:58,749
The pouring of the Grace within you, informs the Lakshmi Principle in the Nabhi.

145
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,624
Nabhi just show them where is this.

146
00:13:00,744 --> 00:13:02,896
Somebody has to get up and show them,

147
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,768
Douglas? Or someone. Douglas (Fry) come along.

148
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:15,269
This is the one. And this has the deity of Lakshmi,

149
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:18,471
She is the deity of your well-being.

150
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,992
And this is what Krishna has said, “Yoga Kshema vahamyam”

151
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,447
“When the yoga takes place,

152
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:28,148
means when the Kundalini pierces through fontanelle bone area,

153
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:33,933
I look after your well-being.” How does he look after? Through Lakshmi.

154
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:41,240
Now this is a universal Deity. She’s present in human beings

155
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,993
and also she is present in material things.

156
00:13:49,782 --> 00:13:53,583
It is such a fantastic thing

157
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:58,562
that you cannot explain these things

158
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:01,287
on human level, really it is difficult.

159
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:05,052
Only thing you can see for yourself how it works out.

160
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:08,946
It’s so tremendous. Like if you have to explain

161
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:12,711
about human civilisation to an ant it’s going to be difficult –

162
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:16,087
in the same way it is. It’s so difficult you see.

163
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:19,071
And human beings they are so proud of their rationality

164
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,758
and I find it impossible how to explain, but it does work that way.

165
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,666
You can only see the working of it.

166
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,637
But if you are proud of your rationality you go ahead with it,

167
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:34,697
what can you do? But you just see for yourself how it works.

168
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:42,183
So the second layer that really is improved is your material being.

169
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:47,418
So many people have been helped, who are here, materially.

170
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:56,458
The well-being has come, actual well-being, apart from satisfaction.

171
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:59,279
But as I said, it does not cross the limit,

172
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,998
like you do not become Mr. Ford!

173
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,419
Because that’s some sort of a behaviour which is asahaja,

174
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:12,423
to be so rich, I mean it’s ridiculous, vulgar!

175
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:21,400
You become better than what you are, but not the best,

176
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:28,652
because you have to be in the centre at a satisfied point.

177
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,103
And everybody has to enjoy you

178
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,361
and you have to enjoy everybody.

179
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:42,591
But supposing if you are in dire necessities and problematic things

180
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:46,596
then you cannot pay attention to God and that’s what He understands –

181
00:15:46,716 --> 00:15:47,873
that you cannot.

182
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:51,393
If you have physical problem, if you have cancer,

183
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:54,119
how can you say that, “You pay attention to your Spirit,”

184
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,176
when you have cancer? I mean, such a body!

185
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:59,187
After all if this whole house is going to collapse

186
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:01,490
you cannot meditate here.

187
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:08,219
So, first the physical stability is established and second is the material one.

188
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:14,459
And there are many factors which work out material stability, automatically.

189
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,615
First of them is that, once you find your Spirit,

190
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:27,861
you just automatically give up your habits.

191
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,795
Most of these habits come from your Nabhi,

192
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:35,498
because from Nabhi Chakra you get your seeking.

193
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,994
And you think, when you have a habit [that] you are seeking your joy.

194
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:44,673
I mean, many people have said, “Mother, but I enjoy my glass of whiskey,”

195
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:46,899
they have said to me, many a times.

196
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:51,085
Or, “I enjoy a little ride here and there,”

197
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:55,014
somebody has said that, “Mother, I enjoy some Kensington ladies,”

198
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,078
you see, sort of thing.

199
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:01,742
But once you start enjoying your Spirit, it drops out.

200
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:09,876
All your attention becomes enlightened and your priorities change.

201
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,690
You don’t enjoy these things that you have been enjoying before,

202
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:15,218
so you just don’t do it. I mean, I don’t have to tell you,

203
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,677
“Don’t drink!” you just don’t do it.

204
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:20,947
I don’t have to tell you that you don’t smoke, you just don’t do.

205
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,965
But there are some very weak people, extremely weak, I mean,

206
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,633
very, very weak people. They take time, I know.

207
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:34,707
They plod and they are very slow moving creatures, but not all.

208
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:45,825
I would say quite a small number and

209
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:52,740
most of the people, they just give up things. You just give up.

210
00:17:53,248 --> 00:17:56,926
So you start saving money, automatically,

211
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:02,724
because the money goes to the races or to the pubs

212
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:06,105
or to other habits which are useless, you know they are useless:

213
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,837
smoking, drugs,

214
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:13,991
any such foolish things that you are wasting money on.

215
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:21,212
And you start channelizing this money for something better,

216
00:18:21,338 --> 00:18:23,682
something that gives you more joy,

217
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:27,535
more happiness and of an eternal nature, not a temporary one,

218
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:30,282
that you take the drink [the] previous night

219
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,520
and in the morning you are finished!

220
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,787
You get a drink that never finishes, which you enjoy all the time.

221
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:43,873
You get drunk like that. Because in my own life I have seen,

222
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:52,291
it’s such a so-called sophisticated elite life.

223
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:56,211
People drink much more, you see, than normal people drink.

224
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:59,621
And they ask me, “Why don’t you drink?” I say, “I am already drunk!

225
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:02,004
The day I was born I was so drunk that, now,

226
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:05,784
if I have to drink more I’ll fall off, so better not ask me!”

227
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:08,486
They are quite frightened at my, this thing,

228
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,641
I said, “I am really fully drunk already!”

229
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,857
So they start looking at me!

230
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:21,442
And they never find me anyway less in spirits as they are.

231
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:24,424
Actually I’m always little more than they are,

232
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:27,015
so they never force me to do that.

233
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:30,978
But these things drop out automatically.

234
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:34,124
I don’t have to tell you that you have to drop out.

235
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,111
Because most of the things you have done

236
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:38,221
because you have been seeking something.

237
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:41,630
You know, there are people, I asked them, “Why do you do this?”

238
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,265
They said, “We are seeking love,” I said “How?

239
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:47,338
How can you find love like this?” Or somebody will say that,

240
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,238
“I am seeking God.” There are many people who are taking drugs,

241
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:53,018
I mean, genuinely, just for seeking.

242
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:55,974
But when they have found it, what they were seeking,

243
00:19:56,094 --> 00:20:00,487
they don’t take drugs. But this is one of the side issues,

244
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:03,425
I was just trying to make it little lighter.

245
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:08,987
But mainly what happens is that, actually the principle of Lakshmi,

246
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,800
the principle of well-being within you is awakened.

247
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:20,969
And if you listen to one of my tapes where I have described

248
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:25,479
what a Lakshmi is, and how She is symbolised:

249
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,264
it’s a very beautiful picture of Lakshmi

250
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:34,521
that the great seers have put before us:

251
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:40,399
That, She is after all a Mother, She is a mother.

252
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:47,931
A person who is a rich man has to be a motherly person.

253
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:52,185
But here you find, in the whole world I have seen [that]

254
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:55,917
those who have even little money their nose goes up like that

255
00:20:56,037 --> 00:21:00,572
and if you see them from down below they look like wolves

256
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,933
not like mothers – most surprising.

257
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:12,426
And this Lakshmi who is a Mother, wears a white sari,

258
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:17,972
very elegant, with a gold border.

259
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:25,155
That represents that he doesn’t put people into awe

260
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:29,603
by his pomp and show and this and that.

261
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,680
She’s standing on a lotus.

262
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,763
Imagine any human being standing on a lotus!

263
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:50,331
That means that She’s so light in Her behaviour towards others.

264
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:56,892
She’s so delicate, She touches people with such delicacy,

265
00:21:57,012 --> 00:22:00,490
that people don’t feel hurt,

266
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:09,168
they are not in any way pressurized by the riches of people.

267
00:22:09,557 --> 00:22:11,306
But you know it’s just the opposite,

268
00:22:11,426 --> 00:22:14,586
if your so-called ‘rich’ you see! Horrible!

269
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:19,731
If somebody’s coming in here I would like to get out of that door.

270
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:23,059
They try to pressurise because they have money.

271
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:27,713
You see, if somebody starts talking big, you just find out,

272
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:32,525
99% he must have won some horse race!

273
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:39,536
This pressurising is a sign that he is not a lakshmipati,

274
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:44,793
he has nothing to do with Lakshmi. So he’s so gracious.

275
00:22:48,698 --> 00:22:53,542
I have seen such people. I have seen some people like that.

276
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:59,138
I have seen one in England you will be surprised to know.

277
00:22:59,937 --> 00:23:04,418
I have just seen him once. He was a gentleman

278
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:07,127
who was some lord and something

279
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:12,054
and later on he came to India and he was a Viceroy (Lord Mountbatten).

280
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:18,086
And there was a gentleman who was very well known to us,

281
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:23,416
he once met him in a train which was delayed or something happened

282
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:26,633
and they had to get down at another station

283
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:28,771
and somehow or other they were put together.

284
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:33,059
And he was so simple and so good and so helpful

285
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,210
that this gentleman was taken by him.

286
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,607
He said, “Now better you come to my house because

287
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:44,266
it’s not going to be any train, you come to my house.”

288
00:23:44,386 --> 00:23:46,449
When he went to his house he was surprised

289
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,248
the house was like a palace! And then he told he who he was,

290
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:56,897
and he was amazed! And he even carried his bag with him.

291
00:23:57,017 --> 00:24:01,569
Such a simple man. And then, when this person told me

292
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,723
that such a person is there, then he re-visited India,

293
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,441
then he brought him to see me.

294
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:09,252
But he’s no more now he’s dead this gentleman.

295
00:24:09,372 --> 00:24:13,307
But he was a very big man in India and a very big person

296
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:17,676
but such a simple man! Such a simple person.

297
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,589
So that’s the significance of well-being.

298
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:28,364
So when a Sahaja Yogi becomes well-being, gets well-being

299
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:34,338
then he has all these qualities in him that,

300
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:39,685
he doesn’t impress on others that he has a property

301
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:43,608
or he has got money and he should pressurise others.

302
00:24:43,728 --> 00:24:49,149
If he’s really a good Sahaja Yogi he would be the humblest of all

303
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:53,486
and he would be very generous because in Her hand,

304
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:55,688
one hand is like this.

305
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:59,361
The left hand is like this, means She’s generous, She’s giving.

306
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,265
All the time She’s giving. She’s not taking anything,

307
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:07,252
She’s giving. And that’s how such a person is all the time giving.

308
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:12,862
I have seen people who, after Sahaja Yoga,

309
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:18,982
receive a lot of blessings and are miserly or try to oppress others,

310
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,715
lose their properties and lose their money

311
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:24,370
and really suffer a little bit.

312
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,199
Because otherwise there’s no way of teaching them.

313
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,154
So the generosity flows from Her hand

314
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:35,672
and another hand is like this,

315
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:42,976
which means that She gives protection to people.

316
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:49,933
There have to be some people who are ashritas, are dependents,

317
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:54,376
who just depend, from whom such a person doesn’t take any money,

318
00:25:54,496 --> 00:26:00,284
they just live. These systems are still in India.

319
00:26:00,404 --> 00:26:05,641
Those people who are well off always have about two, three people

320
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:10,407
being supported by them. Is a system still working in India,

321
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,365
in many places. I mean, in my father’s house we always remember

322
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:16,097
we had people like that.

323
00:26:16,217 --> 00:26:19,807
They were educated and given higher education by my father free,

324
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:24,278
just free. But never did they feel that they were anybody else,

325
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:28,855
treated with same respect and with same dignity as we were treated.

326
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:32,939
But that was a part of life, one had to do it.

327
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:34,909
This is the ashraya,

328
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,033
is that there should be some people depending on you.

329
00:26:38,153 --> 00:26:41,576
England also I’ve seen people have cats, dogs, things like that, you see,

330
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:45,475
little bit they do spend on cats and dogs.

331
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:49,063
But better to spend on human beings.

332
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:51,183
What am I going to do with cats and dogs?

333
00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:53,529
Can I give them realization? (laughter)

334
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:58,897
It’s better to look after human beings

335
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,667
than to look after cats and dogs so much!

336
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:04,665
But I have seen that when they are dealing with cats and dogs

337
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:06,008
they are very happy people,

338
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:09,189
but with human beings they are very unhappy, I don’t know why.

339
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:11,664
If you must have seen in the BBC and all that,

340
00:27:11,784 --> 00:27:15,119
when they have these advertisements I have seen in television sometimes,

341
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:19,742
you see a person having a cat, she’ll always smile and joke and this.

342
00:27:19,862 --> 00:27:24,067
And anybody having children, she looks so miserable! (laughter)

343
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:33,611
That should not be so. There should be somebody dependent.

344
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:38,692
It’s not important to measure every money, to ask for 2p (£0.02)

345
00:27:38,812 --> 00:27:42,723
– “I gave you yesterday, will you return 2p to me?”

346
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:46,793
It doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to be like that.

347
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:52,128
If it comes to that, alright, give some money – forget about it.

348
00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:55,687
It helps you such a lot, it helps you such a lot.

349
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:01,106
To be meticulously so observant about how much money you lent

350
00:28:01,311 --> 00:28:05,292
it’s better to be more worried about how much you have taken

351
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:09,407
than to be how much you have given. It helps a lot.

352
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:14,851
It’s a thing one has to realize in life, how much it helps.

353
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:21,191
I have seen in my own life it has helped so many times.

354
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:26,290
I mean you really have people then, around you.

355
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:29,784
It’s a matter of 5 Rupees and 10 Rupees.

356
00:28:29,904 --> 00:28:33,864
It’s so important then to some people at a [certain] point,

357
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:36,733
and it works wonders!

358
00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:45,252
I mean, you can have a human worth millions by paying sometimes 5 Rupees,

359
00:28:45,372 --> 00:28:48,950
it can work out that way. So try to be more giving

360
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,485
and then you receive more as a Sahaja Yogi.

361
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:56,647
Remember that now you are connected with Lakshmi.

362
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:01,271
The more generous you are the more you get it.

363
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:06,060
When you are small-minded you do no receive Her blessings.

364
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,185
You have to give, you have to give.

365
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:14,147
Once you give, it starts flowing, the stagnation is over

366
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:16,200
and the flow starts coming in.

367
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,219
Otherwise you are stagnated when your hand is, you see,

368
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:21,880
tight fisted as you call it.

369
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:25,774
English language has so many good words,

370
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:29,316
though they are now losing their meaning!

371
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:34,378
They call it you are very, I don’t know there must be some new words

372
00:29:34,498 --> 00:29:37,230
for being very, very miserly, some good word, you know,

373
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,043
which doesn’t mean miserly but must be some ‘economical’

374
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:47,238
or something fantastic. But actually miserliness, is miserliness,

375
00:29:47,358 --> 00:29:50,354
give it whatever name you like, it’s horrible.

376
00:29:50,474 --> 00:29:53,341
And one should not take to miserliness,

377
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:56,981
that is a curse I tell you, it’s a disease,

378
00:29:57,101 --> 00:30:05,100
it’s like leprosy, to be hated. Try to be generous.

379
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:14,379
Now the generosity of maybe, I don’t know, but maybe of money,

380
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:17,176
is not difficult for some people.

381
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:22,585
But generosity of saying something good to others is rare.

382
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:27,415
You see somebody in a good dress,

383
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,379
you should be generous enough to say,

384
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:33,993
“Oh, it’s fantastic, it’s beautiful.” What’s wrong?

385
00:30:34,113 --> 00:30:40,074
But jealousy, that goes against Lakshmi completely.

386
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,730
It’s better that others are wearing it;

387
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,434
you don’t pay for it and you enjoy it! (laughter)

388
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:50,833
It’s very logical you just see.

389
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:55,631
You see, if you own this hall, it will be a headache for you isn’t it,

390
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:59,135
to keep it alright. I mean imagine the people who own it,

391
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:02,106
and to put it right because everybody will come and criticise,

392
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:03,951
“This is not good, that’s not good.”

393
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:08,684
But it’s nice to be here, when it doesn’t belong to you, to enjoy it.

394
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:14,469
It’s very simple. Just try to enjoy it, to be generous with people,

395
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:20,028
be kind to them. This generosity is lacking.

396
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:26,431
When this starts, then the inner core of emotional being starts

397
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,506
getting enlightened.

398
00:31:28,705 --> 00:31:33,558
Go to the subtler side of material well-being

399
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:37,447
and you start getting into emotional thing.

400
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:42,865
Small, small things work out, very small.

401
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:46,040
It’s very sweet.

402
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:53,052
We have so many examples of this kind of little sweetness

403
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:56,036
being expressed.

404
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:03,203
And this generosity should come to all the Sahaja Yogis,

405
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:06,071
of saying good things to others.

406
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:10,369
Doesn’t matter [that] it is exaggeration, doesn’t matter,

407
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:16,340
because it acts as a buffer.

408
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,686
Then the fright of the strangers,

409
00:32:19,806 --> 00:32:23,947
fright of the neighbours, fright of other human beings, you know.

410
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,476
Every human being has become now [that] he sees

411
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:29,664
another human being coming, he recoils back. Imagine!

412
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:33,141
First, I mean, say about fifty years back it was like dogs;

413
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:36,881
if any human being saw another human being they used to bark!

414
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:43,181
Now it is another way round. So, the fear of your brother,

415
00:32:43,301 --> 00:32:49,171
of your own kin and kith, of your part and parcel.

416
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:53,571
They are your own, you don’t know, they are part and parcel of your being,

417
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:56,267
you can feel it, after Sahaja Yoga you can feel it,

418
00:32:56,387 --> 00:32:58,244
I don’t have to tell you.

419
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:03,376
You can feel them within yourself, they are within you.

420
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:10,002
And then the sweetness of saying something sweet,

421
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:17,930
of saying something sweet, is so nice,

422
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:23,859
is so rewarding, itself, itself, so rewarding.

423
00:33:24,073 --> 00:33:28,397
The movement of Shakti is always this way.

424
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:32,018
If I give you love, love comes back to me.

425
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:35,426
If I give you hatred, hatred comes back to me.

426
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:40,598
And double fold everything. If I give you love,

427
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,745
say 1 unit, I may get 7 units of love.

428
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:47,568
But if I give you hatred of 1, that too,

429
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:50,401
7 units of hatred comes to you.

430
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:53,390
The mathematics is complete.

431
00:33:53,953 --> 00:33:58,890
So try to understand that, emotionally,

432
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:03,289
you have to understand your material well-being.

433
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:08,215
How to express emotionally your material well-being

434
00:34:08,335 --> 00:34:10,441
is a very sweet thing.

435
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:14,302
I would give you an example of Gavin

436
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:18,417
because I can’t forget that very sweet incident:

437
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,484
One day we had called some people, you see,

438
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:26,331
I didn’t know there would be so many coming, in his house.

439
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:30,376
And he has a house but, I mean, not so big like this.

440
00:34:30,496 --> 00:34:33,553
So there were about fifty people, around. And I told him,

441
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:37,602
“Prepare some food for them.” But I thought for fifty people

442
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:40,489
he could not have prepared, at the most for ten people!

443
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:44,132
So I was quite embarrassed  and I was waiting for people to go away,

444
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:47,345
I didn’t say, “Stay on for dinner,” or anything, I thought,

445
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:50,682
“Poor Gavin, how could he have cooked for fifty people?”

446
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:53,723
And when they disappeared, about five, six were remained.

447
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:57,055
I said, “Now let’s have dinner!” He was very unhappy

448
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:59,888
and he was looking this side and that side,

449
00:35:00,008 --> 00:35:02,496
I said, “What happened?” But he didn’t say anything.

450
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:05,562
So I slept that night in his house. Next morning I got up –

451
00:35:05,682 --> 00:35:09,573
still he was very uneasy. Next day I said,

452
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,957
“What’s the matter? What’s playing on your mind?”

453
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,666
He said, “Mother why did you ask all of them to go away?

454
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:16,841
I had prepared [dinner] for fifty of them?”

455
00:35:16,962 --> 00:35:19,631
This filled me with such joy you can’t imagine!

456
00:35:19,752 --> 00:35:21,735
Tremendous joy,

457
00:35:24,613 --> 00:35:25,794
tremendous joy.

458
00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:29,223
I mean, that I cannot get over such things you know.

459
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,920
And I have just seen so many Sahaja Yogis like that,

460
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,356
very very sweet persons. Another is Gregoire,

461
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:39,575
another very sweetie person, you know, the way he does things for others.

462
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:44,945
Sometimes the way he works it out is so sweet,

463
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:51,613
and how he really knows how to express himself sweetly

464
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,783
in small, little things.

465
00:35:54,838 --> 00:36:01,500
It’s so surprising, how people are very beautiful

466
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:07,083
and how they are working out these material things

467
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:09,544
to express their emotions.

468
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:12,930
Material is for emotions only, you see.

469
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,385
My mother had a principal that, if she had six sarees,

470
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:18,569
the seventh one she’ll present out.

471
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:22,438
She had kept six; not more [are] needed, you see.

472
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:25,124
And she was a woman of great principle, I must say,

473
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:29,318
because she used to spin her own sarees. Can you imagine!

474
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:32,894
And that’s what she used to wear, herself.

475
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:35,155
And she was a wife of a very rich man, I mean,

476
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,964
she had no problem of money but this was her principle,

477
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:40,578
she used to live like that. And she said that,

478
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,786
“What? I need six, more than [that] I don’t need,”

479
00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:46,598
because it’s cotton sarees, you see, so

480
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:50,194
one saree you wash and next you wear and you can just press it.

481
00:36:50,315 --> 00:36:53,145
We had people in the house who could do that for her.

482
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:55,626
She said, “There’s no need to have more than six.”

483
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,826
And one she would keep for some occasion, you see, expensive one,

484
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:01,748
if she has to go for a wedding and all that, that’s all.

485
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:05,104
So the seventh was kept (to give away) and out of the six,

486
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:07,995
if she got one more she would donate that to somebody.

487
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:12,833
She would only keep up to six you see, that was her principle,

488
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:17,089
and she managed her life very well.

489
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:24,043
And I was also bit too much of a generous person

490
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:29,330
and she always supported my generosity, always she supported it.

491
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,719
And she was very happy when she found that I would just give away

492
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,834
lots of things to people who came to my house and she would say,

493
00:37:35,955 --> 00:37:38,011
“Oh that’s very good, she should do that.”

494
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:40,331
Everybody used to say that, “That should be done”.

495
00:37:40,451 --> 00:37:43,118
Always used to encourage me for such things that I did.

496
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:45,470
But I found [that] all things have only value

497
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:49,037
if I can give them away otherwise they have no value.

498
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:52,066
And I keep only the things that are being presented to me

499
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,530
all the rest pass out of my hands very easily into people.

500
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:58,433
Anybody who says, “I like this,” “Alright, have it!”

501
00:37:58,554 --> 00:38:01,839
You see, I feel so happy to give it to them and it’s really rewarding.

502
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,442
Now that person thinks, “What should I give you back?”

503
00:38:04,563 --> 00:38:06,527
I said, “Now please! That’s not to be done

504
00:38:06,648 --> 00:38:09,425
because you know already, come and see, this house is filled

505
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:12,177
with things, and I don’t know how to get rid of them.”

506
00:38:12,298 --> 00:38:16,036
If I buy anything myself, of course I don’t earn anything

507
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:21,938
so it’s from my husband’s money, I try to give it away.

508
00:38:22,224 --> 00:38:25,341
It’s very nice, it’s really extremely nice.

509
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:28,014
After all what’s the use of these things in the house?

510
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:30,274
What are you going to do [with them]?

511
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:34,438
I mean, if you have to have a personal archives, you can have!

512
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:37,643
You see, something like that, putting up this thing bought there,

513
00:38:37,764 --> 00:38:41,579
this thing bought there. But normally what do you do?

514
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:46,720
So this kind of a generosity is to be developed within us.

515
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:55,013
The aesthetics of generosity is to be seen.

516
00:38:55,728 --> 00:39:01,036
How you give things to others and how you express your emotional being.

517
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:06,114
For people who are emotionally dry because of ego orientation,

518
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:10,331
should learn these things, is very important.

519
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:14,524
That will give them some emotional side also.

520
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,316
[It’s] very much necessary for people

521
00:39:17,436 --> 00:39:21,887
who do not feel their feelings much, their joy much;

522
00:39:22,007 --> 00:39:26,665
they should try to do it [then] they will start feeling it much more.

523
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:30,900
Then the emotional side is enlightened within us,

524
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:37,002
the Grace starts flowing up to emotional side.

525
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:42,276
In emotional side, first of all the purification takes place.

526
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:44,389
That’s very important.

527
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:47,139
To lead a very beautiful emotional life

528
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:50,315
you must have pure ideas,

529
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:54,098
otherwise you can never be emotionally alright.

530
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:56,889
You see, like in a tree you have to have leaves

531
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:00,352
you have to have roots, you have to have fruits,

532
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:04,187
you have to have flowers at it’s proper places.

533
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:07,382
Like in your house you have to have a drawing room,

534
00:40:07,502 --> 00:40:10,924
you have to have a bedroom, you have to have a bathroom;

535
00:40:11,044 --> 00:40:15,331
everything separated. You do not put them into a complete,

536
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:21,226
what do you call that? A mixer.

537
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:23,866
You do not make it like that, isn’t it?

538
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:27,123
You don’t put your bathroom in the drawing rooms do you?

539
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:30,217
I mean some people may start it with the kind of confusion

540
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:33,590
they have these days! But normally you do not do it.

541
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:40,709
In our own emotional life we must have pure sense.

542
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:46,948
Purity of a sisterly love, purity of a brotherly love,

543
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:49,062
purity of a wife’s love.

544
00:40:49,182 --> 00:40:54,748
For example infidelity: infidelity is impurity,

545
00:40:54,868 --> 00:40:58,413
infidelity comes when there is impurity.

546
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:02,137
Without fidelity the marriage life cannot be happy.

547
00:41:02,257 --> 00:41:04,212
That’s the basis of married life.

548
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:09,630
You see, “I like…”  this “I like” business is impurity.

549
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,078
The impurity in you likes it.

550
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,587
Gradually, after realisation, you start developing

551
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,039
that purity within you;

552
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:25,155
you start understanding these are your brothers and sisters.

553
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:30,137
As soon as your emotional life starts improving

554
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:33,139
your innocence starts awakening up.

555
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:37,190
You see? It is connected with your innocence.

556
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:41,022
The left side is connected with your innocence.

557
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:47,042
And then it starts flowering and you really become innocent.

558
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:51,751
Now see the practical side: you go to somebody’s house,

559
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:55,892
the gentleman has a beautiful wife, now your bad eyes on the wife,

560
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:59,651
how can you enjoy? You cannot enjoy, the husband cannot enjoy,

561
00:41:59,771 --> 00:42:03,478
the wife cannot enjoy, all the time there’s a fear.

562
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:07,000
Maybe the wife may run away with you or something may happen:

563
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,574
the whole house will be finished, I mean, you are so destructive!

564
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,982
So-called ‘charming’ men and ‘charming’ women

565
00:42:14,102 --> 00:42:16,078
are just destroying each others lives.

566
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:19,706
Where do they land? All in the orphanages!

567
00:42:19,826 --> 00:42:23,284
A woman marries seven times, a husband marries eight times.

568
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:25,920
All these old people are in the orphanage

569
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,301
and children are in another orphanage.

570
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:32,154
You see, you are just creating orphanages by this kind of impurity

571
00:42:32,274 --> 00:42:35,156
in your mind. But by telling you, these things,

572
00:42:35,276 --> 00:42:38,691
you are not going to believe me, nor you can do it,

573
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:41,402
but just when it happens.

574
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:46,946
When this happens, the innocence, the joy of pure love,

575
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:53,510
when there is no other impurity but just pure love

576
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,954
for brothers, sisters. I mean, here,

577
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:02,456
I have seen people don’t even sort of embrace each other– men.

578
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:04,371
It’s most surprising,

579
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:07,685
I mean, for us it’s something one can’t understand.

580
00:43:07,805 --> 00:43:10,790
So much impurity has gone into our brain that every man,

581
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,338
is he that way wrong?

582
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,991
When we came here my husband used to embrace every man;

583
00:43:15,112 --> 00:43:17,479
I told him, “Don’t do it, people will laugh at you!”

584
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,718
He said, “Really?”

585
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:21,565
He said, “But everyone is not like that, maybe one person.”

586
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:24,234
I said, “No, they think everybody is like that.”

587
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:27,143
You see, whatever they found pathological in one person,

588
00:43:27,263 --> 00:43:29,118
they think everybody is like that.

589
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:34,832
These psychologists, whatever they read in one abnormal person,

590
00:43:34,952 --> 00:43:38,295
they try to see in everyone! Everybody is not like that!

591
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:42,007
I mean there is no harm in understanding

592
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:46,048
that there is only 1% people are pathological

593
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,972
-who go to these psychologists!

594
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:52,486
The others who are spoilt are because of psychologists themselves!

595
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:55,710
They put ideas, “You have a guilt, you have a guilt, you have a guilt.”

596
00:43:55,831 --> 00:43:58,889
Even if you don’t have, you will have it! (laughter)

597
00:44:00,508 --> 00:44:03,480
They go on putting ideas into your heads.

598
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,222
All this is supposed to be intellectual expansion,

599
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:08,747
whatever you may call it, it’s all nonsense you see.

600
00:44:08,867 --> 00:44:10,924
A person who doesn’t commit sin you say,

601
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:12,567
“Oh, he must have committed sin,”

602
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:14,718
now he doesn’t know what to do he’ll come and say,

603
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:17,105
“Alright baba, I have committed sin, now I have to confess.

604
00:44:17,226 --> 00:44:19,241
So I have to confess, yes I have committed sin.”

605
00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:21,267
They play about like this.

606
00:44:21,387 --> 00:44:23,410
They just try to build you up and all that

607
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:26,497
and then they break you, shatter you completely and then you think,

608
00:44:26,618 --> 00:44:30,435
“Oh I am the most sinful person [who] ever lived!”

609
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,669
If you were that sinful,

610
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:37,448
do you think you will get realisation first of all?

611
00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:44,632
First ask yourself the question, “How did I get realisation?

612
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:46,477
How did I feel vibrations?

613
00:44:46,597 --> 00:44:49,782
If I was that sinful, how could I get it?”

614
00:44:50,378 --> 00:44:53,044
Throw away all these ideas of these psychologists

615
00:44:53,164 --> 00:44:55,324
and tell them that we don’t believe you!

616
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:59,519
You see, this is very few people who are really basically sinful.

617
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:04,792
I tell you, very, very rarely, I have not seen anyone so far,

618
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:07,545
except for these horrible gurus who are well known!

619
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:10,697
After all they are the people who are rakshasas,

620
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:14,296
they are not human beings, you see, so that’s a different category.

621
00:45:14,416 --> 00:45:17,062
But, otherwise, I have not seen basically a person

622
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:22,788
who has nothing good in him. Because everybody has the Spirit.

623
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:26,635
And definitely Spirit is superior much more dynamic

624
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:28,358
than all the sins put together.

625
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:32,605
What are these little, little sins here and there? What are you doing?

626
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:35,427
And there’s nothing to feel so diffident about it.

627
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:38,970
After all you are realised people, you are saints.

628
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,403
You are to be respected.

629
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,543
You have to respect yourself first of all.

630
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:49,364
You are all saints, do you realise that?

631
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,797
Once you realise you are saints you will start acting as saints,

632
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,893
how the saints act.

633
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,433
You will put yourself onto that pedestal of understanding

634
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:02,493
that you are really saints, otherwise you won’t get vibrations.

635
00:46:02,614 --> 00:46:04,200
Go and ask anyone of these!

636
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:08,458
They will tell you: the vibrations, only people who are saints get it.

637
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:13,234
In India all the people are burnt when they die;

638
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:16,847
not the saints, realised souls are not,

639
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:21,424
they are respected.

640
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:23,998
They say when the saints come to your house,

641
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:27,479
that’s the day, is the day of festival.

642
00:46:28,932 --> 00:46:36,067
And all of you are that so don’t think that you cannot do this,

643
00:46:36,187 --> 00:46:38,697
and you have this guilt and you have these things –

644
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:42,347
nothing of the kind! You are pure Spirit.

645
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:47,649
Be very lavish about it!

646
00:46:48,641 --> 00:46:54,611
Of course, I mean, too much indulgences into these things,

647
00:46:54,889 --> 00:47:00,129
emotional life also, can lead you to a stagnation point.

648
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:05,598
Like I hear people saying that, “There’s a lot of love between us.”

649
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:11,070
But one has to be discreet in that also:

650
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:17,076
does it make you universal or it makes you localised?

651
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:22,487
You see, like Britishers for British, Indians for Indians, finished!

652
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:29,097
If that love makes you universal, by which you say kindly things,

653
00:47:32,121 --> 00:47:39,213
by which you enjoy the love of other people, their vibrations.

654
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:44,513
Whatever creed, race, it is, whatever part of the world they come from,

655
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:47,287
they are Sahaja Yogis; if you start enjoying them,

656
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:51,090
then know that that is love.

657
00:47:51,756 --> 00:47:55,037
It should not be localised in any way.

658
00:47:55,411 --> 00:48:00,942
If there is any group forming, then must know that it is not love,

659
00:48:01,062 --> 00:48:05,840
it’s not Divinity, it’s not.

660
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:12,239
Divinity is universal, it embraces everything, everything.

661
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:16,177
It has no discrimination of any kind.

662
00:48:16,297 --> 00:48:21,781
It only discriminates between evil and good,

663
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,678
unrighteous and righteous,

664
00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:29,288
Christ and anti-Christ,

665
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:32,408
God and anti-God

666
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,760
but it does not discriminate on these three levels

667
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:44,915
that is physical appearances, mental approach

668
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:50,198
or mental development or emotional expressions.

669
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:52,569
Some people are emotionally very expressive.

670
00:48:52,689 --> 00:48:56,715
I would say English are less expressive by temperament maybe,

671
00:48:56,835 --> 00:49:00,461
that’s their temperament. Indians are extremely expressive.

672
00:49:00,582 --> 00:49:02,437
If you go to India, to a village, say,

673
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:06,163
you go to Rahuri (Maharashtra), they will just take you

674
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:11,581
in their embrace and would start weeping and crying with joy.

675
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:15,214
I mean, you will be amazed the way they will love you, I mean, imagine!

676
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:19,923
And for them it would be like, they wouldn’t mind

677
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:23,855
even if they have to spread themselves on the ground

678
00:49:23,975 --> 00:49:26,913
for you to walk smoothly

679
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:32,879
so that you don’t feel the horrible roads of India.

680
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:35,097
That kind of tremendous emotions,

681
00:49:35,217 --> 00:49:38,179
the expression you will be surprised.

682
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:40,494
You will be overwhelmed and sometimes shocked,

683
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:42,670
you know, the way they are.

684
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:47,200
But that doesn’t mean that English don’t love.

685
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,966
They love in their own way; they understand that.

686
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:56,640
So that’s how it should be that it is all embracing,

687
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,079
all shades, all types, all permutations, combinations.

688
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,241
Because this variety is created by God to create beauty

689
00:50:05,361 --> 00:50:07,165
and all the varieties must be accepted.

690
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:09,721
Imagine you all looking just the same,

691
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:14,130
how would it look? Horrible and boring!

692
00:50:14,336 --> 00:50:18,240
Every leaf is different, then what about human beings?

693
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,352
But in that difference there’s the unity of Spirit

694
00:50:21,472 --> 00:50:23,760
and if you can feel that unity

695
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,702
then you are emotionally absolutely correct and you are a realised soul.

696
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:36,688
And, last of all, the most important, is your Spirit,

697
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,881
Spirit that resides in your heart.

698
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:47,418
All this beauty is only perceived when there is light in your Spirit

699
00:50:47,538 --> 00:50:52,099
otherwise you cannot see all this beauty, you cannot enjoy it.

700
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:59,700
Spirit is the one which is the diamond

701
00:51:01,256 --> 00:51:04,789
which shines on this beautiful ring of your body,

702
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:10,625
mind and your emotions. That’s the most important thing.

703
00:51:10,745 --> 00:51:18,388
That is to be achieved, to be absolutely absorbed into your being.

704
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:23,547
That state should be achieved by all of you.

705
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:28,357
But the growth, if the outside is not alright,

706
00:51:28,477 --> 00:51:35,278
then the inside cannot be carried by that weak outside.

707
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:41,315
It’s such a strong thing spiritual life is a very strong thing;

708
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:45,192
it’s so dynamic, it’s so powerful.

709
00:51:45,938 --> 00:51:49,748
Sometimes, you know, it floods me completely.

710
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:52,945
I mean, I have to control myself;

711
00:51:53,065 --> 00:51:56,568
the love just shoots off from the being

712
00:51:56,688 --> 00:52:02,998
and just I want to give it but I wonder

713
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:06,023
whether you’ll be able to bear it,

714
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,967
so I have to control it a little bit [because]

715
00:52:11,087 --> 00:52:14,072
that flood may not be borne.

716
00:52:14,192 --> 00:52:19,625
So you have to enrich your outside to bear that inside beauty.

717
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:24,225
And the more you enrich it, the more you make it strong,

718
00:52:24,345 --> 00:52:27,095
the more it will shine.

719
00:52:27,254 --> 00:52:35,032
It’s so simultaneous because one must understand that Spirit is love,

720
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:40,992
is all intelligence, is all awareness,

721
00:52:41,112 --> 00:52:44,416
and it knows your problem. It slowly shines.

722
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:49,312
It sees how far you can bear, how far you can go.

723
00:52:49,828 --> 00:52:56,959
Then after realisation, when you start looking after your outside,

724
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:01,069
the inside starts shining by itself.

725
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:07,006
But attention should be towards your Spirit.

726
00:53:07,506 --> 00:53:11,977
All these outside qualities are so joy-giving to the Spirit.

727
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:15,592
You can’t imagine. Try them!

728
00:53:16,298 --> 00:53:17,895
You will enjoy yourself.

729
00:53:18,015 --> 00:53:20,597
We have not been able to enjoy ourselves much.

730
00:53:20,717 --> 00:53:23,148
If we could we would not [even] shun the jails,

731
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,951
I mean I would be happy in a jail I tell you,

732
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:28,962
because I can enjoy myself there better!

733
00:53:29,082 --> 00:53:32,046
But the one thing is there, you cannot enjoy yourself

734
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:36,303
so much when you cannot share it with others also isn’t it?

735
00:53:36,423 --> 00:53:41,796
It becomes like that. Without sharing you cannot enjoy yourself.

736
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:45,554
And that’s what should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

737
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:49,994
At that level you should come. We should be at that level.

738
00:53:50,114 --> 00:53:53,735
Try to keep your level that high, is important.

739
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:58,960
Sometimes you come down, you start criticising others.

740
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,555
Others are also not right, for example, somebody sees

741
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:04,112
somebody filthy, dirty, something like that.

742
00:54:04,232 --> 00:54:06,239
The person who’s filthy, dirty, of course

743
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,890
there’s something wrong with that person, no doubt,

744
00:54:09,011 --> 00:54:12,199
but that person should be pitied. At least he should be clean.

745
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,544
I mean, that’s the minimum of minimum.

746
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:19,057
But instead of that if you start criticising that person,

747
00:54:19,178 --> 00:54:21,018
you also become filthy in your language,

748
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:24,045
filthy in your mind and everything, so why [do it]? Leave it!

749
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:25,793
Let that person improve by himself,

750
00:54:25,913 --> 00:54:28,433
to see that he has to be clean, he has to be neat,

751
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:30,783
he has to be sensible.

752
00:54:31,775 --> 00:54:35,449
This is to be seen by that person himself and not by you.

753
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:38,164
Where is your attention?

754
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:42,535
It’s a habit in India, all the parents will ask the children

755
00:54:42,656 --> 00:54:44,938
when they are standing, “Where is your attention?”

756
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:48,231
“Where is my attention?” alright. Then again he’s standing there,

757
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:51,274
“Where is your attention?” Again he’ll be on the watch [out],

758
00:54:51,394 --> 00:54:53,150
“Where is my attention gone?”

759
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,654
We have to look after our attention, that’s all.

760
00:54:55,774 --> 00:55:01,476
“Where is my attention? Is it on the Spirit?”

761
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:05,200
Next time I’ll tell you more about the Spirit part.

762
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,830
I hope you have understood how necessary it is

763
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:11,944
to develop your inner being.

764
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:17,983
In your mental being, egoistical nature is to be controlled very much.

765
00:55:18,103 --> 00:55:23,346
I have seen people who go from left to right, they become egoistical.

766
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:28,891
Those who go from right to left, they become frightened.

767
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:36,447
All these side movements must be brought to the centre.

768
00:55:37,764 --> 00:55:43,360
You have to understand that from basics we have to rise higher.

769
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,509
People have explanation for everything! No explanation is needed.

770
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:51,297
Whom are you explaining? You are explaining to yourself,

771
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:54,975
you are judging yourself. You have to judge yourself,

772
00:55:55,095 --> 00:55:58,462
[to] whom are you explaining? Mataji?

773
00:55:58,702 --> 00:56:01,171
She doesn’t need any explanation.

774
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:05,189
I know, perhaps, everything, perhaps.

775
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:07,863
But I don’t condemn you and in any way

776
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:11,020
I do not want that you should be condemned by any chance at all,

777
00:56:11,141 --> 00:56:13,181
why should I? You are all saints after all.

778
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:17,069
For me it’s the greatest satisfaction.

779
00:56:17,189 --> 00:56:22,915
But for your own growth I want you to understand

780
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:25,975
that you are saints and you have to come up to that point.

781
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:29,220
Saints have to be self-disciplined, nobody has to tell them.

782
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,785
Discipline yourself,

783
00:56:33,285 --> 00:56:36,410
tell yourself, “I am a saint now.”

784
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:41,406
What an opportunity it is to grow! What an opportunity!

785
00:56:41,977 --> 00:56:44,449
And people are only going to believe in you

786
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:50,685
when you are really the saint within and saint without.

787
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,832
In Sahaja Yoga, people become saints within

788
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,757
and not saints without easily.

789
00:56:55,877 --> 00:56:58,877
But in other systems they are first made outside, you see,

790
00:56:58,997 --> 00:57:04,301
they are made to work for 25 years just washing the temple – finished!

791
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,713
Then they are made to do something else for 25 years.

792
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:10,236
By the time they are about to [be] dead they’ll say,

793
00:57:10,357 --> 00:57:14,470
“Alright, next time we’ll give you realisation.”

794
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:20,428
It’s like that. But here, from inside you have really achieved

795
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:25,896
your realisation no doubt, and you have greater chances of improving.

796
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:28,264
This is what I thought, that,

797
00:57:28,384 --> 00:57:31,648
“This lifetime I am just going to give realisation

798
00:57:31,768 --> 00:57:35,295
to all the people who come to me – let’s see.”

799
00:57:35,477 --> 00:57:41,844
And you are going to do full justice to my bold step

800
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:48,388
because now you’ve got it. It is going to work out much faster.

801
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:49,721
It has to work out.

802
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:54,176
This was the only way it could have worked out faster than to make you,

803
00:57:54,296 --> 00:58:00,400
first of all, wash yourself every day, get up at 4 o’clock and make you

804
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:07,902
like military people . I said, “No, let’s try this way.”

805
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:12,733
And it’s done, it’s happening, it’s so simple.

806
00:58:13,162 --> 00:58:16,308
Then the self-discipline must start.

807
00:58:16,982 --> 00:58:19,470
And you must try to improve your light,

808
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,369
which is just kindled,

809
00:58:21,489 --> 00:58:27,080
to make it a beautiful light, clean light and generous,

810
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,315
giving light, the light of love.

811
00:58:32,053 --> 00:58:34,377
It will work out I am sure.

812
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:39,506
Keep your standards high. Do not fall down.

813
00:58:40,085 --> 00:58:43,154
Put your attention into proper gear.

814
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,167
It’s all prophesised, as you know. Blake has prophesised it.

815
00:58:48,287 --> 00:58:51,622
The more I read the book the more I am convinced

816
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:54,906
that England is going to be the Jerusalem.

817
00:58:55,026 --> 00:59:00,242
Now think of that. No lethargy allowed.

818
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:06,163
While I find Australians are coming up much faster.

819
00:59:07,012 --> 00:59:11,262
You have to prove Blake’s prophesy.

820
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:14,892
May God bless you. All of you.

821
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:20,360
Cooly, can you give me some water please?

822
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:24,562
Look at the children!!

823
00:59:25,689 --> 00:59:28,631
All quiet! Thank you very much.

824
00:59:37,623 --> 00:59:43,286
If you could arrange a seminar Gavin, anytime,

825
00:59:43,406 --> 00:59:48,072
for three days, I can postpone my going to India.

826
00:59:48,192 --> 00:59:50,610
As I would like to have a seminar sometime.

827
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:55,168
Gavin: We can get a place in Sussex, from the,

828
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:58,681
I think it’s the twelfth, no the eleventh, to the thirteenth,

829
00:59:58,801 --> 01:00:04,239
that’s a mid-week time. We can have about 45-50 people.

830
01:00:05,174 --> 01:00:06,623
Shri Mataji: We have many more.

831
01:00:09,584 --> 01:00:12,415
I would like to have it on a Saturday Sunday somewhere.

832
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:13,841
Gavin: We can find somewhere

833
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:16,682
but it is difficult to get these places for a weekend.

834
01:00:16,802 --> 01:00:18,643
We’re still trying.

835
01:00:19,104 --> 01:00:25,247
Shri Mataji: I think in a, any place, like Brighton or something

836
01:00:25,367 --> 01:00:30,113
you might get it, or why not hire a boat?

837
01:00:39,627 --> 01:00:41,364
Isn’t it a good idea?

838
01:00:41,484 --> 01:00:44,397
Gavin: We can see what we can do.

839
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,574
Actually I was looking out for a ship.

840
01:00:48,695 --> 01:00:51,117
If one of the Shipping Corporation ships had arrived,

841
01:00:51,237 --> 01:00:54,092
I thought we’ll go and stay in a ship, would be a good idea,

842
01:00:54,213 --> 01:00:57,425
because it always is there for about three four days.

843
01:00:57,545 --> 01:01:00,745
But there’s no ship arriving in this month

844
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,590
otherwise, we could have done it.

845
01:01:04,805 --> 01:01:07,233
Some sort of a boat for two days you can hire,

846
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:11,590
a big boat where all of us could be there on a Saturday Sunday.

847
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,501
We should be there, it’s important.

848
01:01:13,621 --> 01:01:18,274
Before I leave I would like to fix some certain screws.

849
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:25,527
I mean, you can have it on Thames River if you want.

850
01:01:25,647 --> 01:01:31,612
Or Brighton, do you have boats or things? No? Just find out.

851
01:01:32,747 --> 01:01:34,392
So that should be resolved

852
01:01:34,512 --> 01:01:36,721
and then I will arrange my going accordingly.

853
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:40,127
If there is any program like that I will postpone it.

854
01:01:40,247 --> 01:01:43,775
But I would like to know as soon as possible.

855
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:56,431
As I have told you before that Sahaja Yoga has no technique;

856
01:01:56,551 --> 01:02:00,826
it’s a spontaneous happening which takes place.

857
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:10,088
Now the flower becomes the fruit, it has no technique,

858
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:14,554
but the sun has to come to do the job, you see,

859
01:02:14,674 --> 01:02:18,446
and that technique is beyond our understanding.

860
01:02:18,566 --> 01:02:23,507
In the same way it happens – just transformation.

861
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:28,545
But later on you must know how to maintain

862
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:30,476
and how to keep it up, that’s all.

863
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:33,116
Once it is managed it can be worked out.

864
01:02:33,236 --> 01:02:38,366
Many people have done it, and you should be able to do it also.

865
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:42,642
But try not to see others. See yourself first.

866
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:47,089
That’s very important. That is a very important part.

867
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:48,135
CLERCK

868
01:02:48,255 --> 01:02:52,012
If you can put your hands towards me, like this just,

869
01:02:53,662 --> 01:02:57,262
and close your eyes, just close your eyes.

870
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:09,950
If your hands are shaking or your body is shaking

871
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:14,526
or your eyes are fluttering, I mean the eyelids,

872
01:03:14,646 --> 01:03:18,331
then you open your eyes and just watch me,

873
01:03:19,274 --> 01:03:21,935
just watch me on my forehead.

874
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:29,774
Have you been to some guru or someone? No one?

875
01:03:29,894 --> 01:03:32,959
What do you do for your work?

876
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,382
Seeker: I’m a clerk.

877
01:03:36,502 --> 01:03:39,195
Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s it.

878
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:43,573
Ah, the right side is too much used.

879
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:46,925
Should work out. Are

880
01:03:51,648 --> 01:03:53,404
you shaking also?

881
01:03:54,022 --> 01:03:57,709
No? You are getting cool breeze? It’s great.

882
01:03:58,224 --> 01:04:05,596
Are you getting? Not yet. None of the fingers? Which one?

883
01:04:05,747 --> 01:04:11,479
Did you go to any guru or anyone? Did you to anyone? Guru or anyone?

884
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,523
To spiritualist or anyone? No?

885
01:04:22,521 --> 01:04:26,152
Are you getting cool breeze? Good.

886
01:04:29,084 --> 01:04:34,709
Put both the feet straight. Relax. You are getting? Good.

887
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,896
Close your eyes and enjoy your Self.

888
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:45,177
Better now. Just do it like that, you see.

889
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:47,638
It’s more on the right side, is a problem.

890
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:50,956
It’s because too much thinking, thinking, you know.

891
01:04:51,076 --> 01:04:56,962
So the imbalance of…too much thinking also gives an imbalance, you see.

892
01:04:57,082 --> 01:04:59,806
All the time you’re thinking, thinking, thinking.

893
01:04:59,926 --> 01:05:03,755
That gives you a trouble. It should work out.

894
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:08,908
See, put your left hand on the stomach, the centre, yes.

895
01:05:09,028 --> 01:05:13,562
Put your right hand now towards me, like this.

896
01:05:13,682 --> 01:05:16,554
Now the shaking will be less.

897
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:21,837
Put it there so you will be comfortable.

898
01:05:21,957 --> 01:05:24,651
It will reduce gradually.

899
01:05:24,771 --> 01:05:25,484
1’05’30

900
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:30,543
You See? This is nothing but there’s nervousness inside,

901
01:05:30,663 --> 01:05:32,061
which has to go out.

902
01:05:32,181 --> 01:05:37,253
You see the nerves have been too much tortured by thinking.

903
01:05:40,173 --> 01:05:43,505
Now it’s better, soothing down.

904
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:46,388
Much better, see?

905
01:05:46,508 --> 01:05:48,524
It will soothe down.

906
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:49,293
END CLERCK

907
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:52,625
Anne, there are some new people I see on the left hand side.

908
01:05:52,745 --> 01:05:55,541
Just see them, if they are realised, all of them.

909
01:05:55,661 --> 01:06:00,259
Just see some of these people who are there.

910
01:06:02,178 --> 01:06:07,560
Yah, just see. Have you got cool breeze there?

911
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:10,993
Have you got cool breeze in the hand?

912
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:17,669
What did you say? You have got it?

913
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:19,692
Seeker: YesShri Mataji: Good. Good.

914
01:06:19,812 --> 01:06:22,225
They are from Brighton are they?

915
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:26,191
Have you come from Brighton? No. Good.

916
01:06:26,311 --> 01:06:32,385
Jason, just see if they are getting cool breeze on the head also.

917
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,480
This side, are there new people?

918
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,042
You got the cool breeze?

919
01:06:41,162 --> 01:06:42,072
Seeker: Not sure

920
01:06:42,192 --> 01:06:45,949
Shri Mataji: All right, it comes so much that you’ll get sure of it,

921
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:51,263
all right? Just work it out.

922
01:06:54,608 --> 01:06:56,309
You can work out.

923
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:01,664
There also.

924
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:07,028
Peter, in front of you there, just see, someone.

925
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:11,127
Behind is there someone sitting?

926
01:07:11,247 --> 01:07:14,102
He’s come for the first time?

927
01:07:17,285 --> 01:07:20,844
How are you, Anna? Better?

928
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:26,382
She’s got it.

929
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:33,516
Better now? It’s better.

930
01:07:33,636 --> 01:07:36,971
Still there? Less, but much less.

931
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:41,064
Just do it like that.
Just throw it away. Throw it away.

932
01:07:41,184 --> 01:07:45,154
It has to go out. Now, let’s see.

933
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:49,730
Just imagine.

934
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:53,202
Throw it away again, it’s horrible.

935
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,126
Who’s there?
Left to the right, you just put him,

936
01:07:58,246 --> 01:08:00,877
left to the right for him. Come along. Good.

937
01:08:00,997 --> 01:08:06,708
Put it left to the right yes.
They will do it. You put your right hand, yes.

938
01:08:09,116 --> 01:08:13,820
Are you better now? Are you feeling any cool breeze?

939
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:24,288
How many years you have worked as a clerk?

940
01:08:24,408 --> 01:08:25,526
Clerk: Twelve.

941
01:08:31,962 --> 01:08:37,213
Shri Mataji: Look after his Vishuddhi
and centre heart. He’ll be all right.

942
01:08:37,396 --> 01:08:40,449
Yah! Vishuddhi and centre heart.

943
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:47,979
Terrific, they are terrific people.

944
01:08:51,484 --> 01:08:54,328
All right, is she all right?

945
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,417
What? Put your left hand here.

946
01:08:58,537 --> 01:09:01,589
All right? A little bit and put both the feet straight

947
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:05,888
like that on the ground would be better. Like this,

948
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,065
both the feet. Yes, let’s see.

949
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:11,826
She’s all right, I think, she’s got it.

950
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:20,902
 She’s all right. What about this gentleman? Left to the right.

951
01:09:22,731 --> 01:09:25,687
It’s nice you came to see me.

952
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:30,297
Really, because anything could have happened, you know,

953
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:34,816
with this kind of a tremendous pressure on your mind.

954
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,660
It’s still there. It will be.

955
01:09:41,663 --> 01:09:45,209
That’s how people get all these troubles, like diabetes, you see.

956
01:09:45,329 --> 01:09:48,957
Then even if they don’t listen to that then they could get heart.

957
01:09:49,077 --> 01:09:52,708
Then you get other problems on the left hand side, you see.

958
01:09:52,828 --> 01:09:55,228
Even paralysis can be due to this.

959
01:09:55,348 --> 01:10:00,162
It’s a very bad thing to work like that, worrying about it.

960
01:10:00,282 --> 01:10:01,980
Are you all right?

961
01:10:05,179 --> 01:10:07,217
It will work out. What is it, John?

962
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:08,495
John Watkinson: Nabhi.

963
01:10:08,615 --> 01:10:10,894
Shri Mataji: Nabhi? Nabhi.

964
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:15,749
Put your left hand on the stomach. Stomach, yes.

965
01:10:16,551 --> 01:10:18,345
What about him?

966
01:10:18,465 --> 01:10:20,418
Yogini: Left Nabhi

967
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:23,032
Shri Mataji: Are you married?Seeker: I’m not

968
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,027
You are not married?Seeker: No.

969
01:10:25,147 --> 01:10:29,659
Shri Mataji: You don’t want to marry?Seeker: I’m a widower.

970
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:32,395
Shri Mataji: When was that?

971
01:10:32,515 --> 01:10:34,235
Seeker: About eight years ago.
