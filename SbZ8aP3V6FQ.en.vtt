00:08:23.655 --> 00:08:30.547
Today’s auspicious occasion is being
celebrated everywhere in India.

00:08:30.748 --> 00:08:42.712
The reason is that the Sun which
has left us, has left India,

00:08:44.428 --> 00:08:52.770
and had moved towards the Tropic
of Capricorn, has now returned.

00:08:52.971 --> 00:09:03.789
And along with the movement
of the Earth and the Sun

00:09:04.234 --> 00:09:13.908
all the vegetation, all the crops,
fruit and others are growing.

00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:17.256
The time has come for their growth.

00:09:17.457 --> 00:09:26.440
And all those trees

00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:33.234
whose leaves were completely

00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:40.389
removed in the cold weather,

00:09:45.264 --> 00:09:49.176
appeared as if they have completely died,

00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:56.582
all those trees are again awakened
and started to become green.

00:09:56.783 --> 00:10:04.257
And that’s why, the significance
of this time

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:08.448
is that the Earth will again become
green,

00:10:08.649 --> 00:10:13.622
and activities will start again
everywhere.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:18.102
Especially in Northern India, where
it gets very cold,

00:10:18.303 --> 00:10:23.076
it is a very special festival, that
the sun has arrived

00:10:23.277 --> 00:10:29.917
and all the work dependent on the Sun
will be completely fulfilled now.

00:10:30.118 --> 00:10:37.750
So today I transmit best wishes
to everyone here.

00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:45.861
And on today’s auspicious occasion,
I could meet you all here.

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:50.154
This is also a great joy for Me, I feel.

00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:55.817
As we consider Sun's appearance
as a very great thing,

00:10:56.018 --> 00:11:04.468
it is much more important, that the Sun
of Sahaja Yoga comes on this Earth.

00:11:04.669 --> 00:11:13.113
Because whatever creativity is
in this Universe,

00:11:13.314 --> 00:11:17.825
the creativity is nourished by the Sun.

00:11:18.026 --> 00:11:28.378
The Sun gives it the energy, and the
creative power of the "Paramchaitanya",

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:33.756
its aspect of action, has got activated
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:33.957 --> 00:11:40.184
Till now Paramchaitanya was not
successful in any task.

00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:49.416
The reason was, that the Sun had not
yet appeared in its courtyard.

00:11:49.617 --> 00:11:55.415
But now this Sun has risen
in the courtyard of Paramchaitanya.

00:11:55.616 --> 00:12:01.517
And because of that you all have
the light of it within you.

00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:05.147
Because of that light, your Kundalini
has awakened,

00:12:05.348 --> 00:12:15.466
and within you, the field of creation
has fully blossomed.

00:12:15.667 --> 00:12:23.468
And this field of creation you all
are developing, in a way

00:12:23.669 --> 00:12:28.122
that the whole world can benefit from it.

00:12:28.323 --> 00:12:33.939
And it's a very great and divine thing.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:40.604
This could not take place earlier.
In our country many sages

00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:45.491
have expressed many ideas about
that such a day will come,

00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:50.368
when collectively this creation
will get awakened.

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:53.069
That creation has awakened now.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:59.561
And that’s why this is not only
an occasion for Earth's creation

00:12:59.762 --> 00:13:03.644
but a great occasion for Sahaja
Yoga's creation also.

00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:09.881
This year specially is considered to be
a very important year for Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:16.604
and the light of Sahaja Yoga will establish
very deeply in the people.

00:13:17.742 --> 00:13:24.516
When something starts to establish deeply,
then we must understand that along with it,

00:13:24.717 --> 00:13:28.520
some other important events also
take place.

00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:32.819
Like those who are evil and want
to destroy the world,

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:42.290
and those who are creating terror,
destroying the best things of the world,

00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:45.808
all such people are consequently destroyed.

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:54.456
As soon as saplings start blossoming
and if they carry truth within them,

00:13:54.657 --> 00:13:58.497
they will wreck havoc in the place
they cannot blossom

00:13:58.698 --> 00:14:00.809
and they will destroy everything.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:08.619
In the same way, all the evil temperaments,
all the devilish forces, will be destroyed.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:14.896
Like after the Sun appears, all the gloom,
all the darkness, is destroyed.

00:14:15.097 --> 00:14:19.803
Similarly when the light of Sahaja Yoga
emerges

00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:27.423
then the darkness of ignorance and
wickedness, is totally destroyed.

00:14:27.624 --> 00:14:34.059
So today we are at the brink where
we have to take a very high flight.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.466
And in this flight we have to understand

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:40.597
that we should give up all the burdens
within us.

00:14:40.798 --> 00:14:49.361
We have many types of beliefs, we have
many types of wrong faiths,

00:14:49.562 --> 00:14:53.333
and also there are all types of ignorance
within us.

00:14:53.534 --> 00:14:55.843
We should renounce all this ignorance

00:14:56.044 --> 00:15:00.515
and with a complete detachment, we should
take this flight.

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:05.336
And those who cannot detach from ignorance,

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:10.763
those who do not get rid of it, such people
will not be able to take this flight.

00:15:10.964 --> 00:15:14.521
All of you know the significance
and divinity of Sahaj Yoga;

00:15:14.722 --> 00:15:18.631
you are not ordinary people. And that’s
why I want to say that

00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:22.125
those who want to fly higher and want
to raise higher,

00:15:22.326 --> 00:15:30.332
should give up the burden of the many
shackles of traditions.

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:40.526
Similarly within us, ego and vanity
are like a very big mountain.

00:15:40.727 --> 00:15:44.617
We should destroy this mountain
completely too.

00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:48.280
And we can accomplish that, through
meditation,

00:15:48.451 --> 00:15:55.144
and by completely immersing in Sahaj Yoga,
by completely surrendering to it.

00:15:55.345 --> 00:16:01.921
The person who doesn’t surrender
to Sahaj Yoga, is still incomplete,

00:16:02.122 --> 00:16:05.399
and it's possible to be left behind
during this flight,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.722
to go to the same hell where
others are going.

00:16:09.923 --> 00:16:13.243
So it's important that everyone strives
thoroughly.

00:16:13.444 --> 00:16:22.163
All those who put efforts and try
half-heartedly,

00:16:22.364 --> 00:16:29.196
I want to tell them, "Please renounce
this half hearted effort".

00:16:29.397 --> 00:16:35.265
Because of this half hearted effort,
you cannot achieve anything.

00:16:35.466 --> 00:16:41.573
Then how can you achieve that great state

00:16:41.774 --> 00:16:47.293
for which people used to cleanse
by penance for thousands of years?

00:16:47.494 --> 00:16:52.560
There is no need to belittle or punish
yourself,

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.551
but we must understand that today
we are facing a mirror,

00:16:57.752 --> 00:17:03.627
and we have to completely remove
all the defects visible in us.

00:17:03.828 --> 00:17:06.251
When you observe yourself from outside

00:17:06.452 --> 00:17:10.541
then you will understand that you have
to destroy all these things.

00:17:10.742 --> 00:17:16.786
By this happening, you will notice that
you receive many blessings from God.

00:17:16.987 --> 00:17:18.883
And receiving those blessing

00:17:19.084 --> 00:17:24.317
human beings will think that,
"I have achieved everything".

00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:26.930
This is also a great fascination,

00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:31.221
that I have received this or that,
all the worldly things.

00:17:31.422 --> 00:17:35.646
And like this, when we want to get
something,

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:41.526
at the periphery of this there are some
things which can also mesmerize.

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:45.492
But we shouldn't stop there. We have
to achieve a great speed.

00:17:45.693 --> 00:17:47.829
This is the result of good deeds
of your many lives

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.155
and you have to achieve it completely.

00:17:50.356 --> 00:17:56.733
And we have to renounce those small,
petty desires within us,

00:17:56.934 --> 00:18:04.708
and become completely surrendered and
give full contribution to Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:07.053
Only the one who will do this,
will achieve it.

00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:11.717
The one who will not do it, because
of any reason, I can tell you openly,

00:18:11.918 --> 00:18:16.301
that there is not much place
in the kingdom of God.

00:18:16.502 --> 00:18:21.199
Those who want to go there, should think,
if they really want to reach there

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.119
that they have to get rid
of all the burdens.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.657
And we have to take just one path, our
full efforts should be in one direction,

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:36.315
that we should somehow march in this
direction and keep progressing.

00:18:36.516 --> 00:18:40.351
Every year you need to introspect

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:43.099
and see how much you have progresses
since last year.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.959
Are we making excuses and thinking

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.050
that "we have to do this", "this is
important, that is important",

00:18:49.251 --> 00:18:53.102
or from our heart we want to ascent?

00:18:53.303 --> 00:18:56.638
And many people also think that
through Sahaj Yoga,

00:18:56.839 --> 00:19:01.888
they will get rid of illness or will get
their problems solved,

00:19:02.089 --> 00:19:03.643
that this will happen, that will happen...

00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:06.498
They should know there is only
one solution for all the problems,

00:19:06.699 --> 00:19:10.724
that we should reach that state
which is absolute.

00:19:10.925 --> 00:19:16.732
Then all the things get solved by
themselves. You don't need to do anything.

00:19:17.494 --> 00:19:22.537
So today I have shared with you my opinion.

00:19:22.738 --> 00:19:26.034
But I want that you should also take
a resolution in your heart.

00:19:26.235 --> 00:19:29.703
What I am saying appears to be very simple,

00:19:29.904 --> 00:19:34.726
but the temperaments and activities
of human beings

00:19:34.927 --> 00:19:38.817
are so strange that I am also not able
to understand them.

00:19:39.018 --> 00:19:43.401
They say "If you can understand Him,
then how can He be God?"

00:19:43.602 --> 00:19:46.697
but I say "If you can understand him,
then how can he be human?"

00:19:46.898 --> 00:19:49.837
Because human beings are so complicated,
so complicated,

00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:52.450
that to understand them is very difficult.

00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:57.440
I request all of you that if you have
to achieve divinity,

00:19:57.604 --> 00:20:01.595
the complicated nature should be
completely reprimanded,

00:20:01.796 --> 00:20:03.039
and it should be renounced to.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.545
And you should say that you want
to achieve that divinity,

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:13.840
by which anything that you touch
gets nourished, vibrated and beautiful.

00:20:14.238 --> 00:20:17.087
Your life will also become very beautiful

00:20:17.288 --> 00:20:27.051
very ideal, very joy giving, full of love,
and of a very high level.

00:20:27.252 --> 00:20:31.112
Infinite blessings to all of you.

00:20:42.227 --> 00:20:46.896
Today is a day for us to celebrate
in India very much,

00:20:47.097 --> 00:20:49.733
and maybe also most of the Europe,

00:20:49.934 --> 00:21:03.469
because the Sun goes down to the,
to the Capricorn

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:10.651
and from Capricorn, it then comes
to Tropic of Cancer.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:14.227
When the Sun comes on this earth back,

00:21:14.428 --> 00:21:18.931
then all the creativity of the Mother Earth
starts acting

00:21:19.132 --> 00:21:24.762
and She creates such beautiful things
like flowers,

00:21:24.963 --> 00:21:31.960
such nice things, nourishing things like
fruits, and fulfilling things like foods.

00:21:32.161 --> 00:21:36.497
She makes our eyes cool down
with the greenery She has,

00:21:36.698 --> 00:21:47.192
and the way She blesses us is manifold
with the advent of the soil.

00:21:48.425 --> 00:21:54.834
In the same way, now, that the Sun
of Sahaj Yoga has risen,

00:21:55.035 --> 00:21:57.845
risen and it’s coming to the zenith...

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:05.919
And it has definitely shown you
the result on the

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:15.140
earth principle, that is your Mooladhara

00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:20.789
and the creative power of that Mooladhara
which is the Kundalini,

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:24.968
has been rising and rising and rising,

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:30.373
and opening your being, and showing
the results in your lives.

00:22:30.574 --> 00:22:34.193
It has made your lives very beautiful,

00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:38.562
it has made your life very joyous
and very happy.

00:22:38.763 --> 00:22:43.630
Now we are at a point where we have
to trigger a new jump,

00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:46.141
a new flight we have to take.

00:22:46.342 --> 00:22:50.443
And for this flight, we have to see
that we really become

00:22:50.644 --> 00:23:01.007
very light in our ideas, in our thoughts
and in our conditionings.

00:23:01.208 --> 00:23:05.979
We are so much full of conditionings.
All kinds of conditionings are on us.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.398
They are so deep that sometimes I fail
to understand human beings,

00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:13.385
I just don’t understand how they get stuck

00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:20.155
to things which are of no value, which
have no sense, and they get lost.

00:23:20.356 --> 00:23:26.685
In this higher jump that we are going
to take,

00:23:26.886 --> 00:23:33.224
many will be left behind as a result, those
who won’t be able to come out of that.

00:23:33.425 --> 00:23:38.157
So at this stage, I have to request you
that you should really, fully

00:23:38.358 --> 00:23:44.140
dedicate yourself to meditation and
surrender yourself to collectivity.

00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:46.409
And every day you must think,
in the evening,

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.194
“What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?
What have I done for myself?"

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:55.169
Please try to understand that there
is a very big jump we have to take.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.863
It is to be triggered and for that,
I would like you to be ready,

00:24:00.064 --> 00:24:05.035
to be absolutely prepared because
in this jump many might be lost,

00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:08.260
and many might be just left behind,

00:24:08.516 --> 00:24:14.184
because they could not get over
their conditionings.

00:24:14.385 --> 00:24:19.787
The conditionings are of various types,
as you know very well,

00:24:19.988 --> 00:24:28.882
of ignorance, blind faith, and all other
things that we have gone through.

00:24:29.083 --> 00:24:36.097
Also, we have conditionings of our country,
of our race, of our styles

00:24:36.298 --> 00:24:39.713
and so many other things, by which
we judge others.

00:24:39.914 --> 00:24:44.296
But we have to judge ourselves, that
"Are we in a Sahaj culture or not?"

00:24:44.497 --> 00:24:48.356
If you are not in the Sahaj culture,
then it’s going to be very difficult

00:24:48.557 --> 00:24:52.035
that you’ll board the ship, which is
going to take us off.

00:24:52.236 --> 00:24:56.240
I have to just warn you, that later on,
you shouldn’t say

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.130
that: “Mother, so many were left behind”.
If you find anybody is left behind,

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.302
please try to help that person.
Please try to correct that person,

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:12.048
and with clear ideas, and with clear voice,
and with clear-cut instructions.

00:25:12.249 --> 00:25:16.973
If you really find that somebody
is going down, you’d better warn.

00:25:17.174 --> 00:25:20.620
I am telling you all today because
you all will be departing,

00:25:20.792 --> 00:25:23.659
that you should look after your fellowmen
Sahaja Yogis,

00:25:23.827 --> 00:25:27.770
and tell them that this is a very
crucial time,

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:34.762
and at this time, none of us should just
take for granted Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:34.963 --> 00:25:40.562
All other things are just a kind
of an illusion,

00:25:40.763 --> 00:25:45.972
that you feel that the worldly things
are all right,

00:25:46.173 --> 00:25:50.660
or with the worldly things you can manage.
God doesn’t care for people who are rich,

00:25:50.861 --> 00:25:53.759
or people who are well-off, or people
who are poor.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.628
What He sees, what richness you have got
of spirituality.

00:25:58.829 --> 00:26:02.529
He doesn’t bother about your education,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.153
of your degrees, of your pompousness,
nothing of the kind.

00:26:06.354 --> 00:26:11.460
What He sees, how innocent you are, and
how much you have worked for Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:11.725 --> 00:26:16.209
what you have done for God’s work.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.690
So all these priorities have to be changed,

00:26:19.891 --> 00:26:24.387
and one must understand that Sahaja Yoga
judges you on a very subtle level.

00:26:24.588 --> 00:26:29.344
So in this Last Judgment, now, as many
people have been judged

00:26:29.545 --> 00:26:32.880
as good people, very nice people,

00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:36.756
but still, for the second jump that
you are going to have,

00:26:36.957 --> 00:26:40.483
we have to be very careful, that maybe
some of you

00:26:40.684 --> 00:26:45.710
who think in their heart they are Sahaja
yogis, but are not, may be left behind.

00:26:45.911 --> 00:26:51.646
So it is important that the Sun has risen
and now it has gone to the zenith.

00:26:51.847 --> 00:26:58.122
And at the time of its zenith, one has
to be very careful because the same Sun,

00:26:58.323 --> 00:27:05.977
which has started making this beautiful
greenery all around us,

00:27:06.178 --> 00:27:13.709
may scorch with its heat many of them.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:20.930
So be careful. And one has to be all the
time under the guidance of Sahaja Yoga

00:27:21.131 --> 00:27:25.530
to understand what is wrong with us,
what is making us so heavy,

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:30.200
what is making us so difficult.

00:27:30.401 --> 00:27:36.945
So far I am very happy that whatever
I have been telling you

00:27:37.146 --> 00:27:43.019
and whatever I have been guiding you, you
have accepted it very calmly and sweetly,

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:47.275
and that you have tried to imbibe it
in your lifestyle.

00:27:47.476 --> 00:27:51.668
Actually, after some time, I don’t think
I’ll have to tell you anything.

00:27:51.869 --> 00:27:57.533
You will get your own light, to see for
yourself what is right and what is wrong.

00:27:57.734 --> 00:28:01.760
But still, I would say, for all the Western
people specially,

00:28:01.961 --> 00:28:06.708
that you must open your heart in the Puja,
in the music, in anything,

00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:10.944
just see that you open your heart.
If you cannot open your heart,

00:28:11.145 --> 00:28:15.440
this won’t work because this works through
Spirit, which resides in your heart.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.000
So please try to open your heart for
everything all your conditionings,

00:28:20.201 --> 00:28:22.889
all your ego will disappear when you decide

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.187
that, “I have to open my heart
to Sahaja Yoga”.

00:28:27.388 --> 00:28:30.070
May God bless you all.
