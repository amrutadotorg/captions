WEBVTT

00:03.722 --> 00:10.143
And in Navratri you know that the puja

00:10.167 --> 00:14.819
should be performed in the night.

00:14.843 --> 00:24.337
To dispel the darkness, it is very important

00:24.361 --> 00:29.944
that we bring light in the night itself.

00:29.968 --> 00:35.556
Today, there is also another coincidence

00:35.581 --> 00:53.286
that you are celebrating My birthday.

00:53.310 --> 01:08.334
On this day, Gauriji established Shri Ganesha after her marriage.

01:08.358 --> 01:17.617
Shri Ganesha is the source of purity, of purity.

01:17.641 --> 01:24.116
The first thing established in this world was purity .

01:24.243 --> 01:30.558
So that, whatever living beings, the human beings

01:30.583 --> 01:34.736
all those who came into this world

01:34.760 --> 01:40.644
should be protected by purity.

01:40.668 --> 01:47.213
and be away from impure things.

01:47.238 --> 01:59.541
That is why, the whole creation was drenched with purity by Gauri ji.

01:59.566 --> 02:04.494
And after that the creation came into existence.

02:04.518 --> 02:09.703
So in our lives, the most important work is that

02:09.728 --> 02:16.252
that within ourselves, we should place purity at the highest level.

02:16.276 --> 02:25.655
But purity does not mean

02:25.680 --> 02:29.137
that we take our bath, wash ourselves

02:29.162 --> 02:34.423
clean up,  keep our body alright

02:34.447 --> 02:40.006
but to clean our hearts.

02:40.031 --> 02:45.540
The biggest disorder of the heart is anger.

02:45.564 --> 02:50.124
Anger is the highest disorder of heart.

02:50.148 --> 02:55.093
And when a man gets angry

02:55.117 --> 03:04.930
that which is purity gets destroyed.

03:04.954 --> 03:12.871
Because another name of purity is selfless love.

03:12.895 --> 03:21.985
That love which always flows and does not expect anything.

03:22.010 --> 03:27.409
The satisfaction of this love is that it is just flowing.

03:27.433 --> 03:35.197
And when it does not flow, it gets suffocated and disturbed.

03:35.221 --> 03:44.543
So, purity means that you fill your heart with love, not with anger.

03:44.567 --> 03:49.883
Anger is in any case our enemy

03:49.907 --> 04:00.956
but, it is the enemy of the whole world.

04:00.980 --> 04:04.756
All the wars that have taken place in the whole world

04:04.780 --> 04:06.974
all the losses that have taken place

04:06.999 --> 04:13.609
have been because of collective anger.

04:13.633 --> 04:16.445
There are many excuses for anger.

04:16.502 --> 04:19.787
I got angry because this thing had happened.

04:19.812 --> 04:23.131
I got angry because that thing had happened.

04:23.155 --> 04:28.277
Man can always find some reason to get angry.

04:28.301 --> 04:36.888
But even extremely destructive things like war are there because of this anger.

04:36.912 --> 04:41.623
The basic reason behind that is anger.

04:41.647 --> 04:50.354
If our heart is full of love, we cannot get angry.

04:50.378 --> 04:59.798
And even if anger is shown off, that too will be for love only.

04:59.822 --> 05:04.666
Even when an evil ‘Rakshasa’ (devil) is destroyed

05:04.690 --> 05:09.526
that is also done out of Love

05:09.550 --> 05:13.706
because he deserves to be killed

05:13.730 --> 05:16.842
so that he does not commit any more sins.

05:16.866 --> 05:19.713
But this is not the work of human beings.

05:19.737 --> 05:24.751
This is the work of Devi, which She has done during Navaratris.

05:24.775 --> 05:28.813
So, expand your heart and see in your heart

05:28.837 --> 05:36.260
whom do we offer such love which is selfless love

05:36.285 --> 05:38.043
for whom we do not feel that

05:38.068 --> 05:45.245
this is my son, this is my sister, my house, my things.

05:45.269 --> 05:49.547
Whom do we love like that?

05:49.571 --> 05:55.233
For whom do we have such love?

05:55.257 --> 06:01.095
You have reached a much higher state than that of a human being.

06:01.119 --> 06:03.794
Because you are a Sahajyogi.

06:03.819 --> 06:11.788
You are connected to this subtle power of love, of God Almighty.

06:11.812 --> 06:15.160
And this power is flowing continuously within you

06:15.184 --> 06:23.558
is nourishing you, is protecting you and is elevating you.

06:23.582 --> 06:29.380
Repeatedly, it motivates you, protects you

06:29.404 --> 06:38.919
gives you pure joy and enriches you with sweet love.

06:38.944 --> 06:46.955
You have been united with this beautiful power

06:46.980 --> 06:54.615
but how much place do we have in our heart for such kind of power

06:54.822 --> 06:58.790
has to be seen.

06:58.814 --> 07:08.610
In our heart we have love for our Mother, that is true.

07:08.634 --> 07:13.017
All of you, love your Mother

07:13.041 --> 07:22.938
and because of this love you are tuned, you are in tune with the joy.

07:22.962 --> 07:27.752
But we should have two more types of love within us.

07:27.776 --> 07:33.155
Only then, we can say that you love your Mother.

07:33.179 --> 07:37.153
Firstly, we should love ourselves

07:37.177 --> 07:45.134
that we are Sahajayogis. We got this power very easily.

07:45.158 --> 07:51.306
But now, how should we  grow (spiritually)?

07:51.330 --> 08:01.367
Many people work very hard to spread Sahaja yoga

08:01.391 --> 08:08.194
which we can call the horizontal movement.

08:08.218 --> 08:12.291
It is like spreading from earth, in all the directions.

08:12.316 --> 08:14.978
They do not put attention on themselves.

08:15.003 --> 08:18.248
Thus the vertical movement

08:18.273 --> 08:23.619
They did not achieve their spiritual growth.

08:23.643 --> 08:29.073
They can do a lot of things outside, they can run about

08:29.098 --> 08:35.503
outside they can do work, get things done, meet everybody.

08:35.528 --> 08:39.630
But cannot develop their inner power.

08:39.655 --> 08:43.733
Many people put a lot of attention towards their inner power

08:43.757 --> 08:46.657
and do not put attention towards outside.

08:46.681 --> 08:50.067
So, they do not get balance.

08:50.092 --> 08:54.716
And when people put attention on the outside only

08:54.740 --> 08:58.740
their inner power becomes less and less.

08:58.764 --> 09:01.294
And while becoming so less and less

09:01.318 --> 09:07.097
they go to the brink and in no time, start falling into the ego trip.

09:07.122 --> 09:12.684
They think how much we have worked for Sahajayoga.

09:12.709 --> 09:17.496
How much we work hard for Sahajyoga!

09:17.560 --> 09:24.928
And then a new life starts of such people

09:24.952 --> 09:28.001
which is not at all useful for Sahajayoga.

09:28.025 --> 09:32.928
They start thinking about themselves that, i am a very great leader

09:32.953 --> 09:38.048
and everybody should give us lot of importance

09:38.073 --> 09:41.727
which is called self-importance.

09:41.751 --> 09:47.115
So, everywhere they see that they should be given importance.

09:47.139 --> 09:51.712
In everything they will try to show their own importance

09:51.736 --> 09:56.344
show their own specialty, always come in the front

09:56.368 --> 10:04.040
but from inside there is a hollowness.

10:04.218 --> 10:06.330
And then suddenly we see that

10:06.354 --> 10:12.959
that they are suffering from some kind of a sickness

10:12.983 --> 10:15.031
have become mad.

10:15.055 --> 10:18.823
They have some big problem in their life.

10:18.847 --> 10:20.225
Then they start saying

10:20.249 --> 10:24.405
Mother, "We had completely surrendered to You

10:24.429 --> 10:31.607
so how did this happen?"

10:31.631 --> 10:34.126
How did we get it?

10:34.151 --> 10:39.150
How did this go wrong?

10:39.174 --> 10:43.940
Its responsibility lies on you only.

10:43.964 --> 10:47.302
You got mesmerized.

10:47.326 --> 10:52.946
Such people go one sided.

10:52.970 --> 10:56.522
They cannot get along with other people.

10:56.546 --> 11:00.768
Their only connection is how much they can dominate others.

11:00.792 --> 11:06.933
And how can  they show that they are superior people.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.531
Then they go on showing their own importance.

11:10.555 --> 11:15.469
They should be included in everything and always given importance.

11:15.493 --> 11:19.351
If someone does not give him any importance then it is a great mistake.

11:19.375 --> 11:22.310
Then they start faltering to such an extent

11:22.335 --> 11:30.298
that they will even forget that they have to do something for Mother

11:30.323 --> 11:33.944
that you have to donate something for Mother also.

11:33.968 --> 11:40.259
Like this, I see that in some places like Rahuri, in Bombay

11:40.284 --> 11:46.082
everywhere some people suddenly come up

11:46.106 --> 11:49.029
and think that they were very important.

11:49.053 --> 11:55.544
And in such places, neither there would be Aarti

11:55.569 --> 11:58.376
and luckily for Me there would be at least My photo.

11:58.401 --> 12:02.745
but nobody had even a desire to clean the photo.

12:02.770 --> 12:06.412
Thank God, they did not put their own photo!

12:06.436 --> 12:12.360
Their own importance and their own show off!

12:12.432 --> 12:16.432
And by showing off, thinking of themselves superior

12:16.457 --> 12:17.810
different from others.

12:17.835 --> 12:22.073
Not asking anybody anything, nothing. We will do.

12:22.097 --> 12:24.177
Then the quarrels started.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.360
After the quarells started, groups formed.

12:27.384 --> 12:31.300
Because, the bond that binds you all together

12:31.324 --> 12:34.667
is the thread of your Mother.

12:34.692 --> 12:37.368
And if you remain in that bond

12:37.392 --> 12:39.841
and know all the time

12:39.866 --> 12:42.644
that we are the children of the same Mother

12:42.668 --> 12:45.685
and that nobody is higher or lower.

12:45.710 --> 12:48.237
Neither, we do any work

12:48.261 --> 12:53.309
this Chaitanya (the All-Pervading power of God) is doing everything.

12:53.333 --> 12:56.655
We don't do anything at all.

12:56.679 --> 12:59.028
When this feeling itself is over

12:59.052 --> 13:01.814
that i am so great, i have done this

13:01.839 --> 13:08.823
i did this and will do this and i will do that

13:08.847 --> 13:16.034
then chaitanya says," Ok do whatever you want to do

13:16.058 --> 13:17.959
go wherever you want to go."

13:17.983 --> 13:21.161
Have you to go to hell? Go!

13:21.185 --> 13:24.775
If you want to destroy yourself, you can destroy yourself.

13:24.815 --> 13:27.443
If you want to do your complete destruction that also you do.

13:27.468 --> 13:31.799
Whatever you want to do, you do.

13:31.824 --> 13:38.944
It will not stop you because it respects your freedom.

13:38.968 --> 13:42.934
If you want to go to heaven there is arrangement for that

13:42.959 --> 13:46.474
and if you want to go to hell there is arrangement for that too.

13:46.617 --> 13:51.085
But in Sahaja Yoga there is one more big drawback

13:51.109 --> 13:54.448
one very big drawback.

13:54.472 --> 14:00.141
We are a big Virat Shakti (collective power)

14:00.165 --> 14:07.707
We are not alone, we are part and parcel of the same body.

14:07.731 --> 14:11.114
But in that (body) if one person gets like this

14:11.139 --> 14:13.859
or two or four persons become like that

14:13.883 --> 14:15.877
who start making their own group

14:15.902 --> 14:20.942
then like cancer malignancy, that only one cell starts growing

14:20.966 --> 14:27.400
then that person can grow and can contaminate whole Sahajayoga.

14:27.424 --> 14:34.996
And all My efforts can be in vain.

14:35.021 --> 14:38.379
We should learn from sea

14:38.403 --> 14:41.968
which stays at the lowest level

14:41.993 --> 14:51.561
and absorbs all the rivers inside itself.

14:51.585 --> 14:56.001
And without sea the world cannot exist

14:56.025 --> 15:01.608
and by evaporating itself, by making steam

15:01.633 --> 15:06.518
gives the gift of monsoon to the whole world.

15:06.542 --> 15:17.504
Its humility is a sign of its depth, but this humility is not superficial

15:17.528 --> 15:20.436
that we say hello Mister, Bhaisahab namaste, nothing like this.

15:20.460 --> 15:23.520
It remains at the lowest level

15:23.545 --> 15:27.149
it absorbs everything, purifying everything

15:27.228 --> 15:32.084
and then it converts itself into steam and showers the rain.

15:32.108 --> 15:36.062
And then the same rain pouring down into the rivers

15:36.086 --> 15:41.991
comes running towards the same sea.

15:42.015 --> 15:44.397
And the recognition of this sea

15:44.421 --> 15:50.317
if you go to the shore of any sea you will observe that there

15:50.529 --> 15:56.332
all the coconut trees, which are there, are always bent towards the sea.

15:56.357 --> 16:00.117
There is a lot of breeze

16:00.141 --> 16:02.066
come what may

16:02.090 --> 16:08.036
but they never turn away from the sea

16:08.061 --> 16:11.352
because they know that it is sea.

16:11.376 --> 16:16.010
So, like the sea only, our heart will become vast only when

16:16.089 --> 16:21.775
when we we will have extremely humbleness and love in our heart.

16:21.799 --> 16:26.563
But giving self-importance only, feeling always that we are something special

16:26.587 --> 16:31.408
in that case, the greatest disadvantage is

16:31.433 --> 16:33.784
that Paramchaitanya will cut you off. It will say, "Go away".

16:33.808 --> 16:35.871
if you want to make yourself important, 'Go away'!

16:35.896 --> 16:39.960
And then it cuts you off, just like a nail is cut and thrown.

16:39.985 --> 16:43.733
in the same way, you will be thrown away on one side.

16:43.757 --> 16:47.466
which is very painful for me.

16:47.490 --> 16:51.818
So when such 3-4 people start thinking that they are doing a lot of work

16:51.842 --> 16:55.475
we have done this, we have done that

16:55.499 --> 16:57.281
they should immeditely cool down

16:57.305 --> 16:59.428
step back and introspect themselves

16:59.453 --> 17:06.839
''Do we meditate? Do we go into meditation? How deep we are?"

17:06.863 --> 17:13.230
And then whom do we love?

17:13.254 --> 17:15.278
Who are the ones whom we love?

17:15.302 --> 17:22.629
How many people do we love and with how many we have enemity?

17:22.653 --> 17:26.295
In Sahajayoga some people have gone very deep

17:26.319 --> 17:29.960
very deep indeed, there is no doubt about it.

17:29.984 --> 17:34.461
But there are many who are still on the peripherry

17:34.485 --> 17:37.277
and can't say when these people will be thrown out.

17:37.301 --> 17:42.474
Because, I have already told you that, after the year 1990

17:42.498 --> 17:51.283
that a new dimension is going to begin

17:51.307 --> 17:58.585
and you will have to take a jump

17:58.610 --> 18:10.360
to get down from this state, to settle down in that new dimension.

18:10.385 --> 18:12.914
Like a wheel when it moves

18:12.938 --> 18:19.947
on reaching a point, it moves forward.

18:20.003 --> 18:26.482
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is also going to progress collectively.

18:26.507 --> 18:28.997
And to stay in this dimension

18:29.022 --> 18:33.522
the very first thing needed within us is purity

18:33.547 --> 18:36.856
filled with humility.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.374
You have seen people in this world

18:40.399 --> 18:42.507
who think that they are very pure

18:42.531 --> 18:45.002
and morning, evening they will do their prayers

18:45.027 --> 18:47.600
they will not allow anybody to touch them.

18:47.625 --> 18:48.950
We will not eat this.

18:48.974 --> 18:51.176
If he comes they will say,"ok you sit far away".

18:51.201 --> 18:55.131
If anyone touches them, they will be terribly angry.

18:55.156 --> 18:56.814
This madness

18:56.838 --> 19:04.646
if you are absolutely clean, absolutely pure

19:04.670 --> 19:10.779
then by touching anybody, by talking to anybody

19:10.826 --> 19:13.650
did you ever become impure?

19:13.711 --> 19:16.113
Because you purify everything

19:16.137 --> 19:19.121
it is your nature to purify everything

19:19.145 --> 19:23.470
So whosoever you meet you will purify that person.

19:23.494 --> 19:26.939
What is there to be afraid of?

19:26.963 --> 19:30.816
Why should you condemn  anyone?

19:30.840 --> 19:34.037
Why should you gossip about others?

19:34.117 --> 19:41.157
This is just one sign that your own purity is lacking.

19:41.181 --> 19:44.923
If your purity is complete

19:44.948 --> 19:48.153
then in that purity there is the power and brightness.

19:48.177 --> 19:58.623
It is so powerful that it can absorb any impurity.

19:58.647 --> 20:04.308
As I told you, all the dirt in the sea

20:04.332 --> 20:09.048
gets completely one with the sea.

20:09.072 --> 20:11.371
The second type of people are those

20:11.396 --> 20:16.684
who think only of their own progress.

20:16.708 --> 20:20.566
They think that they have nothing to do with others.

20:20.590 --> 20:26.077
We sit in our house, do Mother's puja, do Her arti.

20:26.102 --> 20:29.998
We recognize Her and we want our progress.

20:30.023 --> 20:36.187
We have nothing to do with the world

20:36.298 --> 20:39.571
and want to be separated from others.

20:39.595 --> 20:44.630
Such people cannot progress

20:44.654 --> 20:48.281
because you are a part and parcel of the same body.

20:48.305 --> 20:51.103
Imagine if a finger ties itself (with a thread)

20:51.128 --> 20:53.839
and will say that it has nothing to do with anything else

20:53.864 --> 20:57.661
and say that “I will stay alone”. It will die

20:57.685 --> 21:00.214
because from where will it get blood?

21:00.238 --> 21:03.262
How can the veins function in this?

21:03.286 --> 21:07.566
How will it transmit consciousness?

21:07.590 --> 21:11.784
It will remain separated, it will remain neglected.

21:11.808 --> 21:16.048
You can try it by tieing a finger

21:16.073 --> 21:18.022
and keep it tied for 5 days

21:18.047 --> 21:22.710
after that you will see that this finger will not work at all.

21:22.735 --> 21:26.275
it will be totally useless.

21:26.299 --> 21:30.401
Then you will say, "Mother, I do so much puja

21:30.426 --> 21:34.579
i recite such a lot of mantras, i work a lot for Sahaja Yoga

21:34.604 --> 21:37.386
then why it has so happened?"

21:37.410 --> 21:40.658
Because you are separated, you have moved away.

21:40.682 --> 21:44.314
You have moved away from that Samuhik Shakti (collective power).

21:44.339 --> 21:47.643
Sahajayoga is a collective power.

21:47.667 --> 21:51.276
So, when you go away from this collectivity

21:51.300 --> 21:59.659
there only you got separated from the power of collectivity.

21:59.683 --> 22:02.945
So we have to take care of both the things

22:02.969 --> 22:11.767
to take care of one’s own power and also be collective.

22:11.791 --> 22:16.738
Only then you will get the complete balanced state.

22:16.818 --> 22:21.272
But outside you do a lot of work.

22:21.296 --> 22:26.455
I have seen some people who have done  a lot of work for Sahajyoga

22:26.479 --> 22:34.010
and used to give very good speeches, they would talk well.

22:34.035 --> 22:36.403
Then, they made audio recordings of their speeches

22:36.428 --> 22:39.980
and started telling people that you should hear our tapes.

22:40.004 --> 22:48.995
And the people started listening to their tapes instead of My tapes.

22:49.019 --> 22:52.180
So much so that, for example that I am sitting here

22:52.205 --> 22:56.483
they will come and do Namaskar to the photo but not to Me !

22:56.507 --> 23:02.610
Because they were used to bowing to the photo.

23:02.634 --> 23:04.436
They had nothing to do with Me.

23:04.461 --> 23:07.968
They had every connection with the photo.

23:07.992 --> 23:10.852
Such kind of very strange people I have seen.

23:10.876 --> 23:13.858
Then they also got their own photo printed

23:13.883 --> 23:16.076
and were showing that photo to everybody.

23:16.100 --> 23:20.956
saying that i am like this, i am like that.

23:20.980 --> 23:23.914
So, in this way, in all the possible ways

23:23.939 --> 23:27.928
they show their own importance .

23:27.952 --> 23:30.482
and gradually they fell in such a big ditch.

23:30.507 --> 23:31.873
Suddenly!

23:31.898 --> 23:34.410
They did not even understand

23:34.435 --> 23:37.423
and fell apart from Sahajayoga.

23:37.447 --> 23:39.783
We do not see them anywhere.

23:39.807 --> 23:40.744
People started telling me

23:40.769 --> 23:43.792
" Mother they were great leaders, they were this, they were that".

23:43.817 --> 23:46.767
Yes, they were!

23:46.791 --> 23:51.014
But where did they go? They went. What can I do?

23:51.039 --> 24:05.502
They just evaporated. Where? Don't know. Why did they go away?

24:05.526 --> 24:08.688
Because there is no balance.

24:08.712 --> 24:13.157
And when there is no balance

24:13.181 --> 24:17.869
then one will go either to the left or to the right.

24:17.893 --> 24:20.063
And as I have told you several times

24:20.088 --> 24:24.670
that there are two types of forces within us.

24:24.694 --> 24:28.033
By one force we are attracted towards Sahajayoga

24:28.057 --> 24:30.907
and with the other force, we are thrown out.

24:30.931 --> 24:35.059
For example, if you tie a stone to a rope and swirl it

24:35.084 --> 24:36.864
the stone will keep on moving in a circle

24:36.896 --> 24:38.553
till it is connected with the rope

24:38.577 --> 24:40.640
and as soon as it will be separated from the rope

24:40.665 --> 24:49.301
suddenly it will be thrown away like a tangent.

24:49.325 --> 24:53.820
In the same way many people go out of Sahajyoga.

24:53.844 --> 24:54.833
Then people say

24:54.858 --> 24:59.254
" Mother, see in Sahajayoga the number of the people has reduced.

24:59.278 --> 25:00.735
What can I do?"

25:00.759 --> 25:05.184
But if the number has reduced, it is not a loss to Sahajayoga.

25:05.208 --> 25:09.533
It is their own loss.

25:09.557 --> 25:12.850
There is absolutely no loss at all to Sahajayoga.

25:12.874 --> 25:21.092
because that which has nothing to do with profit or loss

25:21.116 --> 25:25.299
how can it lose something?

25:25.323 --> 25:34.021
But, if you want to be benefitted by it, then you try to understand that

25:34.045 --> 25:42.882
that Sahajayoga does not need you, you need Sahajayoga.

25:42.906 --> 25:47.767
Now, the other meaning of 'yog' is 'Yukti ', means a trick.

25:47.792 --> 25:57.554
First, is that there should be connection, but the second is “Yukti”.

25:57.578 --> 26:07.241
This 'Yukti' should be understood. What is this trick?

26:07.265 --> 26:12.211
It can be made to understand in 3 ways.

26:12.236 --> 26:17.992
First, Yukti is that we must have the knowledge about it.

26:18.016 --> 26:20.481
Knowledge does not mean "Intelligence"

26:20.505 --> 26:25.820
but in our fingers, in our hands

26:25.844 --> 26:32.206
inside, the complete awakening of the Kundalini is knowledge.

26:32.230 --> 26:34.678
And when you have this kind of knowledge

26:34.703 --> 26:38.422
then you start having more knowledge also.

26:38.607 --> 26:40.898
Many things, which you could not understand (earlier)

26:40.923 --> 26:42.783
you start understanding now.

26:42.807 --> 26:48.561
Now you understand who is truthful and who is not.

26:48.585 --> 26:53.332
And with this knowledge you can awaken the Kundalini of others

26:53.357 --> 26:55.717
and then you can even explain to them.

26:55.845 --> 27:04.448
And you can perfectly be one with them.

27:04.473 --> 27:11.210
You can communicate with them, talk to them about this knowledge.

27:11.235 --> 27:17.078
So, because of this knowledge, you get intellectual knowledge too.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.383
You understand Sahajyoga.

27:19.407 --> 27:21.651
Otherwise could anybody understand this earlier?

27:21.675 --> 27:29.767
“Ida Pingala Sukhamana Nadi Re, Ek Hi Dor Udaunga”

27:29.791 --> 27:36.344
So, this kind of talk Kabira used to do, would anybody understand him?

27:36.368 --> 27:39.471
Did anybody understand Nanaka ?

27:39.495 --> 27:43.307
Or did anybody understand Gyaneshwara ji?

27:43.331 --> 27:46.248
Nobody understood LaoTsé?

27:46.272 --> 27:50.542
The saints are saying something very mysterious and secretive

27:50.567 --> 27:53.165
taking it like that.

27:53.189 --> 27:55.926
But after being in Sahajayoga, you started understanding everything.

27:55.950 --> 27:59.808
So, even your intellectual cleverness too increased.

27:59.832 --> 28:02.559
That too became more clever. You started understanding it.

28:02.583 --> 28:06.922
It is good that you started understanding it.

28:06.946 --> 28:10.407
And whatever was secret became understandable.

28:10.432 --> 28:15.700
Also you have been able to understand everything.

28:15.883 --> 28:20.490
The first Yukti is that you have increased your knowledge.

28:20.620 --> 28:24.585
Now what is the second Yukti?

28:24.609 --> 28:31.603
That is when you have devotion towards Me.

28:31.627 --> 28:40.569
Now when you have this Bhakti, it should do Ananya-Bhakti

28:40.593 --> 28:49.624
Means that you have to become one with Me.

28:49.648 --> 28:57.986
For example, you start thinking as I think.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.307
For example, today it got delayed.

29:00.331 --> 29:04.406
"So I too could have said

29:04.431 --> 29:05.989
" I am also very tired, it is so late I was asleep whole night.

29:06.014 --> 29:10.150
Now I can't do anything".

29:10.174 --> 29:14.708
But I thought that the puja of Navaratri has to be done at night

29:14.732 --> 29:17.234
and I had to get this auspicious time only.

29:17.258 --> 29:19.083
This is the auspitious time.

29:19.107 --> 29:21.771
This moment only should this puja be performed.

29:21.795 --> 29:28.028
And this should happen and we should do it

29:28.052 --> 29:30.432
and we are doing it with such a lot of joy

29:30.457 --> 29:32.585
because this is the auspicious time

29:32.609 --> 29:34.835
and we should be ready for that.

29:34.859 --> 29:37.435
We do not even think about that

29:37.459 --> 29:43.673
that we are tired, we did not take rest, nothing.

29:43.697 --> 29:47.279
For example, a soldier goes to the battle field

29:47.304 --> 29:49.141
and he sees that the enemy is standing in front of him

29:49.165 --> 29:51.024
this is the right time to kill him

29:51.048 --> 29:53.172
and at that time only, he should kill that enemy.

29:53.196 --> 29:59.216
In the same way, this is the right time for us to do this puja.

29:59.240 --> 30:00.861
So I am sitting here

30:00.885 --> 30:02.779
and you should also understand that

30:02.804 --> 30:04.646
Mother has chosen this time only

30:04.671 --> 30:07.100
that this is the perfect time for us.

30:07.124 --> 30:10.706
So, we should do the puja right at this moment only.

30:10.806 --> 30:12.419
But those who are half baked people

30:12.443 --> 30:13.815
will think the other way.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.328
Now we are sitting here since morning

30:16.353 --> 30:21.903
We did this, now we are feeling hungry, we have not taken our meals.

30:21.927 --> 30:25.978
Children must be sleeping.

30:26.003 --> 30:27.975
So, this is not Ananya-bhakti.

30:27.999 --> 30:32.486
So, My thoughts are not your thoughts.

30:32.510 --> 30:37.059
The way I think, you don't think.

30:37.083 --> 31:05.462
Anybody's

31:05.486 --> 31:13.162
That is not in your thought process.

31:13.186 --> 31:15.616
Sometimes, I think!

31:15.640 --> 31:19.909
"Mother,even today this man is so bad. He is like this, like that".

31:19.933 --> 31:24.059
I say,"No, he’s a very good man, an excellent man

31:24.083 --> 31:26.485
how do you say like that?

31:26.509 --> 31:28.564
How did you say like that?"

31:28.588 --> 31:33.331
Then I start wondering, why they are not seeing what I see?

31:33.379 --> 31:37.376
If they are seeing through My eyes, they should also see what I see.

31:37.400 --> 31:42.547
But it is not so, they are seeing something else.

31:42.571 --> 31:50.033
So, this is not 'Ananya' (one). This is 'Anya' (other).

31:50.057 --> 31:55.768
In the same way as My love is there for you

31:55.792 --> 31:57.643
and I am satisfied only with one thing

31:57.668 --> 32:00.646
that you have same love for others.

32:00.670 --> 32:04.109
If that thing is not there

32:04.134 --> 32:11.815
In that case I feel that it is ' anya' (separated) and not 'ananya' (one).

32:11.839 --> 32:20.961
If everybody is a part of My body, then they should become like Me.

32:20.986 --> 32:25.719
They should think like Me

32:25.744 --> 32:30.293
They should do, what I am doing.

32:30.317 --> 32:34.903
Why do they think differently?

32:34.927 --> 32:37.236
Why do they think the opposite?

32:37.260 --> 32:45.167
From where do these strange thoughts come to their mind?

32:45.191 --> 32:47.944
So, this is not 'Ananya' bhakti (devotion).

32:47.968 --> 32:58.445
This bhakti is your individual way.

32:58.469 --> 33:08.981
So, your thought process, your work and your love

33:09.005 --> 33:17.904
it should be just the same as you love Me.

33:17.928 --> 33:21.029
And if this is the source of love

33:21.053 --> 33:25.838
whatever is in the well, should come out in the bucket.

33:25.862 --> 33:28.790
How can anything else come in the bucket?

33:28.814 --> 33:31.553
And when something else comes

33:31.578 --> 33:41.443
then I feel that they have taken the water from some other well.

33:41.544 --> 33:50.136
This is not my bucket.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.617
Now the third yukti is that

33:52.641 --> 33:57.156
when i told you the second thing

33:57.180 --> 34:03.505
that you keep within you, an Ananya Shakti.

34:03.540 --> 34:10.336
Mother, "I am surrendered to You. I am very much surrendered".

34:10.360 --> 34:14.050
So, if you are surrendered, then if I tell you something

34:14.075 --> 34:15.694
or explain you something

34:15.718 --> 34:24.790
or keep some proposal or something before you

34:24.814 --> 34:27.965
how can the question of refusal arise in that?

34:27.989 --> 34:34.344
If you and Me are one, why should this question arise?

34:34.379 --> 34:36.797
Mother has said, "so it is oK".

34:36.822 --> 34:40.926
Because, we have become Mother only, how can we say," No"?

34:40.950 --> 34:45.234
For example, you can see My eye

34:45.258 --> 34:49.697
So, My eye knows that you are sitting in front of Me

34:49.721 --> 34:52.272
because My eyes are Mine.

34:52.296 --> 34:54.632
So, whatever is My understanding

34:54.657 --> 34:58.497
there is no difference between that and the understanding of My eyes .

34:58.521 --> 34:59.976
It is one and the same thing.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.032
What I am understanding through My intelligence

35:02.056 --> 35:07.888
that I am understanding through my eyes also.

35:08.016 --> 35:14.733
Then you did't get what is called, 'oneness' with Me.

35:14.757 --> 35:21.298
So, this is another yukti, "Mother please come to My heart

35:21.323 --> 35:24.216
come into my head, come into my thoughts

35:24.240 --> 35:26.916
come into every moment of my life".

35:27.033 --> 35:31.140
Wherever you ask Me, I am available with folded hands.

35:31.165 --> 35:35.532
I am ready, but you will have to say

35:35.556 --> 35:38.592
and will have to say, with full heart.

35:38.616 --> 35:44.660
If you connect with Me with the aim of getting benifitted

35:44.684 --> 35:46.903
even then it is not good.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.041
But once the connection is established

35:49.066 --> 35:53.567
then all the purposes will be automatically achieved.

35:53.591 --> 35:55.795
You won’t have to do anything.

35:55.819 --> 36:00.159
When all the purposes will be achieved automatically

36:00.183 --> 36:05.179
your attention will be in that only.

36:05.203 --> 36:08.074
Now the third thing is that

36:08.098 --> 36:10.297
that we are doing this work

36:10.321 --> 36:14.464
we have done this work of Sahajyoga.

36:14.488 --> 36:19.381
We decorated this, set this right

36:19.405 --> 36:25.496
I did this, then you are not a Sahajyogi.

36:25.520 --> 36:29.238
In Sahajyoga, your all karmas(actions) should become Akarmas (non actions).

36:29.262 --> 36:40.745
But," I am doing something, I have written this poem i have done this".

36:40.769 --> 36:47.564
When, you see it once very subtly,

36:47.588 --> 36:54.592
" Do I really think like that, that I have done this

36:54.616 --> 36:57.427
does it come to my mind?"

36:57.451 --> 37:00.745
That means, my yoga (connection) is not yet complete.

37:00.769 --> 37:06.524
When your yoga is complete, you will not think like that.

37:06.548 --> 37:08.840
You cannot think at all, thoughts wiill not be there

37:08.864 --> 37:09.756
You are in Akarma.

37:09.781 --> 37:14.920
"This is happening, that is happening, all that is happening".

37:14.944 --> 37:18.440
You start talking like this

37:18.464 --> 37:23.827
And then we should say that you are at one with Me.

37:23.851 --> 37:29.004
Like My hand is doing some work. Does it say," I am doing this".

37:29.028 --> 37:34.434
It does not even know that it is doing, it is happening.

37:34.458 --> 37:37.497
[Not Clear]  I am only doing.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.735
But if he starts thinking," I am doing

37:39.759 --> 37:42.352
that means that my hand is cut off.

37:42.376 --> 37:45.298
It is not connected.

37:45.323 --> 37:47.599
If it is connected, then he will never feel

37:47.623 --> 37:54.475
that,"I am moving, i am walking, i am holding", he never feels.

37:54.499 --> 38:02.082
And when you feel that I am doing,  then chaitanya says," Do it".

38:02.106 --> 38:04.081
And then biggest of all problems starts.

38:04.105 --> 38:05.714
This is third yukti (trick).

38:05.738 --> 38:09.873
You should learn that trick, where i am doing something.

38:09.897 --> 38:11.000
For a moment you should introspect.

38:11.025 --> 38:16.811
Am i doing. What am i doing?

38:16.835 --> 38:19.595
Till you were searching self realization

38:19.627 --> 38:21.743
till then you were doing something

38:21.768 --> 38:24.541
because, you had ego.

38:24.565 --> 38:30.501
You were single individual, you were in VYASHTI, (alone).

38:30.526 --> 38:32.251
Now when you are in SAMASHTI (collective)

38:32.276 --> 38:38.539
when you have come in the collective, you are not doing anything.

38:38.564 --> 38:40.035
You are just a part and parcel of that collective

38:40.060 --> 38:42.296
and that work is being done.

38:42.321 --> 38:45.050
This is the third Yukti that you should understand.

38:45.074 --> 38:46.741
I am trying to tell you all these Yuktis because

38:46.765 --> 38:52.971
you have to take a jump now (into the new dimension).

38:52.995 --> 38:57.590
In this way, you should always try to introspect.

38:57.614 --> 38:59.298
And pay attention to yourself.

38:59.322 --> 39:03.831
Right now, it is better to look at oneself

39:03.855 --> 39:07.522
and see, am I thinking this?

39:07.547 --> 39:09.319
I am thinking for others.

39:09.343 --> 39:13.406
Do I think that somebody is much better than me?

39:13.430 --> 39:15.764
And that I should learn something from him.

39:15.864 --> 39:22.533
Do I see his qualities or just i see his drawbacks?

39:22.557 --> 39:24.821
If we see the good qualities of others

39:24.845 --> 39:28.018
and our drawbacks then it’s a very good thing.

39:28.042 --> 39:31.197
Because you can not eliminate the drawbacks of others

39:31.221 --> 39:32.682
You do not have the right to do that

39:32.707 --> 39:34.916
Where you have the right, you can take out your drawbacks only.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.018
So, what others have done? Others are like this

39:38.042 --> 39:44.706
people having such thoughts are not yet fully settled in yoga.

39:44.730 --> 39:48.953
Simply by seeing what is lacking in me, you can improve.

39:48.977 --> 39:50.920
By seeing the bad points of others you can never improve.

39:50.944 --> 39:54.042
It is like, you are thinking that in somebody else’s house

39:54.067 --> 39:55.540
These things are bad in their house

39:55.565 --> 39:58.275
these things are bad in their house.

39:58.300 --> 40:01.385
We should know. We should know this Yukti.

40:01.409 --> 40:06.541
If we are in a fix, it is because of our own problems.

40:06.565 --> 40:11.278
Sahajayoga is a very great thing. It is a very unique thing.

40:11.302 --> 40:13.921
But the drawback we have

40:14.021 --> 40:19.390
but the reason that even now we are not able to enjoy it

40:19.414 --> 40:23.275
its reason is that there is some or the other drawback in us.

40:23.299 --> 40:28.141
And on getting all this

40:28.165 --> 40:34.250
if we are able to master this Yukti

40:34.274 --> 40:36.370
what will you get?

40:36.394 --> 40:41.108
Only Joy! Nirananda! And nothing else!

40:41.133 --> 40:45.703
And then what else do you want?

40:45.727 --> 40:48.108
Your face itself will change.

40:48.133 --> 40:51.697
You will drench only in joy!

40:51.722 --> 40:55.343
And today, on My Birthday

40:55.367 --> 41:02.352
I would like that that your birthday too might be celebrated.

41:02.376 --> 41:06.916
That from today, we understand this Yukhti

41:06.940 --> 41:13.496
and fill ourselves with purity, like Shri Ganesha.

41:13.521 --> 41:18.373
Only with purity can the wisdom settle down in human beings.

41:18.397 --> 41:22.918
Because the other name of love is 'Purity'.

41:22.942 --> 41:28.092
But wisdom also means love only.

41:28.116 --> 41:31.234
Every thing means love.

41:31.258 --> 41:37.824
If you are not able to acquire this wisdom

41:37.848 --> 41:41.910
and don't consider 'Love' as your own

41:41.934 --> 41:46.726
You are wasting your time by coming to Sahajyoga.

41:46.751 --> 41:51.008
Now the time has come as such

41:51.163 --> 41:54.001
that everybody has to be united

41:54.025 --> 41:57.144
and have to transform ourselves.

41:57.168 --> 42:02.436
We have to transform ourselves, we have drawbacks.

42:02.460 --> 42:06.952
We have to purify ourselves completely.

42:06.976 --> 42:11.813
How much you are loving yourself

42:11.837 --> 42:15.631
if your child gets a little bit dirty, immediately you go and clean him

42:15.656 --> 42:18.083
because you love him.

42:18.107 --> 42:21.724
In the same way, when you will love yourself

42:21.748 --> 42:25.836
you will make all efforts to transform yourself.

42:25.861 --> 42:27.939
How much i have been transformed?

42:27.963 --> 42:30.240
Is this drawback still in me?

42:30.264 --> 42:32.619
Am i still like that?

42:32.643 --> 42:39.755
And as a result of this transformation

42:39.779 --> 42:44.443
there is blessing of that life

42:44.467 --> 42:48.636
which cannot be described.

42:48.660 --> 42:50.207
which Kabir said

42:50.232 --> 42:54.916
"Aab mast hue, phir kya bole” (Now I am drenched in joy, what shall i say?).

42:54.940 --> 42:57.741
So, you all be in that state of joy!

42:57.765 --> 43:00.154
you all achieve that state of joy!

43:00.179 --> 43:04.722
and in that joy, you be joyous!

43:04.746 --> 43:15.829
These are My blessings!

43:15.853 --> 43:21.745
Music.
