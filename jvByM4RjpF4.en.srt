1
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:11,487
The mind about which we speak and depend upon is a

2
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:20,596
myth. There’s nothing like mind. Brain is
reality, not the mind. Mind is created by

3
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:31,144
us reacting to outside, either we react to
conditionings or ego. Thus this mind is created

4
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:39,377
like bubbles in the ocean of reality, but
that’s not reality.

5
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:53,315
This mind, whatever we decide, we know, is
very limited, illusive and sometimes shocking.

6
00:00:53,647 --> 00:01:00,647
The mind always move in a linear direction,
and because there’s no reality in it, it

7
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:13,676
recoils, and boomerangs. Thus all the enterprises,
all the projections so far we have done, it

8
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:20,797
seems, come back to us. Whatever they discover,
comes back to us as a big destructive power

9
00:01:24,347 --> 00:01:28,477
or a very big shock.

10
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:35,477
So one has to decide what to do, how to be
out of this trap of our mind. Kundalini is

11
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:47,107
the solution. When She’s awakened, She takes
you, with that awakening, She takes you beyond

12
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:54,677
your mind. The first thing is to go beyond
your mind. With mind, you’ll do many things,

13
00:01:55,737 --> 00:02:01,967
but it will not be satisfying, it will be
not a solution, it will not help you. And

14
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:07,897
when we start depending too much on our mind
we develop all kinds of physical, mental,

15
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:14,897
emotional problem. Now the latest is the stress,
and this stress has no solution they say,

16
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:22,087
but in Sahaja Yoga, we find the solution,
by crossing over this mind. It’s like a

17
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:31,727
barrier for our advancement.

18
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:38,727
So when you get your realisation, you must
understand that your Kundalini has taken your

19
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:46,907
attention beyond the mind. Now, this reaction
to outside has come because we human beings

20
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:56,027
have a prism-like brain, or we can say a prism-like
skull, and when the energy passes into it,

21
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:04,837
I’ve explained it in My books, it goes into
bifurcations, or you can say refractions,

22
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:09,326
by which our attention goes out, and we react.

23
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:16,326
If we react too much, then these bubbles create
a very horrible mind which can lead to any

24
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:25,487
kind of thing. It justifies itself, it pampers
your ego. The ego and the conditioning that

25
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:36,837
creates this mind start using this mind for
the purpose of their fulfilment, of their,

26
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:49,266
all the accumulation of ideas and thoughts
which has no backing, which has no reality

27
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:56,597
with it.

28
00:03:56,597 --> 00:04:03,597
It’s like we make the computer [and] ultimately
we become slaves of the computer, we make

29
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:11,407
the watches ourselves, and then we become
slaves of the watches. That’s how it dominates

30
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:18,407
human beings. And when a person who has a
very strong mind decides to destroy, like

31
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:28,717
Hitler did, with some idea, he can go on destroying
which has a very far fetched effect on our

32
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:33,407
culture, on our spirituality.

33
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:40,407
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly
aware – where you cross your mind, you go

34
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:50,386
above your mind, mind cannot affect you. This
is the first stage as we call, is thoughtless

35
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:51,157
awareness.

36
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:58,157
Second one is where you start seeing the working
of this Paramchaitanya, of this All-pervading

37
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:05,917
Power. And you start becoming aware that there
is lot of truth in what Mataji says. That

38
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:18,547
there is this Power that works out many things.
It works miraculously so many things for you.

39
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:26,766
It gives you blessings, It guides you, It
helps you in so many ways It helps you. It

40
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:34,886
gives you good health, good wealth, and also
a very good society of very beautiful people

41
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:43,436
in the collective. All that you can see clearly
is happening here.

42
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:50,706
Now this happening of achieving thoughtless
awareness is very simple and easy, but to

43
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:12,807
maintain at that point is difficult. We still
react and we think. Anything you see, you

44
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:22,566
react. To get to that point in thoughtless
awareness is first to change your attention.

45
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:33,657
Now, for example, once we were climbing a
very high mountain to see one temple called

46
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:43,057
Palitana – Myself, My son-in-law and My
daughter. And we were really tired because

47
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:49,087
we had to climb, I don’t know how many steps
and when we went up we were tired and there

48
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,977
was a little canopy made of beautiful marble
carving, so we just lay down there ourselves.

49
00:06:55,977 --> 00:07:01,467
They were very tired and they said : “What
is this kind of a temple!” They were grudging.

50
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:08,467
While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful
elephants were carved. So I told My son-in-law,

51
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:18,147
“Look at these elephants, they all have
tails of different types.” He said “Mummy,

52
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:25,506
we are all dying, how can you see the tails
of elephants?” But is just to divert their

53
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:33,446
attention from that tiredness [that] I told
them that – why not see the tails of the

54
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:35,696
elephant, which is very different.

55
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:42,696
So what happens [is] that, when you are putting
your attention so much to outside all the

56
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:51,897
time, then you must first of all also divert
your attention. For example, you see these

57
00:07:54,717 --> 00:08:00,177
beautifully made things here. Your attention
is something else – just try to enjoy the

58
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:05,987
beauty of that. You see. there are beautiful
carpets here – just look at them without

59
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:12,066
thinking, because they don’t belong to you,
so no headache, they belong to somebody else,

60
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:16,897
is very good! Otherwise, if it belongs to
you you start thinking ; “Oh, My God, I

61
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:21,746
have spread them here, what will happen, they
have to be insured!” Or some sort of a thing

62
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:26,457
like that. That’s common human reaction.
But if it doesn’t belong to you, you can

63
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:33,457
watch it nicely. Now you watch it and don’t
think. You’ll be amazed, when you see the

64
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:40,586
beauty that is put inside this, you’ll see
the artist who has put his joy, his exuberance

65
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:47,586
into it, and you’ll be amazed, after realisation,
that, this exuberance will fill into you and

66
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:56,967
a cool kind of a relaxation will come into
you, and this Kundalini will rise, and you’ll

67
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:04,787
become steady in your thoughtless awareness.
So whenever you look at anything, look at

68
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:11,787
any beautiful thing, even say, today’s election,
just watch the man that is elected. Watching

69
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:23,566
him, itself, gives him blessings, gives him
better ideas. You get also ideas, which are

70
00:09:25,177 --> 00:09:32,177
coming from reality, which are there – how
to make this man a successful person, or this

71
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:37,066
country a successful democracy.

72
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:44,066
All these things happen when your attention
is diverted from criticising, from reacting

73
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:55,017
– just you watch, become the witness, try
to witness everything. It’s not so very

74
00:09:57,177 --> 00:10:04,177
yet practised, so far, I’ve seen, that,
whenever even we get our, achieve our, realisation,

75
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:11,326
we don’t realise that we have to witness
everything. When you start witnessing through

76
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:18,326
your Spirit, then you don’t see the bad
points of another, but you see the good points.

77
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:25,576
You just pick up the person with very good
points.

78
00:10:25,777 --> 00:10:32,777
So once you see that, the witness state enlarges,
and you start enjoying another person. You

79
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:42,377
start enjoying every thing that is there,
even a small blade of grass you can enjoy,

80
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,407
if you have that capacity.
