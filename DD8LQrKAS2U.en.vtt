00:02:26.557 --> 00:02:31.160
SY: ...of India, in the Constituent Assembly of India.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.480
Mataji, before She took up this message of spreading

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.520
Hindu philosophy and Hindu thoughts,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.960
She was married in a very intellectually, prominent family

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.079
and She was married to Shri C.P. Shrivastava.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.000
[Those of you] who know the post freedom leadership,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.600
among the IAS community,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.080
very well-known some of the names,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.720
and Shri C.P. Shrivastava's name

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.200
was one of the most prominent names.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.248
He had the distinction of being

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.480
the principal private secretary to Shastriji,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.000
Shri Lal Bhahadur Shastri.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.579
And only now after seeing his name, I remember Mataji.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.480
When I was a secretary Government Teachers' Foundation

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.400
and we had a conference in Delhi,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.920
when we were invited to Shastriji’s house,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.009
it was Shrivastavaji who conducted the guests

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.200
to the, to the house of Shastriji.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.654
And I have great pleasure that God creates situations,

00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:42.513
that we meet different people at different situation,

00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:45.680
just to prove that the world is so small.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.799
Shrivastavaji, after serving as a
distinguished person with Shastriji,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.753
then he was transferred to the, to the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.079
to the Shipping Corporation of India,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.920
where he was the secretary,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.880
and later on he was with the United Nation Agency,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.240
in the form of International Maritime Agency.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.800
Now this is the background of this intellectual family.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.600
As the holders of important positions in the government of India

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.200
and in the International Assembly at the UNO,

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.479
they must be coming in contact with

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.960
highly prominent international personalities.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.640
And Mataji among them all,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.520
instead of glorifying Herself,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.600
in those positions of contacts and great places,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.680
Her bent of mind was towards spiritualism.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.960
And today [with the event], She lectures to us,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.760
when She tells us some of the mysteries of our teachings,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.159
we will have the occasion of knowing Her more of the message.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.760
Born near Nagpur, at a place called Chinddwara.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.799
She is younger than me

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.600
and the glow of the charm of the spiritual world,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.720
as you see on Mataji’s face,

00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:17.121
it is a rare thing to find people so radiant invariably.

00:05:17.322 --> 00:05:21.002
And then She speaks to us [unclear].

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.479
I welcome You Mataji on behalf of the members of the Hindu Center

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:30.359
and before all the Hindu community principals.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.200
You are in the program

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.640
and when the time comes we tell You, request You to come and speak.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.919
If You like to sit on the platform and speak.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.680
Or You would like to stand? As You like.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.520
It is also our practice to let you know

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.440
as to what we have been doing

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.360
during the month when we met you last and now.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.760
We celebrate the Independence Day in this country

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.599
and the High Commissioner invites the various organizations

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.960
to plan and organize the 15-th of August program.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.240
We were invited there and we did a promise

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.840
that we will take part in whatever the activities are being done.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.791
We had a meeting at the Coffee House

00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:21.254
arranged by the founder of DfC (Department for Communities)

00:06:21.454 --> 00:06:23.439
on race equalities,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.560
which I attended on behalf the Hindu Centre.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.599
And at the New Life office,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.244
Ken Livingstone, [on the year] he was invited...

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.680
First of all,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.721
I thank the coordinator and founder of the Hindu center.

00:07:19.677 --> 00:07:23.360
I give heartfelt thanks to all,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.825
as they have given Me an opportunity to meet and talk to you all.

00:07:30.676 --> 00:07:34.312
In the beginning I would like

00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:42.007
to talk in English to the guests about Kundalini.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.127
And after that I will talk in Hindi.

00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:50.720
If you all give Me the permission,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.367
I will tell to the Indians how they should live here.

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:09.240
Kundalini is not a new thing

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.960
or something that has started in the modern times.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.640
It's the most ancient science of spiritual life.

00:08:21.535 --> 00:08:27.005
It's not that it was not understood or seen

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:31.585
in other places than India,

00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:35.039
that people knew about Kundalini.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.640
But the language used

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.160
can confuse many people to think

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.360
that Kundalini is something very localized

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.119
or may be something nationalistic.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.746
In our country, historically if you see, I mean India,

00:08:54.947 --> 00:08:58.600
we had three types of movements brought in.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:06.046
The first movement on spiritual grounds was

00:09:06.248 --> 00:09:11.520
that of what we call the right side movement,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.313
meaning we were trying to control the nature.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.823
Or we were trying to control the nature

00:09:21.023 --> 00:09:22.532
through the will of God

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:26.479
or through the will of that All Pervading Power,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.359
which we call as chaitanya.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.479
Accordingly we started having yajnas

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.229
and other methods

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:42.856
of invoking the Spirit of these elements,

00:09:43.057 --> 00:09:45.316
by which we could understand them

00:09:45.516 --> 00:09:48.682
and they could understand us.

00:09:49.666 --> 00:09:52.320
I feel the result of that, today we see,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.680
is the science that we have developed.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.766
The result of that, many seers in India saw

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:03.280
so many things created in that great country.

00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:07.240
Much before we even started writing the history,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.320
they had created great aeroplanes

00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:12.560
and all kinds of pilotless,

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.000
not bombs, but aeroplanes, in those days.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.578
That’s a fact.

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:20.400
Of course it is difficult to face it,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.560
because people can’t believe it, that our country

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.679
could have produced such great things.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.303
The second kind of movement started in India,

00:10:32.504 --> 00:10:37.097
was that of bhakti, of worshiping God.

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:40.280
The people who were intellectuals,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.800
started working through the intellect,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.944
to create a rapport

00:10:47.145 --> 00:10:51.564
between human beings and the nature.

00:10:51.766 --> 00:10:54.501
And the other

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.000
part of the people who were seekers,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.560
thought it is better

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.360
to sing the praise of God

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.120
and invite His grace upon us,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.880
so that the light of His love

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.400
will expose all that is spiritual

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.812
and higher than human awareness.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.960
And the third type of movement,

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.280
which was very secretive in those days

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.639
was the movement of evolutionary process,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.160
by which a human being was to make,

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.831
to be made aware of his higher Self,

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.400
that was his Spirit, his Atma,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.435
through Kundalini awakening.

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:47.236
You will be amazed that at the time of Shri Rama,

00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:50.120
His own father-in-law, who was Raja Janaka,

00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:52.960
had one disciple called Nachiketa.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.259
And he asked that he would like to know about his Self,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.130
about his Atma.

00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:02.236
And Raja Janaka told him, "You can take all my wealth,

00:12:02.437 --> 00:12:04.394
you can take everything that I have,

00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:10.440
but please don’t ask me to give you enlightenment".

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:13.126
But Nachiketa

00:12:13.327 --> 00:12:19.070
was very anxious and assiduous

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.560
and he achieved his goal ultimately.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.744
So at the time of Raja Janaka, we can say,

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:26.759
there were very few people,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.960
who really received their Self Realization.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.400
But on the whole, the people at that time, not being so complexed,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.760
by mental projections and other problems in life,

00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:41.720
they were very simple and were sensitive

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.440
to the Divinity.

00:12:45.642 --> 00:12:47.840
They understood who Rama was,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.920
they understood who Sita was,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.200
and they understood what divine power was in those days.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.160
Though they did not aspire

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.360
to be the Spirit, maybe,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.680
but they, so many of them knew about it.

00:13:02.062 --> 00:13:05.960
Now the Patanjali yoga, as described,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.640
is the yoga was practiced in our country thousands of years back,

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.200
thousands and thousands of years back,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.967
when we had a very different type of a system existing.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.800
When we talk of yoga I see here

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.613
some sort of a exercise people do.

00:13:22.814 --> 00:13:23.959
I am really amazed,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.331
it has nothing to do with yoga at all.

00:13:28.264 --> 00:13:30.880
Patanjali yoga has got

00:13:31.081 --> 00:13:36.480
eight-fold processes - Ashtangas.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.050
Out of that

00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:41.358
the first and the foremost is Ishwara Pragnya,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.520
meaning you must establish your Ishwara within yourself.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.888
Means, your Ishwara means the Spirit.

00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:49.119
The Spirit must be first established

00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:51.878
and then all the other seven followed.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.640
Yama, Niyama are there,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.760
which are very strict

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.400
and if you read them, you can think that

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.080
hardly one or two persons in the whole world can follow that,

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.363
and people can get a shock to know that

00:14:04.564 --> 00:14:06.550
you don’t have to lead a married life,

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.310
and all those things were there.

00:14:08.511 --> 00:14:12.319
But because in those days there were hardly one or two persons only

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.357
who could get to that kind of thing,

00:14:14.558 --> 00:14:16.520
all these austere methods were given

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.439
and were practiced in those days,

00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:21.560
and people did achieve their highest goal,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.480
by first getting their Self-Realization

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.359
and then going through the different training

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.839
of their life style,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.719
to achieve the ultimate.

00:14:36.888 --> 00:14:40.680
So to say that Hatha Yoga means only standing on your heads,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.407
it's a very wrong, wrong idea about yoga.

00:14:43.608 --> 00:14:48.800
Yoga is a word, comes from the word yuthi - joining.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.319
When your attention

00:14:54.387 --> 00:14:56.880
is enlightened by the Spirit

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.400
or when you,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.400
the Jeevatma, becomes one with the Spirit

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.403
or with the Divine Power,

00:15:06.604 --> 00:15:09.244
then it is the real yoga.

00:15:09.678 --> 00:15:12.640
The another meaning of the word yoga is -

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.760
which is being now misused -

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.520
kaushalam, means the depthness.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.640
Those who first got their Realization

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.160
had to know the methods and the laws

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.800
that govern human beings on the divine level,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.273
means the divine laws, how they are acting

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.302
and how you have to utilize them.

00:15:35.503 --> 00:15:39.795
And this knowledge was the real yoga kaushalam,

00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:43.920
or the depthness about divine laws, how to operate them.

00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:49.120
As the time passed by, many things disappeared into thin air,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.671
and the great seers and yogis disappeared also

00:15:51.872 --> 00:15:54.120
in the Himalayas and all farfetched caves,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.840
because they thought human beings
are incapable of understanding them.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.285
Now those half baked people who went round to them -

00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:04.760
they tried their level best to convince them

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.720
that yoga is to be done

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.479
only on the spiritual level to begin with,

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.520
and once the Kundalini rises in this yoga,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.400
then only you know what problems you have

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.720
and what it is related to,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.142
and then accordingly you have to do the ‘yama’ and ‘niyama’.

00:16:23.344 --> 00:16:25.400
Now two words ‘yama’ and ‘niyama’,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.399
one relates to the collectivity, to the ‘samastha’

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.080
and the ‘niyama’ relates to a human being.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.880
That means what you have to follow in your regular life

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.640
is the ’niyama’  in your person,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.680
what you have to change.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.831
And the ‘yama’  is where, how much

00:16:44.032 --> 00:16:47.331
you have to bother about others, the society

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.400
in which you live, the people with whom you have to relate.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.640
All that sort of a system doesn’t exist today.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.680
Because in those days, as you know,

00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:01.313
there was complete ‘brahmacharya’ for the students

00:17:01.514 --> 00:17:04.640
till the age of about 22-25 years, when they got married,

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:06.264
to such an extent,

00:17:06.465 --> 00:17:09.142
that even the university in which the children studied

00:17:09.344 --> 00:17:11.680
was called by 'their gotra’.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.120
For example My ‘gotra’ is Sandilya.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.919
Now even today I cannot marry in the same ‘gotra’.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.178
Means in one university, you could not marry another person,

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.983
for generations together.

00:17:23.184 --> 00:17:26.536
Such a kind of a pure celibacy was exercised

00:17:26.737 --> 00:17:28.200
till the age of 25.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.440
But after marriage

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.280
people did not talk of these things.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.840
This was only till the age of 25 years,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:41.475
a kind of education, in Patanjali style of university, was given.

00:17:42.155 --> 00:17:46.276
So, today we are faced with the modern life.

00:17:46.477 --> 00:17:49.400
And in the modern life to talk of Patanjali yoga,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.600
as it was and as should be,

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.026
is a very, very difficult thing.

00:17:54.227 --> 00:17:56.640
We can’t expect people to give up their families,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.486
run away from their families,

00:17:58.688 --> 00:18:03.560
go to the remote corners of Himalayas and meditate.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.520
This is not the time for that.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.160
And the problem of the Divine is this,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.399
that after creating this great world,

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.080
after creating human beings,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:21.399
He finds that in our seeking we have gone astray, everywhere.

00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.192
I would not even say that in India we have not gone astray.

00:18:24.393 --> 00:18:26.296
Everywhere we have gone astray

00:18:26.497 --> 00:18:29.594
and we have to accept that we have gone to extremes

00:18:29.856 --> 00:18:31.131
in all our seeking,

00:18:31.332 --> 00:18:33.677
whether it is Christianity, Hinduism or any religion.

00:18:33.878 --> 00:18:36.240
We have gone to extremes and we have committed mistakes

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.785
and the time has come for us to look back

00:18:38.986 --> 00:18:41.262
and see where are we.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.601
When I was born as a child,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.440
I felt now the time has come for people

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.440
to get en-masse Realization.

00:18:52.641 --> 00:18:54.600
Otherwise there is no saving,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.480
because whatever has happened has happened, doesn’t matter.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.200
Wherever they are doesn’t matter.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.880
They have to get to their Spirit,

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.439
otherwise you cannot talk to them about God.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.760
This is a fact.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.800
Today if you talk to young people -

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.280
now you see this church, this has become a Hindu center.

00:19:10.481 --> 00:19:13.563
And also Hindus as such today are,

00:19:13.764 --> 00:19:15.723
their children, if you see them,

00:19:15.923 --> 00:19:19.000
they are not interested in religion, they are not interested in God.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.000
And we must face the reality as it is

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.760
and not have our own imagination about it,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.600
because in that imagination we will lose the whole thing.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.000
So today, when the world is so pressurized,

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.840
with all kinds of conflicts,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.920
and all kinds of funny ideas,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.209
and all kinds of unholy attack on human beings,

00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:42.400
what is the solution?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.880
To give people the Self Realization.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.320
As they are, wherever they are,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.120
they have to have their Realization.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.402
And I decided that I'll work

00:19:52.603 --> 00:19:56.319
on the permutations and combinations of the problems,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.920
of all the people, what problems they have,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.363
what we are, what they are suffering from and...

00:20:05.565 --> 00:20:08.280
Can you remove the child, please?

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.562
What...

00:20:20.914 --> 00:20:23.591
Just take the child [a bit faster]. Better take her out.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.380
That is better.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.579
So the problems of today

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.520
are to be faced as they are

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.240
and a solution has to be found out.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.720
As I told you,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.880
through My meditative powers

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.320
or we can say meditative surrendering,

00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.320
I found out that human beings have very few problems.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.404
And wherever they are, under whatever circumstances,

00:21:03.605 --> 00:21:05.205
whatever they have done,

00:21:05.406 --> 00:21:07.720
whatever mistakes so-called they have committed,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.480
whatever anti-God activities they have taken to,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.324
it is now absolutely essential

00:21:15.525 --> 00:21:18.120
that they have to get their Self Realization.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.960
No use talking about God,

00:21:20.161 --> 00:21:23.400
no use talking about divine power,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.679
and no use telling them that, "You must balance your life.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.120
Don’t do this and don’t do that", like all the Ten Commandments.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.480
"Take to a [new start], take to this, take to that".

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.240
Nobody is going to listen to.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.080
This is what I found out,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.040
and that is how I have worked out

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.040
all the permutations and combinations

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.436
that are hindering the growth of human beings

00:21:46.637 --> 00:21:49.894
into a higher realm of Self.

00:21:50.608 --> 00:21:52.240
And when I worked it out

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.560
I was amazed that it's very little to be done.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.440
Human beings are already ready to be there.

00:21:58.641 --> 00:22:00.680
But the biggest thing

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.853
that human beings have to have

00:22:03.059 --> 00:22:05.519
is the desire to change.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.880
As he said that

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.080
I am related also to very sophisticated people

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.280
of London and all over the world,

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.323
but what I found among them,

00:22:16.524 --> 00:22:18.042
they have no desire to change.

00:22:18.243 --> 00:22:20.439
They are so self-satisfied and self-opinionated.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.760
They have no desire to change themselves

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.560
nor the world, nor any.

00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:27.120
So no question of talking these things to them.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.560
But there's a category of special people

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.000
who are called as "seekers" today,

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.280
whom William Blake has called as "the men of God",

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.520
that, "they have to become the prophets

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.280
and they will have powers to make others prophets".

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.800
And that time, that prophecy can be fulfilled today

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.520
in this England, which is the Jerusalem.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.840
To Me when I am in England, I must say I am English,

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.378
and all the problems of England, I face them

00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:55.919
as any English seer would like to see.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.280
At the time of Blake, as he saw it,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.317
I could see the same way.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.346
Now, when this Kundalini,

00:23:03.546 --> 00:23:07.653
which is placed within us in the sacrum bone,

00:23:07.854 --> 00:23:12.960
is awakened by some enlightened person,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.600
then She pierces through the fontanel bone area,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.919
which is called in Sanskrit as ‘Brahmarandra’,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.883
you get your real baptism as they call it.

00:23:26.084 --> 00:23:27.335
This is what Christ said,

00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:29.684
"You have to be baptized, you have to be born again".

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:32.891
But it does not mean that anybody puts their hand on your head

00:23:33.092 --> 00:23:36.000
or makes you wear Indian [unclear], you are born again.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.007
It's happening. We must understand,

00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:40.008
as all reasonable, sensible people,

00:23:40.209 --> 00:23:42.120
we must understand that is not real.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.720
It is some sort of an artificial ceremony,

00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:48.224
which is symbolic of something real behind it.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.440
So to have the real ceremony, what do we do?

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.160
To have the real ceremony,

00:23:55.361 --> 00:23:57.162
there must be some method within us,

00:23:57.363 --> 00:24:00.811
and that method is already built in within us.

00:24:01.822 --> 00:24:03.574
All the scientist can ask a question,

00:24:03.776 --> 00:24:05.407
a simple questions to themselves,

00:24:05.608 --> 00:24:08.960
"Why God has made us human beings from amoeba to this stage?"

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.520
What is the purpose of God to make us a human being?

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.120
And the answer? Then we say, "We don’t know".

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.360
But perhaps if somebody says,

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.040
that one [can know] this answer is

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.360
that you are made like this,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.159
you are in a transition to become the Spirit.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.520
When this instrument is put here and made,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.680
it has to be put to the mains, otherwise it doesn’t work.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.960
First of all you should be put to the mains,

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.040
otherwise whatever you are doing,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.440
you are doing it in a relative world, not in an absolute world.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.480
Once you become one with that

00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:48.920
then your whole language is

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.600
- like Kabera says - is so much there.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.879
You can see he was a realized soul,

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.995
and when he was a realized soul he spoke with such authority,

00:25:00.196 --> 00:25:02.959
with such understanding of the Divine.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.200
And when he said something, people never understood him.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.240
They used to laugh at him, mock at him.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.920
They have crucified people, they have beaten them.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.439
We have done, not only in England, it is done everywhere.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.000
So the basis of all that

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.591
is a simple ignorance, agyan ka,

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.039
that there is God,

00:25:23.239 --> 00:25:26.199
that there is All pervading Power, [it is so kind],

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.280
which we have to feel for the first time,

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.400
you feel after the Kundalini awakening.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.070
Before that it doesn’t happen.

00:25:33.271 --> 00:25:36.120
So Patanjali yoga will be used in the sense that

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.868
once you get your Realization,

00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:40.200
you have to understand how to maintain it.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.066
You don’t have to give up your families.

00:25:42.267 --> 00:25:44.509
On the contrary, in Sahaja yoga, if you are not married,

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.760
I find it's difficult to give you Realization.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.987
It is surprising, in the whole of England,

00:25:49.188 --> 00:25:52.248
where we have thousands of people who have got Realization,

00:25:52.449 --> 00:25:54.520
there's only one person who is not yet married,

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.264
hasn’t got Realization.

00:25:56.465 --> 00:25:59.625
So those who don’t marry are in little bit in imbalances, we think.

00:25:59.826 --> 00:26:01.520
They are on extreme sometimes,

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.960
so you are supposed to marry after a certain age.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.880
Not only that, but you have to lead a very, very normal life.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.600
All the great saints of India have been married people,

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.520
like Nanaka was a married man, Kabira was a married man,

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.311
Janaka was a married man.

00:26:18.512 --> 00:26:22.720
Even the incarnations like Rama, Krishna, all of them were married.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.320
So to say that austerity is going to bring in any good results,

00:26:27.521 --> 00:26:30.360
I don’t think, because it is also a mental projection.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.399
Like some people came to Me and said,

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.919
"Mother you are living in all luxury

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.760
and how is it you are so spiritual?"

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.840
I said, "What, what have you done in spirituality?"

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.639
He said, "I have given up my wife, I have given up my house,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.480
I have given up my car, I have given up everything.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.960
And now I am sitting before You here."

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.504
I said, "Really?

00:26:50.705 --> 00:26:53.360
"Well", I said, "now you worship Shri Krishna

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.240
and if you think anything worth the dust particle of Shri Krishna,

00:26:58.441 --> 00:26:59.677
you can take it from Me.

00:26:59.878 --> 00:27:02.447
But should be equal to the dust particle of His feet.

00:27:02.649 --> 00:27:05.517
That's one condition". He looked around everything,

00:27:05.719 --> 00:27:07.679
he said, "There is nothing equal to that part".

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.330
So I said, "What do you give up?

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.424
You give up stones. What do you give up?

00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:13.950
It is just a mental idea you have got in your head,

00:27:14.151 --> 00:27:16.520
that you are giving up this and giving up that".

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.280
In our Hindu concept,

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.400
our idea of ‘sanyasa’ is from within.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.996
As Janaka was called to be "Videhi"

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.000
and His daughter as "Vaidehi"

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.520
because though he lived with everything around,

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.760
inside he had given up everything.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.280
It is how you are detached,

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.400
because you are attached to your Spirit.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.373
You are not attached to anything it exists.

00:27:40.575 --> 00:27:43.504
Now supposing today, as he has told you that

00:27:43.705 --> 00:27:45.520
I may be living in great luxury,

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.367
but you will be amazed even if I have to go to villages in India,

00:27:48.568 --> 00:27:51.200
if I'll go and stay in villages, I can live anywhere.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.120
I can take my bath in a river, I can sleep on the streets

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.804
I have no problem of any kind.

00:27:56.006 --> 00:27:58.440
Because, you see, what is there in comfort?

00:27:58.641 --> 00:28:00.166
If it cannot crawl upon you,

00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:01.999
you cannot become slave of comfort

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.560
and you don’t see the value of this thing.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.360
But some people have told Me,

00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:09.371
and asked Me the way -

00:28:09.573 --> 00:28:11.671
it is a question that sometimes is very hurting -

00:28:11.872 --> 00:28:15.605
that, "When your country is such a spiritual country of yoga -

00:28:15.806 --> 00:28:16.999
you call it a ‘yoga bhumi’...

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.000
I say, "It is a ‘yoga bhumi’, no doubt".

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.199
"Then how is it you are so poor,

00:28:22.399 --> 00:28:26.238
your people are in troubles, and why are you suffering?"

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.200
The thing is, Krishna has said,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.040
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham”.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.320
He said, "When you get yoga,

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.840
you will get your ‘kshema’." Not ‘ksema’ first and then yoga.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.639
First you must get your yoga.

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:43.628
If we get our yoga, then only our wellbeing will be looked after.

00:28:43.829 --> 00:28:46.960
Krishna said very clearly. “Yoga kshemam vahamyam”.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.160
So first we have to get to our yoga.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.919
And those people who have tried to get yoga,

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.439
have improved in everything,

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.880
spiritually and materially, as well.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.078
Because within us is the power to give us everything,

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:08.368
knowledge, wellbeing, the joy

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.280
which is the quality of your Spirit.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.560
And once that joy starts pouring into you,

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.240
you get rid of all your problems,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.440
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.680
You must be knowing, perhaps,

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.560
that Sahaja Yoga has cured many patients of cancer,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.080
of leukemia and so many other diseases,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.680
by not giving any medicines whatsoever,

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.720
but only by awakening the Kundalini.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.680
Apart from that many mad people

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.455
have been cured through Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.618
There are many people who have been taking drugs,

00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:49.226
alcoholics they have been, they came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:49.427 --> 00:29:51.280
overnight they have given up everything.

00:29:51.481 --> 00:29:54.360
Because once you get the ultimate, the highest,

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.600
then you don’t indulge into all these things.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.084
And that is what it is.

00:29:58.285 --> 00:30:01.240
I have to request you all that you must also seek

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.600
the highest; and all other things you forget.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.800
Just now you forget all your differences

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.595
between say, formless and God with form.

00:30:10.796 --> 00:30:13.880
All these differences you forget. Just forget all the differences.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.560
First you get your Realization and then we'll talk about it.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.440
If should be something - there is a very simple analogy

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.920
that you come to this centre and it is all dark

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.815
and I ask you, "\What to do?".

00:30:26.016 --> 00:30:28.773
They said, "All right press this button and you will get the light.

00:30:28.974 --> 00:30:30.485
It is as simple as that.

00:30:30.686 --> 00:30:31.919
First you get the light

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.959
and then one can talk about the rest of the things,

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.320
what is to be done and how to develop the depthness.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.760
The birth of Sahaja Yoga started with only six people.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.880
For four years I was struggling with them.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.484
But today I am very proud to say that in England itself,

00:30:49.685 --> 00:30:52.096
I don’t know how many thousand people we have got,

00:30:52.297 --> 00:30:55.760
who are in peace, who are yogis, who are real yogis.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.882
They are not the ones who carry a "mala" (garland) and say,

00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:04.520
"I am this ananda, that ananda", all these names they don’t take.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.414
They don’t change their dresses, nothing. They are normal people.

00:31:07.615 --> 00:31:10.014
They live a normal life but they are yogis,

00:31:10.215 --> 00:31:13.480
because their awareness has become,

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:19.320
- now, I again say, it has become collectively conscious.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.639
They have achieved in their spiritual awareness

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.040
the collectively consciousness.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.560
And that has to happen.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:30.720
It is not giving any certificate.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.200
It is not giving a lecture. It cannot be a brain wash.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.080
Your Kundalini has to rise

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.710
and you yourself have to feel the cool breeze of the Kundalini,

00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:43.783
which is said as the ‘chaitanya Lahari’ or ‘Ananda lahari’,

00:31:43.984 --> 00:31:46.293
described by the, really I would say

00:31:46.494 --> 00:31:51.199
the one who has described it the most, is our Adi Shankaracharya.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.127
He is the one, we can say,

00:31:53.327 --> 00:31:56.839
the one who revived it into his, his [literature].

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.040
He has all the time described about Kundalini and talked about it.

00:32:01.613 --> 00:32:03.200
Hindus should be proud

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.640
that in their country there is such seers and such great people.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.520
But it is no use being just proud.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.840
It would be something like the lotuses in a pond, you see,

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.159
and a little worm thinks, “Oh! I am
in a pond where there are lotuses”.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.639
That's not the way.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.080
We have to be proud that we have to become the lotus.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.200
Hindus have very great responsibility in this country.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.040
You don’t know how much responsibility you have

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.440
about which I will talk to you in Hindi.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.956
But the main thing is, I would like to know,

00:32:35.157 --> 00:32:38.918
how many of you are really seeking God,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.120
really, innately, from within.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.040
And if you are seeking it is for your benefit,

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.006
that somehow or the other My husband got elected to this job

00:32:50.207 --> 00:32:52.960
and I came here and this work has started.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.127
But I am very sad to say that My disciples are many,

00:32:57.328 --> 00:32:59.920
out of which Indians are very, very few.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.840
And those who are really doing a substantial work

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.839
are mostly British people.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.149
It is surprising that they know more

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:14.620
about ‘chaitanya’ and 'omkhara' than we know about.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.856
It is not a very good thing.

00:33:17.056 --> 00:33:20.359
Tomorrow your children will ask you.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.240
I went to another lecture

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.788
where there were Muslims and Hindus, all sorts of people,

00:33:26.989 --> 00:33:28.803
and they were more worried about politics.

00:33:29.004 --> 00:33:30.289
All the ladies, I was surprised,

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.080
they were so politically worried about things.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.760
Now the political side of it also it is very simple to understand.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.880
All human politics is artificial, it has no meaning,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.919
because it deals with money.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.360
Whether the money should to be distributed to everyone,

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.234
or to be kept to one person is all that politics is.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.120
To Me is a child's play.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.600
Actually it is so artificial

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.600
that to a person like Me,

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.480
I cannot take it seriously.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.872
I'll tell you how.

00:33:58.073 --> 00:34:00.560
For example, now, supposing if I have My own powers

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.240
I am the greatest capitalist

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.510
because I have all the powers within Myself,

00:34:04.711 --> 00:34:07.600
because I can do what I like.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.520
But I am the greatest communist

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:12.313
because I cannot live alone, I can’t enjoy it Myself.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.560
I must distribute, I must give to others;

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.720
because this is love.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:19.159
This is love to be enjoyed,

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.760
when it is reflected in the eyes of other people.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.199
So this is the main politics.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.920
This is the work of God

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.040
and this is how He does His politics,

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.040
that He is a capitalist,

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.879
He has everything within Himself,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.600
He can do whatever He likes,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.880
but He wants to distribute it,

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.453
he wants to give it to others.

00:34:37.655 --> 00:34:40.800
And He wants to see that others reflect His love.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.360
And this is what it is the politics of God you should take to.

00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:47.561
Of course these mundane things of life, every day to day life,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.680
do disturb us and we feel upset about it

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.280
because you are in this country.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.960
But I assure you, if you take to Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.839
a new type of rapport will be established between you

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.277
and the Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:59.478 --> 00:35:01.440
It is a new family that is coming up in England

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.160
and it is a very strong family,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.960
and they are all, for Indians,

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.680
they have tremendous respect for you,

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.160
for various reasons of which you are not aware.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.469
They have tremendous respect for you.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.460
As it is, even if you are not Sahaja Yogis,

00:35:13.661 --> 00:35:15.165
they have tremendous respect.

00:35:15.366 --> 00:35:17.240
And that is how I feel that

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.240
I should really be very thankful to you sir,

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.320
for bringing Me here so that you have new friends

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.320
to give you a very brief reality here,

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.920
so that you understand each other and help each other

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:35.400
and bring forth the fruit of that Hindu philosophy.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.920
It is not an organized religion, it is a philosophy.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.650
And it is not even a philosophy,

00:35:39.851 --> 00:35:43.080
deep [down], it's the roots, if you understand.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.040
It sustains everything and helps everyone.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:53.439
Even Christ is described in the Devi Mahatmayam as Mahavishnu.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.359
But nobody knew about it,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.480
because it is such an organized religion

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.899
that they never wanted to see what Mahavishnu is.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.920
Same in India, nobody wanted to see what Christ is.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.680
What Mohammad Sahib is nothing but Dattatreya,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.880
and we can prove it on ‘Kundalini”

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.080
that they are all one and together.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.680
Christ has clearly said,

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.727
"Those who are not against Me, are with Me".

00:36:13.928 --> 00:36:15.098
Who are those?

00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:17.759
All these discoveries you have made through Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.484
and I hope you make your discoveries and understand

00:36:20.685 --> 00:36:25.240
that Hindu religion is not a thing to be put into a cup.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.236
It is a very vast thing.

00:36:27.437 --> 00:36:29.160
It will encompass everything,

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.960
if you understand the essences of it.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.036
But we have forgotten it has got roots

00:36:34.237 --> 00:36:37.698
and the roots must be understood how deep it is.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:42.348
Now I am going to tell you something in Hindi language,

00:36:42.549 --> 00:36:45.288
I hope so, I hope in this short time

00:36:45.489 --> 00:36:47.423
whatever is possible about Kundalini,

00:36:47.624 --> 00:36:50.683
because it is a very mysterious thing and one has to understand

00:36:50.884 --> 00:36:53.485
because people do not know that's why they call it mysterious

00:36:53.686 --> 00:36:55.680
but otherwise it is the easiest thing to do.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.840
And I would request you all to attend our programs.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.759
We have at different places,

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.320
at Caxton Hall and also

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:05.757
at Town Halls, we have programs.

00:37:05.958 --> 00:37:09.920
You please attend. Take it up seriously and learn about it,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:17.920
the deep roots that have sustained Hindu philosophy.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.479
Unless and until you know that, you will be always challenged.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.200
You challenge yourself.

00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:25.960
And tomorrow your own children will say, "It is all nonsense,

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.728
why did they go to a temple, why did they do worship?

00:37:28.929 --> 00:37:31.234
What is the need of talk of God? Where is God?

00:37:31.435 --> 00:37:33.360
But the time has come today.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.000
Not only to talk about God, but to prove the existence of God,

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.160
and the existence of ‘Chaitanya’.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.613
May God bless you all!

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.880
Now I will talk a little bit in Hindi,

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.279
and tell you things which I feel are not right.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.440
You have left your countries and have come here

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.120
and after coming to this country

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.240
the problems of this country are affecting you.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.120
I know this very well,

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.200
and I understand what you face,

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.240
but we must know the reason

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.960
why we are facing these problems.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.280
First of all, we must understand that

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.532
whichever country we are in,

00:38:25.733 --> 00:38:28.352
the biggest tradition our country has

00:38:28.553 --> 00:38:32.200
is that we have not come to this world to earn money.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.520
Earning money is not the purpose of our lives,

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.319
but achieving God is the aim of our lives.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.630
Rest of the things, earning money -

00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:43.680
in our country, many saints,

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.280
all of them have said that they are transitory,

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.000
and we should fall into it.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.000
Any bhajan is talking about this.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.919
You also see every day

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.640
those who have earned a lot, what state they are in.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.200
Looking at the children here, you can see

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.320
they have started taking drugs and doing all kinds of things.

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.360
The reason is the parents were chasing after money,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.000
completely after money,

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.080
and did not give attention and love to the children.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.960
When love went towards money, the children were left out.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.615
They did not mentor the children,

00:39:16.816 --> 00:39:18.814
so the children went the wrong way in life.

00:39:19.015 --> 00:39:21.920
Tomorrow your own children will take these ways, too.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.759
So much ego regarding money

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.960
never used to be in Indian people.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.160
We never worshipped the money.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.960
Humanity was most vital in our culture,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.040
and you must never forget that.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.959
Still, in our country today,

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.319
there are many thieves. You can't deny that.

00:39:38.521 --> 00:39:40.720
This is also because of you.

00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:43.479
Those who came abroad and tell

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.279
that people abroad live like this, these things are there...

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.960
Until our country was ruled by the English

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.640
our minds were not so polluted by these ideas.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.520
But once you people started going back to India

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.397
taking things from here to there,

00:39:57.598 --> 00:39:59.400
going there and praising the West,

00:39:59.601 --> 00:40:01.240
their brains went off.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.066
And now in India, you see, people are in such a state,

00:40:06.267 --> 00:40:08.459
that if you bring something from abroad,

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.960
even if it’s just a soap, they will show it to everybody.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.879
Don’t we have sandalwood in our country?

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.680
Don’t we have face packs in our country?

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.440
Don’t we have things that exist here,

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.319
that you need to boast about all these, to impress Indians,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.240
as if the West has something great?

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.015
I want to tell you all, clearly,

00:40:26.216 --> 00:40:28.824
that you have nothing to learn from the West.

00:40:29.025 --> 00:40:31.600
There is nothing worth learning in this country.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.346
You should understand very well that learning something here

00:40:34.547 --> 00:40:37.280
is dangerous, extremely dangerous.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.840
The wrongs they do, you too will do the same.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.040
In that dirt you will be stuck, unable to reach anywhere.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.240
So I warn you here today

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.440
that you should learn nothing from this country.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.080
If you have to learn anything, it should be that

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.440
these people who have made mistakes, have now returned to God.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.480
Similarly, by keeping the pride,

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.560
the pride of your nation, you will return to God Almighty.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.880
There is nothing more beautiful than that.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.879
I came here and found out

00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:10.073
that the wife of a disciple who came to Me,

00:41:10.274 --> 00:41:11.959
ran away with someone,

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.430
or somebody's husband ran away with someone,

00:41:14.631 --> 00:41:16.173
that some do not respect the elders.

00:41:16.374 --> 00:41:19.600
By doing all these you can be worse than them (English)!

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.654
I've met an officer, a minister actually. He told Me that

00:41:23.855 --> 00:41:26.170
it's a big concern that Sikhs don’t agree

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.692
to put anything (a cap) on their turbans,

00:41:28.893 --> 00:41:33.097
as it's not written in their religion.

00:41:33.298 --> 00:41:35.600
So I said, "In the religion it’s also written not to drink".

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.452
I told that minister to bring any Sikh who is not drinking,

00:41:38.652 --> 00:41:41.025
any Sikh who does not touch the alcohol.

00:41:41.226 --> 00:41:45.960
Not a single person who does not drink alcohol was found in London.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.960
By hiding like this behind religion,

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.263
by finding things to fight about, nothing can happen.

00:41:52.464 --> 00:41:54.159
The second thing I want to tell you

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.840
is that you don’t have proper knowledge about your traditions.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.520
Unless you have knowledge of your traditions,

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.200
who will respect you?

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.880
Morning till evening you keep copying these people.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.600
Then who will respect you?

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.120
You must know your own culture,

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.360
you must know what you were and what you are now.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.600
Indians can learn from you all.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.080
Instead, tell Indians about the faults here in the West.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.440
You influence them, and tell them you are not sitting in the heaven.

00:42:25.641 --> 00:42:29.511
I know some women who are cleaners in the airports,

00:42:29.712 --> 00:42:31.399
although they are brahmin caste.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.480
They belong to brahmin caste but they clean the airport!

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.160
In our country nobody will do this for money.

00:42:37.394 --> 00:42:40.000
I am not saying doing this kind of work is bad,

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.678
but they do it for money.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.160
If you do something for someone,

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.960
any kind of work serving others, is nothing wrong with it,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.240
but doing any kind of dirty job for money,

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.160
does not behoove Indians.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.280
I keep saying this to Indians and some have changed after that.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.200
But I am specially requesting you

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.440
because when you come to this country,

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:08.759
you are like a huge mirror for these people.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.130
They look up to you and think:

00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:14.760
"Oh, Indians are like this. Then why Mother is telling us off?"

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.520
Anything I tell them,

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.200
they come to know immediately where you stand.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:22.840
I have seen they are listening to classical music eagerly,

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.720
as our music is heavenly.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.480
It originates from Aum.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.480
Even though they don't understand ragas,

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.720
they enjoy even most difficult ragas.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.240
Here people tell Me that when Indians go for shopping,

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:45.120
their children buy strange, dirty music and dance to them there (India).

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.360
We should tell our children not to do that.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.360
This is the rule of our country

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.880
that we can raise the children the way we want.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.560
In our country liberty never meant

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.680
that you become offbeat, having no style or attitude left in you.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.760
It's called abandonment. It happens.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.708
We should not satisfy our children with games of the West,

00:44:03.909 --> 00:44:05.468
but make their characters.

00:44:05.669 --> 00:44:07.120
Among the Indians here,

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:13.840
if you are able to find a very special example of a good character,

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.360
then these westerners won't utter a word against you.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.759
We have spoiled our images ourselves.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.720
That day is not far when these people who worship you so much...

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.280
When they see you are Indians, they feel you are great.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.560
Because whatever happens, we still understand Ganapati.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.640
We know what is wrong.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.760
In India when we do a wrong deed, we don't say it's a good one.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.760
Here the situation is such that wrong deeds are called good!

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.280
They have made all kind of laws

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.200
that astonish you and you can't believe it.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:52.720
We can't believe that these can be good deeds.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.320
Listening for thousands of years from our ancestors,

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.680
these things are in our minds and blood.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.320
Being the truth they won't change so easily.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.280
But slowly we are getting affected by these people

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.880
instead of learning from our ancestors.

00:45:07.355 --> 00:45:09.760
So, I ask you with folded hands

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.653
become enthusiastic about your culture. Put your attention on it.

00:45:14.854 --> 00:45:17.864
Not only this, but achieve it in yourself after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:18.065 --> 00:45:21.920
Sahaja Yoga is the only thing which awakens the Kundalini in you.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.960
And you have your Spirit.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.240
After achieving your Spirit all questions disappear.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:32.176
The day the entire world will bow down to your country is not far.

00:45:32.447 --> 00:45:36.080
That day is not far! What can we compete with these people in?

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.080
You say you can compete in science.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.600
You can never do that as they are doing that since long.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.704
As we started going towards science,

00:45:43.904 --> 00:45:45.519
they went further to computers.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.680
But they cannot compete with us in spiritual knowledge.

00:45:51.042 --> 00:45:56.200
For that they must come to us and learn and become like us.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.407
They must accept our habits and manners.

00:45:58.607 --> 00:46:00.319
Otherwise they won't get it.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.479
The best way is to become a special person, a symbol of awakening.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.200
If that thing shines in you, they will say,

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.200
"These are Indians. This happens in India."

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:17.560
But I hope you people don't feel bad,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.440
Take it as a mother is talking to her child and accept it.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.879
You have to be wise and alert.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.080
Start practicing this.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.880
Nobody will dare move you from here or trouble you,

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.000
because they are all running to help you.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.359
If someone is hurt they will all come running to help you.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.600
Today at least 3 to 4 thousands people are standing here for you;

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.640
your brothers and sisters are here.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.840
But if you don't you don't have it (Realization),

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.080
then you are not worthy of being worshipped.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.229
I will ask the ladies and girls specifically.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.399
They have spoiled this country.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.000
In our country ladies have a very good position.

00:46:56.202 --> 00:46:58.560
Ladies are respected in India.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:03.200
Long time before the time of Manu (Noah), it was said about ladies,

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:09.320
"Where women are worshipped, there reside the Gods".

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.000
This is said, but ladies must be respectable.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.120
Don't learn from the dirty habits of women here.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.040
We are as powerful as the Mother Earth.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.359
We have immense capacity to absorb many things.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.389
Like these stupid women, fighting with their husband,

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:28.000
staying away from children, becoming westernized,

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.200
and learning all the bad things.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.080
A day will come when with five husbands or more,

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.600
they will end up in asylums and orphanages.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.280
It's important to understand that we are women and they are men.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.720
Of course male and female are alike.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.280
We can say they are equal, but not similar.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.456
Woman, you must know,

00:47:54.528 --> 00:47:58.031
is one wheel on the left side of the carriage,

00:47:58.232 --> 00:47:59.679
and men are on the right side.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.440
It doesn't mean men have the right to dominate the women.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.400
They suppressed the women, that's why they have this crisis.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.040
Men in our culture must understand that.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.439
Our social set-up must not ruin due to them.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:14.560
You must unlearn whatever you learned wrong from Muslims.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.280
And that place in our hearts which was for women...

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:21.040
Even before taking Rama's name, Sita's name is chanted.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.840
Before Krishna's name, we take Radha's name.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.400
That is why respecting women and the housewives,

00:48:27.601 --> 00:48:31.600
keeping them like that and respecting them, you will see,

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.440
that your children will start respecting you

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.960
and the entire world will be transformed.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.399
We have seen a change in these people,

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.960
who have never seen Indian traditions.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.120
You have all been Indians for a long time.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.600
Your grandfathers and great-grandfathers have grown up in India.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.320
This work will be easy for you.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:58.520
I am glad to see you all among them. Thousands more can be with you.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.200
I am standing with you in any of your troubles.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.840
For that, first of all become Indians,

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.360
the real kind of Indians.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.880
This does not mean that you become hostile to this country.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.160
In the end I will tell you that in Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.840
England is known as a very high place.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:22.160
Sahaja Yoga considers England as the heart of the universe.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.880
You will be surprised to know

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.120
that India is the Kundalini and Mooladhara, the place of Ganesha,

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.560
and England is the heart.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.160
That is why you people are here.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:39.479
But you must absorb good thoughts and qualities from here.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:46.160
You must share these healthy and good quality thoughts with people

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:51.600
so they can establish having a new shape and new form.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.520
Because of Sahaja Yoga their hearts have changed a lot.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.200
My husband used to think, "What can you teach these people?"

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:05.360
He used to laugh a lot, as I worked hard with six people for a year.

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:08.275
Now he can't say anything

00:50:08.476 --> 00:50:11.079
and he sees how they have changed.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.760
He says, "If I say anything against it, I will be a liar".

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.160
This is what it is.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.520
The truth is that doing Sahaja Yoga, one can change immediately.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:25.703
A person’s Spirit which is his Self, his guru,

00:50:25.904 --> 00:50:27.959
becomes enlightened and takes care.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.640
You cannot pay for it. You cannot give anything for it.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:38.200
You can only ask, "Give us our Spirit".

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.520
You can only ask for this.

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.720
Thank you all very much for listening to Me.
