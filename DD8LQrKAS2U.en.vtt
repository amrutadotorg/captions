02:26.557 --> 02:31.160
SY: ...of India, in the Constituent Assembly of India.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.480
Mataji, before She took up this message of spreading

02:35.680 --> 02:39.520
Hindu philosophy and Hindu thoughts,

02:39.840 --> 02:43.960
She was married in a very intellectually, prominent family

02:44.200 --> 02:51.079
and She was married to Shri C.P. Shrivastava.

02:51.280 --> 02:58.000
[Those of you] who know the post freedom leadership,

02:58.200 --> 03:00.600
among the IAS community,

03:00.800 --> 03:03.080
very well-known some of the names,

03:03.320 --> 03:05.720
and Shri C.P. Shrivastava's name

03:05.920 --> 03:09.200
was one of the most prominent names.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.248
He had the distinction of being

03:11.449 --> 03:15.480
the principal private secretary to Shastriji,

03:15.720 --> 03:18.000
Shri Lal Bhahadur Shastri.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.579
And only now after seeing his name, I remember Mataji.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.480
When I was a secretary Government Teachers' Foundation

03:24.680 --> 03:27.400
and we had a conference in Delhi,

03:27.600 --> 03:29.920
when we were invited to Shastriji’s house,

03:30.120 --> 03:33.009
it was Shrivastavaji who conducted the guests

03:33.210 --> 03:36.200
to the, to the house of Shastriji.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.654
And I have great pleasure that God creates situations,

03:39.855 --> 03:42.513
that we meet different people at different situation,

03:42.715 --> 03:45.680
just to prove that the world is so small.

03:45.880 --> 03:51.799
Shrivastavaji, after serving as a
distinguished person with Shastriji,

03:52.000 --> 03:56.753
then he was transferred to the, to the

03:58.160 --> 04:02.079
to the Shipping Corporation of India,

04:02.280 --> 04:03.920
where he was the secretary,

04:04.120 --> 04:07.880
and later on he was with the United Nation Agency,

04:08.080 --> 04:12.240
in the form of International Maritime Agency.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.800
Now this is the background of this intellectual family.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.600
As the holders of important positions in the government of India

04:19.800 --> 04:23.200
and in the International Assembly at the UNO,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.479
they must be coming in contact with

04:25.680 --> 04:28.960
highly prominent international personalities.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.640
And Mataji among them all,

04:31.840 --> 04:34.520
instead of glorifying Herself,

04:34.720 --> 04:37.600
in those positions of contacts and great places,

04:37.800 --> 04:41.680
Her bent of mind was towards spiritualism.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.960
And today [with the event], She lectures to us,

04:44.200 --> 04:48.760
when She tells us some of the mysteries of our teachings,

04:48.960 --> 04:54.159
we will have the occasion of knowing Her more of the message.

04:54.920 --> 04:59.760
Born near Nagpur, at a place called Chinddwara.

04:59.960 --> 05:04.799
She is younger than me

05:05.040 --> 05:10.600
and the glow of the charm of the spiritual world,

05:10.800 --> 05:12.720
as you see on Mataji’s face,

05:12.921 --> 05:17.121
it is a rare thing to find people so radiant invariably.

05:17.322 --> 05:21.002
And then She speaks to us [unclear].

05:21.440 --> 05:25.479
I welcome You Mataji on behalf of the members of the Hindu Center

05:25.679 --> 05:30.359
and before all the Hindu community principals.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.200
You are in the program

05:32.400 --> 05:35.640
and when the time comes we tell You, request You to come and speak.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.919
If You like to sit on the platform and speak.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.680
Or You would like to stand? As You like.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.520
It is also our practice to let you know

05:47.720 --> 05:49.440
as to what we have been doing

05:49.640 --> 05:54.360
during the month when we met you last and now.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.760
We celebrate the Independence Day in this country

05:59.960 --> 06:03.599
and the High Commissioner invites the various organizations

06:03.800 --> 06:07.960
to plan and organize the 15-th of August program.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.240
We were invited there and we did a promise

06:11.480 --> 06:15.840
that we will take part in whatever the activities are being done.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.791
We had a meeting at the Coffee House

06:18.992 --> 06:21.254
arranged by the founder of DfC (Department for Communities)

06:21.454 --> 06:23.439
on race equalities,

06:23.640 --> 06:26.560
which I attended on behalf the Hindu Centre.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.599
And at the New Life office,

06:29.800 --> 06:33.244
Ken Livingstone, [on the year] he was invited...

07:06.920 --> 07:09.680
First of all,

07:09.880 --> 07:16.721
I thank the coordinator and founder of the Hindu center.

07:19.677 --> 07:23.360
I give heartfelt thanks to all,

07:23.560 --> 07:29.825
as they have given Me an opportunity to meet and talk to you all.

07:30.676 --> 07:34.312
In the beginning I would like

07:34.525 --> 07:42.007
to talk in English to the guests about Kundalini.

07:42.320 --> 07:46.127
And after that I will talk in Hindi.

07:47.242 --> 07:50.720
If you all give Me the permission,

07:50.920 --> 07:57.367
I will tell to the Indians how they should live here.

08:05.139 --> 08:09.240
Kundalini is not a new thing

08:09.440 --> 08:13.960
or something that has started in the modern times.

08:14.160 --> 08:20.640
It's the most ancient science of spiritual life.

08:21.535 --> 08:27.005
It's not that it was not understood or seen

08:27.206 --> 08:31.585
in other places than India,

08:31.786 --> 08:35.039
that people knew about Kundalini.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.640
But the language used

08:38.840 --> 08:41.160
can confuse many people to think

08:41.360 --> 08:44.360
that Kundalini is something very localized

08:44.560 --> 08:48.119
or may be something nationalistic.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.746
In our country, historically if you see, I mean India,

08:54.947 --> 08:58.600
we had three types of movements brought in.

08:59.040 --> 09:06.046
The first movement on spiritual grounds was

09:06.248 --> 09:11.520
that of what we call the right side movement,

09:11.720 --> 09:16.313
meaning we were trying to control the nature.

09:17.740 --> 09:20.823
Or we were trying to control the nature

09:21.023 --> 09:22.532
through the will of God

09:22.733 --> 09:26.479
or through the will of that All Pervading Power,

09:26.680 --> 09:29.359
which we call as chaitanya.

09:29.560 --> 09:33.479
Accordingly we started having yajnas

09:33.680 --> 09:36.229
and other methods

09:36.430 --> 09:42.856
of invoking the Spirit of these elements,

09:43.057 --> 09:45.316
by which we could understand them

09:45.516 --> 09:48.682
and they could understand us.

09:49.666 --> 09:52.320
I feel the result of that, today we see,

09:52.520 --> 09:55.680
is the science that we have developed.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.766
The result of that, many seers in India saw

09:59.967 --> 10:03.280
so many things created in that great country.

10:03.481 --> 10:07.240
Much before we even started writing the history,

10:07.440 --> 10:10.320
they had created great aeroplanes

10:10.521 --> 10:12.560
and all kinds of pilotless,

10:12.760 --> 10:17.000
not bombs, but aeroplanes, in those days.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.578
That’s a fact.

10:18.779 --> 10:20.400
Of course it is difficult to face it,

10:20.600 --> 10:24.560
because people can’t believe it, that our country

10:24.760 --> 10:27.679
could have produced such great things.

10:27.880 --> 10:32.303
The second kind of movement started in India,

10:32.504 --> 10:37.097
was that of bhakti, of worshiping God.

10:37.336 --> 10:40.280
The people who were intellectuals,

10:40.480 --> 10:43.800
started working through the intellect,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.944
to create a rapport

10:47.145 --> 10:51.564
between human beings and the nature.

10:51.766 --> 10:54.501
And the other

10:55.720 --> 10:59.000
part of the people who were seekers,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.560
thought it is better

11:01.760 --> 11:04.360
to sing the praise of God

11:04.720 --> 11:08.120
and invite His grace upon us,

11:08.320 --> 11:10.880
so that the light of His love

11:11.080 --> 11:13.400
will expose all that is spiritual

11:13.600 --> 11:16.812
and higher than human awareness.

11:18.520 --> 11:21.960
And the third type of movement,

11:22.240 --> 11:25.280
which was very secretive in those days

11:25.480 --> 11:30.639
was the movement of evolutionary process,

11:30.840 --> 11:34.160
by which a human being was to make,

11:34.360 --> 11:38.831
to be made aware of his higher Self,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.400
that was his Spirit, his Atma,

11:41.600 --> 11:44.435
through Kundalini awakening.

11:44.641 --> 11:47.236
You will be amazed that at the time of Shri Rama,

11:47.437 --> 11:50.120
His own father-in-law, who was Raja Janaka,

11:50.321 --> 11:52.960
had one disciple called Nachiketa.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.259
And he asked that he would like to know about his Self,

11:56.460 --> 11:58.130
about his Atma.

11:58.331 --> 12:02.236
And Raja Janaka told him, "You can take all my wealth,

12:02.437 --> 12:04.394
you can take everything that I have,

12:04.595 --> 12:10.440
but please don’t ask me to give you enlightenment".

12:11.089 --> 12:13.126
But Nachiketa

12:13.327 --> 12:19.070
was very anxious and assiduous

12:19.280 --> 12:22.560
and he achieved his goal ultimately.

12:22.760 --> 12:24.744
So at the time of Raja Janaka, we can say,

12:24.944 --> 12:26.759
there were very few people,

12:26.960 --> 12:29.960
who really received their Self Realization.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.400
But on the whole, the people at that time, not being so complexed,

12:34.600 --> 12:37.760
by mental projections and other problems in life,

12:37.961 --> 12:41.720
they were very simple and were sensitive

12:42.560 --> 12:45.440
to the Divinity.

12:45.642 --> 12:47.840
They understood who Rama was,

12:48.040 --> 12:49.920
they understood who Sita was,

12:50.120 --> 12:53.200
and they understood what divine power was in those days.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.160
Though they did not aspire

12:56.360 --> 12:58.360
to be the Spirit, maybe,

12:58.560 --> 13:01.680
but they, so many of them knew about it.

13:02.062 --> 13:05.960
Now the Patanjali yoga, as described,

13:06.200 --> 13:09.640
is the yoga was practiced in our country thousands of years back,

13:09.840 --> 13:12.200
thousands and thousands of years back,

13:12.400 --> 13:16.967
when we had a very different type of a system existing.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.800
When we talk of yoga I see here

13:20.000 --> 13:22.613
some sort of a exercise people do.

13:22.814 --> 13:23.959
I am really amazed,

13:24.160 --> 13:27.331
it has nothing to do with yoga at all.

13:28.264 --> 13:30.880
Patanjali yoga has got

13:31.081 --> 13:36.480
eight-fold processes - Ashtangas.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.050
Out of that

13:38.251 --> 13:41.358
the first and the foremost is Ishwara Pragnya,

13:41.560 --> 13:44.520
meaning you must establish your Ishwara within yourself.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.888
Means, your Ishwara means the Spirit.

13:47.089 --> 13:49.119
The Spirit must be first established

13:49.319 --> 13:51.878
and then all the other seven followed.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.640
Yama, Niyama are there,

13:53.840 --> 13:55.760
which are very strict

13:55.960 --> 13:58.400
and if you read them, you can think that

13:58.600 --> 14:02.080
hardly one or two persons in the whole world can follow that,

14:02.280 --> 14:04.363
and people can get a shock to know that

14:04.564 --> 14:06.550
you don’t have to lead a married life,

14:06.750 --> 14:08.310
and all those things were there.

14:08.511 --> 14:12.319
But because in those days there were hardly one or two persons only

14:12.520 --> 14:14.357
who could get to that kind of thing,

14:14.558 --> 14:16.520
all these austere methods were given

14:16.760 --> 14:18.439
and were practiced in those days,

14:18.641 --> 14:21.560
and people did achieve their highest goal,

14:21.760 --> 14:24.480
by first getting their Self-Realization

14:24.680 --> 14:28.359
and then going through the different training

14:28.560 --> 14:31.839
of their life style,

14:32.040 --> 14:34.719
to achieve the ultimate.

14:36.888 --> 14:40.680
So to say that Hatha Yoga means only standing on your heads,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.407
it's a very wrong, wrong idea about yoga.

14:43.608 --> 14:48.800
Yoga is a word, comes from the word yuthi - joining.

14:49.160 --> 14:53.319
When your attention

14:54.387 --> 14:56.880
is enlightened by the Spirit

14:57.080 --> 14:59.400
or when you,

15:00.440 --> 15:04.400
the Jeevatma, becomes one with the Spirit

15:04.600 --> 15:06.403
or with the Divine Power,

15:06.604 --> 15:09.244
then it is the real yoga.

15:09.678 --> 15:12.640
The another meaning of the word yoga is -

15:12.840 --> 15:14.760
which is being now misused -

15:14.960 --> 15:17.520
kaushalam, means the depthness.

15:17.720 --> 15:21.640
Those who first got their Realization

15:21.840 --> 15:26.160
had to know the methods and the laws

15:26.400 --> 15:29.800
that govern human beings on the divine level,

15:30.000 --> 15:33.273
means the divine laws, how they are acting

15:33.474 --> 15:35.302
and how you have to utilize them.

15:35.503 --> 15:39.795
And this knowledge was the real yoga kaushalam,

15:39.996 --> 15:43.920
or the depthness about divine laws, how to operate them.

15:44.401 --> 15:49.120
As the time passed by, many things disappeared into thin air,

15:49.320 --> 15:51.671
and the great seers and yogis disappeared also

15:51.872 --> 15:54.120
in the Himalayas and all farfetched caves,

15:54.320 --> 15:57.840
because they thought human beings
are incapable of understanding them.

15:58.040 --> 16:02.285
Now those half baked people who went round to them -

16:02.486 --> 16:04.760
they tried their level best to convince them

16:04.960 --> 16:07.720
that yoga is to be done

16:07.920 --> 16:10.479
only on the spiritual level to begin with,

16:10.680 --> 16:13.520
and once the Kundalini rises in this yoga,

16:13.720 --> 16:16.400
then only you know what problems you have

16:16.600 --> 16:18.720
and what it is related to,

16:18.920 --> 16:23.142
and then accordingly you have to do the ‘yama’ and ‘niyama’.

16:23.344 --> 16:25.400
Now two words ‘yama’ and ‘niyama’,

16:25.600 --> 16:29.399
one relates to the collectivity, to the ‘samastha’

16:29.600 --> 16:32.080
and the ‘niyama’ relates to a human being.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.880
That means what you have to follow in your regular life

16:36.080 --> 16:38.640
is the ’niyama’  in your person,

16:38.840 --> 16:40.680
what you have to change.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.831
And the ‘yama’  is where, how much

16:44.032 --> 16:47.331
you have to bother about others, the society

16:48.440 --> 16:52.400
in which you live, the people with whom you have to relate.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.640
All that sort of a system doesn’t exist today.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.680
Because in those days, as you know,

16:58.881 --> 17:01.313
there was complete ‘brahmacharya’ for the students

17:01.514 --> 17:04.640
till the age of about 22-25 years, when they got married,

17:04.839 --> 17:06.264
to such an extent,

17:06.465 --> 17:09.142
that even the university in which the children studied

17:09.344 --> 17:11.680
was called by 'their gotra’.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.120
For example My ‘gotra’ is Sandilya.

17:14.319 --> 17:16.919
Now even today I cannot marry in the same ‘gotra’.

17:17.119 --> 17:21.178
Means in one university, you could not marry another person,

17:21.380 --> 17:22.983
for generations together.

17:23.184 --> 17:26.536
Such a kind of a pure celibacy was exercised

17:26.737 --> 17:28.200
till the age of 25.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.440
But after marriage

17:30.640 --> 17:32.280
people did not talk of these things.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.840
This was only till the age of 25 years,

17:35.040 --> 17:41.475
a kind of education, in Patanjali style of university, was given.

17:42.155 --> 17:46.276
So, today we are faced with the modern life.

17:46.477 --> 17:49.400
And in the modern life to talk of Patanjali yoga,

17:49.600 --> 17:51.600
as it was and as should be,

17:51.800 --> 17:54.026
is a very, very difficult thing.

17:54.227 --> 17:56.640
We can’t expect people to give up their families,

17:56.840 --> 17:58.486
run away from their families,

17:58.688 --> 18:03.560
go to the remote corners of Himalayas and meditate.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.520
This is not the time for that.

18:05.720 --> 18:10.160
And the problem of the Divine is this,

18:10.360 --> 18:12.399
that after creating this great world,

18:12.600 --> 18:15.080
after creating human beings,

18:15.280 --> 18:21.399
He finds that in our seeking we have gone astray, everywhere.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.192
I would not even say that in India we have not gone astray.

18:24.393 --> 18:26.296
Everywhere we have gone astray

18:26.497 --> 18:29.594
and we have to accept that we have gone to extremes

18:29.856 --> 18:31.131
in all our seeking,

18:31.332 --> 18:33.677
whether it is Christianity, Hinduism or any religion.

18:33.878 --> 18:36.240
We have gone to extremes and we have committed mistakes

18:36.440 --> 18:38.785
and the time has come for us to look back

18:38.986 --> 18:41.262
and see where are we.

18:42.440 --> 18:45.601
When I was born as a child,

18:47.160 --> 18:50.440
I felt now the time has come for people

18:50.640 --> 18:52.440
to get en-masse Realization.

18:52.641 --> 18:54.600
Otherwise there is no saving,

18:54.800 --> 18:57.480
because whatever has happened has happened, doesn’t matter.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.200
Wherever they are doesn’t matter.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.880
They have to get to their Spirit,

19:01.080 --> 19:03.439
otherwise you cannot talk to them about God.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.760
This is a fact.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.800
Today if you talk to young people -

19:07.000 --> 19:10.280
now you see this church, this has become a Hindu center.

19:10.481 --> 19:13.563
And also Hindus as such today are,

19:13.764 --> 19:15.723
their children, if you see them,

19:15.923 --> 19:19.000
they are not interested in religion, they are not interested in God.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.000
And we must face the reality as it is

19:21.200 --> 19:23.760
and not have our own imagination about it,

19:23.960 --> 19:27.600
because in that imagination we will lose the whole thing.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.000
So today, when the world is so pressurized,

19:31.200 --> 19:32.840
with all kinds of conflicts,

19:33.040 --> 19:34.920
and all kinds of funny ideas,

19:35.120 --> 19:40.209
and all kinds of unholy attack on human beings,

19:40.411 --> 19:42.400
what is the solution?

19:42.680 --> 19:44.880
To give people the Self Realization.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.320
As they are, wherever they are,

19:47.560 --> 19:50.120
they have to have their Realization.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.402
And I decided that I'll work

19:52.603 --> 19:56.319
on the permutations and combinations of the problems,

19:56.520 --> 20:00.920
of all the people, what problems they have,

20:01.120 --> 20:05.363
what we are, what they are suffering from and...

20:05.565 --> 20:08.280
Can you remove the child, please?

20:10.080 --> 20:11.562
What...

20:20.914 --> 20:23.591
Just take the child [a bit faster]. Better take her out.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.380
That is better.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.579
So the problems of today

20:43.780 --> 20:45.520
are to be faced as they are

20:45.720 --> 20:48.240
and a solution has to be found out.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.720
As I told you,

20:49.920 --> 20:52.880
through My meditative powers

20:53.080 --> 20:55.320
or we can say meditative surrendering,

20:55.520 --> 21:00.320
I found out that human beings have very few problems.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.404
And wherever they are, under whatever circumstances,

21:03.605 --> 21:05.205
whatever they have done,

21:05.406 --> 21:07.720
whatever mistakes so-called they have committed,

21:07.920 --> 21:10.480
whatever anti-God activities they have taken to,

21:10.680 --> 21:15.324
it is now absolutely essential

21:15.525 --> 21:18.120
that they have to get their Self Realization.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.960
No use talking about God,

21:20.161 --> 21:23.400
no use talking about divine power,

21:23.600 --> 21:26.679
and no use telling them that, "You must balance your life.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.120
Don’t do this and don’t do that", like all the Ten Commandments.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.480
"Take to a [new start], take to this, take to that".

21:32.680 --> 21:34.240
Nobody is going to listen to.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.080
This is what I found out,

21:37.280 --> 21:39.040
and that is how I have worked out

21:39.240 --> 21:41.040
all the permutations and combinations

21:41.240 --> 21:46.436
that are hindering the growth of human beings

21:46.637 --> 21:49.894
into a higher realm of Self.

21:50.608 --> 21:52.240
And when I worked it out

21:52.440 --> 21:55.560
I was amazed that it's very little to be done.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.440
Human beings are already ready to be there.

21:58.641 --> 22:00.680
But the biggest thing

22:00.920 --> 22:02.853
that human beings have to have

22:03.059 --> 22:05.519
is the desire to change.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.880
As he said that

22:08.080 --> 22:12.080
I am related also to very sophisticated people

22:12.280 --> 22:14.280
of London and all over the world,

22:14.480 --> 22:16.323
but what I found among them,

22:16.524 --> 22:18.042
they have no desire to change.

22:18.243 --> 22:20.439
They are so self-satisfied and self-opinionated.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.760
They have no desire to change themselves

22:22.960 --> 22:24.560
nor the world, nor any.

22:24.761 --> 22:27.120
So no question of talking these things to them.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.560
But there's a category of special people

22:29.760 --> 22:32.000
who are called as "seekers" today,

22:32.200 --> 22:36.280
whom William Blake has called as "the men of God",

22:36.680 --> 22:38.520
that, "they have to become the prophets

22:38.720 --> 22:41.280
and they will have powers to make others prophets".

22:41.480 --> 22:44.800
And that time, that prophecy can be fulfilled today

22:45.000 --> 22:47.520
in this England, which is the Jerusalem.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.840
To Me when I am in England, I must say I am English,

22:51.040 --> 22:53.378
and all the problems of England, I face them

22:53.579 --> 22:55.919
as any English seer would like to see.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.280
At the time of Blake, as he saw it,

22:58.480 --> 23:01.317
I could see the same way.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.346
Now, when this Kundalini,

23:03.546 --> 23:07.653
which is placed within us in the sacrum bone,

23:07.854 --> 23:12.960
is awakened by some enlightened person,

23:13.200 --> 23:16.600
then She pierces through the fontanel bone area,

23:16.800 --> 23:20.919
which is called in Sanskrit as ‘Brahmarandra’,

23:22.640 --> 23:25.883
you get your real baptism as they call it.

23:26.084 --> 23:27.335
This is what Christ said,

23:27.536 --> 23:29.684
"You have to be baptized, you have to be born again".

23:29.885 --> 23:32.891
But it does not mean that anybody puts their hand on your head

23:33.092 --> 23:36.000
or makes you wear Indian [unclear], you are born again.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.007
It's happening. We must understand,

23:38.208 --> 23:40.008
as all reasonable, sensible people,

23:40.209 --> 23:42.120
we must understand that is not real.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.720
It is some sort of an artificial ceremony,

23:44.921 --> 23:48.224
which is symbolic of something real behind it.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.440
So to have the real ceremony, what do we do?

23:52.640 --> 23:55.160
To have the real ceremony,

23:55.361 --> 23:57.162
there must be some method within us,

23:57.363 --> 24:00.811
and that method is already built in within us.

24:01.822 --> 24:03.574
All the scientist can ask a question,

24:03.776 --> 24:05.407
a simple questions to themselves,

24:05.608 --> 24:08.960
"Why God has made us human beings from amoeba to this stage?"

24:09.200 --> 24:12.520
What is the purpose of God to make us a human being?

24:12.720 --> 24:16.120
And the answer? Then we say, "We don’t know".

24:16.320 --> 24:18.360
But perhaps if somebody says,

24:18.560 --> 24:22.040
that one [can know] this answer is

24:22.240 --> 24:24.360
that you are made like this,

24:24.560 --> 24:28.159
you are in a transition to become the Spirit.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.520
When this instrument is put here and made,

24:31.720 --> 24:34.680
it has to be put to the mains, otherwise it doesn’t work.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.960
First of all you should be put to the mains,

24:37.160 --> 24:39.040
otherwise whatever you are doing,

24:39.240 --> 24:42.440
you are doing it in a relative world, not in an absolute world.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.480
Once you become one with that

24:45.681 --> 24:48.920
then your whole language is

24:49.120 --> 24:53.600
- like Kabera says - is so much there.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.879
You can see he was a realized soul,

24:56.080 --> 24:59.995
and when he was a realized soul he spoke with such authority,

25:00.196 --> 25:02.959
with such understanding of the Divine.

25:03.160 --> 25:06.200
And when he said something, people never understood him.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.240
They used to laugh at him, mock at him.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.920
They have crucified people, they have beaten them.

25:11.120 --> 25:14.439
We have done, not only in England, it is done everywhere.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.000
So the basis of all that

25:17.200 --> 25:20.591
is a simple ignorance, agyan ka,

25:21.360 --> 25:23.039
that there is God,

25:23.239 --> 25:26.199
that there is All pervading Power, [it is so kind],

25:26.400 --> 25:28.280
which we have to feel for the first time,

25:28.480 --> 25:30.400
you feel after the Kundalini awakening.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.070
Before that it doesn’t happen.

25:33.271 --> 25:36.120
So Patanjali yoga will be used in the sense that

25:36.320 --> 25:37.868
once you get your Realization,

25:38.069 --> 25:40.200
you have to understand how to maintain it.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.066
You don’t have to give up your families.

25:42.267 --> 25:44.509
On the contrary, in Sahaja yoga, if you are not married,

25:44.710 --> 25:46.760
I find it's difficult to give you Realization.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.987
It is surprising, in the whole of England,

25:49.188 --> 25:52.248
where we have thousands of people who have got Realization,

25:52.449 --> 25:54.520
there's only one person who is not yet married,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.264
hasn’t got Realization.

25:56.465 --> 25:59.625
So those who don’t marry are in little bit in imbalances, we think.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.520
They are on extreme sometimes,

26:01.720 --> 26:04.960
so you are supposed to marry after a certain age.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.880
Not only that, but you have to lead a very, very normal life.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.600
All the great saints of India have been married people,

26:12.800 --> 26:16.520
like Nanaka was a married man, Kabira was a married man,

26:16.720 --> 26:18.311
Janaka was a married man.

26:18.512 --> 26:22.720
Even the incarnations like Rama, Krishna, all of them were married.

26:22.920 --> 26:27.320
So to say that austerity is going to bring in any good results,

26:27.521 --> 26:30.360
I don’t think, because it is also a mental projection.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.399
Like some people came to Me and said,

26:32.600 --> 26:34.919
"Mother you are living in all luxury

26:35.120 --> 26:37.760
and how is it you are so spiritual?"

26:37.960 --> 26:40.840
I said, "What, what have you done in spirituality?"

26:41.040 --> 26:43.639
He said, "I have given up my wife, I have given up my house,

26:43.880 --> 26:46.480
I have given up my car, I have given up everything.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.960
And now I am sitting before You here."

26:49.160 --> 26:50.504
I said, "Really?

26:50.705 --> 26:53.360
"Well", I said, "now you worship Shri Krishna

26:53.560 --> 26:58.240
and if you think anything worth the dust particle of Shri Krishna,

26:58.441 --> 26:59.677
you can take it from Me.

26:59.878 --> 27:02.447
But should be equal to the dust particle of His feet.

27:02.649 --> 27:05.517
That's one condition". He looked around everything,

27:05.719 --> 27:07.679
he said, "There is nothing equal to that part".

27:07.880 --> 27:09.330
So I said, "What do you give up?

27:09.530 --> 27:11.424
You give up stones. What do you give up?

27:11.625 --> 27:13.950
It is just a mental idea you have got in your head,

27:14.151 --> 27:16.520
that you are giving up this and giving up that".

27:16.720 --> 27:21.280
In our Hindu concept,

27:21.480 --> 27:24.400
our idea of ‘sanyasa’ is from within.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.996
As Janaka was called to be "Videhi"

27:27.200 --> 27:29.000
and His daughter as "Vaidehi"

27:29.200 --> 27:31.520
because though he lived with everything around,

27:31.720 --> 27:33.760
inside he had given up everything.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.280
It is how you are detached,

27:35.480 --> 27:37.400
because you are attached to your Spirit.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.373
You are not attached to anything it exists.

27:40.575 --> 27:43.504
Now supposing today, as he has told you that

27:43.705 --> 27:45.520
I may be living in great luxury,

27:45.720 --> 27:48.367
but you will be amazed even if I have to go to villages in India,

27:48.568 --> 27:51.200
if I'll go and stay in villages, I can live anywhere.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.120
I can take my bath in a river, I can sleep on the streets

27:54.320 --> 27:55.804
I have no problem of any kind.

27:56.006 --> 27:58.440
Because, you see, what is there in comfort?

27:58.641 --> 28:00.166
If it cannot crawl upon you,

28:00.367 --> 28:01.999
you cannot become slave of comfort

28:02.200 --> 28:04.560
and you don’t see the value of this thing.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.360
But some people have told Me,

28:07.561 --> 28:09.371
and asked Me the way -

28:09.573 --> 28:11.671
it is a question that sometimes is very hurting -

28:11.872 --> 28:15.605
that, "When your country is such a spiritual country of yoga -

28:15.806 --> 28:16.999
you call it a ‘yoga bhumi’...

28:17.200 --> 28:20.000
I say, "It is a ‘yoga bhumi’, no doubt".

28:20.200 --> 28:22.199
"Then how is it you are so poor,

28:22.399 --> 28:26.238
your people are in troubles, and why are you suffering?"

28:26.440 --> 28:28.200
The thing is, Krishna has said,

28:28.400 --> 28:31.040
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham”.

28:31.240 --> 28:34.320
He said, "When you get yoga,

28:34.520 --> 28:37.840
you will get your ‘kshema’." Not ‘ksema’ first and then yoga.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.639
First you must get your yoga.

28:39.839 --> 28:43.628
If we get our yoga, then only our wellbeing will be looked after.

28:43.829 --> 28:46.960
Krishna said very clearly. “Yoga kshemam vahamyam”.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.160
So first we have to get to our yoga.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.919
And those people who have tried to get yoga,

28:52.120 --> 28:54.439
have improved in everything,

28:54.640 --> 28:56.880
spiritually and materially, as well.

28:57.080 --> 29:02.078
Because within us is the power to give us everything,

29:02.279 --> 29:08.368
knowledge, wellbeing, the joy

29:09.200 --> 29:13.280
which is the quality of your Spirit.

29:13.480 --> 29:16.560
And once that joy starts pouring into you,

29:16.800 --> 29:19.240
you get rid of all your problems,

29:19.440 --> 29:23.440
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.680
You must be knowing, perhaps,

29:25.880 --> 29:29.560
that Sahaja Yoga has cured many patients of cancer,

29:29.760 --> 29:33.080
of leukemia and so many other diseases,

29:33.280 --> 29:35.680
by not giving any medicines whatsoever,

29:35.880 --> 29:38.720
but only by awakening the Kundalini.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.680
Apart from that many mad people

29:40.880 --> 29:43.455
have been cured through Sahaja Yoga.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.618
There are many people who have been taking drugs,

29:46.819 --> 29:49.226
alcoholics they have been, they came to Sahaja Yoga,

29:49.427 --> 29:51.280
overnight they have given up everything.

29:51.481 --> 29:54.360
Because once you get the ultimate, the highest,

29:54.560 --> 29:56.600
then you don’t indulge into all these things.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.084
And that is what it is.

29:58.285 --> 30:01.240
I have to request you all that you must also seek

30:01.480 --> 30:03.600
the highest; and all other things you forget.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.800
Just now you forget all your differences

30:06.000 --> 30:10.595
between say, formless and God with form.

30:10.796 --> 30:13.880
All these differences you forget. Just forget all the differences.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.560
First you get your Realization and then we'll talk about it.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.440
If should be something - there is a very simple analogy

30:20.640 --> 30:23.920
that you come to this centre and it is all dark

30:24.160 --> 30:25.815
and I ask you, "\What to do?".

30:26.016 --> 30:28.773
They said, "All right press this button and you will get the light.

30:28.974 --> 30:30.485
It is as simple as that.

30:30.686 --> 30:31.919
First you get the light

30:32.120 --> 30:34.959
and then one can talk about the rest of the things,

30:35.160 --> 30:39.320
what is to be done and how to develop the depthness.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.760
The birth of Sahaja Yoga started with only six people.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.880
For four years I was struggling with them.

30:45.080 --> 30:49.484
But today I am very proud to say that in England itself,

30:49.685 --> 30:52.096
I don’t know how many thousand people we have got,

30:52.297 --> 30:55.760
who are in peace, who are yogis, who are real yogis.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.882
They are not the ones who carry a "mala" (garland) and say,

30:59.083 --> 31:04.520
"I am this ananda, that ananda", all these names they don’t take.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.414
They don’t change their dresses, nothing. They are normal people.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.014
They live a normal life but they are yogis,

31:10.215 --> 31:13.480
because their awareness has become,

31:13.680 --> 31:19.320
- now, I again say, it has become collectively conscious.

31:19.520 --> 31:23.639
They have achieved in their spiritual awareness

31:23.840 --> 31:26.040
the collectively consciousness.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.560
And that has to happen.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.720
It is not giving any certificate.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.200
It is not giving a lecture. It cannot be a brain wash.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.080
Your Kundalini has to rise

31:36.280 --> 31:39.710
and you yourself have to feel the cool breeze of the Kundalini,

31:39.911 --> 31:43.783
which is said as the ‘chaitanya Lahari’ or ‘Ananda lahari’,

31:43.984 --> 31:46.293
described by the, really I would say

31:46.494 --> 31:51.199
the one who has described it the most, is our Adi Shankaracharya.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.127
He is the one, we can say,

31:53.327 --> 31:56.839
the one who revived it into his, his [literature].

31:57.040 --> 32:01.040
He has all the time described about Kundalini and talked about it.

32:01.613 --> 32:03.200
Hindus should be proud

32:03.400 --> 32:06.640
that in their country there is such seers and such great people.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.520
But it is no use being just proud.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.840
It would be something like the lotuses in a pond, you see,

32:13.040 --> 32:17.159
and a little worm thinks, “Oh! I am
in a pond where there are lotuses”.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.639
That's not the way.

32:18.840 --> 32:22.080
We have to be proud that we have to become the lotus.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.200
Hindus have very great responsibility in this country.

32:25.400 --> 32:28.040
You don’t know how much responsibility you have

32:28.240 --> 32:30.440
about which I will talk to you in Hindi.

32:30.640 --> 32:34.956
But the main thing is, I would like to know,

32:35.157 --> 32:38.918
how many of you are really seeking God,

32:39.120 --> 32:42.120
really, innately, from within.

32:42.320 --> 32:46.040
And if you are seeking it is for your benefit,

32:46.240 --> 32:50.006
that somehow or the other My husband got elected to this job

32:50.207 --> 32:52.960
and I came here and this work has started.

32:53.200 --> 32:57.127
But I am very sad to say that My disciples are many,

32:57.328 --> 32:59.920
out of which Indians are very, very few.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.840
And those who are really doing a substantial work

33:03.040 --> 33:05.839
are mostly British people.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.149
It is surprising that they know more

33:09.350 --> 33:14.620
about ‘chaitanya’ and 'omkhara' than we know about.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.856
It is not a very good thing.

33:17.056 --> 33:20.359
Tomorrow your children will ask you.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.240
I went to another lecture

33:22.440 --> 33:26.788
where there were Muslims and Hindus, all sorts of people,

33:26.989 --> 33:28.803
and they were more worried about politics.

33:29.004 --> 33:30.289
All the ladies, I was surprised,

33:30.490 --> 33:33.080
they were so politically worried about things.

33:33.280 --> 33:36.760
Now the political side of it also it is very simple to understand.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.880
All human politics is artificial, it has no meaning,

33:40.080 --> 33:41.919
because it deals with money.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.360
Whether the money should to be distributed to everyone,

33:44.560 --> 33:47.234
or to be kept to one person is all that politics is.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.120
To Me is a child's play.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.600
Actually it is so artificial

33:51.800 --> 33:54.600
that to a person like Me,

33:54.800 --> 33:56.480
I cannot take it seriously.

33:56.680 --> 33:57.872
I'll tell you how.

33:58.073 --> 34:00.560
For example, now, supposing if I have My own powers

34:00.760 --> 34:02.240
I am the greatest capitalist

34:02.440 --> 34:04.510
because I have all the powers within Myself,

34:04.711 --> 34:07.600
because I can do what I like.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.520
But I am the greatest communist

34:09.719 --> 34:12.313
because I cannot live alone, I can’t enjoy it Myself.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.560
I must distribute, I must give to others;

34:14.760 --> 34:16.720
because this is love.

34:17.159 --> 34:19.159
This is love to be enjoyed,

34:19.360 --> 34:21.760
when it is reflected in the eyes of other people.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.199
So this is the main politics.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.920
This is the work of God

34:26.120 --> 34:28.040
and this is how He does His politics,

34:28.239 --> 34:30.040
that He is a capitalist,

34:30.239 --> 34:31.879
He has everything within Himself,

34:32.080 --> 34:33.600
He can do whatever He likes,

34:33.800 --> 34:35.880
but He wants to distribute it,

34:36.080 --> 34:37.453
he wants to give it to others.

34:37.655 --> 34:40.800
And He wants to see that others reflect His love.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.360
And this is what it is the politics of God you should take to.

34:44.561 --> 34:47.561
Of course these mundane things of life, every day to day life,

34:47.800 --> 34:49.680
do disturb us and we feel upset about it

34:49.880 --> 34:51.280
because you are in this country.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.960
But I assure you, if you take to Sahaja Yoga,

34:55.159 --> 34:57.839
a new type of rapport will be established between you

34:58.040 --> 34:59.277
and the Sahaja Yogis.

34:59.478 --> 35:01.440
It is a new family that is coming up in England

35:01.640 --> 35:03.160
and it is a very strong family,

35:03.360 --> 35:04.960
and they are all, for Indians,

35:05.160 --> 35:06.680
they have tremendous respect for you,

35:06.880 --> 35:09.160
for various reasons of which you are not aware.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.469
They have tremendous respect for you.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.460
As it is, even if you are not Sahaja Yogis,

35:13.661 --> 35:15.165
they have tremendous respect.

35:15.366 --> 35:17.240
And that is how I feel that

35:17.440 --> 35:20.240
I should really be very thankful to you sir,

35:20.440 --> 35:23.320
for bringing Me here so that you have new friends

35:23.520 --> 35:26.320
to give you a very brief reality here,

35:26.520 --> 35:29.920
so that you understand each other and help each other

35:30.120 --> 35:35.400
and bring forth the fruit of that Hindu philosophy.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.920
It is not an organized religion, it is a philosophy.

35:38.120 --> 35:39.650
And it is not even a philosophy,

35:39.851 --> 35:43.080
deep [down], it's the roots, if you understand.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.040
It sustains everything and helps everyone.

35:47.240 --> 35:53.439
Even Christ is described in the Devi Mahatmayam as Mahavishnu.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.359
But nobody knew about it,

35:55.560 --> 35:57.480
because it is such an organized religion

35:57.680 --> 35:59.899
that they never wanted to see what Mahavishnu is.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.920
Same in India, nobody wanted to see what Christ is.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.680
What Mohammad Sahib is nothing but Dattatreya,

36:05.880 --> 36:07.880
and we can prove it on ‘Kundalini”

36:08.080 --> 36:10.080
that they are all one and together.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.680
Christ has clearly said,

36:11.880 --> 36:13.727
"Those who are not against Me, are with Me".

36:13.928 --> 36:15.098
Who are those?

36:15.299 --> 36:17.759
All these discoveries you have made through Sahaja Yoga,

36:17.960 --> 36:20.484
and I hope you make your discoveries and understand

36:20.685 --> 36:25.240
that Hindu religion is not a thing to be put into a cup.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.236
It is a very vast thing.

36:27.437 --> 36:29.160
It will encompass everything,

36:29.360 --> 36:30.960
if you understand the essences of it.

36:31.160 --> 36:34.036
But we have forgotten it has got roots

36:34.237 --> 36:37.698
and the roots must be understood how deep it is.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.348
Now I am going to tell you something in Hindi language,

36:42.549 --> 36:45.288
I hope so, I hope in this short time

36:45.489 --> 36:47.423
whatever is possible about Kundalini,

36:47.624 --> 36:50.683
because it is a very mysterious thing and one has to understand

36:50.884 --> 36:53.485
because people do not know that's why they call it mysterious

36:53.686 --> 36:55.680
but otherwise it is the easiest thing to do.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.840
And I would request you all to attend our programs.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.759
We have at different places,

37:00.960 --> 37:03.320
at Caxton Hall and also

37:03.521 --> 37:05.757
at Town Halls, we have programs.

37:05.958 --> 37:09.920
You please attend. Take it up seriously and learn about it,

37:10.120 --> 37:17.920
the deep roots that have sustained Hindu philosophy.

37:18.120 --> 37:21.479
Unless and until you know that, you will be always challenged.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.200
You challenge yourself.

37:23.401 --> 37:25.960
And tomorrow your own children will say, "It is all nonsense,

37:26.160 --> 37:28.728
why did they go to a temple, why did they do worship?

37:28.929 --> 37:31.234
What is the need of talk of God? Where is God?

37:31.435 --> 37:33.360
But the time has come today.

37:33.560 --> 37:37.000
Not only to talk about God, but to prove the existence of God,

37:37.200 --> 37:39.160
and the existence of ‘Chaitanya’.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.613
May God bless you all!

37:50.080 --> 37:53.880
Now I will talk a little bit in Hindi,

37:54.080 --> 37:56.279
and tell you things which I feel are not right.

37:56.480 --> 38:00.440
You have left your countries and have come here

38:00.880 --> 38:03.120
and after coming to this country

38:03.320 --> 38:06.240
the problems of this country are affecting you.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.120
I know this very well,

38:09.320 --> 38:12.200
and I understand what you face,

38:12.400 --> 38:15.240
but we must know the reason

38:15.440 --> 38:19.960
why we are facing these problems.

38:20.440 --> 38:23.280
First of all, we must understand that

38:23.480 --> 38:25.532
whichever country we are in,

38:25.733 --> 38:28.352
the biggest tradition our country has

38:28.553 --> 38:32.200
is that we have not come to this world to earn money.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.520
Earning money is not the purpose of our lives,

38:35.720 --> 38:39.319
but achieving God is the aim of our lives.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.630
Rest of the things, earning money -

38:41.831 --> 38:43.680
in our country, many saints,

38:43.880 --> 38:46.280
all of them have said that they are transitory,

38:46.480 --> 38:48.000
and we should fall into it.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.000
Any bhajan is talking about this.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.919
You also see every day

38:54.120 --> 38:56.640
those who have earned a lot, what state they are in.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.200
Looking at the children here, you can see

38:59.400 --> 39:04.320
they have started taking drugs and doing all kinds of things.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.360
The reason is the parents were chasing after money,

39:07.560 --> 39:09.000
completely after money,

39:09.200 --> 39:12.080
and did not give attention and love to the children.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.960
When love went towards money, the children were left out.

39:15.160 --> 39:16.615
They did not mentor the children,

39:16.816 --> 39:18.814
so the children went the wrong way in life.

39:19.015 --> 39:21.920
Tomorrow your own children will take these ways, too.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.759
So much ego regarding money

39:23.960 --> 39:25.960
never used to be in Indian people.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.160
We never worshipped the money.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.960
Humanity was most vital in our culture,

39:31.160 --> 39:33.040
and you must never forget that.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.959
Still, in our country today,

39:35.160 --> 39:38.319
there are many thieves. You can't deny that.

39:38.521 --> 39:40.720
This is also because of you.

39:40.921 --> 39:43.479
Those who came abroad and tell

39:43.680 --> 39:46.279
that people abroad live like this, these things are there...

39:46.480 --> 39:48.960
Until our country was ruled by the English

39:49.160 --> 39:52.640
our minds were not so polluted by these ideas.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.520
But once you people started going back to India

39:55.720 --> 39:57.397
taking things from here to there,

39:57.598 --> 39:59.400
going there and praising the West,

39:59.601 --> 40:01.240
their brains went off.

40:01.480 --> 40:06.066
And now in India, you see, people are in such a state,

40:06.267 --> 40:08.459
that if you bring something from abroad,

40:08.660 --> 40:11.960
even if it’s just a soap, they will show it to everybody.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.879
Don’t we have sandalwood in our country?

40:14.080 --> 40:15.680
Don’t we have face packs in our country?

40:15.880 --> 40:17.440
Don’t we have things that exist here,

40:17.640 --> 40:22.319
that you need to boast about all these, to impress Indians,

40:22.520 --> 40:24.240
as if the West has something great?

40:24.480 --> 40:26.015
I want to tell you all, clearly,

40:26.216 --> 40:28.824
that you have nothing to learn from the West.

40:29.025 --> 40:31.600
There is nothing worth learning in this country.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.346
You should understand very well that learning something here

40:34.547 --> 40:37.280
is dangerous, extremely dangerous.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.840
The wrongs they do, you too will do the same.

40:41.040 --> 40:46.040
In that dirt you will be stuck, unable to reach anywhere.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.240
So I warn you here today

40:48.440 --> 40:51.440
that you should learn nothing from this country.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.080
If you have to learn anything, it should be that

40:54.280 --> 40:57.440
these people who have made mistakes, have now returned to God.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.480
Similarly, by keeping the pride,

40:59.680 --> 41:02.560
the pride of your nation, you will return to God Almighty.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.880
There is nothing more beautiful than that.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.879
I came here and found out

41:08.079 --> 41:10.073
that the wife of a disciple who came to Me,

41:10.274 --> 41:11.959
ran away with someone,

41:12.160 --> 41:14.430
or somebody's husband ran away with someone,

41:14.631 --> 41:16.173
that some do not respect the elders.

41:16.374 --> 41:19.600
By doing all these you can be worse than them (English)!

41:19.800 --> 41:23.654
I've met an officer, a minister actually. He told Me that

41:23.855 --> 41:26.170
it's a big concern that Sikhs don’t agree

41:26.370 --> 41:28.692
to put anything (a cap) on their turbans,

41:28.893 --> 41:33.097
as it's not written in their religion.

41:33.298 --> 41:35.600
So I said, "In the religion it’s also written not to drink".

41:35.800 --> 41:38.452
I told that minister to bring any Sikh who is not drinking,

41:38.652 --> 41:41.025
any Sikh who does not touch the alcohol.

41:41.226 --> 41:45.960
Not a single person who does not drink alcohol was found in London.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.960
By hiding like this behind religion,

41:49.160 --> 41:52.263
by finding things to fight about, nothing can happen.

41:52.464 --> 41:54.159
The second thing I want to tell you

41:54.360 --> 41:57.840
is that you don’t have proper knowledge about your traditions.

41:58.040 --> 42:00.520
Unless you have knowledge of your traditions,

42:00.720 --> 42:02.200
who will respect you?

42:02.400 --> 42:04.880
Morning till evening you keep copying these people.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.600
Then who will respect you?

42:06.800 --> 42:09.120
You must know your own culture,

42:09.320 --> 42:13.360
you must know what you were and what you are now.

42:13.560 --> 42:17.600
Indians can learn from you all.

42:17.800 --> 42:21.080
Instead, tell Indians about the faults here in the West.

42:21.280 --> 42:25.440
You influence them, and tell them you are not sitting in the heaven.

42:25.641 --> 42:29.511
I know some women who are cleaners in the airports,

42:29.712 --> 42:31.399
although they are brahmin caste.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.480
They belong to brahmin caste but they clean the airport!

42:34.680 --> 42:37.160
In our country nobody will do this for money.

42:37.394 --> 42:40.000
I am not saying doing this kind of work is bad,

42:40.200 --> 42:41.678
but they do it for money.

42:41.880 --> 42:44.160
If you do something for someone,

42:44.360 --> 42:46.960
any kind of work serving others, is nothing wrong with it,

42:47.160 --> 42:50.240
but doing any kind of dirty job for money,

42:50.480 --> 42:53.160
does not behoove Indians.

42:53.360 --> 42:57.280
I keep saying this to Indians and some have changed after that.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.200
But I am specially requesting you

42:59.400 --> 43:01.440
because when you come to this country,

43:01.640 --> 43:08.759
you are like a huge mirror for these people.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.130
They look up to you and think:

43:11.331 --> 43:14.760
"Oh, Indians are like this. Then why Mother is telling us off?"

43:14.960 --> 43:16.520
Anything I tell them,

43:16.720 --> 43:19.200
they come to know immediately where you stand.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.840
I have seen they are listening to classical music eagerly,

43:23.040 --> 43:25.720
as our music is heavenly.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.480
It originates from Aum.

43:27.680 --> 43:29.480
Even though they don't understand ragas,

43:29.680 --> 43:32.720
they enjoy even most difficult ragas.

43:32.960 --> 43:37.240
Here people tell Me that when Indians go for shopping,

43:37.440 --> 43:45.120
their children buy strange, dirty music and dance to them there (India).

43:45.320 --> 43:47.360
We should tell our children not to do that.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.360
This is the rule of our country

43:49.560 --> 43:51.880
that we can raise the children the way we want.

43:52.080 --> 43:54.560
In our country liberty never meant

43:54.760 --> 43:57.680
that you become offbeat, having no style or attitude left in you.

43:57.880 --> 43:59.760
It's called abandonment. It happens.

43:59.960 --> 44:03.708
We should not satisfy our children with games of the West,

44:03.909 --> 44:05.468
but make their characters.

44:05.669 --> 44:07.120
Among the Indians here,

44:07.320 --> 44:13.840
if you are able to find a very special example of a good character,

44:14.040 --> 44:18.360
then these westerners won't utter a word against you.

44:18.640 --> 44:21.759
We have spoiled our images ourselves.

44:21.960 --> 44:25.720
That day is not far when these people who worship you so much...

44:25.920 --> 44:29.280
When they see you are Indians, they feel you are great.

44:29.480 --> 44:32.560
Because whatever happens, we still understand Ganapati.

44:32.760 --> 44:35.640
We know what is wrong.

44:35.840 --> 44:39.760
In India when we do a wrong deed, we don't say it's a good one.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.760
Here the situation is such that wrong deeds are called good!

44:42.960 --> 44:45.280
They have made all kind of laws

44:45.480 --> 44:48.200
that astonish you and you can't believe it.

44:48.400 --> 44:52.720
We can't believe that these can be good deeds.

44:52.920 --> 44:55.320
Listening for thousands of years from our ancestors,

44:55.520 --> 44:57.680
these things are in our minds and blood.

44:57.880 --> 45:00.320
Being the truth they won't change so easily.

45:00.520 --> 45:03.280
But slowly we are getting affected by these people

45:03.480 --> 45:06.880
instead of learning from our ancestors.

45:07.355 --> 45:09.760
So, I ask you with folded hands

45:09.960 --> 45:14.653
become enthusiastic about your culture. Put your attention on it.

45:14.854 --> 45:17.864
Not only this, but achieve it in yourself after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

45:18.065 --> 45:21.920
Sahaja Yoga is the only thing which awakens the Kundalini in you.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.960
And you have your Spirit.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.240
After achieving your Spirit all questions disappear.

45:27.480 --> 45:32.176
The day the entire world will bow down to your country is not far.

45:32.447 --> 45:36.080
That day is not far! What can we compete with these people in?

45:36.280 --> 45:39.080
You say you can compete in science.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.600
You can never do that as they are doing that since long.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.704
As we started going towards science,

45:43.904 --> 45:45.519
they went further to computers.

45:45.720 --> 45:50.680
But they cannot compete with us in spiritual knowledge.

45:51.042 --> 45:56.200
For that they must come to us and learn and become like us.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.407
They must accept our habits and manners.

45:58.607 --> 46:00.319
Otherwise they won't get it.

46:00.520 --> 46:05.479
The best way is to become a special person, a symbol of awakening.

46:05.680 --> 46:09.200
If that thing shines in you, they will say,

46:09.400 --> 46:12.200
"These are Indians. This happens in India."

46:12.400 --> 46:17.560
But I hope you people don't feel bad,

46:17.800 --> 46:22.440
Take it as a mother is talking to her child and accept it.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.879
You have to be wise and alert.

46:25.080 --> 46:27.080
Start practicing this.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.880
Nobody will dare move you from here or trouble you,

46:31.080 --> 46:33.000
because they are all running to help you.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.359
If someone is hurt they will all come running to help you.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.600
Today at least 3 to 4 thousands people are standing here for you;

46:39.800 --> 46:41.640
your brothers and sisters are here.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.840
But if you don't you don't have it (Realization),

46:44.040 --> 46:47.080
then you are not worthy of being worshipped.

46:47.280 --> 46:50.229
I will ask the ladies and girls specifically.

46:50.430 --> 46:52.399
They have spoiled this country.

46:52.600 --> 46:56.000
In our country ladies have a very good position.

46:56.202 --> 46:58.560
Ladies are respected in India.

46:58.800 --> 47:03.200
Long time before the time of Manu (Noah), it was said about ladies,

47:03.400 --> 47:09.320
"Where women are worshipped, there reside the Gods".

47:09.520 --> 47:12.000
This is said, but ladies must be respectable.

47:12.240 --> 47:15.120
Don't learn from the dirty habits of women here.

47:15.320 --> 47:18.040
We are as powerful as the Mother Earth.

47:18.240 --> 47:21.359
We have immense capacity to absorb many things.

47:21.560 --> 47:24.389
Like these stupid women, fighting with their husband,

47:24.590 --> 47:28.000
staying away from children, becoming westernized,

47:28.200 --> 47:30.200
and learning all the bad things.

47:30.400 --> 47:34.080
A day will come when with five husbands or more,

47:34.320 --> 47:37.600
they will end up in asylums and orphanages.

47:37.800 --> 47:41.280
It's important to understand that we are women and they are men.

47:41.480 --> 47:43.720
Of course male and female are alike.

47:43.920 --> 47:48.280
We can say they are equal, but not similar.

47:48.480 --> 47:52.456
Woman, you must know,

47:54.528 --> 47:58.031
is one wheel on the left side of the carriage,

47:58.232 --> 47:59.679
and men are on the right side.

47:59.880 --> 48:02.440
It doesn't mean men have the right to dominate the women.

48:02.640 --> 48:05.400
They suppressed the women, that's why they have this crisis.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.040
Men in our culture must understand that.

48:08.240 --> 48:11.439
Our social set-up must not ruin due to them.

48:11.640 --> 48:14.560
You must unlearn whatever you learned wrong from Muslims.

48:14.760 --> 48:17.280
And that place in our hearts which was for women...

48:17.480 --> 48:21.040
Even before taking Rama's name, Sita's name is chanted.

48:21.320 --> 48:23.840
Before Krishna's name, we take Radha's name.

48:24.040 --> 48:27.400
That is why respecting women and the housewives,

48:27.601 --> 48:31.600
keeping them like that and respecting them, you will see,

48:31.800 --> 48:34.440
that your children will start respecting you

48:34.640 --> 48:36.960
and the entire world will be transformed.

48:37.160 --> 48:39.399
We have seen a change in these people,

48:39.600 --> 48:42.960
who have never seen Indian traditions.

48:43.160 --> 48:46.120
You have all been Indians for a long time.

48:46.320 --> 48:49.600
Your grandfathers and great-grandfathers have grown up in India.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.320
This work will be easy for you.

48:52.520 --> 48:58.520
I am glad to see you all among them. Thousands more can be with you.

48:58.720 --> 49:02.200
I am standing with you in any of your troubles.

49:02.400 --> 49:05.840
For that, first of all become Indians,

49:06.040 --> 49:07.360
the real kind of Indians.

49:07.560 --> 49:10.880
This does not mean that you become hostile to this country.

49:11.080 --> 49:15.160
In the end I will tell you that in Sahaja Yoga,

49:15.360 --> 49:17.840
England is known as a very high place.

49:18.040 --> 49:22.160
Sahaja Yoga considers England as the heart of the universe.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.880
You will be surprised to know

49:25.080 --> 49:28.120
that India is the Kundalini and Mooladhara, the place of Ganesha,

49:28.320 --> 49:30.560
and England is the heart.

49:30.760 --> 49:33.160
That is why you people are here.

49:33.400 --> 49:39.479
But you must absorb good thoughts and qualities from here.

49:39.680 --> 49:46.160
You must share these healthy and good quality thoughts with people

49:46.360 --> 49:51.600
so they can establish having a new shape and new form.

49:51.800 --> 49:55.520
Because of Sahaja Yoga their hearts have changed a lot.

49:55.720 --> 49:59.200
My husband used to think, "What can you teach these people?"

49:59.400 --> 50:05.360
He used to laugh a lot, as I worked hard with six people for a year.

50:05.560 --> 50:08.275
Now he can't say anything

50:08.476 --> 50:11.079
and he sees how they have changed.

50:11.280 --> 50:16.760
He says, "If I say anything against it, I will be a liar".

50:16.960 --> 50:18.160
This is what it is.

50:18.360 --> 50:21.520
The truth is that doing Sahaja Yoga, one can change immediately.

50:21.760 --> 50:25.703
A person’s Spirit which is his Self, his guru,

50:25.904 --> 50:27.959
becomes enlightened and takes care.

50:28.160 --> 50:33.640
You cannot pay for it. You cannot give anything for it.

50:33.840 --> 50:38.200
You can only ask, "Give us our Spirit".

50:38.400 --> 50:40.520
You can only ask for this.

50:40.720 --> 50:44.720
Thank you all very much for listening to Me.
