1
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:08,433
Mother, if only You can advise us regarding food.

2
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:10,793
Regarding what?

3
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,979
Whatever food should be taken.

4
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:18,666
In Sahaja Yoga we do not pay much attention to food.

5
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:22,112
Only thing I feel that,

6
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:25,912
so much attention has been paid to food.

7
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:28,432
It's not a correct attitude.

8
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:32,872
You see, the Spirit doesn’t eat at all,

9
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:38,232
it’s a detached thing. Atma is beyond.

10
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:44,072
Now when we try to say that, if we eat this kind of food,

11
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:52,312
Atma will be happy, that kind of, Atma will be happy, is not true.

12
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,752
For example we’ll say vegetarianism,

13
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:58,952
which is a very common problem with people is.

14
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:02,633
You’ll be amazed, all the false gurus are vegetarians;

15
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:06,432
one by one, Mahesh yogi, Rajneesh...

16
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:12,192
Rajneesh is a great vedge. He doesn’t even eat garlic and onions.

17
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,352
This Mahesh yogi’s disciples,

18
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:17,752
if you show them a garlic, they’ll jump, 100 times.

19
00:01:17,873 --> 00:01:24,847
They are afraid of the garlic! Can you imagine?

20
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:30,352
But I don’t say that you eat meat, that’s not the point is.

21
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:35,512
But those people, whatever they require they should eat,

22
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:42,312
but don’t eat meats of animals which are bigger than you.

23
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:45,112
Now what happens?

24
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:48,072
How the evolution in the animals takes place?

25
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:51,272
Nobody has put attention to that.

26
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:53,913
Supposing there are many chickens you save.

27
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:57,232
I am not going to give Realization to chickens, am I?

28
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:02,472
Or to bugs, am I going to give Realization? Or to mosquitoes?

29
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:07,672
So our attention is on these, not on the higher level of life.

30
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,912
When we think of food, that we must save chickens

31
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:15,279
actually nothing dies. Is Krishna Himself has said ‘Nothing dies’.

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,159
All right?

33
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:20,233
And that’s how some people denied Krishna,

34
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:24,272
because He had a samhara shakti, He used to kill.

35
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:29,712
And killing is so important in evolution.
Otherwise if you don’t kill these rakshasas,

36
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,912
are you going to adore them?
What are you to do with them?

37
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:37,352
They are to be killed they are to be thrown out.

38
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:41,432
In the evolutionary process also,

39
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:45,992
so many things have to die out for the real thing to come up.

40
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:50,072
Say this flower has to die to become the fruit, all right?

41
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:53,392
And there is no ‘hinsa’ in it.

42
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:56,033
The word ‘hinsa’ is so misinterpreted

43
00:02:56,233 --> 00:03:01,832
that people are satisfied, if they do not eat meat. It's not true.

44
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:05,872
For some people it is essential they must eat meat.

45
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:11,352
Now as you know, Sahaja Yoga works on the power of shakti.

46
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:16,272
And the Devi not only killed raskshasas but She ate them!

47
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:18,433
And She drank the blood

48
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:22,392
of these rakshasas as you know, Raktabija’s.

49
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:25,740
So how can She be vegetarian?

50
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:31,552
Just tell Me. Put reason.
All right?

51
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:34,912
Because we are conditioned that way, we think.

52
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:40,512
But actually what happens, in the evolutionary process,

53
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:45,632
when a person, say, eats chicken,

54
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:49,992
not person, we should say, a higher animal,

55
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:54,152
eats a lower animal, then it passes through the circle

56
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:56,312
and achieves a higher life.

57
00:03:56,433 --> 00:04:01,352
It's absolutely this is how evolution takes place.

58
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:04,992
Of course, we can give Realization

59
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:07,073
to human beings so we need not worry about that.

60
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:10,872
That’s a different point. But,

61
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:14,272
if you eat chicken, you definitely give it a higher life.

62
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:16,672
But not the animals which are bigger than you.

63
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:20,872
Smaller animals, if you eat, it’s

64
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:24,152
not going to be harmed by that. No doubt.

65
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:25,633
But you may be harmed.

66
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:31,274
For example, if you eat mosquitoes, you’ll be harmed!

67
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:36,232
Now in countries where there is not even any vegetable or anything,

68
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:38,592
they have not seen green leaves, like Greenland.

69
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:44,537
Now the name is ‘Greenland’, they have never seen green colour!

70
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:51,872
Are they sinners that they can’t live without eating meat?

71
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:56,952
How can God be so partial?

72
00:04:57,073 --> 00:05:01,432
There are many countries where they cannot live without eating meat.

73
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:05,792
So, there must be some reason. All right? So reason it out.

74
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:10,432
If you eat vegetables, all right.

75
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:12,832
If you want to eat meat, it’s all right.

76
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:18,032
But again for a Sahaja Yogi, what we decide is not

77
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:21,592
on what you like, but what is good for you.

78
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:25,592
For example, for Western people it is better that they don’t eat

79
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,793
much meat now because, I think

80
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:31,312
they and their fathers have eaten all that.

81
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:35,192
Eat less. There should have more carbohydrates, while

82
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:37,392
the vegetarians should take more proteins.

83
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:40,272
If they do not like meat they should take to other proteins,

84
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,753
because proteins are very important.

85
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:46,312
If you do not take proteins in life, people suffer.

86
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:51,632
In Sahaja Yoga we find such people have trouble from Left Nabhi.

87
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:54,513
I have seen in India, many people, who are strict vegetarians,

88
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:56,832
have a problem of Left Nabhi.

89
00:05:56,953 --> 00:06:01,153
So we told them, all right, you can eat proteins.
There are so many proteins you can eat.

90
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:03,953
If you don’t like to eat meat from childhood, you have not eaten,

91
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,992
you don’t feel like eating, all right, forget it. Eat some.

92
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:10,512
We have to be wise, we have to be open,

93
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:16,152
we are not to be bound by our conditioning from childhood.

94
00:06:16,273 --> 00:06:18,232
This we must understand,

95
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:21,352
that vegetarianism is not going to take you to God,

96
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:25,232
neither non-vegetarianism.

97
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:29,352
Because the Spirit is neither a vegetarian nor a non-vegetarian.

98
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,592
It is a detached thing, it’s above food.

99
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:36,752
But whatever you need for your body is important.

100
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:39,072
If you need protein, eat protein.

101
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:42,192
If you don’t eat protein, don’t eat protein,

102
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:46,232
but then eat something which you need.

103
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:51,432
So it is not that one has to understand it

104
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:57,472
in a way that we understand as a chicken and vegetables,

105
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:59,792
but we must understand

106
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:04,072
in the way a doctor understands, proteins and carbohydrates.

107
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:08,112
All right? Whatever you like, you can eat.

108
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:13,672
There’s no, in Sahaja Yoga there’s no such a compulsion.

109
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:16,232
So many saints used to eat meat.

110
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:21,112
So many saints. Guru Nanaka, Kabira, Mohammed-sahib,

111
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,912
Christ, Rama Himself, Krishna Himself.

112
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:29,632
All of them ate meat. Even Buddha ate meat.

113
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:33,352
The proof is that, at the end of His life,

114
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:38,752
He went to one of His disciples who was a hunter,

115
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:42,272
and He told him, “I am very hungry, give Me something to eat.”

116
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:44,553
So he said “Sir, I have nothing else but a wild boar

117
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:47,313
which I have killed very recently

118
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:49,952
and it is not yet fully cooked.”

119
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:52,432
So he said, “All right, doesn’t matter I’ll have it,”

120
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:56,272
And He ate it and He died because of that

121
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:01,632
half-cooked wild boar.

122
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:03,553
And He died with that.

123
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:07,113
So now Buddhists think that, “We should not eat meat.” It’s not so.

124
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:10,672
Because He ate something that was half-cooked,

125
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:12,473
That means He did eat, isn’t it?

126
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:17,432
Even Jains know that, it’s only Neminath

127
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:21,353
who got a kind of a feeling against meat eating.

128
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,833
That was Neminath, was at the time of,

129
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:26,912
he was contemporary of Shri Krishna.

130
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:30,073
When his marriage was celebrated he found many birds

131
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,872
were killed and he felt terrible about it

132
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:36,352
and he didn’t want to eat any meat. Was all right.

133
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:38,872
It’s all right. If you don’t feel like, don’t eat it.

134
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:41,472
But then a cult started.

135
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:46,072
But that means till Neminath, means, Jainis are ancient people,

136
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:51,792
till Neminath they were eating meat – is a fact.

137
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:55,072
So to get attached to some idea

138
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:58,832
is not the way you are doing it.

139
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:01,512
If you don’t want to eat, just don’t eat it.

140
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:06,272
And if somebody has to eat it, because of health purposes

141
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:10,512
or because of the need, there’s nothing wrong in it.

142
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,632
Everybody has a different need,

143
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:16,432
every individual has a different need

144
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:19,673
If I, personally, take just to vegetarian food,

145
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:21,992
I won’t exist I can tell you.

146
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:29,472
Because I have such a great capacity to have purges.

147
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:31,593
If I meet somebody, shake hands with somebody,

148
00:09:31,793 --> 00:09:33,832
he has lots of bhoots you see,

149
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:39,992
then I just clear him out by purging.

150
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,473
And if I take just to say, carbohydrates,

151
00:09:43,593 --> 00:09:45,473
I don’t know what will happen to Me.

152
00:09:45,673 --> 00:09:49,073
But doesn’t mean that I should be a meat eater,

153
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:52,352
but I have to have proteins. That’s the point is.

154
00:09:52,473 --> 00:09:55,432
It’s no question of meat or anything but this is question

155
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,872
of eating proteins or carbohydrates.

156
00:09:59,993 --> 00:10:01,793
We have to be wise about it.

157
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:03,952
And all such cults you see,

158
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:07,752
that “You eat this, you eat that”, is not so.

159
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,513
There is no cult in Sahaja Yoga.

160
00:10:09,673 --> 00:10:13,272
Every individual has a different personality,

161
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:18,392
but, the common thing is one, and that is the Spirit.

162
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:23,953
But for example, drinking, we abhor.

163
00:10:24,153 --> 00:10:27,312
But after Realization, before that I don’t talk of drinking.

164
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:31,072
Because it goes against your chaitanya, means your awareness.

165
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:34,592
So one has to look after the awareness.

166
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:37,952
So much time has been wasted in people in

167
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:39,553
deciding what to eat what not to eat.

168
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:42,232
What have they achieved? Nothing!

169
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:46,672
Sometimes I have seen vegetarians can be horrid people.

170
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:53,072
Absolutely horrid. We have a community in India called Marwadis.

171
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:57,872
They are blood suckers you see, and they are vegetarians.

172
00:10:57,993 --> 00:11:03,152
Not all, we have some in Sahaja Yoga also, very few.

173
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:09,312
They are extremely money-minded people, you know that.

174
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:12,273
So, this kind of thing, to believe that

175
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:15,593
such food will make us great is, will be falsehood.

176
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:17,433
So you don’t decide on that.

177
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,872
You decide on proteins and carbohydrates.

178
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:25,392
Whatever good for your health, you should do.

179
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:29,432
Those who eat too much of vegetarian food

180
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:31,793
are liable to certain type of diseases

181
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:37,432
and those who eat too much of non-veg are liable to some.

182
00:11:37,553 --> 00:11:43,272
Those who eat vegetarian food can get leucoderma very easily,

183
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:49,712
can get leukemia very easily.

184
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,592
Certain types of cancers they can get very easily.

185
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,913
Those who are non-vegetarians can get another kind of diseases.

186
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:59,792
There are numerous diseases they can get.

187
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:02,632
So we have to have a balance,

188
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:06,033
that when we eat vegetarian food also, we must see that we eat

189
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:11,392
sufficiently, sufficient amount of proteins,

190
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:14,432
because body has to be all right.

191
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:18,993
Healthy body is the temple of God,

192
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:24,206
and to temple of God, you have to keep it healthy and happy.
