1999-0508 Entertainment Program,
Sahastrara Puja Weekend, Cabella, Italy

02:44:45.284 --> 02:44:53.123
Sometimes the words fail to express

02:44:55.541 --> 02:45:03.418
the feelings of great gratitude for all
of you -

02:45:03.918 --> 02:45:08.442
for putting up this collective effort

02:45:08.643 --> 02:45:19.150
and such a beautiful concentrated work
as a real piece of art.

02:45:19.351 --> 02:45:26.033
I had seen “Magic Flute” long time back,
when I was in Berlin,

02:45:26.234 --> 02:45:33.786
and that time – of course I didn’t
understand German language,

02:45:33.987 --> 02:45:42.891
but I absolutely got lost by the rhythm,
the music, the tuning and everything.

02:45:43.092 --> 02:45:47.884
So, actually the way you have brought
in that

02:45:48.085 --> 02:45:54.379
very, very beautiful piece of art to life –

02:45:54.580 --> 02:46:01.046
I feel so much grateful to you that you are
all Sahaja Yogis,

02:46:01.247 --> 02:46:12.374
and to Sahaja Yogis to perform this kind
of magnificent, tremendous art piece,

02:46:12.575 --> 02:46:19.223
I don’t know whom to thank, really.
Because now I can see our future,

02:46:19.424 --> 02:46:25.153
we’ll be going all over the world,
taking this music.

02:46:25.354 --> 02:46:30.199
And may not be this one, may be
another one,

02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:37.596
but you are all such a great group that
you can really surpass everybody else

02:46:37.797 --> 02:46:41.937
who are having all these operas everywhere.

02:46:42.138 --> 02:46:47.046
Actually I would say in London it’s very
easy to get that hall

02:46:47.247 --> 02:46:51.994
which is mostly used for operas,
the Royal Albert Hall.

02:46:52.195 --> 02:46:58.740
So we can reserve for you that, and we’ll
have the whole thing done.

02:46:58.941 --> 02:47:05.255
I mean, I could never imagine that
you were such masters.

02:47:05.534 --> 02:47:10.515
I shouldn’t say professionals, but
really masters.

02:47:10.716 --> 02:47:16.609
And the way you all concentrated. This is
the main point of collective playing

02:47:16.810 --> 02:47:20.105
is that there should be complete
concentration.

02:47:20.306 --> 02:47:25.682
I just wanted to test you, so I said,
“Sing also Binati Suniye”.

02:47:25.883 --> 02:47:29.147
But despite that you came back
to your normal

02:47:29.348 --> 02:47:32.880
and you were doing everything so well,
even after that;

02:47:33.081 --> 02:47:37.741
I don’t know how to congratulate you
and all of you

02:47:37.942 --> 02:47:47.518
who have taken to it, worked together,
in such unison and with such clarity.

02:47:48.370 --> 02:47:56.313
I must say, I would say it was even better
than the one I had seen, much better.

02:47:57.355 --> 02:48:03.908
You see, because I couldn’t even understand
the language, apart from that,

02:48:04.109 --> 02:48:09.474
it was little they, I felt, they were
little confused comparatively,

02:48:09.675 --> 02:48:13.797
while you people were straight, absolutely
could see what you were doing,

02:48:13.998 --> 02:48:18.897
and what you were performing, and what
you were giving.

02:48:19.065 --> 02:48:22.830
Now I see your future, the future
of Sahaja Yoga.

02:48:23.031 --> 02:48:27.500
Through you people, the glory of Sahaja
Yoga will spread.

02:48:27.701 --> 02:48:33.159
But when we have the program we’ll have
all formal dresses and all formalities,

02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:37.828
and I’m sure - I bless you from My heart -
that we’ll have the complete

02:48:38.029 --> 02:48:48.219
of this particular play by Mozart.
Complete.

02:48:48.420 --> 02:48:54.688
And we’ll do it so well, I know, and people
will know that what Sahaja Yoga can do

02:48:54.889 --> 02:49:01.264
to your collectivity by which you can
achieve it – because this collectivity

02:49:01.465 --> 02:49:05.916
you can’t have in any other form
of performance.

02:49:06.117 --> 02:49:11.772
This has to be all of you, the players,
singers,

02:49:11.973 --> 02:49:15.848
then the dialogues and everything
has to be in unison.

02:49:16.049 --> 02:49:21.871
In Maharashtra, in Marathi, we have dramas
of this kind,

02:49:22.072 --> 02:49:27.968
which can be called as operas, but apart
from that, there is lot of –

02:49:28.169 --> 02:49:36.710
what you can say – dialogues which are not
in the tune or in the music form.

02:49:36.911 --> 02:49:41.592
So also they speak and tell you something
in between.

02:49:41.793 --> 02:49:49.682
But they are also very enjoyable and they
are thinking of having opera in Maharashtra.

02:49:49.883 --> 02:49:53.678
But now let – when they’ll see you then
I think they’ll give up the idea,

02:49:53.879 --> 02:49:57.163
they can’t do that well, I’m sure.

02:49:57.364 --> 02:50:04.525
In any case Austria is a place, is the –
I think is the origin, is the distribution,

02:50:04.726 --> 02:50:12.307
is the complete sky of Western classical
music, no doubt about it.

02:50:12.508 --> 02:50:17.353
And you all are all really based into it.

02:50:17.554 --> 02:50:22.541
The way you have played and the way
you have sung

02:50:22.742 --> 02:50:26.014
is very remarkable, it has touched
My heart.

02:50:26.215 --> 02:50:31.706
I wish you had the complete seventy-five
minutes program,

02:50:31.907 --> 02:50:37.323
but the problem is that supposing you have
one day for this, then it’s all right.

02:50:37.524 --> 02:50:45.766
No, as it is, we have only two days in that
this cannot be fully expressed.

02:50:45.967 --> 02:50:52.032
But we’ll arrange a program, we’ll
definitely arrange a program

02:50:52.233 --> 02:50:55.982
in, say, Albert Hall I think, it’s easy
to get.

02:50:56.183 --> 02:50:59.022
I [mean] we get it every time, again
we’ll get this time.

02:50:59.223 --> 02:51:02.628
And I’m sure they will be very impressed.

02:51:02.829 --> 02:51:08.271
Because they don’t know what music
you have in your country

02:51:08.472 --> 02:51:13.040
and how much people know and how much
they can sing so well.

02:51:13.241 --> 02:51:19.423
It’s something very rare, you don’t
understand, I feel it because

02:51:19.624 --> 02:51:24.772
I must say I’m not so much used to operas,

02:51:24.973 --> 02:51:29.967
and whatever operas I have seen, this is
thousand times better than that.

02:51:30.168 --> 02:51:35.041
So I’m really amazed at your achievement.
I don’t know if it is Sahaj Yog

02:51:35.242 --> 02:51:42.241
that has helped you, but this collective,
collective singing, is the biggest thing.

02:51:42.442 --> 02:51:45.647
Collective, in tune with all other
musicians,

02:51:45.848 --> 02:51:50.249
it’s really very, very great and this
unison, this oneness,

02:51:50.450 --> 02:51:55.411
if it is through Sahaj Yog, I’m very happy
about it.

02:51:55.612 --> 02:52:00.417
We are all overly satisfied and I can see
your future –

02:52:00.618 --> 02:52:07.069
it will be a great future for all of you.
We shouldn’t take so much of botheration

02:52:07.270 --> 02:52:13.229
about how we’ll do it and how will it work
out – it will, it will work out.

02:52:13.430 --> 02:52:17.889
Your desire is much stronger than
the desire of any other artist.

02:52:18.090 --> 02:52:22.400
So just desire, it will all work out and
we’ll show to them

02:52:22.601 --> 02:52:28.001
how Sahaja Yoga can create such
beautiful music.

02:52:28.202 --> 02:52:34.786
So thank you very much, and I thank from
all others the way you have entertained us

02:52:34.987 --> 02:52:44.458
with this beautiful music and such great
hopes of a future expressions of your art.

02:52:44.659 --> 02:52:47.913
May God bless you.

02:52:51.435 --> 02:53:01.394
Then Slovakia people are also another
very great geniuses,

02:53:01.595 --> 02:53:07.861
yesterday we saw their drama and today
again we saw – I’m amazed absolutely.

02:53:08.062 --> 02:53:14.035
Is it Sahaja Yoga that has made them so
good in art? The creativity was so great

02:53:14.236 --> 02:53:21.230
and their play, drama was so beautiful.
So beautifully rendered;

02:53:21.431 --> 02:53:26.848
yesterday also, today also. I mean, they
are such dramatist I didn’t know, I mean,

02:53:27.049 --> 02:53:32.927
how could they be that confident
of their acting and everything,

02:53:33.128 --> 02:53:38.368
is really remarkable. When I was young
I used to act also in dramas,

02:53:38.569 --> 02:53:45.776
and I used to get first prize mostly.
Maybe I quite

02:53:46.801 --> 02:53:53.756
disguised Myself as something else,
but the, you see, the art,

02:53:53.957 --> 02:53:59.423
art of acting was so great even with them,

02:53:59.624 --> 02:54:04.476
I was surprised how they could freely
act so well.

02:54:04.677 --> 02:54:10.156
Again I would say if it is Sahaj Yog,
carry on, carry on with Sahaja Yoga.

02:54:10.357 --> 02:54:16.764
And I’m sure this creativity, the blessings
of Saraswati will be upon you;

02:54:16.965 --> 02:54:25.098
and we’ll have even bigger dramas
and bigger -

02:54:25.299 --> 02:54:31.388
we should say – expositions somewhere,
maybe later on

02:54:31.589 --> 02:54:37.883
we can have it in India, or have it
in America, anywhere.

02:54:38.084 --> 02:54:45.175
So I see all that before Me, and you’ll be
very well-known artists, all of you;

02:54:45.376 --> 02:54:55.494
even the Slovakia people have great talent
I must say. Such a great talent!

02:54:55.695 --> 02:55:02.381
This talent is a special gift of God, no
doubt. But to combine it, to express it,

02:55:02.582 --> 02:55:08.311
to work it out in such a collective manner,
is something very different

02:55:08.512 --> 02:55:15.103
and very beautiful, and it really made Me
feel very confident about you people,

02:55:15.304 --> 02:55:19.054
that one day through you Sahaja Yoga
will spread all over the world,

02:55:19.255 --> 02:55:26.377
and people will start knowing this Sahaj
orchestra and Sahaj artists.

02:55:26.578 --> 02:55:33.613
It’s really great, very great, and I bless
you from My heart for that.

02:55:35.791 --> 02:55:40.187
Then we had some other programs of this,
like Kathak dance,

02:55:40.388 --> 02:55:45.197
and also I’m amazed that a German girl
can dance so well that Kathak.

02:55:45.398 --> 02:55:50.380
It’s not easy, it’s very difficult. And
rhythmic sense, and all the expression

02:55:50.581 --> 02:55:55.160
and everything – she was so delicately
doing it, I was surprised.

02:55:55.361 --> 02:55:59.236
I never thought that German girls could
be that delicate, but really,

02:55:59.437 --> 02:56:03.477
they are so delicate and so beautifully
expressing

02:56:03.683 --> 02:56:12.685
the, all the delicacies of a lady
in her dancing, is…

02:56:12.886 --> 02:56:20.225
All – I don’t want to take your time
describing all of them,

02:56:20.426 --> 02:56:24.930
but one after another every program
has been great.

02:56:25.131 --> 02:56:33.281
And the way you are now depicting
those great musicians

02:56:33.481 --> 02:56:38.596
is something very creditable. Because world
has forgotten them.

02:56:38.804 --> 02:56:43.362
They want pop music, cheap music,
easy music –

02:56:43.563 --> 02:56:48.368
but once you start establishing it,
the vibrations will flow

02:56:48.569 --> 02:56:55.633
and people will realise how great this
music was and was lost.

02:56:55.834 --> 02:56:59.241
So this trend that is in the whole world

02:56:59.442 --> 02:57:06.837
is to become cheapish and to become
something very, very superficial,

02:57:07.038 --> 02:57:12.556
will be curbed by your own dedication
and your own expressions,

02:57:12.757 --> 02:57:16.345
which will definitely make the vibrations
flow to the audience,

02:57:16.546 --> 02:57:21.873
and they will enjoy it very much.
Because you are now divine people,

02:57:22.074 --> 02:57:27.331
so your rendering is very different from
others, at least I felt that way.

02:57:27.532 --> 02:57:32.392
I felt – gave Me such great joy,
such great joy

02:57:32.593 --> 02:57:36.063
that I didn’t get from all other operas
I have seen,

02:57:36.264 --> 02:57:43.981
and somehow I couldn’t understand
the way they were

02:57:44.182 --> 02:57:48.998
quite confused I felt, not so well
organized as you people are.

02:57:49.199 --> 02:57:53.528
So, My blessings again and again
for all of you,

02:57:53.729 --> 02:58:01.151
and the way this program has been arranged
by these countries is I’m thankful to them,

02:58:01.352 --> 02:58:08.181
to their leaders, and to all of them that
they have done a very great job.

02:58:08.382 --> 02:58:11.905
So many people have come from other
countries also here,

02:58:12.106 --> 02:58:19.249
and they should also take a lesson,
and try to develop this style

02:58:19.450 --> 02:58:25.939
of combining music and expressing
their great,

02:58:26.140 --> 02:58:30.287
very great artists, that they have their
own compound (? Unclear word).

02:58:30.488 --> 02:58:41.104
I’m trying to get one of our Indian
if you say an opera-style thing here,

02:58:41.305 --> 02:58:46.866
but it’s very difficult to get so many
people. But you would enjoy that, really.

02:58:47.067 --> 02:58:52.728
So let us see if I could manage sometime
a group of people who will come

02:58:52.929 --> 02:58:56.614
and give you a kind of an opera
as you have.

02:58:56.815 --> 02:59:00.322
Thank you very much.
