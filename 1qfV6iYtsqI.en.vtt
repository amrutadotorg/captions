Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella,
15th September, 1991

00:16.779 --> 00:29.980
Today is the happiest day for all of you,
for the whole universe, because Shri Ganesha

00:29.980 --> 00:31.720
was created.

00:31.720 --> 00:45.300
He was created to emit auspiciousness through
His Chaitanya [- Divine Vibrations –ed.].

00:45.300 --> 00:54.569
First, the whole cosmos was filled with this
Chaitanyasrishti [- creation of Divine Vibrations

00:54.569 --> 00:55.569
–ed.].

00:55.569 --> 01:04.229
Then Brahmadeva came into play, and He created
all the matter.

01:04.229 --> 01:21.160
But

01:21.160 --> 01:42.360
the greatest blessings of the Divine Power
was to symbolize Chaitanya, and this Chaitanya

01:42.360 --> 01:51.980
has many aspects, but specially in Shri Ganesha,
it is auspiciousness.

01:51.980 --> 01:58.870
In these modern times people have lost the
sense of auspiciousness.

01:58.870 --> 02:06.390
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya,
is auspicious, is shubh, and whatever does

02:06.390 --> 02:13.060
not is not by any chance auspicious.

02:13.060 --> 02:22.680
So first of all, whatever you worship, whatever
you accept, all of them have to be auspicious

02:22.680 --> 02:24.500
things.

02:24.500 --> 02:33.879
Every shape has a coefficience and all these
shapes which you see, not necessarily give

02:33.879 --> 02:35.769
vibrations.

02:35.769 --> 02:43.730
But in the human beings also, we find there
are many people, like you, who have Chaitanya

02:43.730 --> 02:45.599
flowing in them.

02:45.599 --> 02:53.049
But this Chaitanya when it flows, we just
take Shri Ganesha for granted.

02:53.049 --> 02:58.310
We do not understand that we have to awaken
Shri Ganesha within us.

02:58.310 --> 02:59.310
Means what?

02:59.310 --> 03:01.400
What we have to do?

03:01.400 --> 03:10.360
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in
you and as I said that innocence cannot be

03:10.360 --> 03:18.180
lost, so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal
child – He cannot be lost and He cannot

03:18.180 --> 03:19.840
be destroyed.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.069
So He’s all the time there.

03:22.069 --> 03:36.109
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering
the great personality of innocence.

03:36.109 --> 03:42.019
But it is always there present.

03:42.019 --> 03:50.319
So now, what should we do to keep this Ganesha
all the time shining within us?

03:50.319 --> 03:59.579
Is to first remember that you were made in
the same pattern as Shri Ganesh.

03:59.579 --> 04:09.120
But His Kundalini is on His stomach; His pure
desire is on His stomach.

04:09.120 --> 04:21.650
It’s very significant to understand why
it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

04:21.650 --> 04:33.830
That means He does not have to conquer the
temptations of Mooladhara at all.

04:33.830 --> 04:43.060
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach, that
means He is also beyond the temptations of

04:43.060 --> 05:01.960
food, of power or anything because His stomach
represents absolute abandonment, absolute

05:01.960 --> 05:03.140
freedom.

05:03.140 --> 05:10.460
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…
these days there is a big fashion that you

05:10.460 --> 05:11.580
cannot have a big belly.

05:11.580 --> 05:19.970
I mean this is becoming a big… not only
fashion but a big business.

05:19.970 --> 05:23.100
But as age grows, you have to have it.

05:23.100 --> 05:30.230
Even small children have that and they look
so sweet.

05:30.230 --> 05:38.090
Those people who are very thin must understand
that they might be getting some prizes in

05:38.090 --> 05:53.220
the… maybe beauty contest or something,
but they do not have that majesty, that royalty,

05:53.220 --> 05:57.900
that dignity in them as they should have.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.500
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

06:01.500 --> 06:08.270
He has a head with a trunk.

06:08.270 --> 06:10.840
He accepts it.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.110
Of course, is important, He should have that.

06:14.110 --> 06:20.060
Because head of the elephant suggests that
He is not like a human being who develops

06:20.060 --> 06:29.890
ego, superego, conditionings, but He is just
all the time one with the Divine.

06:29.890 --> 06:36.330
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,
He accepts His ears, He accepts everything

06:36.330 --> 06:39.400
that He is made of.

06:39.400 --> 06:47.770
He doesn’t aspire to something – some
entrepreneurs put some ideas and He wouldn’t

06:47.770 --> 06:49.710
go run after them.

06:49.710 --> 06:58.470
He won’t try to change Himself; He won’t
try to create that fashion and all that.

06:58.470 --> 07:11.270
He is what He is… because He is a satisfied
soul.

07:11.270 --> 07:24.870
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri

07:24.870 --> 07:26.840
Ganesha.

07:26.840 --> 07:37.450
When you have all the powers within you, you
know you are powerful, then you don’t hanker

07:37.450 --> 07:47.640
after all these things and you don’t try
to make a position or an impression of others.

07:47.640 --> 07:56.790
For example, He would never go and read books
like how to impress people.

07:56.790 --> 08:02.510
Very common.

08:02.510 --> 08:11.090
So now, as you are created in the same image
of Shri Ganesh, you have to understand that

08:11.090 --> 08:19.350
you have to accept whatever God has given
you, whatever position He has given you.

08:19.350 --> 08:20.840
Same with Christ.

08:20.840 --> 08:26.080
Christ accepted His father who was just a
carpenter.

08:26.080 --> 08:32.620
He didn’t aspire for something higher or
some sort of a special position or a power

08:32.620 --> 08:43.110
because He was so powerful – what more power
can He have?

08:43.110 --> 08:50.160
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at
Him and could not accept what He was saying,

08:50.160 --> 08:57.570
but still He was self-contented, self-satisfied.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.690
He knew what it was.

08:59.690 --> 09:10.240
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first thing is to be
self-contented.

09:10.240 --> 09:20.870
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western
life is to see and to be seen.

09:20.870 --> 09:31.880
Both things were missing completely in the
incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

09:31.880 --> 09:37.320
So when I say these things, suddenly people
start thinking, “Let us become hippies,

09:37.320 --> 09:42.550
or let them become punks, or let us become
this, let us become that.”

09:42.550 --> 09:44.490
You don’t have to become anything.

09:44.490 --> 09:51.700
Whatever you have – your body, your face,
your hair – everything is there, just meant

09:51.700 --> 09:56.930
for you.

09:56.930 --> 10:11.560
You don’t have to change anything outwardly
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

10:11.560 --> 10:17.700
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

10:17.700 --> 10:32.810
Though there were so many clouds on His being,
though many people insulted Him, tortured

10:32.810 --> 10:42.790
Him, hanged Him, crucified Him, still the
Eternal Being didn’t bother.

10:42.790 --> 10:56.290
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja
Yogi is to accept, go on accepting things.

10:56.290 --> 11:01.470
But when I say accept, I must say the other
side also: that doesn’t mean you start accepting

11:01.470 --> 11:06.150
bhoots, all the bad qualities of others.

11:06.150 --> 11:12.330
“Mother, You said you must accept”, so
they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

11:12.330 --> 11:13.650
“What’s wrong?

11:13.650 --> 11:16.380
You have said it already.”

11:16.380 --> 11:20.800
Whatever I say has another side, always.

11:20.800 --> 11:25.000
Like I said, “Now you have become your own
Guru.”

11:25.000 --> 11:28.740
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

11:28.740 --> 11:45.400
Like this, you see, we go on diverting ourselves,
deviating ourselves from reality just to cheat

11:45.400 --> 11:47.560
ourselves.

11:47.560 --> 11:52.730
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

11:52.730 --> 11:59.110
We have no wisdom because we do not know what
is for our benevolence, what is for our good,

11:59.110 --> 12:00.680
what we should do for our good.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.610
I mean even if we know, we don’t want to
do it.

12:04.610 --> 12:07.900
So, what we lack is wisdom.

12:07.900 --> 12:13.329
That’s a vicious circle, I must say, that
Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

12:13.329 --> 12:23.860
– He is the giver of wisdom, He is the giver
of wisdom – and He has to give you the wisdom,

12:23.860 --> 12:29.010
He is to be awakened; but you are not wise
because He is not awakened.

12:29.010 --> 12:34.779
It’s a very vicious circle.

12:34.779 --> 12:38.320
How to make this vicious circle break?

12:38.320 --> 12:44.750
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

12:44.750 --> 12:53.640
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

12:53.640 --> 12:59.380
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

12:59.380 --> 13:08.970
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

13:08.970 --> 13:20.810
That’s the point where you could see yourself
– introspection, which I have seen among

13:20.810 --> 13:25.110
Russians.

13:25.110 --> 13:29.420
Just introspect: “Why do I do like that?

13:29.420 --> 13:32.529
Why cannot I meditate?

13:32.529 --> 13:38.330
Am I going to miss out?

13:38.330 --> 13:46.750
Why can I not do something that is good for
me?”

13:46.750 --> 13:56.890
Introspection is the only way you can see
yourself how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

13:56.890 --> 14:08.750
Even, I have seen, when I say something in
general, people always – the mind is very

14:08.750 --> 14:14.330
clever – thinks that I am talking about
somebody else, not about them.

14:14.330 --> 14:23.050
It’s a convex mind, convex, which never
receives anything inside itself because there

14:23.050 --> 14:28.450
is no wisdom.

14:28.450 --> 14:39.000
If you are wise, then not only that you’ll
accept but you’ll understand and it will

14:39.000 --> 14:44.840
penetrate into your attention through your
central nervous system.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.480
You just know that this is it.

14:48.480 --> 14:56.301
Now you know that this… you put your hand
towards this candle, it… you’ll… your

14:56.301 --> 14:57.430
fingers might burn.

14:57.430 --> 15:03.390
You know it definitely, with experience, and
you won’t do that.

15:03.390 --> 15:11.800
With experience you have learnt not to put
your hand on to the candle.

15:11.800 --> 15:17.470
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to
tell you that.

15:17.470 --> 15:21.370
But this is a new life you have started – a
spiritual life.

15:21.370 --> 15:30.170
When you are going into the spiritual life,
try to remember your experiences, one after

15:30.170 --> 15:35.730
another: how you got transformed, how you
changed, how many the bad things that you

15:35.730 --> 15:40.750
had disappeared gradually and how you have
become so nice.

15:40.750 --> 15:49.470
This will take away your depression – to
begin with.

15:49.470 --> 15:53.880
Then you should think that, “What do I have
to do further?

15:53.880 --> 15:55.140
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

15:55.140 --> 16:05.290
There are lots of stages between absolute
stupidity and absolute wisdom, and you see

16:05.290 --> 16:15.930
all those shades all over, and combinations
and permutations of these I see every day.

16:15.930 --> 16:27.520
And I am surprised that after getting your
Self Realization, when Shri Ganesha is shining

16:27.520 --> 16:35.760
in your attention, you should see your reflection
clearly and try to correct it.

16:35.760 --> 16:44.760
Only this much wisdom if you have that, “I
have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll

16:44.760 --> 16:47.839
do it.

16:47.839 --> 16:54.029
I know of somebody who would never get up
in the mornings, say for example.

16:54.029 --> 16:59.470
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock
in the morning – I was surprised.

16:59.470 --> 17:04.949
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready

17:04.949 --> 17:06.650
to go somewhere.

17:06.650 --> 17:10.780
I said, “Where are you going?”

17:10.780 --> 17:13.180
“You don’t know?”

17:13.180 --> 17:14.180
I said, “What?”

17:14.180 --> 17:21.089
“I have got a job now and I have to be present
at 8 o’clock and it will take two hours

17:21.089 --> 17:22.290
to reach that place.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.309
Also, I am keeping some margin.

17:24.309 --> 17:25.850
So I have to leave now.

17:25.850 --> 17:28.000
I can’t talk to You even.”

17:28.000 --> 17:32.610
Quite alert, awake.

17:32.610 --> 17:42.240
Now, what is the thing is as far as money
is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

17:42.240 --> 17:50.090
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

17:50.090 --> 18:01.220
Money wisdom is quite a lot, job wisdom is
quite a lot.

18:01.220 --> 18:13.390
Because these things means prestige in the
society, this means security in the society.

18:13.390 --> 18:19.770
So this kind of business you find in many
people and in some even that is missing.

18:19.770 --> 18:25.190
They don’t even understand that they have
to earn their living.

18:25.190 --> 18:35.110
But that’s the minimum, you cannot be parasite.

18:35.110 --> 18:41.350
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages,
is this: that we are not for money, money

18:41.350 --> 18:50.990
is for us.

18:50.990 --> 19:03.770
The attention if it is on your Spirit, on
the Ganesha Principle, then whole situation

19:03.770 --> 19:06.580
will change.

19:06.580 --> 19:12.200
Your priorities will change.

19:12.200 --> 19:16.430
And suddenly people will say, “Mother, what
has happened to this gentleman?

19:16.430 --> 19:27.980
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such
a wise person.”

19:27.980 --> 19:32.980
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have
minimum wisdom already there.

19:32.980 --> 19:37.510
I mean, even if that is not there, how can
you work it out?

19:37.510 --> 19:46.460
Is not meant for stupid people, Moodhas, not
meant for Moodh.

19:46.460 --> 19:49.430
So now what is our benevolence is?

19:49.430 --> 19:54.430
Let us see.

19:54.430 --> 19:56.260
Is it money?

19:56.260 --> 19:57.850
No.

19:57.850 --> 20:05.730
Those who have money don’t seem to be very
happy people always.

20:05.730 --> 20:07.400
Then what is the next, is jobs?

20:07.400 --> 20:12.730
Those who have jobs – all right, should
have jobs, I am not saying you should be jobless.

20:12.730 --> 20:20.270
I mean immediately the another side they will
take, I mean so quick you know, that, “Mother

20:20.270 --> 20:28.260
is saying we can be jobless you see, nice.”

20:28.260 --> 20:30.040
Immediate, escapes.

20:30.040 --> 20:37.900
Now, then the power: you want to have political
power, this social power, this power, that

20:37.900 --> 20:44.720
power – is absolutely a joyless pursuit.

20:44.720 --> 20:52.710
You go and see those people who are supposed
to be powerful, so called, half way they are

20:52.710 --> 21:03.299
towards hell, one foot there and one foot
here and about to be gulped down by the crocodiles.

21:03.299 --> 21:09.419
You can see it clearly.

21:09.419 --> 21:15.549
Specially in this Kali Yuga it’s so obvious,
so clear-cut.

21:15.549 --> 21:23.750
We don’t want to be like them, we want to
be like Shri Ganesh.

21:23.750 --> 21:29.770
So once you start accepting your circumstances,
accepting your body, your… accepting your

21:29.770 --> 21:47.929
face, everything, you will see that lot of
time will be saved.

21:47.929 --> 21:58.270
Another problem that faces us is planning.

21:58.270 --> 22:01.690
And that is missing in Shri Ganesha completely.

22:01.690 --> 22:04.300
He did not do any planning whatsoever.

22:04.300 --> 22:11.500
I wish He had done some planning, things would
have been much better.

22:11.500 --> 22:18.250
He doesn’t believe in planning because He
is so powerful.

22:18.250 --> 22:22.710
Whatever He wants, He can get it done.

22:22.710 --> 22:23.710
You want the sun?

22:23.710 --> 22:25.790
All right the sun is there.

22:25.790 --> 22:26.790
You want the moon?

22:26.790 --> 22:27.790
Moon is there.

22:27.790 --> 22:28.790
You want the stars?

22:28.790 --> 22:29.790
Stars is there.

22:29.790 --> 22:41.280
The
dust of His feet can create the whole universe

22:41.280 --> 22:46.970
– universes after universes.

22:46.970 --> 22:58.970
For such a person, there is no need to be
planning everything because whatever He wants

22:58.970 --> 23:01.980
happens.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.030
But why, why it happens?

23:05.030 --> 23:09.740
Why He has this power?

23:09.740 --> 23:14.059
Because He is in that state.

23:14.059 --> 23:22.570
Are you in that state?

23:22.570 --> 23:25.540
You have not achieved that state.

23:25.540 --> 23:36.250
You talk somebody… tell somebody that, “Oh
my, I have to go and catch the plane.”

23:36.250 --> 23:41.650
There are ten people standing next to you,
they’ll all get panicky.

23:41.650 --> 23:48.799
I have to go, and they are bothered; something
sort of goes off their heads.

23:48.799 --> 23:52.679
I don’t know what goes, they go amuck.

23:52.679 --> 23:54.130
I never tell them like that.

23:54.130 --> 23:59.560
I say, “There’s still time for the plane
to go, and don’t worry.

23:59.560 --> 24:08.410
When I reach there then the plane will leave
so you don’t worry.”

24:08.410 --> 24:21.720
But because of this kind of a… presumptions,
and the planning system of the mind, you just

24:21.720 --> 24:26.720
think that, “Now I have a plan to go today,
I must go.”

24:26.720 --> 24:27.720
Why?

24:27.720 --> 24:30.010
I won’t go.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.600
I may decide at the last minute I don’t
want to go.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.050
I’ll make the plane go away.

24:35.050 --> 24:40.100
We did that many a times, you know very well.

24:40.100 --> 24:47.910
I wanted to buy the Rome Ashram, so I saw
to it that the plane never arrived.

24:47.910 --> 24:52.910
But you have to be in that state.

24:52.910 --> 24:56.140
Specially buying this Cabella, you know what
happened.

24:56.140 --> 25:04.210
There were five great intellectuals on My
head sitting.

25:04.210 --> 25:09.100
I didn’t know how I will manage these five
intellectuals with all their planning, this,

25:09.100 --> 25:18.480
that; they made Me run up and down, do this
and that, Ultimately they all had to come

25:18.480 --> 25:20.490
here.

25:20.490 --> 25:22.530
But I was telling them, “Go and have a look.”

25:22.530 --> 25:34.030
Nobody would look at it, nobody would listen
to Me, nobody wanted to know about it.

25:34.030 --> 25:47.030
How things work out – is your pure desire
that can work out anything that you want.

25:47.030 --> 25:50.950
But you won’t want funny things also.

25:50.950 --> 25:55.940
Like Shri Ganesha would not like to follow
some entrepreneur who is saying, “Have a

25:55.940 --> 25:59.669
punk on your head”, or something.

25:59.669 --> 26:04.100
Is stupidity, all kinds of stupidities.

26:04.100 --> 26:10.250
Because you are stupid, these entrepreneurs
are having a good time; they can befool us

26:10.250 --> 26:12.840
all the time.

26:12.840 --> 26:25.180
At His state, He is Himself, on top of the
pure desire.

26:25.180 --> 26:31.140
The pure desire is on His stomach, tied up
nicely.

26:31.140 --> 26:48.530
It is to be seen in Sahaja Yoga how things
work out, how miraculously they work out,

26:48.530 --> 26:50.950
and these can happen to you also.

26:50.950 --> 26:57.580
All these Powers can come to you also.

26:57.580 --> 27:02.840
You know about some people who came to us
who didn’t know even how to sing.

27:02.840 --> 27:07.160
I mean, they had no voices; something very
funny they had – I mean I didn’t know

27:07.160 --> 27:12.789
from where they learnt to even talk.

27:12.789 --> 27:18.400
When they opened their mouths, if you were
at one note, they were on another note and

27:18.400 --> 27:23.970
they went on and on and on without even listening
to what they were singing.

27:23.970 --> 27:32.040
After some time, I find they are singing beautifully.

27:32.040 --> 27:36.840
So the Kundalini itself is working it out,
the pure desire is working it out, but what

27:36.840 --> 27:38.370
about you?

27:38.370 --> 27:44.690
What are you doing about it is to be seen.

27:44.690 --> 27:58.230
There are so many things that could be understood
very easily through the lifestyle of Shri

27:58.230 --> 27:59.240
Ganesha.

27:59.240 --> 28:13.799
The first and foremost thing for Him is to
obey His Mother – never to say no, no question,

28:13.799 --> 28:22.970
and also not to ask why.

28:22.970 --> 28:31.120
He will go and fight with all the Gods and
Goddesses and every one.

28:31.120 --> 28:38.250
And that’s what Christ has said, “Anything
against Me I’ve tolerated but nothing against

28:38.250 --> 28:42.909
the Holy Ghost.”

28:42.909 --> 28:57.600
There should be no question, there should
be no explanation.

28:57.600 --> 29:06.980
Sometimes even My patience goes out, the way
they do not want to accept what I am telling

29:06.980 --> 29:07.980
them.

29:07.980 --> 29:13.030
At the end of course they all come around,
no doubt – at the end.

29:13.030 --> 29:16.390
But you waste so much time convincing them.

29:16.390 --> 29:19.650
What is the reason?

29:19.650 --> 29:23.430
They have no wisdom to know what their Mother
is.

29:23.430 --> 29:32.650
Like, you know the story of Shri Ganesha that
His Mother said, “The one who goes round

29:32.650 --> 29:38.539
the Mother Earth, I will give you a present.”

29:38.539 --> 29:49.659
So, Ganesha again accepts a little mouse as
a transport – imagine.

29:49.659 --> 29:56.130
Nowadays people can’t believe it that Shri
Ganesha, so powerful, should accept just a

29:56.130 --> 29:58.600
mouse for His transport.

29:58.600 --> 30:10.350
Because He’s so humble; he doesn’t have
to show off His Lincoln or Mercedes to anyone;

30:10.350 --> 30:16.610
He is very comfortable with His mouse.

30:16.610 --> 30:19.900
Now what does He do?

30:19.900 --> 30:22.890
He thinks that…

30:22.890 --> 30:29.790
He understands, in no time, that His Mother
is much greater than the Mother Earth.

30:29.790 --> 30:34.309
“So why should I go round the Mother Earth?”

30:34.309 --> 30:41.750
His brother is going round on a peacock.

30:41.750 --> 30:46.960
He just goes round His Mother – He gets
the present.

30:46.960 --> 31:01.520
It’s such a simple thing to understand because
He is the wisest person.

31:01.520 --> 31:18.170
The wisest person knows what is what, he knows
who is who, he knows what are the qualities

31:18.170 --> 31:20.280
of these persons.

31:20.280 --> 31:31.210
He is not impressed by superficial things,
no.

31:31.210 --> 31:39.340
If somebody is well dressed, then people get
very much impressed by them, and they turn

31:39.340 --> 31:52.580
out to be bank robbers – walking with umbrellas
and with lined suits, as if some big executives

31:52.580 --> 32:02.970
are coming, and they decamp with all the loot.

32:02.970 --> 32:15.380
So for a wise person, the superficial behavior
doesn’t appeal, not bothered.

32:15.380 --> 32:31.029
It is a kind of a very penetrating intelligence;
just like a computer you know.

32:31.029 --> 32:33.370
In a second you know that what is this gentleman.

32:33.370 --> 32:40.549
Oh, he may come with a great, you see, ado
and he might come and praise you and do this

32:40.549 --> 32:50.110
and do that and you know the person very well.

32:50.110 --> 33:00.940
If some body is unduly very friendly, very
kind, very nice, not necessarily that he is

33:00.940 --> 33:11.549
really appreciating you but he is looking
at your purse, maybe, maybe something else.

33:11.549 --> 33:21.059
But not only on this level, it is even on
a spiritual level we have to understand how

33:21.059 --> 33:33.090
people try to put you down spiritually; what
they try, what tricks they try on you.

33:33.090 --> 33:41.130
It could be your husband, your wife, your
children, your relations, your friends, anybody,

33:41.130 --> 33:43.200
any Sahaja Yogi.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.220
But in the case of Shri Ganesha, it’s the
other way round.

33:46.220 --> 33:52.620
They say that if you put one apple, bad apple,
all the apples get spoilt.

33:52.620 --> 34:03.900
But if you put Shri Ganesha among all the
bad apples, they’ll get all right.

34:03.900 --> 34:08.880
Because He’s the life-giving force.

34:08.880 --> 34:24.870
This is one of the greatest qualities, that
He knows that He is the source of life and

34:24.870 --> 34:28.270
He gives life, He gives Chaitanya.

34:28.270 --> 34:36.550
He doesn’t say… think that, “Now supposing
I give Chaitanya, give life to this person,

34:36.550 --> 34:39.960
my ego will come up,” – very common problem.

34:39.960 --> 34:47.050
“Mother I don’t want to do it because
my ego will come up.”

34:47.050 --> 34:51.119
Everybody is psychoanalyzing themselves ‘because
this will happen’ – Baba!

34:51.119 --> 34:53.000
[- Hindi expression of a general exclamatory
nature –ed.]

34:53.000 --> 34:57.710
You are all realized souls now, you are all
saints.

34:57.710 --> 35:03.910
The false people are talking so big, and you
the people who have got something are still

35:03.910 --> 35:07.250
thinking, “My ego will come up, this will
happen.”

35:07.250 --> 35:13.130
No, no, you have the powers.

35:13.130 --> 35:23.950
But as you keep it under a manger, as Christ
has said, the light will go out.

35:23.950 --> 35:35.869
You have to give it to others, you have to
open it out.

35:35.869 --> 35:37.950
And that is how you will judge your state.

35:37.950 --> 35:40.600
“What is my state?

35:40.600 --> 35:42.670
Let’s see.

35:42.670 --> 35:45.760
Where am I?”

35:45.760 --> 35:53.250
That confidence, take it from Me, should be
with you.

35:53.250 --> 35:58.790
All of you have to work out this way.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.770
Very many…

36:00.770 --> 36:03.040
“Mother, my Mooladhara is caught up.”

36:03.040 --> 36:06.920
How dare anybody catch Mooladhar?

36:06.920 --> 36:10.970
That’s the anger of Shri Ganesha.

36:10.970 --> 36:14.260
How dare?

36:14.260 --> 36:17.869
How can anybody?

36:17.869 --> 36:26.670
What’s missing is complete faith in yourself
and faith in your Mother.

36:26.670 --> 36:34.650
In Russia recently… in Prague, there was
a lady who was brought on the stage, very

36:34.650 --> 36:35.850
old lady, couldn’t walk.

36:35.850 --> 36:42.119
I mean they just carried her and she came
and sat before Me on a chair.

36:42.119 --> 36:44.380
She said, “I know You…

36:44.380 --> 36:45.730
I’ll be cured.

36:45.730 --> 36:49.640
I am in Your presence; I know I will be cured.”

36:49.640 --> 36:50.760
I said, “Then get up.”

36:50.760 --> 36:51.990
She got up.

36:51.990 --> 36:56.530
Those who were with Me in Prague, you can
ask them.

36:56.530 --> 37:02.869
She came down and she started running, and
everybody laughed.

37:02.869 --> 37:15.550
But her faith – she was not a Sahaja Yogini
as such – but she was sure; she knew Me.

37:15.550 --> 37:19.660
And she just started running like that and
everybody started looking at her.

37:19.660 --> 37:28.360
Same thing happened in Russia for many people
– very serious diseases.

37:28.360 --> 37:37.359
So that, one thing is for sure, either you
don’t know that you are realized souls or

37:37.359 --> 37:41.630
else you don’t know Me, one of the two things.

37:41.630 --> 37:44.640
Why was He so obedient to His Mother?

37:44.640 --> 37:46.310
Why was He?

37:46.310 --> 37:48.090
Because that was the wisest thing to do.

37:48.090 --> 38:00.310
The one who knows everything, it’s better
to be guided by that person.

38:00.310 --> 38:04.690
And many a times I have seen, people try to
do things without telling Me, important things

38:04.690 --> 38:07.559
– they fall into traps.

38:07.559 --> 38:14.800
Then they come back to Me and I tell them
the solution, it works.

38:14.800 --> 38:20.360
It’s not necessary that you should tell
Me everything.

38:20.360 --> 38:31.440
But when you are in a fix, you can always
just go into yourself and ask yourself, “What

38:31.440 --> 38:32.470
would Mother do?”

38:32.470 --> 38:35.410
You’ll get the answer.

38:35.410 --> 38:37.760
You are at a… quite a higher state.

38:37.760 --> 38:43.180
But still, even if you are on a tree and you
are still thinking you are falling down, you

38:43.180 --> 38:45.430
are nowhere.

38:45.430 --> 38:47.680
Steady yourself.

38:47.680 --> 38:57.520
That’s what is, we say, the Adhishthan of
Shri Ganesha.

38:57.520 --> 39:06.230
Is the steadiness, steadiness in your achievements
of Sahaj Yog.

39:06.230 --> 39:14.070
Believing in yourself that you have entered
into the new world, into the new atmosphere

39:14.070 --> 39:17.880
[UNCLEAR] it out.

39:17.880 --> 39:25.060
Shri Ganesha is just waiting.

39:25.060 --> 39:28.950
But He is not meant for people who have no
courage.

39:28.950 --> 39:45.933
Such a courageous man who could go and fight
with all the Devas, because He knew the Shakti

39:45.933 --> 39:52.540
was with Him.

39:52.540 --> 40:01.900
Today is such a joyous day for Me because
we have children, and we are dealing with

40:01.900 --> 40:02.900
children.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.900
Most of them are born realized.

40:04.900 --> 40:15.900
They are of a very special category, I have
told you many a times, but we spoil them;

40:15.900 --> 40:24.010
because we were not born realized, so we don’t
know how to handle these children, we spoil

40:24.010 --> 40:25.010
them.

40:25.010 --> 40:30.540
Not only we spoil them, but we interfere with
the school, we interfere with this as if we

40:30.540 --> 40:40.660
are the wisest parents ever living.

40:40.660 --> 40:47.170
Because we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to be
much more sensible than other parents.

40:47.170 --> 40:50.680
How can you interfere with any school anywhere?

40:50.680 --> 40:58.700
But in Sahaja Yoga you will.

40:58.700 --> 41:08.930
It is because there is no wisdom and no understanding
what is good and benevolent for your child.

41:08.930 --> 41:13.900
If you love your child, then you must think
of its benevolent.

41:13.900 --> 41:20.790
You must learn from the experience what happens
to children if they are left like that.

41:20.790 --> 41:27.940
You cannot spoil your child, you cannot because
it’s a special category of children they

41:27.940 --> 41:28.940
are.

41:28.940 --> 41:40.280
They are not children who can become vagabonds;
they cannot become thieves.

41:40.280 --> 41:47.970
So you will make them something funny – they
are neither here nor there.

41:47.970 --> 41:56.570
They are born realized and they have to be
channelized properly, to achieve their complete

41:56.570 --> 42:04.400
manifestation of their Spirit.

42:04.400 --> 42:14.579
So the possessiveness and the stupid attachments
to children must be given up.

42:14.579 --> 42:20.410
There is no force on you – if you want to
destroy a child, you can destroy.

42:20.410 --> 42:27.060
But in an advice – if you were Ganeshas,
you would have understood it, I don’t have

42:27.060 --> 42:31.250
to explain so much.

42:31.250 --> 42:38.910
What is good for your child, because we have
to have beautiful children.

42:38.910 --> 42:41.200
They are born beautiful children, I tell you.

42:41.200 --> 42:45.930
If they are spoilt, it is because of you,
you have spoilt them.

42:45.930 --> 42:48.350
You have ruined them.

42:48.350 --> 42:50.910
You are responsible.

42:50.910 --> 42:58.810
I know of so many children – they’re very,
very sweet.

42:58.810 --> 43:06.510
I have conference with them also and I find
them much more congenial; I have much better

43:06.510 --> 43:11.670
rapport with them than I can have with you.

43:11.670 --> 43:14.750
They never argue, never.

43:14.750 --> 43:25.599
They never says no, and they have very good
information about all of you.

43:25.599 --> 43:32.540
So it is such a nice thing that today you
should desire that our children should very

43:32.540 --> 43:43.390
soon become the images of Shri Ganesha, His
Ganas, who have to work out so much.

43:43.390 --> 43:46.670
It’s a tremendous task.

43:46.670 --> 43:54.650
Sahaja Yoga is the greatest achievement of
Spiritual evolution.

43:54.650 --> 43:59.250
We all have to dedicate ourselves.

43:59.250 --> 44:05.220
We don’t have to sacrifice anything as the
Saints have sacrificed – nothing, don’t

44:05.220 --> 44:06.800
have to suffer anything.

44:06.800 --> 44:09.700
Only thing you have to have – wisdom.

44:09.700 --> 44:16.119
For that, I am very happy that today we are
worshipping Shri Ganesha.

44:16.119 --> 44:24.820
So the pure desire should be that, “Shri
Ganesha please give us Divine Wisdom.”

44:24.820 --> 44:26.800
That’s all.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.270
It contains everything in it.

44:28.270 --> 44:29.270
May God bless you.

44:29.270 --> 44:30.270
Today’s Puja is going to be quite short
and the children have to come up today, first

44:30.270 --> 44:31.270
of all – all the children.

44:31.270 --> 44:31.273
End of transcript.
