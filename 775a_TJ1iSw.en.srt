1
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:23,550
In one of My lectures, I talked to you
about the emotional intelligence.

2
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,449
That is what we should try to imbibe.

3
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:37,086
Emotional intelligence, that means
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

4
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,166
Unless and until we become emotionally
intelligent,

5
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:44,510
our society cannot improve.

6
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:52,495
In an emotional intelligence, you care
and you enjoy caring.

7
00:00:52,696 --> 00:01:01,729
You do everything for others with a great
emotional understanding.

8
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,953
Not for one child, not for one son,

9
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:12,034
but for everyone you have to be
emotionally intelligent.

10
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:16,253
Some children are born like this, but some
are to be made like that,

11
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:21,192
that they should be emotionally
intelligent.

12
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:28,841
Because, if the mother and father are
money-oriented, very selfish,

13
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:34,989
they wouldn’t allow their child to give
anything to others.

14
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,503
So such a child will grow into a very
funny type of a person

15
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:45,573
and will never do anything for anybody,
not even for his own country.

16
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:50,565
Why should he do it? Everything
for selfishness.

17
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:57,253
Then such people indulge into corruption,
indulge into all kinds of things,

18
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:02,787
which are only selfish in attitude.

19
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:06,130
Now we are talking of collectivity.

20
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:13,520
In collectivity, we do for others.
We enjoy doing for others.

21
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,677
We love giving things to others, not
for yourself,

22
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:21,508
because your children will also become
the same kind

23
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,935
and they will only bother about themselves.

24
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,797
This emotional intelligence has to be
brought in our life.

25
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:37,865
In our pattern that we have, are we
emotionally intelligent

26
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:46,166
or we are just intelligent or emotional?
Both things are wrong.

27
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:50,744
If you are just intelligent, you can become
very dry person.

28
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:56,652
You may just have few friends maybe,
you may not have

29
00:02:56,853 --> 00:03:04,146
and you will always try to preserve
yourself away from the collectivity.

30
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:09,758
And if you are emotional, you’ll be
attached only to one person,

31
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,633
attached to one child, maybe, attached
to one person, to someone,

32
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:19,958
even in the society. For no rhyme
or reason. Why?

33
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,690
Why are you attached to one person?

34
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,571
Why are you bothered about one person only?

35
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:31,657
All such people fall into such terrible
prey.

36
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:35,044
In the politics you have seen how people
try to help

37
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:38,581
their own sons and own daughters and
this and that.

38
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:46,542
And we Indians have suffered a lot with
this kind of an emotional attachment.

39
00:03:49,674 --> 00:04:02,262
So, according to ethics, emotional
intelligence is the highest quality,

40
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:06,940
by which you give to others,

41
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:12,229
you care for others, for everyone

42
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:16,697
and you become very, very collective.

43
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:26,410
Now exclusiveness is another fashion
that’s very miserable, it’s exclusive.

44
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:32,627
Because you don’t want to be one of the
multitudes. You want to be exclusive.

45
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:38,830
You should be exclusive in emotional
intelligence,

46
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:44,338
not on other things. That is the best thing
you can have.

47
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:49,815
As I agree, I am just a woman and just
a Mother,

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,805
but what I have is really the emotional
intelligence, ocean of it,

49
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:06,818
and from that I know about everyone,
I understand about everyone.

50
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,436
And all this work has been done because
of that quality in My head.

51
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:18,408
I’m not attached to one person or
to one style.

52
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:22,665
Whatever you say, I can understand,

53
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:29,484
because I am at a level where I can
understand everything that you are doing.

54
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:35,562
To achieve that, you try to develop
emotional intelligence.

55
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:41,500
Here the children won’t even give a toy
to somebody to play [with].

56
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:47,609
Even the mother is like that, the father
is like that, extremely selfish

57
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,927
and: “We must have our own, you see,
everything should be our own.”

58
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:57,864
This has to go. This has to go, from
Americans especially,

59
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:06,193
because they are the leading nation
in this kind of selfishness.

60
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:11,079
What selfishness they have done, I need
not count, but you know that.

61
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,688
You go and ask the people of Canada,
Mexico, Peru, all this, they will tell you.

62
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,360
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

63
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:25,891
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

64
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:33,352
Nobody can even tell them, because they
think they are very rich people.

65
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:39,915
But all these riches will not give them
the joy of life.

66
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:46,024
Joy of life is only in the emotional
intelligence.

67
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:49,688
If you don’t have that, it becomes
very dry.

68
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:53,704
Life becomes very odd, unbearable,
horrible

69
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:59,110
and even the family gets broken up,

70
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:03,173
if there is no emotional intelligence
in the family.

71
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:05,816
I have known so many women

72
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:10,239
who have had three marriages, five
marriages. I don’t know how they can do it.

73
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,896
But they have done because of this lack
of emotional intelligence.

74
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:21,859
It is something that is a sense of giving.

75
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,711
It is not that you are sacrificing
anything, no!

76
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:31,847
That’s also another idea, that we have
to bear this - nothing of the kind.

77
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:36,118
Look at the life of Christ, He gave
His life. Why?

78
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,949
What was the need for Him to do that?
Behind Him was the Truth.

79
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,394
When you have the Truth with you, the light
of the Truth, the force of the Truth,

80
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:53,292
the strength of the Truth, you become
emotionally intelligent.

81
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:57,027
You understand that, if you really love
something,

82
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:03,173
then you have to undergo every kind
of trouble.

83
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:05,784
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

84
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,542
I know it’s too much to say, but I thought
that, for this special Puja,

85
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:16,738
I should say something about the family
life.

86
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:23,183
In our ashrams or in our programs,
or wherever we are,

87
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:31,235
we should remember this point, that:
“Are we having that emotional intelligence

88
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:35,792
when we are trying to talk about
Sahaja Yoga?”

89
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:39,046
Why do I need to be every place to tell
them?

90
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:42,558
What is the need? You can tell them.

91
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:49,113
If you have that emotional intelligence,
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

92
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:52,599
Not necessarily I should go everywhere
and talk to them.

93
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,513
How many countries can I visit?

94
00:08:55,714 --> 00:09:01,527
And the reaction to it is so beautiful and
so nice. It’s very surprising.

95
00:09:01,728 --> 00:09:05,856
Like in a country like Benin country,
all Muslims there,

96
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:12,655
all black people, they all have become
Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand people.

97
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:16,996
How could I capture that? Just think
of that.

98
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:23,611
Nine thousand people suddenly will come.
Then also other countries I have seen.

99
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:27,660
Just this is the power of emotional
intelligence

100
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:31,496
that captures the heart of the people.

101
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:36,293
You may have any amount of property,
money, everything,

102
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:41,287
people will abhor you. All right. So you
may say: “What’s wrong?”

103
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:45,209
What’s wrong is this that you are harming

104
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:53,099
the greatest thing, is the human being.

105
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,996
And the politicians they are horrible,
as they say.

106
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:01,371
Why? Because they have no emotional
intelligence.

107
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:08,089
Also as administrators, they are very
much difficult,

108
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,342
because they have no emotional
intelligence.

109
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:20,724
All these people are devoid of that great
quality of emotional intelligence.

110
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:24,292
If your country is very progressive,
I must say

111
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:27,761
you must progress in emotional
intelligence.

112
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,740
That way, they have philanthropists,
I know.

113
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:33,365
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

114
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:39,131
But behind that is they want to have
power.

115
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:43,935
They want to rule people with that money.

116
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:48,983
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they
just want to rule.

117
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:52,998
If they start some sort of a charity,

118
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:57,233
that is just to have a big name
on the television,

119
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:03,061
or to have a very great advertisement
about, “Oh, he has...”

120
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:07,608
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

121
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:13,146
Wee part of it they will donate, wee part
of their property, work it out

122
00:11:13,347 --> 00:11:18,503
and make such a fuss about it, because
they want to cash everything.

123
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:21,792
Cash has been given, so cash everything.

124
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:25,266
You are Sahaja Yogis.

125
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,284
You have to send waves of emotional
intelligence.

126
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:33,972
You have to send love to all over
the world.

127
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:38,729
You have to show how you can, with love,
win over.

128
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,226
It is also possible, if you are not so
attached.

129
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:46,804
If you are attached, say to your
country only -

130
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:52,881
now this is a bigger issue - then you will
try to exploit other countries,

131
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:56,578
take advantage of them, try to run them
down.

132
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,531
But if you are emotionally attached
to your country,

133
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:05,281
then you’ll bring good name to your country
by doing real good work.

134
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:09,851
I don’t know why people do not know
how to discriminate.

135
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,140
Why are they so selfish, trying to build
them up,

136
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:20,296
trying to do all the good things
for themselves?

137
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:27,002
There is a very great chance for all of you
to get this

138
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:31,533
within you, your reach, because you are
all Sahaja Yogis.

139
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,995
You have become like lotuses.

140
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:38,706
And the lotus has the fragrance which
spreads all over

141
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:42,970
and days together it stays in the water,
in that dirty water,

142
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:46,050
and it spreads the fragrance.

143
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:49,520
With that fragrance also, you can do lots
of things,

144
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:57,848
that the bees come there, they sleep
in that beautiful house of the lotus

145
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:01,996
and in the night it closes down very
carefully.

146
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:23,376
All kinds of things that come for the
flower to take the beauty of that flower,

147
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:30,689
you can say, because you can extract also
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

148
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,553
You can also get some honey out of that.
Whatever is possible,

149
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:39,884
everybody comes to that flower.

150
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,430
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way
is weak,

151
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:49,757
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

152
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:55,610
That’s what you are. You are all made
into lotuses.

153
00:13:55,811 --> 00:14:05,056
You are not made into some sort of creeps
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

154
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:10,587
You are the people who are to give
fragrance of your love,

155
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:17,040
fragrance of your compassion to others.
And you should feel happy about it.

156
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:21,493
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

157
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,907
But it means that, whatever you have,

158
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,399
whatever is your possibility, capability,

159
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,420
you must try to do for others, give it
to them.
