1
00:00:00,048 --> 00:00:04,587
Sahaja Yoga has emerged,

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:07,690
but

3
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:13,667
it is not so easy for a human to understand Sahaja Yoga.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,167
If you get a great thing like Sahaja Yoga so easily,

5
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:22,500
its greatness,

6
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:27,167
its assessment,

7
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:31,222
reverence for the shakti,

8
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:33,523
devotion for the Shakti,

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:41,333
the hard work required to fully integrate it inside with full mind,

10
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,182
all these things will be lacking.

11
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:51,500
That is why you notice that many are very casual.

12
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,452
But the other swamijis,

13
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:01,539
you know how they consider the people,

14
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,373
and how they exploit them.

15
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:08,667
They take money from you,

16
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:12,823
make you do hard work, make you stand on your head,

17
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:16,833
make you do bodily work, some or other hard work

18
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:23,452
so that your ego gets satisfied a little bit

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,404
and you stick to it.

20
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:29,595
You may also have seen such people,

21
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:33,611
who give away everything they have, like money, etc.

22
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:37,333
to these swamijis and then they sweep at Swamijiís place.

23
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,492
One gets Sahaja Yoga

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,817
with such ease,

25
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:53,571
they are casual towards it.

26
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:56,944
Like they got their eyes so easily,

27
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,576
they are casual, they do not know the value of these eyes.

28
00:02:01,777 --> 00:02:06,500
But the day we have a problem with the eye, we will say ëOh, Godí.

29
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:11,000
That is why one must have difficulties.

30
00:02:11,476 --> 00:02:15,428
If there is no difficulty, the Sahaja Yogi will not care for it at all.

31
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,862
How long difficulties will be there will depend on you,

32
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:31,555
it will be there till you hold on to them, what can be done about it?

33
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:41,214
There are some people, you know, once they are realised, they are realised; it will not touch them.

34
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,683
They will never have difficulties;

35
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:48,841
it is due to the Punyas (good deeds) from their previous lives.

36
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,833
They should also be alert.

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,404
They should not be unduly happy, ëWe do not have any difficulty, so we are special, no problemí.

38
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:10,833
Being casual towards

39
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,484
Sahaja Yoga will prove costly.

40
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:23,696
If you are casual towards yourself, there is no harm,

41
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:26,989
because there is someone to look after your eyes,

42
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,333
hands, legs, body-there is someone to look after, ready.

43
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,204
You donít have to look after it.

44
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:37,722
But your Sahaja Yoga, you have to look after yourselves.

45
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,370
There is a big difference between the two.

46
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,933
All your body will be managed, whatever other things which,

47
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:48,140
I call your three dimensions, will all be managed.

48
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,500
But your Sahaja Yoga, only you have to practice.

49
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:58,333
You have to flow in that, but you are so casual,

50
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:00,404
so casual,

51
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:03,188
even if someone is sitting next to you,

52
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,951
you donít tell him, meet him, talk about this and dedicate to Sahaja Yoga.

53
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,571
There are many people and different parts of the body - (alluding to the Sahaja Yogis)- are separated

54
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:21,936
Yesterday a girl had a problem and her brother came, he got realisation in a split second.

55
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:27,694
Lots of your limbs have fallen in this world and you have to gather them,

56
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:30,150
even that is a big Sahaja Yoga.

57
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:34,500
In your own house, how can one be outside Sahaja Yoga?

58
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:37,743
If you are in my house, you have to come to Sahaja Yoga,

59
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,870
get realisation and you should not have any problem.

60
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,349
You should insist, you should not get angry with them.

61
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:49,095
You have to tell them about this, talk about this, but you should not be casual.

62
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:58,420
Eat, rise, sit and as you take a breath and with every breath,

63
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,976
you have to propose Sahaja Yoga.

64
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:09,436
Because, if you consider yourself a special form,

65
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:14,499
and if you think that there is something special about your temple,

66
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,920
there should be ringing of bells all the time,

67
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:21,785
otherwise it will be a waste.

68
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,460
Sahaja Yoga also can go waste.

69
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,857
You understand this.

70
00:05:36,444 --> 00:05:41,992
Another thing I want to tell you is that without Sahaja Yoga, you do not have a personality now.

71
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:48,253
Without that there is no glow.

72
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:53,167
Without that there is no acceptance.

73
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:59,833
If you come into the kingdom of God, you have to take citizenship!

74
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:11,515
I heard from many people, my brother came yesterday, he saidí ëI went to Gajanand Maharají.

75
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,682
I do not know who Gajanand Maharaj is.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,833
Phadke talked about Gajanand Maharaj.

77
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,037
Then, I saw that Agnya chakra, Vishuddhi chakra, and another chakra - three chakras were caught up.

78
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:27,142
He told his experience that he gets a catch from his photograph itself.

79
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:30,149
Three chakras were caught up.

80
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:35,167
I said, ëI am your sister sitting here and why did you go to Gajanand Maharaj?í

81
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:41,180
He said ëAll told me, he is a saintí. I said check from Vibrations, whether he is a saint or not.

82
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:44,261
He went casually. He should have checked.

83
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:46,333
Is this Sahaja Yoga?

84
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:53,230
After becoming a King, one who becomes a beggar,

85
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,529
he should be removed.

86
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,222
But you are becoming a beggar knowingly.

87
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:11,299
Went casually, went there also. What to do, my wife is like this,

88
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,484
what to do, my father is like this what to do, my daughter said let us go and I went.

89
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:22,114
Then what happened, After coming back, Mataji, my Agnya chakra is caught up,

90
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:25,752
have a catch in the stomach, Nabhi chakra is caught up, three chakras are caught up.

91
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:30,667
I am your own sister sitting here, who asked you to go to Gajanand Maharaj?

92
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:36,667
Then we thought our condition was bad, so let us go to Saibaba.

93
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,902
Then I said, first you come here, get the stomach fixed, then go to Saibaba.

94
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:47,696
If you go there also what wisdom will you get? Thousands go there, what happens there?

95
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:51,817
What do you want to ask? Want to ask for material things from Saibaba?

96
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,206
When will manís material desires be fulfilled?

97
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:02,167
Everything is done, what do you want materially?

98
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:07,976
You have become a king, what do you still want?

99
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,325
What I have come to give,

100
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,182
what you have to get,

101
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,204
that is very important.

102
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:23,246
For the human race,

103
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,904
God has made a human after a lot of contemplation.

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There is so much dirt in your brains collected from here and there, throw it away.

105
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:39,666
You have collected a lot of useless things, junk.

106
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,984
Throw away from this temple and make that temple prestigious.

107
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:47,539
Have to light a lamp in each and every heart.

108
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,333
Purify your house, purify your

109
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,642
family, purify your society.

110
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:03,047
You care a lot for your relatives!

111
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,609
You have a lot of relatives.

112
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,632
ëI have come for them, my mother-in-law has come, I have to give her, I have to do something for her.

113
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,688
What will your mother-in-law give you,

114
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,498
When you go, she will give you thrashing with footwear.

115
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:23,979
These are your relatives, Know that.

116
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,444
You do not have any relatives, other than these.

117
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,735
Only a Sahaja Yogi is the relative of a Sahaja Yogi because they speak a distinct language.

118
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:37,333
Their ways are different, their stride is different.

119
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,380
You have to give your life.

120
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:56,000
And love.
You have to share your love.

121
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:03,585
Love will flow on the edge of the mind, Correct your mind, make your mind light.

122
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:06,093
If you keep so much in your mind,

123
00:10:06,294 --> 00:10:10,801
how will Sahaja Yoga get in there? It is working on the mind, watch.

124
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,667
God is sitting to pour on you.

125
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:25,214
But where is your attention? It keeps wavering every two minutes.

126
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:31,667
You have to put your attention at His feet, He does not want your money, etc.

127
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:35,823
Keep it with you. What is the importance of all the collections made from deaths?

128
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:37,854
Make your attention important.

129
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,285
God will descend on that mind.

130
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:46,000
He has made you younger by ten to twenty years.

131
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,531
Your body has become alright.

132
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,785
Thoughts of your mind have been purified.

133
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,767
You have got collective consciousness.

134
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:57,968
Now what?

135
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:02,220
Still, you are running after this and that.

136
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:05,119
Do you attach more importance to that?

137
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:07,739
In your previous lives, you have earned a lot of dung.

138
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,262
You have left it here and gone. Again gather it!

139
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,005
You will again leave it here and go.

140
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:16,555
It is very dangerous to be casual for a Sahaja Yogi.

141
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:23,230
This is called negligence.

142
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:27,658
A big war has arisen.

143
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:34,600
You know that

144
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:40,349
other ways of destruction have been kept ready.

145
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:46,833
Sahaja Yoga is standing like a lotus in this mud;

146
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:53,785
delicate,

147
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:55,492
aromatic,

148
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:56,802
fragrant,

149
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:58,143
beautiful

150
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,349
and you are petals of that.

151
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:13,023
All the mud which is there will fall off once you know that you are the lotus,

152
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,777
you are not the mud.

153
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:21,167
But by chance if a chakra catches, it is mud, remove it.

154
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:23,833
You have been made a lotus.

155
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:30,793
You are the lotus and if the mud falls on the lotus, the lotus should throw it away

156
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:33,587
and also it is also not going to stick.

157
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:44,667
Everyone has to be aware of Sahaja Yoga.

158
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:49,458
If you have to cross with the ferry of Sahaja Yoga, donít get bogged down

159
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:52,134
by small problems of family

160
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:56,167
and small problems in the house.

161
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,989
How long are you going to hold onto this mud with your hand?

162
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,817
There is no one to support you.

163
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:10,942
The boy is to be married, the girl is to be married,

164
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:13,667
it may happen, may not happen.

165
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:16,706
You will spend money on that.

166
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,833
You will earn a name in that.

167
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,230
And for Sahaja Yoga?

168
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,246
For Sahaja Yoga, you have no time.

169
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:34,039
The most important thing is

170
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:38,167
that Indians donít have much money.

171
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:44,325
If you look at it,

172
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:49,492
their financial condition is not that good.

173
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:55,880
But we should know that vibrations are there only in India, which controls everything.

174
00:13:56,603 --> 00:14:01,500
If it were any other country it would have collapsed by now.

175
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:06,126
You are living only with the help of those Vibrations.

176
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:09,388
What a big country!

177
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,214
You are born in such a great country.

178
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,267
You know everything.

179
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:17,982
I donít know how to tell the English about Devi mahatmyam, they have not read it.

180
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:21,172
They donít know what Devi is and what Maa is.

181
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,515
They are such dirty people they donít know what Maa is;

182
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:27,880
how can I tell them what Maa is, I feel like crying.

183
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,698
And you have become so casual and you sit in meditation as if for a shave.

184
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:39,833
How will it happen?!

185
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,362
My brothers asked me ëwhy are you struggling day in and day out?

186
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:54,420
If your health gets affected, what will we tell your husband?

187
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,928
You sleep at night at 4 or 5 and the whole day you are working.

188
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:04,061
Why are you doing it? What are you going to get,

189
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:07,936
we donít understandí. Now they will not understand nor will I!

190
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:12,904
When we both have an understanding then only something will happen.

191
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:19,856
I can fight it out alone,

192
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:22,721
but how will you benefit from that?

193
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:34,333
Being casual, walking casually are signs of showing apathy towards yourself.

194
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:37,333
Itís disrespectful to yourself.

195
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:46,167
The king who got the entire wealth is being so casual.

196
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,865
Rule,

197
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:50,944
Relax!

198
00:15:54,968 --> 00:16:01,365
Are you going to finish Sahaja Yoga on small issues?

199
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:07,577
You clean your inner being, you clean your heart. Leave the over smartness.

200
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:10,761
Cleanse your heart and check

201
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:16,428
 ëAre we sitting in innocence?í

202
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,167
You are not doing a favour to me.

203
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:31,150
It is for you;

204
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:36,039
you are getting what you have been asking,

205
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:39,738
what you have been searching for ages, you are getting.

206
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:45,198
When you have reached the pinnacle, why are you being mad?

207
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:52,700
You may not have seen those who turn their face away when they reach the pinnacle, but I have seen.

208
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:58,087
First, you have to make them stick. Have to keep on saying, ëstick-on, stick on!í

209
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:17,833
Sometimes I think of you like this;

210
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:21,547
ëwhat can we do? Things are so bad in our country.

211
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,933
We are poor people, we have our problems,

212
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:28,492
how can we uplift the country, Mataji? You have put us on a higher pedestalí.

213
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:37,500
It is good that you donít have money.

214
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:42,680
I have given realisation to so many rich people here. Where are they?

215
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:46,426
See only 2 or 4 here. They are even very miserly, we donít have a rich man among us.

216
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:49,333
I have given realisation to millionaires.

217
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:54,075
What are they doing? It is good you donít have money, it is a hassle.

218
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:56,276
Very little is sticking to you.

219
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,920
Less money is very good.

220
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:03,124
I have seen rich people,

221
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:09,000
people holding positions, Ministers. They donít have the happiness which you have.

222
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:18,682
They get realisation and sit back in style, and sit with a lot of money.

223
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:24,167
Ministers and Secretaries have got their realisation.

224
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,037
What have they done?

225
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,601
God save us from their arrogance.

226
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:33,333
For God who is Secretary and who is king?

227
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,456
Marathi talk for about 1 minut.

228
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:54,238
They are better than you because they do not have the dirt of money.

229
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:58,880
They do not have any position,

230
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:03,388
to make them stupid.

231
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:07,333
They just want Mataji.

232
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:13,763
Yesterday a few children came. Their mother said, ëlet us goí. They were saying ëlet us stay backí.

233
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:19,156
They were not getting any chocolates, nothing. ëWe donít want any cinema, we only want Mataji.

234
00:20:19,357 --> 00:20:21,047
Letís go to Matajií.

235
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:27,571
They know more than you.

236
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:30,960
You also become like them.

237
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:36,031
Leave everything of the past and become like them. Now you become children.

238
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:42,103
How beautiful you are.

239
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,333
You are also like this, son!

240
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:50,603
You were also like this. Now you have all become deformed, disgusting.

241
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:02,143
Be worried about it.

242
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:04,936
See the beauty of others.

243
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:11,658
I will go.

244
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:18,126
When the mother is away it becomes the responsibility of children to look after the house.

245
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:28,666
When I come back I should see that My children have spread Sahaja Yoga.

246
00:21:29,825 --> 00:21:33,577
Otherwise, I will see that someone has a catch of Agnya chakra,

247
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:36,815
someone has a problem with the Nabhi chakra, someone has Vishuddhi problem.

248
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:40,997
Someone went there... Someone has fallen sick, someone is unwell,

249
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:44,719
someoneís wife is in hospital and someone is in a Lunatic Asylum.

250
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,841
What has happened?

251
00:21:53,611 --> 00:21:56,167
Donít think that we are small people.

252
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:58,785
You are a very great person.

253
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:03,277
So-called great people are useless, they donít get their realisation.

254
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:08,793
You realise your greatness and talk.

255
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:11,206
You talk openly.

256
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:18,476
If one speaks one letter of Sahaja Yoga,

257
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,109
Goddess Saraswati will come and sit there, I am telling you.

258
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,063
You speak and see. You will experience it.

259
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:30,021
Start talking about Sahaja Yoga, Saraswati will be in your voice,

260
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:33,507
you start writing, Saraswati will be in your writing.

261
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,029
Start any work Hanumana will stand there with folded hands,

262
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,039
Mother tell me, ëwith whom shall I stand?í

263
00:22:44,317 --> 00:22:46,418
Hanuman Ji is doing all your work.

264
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:52,000
Whatever work you take up in the name of Mataji whatever work you take in this world,

265
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:54,299
whatever it may be, he will do it.

266
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,174
For Sahaja Yoga work all the five Chiranjeevis- long lived-are standing by.

267
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,855
All of them are putting powers behind you and standing in the background.

268
00:23:05,056 --> 00:23:09,865
And Nat Ji who has come, he is in a bad shape, he is looking here and there.

269
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,667
How will the play be composed?

270
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,547
We donít want a half-hearted approach.

271
00:23:20,238 --> 00:23:23,426
ëI donít get time to meditateí. What do you mean I donít get the time?

272
00:23:23,627 --> 00:23:26,222
For what do you have time?

273
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,926
Who has given you time? If you donít get time for yourselves, God saves you. How do you not get the time?

274
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:32,989
Get up at 4 in the morning.

275
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,039
You have woken up your Mother. How many hours does She sleep?

276
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:39,667
Get up at 4 in the morning.

277
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,880
Tell your mind,

278
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:45,873
I have to meditate from 4 to 5. Throw away the sleep.

279
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:55,759
Stop staying awake in the nights, stop talking to useless people.

280
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,697
Leave worthless associations, leave aside relatives, they are all useless people.

281
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:00,997
They are all bhoots.

282
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:04,167
Have we come to waste our time for them?

283
00:24:08,056 --> 00:24:13,682
I donít spend even one moment, you will be surprised, on anything other than Sahaja Yoga.

284
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:17,045
Thousands of people come to my husbandís office,

285
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:20,728
whenever there is a reception; they all ask for their realisation.

286
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:26,825
Shake hands and they ask for realisation! Whichever country I go to, I give realisation.

287
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:31,720
They keep talking to me, I give realisation while talking.

288
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:35,999
I see that they have got realisation in a split second.

289
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,003
He keeps on talking about so many things.

290
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:43,809
Wherever I get an opportunity, I keep giving realisation.

291
00:24:49,952 --> 00:24:53,999
At Victoria station, there was a ticket collector. He was a Muslim.

292
00:24:57,056 --> 00:25:01,976
When I was buying the ticket, there was a long queue and I was giving realisation.

293
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:04,958
Maybe he was from Pakistan-from wherever he maybe.

294
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,142
I think he was from Pakistan.

295
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,886
While standing I was giving realisation and even to others who were standing there, I was giving realisation.

296
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:16,387
While he was issuing a ticket to me, he looked at me

297
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,602
and he got his realisation. So he gave a ticket to all

298
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:22,886
and came inside and sat inside my compartment.

299
00:25:23,181 --> 00:25:25,799
I was sitting alone in that compartment.

300
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:28,412
He asked Me, ëWho are You?

301
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:31,505
Why is there so much attraction in you?

302
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:33,396
I asked him, ëwho are you?í

303
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:37,730
He said his name was Hussain. I said, ëSit down, Hussain mianí.

304
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,275
I said, ëPut your hand like thisí.

305
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:41,569
He said, ëWhat is this cool breeze coming?

306
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,158
Who are you?

307
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:46,000
I said, ëSee and recognise.í

308
00:25:49,952 --> 00:25:53,005
I went to Rome. It is an incident that happened long back.

309
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:57,198
Many artists were sitting there. They were painting something.

310
00:25:57,627 --> 00:26:02,601
Gave realisation to one. He got up, told something to someone and fell at my feet,

311
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:08,196
sat, caught hold of both My feet and started crying, saying loudly, ëMother, when did you come?í

312
00:26:08,397 --> 00:26:12,783
I went there as the wife of an officer; three people were standing on this side and four people on that side.

313
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:15,307
Those people were embarrassed- what is this man doing?

314
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:18,878
He said, ëNo Mother, I found You. I saw You in my dream last night.

315
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,531
You said you will come wearing a white sari. And you have come wearing thatí.

316
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:30,976
Even for one moment, I canít think of anything other than Sahaja Yoga.

317
00:26:31,238 --> 00:26:36,124
I have forgotten all my past, there have been great lives, they have all become great.

318
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:40,726
I have forgotten everything, all the details. I only remember Sahaja Yoga.

319
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,801
I donít remember anything.

320
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:45,672
In the same way,

321
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:49,301
every moment you have to think of Sahaja Yoga,

322
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:52,497
wherever you are sitting there itself.

323
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:55,031
Throw away your watches first.

324
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:58,609
Throw away slavery to watches.

325
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,735
Become a slave of Sahaja Yoga,
Sahaja Yoga is your watch.

326
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:05,593
It was 12:30, no harm, you were sitting there, it is 3 you were still sitting there.

327
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:07,688
You were sitting in Sahaja Yoga.

328
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:11,452
Is Sahaja Yoga slave of the watch or time?

329
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,854
We are not slaves of any regulation or law.

330
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:20,095
We are only standing in Sahaja Yoga.

331
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:22,394
Whatever time it may take, we will sit there.

332
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:26,283
Wherever we are sitting, we will sit there. Are we slaves to the stomach that we have to eat on time?

333
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:28,484
We are not slaves to anything.

334
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:35,855
Everything keeps happening, it is going to happen.

335
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:39,563
First of all, you leave your slavery of everything, whatever old slavery is there leave it.

336
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:41,964
First of all, throw away watches.

337
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:46,870
No system has been made for anything.

338
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,720
No system can be made in Sahaja Yoga.

339
00:27:48,921 --> 00:27:51,728
Its own systems are being made, let them be made.

340
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:55,309
If you make the system, that will be hailed.

341
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:58,198
Donít enforce discipline.

342
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:03,839
Let its discipline be working inside.

343
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,974
Yes, those who have not got their realisation, discipline is required; you enforce it.

344
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:12,944
But those who are realised, they have to enforce discipline inside them.

345
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,000
The discipline will happen inside by itself.

346
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:27,004
Sahaja Yogi has an inner discipline.

347
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,379
But if there is indiscipline here, it canít be forgiven.

348
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:34,934
But one who is not a Sahaja Yogi, forgive him because he does not know what discipline is.

349
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:38,309
He knows worldly discipline enforced through ëthe caneí.

350
00:28:41,238 --> 00:28:45,204
Let the Sahaja Yogi get the discipline from within, let him be awakened from within.

351
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:48,777
Look at its discipline with which you are moving.

352
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,261
You are moving your limbs with its discipline, with its waves.

353
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:56,769
Who has enforced discipline on the oceanís waves?

354
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:03,218
Sitting here you can tell the time of high tide and low tide in London.

355
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:08,015
Who has enforced its discipline?
You are trying to enforce someone elseís!?

356
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,992
Learn to get into its discipline.

357
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:17,761
Learn to grow with its signals and its mechanism.

358
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:21,206
Its machine is working.

359
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:24,675
Donít make any of your own.

360
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:30,958
Just say, ëlet us get into Sahaja Yoga, Let us go, let us invest time in Sahaja Yogaí.

361
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,418
If you wear a watch, it is for Sahaja Yoga.

362
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:37,166
If you put an alarm, it should be for Sahaja Yoga.

363
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:41,634
(marathi)

364
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,936
See this,

365
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:51,396
this age and this is Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,999
(marathi)

367
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,604
Not even a leaf in this world can move without its discipline.

368
00:30:34,771 --> 00:30:38,430
Become one with it; get into its harmony

369
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,817
Get fully harmonised with it;

370
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:47,688
when it rises you rise when it falls you fall.

371
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:51,952
If we make something of our own, we will not be in touch with it.

372
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,404
You mold yourself with that.

373
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:57,489
It can happen only with Sahaja Yoga.

374
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,164
It can not happen with anything else, it canít happen with any earthly thing of the world.

375
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:09,555
There is only one way, I have told you thousands of times, I am telling you again and again;

376
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:17,753
your fortress is ëNirvicharita (thoughtlessness).

377
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:24,323
Find out in Nirvicharita. You will know everything.

378
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:28,126
Whatever you have to do, go into Nirvicharita.

379
00:31:29,658 --> 00:31:32,855
Do all worldly things in Nirvicharita,

380
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:36,428
you will see that it becomes dynamic.

381
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:43,069
Who has seen the blooming of flowers, who has seen fruits growing,

382
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,500
who has seen the execution of all the worldly work? It is happening;

383
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:51,333
you are moving in the same dynamism, in the same living thing.

384
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:56,492
It is coming from Nirvicharita, is nít it?

385
00:31:57,254 --> 00:32:01,166
You sit in that place, from where the whole world blooms.

386
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:07,666
Make a habit of Nirvicharita, try to be always in thoughtlessness.

387
00:32:08,016 --> 00:32:13,015
All the work of this world happens through that and yours also will happen.

388
00:32:13,373 --> 00:32:15,373
All useless things will happen,

389
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:19,333
but you have to operate the inner system yourself.

390
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:24,968
There is no age problem;

391
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,690
no one is old.

392
00:32:26,968 --> 00:32:30,500
You are just born, maybe two or four years.

393
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:34,476
You are all small babies.

394
00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:38,473
There is no issue of age.

395
00:32:43,317 --> 00:32:46,175
You have to be in Nirvicharita.

396
00:32:47,286 --> 00:32:51,507
This is your place,

397
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,119
this is your wealth,

398
00:32:56,794 --> 00:33:00,063
this is your strength, this is your power,

399
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:03,071
this is your form,

400
00:33:08,206 --> 00:33:10,206
this is your beauty,

401
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:12,968
this is your life,

402
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:16,167
Nirvichar.

403
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:24,246
As soon as you become thoughtless, the machine outside

404
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:39,001
starts to fully spin in your hands.

405
00:33:42,248 --> 00:33:44,263
Be in thoughtlessness.

406
00:33:44,698 --> 00:33:46,402
There, there is no time,

407
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:47,984
no direction,

408
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:51,029
nor anyone can touch you.

409
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:57,833
You will get to see the life process, how life blooms.

410
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:01,855
You will see its beauty, its ability.

411
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:05,833
Its opulence, its truth;

412
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:10,789
gaze from the place where the stream of life flows.

413
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,904
But becoming ill-advised,

414
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,159
becoming a fool,

415
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,055
how will it show to you?!

416
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:32,738
Or heart becoming empty,

417
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,428
loveless,

418
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,167
selfish,

419
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,235
self-centered,

420
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:41,206
thinking about oneself,

421
00:34:42,532 --> 00:34:44,532
thinking big of oneself,

422
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:47,484
how can it show you the path?

423
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:50,722
Being ugly,

424
00:34:51,825 --> 00:34:53,499
torturing.

425
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:59,000
How much beauty should be there in the movement and speed of Sahaja Yoga?

426
00:34:59,777 --> 00:35:03,167
When you are doing it, there should be reverence.

427
00:35:03,675 --> 00:35:06,791
When you are raising the Kundalini, there should be spirituality in your hands;

428
00:35:06,992 --> 00:35:12,039
you are worshipping someoneís Kundalini, someoneís mother.

429
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:16,015
How much respect you should have?

430
00:35:16,857 --> 00:35:18,735
How much thought you should give.

431
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:21,370
In everything, in your behaviour,

432
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:23,285
in your language,

433
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,492
in your speech,

434
00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:29,158
in your laughter, in your caress,

435
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:37,253
in your crying, in everything you do, your heart should be seen,

436
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:40,854
vastness should be seen,

437
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,055
the sky should be seen.

438
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:47,396
A glimpse of the purity of water should be seen inside you.

439
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,339
The glow of the sun should be seen on your face,

440
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,968
the coolness of the moon should flow from you.

441
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,333
Like the air, you should be outgoing.

442
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:12,791
Your life is pulsating in the lives of all,

443
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:16,481
realise this and donít play with your life.

444
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:27,527
Be very reverent and devoted and accept it with humility,

445
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:33,230
the new life which is being poured into us by Paramatma.

446
00:36:37,302 --> 00:36:40,373
Accept its love

447
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:43,563
and compassion.

448
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:50,831
Just there is no need for taking a bath, no need for washing hands,

449
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:55,035
nothing is required. Only the cleanliness of the heart is required. Clean your heart.

450
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:59,505
Pray, ëGod clean my heartí. Give up your deceit and guile.

451
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:03,896
Clean your heart. You are to get into the lotus of the heart.

452
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,738
Clean your heart.

453
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:09,341
Is my heart clean?

454
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:14,555
Who are you cheating, who are you telling lies to?

455
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,825
You are all one.

456
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:23,847
I can never say to one person only.

457
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:28,305
I am speaking to each one of you that you are all in one body;

458
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:33,000
and that too in my body. You are my projection.

459
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,310
I am telling myself.

460
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:39,063
o whom else shall I say? Who is the other?

461
00:37:39,348 --> 00:37:44,000
When you are sick, I feel pain within just like I myself have got sick.

462
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:49,680
And when you are happy then I feel tremendous joy just like I have myself become happy.

463
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:53,277
When you are unhappy then I too donít enjoy any joy.

464
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:56,333
I keep awake night and day for you.

465
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,997
Whatever or whichever way you can do,

466
00:38:09,198 --> 00:38:11,520
one must give time,

467
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,920
give full time.

468
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:21,174
Now we are going to make an ashram, so the ones who have money can give money.

469
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:23,926
You will have to give. You spend money here and there.

470
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:26,680
Of what use has it been your spending money here and there.

471
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:28,601
I donít need your money.

472
00:38:28,802 --> 00:38:29,870
I need nothing.

473
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:32,680
I donít need to spend anywhere. This ashram is being made for you,

474
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:36,029
your brothers and sisters, who are going to live there.

475
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,830
Now these realized children are being born,

476
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:41,833
they need a school and someone who can look after them.

477
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:43,746
Give money for that.

478
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:47,228
How will the money come?

479
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:50,667
Any money that comes from you is very important.

480
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:57,585
Such people come here who do not want to spend even one rupee.

481
00:38:57,786 --> 00:39:00,522
There are not such poor people here

482
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,165
 - if that is the case then it is alright.

483
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:09,285
But those who cannot give even one rupee can such people be Sahaja Yogis?

484
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:14,904
I get really amazed that they trouble for giving one rupee or five rupees!

485
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,579
When you have money, you donate, you have to give in thousands,

486
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:24,921
in tens of thousands.

487
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:28,106
Who has given you this money?

488
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:34,224
I donít want it.

489
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:36,865
What need do I have?

490
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:39,420
Please give it to yourself.

491
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:41,355
Give for your well being.

492
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:45,174
You will live in those ashrams with your kith and kin, I know.

493
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,507
You do not have to live on freebies, live like a king.

494
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,601
I donít eat for free, you should also not eat for free.

495
00:39:58,791 --> 00:39:59,892
Whatever you can contribute, contribute.

496
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:03,555
If you have time, spare your time, if you can put in some hard work, do it.

497
00:40:04,698 --> 00:40:08,920
If you can awaken Kundalini, do it if you can give realisation, give it. If you can remove bhoots, remove bhoots.

498
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:10,769
Contribute to Sahaja Yoga.

499
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:15,529
If you donít do it, your ego is not going to die,

500
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,886
your superego is not going to run away.

501
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:20,791
Till you do something for Sahaja Yoga, it will again bother you.

502
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:24,823
Mother my head is caught up, Mother my daughter ran away,

503
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:27,616
Mataji, this happened to my fatherí. It will happen.

504
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:29,500
I donít do anything.

505
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,849
Ganas also donít do anything.

506
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:38,212
The bhoots will catch your weakness. They donít trouble Me.

507
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,667
Do you know why they donít catch Me?

508
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,656
ëWhat has Mataji given me, Mataji has so much to himí.

509
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:51,198
He had to get so much. He got it.

510
00:40:56,068 --> 00:41:00,667
What you got also is not less. You donít value what you got.

511
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,667
You should be satisfied within.

512
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:08,571
Catch hold of satisfaction from inside. Establish yourself on that satisfaction.

513
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:11,944
How should I tell you this,

514
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:14,656
there is a computer for this, it has points.

515
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:17,775
If you press one finger, your satisfaction will be awakened,

516
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,616
if you press one finger your innocence will be awakened,

517
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:23,450
if you press one finger truth will be awakened.

518
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:28,338
This is all inside you, by pressing the fingers like this, the entire program can be set.

519
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:30,865
Shri Mataji keeps doing this.

520
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,134
In the first place, there should be innocence there.

521
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:42,632
There should be some satisfaction there,

522
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,632
otherwise, you press the finger, what will come out from there-vacuum?!

523
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:47,523
There is nothing inside.

524
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:52,000
One who has added satisfaction, he will reach satisfaction.

525
00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:55,111
We are sitting in satisfaction at this time.

526
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:59,418
We have reached righteousness. We are sitting in righteousness at this time.

527
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:02,077
All have accumulated wealth

528
00:42:02,278 --> 00:42:06,031
after burning the body for years and now it is present before you.

529
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:16,293
Like this, you have to keep adding everything,

530
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:23,650
add satisfaction, a lot of it.

531
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:26,880
Satisfaction.

532
00:42:31,056 --> 00:42:32,682
Come into innocence,

533
00:42:33,476 --> 00:42:35,878
come into righteousness. Come into the truth,

534
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,833
come into the beauty,

535
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:39,484
Come into love,

536
00:42:40,214 --> 00:42:42,301
you have a button for everything.

537
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:47,942
How will it happen, how to do it?

538
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:50,156
Sahaja Yoga does nít have to do it. It all happens.

539
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:53,442
There is no such word like ëHow?í in Sahaja Yoga.

540
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:57,355
You can earn whatever you want to be inside you.

541
00:42:57,556 --> 00:42:59,974
If you want satisfaction, you can earn satisfaction.

542
00:43:00,175 --> 00:43:02,299
You can earn everything and keep inside.

543
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,886
Press a button and you will keep getting what you want.

544
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:08,674
A machine will manifest inside you.

545
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,138
I donít know how you will earn these.

546
00:43:28,993 --> 00:43:30,714
You add your earning!

547
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:33,003
You add your earning!

548
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:34,317
Good.

549
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yes.

550
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,496
Let us now go into Meditation.
