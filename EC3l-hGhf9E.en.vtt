00:10:43.363 --> 00:10:46.530
I must have said lots of things about Christ before,

00:10:46.572 --> 00:10:51.863
and how Jesus Christ is related to Shri Radhaji,

00:10:51.905 --> 00:11:01.530
that He is the incarnation of Sri Ganesha who was the son of the Adi Shakti

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.489
to begin with but then he was given to Shri Radhaji

00:11:05.489 --> 00:11:12.030
and Shri Radha created as Mahalaxmi, as Mother Mary

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.280
this great incarnation of Christ.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.572
Now for the western mind it is impossible to understand

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:25.197
how there can be a immaculate conception because they have no sense at all,

00:11:25.238 --> 00:11:28.863
no sensitivity at all to spiritual life.

00:11:28.863 --> 00:11:30.655
We Indians can understand it,

00:11:30.697 --> 00:11:33.739
is very easy for Indians to understand

00:11:33.739 --> 00:11:37.655
because we had Sri Ganesha created that way.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:40.113
We just believe it we don't doubt these things.

00:11:40.155 --> 00:11:42.447
Whatever is said about God is not to be doubted

00:11:42.489 --> 00:11:45.779
with this limited brain, that's not done in India.

00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:50.739
But in the west, from the very birth of Christ

00:11:50.739 --> 00:11:55.363
they have had arguments, arguments, arguments, arguments

00:11:55.363 --> 00:12:01.030
with this limited brain they had, and the whole religion in the name of Christ

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:07.030
is just a perversion, such a horrible things have been said

00:12:07.071 --> 00:12:15.988
that it's unbelievable. His purity, his holiness, his auspiciousness

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.197
is never understood in the west I think.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:26.197
Those who follow Christianity, how can they be so debased

00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:30.863
in their moral character. They're all right for their political,

00:12:30.905 --> 00:12:37.447
their economical you can say, their legal side but their moral sense

00:12:37.489 --> 00:12:40.280
is absolutely missing. Is very surprising,

00:12:40.322 --> 00:12:42.155
those who are the followers of Christ

00:12:42.197 --> 00:12:46.988
should have the greatest amount of morality.

00:12:46.988 --> 00:12:54.946
He has said that thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,

00:12:54.988 --> 00:13:00.197
such a subtle thing, even the eye should not have adultery,

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:08.322
should not have lust and greed. Such a subtle thing he has said it,

00:13:08.322 --> 00:13:14.113
and just think in the west people could not follow it

00:13:14.155 --> 00:13:16.779
because the whole religion got perverted

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:24.572
under the influence of Paul and Peter. It's a very serious thing

00:13:24.614 --> 00:13:27.739
they have done against Christ, it's still going on.

00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:31.905
Still this Catholic church, though being exposed so much,

00:13:31.946 --> 00:13:34.572
is still going on, in India also all over,

00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:38.863
is stupid this Protestant church also is going on everywhere.

00:13:38.863 --> 00:13:43.572
What good name have they brought to Christ? One should see.

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:47.905
The first and foremost thing he has said

00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:55.197
that you must enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:13:55.238 --> 00:13:57.447
that you must be born again.

00:13:57.447 --> 00:14:01.113
So it's all mental, you are born again,

00:14:01.113 --> 00:14:04.614
you have a certificate, you are born again, finished.

00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:10.779
So this mental attitude of the west is responsible

00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:19.238
for killing the great incarnation of Christ,

00:14:19.238 --> 00:14:21.655
I think is another crucifixion.

00:14:21.697 --> 00:14:26.363
Mentally you cannot understand spirituality.

00:14:26.363 --> 00:14:29.739
So they were telling your brain trust, brain trust,

00:14:29.779 --> 00:14:33.572
I said brain trusting-I can't understand in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:44.405
In Sahaja Yoga what is the brain trust? Where is the brain?

00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:51.238
In thoughtless awareness where is the brain?

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.030
So this brain trust business might be all right

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.071
for any other place but for Sahaja Yoga, I still don't understand

00:14:59.071 --> 00:15:02.530
what do you do in brain trust. Because some people

00:15:03.614 --> 00:15:04.863
want to come on the stage and speak you see,

00:15:04.863 --> 00:15:14.155
they have a kind of a madness, they can't get over it.

00:15:14.197 --> 00:15:17.113
So they might be coming to the brain trust maybe,

00:15:17.113 --> 00:15:26.363
but it's not brain, it's the heart, is the heart

00:15:26.405 --> 00:15:32.697
which has to be opened out because with the brain

00:15:32.739 --> 00:15:36.905
what we do is all kinds of materialism.

00:15:36.905 --> 00:15:42.697
All kinds of nonsense has come from human brain only,

00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:47.489
not so much from animals brain. You can see

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:53.322
if you go to any forest it's clean, nice smelling,

00:15:53.363 --> 00:15:56.946
so well but put one human being there and you will know

00:15:56.988 --> 00:16:02.071
that this filth, dirt has come from some human being.

00:16:02.113 --> 00:16:10.905
So as it is they have made a mess of all the great incarnations

00:16:10.946 --> 00:16:17.197
but worst is done to Christ and I feel what a waste it was.

00:16:17.238 --> 00:16:27.447
So we must understand Christ in the right sense, he is the eternal child,

00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:33.030
he is the innocence itself, he's the source of innocence

00:16:33.071 --> 00:16:38.113
and he is the bestower of all blessings in all chakras.

00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:42.572
But that doesn't mean that you are Christians,

00:16:42.614 --> 00:16:47.155
you should be very proud that oh she's talking about Christ,

00:16:47.155 --> 00:16:51.530
many I've seen Sahaja Yogis are still identified with Christ

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.779
while they have nothing to do with Christ at all.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:17:07.238
Now one has to understand that how Christ in his miraculous life

00:17:07.238 --> 00:17:11.697
has shown so many miracles. First of all his birth was immaculate.

00:17:13.988 --> 00:17:16.363
So now they are discussing the birth of Mary

00:17:16.405 --> 00:17:19.614
whether it's immaculate or not. For all incarnations

00:17:19.655 --> 00:17:23.530
every kind of birth is immaculate, they are beyond sins,

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.071
they are special people. They may come as human beings,

00:17:26.071 --> 00:17:28.863
they may come as angels, they may come as anything,

00:17:28.905 --> 00:17:32.739
they are divine and we should understand

00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:36.614
that this little brain of ours cannot discuss about them

00:17:36.614 --> 00:17:43.113
and talk about them but is to just surrender and worship them.

00:17:43.155 --> 00:17:50.489
They are much beyond us. So for the western mind

00:17:50.489 --> 00:17:55.155
it is important to understand that the life of Christ

00:17:55.197 --> 00:18:00.071
was such a blessing for them that they have lost it,

00:18:00.071 --> 00:18:04.071
they have wasted it and they have never understood how to respect it.

00:18:04.113 --> 00:18:14.614
The whole thing became like a political, economical, nonsensical fraud.

00:18:14.655 --> 00:18:24.739
I have told you long time back that how we can prove

00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:29.280
that Christ was Ganesha and he was the logos,

00:18:29.322 --> 00:18:34.030
he was the what we call is the Brahmanat, the first sound.

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:41.489
By looking at your left side from the right side,

00:18:41.489 --> 00:18:47.030
if you see the Mooladhara you will see swastikas

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.030
because it is made of carbon atom.

00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:55.322
If you see from left to the right you can see Omkara

00:18:55.322 --> 00:19:02.405
and if you see from down upward it looks like Alpha and Omega.

00:19:02.447 --> 00:19:07.988
In those days Christ has said I am the Alpha and I am the Omega

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.113
and now we have made the animation,

00:19:10.113 --> 00:19:11.988
we have no arrangement to show you there,

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.197
I don't know if you could arrange it somehow,

00:19:14.197 --> 00:19:18.779
but you can see it clearly, what I have said can be proved.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:25.030
So as you worship Ganesha you must worship Christ

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.071
in the same manner for all those who worship Ganesha.

00:19:29.113 --> 00:19:33.113
Because I have seen that Hindus, they are stuck to Ganesha

00:19:33.155 --> 00:19:42.363
and Christians are stuck to Christ, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:19:42.405 --> 00:19:46.988
they carry those traits. Ganesha is all right up to a point

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:55.530
and then it is important we must pray to his incarnation that is Christ.

00:19:55.572 --> 00:20:02.238
In the same way those who worship Christ must also worship Ganesha

00:20:02.238 --> 00:20:08.530
because he is the source, he is the potential of Christ.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:14.655
All this was in the Divine plan, done with Divine discretion,

00:20:14.697 --> 00:20:18.405
everything was done so beautifully but as I told you

00:20:18.447 --> 00:20:22.447
human beings are good at massacring anything that is beautiful

00:20:22.447 --> 00:20:26.572
and that's how it has happened. It's very, very sad

00:20:26.614 --> 00:20:29.863
and on his birthday today we have to decide

00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:34.739
that he has to be born within us again, in a proper way,

00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:38.614
that he is the Alpha and the Omega.

00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:42.988
At that time of his time I didn't know that anybody knew

00:20:42.988 --> 00:20:47.489
about these symbols. These symbols also must have come

00:20:47.489 --> 00:20:52.322
from unconscious to some of the great mathematicians

00:20:52.322 --> 00:20:55.697
in long time and that's why these symbols

00:20:55.739 --> 00:20:59.779
are used exactly like Alpha and Omega,

00:20:59.821 --> 00:21:06.779
you see him clearly. It is so clear cut now in Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:06.779 --> 00:21:11.155
we can prove so many things all tangible;

00:21:11.197 --> 00:21:14.739
how Christ used to cure people, what did he do,

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:20.363
it's all tangible, we can prove it now in Sahaja Yoga, how it works out,

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:25.489
how these powers work out, but we have to first of all

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.905
cleanse our lives, we have to lead a very honest,

00:21:30.905 --> 00:21:37.780
powerful and pure life. I've seen those stalls outside,

00:21:37.821 --> 00:21:42.363
I told them not to put up any stalls here

00:21:42.363 --> 00:21:46.280
because they are making profit for themselves not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:46.322 --> 00:21:51.779
Once Christ saw like that and he took a hunter and hit all of them,

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:56.363
now I can't do that. One should not encourage these people,

00:21:56.363 --> 00:22:02.113
it's not a shopping centre, you have come for meditation.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:07.030
Is all right if you need anything we have bought things for you,

00:22:07.071 --> 00:22:10.238
if you buy them, there might be little profit, may not be,

00:22:10.238 --> 00:22:14.280
but that will go to Sahaja Yoga, is not going to be used

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.863
for any private purpose. But these people from outside come

00:22:18.863 --> 00:22:22.197
and put up a stall and you all run about means

00:22:22.238 --> 00:22:24.113
you are still hanging around with that thing,

00:22:24.155 --> 00:22:27.280
you have come here for what?

00:22:27.322 --> 00:22:35.447
One should be all the time meditative in Ganapatipule,

00:22:35.489 --> 00:22:39.779
all the time you should be in a meditative condition

00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:43.238
and shouldn't get to these mundane things

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.905
which you always do outside also. But these people know

00:22:48.946 --> 00:22:52.697
that you still have those weaknesses, that's why they have put up the stalls.

00:22:52.739 --> 00:23:02.197
Leaders should stop all this nonsense, I've told not to eat outside.

00:23:02.197 --> 00:23:05.280
Last time all of you suffered because of that

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.405
but still the stalls are on, that means see they know

00:23:08.447 --> 00:23:12.779
there are some culprits who would like to buy things from them

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.071
and get sick and bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:20.780
So the first thing of Ganesha is that wisdom,

00:23:20.821 --> 00:23:28.614
and that wisdom we see in the life of Christ,

00:23:28.655 --> 00:23:33.322
from the very beginning, he was so confident of it

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:40.714
that at the age of twelve years he went and talked to these parses,

00:23:40.739 --> 00:23:44.447
means the people who were priests, we still have priests

00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:47.697
and mullahs and these burgees and all of them,

00:23:47.739 --> 00:23:52.155
these so called dharmamantandas, all over,

00:23:52.155 --> 00:23:57.363
but he went and argued with them at that young age

00:23:57.405 --> 00:24:00.405
and he was just saying what are you doing here.

00:24:00.447 --> 00:24:09.739
What is this? What are you talking, all lip service.

00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:13.614
He was discussing and talking to them

00:24:13.655 --> 00:24:18.779
but his parents were perhaps, were frightened that these people

00:24:18.779 --> 00:24:21.238
might kill him so they brought him to India,

00:24:21.238 --> 00:24:23.363
he came to India for wisdom.

00:24:23.405 --> 00:24:26.988
I don't know where is that wisdom missing now from Indians,

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.988
but must be this country was full of wisdom when he came

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:38.779
and stayed in India and we have lots of memories

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:44.447
about him, even the King Shaliman met him, is described in his book

00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:49.113
that he met a man in Cashmere who was very saintly

00:24:49.113 --> 00:24:51.780
and he asked him what's your name?

00:24:51.821 --> 00:24:58.779
He said my name is Isa, see now imagine-Isa.

00:24:58.779 --> 00:25:03.447
I is the word used in the Vedas for the Adi Shakti-

00:25:03.489 --> 00:25:11.489
Sa means with.He said my name is Isa, he said from what country do you come.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.905
He said I come from a country which is foreign to me

00:25:15.946 --> 00:25:21.697
and this is my country. So this India, the Bharat,

00:25:21.697 --> 00:25:29.572
the Hindustan was the country of spirituality, and one should not try to compete

00:25:29.614 --> 00:25:35.155
and feel inferior to other countries who have gone up materially higher,

00:25:35.197 --> 00:25:36.863
you don't know where they are,

00:25:36.905 --> 00:25:42.405
but we should be spiritually higher,

00:25:42.405 --> 00:25:49.071
that's what Christ said. This is my own country, is clearly written,

00:25:49.113 --> 00:25:50.905
that means Christ recognised

00:25:50.946 --> 00:25:55.238
that this country of spirituality is his own.

00:25:55.238 --> 00:26:00.863
So we belong to that country of spirituality

00:26:00.905 --> 00:26:07.655
and not to the materialistic or to the mundane or the baser type of life.

00:26:07.655 --> 00:26:21.821
In his life time which was so very short, whatever he has said,

00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:26.238
every word is great but as I told you

00:26:26.238 --> 00:26:33.988
that this Paul tried to completely change, re-edit the bible

00:26:33.988 --> 00:26:39.071
and he's put lots of things in there, whatever weaknesses he has,

00:26:39.113 --> 00:26:43.363
he has put them nicely.  Now recently I've got a book

00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:49.280
which was hidden in a jar in Egypt

00:26:49.322 --> 00:26:55.614
for about, till fifty years they discovered it, and this book is called

00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:59.071
as the Library of Hamadhi. The place was called Hamadhi

00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:02.655
were it was discovered, and what Christ has said,

00:27:02.697 --> 00:27:08.447
what Thomas has written, when Thomas was coming to India he put all these things there, is very interesting.

00:27:08.489 --> 00:27:13.779
About drinking, he said drinking begets debauchery,

00:27:13.779 --> 00:27:17.779
it's a bad word to use and while Christians don't know.

00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:24.405
On the contrary they think that drinking is allowed in Christianity,

00:27:24.447 --> 00:27:27.821
very nicely. Was he mad to allow drinking?

00:27:27.821 --> 00:27:34.197
How can he allow drinking

00:27:34.197 --> 00:27:36.779
which goes against your awareness,

00:27:36.779 --> 00:27:39.071
but they thought it was nice,

00:27:39.071 --> 00:27:45.863
and that's what people have been using as a big attraction

00:27:45.905 --> 00:27:48.405
that you can drink in Christianity.

00:27:48.447 --> 00:27:56.779
So in the other religion, like Catholic religion, you could have only once the Marriage.

00:27:56.779 --> 00:28:02.863
So they have one marriage and ten keeps, is all right,

00:28:02.863 --> 00:28:05.155
allowed, in the bible is written,

00:28:05.197 --> 00:28:08.238
only you can have one marriage you cannot divorce,

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.739
do what you like. No sense of morality

00:28:11.779 --> 00:28:18.697
and everything came like a derailment towards themselves

00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:22.697
and they accepted one after another, all kinds of nonsense,

00:28:22.697 --> 00:28:28.697
and the basic thing of Christ's life is morality.

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:33.946
He is on the left side as you can see he's from Sri Ganesh

00:28:33.988 --> 00:28:37.113
and then he establishes himself at Agnya,

00:28:37.113 --> 00:28:42.489
but morality is the essence of his life,

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:48.530
what we call in India language his character.

00:28:48.572 --> 00:28:57.280
Our character is how we lead a life of purity.

00:28:57.322 --> 00:29:02.197
We indulge into all kinds of nonsense,

00:29:02.238 --> 00:29:06.238
I mean if you go to the west you'll be amazed what things they do.

00:29:06.238 --> 00:29:11.821
I mean you cannot even believe it

00:29:11.863 --> 00:29:15.405
and I cannot even mention it to you, you won't believe

00:29:15.405 --> 00:29:17.863
that these so called advanced countries

00:29:17.905 --> 00:29:19.905
are advancing towards what.

00:29:19.946 --> 00:29:28.030
Impossible we cannot conceive it even, such an impurity,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:39.155
such a horrible, destructive immorality,

00:29:39.197 --> 00:29:41.489
and I don't know from where it comes,

00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:43.655
I think it's something wrong with the genetics,

00:29:43.697 --> 00:29:48.030
from where do they get these ideas. One after another

00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:54.988
it's impossible to believe these people doing all these things

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.655
and then nicely dress up and go to church on Sunday,

00:29:58.697 --> 00:30:05.489
pray to God and come back. Now it is for you to decide,

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.280
you have to pull out all these people in your own countries

00:30:09.322 --> 00:30:15.363
and you have to tell them this is all nonsense in the name of Christ,

00:30:15.363 --> 00:30:22.863
in the name of God, you have to come up and talk about it,

00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:27.489
same about Sri Ganesh. I have seen in Poona, I was surprised,

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:32.614
there was Ganesh ........... everybody was drinking nicely,

00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:37.155
the horrible dirty songs, some western songs,

00:30:37.197 --> 00:30:40.779
some horrible cinema songs put up there

00:30:40.779 --> 00:30:45.988
and everybody was using as a disco in front of Sri Ganesh.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:51.030
Sahaja Yogis should go and object to this kind of a nonsense

00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:54.739
they are in that how could they drink in the presence of Sri Ganesh.

00:30:54.739 --> 00:31:05.905
No wisdom of Sri Ganesha, no respect for his auspiciousness.

00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:10.197
Now not only drinking, doing all kinds of things.

00:31:10.238 --> 00:31:14.614
Sri Ganesha has been shown by these tantrikas

00:31:14.655 --> 00:31:18.821
as something so horrible which is also done

00:31:18.863 --> 00:31:23.614
by so many psychologists, so called, in the west.

00:31:23.655 --> 00:31:28.030
Thank God one of them is Mr. Freud is exposed now.

00:31:28.071 --> 00:31:35.071
So the another quality of Ganesha, is shown in Christ's life,

00:31:35.113 --> 00:31:42.739
is a devotion to Mother. In that book the,

00:31:42.739 --> 00:31:49.572
Mary is telling them about knowledge,

00:31:49.572 --> 00:31:54.655
but this Paul objects to it,

00:31:54.655 --> 00:32:00.946
and she says that this is what you have to achieve.

00:32:00.988 --> 00:32:04.489
But he doesn't want to, he is arguing with her,

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:13.405
but then Thomas said that what Christ has said on the Cross

00:32:13.447 --> 00:32:20.363
"behold the Mother". She is the Mother of Christ

00:32:20.363 --> 00:32:26.238
and how dare he insult her but just the opposite,

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:33.489
Paul never respected women, so he appointed,

00:32:33.489 --> 00:32:38.697
I mean he called her as just a woman.

00:32:38.697 --> 00:32:43.197
No respect for Mahalaxmi, no respect.

00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:49.614
Can you imagine, just a woman,

00:32:49.655 --> 00:32:51.821
and a big controversy going on

00:32:51.863 --> 00:32:56.405
on these so called advanced people whether the women

00:32:56.447 --> 00:32:59.614
should be ordained as priests or not.

00:32:59.614 --> 00:33:01.946
We think we are very backward

00:33:01.988 --> 00:33:06.322
but I think they are so backward in religion, nonsense.

00:33:06.363 --> 00:33:09.489
We had.............

00:33:09.489 --> 00:33:12.697
such people here and we respect the Mother

00:33:12.739 --> 00:33:20.113
as the Adi Shakti, she is the one we call her, the one who has created us,

00:33:20.155 --> 00:33:22.071
she is the one who looks after us,

00:33:22.113 --> 00:33:25.530
for us she is important, Shakti is important,

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:31.363
they don't call her Shakti but a woman,

00:33:31.405 --> 00:33:36.863
and supposed to be very advanced people,

00:33:36.905 --> 00:33:43.155
and all other nonsense they do in the name of advancement.

00:33:43.155 --> 00:33:52.030
It's impossible to tell, my words fall short, feel so ashamed

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.863
in the name of Christ.

00:33:55.905 --> 00:34:02.905
Today now when we are celebrating the pure life of Christ,

00:34:02.946 --> 00:34:07.197
he came on this earth. They can't believe

00:34:07.238 --> 00:34:11.821
that he could have been so pure. A criminal cannot believe

00:34:11.863 --> 00:34:14.655
that others could be non criminal.

00:34:14.697 --> 00:34:24.071
So we have to within ourselves see if we have developed

00:34:24.071 --> 00:34:30.489
that purity of mind that expresses through our eyes.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:36.155
Eyes have to become innocent, otherwise they have no effect.

00:34:36.197 --> 00:34:43.405
If you are hankering after attracting other people

00:34:43.447 --> 00:34:46.155
and charming other people and all that,

00:34:46.155 --> 00:34:49.530
you are not a Sahaja Yogi, there's no need.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.946
Once the light is within yourself, people will know.

00:34:52.988 --> 00:34:59.113
As Sahaja Yogis you have to have

00:34:59.155 --> 00:35:03.821
the light of Christ in your own life.

00:35:03.821 --> 00:35:10.447
He was a young man who came on this earth, and how he lived.

00:35:10.489 --> 00:35:16.821
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalen, who was a prostitute,

00:35:16.821 --> 00:35:22.155
but he stood by truth, and when people started stoning her

00:35:22.155 --> 00:35:26.821
he stood up and said those who are not committed any sin

00:35:26.863 --> 00:35:33.280
can throw the stone at me. What a strength of truth.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:40.863
So not that only he was a pure personality but purity also

00:35:41.447 --> 00:35:45.655
is expressed in truth and his compassion and love.

00:35:45.697 --> 00:35:51.322
Such compassion he has expressed, such compassion.

00:35:51.363 --> 00:35:55.697
I think Sri Ganesha got a little transformation.

00:35:55.697 --> 00:36:00.779
Sri Ganesha is definitely very compassionate to people

00:36:00.779 --> 00:36:07.572
who are worshipping him but those who go against them

00:36:07.614 --> 00:36:13.447
he hits them hard.............they have to suffer,

00:36:13.489 --> 00:36:17.655
aids, this, that, everything comes.

00:36:17.655 --> 00:36:25.113
But those who are pure people, Sri Ganesha protects.

00:36:25.113 --> 00:36:28.113
But Christ is compassionate, he forgives

00:36:28.113 --> 00:36:32.280
because he believes that there could be a transformation.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:39.238
At the level of Sri Ganesha he thinks is better

00:36:39.238 --> 00:36:43.030
that let them be killed and be born again

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:47.280
because they're so impure but Christ had hopes

00:36:47.322 --> 00:36:49.447
that he can transform people,

00:36:49.447 --> 00:36:54.197
but he could not, they crucified him.

00:36:54.238 --> 00:36:59.614
What wonderful people they must have been to crucify Christ.

00:36:59.614 --> 00:37:05.030
Brainless we should call them, absolutely

00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:09.988
without any understanding about spirituality,

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:15.779
very insensitive to true knowledge.

00:37:15.779 --> 00:37:24.238
So for Sahaja Yoga, only the wise can follow.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:30.988
It is not meant for stupid idiotic people nor it is meant for very smart ones.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:37.363
Some people think they are very smart because they are successful in life,

00:37:37.405 --> 00:37:41.572
they can say some smart sentences, they can say something very,

00:37:41.614 --> 00:37:47.489
outstandingly very sharp, it's not meant for that.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:53.863
For that Christ has said meek in heart will inherit the earth.

00:37:53.863 --> 00:38:00.697
Meek in heart, not those who think too much of themselves

00:38:00.697 --> 00:38:06.614
but for meek in heart will inherit the earth.

00:38:06.614 --> 00:38:09.572
Among Sahaja Yogis also only those who are meek in heart

00:38:09.614 --> 00:38:16.489
will inherit the blessing of Mother. You have to be meek,

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:22.238
you have to be wise and with wisdom you'll become meek

00:38:22.238 --> 00:38:23.946
because then you will see

00:38:23.946 --> 00:38:27.280
where are we into this great cosmos,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:34.155
that, you will feel that you have entered into this Kingdom of God,

00:38:34.197 --> 00:38:39.779
for what? How? How have we come here?

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.530
How have you entered here? So many tried,

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:49.280
thousands of years sacrificing this sacrificing that,

00:38:49.322 --> 00:38:52.447
standing on their heads, fasting,

00:38:52.447 --> 00:38:55.447
how is it suddenly we got this blessing?

00:38:55.447 --> 00:38:57.697
How are we there?

00:38:57.739 --> 00:39:03.238
When we start looking at this we become meek.

00:39:03.238 --> 00:39:06.739
Is the blessing, is the grace.

00:39:06.739 --> 00:39:09.238
It's not through our ego,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.614
through our conditionings but is just the grace,

00:39:12.655 --> 00:39:16.946
the compassion, the love the Sandrakaruna,

00:39:16.946 --> 00:39:25.071
and then you enjoy your transformed life,

00:39:25.113 --> 00:39:33.238
the new dimension of spirituality which is in reality.

00:39:33.238 --> 00:39:36.779
Now you know reality, you know totality, you know everything

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:40.280
but those who have not known themselves

00:39:40.322 --> 00:39:42.821
have not become Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:42.863 --> 00:39:49.614
Tukarama has said in very simple words .............

00:39:49.655 --> 00:39:55.530
the one who has known himself is the last one.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.863
You can judge the chakras of others

00:39:59.905 --> 00:40:01.988
but you can't judge your own chakras,

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.322
you can introspect others,

00:40:04.322 --> 00:40:06.405
you can judge others but you cannot judge yourself.

00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:09.405
You know everything about others but about yourself

00:40:09.405 --> 00:40:14.739
you don't know anything, then you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:14.739 --> 00:40:16.572
First thing you must know yourself.

00:40:16.572 --> 00:40:19.655
What sort of an ego stuff I am doing.

00:40:19.655 --> 00:40:22.071
What sort of a conditioning I have got.

00:40:22.071 --> 00:40:25.739
Even now people have so many conditionings.

00:40:25.779 --> 00:40:29.071
So there's a new discipline of Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:29.113 --> 00:40:37.697
in the new discipline you have to be meek, humble and you have to be wise.

00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:41.821
Every step of yours, every talk of yours,

00:40:41.863 --> 00:40:46.197
everything should express wisdom

00:40:46.238 --> 00:40:50.113
and the Sahaj discipline which automatically stops you

00:40:50.155 --> 00:40:51.821
from doing wrong things.

00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:54.530
Now say I'm walking down and some lady suddenly

00:40:54.572 --> 00:40:58.821
falls at my feet without even understanding that I am just walking,

00:40:58.821 --> 00:41:03.405
I may fall down or catches hold of my feet,

00:41:03.447 --> 00:41:07.530
is all self oriented.

00:41:07.572 --> 00:41:11.988
I should see Mother, I should go and meet her,

00:41:11.988 --> 00:41:15.655
I touched her feet, is all ego.

00:41:15.697 --> 00:41:20.863
A Sahaja Yogi stands in the back,

00:41:20.905 --> 00:41:29.655
real Sahaja Yogi is at the back from there he can enjoy because he knows I am everywhere.

00:41:29.697 --> 00:41:37.905
He doesn't want to see me, nothing, just like this, standing.

00:41:37.946 --> 00:41:42.655
He doesn't force his way in any way.

00:41:42.697 --> 00:41:46.821
Mother is here.

00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:52.946
But this is what it is Christ has said, meek in heart.

00:41:52.988 --> 00:41:56.905
There's a very big word "meek" and people don't understand meek

00:41:56.905 --> 00:42:00.113
because in the west if you are meek people say you are weak,

00:42:00.113 --> 00:42:02.739
you have to be aggressive. If they have to praise somebody

00:42:02.779 --> 00:42:05.405
they'll say, oh he is very good, he is very aggressive.

00:42:05.447 --> 00:42:09.697
I think their genetics are little lower than normal,

00:42:09.697 --> 00:42:15.238
must be some animals in them otherwise how can they think

00:42:15.238 --> 00:42:20.030
that to be aggressive is being something higher.

00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:28.322
It's impossible, how can a person who is supposed

00:42:28.363 --> 00:42:31.780
to be a higher person, could be like a devil.

00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:36.905
How could Hitler say that he was a higher race

00:42:36.946 --> 00:42:40.238
when he was himself a devil?

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.614
Is very nice for a devil to say I am a higher race.

00:42:44.614 --> 00:42:53.197
So in dealing in Sahaja Yoga, the sweetness of natural meekness

00:42:53.238 --> 00:42:57.780
not artificial of a businessman but a natural one

00:42:57.821 --> 00:43:08.572
that makes you shine with your great, great spirituality.

00:43:08.614 --> 00:43:12.946
Nobody can touch you, I have told you, except for you.

00:43:12.988 --> 00:43:18.405
You can only fall down but nobody can touch you,

00:43:18.447 --> 00:43:21.447
you are all protected from every angle

00:43:21.489 --> 00:43:25.197
but if you want to hit yourself I can't help it.

00:43:25.197 --> 00:43:28.071
So again we come to Tukarama saying,

00:43:28.113 --> 00:43:34.030
as Christ has said "know thyself ".

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:39.821
First and foremost thing of introspectionis know thyself.

00:43:39.863 --> 00:43:45.988
What you are doing,

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:50.030
are you trying to look at yourself or not?

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:58.447
He has also said that we see a big beam into the eyes of others,

00:43:58.489 --> 00:44:05.572
then it's all right, but the beam is in your eyes

00:44:05.614 --> 00:44:08.739
and you start seeing the beam in others eyes and that's.

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:15.905
So in your meditation you have to sit down

00:44:15.946 --> 00:44:19.197
and first of all introspect-Oh Christ,

00:44:19.197 --> 00:44:23.739
Oh Sri Ganesha please give me wisdom to see myself

00:44:23.779 --> 00:44:30.655
and understand what's wrong with me and understand

00:44:30.697 --> 00:44:38.197
where do I lack all the qualities of a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:44:38.238 --> 00:44:45.779
Just to meditate and you feel so happy, so joyous,

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:50.779
because virtue within you gives you joy.

00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:53.030
But you don't say I'm virtuous,

00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:56.280
you don't say that, but the virtue within you

00:44:56.322 --> 00:44:59.155
when you discover, that gives you joy

00:44:59.155 --> 00:45:06.113
and not your bad qualities and your hankerings,

00:45:06.155 --> 00:45:09.779
your lust and greed, no it does not.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:17.447
So we must really concentrate, even coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:45:17.489 --> 00:45:22.572
people think how I can use it for say fame,

00:45:22.572 --> 00:45:28.447
leadership you see is another myth. Then they sometimes think

00:45:28.489 --> 00:45:32.322
why not use it for making some money some how.

00:45:32.322 --> 00:45:35.863
Some sort of a business they start.

00:45:35.863 --> 00:45:41.071
Don't do any business with Sahaja Yoga or Sahaja Yogis,

00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:44.113
I've told a hundred times, if you do it you'll be in trouble

00:45:44.155 --> 00:45:46.655
and then don't come and tell me the trouble.

00:45:46.655 --> 00:45:52.946
Sahaja Yoga is only Gods business, that's all.

00:45:52.946 --> 00:46:03.197
Everything that you are doing is for God and that's why

00:46:03.197 --> 00:46:05.363
you are doing it for your self.

00:46:05.363 --> 00:46:08.905
So introspection is very important,

00:46:08.905 --> 00:46:14.071
criticising others should be less and criticising yourself

00:46:14.113 --> 00:46:16.280
and laughing at yourself is the best.

00:46:16.322 --> 00:46:17.655
I laugh at myself many a times

00:46:17.697 --> 00:46:21.197
and say many things like that, if you have noticed,

00:46:21.238 --> 00:46:29.863
that makes life so interesting. That will kill your ego.

00:46:29.905 --> 00:46:36.071
How I am trying to assert myself and where is the meekness

00:46:36.071 --> 00:46:42.363
that Christ has talked about. It is a natural goodness within us.

00:46:42.405 --> 00:46:50.447
Once it shines and shows, you become so beautiful, so loveable.

00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:53.113
Whether you are sitting here near me or there

00:46:53.155 --> 00:46:56.113
I know who is that kind.

00:46:56.155 --> 00:47:01.779
My heart just opens for such a personality.

00:47:01.779 --> 00:47:13.113
I know who they are. But even if I know I will never tell you,

00:47:13.155 --> 00:47:16.946
it is better that you know yourself.

00:47:16.988 --> 00:47:22.238
"Know thyself" is his message,

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.280
in the real way not with deception because you are deceiving yourself,

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:34.030
whom are you deceiving, know thyself without any deception,

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:43.322
without any lies, with full concentration,

00:47:43.322 --> 00:47:50.572
see where is your attention going, that's how you are going to rise,

00:47:50.614 --> 00:47:54.238
you are not going to rise by seeing the defects of others

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:59.363
but you are going to rise only by seeing your own defects.

00:47:59.363 --> 00:48:02.280
Exactly this what Christ has said,

00:48:02.322 --> 00:48:06.322
I am telling you in very, very simple words.

00:48:06.322 --> 00:48:12.322
Then he has said love thy neighbour as thyself which is a very,

00:48:12.363 --> 00:48:16.779
very big thing to say. Now is only possible in Sahaja Yoga

00:48:16.779 --> 00:48:21.905
because you are collective, those who are not collective

00:48:21.946 --> 00:48:25.697
how can they love their neighbour. I mean who is the neighbour then,

00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:27.988
nobody's the neighbour, they're outsiders,

00:48:27.988 --> 00:48:31.489
but as soon as you become collective,

00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:35.739
see today there are fifty five nations, you are all so collective,

00:48:35.739 --> 00:48:39.405
so moral, so beautiful, no complications, nothing,

00:48:39.447 --> 00:48:41.779
I am so overjoyed to see that

00:48:41.779 --> 00:48:45.405
but to make it perfect we should introspect.

00:48:45.405 --> 00:48:50.779
Socially, collectively you people have improved a lot

00:48:50.779 --> 00:48:53.779
but also individually within yourself

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.946
you have to improve for your own goodness.

00:48:56.988 --> 00:49:03.405
So on this great occasion, we have to celebrate

00:49:03.405 --> 00:49:09.030
because really such a great amount of work was done by Christ

00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:11.988
though neutralised by these horrible priests,

00:49:11.988 --> 00:49:15.238
which is done in every country, in every religion

00:49:15.238 --> 00:49:19.280
but now we should take a vow to save others

00:49:19.322 --> 00:49:24.113
who are taking the name of Christ and doing something

00:49:24.155 --> 00:49:29.530
just the opposite. If it could be done, if it could be achieved

00:49:29.572 --> 00:49:33.697
through your lives Christ's work has been done.

00:49:33.697 --> 00:49:41.113
You have to now express Christ through your life, this is what it is.

00:49:41.155 --> 00:49:46.697
Through your life you can express it, through the purity,

00:49:46.739 --> 00:49:50.572
through the meekness, through the compassion

00:49:50.572 --> 00:49:59.280
and the wisdom of Christ. Absolutely fearless was he

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.197
and that's why you have to be fearless

00:50:02.197 --> 00:50:07.946
because you have to be only afraid of God and nobody else,

00:50:07.946 --> 00:50:11.655
that's all and if you have done nothing wrong

00:50:11.697 --> 00:50:15.280
then there's nothing to be afraid of God also because he loves you very much.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:25.280
So be clear cut about everything, be understanding,

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:32.447
you are all loveable people no doubt but you should be such

00:50:32.447 --> 00:50:36.028
that you can adore yourself and love yourself

00:50:36.053 --> 00:50:38.370
because of the virtues you have.

00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:42.802
May God Bless you all.
