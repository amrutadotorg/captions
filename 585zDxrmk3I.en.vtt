00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Today's Puja is a very great Puja for Me,

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:12.083
because I suddenly find that My granddaughter is missing,

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:16.125
and I got upset with it very much.

00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:22.250
Look at Me, supposed to be Adi Shakti,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.125
and why should I get so upset
about My granddaughter missing?

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:34.500
It was just a human nature,

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.667
which I realized all of us have.

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:48.250
If we have some responsibility

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:55.458
and we are not there, we get upset.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.625
Thank God there are very few children here,

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.458
most of them have gone.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.959
But we are all children

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:15.500
the way we worry, the way we are anxious.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:22.125
Today I would like all of you to say

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.542
that a New Year has come.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:34.458
And in this New Year we all should have

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.333
a new proposal about ourselves.

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:44.667
And that proposal is very difficult for people to make out

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:49.375
- that we are not responsible for anyone.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.917
We are our own, and we live with ourselves.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.417
It's very difficult.

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:03.083
Of course those who have no children

00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.000
are very happy people that way.

00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:09.083
But those who have,

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:13.709
those who have certain responsibilities

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.208
and commitments they are still hanging in the air.

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:27.041
They are nowhere near Sahaja Yoga, I must say.

00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:33.542
Our main responsibility is ourselves,

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:39.291
is to know ourselves

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:42.166
and to depend on ourselves.

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:46.667
It is a very big responsibility,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.250
because now as we will be having big functions

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.917
and we might feel that we are lost in it.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.458
Please, try to remember

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:06.500
that  you have to remember your Self.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.667
You have to know that you are there.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.208
That's the message I wanted to give you.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.417
I hope you'll think it over.

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:22.041
May God bless you all!
