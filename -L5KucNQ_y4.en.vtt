00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:14.749
It was very nice to come to Reading again,
and to meet very nice people like your Mayor

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:22.300
and another nice person who was interviewing
me at the radio station.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:33.879
I am discovering new talents in this place
which is really historically very important.

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.660
But in the history of spirituality, England
as a whole has to play a very, very important

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.650
role, which perhaps English people don’t
realise.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.890
William Blake has said that, that England
has to become Jerusalem.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.850
It has to become a Holy land and you all have
to become holy people.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.890
He is not a liar, he wouldn’t tell you a
lie.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.299
People can say that he was a visionary and
he visualised things beyond his foresight.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:18.380
That’s not a fact, because about Sahaja
Yoga he has written very vividly, clearly,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.920
as to where I’ll be staying since my arrival
in England, where our ashram is going to be.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.920
It is so beautifully done that I feel this
land has something special about it to produce,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.979
or to create, such great poets, such great
seers.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.159
India of course is a country of yoga, no doubt.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:55.720
But there also we had a great poet, about
the same time as Blake, maybe a little earlier,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.720
Gyaneshwara.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.750
He did write about Kundalini.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.439
He also described the times of Sahaja Yoga
by saying that: at that time, the people who

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:15.069
are in darkness, the people who are blind,
will see light.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:23.200
He’s also gone further to say that: those
people who will receive light, will be able

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.200
to enlighten other people.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.430
But William Blake has very clearly said that
men of God will become prophets, and these

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.099
prophets will have powers to make others prophets.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:50.370
And this is the test that you should put to
everything: “Have I become a prophet?”

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.830
I mean, it’s all right there are many people
who are around, who are selling their things.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.380
I don’t know what they are doing to attract
more people.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:09.700
Like the mayor asked me that, “As your work
is so fantastic, you must have been receiving

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.830
thousands of people!”

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.069
I said, “No I don’t.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.670
Sometimes I receive five or sometimes ten!”

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.200
He was amazed!

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.460
He said, “How can that be?”

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.960
I said, “It’s true!

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.010
I receive very few people to come to my programme.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.379
And if they come and stick on for a while,
they get Realisation all right.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.840
But there are very few who come.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.409
He was quite amazed.

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.409
He said, “Really?

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:39.209
But I am surprised, you don’t charge any
money, there’s no membership.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.610
I mean it really shows that it is something
Divine.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.010
And still, how is it few people come to you?”

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.250
I said, “I will ask the same question to
you, because I don’t understand human beings!

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.680
You better answer me that why so few people
come and take advantage of this Sahaja Yoga

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.970
which gives you the power that is lying within
you, which gives you what you have already

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.330
existing within you, which is your own, it’s
your own property.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.810
Still they don’t come, even if you tell
them [that] freely you are going to be given

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.609
all your bank balances, please come, please
come, but they don’t come."

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.930
So I said, “Instead of asking me this question,
for the first time, let me ask you this question.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.710
I can’t understand."

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.590
But in Indian villages it’s a different
thing: where the people come in thousands.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.900
One of the reasons may be that the people
do not know much about Kundalini, they are

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.259
naïve about that.

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:45.689
And they do not know what it means by the
word ‘Self-Realisation’: what it means,

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:48.410
what is a Self, and what should happen to
us.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.830
Perhaps that may be the reason: a sort of
ignorance about it.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.490
But despite all that, this word ‘Self-Realisation’
has been used since long by many marketeers,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.909
and nobody has been able to give it.

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:10.199
Now if somebody says, “Yes it can happen
to you, just it can happen."

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.669
I think there should be real interest.

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:22.229
But still I cannot explain why is it that
few people come, and those who come also do

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.810
not stick on, they have no patience.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.879
“But with other gurus?”

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.430
He asked me.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.460
I said, “No, there are many [that] go: thousands
and thousands."

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.249
There’s one fellow whom the British people
have given 58 Rolls Royces, and then they

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.449
gave him a 59th one because he would not come
without getting a Rolls Royce from them.

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.389
So they starved themselves for one year, and
gave him the 59th Rolls Royce!

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.490
And how many people must have done it?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:59.389
Fifty-thousand people collected that money
to give it to this fellow to come down here!

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.479
Already now that he has 59th, I think he must
be waiting for the 60th.

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:08.740
And I wouldn’t be surprised that they will
be again collecting money for him.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.599
One must understand that you cannot pay for
God.

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.840
You cannot buy God by giving him a Rolls Royce.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.420
He doesn’t understand this Rolls Royce,
He doesn’t understand money, He doesn’t

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.420
understand bank.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.420
He doesn’t know the mint.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.879
He doesn’t know that you are having a new
system, of this paper money.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.159
He’s not aware of these things.

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:39.149
But somehow we are so much used to these mundane
things, regular things, that we personally,

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:44.999
all of us, feel that if it is going to be
God, He has to be just like us: there should

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:49.340
be an organisation, there should be a chairman,
there should be a vice-chairman, there has

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.449
to be a secretary, and all this organisation
must be there.

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:57.680
And there only if we go, then it’s all right,
then we are safe, we are secure, because we

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.619
are used to it.

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:08.520
But God’s laws and God’s domain is very
different from what we understand.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.520
We have never felt his love.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.539
We have been always working, with all our
organised things because we were insecure

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:16.599
about something.

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:20.400
Every institution is for some kind of an insecurity.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.839
Because we are insecure, we think something
is going to fall upon us, something horrible

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:30.979
is going to happen, that’s how we form a
thing.

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:36.939
Otherwise our children may be spoiled or our
old people may die, or something may happen,

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:38.539
we form an organisation.

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:41.709
This is not believing in God.

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:46.430
Secondly we form, also, organisations because
we hate.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:53.889
But we have never seen the Power of Love,
which is the most beautiful, blissful and

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:59.169
smoothly working: like a flower becoming a
fruit.

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:01.619
Have you ever seen a flower becoming a fruit?

00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:03.020
Nobody has seen it.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.429
How slowly it becomes!

00:08:06.429 --> 00:08:09.889
Have you ever seen a bud opening into a flower?

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:15.080
You have to put a slow motion camera to catch
that slow movement.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:21.619
All that is done by this great Power of God,
this Divine Power which is called as ‘Brahma’

00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:23.639
in Sanskrit language.

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:29.739
And to know that Brahma is the idea behind
Self-Realisation.

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:36.469
It is all-pervading, It is working everywhere,
but we cannot feel It and we have to feel

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:37.469
That.

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:39.229
And how to feel it?

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:40.959
How to know that?

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:47.129
The only way is to get yourself connected
with your Self which connects you to that

00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:50.000
All-pervading Power, and it starts flowing
through you.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.130
If you learn the ways and methods you can
manoeuvre it, you can use it and you can give

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.339
it to others also.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:03.410
It’s a very simple thing like putting a
connection.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:09.070
Like you come in the room: if you have to
put on the lights, you just have to switch

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.430
on, it’s like that.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.450
It’s very simple.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:17.170
But when you switch on the light, you must
know that there’s a very huge organisation

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:20.670
behind this little switch.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.970
In the same way, behind all this there’s
a very great organisation of God Almighty,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:29.779
which we have not known: we have just heard
about God, “There is God, and let’s pray

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:30.970
to God,” All that.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.180
But where is He?

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180
What is He?

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.620
And what are we?

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.889
We have never known that.

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:42.399
So first time you get connected with His Power.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:49.180
Now about Spirit: I mean, in English language
‘spirit’ is used for so many things!

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.320
They will use it for a dead body – it’s
a spirit.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.029
They’ll use it for also spirits: alcohols.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:56.190
‘Spirit’ for Atma.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:03.170
But where I am talking now it is about the
Atma: the Spirit, which is the reflection

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:11.839
of God Almighty within us, which is the witness,
which watches every moment, every action of

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:12.839
ours.

00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:14.350
And it stays there till it enjoys.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:23.319
To understand the Spirit, we have to know
its nature, what is the nature of the Spirit

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:29.260
is, and then, when we get enlightenment, what
happens to us.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.940
Now here you have seen three powers, as they
have shown you.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.529
The first power is on the right hand side,
is the power of action.

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:43.930
I mean the first one is the power of desire
which is on the left hand side, the second

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:50.160
one is the power of action, and in the centre
is the power of, what we call, the sustenance

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.910
which gives you our evolution.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.390
So we have three powers.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.160
All these three powers act within us.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.360
For example the first power of desire.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:10.600
The first power of desire within us acts in
such a manner that we start desiring for things.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.930
Actually the whole universe is created [and]
out of the universe, this beautiful thing

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.620
like human being is created.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:29.350
And this power that has created this special
thing called ‘human being’ is the residual

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:41.550
power that resides in the triangular bone,
for the ultimate desire to be one with the

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.550
Divine.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:47.210
But it has not yet manifested, so that is
why it is called as a residual power.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.480
It has not yet manifested because we have
not yet become one with the Divine.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:56.720
So that power is still sleeping within us,
that’s why they call it a sleeping Kundalini.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:03.060
But that desire is within us, and that drives
us to all kinds of seeking: we make mistakes,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:10.230
we do all kinds of wrong choices — doesn’t
matter — everything can be forgiven.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:18.170
But she resides in the triangular bone waiting
for a chance when she could be awakened by

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.430
somebody who has the authority to awaken.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:25.509
As he told you just now that it’s an actualisation,
you cannot just go to a church, and somebody

00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:28.680
puts the hand on your head and he says, “All
right, I have baptised you."

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.050
This is only just a false certificate, you
know that.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.720
It’s a false certificate.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:40.810
But when this power is manifested, when you
become one with the Divine, when yoga, the

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:47.829
union, takes place, then only we can say that
Kundalini has manifested itself: means your

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:52.170
desire to be one with the Divine has been
manifested.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:59.230
So now there are four powers I have told you
about: one is the power of desire with which

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.910
we desire other things.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.209
Like we may desire to have a chair.

00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:12.200
So what we do, if there is some steel which
is dead, we make another dead stuff like called

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.740
a ‘chair’, which is of steel — another
dead.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:21.540
We sit on it [and] we start become habituated
with this: means a part of us is deadened,

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.300
because we can’t sit without a chair, the
chair sits on our head.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.089
People carry chairs with them, because they
just can’t sit without the chairs.

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:33.889
Like that the matter starts fighting your
Spirit, and starts giving you habits.

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:38.060
The another thing of matter is that it never
gives you joy.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:43.899
For example, you want to have a table, all
right, then you want to have a chair, then

00:13:43.899 --> 00:13:47.749
you want to have a car, then you want to have
a helicopter, and never happy!

00:13:47.749 --> 00:13:54.560
So, wants in general are never satiable; is
a principle of economics.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.560
Why?

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.689
Because matter cannot give you satisfaction,
that’s why.

00:13:58.689 --> 00:14:00.499
It just plays with you.

00:14:00.499 --> 00:14:05.240
You like one thing, you jump to it, you like
another thing, you jump to another one.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:12.370
Now this matter within us is created by the
right side, that is the power that comes to

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.149
us from five elements.

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:22.290
And these five elements, when they are not
enlightened do not give joy.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.870
They are within us, we use them.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.170
Supposing somebody thinks that, “If I go
to race and if I win a big amount of money

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.709
I’ll be happy."

00:14:31.709 --> 00:14:36.509
But you go and see the person after six months,
you will find that he’s the most unhappy

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:37.629
person ever known.

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:40.699
Because money is a headache, house is a headache.

00:14:40.699 --> 00:14:42.209
Anything that you own is a headache.

00:14:42.209 --> 00:14:46.600
It is better that others should own it and
you should enjoy; that’s a better way of

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600
looking at things.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:54.370
But we think that possession is something
that we can really enjoy, which is not true,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.329
because we are not going to take anything
with us.

00:14:57.329 --> 00:15:02.769
Now when these five elements act upon us,
what happens to us?

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:04.930
What do we develop?

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:09.259
We develop, in the subtle way, the attention.

00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:14.259
Say there is something, a matter, here, my
attention can be drawn to it.

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:19.020
If there is something material, my attention
can be drawn to it.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.360
But supposing something is in the ether, I
cannot see it.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.540
Something that is not material I cannot see
it.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.560
So the attention cannot be drawn.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.339
That’s how our attention is created by these
five elements, within ourselves.

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:38.279
Now this attention that we have: naturally
because it is created by the material things,

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:46.730
in the sense that it is created by the causal
of these elements, our attention goes to material

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.730
things.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.449
It’s natural, because it is created by that,
isn’t it?

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.449
Our attention is outside.

00:15:51.449 --> 00:15:53.620
If I say, “Put your attention inside!”

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.620
How can you?

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.959
I mean there’s no way of putting it inside:
it’s an impossible situation.

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:03.029
Because anything that happens outside, our
attention goes there.

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:08.199
Something material, something substantial
we see, and then our attention goes to that.

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:11.930
But how can you put your attention inside,
because we are lost, we do not know where

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.819
to go, how to find it, how to put our attention
inside.

00:16:14.819 --> 00:16:21.850
So this attention is within us, and when the
Kundalini rises, then the attention is drawn

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.019
in, because of the happening.

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:26.089
That’s why a happening is necessary.

00:16:26.089 --> 00:16:31.300
Supposing suddenly you are listening to me,
and something falls down, your attention will

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.300
go to it.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.029
That is why a happening takes place, that
this Kundalini rises and she attracts the

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.029
attention inside.

00:16:38.029 --> 00:16:44.139
But actually when she touches the Spirit,
what happens to the attention itself?

00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:46.990
The attention becomes enlightened.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.820
Now what is that?

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.529
Attention becomes enlightened, means what?

00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:56.519
Means that this attention has a light.

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:02.519
Now supposing you have an attention which
has a light, what should happen?

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:05.980
That you look at anyone, you should be able
to know that person in and out.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.200
That should be the first thing, isn’t it?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.020
If your attention has the light, you should
be able to see through that person just like

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.419
an x-ray you should know where the problem
is.

00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:20.039
Then, if your attention is enlightened, you
should be able to help that person also, with

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.850
your attention, by paying [attention].

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:28.559
Enlightenment is the enlightenment by the
Divine Power of love.

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:34.970
So if you pay attention to somebody, that
love must act.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.049
Otherwise it is just like any other attention:
You pay attention to this, nothing happens.

00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:41.020
You pay attention to that, nothing happens.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.930
You pay attention to anyone, nothing happens.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:47.190
But when you are enlightened, then your attention
is enlightened.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:52.340
And you will find, after Sahaja Yoga, if you
pay attention to someone, you can cure that

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.340
person.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:59.720
If you have reached a certain stage of maturity
in Sahaj Yog.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.529
Like there was one of the first Sahaja yogis
in England who got his Realisation, who is

00:18:04.529 --> 00:18:07.270
here I think.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.410
He was a little doubtful.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.440
And he said, “Mother you said that our attention
gets enlightened: how are we to know about

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.440
other people?”

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.440
I said, “Very easy!

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.440
About whom do you want to know?”

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.020
He said, “I want to know about my father."

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.190
I said, “All right."

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.650
His father was in Scotland.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.790
“You put your hands and think of your father.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.910
Just think."

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.370
He started a burning here.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.320
Now these are the centres for your father
(right hand) and these are the centres for

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.860
your mother (left hand).

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.390
And this started burning.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.880
Now this finger denotes this centre (Vishuddhi).

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.429
So I told him he must be down with very bad
bronchitis.

00:18:40.429 --> 00:18:45.309
He said, “How can there be telecommunication?”

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:47.880
This is enlightenment, into a new world of
telecommunication!

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.770
I said, “All right you ring up your father!”

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.940
He rang up his father.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.930
And the father never came to the phone.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:05.470
And his mother said, “Your father is down
with very bad bronchitis."

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:10.260
Now sitting down here you can give cure to
that.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.490
Now it’s not a cock and bull story, I must
tell you.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.990
It is so fantastic, that people can’t believe
it.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.990
But you can.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.600
But you have to have certain maturity to do
that.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.090
If your light is a little hazy, then it doesn’t
work out.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:29.850
I mean, you can cure people, sitting down
here, sitting down in London: I should say,

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.679
most humbly I can cure them; I have done it.

00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:36.460
And some other people have done it also.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.340
So what happens is that the attention which
goes there…Now for example, our attention

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.340
is dead in a way.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.820
If it goes there, what happens?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.549
Only thoughts start coming to us.

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:48.140
On the contrary this [thought] is more dominating
[to us] than ourselves.

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.539
Because as soon as we look at something, some
thought starts coming.

00:19:50.539 --> 00:19:54.100
I mean, you can’t look at anything without
some thoughts coming into your head.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.730
I mean, imagine the domination of the matter
on us, that everything gives us a thought!

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:07.090
While, when you look at a thing, when you
are a realised-soul, then this attention acts.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.559
If it is a living thing, you can see the action
working on that.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:13.140
But if it is dead, then what happens?

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.930
Then you become thoughtless.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:24.010
Say you see a beautiful painting, you see
a beautiful painting: now there is no thought

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:29.960
in your mind; so all the creation of that
painting just starts pouring in you as joy.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.710
You feel that joy just pouring into you, because
there is no thought in between.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.590
Otherwise normally we’ll think, “Who has
painted this picture?”

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.090
“Who has done this?”

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.370
How much they must have paid?”

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.370
That’s the first thing!

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.430
First question would be how much money it
must have cost!

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.710
Then second would be, “Who is the artist?”

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:55.200
All these questions actually paralyse the
beauty, the art, the creation of that painting.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:05.580
Like [on] a wave-free surface of some lake,
you can see the complete image, the reflection,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.830
of the surroundings of that lake.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.550
The complete creation, the complete joy comes
to us.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.100
In the same way you become absolutely thoughtless.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:21.200
You see something and you become absolutely
thoughtless, because the joy is so complete,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.429
that you just get stunned and the whole thing
starts pouring into you, like showers of joy.

00:21:27.429 --> 00:21:30.520
It’s an experience which you cannot have
before Realisation.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.450
It’s only possible after Realisation: that
you can enjoy your attention.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.620
And it is such a joker.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:43.710
Your attention plays tricks and tells you
so many things about other people.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:48.660
Like, I was coming and I said, “Now let
us see.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.279
This gentleman, I have to meet him.

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:52.140
Let me see his vibrations."

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.820
I said, “Now.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.429
His vibrations: this is catching."

00:21:55.429 --> 00:21:57.020
All right, what does that mean?

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:02.450
A problem with his wife: either he has no
wife, or if he has a wife, it’s a wrong

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:03.820
relationship, or maybe there’s a problem
with the wife.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.770
This is wife’s [centre].

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.539
And we discovered it was so.

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:12.490
But because I knew about it, I didn’t touch
that point.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.399
Because if you say that, you will have it!

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:15.700
So better not say that point.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.520
You know already about the gentleman, what
sort of a problem he has, so better not touch

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.950
that point and gradually try to remove it.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.990
Like that, it is so easy, after Realisation,
to know about others.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:34.420
Like a gentleman came to see me, he was an
Indian and he knew that a person who is a

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.809
seeker is not supposed to drink, when you
come at least to a holy person.

00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:43.950
But he gave up his drinking: for about eight
days he did not drink, he had a bath everything;

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:48.110
he had a nice mouthwash with everything and
he came and saw me.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.309
And I said, “You have to give up your alcohol
completely."

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:53.809
He said, “Mother how do you know this?”

00:22:53.809 --> 00:22:55.220
I said, “I know!”

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.760
Because the centres that are catching in him
are only possible if you are a drunkard.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.370
And I said, “You have been a drunkard, and
that is why it has been there."

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.299
He agreed that, “I was.

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:07.560
But eight days back I gave it up.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.440
I said, “Eight days makes no difference!

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.070
I know that you have been a drunkard, and
you’ll have to give up that gradually."

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.150
He said, “I will Mother, I promise you."

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.270
But this is really surprised him: how did
I know about it?

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:26.700
So much so that once a lady came to see me,
and I found that her right hand here, was

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.769
completely charring, and this was all catching.

00:23:31.769 --> 00:23:34.750
So I asked her, “What is your relationship
with your father?”

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.120
Especially this finger.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.710
“Oh,” she said, “what has it to do with
it?”.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:45.150
Normally girls in India are very attached
to their fathers and, it’s a very good relationship.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:50.250
I said, “There must be something wrong,
otherwise you can’t get such horrible feelings

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.250
about it."

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.450
“Yes but how do you know Mother?”

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.820
I said, “I know, you better tell me."

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.040
“Oh, it’s all right, it’s all right.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.559
We have a good relationship, nothing wrong,
this, that."

00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:58.559
I said, “Really?”

00:23:58.559 --> 00:24:01.130
She said, “Yes, we have no [problem].

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.269
I mean, it’s perfectly all right!”

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:06.269
And she went away.

00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:07.950
I was wondering; I knew she was telling me
lies.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:12.990
Just after that, her mother came in, and her
father and they said, “Oh that was our daughter

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.360
who had come to see you."

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.360
I said, “Really?”

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:21.419
He said, “Do you know this girl has filed
a [law] suit against me, her father?”

00:24:21.419 --> 00:24:22.419
“Really?”

00:24:22.419 --> 00:24:23.419
“Yes!

00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:24.419
And on wrong basis.

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:26.690
Under the advice of a very wrong person.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:31.900
Her husband is abroad, and some wrong person
has put ideas into her head, and she has filed

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.440
a suit against me."

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.440
“Aaaah!”

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.440
I said, “See!

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.440
That’s what happened!”

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:41.070
So the attention gives you all the information:
when it is enlightened.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.750
It corrects the problems.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:50.850
And of all the things it warns you, it warns
you beforehand.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:55.770
For a Sahaja Yogi, supposing a Sahaja Yogi
is misled, he loses the way, then it is accepted

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.630
that we have to go that way, there is something
we have to do.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.330
And just he goes that way and he finds the
thing that he has lost for a long time, or

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:06.590
he meets a friend whom he has to meet or some
address that he had, he gets it.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:13.620
We don’t mind getting lost or anything because
you find that this was necessary to go that

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.270
way to find something.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.260
It’s so interesting and so interwoven.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:24.929
And sometimes you start understanding, after
some time, that there are angels who are looking

00:25:24.929 --> 00:25:25.929
after you.

00:25:25.929 --> 00:25:28.510
Definitely there are angels who are guiding
us.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:34.830
Every moment, they are there, and taking our
attention to things which are important.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:41.919
Because of Spirit’s quality, to be collectively
conscious, our attention itself becomes collectively

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:42.919
conscious.

00:25:42.919 --> 00:25:45.860
The priorities change.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.740
The priorities change so much.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:56.640
Like I was going in Kashmir one day, in a
car, and suddenly I told my husband, that

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.250
there is tremendous vibrations in this place.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.570
So he asked the driver: he said, “Is there
any temple here?”

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.330
He said, “No, it’s a wilderness.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.800
There is no temple, nothing!”

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.860
I said, “About two, three miles maybe.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.860
Let’s go ahead."

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.220
So he said, “No there’s some muslims staying
here.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.440
There’s no temple, no question of having
a temple."

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.490
I said, “Is there a mosque?”

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.850
“Oh,” he said, “Yes.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.690
There is a mosque of Hazratbal!”

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:26.559
One hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept in that
mosque.

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:30.250
And I felt the vibrations at least four, five
miles away from it!

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.250
Just imagine!

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.049
And when we came about three miles, I could
just tell him how to go there.

00:26:35.049 --> 00:26:38.039
And only one hair was emitting [so many] vibrations.

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:43.649
So the whole priority, the attention, goes
to things which have good, Divine vibrations.

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:46.470
It is not bothered about things which have
no good vibrations.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.679
Whatever has good vibrations, it will go to
that.

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:52.130
Like a person who is a holy person, he touches
anything, it vibrates.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.240
He touches water, it vibrates.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.240
Anything you touch, anything you feel, it
vibrates it.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:05.890
For example, water, if you vibrate it, it
can be a medicine.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.960
River Ganges is nothing but vibrated water!

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.929
You get vibrations from that.

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:17.789
These vibrations are Divine vibrations, are
the vibrations of the power of love of God.

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:22.850
It is something so much out of the blue, that
suddenly if you hear about these things, it

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:29.140
sounds quite odd and fantastic But it is not
at all to Indians, they know about all it.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.480
This knowledge has not come to us.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:36.960
But in the Bible, Christ has said that, “Your
hands will speak."

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.500
Your hands will speak: that means in your
hands you will be feeling it.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.799
He said it very clearly.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:45.780
Your hands will speak: that is what should
happen to us.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:51.690
That our hands should speak, means they should
communicate to us what they have to communicate.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.179
Because all the centres are represented in
our hand.

00:27:55.179 --> 00:28:00.049
As shown there you can see all the centres
are on the left hand side and right hand side,

00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:04.529
you can see very clearly how these centres
are denoted on our hand.

00:28:04.529 --> 00:28:09.100
And once you start feeling them, if you know
the decoding of it, you can immediately say

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.850
what the other person is suffering from, what
you are suffering from.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:19.500
And then you have to learn how to correct
them, those problems of the another person.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.720
So the first thing that happens to you [is]
that your attention becomes enlightened.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:37.090
This attention is so wonderful, is so joy-giving,
it’s so humorous, because you become like

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.019
a witness; the whole thing becomes a joke.

00:28:39.019 --> 00:28:45.100
You see people seriously running up and down
to do something, and you just don’t understand.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.000
And you ask them, “What’s the matter with
you?”

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
“Oh, you don’t know?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.200
It’s very important, very important!”

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.200
“Yes what?”

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.270
“I have put all my money for the race."

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.019
And he comes back, head hung!

00:28:57.019 --> 00:28:58.019
“What happened?”

00:28:58.019 --> 00:29:00.519
“I lost all my money!”

00:29:00.519 --> 00:29:04.139
The way he was running, the way he is coming
back, is a big joke.

00:29:04.139 --> 00:29:08.761
But to him it’s not: he becomes serious,
sometimes he becomes involved into in, sometimes

00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:11.809
elated, but you are just enjoying the whole
joke.

00:29:11.809 --> 00:29:16.040
The whole tragedy and comedy of life you enjoy,
like a spectator.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.630
You become the spectator: you are no more
worried, upset or in tension.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:27.370
Actually I have seen people who are very hot
tempered become so placid and so sweet and

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.370
so poised.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:33.919
It’s surprising how they change, because
they have got the balancing point, the absolute

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:34.919
point.

00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:38.210
This is what happens to your attention when
you get Realisation.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:43.850
But then what happens to your awareness, which
you get from the central path of your evolution?

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:48.710
For example animals have an awareness.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.149
Also we have an awareness.

00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:54.509
We have awareness much higher than that of
animals.

00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:59.200
Some people say, “Yes we can play tennis,
you see."

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.269
that’s a higher awareness than animals.

00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:04.049
But some people cannot play tennis or understand
it.

00:30:04.049 --> 00:30:09.600
But one awareness human beings have, definitely
— whatever they may be, at whatever level

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.460
— that they understand what is dirty, what
is filthy.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.649
They can smell it; animals can’t.

00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:22.190
You take a horse or a dog through a dirty
length, it will just walk like a king, as

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.899
if it’s leading a parade for the queen — it
has no problems.

00:30:26.899 --> 00:30:28.580
But for human beings we just can’t do it!

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.860
We have to put something to cover our nose.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.450
So, like that, we have many other things which
we have achieved as human beings.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.100
We have sense of colour, we have sense of
beauty, we have sense of balance.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:48.019
We have so many things, which dogs may not
have, horses may not have, dolphins may not

00:30:48.019 --> 00:30:49.019
have.

00:30:49.019 --> 00:30:52.370
They are so close to us — they live with
us — but they may not have those senses

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.049
as we have.

00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:59.929
But now, what happens to human awareness,
at this stage, is that this human awareness

00:30:59.929 --> 00:31:03.710
suddenly jumps up into a new dimension.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.149
You become collectively conscious.

00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:06.149
You become!

00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:07.149
Again, I say.

00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:10.880
It’s an actualisation: it happens to your
awareness.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.700
You just become collectively conscious.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:21.559
Means, little children, today Olympia, she
was interviewing me, she came and she put

00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:26.529
her fingers in her ears, because the lady
who was talking to me had a problem in her

00:31:26.529 --> 00:31:28.389
throat.

00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:32.669
Perhaps maybe she has to use her throat too
much also, or maybe something else.

00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:34.250
So she put her fingers in her ears.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.880
You see, this is the mantra we use “Allah
hu akbar” by putting fingers.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.960
The little one, she is very small, about two
years of age, she just put in.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.639
But still she felt she has not helped me fully,
so she put both her fingers in the mouth to

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:51.440
suggest that please look after the lady, she’s
got this problem.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:59.210
The concern and the feeling that you get for
another person is so tremendous, so tremendous,

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:03.289
that people can’t understand but it’s
very simple [to explain], because if you become

00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:07.130
part and parcel of the person, how can you
not have concern?

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.019
I mean who is the other?

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:12.970
The problem is [that] now, supposing you are
sitting before me, and you have a problem

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.700
in your stomach, I’ll also have a little
problem.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.000
And I’ll be so concerned about that problem
that it is as if in my stomach that problem

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.100
is existing.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.389
It is like that.

00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:27.059
The awareness becomes so collectively conscious
that it becomes part and parcel of you.

00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:28.220
Who is the other?

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.889
The feeling of otherness goes away.

00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:35.100
Now people talk big things like, “We are
all united,” “We are all brothers and

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.370
sisters, and this and this."

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:37.559
You must have heard all these speeches.

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:41.080
And when it comes to war, they’ll fight.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.490
But in this, you cannot fight, because who
is the other?

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.490
You can’t fight your nose.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.309
You can’t fight your hand.

00:32:46.309 --> 00:32:47.600
You can’t fight your fingers.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.030
Nor do you help anyone.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.169
You don’t help anyone.

00:32:50.169 --> 00:32:55.029
Because supposing this finger is in trouble
and this hand presses it, does it help it?

00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:56.029
Nothing!

00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:58.080
This is neither obliged, nor this is helping.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.429
This is one.

00:32:59.429 --> 00:33:05.130
That feeling of oneness — that you are part
and parcel of the whole is — established.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:09.960
Because of that feeling, that is such a tremendous
feeling that you are part and parcel of the

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.130
whole, that you get cured.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:23.159
The curing comes because of that innate understanding
by your being, that you are not alone: you

00:33:23.159 --> 00:33:30.389
are part and parcel of the whole, you are
a cell of the whole body of God, or you are

00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:33.000
a microcosm of the macrocosm.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.919
This is not just a psychological or a rational
thing, but you just become.

00:33:38.919 --> 00:33:41.450
You just become, you can’t help it.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.049
And when you are that, you just don’t feel
you are helping anyone.

00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:49.020
It’s just like one cell acting for another
cell.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.720
The whole thing works in such a homogeneous
way: no fighting, no quarrelling.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.980
On the contrary, you enjoy each other!

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.610
You just love each other.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:01.460
And you just see the good points of another
person.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.330
You don’t see the bad points.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.679
You forget the race, you forget all creeds,
and everything you forget.

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.470
Because a nose doesn’t say, “I am higher
than the hands!”

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.470
Does it say?

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.040
Or the feet do not say, “I am lower than
the hands!”

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040
They all are required.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.670
Supposing there is something wrong with the
feet, you will just try to help.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.000
Something wrong with the nose, you’ll help
your nose.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.960
You don’t discriminate in your body, do
you?

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.850
In the same way, we do not discriminate.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:30.080
Once you become realised-souls, whether you
are from India or from Asia, or from any other

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.150
place, from England, America, any place you
may be.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:37.580
You may be Chinese: every sort of faces that
we have, in the cross section of Sahaja Yogis!

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.670
You will find all kinds of people are there,
and they all love each other.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:46.410
You must see the way when these people from
England went to India, to the villages where

00:34:46.410 --> 00:34:48.790
I worked: the villagers just grabbed them!

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:54.810
And they were so happy: they said, “First
time we are meeting our brothers and sisters!”

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.150
And these people were just enjoying them,
and they all started dancing.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:02.220
Of course they are very light-footed and they
wanted all these people to dance with them.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.550
And though the Britishers are not so light-footed
as they are, so they found it rather difficult.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.560
So they made them jump, jump, jump!

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.080
And now they have become good dancers too;
and they all dance together and sing together,

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.750
in complete joy and understanding.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.540
The whole attitude towards life changes.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:24.520
You become really a princess in the sense
that you don’t need anything — there is

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.520
no dearth.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.450
If there is a dearth then you are beggar.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.720
If there is no dearth, you can sleep here,
you can sleep in a palace.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.200
If you want you can get a Rolls Royce or if
you want, you can walk.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.440
What’s the harm?

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.680
What’s the difference?

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.910
Because the joy comes from your Spirit, not
from outside things.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.030
The whole idea of comfort changes.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.720
The whole idea of luxury changes.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.880
It’s all completely changed because you
enter into this new dimension.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.080
And that’s what happens to your awareness:
that you become collectively conscious.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:02.840
The enlightenment gives a human awareness
a new dimension by which you are collectively

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.990
conscious.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:09.800
Now emotion gives us happiness: if you love
somebody you feel happy, and [if] you meet

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.860
that person you feel happy.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.680
And you want to bestow all your love on that
person.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.830
If your children are there, you want to love
them, and give them love.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:22.510
But before Realisation, this joy is limited.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.980
For example, husband wife relation I can understand.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.280
But about children, like in India: they love
their children so much that they will even

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.900
sell their country for their children’s
sake.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.900
The love becomes like a possession.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.610
It becomes a love hate relationship.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.330
They love so much that they come to hatred.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.050
It’s a funny thing but it happens.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.050
Why?

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.630
Because it has limitations.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.550
Love has limitations: it’s not infinite.

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:54.790
But when you get your love enlightened you
get joy.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:37:00.610
There’s no material given thing, just you
enjoy each other.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:05.430
In Calcutta first time on my way to America
I had gone.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:09.020
I was staying in a hotel and there were five
or six other Sahaja Yogis staying with me,

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.020
in other rooms.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.260
And one gentleman came to see me, and he fell
at my feet, and tremendous vibrations he had.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.440
And they all rushed: “Who has come?

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.990
Who has come?”

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.920
I said, “Why?”

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.890
“Tremendous joy started flowing on our head,
Mother!

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.580
Who is at your feet?”

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.870
They all rushed to me.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.110
I said, “See this one."

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.110
“Haahh!”

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.110
They all stood, ‘Haahh!

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:32.110
What enjoyment!

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:33.110
What enjoyment!”

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.110
He was enjoying.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:35.110
They were enjoying him.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.940
This is the first time you enjoy human beings.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.320
Because you can feel the vibrations of a person.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:48.720
What a beauty [a] human being is, what a glory
he is, what a blessing he is, what a creation

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.230
he is, you realise only after Realisation.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:57.080
Before that, you judge him — “Oh he has
got long hair,” “He has got red hair,”

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.570
“He has got long nose” — All that.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.000
But then you just see him in a subtle way.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.760
What he is, is his vibrations.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.530
And so many people I have seen — Sahaja
Yogis also — if they get somebody they’ll

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:10.530
all rush there.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.160
The fellow is there, and they are all taking
vibrations, for half an hour and I am tired.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.590
I say, “Now finish it off!”

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:20.800
But no they are just sucking it like a child.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:28.080
First time you enjoy human beings — the
joy which has not duality.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.450
Joy does not have happiness and unhappiness.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:35.200
Happiness comes to us when our ego is pampered.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.150
Unhappiness comes to us when our ego is damped.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.380
It is something different.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.330
We are not our egos, we are our Self.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.900
And when Self enjoys something, it enjoys
it.

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:52.850
There is no remorse, there is no duality about
it, there is no unhappiness.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.450
So joy is a complete thing.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:56.450
It cannot be described.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:00.130
It is just to be experienced, and enjoyed
within ourselves.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.650
And that’s what happens to us.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:07.520
When we get our Realisation our idea of love
changes.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.650
Like, you say, “Oh I love this person only."

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.850
Like your husband is there, you have to love
him like a husband.

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:17.430
You don’t love everybody like a husband.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:21.280
Your sister is there, you love her like a
sister.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:24.080
But you think all others as your sisters.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.520
Then you love your brothers; you think them
to be your brothers.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.680
You love all of them.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.500
The love spreads, like that.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.390
It does not rest in one place.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:39.530
It does not stagnate, it does not coagulate.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:46.480
Supposing in a plant, sap is rising and it
goes to one flower because it loves it, and

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.480
settles down there.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.250
The tree will die and the flower will die.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:56.610
So the love we have before Realisation, is
like that love, which dies ultimately or creates

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.480
problems and it dies.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:05.230
But love after Realisation is a love that
emits, just flows.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.230
You don’t get anything.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.230
“What do you get?”

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.230
people ask me.

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.600
I mean my husband is in a different line and
I have a double life, and all my friends ask,

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.640
“What do you get out of it?”

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.890
I say, “I am not here to get.

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.150
I get out something from me.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.860
It’s just to give, is to enjoy."

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.880
As I told your mayor today, “Your politics
will be solved.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.880
You’ll have no parties."

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.730
He said, “How can that be?”

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:34.160
I said, “See now: I have supposing all the
powers, so I am a capitalist.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.980
But I must share, so I’m a communist.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.810
I have to be a pure communist and a pure capitalist.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:44.830
So how can I have two parties when both the
things exist within me?”

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.001
That’s how you solve your politics.

00:40:47.001 --> 00:40:48.300
How do you solve your economics?

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:53.810
The whole transaction areas and all those
things come from a false idea that matter

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.910
can give us happiness: it cannot.

00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:03.080
Only the matter that has a certain coefficience,
which gives vibrations, is the only thing

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080
that gives you joy.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.820
Now we don’t know if there is such matter
around.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.450
For example somebody will say Stonehenge.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.020
I mean, it looks funny with the druids.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.100
Of course they don’t know anything, I agree.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:20.210
But it is not [funny], because Stonehenge
is created by the Mother Earth.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.210
It has vibrations.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:25.590
They can’t feel anything, they are standing
there, singing songs, this, that.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:28.700
Somebody must have felt in their forefathers.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:34.630
There are many places where you get vibrations
from the Mother Earth, so many.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:39.420
It is written in the Bible, in the ten commandments,
only that whatever is created by the Mother

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:45.390
Earth or by the sky should not be reproduced
by human beings and worshipped.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:49.360
But there are many things which have come
out of the Mother Earth.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.680
But unless and until you have vibrations,
how will you know?

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680
You don’t know the truth.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:57.440
So in the human awareness, to know the truth,
is very relative.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.640
You will say that, “How is it that this
person is fake and that person is not fake?”

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.420
“This is truth that is not truth?”

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.980
There’s no way of knowing it.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.600
Unless and until you get to the Absolute point,
how will you know the relative?

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.540
So when you get your Realisation, you can
ask, “Is he a real man?”

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.570
If he is, you will get vibrations.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:25.870
If he’s not, then, you might even get blisters;
vibrations will stop maybe; little bit blisters

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:29.060
you might get, if he is not a right type of
a person.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.970
If somebody is obstinate, you will get indication.

00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:35.622
If somebody is suffering from some possession,
you will get indication.

00:42:35.622 --> 00:42:39.310
If somebody is mentally mad, you will know.

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:43.370
It’s very, very systematic, and very scientific.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:50.550
God’s laws never fail, [are] very attentive,
and everything that you know through it is

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.000
absolute and correct.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.730
Only thing is you have to learn: you have
to train up your mind to understand these

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:57.730
different things.

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:03.950
But small children are much cleverer than
bigger people; because you see, they have

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:08.850
so many hangups, they have so many complications,
they rationalise everything.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:14.300
Children will just say this: “This is this!”

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:19.830
Now people think that, “How can it be free?”

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.980
How can it be with money?

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.800
I ask the other question!

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.770
We cannot think of these things in the terms
that I’d say [is] Divine, because you have

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.950
never known it before.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.830
How much money did Christ get?

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:40.430
We have a life here of Christ: how much money
did he take?

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:44.810
Now Christianity as such — they asked me
a question today — I mean it cannot deliver

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:45.810
the goods!

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:54.280
They are Christians, they go to church, but
is their life Christian?

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.010
Churches cannot deliver the goods.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.820
But that doesn’t mean that you run away
from Christ.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:04.040
You can run away from that kind of things,
but not from Christ, because Christ exists.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:11.690
He definitely exists within us, and is a special
person because he’s placed at a very pivotal

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:25.980
point, between the centre of the optic chiasma,
where the pituitary and pineal body are there

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.170
and he controls our ego and superego.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:33.220
And when the Kundalini rises, then Christ
is awakened, and he sucks all of our karmas,

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.300
all of our sins.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.980
That’s what he said — that he has suffered
for our sins.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:44.330
They will say Christ, in the church they say
it, and then why do they ask you to suffer?

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:48.190
If Christ has suffered, why should we suffer
anymore?

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.280
There should be no sufferings anymore, just
enjoy and rejoice.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.190
He’s done everything for us.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.060
Or do you want him to suffer more?

00:44:55.060 --> 00:45:01.400
There are Jews who said, that, “We don’t
believe in Christ, and we have to suffer."

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.400
Already, “Have Mr Hitler for you!”

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.970
If they want another one, they can have another
one.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:08.240
And go on with your suffering.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.810
It is high time that they accept Christ and
give up their sufferings, otherwise, they

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:15.010
are putting their sufferings on other people.

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.820
There is no suffering needed anymore.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:23.980
It’s a funny idea, I don’t understand,
why people say you must suffer to become spiritual?

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.200
Who has given you these ideas?

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:33.820
Actually among Hindus it was believed that,
our karmas, we have to pay for it.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.240
Yes, all right.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.600
Up to what point?

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.820
Till somebody called Mahavishnu comes in:
that is Christ.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:43.030
He’s called as ‘Mahavishnu’.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:49.720
All the signs and symptoms of Christ are described
as Mahavishnu in the Devi Mahatmyam, but who

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.720
reads that?

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.190
I mean Christians will only read Bible!

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.420
Will they read something else?

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.901
So they never knew.

00:45:55.901 --> 00:45:59.390
And when the missionaries went from here,
they never talked about Christ like that.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.810
“Oh,” they just said, “you’d better
get converted."

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.740
They used to brand everyone: Christian, Christian,
Christian, Christian.

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.960
They would put a loaf of bread in the water,
and say that, “This is the beef, and all

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.400
of you have become now Christians!”

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.560
So by villages they became Christians.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:18.090
Imagine this kind of a Christianity, how far
is it going to go?

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:23.390
They never said that Christ is the one who
was Mahavishnu because they never knew.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:24.763
Until I told them that it was he, the Mahavishnu
who came, who has come already.

00:46:24.763 --> 00:46:27.350
And he is going to suck our [karmas].

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.860
So this is done, then what?

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.950
Why to worry about karmas?

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.210
[They are] finished!

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.490
All our karmas are over.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:41.060
But here we have Christ, but we don’t know
his essence.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:44.510
We don’t know what is he there for, what
was the need for him to crucify himself.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:53.610
It was just to create a tremendous Deity within
us, that is Christ, who will suck our up our

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.610
[bad] vibrations.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.710
Now we have many Jews who are our disciples.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:59.720
They will jolly well have to accept Christ,
because Kundalini does not rise unless and

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.480
until you accept it here.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.290
But even those Christians who don’t accept,
say Moses, or Jehovah: they have to accept

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:08.290
that Jehovah is sitting here (above Agnya).

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:09.710
That’s the Viraata.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:19.110
That’s the Akbar: that, you have to see
for yourself when the Kundalini rises.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:23.420
You’ll be amazed, unless and until you say
Lord’s prayer, it won’t rise above this

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.540
(Agnya), if it is stuck there.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.080
And all the Christians have this problem.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:32.780
You will be surprised that Christ himself
is angry with them.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.510
You have to say Lord’s prayer.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:39.040
That’s why he said, “You will be calling
me ‘Christ, Christ,’ and I won’t recognise

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.040
[you]."

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.790
Just imagine!

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:52.330
Then you have to say Lord’s prayer in front
of some holy personality [so that] he forgives

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.290
you, and then the Kundalini rises.

00:47:55.290 --> 00:48:00.040
Just imagine — he was the one who was the
controller of ego, he is the one who sucks

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:05.570
our ego, and see the Christian nations: if
there is one thing they cannot get out is

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:06.570
their ego.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:07.820
Now they are realising it, no doubt.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.990
But still to get out of it, they have to fight
it; and the more you fight it, it becomes

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:15.770
like a balloon — big, big, big, big, big.

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:17.800
But by fighting it you cannot get out of it.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:24.670
Only by rising through the central path you
can suck it, through the awakening of Christ,

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:28.590
and you get your Realisation as cool breeze
coming out of your head.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:36.410
But when it happens also, as I said, people
do not know what it is — these Brahma Shakti

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:41.650
or what you call this cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost, what it is, because they didn’t allow

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:42.880
Christ to live long.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.870
He lived for hardly three and a half years
to talk about it.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:54.300
I mean the way they treated him was really
so atrocious and so cruel.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.700
To whom could he talk, to these fishermen?

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.700
About Kundalini?

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.640
I mean they made it impossible!

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.090
Same with Mohammed Sahib: Arabs could not
accept Mohammed at all.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:12.220
And they have not yet accepted him, the way
they are crucifying him everyday.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.300
He couldn’t tell people about it.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.530
But he did promise that it will happen to
you.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:24.870
He’s promised that a Comforter will come,
so that you will know my Father forever — means

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:26.740
you will get your Self-Realisation.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.140
He promised it.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.300
But how will you make him out?

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.930
How will you make out the Comforter?

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:33.300
How will you find out, if Christ comes in?

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.550
Now some ‘christ’ is being announced.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.380
It’s a big joke.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:42.190
You’d better tell this ‘Mr Christ’ to
walk on the water.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.230
And you’ll find him out!

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:45.000
We had one in India.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.250
He told that he is going to walk on the water.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.920
And mad people from America, they came with
televisions, telescopes, and all Indians were

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.510
there to see the fun of the whole thing.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:58.510
All of them came here and Government also
encouraged people because lots of foreign

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:02.390
exchange, you know, for this kind of tomfoolery!

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:10.210
They all came, they occupied premises in a
very big hotel, where there was a huge big

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:16.100
swimming bath, where this fellow was supposed
to walk on the water.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.530
And they had telescopes and every sort of
thing there.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:25.160
And apart from that they had a television
set, and from America they were going to release

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.510
all the scenes of what was going to happen.

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:32.210
This fellow came forward, it was on the television,
you could see it.

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:35.860
He put one foot, and with the second foot
he was down!

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.240
(laughter) He couldn’t even swim!

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.280
Can you imagine?

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.010
And they had to fish him out!

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.690
And he was put in the hospital, and they found
he had cancer.

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:51.550
But imagine, when they asked, “Why did you
do all this?”

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.580
He said, “At least I got a name!”

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.910
Imagine!

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:59.860
Like some hijackers, they say that, “At
least by doing these things, we will get some

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:00.860
name."

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:05.250
You know there are some maniacs who want to
appear in the newspaper this way or that way.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.090
So he said, “I got a big name, in America.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:09.350
Everywhere, everyone knows me!”

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.220
Thank God he’s no more now to befool some.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.340
You see these tricks they play.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.060
So these tricks have nothing to do with God.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.500
If he’s Christ, let him walk on the water!

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:24.360
If you people will be kind enough, you better
write to this gentleman who has spent so much

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:28.540
money in the newspapers, especially to the
journalists I would request.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:32.240
Because journalism takes to such stupid people
very easily, I don’t know why.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240
They will publish.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.260
You know they published such a lot of things
about this nonsensical ‘christ’ who has

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.260
come.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.260
Better ask him.

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.980
There’s another one who was trying to teach
flying.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:49.970
Poor things who were flying, one of them is
sitting here, she was the directress of the

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:54.430
institution, got epilepsy, the husband got
epilepsy, the child got epilepsy, all of them.

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:56.980
They lost all their money, all their property,
everything.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.830
That’s how they were flying on the streets
of London.

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:03.160
I said, “Why not ask the guru to fly?

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.630
Why not use these leaning tower of Pisa?

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:06.630
Just throw him down.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:07.780
Let’s see how far he can fly!”

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.020
And then they were paying £3,000 to learn
flying nonsense!

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.390
Why do you want to fly?

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:17.960
Are you going to become birds now?

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:25.850
Like these nonsensical tricks they play on
you, and you believe them.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:34.640
It is never said in any scripture, any books,
anywhere that you will be flying as religious

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.500
people or as spiritual people — never!

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.540
Nor that you will be becoming mad.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:47.920
Even ‘St’ Paul who was — I don’t know
how they included him in the Bible — I can’t

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.780
understand how was he a Christian?

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:50.860
This is first thing.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.100
If he saw the light, well and good.

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.860
Who saw the light?

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:58.780
Now supposing you go and say, “I have seen
the light, and I have become a great Christian!”

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:03.550
and you start organising it, must you be included
in Bible?

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:06.440
He has no idea of Christ, and he has no idea
of reality!

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:11.220
When I saw him [in The Bible] I said, “From
where does this gentleman come in?”

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:19.150
He was nowhere near reality and he said, that
people got like mad when Holy Ghost came,

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:24.670
everybody started laughing and they started
saying all kinds of words and all kinds of

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:25.670
languages.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:26.670
It’s very easy.

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:34.220
You see, say if an Indian possesses you, you
will start behaving just like an Indian: you’ll

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:39.250
speak Indian language, you may be thieving,
telling lies — all these things which are

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.250
their character.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:45.770
Or if you are an English man entered into
an Indian, you will start speaking Oxbridge

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:46.820
English.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:52.280
It’s possible — you have seen these things
happening to people when they get possessed,

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.640
they do it.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.000
It’s all possession.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.430
What is the way to know what you have got?

00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:03.580
It’s so much unknown that, anything that
is unknown is not God!

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:08.910
There is collective subconscious, and there
is collective supraconscious.

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:11.970
Anybody can enter in from that area and can
possess us.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:19.800
You must have seen a film shown by some doctors
who said that cancer is caused by some proteins

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:27.250
— proteins which come to us from the areas
which are built within us since the time of

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.920
our creation — that’s collective subconscious.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.720
They say it clearly — protein 58 to protein
52.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:41.870
They say it so clearly about it that, that
is what triggers our cancer.

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.160
But they don’t know how to control them.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.870
Of course, I have been saying this for the
last twelve years!

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:50.200
But nobody understood at that time when I
was saying that it is the collective subconscious

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.470
from where these things come in.

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:56.470
Christ is the one who took out [dead] spirits
and put in the pigs.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:55:02.840
And here they are talking of Christian movements
like you have got Pentecostals and charismatic

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.300
and this and that, where they are putting
spirits into you!

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:11.340
And when they come before me, they shake like
this — just like this — and go into an

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.340
epileptic mood.

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:15.710
I sometimes you see there are a hundred spirits
sitting in those people.

00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:20.320
They have no idea as to what to do with the
dead, they are so naïve.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.250
In the church you are sitting on a dead body
— God knows how many.

00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:27.780
They don’t know how to do that.

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:33.040
For example if an Indian lady from India comes
in, she walks like this, saving her feet,

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.240
“Oh God, they are sleeping here!”

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:42.050
We know that when they are buried there, maybe
their dead souls are around.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:46.730
But here in the church you go: I mean [it’s]
a very nice way of possessing a person!

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:55.010
There’s a Sahaja Yogini in Paris: her mother
was about sixty years of age — not very

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:59.520
old because I am of that age — and she was
so mad, she became so mad, that she did not

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.260
know what was a bidet and what was a WC.

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:10.200
And she was a funny woman, and she sometimes
used to forget even her daughter!

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:16.690
But Sunday morning she would get up in a very
normal way, dress up very well, go to the

00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:19.170
church, say her prayers and come back.

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:22.730
I mean, like a possessed person, she used
to walk.

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:27.030
But somehow one of the Sundays she got lost
and she informed the police.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:30.960
The police said, “You better send her to
one of these places where the old are looked

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:31.960
after."

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:38.520
So this Marie told me that, when they put
her there, she found there are many like this

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.260
who get up on Sundays!

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.090
There is a church for them.

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:45.260
Also there are dead bodies of these mad women.

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:49.830
They go to this church every Sunday, again
they are mad for the whole week, again on

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:54.110
the Sunday, they get up and go to the church
and come back.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.410
Just imagine!

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.820
How can that be God?

00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.830
You mean these dead spirits are God?

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:04.230
And will He shake you all the time like this,
if God enters into you?

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:06.600
How can it be?

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.100
It’s maddening.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:14.280
Will you become more dignified and beautiful,
or you will become ridiculous?

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.830
Just ask a question to yourself?

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:19.850
In the Bible, it is written that everybody
said that these people are possessed, and

00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:22.650
they laughed at them, and they said they have
gone mad.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.330
And still it is in the Bible, and people read
it!

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:27.390
“Let us read chapter this…”

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:30.000
Just imagine describing mad people!

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.780
And that has become ‘authentic’, now who
is going to challenge them?

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.790
They’ll kill me if I tell them that, but
it’s a fact.

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:37.000
This is not what is going to happen to you.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.550
What Christ has said [is] “Your hands will
speak."

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:49.430
Even Mohammed Sahib has said more about the
day of resurrection.

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:57.180
He didn’t talk of the day of death first,
of the complete destruction first, he talked

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.430
more about the day of resurrection.

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:00.430
Christ also [about] the day of judgement.

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.650
They did not talk of the death.

00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:10.030
While there are people sitting around and
thinking, “Now when will that day come when

00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.840
we’ll all be finished?”

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.840
Imagine!

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.760
We have reached that state of confusion that
we are waiting for a complete destruction,

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:20.810
trying to celebrate it, the way people are
anxious about it.

00:58:20.810 --> 00:58:26.230
First of all, you all have to enter into the
Kingdom of God – that’s the place for

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:27.230
you.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.230
That’s the place to enjoy.

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:29.580
That’s the place God has made.

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:38.250
He has not made you a human being to suffer
and suffer and die in suffering, then we have

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:39.410
never understood Him.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:42.300
He is the Father of compassion.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:47.000
He is the ocean of love, an ocean of forgiveness.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.900
We have forgotten, what His nature is.

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.410
And we really misunderstand that he has made
us to suffer.

00:58:55.410 --> 00:59:00.120
This is really absolutely [an] anti-God idea,
I think, and I just can’t understand how

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.130
can we really gulp it down.

00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:08.210
It’s too much, to believe that God will
make you suffer.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:10.270
Or [that] Kundalini makes you suffer is another
worse idea.

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:11.270
She is your Mother.

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:12.270
She has been with you.

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:13.270
She has been waiting.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:14.620
She is your own mother.

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.420
Everybody has an individual Mother.

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:21.640
She has been waiting for this day to give
you Realisation, is she going to make you

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.640
suffer?

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.680
May God bless you all.

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:29.940
I’m very happy to be back, and I hope you’ll
have more people next time and I’ll be able

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.490
to come back again.

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:37.870
If you have any problems, any questions, you
may ask me.

00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:54.090
Seeker: You said on the radio interview today,
that you were destined to become what you

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.700
are today.

00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:59.850
Are we also destined?

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:02.030
Shri Mataji: You have hit the point.

01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:03.450
That’s it!

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:05.580
Absolutely, that’s it!

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:12.180
You are all destined to come and get Realisation
— absolutely that’s it!

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:17.170
Otherwise, do you think am I mad to go about?

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:21.350
Have you ever known so many seekers in this
world?

01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:24.010
Not only destined, but [with] deliberations.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:33.370
You have deliberately taken birth in those
days to get your Realisation, and to do the

01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:39.640
work of God, and to enjoy the bliss of God.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.490
It’s a deliberate action on your part.

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:46.370
Destination is of course there, but deliberations
are there [too].

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:53.100
You have to be all very special people to
do that, no doubt.

01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:58.600
That’s a quality, that’s a quality: everybody
doesn’t have that quality.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.600
That’s a quality of people, and only such
people can stick on.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:08.940
I couldn’t tell this to our mayor, that
it’s a quality that is lacking.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.940
It’s a quality.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.550
They just know that — this is the truth.

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.140
Seeker: Isn’t possible to abuse the Kundalini?

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.880
Shri Mataji: No, never, never, never, never!

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880
You cannot, never.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880
Seeker: But can you awaken it through the
wrong channel?

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.070
Shri Mataji: You cannot do it.

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:24.100
You cannot do it.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:25.590
You just cannot.

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.450
It’s the wisdom.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:33.190
Kundalini is awakened only by the permission
of a Deity which is wisdom.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.960
You can never misuse it.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.050
You can never sell it.

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:42.990
I’ll give you an example.

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:46.460
There was a gentleman, an Indian, whom I gave
Realisation in America, who started his own

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.460
organisation.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.880
As usual Indians are very good at making money.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.700
Put them anywhere, they’ll make money.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:58.180
This fellow, first he behaved all right, and
then he started his organisation and all that

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.460
and he wrote to me, “I am doing this Sahaja
Yoga, I am doing this, and I’ve got lots

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:02.460
of people coming."

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.460
He put a fees and all that.

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:04.820
I didn’t know how he was running it.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.370
Of course, you can charge for the food all
right, you can charge for your stay.

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:13.030
But when he came — the people in Bombay
are very sensitive — they told me, “Mother,

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:14.240
we are fainting with this man!

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.310
What’s the matter with him?

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:16.530
We are all feeling giddy."

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:17.750
I said, “Don’t you worry.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:18.750
I’ll find out."

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:19.750
When he came, I said, “Can I have a look
at your brochure?”

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:23.030
In the brochure, he had written, “For vibrations,
ordinary, $125.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.460
For special ones $280!”

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.240
I said, “Sir why this?”

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:29.090
He said, “Mother how am I to live?”

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:32.680
I said, “What were you doing?”

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.270
He said, “I was a teacher."

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:41.060
I said, “You go ahead with your teaching.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:44.301
How much money did you pay me to get your
vibrations that you put this kind of a thing

01:02:44.301 --> 01:02:45.301
there?”

01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:46.850
He said, “But how am I going to live?”

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:47.850
And he got into a temper, and he became very
red.

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:52.510
Now, “I can talk to you about it.

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:55.990
You cannot take any money for it."

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:57.190
So he got very angry.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.740
He said, “I am going to see one Guru."

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:00.950
I said, “Go and see him!”

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:03.080
This is a guru living in Calicut (Kozhikode).

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.970
Actually I have never met him.

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:09.020
But this fellow, when he came back, he telephoned
to me.

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:12.340
He said, “Mother please forgive me, please
forgive me, please forgive me."

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.340
I said, “What happened?”

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:17.800
He telephoned, and on the telephone he said,
“I must tell you all of what happened."

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800
I said, “What happened?”

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.950
He said, “I went there, and when I reached
the gate, this guru was sitting in a hut,

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:27.340
and he started throwing stones at me: one
after another, so many stones he threw that

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.230
I just sat down there.

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:31.092
He said, “What do you mean?

01:03:31.092 --> 01:03:35.700
You have said those things to Mother and you
think I will give you some blessings here?

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.390
These are my blessings, go ahead!”

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:46.180
And poor fellow, he went back: he went and
sat in the station, on the platform.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:50.540
And one of this guru’s persons went and
said that, “What did you say to Mother?

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:55.960
He knows that Mother is there, and how dare
you say something to Mother?”

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.750
He said, “Because I was making money and
she was angry with me, and this."

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.270
He said, “You better go and ask for forgiveness!”

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:06.640
For three days, he stayed on the platform
and on the fourth day the guru sent for him

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.640
[and] he came.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.720
And then he said a Sanskrit shloka in my praise
and all that.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.100
He said, “Just go and read it out to Mother,
that’s all."

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:16.710
So he brought that and read it on the phone.

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.810
But somehow he could not meet me.

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:22.030
He tried his level best but he just could
not meet me.

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:23.640
And he read that to me.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.810
But when this guru, I told him that, “Why
don’t you go to America, because this year

01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:28.850
I won’t be able to go?”

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:31.570
He went to New York, he was there for three
days and he went back.

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:33.360
He said, “They are all mad people!

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.390
They are dollar-mad!

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:35.390
I can’t stay there.

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:37.150
They were offering me dollars for everything."

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.200
So he ran back!

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.350
He couldn’t stay there.

01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:40.840
So there are realised-souls.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:44.440
There are people who know about Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.060
But they know that you cannot sell it.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:53.290
If you try to do anything like that — finished
— you will lose your vibrations immediately.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:57.160
They are very sensitive, very sensitive.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.500
If you are ignorant, then it’s all right,
they will stay.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.340
But knowingly if you do something, just they’ll
disappear.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.780
And you won’t like it, because when they
are flowing you are enjoying yourself, and

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.690
you just stop [enjoying].

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:21.630
Those who don’t know anything about Kundalini,
they say the Kundalini is in the stomach,

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:25.580
this, that — they are not authorised people,
they try to play tricks with Kundalini — they

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.610
get into trouble.

01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:31.590
Because it’s not the Kundalini, because
She is the Mother, but the Deity, the Deity

01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:35.940
that is Christ actually in another form called
Ganesha is sitting down there.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:40.840
He hits them hard onto the sympathetic, and
that’s how they get it, all the problems.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.750
Seeker: So how do other gurus raise the Kundalini?

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:47.990
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am going to do.

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:49.960
Once I have done it, then you will do.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.540
First an enlightened light must enlighten
you.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.490
Once you are enlightened, you enlighten other
people.

01:05:55.490 --> 01:06:01.100
Dr Warren: He said, how do other gurus raise
the Kundalini?

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:04.840
Shri Mataji: Which one?

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.940
Which one?

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.140
Let’s have him out.

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:10.710
I will send half of them to them.

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:12.170
Who is the one?

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:13.530
They just talk.

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:16.260
Seeker: Swami Muktananda is quite popular.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:20.380
Shri Mataji: You think he’s raising Kundalini
or he’s putting bhoots?

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:22.090
He is putting possessions!

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:24.250
They just dance, dance, dance.

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.060
Anybody can dance, what is so great?

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:30.960
Anybody can dance, what is there so great
in dancing?

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.490
Is there?

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:37.310
But Kundalini you can see with your naked
eyes, the pulsation, the rising and the cool

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:40.100
breeze coming out of your head.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.290
That’s what it is.

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:43.340
It’s not dancing: even Rajneesh does that!

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:44.340
He even takes out your clothes!

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.340
All right?

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:50.140
But this Muktanand is a funny fellow I must
say.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:56.580
Horrible fellow he spoils the Kundalini so
badly!

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:58.700
The other day one fellow came, who was with
him for sixteen years, can you imagine?

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.400
He’s good for nothing now!

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.100
How to give him Realisation?

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.880
He’s spent all his money, everything.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.380
He has become so useless.

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:11.720
And then he says now, “Now I feel I am mentally
also good for nothing."

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.970
I sent him to Australia, that fellow.

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:16.970
I am sorry!

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:18.320
I didn’t mean you, I did not mean you.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.150
I sent him to Australia because he was going
to Australia, I said all right, you go and

01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:23.150
see these people.

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:24.150
But a headache, I tell you.

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:25.770
He’s good for nothing, this fellow!

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:30.940
I know his names in his previous lives (Muktanand).

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.670
But very difficult.

01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:33.670
Horrible!

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:41.750
They
not only want to make money: it’s all right,

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:44.650
there are thugs, there are smugglers, all
right, I don’t mind.

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:46.830
But they’ll spoil your chances of Realisation.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:48.320
They are anti-God.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.020
That’s the point is!

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.230
The Kundalini just doesn’t rise in people
who go to Muktanand — rather difficult.

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:57.500
Don’t be frightened, if you have been, I’ll
manage it.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:03.130
It can be worked out.

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:06.910
But when you will meet somebody Muktanandi,
you will know: you will run away from that

01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:08.730
person then, because the hands break!

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:10.290
You get tired.

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:18.420
The Kundalini is tired, poor thing: She hits
her head, this side, that side.

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:23.620
I don’t know what he does: horrible, cruel
man.

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:29.139
One better than the other, this Muktanand.

01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:33.009
Can’t you see on his face?

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:34.259
What does he talk?

01:08:34.259 --> 01:08:35.259
All nonsense!

01:08:35.259 --> 01:08:37.049
Very easy to make out.

01:08:37.049 --> 01:08:41.779
He puts the Kundalini in such a way that the
Void is completely finished!

01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:47.089
The crossing point, that Void, is so much
obstructed that the Kundalini doesn’t get

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:49.710
out of that, it just wobbles there only.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:55.420
Well, we’ll work it out, all right?

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.259
We’ll work it out.

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:03.130
You are seekers, you are seekers.

01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:04.579
You are God’s own people.

01:09:04.579 --> 01:09:05.949
And you are to be saved.

01:09:05.949 --> 01:09:07.469
So let these horrible people delude you.

01:09:07.469 --> 01:09:08.730
How long will they go on?

01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:11.650
All of them have to perish one by one, you
will see that.

01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:17.420
The best part of it [is] that all untruth
fails, ultimately.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:23.179
Seeker: How do you actually tell a true guru?

01:09:23.179 --> 01:09:24.373
Shri Mataji: After Realisation it’s very
easy.

01:09:24.373 --> 01:09:25.373
But you can tell.

01:09:25.373 --> 01:09:31.139
For example, can’t you say who is a sincere
person?

01:09:31.139 --> 01:09:35.359
You can, if you don’t get into the circus.

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:38.420
It’s simple.

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:45.380
But a true guru will not be worried about
your purse, as to how much money you have

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.380
got.

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.529
And he will give you your own powers.

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:53.750
He’ll not try to show off his own powers,
talk about his own powers, “I am this, I

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:55.110
am that,” nothing.

01:09:55.110 --> 01:10:00.590
Unless and until the Kundalini is risen and
you have got Self-realisation, nobody will

01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:04.130
give you false certificate that Kundalini
is awakened.

01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:05.900
It has to manifested.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.670
It’s all falsehood: [from] a to z, it is
false.

01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:13.500
Supposing for example that somebody’s Kundalini
doesn’t rise — all right, it does not

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.500
rise.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.080
My own daughters are not realised-souls, what
can I do about it?

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.909
My own daughters are not realised-souls.

01:10:19.909 --> 01:10:21.949
But my grandchildren are.

01:10:21.949 --> 01:10:23.599
So what can I do?

01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:25.550
I cannot force on them.

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:26.550
If it is not, it is not.

01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:28.789
You cannot give a false certificate.

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:34.409
It has to happen.

01:10:34.409 --> 01:10:41.570
Seeker: Isn’t it hard to combine Christian
and Hindu concepts?

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.810
Shri Mataji: No, no, it is the easiest.

01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:47.010
They are just the same, my child.

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:48.929
They are just the same.

01:10:48.929 --> 01:10:50.739
There is no difference at all.

01:10:50.739 --> 01:10:52.099
They are all one.

01:10:52.099 --> 01:10:56.119
Christ has said, “Those who are not against
me are with me."

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:59.139
Who are they?

01:10:59.139 --> 01:11:01.929
They are all one.

01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:04.120
There is no difference at all.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.210
You’ll find it.

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:11.210
At different stages they came on this Earth
to give us a new dimension, all of them.

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:16.420
Like on a tree, we have different flowers
at different times, but they all come from

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.980
the same source, don’t they?

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.780
Now they pluck the flower, “This is my flower,”
“This is my flower."

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:26.809
That’s not, that’s a dead flower.

01:11:26.809 --> 01:11:30.219
The same energy produces the same flowers.

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:31.960
But they fight.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:40.130
You will be surprised, if I tell you the whole
history of the relationship between them:

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:50.269
between Christ and Krishna, between Mohammed
and Christ, and Krishna, there’s a big relationship.

01:11:50.269 --> 01:11:58.340
They are all related to each other, very closely,
which you’ll find out in Kundalini also.

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:03.090
It’s very interesting how they are related,
now they have played the game.

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:05.329
And they are all settled down within us: all
brothers sisters, husband-wife; all sorts

01:12:05.329 --> 01:12:07.670
of relationship they have.

01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:15.059
It’s very interesting to see, but it is
not only a story but you can see it yourself,

01:12:15.059 --> 01:12:18.040
that they are within you.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:26.809
Say for example if I say that Mohammed Sahib
was the same as Nanak, Guru Nanak.

01:12:26.809 --> 01:12:32.460
Imagine the Sikhs are breaking the neck of
Muslims, and Muslims are breaking the heads

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.199
of the Sikhs.

01:12:34.199 --> 01:12:38.820
It’s a big quarrel going on.

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:46.860
But Nanak came after Mohammed, to teach Muslim-Hindu
unity.

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:50.579
Because he was surprised the way Muslims are.

01:12:50.579 --> 01:12:52.380
But they are one!

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:57.140
They are one personality, born again and again.

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:02.920
Moses, Abraham, Socrates: all of them are
the same.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:10.309
Now if a Muslim is a fanatic, he gets a cancer.

01:13:10.309 --> 01:13:14.489
Normally he should, or he becomes a dry personality.

01:13:14.489 --> 01:13:16.060
Imagine Khomeini.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.360
They become a dry personality.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.270
They can be very violent people.

01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:23.340
But supposing they get into trouble, like
cancer.

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:29.289
I had one Muslim coming from Iran, who was
a fanatic, he got cancer.

01:13:29.289 --> 01:13:33.150
I said, “You think that Mohammed Sahib is
the only person?”

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:34.150
“Yes,” he said.

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.429
“But if I say, Guru Nanak was the same."

01:13:36.429 --> 01:13:37.520
“I can’t believe it."

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.440
I said, “Then I can’t cure you.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:43.010
You have to accept, because Mohammed Sahib
himself is against you, because he came in

01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:44.010
ten forms."

01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:45.699
And he wouldn’t accept it.

01:13:45.699 --> 01:13:49.520
But his wife prevailed upon him because he
was very sick.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.480
And he got cured.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.869
That’s how you have to prove.

01:13:54.869 --> 01:13:56.659
Human beings cannot easily understand.

01:13:56.659 --> 01:14:00.739
You see, if you are born in a Christian religion,
you become a Christian.

01:14:00.739 --> 01:14:03.849
It’s a horrible thing like that!

01:14:03.849 --> 01:14:10.420
You are all human beings, and all this people
have come on this Earth to give you a new

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.420
dimension.

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.969
Only we don’t understand them.

01:14:13.969 --> 01:14:16.230
They never came to make us fanatics.

01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:21.880
That at least ,that is too much to see.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:27.000
After Realisation, you will know that they
are all in complete unison, complete concord,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.190
that’s not possible on human level: absolute
complete concord.

01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:36.050
Yes, it’s a fact!

01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:39.969
All right, should we have Realisation now,
let us try.

01:14:39.969 --> 01:14:46.230
Because I have to go now to London, and tomorrow
is another very heavy day.

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:47.669
Please put your hands.
