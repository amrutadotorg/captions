SHRI GANESHA PUJA
Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:08,276
September 13, 2003

3
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:23,779
Now we are facing little children.

4
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:32,658
They are the ones who are incarnations.

5
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:40,090
They are the ones who are going to lead humanity

6
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:49,254
into some great advancement.

7
00:00:49,454 --> 00:00:55,037
The humanity has to be looked after.

8
00:00:55,453 --> 00:01:01,245
They are tomorrow's humanity. And we are today's.

9
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:08,285
And what are we giving to them for them to follow?

10
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:13,193
What is their aim in life?

11
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:18,262
Very, very difficult to say.

12
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:26,823
But with the Sahaja Yoga they will all go in the proper way.

13
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:30,352
They'll behave in a proper way

14
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:32,887
and the whole thing will be

15
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:39,197
a different mass of Sahaja Yogis coming up.

16
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:45,658
But it is the duty of bigger Sahaja Yogis to look after them;

17
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:48,691
to have better moral standards,

18
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:51,233
to have better lives

19
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:54,544
so that they follow your life

20
00:01:54,744 --> 00:02:01,181
and become genuinely good Sahaja Yogis.

21
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:04,187
It's a very big responsibility. Perhaps

22
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:09,387
we don't recognize it, we don't understand,

23
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:14,696
but all these are little creatures

24
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:25,482
which are after the image of great souls

25
00:02:25,682 --> 00:02:28,716
and they should be brought up in that way,

26
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,124
respected in that manner

27
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:39,390
and loved with great care. This is to be understood.

28
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,676
The problem with our elderly people is this,

29
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:47,919
that we do not consider them

30
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:53,234
to be considered, to be bothered about,

31
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:55,360
to be understood about.

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,482
We think we are too intelligent, too good

33
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:03,142
and we need not waste our energy with them.

34
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:07,024
This is the trouble of the elderly people.

35
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:14,689
But today when we are sitting here to worship Shri Ganesha

36
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:19,171
we should know they are all Incarnations of Shri Ganesha

37
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:23,378
and they should be given proper attention,

38
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:28,069
proper understanding, about themselves.

39
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:35,228
I find certain amount of children who are very well-behaved,

40
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:38,019
which are very sensible,

41
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:44,142
and there are some who have no idea as to what they are doing.

42
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:50,541
So it is the duty of the elders to put ideas into their head,

43
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,887
to proper understanding about themselves

44
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,601
and  the self-respect.

45
00:03:56,801 --> 00:04:03,237
Same thing I would say for the elder Sahaja Yogis

46
00:04:03,437 --> 00:04:07,937
who have to look after their younger brothers and sisters.

47
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:14,210
In this family of ours which we call as Sahaja Yogis

48
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:20,666
there are all kinds of people, all types, all behaviors.

49
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:24,086
Of course they should not be regimented,

50
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:28,141
there should not be uniformity,

51
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:31,923
but in that variety there should be this beauty,

52
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:39,624
there should be beautiful trend of being one with each other.

53
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:42,336
For that what should we do

54
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:44,441
is the problem.

55
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:49,042
What should the elders do to achieve that?

56
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:57,369
What is our solid contribution to their lives?

57
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:08,777
The first will be to tell them who is Shri Ganesha,

58
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:14,881
and that what are the qualities of Ganesha,

59
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,765
what does He represent.

60
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:23,705
What does He represent? What qualities He has.

61
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:26,670
And once they start understanding,

62
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,888
that though being a little boy,

63
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:36,764
He's so generous, He's so kind, He's so forgiving,

64
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:42,193
they'll be amazed because they are also small

65
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:47,834
and they'll also take to that kind of life.

66
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:54,243
I find some children very sensible, very good here.

67
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:56,479
Some are naughty,

68
00:05:56,679 --> 00:06:00,399
and some don't understand what we are doing here.

69
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:05,156
Whatever it is, they are after all children.

70
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:07,419
And what you have to do

71
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:14,165
is to look after them,  respect them, and give them

72
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:19,699
the  full idea about Shri Ganesha.

73
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:28,110
I think everybody must have a statue of Shri Ganesha in your house

74
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,652
so the children will see it and ask,

75
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:33,804
"Who is He? What is He doing?"

76
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:38,025
And you will be amazed  how they will understand Him,

77
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,847
how they will understand His qualities

78
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,879
and how they will work it out.

79
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,754
It is important for all of you

80
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:51,425
to have at least one Shri Ganesha in your house,

81
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,185
so that you can tell your children

82
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:57,807
that "You all have to become like Him."

83
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:02,503
Now what are the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

84
00:07:02,703 --> 00:07:06,774
They won't understand chastity, they are too small.

85
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:10,509
They won't understand all those qualities.

86
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:17,091
But one quality they will understand is to be honest,

87
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,291
is to be honest.

88
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:06,718
Gradually you will find all difficult ones will go down.

89
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,638
It will work out that way.

90
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:15,490
Because you see they don't understand My lecture,

91
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,717
they don't understand what I am saying.

92
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:24,548
But one thing is there.
If there are some oppositions within,

93
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:28,392
they will show - show very well -

94
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,930
because they are so innocent and so simple,

95
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:40,713
their innocence will help them,  to expose them to reality.

96
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:45,574
I hope you all look after your children,

97
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:48,216
guide them properly

98
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:55,015
and take them to a level of understanding

99
00:08:55,215 --> 00:09:01,264
that they understand what is their position,

100
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:04,121
what qualities they should have,

101
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,934
why will they be respected.

102
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:13,677
You'll be amazed, that their behavior will change

103
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:18,157
the behavior of all the other children.

104
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:26,501
What I have to say that nobody should think that

105
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:31,902
because you can keep quiet, sit quietly and all that.

106
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:35,202
You are grown-up only if you can

107
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:39,049
imbibe the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

108
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:43,817
I have seen people who are very grown-up still do not have

109
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:51,398
simple qualities of chastity, of honesty

110
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:55,286
- they don't have, and they can't have,

111
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:58,764
because they don't think it is important.

112
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:06,463
So I leave it to you to find out Shri Ganesha within yourself.

113
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:34,216
I enjoy their company because they're so innocent,

114
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,152
and so simple hearted,

115
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:42,144
and I like them very, very much.

116
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:56,200
So you should not get afraid  or frightened

117
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,291
of their mischief.

118
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:05,142
On the contrary, you should know they deserve much more love,

119
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:12,175
much more understanding and much more scope to grow.

120
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:15,865
I hope by the time they will be of your age,

121
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:18,833
they'll be great Sahaja Yogis.

122
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:22,250
They'll understand what we are doing here.

123
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:29,819
I had to face mountains of nonsense with the older people,

124
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,527
but these won't have that.

125
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:40,650
They'll be very simple  very sweet and they'll understand love.

126
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:46,443
So I would say we can allow these children to go out and play

127
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,746
and somebody can look after them

128
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:52,256
so that you'll be at peace.

129
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,380
Who can take them out?
