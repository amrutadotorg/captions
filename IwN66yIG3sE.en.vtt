00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:10.260
it is very difficult to describe this

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:25.180
inner joy you can only enjoy it you can

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:32.619
only feel it something so you need to

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:37.090
see that so many of you have learnt this

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:47.170
difficult music and all of you have been

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:52.989
enjoying it I went to various places in

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:57.670
the West and I felt that why even small

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:01.770
little children boys and girls take to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.689
something which is self-destructive why

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.729
why do they take to drugs why do they

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.819
take to all these things which are

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.359
self-destructive I mean I could blame

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:14.889
the chip parents to some extent but on

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:20.759
the whole there was something within

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:24.429
them which was troubling them which was

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.020
trying to say that it's not true it's

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:30.279
not the thing it's not the thing that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.240
you want and that's what made them go

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:36.399
into all kinds of various types of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.659
rebellion I should say against all the

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:47.169
accepted truth or accepted goodness or

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:49.240
values and I just thought that of course

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:51.669
in India the parents are rather strict

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.149
ever say right but there's one more

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:59.950
thing in India there's a big outlet for

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:03.939
them and I found that outlet was the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.149
talent that they had they had lots of

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.520
talents all of them I felt when I talked

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.370
to them and this and that I felt that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.600
they have lots of talent but there is no

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.600
way to express it

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:26.860
people have been doing some sort of and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:30.340
haphazard expression right and they

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.690
could not understand themselves why they

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.730
were doing and this was the main thing

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.360
that was lacking I think in the West

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.960
that the children had no way of

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.470
expressing themselves of expressing

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.800
their talent and this talent was making

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:57.160
them mad I think that was making them

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.860
absolutely rebellious it was not their

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.160
mistake by any chance it was an energy

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:09.190
within which was bubbling and had no

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:14.800
outlet and whatever outlet they had was

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:18.310
not recognised was not appreciated and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.410
this made me feel that if these children

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.900
are given an outlet a means of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.210
expressing themselves I am sure they'll

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.650
take to it they'll forget all these

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:35.890
things they'll never take to all

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.810
self-destructive ideas because they were

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:45.570
angry with them I think and it worked it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:51.240
worked in the sense that first I wanted

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:55.750
you to start a school for small children

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:59.590
and I was surprised how this children

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:04.180
took to another kind of lifestyle very

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:08.260
discipline style and if they were very

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.300
different children like in the West I

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.070
found a child supposing you take him to

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:18.609
the shop he'll make you mad because it's

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:22.820
a find me this and buy me that not

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.790
understanding that one cannot afford it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.360
and left to himself I would say that he

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:36.050
would go on dying with the whole of the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.790
market so mad about it but I thought

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.230
that there was some sort of a thing

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.170
that's lacking in him in satisfied on

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:50.900
the contrary in India if you take one

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:55.460
boy or a girl to that market they'll say

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.010
Pass was only one one will do big very

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.340
big problem I add my own granddaughters

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.310
I took them once to Delhi because they

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.200
had broken their Chuck Paulson and they

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.080
had only one pair the parents have work

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.670
to do no problem but one cupful that

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.220
will get broken I said all right you

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:18.560
come along now in Delhi you can get good

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:21.530
ones we'll buy from so they came and I

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.290
bought for them they said nanny at any

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.820
cost will not take the second one we'll

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:31.970
just take one but I said supposing this

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.570
breaks and what we have then you will

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.000
come back again to Delhi to my chapel's

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:42.280
have one spare at least they won't

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.660
listen and they ran away into the car I

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.270
went there I said what are you doing why

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.000
don't you buy chapel's for yourself why

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:54.740
do you want to waste your money nanny

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.950
you can use it for something else now I

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.960
was surprised their way they were so

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.540
satisfied of course they are born

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.790
realized no doubt but also the whole

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:10.630
atmosphere I felt that this atmosphere

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:15.530
if the children from the West can get

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:18.440
they will definitely prosper they'll

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.970
definitely express themselves and

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:27.390
they'll become excellent people but I

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:32.820
know the energy was so much after

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:36.120
my brother your Baba mama I asked him

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.700
why not start an Academy of vision and

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:44.040
when they came to music I was surprised

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:46.680
I was really surprised when we had not

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.920
expected anything from them within three

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.650
months within four months they picked up

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:58.140
such a difficult music style it's

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:02.490
impossible it's impossible for Indians

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.540
to do that they can never do in four

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.530
four months

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:12.260
oh wow I've seen in my own family there

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:16.500
were musicians and my sisters my brother

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:22.130
for hours together every morning is to

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.130
get about five o'clock and start them

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:30.690
every day we asked for 3-4 hours every

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:33.120
day I used to think now when will this

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.330
end I mean after all if somebody has to

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.950
sleep after 5:00 you better stand still

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:42.000
but that's a custom in India to get up

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:45.270
very early in the morning but the way

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.350
these people are learning it so fast it

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:52.650
is because that urge to express

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:58.260
themselves was inside very very strong

00:07:52.650 --> 00:08:01.350
much stronger than Indians just I can

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:05.850
tell you very clearly I have never heard

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:09.150
of anybody learning this difficult music

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:13.200
in three months and four months four

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:16.200
years together they would not show same

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:22.410
about two people how you have started

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:25.200
appreciating it I just don't know I mean

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:33.270
it's a different atmosphere that has

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:35.460
started so full of hope and joy you see

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.990
now there was one fellow who went to

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:43.000
Belgium

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:45.220
he was a Italian Italian sahaja yogi he

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.850
said mother I was surprised there was a

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:51.130
nice program with the Indians and the

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:54.580
Indian consulate had arranged so I went

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:57.040
to the program and they were talking to

00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:01.300
each other and some of them went out

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:03.520
some of them came in these Indians they

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:07.120
never understood that it was Balloon

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.040
Rally when they do guten tag even an

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.100
ordinary pillow rock they cannot

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:16.779
recognize me I was surprised that this

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:21.730
Italian that he what he saying is really

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:26.430
I've seen the Indians when they go for

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:31.920
this kind of a very deep type of music

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.920
after 15 minutes they start slipping out

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:41.350
also they told me that in England they

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:44.100
went to a music centre or we can say for

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:49.570
the buying of the records or something

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:50.260
so all the boys who were there who were

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:55.410
Indians

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:58.209
we're buying pop music that music and

00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.190
they looked at these sahaja Yogi's

00:09:58.209 --> 00:10:05.170
decide you stupid fools why are you

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:07.690
buying this music this Indian music what

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.880
is there in this Indian music this said

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:15.339
is better not to talk to you because you

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:20.200
have gone now you see because some or

00:10:15.339 --> 00:10:23.800
other this is a Sahaj trick I think that

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:27.760
your energies tuned up to a very circuit

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:31.000
and deep understanding of this otherwise

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:33.510
it would never have worked like I mean

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.920
it is the Kundalini of course no doubt

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:42.130
but their way she is nourished you to

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.839
absorb to understand to enjoy this is

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.839
very subtle music

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:51.829
and it has happened more with the

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:56.810
Western people than with the English I'm

00:10:51.829 --> 00:11:00.139
sorry but Indians don't have that much

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.740
of understanding not that much of in

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:03.970
German

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:09.379
Westerners may not injure may not

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:14.810
understand but they enjoy Indians field

00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:19.029
those who are a little bit educated in

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:22.910
music will start finding out faults

00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:27.500
finding out ragas this was not good that

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:32.930
no but not Western Western people are so

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:36.620
humble about it isn't it remarkable how

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:40.639
is it they have picked up so quickly and

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:43.339
ever understood because they have become

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:44.899
subtler this is the only thing I can say

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:47.839
they have become subtler

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:53.779
and their energies are flowing through

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:57.199
the subtler level surprising from Imam

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:57.769
also for me for everyone that in 3-4

00:11:57.199 --> 00:12:04.399
months

00:11:57.769 --> 00:12:09.500
how can you play Malcolm's Rock first

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:15.529
time I heard I how can that be

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:21.050
and that gives such a hope to save this

00:12:15.529 --> 00:12:29.180
music it may be that in India it may be

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:32.750
declining but in the West its rising is

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:36.019
the other way now the Sun rises from the

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:38.930
east and sets on the west here is the

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:41.660
other way round now for music and I

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:48.500
would request all the Indians to develop

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:54.470
that subtle understanding see say if you

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:56.829
are a honeybee only then you can suck in

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.829
Donnie

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:07.700
the Flies cannot so you have to develop

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.339
that sensitivity I would say to Indians

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.240
I'm sorry to say that you have to

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:19.000
develop that sensitivity with anything

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:23.290
which is possible through meditation and

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:27.290
through Kundalini awakening and

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:29.870
balancing and ultimately getting

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:34.130
connected with this all-pervading power

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:37.760
of Satan because sound is the second

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:42.589
state first was of course they said the

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:47.510
word but it was silent came into sound

00:13:42.589 --> 00:13:54.529
and if you can understand the subtle of

00:13:47.510 --> 00:14:01.459
the sound within you if you can get one

00:13:54.529 --> 00:14:05.170
with it it gives you that joy you will

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:11.899
be surprised I have never studied music

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:16.940
never you see I don't know why but

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:21.190
somehow I never study because I could

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.190
not have a guru this is the problem I

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:27.220
couldn't have a guru

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:31.339
so some or other I never studied music

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:37.930
but what I have is the same as you have

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:41.899
now is that subtle enjoyment sense of

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:45.560
music and that's why I say this is

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:48.410
divine of course I also enjoy some pop

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.810
you'll recall so enjoy western music

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:54.920
very much and the Western great composer

00:14:50.810 --> 00:15:01.690
side no doubt but this music has one

00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:01.690
speciality that nothing is written down

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:11.610
there is no composure the musician is

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:16.860
the composer he is the player and he is

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:19.980
the book it's so individualistic if you

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:26.160
see that but today I was happy to see

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:28.860
all of them see this is the western side

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:32.339
of it that so many of them put together

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:40.529
we're singing see like a choir but not

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:42.660
so bad as that in the quiet you see

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:47.730
because I have attended many choirs also

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:50.460
it was too systematic to discipline this

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:53.580
is not here it is complete freedom

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:55.650
within themselves and the whole thing

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.550
worked out so well I mean it's such a

00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:01.920
good combination of both the thing one

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:06.360
side is the music another side is the

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:11.490
collectivity so I have not said a word

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:15.860
about Baba's University or Academy but I

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.860
told him that I'm very proud of

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:32.610
he's very lovingly brought up this

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:38.480
Academy and has that character of our

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:46.079
old guru system which is very important

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:50.579
that keeps the whole place very holy as

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:52.589
you called power and that is working out

00:16:50.579 --> 00:16:54.870
is working very hard I know Baba is

00:16:52.589 --> 00:16:58.160
working very hard and all of you are

00:16:54.870 --> 00:17:01.379
working very hard to help him but this

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:05.030
Academy will definitely I'm sure one day

00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:07.530
we'll give that universal knowledge of

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:19.110
that subtle thing I am telling you about

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:23.850
I know it is late today

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:28.830
and tonight I should say but I'm used to

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:31.799
this more because you see in our when we

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:35.070
were young my father was so fond of

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:36.809
music and with position that so many

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.880
times we have slept at about five

00:17:36.809 --> 00:17:39.679
o'clock in the morning so makes no

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.539
difference to me

00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:45.240
same I find me new people that you are

00:17:42.539 --> 00:17:48.179
the way you are enjoying so we have

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:52.919
great hope of saving our young people

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:59.419
who are going astray people who are

00:17:52.919 --> 00:18:03.750
frustrated people who are unhappy

00:17:59.419 --> 00:18:08.580
because they have no satisfaction people

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:12.120
who are committing suicide in the

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:14.520
affluent countries also in our country

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.990
people who are becoming politicians I

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:22.590
think that's the worst thing that can

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:27.049
happen to it also we have people who are

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:27.049
doing all kinds of criminal things

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:36.430
bring all kinds of violence and

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:42.730
everything all that can be completely

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:46.120
covered with the ocean of music and if

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:50.890
it is done by sahaja Yogi's it would be

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:55.420
such a great emancipation for the whole

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:59.760
world which is absolutely do it is going

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:04.030
to work out so I am thankful to Bob mama

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:08.910
and to all others who are supporting him

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:13.590
in this and I hope you all will enjoy

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:16.450
this music on a very subtle level

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:22.410
because immediately with a mind which

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:27.870
reacts one start discussing arguing

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:32.400
condemning all that's not the way to

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:36.160
understand this music but just to enjoy

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:40.420
enjoyment he hasn't got two sides only

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:45.840
enjoyment signal and that should happen

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:51.930
to you all of you I am so much so much

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.930
overwhelmed really by this beautiful

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:57.940
renderings we have had for example now

00:19:55.270 --> 00:20:00.610
we had from Oregon I mean I can't

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:03.790
believe that you know Rhonda Barr you

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:09.610
could have such beautiful dancing this

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:11.880
mr. Oren's a doctor who this name is

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:15.790
giving or Indaba

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.910
I don't know why it's called on the but

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:23.170
whatever it is it's such a horribly

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:29.590
phonetic man every day he used to kill

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:33.640
so many Hindus and thank God he was a

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:36.670
thin man he was wait in there thread

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:39.250
Jenna you thread how many were healed

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:43.060
you know imagine what a great man he was

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:45.730
and under his name is this or Inaba if

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.530
you have to change any name in this

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:54.610
country it should be or ins a man around

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:57.010
about Annie he had no sense of music he

00:20:54.610 --> 00:21:00.250
never used to listen to music you know

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:04.060
but he was extremely honest that's

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:07.420
another point about honesty and he would

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:14.230
not take any money for his survival from

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:18.460
the state is to stitch toe piece and

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:21.220
sell them then imagine if you had not

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.720
done that and had been a little bit

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.230
loving person would have been much

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:29.230
better but from that around abbath comes

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:33.550
this music and gamble I was amazed I

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:36.070
thought how can it be how did they call

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:43.330
it or Anka bod I don't know but he's the

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:47.310
one who hated music how these people be

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:50.760
born there and what dancing they show

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:53.590
also you have seen the Kuchipudi from

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:59.070
Baba's Institute was another one of us

00:21:53.590 --> 00:22:02.320
just I hope right these are girls from

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:05.680
absolutely from countries where they

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:08.740
have never known always and in such a

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.730
short time to learn such a dance like

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:15.990
Kuchipudi is the most difficult done

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:18.190
very fast my goodness I thought that

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:22.180
what has happened to them

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:27.340
oh you may say mother this is due to

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:29.680
surge whatever it is but sahaja also is

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.590
to be borne by you people

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:37.330
now if you have a very small little

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:38.140
candle how much it can burn but these

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:43.990
are

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:47.020
like the ocean of energies and the way

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:50.320
they are expressing themselves is

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:54.400
remarkable of course I love you very

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:57.070
much and it is not out of that love and

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.610
admiration I am saying this but it's a

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:04.030
fact

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:12.030
is a reality I I had no idea that one

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:12.030
day a will go that and this global

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:21.160
movement is going to work out wonders

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:24.310
you must spread also the music along

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:35.080
with the vibrations I am sure it would

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:38.500
be really or definite I can't believe I

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.750
asked Baha is how how is it is there

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:47.800
only four months time everybody four

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:51.820
months very remarkable then we have one

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:54.480
from Spain I saw him playing Spanish but

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:58.720
Spanish rhythm I don't understand much

00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:01.180
because it goes hectic you know it is

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.780
very fast sometimes very slow but it's

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:09.340
very rhythmic but is hectic ours is very

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:13.540
much I should say discipline whatever it

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:18.430
is he also is played so well so there

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:21.910
are so many examples to show that you

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:23.740
may be from the western country it's

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:30.760
better to be from the western country

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:33.370
now for music and from this I can't

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:36.940
understand why they say it's a miracle

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:40.620
but why should this miracle work in the

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:43.540
West and not in India I don't understand

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.340
though I am sure the Indians are

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.740
enjoying this music no doubt because

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:50.040
they are all sahaja Yogi's but you go to

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:52.230
any program

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.140
any other program where there are very

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:59.940
few sahaja Yogi's you see that the way

00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:02.160
they behave without any discipline the

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:05.600
respect that is paid in India to the

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:11.370
musicians has to be of a very high level

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:15.030
or any talent say even art see also

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:18.630
people who make beautiful things from

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:22.050
their hands all these people who are so

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:24.690
talented are to be respected very much

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:28.860
because it's a special gift God has

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:32.930
given now in India we have got a very

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:39.870
big problem also all great artists but

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:46.080
in - there should say into the influence

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:52.310
of the West and so many of them take

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:58.530
scotch whisky or dizzy - that so many

00:25:52.310 --> 00:26:00.810
and their music is finished you can't

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:06.030
even play cricket with Scotch whisky

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:09.420
live alone music and this Western

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:14.420
influence of taking drinks and things

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:16.650
like that has rained our musicians I

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.410
don't know what's going to happen I was

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:21.780
quite worried that how is it going to be

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:25.080
retained in this country but now I have

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:28.410
great hopes because if they see the

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:33.240
Western people doing so well see four

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:37.700
against this goes into their heads that

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:42.350
how can they do it oh that was very much

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:47.880
where you can see Western people doing

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:51.510
such good music it's very influential so

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:56.100
instead of having any Indian artist on

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:58.500
the stage we should really bring foreign

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:04.679
it will have a great effect I tell you

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:07.080
on English now it was very shameful the

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:10.799
way sometimes Indians behave in a

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:15.210
classical music programs very simple for

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:18.150
anybody they have no sense nothing and

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:22.500
they go on misbehaving they come there

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:29.039
for social social affair I think that's

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:34.020
all on this point the Indians as sahaja

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:39.049
Yogi's are to be responsible and to see

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:46.260
for yourself how much they have achieved

00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:49.980
how much they have understood somebody

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:52.890
who saw them said mother now even in

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:59.429
Indian music if they go ahead of us what

00:27:52.890 --> 00:28:02.700
will happen to us but still we have very

00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:12.150
great musicians as you have our own apt

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:15.080
a before you I must tell you we had a

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:19.590
program in Pune

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:22.080
that's called a shearing and I was very

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:24.360
tired and so I told yogi what's the

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.809
program next one he said some musician

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:32.370
has come he wanted to sing so he has

00:28:27.809 --> 00:28:34.710
come I said which musician I don't know

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:37.730
his name but you see yogi I think was

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:41.820
that time not so much music landed

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:45.990
typical Indians time so what are you go

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:49.559
and sleep so I'd lay down and I heard

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:53.909
his voice and I'm hurting I said who's

00:28:49.559 --> 00:28:58.500
just seeking I came back I to change my

00:28:53.909 --> 00:29:03.080
sari I asked you who is he they told me

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:05.320
the name I said she's a great seeker

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.740
what do you understand

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:11.290
how much are you going to pay he told me

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:19.690
such a meager thing I said are you mad

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:22.960
you'll be then I went out and I heard

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:26.100
this great music I heard his guru also

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.290
before who was also very great that time

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:33.580
and also got it characterized a guru

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:36.280
bandhu both of them but I was surprised

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:40.900
that none of the Indians could

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:44.020
understand him what he was saying this

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:49.720
Maharashtra is known for music for

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:53.590
classical music but surprisingly it's

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:58.510
not that level now that we had seen I am

00:29:53.590 --> 00:30:02.830
happy to see this resurrection of Indian

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:08.730
music through you people that was one of

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:15.070
my greatest desire to get the art

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:17.890
handicrafts and music all kinds of

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:22.600
things which are created through this

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:31.240
talent should prosper and I am very

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:36.309
happy to see that despite so late you

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:40.750
all are still alert and enjoying I can't

00:30:36.309 --> 00:30:43.500
say about other artists who have very

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.610
much impressed you and impressed me so
