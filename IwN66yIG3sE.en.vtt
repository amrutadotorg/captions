00:03.520 --> 00:10.260
it is very difficult to describe this

00:11.760 --> 00:25.180
inner joy you can only enjoy it you can

00:16.750 --> 00:32.619
only feel it something so you need to

00:25.180 --> 00:37.090
see that so many of you have learnt this

00:32.619 --> 00:47.170
difficult music and all of you have been

00:37.090 --> 00:52.989
enjoying it I went to various places in

00:47.170 --> 00:57.670
the West and I felt that why even small

00:52.989 --> 01:01.770
little children boys and girls take to

00:57.670 --> 01:04.689
something which is self-destructive why

01:01.770 --> 01:06.729
why do they take to drugs why do they

01:04.689 --> 01:09.819
take to all these things which are

01:06.729 --> 01:13.359
self-destructive I mean I could blame

01:09.819 --> 01:14.889
the chip parents to some extent but on

01:13.359 --> 01:20.759
the whole there was something within

01:14.889 --> 01:24.429
them which was troubling them which was

01:20.759 --> 01:26.020
trying to say that it's not true it's

01:24.429 --> 01:30.279
not the thing it's not the thing that

01:26.020 --> 01:33.240
you want and that's what made them go

01:30.279 --> 01:36.399
into all kinds of various types of

01:33.240 --> 01:40.659
rebellion I should say against all the

01:36.399 --> 01:47.169
accepted truth or accepted goodness or

01:40.659 --> 01:49.240
values and I just thought that of course

01:47.169 --> 01:51.669
in India the parents are rather strict

01:49.240 --> 01:55.149
ever say right but there's one more

01:51.669 --> 01:59.950
thing in India there's a big outlet for

01:55.149 --> 02:03.939
them and I found that outlet was the

01:59.950 --> 02:07.149
talent that they had they had lots of

02:03.939 --> 02:09.520
talents all of them I felt when I talked

02:07.149 --> 02:12.370
to them and this and that I felt that

02:09.520 --> 02:15.600
they have lots of talent but there is no

02:12.370 --> 02:15.600
way to express it

02:15.840 --> 02:26.860
people have been doing some sort of and

02:21.250 --> 02:30.340
haphazard expression right and they

02:26.860 --> 02:34.690
could not understand themselves why they

02:30.340 --> 02:36.730
were doing and this was the main thing

02:34.690 --> 02:40.360
that was lacking I think in the West

02:36.730 --> 02:43.960
that the children had no way of

02:40.360 --> 02:47.470
expressing themselves of expressing

02:43.960 --> 02:50.800
their talent and this talent was making

02:47.470 --> 02:57.160
them mad I think that was making them

02:50.800 --> 02:59.860
absolutely rebellious it was not their

02:57.160 --> 03:03.160
mistake by any chance it was an energy

02:59.860 --> 03:09.190
within which was bubbling and had no

03:03.160 --> 03:14.800
outlet and whatever outlet they had was

03:09.190 --> 03:18.310
not recognised was not appreciated and

03:14.800 --> 03:22.410
this made me feel that if these children

03:18.310 --> 03:25.900
are given an outlet a means of

03:22.410 --> 03:28.210
expressing themselves I am sure they'll

03:25.900 --> 03:31.650
take to it they'll forget all these

03:28.210 --> 03:35.890
things they'll never take to all

03:31.650 --> 03:40.810
self-destructive ideas because they were

03:35.890 --> 03:45.570
angry with them I think and it worked it

03:40.810 --> 03:51.240
worked in the sense that first I wanted

03:45.570 --> 03:55.750
you to start a school for small children

03:51.240 --> 03:59.590
and I was surprised how this children

03:55.750 --> 04:04.180
took to another kind of lifestyle very

03:59.590 --> 04:08.260
discipline style and if they were very

04:04.180 --> 04:10.300
different children like in the West I

04:08.260 --> 04:15.070
found a child supposing you take him to

04:10.300 --> 04:18.609
the shop he'll make you mad because it's

04:15.070 --> 04:22.820
a find me this and buy me that not

04:18.609 --> 04:25.790
understanding that one cannot afford it

04:22.820 --> 04:29.360
and left to himself I would say that he

04:25.790 --> 04:36.050
would go on dying with the whole of the

04:29.360 --> 04:37.790
market so mad about it but I thought

04:36.050 --> 04:42.230
that there was some sort of a thing

04:37.790 --> 04:45.170
that's lacking in him in satisfied on

04:42.230 --> 04:50.900
the contrary in India if you take one

04:45.170 --> 04:55.460
boy or a girl to that market they'll say

04:50.900 --> 04:58.010
Pass was only one one will do big very

04:55.460 --> 05:01.340
big problem I add my own granddaughters

04:58.010 --> 05:04.310
I took them once to Delhi because they

05:01.340 --> 05:06.200
had broken their Chuck Paulson and they

05:04.310 --> 05:09.080
had only one pair the parents have work

05:06.200 --> 05:10.670
to do no problem but one cupful that

05:09.080 --> 05:13.220
will get broken I said all right you

05:10.670 --> 05:18.560
come along now in Delhi you can get good

05:13.220 --> 05:21.530
ones we'll buy from so they came and I

05:18.560 --> 05:24.290
bought for them they said nanny at any

05:21.530 --> 05:28.820
cost will not take the second one we'll

05:24.290 --> 05:31.970
just take one but I said supposing this

05:28.820 --> 05:34.570
breaks and what we have then you will

05:31.970 --> 05:38.000
come back again to Delhi to my chapel's

05:34.570 --> 05:42.280
have one spare at least they won't

05:38.000 --> 05:44.660
listen and they ran away into the car I

05:42.280 --> 05:47.270
went there I said what are you doing why

05:44.660 --> 05:50.000
don't you buy chapel's for yourself why

05:47.270 --> 05:54.740
do you want to waste your money nanny

05:50.000 --> 05:57.950
you can use it for something else now I

05:54.740 --> 05:59.960
was surprised their way they were so

05:57.950 --> 06:02.540
satisfied of course they are born

05:59.960 --> 06:07.790
realized no doubt but also the whole

06:02.540 --> 06:10.630
atmosphere I felt that this atmosphere

06:07.790 --> 06:15.530
if the children from the West can get

06:10.630 --> 06:18.440
they will definitely prosper they'll

06:15.530 --> 06:22.970
definitely express themselves and

06:18.440 --> 06:27.390
they'll become excellent people but I

06:22.970 --> 06:32.820
know the energy was so much after

06:27.390 --> 06:36.120
my brother your Baba mama I asked him

06:32.820 --> 06:38.700
why not start an Academy of vision and

06:36.120 --> 06:44.040
when they came to music I was surprised

06:38.700 --> 06:46.680
I was really surprised when we had not

06:44.040 --> 06:49.920
expected anything from them within three

06:46.680 --> 06:54.650
months within four months they picked up

06:49.920 --> 06:58.140
such a difficult music style it's

06:54.650 --> 07:02.490
impossible it's impossible for Indians

06:58.140 --> 07:03.540
to do that they can never do in four

07:02.490 --> 07:07.530
four months

07:03.540 --> 07:12.260
oh wow I've seen in my own family there

07:07.530 --> 07:16.500
were musicians and my sisters my brother

07:12.260 --> 07:22.130
for hours together every morning is to

07:16.500 --> 07:22.130
get about five o'clock and start them

07:22.850 --> 07:30.690
every day we asked for 3-4 hours every

07:26.580 --> 07:33.120
day I used to think now when will this

07:30.690 --> 07:35.330
end I mean after all if somebody has to

07:33.120 --> 07:37.950
sleep after 5:00 you better stand still

07:35.330 --> 07:42.000
but that's a custom in India to get up

07:37.950 --> 07:45.270
very early in the morning but the way

07:42.000 --> 07:49.350
these people are learning it so fast it

07:45.270 --> 07:52.650
is because that urge to express

07:49.350 --> 07:58.260
themselves was inside very very strong

07:52.650 --> 08:01.350
much stronger than Indians just I can

07:58.260 --> 08:05.850
tell you very clearly I have never heard

08:01.350 --> 08:09.150
of anybody learning this difficult music

08:05.850 --> 08:13.200
in three months and four months four

08:09.150 --> 08:16.200
years together they would not show same

08:13.200 --> 08:22.410
about two people how you have started

08:16.200 --> 08:25.200
appreciating it I just don't know I mean

08:22.410 --> 08:33.270
it's a different atmosphere that has

08:25.200 --> 08:35.460
started so full of hope and joy you see

08:33.270 --> 08:36.990
now there was one fellow who went to

08:35.460 --> 08:43.000
Belgium

08:36.990 --> 08:45.220
he was a Italian Italian sahaja yogi he

08:43.000 --> 08:48.850
said mother I was surprised there was a

08:45.220 --> 08:51.130
nice program with the Indians and the

08:48.850 --> 08:54.580
Indian consulate had arranged so I went

08:51.130 --> 08:57.040
to the program and they were talking to

08:54.580 --> 09:01.300
each other and some of them went out

08:57.040 --> 09:03.520
some of them came in these Indians they

09:01.300 --> 09:07.120
never understood that it was Balloon

09:03.520 --> 09:09.040
Rally when they do guten tag even an

09:07.120 --> 09:12.100
ordinary pillow rock they cannot

09:09.040 --> 09:16.779
recognize me I was surprised that this

09:12.100 --> 09:21.730
Italian that he what he saying is really

09:16.779 --> 09:26.430
I've seen the Indians when they go for

09:21.730 --> 09:31.920
this kind of a very deep type of music

09:26.430 --> 09:31.920
after 15 minutes they start slipping out

09:32.700 --> 09:41.350
also they told me that in England they

09:38.020 --> 09:44.100
went to a music centre or we can say for

09:41.350 --> 09:49.570
the buying of the records or something

09:44.100 --> 09:50.260
so all the boys who were there who were

09:49.570 --> 09:55.410
Indians

09:50.260 --> 09:58.209
we're buying pop music that music and

09:55.410 --> 10:00.190
they looked at these sahaja Yogi's

09:58.209 --> 10:05.170
decide you stupid fools why are you

10:00.190 --> 10:07.690
buying this music this Indian music what

10:05.170 --> 10:09.880
is there in this Indian music this said

10:07.690 --> 10:15.339
is better not to talk to you because you

10:09.880 --> 10:20.200
have gone now you see because some or

10:15.339 --> 10:23.800
other this is a Sahaj trick I think that

10:20.200 --> 10:27.760
your energies tuned up to a very circuit

10:23.800 --> 10:31.000
and deep understanding of this otherwise

10:27.760 --> 10:33.510
it would never have worked like I mean

10:31.000 --> 10:38.920
it is the Kundalini of course no doubt

10:33.510 --> 10:42.130
but their way she is nourished you to

10:38.920 --> 10:45.839
absorb to understand to enjoy this is

10:42.130 --> 10:45.839
very subtle music

10:45.850 --> 10:51.829
and it has happened more with the

10:48.529 --> 10:56.810
Western people than with the English I'm

10:51.829 --> 11:00.139
sorry but Indians don't have that much

10:56.810 --> 11:00.740
of understanding not that much of in

11:00.139 --> 11:03.970
German

11:00.740 --> 11:09.379
Westerners may not injure may not

11:03.970 --> 11:14.810
understand but they enjoy Indians field

11:09.379 --> 11:19.029
those who are a little bit educated in

11:14.810 --> 11:22.910
music will start finding out faults

11:19.029 --> 11:27.500
finding out ragas this was not good that

11:22.910 --> 11:32.930
no but not Western Western people are so

11:27.500 --> 11:36.620
humble about it isn't it remarkable how

11:32.930 --> 11:40.639
is it they have picked up so quickly and

11:36.620 --> 11:43.339
ever understood because they have become

11:40.639 --> 11:44.899
subtler this is the only thing I can say

11:43.339 --> 11:47.839
they have become subtler

11:44.899 --> 11:53.779
and their energies are flowing through

11:47.839 --> 11:57.199
the subtler level surprising from Imam

11:53.779 --> 11:57.769
also for me for everyone that in 3-4

11:57.199 --> 12:04.399
months

11:57.769 --> 12:09.500
how can you play Malcolm's Rock first

12:04.399 --> 12:15.529
time I heard I how can that be

12:09.500 --> 12:21.050
and that gives such a hope to save this

12:15.529 --> 12:29.180
music it may be that in India it may be

12:21.050 --> 12:32.750
declining but in the West its rising is

12:29.180 --> 12:36.019
the other way now the Sun rises from the

12:32.750 --> 12:38.930
east and sets on the west here is the

12:36.019 --> 12:41.660
other way round now for music and I

12:38.930 --> 12:48.500
would request all the Indians to develop

12:41.660 --> 12:54.470
that subtle understanding see say if you

12:48.500 --> 12:56.829
are a honeybee only then you can suck in

12:54.470 --> 12:56.829
Donnie

12:57.970 --> 13:07.700
the Flies cannot so you have to develop

13:05.000 --> 13:10.339
that sensitivity I would say to Indians

13:07.700 --> 13:13.240
I'm sorry to say that you have to

13:10.339 --> 13:19.000
develop that sensitivity with anything

13:13.240 --> 13:23.290
which is possible through meditation and

13:19.000 --> 13:27.290
through Kundalini awakening and

13:23.290 --> 13:29.870
balancing and ultimately getting

13:27.290 --> 13:34.130
connected with this all-pervading power

13:29.870 --> 13:37.760
of Satan because sound is the second

13:34.130 --> 13:42.589
state first was of course they said the

13:37.760 --> 13:47.510
word but it was silent came into sound

13:42.589 --> 13:54.529
and if you can understand the subtle of

13:47.510 --> 14:01.459
the sound within you if you can get one

13:54.529 --> 14:05.170
with it it gives you that joy you will

14:01.459 --> 14:11.899
be surprised I have never studied music

14:05.170 --> 14:16.940
never you see I don't know why but

14:11.899 --> 14:21.190
somehow I never study because I could

14:16.940 --> 14:21.190
not have a guru this is the problem I

14:22.390 --> 14:27.220
couldn't have a guru

14:23.990 --> 14:31.339
so some or other I never studied music

14:27.220 --> 14:37.930
but what I have is the same as you have

14:31.339 --> 14:41.899
now is that subtle enjoyment sense of

14:37.930 --> 14:45.560
music and that's why I say this is

14:41.899 --> 14:48.410
divine of course I also enjoy some pop

14:45.560 --> 14:50.810
you'll recall so enjoy western music

14:48.410 --> 14:54.920
very much and the Western great composer

14:50.810 --> 15:01.690
side no doubt but this music has one

14:54.920 --> 15:01.690
speciality that nothing is written down

15:02.370 --> 15:11.610
there is no composure the musician is

15:07.140 --> 15:16.860
the composer he is the player and he is

15:11.610 --> 15:19.980
the book it's so individualistic if you

15:16.860 --> 15:26.160
see that but today I was happy to see

15:19.980 --> 15:28.860
all of them see this is the western side

15:26.160 --> 15:32.339
of it that so many of them put together

15:28.860 --> 15:40.529
we're singing see like a choir but not

15:32.339 --> 15:42.660
so bad as that in the quiet you see

15:40.529 --> 15:47.730
because I have attended many choirs also

15:42.660 --> 15:50.460
it was too systematic to discipline this

15:47.730 --> 15:53.580
is not here it is complete freedom

15:50.460 --> 15:55.650
within themselves and the whole thing

15:53.580 --> 15:59.550
worked out so well I mean it's such a

15:55.650 --> 16:01.920
good combination of both the thing one

15:59.550 --> 16:06.360
side is the music another side is the

16:01.920 --> 16:11.490
collectivity so I have not said a word

16:06.360 --> 16:15.860
about Baba's University or Academy but I

16:11.490 --> 16:15.860
told him that I'm very proud of

16:22.399 --> 16:32.610
he's very lovingly brought up this

16:27.319 --> 16:38.480
Academy and has that character of our

16:32.610 --> 16:46.079
old guru system which is very important

16:38.480 --> 16:50.579
that keeps the whole place very holy as

16:46.079 --> 16:52.589
you called power and that is working out

16:50.579 --> 16:54.870
is working very hard I know Baba is

16:52.589 --> 16:58.160
working very hard and all of you are

16:54.870 --> 17:01.379
working very hard to help him but this

16:58.160 --> 17:05.030
Academy will definitely I'm sure one day

17:01.379 --> 17:07.530
we'll give that universal knowledge of

17:05.030 --> 17:19.110
that subtle thing I am telling you about

17:07.530 --> 17:23.850
I know it is late today

17:19.110 --> 17:28.830
and tonight I should say but I'm used to

17:23.850 --> 17:31.799
this more because you see in our when we

17:28.830 --> 17:35.070
were young my father was so fond of

17:31.799 --> 17:36.809
music and with position that so many

17:35.070 --> 17:38.880
times we have slept at about five

17:36.809 --> 17:39.679
o'clock in the morning so makes no

17:38.880 --> 17:42.539
difference to me

17:39.679 --> 17:45.240
same I find me new people that you are

17:42.539 --> 17:48.179
the way you are enjoying so we have

17:45.240 --> 17:52.919
great hope of saving our young people

17:48.179 --> 17:59.419
who are going astray people who are

17:52.919 --> 18:03.750
frustrated people who are unhappy

17:59.419 --> 18:08.580
because they have no satisfaction people

18:03.750 --> 18:12.120
who are committing suicide in the

18:08.580 --> 18:14.520
affluent countries also in our country

18:12.120 --> 18:15.990
people who are becoming politicians I

18:14.520 --> 18:22.590
think that's the worst thing that can

18:15.990 --> 18:27.049
happen to it also we have people who are

18:22.590 --> 18:27.049
doing all kinds of criminal things

18:27.160 --> 18:36.430
bring all kinds of violence and

18:30.130 --> 18:42.730
everything all that can be completely

18:36.430 --> 18:46.120
covered with the ocean of music and if

18:42.730 --> 18:50.890
it is done by sahaja Yogi's it would be

18:46.120 --> 18:55.420
such a great emancipation for the whole

18:50.890 --> 18:59.760
world which is absolutely do it is going

18:55.420 --> 19:04.030
to work out so I am thankful to Bob mama

18:59.760 --> 19:08.910
and to all others who are supporting him

19:04.030 --> 19:13.590
in this and I hope you all will enjoy

19:08.910 --> 19:16.450
this music on a very subtle level

19:13.590 --> 19:22.410
because immediately with a mind which

19:16.450 --> 19:27.870
reacts one start discussing arguing

19:22.410 --> 19:32.400
condemning all that's not the way to

19:27.870 --> 19:36.160
understand this music but just to enjoy

19:32.400 --> 19:40.420
enjoyment he hasn't got two sides only

19:36.160 --> 19:45.840
enjoyment signal and that should happen

19:40.420 --> 19:51.930
to you all of you I am so much so much

19:45.840 --> 19:51.930
overwhelmed really by this beautiful

19:52.110 --> 19:57.940
renderings we have had for example now

19:55.270 --> 20:00.610
we had from Oregon I mean I can't

19:57.940 --> 20:03.790
believe that you know Rhonda Barr you

20:00.610 --> 20:09.610
could have such beautiful dancing this

20:03.790 --> 20:11.880
mr. Oren's a doctor who this name is

20:09.610 --> 20:15.790
giving or Indaba

20:11.880 --> 20:18.910
I don't know why it's called on the but

20:15.790 --> 20:23.170
whatever it is it's such a horribly

20:18.910 --> 20:29.590
phonetic man every day he used to kill

20:23.170 --> 20:33.640
so many Hindus and thank God he was a

20:29.590 --> 20:36.670
thin man he was wait in there thread

20:33.640 --> 20:39.250
Jenna you thread how many were healed

20:36.670 --> 20:43.060
you know imagine what a great man he was

20:39.250 --> 20:45.730
and under his name is this or Inaba if

20:43.060 --> 20:47.530
you have to change any name in this

20:45.730 --> 20:54.610
country it should be or ins a man around

20:47.530 --> 20:57.010
about Annie he had no sense of music he

20:54.610 --> 21:00.250
never used to listen to music you know

20:57.010 --> 21:04.060
but he was extremely honest that's

21:00.250 --> 21:07.420
another point about honesty and he would

21:04.060 --> 21:14.230
not take any money for his survival from

21:07.420 --> 21:18.460
the state is to stitch toe piece and

21:14.230 --> 21:21.220
sell them then imagine if you had not

21:18.460 --> 21:22.720
done that and had been a little bit

21:21.220 --> 21:26.230
loving person would have been much

21:22.720 --> 21:29.230
better but from that around abbath comes

21:26.230 --> 21:33.550
this music and gamble I was amazed I

21:29.230 --> 21:36.070
thought how can it be how did they call

21:33.550 --> 21:43.330
it or Anka bod I don't know but he's the

21:36.070 --> 21:47.310
one who hated music how these people be

21:43.330 --> 21:50.760
born there and what dancing they show

21:47.310 --> 21:53.590
also you have seen the Kuchipudi from

21:50.760 --> 21:59.070
Baba's Institute was another one of us

21:53.590 --> 22:02.320
just I hope right these are girls from

21:59.070 --> 22:05.680
absolutely from countries where they

22:02.320 --> 22:08.740
have never known always and in such a

22:05.680 --> 22:11.730
short time to learn such a dance like

22:08.740 --> 22:15.990
Kuchipudi is the most difficult done

22:11.730 --> 22:18.190
very fast my goodness I thought that

22:15.990 --> 22:22.180
what has happened to them

22:18.190 --> 22:27.340
oh you may say mother this is due to

22:22.180 --> 22:29.680
surge whatever it is but sahaja also is

22:27.340 --> 22:32.590
to be borne by you people

22:29.680 --> 22:37.330
now if you have a very small little

22:32.590 --> 22:38.140
candle how much it can burn but these

22:37.330 --> 22:43.990
are

22:38.140 --> 22:47.020
like the ocean of energies and the way

22:43.990 --> 22:50.320
they are expressing themselves is

22:47.020 --> 22:54.400
remarkable of course I love you very

22:50.320 --> 22:57.070
much and it is not out of that love and

22:54.400 --> 22:57.610
admiration I am saying this but it's a

22:57.070 --> 23:04.030
fact

22:57.610 --> 23:12.030
is a reality I I had no idea that one

23:04.030 --> 23:12.030
day a will go that and this global

23:12.240 --> 23:21.160
movement is going to work out wonders

23:16.920 --> 23:24.310
you must spread also the music along

23:21.160 --> 23:35.080
with the vibrations I am sure it would

23:24.310 --> 23:38.500
be really or definite I can't believe I

23:35.080 --> 23:40.750
asked Baha is how how is it is there

23:38.500 --> 23:47.800
only four months time everybody four

23:40.750 --> 23:51.820
months very remarkable then we have one

23:47.800 --> 23:54.480
from Spain I saw him playing Spanish but

23:51.820 --> 23:58.720
Spanish rhythm I don't understand much

23:54.480 --> 24:01.180
because it goes hectic you know it is

23:58.720 --> 24:04.780
very fast sometimes very slow but it's

24:01.180 --> 24:09.340
very rhythmic but is hectic ours is very

24:04.780 --> 24:13.540
much I should say discipline whatever it

24:09.340 --> 24:18.430
is he also is played so well so there

24:13.540 --> 24:21.910
are so many examples to show that you

24:18.430 --> 24:23.740
may be from the western country it's

24:21.910 --> 24:30.760
better to be from the western country

24:23.740 --> 24:33.370
now for music and from this I can't

24:30.760 --> 24:36.940
understand why they say it's a miracle

24:33.370 --> 24:40.620
but why should this miracle work in the

24:36.940 --> 24:43.540
West and not in India I don't understand

24:40.620 --> 24:45.340
though I am sure the Indians are

24:43.540 --> 24:47.740
enjoying this music no doubt because

24:45.340 --> 24:50.040
they are all sahaja Yogi's but you go to

24:47.740 --> 24:52.230
any program

24:50.040 --> 24:55.140
any other program where there are very

24:52.230 --> 24:59.940
few sahaja Yogi's you see that the way

24:55.140 --> 25:02.160
they behave without any discipline the

24:59.940 --> 25:05.600
respect that is paid in India to the

25:02.160 --> 25:11.370
musicians has to be of a very high level

25:05.600 --> 25:15.030
or any talent say even art see also

25:11.370 --> 25:18.630
people who make beautiful things from

25:15.030 --> 25:22.050
their hands all these people who are so

25:18.630 --> 25:24.690
talented are to be respected very much

25:22.050 --> 25:28.860
because it's a special gift God has

25:24.690 --> 25:32.930
given now in India we have got a very

25:28.860 --> 25:39.870
big problem also all great artists but

25:32.930 --> 25:46.080
in - there should say into the influence

25:39.870 --> 25:52.310
of the West and so many of them take

25:46.080 --> 25:58.530
scotch whisky or dizzy - that so many

25:52.310 --> 26:00.810
and their music is finished you can't

25:58.530 --> 26:06.030
even play cricket with Scotch whisky

26:00.810 --> 26:09.420
live alone music and this Western

26:06.030 --> 26:14.420
influence of taking drinks and things

26:09.420 --> 26:16.650
like that has rained our musicians I

26:14.420 --> 26:19.410
don't know what's going to happen I was

26:16.650 --> 26:21.780
quite worried that how is it going to be

26:19.410 --> 26:25.080
retained in this country but now I have

26:21.780 --> 26:28.410
great hopes because if they see the

26:25.080 --> 26:33.240
Western people doing so well see four

26:28.410 --> 26:37.700
against this goes into their heads that

26:33.240 --> 26:42.350
how can they do it oh that was very much

26:37.700 --> 26:47.880
where you can see Western people doing

26:42.350 --> 26:51.510
such good music it's very influential so

26:47.880 --> 26:56.100
instead of having any Indian artist on

26:51.510 --> 26:58.500
the stage we should really bring foreign

26:56.100 --> 27:04.679
it will have a great effect I tell you

26:58.500 --> 27:07.080
on English now it was very shameful the

27:04.679 --> 27:10.799
way sometimes Indians behave in a

27:07.080 --> 27:15.210
classical music programs very simple for

27:10.799 --> 27:18.150
anybody they have no sense nothing and

27:15.210 --> 27:22.500
they go on misbehaving they come there

27:18.150 --> 27:29.039
for social social affair I think that's

27:22.500 --> 27:34.020
all on this point the Indians as sahaja

27:29.039 --> 27:39.049
Yogi's are to be responsible and to see

27:34.020 --> 27:46.260
for yourself how much they have achieved

27:39.049 --> 27:49.980
how much they have understood somebody

27:46.260 --> 27:52.890
who saw them said mother now even in

27:49.980 --> 27:59.429
Indian music if they go ahead of us what

27:52.890 --> 28:02.700
will happen to us but still we have very

27:59.429 --> 28:12.150
great musicians as you have our own apt

28:02.700 --> 28:15.080
a before you I must tell you we had a

28:12.150 --> 28:19.590
program in Pune

28:15.080 --> 28:22.080
that's called a shearing and I was very

28:19.590 --> 28:24.360
tired and so I told yogi what's the

28:22.080 --> 28:27.809
program next one he said some musician

28:24.360 --> 28:32.370
has come he wanted to sing so he has

28:27.809 --> 28:34.710
come I said which musician I don't know

28:32.370 --> 28:37.730
his name but you see yogi I think was

28:34.710 --> 28:41.820
that time not so much music landed

28:37.730 --> 28:45.990
typical Indians time so what are you go

28:41.820 --> 28:49.559
and sleep so I'd lay down and I heard

28:45.990 --> 28:53.909
his voice and I'm hurting I said who's

28:49.559 --> 28:58.500
just seeking I came back I to change my

28:53.909 --> 29:03.080
sari I asked you who is he they told me

28:58.500 --> 29:05.320
the name I said she's a great seeker

29:03.080 --> 29:08.740
what do you understand

29:05.320 --> 29:11.290
how much are you going to pay he told me

29:08.740 --> 29:19.690
such a meager thing I said are you mad

29:11.290 --> 29:22.960
you'll be then I went out and I heard

29:19.690 --> 29:26.100
this great music I heard his guru also

29:22.960 --> 29:29.290
before who was also very great that time

29:26.100 --> 29:33.580
and also got it characterized a guru

29:29.290 --> 29:36.280
bandhu both of them but I was surprised

29:33.580 --> 29:40.900
that none of the Indians could

29:36.280 --> 29:44.020
understand him what he was saying this

29:40.900 --> 29:49.720
Maharashtra is known for music for

29:44.020 --> 29:53.590
classical music but surprisingly it's

29:49.720 --> 29:58.510
not that level now that we had seen I am

29:53.590 --> 30:02.830
happy to see this resurrection of Indian

29:58.510 --> 30:08.730
music through you people that was one of

30:02.830 --> 30:15.070
my greatest desire to get the art

30:08.730 --> 30:17.890
handicrafts and music all kinds of

30:15.070 --> 30:22.600
things which are created through this

30:17.890 --> 30:31.240
talent should prosper and I am very

30:22.600 --> 30:36.309
happy to see that despite so late you

30:31.240 --> 30:40.750
all are still alert and enjoying I can't

30:36.309 --> 30:43.500
say about other artists who have very

30:40.750 --> 30:45.610
much impressed you and impressed me so

30:43.500 --> 30:50.380
this is a very good chance than

30:45.610 --> 30:56.830
particular where we can have very nice

30:50.380 --> 30:59.190
music beautiful views so enjoyable thank

30:56.830 --> 30:59.370
you very much

30:59.190 --> 31:04.850

30:59.370 --> 31:04.850
[Applause]
