00:10.080 --> 00:12.224
Now, eyes are very important,

00:12.344 --> 00:16.017
and eyes, in a way, are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

00:16.137 --> 00:25.560
because the muscles of the eyes are looked after by Vishuddhi.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.800
Now the kind of muscles we have, which pull our eyes,

00:29.958 --> 00:34.800
which close our eyelids and all that, is very much suggestive.

00:34.920 --> 00:38.729
You must notice that there are some people who come to Me,

00:38.849 --> 00:41.745
their eyes go on like this, when they close their eyes,

00:41.865 --> 00:44.200
they cannot keep it shut.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.998
There are some people, when they open their eyes to Me,

00:47.118 --> 00:50.680
they just keep the eyes open, they just cannot close it.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.485
Both are in trouble.

00:53.605 --> 01:01.317
The ones which are just keeping the eyes open all the time,

01:01.437 --> 01:04.542
are the people having supra-conscious booths.

01:04.662 --> 01:07.201
And those who are flickering their eyes

01:07.321 --> 01:10.256
are having the sub-conscious problem.

01:10.376 --> 01:14.766
Some people have also the habit of

01:14.886 --> 01:17.521
keeping the eyes in an angle all the time,

01:17.641 --> 01:22.346
they never see you straight but in an angle they’ll see you   .

01:23.409 --> 01:26.720
They think it’s sometimes, it’s very fashionable, sometimes.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.320
Ladies think it’s a very good way of looking at people.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.920
And some of them have such eyes that they’ll go on, you know,

01:34.040 --> 01:38.089
looking and pouring their greedy eyes onto others,

01:38.209 --> 01:40.640
or their lusty eyes onto others.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.387
This is the worst thing you can do to your eyes

01:43.507 --> 01:49.188
because such people easily can become blind,

01:50.160 --> 01:53.213
such people might have trouble of the eyes,

01:53.333 --> 01:56.975
specially reddening of the eyes can come to such people,

01:57.095 --> 01:59.335
very much, very quickly.

01:59.469 --> 02:03.662
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes very pure,

02:03.782 --> 02:07.695
the eyes of an Yogeshwara, who was Shri Krishna.

02:07.815 --> 02:09.640
He was a witness.

02:09.760 --> 02:15.896
He was on this earth, He played with Radha.

02:16.016 --> 02:19.742
He married five women, they were the Five Elements.

02:19.862 --> 02:22.566
Sixteen thousand women He married

02:22.686 --> 02:25.040
they were His sixteen thousand Powers.

02:25.160 --> 02:29.128
But He was Yogeshwara, He was Yogeshwara.

02:29.248 --> 02:33.865
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about them at all.

02:33.985 --> 02:37.000
He was beyond that. He was Yogeshwara.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.040
That was the testing point of His,

02:39.160 --> 02:43.800
that He had no lust in His eyes about these women that He had.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.680
Such an Yogeshwara is there.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.320
Of course, I don’t expect you to be Shri Krishna.

02:48.962 --> 02:51.922
But you have your wife,

02:52.042 --> 02:55.782
those who do not have wife must look forward to a wife.

02:55.902 --> 03:00.177
That, “We’ll get wives and we’ll have a wife”

03:00.297 --> 03:03.320
and think of a wife who will be your own,

03:03.440 --> 03:06.398
so that your eyes will not fall onto every woman

03:06.518 --> 03:09.623
who comes across with that kind of a thing.

03:09.743 --> 03:12.918
I have seen people, even the photographs or anything they see,

03:13.038 --> 03:15.568
it’s surprising! I mean there’s nothing in a photograph,

03:15.688 --> 03:16.760
what is in a photograph?

03:16.880 --> 03:19.253
But even a photograph can attract their attention.

03:19.373 --> 03:22.247
I mean, I don’t know what can attract their attention like this

03:22.375 --> 03:26.488
but they are so vulnerable and they have no control over their eyes,

03:26.600 --> 03:27.671
no control.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.120
They become absolutely lost and they have no control.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.800
That shows that they have no powers in them

03:33.920 --> 03:36.921
and they are slaves of their responses.

03:37.041 --> 03:39.680
So the eyes are very, very important.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.040
As Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes“.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.334
There should be no adultery.

03:46.454 --> 03:51.280
Some people have a habit of showing anger with the eyes, you see,

03:51.400 --> 03:54.480
that they show anger they’ll just go on looking like this

03:54.600 --> 03:55.920
and show the anger.

03:56.040 --> 04:00.046
I need, dare not, do that to you but still.

04:01.275 --> 04:07.017
And the angry eyes, you see, are another dangerous things to do,

04:07.137 --> 04:10.600
with your eyes, because then they can become mesmeric.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.300
If you start putting your eyes onto something

04:13.420 --> 04:16.720
and concentrating on it, your eyes might become mesmeric,

04:16.840 --> 04:19.111
means bhoots will start coming out of your eyes.

04:19.231 --> 04:21.287
First of all, you’ll catch bhoots in your eyes,

04:21.407 --> 04:23.400
they’ll settle down there and then

04:23.520 --> 04:27.158
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

04:27.278 --> 04:30.014
It’s a very, very dangerous thing,

04:30.134 --> 04:35.663
to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.

04:35.783 --> 04:40.023
There’s another kind of a stupid thing, or a bhootish thing maybe,

04:40.143 --> 04:43.639
that people ask you to meditate here, it’s absolutely wrong.

04:43.759 --> 04:48.133
In Gita it is written, still it is wrong.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.120
Nobody should put attention here.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.944
If they have to put attention, put attention at the door.

04:55.064 --> 04:57.816
What’s the use of looking at a window?

04:57.936 --> 05:00.527
You can’t get out of it, can you?

05:00.647 --> 05:04.680
If you have to look at anything, be on the lookout for the door.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.625
And the door is here.

05:06.745 --> 05:09.160
The door of Sahasrara is to be opened out,

05:09.280 --> 05:13.932
so you should not try to concentrate on this part.

05:14.190 --> 05:18.079
Many people who have concentrated on this part have become mad.

05:18.199 --> 05:20.013
When they become mad, people say

05:20.133 --> 05:23.207
“He’s a Yogi, but has got unmanitasha”

05:23.327 --> 05:28.385
That he moves like a madcap. How can a Yogi be a madcap?

05:28.505 --> 05:32.825
That means he’s united with God, is He mad?

05:34.605 --> 05:36.826
All such mad people are really mad!

05:36.946 --> 05:39.541
They have nothing to do with God, definitely.

05:39.661 --> 05:42.480
But, there are people who believe in such things

05:42.600 --> 05:46.781
“Oh, he is in love with God, so he just jumps on the stage

05:46.901 --> 05:50.840
and goes into ecstasy, dances like a madcap.”

05:50.960 --> 05:53.983
How can God be mad? First position is this,

05:54.103 --> 05:57.128
that the sanest personality is God.

05:57.248 --> 05:58.680
Has to be.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.624
From where do the sanity comes in?

06:01.744 --> 06:04.846
So, this is one thing one has to understand,

06:04.966 --> 06:07.654
that any such practices

06:07.734 --> 06:11.562
can lead you to lunacy, and one should not do it.
