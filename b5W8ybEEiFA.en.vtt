00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.224
Now, eyes are very important,

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:16.017
and eyes, in a way, are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:25.560
because the muscles of the eyes are looked after by Vishuddhi.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.800
Now the kind of muscles we have, which pull our eyes,

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.800
which close our eyelids and all that, is very much suggestive.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.729
You must notice that there are some people who come to Me,

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:41.745
their eyes go on like this, when they close their eyes,

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:44.200
they cannot keep it shut.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.998
There are some people, when they open their eyes to Me,

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:50.680
they just keep the eyes open, they just cannot close it.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.485
Both are in trouble.

00:00:53.605 --> 00:01:01.317
The ones which are just keeping the eyes open all the time,

00:01:01.437 --> 00:01:04.542
are the people having supra-conscious booths.

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:07.201
And those who are flickering their eyes

00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:10.256
are having the sub-conscious problem.

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:14.766
Some people have also the habit of

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:17.521
keeping the eyes in an angle all the time,

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:22.346
they never see you straight but in an angle they’ll see you   .

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.720
They think it’s sometimes, it’s very fashionable, sometimes.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.320
Ladies think it’s a very good way of looking at people.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.920
And some of them have such eyes that they’ll go on, you know,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.089
looking and pouring their greedy eyes onto others,

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.640
or their lusty eyes onto others.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.387
This is the worst thing you can do to your eyes

00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:49.188
because such people easily can become blind,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.213
such people might have trouble of the eyes,

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.975
specially reddening of the eyes can come to such people,

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.335
very much, very quickly.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.662
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes very pure,

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:07.695
the eyes of an Yogeshwara, who was Shri Krishna.

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:09.640
He was a witness.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.896
He was on this earth, He played with Radha.

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:19.742
He married five women, they were the Five Elements.

00:02:19.862 --> 00:02:22.566
Sixteen thousand women He married

00:02:22.686 --> 00:02:25.040
they were His sixteen thousand Powers.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.128
But He was Yogeshwara, He was Yogeshwara.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:33.865
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about them at all.

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:37.000
He was beyond that. He was Yogeshwara.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.040
That was the testing point of His,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.800
that He had no lust in His eyes about these women that He had.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.680
Such an Yogeshwara is there.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.320
Of course, I don’t expect you to be Shri Krishna.

00:02:48.962 --> 00:02:51.922
But you have your wife,

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:55.782
those who do not have wife must look forward to a wife.

00:02:55.902 --> 00:03:00.177
That, “We’ll get wives and we’ll have a wife”

00:03:00.297 --> 00:03:03.320
and think of a wife who will be your own,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.398
so that your eyes will not fall onto every woman

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.623
who comes across with that kind of a thing.

00:03:09.743 --> 00:03:12.918
I have seen people, even the photographs or anything they see,

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:15.568
it’s surprising! I mean there’s nothing in a photograph,

00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:16.760
what is in a photograph?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.253
But even a photograph can attract their attention.

00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:22.247
I mean, I don’t know what can attract their attention like this

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:26.488
but they are so vulnerable and they have no control over their eyes,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.671
no control.

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.120
They become absolutely lost and they have no control.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.800
That shows that they have no powers in them

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.921
and they are slaves of their responses.

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:39.680
So the eyes are very, very important.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.040
As Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes“.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.334
There should be no adultery.

00:03:46.454 --> 00:03:51.280
Some people have a habit of showing anger with the eyes, you see,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.480
that they show anger they’ll just go on looking like this

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.920
and show the anger.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.046
I need, dare not, do that to you but still.

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:07.017
And the angry eyes, you see, are another dangerous things to do,

00:04:07.137 --> 00:04:10.600
with your eyes, because then they can become mesmeric.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.300
If you start putting your eyes onto something

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.720
and concentrating on it, your eyes might become mesmeric,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.111
means bhoots will start coming out of your eyes.

00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:21.287
First of all, you’ll catch bhoots in your eyes,

00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:23.400
they’ll settle down there and then

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.158
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:30.014
It’s a very, very dangerous thing,

00:04:30.134 --> 00:04:35.663
to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.

00:04:35.783 --> 00:04:40.023
There’s another kind of a stupid thing, or a bhootish thing maybe,

00:04:40.143 --> 00:04:43.639
that people ask you to meditate here, it’s absolutely wrong.

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.133
In Gita it is written, still it is wrong.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.120
Nobody should put attention here.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.944
If they have to put attention, put attention at the door.

00:04:55.064 --> 00:04:57.816
What’s the use of looking at a window?

00:04:57.936 --> 00:05:00.527
You can’t get out of it, can you?

00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:04.680
If you have to look at anything, be on the lookout for the door.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.625
And the door is here.

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:09.160
The door of Sahasrara is to be opened out,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.932
so you should not try to concentrate on this part.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.079
Many people who have concentrated on this part have become mad.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.013
When they become mad, people say

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:23.207
“He’s a Yogi, but has got unmanitasha”

00:05:23.327 --> 00:05:28.385
That he moves like a madcap. How can a Yogi be a madcap?

00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:32.825
That means he’s united with God, is He mad?

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:36.826
All such mad people are really mad!

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:39.541
They have nothing to do with God, definitely.

00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:42.480
But, there are people who believe in such things

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.781
“Oh, he is in love with God, so he just jumps on the stage

00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:50.840
and goes into ecstasy, dances like a madcap.”

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.983
How can God be mad? First position is this,

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:57.128
that the sanest personality is God.

00:05:57.248 --> 00:05:58.680
Has to be.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.624
From where do the sanity comes in?

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:04.846
So, this is one thing one has to understand,

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:07.654
that any such practices

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:11.562
can lead you to lunacy, and one should not do it.
