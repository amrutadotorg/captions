00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
Dear People,

00:10.420 --> 00:17.640
Sahaja Yoga is a New Discovery.

00:20.500 --> 00:31.280
In reality how does the discovery take place for that which is placed, that which is?

00:31.280 --> 00:44.540
Just as Columbus had started a journey to find India, then was India not there?

00:44.540 --> 00:50.060
If it was not there then what would he be finding?

00:50.060 --> 00:55.520
Sahaja has been there from before.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.460
It has been found out only now.

00:59.460 --> 01:08.900
Sahaja Yoga is the own way of the Supreme Essence.

01:08.900 --> 01:15.820
This is the way of the natures own method.

01:15.840 --> 01:19.820
This is the only way,

01:19.860 --> 01:35.000
where mankind can through evolution be taken to that dimension,

01:35.000 --> 01:43.700
by which mankind can be acquainted with that consciousness, can be absorbed with that consciousness,

01:43.740 --> 02:02.000
by the support of which this entire creation and the heart of man is moving.

02:11.300 --> 02:16.820
Much has been written about this.

02:16.820 --> 02:20.860
From ancient times the seeking for it has been going on.

02:20.860 --> 02:24.280
Man is seeking something all the time;

02:24.280 --> 02:27.160
whether he is seeking after money,

02:27.160 --> 02:29.740
or whether he is seeking after power,

02:29.740 --> 02:32.200
or he seeks after love;

02:32.200 --> 02:37.060
he is running after one or another seeking.

02:37.060 --> 02:41.860
But what is the thirst behind that seeking,

02:41.860 --> 02:45.220
he perhaps does not know.

02:45.220 --> 02:50.300
Behind this is only the seeking after Bliss.

02:50.300 --> 02:55.800
In his search after happiness he thinks,

02:57.120 --> 03:05.860
that if he collects a lot of wealth he can be happy.

03:05.980 --> 03:10.960
But there are many countries

03:10.960 --> 03:21.160
that have attained and gained a lot of wealth and are extremely unhappy.

03:21.160 --> 03:25.540
Thousands are killing themselves.

03:29.240 --> 03:37.460
Behind all this seeking is the thirst for Joy which is dragging you towards this unknown .

03:37.560 --> 03:44.740
When man after seeking everywhere can find no happiness then he turns towards Dharma.

03:44.820 --> 03:50.080
And even when he turns towards Dharma he is seeking outside.

03:50.080 --> 03:54.780
The reason for this is that what he himself is he has lost.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.820
He is ignorant

03:56.980 --> 03:59.740
and that is why man runs from himself.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.960
Each moment he is running from himself.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.520
He cannot sit with himself for even two minutes.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.840
If he is told to sit with himself for two minutes,

04:06.840 --> 04:10.280
he says ‘O God what punishment is this for me’.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.220
What we call boredom nowadays.

04:13.220 --> 04:17.060
Why is man so fed up of himself?

04:17.060 --> 04:22.600
Why is man running away so fast from himself?

04:23.340 --> 04:26.640
Because he is ignorant about his own self.

04:26.640 --> 04:31.280
He is ignorant about his own beauty, his own knowledge,

04:31.280 --> 04:36.880
his own glory, his own love

04:36.880 --> 04:41.200
and is running outwards in the search of happiness.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.340
Joy is not outside. It is within.

04:45.380 --> 04:49.020
It is within you.

04:49.020 --> 04:53.120
People say you are in the form of God.

04:53.140 --> 04:57.180
Just by talking about it, it is not going to happen.

04:57.180 --> 05:02.600
In Marathi they say,” Bolachach bhat bolachich kadhi” (Only making promises but not fulfilling them).

05:02.660 --> 05:07.920
Whether I say that you seek the Formless or Formed, but these are only words.

05:07.920 --> 05:14.100
Thousands of discussions have been done, crores of books have been written,

05:14.160 --> 05:20.800
how many lives were destroyed, but there is no end to a man’s thinking.

05:28.300 --> 05:36.120
Whatever man thinks with his mind, he does so in the limitations of the mind.

05:36.120 --> 05:41.380
That which is beyond the mind and cannot be understood by the mind….

05:41.380 --> 05:53.760
Even this lecture of mine is only a talk, and by this talk you cannot know that Divine.

05:56.040 --> 06:01.600
Whatever I go on talking it will all become like a weight on your mind.

06:01.600 --> 06:06.640
If I say that keep a weight then that too will become a weight.

06:06.640 --> 06:13.020
God has created such an arrangement that whatever we do with our mind will become heavy like a weight.

06:13.020 --> 06:20.420
And being trapped under that weight we cannot fly where we have to go.

06:20.420 --> 06:26.160
That is why seeking has always remained incomplete.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.060
But now I am going to tell you about the New Creation.

06:30.060 --> 06:38.460
Not only a talk, but also its discovery which has been found out.

06:38.520 --> 06:54.000
In the path of revolution such has been happening, that any person who goes into the expertise of anything he sinks, and finishes off.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.860
In the same way it is happening to humans.

06:56.860 --> 07:12.820
There is so much competition and opposition going on, that man has made his brain so specialist that his brain is bursting.

07:12.820 --> 07:19.260
Now a new type of man is needed that can know this Power beyond the mind.

07:19.260 --> 07:26.800
This power which moves this mind also makes the heart beat.

07:26.800 --> 07:40.000
To know that Power you can talk all you want, or try all you want, you cannot reach there.

07:41.340 --> 07:44.580
This is without any doubt.

07:44.580 --> 07:47.980
It is not written anywhere about which I am talking.

07:47.980 --> 07:51.880
I am not saying anything very special.

07:51.880 --> 07:56.040
You can read Nanaka, Kabirdas,

07:56.040 --> 07:58.580
you read Vaishista,

07:58.580 --> 08:03.060
read about the guru of gurus, Janaka.

08:03.080 --> 08:11.440
Not only in our country but also in the foreign countries they have been writing like this for thousands of years.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.280
They have all been writing about which I am talking.

08:14.280 --> 08:19.740
“What you have to get is unexpectedly within.”

08:20.360 --> 08:23.700
But those poor things just kept saying.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.700
Maybe because they could not search it.

08:26.700 --> 08:32.440
If they were not able to find out about it, it does not mean that they were any less.

08:32.440 --> 08:38.860
If Columbus was not able to find India it does not mean that he was any less.

08:38.900 --> 08:47.120
And later those people who found it, they did not do it to belittle the ones who could not.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.500
This is not a collective search.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.100
You all think separately,

08:52.100 --> 08:58.460
so the thought comes to many that Mataji is talking something different. No.

08:58.460 --> 09:03.760
I am telling you about all the searching of all the searches.

09:03.760 --> 09:12.260
Until now man has born tremendous hardships to put their attention on this.

09:12.260 --> 09:18.640
Take the psychologists, biologists and the big scientists.

09:18.640 --> 09:36.520
Many of them and even the realized souls got it to a certain extent but were not able to give.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.160
The reason is time.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.700
For God, time is timeless.

09:42.700 --> 09:46.820
We are the ones who think that some are left behind and some have moved forward.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.900
The ones who have died are great.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.040
Who has died, I want to ask?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.100
Nobody dies.

09:53.180 --> 09:59.480
All those who die sit in the other world and then come back here, and then go back to the other world and come back again.

09:59.540 --> 10:08.140
From the animals some become humans, but mostly people go to the other world and back again to this world.

10:08.180 --> 10:10.380
It is only a coming and going.

10:10.380 --> 10:13.320
No one dies.

10:13.320 --> 10:29.640
So it can happen that from some of you who are sitting here, are also because of your seeking from many life times and you can get it.

10:29.640 --> 10:34.380
If you can get it then why should there be such a discussion about it.

10:34.380 --> 10:44.360
It is such an ordinary thing and I find it really odd. It is really odd that people make an issue about everything.

10:44.380 --> 10:49.840
A mother is giving you food to eat but by making an argument about it how will it happen?

10:49.840 --> 10:53.680
It is not an argument.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.000
This is the Truth. This is the Truth.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.400
It is a very great seeking.

11:05.220 --> 11:12.660
The ones who are realized who are sitting here, understand it.

11:12.660 --> 11:17.760
In the search for Dharma man has only been able to reach the other world.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.500
Till now he has not reached the Supreme.

11:20.500 --> 11:24.240
And the ones who did reach the Eternal were unable to bring down the Supreme.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.080
This is very important for others.

11:27.080 --> 11:31.500
Because just as you have had many rebirths so do I have many births.

11:31.500 --> 11:36.440
And I too have had a very close relationship with all these great seekers.

11:36.440 --> 11:41.140
And these are so near to me and mine. Perhaps they are not so near to you.

11:41.160 --> 11:47.340
All those who carry big flags, that we are Muslims or Hindus,

11:47.400 --> 11:54.420
or this or that, only carry a false certificate and have no guarantee that in their past lives

11:54.420 --> 12:01.220
the one who was a Hindu was a Muslim and the one who was a Muslim might have been a Christian.

12:03.000 --> 12:12.640
Now if it is a question of births and rebirths, a question of joy, then one should think on that level.

12:16.540 --> 12:23.260
That level is such that whatever is Eternal is not gross.

12:23.260 --> 12:28.080
Whatever is the Eternal Essence is not gross.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.640
That which is sucking is not growth.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.460
That which is subtle is not gross.

12:35.460 --> 12:39.580
Please understand this properly.

12:40.380 --> 12:50.240
It can be enlightened in the gross but the Eternal is not interested in the gross.

12:54.220 --> 13:05.380
Like many people tell me that many sadhus and saints ask God for something and God gives it to them.

13:05.440 --> 13:10.420
But God has not given it, this much I can say.

13:10.480 --> 13:24.420
God is not interested that how many children you have, that you get lands, houses, and the world’s pleasures and leisure.

13:24.460 --> 13:27.820
God is not interested in this at all.

13:27.820 --> 13:32.180
We have made a big mistake in understanding God.

13:32.180 --> 13:39.740
The Eternal Essence is only interested in giving the Eternal, please remember and write this down.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.720
And people talk also that this Eternal or Supreme Essence is only got through the Kundalini yoga.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.860
Many wrote about this too.

13:51.860 --> 13:59.800
But with Kundalini Yoga you get only Siddhis (Spiritual Powers), has never been written anywhere.

13:59.800 --> 14:09.820
Yes, but those who have got the powers have never written that the powers should come through the Kundalini.

14:09.820 --> 14:11.960
Kundalini is your mother.

14:11.960 --> 14:18.220
She is sitting inside you to give you your second birth.

14:18.220 --> 14:21.640
She is only going to give you your second birth.

14:21.660 --> 14:28.100
She is not the foolish mother who will give you powers and throw you into the other world.

14:28.100 --> 14:39.440
The amount of understanding you have, She is many times more wise, and more loving.

14:41.520 --> 14:45.840
She is not going to push you into a wrong place.

14:45.840 --> 14:52.840
She is not the evil mother who will push you into Untruth.

14:52.840 --> 15:03.900
Till such time as with the Union of the Kundalini one does not get the recognition, till then the Kundalini is not a union Yoga, and that is what Sahaja Yoga is.

15:04.020 --> 15:13.360
And God has made such a beautiful arrangement of this within us, is a point to understand.

15:13.360 --> 15:20.920
When a child comes into the body of the mother then with the gross elements his mind, brain, attention, ego is all made.

15:20.980 --> 15:34.060
But when the light comes in, it descends from the fontanel bone area in our

15:39.120 --> 15:45.840
brain which is shaped like a prism,

15:45.840 --> 15:52.300
through this very area the energy (Shakti) gets divided into three parts.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.700
God has done this so cleverly.

15:55.700 --> 16:00.840
If someone is a doctor here he can understand.

16:01.220 --> 16:06.820
We call this the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.

16:06.820 --> 16:17.520
In our bodies are there two (Shaktis) energies present about which we know very little, and about which we find it very difficult to find out

16:17.520 --> 16:21.380
specially about the para-sympathetic nervous system.

16:21.380 --> 16:29.740
In our Hindu Yoga Science these are called as Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.

16:29.740 --> 16:47.020
Ida and Pingala are the subtle of the sympathetic nervous systems in our body, means that the gross (jad) of these two is the sympathetic nervous system.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.820
Think about it like this that

16:51.820 --> 17:01.560
God fills the petrol from the top of our head in us, and when filling the petrol a descent happens

17:01.560 --> 17:18.480
that the rays which pass through the prism and then deflect, and then it goes down and makes two Nadis called as Ida and Pingala.

17:18.480 --> 17:28.140
And the one which is at the top of the head descends down the center and becomes your Kundalini

17:28.140 --> 17:37.260
and goes into the triangular bone at the base of the spine and settles in there.

17:37.260 --> 17:52.900
One thing is proved that our Kundalini is sitting in such a place which has no connection with sex.

17:54.920 --> 18:01.960
If you read books they say that by awakening the Kundalini such and such happens.

18:01.960 --> 18:14.320
But the ones who raise the Kundalini, who I have met and known, they all take you into the sympathetic and do not raise it through the Sushumna.

18:14.360 --> 18:23.960
If anyone is a doctor here will understand that parasympathetic nervous is the Sushumna which is in the center,

18:23.960 --> 18:32.180
and recognition of it is that when the Kundalini rises then the eyes dilate.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.280
This is an outward recognition.

18:35.280 --> 18:44.720
Ask any doctor that when the parasympathetic nervous system is activated, then the eyes dilate.

18:44.760 --> 18:50.380
And we can show you outwardly if your eyes are open to see,

18:50.380 --> 18:56.320
because one has to give a proof about each and everything otherwise you can’t understand.

18:56.320 --> 19:10.220
There is a proof of this that which you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini at full strength at the base of the spine.

19:10.300 --> 19:14.860
You know that there is no pulsation at the base of the spine.

19:14.860 --> 19:21.440
We can show you that there is a pulsation at the base of the spine

19:21.440 --> 19:29.640
and slowly this pulsation rises upwards, and with this at some places it pulsates more.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.780
These are our centers.

19:32.780 --> 19:41.460
You can be shown this and you can see its movement.

19:43.060 --> 19:49.320
When the Kundalini will rise through the Sushumna only then can you get realization.

19:49.340 --> 20:00.600
But for this, one does not know why a very strong condition has been put by God.

20:03.660 --> 20:09.580
There is a very great stoppage here which you will have to give.

20:09.580 --> 20:14.540
It is this that when the Kundalini will come on Sushumna

20:14.540 --> 20:19.780
only then God’s Infinite Love will come into that man.

20:19.780 --> 20:27.560
Till that Love does not come down into man the Kundalini will not rise, no matter what you do.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.600
She can be annoyed or angry,

20:30.600 --> 20:38.600
but she will never rise till the Infinite Love will come into Sushumna

20:38.600 --> 20:41.740
where a special place has been made.

20:41.740 --> 20:48.740
This place is made between our Nabhi chakra and Anahata Chakra.

20:48.820 --> 20:58.620
Till this Love does not come down till then the flow from the Sushumna will not rise.

20:58.620 --> 21:08.140
For example there are two ladders, and in the middle is another ladder

21:08.140 --> 21:20.400
and there is a gap between us and that ladder, and you are not able to cross this gap in any way.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.800
There is no bridge by which you can cross it.

21:23.800 --> 21:30.260
The two stairs Ida and Pingala are down at the level of the ground,

21:30.260 --> 21:36.000
which is the left and right of the sympathetic nervous systems.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.400
The central stair is hanging in the middle which will take you to the Supreme.

21:44.400 --> 21:53.220
If there is any psychologist he can understand about the two stairs of the sympathetic systems.

21:53.220 --> 22:13.700
The one on the left side takes you to your ego.

22:16.600 --> 22:28.720
And the one that is on the right hand side takes you to the super ego.

22:32.200 --> 22:45.580
These two together spread onto our forehead, like a balloon and then they join together at the top of the head.

22:45.620 --> 22:49.240
Sometimes they come and spread onto the whole head.

22:49.240 --> 22:53.280
Sometimes the super-ego is very strong and sometimes the ego.

22:53.380 --> 22:57.320
The one that is stronger is spread on our brain.

22:57.320 --> 23:04.060
They then close the path of the middle ladder.

23:06.180 --> 23:16.060
Now the petrol which had been made by the parasympathetic system, and filled with the Kundalini, its path and flow has stopped.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.940
Now we are separate.

23:18.940 --> 23:22.780
Now we have become the Self and we feel that we are an individual.

23:22.840 --> 23:28.460
Now the ego started, that We Are.

23:28.480 --> 23:38.300
Now this is the reason for running away from ourselves, because we do not know ourselves who we are.

23:38.300 --> 23:41.620
You are listening to me by putting your attention towards me

23:41.660 --> 23:44.380
but I cannot put my attention on you.

23:44.380 --> 23:56.160
If I say put your attention on yourself then you cannot do that because you have been cut off from that source which you are.

23:57.760 --> 24:10.480
One which is the super ego, a lot of weight keeps accumulating.

24:11.760 --> 24:23.000
Every type of weight; a weight in which we are taught, do this, don’t do that, don’t go here, don’t eat this or that.

24:23.000 --> 24:30.660
or we give big lectures to people that you must be an Indian, or Japanese.

24:30.720 --> 24:36.340
or you must hate so and so, or we are Hindus , Muslims or Christians,

24:36.340 --> 24:43.800
by all these, what we call, conditionings or weight the super ego gets weighed down.

24:43.900 --> 24:49.620
And that which is the ego says we are so and so, we should do this.

24:49.620 --> 24:58.620
The one that says "Don’t Do" is the super ego and the one that says "Do is" the ego.

24:58.760 --> 25:05.560
In reality neither do we not do or do. The Doer is someone else.

25:05.620 --> 25:08.460
It is a useless thinking.

25:11.980 --> 25:17.280
The One who is Doer does what has to be done and will do.

25:17.280 --> 25:21.480
But this grossness is within us that

25:21.480 --> 25:34.180
we use that petrol, by our Ida and Pingala and we condition ourselves with that and put it under a weight. In the center is the Sushumna Nadi.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.720
In the center is the Sushumna Nadi.

25:36.780 --> 25:42.080
Now many people have said to me that "Mataji you talk against this one or that one".

25:42.080 --> 25:45.040
I am not talking against anyone.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.320
but you have climbed the wrong ladder; I will have to make you come down that.

25:48.320 --> 25:52.540
Because I have to make you climb the middle ladder.

25:52.540 --> 25:56.280
So whom am I opposing I don’t understand?

25:56.280 --> 25:59.840
What am I going to gain by opposing anyone?

25:59.840 --> 26:04.160
I am just telling you that you have climbed the wrong ladder, and all will come down.

26:04.260 --> 26:09.660
I go to meet the big and great Gurus and talk to them that what are you doing?

26:09.660 --> 26:12.820
By doing all this you cannot get God.

26:12.820 --> 26:17.820
You must understand by doing all this you will not get God.

26:17.820 --> 26:27.620
What I am saying? Read Vaishista, or Adi Shankaracharya, because it is a historical thing.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.520
They have said the same thing

26:29.540 --> 26:34.900
that you get to God you cannot do anything.

26:34.900 --> 26:47.820
But there is a slight difference between them and me that they had said that are very few who have the authority to get to God.

26:47.820 --> 26:54.840
Some should remain in bhakti and others should do some yogas so that they can keep their discipline.

26:54.840 --> 27:06.860
But they also said that a disciplined mind or a mind that is running after indulgences, both minds are useless for ascent.

27:06.920 --> 27:16.060
One has to have a mind like a small child which is without sin, and is innocent.

27:16.060 --> 27:19.160
Such a one has the right to attain God.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.820
This is what they have clearly said.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.140
But who reads them?

27:24.140 --> 27:34.820
The question is that we read a lot and we read about those who know nothing about Dharma.

27:34.840 --> 27:39.460
and even if they know it is just a little bit.

27:39.520 --> 27:47.060
The ones who think they are very great Hindus they must first read Adi Shankaracharya.

27:47.060 --> 27:50.660
Adi Shankaracharya had established the Hindu Dharma.

27:50.660 --> 27:53.320
Then why not read Adi Shankaracharya?

27:53.320 --> 27:59.260
You read all the books of the world, but why don’t you read him and know him?

27:59.260 --> 28:04.420
The difference between what he said and I say is that he said that in crores

28:04.420 --> 28:09.020
there are just one or two and I say in crores there are lakhs.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.440
This is not of a question of being hopeful but a question of time.

28:12.460 --> 28:13.880
The time will come.

28:13.880 --> 28:19.660
The time of Kalyuga is a time of a very terrific battle.

28:19.660 --> 28:22.820
It is a time of total darkness.

28:22.820 --> 28:26.100
You don’t know this as you are seeing me.

28:26.100 --> 28:36.660
Besides yourself you are not being able to see anything else, but those who are realized know that what a pledge has been tied.

28:36.660 --> 28:40.140
Negativite and positive forces are both tying their force.

28:40.140 --> 28:43.220
There is the full force of sympathetic and Parasympathetic.

28:43.220 --> 28:47.000
The sympathetic is sucking away the Parasympathetic.

28:47.000 --> 28:57.060
But no matter how much the sympathetic sucks it out; if that Parasympathetic becomes one with that Ananda then this will go on filling it up.

28:57.060 --> 29:03.780
You can go on using up the petrol but if that petrol is connected to the petrol pump and what is there to be afraid of?

29:03.780 --> 29:07.060
This is all due to the sympathetic.

29:07.100 --> 29:22.920
The active consciousness side of the sympathetic, from where you do all your work, from where you spend your energy if that is over spent then a disease like cancer sets in.

29:22.920 --> 29:29.420
and if the Superego is over used then madness comes in.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.860
I do not cure people’s diseases.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.940
To say that I cure people’s diseases is a wrong concept.

29:35.940 --> 29:40.980
Because the parasympathetic system cools down the sympathetic system

29:40.980 --> 29:45.560
by which a person gets cured.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.840
If there is some madness then that too will get cured.

29:48.840 --> 29:58.300
and if within you a disease like cancer sets in, due to over activity that too will get cured

29:58.300 --> 30:05.140
The cure for cancer is only Sahaja Yoga

29:59.980 --> 30:06.980
and there is no other cure in the world for it. This point will be proved.

30:07.020 --> 30:14.340
I know that this will be proved with time that many have been cured of cancer.

30:14.340 --> 30:20.420
The people who are sitting here can also tell you.

30:20.420 --> 30:24.140
One point I have been making from the beginning is

30:24.160 --> 30:26.420
that where is our attention?

30:26.420 --> 30:33.920
Is our attention on that cancer which is destroying our body which is gross or is our attention on the consciousness (Chaitanya)?

30:33.920 --> 30:37.120
Then we should think about consciousness.

30:37.120 --> 30:45.020
Till we do not keep our attention on Consciousness then the gross ( material) will also trouble us.

30:45.020 --> 30:50.440
The whole work is by consciousness ; grossness (material) has no work in this.

30:50.440 --> 31:01.140
We have got so used to the gross and material that man gets stuck on to little, little gross topics.

31:01.140 --> 31:09.280
One person used to come who got realization and started giving it to others quite well.

31:09.280 --> 31:13.940
But realization doesn’t mean that you got busy.

31:13.940 --> 31:17.700
You are reborn and you have become like a child again.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.280
Now you have to grow further.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.100
But the attention is on

31:22.100 --> 31:24.920
“My son should get alright,

31:24.920 --> 31:27.520
my children should become alright,

31:27.520 --> 31:30.200
my husband should get alright.”

31:30.200 --> 31:33.340
Then after some time “My money problems should become alright.”

31:33.340 --> 31:35.240
Where is the attention?

31:35.240 --> 31:40.160
You have become realized but the attention is exactly where you left it.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.820
The one who has kept his attention on consciousness/Chaitanya such a person has risen very high.

31:43.820 --> 31:47.580
Sitting among you, are people who are very high.

31:47.580 --> 31:52.040
They are like the gods and worthy of reverence.

31:52.040 --> 31:56.620
These people should be called gods who have been reborn.

31:56.620 --> 32:00.520
There is no need to fight with people who talk useless things.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.780
Those who want to come should come

32:02.780 --> 32:05.860
and those who don’t want to come should not come.

32:05.860 --> 32:13.040
There is no time left to argue and have discussions with them, because such people will go on discussing and arguing.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.940
As Adi Shankaracharya has said

32:15.940 --> 32:21.140
that low level people should keep their minds disciplined

32:21.140 --> 32:25.700
and somehow live properly and protect themselves from becoming thieves etc.

32:25.700 --> 32:29.920
They should live like good citizens.

32:29.920 --> 32:39.620
But the ones who have their attention on the Supreme, will not be satisfied with such things.

32:39.620 --> 32:45.080
Till you have not attained the Supreme you should not have any belief in me too.

32:45.080 --> 32:48.240
There is no need of pretence.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.740
Whatever anyone tells you, you should not believe it,

32:51.740 --> 32:54.880
but first get it within yourself,

32:54.880 --> 32:59.360
then only have belief in me.

32:59.360 --> 33:06.800
I am not here to open a shop or earn money or make a name for myself.

33:06.800 --> 33:11.920
I am here only to transform human beings.

33:11.920 --> 33:17.520
If not in this birth then I will see in the next life. I am used to living in the Eternal.

33:17.520 --> 33:24.200
But one should now think that the ones who have died, have died.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.160
Don’t take their topics and repeat them.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.900
Put your attention on yourself.

33:28.900 --> 33:32.980
Maybe it might be that one of them is you who had written about it in your past lives.

33:32.980 --> 33:35.620
Can be that you are the very great people

33:35.620 --> 33:41.120
who had written and have been reborn and come here today to take get your right.

33:41.120 --> 33:46.500
What has happened is gone.

33:49.040 --> 33:54.960
In Sahaja a seeker has to do nothing.

33:54.960 --> 34:00.820
The one who is drowning in the water, if he does nothing it is better.

34:00.820 --> 34:05.060
But he saves the others who are drowning.

34:05.060 --> 34:08.160
This is an easy way to explain Sahaja Yoga.

34:08.160 --> 34:18.740
Those who are in their source, those who have got their realization, those who have become one with their Shakti/ Power, they will do everything.

34:18.740 --> 34:23.100
The rest who have not realization should sit peacefully.

34:23.100 --> 34:26.720
They will come onto your source/sutra and give you love.

34:26.720 --> 34:33.380
They will come onto your source/sutra and heal your chakras because you do not know your chakras as yet.

34:33.380 --> 34:37.100
When you get your realization then you will understand what I am saying,

34:37.100 --> 34:41.460
that yes, here is this chakra, it is moving, that chakra is moving like that in another.

34:41.470 --> 34:49.210
Then only will you understand what is the collective consciousness.

34:49.200 --> 34:53.760
The ones who keep no, no right from the beginning, this is not the place for them

34:53.760 --> 34:57.300
and neither is there any arrangement for them.

34:57.300 --> 35:03.720
But such people no matter how conditioned they are,

35:03.720 --> 35:08.940
but who want that a transformation should come within them,

35:08.940 --> 35:14.700
such are dear to me and I have full faith that they will get it

35:14.700 --> 35:20.960
in this lifetime, despite what the conditioning is and despite how their Kundalini has been played around with.

35:20.960 --> 35:30.560
If I say that someone’s life is getting destroyed then people are opposing me is really madness.

35:30.560 --> 35:36.700
If a mother sees that there is something wrong with a child, and she corrects that then ….

35:36.700 --> 35:41.380
In your simplicity and innocence something has been spoiled within

35:41.380 --> 35:44.320
and I am here to correct it.

35:44.320 --> 35:49.820
But to think such things from beforehand only, what is so sensible about this?

35:49.820 --> 35:53.260
What kind of demand is this?

35:53.280 --> 35:58.380
Today is Guru Purnima,

35:58.380 --> 36:01.160
and I have to explain Sahaja Yoga fully to you.

36:01.160 --> 36:06.500
It is not possible in such a short time.

36:06.500 --> 36:14.220
I wanted to talk on many things but this subject is very comprehensive.

36:14.220 --> 36:19.700
And in many of the meditation classes I have told people

36:19.700 --> 36:25.380
that those who are realized have reached such a stage that they can understand it.

36:25.380 --> 36:29.000
Because from their hands the vibrations of Joy are flowing;

36:29.000 --> 36:34.180
those vibrations of Love are flowing by which they can understand what collective consciousness is.

36:34.180 --> 36:36.820
One must understand that what is this ?

36:36.820 --> 36:42.000
There maybe many people among you

36:42.000 --> 36:50.880
who feel your hands are shaking or getting hot when you put your hands towards me.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.720
You might feel so.

36:52.720 --> 36:56.340
So people may say we are getting vibrations. These are not vibrations.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.380
That is because you are opposing me.

36:58.380 --> 37:01.240
Something within you is opposing me.

37:01.240 --> 37:05.400
The love that I am giving you

37:05.400 --> 37:10.760
your hands are shaking because of your opposition.

37:10.760 --> 37:19.500
I believe the vibrations come when your Sahasrara starts moving.

37:19.500 --> 37:23.780
Kabirdas has said “On the Top of the head the anahata (the unheard sound) beats.”

37:23.800 --> 37:28.920
It means that just like the beating of heart the same happens at the top of the head.

37:28.920 --> 37:38.740
When the noise of this breaks and pierces then you become one with God,

37:38.740 --> 37:44.180
then no noise comes nor do you see anything,nor is anything visible.

37:44.380 --> 37:48.220
Many people tell me that they have Divine Visions, divine this or that.

37:48.220 --> 37:51.780
What are you going to get with visions?

37:51.780 --> 37:59.260
If you were to get all, by having visions, then why this seeking?

37:59.260 --> 38:04.140
It is beyond vision or hearing with the ear.

38:04.140 --> 38:06.740
It has to be known from within.

38:06.740 --> 38:10.440
The one who has known it from within, can only understand it.

38:10.440 --> 38:20.220
With vision many see many big, big miracles.

38:20.220 --> 38:24.080
Many people see pictures, and many people tell me that he has miracles.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.940
I say, "my son, God is beyond this".

38:26.940 --> 38:29.620
It is an experience. Leave all this.

38:29.620 --> 38:38.500
By leaving all this and when you will come into Nirakara/Formless then you will get the Oneness with God,

38:38.500 --> 38:49.080
and then you will find the meaning of things that are Sakara/Formed.

38:51.320 --> 38:56.560
Many have been cured by these Joy giving vibrations.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.380
Diseases have got cured.

38:58.380 --> 39:05.540
But the greatest thing that has happened and that which has given me the greatest pleasure

39:05.540 --> 39:08.460
is that ten people have got their realization collectively.

39:08.460 --> 39:10.920
Now you will ask me how they got their realization so fast.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.140
Many don’t get their realization so fast.

39:13.140 --> 39:15.540
They have been coming since four years to me.

39:15.540 --> 39:24.640
Many ministers, governors, others, they don’t get their realization then what can I do?

39:24.640 --> 39:26.720
I don’t have to take

39:26.720 --> 39:31.180
money from them that you give me 2000 rupees and I will give you a certificate that you are realized.

39:31.180 --> 39:34.920
If it has not happened then it has not happened and if it has so it has.

39:34.920 --> 39:40.700
I had gone to America and there is one gentleman who is a big king, who was with me.

39:40.700 --> 39:46.160
He said “Mataji, whoever comes, you give them realization but you don’t give me. What have I done?”

39:46.160 --> 39:49.460
I said,” Son, I wont say anything to you because you will be upset.

39:49.460 --> 39:54.440
You have heard so many lectures on Dharma , but have you yourself ever established Dharma within you?

39:54.440 --> 39:59.500
Day and night you are killing yourself is for what?

40:00.200 --> 40:05.020
Just think, leave all this to God”

40:05.020 --> 40:08.240
Four days passed and he said, “I believe you.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.060
I went to India and all the people told me that you are realized.

40:12.060 --> 40:17.640
So do our work and give me money and they gave me certificates”.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.540
I said, “All this does not work on here, what can I do?”

40:20.540 --> 40:27.180
Because what is going to happen will happen; no amount of recommendation or cleverness of anyone will work.

40:27.180 --> 40:30.120
It is so ultra modern that nothing will happen.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.700
What will be, will be and what will not be, will not be.

40:32.700 --> 40:37.200
Now if it doesn’t happen such people get upset and start talking against me.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.240
What can I do if it does not happen.

40:39.240 --> 40:43.500
I want that you all should get it. Night and day I am working so hard so that you all get it.

40:43.500 --> 40:48.220
But if you do not get it then what can I do?

40:48.640 --> 40:50.280
It is your blockage.

40:50.280 --> 40:53.740
It is also necessary to think about this, about what is happening - nothing is said.

40:53.740 --> 40:57.560
If one says something, then everyone who is here also starts talking about it.

40:57.560 --> 41:03.980
When someone feels the work of Sahasrara, then others also talk about it.

41:04.860 --> 41:08.400
To cure diseases is not the work of Sahaja Yoga.

41:08.400 --> 41:14.260
You must know this, because many people say that so and so has cured them.

41:14.260 --> 41:16.440
What? What have they cured?

41:16.440 --> 41:24.800
Sahaja Yoga is the science of awakening the Kundalini and to get to God and nothing.

41:24.800 --> 41:33.280
And don’t associate all this with the gross; because there are thousands of diseases.

41:34.480 --> 41:38.740
because there are thousands of diseases.

41:38.740 --> 41:47.780
You must have heard of Dr Lang a very big doctor in London who suddenly died.

41:47.780 --> 42:00.700
His dead spirit got inside the superego of a soldier in Vietnam and started telling him to come with him to his son’s house in London.

42:00.700 --> 42:04.840
When they arrived he told him to tell his son that I have come inside your body.

42:04.840 --> 42:07.420
The son did not believe him.

42:07.420 --> 42:13.360
Then this soldier told him all the secret talks the father had with him.

42:13.360 --> 42:15.560
So the son started believing him.

42:15.560 --> 42:19.080
Then he told the son to help him to start his practice again.

42:19.080 --> 42:25.820
He said that in the other world there are many doctors who want to manifest.

42:25.820 --> 42:29.720
They have a very big international organization.

42:29.740 --> 42:32.240
Are they true people?

42:32.240 --> 42:33.840
It is an untruth.

42:33.840 --> 42:37.480
They do not give the name of God they say it is this way.

42:37.480 --> 42:47.680
And if you write to them they say that at 10 o’clock a man will come and do something and you just relax.

42:47.680 --> 42:54.900
And right at that time you feel that something or someone has come within you and you have got alright.

42:54.900 --> 43:06.000
But they have cured only the body and have not got the Param Tattwa/Supreme Essence.

43:06.000 --> 43:11.680
This body will get left behind here and then one will go there and come back again.

43:11.680 --> 43:24.200
And on whom such practices are being done, they do not know, they are also innocent , that the very spirits they are using for their work will one day come onto them.

43:24.200 --> 43:30.100
Dr Lang must have known this otherwise why did he not enter his son?

43:30.100 --> 43:32.720
He can go into a soldier

43:32.740 --> 43:37.760
And the body of spirits is not gross like ours

43:37.760 --> 43:41.380
that is why he can see much more than us.

43:41.380 --> 43:46.080
This is what is called ESP or psychology

43:46.080 --> 43:55.500
or what you call the Pentacostals, blessings of the Atma/Soul, where a person jumps, screams, yells, mesmerism.

43:55.500 --> 43:58.120
This is all the work of spirits.

43:58.120 --> 44:05.260
From these many are good spirits and many are extremely evil.

44:05.260 --> 44:07.840
Just as we are so, are the spirits.

44:07.840 --> 44:10.880
Some are rakshasas and devils.

44:10.880 --> 44:20.100
Today you are not seeing them but I might show them to you later, just as today you can see the rising of the Kundalini.

44:20.100 --> 44:24.320
They are there. You can see their reality their behavior.

44:24.320 --> 44:27.420
In every religion they have been written about.

44:27.420 --> 44:31.640
In the Hindus the Sura and Asuras have been written about.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.520
What is, is.

44:33.520 --> 44:38.940
When you will talk of the positive and the negative will have to be shown to you.

44:38.940 --> 44:42.820
Just to talk of Dharma and Adharma is just a talk.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.560
Just to talk only of dharma, then how can it be?

44:46.560 --> 44:48.440
There is Dharma and adharma.

44:48.440 --> 44:54.060
What is dharma cannot be adharma and what is adharma cannot be dharma.

44:54.060 --> 44:58.180
This confusion has been made somewhere but this is not true.

44:58.180 --> 45:03.380
What is negative is negative and what is positive is positive.

45:03.380 --> 45:05.540
One should understand the negative.

45:05.540 --> 45:13.020
Negative means that which is dead, which is sitting in the sympathetic.

45:13.020 --> 45:17.740
And the effect of that negative

45:17.740 --> 45:24.500
is more where it is very gross like the city of Bombay.

45:24.500 --> 45:27.180
We are very gross in this city of Bombay.

45:27.180 --> 45:32.320
Day and night there is the sound of money, the flags of elections.

45:32.320 --> 45:36.060
Night and day the attention is stuck in all these things.

45:36.060 --> 45:40.660
Man‘s attention does not go beyond this.

45:40.660 --> 45:43.440
There is no enquiry, no seeking.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.500
Is this why we are living?

45:45.500 --> 45:50.260
Is it to read all this that the gundas, gangsters, hit so and so,

45:50.260 --> 45:53.380
they criticized and talked against another, they did this to someone.

45:53.380 --> 45:56.240
Have we come into this world to do all this?

45:56.240 --> 45:59.180
Man’s thinking is all wrong.

45:59.180 --> 46:01.780
Be very careful of this gross level essence/jad tattwa.

46:01.780 --> 46:04.620
This gross level is your own surroundings.

46:04.620 --> 46:07.920
Besides this there is also the collective subconscious,

46:07.920 --> 46:15.100
which can be called heaven and because of this the damage is being done is the most in Sahaja Yoga.

46:15.100 --> 46:23.120
And if such a thing has happened with someone it becomes very difficult for him to get God in Sahaja Yoga.

46:23.120 --> 46:28.840
In this it is neither my fault nor yours.

46:28.840 --> 46:31.860
It is partly the fault of your karmas (deeds).

46:31.860 --> 46:40.100
Otherwise why did you go to such a place by which you got so damaged?

46:43.440 --> 46:56.320
Sahaja Yoga is life’s progress in full alertness taking place spontaneously.

46:57.440 --> 47:06.480
You cannot get the Param from bhoots, prets,spirits or even saints.

47:06.480 --> 47:12.280
These are dead people. Param can come only when one is alive.

47:12.280 --> 47:16.800
If it was among the dead then why would these dead people come here?

47:16.800 --> 47:20.340
Why are they sitting on us?

47:20.340 --> 47:22.760
To be alive is necessary.

47:22.760 --> 47:33.240
Till a man is not alive, aware, and his awareness is not fully awakened till then Sahaja Yoga does not descend down into him.

47:33.240 --> 47:38.440
Whatever you get in the fully awakened state, that is Param/Supreme.

47:38.440 --> 47:44.060
People think that in Samadhi we have put our eyes upwards and got lost, are sitting for two, two hours.

47:44.060 --> 47:46.960
This will not happen through Sahaja Yoga.

47:46.960 --> 47:55.480
This is your entire subconscious which I call as region /loka of death. This is where you are going.

47:55.480 --> 48:01.060
From all this there is going to be no benefit to you whatsoever.

48:01.060 --> 48:10.380
The one who wants the Param/Supreme must think that that is what I must get is with full awareness and with full freedom.

48:10.380 --> 48:14.180
You have the full freedom.

48:14.180 --> 48:21.840
In fact there should be no type of devotion feelings towards me.

48:21.840 --> 48:26.200
I am just like an ordinary, mild woman, an ordinary housewife.

48:26.200 --> 48:30.460
You have not to think that I am something special.

48:30.460 --> 48:38.380
With such a thought you must have this type of freedom, only then you will get.

48:38.380 --> 48:47.360
You might be ten or one it is enough for me.

48:49.240 --> 48:59.800
It does not happen with numbers though we will have to increase the numbers.

48:59.800 --> 49:03.500
Because if the work gets done in full force.

49:03.500 --> 49:11.940
Actually the Param is flowing from above for a new creation, a new awareness, for a new type of human.

49:11.940 --> 49:15.440
It has done the arrangement for it.

49:15.440 --> 49:28.920
A full of love, full of knowledge and a beautiful creation of humans will have to be done and will be done.

49:30.460 --> 49:35.020
You people have listened to my lecture for such a long time.

49:35.020 --> 49:42.140
On the day of Guru Purnima, that in this life I have become a Guru.

49:42.140 --> 49:45.420
I had not done this type of work in any other lifetime.

49:45.420 --> 49:48.240
It is the first time that I have done the work of the Guru.

49:48.240 --> 49:52.300
Maybe it is because the Mother has to be the Guru.

49:52.300 --> 49:55.120
This is a matter of the Kalyuga.

49:55.120 --> 50:04.460
That is why the tremendous Shakti of the Divine which must flow from the heart of a mother ,

50:04.460 --> 50:09.920
and by Her grace and compassion the Kundalini should be treasured

50:09.920 --> 50:23.020
and it should be taken to that top where She in Her glory, Her Joy, and Her splendor be seated, and perhaps that is in my destiny.

50:23.020 --> 50:31.200
That is why in this birth this position of the Guru has been created.

50:31.220 --> 50:38.200
If the Mother becomes the Guru, it is a very difficult, as a mother is very tender.

50:38.200 --> 50:41.520
A male Guru will beat up, hit or even scold

50:41.520 --> 50:50.600
but for a mother when she utters even one harsh word her heart bleeds and pains a lot.

50:50.600 --> 50:55.980
When she sees that her children have come through such difficulties,

50:55.980 --> 51:00.240
and how she has to gather them with love and

51:00.240 --> 51:12.780
care and take them across, that her responsibility grows so much that her entire character changes.

51:12.780 --> 51:20.460
But from ancient times it has been known that no one is greater than the mother as a guru.

51:20.460 --> 51:30.780
Only make such a one your guru who is greater than you, the one who is greater than you is God.

51:30.780 --> 51:35.940
It was said about Guru Ramdas swami that make only such a person your guru

51:35.940 --> 51:42.540
who himself is paras/ touchstone, and who just by touching others

51:42.540 --> 51:46.600
does not make them into gold but makes them elixir/touchstone.

51:46.820 --> 51:49.320
He makes others like himself.

51:49.320 --> 51:52.120
That is how the form of the mother is.

51:52.120 --> 51:54.680
A mother lives for her children..

51:54.680 --> 51:57.260
Lives in the glory of her children

51:57.260 --> 52:10.800
That is why perhaps in this lifetime the Divine wanted this that this love and this knowledge should come through a mother.

52:10.800 --> 52:18.720
Now we will go into meditation and after this, so all of you sit with full attention.

52:18.720 --> 52:25.860
Leave your thoughts and assumptions

52:25.860 --> 52:30.360
aside because you have to get your welfare and well-being.

52:30.360 --> 52:32.740
Be good to yourself.

52:32.740 --> 52:35.040
Don’t take out your faults.

52:35.040 --> 52:39.340
If you are catching onto something then just leave it for the time being.

52:39.340 --> 52:44.340
I have nothing to take from you, and I don’t want to take away your freedom.

52:44.340 --> 52:52.040
In any way I don’t want to snatch away your freedom.

52:52.040 --> 52:59.040
Like people will run after someone like mad, will spend lakhs of rupees on them, give them things.

52:59.040 --> 53:01.140
Why do they take things?

53:01.140 --> 53:05.180
If he is a guru then he cannot take anything from you. What will you give the Guru?
537

53:05.180 --> 53:08.940
What will you give me? You can give me nothing.

53:08.940 --> 53:11.300
You cannot even give me vibrations.

53:11.300 --> 53:14.220
You will be surprised that you cannot give me vibrations.

53:14.220 --> 53:18.020
One day I hurt my foot and a lady doctor said that “Mother I will give you vibrations.”

53:18.020 --> 53:19.720
I said “Ok give.”

53:19.720 --> 53:27.120
When she tried to give vibrations they flew so strongly that she went into meditation. She said “Mataji, such tremendous vibrations are coming”

53:27.120 --> 53:31.340
And my injury became so light.

53:31.340 --> 53:36.440
Guru should be one who can take nothing from you.

53:36.440 --> 53:41.340
The one who is sitting at the top, he will flow downwards; nothing from below can flow upwards towards him.

53:41.340 --> 53:43.140
It is impossible.

53:43.140 --> 53:49.420
If I say, my son, please do not give me as this is just eyewash.

53:49.420 --> 53:55.580
You can give me nothing, in fact just the opposite.

53:55.580 --> 53:58.220
You ask Me.

53:58.220 --> 54:07.240
Your whole personality just boils over and all the forceful and spectacular Shaktis/ energies start racing within with such a force that

54:07.240 --> 54:22.620
with what kind of love should I look after this child, anyone has to ask for just a bit. Ask for the Param/Supreme.Просите Парам/Наивысшее.

54:22.620 --> 54:32.700
On this Guru Purnima I bless all of you and all those who are realized, are very special people, and

54:32.700 --> 54:39.160
I would say to them that just as you have got, give to others.

54:39.160 --> 54:42.960
You too have to bring them around

54:42.960 --> 54:48.340
Might be that they may get annoyed with you,hit you, beat you, they may not remain, but this is nothing.

54:48.340 --> 54:50.720
I have borne much more than this.

54:50.720 --> 54:55.420
That is why with joy and not arguments; they may not believe in you, doesn’t matter

54:55.420 --> 55:00.020
Leave them. They may argue, just leave them.

55:00.020 --> 55:03.260
The ones who believe in you give them.

55:03.260 --> 55:12.440
This is what you have to give and this is all you can give that my love may reach each corner of the world and each house may be lit with it.

55:12.440 --> 55:17.980
May God Bless You.
