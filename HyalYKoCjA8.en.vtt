WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:06.970
I’m really sorry for being late but your
Grand Hotel here only delayed me.

00:06.970 --> 00:12.790
We had ordered for a tea for forty-five minutes
and they couldn’t prepare tea for us!

00:12.790 --> 00:15.110
Now what’s happening to us here?

00:15.110 --> 00:20.690
We have to understand that people are not
normal in these modern times.

00:20.690 --> 00:24.140
There’s something going wrong with them
somewhere.

00:24.140 --> 00:30.649
And maybe something serious is happening within
us, which is giving such a collective effect

00:30.649 --> 00:31.849
outside.

00:31.849 --> 00:36.730
Now the trouble is, we do not know what we
are inside.

00:36.730 --> 00:42.859
Unless and until we know what we are, unless
and until there is light within us, we cannot

00:42.859 --> 00:46.530
understand what the problem with us is.

00:46.530 --> 00:53.589
We just accept whatever we know with whatever
our limited awareness is.

00:53.589 --> 01:00.960
Because the human awareness has not reached
that state of fruitfulness where one can say

01:00.960 --> 01:05.300
that, “I know definitely this is my use.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.610
I know definitely, why I am here.

01:07.610 --> 01:15.340
I know definitely, what is my purpose – why
I became a human being from the amoeba stage;

01:15.340 --> 01:19.980
why all these troubles were taken by the nature
to make me a human being."

01:19.980 --> 01:25.970
We have not been able to answer these questions
at all.

01:25.970 --> 01:29.160
But the human mind is such that it compromises
with everything.

01:29.160 --> 01:37.250
You see, it is like a little oyster which
gets a stone inside its little house, the

01:37.250 --> 01:38.250
shell.

01:38.250 --> 01:42.640
So he says, “Alright, now I’m not going
to bother much now.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.670
It’s alright."

01:43.670 --> 01:51.000
So it goes on weaving around that little part
of that stone, whatever it is, which is just

01:51.000 --> 01:52.250
troubling it.

01:52.250 --> 01:57.170
Then by some movement he gets a little more
pinch, then he goes on again and again and

01:57.170 --> 01:58.500
again like that.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.160
That’s how we live in this world most of
the time and we think, “Oh!

02:02.160 --> 02:03.310
We are on top of the world.

02:03.310 --> 02:08.580
Nothing is wrong with us,” till we come
face to face to something that is disastrous.

02:08.580 --> 02:13.480
Some disaster shocks us and then, “Oh!

02:13.480 --> 02:15.460
How it happened?”

02:15.460 --> 02:16.770
Like war.

02:16.770 --> 02:22.570
Till we reach to the point of war, we are
preparing for war in many ways.

02:22.570 --> 02:29.520
But when the war breaks on us then we are
shocked and we say, “Oh God!

02:29.520 --> 02:30.990
What happened?”

02:30.990 --> 02:34.310
Today the war is within, within ourselves,
not without.

02:34.310 --> 02:38.690
We are not realising how it is building up
within ourselves.

02:38.690 --> 02:41.440
For example, cancer is the physical war within
ourselves.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.610
We are not aware of that.

02:43.610 --> 02:46.510
We just accept our body as it is.

02:46.510 --> 02:49.270
Tomorrow we go to the doctor and he says,“You
have got cancer."

02:49.270 --> 02:51.160
[So] we jump in the sea – finished!

02:51.160 --> 02:56.450
We don’t know how it is caused, why it has
caused, what have we done to ourselves?

02:56.450 --> 03:01.440
Another person is alright for normal purposes.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.370
Suddenly, the psychologist said that, “You
better go to the lunatic asylum."

03:04.370 --> 03:05.370
And we are there!

03:05.370 --> 03:09.130
We find ourselves in a lunatics and we are
wondering, “How is it I am here?

03:09.130 --> 03:10.730
Supposed to be sane!”

03:10.730 --> 03:20.150
Then you find certain people who are seeking
their spirituality or all other seeking.

03:20.150 --> 03:22.750
They think, “Oh we have got this, we’ve
got that.

03:22.750 --> 03:26.110
We should have this and we are now on top
of the world!”

03:26.110 --> 03:28.310
And where do you find yourself?

03:28.310 --> 03:30.770
You have lost all your money, everything.

03:30.770 --> 03:31.959
You are nowhere.

03:31.959 --> 03:32.959
You are a recluse.

03:32.959 --> 03:33.959
You are fragmented.

03:33.959 --> 03:34.959
You have no relationship with your society.

03:34.959 --> 03:41.959
As you have come, you have added nothing to
your society, nothing to yourself and have

03:41.959 --> 03:47.560
just finished your life like that.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.660
We have given nothing to the nature from which
we have taken, nothing to the society that

03:51.660 --> 03:56.930
we are living in, nothing to the country where
we are, nothing to the universe that has made

03:56.930 --> 04:00.110
us, and nothing to God who has created us.

04:00.110 --> 04:05.190
Because in the name of God also I have seen
such hocus-pocus going on.

04:05.190 --> 04:10.550
All kinds of hocus-pocus going on in this
world: you don’t imagine how far people

04:10.550 --> 04:12.530
can go with this kind of a thing!

04:12.530 --> 04:13.880
They want to make money.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.160
All kinds of thing they’ll start, “Oh,
there’s a place here.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.269
If you go, you will get cured."

04:18.269 --> 04:24.120
Thousands of people will be going there [but]
it’s all hocus-pocus!

04:24.120 --> 04:25.569
Just imagine!

04:25.569 --> 04:27.659
All the money is exhausted, everything.

04:27.659 --> 04:30.229
You find that, “Oh you have achieved nothing."

04:30.229 --> 04:32.270
Then you think that, “Alright, let’s have
some fun!”

04:32.270 --> 04:36.360
At least you have nothing to do, “Let’s
have some fun!”

04:36.360 --> 04:42.960
So what is the idea for fun is also very funny
because the fun is that how we give up our

04:42.960 --> 04:43.960
respectability.

04:43.960 --> 04:53.349
You see fun means: Today I saw…we went to
a shop and we had parked at an angle from

04:53.349 --> 05:02.849
the main road and there was a big pub where
some boys, young boys, good, nice boys, were

05:02.849 --> 05:04.690
taking some beer or something.

05:04.690 --> 05:07.740
And a girl came and parked the car in one
place.

05:07.740 --> 05:13.240
When she went away they got down from their
pub – they were on the balcony, came down,

05:13.240 --> 05:18.620
lifted her car, actually lifted, all of them;
put it on the other side and put the same

05:18.620 --> 05:20.080
type of car in her place.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.289
They took about, to do this, half an hour.

05:23.289 --> 05:28.910
And they thought they were having fun: laughing,
joking, this thing, that thing.

05:28.910 --> 05:32.360
How can such foolish fun make you happy?

05:32.360 --> 05:34.660
This is stupidity.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.969
Wasting your time.

05:36.969 --> 05:37.969
Idiocity.

05:37.969 --> 05:40.949
I mean, I can understand a little boy doing
it.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.389
But behind it is something sinister.

05:42.389 --> 05:44.379
As if they were possessed, I felt.

05:44.379 --> 05:47.699
They didn’t know how much the girl will
be worried unnecessarily.

05:47.699 --> 05:55.169
On the contrary, if they had put in that much
effort to do good to someone, the joy would

05:55.169 --> 05:57.809
have been much more lasting.

05:57.809 --> 06:04.719
But this is the problem with human beings,
that they do not recognise, they do not know.

06:04.719 --> 06:06.139
They have no moorings.

06:06.139 --> 06:10.999
They cannot fathom where they are, where are
they drifting.

06:10.999 --> 06:19.069
As long as there’s nothing that is troubling
them, they go on moving onto same lines.

06:19.069 --> 06:24.919
Of course, in the modern times, despite all
this, there’s a big seeking going on.

06:24.919 --> 06:26.099
People are born with seeking.

06:26.099 --> 06:27.539
Children are born with seeking.

06:27.539 --> 06:31.800
From childhood, they find that there’s something
wrong.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.970
They find sometimes, even in their family,
as if their parents, their relations are extremely

06:36.970 --> 06:41.069
narrow-minded, they are very funny.

06:41.069 --> 06:43.860
They find some people in the society extremely
aggressive.

06:43.860 --> 06:46.189
Or all kinds of things they find.

06:46.189 --> 06:49.409
And then they open their eyes and they start
seeing relatively, “Am I also one of them?

06:49.409 --> 06:54.520
Am I going to be one of them?”

06:54.520 --> 06:56.610
Then relatively they start seeing, “No,
no, no, no, that’s not the life.

06:56.610 --> 06:58.919
There’s something wrong."

06:58.919 --> 07:03.970
Because these people who are born like that
are of a different calibre, of a different

07:03.970 --> 07:07.050
temperament, of a very different quality.

07:07.050 --> 07:13.241
But they also gradually lose their quality
when they get into the mundane life and when

07:13.241 --> 07:15.330
they accept other people so easily.

07:15.330 --> 07:21.660
They also accept that, “Oh, alright, whatever
was there was ego.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.680
So this was too much of a ego in us.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.500
It was a colossal ego within us.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.749
By ego we dominated,” So they say, “Alright.

07:27.749 --> 07:28.830
Let’s go back."

07:28.830 --> 07:29.899
You try to become primitive.

07:29.899 --> 07:33.789
Now you cannot become primitive because the
brain is not.

07:33.789 --> 07:34.940
Your brain is over-developed.

07:34.940 --> 07:41.990
Even if you try, you cannot become primitive
because in a primitive man, thinking process

07:41.990 --> 07:42.990
is very little.

07:42.990 --> 07:47.939
While what you do, your only life, is nothing
but thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking,

07:47.939 --> 07:48.939
thinking!

07:48.939 --> 07:53.240
Like two horns of thinking all the time growing
out of you and creating a circle all around

07:53.240 --> 07:54.240
you!

07:54.240 --> 07:55.240
How can you become primitive?

07:55.240 --> 08:01.550
So also these are all only conceptions within
ourselves or convictions that we’ll become

08:01.550 --> 08:02.740
that.

08:02.740 --> 08:06.849
By convictions, you do not become.

08:06.849 --> 08:12.589
Supposing I have convinced myself that I am
the Queen of England.

08:12.589 --> 08:14.360
Will I become?

08:14.360 --> 08:18.849
Or I get an idea, conceive an idea, that I
am this and this.

08:18.849 --> 08:19.849
Will I become?

08:19.849 --> 08:20.849
I have to become!

08:20.849 --> 08:22.339
I mean it is so simple as that, isn’t it.

08:22.339 --> 08:23.339
It is so practical.

08:23.339 --> 08:34.390
You see, if I tell you that you have to have
your tea, alright.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.449
Then you will say, “I have never had my
tea.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.079
What about the tea?”

08:38.079 --> 08:39.849
Till you have it you have to have it.

08:39.849 --> 08:41.250
But you’ll say, “No.

08:41.250 --> 08:46.730
Alright, as long I said I will have my tea,
up to that point it’s alright."

08:46.730 --> 08:48.620
[As if] I have had already.

08:48.620 --> 08:53.980
That kind of misconception we have: that without
doing it we feel quite satisfied about it.

08:53.980 --> 08:57.830
And this is called as The Great Illusion of
Kali Yuga, called as ‘Mahamaya’.

08:57.830 --> 09:05.920
Is the greatest illusion is this – that
human beings are made to believe what they

09:05.920 --> 09:07.740
are not.

09:07.740 --> 09:10.720
They accept such a situation, many a times.

09:10.720 --> 09:16.779
It’s alright in a drama, [if] you are watching
a very big hero, say, Napoleon fighting and

09:16.779 --> 09:17.930
Wellington fighting.

09:17.930 --> 09:19.959
Suddenly you feel, “Oh, I am Napoleon!”

09:19.959 --> 09:21.170
Maybe, alright.

09:21.170 --> 09:27.790
But in real life also we get assumptions like
that which are really falsehood which are

09:27.790 --> 09:28.790
not ourselves.

09:28.790 --> 09:32.310
So we come to the point – what are we?

09:32.310 --> 09:35.420
Actually, what are we?

09:35.420 --> 09:38.630
If these are assumptions and conceptions,
what are we?

09:38.630 --> 09:40.100
Really, what are we?

09:40.100 --> 09:43.020
And we are nothing but the Spirit.

09:43.020 --> 09:50.450
We are that Eternal Being within us, reflected,
which is called as ‘Spirit’, the Atma.

09:50.450 --> 09:51.829
That is what we are.

09:51.829 --> 09:55.389
The rest of it has no meaning at all.

09:55.389 --> 10:03.070
For example, there’s a lamp, which has no
light in it – what will you do with it?

10:03.070 --> 10:06.350
Say there is a tube which has no light in
it – what do you think about it?

10:06.350 --> 10:14.079
Supposing this machine is here and it doesn’t
work – what do you call it ?

10:14.079 --> 10:15.079
A junk!

10:15.079 --> 10:22.000
In the same way, if we do not find out that
light within us, if we do not enlighten ourselves

10:22.000 --> 10:28.910
with that light, we are not finding out our
meaning, our purpose.

10:28.910 --> 10:34.449
We are wasting our life, either with our ego
or with our conditioning.

10:34.449 --> 10:39.100
Conditioning, of course, can be found out
in no time.

10:39.100 --> 10:45.060
Very easy to find out the conditioning, which
takes place through this left side channel,

10:45.060 --> 10:48.279
which is called as the Ida Nadi.

10:48.279 --> 10:52.870
It’s a subtle channel within us called as
‘Ida Nadi’.

10:52.870 --> 10:58.610
This is the power we have got by which we
desire.

10:58.610 --> 11:04.420
In Sanskrit, this one is called as ‘Mahakali
Power’.

11:04.420 --> 11:08.230
The power of desire, by which we desire.

11:08.230 --> 11:11.240
Desire does not have a materialised thing.

11:11.240 --> 11:17.750
People may desire to become the King of England
but that’s not so, isn’t it.

11:17.750 --> 11:18.920
Just, it’s a desire.

11:18.920 --> 11:26.370
So the power of desire comes through this
one which is called as ‘Mahakali’.

11:26.370 --> 11:30.149
This Power flows through in a channel called
as ‘Ida’.

11:30.149 --> 11:31.930
Now, the names are in Sanskrit.

11:31.930 --> 11:39.579
The trouble is [that] all this was discovered
thousands of year back by seers who gave it

11:39.579 --> 11:41.069
a Sanskrit name.

11:41.069 --> 11:45.340
Also it has some meaning that these names
they got it from the Unconscious.

11:45.340 --> 11:50.790
So these are not Sanskrit names but are the
names actually of that thing.

11:50.790 --> 11:58.160
So this is the Ida nadi which manifests within
us the power of desire.

11:58.160 --> 12:03.079
It is also called as ‘Chandra Nadi’ meaning
the Line of Moon.

12:03.079 --> 12:12.779
On the right hand side, you see another power
by which we act, the power of action; called

12:12.779 --> 12:21.939
as the Mahasaraswati Power which resides within
us as the power to act.

12:21.939 --> 12:23.870
In two ways, we act.

12:23.870 --> 12:27.259
And also power to act, to think.

12:27.259 --> 12:30.060
Like whatever we have to do, we think about
it.

12:30.060 --> 12:39.470
So, it can be divided into two halves: one
is when we act because of our physical capacities,

12:39.470 --> 12:42.610
and when we think, because of our rational
capacity.

12:42.610 --> 12:49.589
So these two powers reside within us in a
very subtle way.

12:49.589 --> 12:56.970
And outside they express themselves in the
gross as two sympathetic nervous systems,

12:56.970 --> 13:02.480
called as left and the right sympathetic nervous
system.

13:02.480 --> 13:07.870
By the left sympathetic nervous system, we
accept all the conditioning, which Freud has

13:07.870 --> 13:12.860
described, as conditioning, through this one,
because it takes you to your past.

13:12.860 --> 13:16.910
So this represents the line of your past.

13:16.910 --> 13:22.240
The right hand side one gives you the future.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.949
That is the one which gives us the idea of
the future.

13:25.949 --> 13:29.490
For example, animals do not have much idea
of the future.

13:29.490 --> 13:31.360
They mostly live with their conditioning.

13:31.360 --> 13:36.449
Only their left side is really developed,
so much so, that the pineal body, which is

13:36.449 --> 13:42.749
in our brain, which controls our Left Side,
is more developed in animals than in human

13:42.749 --> 13:43.749
beings.

13:43.749 --> 13:50.310
Then, as a human being, your Right Side starts
working because we think, we speak, and we

13:50.310 --> 13:53.079
think of the future, [so] Right Side is developed.

13:53.079 --> 14:01.189
With the conditioning, you develop a superego
by which you can be a person who is very frightened,

14:01.189 --> 14:06.249
who takes aggressions from others, who are
very subdued, over-subdued.

14:06.249 --> 14:08.540
You run away from your duties.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.949
You escape things.

14:09.949 --> 14:13.329
Lots of things are there if you are overdeveloped
[on the] Left Side.

14:13.329 --> 14:16.819
But if you have overdeveloped [the] Right
Side then you develop that horrible yellow

14:16.819 --> 14:18.980
thing like a bile called as Mr.

14:18.980 --> 14:20.209
Ego.

14:20.209 --> 14:26.420
And this ego today is quite prevalent everywhere
and is a big problem because after Realisation

14:26.420 --> 14:30.829
we start seeing it and then we don’t know
whether to laugh or to cry the way things

14:30.829 --> 14:31.829
work out.

14:31.829 --> 14:38.759
So this ego is also responsible for our funny
behaviour towards others.

14:38.759 --> 14:45.720
Now the problem of ego is that people do not
find it out till they really suffer badly.

14:45.720 --> 14:51.070
Because ego is something that doesn’t give
trouble to the individual so much, as to the

14:51.070 --> 14:52.070
society.

14:52.070 --> 14:53.070
It gives to the society.

14:53.070 --> 14:59.190
For example, such a place or a such a community
where the ego is prevalent, the families will

14:59.190 --> 15:05.330
break and the societies will break, people
will be extremely arrogant and troublemakers

15:05.330 --> 15:12.070
and they will be the ones who will have all
kinds of aggressions on other countries and

15:12.070 --> 15:14.880
they will not allow anybody to aggress them.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.189
They will suppress other people.

15:16.189 --> 15:17.189
This is Mr.

15:17.189 --> 15:18.189
Ego working.

15:18.189 --> 15:20.509
So you do not find the mistake of the ego.

15:20.509 --> 15:23.620
Ego can be developed with so many things by
the society itself.

15:23.620 --> 15:29.000
Like you must have seen they always say that,
“If you wear this dress you will look very

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
nice."

15:30.000 --> 15:32.160
Now you think, “Ah, that’s the one I should
go in for.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.160
Oh, that’s the one for me!”

15:33.160 --> 15:37.449
All such pampering of that ego can be worked
out in a society, which is absolutely hovering

15:37.449 --> 15:38.540
with ego.

15:38.540 --> 15:44.660
Now to say that ego is better or superego
is better, I say both are equally the same,

15:44.660 --> 15:45.660
because both take you away from reality.

15:45.660 --> 15:51.660
While reality is in the centre is the most
beautiful thing, and that is you.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.499
These are artificial, two balloons.

15:53.499 --> 15:56.540
They can be punctured in no time and you could
be yourself.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.310
They are just trying to put you down.

15:59.310 --> 16:04.279
Whether it is ego or superego, they are hiding
your Spirit, which is in your heart.

16:04.279 --> 16:10.290
Now we have an arrangement within us, which
God has created within us, very beautiful

16:10.290 --> 16:11.830
– because He has created everything within
us.

16:11.830 --> 16:14.579
We have not created anything within us.

16:14.579 --> 16:17.420
Even if you want one hair to grow, we cannot
make it grow!

16:17.420 --> 16:19.980
I mean every thing He has done.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.890
We have done nothing about ourself or about
nature.

16:22.890 --> 16:27.529
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit,
that’s what we are.

16:27.529 --> 16:28.670
But we think no end of ourselves because of
Mr.

16:28.670 --> 16:29.670
Ego being there, you see.

16:29.670 --> 16:31.110
Because he makes us feel, “Oh!

16:31.110 --> 16:32.110
We are great!”

16:32.110 --> 16:35.019
Some people even say, “How can there be
God?

16:35.019 --> 16:36.829
After all, we have done this, we have done
that!”

16:36.829 --> 16:39.889
Now, I ask them, “What have you done?

16:39.889 --> 16:44.240
Except for changing a chair to a table and
table to a chair!”

16:44.240 --> 16:49.040
And then the chair sits on your head and the
table also sits on your head because you cannot

16:49.040 --> 16:51.589
live without them.

16:51.589 --> 16:56.481
The matter, which we have converted from dead
to dead, is also giving us habits.

16:56.481 --> 16:58.750
So we have done nothing!

16:58.750 --> 17:01.610
To think that we have achieved something is
really tomfoolery.

17:01.610 --> 17:06.210
But see in the nature, see everywhere – the
living work of God is so evident.

17:06.210 --> 17:08.970
What a tremendous power is working it out.

17:08.970 --> 17:11.400
After all, you have become a human being from
amoeba.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.250
How have you become?

17:13.250 --> 17:16.350
There must be some tremendous power that has
done this.

17:16.350 --> 17:17.810
And what is that power?

17:17.810 --> 17:20.490
That is what we have to become.

17:20.490 --> 17:25.260
Now within us also lies that special thing
called as ‘Kundalini’ which is a three

17:25.260 --> 17:31.630
and a half coiled power within us, which is
our germinating power.

17:31.630 --> 17:36.900
This power we have to awaken.

17:36.900 --> 17:41.350
If this power is awakened, then She rises
in the centre, in the present, integrating

17:41.350 --> 17:47.120
all these centres: one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven centres.

17:47.120 --> 17:55.770
All of them representing our seven beings
within us; also representing our growth in

17:55.770 --> 18:01.520
the evolutionary process, like the milestones,
integrating all of them, enlightening them.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.500
And She takes us to that point where we become,
again I say ‘we become’!

18:05.500 --> 18:06.750
We do not assume.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.050
It’s not a conception.

18:09.050 --> 18:10.600
You become.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.420
You become that.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.530
You become the Spirit.

18:14.530 --> 18:15.750
You become Realised.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.560
You get Realisation.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.550
It is not just talking about it.

18:19.550 --> 18:21.220
It has to happen.

18:21.220 --> 18:25.590
If it does not happen, say, it does not happen
to my own children, I will say, “It does

18:25.590 --> 18:26.590
not happen.

18:26.590 --> 18:27.590
What can I do about it?

18:27.590 --> 18:28.590
I cannot sprout your seed!”

18:28.590 --> 18:31.210
The seed has to be sprouted and sprouting
has to take place.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.680
It’s not a plastic seed.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.140
It is the real seed.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.960
And every real seed must be sprouted.

18:37.960 --> 18:42.440
And every real seed can be sprouted.

18:42.440 --> 18:47.580
But unless and until it is sprouted we cannot
say that it is there.

18:47.580 --> 18:52.450
Now the sprouting of the seed takes place
by the rising of the Kundalini, going through

18:52.450 --> 18:57.460
all these centres and piercing through this
area called as the fontanel bone.

18:57.460 --> 19:01.300
Now you know that you are ‘baptised’.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.780
This bone is baptised here.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.860
But nobody knows what it means, the baptism.

19:05.860 --> 19:08.809
Christ has said, “You have to be born again."

19:08.809 --> 19:13.160
Now how many churches are doing that job?

19:13.160 --> 19:18.410
Only by giving a so-called blessing over here,
do you get awakening of your Kundalini?

19:18.410 --> 19:20.310
I mean, let us face it!

19:20.310 --> 19:28.040
By going to any one of these Theological colleges
and Theo (God) experts, can they produce this

19:28.040 --> 19:29.040
effect?

19:29.040 --> 19:32.070
Because this college is different.

19:32.070 --> 19:35.590
This is the college of God.

19:35.590 --> 19:42.110
Your authority doesn’t come by wearing a
particular type of a dress and the gown and

19:42.110 --> 19:44.020
standing very seriously and saying, “Alright,
I bless you!”

19:44.020 --> 19:45.020
Who are you to bless?

19:45.020 --> 19:46.180
It’s such a mockery going on!

19:46.180 --> 19:52.710
I mean, they have no right, they have no authority,
they have no technique.

19:52.710 --> 19:57.770
Same about Hindus in India: I mean, if you
think that Hindus are sensible people, you

19:57.770 --> 19:58.970
are sadly mistaken.

19:58.970 --> 20:02.110
We have thugs, absolute thugs as Brahmins.

20:02.110 --> 20:08.090
They are not Brahmins, they are actually Roman
soldiers born in India.

20:08.090 --> 20:09.090
You see their faces.

20:09.090 --> 20:10.090
In Benares, especially they look like Romans!

20:10.090 --> 20:14.060
Horribly dishonest and aggressive they are.

20:14.060 --> 20:18.990
It’s all mockery going on in the name of
God.

20:18.990 --> 20:23.640
But when the Kundalini really rises before
a person, who is an authorised person, you

20:23.640 --> 20:28.031
can see with your naked eyes the pulsation
of the Kundalini in the triangular bone, even

20:28.031 --> 20:29.490
above it, wherever it is there.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.810
Now there are so many people here who have
seen.

20:31.810 --> 20:34.710
In London, we have so many people who have
seen it.

20:34.710 --> 20:41.330
But, still the question of ego is quite a
lot; it’s quite a lot because people can’t

20:41.330 --> 20:42.330
believe it.

20:42.330 --> 20:43.570
They just don’t want to believe it.

20:43.570 --> 20:46.050
They want to continue with their nonsense.

20:46.050 --> 20:48.620
They just don’t want to get it.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.620
And also, they feel, “Why Mataji?

20:49.620 --> 20:50.620
Why should she do it?”

20:50.620 --> 20:53.940
I mean, I said, “Now if it is my lot, what
am I to do?

20:53.940 --> 20:54.940
Now you better do it!”

20:54.940 --> 21:00.890
If you can take my place, I’ll be very happy
to settle down.

21:00.890 --> 21:03.790
Now, you know I have been travelling, travelling
for months together.

21:03.790 --> 21:11.010
Now Portugal, from Portugal I came then this
programme, that programme and it’s too much!

21:11.010 --> 21:16.760
But what I feel that if supposing that’s
my work, I should do it, isn’t it?

21:16.760 --> 21:18.620
And whatever is your work, you should do it!

21:18.620 --> 21:19.910
I mean, I don’t feel that.

21:19.910 --> 21:22.490
You know so many other things [that] I do
not know.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.490
I don’t know even how to drive!

21:23.490 --> 21:25.130
I’m so bad at many things!

21:25.130 --> 21:26.190
So I do not feel bad.

21:26.190 --> 21:28.910
Why should you feel so bad if I know the work
of Kundalini?

21:28.910 --> 21:34.110
Moreover, I do it out of love; just love,
nothing but love.

21:34.110 --> 21:36.220
In that love I find also lots of happiness
and that is what is essential.

21:36.220 --> 21:38.810
I have come for that purpose only.

21:38.810 --> 21:40.090
It has to be done.

21:40.090 --> 21:43.610
If it is not done, what is going to happen
to this human race?

21:43.610 --> 21:46.540
Nothing but destruction you can see it clearly,
writ large.

21:46.540 --> 21:50.500
It’s not a frivolous thing that we should
give up.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.450
We have to understand that we have to get
transformed.

21:52.450 --> 21:55.110
The whole human race has to be transformed.

21:55.110 --> 21:58.280
And this is the Last Judgment today.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.840
It has started.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.540
You are going to be judged by your Kundalini.

22:01.540 --> 22:02.540
How?

22:02.540 --> 22:05.260
God is not going to weigh you, how many seers
(an Indian measure equal to 1.25kg) you weigh.

22:05.260 --> 22:07.160
Like the way you have here beauty competitions.

22:07.160 --> 22:12.060
It is the Kundalini, which is going to say
how far you are.

22:12.060 --> 22:15.420
I have seen people in Birmingham before I
have come.

22:15.420 --> 22:18.920
I found, I am sorry to say, but in Birmingham
I have seen [that] people are very frivolous.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.080
They come to my programme, get their Realisation
– finished!

22:21.080 --> 22:27.020
They are not bothered about it, to see what
it is, what they have to do, why they got

22:27.020 --> 22:28.020
it.

22:28.020 --> 22:33.970
It’s like Christ’s parable that: you throw
some seeds here and some seeds there and so

22:33.970 --> 22:34.970
many of them are just wasted.

22:34.970 --> 22:44.410
It’s such a sad tale of human callousness
and lack of self-esteem.

22:44.410 --> 22:49.260
Absolutely, it is a very sad tale.

22:49.260 --> 22:52.080
You do not know what we are facing.

22:52.080 --> 22:56.490
And that’s why people play with their lives
in such a cheap way.

22:56.490 --> 22:58.600
It’s most surprising.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.480
Tomorrow their children are going to teach
them a lesson!

23:01.480 --> 23:04.890
And I don’t know what’s going to happen
to your children.

23:04.890 --> 23:16.290
So now, I have to request you to be attentive
about it, to get to it, work it out, have

23:16.290 --> 23:22.730
it within you and know all the knowledge about
yourself and about the Spirit.

23:22.730 --> 23:30.550
It is a very simple thing to give Realisation
but very difficult, in this country specially,

23:30.550 --> 23:33.580
to maintain it.

23:33.580 --> 23:41.810
So, for you, it is necessary to put in an
effort after Realisation, not before.

23:41.810 --> 23:43.390
Before you cannot.

23:43.390 --> 23:45.010
Before that somebody will work it out.

23:45.010 --> 23:49.430
But after Realisation, you have to look after
yourself, look after your being.

23:49.430 --> 23:54.550
This is what you have to see, this is what
you have to have.

23:54.550 --> 24:00.640
Now some people have been to some other things
like I would say ‘TM’ (Transcendental

24:00.640 --> 24:01.640
‘Meditation’) now.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.640
I went to Portugal.

24:02.640 --> 24:05.490
I was surprised the boys had nothing.

24:05.490 --> 24:06.860
They did not know what they were doing.

24:06.860 --> 24:09.210
They did not know they had no feeling, nothing.

24:09.210 --> 24:13.400
They did not know if they were Realised or
not Realised, if I was Realised or not Realised.

24:13.400 --> 24:17.090
They had no sensitivity, they had no awareness
developed, nothing!

24:17.090 --> 24:23.250
What they were doing was saying some ‘mantra’,
and by saying that mantra, they were really

24:23.250 --> 24:27.050
cutting out all the sensitivities within them
because these were artificial things.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.310
I mean, you can do it.

24:28.310 --> 24:29.310
Why take mantra?

24:29.310 --> 24:32.960
Even if you say, “Stone, stone, stone, stone,
stone, stone,” and go on saying for three

24:32.960 --> 24:35.730
months, you will be in the lunatic asylum.

24:35.730 --> 24:38.320
And the people from this TM now are coming
as epilepsy.

24:38.320 --> 24:42.730
We have here two people who have come with
epilepsy.

24:42.730 --> 24:45.240
But I told them, “Why don’t you tell your
mantra?”

24:45.240 --> 24:46.240
They said, “Why do You want to know?”

24:46.240 --> 24:52.620
I said, “Because you are under that conditioning
which I have to remove.

24:52.620 --> 24:56.070
I know already but you have to tell me to
show the courage that you want to get rid

24:56.070 --> 24:57.070
of it."

24:57.070 --> 24:58.070
They said, “It’s a secret."

24:58.070 --> 24:59.650
I said, “How can that be a secret?”

24:59.650 --> 25:00.650
What is secret in nature?

25:00.650 --> 25:01.650
Have you seen anything?

25:01.650 --> 25:03.710
See the ocean.

25:03.710 --> 25:07.750
See the flowers.

25:07.750 --> 25:11.470
The best is open.

25:11.470 --> 25:19.970
Absolutely the whole Brahma, the whole Truth
is open.

25:19.970 --> 25:25.400
If it is not open, it is not Truth.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.620
If it is hidden, how can it be the Truth?

25:28.620 --> 25:30.570
Truth is light.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.570
It has to be transparent, absolutely clear-cut.

25:31.570 --> 25:36.440
But this secrecy business can be only with
thugs and with mafias and things like that,

25:36.440 --> 25:37.620
because they are afraid.

25:37.620 --> 25:41.350
They are afraid of the statues of God, of
His laws.

25:41.350 --> 25:46.070
That’s why it is a secret.

25:46.070 --> 25:51.140
In nature or in any God’s work, in any great
man’s life, what was secret?

25:51.140 --> 25:57.250
They were standing on top of the hills and
mountains and shouting, “Be awakened, you

25:57.250 --> 25:59.870
the blind!”

25:59.870 --> 26:02.730
What was done secretly in Christ’s life,
I would like to know.

26:02.730 --> 26:05.850
Was there anything secretive in His lifetime?

26:05.850 --> 26:10.010
Why this kind of a secrecy working?

26:10.010 --> 26:11.770
Why not people understand?

26:11.770 --> 26:21.330
It is important that human beings must know
that the time has come for them to transform;

26:21.330 --> 26:27.530
to enter into the kingdom of God; to be the
citizen of God; to be looked after by His

26:27.530 --> 26:31.010
angels and all-pervading Divine love.

26:31.010 --> 26:34.660
He is a Father who is compassion and love.

26:34.660 --> 26:41.780
He forgives all our sins and everything because
He wants us to have all His powers and all

26:41.780 --> 26:42.860
His beauty.

26:42.860 --> 26:49.410
You cannot understand a Father of that kind
who is absolutely, impatiently waiting for

26:49.410 --> 26:53.690
you, who is so anxious.

26:53.690 --> 26:59.240
And that is the only concern He has out of
everything that, “When are my children going

26:59.240 --> 27:03.400
to know me?”

27:03.400 --> 27:09.029
At this stage, when we cling on to things,
which are useless, and nonsense.

27:09.029 --> 27:12.420
You must know that, “What did we know in
our awareness?”

27:12.420 --> 27:16.220
This is the only question you should ask yourself.

27:16.220 --> 27:18.470
Do I know what’s the matter with this person?

27:18.470 --> 27:20.440
Do I know what’s the matter with me?

27:20.440 --> 27:22.250
If there is light, I will know.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.360
I will know the other person as well as myself.

27:24.360 --> 27:27.870
Supposing you have a light in your hand, you
see yourself and you see the other person.

27:27.870 --> 27:32.670
But if there is light within you, you see
your light and in your light you see the other

27:32.670 --> 27:33.670
person.

27:33.670 --> 27:38.750
That’s what happens in Realisation that
you get collectively conscious, you become

27:38.750 --> 27:39.750
collectively conscious.

27:39.750 --> 27:40.950
Again I say, you actualise that awareness.

27:40.950 --> 27:46.490
It is not that I tell you, you are all brothers
and sisters but it just happens to you that

27:46.490 --> 27:48.690
you start feeling others on your fingertips.

27:48.690 --> 27:53.370
This is a very dynamic thing should happen
to all of you.

27:53.370 --> 27:55.860
It’s not per chance I am here.

27:55.860 --> 27:59.780
It looks like that because my husband got
elected to this post and I had to come from

27:59.780 --> 28:00.780
India.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.890
But it’s not per chance.

28:02.890 --> 28:06.510
It is the tribute to this great country that
I had to be here and tribute to my English

28:06.510 --> 28:09.280
children that I had to be here to look after
you.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.820
For I must tell you, I have told so many people,
and I must tell you – of course it should

28:12.820 --> 28:18.420
not give you ego but is a simple thing – that
English young people are the best in the whole

28:18.420 --> 28:19.420
world.

28:19.420 --> 28:22.540
Among all the young people, they are sensible,
scholarly, wise, logical.

28:22.540 --> 28:25.440
If you give them logic, they are sensible.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.330
But for Birmingham, I cannot say just now.

28:28.330 --> 28:30.810
Let’s see how it works out.

28:30.810 --> 28:35.320
We have some very good high people, very great
people but some.

28:35.320 --> 28:41.240
On the whole, England is the heart of the
whole universe.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.380
From here, everything circulates.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.380
You have no idea of this country.

28:44.380 --> 28:46.280
You have no esteem of this country.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.850
The way we have tortured our motherland here.

28:48.850 --> 28:51.340
I wish people could know.

28:51.340 --> 28:52.880
She is suffering within herself.

28:52.880 --> 28:58.870
Only Blake has cried, he has cried of Jerusalem
and that’s what I’m talking about.

28:58.870 --> 29:01.120
He could see that vision because he was that
sensitive.

29:01.120 --> 29:06.000
He’s the one who was a Realised soul, and
he was that sensitive, He could feel it.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.990
And the way he has described, the way he has
talked [about] the glory of this country.

29:10.990 --> 29:17.880
All this inertia, all this lethargy, all these
curses that are settling into this country

29:17.880 --> 29:21.180
are because of our foolishness and stupidity.

29:21.180 --> 29:22.770
You are the most dynamic people.

29:22.770 --> 29:26.290
And not only that, in spirituality you are
very dynamic.

29:26.290 --> 29:29.080
For your spiritual work, you can be very,
very dynamic.

29:29.080 --> 29:33.980
You are the ones who are going to throw away
all the shackles of nonsense and you are the

29:33.980 --> 29:38.250
ones who are going to recreate a beautiful
arena for the whole world.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.410
That’s why I am here.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.860
I have been here for six years, you won’t
believe that.

29:41.860 --> 29:45.430
And again I am here for six years, perhaps,
I hope so.

29:45.430 --> 29:50.890
I hope something substantial will be done
in all the parts where the English, who are

29:50.890 --> 29:56.790
my children, who are saints of the past, are
born in this country.

29:56.790 --> 30:02.700
Receive this and settle into it and not waste
the energy in the ego that your forefathers

30:02.700 --> 30:08.350
did: who were nonsensical, they just wasted
their life!

30:08.350 --> 30:10.020
Because you are not the same.

30:10.020 --> 30:11.410
You are different people.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.140
You are people, very different.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.540
Your aspirations are different.

30:14.540 --> 30:18.740
Of course there were some great people also
in the past, I am not saying that, but not

30:18.740 --> 30:20.880
so many as there are today.

30:20.880 --> 30:27.970
But they will be lost if they try to follow
the mundane type of understanding of life.

30:27.970 --> 30:30.090
It is much subtler, much greater.

30:30.090 --> 30:33.700
Unless and until you are Realised, you cannot
understand what I am talking.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.950
Krishna has said, “yasa pashyati sa pashyati”
(यः पश्यति स पश्यति)(Bhagavad

30:35.950 --> 30:39.060
Geeta 5.5) (meaning) “The one who can see,
can only see,” [So] what’s the use of

30:39.060 --> 30:40.060
talking to the blind?

30:40.060 --> 30:41.140
And I went to see Mr.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.780
Mascaró (who translated Bhagavad Geeta into
English), you might have heard his name from

30:43.780 --> 30:46.430
Cambridge and, aaah, the love and everything!

30:46.430 --> 30:49.000
The way he surrendered himself and absolutely.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.500
And he said, “Mother, ya sah pashyati sa
pashyati!”

30:51.500 --> 30:53.210
The one who can see can only see.

30:53.210 --> 30:54.450
How many can see you?

30:54.450 --> 30:55.450
Can they see you?”

30:55.450 --> 30:56.450
I said, “I am sorry, not so many.

30:56.450 --> 30:57.590
I am sorry for them."

30:57.590 --> 31:02.190
He said, “I have a friend who has a Nobel
Prize and he has developed this thing ,and

31:02.190 --> 31:03.510
he’s got a Nobel prize.

31:03.510 --> 31:05.380
Oh, he’s so blind, he’s so blind!

31:05.380 --> 31:09.630
He doesn’t know Who has given him this power,
how has he got this.

31:09.630 --> 31:12.490
Who has made this universe, he doesn’t know.

31:12.490 --> 31:15.600
But how can you talk to him?”

31:15.600 --> 31:16.600
I said, “He’ll come.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.120
He’ll come when many will be there.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.270
Then they start thinking, “Oh, so many have
gone?

31:20.270 --> 31:21.950
Let’s also follow!’”

31:21.950 --> 31:24.760
But the transformation is the only way which
is the most convincing.

31:24.760 --> 31:30.310
If there is no transformation in you, who
is going to believe in Sahaja Yoga or in me?

31:30.310 --> 31:33.240
Like many people who know me personally say
that “You are unique.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.240
You are different.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.330
But we can’t believe that you can transform
people."

31:36.330 --> 31:37.330
I am not transforming.

31:37.330 --> 31:38.330
There is already all [the] arrangements there!

31:38.330 --> 31:41.380
All the cord is there, just to put to the
plug to the mains!

31:41.380 --> 31:43.080
That’s all I am doing.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.260
I am not transforming them!

31:44.260 --> 31:47.540
You are just ready for it and it works out.

31:47.540 --> 31:48.540
So please take your Realisation.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.540
Maintain it.

31:49.540 --> 31:50.540
And receive that glory which is meant for
you.

31:50.540 --> 31:51.540
May God bless you.

31:51.540 --> 31:52.540
Questions, please.

31:52.540 --> 31:53.540
Not nonsensical, “I read in a book of a
tantric…” and this and that.

31:53.540 --> 32:06.840
All that I don’t want to discuss any library
and any controversial points.

32:06.840 --> 32:11.940
Please ask something sensible.

32:11.940 --> 32:14.250
And I think you will know what to ask.

32:14.250 --> 32:15.250
Thank you.

32:15.250 --> 32:23.150
Thank you very much.

32:23.150 --> 32:24.910
Without any fear, I am your Mother.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.470
I am not a guru.

32:26.470 --> 32:28.020
Absolutely, I am your Mother.

32:28.020 --> 32:29.310
You are your own guru.

32:29.310 --> 32:34.780
Only thing [is] I have to give you the keys
of your gurudom, that’s all.

32:34.780 --> 32:41.930
Just ask me a very simple question, coming
from simplicity, not complicated.

32:41.930 --> 32:45.070
How many!

32:45.070 --> 32:56.040
I must say we got fifty people.

32:56.040 --> 33:07.020
Just I had gone for a wedding.

33:07.020 --> 33:09.950
Imagine, to have fifty people Realised.

33:09.950 --> 33:11.970
And such great love.

33:11.970 --> 33:13.050
You don’t know how much.

33:13.050 --> 33:14.860
And the recognition is so great.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.070
I mean, I was amazed at those people.

33:16.070 --> 33:17.870
I think poverty is a blessing in a way.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.670
Wonderful people, very beautiful.

33:19.670 --> 33:20.670
Questions please.

33:20.670 --> 33:25.130
I mean, many of you cannot think because your
Kundalini has crossed this (Agnya).

33:25.130 --> 33:38.310
When it crosses Agnya, you cannot think.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.910
You go into thoughtless awareness, so you
just cannot think.

33:40.910 --> 33:43.810
Even if you want, you cannot think, that’s
the problem.

33:43.810 --> 33:44.851
So just try to think!

33:44.851 --> 33:51.270
This is your own Kundalini which is transforming.

33:51.270 --> 34:02.350
In Australia today, I received a trunk call
from Australia and they said, “Mother, we

34:02.350 --> 34:04.440
don’t have to say anything about anything.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.810
Just the Kundalini does the job!”

34:05.810 --> 34:09.310
Now these Australians were supposed to be
convicts and things!

34:09.310 --> 34:11.790
Imagine their children are doing such wonders!

34:11.790 --> 34:12.900
Much more than in England, for your information.

34:12.900 --> 34:13.900
Two boys came to India, two of them, and they
have got now two hundred people.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.720
Hm, what is it, what is it?( Somebody asks
a question.)

34:16.720 --> 34:20.340
What is he saying?

34:20.340 --> 34:26.440
“I, I, I” I only hear “I, I, I."

34:26.440 --> 34:43.580
Yogi: He says there are lots of people he
knows in Birmingham who feel in a similar

34:43.580 --> 34:49.629
way, that they have given up.

34:49.629 --> 34:56.690
They have been disappointed and given up.

34:56.690 --> 34:59.540
Shri Mataji: What is disappointment?

34:59.540 --> 35:01.360
Is it selling something here?

35:01.360 --> 35:03.610
Your whole attitude is of ego.

35:03.610 --> 35:06.260
We are disappointment in you or in me?

35:06.260 --> 35:08.910
Yogi: No he says other people, not him.

35:08.910 --> 35:10.410
People he knows.

35:10.410 --> 35:13.800
Shri Mataji: What are they disappointed?

35:13.800 --> 35:22.050
Seeker: They just talk about life and different
things, you know.

35:22.050 --> 35:25.050
Things don’t work out.

35:25.050 --> 35:29.310
Shri Mataji: What is it?

35:29.310 --> 35:33.170
Related to them.

35:33.170 --> 35:34.450
No.

35:34.450 --> 35:37.030
Isn’t it?

35:37.030 --> 35:57.610
Seeker: A lot of people around us feel how
confused and corrupt and other things, you

35:57.610 --> 35:58.890
know.

35:58.890 --> 36:09.260
And we are part of them.

36:09.260 --> 36:35.720
How I am now, I’ll tell you the truth, I’m
declining and I don’t like it.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.110
This here, to me, is like a last chance, you
know, for me trying to understand this world.

36:37.110 --> 36:38.110
Shri Mataji: Alright.

36:38.110 --> 36:39.110
You are a very nice boy.

36:39.110 --> 36:40.110
And this should work out.

36:40.110 --> 36:43.180
Now what you said is correct but even if you
want to love somebody, people don’t like

36:43.180 --> 36:44.180
it.

36:44.180 --> 36:45.180
You see, they want to hate.

36:45.180 --> 36:46.180
This is possible.

36:46.180 --> 36:47.180
I do not say.

36:47.180 --> 36:48.520
But now how to make people love?

36:48.520 --> 36:53.770
Even when we love somebody, we do not love
the way it should be Divine.

36:53.770 --> 36:57.400
The Divine love is something like the sap
rising in the tree.

36:57.400 --> 37:04.470
It goes to every part of the tree, goes to
all the flowers, doesn’t get attached to

37:04.470 --> 37:05.790
any one and comes back.

37:05.790 --> 37:11.281
Supposing it gets attached to one flower,
“This is my flower, my child, my son, my

37:11.281 --> 37:13.570
community, my, my, my."

37:13.570 --> 37:14.570
Alright?

37:14.570 --> 37:15.570
It’s finished.

37:15.570 --> 37:19.160
The tree is finished, the flower is finished.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.160
Alright?

37:20.160 --> 37:21.350
So the Divine love is, is all-pervading.

37:21.350 --> 37:22.730
It exists all the time.

37:22.730 --> 37:23.990
It articulates within us.

37:23.990 --> 37:25.810
But still we are not feeling it.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.870
Like I would say there is ether here.

37:27.870 --> 37:32.400
There are lots of scenes and sceneries here,
but we cannot see.

37:32.400 --> 37:36.470
When you just plug a television, you start
seeing them, catching them.

37:36.470 --> 37:41.970
In the same way, your television is not yet
plugged, that’s why people are disappointed.

37:41.970 --> 37:46.320
You are disappointed actually in yourself
because you find that, “What is this instrument

37:46.320 --> 37:47.590
for?”

37:47.590 --> 37:49.671
Sometimes it is loved by somebody.

37:49.671 --> 37:51.770
Somebody it is thrown by somebody.

37:51.770 --> 37:55.320
Somebody tries to mishandle sometimes.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.320
Somebody wants to fondle it.

37:56.320 --> 38:00.550
What sort of an instrument is this one?

38:00.550 --> 38:08.040
But then you reach a point where you become
the Spirit, and the Spirit enjoys itself.

38:08.040 --> 38:12.300
The joy the Spirit has is enjoying itself
all the time.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.300
Our Spirit is enjoying itself.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.780
It is not bothered whether other loves you
or not.

38:14.780 --> 38:15.840
It doesn’t bother.

38:15.840 --> 38:19.060
The Spirit in your heart enjoys itself.

38:19.060 --> 38:20.060
Alright?

38:20.060 --> 38:21.970
But what happens [is that] we are not aware
of it.

38:21.970 --> 38:28.760
So when this thing happens to you, your attention
becomes enlightened by that enjoyment of the

38:28.760 --> 38:30.590
Spirit and you enjoy.

38:30.590 --> 38:32.400
You become a different person all together.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.970
You forget all this.

38:33.970 --> 38:38.820
All these discriminations, nonsenses, everything
drops out just like that because you become

38:38.820 --> 38:40.260
that Universal Being.

38:40.260 --> 38:43.670
This is not talking only, my child, it is
happening.

38:43.670 --> 38:45.200
It has to happen.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.830
When it will happen, you will see the whole
world will be changed.

38:48.830 --> 38:49.830
That has to change.

38:49.830 --> 38:54.920
After all, God never created some place here
and some place there, He created one universe

38:54.920 --> 38:55.920
and one world.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.820
It is human beings madly, they have changed
[it].

38:58.820 --> 39:00.760
“Now this is your territory, this is mine!”

39:00.760 --> 39:01.760
It’s all falsehood!

39:01.760 --> 39:02.760
To me it is a myth.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.900
You know, till the end I had to go to Portugal.

39:04.900 --> 39:07.570
I had not taken my visa – can you imagine?

39:07.570 --> 39:08.570
– in the morning.

39:08.570 --> 39:10.980
Then they asked me, “What about your visa?”

39:10.980 --> 39:12.250
I said, “What visa?”

39:12.250 --> 39:13.250
“To Portugal."

39:13.250 --> 39:14.490
I said, “I never do.

39:14.490 --> 39:16.090
I have to take visa?”

39:16.090 --> 39:17.090
He said, “Of course you have to take a visa!”

39:17.090 --> 39:18.540
So in the morning, you see, everybody has
to rush from my husband’s office to get

39:18.540 --> 39:19.540
their visa.

39:19.540 --> 39:21.590
I just travel just like that.

39:21.590 --> 39:22.590
I thought, “What is the need?”

39:22.590 --> 39:25.220
Like a criminal carrying the number of your
passport and everything.

39:25.220 --> 39:26.220
Isn’t it funny?

39:26.220 --> 39:31.340
Imagine to a person like me who is absolutely
naive in human affairs.

39:31.340 --> 39:32.340
It’s absurd.

39:32.340 --> 39:33.440
Why to carry on this?

39:33.440 --> 39:42.140
After all, we are all human beings created
by one God, on one Earth, in complete unison.

39:42.140 --> 39:45.420
We are part and parcel of that one Primordial
Being.

39:45.420 --> 39:48.360
We are cells in that body of that Great Being.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.460
And we are fragmented.

39:50.460 --> 39:58.311
That’s why, once you know that you are the
part of that, your fragmentation goes away

39:58.311 --> 40:01.120
and you become that.

40:01.120 --> 40:03.000
You become that.

40:03.000 --> 40:09.650
Then all your sense of security is established,
all your self-esteem is established, all your

40:09.650 --> 40:12.360
glory comes to you and you start distributing
it.

40:12.360 --> 40:16.990
I say [that] this is the meeting point of
capitalism into to communism.

40:16.990 --> 40:21.750
When you have no capitalism means in the sense
you have no capital of your own.

40:21.750 --> 40:22.990
After all these capitals, all will vanish.

40:22.990 --> 40:23.990
This is useless.

40:23.990 --> 40:27.890
But the capital of your Spirit, when you have,
you distribute.

40:27.890 --> 40:28.890
You give.

40:28.890 --> 40:29.960
That’s the greatest communism.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.920
You can’t live without it.

40:31.920 --> 40:34.280
You have to distribute your love.

40:34.280 --> 40:39.210
See if I don’t get any human beings then
I’ll get some plants or something or some

40:39.210 --> 40:40.210
flowers, I’ll try to love them.

40:40.210 --> 40:41.210
It’s like that.

40:41.210 --> 40:42.240
Alright?

40:42.240 --> 40:46.300
You just wait and see.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.330
And you get all of them who are disappointed
for nothing at all.

40:49.330 --> 40:50.730
Their connections are loose still.

40:50.730 --> 40:54.980
I have to just screw them up a little.

40:54.980 --> 40:56.140
Alright?

40:56.140 --> 40:57.309
( laughing)

40:57.309 --> 41:01.440
Not to get disappointed my child the Reality
is so beautiful.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.560
It’s just lying ahead of us.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.580
Don’t be worried.

41:04.580 --> 41:06.610
Everything is going to be alright.

41:06.610 --> 41:07.610
Alright?

41:07.610 --> 41:08.610
May God bless you.

41:08.610 --> 41:09.650
Now any other question?

41:09.650 --> 41:11.150
What a sweet thing to say, isn’t it?

41:11.150 --> 41:12.150
You want to ask some questions?

41:12.150 --> 41:17.970
Lady seeker: Can you tell us about death?

41:17.970 --> 41:21.330
Shri Mataji: Death?

41:21.330 --> 41:24.690
Lady seeker: Yes

41:24.690 --> 41:33.650
Shri Mataji: Now, why of all the things?

41:33.650 --> 41:38.130
Alright, I’ll tell you.

41:38.130 --> 41:41.490
Death doesn’t exist.

41:41.490 --> 41:45.970
There’s nothing like death.

41:45.970 --> 41:50.950
We are made of five cocoons, you see.

41:50.950 --> 41:57.410
One of them is the cocoon of food called as
annamay kosh (अन्नमय कोश

41:57.410 --> 41:58.740
– made from food).

41:58.740 --> 42:02.600
Only that drops out (on death).

42:02.600 --> 42:06.200
And also a little bit of water within us also
drops out.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.400
The rest of it remains.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.400
Nothing to die!

42:08.400 --> 42:11.980
I wish we could die but we cannot!

42:11.980 --> 42:16.120
(laughing) It’s just changing of cloths!

42:16.120 --> 42:23.070
Like when I came to Birmingham, I just changed
my clothes in the hotel and came here: to

42:23.070 --> 42:25.400
be refreshed, to be new.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.400
It’s just like that.

42:26.400 --> 42:33.570
As our clothes become dirty, we change them,
or become old, we just change it.

42:33.570 --> 42:34.960
That’s all.

42:34.960 --> 42:39.119
Death doesn’t exist, it’s a myth.

42:39.119 --> 42:43.690
But we believe – you see, this is another
conception – that by dying we solve the

42:43.690 --> 42:44.690
problem.

42:44.690 --> 42:49.600
Like we had some Swedish girls, much younger,
seventeen year old girls and they had vibrations

42:49.600 --> 42:50.640
just like a dead body!

42:50.640 --> 42:51.640
I was amazed.

42:51.640 --> 42:55.450
I called them in my house and I said, “What’s
the matter with you?

42:55.450 --> 42:58.870
Why are you having such vibrations?

42:58.870 --> 42:59.870
What are you doing?

42:59.870 --> 43:00.870
What is your pastime?”

43:00.870 --> 43:03.460
They said, “Mother, our main thing is that
we are planning how to commit suicide!”

43:03.460 --> 43:04.950
Can you imagine?

43:04.950 --> 43:07.430
Sweden, the most affluent country.

43:07.430 --> 43:17.650
The young girls of seventeen years, blossoming
like flowers, should think of their death.

43:17.650 --> 43:18.780
Why?

43:18.780 --> 43:20.280
Because what does not die, is your Spirit.

43:20.280 --> 43:24.880
You seek your Spirit.

43:24.880 --> 43:33.840
That’s why people want death because they
have not found that eternal thing.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.210
Nothing dies.

43:35.210 --> 43:37.270
It’s a myth.

43:37.270 --> 43:45.780
You should think of life and of eternal life.

43:45.780 --> 43:56.310
If we really want to be sensible, we should
really not think of death because then we

43:56.310 --> 44:00.410
go onto the left hand side, onto the subconscious,
then into the collective subconscious.

44:00.410 --> 44:05.501
Like these, you must have seen these supernatural
business going on, you see, and then you can

44:05.501 --> 44:09.690
be possessed by them and you can be very much
in trouble.

44:09.690 --> 44:16.290
Now practically every day I must be driving
them out in thousands, can you imagine?

44:16.290 --> 44:24.010
Yesterday I went to a place where there were
all installed there very nicely, some old

44:24.010 --> 44:25.900
johnnies sitting there still.

44:25.900 --> 44:29.180
I said, “Now, why don’t you depart and
take your births?

44:29.180 --> 44:30.180
Or go to your own places?”

44:30.180 --> 44:31.690
They just don’t want to go.

44:31.690 --> 44:35.970
They act as, what you call, these spirits
and things like that.

44:35.970 --> 44:37.640
So forget it.

44:37.640 --> 44:41.830
We have to live in the present because it’s
the most beautiful thing, absolutely beauty.

44:41.830 --> 44:52.330
What is in death?

44:52.330 --> 44:54.630
Nothing to be so serious.

44:54.630 --> 44:57.560
Cheerfulness is the sign of life.

44:57.560 --> 45:02.050
What are you all upset about so much?

45:02.050 --> 45:05.150
What is your problem?

45:05.150 --> 45:09.560
Now tell me.

45:09.560 --> 45:18.520
All the problems can be solved if you get
your Realisation, believe me, even so called

45:18.520 --> 45:20.350
material problems.

45:20.350 --> 45:22.970
Not to that extent.

45:22.970 --> 45:30.750
You will not become [Mr.] Fords but you will
be satisfied souls and also you will have

45:30.750 --> 45:31.750
sufficient.

45:31.750 --> 45:33.200
“Yoga kshema vahamyaham”, Krishna has
said.

45:33.200 --> 45:36.020
(meaning) “When you get your yoga, I look
after your wellbeing."

45:36.020 --> 45:37.460
Your physical, mental, emotional and your
material, everything He looks after.

45:37.460 --> 45:38.460
Alright?

45:38.460 --> 45:39.460
It’s assured!

45:39.460 --> 45:41.360
Seeker: Now matter which way it comes to you
and it’s true, you recognise the person.

45:41.360 --> 45:48.220
Shri Mataji: You do recognise?

45:48.220 --> 46:03.510
May God bless you for that.

46:03.510 --> 46:08.650
You are very sensitive because people don’t.

46:08.650 --> 46:11.920
If they had recognised, why did they crucify
Christ?

46:11.920 --> 46:17.480
Just imagine these thugs whom we are giving
so much of money and people are going to them,

46:17.480 --> 46:21.720
and the nonsensical people, how they are using
your women and all sorts of life they are

46:21.720 --> 46:25.890
leading, and how we have surrendered to them
with all of our intelligence and rationality

46:25.890 --> 46:26.890
and to Christ?

46:26.890 --> 46:29.569
What did we give Him is a cross?

46:29.569 --> 46:33.700
You have to really have a proper sensitivity
to understand Truth, really.

46:33.700 --> 46:36.720
Otherwise normally people are naive.

46:36.720 --> 46:43.670
If somebody comes with two horns, they like
that person much more than a normal person.

46:43.670 --> 46:49.460
One must carry a circus, you know!

46:49.460 --> 46:51.731
The circus is on.

46:51.731 --> 46:55.230
Truth is something which doesn’t require
any adoration with it – nothing.

46:55.230 --> 47:01.800
It shines by itself.

47:01.800 --> 47:08.080
And there are many Realised-souls born on
this land of your England like these children

47:08.080 --> 47:09.080
are.

47:09.080 --> 47:12.970
They are all born realised and they have feelings
and some of them are born with the knowledge

47:12.970 --> 47:15.500
of Kundalini – many, many.

47:15.500 --> 47:22.310
You don’t know what dynamic people are going
to [be] born in this country, very dynamic.

47:22.310 --> 47:30.980
We have already had a birth of a very dynamic
person in London.

47:30.980 --> 47:32.970
Ask these children.

47:32.970 --> 47:35.450
They are must be getting cool breeze.

47:35.450 --> 47:36.450
Are you getting cool breeze my children?

47:36.450 --> 47:37.450
In the hand?

47:37.450 --> 47:38.450
Is he?

47:38.450 --> 47:39.450
What is he saying?

47:39.450 --> 47:41.120
Yogini: Not too cool

47:41.120 --> 47:43.690
Shri Mataji: Not too good?

47:43.690 --> 47:49.030
But still it is coming, yah?

47:49.030 --> 47:55.080
See they never will be satisfied because other
vibrations are also here.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.320
Now, what about you?

47:57.320 --> 47:59.010
Let’s see.

47:59.010 --> 48:02.380
Just see, not yet?

48:02.380 --> 48:07.440
Put your hands just like this.

48:07.440 --> 48:09.130
Let’s see?

48:09.130 --> 48:10.130
Please put your hands like this.

48:10.130 --> 48:11.130
Just like that.

48:11.130 --> 48:15.300
Put both the feet straight and sit very comfortably
but with a little alertness.

48:15.300 --> 48:16.630
Straight, like this.

48:16.630 --> 48:19.160
Just like this.

48:19.160 --> 48:21.280
You start receiving that through your fingers.

48:21.280 --> 48:24.900
And an invitation is sent to the Kundalini
when She rises.

48:24.900 --> 48:31.740
And now close your eyes.

48:31.740 --> 48:56.740
Please close your eyes.

48:56.740 --> 49:02.630
Now what happens is that you start feeling
a cool breeze on your hand, through your fingers.

49:02.630 --> 49:07.380
A kind of a cool breeze which is known as
“The cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”.

49:07.380 --> 49:14.640
That is the first thing, that’s the first
symptom.

49:14.640 --> 49:19.250
Put your both the feet on the ground.

49:19.250 --> 49:20.670
Touching [the ground] if possible.

49:20.670 --> 49:23.520
If they cannot touch, it’s alright, but
normally [they should].

49:23.520 --> 49:26.180
And little apart.

49:26.180 --> 49:31.060
Don’t open your eyes.

49:31.060 --> 49:35.950
Just keep them [closed].

49:35.950 --> 49:49.090
It will be alright.

49:49.090 --> 49:54.000
Do not think.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.359
Do not think.

49:56.359 --> 49:57.359
Thinking should be finished.

49:57.359 --> 49:59.670
If it is not finished then open your eyes
and watch me.

49:59.670 --> 50:02.590
If there is no thought coming then it is alright.

50:02.590 --> 50:04.880
Just open your eyes and watch me without thinking.

50:04.880 --> 50:08.830
You can do it.

50:08.830 --> 50:10.680
Better?

50:10.680 --> 50:18.070
Watch me without thinking.

50:18.070 --> 50:25.450
Got a Hamsa [catch].

50:25.450 --> 50:33.200
Now don’t worry about declining and all
that.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.200
Alright?

50:34.200 --> 50:35.700
Don’t feel guilty about anything.

50:35.700 --> 50:38.620
Because I am talking about the ocean of love.

50:38.620 --> 50:41.390
You see, you are standing before the ocean.

50:41.390 --> 50:43.190
Now what is your guilt?

50:43.190 --> 50:45.300
It’s just a spec.

50:45.300 --> 50:46.300
Alright?

50:46.300 --> 50:47.300
Now forget it.

50:47.300 --> 50:48.300
Close your eyes.

50:48.300 --> 50:50.920
Now don’t think about any guilts or anything
like that.

50:50.920 --> 50:59.109
That’s a nonsensical thing, absolutely nonsensical
because compared to the ocean of forgiveness,

50:59.109 --> 51:00.109
what is a guilt?

51:00.109 --> 51:01.109
Just forget it.

51:01.109 --> 51:04.160
You are going to just get it.

51:04.160 --> 51:07.320
It’s freely being distributed.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.700
It’s your own.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.380
Do not condemn yourself.

51:12.380 --> 51:20.440
This is the temple of God.

51:20.440 --> 51:28.500
Love yourself, first of all, respect.

51:28.500 --> 51:31.180
Now better.

51:31.180 --> 51:37.900
Close your eyes my child.

51:37.900 --> 51:41.930
Close your eyes.

51:41.930 --> 51:51.330
You must get it to understand everything.

51:51.330 --> 51:53.980
We have to forgive others.

51:53.980 --> 51:54.990
Just forgive.

51:54.990 --> 51:57.220
We must know that it’s a myth.

51:57.220 --> 51:59.700
If we do not forgive, also, we are just torturing
ourselves.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.390
We are not torturing anybody else.

52:01.390 --> 52:03.120
Just forgive everyone.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.420
Just say, “I forgive."

52:05.420 --> 52:06.859
Then only we can ask for forgiveness, isn’t
it?

52:06.859 --> 52:12.630
You just forgive and then ask for forgiveness
from God, that, “By mistake if I have done

52:12.630 --> 52:20.400
any mistake, by any sort of aggression or
any torture, or anything – please forgive

52:20.400 --> 52:21.400
me."

52:21.400 --> 52:23.140
And He forgives.

52:23.140 --> 52:24.510
Just forgive.

52:24.510 --> 52:27.330
Ask for His forgiveness and He’ll forgive.

52:27.330 --> 52:28.540
Nothing needed.

52:28.540 --> 52:34.940
Just to ask for it and He will do it.

52:34.940 --> 52:42.530
But do not condemn yourself because your Father,
the almighty Lord has created you and He cannot

52:42.530 --> 52:48.680
make any mistakes.

52:48.680 --> 52:52.310
You might have done some wrong but doesn’t
matter.

52:52.310 --> 53:01.410
Sakshat Shiva Parvati, Om Sakshat Shiva Parvati,
Om Sakshat Shiva Parvati

53:01.410 --> 53:06.370
Om Sakshat Atmam, Om Sakshat Atmam.

53:06.370 --> 53:10.910
Please pay attention to your heart now.

53:10.910 --> 53:21.240
And just say, “I am the Spirit."
