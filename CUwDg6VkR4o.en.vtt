00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:13.664
Whatever you do, it should please me,
it’s one of the ways. It should please me.

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:21.680
That’s one of the signs.
So how do we do it?

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:27.509
Put me in your heart! Just try to put me
in your heart, it’s very simple.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.259
I am before you now. I am in person.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.977
When I am a Mahamaya, I know I am, I had to be.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:47.334
But you have to put my feet into your heart.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:58.383
Just my feet into your heart.

00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:06.263
Because photo, face, everything might be
an illusion.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.082
Might be by seeing my face,
you do not get over your barriers.

00:01:17.603 --> 00:01:19.834
Mother, please come in my heart.

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:22.900
Let me clean my heart so that you are there.

00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:27.096
Put your feet into my heart.

00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:33.413
Let your feet be worshipped in my heart.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:37.545
Let me not be in delusion.

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.184
Take me away from illusions.

00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:43.869
Keep me in reality.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.951
Take away the sheen of superficiality.

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:52.980
Let me enjoy your feet in my heart.

00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:57.916
Let me see your feet in my heart.

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:01.754
Only such people.

00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:05.358
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha have done that.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:09.212
So don’t you think you have to do it?

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.346
So humble down yourself!

00:02:14.547 --> 00:02:18.322
Humble down yourself in your heart.

00:02:18.523 --> 00:02:20.591
Humble down in your heart.

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:25.173
Enjoy your humility. Enjoy your virtues.

00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:29.043
The greatest virtue of a Sahaj Yogi is humility.
