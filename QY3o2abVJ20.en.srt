1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,290
I had a special purpose in coming to Ganpatipule, apart from that it was a very beautiful place
and very relaxing for all of you.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:20,960
The reason is – I found this place had vibrations
which will clear you out very easily, first

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,970
of all.

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,650
But you have to desire it, really, ardently.

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,320
You should have that desire otherwise the
Kundalini may not rise.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,390
That is a very important point; that you have
to desire your ascent, nothing else.

7
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:44,039
It’s not a place you have come for a holiday
or just for some sort of a relaxation or for

8
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:54,590
some enjoyment or sleeping or anything, but
you have come here for a penance, for a tapasya,

9
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,519
to clear out yourself completely.

10
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:07,890
This is a place of Shri Ganesha’s temple
which is not very much frequented by people

11
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,470
and it’s still very, very pure.

12
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,930
And I thought that the Ganesh principle will
be awakened in you which is the source of

13
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,930
everything.

14
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:29,820
Shri Ganesha’s principle, as you know, in
a very large way or expansive way, we call

15
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,990
it ‘the innocence’, but we do not know
the intricacies and the details to which it

16
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,250
can go and work it out.

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:48,660
Shri Ganesha’s innocence has a tremendous
power to purify people, to make you holy,

18
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,060
to make you auspicious.

19
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,520
A person who has got Shri Ganesha’s principle
awakened is auspicious in his presence.

20
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,390
Such a person, whenever he moves, things move
in a direction that the coefficience works

21
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:12,140
out, it becomes absolutely auspicious; auspiciousness
which cannot be achieved without Shri Ganesha’s

22
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,140
help.

23
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,560
Now this auspiciousness, now we Sahaja Yogis
believe into; that there is something like

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,520
auspiciousness by which everything works out
smoothly.

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,340
Everything we feel is done by God’s power,
that we are all the time wanted by nature,

26
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,040
loved by surroundings and the atmosphere.

27
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,840
But this understanding can only come if you
have that pure desire within you, that you

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
have to ascend.

29
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,189
You have come here to ascend, not to enjoy
yourself or a place of resort or something

30
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,129
like that.

31
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:59,239
This principle is very much awakened, as you
see, in the local people here.

32
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,549
And how spartan they are, how hard working.

33
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:08,499
They’ve been awake for days together and
nights together but still they are very, very

34
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:13,209
relaxed and they do not need any help.

35
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,779
Just in that enthusiasm they are working out!

36
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:24,310
So the second blessing of Ganesha is that
He’s playful, He’s prasanna, He’s always

37
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,840
a pleasing personality.

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,659
He dances.

39
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,299
He pleases you.

40
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,590
He has ways and methods of pleasing you.

41
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,620
And in the same way, a person who has that
awakened Ganesha within him is all the time

42
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,129
a very pleasing personality, not a drawn-out
face, not a face that repels you, the face

43
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:57,959
that makes you feel unhappy, but is a personality
that makes you very easy, very understandable,

44
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,450
likeable: that sort of a personality you develop.

45
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:11,269
But, so far as the life has been abroad, I
have seen that the situation has been very

46
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:12,269
different.

47
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:22,270
And the aggressiveness and the quarrelsomeness,
we can say, the hurting capacity, is so over-developed

48
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:32,710
that you have to somehow or other, succumb
completely to the auspiciousness of Shri Ganesha.

49
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,830
Because all the instruments that were to be
used for spreading Sahaja Yoga or for spreading

50
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:45,389
the love of God, for spreading auspiciousness
of God, working out His designs and plans

51
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:54,300
and adjusting yourself to the laws of God’s
desires – it was very important that we

52
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:03,080
should have had our instruments done in such
a way that they were absolutely useful.

53
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:12,840
On the contrary we have misused them, spoiled
them and have completely made them unholy.

54
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,270
So that’s another point: we have to look
at ourselves here, what have we been doing

55
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:25,639
to ourselves, what is the need for us to make
ourselves unholy and why should we be unholy.

56
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,849
When Shri Ganesha is there, we can make ourselves
very holy, auspicious.

57
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,940
Now no use believing that we are perfect!

58
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,990
Those who believe like that cannot ascend.

59
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,240
Everybody must know there are lots of imperfections
and, “These imperfections in me that are

60
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
[there] should be conquered and [are] to be
found out."

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,660
Only in the light of Shri Ganesha’s innocence
you can see.

62
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:55,950
A little child can show you how we are stupid
and foolish and how we behave.

63
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,229
So many times you must have seen [that] children
come out with such utterances that the elders

64
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,920
are put to shame!

65
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:14,449
So the child-like temperament can be developed
if we awaken the Shri Ganesha’s principle

66
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:22,110
within ourselves; which is a very, very powerful,
very, very powerful Deity.

67
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,319
A very powerful Deity.

68
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:36,650
Because a child, supposing one child is lost,
say a child runs away or if a child is hanging

69
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:43,939
somewhere on a tree – the whole community
will rush to take out the child, the concern

70
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,460
will be there.

71
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,110
Even in the Western countries, I have seen,
if one little girl is tortured, everybody

72
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,349
is worried about the child, everybody opposes
that.

73
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:59,520
Maybe there are some horrible people, no doubt,
maybe there are more than they are here, but

74
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,330
one gets concerned.

75
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:14,080
So a child, itself, is a very sort of a source
of getting all the protection from everywhere.

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,300
Because the child is growing, the child is
growing.

77
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,030
Everybody wants to help the child.

78
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:26,580
So in the same way when this Ganesha principle
is developed into you, you realise that you

79
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,099
have to grow, you are still growing.

80
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:35,949
A little child learns so many words in such
a short time that we cannot learn afterwards

81
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:36,949
when we are grown up.

82
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:42,740
Say, after sixty, if you have to learn even
three sentences, it’s impossible!

83
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:49,560
So the child is growing and his curiosity
and his capacity to know more things is also

84
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,129
very much sharp and he starts learning more.

85
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:55,419
He doesn’t think he knows everything.

86
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,810
The ones who think like that are not yet born
properly.

87
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,530
“I don’t know anything!

88
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,599
I have to know this, I have to know that.

89
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,599
I have to know that.

90
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,960
I don’t know anything so far."

91
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,069
And the children do it so easily you must
have seen.

92
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:18,719
A little bit you do this way or that way,
they immediately follow you.

93
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:24,080
So what you have to do is to know that you
are still in a child stage, you are growing.

94
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,930
We have to humble down and we have to know
a lot.

95
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,320
And from wherever we have to know, we have
to know.

96
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,870
The arrogance, the idea that we know a lot
itself is very, very dangerous for the growth,

97
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,650
very dangerous.

98
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,740
And that is what one has to give up and should
know that we do not know anything but we have

99
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,930
to know.

100
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,310
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga settle
down as, “We are Sahaja Yogis,” but don’t

101
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,930
know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

102
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,930
So many of them!

103
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,230
Specially the ladies, I am surprised.

104
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,310
They know very little about Sahaja Yoga.

105
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,310
It’s rather surprising.

106
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,000
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s nothing like
women or men, everybody has equal rights.

107
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,680
It’s not the job of women just to sing songs.

108
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
No!

109
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
It’s not!

110
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,430
They have to know each and everything about
Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,730
They have to know what are the diseases, how
they are cured, what are the mental problems,

112
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,860
how are these chakras are made.

113
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,860
Everything they have to know.

114
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,830
The medicines they have to know, the psychology.

115
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,570
They have to know the Divine powers.

116
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,560
Everything they have to know, how it works
out.

117
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,779
And that ignorance will never be forgiven
because you are the ones who have to talk

118
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,660
about it to others.

119
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,390
The third thing is: a child is never a silly
person, never silly.

120
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,310
He never does something in a silly way.

121
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,250
While you see many people who are brought
up in a very strict way become suddenly very

122
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,270
silly at an old age.

123
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,270
Very silly.

124
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,170
This phenomenon I see much more in the West.

125
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:59,410
Suddenly they become, trying to be very youngish-type
and just they’ll clap like this and start

126
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,149
behaving in a very funny manner.

127
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:03,449
I used to wonder, “What’s wrong with them?

128
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:05,310
Why are they behaving like this?”

129
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,720
But it is, I think they are bottled up.

130
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,790
And then suddenly they try to behave.

131
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,130
But they (children) are not.

132
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,980
A child is never a silly person.

133
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,180
On the contrary, if there’s somebody silly
they said, “He’s a clown!”

134
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,000
They’ll come and tell me, “He’s a clown,
you know.

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,170
He’s not all right!” or, “He’s a buffoon!”

136
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,170
Whatever words they know they’ll express.

137
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,779
They don’t like [it].

138
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:33,220
They start wondering, “What’s the matter
with this person?”

139
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:41,670
So all these things come to us because we
have no idea that we have to grow in a steady,

140
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,970
understanding awareness, awareness.

141
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:51,779
Not in how you express yourself in Sahaja
Yoga, how you do things in Sahaja Yoga.

142
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:58,220
It is how you are aware of it inside.

143
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:06,389
In the same way emotionally: when I say something,
I don’t think people understand what I mean.

144
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,050
Now I said that, “You put on bindis."

145
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,320
Again I find you are just the same!

146
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,850
At least here you should.

147
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,920
This is Ganesha’s mark.

148
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,840
They would not put it.

149
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,230
It’s so many times I have said it.

150
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,690
I mean, how much time does it take to put
it on?

151
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,680
Now this is a very common things that are
going on.

152
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,130
Now another thing is that a child doesn’t
want to be dishevelled at all.

153
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,300
Today one child had gone for a bath and was
coming back.

154
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,880
His father wanted him to see me, he said,
“No, my clothes are not all right.

155
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,399
my hair are all dishevelled.

156
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,399
How can I see Mother?”

157
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,470
So he went back, he put some oil on his hair,
properly he dressed up, smartly.

158
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,740
When we were young, we always knew all the
Western people were very smartly dressed,

159
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,490
properly groomed.

160
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,960
They would never come with dishevelled hairs.

161
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,100
But he said, “No, my hair [is] all dishevelled,
how can I go and see Mother?”

162
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,430
So we have to give up these funny ideas of
fashions and all that, because this will all

163
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:09,730
go away, you’ll lose your hair, you’ll
all become bald-headed to look very funny.

164
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,070
There’s no wisdom in it.

165
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,250
But a child has wisdom!

166
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,360
He wouldn’t come.

167
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,100
He dressed up himself properly, then he came
and stood before me.

168
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,480
And this is what we have to understand: that
our appearances are the expression of our

169
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,259
inner being and we have to do certain things
because we do not know to accept things, how

170
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,300
to do things like a child does.

171
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:40,160
A child if you tell him anything, he obeys
and he listens.

172
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,899
Otherwise the child is not a normal child.

173
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,660
In India if there’s a child who doesn’t
obey, they just thrash him nicely, put him

174
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,780
in the room for three days, make him starve
and put him right; nothing doing!

175
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,240
That doesn’t mean the people are harsh here
with children.

176
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,050
Nobody kills children or anything.

177
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,519
But you have to be very, very careful with
your children, you shouldn’t allow them

178
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:16,920
to be lousy, to be untidy, to be languid,
like lotus-eaters or like people who have

179
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,620
no smartness about them.

180
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,589
You are all Sahaja Yogis and you have to be
like that in that way.

181
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:30,730
A child’s another attribute is that he hits
always the principle of everything.

182
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,089
Always the principle.

183
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,000
A child sees to the principle of everything.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,050
And the questions they ask sometimes are so
remarkably collective that I am surprised

185
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,120
how they go to that point.

186
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,720
They never waste time in frivolous things,
never.

187
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,339
Never waste time in frivolous things, talking
of frivolous things.

188
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,339
Nothing of the kind.

189
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:56,889
I haven’t seen children talking about their
clothes or about the seats they have got or

190
00:13:56,889 --> 00:13:59,120
the houses – nothing of the kind.

191
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,720
They are busy doing some construction!

192
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Very busy, you see.

193
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,660
You ask them, “What are you doing?”

194
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,550
“You see, we are trying to tie up the whole
of the airport,” or the whole of Bombay,

195
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,779
like that they will tell you.

196
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,080
They are very busy people.

197
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,860
If you see Realised souls who are children,
they are always worried about the collective.

198
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,480
And that’s what should be your situation
that you should be all the time worried about

199
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,920
the collective as a child is: that, “How
I will help the collective?”

200
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,470
But not worried about yourself, “What is
my personality, am I that impressive?

201
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,690
If I go to people, will they believe that
I’m something?

202
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,690
A Realised-soul?

203
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,319
Or I am like other women or other men who
are going to the hairdressers and having all

204
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:48,240
kinds of hairdressing up and wearing all kinds
of funny dresses to impress others?

205
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,420
Am I looking like a saint?

206
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,709
Am I behaving like a saint?”

207
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,970
These things should come to you very easily.

208
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:07,029
If you tell a child, “You are a Sahaja Yogi,”
they say so, “I am a Sahaja Yogi, I can’t

209
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:08,509
do that way!”

210
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:14,060
All the nonsense starts after they develop
their ego.

211
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,339
And then they start behaving in a funny way
and it develops much more in the West earlier,

212
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,140
but here it takes time.

213
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,459
And the children are just accepting whatever
God gives them.

214
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,430
To them alertness is so natural.

215
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,199
If there’s an aeroplane that’s going,
they’ll say, “Bye bye aeroplane."

216
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,040
Then there are ships are going, “Bye bye."

217
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,870
To the sea they’ll say, “All right, sea,
we’ll come and see you tomorrow!”

218
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,029
Everything is within their mind.

219
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,649
To them everything is there.

220
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:46,269
They’ll come, you ask them, “How did you
like it?”

221
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:48,050
“Oh, we liked the grass very much.

222
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,529
It was nice,” and everything they will tell
you, the details about everything.

223
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,449
So alert!

224
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:56,440
And then they will say, “Oh, Why didn’t
you do this?

225
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,950
You could have put some flowers here, you
could have done some flowers, would have looked

226
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,110
nice for the hut."

227
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,380
Or something, a suggestion they will give.

228
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,080
Very particular on cleanliness, anything.

229
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,490
And in childhood children get up very early.

230
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,639
All the children in childhood get up very
early.

231
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,379
It’s a nuisance for mothers but they get
up very early and that’s how I also get

232
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,060
up very early.

233
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,029
Getting up early is a child-like behaviour.

234
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:30,500
Because the birds are singing, the sun is
rising, such beauty in the sky and, “And

235
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,529
Why am I sleeping?”

236
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:33,540
They’ll wake up the whole house!

237
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,390
But people don’t like it, sometimes they
beat, not in India.

238
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,519
In India people try to get up early in the
morning.

239
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,670
It’s regarded as something very dharmic
and good.

240
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,630
Even if we sleep late, we’ll get up early
in the morning, that’s one thing.

241
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,750
Then you can sleep in the daytime.

242
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,110
But nobody sleeps over this thing like nine
o’clock, ten o’clock, nobody sleeps like

243
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,110
that.

244
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,019
I mean, I have a problem, I don’t know what
to do with myself.

245
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:06,100
You can sleep in the daytime for a while if
you want to overcome the night sleep and all.

246
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,370
And you can be quite fresh.

247
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,059
And you can be quite all right in the evening
if you sleep for a while.

248
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,410
But a child doesn’t think too much, he doesn’t
plan too much.

249
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,189
He makes fun out of everything.

250
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,020
You take them anywhere, say, you take them
to an airport.

251
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,610
There’s nothing to be played about [there]!

252
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,679
They’ll find out some groove somewhere,
they’ll jump in that, they’ll hide there,

253
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,679
play there.

254
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,419
They can make play out of any gross stuff
that we think is useless, they’ll make out

255
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,690
of it.

256
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,909
They’re very constructive and playful and
that is what we have to be, Make play out

257
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:40,909
of your life.

258
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:41,909
Everything!

259
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:46,990
You see, meeting people, talking to them:
it should come naturally, not artificially.

260
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,360
Also some people, I have seen, have a habit
of putting up an expression all the time,

261
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,450
like a smile or a frown or this thing.

262
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,309
Children are never like that.

263
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,690
Their muscles are so supple.

264
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,460
They react all the time.

265
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,490
Sometimes when they are happy, when they are
unhappy, everything.

266
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,320
The muscles all the time are acting like that.

267
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
Nobody is tense.

268
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,990
That’s why we have problems with our faces,
because we keep them in one style.

269
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,380
And these days the more miserable, you are
regarded as more handsome!

270
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,920
That’s finished!

271
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,720
Or else some people just go on smiling all
the time like this, it’s very bad.

272
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,190
Or all the time absolutely feeling unhappy.

273
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:39,510
You should allow the action of your emotions
to be expressed on your face.

274
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,730
I am told that it is said that, “There should
be no emotions shown on your faces."

275
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,679
I mean, I can’t understand!

276
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,000
What is the use of such a personality who
doesn’t show any emotions?

277
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,670
I mean, you are not a stone are you?

278
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:59,120
So all these foolish, stupid ideas which are
given to us should be given up.

279
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,120
And we should smile, we should laugh, naturally.

280
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,419
We should talk to people in a natural way.

281
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,860
And the child is extremely dignified.

282
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,880
Shri Ganesha dances with His dignity.

283
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,610
He doesn’t do frivolous, nonsensical things.

284
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:23,860
In His rise and in His fall and in His movements
and His steps, He’s nothing but His weight.

285
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,030
So something cheapish He doesn’t do.

286
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,230
In the same way there should be dignity throughout.

287
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,690
Dignified behaviour should be within us.

288
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,630
Now you have to judge yourself, how far you
have become Shri Ganesha within yourself.

289
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,799
Are you innocent?

290
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,960
You think of cheating others, spoiling others.

291
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,390
Like my television, I was amazed!

292
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,630
I mean, I can never think of spoiling a television
and this and that.

293
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,120
These ideas, from where do they come into
your heads?

294
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Why should we?

295
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,240
I have never done it all my life, something
like that.

296
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,360
You know that I have always paid every duty,
everything.

297
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,261
Why should we do such a nonsensical [thing],
to spoil the television and spoil it, make

298
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:05,600
it look cheaper, for what?

299
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,760
How much are you going to save out of it?

300
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,410
But all these ideas come into your heads,
I just don’t know from where.

301
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,450
Why cheat?

302
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,830
We are Sahaja Yogis.

303
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,309
We cannot cheat anyone.

304
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:20,330
I mean, you can tell the customs, “This
is the situation is.

305
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,299
If you allow we’ll go, otherwise we’ll
stay."

306
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:26,669
It’s a negative attitude.

307
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:27,680
Never comes to children.

308
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,330
They are so plain and simple.

309
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,919
Once we had gone, I must tell you how children
are so simple.

310
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:43,080
Once we had gone inside a port and my nephew
gave me two tins of cheese and we were bringing

311
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,360
it out.

312
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,779
So my daughter who was a very small girl,
so when we were coming and he asked, “Do

313
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:50,779
you have anything?”

314
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:52,970
I said, “We have some two tins of cheese."

315
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,190
“Yes, yes and we’re going to eat it also.

316
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,140
See we have opened one and we are eating!”

317
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,200
The customs fellow was so impressed by her
innocence.

318
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,010
He says, “For your eating?”

319
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,270
“Yes, yes for our eating, we have taken
it.

320
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,460
Is it all right?”

321
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,980
He said, “It’s all right."

322
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:17,659
You see, the simplicity and innocence is itself
a certificate for you,.

323
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:18,740
Not this cunning methods.

324
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,929
What is there?

325
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,220
I mean, precisely on the phone I tell them,
“Oh baba, for heaven’s sake!

326
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,830
I’ll pay every duty, you don’t have to
do anything.

327
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,830
Just put this thing there, tell that it is
mine.

328
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,010
You don’t have to do anything.

329
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,390
Declare it, this that."

330
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,480
Why?

331
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,890
Where is our mind going?

332
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,630
It’s all right!

333
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,270
How much are we going to lose in there?

334
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,409
How much have we gained so far in money?

335
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,740
What do we have?

336
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,810
Saving money here, saving money there.

337
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,679
Children don’t do like that!

338
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,850
No, they don’t.

339
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:06,950
Like my grandson, he was saying, “Why do
you stay in this wretched place?

340
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,720
Very bad vibrations in London!”

341
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,460
I said, “You see, your grandfather has to
stay here for earning money."

342
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,460
He said, “Money?

343
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,309
Why do you need so much money for, why do
you need money, why don’t you come to India?”

344
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:19,539
I said, “You need money."

345
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:23,440
So when my husband came back, he took out
a two-p, he said, “You want money?

346
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Have it!

347
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Now put it on your head!

348
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,300
Why do you want to have money?”

349
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,660
And my husband didn’t know where to look.

350
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,010
“You want money, all right, have it, put
it on your head!”

351
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,090
He was a little boy, you see!

352
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,250
But interest in money starts later on.

353
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:46,460
As soon as there’s money we start looking
at it, when we grow up, otherwise we don’t.

354
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,870
All this money interest starts going later
on.

355
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,030
What is for Ganesha?

356
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,270
Money is the dust of His feet.

357
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,270
What for Him gold?

358
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,930
What for Him anything?

359
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,309
Whether He wears a crown of gold or He doesn’t
wear anything makes no difference!

360
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,309
He’s is there!

361
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:03,000
His head is just the same.

362
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,710
Out of respect, out of adoration, people might
give Him gold or anything just to feel satisfied,

363
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,710
it’s alright.

364
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,300
For Him what does it matter?

365
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:18,990
And any child who is a real child will not
accept anything from anybody else, nothing.

366
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,309
But if he takes, he will think, “How should
I return it back?”

367
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:24,309
Always!

368
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,130
I know my own grandchildren have done it.

369
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,380
If you give them something, they’ll make
a heart, put inside that, write it down nicely

370
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,440
and when I come out of my bathroom, they’ll
give me that heart, you see, that, “Thank

371
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,110
you very much,” for this and that.

372
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,640
But when we grow up we even forget to thank
people, we take everything for granted, we

373
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
don’t have that.

374
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,450
We just think we have to judge everyone all
the time, “That’s not good, this is not

375
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,930
good, could have been better!”

376
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,490
We never think, “This is given to us, be
thankful!”

377
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,830
Count your blessings.

378
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,520
But for children it’s not so.

379
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,900
If you give them a small thing, they’ll
keep it, “This is given to me by my grandmother!”

380
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,289
I have seen this in my own grandchildren.

381
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:15,640
The eldest one when she was small I gave her
a little sari, a very small one just for her

382
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
to wear.

383
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,059
So when I went there she said, “You see,
nani, I must tell you one thing serious is

384
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,059
happening."

385
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,059
I said, “What?”

386
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:27,580
“You see, the sari you gave me, I’ve kept
it very carefully but my mother is trying

387
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
to be funny!”

388
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
I said, “What happened?”

389
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,020
“You know, she didn’t give it to anyone
but she showed it to some people, she should

390
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,440
not have shown it!”

391
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,100
Very seriously!

392
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:42,000
They are so sweet and so beautiful when they
say things.

393
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,590
Like once I had given her a Wendy house and
a Wendy house she made it nicely, she called

394
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,250
her mother, “I have made a very nice house
for you, come along!”

395
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,380
So my daughter is rather tall.

396
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,110
She found it difficult, she went inside the
Wendy house and sat there and she said, “Haa!

397
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,549
So what have you got for me to eat?”

398
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:08,190
She said, “Mummy, when you go to somebody’s
house you don’t say such a thing!”

399
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,190
And she laughed.

400
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,450
And she laughed so much that she broke all
her Wendy house.

401
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:17,030
So she came out and she told Me, “Grandma,
you have not given any good training to your

402
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,690
daughters!

403
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,559
First of all, she comes to my house, asks
funny questions and then she breaks my house,

404
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,200
do you do like this to anyone else?”

405
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,799
How innocent and simple they are!

406
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,630
Like that there are so many things I can tell
you [that] I have seen.

407
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,120
The way they talk and say things, and all
that.

408
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,779
So simple and so good and so collective and
so beautiful.

409
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,920
In the same way we have to be.

410
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,750
Another thing, a child doesn’t have any
fear.

411
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,059
A child doesn’t have any fear.

412
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,590
Ganesha has no fear at all.

413
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,750
In the same way you should have no fear, no
fear at all, no fear.

414
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,990
As long as your Mother is with you why should
you have any fear?

415
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,720
Fear of this, fear of that, “I am frightened."

416
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,120
“I can’t do this,” “I can’t do that."

417
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,030
That children never do.

418
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,460
They’ll try everything, if you tell them.

419
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,000
You should have no fear.

420
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,340
I don’t know what fear is.

421
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,210
In the same way you should have no fear, no
fear of anything.

422
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,429
Nothing is going to go wrong with you.

423
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:27,620
But don’t do wrong things.

424
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,620
If you do wrong things it will repel, it will
work out on you.

425
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,250
But don’t do wrong things, be straight forward
and nothing can harm you, nothing can harm

426
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,250
you.

427
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:43,929
We have had so many experiences of this, how
everywhere laid down for you, everybody is

428
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:45,610
looking after you.

429
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,660
There are so many Deities who are working
out things out for you.

430
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:55,970
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely
careful that you do not develop this fear

431
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,110
business.

432
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,140
Because fear takes you to the Left side and
once you go to the left side, you know the

433
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,140
problems of the Left side is – first of
all -you go against Ganesha.

434
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,590
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

435
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:13,700
And then you develop cancers, you develop
all these things, fear, fear, fear and emotional

436
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,899
problems and all these things come.

437
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:19,919
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

438
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,000
Joy is your emotion.

439
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,049
In action you should be thoughtless.

440
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,250
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

441
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:40,190
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras
are very simple for children.

442
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,149
They are like that.

443
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:56,529
Today at the base of the Shri Ganesha’s
hill, we have to think of awakening the Ganesh

444
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:57,640
tattwa within us.

445
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,419
For that we have to meditate.

446
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:01,660
We have to think about it.

447
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,820
We have to put our time to it.

448
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,919
Actually if I were you, I may not sleep at
all, I will go to the seashore, sit down there,

449
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,320
meditate the whole time!

450
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,722
Before breaking the Sahastrara I kept awake
for two nights and I was just all alone, all

451
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:25,419
alone near the sea, all alone the whole night,
working it out, for two nights.

452
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,221
But what do we do?

453
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:30,950
We think about our comforts, we think about
this, about that.

454
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,120
It’s not so!

455
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
You are here!

456
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,700
Such a chance!

457
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,450
We get tired because we think too much.

458
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:46,480
We know how to get out of this tiredness and
this and that.

459
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,490
So this is a very good chance for you [that]
we have come here.

460
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,660
Of course it’s a beautiful place and all
that.

461
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,320
But it’s mainly the thing why I thought
of bringing you here [is] that it may suddenly

462
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:04,110
give you a big boost up and you might rise
very high; for which I may not be able to

463
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:12,840
really arrange otherwise, this kind of ascent
which is possible.

464
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,000
Many of the Indians have not even seen this
place before.

465
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,250
It’s such a beautiful place and they are
surprised that in India we have such beautiful

466
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,460
places!

467
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:31,590
And after coming here they have felt the beauty,
the auspiciousness, the wisdom of choosing

468
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,919
this place.

469
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,740
It’s so lovable, so beautiful.

470
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,730
But I hope I see the effects of that in you.

471
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,190
Now you have to go and have your food.

472
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,840
We have a very generous man who is cooking
for you.

473
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,660
Be careful!

474
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,760
You shouldn’t spoil your health!

475
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,000
Specially for those who have to go with us
ahead.

476
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,019
So be careful!

477
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,390
They’re very generous people.

478
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,910
My brother and the gentleman who is cooking
for you – both are competing in generosity.

479
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:22,860
So you be careful!

480
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:29,450
Now only the Sahaja Yogis from abroad and
non-vegetarians have to go first and then

481
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:35,440
the vegetarians will go and after that we’ll
have some music program.

482
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,820
That’s how it is going to be.

483
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:44,830
Tomorrow morning I expect you to go for meditation
about five o’clock in the morning.

484
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,570
Then have your bath in the sea.
