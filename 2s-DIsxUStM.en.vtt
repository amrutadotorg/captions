WEBVTT

00:01.917 --> 00:06.583
Tonight, we are going

00:07.500 --> 00:12.083
to worship the Lakshmi Principle within us.

00:18.917 --> 00:24.000
Lakshmi is the Goddess of wealth,

00:24.250 --> 00:28.000
prosperity and also of health.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.333
Actually your country is already blessed,

00:41.667 --> 00:44.083
because you have so many things here.

00:47.500 --> 00:54.500
Firstly, this country has got such a lot of petrol

00:59.999 --> 01:03.333
and if discoveries are made there’s much more.

01:09.250 --> 01:13.083
Then secondly, you have got beautiful timber.

01:17.417 --> 01:21.999
Then thirdly you’ve got lot of steel, very lot of steel, very good steel.

01:28.166 --> 01:29.917
Also you have diamonds.

01:33.750 --> 01:38.999
So many things you have, apart from that you have so much of heart.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.250
Also gold you have.

01:50.750 --> 01:55.834
So all these things are in abundance in this country.

02:00.166 --> 02:05.333
Only thing is you don’t yet have somebody who will manage

02:07.999 --> 02:10.166
to get to you people.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.500
I’m sure it will work out.

02:27.667 --> 02:31.083
But in Sahaja Yoga,

02:31.999 --> 02:36.417
we have to know that this Principle of Lakshmi,

02:37.083 --> 02:41.917
gives us a great sense of satisfaction.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.834
If you don’t have satisfaction

02:50.999 --> 02:54.166
then any amount of Lakshmi cannot help you.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.750
One becomes very greedy.

03:06.834 --> 03:12.333
You have something but you want to have more and more and more;

03:16.583 --> 03:20.917
and for that one adopts all kinds of methods and measures.

03:26.250 --> 03:30.583
Thus you also have, a very bad Mafia system here,

03:35.166 --> 03:36.750
who are very greedy.

03:38.834 --> 03:41.999
For Sahaja Yogis, one has to realize

03:42.250 --> 03:47.166
that he does not have to achieve anything – he’s already achieved.

03:54.166 --> 03:59.166
First people try to seek food,

04:02.667 --> 04:03.667
in the Nabhi Chakra

04:05.834 --> 04:08.750
– then they eat – that is Swaha

04:12.250 --> 04:15.667
– then it is being retained in the body.

04:18.583 --> 04:22.333
Now supposing somebody becomes very greedy of food,

04:22.667 --> 04:24.834
he gets sick, he has problems.

04:31.166 --> 04:33.333
But he goes to the second stage

04:33.500 --> 04:36.750
where he sustains it and called as Swadha,

04:43.333 --> 04:46.999
because he eats thinking that it is,

04:47.250 --> 04:50.667
as a human being, his duty to eat, that’s all.

04:55.250 --> 05:00.999
Not for taste, not for greed, not for showing off.

05:07.999 --> 05:10.333
In a very simple manner he eats.

05:12.917 --> 05:16.417
Like in the west I have seen people are very particular about

05:16.667 --> 05:19.834
where you put the spoon and where you put that.

05:27.417 --> 05:31.333
They spend thousands to buy those cutleries.

05:39.333 --> 05:45.834
Now the thing that is the worst for the Lakshmi Principle is drinking.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.667
It is alcohol.

05:54.500 --> 05:59.583
They say in India, that a bottle comes from one side

05:59.917 --> 06:02.166
and the Lakshmi runs away from another door.

06:09.083 --> 06:12.500
So Sahaja Yogis don’t need to drink.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.583
They give up drinking,

06:17.917 --> 06:23.583
and thus Lakshmi Principle can be established much more easily.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.083
Now why should we have Lakshmi?

06:34.999 --> 06:36.333
We should have Lakshmi

06:36.583 --> 06:40.834
because in the symbol of Lakshmi you can see the reason.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.333
First of all the Lakshmi has got

06:50.750 --> 06:55.333
two beautiful pink colored lotuses in Her hand.

07:00.667 --> 07:05.166
That symbolizes that a person who has money

07:05.667 --> 07:13.417
should have a very comfortable house, which is very inviting

07:13.667 --> 07:17.834
– pink color is for love and invitation.

07:26.333 --> 07:30.667
Now the beetle comes to the lotus

07:30.999 --> 07:34.999
and it has got all kinds of thorns on its body.

07:39.166 --> 07:43.333
The beetle comes to the lotus

07:43.667 --> 07:45.750
to collect some honey

07:45.999 --> 07:52.166
but it has got thorns on its body but the lotus accepts.

08:08.667 --> 08:15.333
It invites, you see the lotus is very happy to have this beetle in it.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.250
Now the beetle is seeking the honey

08:24.500 --> 08:28.583
and it gets tired and sleeps inside the lotus

08:28.917 --> 08:35.333
– so the lotus gives a beautiful corona – the bed for it to sleep

08:46.250 --> 08:51.083
and all the fragrance of the lotus, for that beetle,

08:56.750 --> 08:58.417
till the morning.

08:59.834 --> 09:02.834
Then when the beetle has rested well,

09:02.999 --> 09:07.250
he gets his honey and then he flies out.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.417
We can state poetically

09:17.667 --> 09:23.333
that the beetle is respected by the lotus

09:23.750 --> 09:27.750
because it is seeking the honey.

09:34.917 --> 09:38.417
Even if it has got thorns, doesn’t matter.

09:44.917 --> 09:49.917
Thus you people who have been seeking the truth,

09:50.250 --> 09:55.834
have received it on your Sahasrara, which is just like a lotus.

10:04.333 --> 10:09.166
Whatever you have done, whatever was the past is not important,

10:13.999 --> 10:18.999
you get your dignity because you are seeking the truth.

10:23.917 --> 10:27.333
Also when people get saturated with Lakshmi,

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
as in the West I have seen,

10:29.834 --> 10:34.083
they take to seeking – they get fed up,

10:41.750 --> 10:45.417
because material things is not Lakshmi,

10:48.333 --> 10:50.250
because it doesn’t give any satisfaction.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.999
So the other thing that Lakshmi has in Her hand

10:58.250 --> 11:02.250
- what happens that She puts one hand like this -

11:08.500 --> 11:12.333
this hand suggests that a person who has money

11:12.583 --> 11:15.999
has to give and share – not to take it for oneself.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.083
If they do not share,

11:25.333 --> 11:28.417
then they cannot enjoy the Principle of Lakshmi

11:33.417 --> 11:36.333
when giving to others is so joyful.

11:40.999 --> 11:42.917
Another hand is like this -

11:45.667 --> 11:50.417
this hand of the Goddess, suggests that those who are

11:50.583 --> 11:54.667
under your care, your relations, your friends,

11:54.917 --> 11:59.750
all those people, must be given complete protection by you.

12:10.667 --> 12:13.083
Anything happens in your family,

12:13.417 --> 12:19.083
anything happens to your relations or to your friends,

12:19.333 --> 12:22.333
you must stand by that person.

12:32.417 --> 12:35.834
Some people try to help their relations

12:35.999 --> 12:40.583
by say – many politicians do that way - by cheating.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.583
But by cheating, what you are doing

12:49.834 --> 12:52.250
is you are spoiling the life of that relation,

12:52.500 --> 12:54.250
you are not really helping.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.667
So he’ll be losing his name, his dignity, everything -

13:03.917 --> 13:05.999
specially his moral character.

13:12.750 --> 13:17.999
So with the Lakshmi, you must have your morality intact.

13:24.834 --> 13:28.999
In a country, like now, say America and all such people,

13:29.417 --> 13:31.917
there are horrible films coming

13:32.166 --> 13:37.500
and people are taking to the science, we call it, alakshmi.

13:48.083 --> 13:53.166
A person who has Lakshmi should dress up in a decent manner -

13:57.417 --> 13:59.166
women and men.

14:00.999 --> 14:06.417
I find on the street women walking with very short clothes.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.333
With that, what will happen your Nabhi chakra will be caught,

14:18.917 --> 14:21.333
and you will have problems with money.

14:24.583 --> 14:26.750
So the wealth that you have

14:26.999 --> 14:30.166
should be seen in your temperament, in your nature,

14:30.417 --> 14:33.166
in your behavior, in your living.

14:41.083 --> 14:46.750
Moreover the person who has Lakshmi has to be a very humble man.

14:52.583 --> 14:57.166
For example, Shri Lakshmi is standing on a lotus.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.917
Lotus is the lightest flower you could think

15:03.083 --> 15:06.667
because it floats over the water.

15:13.333 --> 15:17.917
So Her temperament should be not of a very serious type

15:18.083 --> 15:22.083
but of a very mirthful...

15:28.166 --> 15:31.917
and She doesn’t show off

15:32.333 --> 15:36.083
because it’s such a simple thing, like a lotus, to stand on that.

15:43.083 --> 15:46.999
So for people who have money, or who have wealth

15:47.166 --> 15:50.999
should not try to show off by very big cars and this and that.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.999
That of course does not mean that you should become sanyasis.

16:05.834 --> 16:12.083
On the contrary, you should be very well dignified personalities.

16:17.166 --> 16:19.750
But there should be detachment.

16:21.999 --> 16:24.750
As you saw Raja Janaka, He was a king

16:24.999 --> 16:27.250
and still He was so detached,

16:27.417 --> 16:32.417
that all the Saints used to go and touch the feet of Raja Janaka.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.750
So there was this fellow called Nachiketa, he asked his master

16:43.999 --> 16:47.083
“Why do you touch His feet? - He is a king”.

16:53.999 --> 16:57.417
So the master said “All right – you go and meet Him now”.

17:01.999 --> 17:09.999
So what he saw was that Janaka had all the luxuries of life.

17:14.917 --> 17:16.667
He was living in the palace

17:18.417 --> 17:21.750
and in the procession there were thousands and thousands of people

17:21.999 --> 17:24.999
who were throwing pearls on him.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.250
So Nachiketa thought he should get one pearl at least.

17:38.999 --> 17:41.583
Next day, he went to Raja Janaka

17:41.834 --> 17:44.750
and asked Him, “Give me Self-realization.”

17:51.250 --> 17:54.250
So Raja Janaka said, “I can give you all My kingdom

17:54.500 --> 17:56.917
but not Self-realization, very difficult,

18:02.917 --> 18:05.500
because you are possessed by the idea of money,

18:08.583 --> 18:10.999
such a person cannot get Realization."

18:14.834 --> 18:20.999
He said, “All right, I will live here till I get Realization.

18:25.333 --> 18:29.417
Next day Raja Janaka took him for a bath in the river

18:29.667 --> 18:32.750
and He was enjoying the bath.

18:39.834 --> 18:45.083
And people came and told Him that there is a fire in His palace.

18:49.417 --> 18:51.667
But Raja Janaka was meditating,

18:54.166 --> 18:55.417
He didn’t bother.

18:57.583 --> 19:04.333
Then they said that the people who are in the palace have run away.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.750
Then he says that, somebody said

19:11.999 --> 19:14.250
that now the fire is coming here.

19:17.999 --> 19:20.250
Still Raja Janaka was meditating.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.999
But Nachiketa ran out

19:25.166 --> 19:27.917
because his clothes were outside, so ran out to save his….

19:36.250 --> 19:38.750
And still Raja Janaka was not bothered.

19:42.083 --> 19:47.750
So when He came out He told him, "Nachiketa, this is all Mahamaya."

19:52.583 --> 19:54.166
This is how you are tested,

19:57.250 --> 20:00.583
if you are money-oriented you cannot get Self-realization.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.917
She’s the one who is testing.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.250
All the greedy people,

20:11.500 --> 20:14.917
all the people, for money’s sake, do all kinds of thing,

20:15.166 --> 20:19.417
as you have here, Mafias, - will be all punished.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.333
In any case they are not happy people, satisfied people,

20:30.583 --> 20:32.333
they are all the time worried.

20:37.417 --> 20:42.166
So first thing you must have is satisfaction.

20:46.083 --> 20:49.750
This is a very important thing in modern times to understand.

20:53.583 --> 20:58.750
Because is said also in the economics,

20:58.999 --> 21:02.917
that wants are not satiable in general.

21:08.999 --> 21:11.917
You want today a carpet – all right, have it.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.667
You work very hard, save money to buy a carpet,

21:22.500 --> 21:24.667
then you have the carpet, you want to have a house –

21:27.999 --> 21:29.583
you never enjoy the carpet,

21:31.250 --> 21:32.834
for which you have worked so hard.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.417
Then you have a house,

21:36.667 --> 21:39.083
so when you get the house, you want to have a car –

21:43.166 --> 21:47.500
then from car, you want, I think, helicopter, maybe an aeroplane.

21:53.166 --> 21:56.917
This is how it goes on

21:59.417 --> 22:02.500
and you work so hard and have no satisfaction.

22:06.583 --> 22:10.500
Because of this, in these modern times, people are extremely restless.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.750
There is no peace in your heart

22:17.667 --> 22:20.417
but if you have this Lakshmi Principle in you,

22:20.667 --> 22:23.667
you will feel extremely satisfied

22:23.999 --> 22:26.500
with everything that is materialistic.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.333
If you have, well and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

22:39.333 --> 22:44.500
But after that, this Mahalakshmi Principle is awakened within you,

22:48.667 --> 22:51.333
that you start seeking.

22:53.750 --> 22:59.583
And then that is also, later on as you have seen, is granted,

22:59.917 --> 23:01.999
because you get your Self-realization.

23:08.917 --> 23:15.417
So nothing to copy these horrible materialistic people,

23:20.750 --> 23:23.750
but we have to be satisfied with what we have

23:27.083 --> 23:32.083
and we should express our love by giving something,

23:32.250 --> 23:35.083
whatever it is, to the needy person.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.250
I have seen Myself,

23:45.583 --> 23:48.834
I find it very difficult to buy anything for Myself.

23:53.917 --> 23:57.166
If it is expensive, I think I should not buy it.

24:00.917 --> 24:05.834
So once I went to a shop, I wanted to buy a particular sari,

24:06.083 --> 24:08.333
but I thought it was too expensive – I didn’t buy it.

24:14.750 --> 24:18.333
But one Sahaja Yogi was with Me – he went and bought it

24:18.583 --> 24:20.999
and gave it to Me on My birthday

24:27.500 --> 24:30.500
and I just started crying, you know, it’s too much.

24:34.166 --> 24:37.583
We have stories like this in our Ramayana also,

24:37.834 --> 24:44.999
where Shri Rama ate the sour ber.

24:45.166 --> 24:50.917
We call it ber, I don't know - you too call it ber - must be a story like that.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.166
She told Shri Ram that,

25:02.417 --> 25:08.583
- she was an old woman from a down-trodden society -

25:08.834 --> 25:15.417
that “I have eaten every, I have touched every ber with my teeth,

25:15.750 --> 25:21.667
you see, and I have found out that none of them are sour.”

25:40.166 --> 25:45.250
In India, nobody eats anything which is touched by mouth,

25:45.500 --> 25:49.834
on any food, is regarded utishta,  is something wrong.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.583
But Shri Rama immediately took,

25:57.834 --> 26:02.917
He said, “Oh, how sweet of you to have done this tasting for Me.”

26:11.083 --> 26:14.333
But His brother was very angry, he didn’t like it, Lakshmana.

26:18.999 --> 26:24.583
Shri Rama ate, He said, “I have never eaten such beautiful bers.”

26:30.583 --> 26:32.083
So His wife Sita said,

26:32.333 --> 26:36.750
“Give Me also, little bit, I am your half thing you should give me.”

26:44.417 --> 26:46.917
So when Shri Rama gave Her, She ate and She said,

26:47.083 --> 26:50.999
“Oh my goodness what a beautiful fruit this one is.”

26:58.333 --> 27:00.667
So Lakshmana said, “Why not give Me?”

27:00.917 --> 27:02.166
He asked His sister-in-law,

27:02.333 --> 27:05.333
“Give me also”, She said “No, because you were so angry.”

27:15.750 --> 27:18.583
But She gave it to Lakshmana, and Lakshmana said,

27:18.834 --> 27:21.083
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.”

27:28.500 --> 27:31.999
What was in that ber was nothing

27:32.250 --> 27:37.333
but giving sense of this old lady.

27:44.083 --> 27:47.083
She didn’t have anything to give – she was a poor lady –

27:47.333 --> 27:50.417
so she did all this just to give to Shri Rama.

27:59.417 --> 28:05.417
So the sharing of your things is an extremely joy-giving thing.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.834
The other day we had brought some presents,

28:16.083 --> 28:20.500
I mean nothing so great, but you all so enjoyed it, and I too enjoyed it.

28:28.834 --> 28:32.083
That is how we all have to live,

28:39.333 --> 28:43.333
that is how all of us have to live together - sharing things.

28:49.583 --> 28:53.500
Don’t think about yourself, think of others.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.417
Think what others like.

29:01.166 --> 29:06.417
In India, the Gruha Lakshmis are that way very good.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.417
They know what you like to eat.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.417
So if you go to their house,

29:19.667 --> 29:23.250
immediately they will ask, "Please come for dinner."

29:30.250 --> 29:33.417
And they will make what I would like

29:33.667 --> 29:38.250
and I would love to eat. They’ll go out of the way to make that.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.999
But not only for Me, for anyone.

29:50.750 --> 29:54.583
It’s such a joy-giving thing to cook for others.

29:59.417 --> 30:03.417
So the principle of Lakshmi is only enjoyed

30:03.667 --> 30:05.250
when you share it with others.

30:13.083 --> 30:18.250
My father was a great Realized soul,

30:21.834 --> 30:26.250
and he never used to close the doors or windows in the night.

30:30.583 --> 30:34.417
And one day a thief came and took away the gramophone that he had.

30:39.999 --> 30:43.500
So he felt very sad that he has taken away the gramophone now,

30:43.750 --> 30:46.250
what about records – he can’t buy –

30:52.999 --> 30:54.917
how will he play?

30:57.667 --> 31:01.999
So My mother joked that, better give it in the newspaper that,

31:02.333 --> 31:05.999
“to the thief who has taken away our gramophone,

31:06.250 --> 31:08.333
please come and take away the records also.”

31:19.583 --> 31:21.750
This is a sign of Lakshmi Principle.

31:24.999 --> 31:27.250
The one who is satisfied

31:27.417 --> 31:30.750
and is happiest when he can give something.

31:37.750 --> 31:41.999
If you give with one hand you’ll get from ten hands.

31:46.667 --> 31:49.834
So we have to learn to share,

31:53.750 --> 31:57.917
as it is you are giving the highest thing to others -

31:58.333 --> 31:59.917
that is Self-realization.

32:06.333 --> 32:08.250
What more can you give?

32:10.500 --> 32:13.667
You must have seen when you give Self-realization,

32:13.917 --> 32:15.917
how happy you feel.

32:21.917 --> 32:24.583
The greatest happiness and the greatest joy

32:24.834 --> 32:26.834
is in giving Realizations to others.

32:31.834 --> 32:34.083
I have seen people, their faces change

32:34.333 --> 32:39.250
and people who give Realization, their faces also get full of light.

32:48.333 --> 32:53.417
We are a new society, we are people of new age,

32:53.834 --> 32:58.417
where we have got our satisfaction in higher things.

33:07.667 --> 33:10.250
There are many Sahaja Yogis who have been working,

33:10.500 --> 33:13.583
giving Realization, but there are many who do not.

33:21.083 --> 33:25.166
Unless and until you share your joy with others,

33:25.500 --> 33:27.500
you will not be happy.

33:34.166 --> 33:35.500
I heard the other day,

33:35.667 --> 33:39.583
one lady told Me that her father, mother are against Sahaja Yoga.

33:45.166 --> 33:48.083
I said, “What is your relationship?”

33:51.917 --> 33:54.500
She said, “I don’t talk to them, I don’t like them,

33:54.750 --> 33:56.834
the way they are against Sahaja Yoga”.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.583
I told her, “You change your attitude,

34:07.917 --> 34:11.333
take some flowers for them, some present for them,

34:16.166 --> 34:18.250
talk to them in a very sweet manner.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.834
Because you have become such a dry person,

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
that’s why they don’t like Sahaja Yoga."

34:29.999 --> 34:32.999
And it worked, it worked, the parents are now in Sahaja Yoga.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.999
So the attitude of a Sahaja Yogi

34:41.250 --> 34:46.166
towards a non-Sahaja Yogi should be of helping,

34:46.500 --> 34:48.834
of supporting, of sharing.

34:57.917 --> 35:01.083
But I must warn you there are some Sahaja Yogis

35:01.250 --> 35:04.999
who will try to have their own party.

35:11.834 --> 35:14.583
They are very power-oriented.

35:17.083 --> 35:19.166
They will have an exclusive party.

35:22.667 --> 35:26.500
It is a dangerous sign – it’s a cancer.

35:31.417 --> 35:33.500
Everything should be collective.

35:35.417 --> 35:36.999
Anybody who does that kind of thing,

35:37.166 --> 35:39.250
you should know is a possessed person,

35:43.667 --> 35:46.999
and you will be harmed if you follow such a person.

35:51.333 --> 35:55.250
We are all collective, we have to know everything among each other

35:55.417 --> 35:58.999
and we have to live like one family,

36:05.999 --> 36:09.083
not only in Russia but all over the world.

36:13.250 --> 36:21.083
Once you develop that kind of a love for everyone,

36:21.917 --> 36:25.333
then you will be surprised you have become a great personality.

36:33.250 --> 36:35.999
That means a drop becomes the ocean.

36:39.999 --> 36:44.166
I can go on saying about Lakshmi Principle for hours together.

36:47.750 --> 36:49.333
There are nine Lakshmis,

36:51.500 --> 36:52.999
but next time I’ll tell you.

36:55.999 --> 36:59.250
One of them is Gruha Lakshmi, is the housewife,

37:02.500 --> 37:08.999
and another is the Raja Lakshmi, which is the power of a king

37:09.250 --> 37:13.417
or of a person who is administrator or who is a bureaucrat.

37:21.417 --> 37:23.333
But I would request you

37:23.500 --> 37:27.417
to understand that you have got the greatest treasure

37:27.667 --> 37:30.834
that very few people have got in this world.

37:38.250 --> 37:40.417
Nourish it with your love.

37:43.500 --> 37:49.417
Nourish it with your compassion and peaceful existence.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.583
If there is any problem, anything

37:56.750 --> 37:59.417
– suddenly, you must become peaceful within.

38:06.917 --> 38:10.417
Then immediately you’ll find solution will come before you.

38:15.166 --> 38:18.583
This is the subtle of Lakshmi Principle.

38:21.999 --> 38:25.750
I hope all of you will develop it and enjoy it.

38:28.417 --> 38:32.834
Before I come next year, I will see that you all have,

38:32.999 --> 38:36.417
each person, has given Realization at least to hundred people.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.083
You got powers,

39:02.333 --> 39:06.417
you’ve got powers, you have knowledge, don’t waste it,

39:11.083 --> 39:12.583
we have to save the world.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.500
So, May God Bless you all.
