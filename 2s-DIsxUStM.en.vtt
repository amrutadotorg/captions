00:00:01.917 --> 00:00:06.583
Tonight, we are going

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.083
to worship the Lakshmi Principle within us.

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:24.000
Lakshmi is the Goddess of wealth,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.000
prosperity and also of health.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.333
Actually your country is already blessed,

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.083
because you have so many things here.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Firstly, this country has got such a lot of petrol

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:03.333
and if discoveries are made there’s much more.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.083
Then secondly, you have got beautiful timber.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:21.999
Then thirdly you’ve got lot of steel, very lot of steel, very good steel.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.917
Also you have diamonds.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.999
So many things you have, apart from that you have so much of heart.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.250
Also gold you have.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.834
So all these things are in abundance in this country.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:05.333
Only thing is you don’t yet have somebody who will manage

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.166
to get to you people.

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:19.500
I’m sure it will work out.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:31.083
But in Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:36.417
we have to know that this Principle of Lakshmi,

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:41.917
gives us a great sense of satisfaction.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.834
If you don’t have satisfaction

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.166
then any amount of Lakshmi cannot help you.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.750
One becomes very greedy.

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:12.333
You have something but you want to have more and more and more;

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:20.917
and for that one adopts all kinds of methods and measures.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.583
Thus you also have, a very bad Mafia system here,

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:36.750
who are very greedy.

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:41.999
For Sahaja Yogis, one has to realize

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.166
that he does not have to achieve anything – he’s already achieved.

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:59.166
First people try to seek food,

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:03.667
in the Nabhi Chakra

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:08.750
– then they eat – that is Swaha

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.667
– then it is being retained in the body.

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:22.333
Now supposing somebody becomes very greedy of food,

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:24.834
he gets sick, he has problems.

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:33.333
But he goes to the second stage

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.750
where he sustains it and called as Swadha,

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.999
because he eats thinking that it is,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.667
as a human being, his duty to eat, that’s all.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.999
Not for taste, not for greed, not for showing off.

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:10.333
In a very simple manner he eats.

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:16.417
Like in the west I have seen people are very particular about

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.834
where you put the spoon and where you put that.

00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:31.333
They spend thousands to buy those cutleries.

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:45.834
Now the thing that is the worst for the Lakshmi Principle is drinking.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.667
It is alcohol.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.583
They say in India, that a bottle comes from one side

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:02.166
and the Lakshmi runs away from another door.

00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:12.500
So Sahaja Yogis don’t need to drink.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.583
They give up drinking,

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:23.583
and thus Lakshmi Principle can be established much more easily.

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:32.083
Now why should we have Lakshmi?

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.333
We should have Lakshmi

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:40.834
because in the symbol of Lakshmi you can see the reason.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.333
First of all the Lakshmi has got

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.333
two beautiful pink colored lotuses in Her hand.

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:05.166
That symbolizes that a person who has money

00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:13.417
should have a very comfortable house, which is very inviting

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:17.834
– pink color is for love and invitation.

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:30.667
Now the beetle comes to the lotus

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:34.999
and it has got all kinds of thorns on its body.

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:43.333
The beetle comes to the lotus

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:45.750
to collect some honey

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:52.166
but it has got thorns on its body but the lotus accepts.

00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:15.333
It invites, you see the lotus is very happy to have this beetle in it.

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.250
Now the beetle is seeking the honey

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.583
and it gets tired and sleeps inside the lotus

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:35.333
– so the lotus gives a beautiful corona – the bed for it to sleep

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.083
and all the fragrance of the lotus, for that beetle,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.417
till the morning.

00:08:59.834 --> 00:09:02.834
Then when the beetle has rested well,

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:07.250
he gets his honey and then he flies out.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.417
We can state poetically

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:23.333
that the beetle is respected by the lotus

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.750
because it is seeking the honey.

00:09:34.917 --> 00:09:38.417
Even if it has got thorns, doesn’t matter.

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:49.917
Thus you people who have been seeking the truth,

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.834
have received it on your Sahasrara, which is just like a lotus.

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:09.166
Whatever you have done, whatever was the past is not important,

00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:18.999
you get your dignity because you are seeking the truth.

00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:27.333
Also when people get saturated with Lakshmi,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.500
as in the West I have seen,

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:34.083
they take to seeking – they get fed up,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.417
because material things is not Lakshmi,

00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:50.250
because it doesn’t give any satisfaction.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.999
So the other thing that Lakshmi has in Her hand

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.250
- what happens that She puts one hand like this -

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.333
this hand suggests that a person who has money

00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:15.999
has to give and share – not to take it for oneself.

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:25.083
If they do not share,

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:28.417
then they cannot enjoy the Principle of Lakshmi

00:11:33.417 --> 00:11:36.333
when giving to others is so joyful.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:42.917
Another hand is like this -

00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:50.417
this hand of the Goddess, suggests that those who are

00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:54.667
under your care, your relations, your friends,

00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:59.750
all those people, must be given complete protection by you.

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:13.083
Anything happens in your family,

00:12:13.417 --> 00:12:19.083
anything happens to your relations or to your friends,

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:22.333
you must stand by that person.

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:35.834
Some people try to help their relations

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:40.583
by say – many politicians do that way - by cheating.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.583
But by cheating, what you are doing

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:52.250
is you are spoiling the life of that relation,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.250
you are not really helping.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.667
So he’ll be losing his name, his dignity, everything -

00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:05.999
specially his moral character.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.999
So with the Lakshmi, you must have your morality intact.

00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:28.999
In a country, like now, say America and all such people,

00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:31.917
there are horrible films coming

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:37.500
and people are taking to the science, we call it, alakshmi.

00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:53.166
A person who has Lakshmi should dress up in a decent manner -

00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.166
women and men.

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:06.417
I find on the street women walking with very short clothes.

00:14:12.333 --> 00:14:15.333
With that, what will happen your Nabhi chakra will be caught,

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:21.333
and you will have problems with money.

00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:26.750
So the wealth that you have

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:30.166
should be seen in your temperament, in your nature,

00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:33.166
in your behavior, in your living.

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:46.750
Moreover the person who has Lakshmi has to be a very humble man.

00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:57.166
For example, Shri Lakshmi is standing on a lotus.

00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:02.917
Lotus is the lightest flower you could think

00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:06.667
because it floats over the water.

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:17.917
So Her temperament should be not of a very serious type

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:22.083
but of a very mirthful...

00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:31.917
and She doesn’t show off

00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:36.083
because it’s such a simple thing, like a lotus, to stand on that.

00:15:43.083 --> 00:15:46.999
So for people who have money, or who have wealth

00:15:47.166 --> 00:15:50.999
should not try to show off by very big cars and this and that.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:01.999
That of course does not mean that you should become sanyasis.

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:12.083
On the contrary, you should be very well dignified personalities.

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:19.750
But there should be detachment.

00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:24.750
As you saw Raja Janaka, He was a king

00:16:24.999 --> 00:16:27.250
and still He was so detached,

00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:32.417
that all the Saints used to go and touch the feet of Raja Janaka.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.750
So there was this fellow called Nachiketa, he asked his master

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:47.083
“Why do you touch His feet? - He is a king”.

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:57.417
So the master said “All right – you go and meet Him now”.

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:09.999
So what he saw was that Janaka had all the luxuries of life.

00:17:14.917 --> 00:17:16.667
He was living in the palace

00:17:18.417 --> 00:17:21.750
and in the procession there were thousands and thousands of people

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:24.999
who were throwing pearls on him.

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:34.250
So Nachiketa thought he should get one pearl at least.

00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:41.583
Next day, he went to Raja Janaka

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:44.750
and asked Him, “Give me Self-realization.”

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.250
So Raja Janaka said, “I can give you all My kingdom

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.917
but not Self-realization, very difficult,

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:05.500
because you are possessed by the idea of money,

00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:10.999
such a person cannot get Realization."

00:18:14.834 --> 00:18:20.999
He said, “All right, I will live here till I get Realization.

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:29.417
Next day Raja Janaka took him for a bath in the river

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:32.750
and He was enjoying the bath.

00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:45.083
And people came and told Him that there is a fire in His palace.

00:18:49.417 --> 00:18:51.667
But Raja Janaka was meditating,

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:55.417
He didn’t bother.

00:18:57.583 --> 00:19:04.333
Then they said that the people who are in the palace have run away.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.750
Then he says that, somebody said

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:14.250
that now the fire is coming here.

00:19:17.999 --> 00:19:20.250
Still Raja Janaka was meditating.

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:24.999
But Nachiketa ran out

00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:27.917
because his clothes were outside, so ran out to save his….

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.750
And still Raja Janaka was not bothered.

00:19:42.083 --> 00:19:47.750
So when He came out He told him, "Nachiketa, this is all Mahamaya."

00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:54.166
This is how you are tested,

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.583
if you are money-oriented you cannot get Self-realization.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.917
She’s the one who is testing.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.250
All the greedy people,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.917
all the people, for money’s sake, do all kinds of thing,

00:20:15.166 --> 00:20:19.417
as you have here, Mafias, - will be all punished.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.333
In any case they are not happy people, satisfied people,

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:32.333
they are all the time worried.

00:20:37.417 --> 00:20:42.166
So first thing you must have is satisfaction.

00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:49.750
This is a very important thing in modern times to understand.

00:20:53.583 --> 00:20:58.750
Because is said also in the economics,

00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:02.917
that wants are not satiable in general.

00:21:08.999 --> 00:21:11.917
You want today a carpet – all right, have it.

00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:17.667
You work very hard, save money to buy a carpet,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.667
then you have the carpet, you want to have a house –

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:29.583
you never enjoy the carpet,

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.834
for which you have worked so hard.

00:21:35.166 --> 00:21:36.417
Then you have a house,

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:39.083
so when you get the house, you want to have a car –

00:21:43.166 --> 00:21:47.500
then from car, you want, I think, helicopter, maybe an aeroplane.

00:21:53.166 --> 00:21:56.917
This is how it goes on

00:21:59.417 --> 00:22:02.500
and you work so hard and have no satisfaction.

00:22:06.583 --> 00:22:10.500
Because of this, in these modern times, people are extremely restless.

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:15.750
There is no peace in your heart

00:22:17.667 --> 00:22:20.417
but if you have this Lakshmi Principle in you,

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:23.667
you will feel extremely satisfied

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:26.500
with everything that is materialistic.

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:35.333
If you have, well and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:44.500
But after that, this Mahalakshmi Principle is awakened within you,

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:51.333
that you start seeking.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:59.583
And then that is also, later on as you have seen, is granted,

00:22:59.917 --> 00:23:01.999
because you get your Self-realization.

00:23:08.917 --> 00:23:15.417
So nothing to copy these horrible materialistic people,

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.750
but we have to be satisfied with what we have

00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:32.083
and we should express our love by giving something,

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.083
whatever it is, to the needy person.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.250
I have seen Myself,

00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:48.834
I find it very difficult to buy anything for Myself.

00:23:53.917 --> 00:23:57.166
If it is expensive, I think I should not buy it.

00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:05.834
So once I went to a shop, I wanted to buy a particular sari,

00:24:06.083 --> 00:24:08.333
but I thought it was too expensive – I didn’t buy it.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.333
But one Sahaja Yogi was with Me – he went and bought it

00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:20.999
and gave it to Me on My birthday

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.500
and I just started crying, you know, it’s too much.

00:24:34.166 --> 00:24:37.583
We have stories like this in our Ramayana also,

00:24:37.834 --> 00:24:44.999
where Shri Rama ate the sour ber.

00:24:45.166 --> 00:24:50.917
We call it ber, I don't know - you too call it ber - must be a story like that.

00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:02.166
She told Shri Ram that,

00:25:02.417 --> 00:25:08.583
- she was an old woman from a down-trodden society -

00:25:08.834 --> 00:25:15.417
that “I have eaten every, I have touched every ber with my teeth,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:21.667
you see, and I have found out that none of them are sour.”

00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:45.250
In India, nobody eats anything which is touched by mouth,

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.834
on any food, is regarded utishta,  is something wrong.

00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:57.583
But Shri Rama immediately took,

00:25:57.834 --> 00:26:02.917
He said, “Oh, how sweet of you to have done this tasting for Me.”

00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:14.333
But His brother was very angry, he didn’t like it, Lakshmana.

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:24.583
Shri Rama ate, He said, “I have never eaten such beautiful bers.”

00:26:30.583 --> 00:26:32.083
So His wife Sita said,

00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:36.750
“Give Me also, little bit, I am your half thing you should give me.”

00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:46.917
So when Shri Rama gave Her, She ate and She said,

00:26:47.083 --> 00:26:50.999
“Oh my goodness what a beautiful fruit this one is.”

00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:00.667
So Lakshmana said, “Why not give Me?”

00:27:00.917 --> 00:27:02.166
He asked His sister-in-law,

00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:05.333
“Give me also”, She said “No, because you were so angry.”

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.583
But She gave it to Lakshmana, and Lakshmana said,

00:27:18.834 --> 00:27:21.083
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.”

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.999
What was in that ber was nothing

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:37.333
but giving sense of this old lady.

00:27:44.083 --> 00:27:47.083
She didn’t have anything to give – she was a poor lady –

00:27:47.333 --> 00:27:50.417
so she did all this just to give to Shri Rama.

00:27:59.417 --> 00:28:05.417
So the sharing of your things is an extremely joy-giving thing.

00:28:13.166 --> 00:28:15.834
The other day we had brought some presents,

00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:20.500
I mean nothing so great, but you all so enjoyed it, and I too enjoyed it.

00:28:28.834 --> 00:28:32.083
That is how we all have to live,

00:28:39.333 --> 00:28:43.333
that is how all of us have to live together - sharing things.

00:28:49.583 --> 00:28:53.500
Don’t think about yourself, think of others.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.417
Think what others like.

00:29:01.166 --> 00:29:06.417
In India, the Gruha Lakshmis are that way very good.

00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:14.417
They know what you like to eat.

00:29:17.583 --> 00:29:19.417
So if you go to their house,

00:29:19.667 --> 00:29:23.250
immediately they will ask, "Please come for dinner."

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:33.417
And they will make what I would like

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:38.250
and I would love to eat. They’ll go out of the way to make that.

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:47.999
But not only for Me, for anyone.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:54.583
It’s such a joy-giving thing to cook for others.

00:29:59.417 --> 00:30:03.417
So the principle of Lakshmi is only enjoyed

00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:05.250
when you share it with others.

00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:18.250
My father was a great Realized soul,

00:30:21.834 --> 00:30:26.250
and he never used to close the doors or windows in the night.

00:30:30.583 --> 00:30:34.417
And one day a thief came and took away the gramophone that he had.

00:30:39.999 --> 00:30:43.500
So he felt very sad that he has taken away the gramophone now,

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.250
what about records – he can’t buy –

00:30:52.999 --> 00:30:54.917
how will he play?

00:30:57.667 --> 00:31:01.999
So My mother joked that, better give it in the newspaper that,

00:31:02.333 --> 00:31:05.999
“to the thief who has taken away our gramophone,

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.333
please come and take away the records also.”

00:31:19.583 --> 00:31:21.750
This is a sign of Lakshmi Principle.

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:27.250
The one who is satisfied

00:31:27.417 --> 00:31:30.750
and is happiest when he can give something.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.999
If you give with one hand you’ll get from ten hands.

00:31:46.667 --> 00:31:49.834
So we have to learn to share,

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.917
as it is you are giving the highest thing to others -

00:31:58.333 --> 00:31:59.917
that is Self-realization.

00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:08.250
What more can you give?

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.667
You must have seen when you give Self-realization,

00:32:13.917 --> 00:32:15.917
how happy you feel.

00:32:21.917 --> 00:32:24.583
The greatest happiness and the greatest joy

00:32:24.834 --> 00:32:26.834
is in giving Realizations to others.

00:32:31.834 --> 00:32:34.083
I have seen people, their faces change

00:32:34.333 --> 00:32:39.250
and people who give Realization, their faces also get full of light.

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:53.417
We are a new society, we are people of new age,

00:32:53.834 --> 00:32:58.417
where we have got our satisfaction in higher things.

00:33:07.667 --> 00:33:10.250
There are many Sahaja Yogis who have been working,

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.583
giving Realization, but there are many who do not.

00:33:21.083 --> 00:33:25.166
Unless and until you share your joy with others,

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.500
you will not be happy.

00:33:34.166 --> 00:33:35.500
I heard the other day,

00:33:35.667 --> 00:33:39.583
one lady told Me that her father, mother are against Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:45.166 --> 00:33:48.083
I said, “What is your relationship?”

00:33:51.917 --> 00:33:54.500
She said, “I don’t talk to them, I don’t like them,

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.834
the way they are against Sahaja Yoga”.

00:34:02.834 --> 00:34:04.583
I told her, “You change your attitude,

00:34:07.917 --> 00:34:11.333
take some flowers for them, some present for them,

00:34:16.166 --> 00:34:18.250
talk to them in a very sweet manner.

00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:22.834
Because you have become such a dry person,

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:24.999
that’s why they don’t like Sahaja Yoga."

00:34:29.999 --> 00:34:32.999
And it worked, it worked, the parents are now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.999
So the attitude of a Sahaja Yogi

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:46.166
towards a non-Sahaja Yogi should be of helping,

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.834
of supporting, of sharing.

00:34:57.917 --> 00:35:01.083
But I must warn you there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:04.999
who will try to have their own party.

00:35:11.834 --> 00:35:14.583
They are very power-oriented.

00:35:17.083 --> 00:35:19.166
They will have an exclusive party.

00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:26.500
It is a dangerous sign – it’s a cancer.

00:35:31.417 --> 00:35:33.500
Everything should be collective.

00:35:35.417 --> 00:35:36.999
Anybody who does that kind of thing,

00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:39.250
you should know is a possessed person,

00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:46.999
and you will be harmed if you follow such a person.

00:35:51.333 --> 00:35:55.250
We are all collective, we have to know everything among each other

00:35:55.417 --> 00:35:58.999
and we have to live like one family,

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:09.083
not only in Russia but all over the world.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:21.083
Once you develop that kind of a love for everyone,

00:36:21.917 --> 00:36:25.333
then you will be surprised you have become a great personality.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.999
That means a drop becomes the ocean.

00:36:39.999 --> 00:36:44.166
I can go on saying about Lakshmi Principle for hours together.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.333
There are nine Lakshmis,

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:52.999
but next time I’ll tell you.

00:36:55.999 --> 00:36:59.250
One of them is Gruha Lakshmi, is the housewife,

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:08.999
and another is the Raja Lakshmi, which is the power of a king

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:13.417
or of a person who is administrator or who is a bureaucrat.

00:37:21.417 --> 00:37:23.333
But I would request you

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.417
to understand that you have got the greatest treasure

00:37:27.667 --> 00:37:30.834
that very few people have got in this world.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.417
Nourish it with your love.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:49.417
Nourish it with your compassion and peaceful existence.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.583
If there is any problem, anything

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.417
– suddenly, you must become peaceful within.

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:10.417
Then immediately you’ll find solution will come before you.

00:38:15.166 --> 00:38:18.583
This is the subtle of Lakshmi Principle.

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:25.750
I hope all of you will develop it and enjoy it.

00:38:28.417 --> 00:38:32.834
Before I come next year, I will see that you all have,

00:38:32.999 --> 00:38:36.417
each person, has given Realization at least to hundred people.

00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:53.083
You got powers,

00:39:02.333 --> 00:39:06.417
you’ve got powers, you have knowledge, don’t waste it,

00:39:11.083 --> 00:39:12.583
we have to save the world.

00:39:15.083 --> 00:39:16.500
So, May God Bless you all.
