00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:03.208
Y: God the father, God the mother and if she recognizes

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:06.291
you as God the mother is Sai Baba, this fellow  in India

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:10.999
God the father? S M: No. Y: But on the whole, is there, I mean

00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:13.667
Y: She answered your question. Y: You do need a father.

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.999
S M: I'll tell you how you should understand, all right,

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.333
that's better to see you [sounds like sa]. Y: Do you want to all come a little further.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.999
SM: Come along, I will tell you, how to recognise,

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:24.417
to see a right person.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.458
Y: Before you ask a question, you kindly just come forward

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:51.458
so that Mother can speak to you directly and so She can hear you.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:00.250
SM: I hope you have explained to her about the center heart position.

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:03.999
Y: Just a little, I said this is the center... SM: mother,

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.417
She's the Mother of the universe at that point, all right?

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:12.999
In the center of - it's all right, let her be comfortable -

00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:18.375
is the center heart, as you call, we call it center heart.

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:22.125
But, is this center, this is a very subtle center within us

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.667
which manifests the gross plexus,

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.500
which is called as - thank you -

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:33.750
which is called as the cardiac.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.500
There is any doctor here?

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:42.999
This subtle center is bestowed upon by the deity

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.709
of the Mother of the universe, all right, She is called as Jagadamba

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.250
Now Her position is such, if you can see clearly?

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.208
That green, big thing, that's the place She resides.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.999
And She's alone there, She comes alone

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:04.999
because the people are trying to get over this round thing

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:10.250
that you see here, we call it as Void

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.999
or you can say Bhavasagara means the ocean of illusion.

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.083
So the seekers are trying to get out of the ocean of illusion

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.834
because we live in illusion, we have not yet felt that subtle thing,

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:31.709
all right? So the Mother there, is to protect,

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:38.041
to guide, to counsel and bring them out of that illusion, all right?

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:44.208
Now, I have not told you the story of the creation.

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.375
That's why there's a confusion, that the Father, the God

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:53.792
does not do anything but to witness the play of his power.

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:57.250
He is just witnessing the play of his power

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.208
and His power is the Mother, the Holy Ghost.

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:03.917
In the Bible it's a mystery,

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.417
they have not talked about Holy Ghost so much because

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:10.375
that time the Mother of Christ was playing the part of Holy Ghost,

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:12.333
so they didn't talk because they thought

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:14.917
the attention will go to Her and She'll be killed.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:18.417
And then as Christ has got eleven destroying powers

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.375
He will destroy the whole world.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.458
And that is why they never said about the Mother.

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:28.458
All right? So that is the Mother, who is, we call as Mahalakshmi,

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:31.625
is the power of ascent, as She was.

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:36.208
So this Mother, who is the one who is the protector, the Mother

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:40.125
who looks after you, who kills all the demons

00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:43.208
and all the devils in you and outside

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:47.834
is the one who is called as Jagadamba in Sanskrit language,

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.291
means the Mother of the Universe, all right?

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.875
The Father about whom Christ has talked

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:57.999
or about everybody has talked as Allah and all that,

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:04.250
this Father is the witness of the play of the Holy Ghost,

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:09.333
all right? And He's reflected within us in the heart as the spirit.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.083
So the Mother has to do it alone.

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:14.709
Now as far as this particular gentleman you asked Me,

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:16.959
we can see that instead of taking us

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.625
out of illusion he puts us in the illusion.

00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:23.250
He gives you diamonds and diamond is a very big illusion.

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.333
He gives diamonds to people who are very rich,

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:28.999
I mean for example he'll give diamonds to My brother

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:32.208
who is a very rich man and he gets a heart attack.

00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:36.417
Most of the people whom he has given a diamond get a heart attack.

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:41.417
Can you imagine? On the contrary people think he is going to cure.

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.750
So many people have got heart attacks from this man.

00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:49.208
Now if somebody is a godly person and a divine person

00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.750
he'll not give you diamonds, because what is a diamond?

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:54.333
You can purchase it in the market, isn't it?

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:56.917
What is so special about diamond?

00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:59.667
He'll give you something that nobody can give you:

00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.166
that's your spirit.

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:06.750
All right? So this is what it is: they create an illusion,

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:09.166
all kinds of illusions are created.

00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:13.625
But Sai Nath, the first one, the real one, who was on this earth

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:15.834
real Sai Nath, at Shirdi,

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.333
who was, He was the one, who was a real prophet.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:22.999
He was the Primordial Master, who came on this earth.

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:27.542
And He was the last of them, so far, who's done lot of work for Me

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.875
and it's helping Me such a lot in that area only

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.625
our work is doing very well because he's talked all about

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:37.750
Sahaja Yoga, about all these things to people

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:40.917
so people are just prepared in the villages and all that,

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:44.000
just to get it. It's much easier to do it,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.083
when He has already prepared people for that, they are ready.

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:54.542
They know what to do, how to discriminate,

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:56.834
how to find out, who is the right person.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:00.166
In that area he never goes, he never goes in that area,

00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:02.375
nor people have any respect for him,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.458
even in Bangalore people have no respect for him.

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:09.208
So to understand a person first of all we must know that does he,

00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:15.792
does that person takes us out of the ocean of illusion?

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:19.166
Now if I say we are in illusion just now,

00:06:20.041 --> 00:06:22.917
now I must prove, then, isn't it? If I say something like that,

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:26.208
I must prove then what is not illusion.

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:32.458
This is illusion because we havenâ€™t got our awareness yet,

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:37.125
of that level by which we will know, what is not illusion.

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:39.999
For example, supposing we are blind, we can't see things,

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:46.000
there is darkness, then no use talking to a person about the color

00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:50.208
who cannot see, because whatever you may talk he won't understand.

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:54.291
For him his dark life is the reality

00:06:54.917 --> 00:07:00.166
and enlightened light, enlightened life is an illusion - for him.

00:07:00.834 --> 00:07:03.917
But supposing by any chance you can open the eyes of the person then

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:09.542
he can see that this is not an illusion, that one was an illusion.

00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:12.834
In the same way something has to happen to all of us,

00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:17.375
by which you achieve that state where you become

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:22.500
the spirit and you feel this all-pervading Power which is around us.

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:26.250
First time you feel it when you get your realization.

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:30.875
So one should not talk of diamonds, pearls, gold

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:34.333
which has nothing to do with a person who is a divine person.

00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:37.999
Now it's all right I am a married woman, My husband has a big position

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.500
I have to live with him as a normal human being, I'm living.

00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:45.458
So I have to dress up the way his status is in life.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.291
It's all right, makes no difference to Me, I can sleep on the road,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.417
I can go by bullock cart, I can go by Rolls Royce also.

00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.417
Makes no difference because I'm so detached about it.

00:07:56.583 --> 00:07:59.959
So it's nothing important, what is important is

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.417
that we should know what is reality. And to know the reality,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.250
we have to become something more then what we are.

00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:14.875
And that is what a guru should tell you - always -

00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:17.583
that you must get your Self-realization.

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:21.834
But there are much cleverer gurus than this one is.

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:24.709
There are many cleverer ones, who tell you, all right,

00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:30.291
you become something else. So we have four types of awareness

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:34.125
within us, we can say. One is at the lower side,

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.333
where we are just animals.

00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:42.458
At the stage, where is this red mark, we are carbon.

00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:45.999
Just a carbon, carbon gives you life,

00:08:46.291 --> 00:08:49.917
without carbon you cannot get life. So this is carbon is here.

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:55.125
Then the orange one that you see there,

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:58.083
is the one that goes round and round.

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.625
There's a mistake in coloring.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.999
This is a yellow one, this is yellow and that is green.

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:20.999
Y: This is green. SM: And that is blue, blue and that one is,

00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:24.834
is a wrong name, it's just now noticed, it's all right.

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:28.083
Y: That's green, that should be blue. SM: Blue, and that should be

00:09:28.792 --> 00:09:31.709
what you call dhu, dhu means smokey, smokey color

00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:36.999
that one's correct. SM: It's a little mistake, doesn't matter.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:45.250
All right, so the other gurus can do other tricks,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.291
is to put you to another kind of awareness, like

00:09:48.917 --> 00:09:53.834
they can make you into an animal. Like some people I've seen

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:58.166
seen pictures that they make you jump, jump, jump

00:09:58.834 --> 00:10:00.999
then you start shouting and screaming like animals,

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:04.999
you start barking like dogs and behaving like frogs

00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:08.125
and all sorts of things you see, Rajnish does that.

00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:11.291
He's done that to people. Now thatâ€™s one way.

00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:14.417
Some can drive you to the left side.

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:18.917
Left side people are those who go into clairvoyance and use spirits.

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:21.875
Left side is our collective subconscious,

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:25.333
where everything that is dead is lying there.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.999
And that's a very dangerous zone because, so far,

00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:34.542
I have noticed that all people who suffer from diseases like

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:37.542
cancer and you name all of them.

00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:42.999
Y: Poliomyelitis, osteomyelitis, all these, muscular dystrophy,

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:47.041
multiple sclerosis. SM: All these,

00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:51.041
these come from the problem of the left side, can you believe it?

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:55.041
From the left side, means if you take to clairvoyance

00:10:55.208 --> 00:10:57.999
or if you go to a guru, he practices the left side, means

00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:01.917
he uses dead spirits and all that, then you get these diseases.

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:05.000
Then there are some who put you to the right side.

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:08.999
For example, they make you extra intelligent,

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:12.999
and extra clever and there's another spirit that sits on you,

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:15.542
very ambitious person and all sorts of things.

00:11:16.417 --> 00:11:19.166
They also, after all, after some time you'll get tired,

00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:22.999
you can become like a cabbage and you just don't know,

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:25.250
you can't face life, you become a recluse and

00:11:25.792 --> 00:11:28.500
you are away from the society, you are good for nothing.

00:11:28.917 --> 00:11:32.291
So there are two types of people, in the left hand side people

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:35.834
people make you feel very small that you are a sinner

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:39.333
and you must say, like confess, or something like that,

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:41.417
showing you down that you are good for nothing.

00:11:41.542 --> 00:11:45.166
The other ones pamper your ego and take you to the other side.

00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:48.999
So you have two other areas also, one is the collective subconscious

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.417
and another is the collective supraconscious.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.417
But where we have to go is the super consciousness.

00:11:56.999 --> 00:11:59.999
This is the ascent, we have to, not to go sideways

00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:04.291
or downwards but we have to ascend, to ascend means what?

00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:06.999
What have you to achieve as an ascent? It means

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:14.166
you yourself develop powers of giving ascent to others

00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:18.125
because you become a higher person than the rest of the people.

00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:22.834
Like one fish first came out of the water,

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.166
then two, three fishes came out, then about twelve might have

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:31.792
and then many shoals of fishes started coming out

00:12:31.999 --> 00:12:34.834
because these are the few fishes which pulled them out.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.999
They went ahead and they pulled them out.

00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:42.166
In the same way, you have to become a higher personality,

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:44.999
and as soon as you become higher personality,

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:47.417
I don't have to tell you that you should be virtuous,

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:51.000
you must do that, you just become, just become.

00:12:51.291 --> 00:12:54.417
What is the difference between a great man and a small man,

00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:59.208
is just this: that the great man has already achieved that state,

00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:03.208
where his virtues and his qualities are part and parcel of his life.

00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:07.834
You see? And the others are still fighting within.

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:10.999
But by becoming the spirit you become so powerful

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.834
that you don't have to fight anything,

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.542
you become completely integrated,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.583
you fight yourself actually all the time.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:22.125
For example, somebody would say: "Oh, I love to take drinks,

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.834
I like to go to pubs, I like that, of course bad for my liver

00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:29.041
I have a bad liver but what to do, I like it, how can I give up?"

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.333
That doesn't happen after realization; you just do

00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:37.041
what is good for you, what is going to give you complete joy.

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:40.458
So this is what one should ask for,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.667
not for anything like diamonds and things like that.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.959
But this is more serious than that.

00:13:46.083 --> 00:13:48.000
It's not only diamonds, I don't mind,

00:13:48.291 --> 00:13:50.166
you can give smuggled diamonds, blue diamonds,

00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:52.375
makes no difference but it's much more serious.

00:13:52.583 --> 00:13:56.291
If it were only diamonds I am not interested but it's much more.

00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:59.999
Much more than that, it's very injurious, very injurious.

00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:04.333
And the serious matter, gradually as you'll grow in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:07.125
and sensitive you will become, you can feel it,

00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:10.917
who is the real and who is the unreal and then you'll be amazed

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.875
at what sort of people are going about as gurus.

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:17.542
They are nowhere near God, they are all anti-God.

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:20.917
They are anti-Christ, anti-God people.

00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:27.125
Y: Last night you were raising

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:30.417
the kundalini of the people in the room.

00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:33.834
Last night in the hall. SM: Ya.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.250
Y: Why didnâ€™t I feel a great feeling of bliss?

00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:40.625
SM: You did not? Y: No. SM: You will.

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:44.999
Y: Why when everyone says if the Kundalini comes in you have a turn of heart.

00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:48.500
Y: It's a incredible feeling. SM: You got it?

00:14:48.999 --> 00:14:52.458
Y: No no, I didn't. I'm wondering why, if that happened?

00:14:52.999 --> 00:14:56.999
SM: You see there can be many reasons but I need not tell you,

00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.083
should I, why to make you nervous about it? I'll just get it done.

00:15:01.583 --> 00:15:04.166
SM: Doctors don't tell you had this trouble or that trouble, do they?

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:07.333
Why should he, if I know how to cure you? I'll just cure you, finished.

00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:09.458
Why should you worry, why you didn't feel or anything.

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:12.458
you should feel it, all right? That's between you and Me.

00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:15.792
But not to worry, why I didn't feel, what happened.

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:18.875
There must be something, no doubt, but doesn't matter,

00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:20.792
it's nothing important, is it?

00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:24.667
To you, is it? No no, later on you will know.

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:27.250
First of all you get your realization.

00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:29.583
You see, first of all you must get your realization,

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.083
that's more important. Then, you will know yourself,

00:15:32.417 --> 00:15:34.625
what was wrong with you, why you didn't get it.

00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:38.542
Now if you ask Warren he will tell you that he was arguing Me all

00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:41.999
the time within himself, you see, but he wouldn't say that to Me.

00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:46.709
You are doing the same but there are some other things also...

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:50.750
Yes, my child.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.166
Y: How would one of your disciples...Y: Could you speak up for Mother?

00:15:55.458 --> 00:16:01.041
Y: How would, or how could a disciple or a seeker

00:16:02.999 --> 00:16:06.959
deal with a person who is possessed?

00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:12.875
who has difficulty, who has blockages within himself,

00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:17.208
how could a disciple of yours deal with a person like this?

00:16:17.999 --> 00:16:21.250
What would be a good way? SM: Oh, there are so many ways.

00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:25.667
Mother: Yes of course, there are so many ways by which they deal.

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:28.999
That is what I have to teach you, that's why I am here, to

00:16:29.166 --> 00:16:32.999
counsel you on that, isn't it? That I'll teach you how to do it. But.

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:37.999
First of all you must get completely strong enough.

00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:41.333
And you must know all the ways and methods of protecting yourself.

00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:44.999
So the main interest of the Mother is in Her own children,

00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:49.417
to begin with, and then once they are so well equipped

00:16:49.999 --> 00:16:51.625
they can go to other people, no harm.

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:54.999
Then they can look after. But there are other ways also

00:16:55.166 --> 00:16:57.834
indirectly helping you, so I'll teach you all those things

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.709
one by one, all right? Y: That's what I'm more interested in.

00:17:00.999 --> 00:17:02.417
Mother: Yes yes yes. Y: Indirect way.

00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:04.667
SM: Yes indirectly it's, we will tell you.

00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:08.375
SM: That can be done. Indirect ways should be used first of all.

00:17:08.792 --> 00:17:12.333
Then direct ways because indirect ways are easier

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:15.999
and you are not sort of harmed by that.

00:17:16.667 --> 00:17:19.792
To begin with. Later on then, once you are strong, you are never

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:21.875
harmed but you have to be strong person

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:23.999
because you get involved into situations, you see,

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.875
specially if you have to treat your own mother, own father,

00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:29.999
own brother, then it's even in worse, you see.

00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:38.125
SM: Is that the case? Y: No, I had been pointed out that I had

00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:42.999
certain possessions and things and

00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:46.208
in fact when it was pointed out to me, I became very frightened.

00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:51.166
SM: Yesterday? Y: No it was some time ago, six months maybe,

00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:58.917
I am not sure. SM: Who told you? Yogini: Friend of mine.

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:01.417
SM: She is a realized soul? Y: I think so.

00:18:02.291 --> 00:18:07.792
She is My disciple? Y: I am not sure. SM: How can she say that?

00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:11.999
That's not allowed in Sahaja Yoga to say to anyone like that.

00:18:12.999 --> 00:18:17.125
Unless and until that person becomes aware of it, you don't say that.

00:18:17.417 --> 00:18:19.999
Because why frighten a person, for nothing at all?

00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:22.875
If she has done, if she is a disciple of Mine, I am surprised,

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:25.999
you are not to tell people like that. But,

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:29.834
slowly you can introduce and tell that this is to be done

00:18:30.333 --> 00:18:34.999
to get well, all right? Have you been to some guru?

00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:41.458
Y: No, I had certain

00:18:41.999 --> 00:18:46.999
visions and things that just came to me, when I was a bit younger.

00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:52.375
What sort of visions? Y: Little people, I saw little people,

00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:56.999
and what I was led to believe were nature spirits.

00:18:58.125 --> 00:19:01.333
I didn't want to see them, it just happened.

00:19:04.625 --> 00:19:07.291
SM: But you've been to some clairvoyant person or someone?

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:13.417
Y: I think he claimed he was clairvoyant, but I knew he wasn't.

00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:16.417
SM: Must be something like that. Y: So I didn't believe him.

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:18.083
SM: You see they're all like that.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.333
Clairvoyance is not a very great thing.

00:19:20.542 --> 00:19:23.583
If he says he's clairvoyant, then he must be.

00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:27.083
See if you go to these people, they push you to the left

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.917
or to the right and you can see like that,

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:31.208
you see they can they can go to any extent.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.333
Those who go to left side can see lots of things.

00:19:34.625 --> 00:19:37.291
Example I'll give you: a gentleman,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.333
who was one of our trustees, he was bringing another fellow

00:19:41.792 --> 00:19:46.375
who was mentally disturbed. He went to the station

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:50.250
and this fellow did not arrive so he was rather upset.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.792
So he went to the post office to telephone.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.709
The phone was out of order, so another gentleman said

00:19:55.875 --> 00:19:58.083
there's a house there, you can go and ask them.

00:19:58.208 --> 00:19:59.917
They'll allow you to telephone.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.999
So when this telephoning the fellow came out and he said,

00:20:03.208 --> 00:20:05.458
"Why do you want to telephone to this man?"

00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:08.625
He told that, "I know you want to take him to Mother

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.583
but you should not because Mother is doing a very great work,

00:20:11.709 --> 00:20:13.333
why do you want to take this fellow to her?

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.500
Why do you want to trouble her?"

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.917
He was surprised, how did he know all about this.

00:20:17.208 --> 00:20:22.333
They can read your minds. And he said, "No it's better that you go.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.999
Take this man to a temple somewhere outside Bombay

00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:32.166
and go and take one coconut and see the person

00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:35.333
who is in charge of the temple."

00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:39.999
So when he went with that coconut there, with this gentleman,

00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:43.333
he started telling all the stories without...

00:20:43.834 --> 00:20:47.333
They all were amazed both of them, how did they know all about it?

00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:52.583
So he took that coconut from him.

00:20:53.083 --> 00:20:55.999
And he said, "With this you have to give hundred rupees each."

00:20:56.417 --> 00:20:58.375
So they gave hundred rupees first to him.

00:20:58.542 --> 00:21:00.417
And it started off like that, you see.

00:21:00.709 --> 00:21:03.792
Till one day I came back from London.

00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:06.083
And I saw this and I said, "Where have you been?"

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:08.333
He was just shaking before Me like this.

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:11.125
So he said to know one, there was one gentleman in the temple,

00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:14.458
thing this that thing, I said, "What ? How did you do that?

00:21:14.792 --> 00:21:16.208
Why should you go to that place?"

00:21:16.417 --> 00:21:18.667
You see they can read minds and things.

00:21:18.917 --> 00:21:20.999
And ultimately that fellow never got cured,

00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:24.458
they lost all their money and this one died of heart.

00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:29.625
So it's a very common practice in India, everywhere,

00:21:29.959 --> 00:21:32.999
everywhere I find this a very common practice to use these spirits.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.083
Here also I find lots of people are going to these clairvoyant

00:21:36.375 --> 00:21:39.792
women and clairvoyant men and all that. It's very dangerous thing,

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:44.291
one should not deal with that area which we do not know.

00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:50.375
Is a very common thing and apart from that you see like this -

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:54.041
we have pentecostals, and that's all this same thing.

00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:58.291
We have pentecostals doing that ho ho ho ho ho ho stuff.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.333
Is nothing but that, because after all,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:08.375
if you have to get realized you become a decent person, isn't it?

00:22:10.834 --> 00:22:15.333
You become a sensible person, a saner person, a wiser person.

00:22:15.875 --> 00:22:20.375
You don't become a stupid fellow or you don't become an absurd

00:22:20.834 --> 00:22:23.166
and obtuse personality you don't develop, isn't it?

00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:26.458
We must also know that all such obtuse people

00:22:26.583 --> 00:22:28.750
cannot be realized souls, you see.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:34.625
They are funny faces, funny looking eyes

00:22:34.959 --> 00:22:37.208
and they are so greedy

00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:43.041
and they have no virtues, nothing, how can they be godly people?

00:22:43.792 --> 00:22:47.999
You should judge them by the way they live, by the style they live.

00:22:48.083 --> 00:22:54.250
You see a good man lives in a way that is very decent, decorous.

00:22:55.458 --> 00:23:00.792
Isn't it? Is the smallest thing that we should understand is that

00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:07.166
when God resides within us, when there is light,

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:11.625
you see in every walk of such a man there is light.

00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:16.208
You should have compassion, love, if he's a hot-tempered fellow,

00:23:16.917 --> 00:23:20.375
furious style then how can,

00:23:22.083 --> 00:23:24.667
how can he be claim to be godly?

00:23:26.083 --> 00:23:29.999
We must use our brains, but when they come to Me

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:32.625
only that time they start using in the other direction.

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:36.959
Because you're free to use. It's all right, I am happy in a way

00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:39.999
that you use it because you should be free to use it.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.917
But not to great extent also because you miss the point.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.667
And we are still worried about your realization, isn't it?

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:55.667
Y: No it's just that, so, you know all the different gurus

00:23:55.792 --> 00:23:57.999
Y: and all the different writings of gurus

00:23:58.291 --> 00:24:00.999
Y: say that, you know, when Kundalini rises -

00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:05.625
Y: if it rises - that when this happens is a, you know

00:24:06.166 --> 00:24:08.375
Y: great [?] or whatever you want to call it.

00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.250
SM: They are all, Y: It just happens, that happens.

00:24:12.999 --> 00:24:16.250
Y: If it rises. SM: You see, because they don't know the job,

00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:19.083
they don't know the job.

00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:22.999
SM: How can they claim they can raise the Kundalini?

00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:25.667
They don't know the job, not only that, they are anti-god people,

00:24:25.834 --> 00:24:27.999
How can they raise Kundalini, you just tell Me?

00:24:28.291 --> 00:24:31.291
A person who has no authority from God, how can he raise the Kundalini?

00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:34.917
It's a very recent thing, all also this is about fifty years back only

00:24:35.083 --> 00:24:38.333
people have started writing all this nonsense.

00:24:39.458 --> 00:24:42.083
And ancient books nobody reads, that's the trouble is.

00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:44.999
If you read Markandeya, who wrote in fourteen thousand years back.

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:48.291
He never said such a thing like that. He said, "Mother can do it."

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.999
Adishankaracharya in the sixth century said.

00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:54.792
I think Kabira was about,

00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:02.083
must be sixteenth century. Y: It's fifteen hundreds, yes.

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:05.999
SM: Ya, sixteenth century Kabira was, he said it so clearly.

00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:08.291
Nobody said all these things, but if

00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:11.792
you read a German you see writing about Kundalini

00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:16.959
or if you read some other gurus these pseudo gurus,

00:25:17.583 --> 00:25:20.375
they will say it because they don't know the job at all.

00:25:20.834 --> 00:25:22.375
There are not supposed to do it,

00:25:22.417 --> 00:25:24.208
so they are frightened to talk about it.

00:25:24.625 --> 00:25:28.333
And those even who say, even Muktananda, for example, said that

00:25:28.417 --> 00:25:30.999
he can raise the Kundalini, but look at him now.

00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:36.166
He has got, he's died with leaving sixty thousand crores.

00:25:37.166 --> 00:25:41.333
I don't know the Indian. 60,000 crores worth of diamonds he has left.

00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:45.166
and both of the disciples are fighting among themselves.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.000
There was a fellow who came to see Me

00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:51.291
who has been with him for sixteen years.

00:25:51.834 --> 00:25:53.125
He's here now, where is he?

00:25:53.333 --> 00:25:55.875
He's somewhere, Melbourne he is, he's in Melbourne.

00:25:55.999 --> 00:25:59.166
Poor man! You see, he he was buying a ticket

00:25:59.583 --> 00:26:05.041
from a agency, who the owner of which is My disciple.

00:26:05.583 --> 00:26:09.834
And he said "I am going now to India to meet this another lady,

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.750
Anandamayi Ma." So got such a fright, he said

00:26:12.834 --> 00:26:17.125
"Why are you going see her?" Because this gentleman

00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:20.583
Mehrotra's parents are ruined because of Anandamayi Ma.

00:26:20.959 --> 00:26:22.875
He said "don't go and see her, why do you want to go?"

00:26:23.166 --> 00:26:25.375
He said, "No I was with Muktananda for sixteen years

00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:27.875
and what I am left with is no money,

00:26:27.999 --> 00:26:30.417
no brains, nothing. I am a cabbage.

00:26:30.667 --> 00:26:35.375
I am good for nothing." Sixteen years! So he said "all right,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.999
You go to Mother and you just go and see her."

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.834
And he just walked into My house. That day I was having a very big dinner

00:26:42.999 --> 00:26:46.250
in My house, he just came and he said "such and such a person

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.959
has sent me, Mother, I have been sixteen years with him and

00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:51.041
I have to catch a plane in the evening."

00:26:51.333 --> 00:26:54.000
I said, "Now. I have to cook for so many people,

00:26:54.458 --> 00:26:57.458
what am I to do?" "All right," I said, "I'll talk to you."

00:26:57.834 --> 00:27:00.333
And I was amazed, the way he was ruined, you know.

00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:03.583
He was a rich man, he lost all his money, everything.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.792
But what people are enamored with, I just don't understand.

00:27:10.542 --> 00:27:12.999
He said, "what does he do, he used to make everyone jump."

00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:18.917
Now to make you jump is it, is it difficult? Anybody can jump.

00:27:22.417 --> 00:27:25.125
You should see his own lifestyle.

00:27:28.959 --> 00:27:31.417
All those gurus who have talked and you have read

00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:33.792
are mostly these modern pseudo ones,

00:27:33.834 --> 00:27:35.959
who know that there is market; also

00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:38.875
they have taken their birth. What will they gain? Nothing.

00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:42.999
They will go to hell, thatâ€™s all I can say. They have made money

00:27:43.083 --> 00:27:47.500
out of simple seekers, who are truthful, who are honest.

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:50.917
What's going to happen to them?

00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:57.959
But say, supposing it is, I say it is so simple,

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.166
so why not accept it? What's wrong in it, all right?

00:28:03.917 --> 00:28:06.834
Because they have said it is difficult, so must you accept that?

00:28:07.417 --> 00:28:09.667
But because I say it is simple you should accept Me.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.917
On the contrary. isn't it? If I say there's a diamond free

00:28:13.083 --> 00:28:16.709
for you, absolutely free, easily available. Will you stop

00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:19.291
not taking it? You will.

00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:23.458
That's what it is, it has to be simple. You just logically

00:28:23.583 --> 00:28:25.375
you understand, you are intelligent people.

00:28:25.667 --> 00:28:31.875
Anything that is vital has to be simple, has to be easy.

00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:36.041
God is not going to make your life miserable, will He? Why?

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.125
He's trying to make you so comfortable, so happy.

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:42.458
Why will He make you miserable? Logically you reach that point.

00:28:42.792 --> 00:28:46.500
These people do want you to be miserable and them to be happy.

00:28:46.999 --> 00:28:49.999
That's a different point.

00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:57.333
All right? So first you get your realization and then we'll talk about it.

00:28:57.709 --> 00:29:00.999
Hm? Now don't oppose it with your mind, just forget it.

00:29:01.875 --> 00:29:04.333
Whatever you have read is of no use, just now. You should think that

00:29:04.667 --> 00:29:07.834
I have gained nothing out of that. I mean if they cannot do it

00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:10.917
why are they talking about it? First of all ask them this question.

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:14.041
You better shut up then, if you don't know the job better keep quiet,

00:29:14.166 --> 00:29:16.999
isn't it? Like a doctor who says I can't operate.

00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:20.333
I can't do anything about you, I can't cure, itâ€™s very difficult.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.750
So why are you a doctor?

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.250
Nobody will do that, in a profession.

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:31.917
Only in this horrible profession, people do like that.

00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:36.667
To make everything look so horrid and so difficult. It is not.

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:42.083
As I told you that people have worked for you, have done the job for you.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.667
They have done it for you. Christ has done, Rama has done,

00:29:47.083 --> 00:29:49.458
Krishna has done. Everybody has worked it out in you.

00:29:49.917 --> 00:29:54.417
You are just ready to receive the result of their work.

00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:02.999
All right? So don't worry about what others are saying.

00:30:03.417 --> 00:30:05.959
Better have it yourself. Heh?

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.792
Now who else is there? Any other question?

00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:20.291
SM: Who? Y: Who are the Sat Gurus?

00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:24.291
SM: There are many, there are many Sat Gurus in India.

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:28.999
And what they tell Me is this, that "Mother it's difficult

00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:31.125
to convince people.

00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:35.375
They always take to falsehood, they're more fond of falsehood

00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:40.999
than of reality. They have always tortured the real people

00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:43.792
and even now they torture us."

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:46.792
With very great difficulty I sent one to America.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.291
He ran away within three days, because he couldn't bear it.

00:30:50.583 --> 00:30:54.291
He said their brains are placed the other way round, you see.

00:30:54.542 --> 00:30:56.834
They don't understand God, they understand money.

00:30:56.999 --> 00:31:00.000
They understand dollar. To them, dollar is their God.

00:31:00.375 --> 00:31:01.959
So he ran away within three days,

00:31:01.999 --> 00:31:03.417
you see he wouldn't stick on to the place.

00:31:03.583 --> 00:31:05.542
Because they just have no patience with people,

00:31:05.792 --> 00:31:08.667
they just don't understand what quality of human beings these are,

00:31:08.999 --> 00:31:10.999
that they can't understand God and things like that.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:17.375
Because they have achieved a very great height of purity.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.709
They can't bear impurity of others. You need a mother

00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:24.750
to have that patience and love. There are many.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:30.417
And I meet them, they come and see Me. There are many like that.

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:34.999
If there is somebody who is a real guru, you can make it out

00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:38.667
from the disciple also. The other day I met someone, who had

00:31:38.999 --> 00:31:41.959
a guru called Shantanand, who knows about Me, already told them.

00:31:42.083 --> 00:31:44.458
They all know about Me, even in Rangoon.

00:31:44.792 --> 00:31:47.458
There was a fellow, whom somebody went to see and he,

00:31:48.542 --> 00:31:50.417
he knew about Me.

00:31:51.709 --> 00:31:57.417
It's surprising. They know, because this is all predicted.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:02.542
All has been predicted. Very ancient times, say

00:32:04.208 --> 00:32:06.875
Bhrigu Muni was there, who lived about

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:11.166
twelve thousand or fourteen thousand years back.

00:32:11.625 --> 00:32:14.999
He has written about this, that this is going to happen, that

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.250
this is going to work out, the Kundalini is going to be raised.

00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:19.999
Have you got the book of Yogi Mahajan? Y: No, we don't have it Mother.

00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:23.041
We, they couldn't find another copy.

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:26.250
SM: Is has he got only one copy?

00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:29.041
But he sold so many books, he was saying. Y: "Really?"

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.417
SM: Yogi Mahajan. Y: That publication? SM: Yes, yes.

00:32:34.417 --> 00:32:37.083
Y: I didn't ask him actually, I asked in Maharashtra.

00:32:37.375 --> 00:32:42.667
SM: Oh, of that, of that. Yes the original book is of course

00:32:42.999 --> 00:32:45.999
original book is only one copy they have, but yogi Mahajan

00:32:46.208 --> 00:32:49.375
has written in his book at the end of it.

00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:55.375
Y: Oh, have we got the copy of that book? Yes, we've got that.

00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:58.999
Now this Yogi Mahajan is a person who was not a realized soul.

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:02.375
But he felt for people and tried to organize an ashram

00:33:02.834 --> 00:33:05.375
and all that, and he was calling people to his ashram.

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:08.417
But once he got realization he changed himself completely.

00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:11.166
He knew that this was the truth and he just changed.

00:33:11.375 --> 00:33:15.583
And now he's a great Sahaja Yogi. He has an ashram in Dharamshala.

00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:18.792
Y: There are a number of other books which you can pick up later

00:33:18.959 --> 00:33:21.667
once you get established in realization. This is one of them.

00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:25.667
SM: At the end of it, he said he's put something. Gavin has put or someone?

00:33:27.834 --> 00:33:29.750
SM: Out of that book, can you read it out. Y: Nadi Granth.

00:33:29.999 --> 00:33:30.999
SM: Yes you read out.

00:33:31.959 --> 00:33:34.750
Now the whole chapter is also on this subject. Y: OK. SM: It's

00:33:34.999 --> 00:33:38.917
Y: OK. SM: You see it's a very small chapter. Y: Yes yes OK.

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:41.208
SM: Yes, just see this.

00:33:41.999 --> 00:33:45.959
Y: In the period of distress about the fiftieth century B.C.,

00:33:46.208 --> 00:33:48.083
Lord Krishna came to uphold Dharma, and

00:33:48.417 --> 00:33:49.834
He stated in the Bhagavad Gita:

00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:53.375
Whenever there is a decline in righteousness and a rise in

00:33:53.834 --> 00:33:57.083
unrighteousness, then I send forth Myself. And indeed

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.875
in the age of darkness 2000 years ago Christ came forth to save

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:04.999
mankind. He too said, I will pray to the father and He should

00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:08.834
give you another comforter, that He may abide with you forever.

00:34:09.542 --> 00:34:11.875
What could be a more troubled period than ours,

00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:15.250
when there is a crying need for the savior? Will He not come?

00:34:15.667 --> 00:34:18.667
But the divine blessing is on mankind, and as promised

00:34:18.999 --> 00:34:22.999
She has come as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. It was prophesized.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.792
The manifestation of the spiritual reality in the modern world

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:31.625
has been foreseen by realized seers and sages since ancient times.

00:34:32.291 --> 00:34:35.999
In America, Jean Dickson predicted the birth of the coming Avatar or

00:34:36.125 --> 00:34:39.999
divine incarnation in about 24...in 1924.

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.208
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi was born on the 21st of March 1923.

00:34:44.834 --> 00:34:47.999
In England, William Blake prophesized very clearly in his poetry

00:34:48.417 --> 00:34:51.625
the coming age when men of God would become Prophets,

00:34:51.709 --> 00:34:53.625
empowered to make others Prophets.

00:34:54.208 --> 00:34:58.041
Sahaja Yogis giving realization to the guru tattwa in others.

00:34:58.792 --> 00:35:02.083
Many of the places specifically mentioned by Blake have proved to be

00:35:02.458 --> 00:35:05.667
closely connected with the development of Sahaja Yoga in England,

00:35:05.999 --> 00:35:07.999
especially the Vale of Lambeth, where the first Ashram

00:35:08.458 --> 00:35:12.083
was established, and other locations connected with

00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:14.999
the various residences of Shri Mataji.

00:35:15.917 --> 00:35:18.999
Among all the ancient writers of astrological prediction,

00:35:19.667 --> 00:35:23.166
the greatest master is Bhrigu rishi, who lived more then 2000

00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:27.709
years ago. His two great treatises... SM: 2000 years ago!

00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:32.458
That's wrong. Y: It's incorrect is it? Yes, it should be twelve thousand.

00:35:32.999 --> 00:35:38.291
...His two great treatises, The Bhrigu Samhita

00:35:38.834 --> 00:35:42.208
and the Nadi Granth, written on the leaves of lotus palm

00:35:42.834 --> 00:35:45.999
describe respectively the horoscope of the man according to the

00:35:46.375 --> 00:35:49.667
the combinations and permutations of stars at his birth,

00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:53.125
and the future world events of spiritual significance.

00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:56.750
At the present time when so many are seeking the new age

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.792
and so many self-certified teachers and masters are floating

00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:02.999
enterprises of all kinds, to attract the seekers,

00:36:03.458 --> 00:36:05.999
it would help if we tallied the descriptions given in ancient

00:36:06.417 --> 00:36:08.542
prophecies against the modern reality.

00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:12.125
Thus. we should be able to recognize the incarnation, described

00:36:12.667 --> 00:36:15.750
by our Lord Jesus Christ, as the redeemer, the counselor,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.041
the comforter, who will instruct in all things concerning

00:36:19.375 --> 00:36:22.875
sin and judgment. Many have predicted that this incarnation

00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:27.041
will be an expression of the female aspect, The Holy Spirit,

00:36:27.417 --> 00:36:31.166
or Adi Shakti of Indian tradition. These ancient writings are replete

00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:34.375
with proofs of the advent of Shri Mataji as the saviour of

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:38.333
modern times. Her person, her teachings, and the Nirmala Vidya,

00:36:38.709 --> 00:36:41.250
which means pure Knowledge, which She teaches, are the

00:36:41.959 --> 00:36:43.166
fulfillment of these prophecies.

00:36:43.959 --> 00:36:45.834
The clearest of these indications are contained in

00:36:46.125 --> 00:36:49.166
Bhrigu's Nadi Granth, which was edited

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:53.959
with Marathi commentary by another sage, Bhujender?

00:36:54.208 --> 00:36:57.041
SM: Bhujender. Y: Bhujender, about 300 years ago.

00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:00.999
According to the Nadi Granth, it stated that in 1970

00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:04.792
a new transformation in human consciousness will commence.

00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:11.458
SM: It will start. Y: The [ ] period, the period

00:37:11.917 --> 00:37:15.792
preceding Kali yuga, and Kali yuga itself will end.

00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:20.375
Kali yuga is the age of darkness. That period will end

00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:23.999
after the death of a yogi in 1922,

00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:27.041
and that was probably Sai Nath. SM: Ya.

00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:34.250
A great Maha Yogi will take birth. This Maha Yogi will be

00:37:34.917 --> 00:37:38.667
an incarnation of the Holy Ghost and will embody all the divine powers

00:37:38.999 --> 00:37:42.834
of God, or the Parabrahma. That is, She will be the one that

00:37:43.166 --> 00:37:47.166
controls the divine power. That yogi will have the Shakti, or the power,

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:51.999
of doing or not doing. In previous ages, seekers of truth had to take

00:37:52.417 --> 00:37:55.999
had to take to devotion, or Bhakti, or knowledge, or gyana,

00:37:56.542 --> 00:37:59.917
Patanjali Yoga and all such different method and disciplines

00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:02.999
in order to achieve the joy of Moksha, or liberation.

00:38:03.667 --> 00:38:07.250
Thus they could achieve the fulfillment of their heartfelt

00:38:07.999 --> 00:38:11.417
duty of life and get their hearts' meaning. In those days,

00:38:11.999 --> 00:38:15.083
one had to undergo a very severe type of penance in order to awaken

00:38:15.999 --> 00:38:19.333
the sleeping spiritual energy of Kundalini and to make it ascend

00:38:19.917 --> 00:38:21.709
through the different subtle centers. SM: Your question

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:25.291
is answered, all right? Y: But by the grace of the unprecedented

00:38:25.917 --> 00:38:29.000
method introduced by this Maha Yogi, the seekers will be able to

00:38:29.458 --> 00:38:33.291
achieve the joy of Moksha in their own lifetime, spontaneously,

00:38:33.834 --> 00:38:37.000
and they will be able to see the rising of Kundalini.

00:38:37.875 --> 00:38:41.333
There will be no need to give up the body by living Samadhi, but...

00:38:41.959 --> 00:38:46.291
which means a method adopted of shutting oneself in a cave

00:38:46.875 --> 00:38:48.291
and dying there while in meditation...

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:52.834
but by the capacity of the yoga, one will even be able to achieve victory

00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:56.125
over death. There will be neither need to leave the body

00:38:56.667 --> 00:39:00.625
nor to think of your rebirth. The realized soul through this yoga

00:39:00.999 --> 00:39:03.834
will not have to worry about food, clothing or shelter.

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:07.166
In other words, you'll be well cared for. Diseases and mental

00:39:07.834 --> 00:39:10.291
sickness will be completely destroyed and such people will not

00:39:10.875 --> 00:39:13.875
need the institutions known as hospitals anymore.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.999
They will have a power to develop a subtle body

00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:20.834
and the other powers that will be given to them. And that's the end

00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:24.625
of the quotation, and this was written 12,000 years ago.

00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:30.000
SM: Nadi Granth. That it will start in nineteen... because you see,

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.750
the whole thing was in Sanskrit language, so it had to be again

00:39:34.041 --> 00:39:37.667
translated to be brought up to date. Because, if it

00:39:37.999 --> 00:39:42.166
was written so old as that, in our way of saying

00:39:42.875 --> 00:39:45.875
that what year it is, he, so he brought the whole calculation

00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:48.208
and he said it will start in 1970.

00:39:48.999 --> 00:39:53.125
And it really started in 1970, this work of Mine, started in 1970.

00:39:54.166 --> 00:39:56.959
I mean there are so many ways by which one can understand.

00:39:57.333 --> 00:40:00.792
But in the intermediate period of this fifty years,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.999
all these people came up, they wrote books and things like that.

00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:07.875
Writing books takes nothing. I have not written any book so far.

00:40:08.333 --> 00:40:11.125
I mean this is, I'm hearing for the first time, what they have written.

00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:13.959
But I have seen this Nadi Granth before, with My own eyes.

00:40:14.417 --> 00:40:16.750
Y: But only a couple of years ago, they showed it to You.

00:40:17.083 --> 00:40:19.999
SM: Yes, they showed Me about two years back. And

00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:24.083
I saw this book only, when we were in Sholapur. Y: I think it was last year,

00:40:24.458 --> 00:40:27.458
last year. SM: Yes, last year. Last year they showed Me this book.

00:40:27.999 --> 00:40:30.750
But I've read this in Marathi language.

00:40:31.291 --> 00:40:33.999
But this one is done by another, that Yogi Mahajan,

00:40:34.417 --> 00:40:37.625
who has put few things... William Blake was another...

00:40:38.792 --> 00:40:41.166
Y: I'll just finish, because it's interesting about your birth, Mother.

00:40:41.667 --> 00:40:44.667
Every one of these predictions is fulfilled in the life and work

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.041
of Mataji Nirmala Devi. She was born at the geographical center

00:40:48.458 --> 00:40:51.917
of India, in a hill station known as Chindwara exactly at noon

00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:56.667
on the 21st of March, 1923, the day of the spring equinox

00:40:57.166 --> 00:41:00.999
when day and night are equal. On the 5th of May 1970, in fact,

00:41:01.417 --> 00:41:03.999
Shri Mataji introduced the method of Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:04.583 --> 00:41:07.458
by which realization is achieved effortlessly and without any

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:11.041
penances or fasting, let alone living death from the part of the

00:41:11.709 --> 00:41:15.000
seeker. SM: En masse, is the point. Y: The spirit manifests as the

00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:18.999
the witness state and man conquers his appetite through detachment.

00:41:19.542 --> 00:41:22.917
Thousands have seen the rising of Kundalini and the pulsing of the

00:41:23.166 --> 00:41:25.999
different Chakras when Shri Mataji awakens the secret powers

00:41:26.792 --> 00:41:30.291
of the seven centers. This happening is one which happens

00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:34.667
to people en masse, and we have seen thousands of people at one

00:41:34.999 --> 00:41:36.667
time gain their self-realization.

00:41:37.834 --> 00:41:41.999
C G Jung spoke of a collective unconscious common to all mankind,

00:41:42.417 --> 00:41:45.458
when he himself had glimpsed through his own dreams and insights,

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:48.999
and those of his patients. He also knew and taught that this

00:41:49.375 --> 00:41:52.166
collective realm is only to be attained by a maturing process of

00:41:52.709 --> 00:41:56.041
self-realization, casting off illusions and imaginings which

00:41:56.625 --> 00:41:59.625
hide the collective reality and hinder its realization

00:41:59.959 --> 00:42:03.166
into collective consciousness with the dawning of a new awareness.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.999
Sahaja Yogis know that this describes how Kundalini herself

00:42:07.417 --> 00:42:10.875
records her own history and carries the scars of our self-

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:14.625
inflicted injuries. All this knowledge becomes an open book

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:18.041
after Self-realization and aids the recovery of the subject.

00:42:18.625 --> 00:42:21.625
It is true also that as one establishes one's realization by

00:42:21.999 --> 00:42:25.959
giving it to others, so also material problems of income, food

00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:30.959
and shelter all miraculously are solved. This we have seen

00:42:31.417 --> 00:42:34.041
and experienced, it's a fact. The vibratory knowledge is an

00:42:34.583 --> 00:42:37.667
absolute knowledge. Shri Mataji Herself never consults any books

00:42:38.417 --> 00:42:40.999
but radiates innate knowledge on every subject with

00:42:41.291 --> 00:42:44.999
astonishing insight and understanding. Nirmala Devi Sahaja

00:42:45.458 --> 00:42:48.875
Yoga is beyond rational thought, it is like the sprouting of a seed

00:42:49.166 --> 00:42:51.999
into a great big tree, you cannot explain it.

00:42:52.583 --> 00:42:55.083
Now we have to proclaim that this is the fulfillment of the

00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:58.750
ancient prophecies, this is the revelation and the testament

00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:03.417
of modern times. SM: I didn't even have time to read this.

00:43:06.999 --> 00:43:09.125
All right. So, that's it. All right?

00:43:09.999 --> 00:43:13.750
Now. Yes? Y: Excuse me would you like to comment on books like Yoga Vashishtha.

00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:16.999
SM: Yoga Vashishta is, you see Yoga Vashishta

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.667
and all these books are written at a time,

00:43:21.083 --> 00:43:24.333
you see, when we had a certain pattern of life.

00:43:24.667 --> 00:43:28.208
Ancient times, you see. Vashishtha was at the Rama's time.

00:43:28.625 --> 00:43:32.542
So it was about eight thousand years back, you can say. About.

00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:36.375
And the pattern of life he had, even Rama's life was like that,

00:43:36.834 --> 00:43:39.999
that children who were about five years of age were sent

00:43:40.792 --> 00:43:45.208
to a guru in a forest. And they were kept absolutely in

00:43:45.834 --> 00:43:49.041
a very pure relationship and a pure understanding of life.

00:43:49.709 --> 00:43:51.333
In complete purity. So much so

00:43:51.792 --> 00:43:54.999
that every university was called as Gotra, gotra.

00:43:55.417 --> 00:43:59.583
Means, is the, that's your forefather's place.

00:44:00.125 --> 00:44:03.417
Now everybody in India today also has a gotra, and they never

00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:06.583
marry among the same gotras, means, you see My forefathers

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.709
who belong to one gotra, nobody can, I cannot marry a person

00:44:11.999 --> 00:44:15.166
who belongs to the same gotra. So the celibacy is maintained to

00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:18.709
that limit, that we are brothers and sisters. Now thousands of

00:44:19.083 --> 00:44:21.458
years back also we are still brothers and sisters.

00:44:21.999 --> 00:44:27.333
It's like that. In those days, you see, all these things were sort of practiced,

00:44:27.583 --> 00:44:31.500
all these patanjali Yoga, Yoga Vashishtha and all these things were

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.999
practiced, but that's not so today. Today the time is very limited,

00:44:36.417 --> 00:44:41.999
the crisis is complete. You have to take to something fast,

00:44:42.291 --> 00:44:45.417
you see there's emergency there. So those books were meant

00:44:45.792 --> 00:44:47.458
for those days, this was all right,

00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:49.417
but how many people got realization at that time?

00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:53.959
Very few. Only Nachiketa, one person, who was the disciple of Janaka,

00:44:54.208 --> 00:44:57.583
father of Sita. That's all. One person got realization in those days.

00:44:57.959 --> 00:45:00.417
Rama didn't give realization to anyone. He did not.

00:45:00.999 --> 00:45:02.875
Because that was not the time to give realization.

00:45:03.083 --> 00:45:05.583
Now today is the time to give realization. All right?

00:45:05.917 --> 00:45:08.999
So every book has its own place at that particular period.

00:45:09.999 --> 00:45:12.583
At the time of Christ, we needed a particular thing.

00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:16.667
Before that we needed Moses. Before that we needed other things.

00:45:16.875 --> 00:45:18.999
So whatever was needed at that particular time,

00:45:19.291 --> 00:45:20.792
that is how they tell it.

00:45:21.999 --> 00:45:24.750
All right? At this time what we need is realization

00:45:25.083 --> 00:45:29.291
My main attention is on giving you realization. Nothing else.

00:45:29.999 --> 00:45:32.959
That's all. The first thing is that. Then other things will come.

00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:35.542
Now you'll understand Yoga Vashishtha very well.

00:45:35.834 --> 00:45:38.750
Because those days people lead a very righteous life,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.166
they did not need anything to sustain themselves, that righteousness,

00:45:42.917 --> 00:45:45.250
that purity. They lived like that because the

00:45:45.583 --> 00:45:47.333
the whole system was built upon that.

00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:51.917
They lead a very nice life, celibate life of purity, not

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:55.750
because they were forced or they were conditioned but because

00:45:56.166 --> 00:45:58.792
they lead in such circumstances all like brothers and sisters,

00:45:58.999 --> 00:46:01.041
that they never felt that way.

00:46:02.375 --> 00:46:04.875
They had very good concentrated married life and

00:46:05.375 --> 00:46:06.667
everything was arranged very well,

00:46:06.999 --> 00:46:10.917
but now that society is no more. All right?

00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:21.417
So how many of you felt the cool breeze yesterday, let's see.

00:46:23.291 --> 00:46:26.250
That's good. Y: How many did not?

00:46:27.375 --> 00:46:29.417
Did not: one, two, three.

00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:33.375
SM: Now first of all, have you got a guru before?

00:46:35.583 --> 00:46:37.750
Y: Yes well, she has. SM: Yes. What about you?

00:46:38.125 --> 00:46:40.625
Another seeker: I had Yogananda Y: Yogananda.

00:46:40.999 --> 00:46:45.250
Seeker: Seven years of TM and two and a half years of ...

00:46:47.166 --> 00:46:49.959
SM: Doesn't matter. What. Seeker: It really blew my...

00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:52.208
SM: I know, I know, I know, it is so. You don't know

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:54.999
people suffer from epilepsy this horrible TM business,

00:46:55.417 --> 00:46:59.999
you see. You pay for becoming mad. It's that. What about you?

00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:03.333
Seeker: Ananda Murti. SM: Hmm? Seeker: Ananda Murti. SM: Ananda Marg.

00:47:03.999 --> 00:47:08.917
Y: Ananda Murti. Not Ananda Marga, was it? Seeker: Yeah. Y: Ananada Marg.

00:47:09.291 --> 00:47:14.625
SM: Hmm. Seeker: ... SM: That's hard. We have people, now his own wife

00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:17.291
has come to Me, she is a Sahaja Yogini.

00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:20.999
His own wife. Last time she got her realization, when we were in Delhi.

00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:24.750
She tried for three years, his own wife, his own

00:47:26.208 --> 00:47:29.583
people who are in Calcutta, and she went and told him also

00:47:29.999 --> 00:47:32.458
that you better take to better life now, you have done a lot of things.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.542
But you see he cannot change himself, cannot change. That Sarkar

00:47:36.999 --> 00:47:39.583
who was his right hand, first he came to see Me.

00:47:39.999 --> 00:47:42.999
I was in a hotel. He came to see Me with a police escort,

00:47:43.291 --> 00:47:46.000
and my husband was quite surprised, he said "what's this going on here?" I said,

00:47:46.458 --> 00:47:48.250
"I don't know why he has come with the police escort."

00:47:48.834 --> 00:47:52.417
Actually he was the one first who ran away from Calcutta,

00:47:52.959 --> 00:47:55.667
went to Lucknow and took a jeep and then came to Delhi

00:47:56.166 --> 00:47:57.875
and then he came to see Me.

00:47:59.792 --> 00:48:03.000
Now he's all right, but later on he was threatened.

00:48:03.458 --> 00:48:05.667
He and his wife both were threatened.

00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:09.125
So he wanted to come to England but somehow or other this all subsided.

00:48:09.542 --> 00:48:14.083
Now the wife of this Anand Marg came to Me. She's got realization.

00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:20.792
So that's what, it solves the problem, all right? Doesn't matter.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.999
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

00:48:23.417 --> 00:48:24.750
You better get your realization.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:31.083
What about you, you felt the cool breeze there, you two?

00:48:31.999 --> 00:48:35.959
Seeker: The only thing I felt was a very heavy weight in both my whole arms.

00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:41.583
Yes, you have been doing Hatha Yoga, isn't it?

00:48:41.999 --> 00:48:43.999
Seeker: Ya we've been doing Hath Yoga for eighteen months.

00:48:44.375 --> 00:48:47.333
SM: That's why. Hatha Yoga also is the same thing, you see.

00:48:47.583 --> 00:48:50.875
Hatha yoga is just a part, a wee part of it, you see. We too do

00:48:51.417 --> 00:48:54.542
Hatha Yoga, but after realization, and according

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:57.417
to the Kundalini's movement, you see, where the Kundalini is,

00:48:57.917 --> 00:49:01.417
not before that. Because it is absurd, you see, to do anything,

00:49:01.875 --> 00:49:05.291
any medicine... Come here come, come, come, come, come forward,

00:49:05.999 --> 00:49:09.458
come forward it's all right, come forward yes, yes.

00:49:14.083 --> 00:49:16.959
So this Hatha Yoga also is

00:49:18.417 --> 00:49:21.709
like taking all the medicines without any discrimination.

00:49:22.375 --> 00:49:28.750
Seeker: Swami Venkatesananada, he died recently. SM: Who?

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:36.125
Y: Swami Venkatesananada, he died recently. Seeker: He died in South Africa.

00:49:36.625 --> 00:49:38.375
SM: What did he teach you? Y: In South Africa.

00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:40.709
SM: What did he teach you, this,

00:49:41.166 --> 00:49:44.125
Hatha Yoga, means physical exercises? Seeker: Have you not heard of him? He's very famous.

00:49:47.375 --> 00:49:50.208
Y: He said, have you not heard of him? He's very famous.

00:49:50.792 --> 00:49:53.750
SM: Or notorious? Seeker: No, no he's a very,

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:57.999
a very spiritual man, travels all over the world.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:02.792
SM: No he's not. Because you should have got another experience,

00:50:03.125 --> 00:50:07.291
if he was really so. See, those who talk of physical being

00:50:07.792 --> 00:50:11.792
too much is not a real person. You see? This is not an

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:16.125
acrobatic play, is it? Just to become something in the circus.

00:50:16.667 --> 00:50:18.999
We have to be human beings first of all. Seeker: He speaks

00:50:19.542 --> 00:50:22.125
of the enlightenment. Is there enlightenment in realization,

00:50:22.583 --> 00:50:23.542
is that a different thing?

00:50:23.875 --> 00:50:27.083
SM: They can speak, what they achieve is that you felt happy.

00:50:28.583 --> 00:50:32.208
Otherwise if you feel this way, the heaviness and all that,

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:36.083
then thatâ€™s not realization at all, isn't it? All right?

00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:42.291
They are very notorious one by one. But thank God

00:50:42.667 --> 00:50:44.583
they are all getting exposed, you see.

00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:46.999
Ten years back when I told them all about them, they were all

00:50:47.375 --> 00:50:50.999
all up in arms against Me.

00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:52.999
And people warned Me they are going to kill Me.

00:50:53.291 --> 00:50:54.999
I said, "Let them try."

00:50:55.542 --> 00:50:58.083
None of them filed a suit against Me.

00:50:58.458 --> 00:51:02.250
I told their names, and I told everything of them, none of them...

00:51:03.583 --> 00:51:08.041
Because falsehood has cowardice in it. They are cowards.

00:51:08.792 --> 00:51:10.875
They know they are doing wrong things.

00:51:11.667 --> 00:51:14.834
Seeker: Swami Shivananada was he the same, was he in the wrong?

00:51:15.208 --> 00:51:18.166
SM: Who is this? Y: Swami Shivananada. SM: What did he do?

00:51:18.458 --> 00:51:21.999
Shivananada also, what did he do, see now? What has he done?

00:51:22.917 --> 00:51:26.375
On the contrary, he is the one who was denied by

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.333
some gurus in the Himalayas

00:51:29.709 --> 00:51:32.625
because he was no good. So he came down and started teaching

00:51:32.999 --> 00:51:36.500
all kinds of exercises, but he never did any exercise himself.

00:51:37.333 --> 00:51:40.583
Made others do all the exercises of the world. And then another

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.750
is that, what's her name is, Yogi Shakti Maa. She's another person.

00:51:45.834 --> 00:51:47.875
There is nothing in them, all hollow personalities.

00:51:48.417 --> 00:51:51.667
You are thousand times better than them. Seeker: And the Dalai Lama, is he in the same...

00:51:54.875 --> 00:51:58.417
You see, there was a book, being written about something

00:51:58.999 --> 00:52:02.458
and they wanted to have an introduction of Dalai Lama, to that book.

00:52:03.792 --> 00:52:07.166
But Indians said don't put his name, otherwise it won't sell in India.

00:52:07.834 --> 00:52:10.458
We don't like him, he is like a parasite. He was a parasite in

00:52:10.999 --> 00:52:12.792
Tibet, now he has come as parasite here.

00:52:13.583 --> 00:52:15.125
They are all  parasites, they are supraconscious people,

00:52:15.625 --> 00:52:17.999
that's all. What good he has done to anyone?

00:52:18.875 --> 00:52:22.417
Living freely at the cost of that poor country Tibet and now

00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:24.999
in India, you see, there was a parliament question about him.

00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:27.917
Why should we support this man and his paraphernalia,

00:52:28.208 --> 00:52:29.999
which has run away from there.

00:52:32.999 --> 00:52:35.999
We should find out what they have done, what they talk about.

00:52:36.999 --> 00:52:38.999
Seeker: So all these gurus are...

00:52:39.458 --> 00:52:42.250
Modern times there are many who are true gurus also.

00:52:43.542 --> 00:52:46.959
But they are not in the market. They are not in the market now.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.041
This Dalai Lama fellow has had a doctor with him,

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:53.834
who used to do all kinds of things and Y: He is dead now?

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.375
SM: Thank God, he's dead. And he really ruined people, this doctor

00:52:57.542 --> 00:52:59.375
you know, he used to give some sort of a ...,

00:52:59.542 --> 00:53:01.999
I don't know what he gave to these people who went to him, but

00:53:02.417 --> 00:53:05.792
they came to Me afterwards and they were all sick, all sick people.

00:53:06.333 --> 00:53:09.083
People don't like him in India. If you take Dalai Lama's name

00:53:09.417 --> 00:53:10.999
they say, all right, you are one of them,

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.875
they think something wrong there.

00:53:15.041 --> 00:53:17.625
You see, because from outside how will you know?

00:53:18.667 --> 00:53:21.667
How will you know? Simple thing as that.

00:53:23.875 --> 00:53:26.750
Yogi: would you say Krishnamurti was a true guru or a false guru?

00:53:26.792 --> 00:53:30.333
Now Krishnamurti was another one. Now see, you've read Krishnamurti?

00:53:30.417 --> 00:53:33.458
Y: He's had a great deal of...? SM: That's the problem.

00:53:34.166 --> 00:53:37.458
See now, Krishnamurti what he said, was that,

00:53:37.792 --> 00:53:40.291
he tried to be very honest about things, and he said that

00:53:40.375 --> 00:53:45.000
there is no true guru, you have to be your own guru. It's not true.

00:53:45.875 --> 00:53:49.166
Of course there are fake gurus but there are good gurus also.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.834
You see, there has to be somebody real to create artificial,

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:56.208
isn't it? If you see an artificial flower, there has to be

00:53:56.625 --> 00:53:59.542
a real flower, otherwise how do you get your ideas?

00:53:59.959 --> 00:54:03.166
This is a very big mistake, and that's how everyone who has read

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.458
you see, thinks, thinks, thinks, thinks,

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.542
and you just see what happens to you.

00:54:09.041 --> 00:54:11.083
You become mad, thinking like that. You see

00:54:11.583 --> 00:54:14.875
some people talk like him nowadays, just talk like him.

00:54:15.583 --> 00:54:18.625
There's nothing inside. You see My, My point is.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.999
Y: I got a personal audience with him and I asked him,

00:54:22.458 --> 00:54:27.125
why does he do what he does, and his answer was: "Does a rose ask why?"

00:54:32.625 --> 00:54:35.250
Y: He's a very beautiful thinker, but I don't...

00:54:36.709 --> 00:54:39.417
SM: You see thinking is not going to lead you there just understand.

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:42.250
You can also think, you could be a more beautiful thinker,

00:54:42.792 --> 00:54:45.375
but makes no difference. Because what you have to do

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.375
is to logically reach a point.

00:54:47.583 --> 00:54:50.417
See thinking is just to logically reach a point

00:54:50.834 --> 00:54:54.333
and then ascend, you see that is for proper thinking,

00:54:54.667 --> 00:54:58.667
is to understand, what to expect. Denying everyone is not proper.

00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:01.750
You must have discretion, you must have discretion.

00:55:01.999 --> 00:55:04.583
And there has to be somebody true also.

00:55:04.875 --> 00:55:08.792
You see this is complete negative business, that deny everyone.

00:55:12.917 --> 00:55:19.041
Yogini: I have a question. I believe that this is a very true way of

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.959
sustaining the chakras and keeping them in order

00:55:22.166 --> 00:55:24.750
in order to make your kundalini grow.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:30.999
Could you, would you say that there are many ways

00:55:31.417 --> 00:55:34.583
to have realization... SM: No. Y: ...by yourself, on you own?

00:55:34.999 --> 00:55:38.750
SM: No, there is no other way. Only Kundalini awakening is the only way.

00:55:38.959 --> 00:55:41.542
You must reach the logical conclusion also there.

00:55:41.875 --> 00:55:45.291
Because, you see, that's how we are made. You see, in an instrument

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:48.709
is there any other way but to connect this to the mains? Nothing.

00:55:48.999 --> 00:55:51.375
It has to be connected to the mains. Is there any other way

00:55:51.792 --> 00:55:54.792
that the seeds sprouts? Is the same thing, is all everyone is made

00:55:55.208 --> 00:55:57.959
like that, now somebody, if somebody laughs,

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:02.500
like crying, then you will say he's absurd.

00:56:02.875 --> 00:56:05.875
Normally you laugh, the way everyone laughs, isn't it?

00:56:06.125 --> 00:56:09.458
In the same way the Kundalini rises, the way it rises.

00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:12.792
That's the only way, there is no other way out, no other way out.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.875
Everybody who has got realization

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.375
has got through Kundalini awakening.

00:56:20.625 --> 00:56:26.083
Yogi: Yoganandra, of course, has gone to his mahasamadhi, but

00:56:29.875 --> 00:56:34.208
do You feel whether he were realized or not?

00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:37.417
He was trying to teach self-realization. Do you feel,

00:56:37.959 --> 00:56:42.458
Do you feel it isn't on, once the person is dead?

00:56:42.917 --> 00:56:46.583
SM: What's it? When you are dead then you get samadhi.

00:56:46.999 --> 00:56:51.291
Y: That he cannot be a guru, because he's dead?

00:56:52.125 --> 00:56:54.291
Different Y: Can he still be a guru, even after his death?

00:56:54.792 --> 00:56:59.999
Assuming he, assuming even though he got, he was not a realized soul,

00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:02.583
but he did contribute something to teaching...

00:57:03.208 --> 00:57:05.999
SM: No. Y: ...He took mahasamadhi after death,

00:57:06.375 --> 00:57:09.999
can he be a teacher? SM: No, no, no, if he is not a realized soul

00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:12.999
he has no business to be there, first of all.

00:57:13.291 --> 00:57:17.375
Y: He's a teacher, he was almost using the same words you just used.

00:57:17.625 --> 00:57:20.333
SM: No but they can say the same things, My child, you see,

00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:24.208
they can say the same thing, they, because it is written.

00:57:24.458 --> 00:57:27.083
It's written everywhere. You see even if you go to a church

00:57:27.417 --> 00:57:29.000
the priest says the same thing.

00:57:29.125 --> 00:57:33.208
Saying is not the main thing. Is whether he is a realized soul or not.

00:57:33.542 --> 00:57:36.917
Apart from realized soul, there are many realized souls also. Now, for example,

00:57:37.291 --> 00:57:39.792
in Sahaja Yoga if you come, you get your realization, you are a realized soul.

00:57:39.875 --> 00:57:42.959
But are you a master of that or not? That is very important.

00:57:43.125 --> 00:57:46.083
Unless and until you have a entered into the kingdom of God,

00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:49.125
you have no authority to talk about it. Say, I will tell you a

00:57:49.333 --> 00:57:52.458
very simple example. Now, supposing on the road you find

00:57:52.792 --> 00:57:55.792
a man standing and saying go this way and go that way.

00:57:55.917 --> 00:57:58.917
If he's a policeman, you will listen to him, but if he is not a policeman

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.999
you'll say, "You who are you, you are mad? Why are you telling me?"

00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:04.583
They have no authority to do it. All right?

00:58:04.917 --> 00:58:07.208
That's why, whether he is dead or living, they call

00:58:07.709 --> 00:58:10.542
"We have got mahasamadhi," this is not true, they cannot.

00:58:11.166 --> 00:58:13.500
They can only posses you. That's all.

00:58:13.917 --> 00:58:15.667
Because the realized soul does not possess,

00:58:15.917 --> 00:58:19.083
only these people can possess. You see,

00:58:19.166 --> 00:58:22.625
the teaching can be in a priest can say the same thing in a church.

00:58:22.792 --> 00:58:25.333
Anybody can do it, but they are not realized souls,

00:58:25.458 --> 00:58:28.542
is the point, how you do it. It becomes a conditioning on you.

00:58:28.917 --> 00:58:31.333
You see? If a person who is not a realized soul and

00:58:31.834 --> 00:58:35.417
does not give you realization, it becomes a conditioning for him.

00:58:35.959 --> 00:58:38.999
It's not reality. You take it because you think it's good.

00:58:39.041 --> 00:58:41.792
Rationally you think it's a good thing, rationally,

00:58:41.999 --> 00:58:45.500
that you should do a good thing, and all that. But doesn't help much.

00:58:45.834 --> 00:58:49.125
What helps you the most is that you become capable of it.

00:58:49.834 --> 00:58:52.583
That you enjoy it, it becomes your second nature.

00:58:53.333 --> 00:58:55.083
It becomes part and parcel of you.

00:58:55.208 --> 00:58:58.166
Y: There's another one, Vivekananda wrote thousands of books in India.

00:58:58.458 --> 00:59:01.750
SM: But what has he given? Y: He gave nothing, except this...

00:59:01.999 --> 00:59:04.291
SM: All, you see, we know, because those who know,

00:59:04.834 --> 00:59:07.750
know Vivekanada very well, because those who have read the

00:59:07.999 --> 00:59:11.458
original books know that he has taken from other books and said something.

00:59:11.917 --> 00:59:15.333
So it nothing special, you see. You people only know Bible, supposing,

00:59:15.542 --> 00:59:18.458
and somebody writes the thing on Bible,

00:59:18.999 --> 00:59:21.208
you won't call him Vivekananda, you won't.

00:59:21.375 --> 00:59:23.750
But because he writes about Vedas and all that

00:59:23.792 --> 00:59:25.834
which you have not read so you call him Vivekananada.

00:59:25.959 --> 00:59:29.834
That's what it is. You see anybody can read those books and can write.

00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:33.542
Anyone can. There's nothing so special.

00:59:37.959 --> 00:59:42.000
Y: In Perth we get ten day meditation courses, one is ... by doctor Goenka.

00:59:44.583 --> 00:59:48.166
SM: You cannot have courses in this, My child. It's a living process.

00:59:49.417 --> 00:59:52.792
You cannot have courses, you see. You cannot have courses.

00:59:53.792 --> 00:59:57.291
It's all, there is another going those courses, what do you get?

00:59:57.709 --> 00:59:59.875
Nothing. Have you seen anybody getting realization?

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.041
First thing if somebody can give you collective consciousness

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:06.083
than you should believe that person.

01:00:07.999 --> 01:00:11.333
You see, it's like, people think that we can pay for a course.

01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:14.667
I will give you another little story of My grandchildren.

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:19.250
I have two granddaughters, who are from the first daughter

01:00:19.709 --> 01:00:21.999
and they are realized souls and born realized.

01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:24.542
So one day the little one, she was about three years, going to a

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:26.999
kindergarden school, brought a paper to Me and said,

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:30.083
"what is written grand Ma?" I said, "It is written that if you pay

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:33.999
hundred Rupees and come for a course in this hotel

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:38.125
then you can get your transformation." She was first puzzled.

01:00:38.792 --> 01:00:40.875
She said, "How can you get transformation without

01:00:41.166 --> 01:00:43.792
Kundalini being awakened?" Little one, you see.

01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:46.875
But the another one then, [laughs],

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.291
"but this courses business I cannot understand.

01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:52.000
My father has done fourteen courses

01:00:52.375 --> 01:00:54.999
of all sorts but his Kundalini doesn't rise."

01:00:55.375 --> 01:00:59.542
You see, they are simple, and they know the facts, they said by courses you cannot.

01:00:59.834 --> 01:01:02.458
There's no course, we cannot have a course, we don't have course

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:06.959
in Sahaja Yoga actually. We don't have. It's, you should feel it,

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:11.000
you should see it, you should work on other people, understand it, you see, it is the

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:18.375
'Bodha', is the awareness, that you develop about others.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.709
For example, supposing, how to make out a Dodge car?

01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:27.834
You can't give a course on making out the cars, you see that.

01:01:28.625 --> 01:01:31.208
And then you know, this is a Dodge, this is Mercedes, this is this,

01:01:31.709 --> 01:01:34.999
this is that. But you give somebody a course, he won't know.

01:01:37.166 --> 01:01:39.999
It's simple as that, simple as that, you see.

01:01:40.999 --> 01:01:44.125
But then this, about God, you can't have course.

01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:47.041
I can't tell you one day, you become this too.

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:50.625
This cannot be. May be, may not be, you see it's a living force. May be

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:54.041
his kundalini did not rise, yours has risen.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.417
Hers, his is not risen or somebody's not risen, so we have to raise it.

01:01:58.959 --> 01:02:01.417
How can I give a general course like that?

01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:07.375
Now the fruits are, you can't say that every flower

01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:09.834
will have a fruit on such and such time, such and

01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:12.834
such. Can you give a course to these flowers?

01:02:17.375 --> 01:02:20.625
It's so simple you know, but we never, we take everything living

01:02:20.999 --> 01:02:24.041
for granted because we don't know that we can play a part in that.

01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:28.375
So we shut away. But after realization you can.

01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:32.667
This is a living process. You cannot bound it,

01:02:32.709 --> 01:02:36.458
you cannot condition it, you cannot teach it. Nothing at all.

01:02:40.917 --> 01:02:43.999
Y: Sorry. SM: Yes? Y: "But each person has a different journey, right?

01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:48.166
For some people might be easier for them to be self-realized than other people."

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:51.667
SM: It is, it's true, doesn't matter.

01:02:51.999 --> 01:02:54.709
But I am here to solve the difficulties.

01:02:56.083 --> 01:02:58.291
All right? It's all right, doesn't matter.

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:00.291
Y: But there are not different pathways.

01:03:00.709 --> 01:03:05.000
SM: Pathways is the same but some are going slow, some are going fast,

01:03:05.667 --> 01:03:08.959
some are going up and down, you see some go this way that way,

01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:13.375
all sorts we have,  all samples. You will see that, one by one.

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:18.917
It's a big humor that you find sometimes how people move, you see.

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:22.999
So itself will solve, doesn't matter. But the path is the same.

01:03:23.417 --> 01:03:26.000
Path is the same, the ascent is the same.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.458
But some are caught up by the lower chakras, some are caught up by

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:32.875
the higher chakras, and some have got too much of mental activity,

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:35.542
they suck in the whole thing again. It's all right, makes

01:03:35.999 --> 01:03:39.500
no difference, makes no difference. You see once you understand

01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:43.667
that you have the power to raise your Kundalini and correct yourself

01:03:43.999 --> 01:03:45.999
and if you understand how to do it, it's very simple.

01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:48.999
You can work it out yourself. You see, if you are a mechanic

01:03:49.375 --> 01:03:53.333
of your car and you know the road, then there is no problem.

01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:58.125
Some are second hand cars, you see, like a

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:01.583
French girl she used to come very often to Me from France so

01:04:01.999 --> 01:04:04.667
My husband once asked her, "Why, She has given you realization now,

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:08.375
why do you bother Her every time?" So he is a shipping man, so

01:04:08.542 --> 01:04:11.166
she said, "Sir, sometimes you have second hand ships,

01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:13.750
sometimes you have got fifth hand ships."

01:04:13.999 --> 01:04:17.041
So he said, "Then the practical thing is to srap them.

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:20.417
That's what we do in shipping." But I said, "Not in Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:20.834 --> 01:04:23.375
we don't scrap, that's the only difference."

01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:26.125
He said, "The practical thing in shipping is to scrap them."

01:04:26.709 --> 01:04:29.000
But not in Sahaja Yoga, we don't scrap.

01:04:35.999 --> 01:04:37.875
There are so many ways of working it out.

01:04:37.999 --> 01:04:40.000
So, should we have again? Let's see.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.166
Are you feeling very hot there in the sun? You can come here.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.999
It'll be not proper to sit in the sun too much also.

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:49.500
Too much of sun is also not good, too much of anything is not good.

01:04:50.542 --> 01:04:53.083
Y: In fact, could people in the shade just squeeze together

01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:56.959
so others can be there? You come and sit here.

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:01.917
SM: Hmm must be, quite hot.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.166
Y: It's better to sit on the earth, if you can, because...

01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:20.959
SM: No no but it depends on, this won't matter, this pillow.

01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:24.999
No no it's all right, pillow is all right, if it is not made of nylon.

01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:33.917
Now, you just put your hands like this.

01:05:33.999 --> 01:05:36.792
I'll have some water please, if at all...

01:05:38.999 --> 01:05:41.999
Just like this, your hands.

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:52.917
Thank you Manmesh, thank you. He's got it here. Thank you.

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:22.959
All right. So you please have to close your eyes,

01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:25.625
put both the hands towards Me.

01:06:30.542 --> 01:06:33.083
What about the gentleman there?

01:06:36.667 --> 01:06:40.750
What's the problem? He's not well?

01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:44.542
All right, let him put his hands towards Me.

01:06:59.834 --> 01:07:02.875
Now watch your hands, you see if they are shaking.

01:07:04.834 --> 01:07:09.750
Watch your hands. Left side. All right?

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:18.875
Or if there is heat, on one hand.

01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:24.083
Put them straight, straight like that. Hmmm?

01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:37.667
Now if the left is shaking, can you put your right hand

01:07:38.291 --> 01:07:41.250
on your heart, heart, if the left is shaking.

01:07:41.917 --> 01:07:44.709
I think yours is. Put on the heart.

01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:48.208
Take out some, there is some paper in your pocket?

01:07:48.999 --> 01:07:51.250
Yes please. Take it out. Yes please, Ya

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.999
Right hand here on the heart.

01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:11.792
And if the right is shaking then you put your left hand

01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:15.125
on the stomach and right hand towards Me.

01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:19.166
If the right is shaking.

01:08:23.291 --> 01:08:26.625
Yours is left. Put your right hand on the heart.

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:34.333
You are all right. Are you feeling cool breeze? Not yet? You are all right.

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:50.999
Not yet? Don't you worry.

01:08:51.667 --> 01:08:53.917
Keep your eyes shut, all right, all of you keep your eyes shut.

01:08:54.333 --> 01:08:56.999
Is very important that you keep your eyes shut.

01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:16.999
Hmm!

01:09:23.208 --> 01:09:26.875
Put your right hand on the heart, those who have been to the gurus.

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:34.208
Please. Right hand on the heart. Hmm, first of all.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:39.667
To any guru you have been, you put your right hand to the heart first of all.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:46.999
Because your spirit is your guru and he resides in your heart.

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:52.583
Now bring down the hand on your stomach,

01:09:53.417 --> 01:09:56.250
On the left hand side, all those who have been to gurus specially.

01:09:58.375 --> 01:10:01.458
And say that Mother I am my own guru.

01:10:05.041 --> 01:10:07.458
Just say that, you are your own guru.

01:10:08.208 --> 01:10:11.999
Y: Mother I am my own guru. SM: mother I am my own guru.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:17.125
Y: Mother I am my own guru. Mother I am my own guru.

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:21.709
Mother I am my own guru. SM: Ten times. Y: Ten times. Mother

01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:29.000
I am my own guru. Mother I am my own guru, Mother I am my own guru.

01:10:29.417 --> 01:10:34.375
Mother I am my own guru. Mother I am my own guru.

01:10:34.999 --> 01:10:37.999
Mother I am my own guru.

01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:47.999
Hmm! Better.

01:11:07.667 --> 01:11:10.917
SM: Don't lock up your legs, just leave them loose.

01:11:11.291 --> 01:11:15.083
Don't lock them. Let them loose. Yes, don't lock them.
See, this gentleman, going to Krishnamurti.

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:34.000
I think I should use Sindoor of Mine. Very bad Agnya. Y: Sindoor?

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:38.999
Mother's, no, bring Mother's own.

01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:41.625
SM: No it's all right, this will do Y: Will it do? SM: Hmm.

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:51.208
SM: Let Me try with this, if it works out, hmm. Everybody's Agnya is.

01:11:53.583 --> 01:11:57.291
So I am using something, just to turn your Agnya Chakra, you see.

01:11:57.792 --> 01:12:00.792
So that you don't feel.  I have to use this red because red

01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:05.875
frightens all the evil, just to frighten the ego.

01:12:26.999 --> 01:12:31.999
Y: Left Swadishthan, left Agnya, and right Agnya.
It's still at Agnya. It's still at Agnya, Left Agnya. It's risen to Agnya...

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:26.041
SM: How do you feel? Any cool breeze in your hands?

01:14:55.375 --> 01:14:56.999
SM: All right?
