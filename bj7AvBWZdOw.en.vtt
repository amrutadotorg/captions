00:00.000 --> 00:08.065
First Public Program in Turkey (Istanbul)
Emirgan Korusu, 25.06.1989

03:29.845 --> 03:35.106
I bow to all the seekers of truth

03:39.763 --> 03:42.120
Can somebody translate me?

03:43.923 --> 03:48.102
Gregoire: I can see, they are already in meditation

04:18.677 --> 04:24.467
I said, I bow to all the seekers of truth.

04:37.332 --> 04:41.832
Now, we have to realised

04:41.911 --> 04:45.689
that truth can not be conceptualized.

04:51.355 --> 04:56.426
Truth is and will feel all the time.

05:01.547 --> 05:04.499
We can not organize it.

05:08.253 --> 05:11.427
And those who are seeking truth,

05:11.455 --> 05:15.176
after know that they should keep their minds open.

05:15.594 --> 05:17.577
Like a scientist.

05:24.238 --> 05:26.611
And whatever we are telling you,

05:26.636 --> 05:29.763
has to be taken as a hypothesis.

05:33.780 --> 05:41.951
And if it proofs, right, than you have to
accept it as honest people.

05:50.094 --> 05:55.185
Since long there has been talked about truth.

05:59.872 --> 06:04.625
Socrates  talked about it
and he was killed.

06:09.874 --> 06:15.654
Then came Christ he talked about it
he was killed.

06:19.677 --> 06:26.711
Then came prophet Mohammed Sahap
and he was also in a way killed.

06:33.768 --> 06:37.347
But today the human awareness is much better.

06:43.694 --> 06:48.336
And we are understanding that truth has to be

06:48.361 --> 06:52.146
beyond our mental projections.

07:04.681 --> 07:08.467
When we see those people who talk of peace

07:08.492 --> 07:12.681
and talk of any theories of democracy

07:12.706 --> 07:15.623
or capitalism or communism

07:23.412 --> 07:30.002
or they talk of any religion like Islam,
Hinduism, Christianity.

07:36.126 --> 07:38.792
Everyone is the just the same.

07:41.175 --> 07:46.306
There is no binding force,
anybody can commit any sin.

07:51.709 --> 07:54.256
So where are we got wrong.

07:57.939 --> 08:03.478
All these prophets and saints
and incarnations were

08:03.503 --> 08:09.423
absolutely truthful
but where have we gone wrong.

08:17.627 --> 08:20.833
There is one thing common among all of them

08:20.857 --> 08:26.134
that they said, you must see the eternal.

08:34.167 --> 08:38.336
And considering things are
to be used in their moderation

08:38.352 --> 08:41.092
and in their limitations.

08:49.001 --> 08:52.310
This is the essence of all the religions.

08:57.795 --> 09:02.366
But we have gone wrong
because we did not see later.

09:08.772 --> 09:12.399
And got lost into transitory things.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.377
There was nothing wrong with those

09:19.401 --> 09:25.056
who started on these great religions
and great philosophy.

09:34.331 --> 09:36.553
But we missed the point.

09:40.418 --> 09:43.701
But today the human awareness has reached

09:43.706 --> 09:47.360
the state where it can see so clearly.

09:54.475 --> 10:01.330
That the fulfillment of the promises
given to us has to be done.

10:06.927 --> 10:13.310
It is said that there is the ruh,
the all-pervading power round us.

10:21.038 --> 10:24.141
All the living things
that you see like flowers,

10:24.166 --> 10:29.789
fruits and trees and
human beings are miracles.

10:37.024 --> 10:40.563
These are worked out.
These are worked out through

10:40.588 --> 10:44.204
this all-pervading subtle power.

10:52.709 --> 10:59.126
But so far we have never felt it
enmass, this power.

11:04.705 --> 11:09.445
Few saints have faith it
but nobody would believe that.

11:15.116 --> 11:18.581
But now a special blossom time has come.

11:22.541 --> 11:25.050
And in this blossom time

11:25.066 --> 11:29.311
we are going to find out the truth
without any difficulties.

11:35.121 --> 11:38.647
It has should be the easiest thing

11:38.663 --> 11:41.411
because it is a living process.

11:47.354 --> 11:53.361
But you saw the seed in the mother earth
it sprouts spontaneously.

12:03.323 --> 12:08.237
In the same way within us,  this power

12:08.262 --> 12:13.235
which I have told you, is described
as al-Asas, (The Foundation) in Koran.

12:21.576 --> 12:25.996
In the Bible as the holy ghost.

12:32.625 --> 12:36.497
And in the inner scriptures as Adi Shakti,

12:37.901 --> 12:40.901
Primordial Mother as Athina.

12:51.086 --> 12:58.639
Resides in triangular bone called as sacrum,
meaning sacred bone.

13:05.751 --> 13:09.666
This is the power of God’s desire

13:09.691 --> 13:15.639
which resides within us
as our pure desire.

13:25.368 --> 13:33.474
And it spontaneously rises and break
through our fontanel bone area.

13:45.428 --> 13:53.798
So actually, you get the actualization
of your baptism, actualization.

14:02.120 --> 14:07.119
It is not just artificial certificate.

14:13.789 --> 14:18.527
Once you become connected with
the all-pervading power

14:18.567 --> 14:20.622
and you become a saint

14:28.752 --> 14:31.343
or you become wali (a Muslim saint)

14:33.601 --> 14:36.299
or you become a self realized soul.

14:40.044 --> 14:42.455
As a result of that,

14:42.480 --> 14:46.961
transformation starts taking place
in every human being.

14:53.103 --> 14:56.369
And this transformation is very unique.

14:59.551 --> 15:05.085
Such a person automatically becomes purified.

15:10.738 --> 15:15.208
You don’t have to tell such a person, don’t do, don’t do.

15:15.233 --> 15:18.130
He just does not do wrong things.

15:24.149 --> 15:29.540
He becomes very dynamic
but very compassionate.

15:34.695 --> 15:41.710
And lives in complete joy and peace.

15:48.586 --> 15:53.239
All this is your right, as human beings to have it.

15:57.947 --> 16:03.240
This is the glory, that is within us.

16:10.828 --> 16:16.085
Only, our instrument has to be connected to the main.

16:24.143 --> 16:29.465
Also, physical, mental, emotional disorders

16:29.490 --> 16:33.301
get completely corrected by this power.

16:42.403 --> 16:49.262
And you start feeling this
formless energy all round yourself.

16:57.405 --> 17:03.384
So, you get your enlightenment
your attention becomes enlightened.

17:11.873 --> 17:17.278
Now we have here people from,
I don’t know how many countries

17:17.331 --> 17:22.981
who have come to Istanbul to meet you all.

17:32.698 --> 17:37.996
It is surprising how it was difficult for

17:38.021 --> 17:43.783
anyone of this western country people,
specially English, French

17:43.808 --> 17:47.559
who even pronounce one Indian Hindi word

17:47.584 --> 17:52.104
or any other language in Indian language.

18:03.775 --> 18:06.726
But now, these we are pronounce sanskrit.

18:08.946 --> 18:12.048
And later all they will be singing Arabic.

18:14.552 --> 18:17.964
Because now they have become universal being.

18:21.472 --> 18:25.862
And this is what we have to touch
this our universal being which is the spirit.

18:33.229 --> 18:38.557
Now we have people, we have Jews
who worshiped Muhammad Sahap,

18:38.560 --> 18:41.298
who worshiped Christ.

18:54.332 --> 19:01.119
Because through their experience of truth,
they have realized that they were incarnations.

19:06.663 --> 19:10.131
All these great incarnations and prophets

19:10.156 --> 19:14.887
came on the same tree of life, at different times

19:22.784 --> 19:26.815
to give us balance and to save us from evil.

19:32.731 --> 19:37.905
But we have plucked the flowers and
we are saying this is mine this is mine

19:37.918 --> 19:41.291
and fighting with these dead flowers.

19:49.390 --> 19:53.694
So it is important for all people who are honest

19:53.718 --> 19:57.184
and who are seeking the truth,

19:57.192 --> 20:00.485
should achieve their self-realization and see

20:00.589 --> 20:05.692
the absolute truth about them.

20:14.747 --> 20:19.314
They never talked ill about each other

20:23.381 --> 20:26.864
but only we, in our ignorance do that.

20:31.685 --> 20:35.836
So, this light has to come within us.

20:39.175 --> 20:42.193
Supposing we are holding a snake in our hand

20:42.211 --> 20:47.173
and there is darkness and your eyes are not open.

20:47.208 --> 20:51.693
You will not believe, if somebody says
there is a snake in your hand.

21:04.276 --> 21:08.942
But if you get the light and your eyes are open up,

21:08.953 --> 21:13.939
you will immediately yourself believe that snake.

21:22.207 --> 21:26.034
So, a person become so powerful and so free

21:26.082 --> 21:33.205
that no bad habits can dominate him.

21:47.242 --> 21:53.799
You yourself, become your own master
and manage yourself.

21:59.103 --> 22:03.023
I do not have to tell you, don’t do this and don’t do that.

22:06.715 --> 22:09.712
I am sorry for today’s delay but

22:09.737 --> 22:15.969
you know, there were problems
of traffic and all kinds of things.

22:23.796 --> 22:26.502
It was very unexpected.

22:30.379 --> 22:34.283
So, I hope, you will excuse me for coming late.

22:39.781 --> 22:43.408
Tomorrow of course, I will be here much earlier

22:43.419 --> 22:48.093
and explain to you much more about Sahaja Yoga.

22:54.035 --> 22:59.167
Sahaja; Saha means with, ja means born.

23:07.422 --> 23:12.175
Yoga means union with the Divine with the Ruh (spirit).

23:18.092 --> 23:22.083
So, all the human beings

23:22.106 --> 23:24.683
whatever race they will belong to

23:24.708 --> 23:28.138
have a right to achieve this stage.

23:36.445 --> 23:38.111
May God bless you all.

23:40.648 --> 23:43.471
If you want to ask me some questions,

23:43.496 --> 23:46.928
I will be very happy to answer them.

24:05.409 --> 24:06.807
Audience: I would like to ask a question.

24:06.831 --> 24:11.785
She just expressed that throughout history,
important personalities

24:11.810 --> 24:15.618
have been murdered because of
what they had said.

24:35.312 --> 24:37.000
Audience: Why did they get murdered?

24:37.025 --> 24:38.191
Audience:She gave an example.

24:38.216 --> 24:41.400
She said that Socrates was murdered
becasue of his words.

24:41.425 --> 24:44.575
She said that Hazrat Isa Aleyhissellam
had been murdered;

24:44.600 --> 24:47.311
although I do not agree with this,

24:47.336 --> 24:50.399
I wonder for which of his words was

24:50.399 --> 24:54.637
Hazrat Mohammad Aleyhisselam was murdered.

25:16.441 --> 25:20.116
Shri Mataji: No. He was supposed to be killed in the sense that

25:20.141 --> 25:24.152
you see, whatever he try to preach and

25:24.177 --> 25:28.863
try to do, people would not listen to him

25:28.888 --> 25:34.308
and he had to really struggle a lot all his life.

25:51.002 --> 25:54.018
Audience: So there is no real act of murder,

26:01.654 --> 26:05.944
Shri Mataji: No. Not that way.
That part is not important.

26:05.961 --> 26:11.710
What important part is that
what he wanted to established?

26:12.181 --> 26:15.738
In his lifetime, it was very difficult.

26:15.803 --> 26:19.566
Because the people were so ignorant.

26:37.230 --> 26:39.261
Audience: Thank you.

26:42.878 --> 26:46.650
Audience:  Does the human brain work more
in Yoga or in sleep,

26:46.692 --> 26:49.502
is there any difference between these two [unclear]

27:03.288 --> 27:04.791
Shri Mataji: What happens?

27:10.406 --> 27:15.417
Somebody: The energy wakes up during
the sleep or during a yoga section?

27:16.023 --> 27:18.691
Shri Mataji: No during, not during the sleep

27:18.708 --> 27:21.130
but during the yoga section.

27:25.724 --> 27:29.375
It is what should understand
why these great prophets came.

27:29.387 --> 27:31.918
Because they had to help us.

27:32.008 --> 27:35.271
In the same way,
the one who is enlighten,

27:35.296 --> 27:37.773
can only enlighten another person.

27:38.094 --> 27:43.192
Like one light, which is enlighten,
can enlighten.

27:57.957 --> 28:01.584
But that person has to be enlightened,

28:01.634 --> 28:04.660
is the authority that is from God.

28:04.964 --> 28:07.688
That he should be enlightened blinds.

28:07.713 --> 28:10.975
Blind people cannot give light.

28:21.750 --> 28:30.138
Audience: Had Buddha found his true
self and become a mystic?

28:30.604 --> 28:32.322
Does she agree with that?

28:32.366 --> 28:40.753
Audience:  Yes, had he found his true self
and achieved the true state of mysticism?

28:50.790 --> 28:52.750
Shri Mataji: Yes, he did. One,

28:52.821 --> 28:56.085
exceptional case, he proofed the Ruh.

29:02.532 --> 29:07.089
Actually, it was the grace of God
which worked on him

29:07.114 --> 29:12.273
and he was so, so desperate.

29:13.617 --> 29:19.762
And he had reached the state where
he would have committed suicide if he hadn’t.

29:28.790 --> 29:32.436
And when you are enlighten,
you can enlighten others.

29:32.476 --> 29:35.660
You all have all the powers to you enlighten others.

29:35.662 --> 29:39.044
Like I really don’t do it much.

29:39.053 --> 29:44.636
All of them here who are sitting are,
all I would say, can do it.

30:02.959 --> 30:08.763
If that is your capacity that is
your power today. Why not have it.

30:16.556 --> 30:18.600
For, you cannot pay for it.

30:18.625 --> 30:23.277
You cannot do anything about it.
Effortlessly you get it. Why not have it.

30:34.313 --> 30:39.218
It is so simple as that.
Today we went in the Bazaar.

30:39.542 --> 30:46.082
And there was a Armenian boy
who was selling us something.

30:46.318 --> 30:49.190
Then he said who are you?

30:49.516 --> 30:53.455
I said, I have come here to give self-realization.

30:54.224 --> 30:57.541
He said can you give me now?
I said yes.

30:57.726 --> 31:01.892
He just puts his hands towards me
and said,  “ooh I am feeling the cool breeze.”

31:43.787 --> 31:45.584
So he wanted to thank me.

31:45.609 --> 31:48.125
I said, this is your own what I have done.

31:48.135 --> 31:50.222
Why did thanking me?

31:59.775 --> 32:02.243
This all built-in in you it has got.

32:02.259 --> 32:05.435
Alright, tomorrow you will do
this to the others.

32:16.951 --> 32:20.389
Audience: Is Yoga only good for
bringing peace in this world?

32:20.414 --> 32:23.804
What are her thoughts about the hereafter?

32:55.795 --> 32:59.389
Shri Mataji: See, I have decided
not to talk about myself.

32:59.432 --> 33:05.246
The reason is, see now,
because all of them talked

33:05.264 --> 33:09.106
and said often, like Christ,

33:09.115 --> 33:12.299
he said, “I am the son of God”

33:12.764 --> 33:18.346
and everything he talked is of truth,
so what did they do to them.

33:34.868 --> 33:37.464
But I must be something no doubt.

33:37.489 --> 33:39.448
I must be knowing something.

33:39.457 --> 33:43.768
But is better, you know yourself,
then you know me better.

33:58.465 --> 34:01.020
Audience: Can anyone achieve this task?

34:12.256 --> 34:14.335
Shri Mataji: Yes of course.

34:15.002 --> 34:17.980
Anyone who has got enlightenment.

34:23.292 --> 34:25.665
Audience: Just a moment,
I would like to say a couple of things.

34:25.690 --> 34:29.717
From all your speech
and the questions of the participants,

34:29.741 --> 34:33.425
I gather that, this meeting gives the sense that,

34:33.475 --> 34:37.233
it excludes other religions,
I think that,

34:37.265 --> 34:40.189
this is how it’s being narrated right now.

34:40.205 --> 34:45.176
I kindly request Her to explain
if this is the case.

35:12.533 --> 35:15.312
Shri Mataji: Of course. It proves.

35:15.337 --> 35:18.790
It proves that  truth, of course.

35:26.516 --> 35:27.944
Of course. Of course.

35:32.132 --> 35:34.512
All religions are true.
No doubt about it

35:34.522 --> 35:37.775
but we have done mistakes.
That is the point I am saying.

35:48.164 --> 35:50.212
Audience: This is what I wanted to explain;

35:50.244 --> 35:52.078
that all religions are true,

35:52.094 --> 35:54.462
that all of them express the reality

35:54.472 --> 35:58.307
but that we make errors while trying
to understand the religions.

35:58.323 --> 36:02.915
So, with your explanation right now,
I should presume that you are trying to fix this;

36:02.940 --> 36:07.111
based on your explanation.
Is this own I should presume?

36:07.136 --> 36:16.050
So all of these other religions are in a chaos, [UNCLEAR]

36:16.075 --> 36:25.400
but because of this now
we […] they find explanations like yoga.

36:35.577 --> 36:38.600
Audience: Can she tell a bit about the tree of life?

36:48.247 --> 36:50.407
Shri Mataji: I mean tomorrow definitely.

36:50.432 --> 36:52.751
I will explain to each and everything.

36:52.767 --> 36:57.271
There is going to be no secret
about this knowledge of the roots.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.900
This is the knowledge of the roots.

36:59.925 --> 37:04.350
Only we have to become subtle, to feel it.

37:07.253 --> 37:09.880
Everything, everything.

37:14.261 --> 37:18.316
But this knowledge is love, is compassion.

37:27.553 --> 37:30.156
Audience:  What is the thing about Sahaja Yoga

37:30.181 --> 37:32.023
that distinguishes it from
the other methods.

37:32.048 --> 37:35.781
I would like her to give an explanation.
If you wish […]

37:45.475 --> 37:47.808
Shri Mataji: other yogas?

37:47.833 --> 37:51.664
Shri Mataji: See. That way, all other yogas

37:51.688 --> 37:56.457
are actually an integral part of Sahaja Yoga.

38:03.487 --> 38:09.092
If you do say Hatha Yoga,
in that also, it is first of all, the cleansing

38:09.100 --> 38:12.516
this that and all that and then
you reach a point

38:12.540 --> 38:15.637
where you have to take realization.

38:22.879 --> 38:27.834
Allright. Now, the second is
you can say, Raja Yoga and all that

38:27.857 --> 38:31.258
the way they preach is artificial.

38:46.937 --> 38:48.936
Like in Raja Yoga,

38:48.953 --> 38:55.808
they say that, you should take
your tongue backwards

38:55.833 --> 39:00.273
and you should put your stomach
tight and all those things.

39:00.298 --> 39:04.101
But when kundalini rises,
automatically it happens.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.181
You don’t have to do it.

39:24.874 --> 39:27.143
Like when your car starts,

39:27.168 --> 39:30.606
all the machinery starts moving automatically.

39:30.631 --> 39:33.785
But supposing, you just take
the wheel and start moving,

39:33.810 --> 39:35.611
the car won’t move.

39:52.227 --> 39:59.955
So, one has to understand that
yoga means; union with the divine.

40:05.623 --> 40:09.408
Now, the difference is that in modern times ,

40:09.433 --> 40:11.851
nobody has time to go to Himalaya

40:11.876 --> 40:15.398
and sit there for hours together, cleansing themselves.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.881
So, I have found a method.

40:27.913 --> 40:31.185
By which first of all raise your kundalini.

40:42.495 --> 40:44.583
And most of you, I am surprised,

40:44.608 --> 40:47.521
you get your realization for fix that moment.

40:58.187 --> 41:01.401
But supposing, somebody do not get it fixed.

41:01.417 --> 41:04.570
Then they can see in that little light,
what is wrong with them

41:04.581 --> 41:08.685
and they improve themselves.
I don’t have to tell them.

41:20.193 --> 41:22.613
So you become your own master.

41:27.758 --> 41:30.712
Audience:  In the transcendental meditation technique,

41:30.737 --> 41:32.967
when people access a certain consciousness,

41:32.992 --> 41:36.279
they rise a couple of centimeters from the ground.

41:46.864 --> 41:49.168
Shri Mataji: No. It is all, it is not true.

41:49.184 --> 41:50.715
It is falsehood.

41:52.201 --> 41:57.222
You see, first, you must know that
anybody who takes money from you

41:57.247 --> 42:01.075
in the name of religion,
in the name of yoga, in anything,

42:01.100 --> 42:04.442
is a false guru.

42:16.355 --> 42:18.840
I don’t mind, even they being cheats,

42:18.865 --> 42:22.827
but not only they cheat you,
not only they cheat you,

42:22.852 --> 42:25.037
but they spoil your kundalini

42:25.062 --> 42:28.334
and they spoil your chances of realization.

42:28.359 --> 42:32.972
We had about only 4 or 5 people only yesterday,

42:32.985 --> 42:35.596
who came to us from this TM.

42:35.606 --> 42:39.185
Who poor things have become recluses.

42:52.664 --> 42:53.917
Also logically,

42:55.215 --> 42:57.344
logically we should understand

42:57.360 --> 43:00.352
what is there to get up from the body

43:00.376 --> 43:03.466
and to move about. What is the sense?

43:12.106 --> 43:13.408
What is the advantage?

43:13.424 --> 43:16.463
We have to two legs to walk.
What is the need?

43:16.942 --> 43:18.179
It is stupid.

43:23.721 --> 43:27.446
All this kind of funny things,

43:27.471 --> 43:30.765
if they tell you,
why should you believe them?

43:37.456 --> 43:40.553
No scripture has talked about it.

43:44.324 --> 43:46.657
There should be some bases.

43:51.966 --> 43:55.577
Audience:  I am sorry,
here is our friend’s question:

43:55.602 --> 43:58.773
there is this one yoga in India,
Marashi Marashi,

43:58.797 --> 44:00.798
their students are doing this thing

44:00.823 --> 44:04.205
but this esteemed lady is saying
that it’s fake.

44:17.465 --> 44:19.766
Shri Mataji: (UNCLEAR) I have nothing to do with him.

44:22.082 --> 44:24.345
Go and see his bank balance. That is all.

44:34.016 --> 44:35.523
Please be careful.

44:35.566 --> 44:39.424
Please be careful. I am sorry.
They are Indians, I know.

44:39.471 --> 44:42.862
I know, they are Indians.
I am very sorry for that.

44:42.967 --> 44:45.874
That is why, I am here to tell you the truth.

44:58.289 --> 45:01.035
I have to I would like to warn also.

45:06.987 --> 45:11.990
I have talked about them in 1970,
very openly.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.755
Very openly.

45:22.116 --> 45:26.108
But still people, I don’t know how
they take to him. Because

45:26.149 --> 45:30.597
he says that he can make people pay,

45:30.622 --> 45:33.472
so people are happy,
I think to pay.

45:43.392 --> 45:46.288
Thousands of seekers are ruined.

45:59.012 --> 46:00.925
Audience: In short, does she mean fake?

46:00.950 --> 46:03.885
Shri Mataji:  Now one more question and no more. Allright?

46:05.366 --> 46:08.106
Because it is getting late now.

46:08.869 --> 46:12.237
Audience: I am one of the people who use this technique,

46:12.262 --> 46:16.477
they took the money but I am very
satisfied with this technique.

46:16.480 --> 46:19.728
Until now I had a very stressful life.

46:19.740 --> 46:22.095
It had an extremely positive impact.

46:43.286 --> 46:44.818
Audience:  There was a mistranslation.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.676
Audience:  I use TM

46:46.723 --> 46:50.588
Interpreter: Aa, I am sorry.
I made a mistake. I am sorry.

46:54.265 --> 46:56.233
Shri Mataji: I am surprise.

46:56.249 --> 47:00.296
Interpreter:  The lady meant transcendental meditation.

47:00.313 --> 47:01.400
Shri Mataji: Of course, I know.

47:01.474 --> 47:04.871
Interpreter:   But she claims that she is quite happy.

47:04.901 --> 47:09.191
I mean, she has been able to redeem
all the stress she had.

47:09.235 --> 47:10.736
Shri Mataji: Alright. Then it is alright.

47:10.761 --> 47:14.248
If she thinks so, but I can tell you this much,
that please don’t come back to me

47:14.273 --> 47:16.637
when you will have problem.

47:22.394 --> 47:25.427
Moreover, you see.
What power she has?

47:25.444 --> 47:27.294
What has she learned?

47:27.302 --> 47:29.685
Can she give realization to anyone?

47:29.710 --> 47:30.575
It is the point.

47:30.582 --> 47:33.448
What is the great transformations she has got ?

47:47.405 --> 47:50.854
You see, the mantras,
this gentleman is giving,

47:50.879 --> 47:53.148
because you don’t know sanskrit.

47:53.431 --> 47:55.954
(UNCLEAR) one is tinga,

47:55.979 --> 47:58.687
pinga, inga. These are not sanskrit.

47:58.713 --> 48:00.665
He doesn’t know sanskrit, this man.

48:08.925 --> 48:12.663
Tinga means, tinga means when
you show somebody like this.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.633
What do you say it in your language?

48:14.658 --> 48:15.658
Thump

48:15.713 --> 48:17.127
That is tinga.

48:17.135 --> 48:18.581
That is the mantra, he gives

48:18.621 --> 48:23.131
and 300 pound he charges
for giving such a stupid mantras.

48:30.715 --> 48:36.693
And another one he gives is inga,
meaning sting of the scorpion.

48:43.053 --> 48:47.961
And pinga means when you get possessed,

48:47.986 --> 48:51.035
you go round and round like that.
You see that is pinga.

48:59.929 --> 49:03.603
I am sorry. I,
I am not with that, at all.

49:07.795 --> 49:09.199
Audience: I hadn’t asked my question.

49:10.955 --> 49:12.860
I just shared my own experience.

49:12.885 --> 49:14.966
What I am trying to ask is this:

49:14.991 --> 49:17.246
the technique that they teach in the society

49:17.271 --> 49:19.908
is the special meditation technique of a caste

49:19.933 --> 49:23.237
that’s founded on veda science
that has been applied since 2000 BC.

49:23.262 --> 49:28.750
When you apply this technique in return
for money, is this a right or wrong thing?

50:01.534 --> 50:04.359
Shri Mataji:I can give you a complete story about,

50:04.367 --> 50:06.138
if you come and see me.

50:06.163 --> 50:09.965
That they started  of course in which people were

50:09.990 --> 50:13.527
stool to be jumping.I have got a

50:13.552 --> 50:17.990
whole coming sorf of a letter from that gentleman

50:18.005 --> 50:19.911
whom I have cured also.

50:20.023 --> 50:24.167
And they started course in Scotland.

50:24.192 --> 50:28.139
His name was Mr Pitapirs and his wife.

50:28.167 --> 50:30.359
She was the granddaughter of a duke.

50:30.375 --> 50:34.766
And they became bankrupt
and epileptic, 3 of them.

50:34.791 --> 50:38.579
And I have to keep them in
my own house, to treat them.

50:38.614 --> 50:40.409
And I have got a letter from them.

50:40.434 --> 50:42.982
So I mean this is what I am saying that,

50:43.005 --> 50:45.952
they go to any guru, let them go.
But then don’t come back to me.

50:45.977 --> 50:47.565
Because I headache for them.

51:25.567 --> 51:28.981
I will send you his letter.
You can see it.

51:30.264 --> 51:34.161
Now poor man, he became bankrupt
and he has gone to South Africa.

51:45.812 --> 51:48.322
And he is told me that he used to tell that,

51:48.338 --> 51:52.148
he could pass through the wall he could jump up

51:52.173 --> 51:55.350
in the air, then all lies.

51:55.374 --> 51:58.202
Because he puts so much money in it.

52:11.149 --> 52:13.133
Audience: Also in the society, I am saying this in parentheses,
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

52:13.158 --> 52:14.790
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

52:14.815 --> 52:17.621
Shri Mataji: Alright now we don’t want to anymore of this TM.

52:19.773 --> 52:23.791
Now let it be now.
Let us have the realization part.

52:24.276 --> 52:25.117
Better.

52:25.181 --> 52:26.577
Audience: Excuse me can I have your attention?

52:26.609 --> 52:30.947
How are we going to learn this
system of yoga and how we can apply this?

52:30.971 --> 52:32.702
Interpreter:  We will show tomorrow.

52:32.727 --> 52:34.710
Interpreter: Tomorrow,

52:35.336 --> 52:36.114
Let us have this please.

52:36.139 --> 52:37.658
Interpreter: It got late now.

52:38.964 --> 52:41.824
Audience:We can’t do tomorrow, it will be too crowded.

52:42.983 --> 52:47.222
Interpreter:  He has worried that
tomorrow session will be too crowded

52:47.241 --> 52:50.431
and they may not be able to get  realisation.

52:50.453 --> 52:52.082
Shri Mataji: get realization.
So let us have the realization

52:52.106 --> 52:55.050
that what I am saying,
you are reel seekers.

53:07.056 --> 53:10.595
Very simple it is. Very simple.

53:10.786 --> 53:13.198
Alright. Now, just think that

53:13.225 --> 53:15.799
we have to use the power of the mother earth

53:15.824 --> 53:19.428
so we have to take out our shoes. That is all.

53:20.086 --> 53:21.492
Take out our shoes.

53:27.722 --> 53:30.709
As we take out for any ibadet in centers.

53:40.995 --> 53:43.227
And have we put our hands for namaz.

53:43.251 --> 53:46.483
Namaz, the thing, Mohammed sahib told you,

53:46.508 --> 53:49.295
it was all kundalini awakening. It was all.

54:01.303 --> 54:03.524
Just, everything.

54:03.989 --> 54:05.894
Now.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.623
Now before you close your eyes,

54:13.639 --> 54:16.466
I will tell you, how to help your centers

54:16.491 --> 54:19.484
which are on left hand side. We will work out.

54:25.996 --> 54:28.043
Very simple it is.

54:30.801 --> 54:33.763
First, you have put your left hand towards me

54:33.772 --> 54:37.401
which is symbolically.
This is the power of desire.

54:37.419 --> 54:40.046
So you want to have your realization.

54:46.559 --> 54:49.201
Now so, left hand towards me like this,

54:49.218 --> 54:52.632
simple and the right hand on your heart.

54:52.666 --> 54:55.975
Because in the heart resides your spirit.

54:58.794 --> 55:02.040
Left towards me, left, left, left hand towards me.

55:02.065 --> 55:05.718
Right, right hand on the heart.

55:07.426 --> 55:09.882
Right, right.
Alright,

55:10.112 --> 55:15.301
Now, then this is the center where the spirit resides.

55:20.604 --> 55:26.357
Now you have to put your hand in the upper part of
your abdomen on the left hand side.

55:33.689 --> 55:35.895
And then you have to put your right hand

55:35.920 --> 55:40.246
in the lower part of your abdomen
on the left hand side, again.

55:46.122 --> 55:53.499
Now the upper part of your abdomen
is the center of your mastery.

55:54.206 --> 55:56.296
Of your mastery.

56:14.056 --> 56:18.071
Now, in the lower part of your abdomen, on the left hand side,

56:18.122 --> 56:22.757
is the center of pure knowledge which

56:23.134 --> 56:26.708
manifests through your central nervous system.

56:38.615 --> 56:41.511
Now,  you put your hand again

56:41.546 --> 56:44.577
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side

56:44.593 --> 56:47.339
which is the center of our mastery.

56:55.922 --> 56:59.350
Now, you put your right hand, again on the heart

56:59.364 --> 57:01.400
which is the spirit.

57:07.568 --> 57:11.814
Now, the center between the neck

57:11.839 --> 57:15.153
and your shoulder, in the corner,

57:15.178 --> 57:19.274
you put your hand and turn your head to your right.

57:26.562 --> 57:31.092
Now, this is the center, we catch,
when we feel guilty.

57:35.957 --> 57:38.901
You should be very pleasantly place toward yourself,

57:38.926 --> 57:44.086
after all you are a human being and if you commit mistakes,

57:44.121 --> 57:47.249
after all you are not God.

58:01.840 --> 58:07.643
Now, you put your hand on your forehead
across, and press it hard.

58:12.153 --> 58:16.327
This is the center of forgiveness.

58:21.743 --> 58:26.084
Now you put your right hand on the backside of your head

58:26.109 --> 58:28.459
and push behind your head.

58:34.567 --> 58:40.918
This is the center of asking for
forgiveness without feeling guilty.

58:48.731 --> 58:50.596
Now stretch your hand

58:51.929 --> 58:56.671
and put the center of your hand on top of your head,

58:57.285 --> 59:01.931
bend your head,
push back your fingers

59:02.285 --> 59:07.398
and move your scalp slowly, seven times.

59:07.440 --> 59:14.634
Because there are seven seats of
the seven centers in your brain.

59:21.838 --> 59:23.790
Stretch back your fingers.

59:33.749 --> 59:37.740
Now just we have to do it by closing our eyes.

59:37.765 --> 59:41.281
You can take out your spectacles.
You have to sit properly.

59:50.873 --> 59:54.126
Keep the legs apart from each other.

59:54.192 --> 59:58.964
Not to sit in a way that you are slouching

59:58.989 --> 01:00:03.688
or too much strain but in a natural, normal, straight.

01:00:14.254 --> 01:00:18.174
Now please close your eyes and don’t open them, till I tell you.

01:00:24.146 --> 01:00:27.058
Now, please put the left hand towards me.

01:00:31.121 --> 01:00:34.142
And right hand, on the heart.

01:00:37.417 --> 01:00:38.846
Please close your eyes.

01:00:41.285 --> 01:00:46.186
Here, you have to say

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:50.747
and ask a question to me 3 times.

01:00:50.854 --> 01:00:53.108
It is a very important question.

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:56.523
Mother, am I the spirit?

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:08.292
3 times.

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:28.615
If you are the spirit,
you are your guide,

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.877
you are your master.

01:01:31.099 --> 01:01:33.199
So please put this right hand

01:01:33.215 --> 01:01:36.162
in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:01:36.187 --> 01:01:39.306
and press it hard the left hand side

01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:41.539
and ask me a question.

01:01:52.755 --> 01:01:55.509
Here you ask me a question again 3 times.

01:01:56.533 --> 01:02:00.894
Mother, am I my own master?

01:02:00.896 --> 01:02:04.039
Call me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever suites you.

01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:25.317
Now, take down your hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen

01:02:26.267 --> 01:02:29.036
and press it hard.

01:02:32.527 --> 01:02:38.817
Here, I have to respect your freedom.

01:02:41.951 --> 01:02:45.125
And I can not force pure knowledge on you.

01:02:48.767 --> 01:02:52.322
So, you have to ask me, in your own freedom.

01:02:54.948 --> 01:02:57.353
Please say 6 times.

01:02:57.417 --> 01:03:02.579
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.697
Now,

01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:19.318
when you ask this question,

01:03:19.343 --> 01:03:23.734
this force of Kundalini starts rising.

01:03:47.034 --> 01:03:49.446
Now, raise your hand

01:03:50.759 --> 01:03:56.467
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side and press it hard.

01:04:02.146 --> 01:04:04.082
As the kundalini is raising,

01:04:04.107 --> 01:04:09.205
we have to help with our confident,
our centers to open out.

01:04:17.755 --> 01:04:21.105
Here you have to say 10 times

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:25.729
Because there are 10 petals to this center.

01:04:34.728 --> 01:04:37.537
With full confidence say,

01:04:38.363 --> 01:04:43.827
Mother, I am my own master.
Say it 10 times.

01:04:51.603 --> 01:04:55.127
This center is created by own prophets.

01:05:05.364 --> 01:05:10.252
Now, one has to know

01:05:10.277 --> 01:05:12.844
that, we are not this body.

01:05:12.862 --> 01:05:16.576
We are not this mind.

01:05:16.811 --> 01:05:19.453
We are not ego.

01:05:28.094 --> 01:05:30.538
We are not our conditionings

01:05:30.562 --> 01:05:34.096
but we are pure spirit.

01:05:41.401 --> 01:05:44.956
So, now, raise your hand onto your heart.

01:05:50.325 --> 01:05:53.650
And say with full confidence,

01:05:56.227 --> 01:05:59.409
the most important truth about yourself,

01:06:03.983 --> 01:06:09.805
Mother, I am the spirit.
Say this 12 times.

01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:36.074
Now, raise your right hand,

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:48.108
into the corner of your neck
and your shoulder.

01:06:53.103 --> 01:06:56.126
One has to know

01:06:56.795 --> 01:07:00.916
that Divine is the power

01:07:01.913 --> 01:07:07.216
of bliss and joy.

01:07:13.722 --> 01:07:14.722
But above all,

01:07:18.632 --> 01:07:23.909
above, above all it is the power of forgiveness.

01:07:30.715 --> 01:07:33.659
So whatever so called mistakes,
you have committed

01:07:33.684 --> 01:07:38.058
then be dissolved completely into that power.

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:50.356
So please turn your face to the right.

01:07:52.392 --> 01:07:55.626
Symbolically saying that,

01:07:55.651 --> 01:07:59.761
Mother, I am not guilty.
Say it 16 times.

01:08:22.884 --> 01:08:27.337
Now, raise your right hand

01:08:27.362 --> 01:08:30.583
onto your forehead across and press it hard.

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:40.393
You may bend your head.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.073
Here is the center to forgive.

01:08:50.271 --> 01:08:52.651
You forgive everyone.

01:08:56.389 --> 01:09:02.319
So please say with full confidence,

01:09:02.743 --> 01:09:06.481
Mother, I forgive everyone.

01:09:15.528 --> 01:09:19.289
Many people say that is difficult to forgive.

01:09:19.361 --> 01:09:24.492
But whether you forgive
or you don’t forgive, it is a myth.

01:09:33.117 --> 01:09:37.057
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:09:42.517 --> 01:09:46.746
So please say from your heart,

01:09:46.771 --> 01:09:49.504
Mother I forgive everyone.

01:09:56.937 --> 01:10:02.001
Now, take your right hand

01:10:02.026 --> 01:10:04.106
on the backside of your head

01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:07.852
and allow your head to rest on it.

01:10:15.832 --> 01:10:18.427
Here without feeling guilty,

01:10:18.452 --> 01:10:23.977
without counting your mistakes for your own satisfaction.

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:35.644
Please say,

01:10:37.049 --> 01:10:42.513
O Divine, If I have done
anything wrong, please forgive me.

01:10:52.586 --> 01:10:53.942
From your heart.

01:10:57.551 --> 01:11:02.618
Now stretch your palm and

01:11:04.829 --> 01:11:09.129
put the center of your palm on top of your head.

01:11:11.296 --> 01:11:15.089
On soft bone which was in your childhood.

01:11:20.447 --> 01:11:22.422
Push back your fingers.

01:11:24.779 --> 01:11:30.429
Now again, I can not force on you,
self realization.

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:41.133
So now bend your head and say 7 times

01:11:41.141 --> 01:11:48.591
moving your hand with pressure
your scalp, clockwise.

01:11:59.029 --> 01:12:02.441
Mother please give me self realization.

01:12:08.452 --> 01:12:10.277
Please move 7 times.

01:12:53.899 --> 01:12:57.003
Now take down your hands.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:04.581
Put both the hands towards me
and open our eyes slowly.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:17.620
Now just see, if you are thoughtless,
you can't see any thought.

01:13:21.789 --> 01:13:27.076
Now, bend your head and put your right hand towards me.

01:13:32.539 --> 01:13:38.009
And left hand you try to feel
cool breeze out of your head.

01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:58.023
Now, put the and again put the head down

01:13:58.048 --> 01:14:01.064
and put the left hand towards me.

01:14:03.676 --> 01:14:07.176
And with the right hand see again,
if there is a cool breeze coming,

01:14:07.192 --> 01:14:09.247
could be hot also.

01:14:20.011 --> 01:14:24.732
Now, put the right hand again towards me

01:14:24.757 --> 01:14:28.825
and see with the left hand if there is
a cool breeze coming out of you.

01:14:37.179 --> 01:14:40.818
Now put your hands up in the sky,

01:14:40.843 --> 01:14:46.510
like that towards the sky, push back
your head and ask a question.

01:14:47.999 --> 01:14:53.675
Is this the all pervading power of God?

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.415
Is this the Ruh?

01:15:07.315 --> 01:15:10.925
Is this the power of love

01:15:17.278 --> 01:15:19.547
Now take down your hands

01:15:23.434 --> 01:15:25.450
You all will feel very relaxed.

01:15:29.337 --> 01:15:32.471
Now those who are felt the cool breeze of their head

01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:35.450
and in your hands,

01:15:40.752 --> 01:15:43.998
like this, so you can feel in the hand of others also,

01:15:45.178 --> 01:15:46.245
neighbor’s head.

01:15:49.824 --> 01:15:52.197
Here also, here.

01:15:53.314 --> 01:15:55.813
All of you felt it I know.

01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:58.959
So raise your hand, let’s see, both the hands.

01:16:02.896 --> 01:16:05.752
Those who are felt  is this, raise your hands.

01:16:13.644 --> 01:16:15.302
May God Bless you all.

01:16:15.336 --> 01:16:17.725
So many of you are felt it.

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:24.701
Tomorrow again you are coming here

01:16:24.734 --> 01:16:27.043
And we are going to establish it fully.

01:16:31.005 --> 01:16:33.830
You will feel very joyus, very happy.

01:16:39.656 --> 01:16:41.942
Tomorrow (UNCLEAR).

01:16:50.366 --> 01:16:53.310
I hope, you will bring your friends.

01:16:57.112 --> 01:17:00.190
You feel very relax, very happy.

01:17:04.176 --> 01:17:06.485
Especially,  I have seen muslims,

01:17:06.493 --> 01:17:10.218
they receiving very fast.

01:17:17.896 --> 01:17:20.117
Got it, I know you got it.

01:17:22.328 --> 01:17:24.830
Alright. So, please come tomorrow

01:17:24.838 --> 01:17:28.512
and don’t discuss it.
Because this is beyond your thought.

01:17:30.438 --> 01:17:32.676
Audience: What time is the meeting tomorrow?

01:17:37.775 --> 01:17:39.148
Interpreter Half past six.

01:17:40.684 --> 01:17:43.362
Shri Mataji:  I will be very early there.

01:17:43.387 --> 01:17:45.624
Tomorrow I hope there is no traffic jam.

01:17:47.771 --> 01:17:50.691
Somebody: Gentleman wants to ask a question, if you don’t mind

01:17:50.716 --> 01:17:54.332
Shri Mataji: Please come. Please come. You can come here.

01:17:54.351 --> 01:17:57.154
Audience: I am asking this so that
everybody can hear.

01:17:58.738 --> 01:18:00.229
Shri Mataji: Allright, allright.

01:18:00.779 --> 01:18:10.940
Audience:  First of all, we are happy
to see her here in Istanbul.

01:18:10.965 --> 01:18:13.108
I would like to welcome her.

01:18:19.687 --> 01:18:23.944
I need to express that in the previous questions,

01:18:23.952 --> 01:18:27.614
some concepts were indeed being misunderstood

01:18:27.639 --> 01:18:31.445
and this is because there are a lot of misinformation

01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:35.028
and wrong knowledge around these in Turkey.

01:18:50.496 --> 01:18:52.765
Shri Mataji: It is allright but one has to answer.

01:18:52.782 --> 01:18:54.479
In fact this is the first time we are attending a meeting like this

01:18:54.504 --> 01:18:57.190
As Sufis were informed about this but…

01:19:01.713 --> 01:19:04.300
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is alright. See I am a mother.

01:19:04.316 --> 01:19:06.574
So it is alright. Children must ask questions..

01:19:06.606 --> 01:19:10.891
Audience: When we talk about yoga here in Turkey,

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.986
maybe she knows about it, there is a famous Yogi Kazim.

01:19:14.002 --> 01:19:17.172
He pokes his body with skewers in circuses and stuff.

01:19:17.188 --> 01:19:18.800
When we say yoga in Turkey,

01:19:18.825 --> 01:19:21.970
everybody expects something like this
because there is such an image.

01:19:48.707 --> 01:19:50.254
Shri Mataji: No, austerities.

01:19:50.286 --> 01:19:53.774
Audience:  For this reason.
When you talk about the yoga technique,

01:19:53.799 --> 01:19:58.149
there are established prejudices bring in
such associations of meaning.

01:19:58.174 --> 01:20:01.930
We listened her and understood that this is not the case

01:20:01.955 --> 01:20:05.118
but this has to be told to everyone in a very explicit way.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:06.205
This image must be erased.

01:20:21.043 --> 01:20:25.265
Audience:   So just like the merchants in
every religion and every system,

01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:28.017
because they are the merchants if yoga,

01:20:28.042 --> 01:20:33.686
I would kindly ask her to be at ease that
she is not being understood in this way.

01:20:33.694 --> 01:20:35.466
Thank you.

01:21:00.704 --> 01:21:05.314
Shri Mataji: You see, there are no
austerities in Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:05.342 --> 01:21:07.612
No asceticism in Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:14.082 --> 01:21:16.788
No materyalistic life in Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:24.969
God has created this world, for you, to enjoy.

01:21:24.993 --> 01:21:26.788
But in the right way.

01:21:34.437 --> 01:21:36.667
He is your father.

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:39.865
And the greatest of fathers.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.312
And why he did you guide you to be miserable.

01:21:50.414 --> 01:21:55.652
Actually, he is anxious for you
to enter into his Kingdom,

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:57.749
enjoy his love and blessing.

01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:07.008
Thank you very much.

01:22:15.473 --> 01:22:19.544
Beautiful. Very beautiful people.

01:22:19.705 --> 01:22:25.272
You got alright. Now, laugh, enjoy.

01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:18.795
The problem is that, there was no
one here as Sahaja Yogi.

01:23:19.109 --> 01:23:22.108
Now luckily we have a lady

01:23:22.133 --> 01:23:24.309
whose husband got transport.

01:23:24.311 --> 01:23:27.838
See, I could have come much earlier here.

01:23:27.863 --> 01:23:29.634
As I have been another country.

01:23:29.650 --> 01:23:31.834
I have been working now for 18 years

01:23:31.859 --> 01:23:34.653
but there was no one in Turkey.

01:23:35.434 --> 01:23:40.722
So I had to wait for somebody to be here already.

01:23:52.638 --> 01:23:55.232
There is a lady who has got transfer here.

01:24:00.589 --> 01:24:03.501
Now we have here  the lots of people ...

01:24:10.981 --> 01:24:11.997
Thank you.

01:24:12.022 --> 01:24:13.401
Thank you so much.

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:15.546
Thank you my child.

01:24:15.571 --> 01:24:17.992
So happy today

01:24:19.378 --> 01:24:20.511
May God bless you

01:24:22.701 --> 01:24:24.121
May God bless you

01:24:25.267 --> 01:24:26.400
May God bless you

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.331
Look at his eyes. See now his eyes.
Look at his eyes. See.

01:24:48.399 --> 01:24:50.106
Tomorrow hope to see you.

01:24:50.115 --> 01:24:52.973
Tomorrow hope to see you madam. Alright

01:25:00.127 --> 01:25:02.770
Thank you. Are you alright.

01:25:09.699 --> 01:25:11.809
Hello, did you feel the cool breeze.

01:25:16.768 --> 01:25:18.839
Audience: Can you please ask what is the meaning?

01:25:18.864 --> 01:25:20.354
I got very curious.

01:25:20.379 --> 01:25:23.912
But there has to be a difference. Can you please ask?

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:27.542
But there has to be a difference.

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:30.749
Can you please ask?

01:25:40.212 --> 01:25:44.745
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much.

01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:48.115
Interpreter:  The gentleman would like
to know what exactly is different

01:25:48.123 --> 01:25:51.250
that he felt heat instead of cool breeze.

01:25:51.292 --> 01:25:52.979
Shri Mataji: Still you are feeling.

01:25:53.004 --> 01:25:56.400
Little heat in the body instead always
and now they said you can see here.

01:25:56.402 --> 01:25:58.777
If you can see here becoming softer, here.

01:25:58.802 --> 01:26:01.628
And through this all the heat is coming out.

01:26:01.652 --> 01:26:03.065
Let the heat get out.

01:26:03.076 --> 01:26:06.228
And heat will get out.
And you will feel cool better.

01:26:06.236 --> 01:26:10.939
Because in the body, in the system
they said heat will (UNCLEAR) go which is together.

01:26:10.949 --> 01:26:13.005
And (UNCLEAR) due to liver.

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:22.373
And also he has to forgive.

01:26:22.389 --> 01:26:25.195
He has to forgive.
I think he didn’t forgive fully.

01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:26.331
So please forgive.

01:26:30.139 --> 01:26:32.796
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

01:26:32.887 --> 01:26:38.721
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

01:26:42.022 --> 01:26:46.610
See now. You not forgive. He did not forgive.

01:26:46.885 --> 01:26:48.702
He did not forgive.

01:26:49.222 --> 01:26:51.031
Interpreter:  Nice to see you.

01:26:51.135 --> 01:26:53.817
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Look at your eyes, sparkling.

01:26:59.461 --> 01:27:02.000
Nice. Are you alright?

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.372
Hello now, you, young people
have to take it up. Alright.

01:27:10.736 --> 01:27:12.608

01:27:20.782 --> 01:27:25.365

01:27:42.193 --> 01:27:44.463
