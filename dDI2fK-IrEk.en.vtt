00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:27.951
Today is a great day of Navaratri,

00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:34.451
we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh.

00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:43.451
Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahasaraswati

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:48.451
finished Her work

00:20:48.451 --> 00:20:53.451
and the incarnation of the Shakti itself started.

00:20:53.451 --> 00:20:58.951
So, at twelve o’clock today the Devi takes the Shakti upon Herself.

00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:07.951
Of course, as you know that Mahakali and Mahasaraswati,

00:21:07.951 --> 00:21:19.951
both are the powers of Shri Sadashiva.

00:21:19.951 --> 00:21:27.951
Adi Shakti first formed Herself into Mahakali,

00:21:27.951 --> 00:21:32.951
which is the Power of Desire.

00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:37.951
But all these powers are nothing

00:21:37.951 --> 00:21:44.951
but the power of God’s love.

00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:55.951
So, in the series of this great love of God,

00:21:55.951 --> 00:22:01.951
Adi Shakti had to first become the Power of Desire.

00:22:01.951 --> 00:22:02.951
In the same way,

00:22:02.951 --> 00:22:07.951
Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this power of love

00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:12.951
have to have full desire in their heart.

00:22:12.951 --> 00:22:19.951
Desire to love.

00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:26.951
That desire is very different from

00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:31.951
the other kinds of human love we have known.

00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:35.951
In other kinds of human love,

00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:38.951
when we have relations with others,

00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:42.951
we have expectations,

00:22:43.951 --> 00:22:48.951
and that’s why it is very disappointing.

00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:52.951
Our expectations always run higher

00:22:52.951 --> 00:22:58.951
than our understanding and realities.

00:22:58.951 --> 00:23:03.951
And so we suffer from disappointments and frustrations.

00:23:03.951 --> 00:23:10.451
And the love that has to be nourishing and fulfilling

00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:14.451
becomes a thankless job.

00:23:14.451 --> 00:23:19.451
So, when it reflects in the human beings,

00:23:19.451 --> 00:23:24.451
it is the desire to be loved by everyone,

00:23:24.451 --> 00:23:28.451
not to love others.

00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:31.451
Everyone should love you,

00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:35.451
but how far you love another is the point.

00:23:35.451 --> 00:23:38.451
Naturally everyone for oneself!

00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:41.451
So really nobody loves.

00:23:41.451 --> 00:23:46.451
But when it comes to real love

00:23:46.451 --> 00:23:52.451
then sacrifice, becomes a nature.

00:23:52.451 --> 00:23:56.451
You don’t call it a sacrifice, but you call it a privilege.

00:23:56.451 --> 00:24:01.451
We say it’s a privilege to give love.

00:24:01.451 --> 00:24:06.451
It’s a great chance that we can love.

00:24:06.451 --> 00:24:11.451
It’s our great fortune that we can love.

00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:16.451
It’s God’s blessings that we can love and give.

00:24:16.451 --> 00:24:22.451
So, the giving starts when you realise,

00:24:22.451 --> 00:24:26.451
not understand but realise the love,

00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:30.451
the power of love expressing .

00:24:30.451 --> 00:24:34.451
That’s the third power, which starts expressing .

00:24:34.451 --> 00:24:36.451
Because, after this,

00:24:36.451 --> 00:24:40.451
a person becomes active, kriyasheet.

00:24:40.451 --> 00:24:44.451
That’s how the action of

00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:49.451
achieving that state of giving love starts.

00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:53.451
To begin with we start activating in so many ways.

00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:59.451
As I said, we start expecting

00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:06.451
and thinking that we are loving others.

00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:10.451
We act for that.

00:25:10.451 --> 00:25:14.451
In that madness that others should love us,

00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:16.451
others should respect us,

00:25:16.451 --> 00:25:18.451
others should think we are great,

00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:20.451
they should recognise us

00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:25.451
we start loving something else which is not so important.

00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:30.451
So, we go on first to money,

00:25:30.451 --> 00:25:33.451
money becomes a very important point.

00:25:33.451 --> 00:25:39.451
We think that, if we have money, people will love us.

00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:43.451
We become very powerful as moneyed people,

00:25:43.451 --> 00:25:46.451
as rich people.

00:25:46.451 --> 00:25:48.451
So, we start accumulating money,

00:25:48.451 --> 00:25:55.451
we start loving the money.

00:25:55.451 --> 00:25:58.451
But money is not the Truth;

00:25:58.451 --> 00:26:00.451
we don’t love the Truth.

00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:03.451
When we start loving the money

00:26:03.451 --> 00:26:06.451
we start thinking about problems of money.

00:26:06.451 --> 00:26:14.451
Such people can become miserly to such an extent

00:26:14.451 --> 00:26:17.451
that even towards God they become miserly.

00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:18.451
They never have money actually,

00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:21.451
because if you cannot spend your money, you have no money.

00:26:21.451 --> 00:26:26.451
If it is not available what’s the use of having all the money?

00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:29.451
That’s how they have problems

00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:36.451
because they love money and not the God Almighty.

00:26:36.451 --> 00:26:42.451
They’re worried about money but not about the Truth.

00:26:42.451 --> 00:26:47.451
Then with that they go to a second thing: is the power.

00:26:47.451 --> 00:26:50.451
They want to have the power;

00:26:50.451 --> 00:26:52.451
they want to become presidents,

00:26:52.601 --> 00:26:57.451
ministers and bureaucrats and all that.

00:26:57.451 --> 00:27:00.451
They want to have the power:

00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:03.451
they think by having great power

00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:05.451
people will respect them and love them.

00:27:05.451 --> 00:27:10.451
But they get drowned in fear.

00:27:10.451 --> 00:27:14.451
What they get is fear. All the time they have fear.

00:27:14.451 --> 00:27:17.451
Also moneyed people have fear.

00:27:17.451 --> 00:27:23.451
That’s why in the Bible it is said that: wages of sin is fear.

00:27:23.451 --> 00:27:28.451
What is sin? Sin is not to love the Truth.

00:27:28.451 --> 00:27:32.451
Is the sin. When you don’t love the Truth then it is sin.

00:27:32.451 --> 00:27:38.451
So, when you start getting worried about your positions…

00:27:38.451 --> 00:27:44.451
Like the president feels that he’ll lose his job,

00:27:44.451 --> 00:27:51.451
the vice president thinks that he’ll be sacked,

00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:56.451
the prime minister thinks he may not be elected,

00:27:56.451 --> 00:28:00.451
the bureaucrats think they will lose their jobs,

00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:02.451
they won’t get promotions or something,

00:28:02.451 --> 00:28:04.451
there will be problem.

00:28:04.451 --> 00:28:08.451
All these people are suffering from terrible sense of fear.

00:28:08.451 --> 00:28:11.451
They have no freedom of any kind.

00:28:11.451 --> 00:28:16.451
And in that category people just go down so much with fear,

00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:20.451
that even worse than people with money.

00:28:20.451 --> 00:28:23.451
Because once they are lost, they are lost.

00:28:23.451 --> 00:28:27.451
They can never revive. No chance.

00:28:27.451 --> 00:28:29.451
Once you lose the elections you are lost,

00:28:29.451 --> 00:28:30.451
nobody is going to look at you.

00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:34.451
I have known people who have been at a very high position

00:28:34.451 --> 00:28:39.451
and once they lose that position nobody looks at them,

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:40.451
they just walk like straight,

00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:44.451
otherwise there will be at least hundred cars to receive them.

00:28:44.451 --> 00:28:48.451
And once they lose their jobs there’s nobody even to look at them.

00:28:48.451 --> 00:28:51.451
They just walk like ordinary people.

00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:54.451
Even seeing all these things happening,

00:28:54.451 --> 00:29:00.451
this truth just coming before them so clearly,

00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:04.451
they do not keep to that truth,

00:29:04.451 --> 00:29:07.451
they do not realise that truth,

00:29:07.451 --> 00:29:13.451
they do not have that realisation within them.

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:18.451
They understand for a while, and they go after that.

00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:21.451
Then when the person dies,

00:29:21.451 --> 00:29:27.451
they see a moneyed man, a rich man is forgotten,

00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:31.451
nobody is bothered about them, who was a rich man.

00:29:31.451 --> 00:29:33.451
On the contrary, the people,

00:29:33.451 --> 00:29:37.451
the prime ministers and all those high-ranking people, when they die,

00:29:37.451 --> 00:29:41.451
immediately books start coming out about their private life:

00:29:41.451 --> 00:29:45.451
all the dirty things they did

00:29:45.451 --> 00:29:50.451
and all the horrible things they did and what sort of life they led

00:29:50.451 --> 00:29:52.451
There’s no fragrance in their life,

00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:56.451
no idealism. Nothing.

00:29:56.451 --> 00:29:59.451
Because the responsibility

00:29:59.451 --> 00:30:02.451
that they have to the public

00:30:02.451 --> 00:30:06.451
and to themselves they have not understood it

00:30:06.451 --> 00:30:09.451
and they made a mess of their private life.

00:30:09.451 --> 00:30:15.451
That’s why this kind of a reaction comes after it.

00:30:15.451 --> 00:30:18.451
The other day I was reading

00:30:18.451 --> 00:30:22.451
an interview with a very well-known actor.

00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:26.451
He’s a born realised fellow, I know, but he’s gone down completely.

00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:29.451
He says, “I think, what’s the harm in drinking,

00:30:29.451 --> 00:30:31.451
what’s the harm in gambling,?

00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:33.451
what’s the harm in smoking?

00:30:33.451 --> 00:30:37.451
Because, after all, I’m going to die

00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:42.451
and then who is going to bother?

00:30:42.451 --> 00:30:44.451
Supposing, I get cancer, so what?

00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:46.451
In any case I’m going to die.

00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:49.151
So why not enjoy these pleasures of life?”

00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:55.151
But what about death? You continue with it.

00:30:55.151 --> 00:30:59.151
Then all that you’ve been doing will come out,

00:30:59.151 --> 00:31:05.151
and people will not to like to have your photograph in the household.

00:31:05.151 --> 00:31:08.151
Children will spit at you. What about that?

00:31:08.151 --> 00:31:13.151
Your life is not what it is today for three, four years or ten years

00:31:13.151 --> 00:31:16.151
or fifteen years of your so-called success.

00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:18.151
But when you die

00:31:18.151 --> 00:31:22.151
all this craziness will disappear,

00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:26.151
and people will come out with truth about you.

00:31:26.151 --> 00:31:32.151
That is how this power to be popular finishes off.

00:31:32.151 --> 00:31:36.151
This cheap popularity,

00:31:36.151 --> 00:31:44.151
this cheap type of treatment towards yourself

00:31:44.151 --> 00:31:50.151
gives you a personality that will not be worshipped,

00:31:50.151 --> 00:31:53.151
that will not be accepted.

00:31:53.151 --> 00:31:56.151
Nobody will quote you as something great.

00:31:56.151 --> 00:31:58.151
For some time, it will continue,

00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:04.151
but in totality such a person has given nothing to humanity.

00:32:04.151 --> 00:32:11.151
That’s how the power of Saraswati works.

00:32:11.151 --> 00:32:13.151
People go into action

00:32:13.151 --> 00:32:22.151
for achieving the results of getting into power.

00:32:22.151 --> 00:32:28.151
But it should act to discover the truth.

00:32:28.151 --> 00:32:38.151
Saraswati should give you the leap to find out the truth.

00:32:38.151 --> 00:32:45.151
That, when you act in those funny places and streets,

00:32:45.151 --> 00:32:48.151
you discover this is not the path, we have missed it.

00:32:48.151 --> 00:32:53.151
The path is somewhere else. We’ve lost it.

00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:56.151
Let us find out the real path because this doesn’t give joy.

00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:58.151
This one can learn from others,

00:32:58.151 --> 00:33:03.151
from history, from so many other things and from your own parents,

00:33:03.151 --> 00:33:09.151
from your society and from yourself and from your children also.

00:33:09.151 --> 00:33:11.151
If you want to learn,

00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:15.151
that is the quality of Saraswati pujaris,

00:33:15.151 --> 00:33:20.151
that they take to gyana, they take to reality.

00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:23.151
Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas,

00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:25.151
it’s said that:

00:33:25.151 --> 00:33:29.151
if by reading these four Vedas,

00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:33.151
if you do not get the veeda,

00:33:33.151 --> 00:33:38.151
veeda is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realisation,

00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:47.151
there is no use reading these Vedas.

00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:55.151
So, the Saraswati’s first thing is that through the reading,

00:33:55.151 --> 00:34:00.151
through the process of Saraswati’s manifestation,

00:34:00.151 --> 00:34:05.151
you must reach a point to understand that this is a rat-race,

00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:06.151
and we have to get out of it.

00:34:06.151 --> 00:34:08.151
We have to step out.

00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:10.151
When that happens,

00:34:10.151 --> 00:34:13.151
then the Mahalakshmi Tattwa starts working in you,

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:18.151
that is the third tattwa, which starts working.

00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:25.151
Mahalakshmi Tattwa

00:34:25.151 --> 00:34:30.151
then starts expressing its love in its full extent

00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:35.151
through evolutionary process in human beings.

00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:39.151
He starts evolving simultaneously.

00:34:39.151 --> 00:34:43.151
He sees on both the sides what’s happening,

00:34:43.151 --> 00:34:51.151
like a witness and he uses his Mahalakshmi power.

00:34:51.151 --> 00:34:55.151
In the first part of the Mahalakshmi power

00:34:55.151 --> 00:35:03.151
he starts getting out of the common rut of the family bondages

00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:11.151
and the other human bondages of power,

00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:14.151
money, lust

00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:19.151
and he starts moving on a higher plane.

00:35:19.151 --> 00:35:27.151
He gives us a new idea of popularity

00:35:27.151 --> 00:35:32.151
by establishing the Truth.

00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:35.151
Because through Mahalakshmi power

00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:41.151
you discover the Truth on your central nervous system

00:35:41.151 --> 00:35:52.151
and ultimately it is the light of an enlightened brain.

00:35:55.151 --> 00:36:00.151
When the Mahalakshmi power starts manifesting,

00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:05.151
one starts thinking of others.

00:36:05.151 --> 00:36:08.151
Not on material level,

00:36:08.151 --> 00:36:10.151
that materially people are suffering,

00:36:10.151 --> 00:36:13.151
“Now there are people in Ethiopia, who will save?

00:36:13.151 --> 00:36:15.151
We must give them some food, this, that.

00:36:15.151 --> 00:36:21.151
” No! They go to the roots of the problems. Why?

00:36:21.151 --> 00:36:23.151
Or they don’t think there should be

00:36:23.151 --> 00:36:26.151
equal distribution of money and wealth.

00:36:26.151 --> 00:36:29.151
No. This is superficial.

00:36:29.151 --> 00:36:36.151
Because wherever it is done people are not happy.

00:36:37.151 --> 00:36:41.151
They feel they have no freedom.

00:36:43.151 --> 00:36:46.151
Those people who have money are not happy

00:36:46.151 --> 00:36:51.151
because they have a demonic life.

00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:55.151
Where they are free they behave like devils.

00:36:55.151 --> 00:36:57.151
No sense of totality,

00:36:57.151 --> 00:37:00.151
no sense of collectivity.

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:04.151
When they become like that,

00:37:08.151 --> 00:37:14.151
they even do not realise that they have become demonic.

00:37:14.151 --> 00:37:20.151
Everything becomes like a big martyrdom.

00:37:21.151 --> 00:37:23.151
They fight for lands,

00:37:23.151 --> 00:37:25.151
they fight for nations,

00:37:25.151 --> 00:37:29.151
they fight for rights.

00:37:29.151 --> 00:37:32.151
And they do all kinds of horrible things.

00:37:32.151 --> 00:37:39.151
Start destroying people, human beings.

00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:44.151
All the turmoil of today is the effect of

00:37:45.151 --> 00:37:47.151
mostly in the West,

00:37:47.151 --> 00:37:51.151
and also all the Arabic countries,

00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:55.151
I would say – is of the right side.

00:37:56.151 --> 00:38:02.151
And in the East, it is of the left side - the turmoils.

00:38:02.151 --> 00:38:07.151
It’s very surprising that

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:09.151
it’s very contrasting also.

00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:11.151
It’s a funny dilemma for Me,

00:38:11.151 --> 00:38:14.151
I can’t understand it sometimes

00:38:14.151 --> 00:38:18.151
that where they are so particular about the chastity,

00:38:23.151 --> 00:38:30.151
they become when they are so much worried about chastity and everything,

00:38:30.151 --> 00:38:33.151
that they should have problem of the left side.

00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:36.151
They do puja, they have shraddha,

00:38:36.151 --> 00:38:38.151
they are like Catholics, we can say,

00:38:38.151 --> 00:38:39.151
are never rich people,

00:38:39.151 --> 00:38:44.151
seldom, except in Switzerland,

00:38:44.151 --> 00:38:46.151
I think, here everybody’s rich

00:38:47.151 --> 00:38:50.151
because they are so money-oriented.

00:38:53.151 --> 00:38:58.151
So, or the people where they are right sided,

00:39:00.151 --> 00:39:03.151
when they neglect their chastity,

00:39:05.151 --> 00:39:08.151
not bothered about the right side,

00:39:09.151 --> 00:39:13.151
they have the problems of the right side,

00:39:15.151 --> 00:39:17.151
is very surprising.

00:39:18.151 --> 00:39:23.151
The reason is where they look after the chastity part

00:39:24.151 --> 00:39:27.151
they go too much into it.

00:39:30.151 --> 00:39:35.151
Now, supposing a person is doing a puja.

00:39:37.151 --> 00:39:41.151
He just goes on doing puja, puja, puja morning till evening,

00:39:41.151 --> 00:39:43.151
without any activity.

00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:45.151
Very easy to do puja, isn’t it?

00:39:45.151 --> 00:39:47.151
Just come down,

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:49.151
somebody does puja for you, get the vibrations,

00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:51.151
nicely blessed, go home.

00:39:51.151 --> 00:39:52.151
Nothing to be done,

00:39:53.151 --> 00:39:55.151
no activity.

00:39:56.151 --> 00:39:59.151
So, there is no balance.

00:39:59.151 --> 00:40:04.151
So, they do puja and they think, “Oh, they have done very well.”

00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:07.151
No, if you are a right sided person,

00:40:08.151 --> 00:40:10.151
then puja will help you,

00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:12.151
but not if you are a left sided person.

00:40:17.151 --> 00:40:19.151
Puja does help,

00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:21.151
of course, My Puja will help, no doubt,

00:40:21.151 --> 00:40:22.151
in both the sides,

00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:26.151
because I’m neither left nor right nor anywhere.

00:40:38.151 --> 00:40:42.151
So the puja part when they do …

00:40:42.151 --> 00:40:48.151
supposing a man is doing a puja to a Devi.

00:40:48.151 --> 00:40:54.151
In India they take a great courage to do puja to a Devi,

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.151
you do not know that.

00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:57.151
Saptashati. That’s where we have

00:40:57.151 --> 00:40:59.151
that thing that the way people do,

00:40:59.151 --> 00:41:01.151
they get possessed,

00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:02.151
they can’t understand.

00:41:02.151 --> 00:41:05.151
First of all, they have a statue of someone

00:41:05.151 --> 00:41:07.151
made by some horrible fellow.

00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:10.151
When they will do the puja of that Goddess,

00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:12.151
they are God-fearing,

00:41:12.151 --> 00:41:14.151
everything is good,

00:41:14.151 --> 00:41:18.151
we have got temples where there are also,

00:41:18.151 --> 00:41:21.151
we can say, swayambhus

00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:25.151
from the Mother Earth,

00:41:25.151 --> 00:41:27.151
which are worshipped

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.151
and should be all right,

00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:31.151
but no! They get possessed. Why?

00:41:32.151 --> 00:41:34.151
Because most of them,

00:41:34.151 --> 00:41:40.151
these temples are hounded by or haunted by spirits.

00:41:40.151 --> 00:41:43.151
Because they do all kinds of tantaric things there.

00:41:43.151 --> 00:41:46.151
And when people go and do the pujas there

00:41:46.151 --> 00:41:49.151
what happens to them?

00:41:49.151 --> 00:41:52.151
That they get attacked,

00:41:54.151 --> 00:41:56.151
they become more left sided.

00:41:58.151 --> 00:42:02.151
Now the Muslims and others who believe in a God

00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:03.151
which is neerakara,

00:42:03.151 --> 00:42:05.151
which is formless,

00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:10.151
they go to the right side.

00:42:10.151 --> 00:42:12.151
There’s formless God,

00:42:12.151 --> 00:42:14.151
it’s nice, formless everywhere is God,

00:42:14.151 --> 00:42:17.151
in Me, in you, everyone there is God,

00:42:17.151 --> 00:42:19.151
everybody’s God.

00:42:19.151 --> 00:42:22.151
Even if you are a devil, you are God.

00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:25.151
There’s nothing wrong with anyone,

00:42:25.151 --> 00:42:27.151
everybody’s God!

00:42:27.151 --> 00:42:29.151
Starts on that principle.

00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:35.151
So, they go onto supra-conscious side

00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:38.151
and they become demonic.

00:42:41.151 --> 00:42:43.151
Then they must fight,

00:42:43.151 --> 00:42:44.151
because they are devils. Devils have to fight;

00:42:44.151 --> 00:42:47.151
otherwise, how will they exist?

00:42:49.151 --> 00:42:52.151
They fight, they aggress,

00:42:52.151 --> 00:42:54.151
they go to other countries,

00:42:55.151 --> 00:42:57.151
aggress them, capture them,

00:42:57.151 --> 00:43:00.151
all the time they are thinking of aggressing others.

00:43:00.151 --> 00:43:02.151
In a subtler way they aggress,

00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:05.151
nowadays the media is aggressive in the West.

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:09.151
There are so many ways of aggression

00:43:09.151 --> 00:43:15.151
and to them aggression is something is very dharmic.

00:43:15.151 --> 00:43:17.151
For anything.

00:43:17.151 --> 00:43:20.151
They’ll ask direct questions,

00:43:20.151 --> 00:43:26.151
arrogant, insulting and cruel,

00:43:28.151 --> 00:43:29.151
they become cruel.

00:43:33.151 --> 00:43:35.151
That’s how the turmoil starts

00:43:35.151 --> 00:43:38.151
when we start using the power of Saraswati

00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:41.151
in a wrong way or the power of Mahakali.

00:43:47.151 --> 00:43:51.151
That’s why in Sahaja Yoga before the Puja

00:43:51.151 --> 00:43:53.151
we have to go into lot of activity.

00:43:53.151 --> 00:43:55.151
You have to decorate the hall,

00:43:55.151 --> 00:43:58.151
you have to get the flowers,

00:43:58.151 --> 00:44:01.151
you have to organize everything beautifully.

00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:05.151
Look at the roses, how beautiful they are.

00:44:05.151 --> 00:44:08.151
Then you starts balancing yourself

00:44:08.151 --> 00:44:11.151
with all these activities you do.

00:44:16.151 --> 00:44:19.151
And then you sit down for puja.

00:44:19.151 --> 00:44:22.151
That’s like in the daytime you work,

00:44:22.151 --> 00:44:23.151
in the night you sleep.

00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:28.151
To rest, to get the place: you must be active.

00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:33.151
Like they have to climb Himalayas

00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:36.151
to achieve meditation,

00:44:37.151 --> 00:44:39.151
because when you are tired,

00:44:39.151 --> 00:44:43.151
you can be restful afterwards.

00:44:43.151 --> 00:44:45.151
Otherwise, if you get somebody,

00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:47.151
say, from Switzerland only,

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:53.151
the very speedy person for meditation,

00:44:53.151 --> 00:44:56.151
you’ll have to put the glue on him

00:44:57.151 --> 00:45:00.151
to settle down because he’ll be frantic, you know,

00:45:00.151 --> 00:45:04.151
all the time. Will be all the time jumping!

00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:16.151
So, the activity has to come before the puja

00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:20.151
and the balance has to be established.

00:45:20.151 --> 00:45:23.151
So, the ladies have to find out the saris

00:45:23.151 --> 00:45:25.151
and the blouses and this and that

00:45:25.151 --> 00:45:27.151
and they have to worry about putting the flowers,

00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:30.151
arranging things, this, that. Lot of activities!

00:45:32.151 --> 00:45:34.151
We have to travel.

00:45:34.151 --> 00:45:37.151
For English it was necessary to travel all the way from England,

00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:40.151
to arrange their money and rooms and everything to come here,

00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:47.151
to go to futuristic side, to think what they are going to pay,

00:45:47.151 --> 00:45:50.151
how they are going to pay back their loans!

00:45:54.151 --> 00:46:00.151
All this futuristic: planning they have to do before they come to Switzerland.

00:46:02.151 --> 00:46:09.151
Switzerland being the most active place, it’s better to have the puja here, so they are not so much active!

00:46:11.151 --> 00:46:14.151
That’s how the Devi arranges everything.

00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:21.151
So the ascent starts evolving.

00:46:23.151 --> 00:46:30.151
In that, the play of the Devi is the Navaratri – in your ascent – from ages.

00:46:30.151 --> 00:46:35.151
Navaratri: that’s why is the most important Puja.

00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:41.151
In Sahaja Yoga, Navaratri is the most important puja.

00:46:41.151 --> 00:46:48.151
Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahastrar Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realisation.

00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:53.151
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution

00:46:54.151 --> 00:47:02.151
you’ll find [that] Navaratri is the one which has brought you to Sahastrara.

00:47:02.151 --> 00:47:07.151
Without the help of the Devi at different stages of your ascent,

00:47:07.151 --> 00:47:13.151
you could not have been in a position to receive your Realisation.

00:47:13.151 --> 00:47:19.151
So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshipped

00:47:20.151 --> 00:47:28.151
and are used for thanking the Devi for what She did to bring you down here.

00:47:28.151 --> 00:47:29.151
So, it’s like a thanksgiving.

00:47:30.151 --> 00:47:35.151
Without Her work nothing could have happened.

00:47:35.151 --> 00:47:39.151
So, when we read about the Devi, about Her incarnations:

00:47:39.151 --> 00:47:43.151
how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas,

00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:52.151
people who were trying to ascend, to cross this bhavasagara,

00:47:53.151 --> 00:47:56.151
how She worked hard,

00:47:56.151 --> 00:47:59.151
how she fought the devils,

00:47:59.151 --> 00:48:05.151
how She fought, She killed the demons single-handed,

00:48:06.151 --> 00:48:12.151
She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the bhavasagara.

00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:18.151
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma, but She is the one who brought you out.

00:48:18.151 --> 00:48:22.151
Even those who were dharmic could not do it because of the demonic pressure.

00:48:23.151 --> 00:48:29.151
She’s the One who fought single-handed with Her powers of destruction.

00:48:30.151 --> 00:48:33.151
In Her love for you She fought.

00:48:33.151 --> 00:48:35.151
She brought you to this level.

00:48:35.151 --> 00:48:40.151
And then She took a milder form of incarnation.

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:44.151
Even during the time of all the gurus,

00:48:44.151 --> 00:48:54.151
She took the form of, as you know, Janaki was the daughter of Janaka,

00:48:54.151 --> 00:49:01.151
then Fatima was the daughter of Mohammed Sahib

00:49:01.151 --> 00:49:04.151
and Nanaki was the sister of Nanaka.

00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:17.151
In those forms, these Powers sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.

00:49:17.151 --> 00:49:24.151
And later on, or sometimes simultaneously,

00:49:26.151 --> 00:49:36.151
They incarnated in milder forms to help human beings to rise.

00:49:36.151 --> 00:49:39.151
So, today is the day of thanksgiving.

00:49:40.151 --> 00:49:44.151
As Guru Puja is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru,

00:49:44.151 --> 00:49:46.151
the One who has counselled you,

00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:50.151
the One who has told you about the Truth,

00:49:50.151 --> 00:49:57.151
the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realisation.

00:49:58.151 --> 00:50:03.151
And the Devi puja is a thanksgiving where, single-handed,

00:50:05.151 --> 00:50:09.151
just like a very loving mother, under Her sari,

00:50:09.151 --> 00:50:18.151
She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around,

00:50:19.151 --> 00:50:24.151
every sort of problems that existed

00:50:24.151 --> 00:50:31.151
and ultimately brought you into Sahastrara level and then gave you Realisation.

00:50:31.151 --> 00:50:35.151
It’s a real thanksgiving to the Mother.

00:50:37.151 --> 00:50:43.151
So, we can say Navaratri is like a Mother’s Day where you give thanksgiving to Her:

00:50:43.151 --> 00:50:50.151
which was just relentless, continuous working for Her children.

00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:59.151
Motherhood is much more important than the guruhood.

00:50:59.151 --> 00:51:05.151
Because guru is the one who trains you, makes you efficient.

00:51:05.151 --> 00:51:08.151
But the Mother forgives you,

00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:13.151
She loves you, She sustains you and She teaches you how to love.

00:51:13.151 --> 00:51:19.151
She has tremendous patience and tremendous, love and She does it single-handed.

00:51:19.151 --> 00:51:23.151
She doesn’t expect anything from you – absolutely selfless.

00:51:24.151 --> 00:51:31.151
'Selfless’ is a very small word I should say, it’s such an expansive compassion

00:51:31.151 --> 00:51:41.151
which engulfs everything that is wrong, dissolves it, digest it, absorbs it.

00:51:43.151 --> 00:51:48.151
So, it’s a very great day Navaratri is, for all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:51:48.151 --> 00:52:01.151
because then She took Her form as Sita, as the Power of Shri Rama, silent potential,

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:07.151
suffering. How much She suffered! How much She suffered!

00:52:09.151 --> 00:52:12.151
Then She took the form of Radha.

00:52:13.151 --> 00:52:21.151
Then She came as five powers of Saraswati as the five wives of Shri Krishna.

00:52:23.151 --> 00:52:30.151
Then She came as Mary: that was the greatest suffering, I think, to see the Son being crucified.

00:52:30.151 --> 00:52:36.151
The suffering, silent, patient suffering, She had to go through it.

00:52:37.151 --> 00:52:40.151
All that drama, to be seen, was too much.

00:52:40.151 --> 00:52:46.151
She went through all that because you all had to cross your Agya Chakra.

00:52:46.151 --> 00:52:48.151
She had to sacrifice Her Child.

00:52:48.151 --> 00:52:52.151
It’s easy for a father to do that, very difficult for a mother.

00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:59.151
Now you are all mothers, so many of you, you will know what it is to have a child

00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:02.151
and how one feels about it.

00:53:05.151 --> 00:53:07.151
After doing that,

00:53:07.151 --> 00:53:13.151
She comes to the state where you have to give your Realisation.

00:53:13.151 --> 00:53:16.451
Is a work of tremendous patience, as you know.

00:53:16.451 --> 00:53:20.151
It’s tremendous patience and understanding.

00:53:20.151 --> 00:53:28.151
Human beings, as the time advanced, have evolved no doubt for Realisation,

00:53:28.151 --> 00:53:34.151
but also evolved to very funny, stupid, crooked nonsensical ways.

00:53:34.151 --> 00:53:40.151
It’s impossible to understand how they go about with their stupid ideas

00:53:40.151 --> 00:53:42.151
and how troublesome they can be!

00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:47.151
They can be very crooked, funny, troublesome

00:53:47.151 --> 00:53:53.151
to such an extent that sometimes even it is difficult to forgive.

00:53:55.151 --> 00:54:01.151
Despite that so many of you are here today, in Europe,

00:54:01.151 --> 00:54:07.151
in the land of the Guru, here I find, who have got Realisation.

00:54:07.151 --> 00:54:14.151
So, the Mother’s pride, Mother’s joy knows no bounds,no doubt about it.

00:54:14.151 --> 00:54:17.151
It’s such a great thing to see Her children

00:54:17.151 --> 00:54:23.151
sitting here to receive all the powers from Her.

00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:28.151
Now, again, when we are in this situation,

00:54:28.151 --> 00:54:34.151
we have to know the first principle with which the whole thing started:

00:54:34.151 --> 00:54:38.151
that it is the power of love.

00:54:41.151 --> 00:54:47.151
It is the power of love that has brought you to this state

00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:53.151
and it’s the power of love that you will express and manifest; you will evolve.

00:54:55.151 --> 00:55:02.151
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga also the temptations become subtler and subtler.

00:55:02.151 --> 00:55:10.151
We try to do Sahaj Yog, we try to spread Sahaja Yoga, sometimes for the powers .

00:55:10.151 --> 00:55:13.151
Maybe you are lonely, so you want to have more Sahaja Yogis.

00:55:13.151 --> 00:55:19.151
Maybe you do it because you think that that’s how you spread your powers.

00:55:19.151 --> 00:55:24.151
Even there are problems on leadership I find, ego problems there are.

00:55:24.151 --> 00:55:28.151
Somebody’s appointed a leader then another feels bad, this, that all goes on.

00:55:28.151 --> 00:55:33.151
I see the drama going on. Like small children they fight. What is this leadership?

00:55:33.151 --> 00:55:37.151
Is just artificial! It’s not even noted in any newspaper!

00:55:43.151 --> 00:55:48.151
As they have mock governments, we have a mock leadership.

00:55:50.151 --> 00:55:54.151
So, then people fight for that – this becomes subtler and subtler.

00:55:54.151 --> 00:55:57.151
The power struggle goes on becoming subtler and subtler.

00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:06.151
Then again money problems come up. Some people think that

00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:09.151
Sahaja Yoga is a very big way of making money.

00:56:09.151 --> 00:56:13.151
Or some people think that, “We can get lot of money, because

00:56:13.151 --> 00:56:18.151
Mother blesses people with money, affluence, so let us be in Sahaja Yoga,”

00:56:18.151 --> 00:56:20.151
but don’t spend a single pai, you see,

00:56:20.151 --> 00:56:27.151
just manage it. No! It’s not like that. It’s the other way round!

00:56:30.151 --> 00:56:33.151
It’s again the another dilemma is there that,

00:56:33.151 --> 00:56:43.151
in India which is a place of poverty compare to all of you, everyone donates money.

00:56:43.151 --> 00:56:49.151
All the trustees in every centre wherever there are trustees,

00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:54.151
have to donate at least five thousand rupees to become the trustees.

00:56:54.151 --> 00:56:58.151
Of course, I don’t get anything out of it,

00:56:58.151 --> 00:57:02.051
but I must have donated I don’t know how many how much Myself

00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:05.151
to become the Trustee of Sahaja Yogis!

00:57:06.451 --> 00:57:09.451
But you have to donate.

00:57:12.451 --> 00:57:18.451
And when you become miserly again that means, again, it’s the same thing going on.

00:57:20.451 --> 00:57:25.451
You have bank balances, but the source is finished and you have nothing left.

00:57:26.451 --> 00:57:30.451
The bank balance should be with God.

00:57:30.451 --> 00:57:35.451
Then He gives you interest more than the capital.

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:38.451
Is there any bank which does that?

00:57:41.451 --> 00:57:45.451
At least not the Swiss Bank!

00:57:47.451 --> 00:57:50.451
You have to pay for keeping money with them.

00:57:54.451 --> 00:58:03.451
That’s how it is. You should tap . Always try to go to the source.

00:58:06.451 --> 00:58:11.451
This becomes subtler and subtler in the sense

00:58:11.451 --> 00:58:15.451
that people think that now their children are realized souls.

00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:20.451
All right, so what? They are not Gods, are they?

00:58:20.451 --> 00:58:25.451
They get so involved with their children, I mean, this is another stupidity women fall into.

00:58:27.451 --> 00:58:30.451
But to them their child is so important,

00:58:30.451 --> 00:58:32.451
they get so adhered to the child.

00:58:32.451 --> 00:58:37.451
I mean, first they used to neglect the children, now they become so attached to their children

00:58:37.451 --> 00:58:41.451
that they look like glued people all the time.

00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:48.451
And such children cannot grow properly unless and until you give them freedom.

00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:52.451
Give them full freedom to grow.

00:58:52.451 --> 00:59:01.451
But guidance, of course, that they are majestic people, meaning Sahaja Yogis,

00:59:01.451 --> 00:59:06.451
they are born realised as a Sahaja Yogi, as a good Sahaja Yogi how they should behave.

00:59:06.451 --> 00:59:11.451
Have a rapport, talk to them, tell them about it, how they be.

00:59:11.451 --> 00:59:16.451
Develop that self-respect within them that they should be like this.

00:59:16.451 --> 00:59:18.451
Not to glue them to you.

00:59:22.451 --> 00:59:26.451
That’s not the way. Children will never grow properly, even physically,

00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:28.451
if you glue them to yourself.

00:59:30.451 --> 00:59:35.451
In the West now I see new ideas coming up that the children must be glued to the mother.

00:59:36.451 --> 00:59:41.451
This is from one extreme to another extreme.They’ll become very left-sided.

00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:46.451
Even if they’ll be grown up in age they won’t grow up in their brains.

00:59:46.451 --> 00:59:50.451
They won’t grow up in their behaviour if they are glued with the mother.

00:59:51.451 --> 00:59:55.451
If they cry for a while, little bit, doesn’t matter,

00:59:55.451 --> 00:59:59.451
but the children must be made to sleep away from the mother.

00:59:59.451 --> 01:00:04.451
All the time you should not carry your children in your lap. There is no need at all.

01:00:05.451 --> 01:00:11.451
But this is not that the child wants, is the mother who wants this kind of a thing.

01:00:13.451 --> 01:00:20.451
And some fathers also I have seen glued down to their children

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:28.451
and then they say, “Mother, my child is spoiled, he’s like this, like that.”

01:00:28.451 --> 01:00:33.451
Such children will get possessed very fast if you make the children dependant on you.

01:00:33.451 --> 01:00:36.451
Very fast they’ll become possessed.

01:00:36.451 --> 01:00:40.451
If you make them over-independent, “You are on your own”,

01:00:40.451 --> 01:00:43.451
like the other side was that when we were in Oxted

01:00:43.451 --> 01:00:48.451
a girl of seven years used to come and give us newspapers.

01:00:48.451 --> 01:00:51.451
And she was a daughter of a lord!

01:00:51.451 --> 01:00:56.451
At about five o’clock in the morning, in that cold she used to climb up all the way

01:00:56.451 --> 01:01:00.451
on a bicycle delivering those newspapers.

01:01:00.451 --> 01:01:03.451
And when I told her mother, “What are you doing? It’s very dangerous,

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:06.451
this child is in danger, she is a girl, how can you do that to her?”

01:01:06.451 --> 01:01:09.451
she said, “No, no, she has to be on her own.”

01:01:11.451 --> 01:01:17.451
So, the one side is to be on her own and another side is to glue them,

01:01:17.451 --> 01:01:22.451
is again the same subtle attitude of possessiveness. It’s possessiveness,

01:01:22.451 --> 01:01:28.451
"This is my child, I must look after the child, the child is self-realised soul, this, that.”

01:01:28.451 --> 01:01:34.451
Only your child is not realised soul, everybody’s child is the realised soul in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:34.451 --> 01:01:37.451
How much do you do for other’s children?

01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:40.451
Or only you look after your own child?

01:01:42.451 --> 01:01:46.451
The custom should be: if you buy one thing for your child,

01:01:46.451 --> 01:01:50.451
buy two more things for another child.

01:01:50.451 --> 01:01:55.451
Buy better things for another child and less things for your child.

01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:03.451
Let your child share his things with others.

01:02:04.451 --> 01:02:08.451
At the time when you are buying something, buy something that he can share.

01:02:08.451 --> 01:02:10.451
Teach him how to share.

01:02:10.451 --> 01:02:16.451
Because though they are realised souls, with the mothers and the fathers like this

01:02:16.451 --> 01:02:21.451
they’ll become again the same miserly old-style people:

01:02:23.451 --> 01:02:29.451
quarrelsome, fighting, beating each other, troubling each other.

01:02:29.451 --> 01:02:31.451
So be careful!

01:02:31.451 --> 01:02:42.451
Being realised-souls, you will be surprised, they will be extremely, extremely convenient for you.

01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:45.451
Give them to other Sahaja Yogis to handle, depend on them,

01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:47.451
let them look after.

01:02:47.451 --> 01:02:54.451
And the homogeneous feeling comes through children. Children are the ones who bind each other.

01:02:54.451 --> 01:02:58.451
But, “Don’t touch my child! This is my child!”

01:02:58.451 --> 01:03:01.451
you close the door as soon as somebody comes in.

01:03:02.451 --> 01:03:06.451
That’s you are going back in the same way as your mothers have been.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:10.451
There’s no war on in Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:11.451 --> 01:03:15.451
We are in the government of God.

01:03:16.451 --> 01:03:19.451
This realisation has to come.

01:03:19.451 --> 01:03:24.451
There is no need to seek all these useless things, these pleasures of life.

01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:30.451
Understand your responsibility

01:03:30.451 --> 01:03:36.451
that you are Sahaja Yogis first and last and, in the middle

01:03:38.451 --> 01:03:42.451
and as Sahaja Yogis what is your duty?

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:48.451
Is to be completely dedicated for the betterment and the benevolence of others.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:54.451
That’s the only thing which is going to nourish you to rise.

01:03:54.451 --> 01:03:58.451
If you look after your children like this, like mad, it’s not going to help you .

01:03:58.451 --> 01:04:00.451
You’ll have problems.

01:04:00.451 --> 01:04:03.451
If you neglect your children, you will have problems.

01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:13.451
So come in the centre and be just witnesses of all that.

01:04:17.451 --> 01:04:23.451
It’s a very common failing in the beginning of every Sahaja Yogi who comes to Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:23.451 --> 01:04:29.451
They’ll send me the list of five generations on this side and five generations on this side

01:04:29.451 --> 01:04:40.451
"my fathers, brothers, sisters, this thing, that thing, real cousins, real this thing is sick.

01:04:40.451 --> 01:04:43.451
So please, Mother, put Your attention.”

01:04:43.451 --> 01:04:47.451
And when I put my attention, the attention returns back, I can’t find that.

01:04:49.451 --> 01:04:55.451
It starts like that to begin with. Alright, in the beginning I say, “Alright, just now they have entered.”

01:04:55.451 --> 01:04:59.451
"But you don’t know", these are tentacles which keep you down,

01:04:59.451 --> 01:05:05.451
they do not allow you to rise in the domain of God.

01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:11.451
In the domain of God everything that is yours, even your hair,

01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:14.451
are looked after by God Almighty.

01:05:14.451 --> 01:05:20.451
Every thing! Can you understand that? Can you realise that?

01:05:20.451 --> 01:05:31.451
Is all done by billions and billions and billions of powers of Adi Shakti.

01:05:36.451 --> 01:05:42.451
What can you do yourself? Nothing! Except for worrying and troubling.

01:05:42.451 --> 01:05:51.451
So just if you believe and assume that power today

01:05:51.451 --> 01:05:55.451
that you are in the domain of God,

01:05:56.451 --> 01:06:00.451
which is active benevolence,

01:06:00.451 --> 01:06:05.451
the nature of it is active benevolence

01:06:06.451 --> 01:06:08.451
as we say ‘hita’  (हित).

01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:17.451
If you are sick, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:17.451 --> 01:06:20.451
If you are alright, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:20.451 --> 01:06:26.451
If you have money, it is for your benevolence. If you don’t have money, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:30.451 --> 01:06:35.451
Everything does good for you in the domain of God.

01:06:35.451 --> 01:06:42.451
Do not judge it according to your own standards.

01:06:42.451 --> 01:06:49.451
Whom do you think to be a person who is benevolent in this world apart from Me?

01:06:51.451 --> 01:06:53.451
Really, in the real sense of the word?

01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:58.451
Supposing you take a man who is very rich;

01:06:58.451 --> 01:07:00.451
is he benevolent?

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:07.451
No. Is he happy? No. Is he respected? No.

01:07:11.451 --> 01:07:17.451
At least he has to be a realised soul to be somewhere near that description.

01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:23.451
And if you have to ascend in the domain of God,

01:07:23.451 --> 01:07:27.451
you have to know that everything works through His power:

01:07:27.451 --> 01:07:36.451
your activity, your inactivity, your sleep, everything is worked through His powers of love.

01:07:36.451 --> 01:07:41.451
Love can never harm, can never destroy.

01:07:41.451 --> 01:07:44.451
You go a little ahead with it

01:07:47.451 --> 01:07:53.451
and it showers flowers upon you.

01:07:55.451 --> 01:08:02.451
But understand your nature: supposing you are a left-sided person.

01:08:02.451 --> 01:08:06.451
Mostly I’ve seen left sided persons always want to do my pujas.

01:08:06.451 --> 01:08:11.451
And the right-sided person are organising. Do the other way round.

01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:19.451
must know your nature, give yourself a balance, and then enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:08:19.451 --> 01:08:24.451
Like you're entering into a door, say for example,

01:08:24.451 --> 01:08:27.451
and you have too much load on your back,

01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:29.451
meaning you are a left-sided person.

01:08:29.451 --> 01:08:36.451
Then take down the load from your back on your head and enter in.

01:08:36.451 --> 01:08:43.451
But if you have too much on your head, put it on your back and enter in.

01:08:43.451 --> 01:08:46.451
Because you’re tired. You do it every day.

01:08:46.451 --> 01:08:50.451
Supposing this hand is tired, you put it on the left hand.

01:08:50.451 --> 01:08:55.451
I see in aeroplane when people are walking, they are holding it in one hand

01:08:55.451 --> 01:08:59.451
and automatically when it is tired, they put it to the left – automatically.

01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:01.451
They are not Sahaja Yogis!

01:09:02.451 --> 01:09:08.451
In the same way in life also, if you have done one-sidedness too much,

01:09:08.451 --> 01:09:13.451
try to do the other side and give yourself a balance.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:20.451
Navaratri is the day to give you the balance.

01:09:21.451 --> 01:09:28.451
Those whose right hand is tired will get the power in the left hand.

01:09:28.451 --> 01:09:37.451
Those who have the left hand tired will get the power on the right hand to share the load.

01:09:38.451 --> 01:09:46.451
So those who are having money problems will solve their money problems.

01:09:47.451 --> 01:09:53.451
And those who have sleeping problems will solve their sleeping problems.

01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:58.451
But one can say if somebody has both, then what do they do?

01:09:58.451 --> 01:10:04.451
I know of somebody, I lived there, in that country

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:09.451
where they have both the problems, they sleep as well as they have no money, and they are not bothered!

01:10:24.451 --> 01:10:27.451
So, for such people what should we do?

01:10:27.451 --> 01:10:32.451
Of course, I won’t tell you, but one has to do something about it!

01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:42.451
One has to work out something.

01:10:45.451 --> 01:10:47.451
They just don’t move

01:10:47.451 --> 01:10:53.451
and if you tell them, answer is, “I know. I know I sleep a lot;

01:10:53.451 --> 01:10:57.451
I know I’m like this. I know. I know.”

01:10:57.451 --> 01:11:00.451
That’s all. Then what do you say?

01:11:00.451 --> 01:11:06.451
It stops you completely. You can’t go further. If they know, what more to be told?

01:11:10.451 --> 01:11:20.451
This is a complete mountain there standing just to finish you completely.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:32.451
So, one has to do.

01:11:34.451 --> 01:11:36.451
Everyone has to do something.

01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:38.451
Somebody is working it out,

01:11:38.451 --> 01:11:42.251
somebody is doing some work,

01:11:42.251 --> 01:11:44.251
and another is not helping.

01:11:44.251 --> 01:11:51.251
Then that cannot be completed, it’s a collective work, you cannot! One person cannot do it.

01:11:52.251 --> 01:11:57.251
I’ve seen it happens like this. It’s a collective work.

01:11:57.251 --> 01:12:03.251
So, we come to the position that Navaratri today is not the work of Mother only,

01:12:03.251 --> 01:12:07.251
which She did so far, is the work of every one of you.

01:12:08.251 --> 01:12:10.251
I cannot do it single-handed.

01:12:12.251 --> 01:12:15.251
If I could, there was no need for you to be here,

01:12:15.251 --> 01:12:20.251
I would have built the aeroplane, put you there, pushed them some or other, lock it up and put you there.

01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:22.251
It’s not possible.

01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:26.251
You all have to carry your own aeroplanes.

01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:30.251
Build it up and carry it yourself with dignity,

01:12:30.251 --> 01:12:33.251
not like small children. So, you have to mature.

01:12:34.251 --> 01:12:39.251
And for that maturity it’s a collective thing that has to take place.

01:12:39.251 --> 01:12:43.251
In the beginning in the school, alright, they’ll teach you two plus two is equal to four.

01:12:43.251 --> 01:12:47.251
But when you go to the college, you have to do it yourself,

01:12:48.251 --> 01:12:51.251
solve the problem yourself.

01:12:51.251 --> 01:12:59.251
And that’s what it is today. Sahaja Yoga is good, you get your Realisation in these modern times,

01:12:59.251 --> 01:13:03.251
but the maturity has to take place,

01:13:03.251 --> 01:13:05.251
otherwise useless.

01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:13.251
Up to the seed it was alright, but once it is sprouted it must become the tree, otherwise it’s useless.

01:13:14.251 --> 01:13:17.251
And that all of you have to do together,

01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:20.251
helping each other, understanding each other.

01:13:20.251 --> 01:13:24.251
And everyone has to work it out.

01:13:24.251 --> 01:13:27.251
Even if one person suffers, I suffer.

01:13:32.251 --> 01:13:36.251
The whole thing has become collective.

01:13:38.251 --> 01:13:41.251
The Devi has become collective.

01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:46.251
It’s a venture.

01:13:48.251 --> 01:13:53.251
It’s a venture, I know, too much of it. There was no other way out.

01:13:53.251 --> 01:14:01.251
It’s like crucifixion of every part of Your body, every cell of Your body.

01:14:04.251 --> 01:14:06.251
But it’s alright.

01:14:09.251 --> 01:14:13.251
So today, instead of feeling guilty,

01:14:13.251 --> 01:14:19.251
you should be filled with tremendous courage and tremendous enthusiasm:

01:14:19.251 --> 01:14:24.251
that we have to do it, because Mother has given us the power.

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:27.251
We can do it; nothing should keep us down.

01:14:28.251 --> 01:14:30.251
And we are going to help each other.

01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:36.251
One person is doing one job, nobody will look at it, you see, they won’t just move!

01:14:36.251 --> 01:14:41.251
"I know, I’m sitting down, I know. I don’t do anything I know.”

01:14:45.251 --> 01:14:48.251
And in Sahaja Yoga, it has become even subtler,

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:52.251
"I want to do but there’s a bhoot in me which doesn’t allow me to do it.”

01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:56.251
So, you get out with your bhoot!

01:14:57.251 --> 01:14:59.251
That’s what it is.

01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:11.251
All these arguments are stupid, of no value in Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:11.251 --> 01:15:15.251
That means you have not understood the meaning of Sahaja Yoga,

01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:21.251
you have not understood the meaning of yourself, and you have no respect for your life.

01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:22.251
That’s what it is.

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:26.251
If you indulge into such thinking, then it is no good.

01:15:26.251 --> 01:15:31.251
But today you have to promise to yourself and to me within your heart

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:37.251
that you are going to be filled with that enthusiasm and that shakti.

01:15:39.251 --> 01:15:42.251
The time has come.

01:15:48.251 --> 01:15:53.251
Which is going to make you real yogis.

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:58.251
Complete dedication.

01:15:58.251 --> 01:16:04.251
Imagine these PLO people what they are doing, fearlessly.

01:16:04.251 --> 01:16:06.251
I mean, all kinds of people you see around you

01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:09.251
even in Kali Yuga are so dedicated to something nonsensical.

01:16:09.251 --> 01:16:13.251
Why can’t we be dedicated to something so sensible?

01:16:17.251 --> 01:16:20.251
They are not afraid of anything,

01:16:20.251 --> 01:16:23.251
they are dare devils.

01:16:23.251 --> 01:16:25.251
Why can’t we become like that?

01:16:26.251 --> 01:16:29.251
What’s wrong with us?

01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:37.251
So, every one of us must have that enthusiasm and “I’m an institution by myself.

01:16:37.251 --> 01:16:42.251
And I’m going to do it, I’m not going to take advantage of the ashram life,

01:16:42.251 --> 01:16:46.251
nicely settled down in the ashram. You see very good, cheap.”

01:16:46.251 --> 01:16:50.251
No! We are all going to move out also

01:16:50.251 --> 01:16:53.251
and take up a place somewhere else.

01:16:53.251 --> 01:16:55.251
For the time being ashram is alright.

01:16:55.251 --> 01:16:58.251
But then give more room to others who are coming.

01:16:58.251 --> 01:17:02.251
You get out of it. Go out and stay somewhere and work it out.

01:17:04.251 --> 01:17:08.251
Then in the ashram, “This is my house, I have spent money for this,

01:17:08.251 --> 01:17:12.251
this is my furniture, this is this thing, that thing.”

01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:23.251
Actually, you should know how to live on a string, shoestring, as they say, on a shoestring.

01:17:23.251 --> 01:17:29.251
Of course, now I’m feeling that every ashram has such a lot of furniture that they had to [UNCLEAR bring].

01:17:30.251 --> 01:17:33.251
Better live on a shoestring.

01:17:33.251 --> 01:17:39.251
So the tapasya starts.

01:17:39.251 --> 01:17:42.251
Go into a penance yourself.

01:17:42.251 --> 01:17:47.251
But then I will hear, “Mother, I’m on a tapasya, I’m eating only once.”

01:17:47.251 --> 01:17:52.251
Why? Who ask you to be on tapasya? Enjoy! Enjoy your tapasya!

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:55.251
Then it is Sahaja, otherwise: nonsense.

01:17:55.251 --> 01:17:59.251
Enjoy. If you can enjoy your tapasya then you are sahaj;

01:17:59.251 --> 01:18:03.251
With enthusiasm. Look at these PLOs,

01:18:04.251 --> 01:18:07.251
look at these people,

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:15.251
do they say, "We are going in a tapasya”? Nothing.

01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:19.251
You have examples of people around you.

01:18:20.251 --> 01:18:23.251
But we can’t say  they are possessed by bhoots.

01:18:23.251 --> 01:18:29.251
Or even if they are what about you? You better get possessed by sahaj bhoots for a change!

01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:35.251
If that’s the way, only, you can be motivated.

01:18:41.251 --> 01:18:47.251
So, tell your mind, “No explanations, nothing doing. I am going to show my worth!”

01:18:55.251 --> 01:19:00.251
But all the time if the attention is just to show off

01:19:00.251 --> 01:19:04.251
or to be in my attention

01:19:05.251 --> 01:19:12.251
or to be in contact with me, to be writing to me or something, is not going to help at all.

01:19:17.251 --> 01:19:23.251
I am just a mirror, and you see within myself yourself, in the true way.

01:19:23.251 --> 01:19:29.251
And also, this mirror, is full of maya.

01:19:29.251 --> 01:19:39.251
So, a devil may look into this mirror, and may look like a saint to him.

01:19:39.251 --> 01:19:43.251
If he has ego, he might look like a saint to himself.

01:19:45.251 --> 01:19:56.251
Or if he is a left-sided person he might think he is the incarnation of Bhairava – he might.

01:20:00.251 --> 01:20:10.251
But if he is truthful, he can see clearly that he is the highest of highest, he's a sahaja yogi

01:20:10.251 --> 01:20:16.251
And unless and until you see yourself like that, know that it’s a maya.

01:20:21.251 --> 01:20:28.251
So, to realise that you have achieved a lot by getting your Realisation,

01:20:28.251 --> 01:20:32.251
of rising so much higher above all these petty ideas.

01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:37.251
Every idea is petty, whether it is economics, politics, philosophy,

01:20:37.251 --> 01:20:41.251
any ism, anything is all petty for a Sahaja Yogi,

01:20:44.251 --> 01:20:50.251
because none of them know even this much about God’s domain.

01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:53.251
What are they talking about is economics!

01:20:57.251 --> 01:21:00.251
They do not know anything about His politics.

01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:07.251
They do not know anything that there is a miraculous power

01:21:07.251 --> 01:21:10.251
which rules the whole Universe,

01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:16.251
and which is so efficient. Which never fails.

01:21:17.251 --> 01:21:23.251
So timely, so sensible, so interesting, dramatic.

01:21:23.251 --> 01:21:28.251
See how we reserved all these things in no time.

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:33.251
How we got to this place. I was to have this puja here.

01:21:33.251 --> 01:21:36.251
All this you know. How I came here.

01:21:36.251 --> 01:21:41.251
See the miracle working. How the powers of the Divine are working.

01:21:41.251 --> 01:21:43.251
You be the proper instrument of the Divine.

01:21:43.251 --> 01:21:46.251
And it has another force as I told you

01:21:46.251 --> 01:21:50.251
centripetal and centrifugal – and you might be thrown out.

01:21:52.251 --> 01:21:58.251
So be careful on that point. Face yourself in truthfulness!

01:21:58.251 --> 01:22:02.251
Do not get pampered by your ego or morosed  by your superego!

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:07.251
Just see for yourself as a powerful instrument of love.

01:22:07.251 --> 01:22:10.251
But in love you do not become indiscrete.

01:22:12.251 --> 01:22:20.251
Steadily, beautifully, gently you attend to it.

01:22:22.251 --> 01:22:28.251
And so much power can be born.

01:22:28.251 --> 01:22:33.251
You will be amazed that water, which looks something so frivolous to us,

01:22:33.251 --> 01:22:36.251
has so much power in it.

01:22:37.251 --> 01:22:39.251
You know about hydrostatics.

01:22:42.251 --> 01:22:46.251
This Mother Earth which looks so simple:

01:22:46.251 --> 01:22:51.251
We walk on Her on our feet. She attracts us on ourself.

01:22:51.251 --> 01:22:54.251
She’s spinning with such a speed Herself,

01:22:54.251 --> 01:22:56.251
She keeps us sticking on to Her.

01:22:57.251 --> 01:23:02.251
She’s doing thousands and thousands of tremendous jobs,

01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:06.251
this great Mother Earth She looks so simple.

01:23:06.251 --> 01:23:14.251
She’s so powerful. In the same way you are made out of this Ganesha Tattwa which is so tremendous.

01:23:18.251 --> 01:23:22.251
This Navaratri should give you that power,

01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:28.251
those nine powers of nine chakras.

01:23:28.251 --> 01:23:33.251
Seven chakras: you already know.

01:23:33.251 --> 01:23:38.251
Above that you become the master yourself,

01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:44.251
and then you become the Power yourself.

01:23:52.251 --> 01:23:54.251
May God bless you!
