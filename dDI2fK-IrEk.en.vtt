WEBVTT

20:22.613 --> 20:28.613
Today is a great day of Navaratri,

20:29.613 --> 20:35.113
we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh.

20:35.113 --> 20:44.113
Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahasaraswati

20:44.113 --> 20:49.113
finished Her work

20:49.113 --> 20:54.113
and the incarnation of the Shakti itself started.

20:54.113 --> 20:59.613
So, at twelve o’clock today the Devi takes the Shakti upon Herself.

20:59.613 --> 21:08.613
Of course, as you know that Mahakali and Mahasaraswati,

21:08.613 --> 21:20.613
both are the powers of Shri Sadashiva.

21:20.613 --> 21:28.613
Adi Shakti first formed Herself into Mahakali,

21:28.613 --> 21:33.613
which is the Power of Desire.

21:33.613 --> 21:38.613
But all these powers are nothing

21:38.613 --> 21:45.613
but the power of God’s love.

21:45.613 --> 21:56.613
So, in the series of this great love of God,

21:56.613 --> 22:02.613
Adi Shakti had to first become the Power of Desire.

22:02.613 --> 22:03.613
In the same way,

22:03.613 --> 22:08.613
Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this power of love

22:08.613 --> 22:13.613
have to have full desire in their heart.

22:13.613 --> 22:20.613
Desire to love.

22:20.613 --> 22:27.613
That desire is very different from

22:27.613 --> 22:32.613
the other kinds of human love we have known.

22:32.613 --> 22:36.613
In other kinds of human love,

22:36.613 --> 22:39.613
when we have relations with others,

22:39.613 --> 22:43.613
we have expectations,

22:44.613 --> 22:49.613
and that’s why it is very disappointing.

22:49.613 --> 22:53.613
Our expectations always run higher

22:53.613 --> 22:59.613
than our understanding and realities.

22:59.613 --> 23:04.613
And so we suffer from disappointments and frustrations.

23:04.613 --> 23:11.113
And the love that has to be nourishing and fulfilling

23:11.113 --> 23:15.113
becomes a thankless job.

23:15.113 --> 23:20.113
So, when it reflects in the human beings,

23:20.113 --> 23:25.113
it is the desire to be loved by everyone,

23:25.113 --> 23:29.113
not to love others.

23:29.113 --> 23:32.113
Everyone should love you,

23:32.113 --> 23:36.113
but how far you love another is the point.

23:36.113 --> 23:39.113
Naturally everyone for oneself!

23:39.113 --> 23:42.113
So really nobody loves.

23:42.113 --> 23:47.113
But when it comes to real love

23:47.113 --> 23:53.113
then sacrifice, becomes a nature.

23:53.113 --> 23:57.113
You don’t call it a sacrifice but you call it a privilege.

23:57.113 --> 24:02.113
We say it’s a privilege to give love.

24:02.113 --> 24:07.113
It’s a great chance that we can love.

24:07.113 --> 24:12.113
It’s our great fortune that we can love.

24:12.113 --> 24:17.113
It’s God’s blessings that we can love and give.

24:17.113 --> 24:23.113
So the giving starts when you realise,

24:23.113 --> 24:27.113
not understand but realise the love,

24:27.113 --> 24:31.113
the power of love expressing .

24:31.113 --> 24:35.113
That’s the third power, which starts expressing .

24:35.113 --> 24:37.113
Because, after this,

24:37.113 --> 24:41.113
a person becomes active, kriyasheet.

24:41.113 --> 24:45.113
That’s how the action of

24:45.113 --> 24:50.113
achieving that state of giving love starts.

24:50.113 --> 24:54.113
To begin with we start activating in so many ways.

24:54.113 --> 25:00.113
As I said, we start expecting

25:00.113 --> 25:07.113
and thinking that we are loving others.

25:07.113 --> 25:11.113
We act for that.

25:11.113 --> 25:15.113
In that madness that others should love us,

25:15.113 --> 25:17.113
others should respect us,

25:17.113 --> 25:19.113
others should think we are great,

25:19.113 --> 25:21.113
they should recognise us

25:21.113 --> 25:26.113
we start loving something else which is not so important.

25:26.113 --> 25:31.113
So, we go on first to money,

25:31.113 --> 25:34.113
money becomes a very important point.

25:34.113 --> 25:40.113
We think that, if we have money, people will love us.

25:40.113 --> 25:44.113
We become very powerful as moneyed people,

25:44.113 --> 25:47.113
as rich people.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.113
So we start accumulating money,

25:49.113 --> 25:56.113
we start loving the money.

25:56.113 --> 25:59.113
But money is not the Truth;

25:59.113 --> 26:01.113
we don’t love the Truth.

26:01.113 --> 26:04.113
When we start loving the money

26:04.113 --> 26:07.113
we start thinking about problems of money.

26:07.113 --> 26:15.113
Such people can become miserly to such an extent

26:15.113 --> 26:18.113
that even towards God they become miserly.

26:18.113 --> 26:19.113
They never have money actually,

26:19.113 --> 26:22.113
because if you cannot spend your money, you have no money.

26:22.113 --> 26:27.113
If it is not available what’s the use of having all the money?

26:27.113 --> 26:30.113
That’s how they have problems

26:30.113 --> 26:37.113
because they love money and not the God Almighty.

26:37.113 --> 26:43.113
They’re worried about money but not about the Truth.

26:43.113 --> 26:48.113
Then with that they go to a second thing: is the power.

26:48.113 --> 26:51.113
They want to have the power;

26:51.113 --> 26:53.113
they want to become presidents,

26:53.263 --> 26:58.113
ministers and bureaucrats and all that.

26:58.113 --> 27:01.113
They want to have the power:

27:01.113 --> 27:04.113
they think by having great power

27:04.113 --> 27:06.113
people will respect them and love them.

27:06.113 --> 27:11.113
But they get drowned in fear.

27:11.113 --> 27:15.113
What they get is fear. All the time they have fear.

27:15.113 --> 27:18.113
Also moneyed people have fear.

27:18.113 --> 27:24.113
That’s why in the Bible it is said that: wages of sin is fear.

27:24.113 --> 27:29.113
What is sin? Sin is not to love the Truth.

27:29.113 --> 27:33.113
Is the sin. When you don’t love the Truth then it is sin.

27:33.113 --> 27:39.113
So when you start getting worried about your positions…

27:39.113 --> 27:45.113
Like the president feels that he’ll lose his job,

27:45.113 --> 27:52.113
the vice president thinks that he’ll be sacked,

27:52.113 --> 27:57.113
the prime minister thinks he may not be elected,

27:57.113 --> 28:01.113
the bureaucrats think they will lose their jobs,

28:01.113 --> 28:03.113
they won’t get promotions or something,

28:03.113 --> 28:05.113
there will be problem.

28:05.113 --> 28:09.113
All these people are suffering from terrible sense of fear.

28:09.113 --> 28:12.113
They have no freedom of any kind.

28:12.113 --> 28:17.113
And in that category people just go down so much with fear,

28:17.113 --> 28:21.113
that even worse than people with money.

28:21.113 --> 28:24.113
Because once they are lost they are lost.

28:24.113 --> 28:28.113
They can never revive. No chance.

28:28.113 --> 28:30.113
Once you lose the elections you are lost,

28:30.113 --> 28:31.113
nobody is going to look at you.

28:31.113 --> 28:35.113
I have known people who have been at a very high position

28:35.113 --> 28:40.113
and once they lose that position nobody looks at them,

28:40.113 --> 28:41.113
they just walk like straight,

28:41.113 --> 28:45.113
otherwise there will be at least hundred cars to receive them.

28:45.113 --> 28:49.113
And once they lose their jobs there’s nobody even to look at them.

28:49.113 --> 28:52.113
They just walk like ordinary people.

28:52.113 --> 28:55.113
Even seeing all these things happening,

28:55.113 --> 29:01.113
this truth just coming before them so clearly,

29:01.113 --> 29:05.113
they do not keep to that truth,

29:05.113 --> 29:08.113
they do not realise that truth,

29:08.113 --> 29:14.113
they do not have that realisation within them.

29:14.113 --> 29:19.113
They understand for a while and they go after that.

29:19.113 --> 29:22.113
Then when the person dies,

29:22.113 --> 29:28.113
they see a moneyed man, a rich man is forgotten,

29:28.113 --> 29:32.113
nobody is bothered about them, who was a rich man.

29:32.113 --> 29:34.113
On the contrary, the people,

29:34.113 --> 29:38.113
the prime ministers and all those high-ranking people, when they die,

29:38.113 --> 29:42.113
immediately books start coming out about their private life:

29:42.113 --> 29:46.113
all the dirty things they did

29:46.113 --> 29:51.113
and all the horrible things they did and what sort of life they led

29:51.113 --> 29:53.113
There’s no fragrance in their life,

29:53.113 --> 29:57.113
no idealism. Nothing.

29:57.113 --> 30:00.113
Because the responsibility

30:00.113 --> 30:03.113
that they have to the public

30:03.113 --> 30:07.113
and to themselves they have not understood it

30:07.113 --> 30:10.113
and they made a mess of their private life.

30:10.113 --> 30:16.113
That’s why this kind of a reaction comes after it.

30:16.113 --> 30:19.113
The other day I was reading

30:19.113 --> 30:23.113
an interview with a very well-known actor.

30:23.113 --> 30:27.113
He’s a born realised fellow, I know, but he’s gone down completely.

30:27.113 --> 30:30.113
He says, “I think, what’s the harm in drinking,

30:30.113 --> 30:32.113
what’s the harm in gambling,?

30:32.113 --> 30:34.113
what’s the harm in smoking?

30:34.113 --> 30:38.113
Because, after all, I’m going to die

30:38.113 --> 30:43.113
and then who is going to bother?

30:43.113 --> 30:45.113
Supposing, I get cancer, so what?

30:45.113 --> 30:47.113
In any case I’m going to die.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.813
So why not enjoy these pleasures of life?”

30:49.813 --> 30:55.813
But what about death? You continue with it.

30:55.813 --> 30:59.813
Then all that you’ve been doing will come out,

30:59.813 --> 31:05.813
and people will not to like to have your photograph in the household.

31:05.813 --> 31:08.813
Children will spit at you. What about that?

31:08.813 --> 31:13.813
Your life is not what it is today for three, four years or ten years

31:13.813 --> 31:16.813
or fifteen years of your so-called success.

31:16.813 --> 31:18.813
But when you die

31:18.813 --> 31:22.813
all this craziness will disappear,

31:22.813 --> 31:26.813
and people will come out with truth about you.

31:26.813 --> 31:32.813
That is how this power to be popular finishes off.

31:32.813 --> 31:36.813
This cheap popularity,

31:36.813 --> 31:44.813
this cheap type of treatment towards yourself

31:44.813 --> 31:50.813
gives you a personality that will not be worshipped,

31:50.813 --> 31:53.813
that will not be accepted.

31:53.813 --> 31:56.813
Nobody will quote you as something great.

31:56.813 --> 31:58.813
For some time, it will continue,

31:58.813 --> 32:04.813
but in totality such a person has given nothing to humanity.

32:04.813 --> 32:11.813
That’s how the power of Saraswati works.

32:11.813 --> 32:13.813
People go into action

32:13.813 --> 32:22.813
for achieving the results of getting into power.

32:22.813 --> 32:28.813
But it should act to discover the truth.

32:28.813 --> 32:38.813
Saraswati should give you the leap to find out the truth.

32:38.813 --> 32:45.813
That, when you act in those funny places and streets,

32:45.813 --> 32:48.813
you discover this is not the path, we have missed it.

32:48.813 --> 32:53.813
The path is somewhere else. We’ve lost it.

32:53.813 --> 32:56.813
Let us find out the real path because this doesn’t give joy.

32:56.813 --> 32:58.813
This one can learn from others,

32:58.813 --> 33:03.813
from history, from so many other things and from your own parents,

33:03.813 --> 33:09.813
from your society and from yourself and from your children also.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.813
If you want to learn,

33:11.813 --> 33:15.813
that is the quality of Saraswati pujaris,

33:15.813 --> 33:20.813
that they take to gyana, they take to reality.

33:20.813 --> 33:23.813
Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas,

33:23.813 --> 33:25.813
it’s said that:

33:25.813 --> 33:29.813
if by reading these four Vedas,

33:29.813 --> 33:33.813
if you do not get the veeda,

33:33.813 --> 33:38.813
veeda is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realisation,

33:38.813 --> 33:47.813
there is no use reading these Vedas.

33:47.813 --> 33:55.813
So the Saraswati’s first thing is that through the reading,

33:55.813 --> 34:00.813
through the process of Saraswati’s manifestation,

34:00.813 --> 34:05.813
you must reach a point to understand that this is a rat-race,

34:05.813 --> 34:06.813
and we have to get out of it.

34:06.813 --> 34:08.813
We have to step out.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.813
When that happens,

34:10.813 --> 34:13.813
then the Mahalakshmi Tattwa starts working in you,

34:13.813 --> 34:18.813
that is the third tattwa, which starts working.

34:23.813 --> 34:25.813
Mahalakshmi Tattwa

34:25.813 --> 34:30.813
then starts expressing its love in its full extent

34:30.813 --> 34:35.813
through evolutionary process in human beings.

34:35.813 --> 34:39.813
He starts evolving simultaneously.

34:39.813 --> 34:43.813
He sees on both the sides what’s happening,

34:43.813 --> 34:51.813
like a witness and he uses his Mahalakshmi power.

34:51.813 --> 34:55.813
In the first part of the Mahalakshmi power

34:55.813 --> 35:03.813
he starts getting out of the common rut of the family bondages

35:03.813 --> 35:11.813
and the other human bondages of power,

35:11.813 --> 35:14.813
money, lust

35:14.813 --> 35:19.813
and he starts moving on a higher plane.

35:19.813 --> 35:27.813
He gives us a new idea of popularity

35:27.813 --> 35:32.813
by establishing the Truth.

35:32.813 --> 35:35.813
Because through Mahalakshmi power

35:35.813 --> 35:41.813
you discover the Truth on your central nervous system

35:41.813 --> 35:52.813
and ultimately it is the light of an enlightened brain.

35:55.813 --> 36:00.813
When the Mahalakshmi power starts manifesting,

36:00.813 --> 36:05.813
one starts thinking of others.

36:05.813 --> 36:08.813
Not on material level,

36:08.813 --> 36:10.813
that materially people are suffering,

36:10.813 --> 36:13.813
“Now there are people in Ethiopia, who will save?

36:13.813 --> 36:15.813
We must give them some food, this, that.

36:15.813 --> 36:21.813
” No! They go to the roots of the problems. Why?

36:21.813 --> 36:23.813
Or they don’t think there should be

36:23.813 --> 36:26.813
equal distribution of money and wealth.

36:26.813 --> 36:29.813
No. This is superficial.

36:29.813 --> 36:36.813
Because wherever it is done people are not happy.

36:37.813 --> 36:41.813
They feel they have no freedom.

36:43.813 --> 36:46.813
Those people who have money are not happy

36:46.813 --> 36:51.813
because they have a demonic life.

36:51.813 --> 36:55.813
Where they are free they behave like devils.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.813
No sense of totality,

36:57.813 --> 37:00.813
no sense of collectivity.

37:00.813 --> 37:04.813
When they become like that,

37:08.813 --> 37:14.813
they even do not realise that they have become demonic.

37:14.813 --> 37:20.813
Everything becomes like a big martyrdom.

37:21.813 --> 37:23.813
They fight for lands,

37:23.813 --> 37:25.813
they fight for nations,

37:25.813 --> 37:29.813
they fight for rights.

37:29.813 --> 37:32.813
And they do all kinds of horrible things.

37:32.813 --> 37:39.813
Start destroying people, human beings.

37:39.813 --> 37:44.813
All the turmoil of today is the effect of

37:45.813 --> 37:47.813
mostly in the West,

37:47.813 --> 37:51.813
and also all the Arabic countries,

37:51.813 --> 37:55.813
I would say – is of the right side.

37:56.813 --> 38:02.813
And in the East, it is of the left side - the turmoils.

38:02.813 --> 38:07.813
It’s very surprising that

38:07.813 --> 38:09.813
it’s very contrasting also.

38:09.813 --> 38:11.813
It’s a funny dilemma for Me,

38:11.813 --> 38:14.813
I can’t understand it sometimes

38:14.813 --> 38:18.813
that where they are so particular about the chastity,

38:23.813 --> 38:30.813
they become when they are so much worried about chastity and everything,

38:30.813 --> 38:33.813
that they should have problem of the left side.

38:33.813 --> 38:36.813
They do puja, they have shraddha,

38:36.813 --> 38:38.813
they are like Catholics, we can say,

38:38.813 --> 38:39.813
are never rich people,

38:39.813 --> 38:44.813
seldom, except in Switzerland,

38:44.813 --> 38:46.813
I think, here everybody’s rich

38:47.813 --> 38:50.813
because they are so money-oriented.

38:53.813 --> 38:58.813
So, or the people where they are right sided,

39:00.813 --> 39:03.813
when they neglect their chastity,

39:05.813 --> 39:08.813
not bothered about the right side,

39:09.813 --> 39:13.813
they have the problems of the right side,

39:15.813 --> 39:17.813
is very surprising.

39:18.813 --> 39:23.813
The reason is where they look after the chastity part

39:24.813 --> 39:27.813
they go too much into it.

39:30.813 --> 39:35.813
Now, supposing a person is doing a puja.

39:37.813 --> 39:41.813
He just goes on doing puja, puja, puja morning till evening,

39:41.813 --> 39:43.813
without any activity.

39:43.813 --> 39:45.813
Very easy to do puja, isn’t it?

39:45.813 --> 39:47.813
Just come down,

39:47.813 --> 39:49.813
somebody does puja for you, get the vibrations,

39:49.813 --> 39:51.813
nicely blessed, go home.

39:51.813 --> 39:52.813
Nothing to be done,

39:53.813 --> 39:55.813
no activity.

39:56.813 --> 39:59.813
So there is no balance.

39:59.813 --> 40:04.813
So they do puja and they think, “Oh, they have done very well.”

40:04.813 --> 40:07.813
No, if you are a right sided person,

40:08.813 --> 40:10.813
then puja will help you,

40:10.813 --> 40:12.813
but not if you are a left sided person.

40:17.813 --> 40:19.813
Puja does help,

40:19.813 --> 40:21.813
of course, My Puja will help, no doubt,

40:21.813 --> 40:22.813
in both the sides,

40:22.813 --> 40:26.813
because I’m neither left nor right nor anywhere.

40:38.813 --> 40:42.813
So the puja part when they do …

40:42.813 --> 40:48.813
supposing a man is doing a puja to a Devi.

40:48.813 --> 40:54.813
In India they take a great courage to do puja to a Devi,

40:54.813 --> 40:55.813
you do not know that.

40:55.813 --> 40:57.813
Saptashati. That’s where we have

40:57.813 --> 40:59.813
that thing that the way people do,

40:59.813 --> 41:01.813
they get possessed,

41:01.813 --> 41:02.813
they can’t understand.

41:02.813 --> 41:05.813
First of all, they have a statue of someone

41:05.813 --> 41:07.813
made by some horrible fellow.

41:07.813 --> 41:10.813
When they will do the puja of that Goddess,

41:10.813 --> 41:12.813
they are God-fearing,

41:12.813 --> 41:14.813
everything is good,

41:14.813 --> 41:18.813
we have got temples where there are also,

41:18.813 --> 41:21.813
we can say, swayambhus

41:23.813 --> 41:25.813
from the Mother Earth,

41:25.813 --> 41:27.813
which are worshipped

41:27.813 --> 41:28.813
and should be all right,

41:28.813 --> 41:31.813
but no, they get possessed. Why?

41:32.813 --> 41:34.813
Because most of them,

41:34.813 --> 41:40.813
these temples are hounded by or haunted by spirits.

41:40.813 --> 41:43.813
Because they do all kinds of tantaric things there.

41:43.813 --> 41:46.813
And when people go and do the pujas there

41:46.813 --> 41:49.813
what happens to them?

41:49.813 --> 41:52.813
That they get attacked,

41:54.813 --> 41:56.813
they become more left sided.

41:58.813 --> 42:02.813
Now the Muslims and others who believe in a God

42:02.813 --> 42:03.813
which is neerakara,

42:03.813 --> 42:05.813
which is formless,

42:08.813 --> 42:10.813
they go to the right side.

42:10.813 --> 42:12.813
There’s formless God,

42:12.813 --> 42:14.813
it’s nice, formless everywhere is God,

42:14.813 --> 42:17.813
in Me, in you, everyone there is God,

42:17.813 --> 42:19.813
everybody’s God.

42:19.813 --> 42:22.813
Even if you are a devil, you are God.

42:23.813 --> 42:25.813
There’s nothing wrong with anyone,

42:25.813 --> 42:27.813
everybody’s God,

42:27.813 --> 42:29.813
starts on that principle.

42:32.813 --> 42:35.813
So they go onto supraconscious side

42:35.813 --> 42:38.813
and they become demonic.

42:41.813 --> 42:43.813
Then they must fight,

42:43.813 --> 42:44.813
because they are devils. Devils have to fight;

42:44.813 --> 42:47.813
otherwise, how will they exist?

42:49.813 --> 42:52.813
They fight, they aggress,

42:52.813 --> 42:54.813
they go to other countries,

42:55.813 --> 42:57.813
aggress them, capture them,

42:57.813 --> 43:00.813
all the time they are thinking of aggressing others.

43:00.813 --> 43:02.813
In a subtler way they aggress,

43:02.813 --> 43:05.813
nowadays the media is aggressive in the West.

43:07.813 --> 43:09.813
There are so many ways of aggression

43:09.813 --> 43:15.813
and to them aggression is something is very dharmic.

43:15.813 --> 43:17.813
For anything.

43:17.813 --> 43:20.813
They’ll ask direct questions,

43:20.813 --> 43:26.813
arrogant, insulting and cruel,

43:28.813 --> 43:29.813
they become cruel.

43:33.813 --> 43:35.813
That’s how the turmoil starts

43:35.813 --> 43:38.813
when we start using the power of Saraswati

43:38.813 --> 43:41.813
in a wrong way or the power of Mahakali.

43:47.813 --> 43:51.813
That’s why in Sahaja Yoga before the Puja

43:51.813 --> 43:53.813
we have to go into lot of activity.

43:53.813 --> 43:55.813
You have to decorate the hall,

43:55.813 --> 43:58.813
you have to get the flowers,

43:58.813 --> 44:01.813
you have to organize everything beautifully.

44:02.813 --> 44:05.813
Look at the roses, how beautiful they are.

44:05.813 --> 44:08.813
Then you starts balancing yourself

44:08.813 --> 44:11.813
with all these activities you do.

44:16.813 --> 44:19.813
And then you sit down for puja.

44:19.813 --> 44:22.813
That’s like in the daytime you work,

44:22.813 --> 44:23.813
in the night you sleep.

44:25.813 --> 44:28.813
To rest, to get the place: you must be active.

44:31.813 --> 44:33.813
Like they have to climb Himalayas

44:33.813 --> 44:36.813
to achieve meditation,

44:37.813 --> 44:39.813
because when you are tired,

44:39.813 --> 44:43.813
you can be restful afterwards.

44:43.813 --> 44:45.813
Otherwise, if you get somebody,

44:45.813 --> 44:47.813
say, from Switzerland only,

44:47.813 --> 44:53.813
the very speedy person for meditation,

44:53.813 --> 44:56.813
you’ll have to put the glue on him

44:57.813 --> 45:00.813
to settle down because he’ll be frantic, you know,

45:00.813 --> 45:04.813
all the time. Will be all the time jumping!

45:09.813 --> 45:16.813
So the activity has to come before the puja

45:18.813 --> 45:20.813
and the balance has to be established.

45:20.813 --> 45:23.813
So the ladies have to find out the saris

45:23.813 --> 45:25.813
and the blouses and this and that

45:25.813 --> 45:27.813
and they have to worry about putting the flowers,

45:27.813 --> 45:30.813
arranging things, this, that. Lot of activities!

45:32.813 --> 45:34.813
We have to travel.

45:34.813 --> 45:37.813
For English it was necessary to travel all the way from England,

45:37.813 --> 45:40.813
to arrange their money and rooms and everything to come here,

45:42.813 --> 45:47.813
to go to futuristic side, to think what they are going to pay,

45:47.813 --> 45:50.813
how they are going to pay back their loans!

45:54.813 --> 46:00.813
All this futuristic: planning they have to do before they come to Switzerland.

46:02.813 --> 46:09.813
Switzerland being the most active place, it’s better to have the puja here, so they are not so much active!

46:11.813 --> 46:14.813
That’s how the Devi arranges everything.

46:17.813 --> 46:21.813
So the ascent starts evolving.

46:23.813 --> 46:30.813
In that, the play of the Devi is the Navaratri – in your ascent – from ages.

46:30.813 --> 46:35.813
Navaratri: that’s why is the most important Puja.

46:36.813 --> 46:41.813
In Sahaja Yoga, Navaratri is the most important puja.

46:41.813 --> 46:48.813
Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahastrar Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realisation.

46:48.813 --> 46:53.813
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution

46:54.813 --> 47:02.813
you’ll find [that] Navaratri is the one which has brought you to Sahastrara.

47:02.813 --> 47:07.813
Without the help of the Devi at different stages of your ascent,

47:07.813 --> 47:13.813
you could not have been in a position to receive your Realisation.

47:13.813 --> 47:19.813
So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshipped

47:20.813 --> 47:28.813
and are used for thanking the Devi for what She did to bring you down here.

47:28.813 --> 47:29.813
So it’s like a thanksgiving.

47:30.813 --> 47:35.813
Without Her work nothing could have happened.

47:35.813 --> 47:39.813
So, when we read about the Devi, about Her incarnations:

47:39.813 --> 47:43.813
how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas,

47:43.813 --> 47:52.813
people who were trying to ascend, to cross this bhavasagara,

47:53.813 --> 47:56.813
how She worked hard,

47:56.813 --> 47:59.813
how she fought the devils,

47:59.813 --> 48:05.813
how She fought, She killed the demons single-handed,

48:06.813 --> 48:12.813
She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the bhavasagara.

48:13.813 --> 48:18.813
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma, but She is the one who brought you out.

48:18.813 --> 48:22.813
Even those who were dharmic could not do it because of the demonic pressure.

48:23.813 --> 48:29.813
She’s the One who fought single-handed with Her powers of destruction.

48:30.813 --> 48:33.813
In Her love for you She fought.

48:33.813 --> 48:35.813
She brought you to this level.

48:35.813 --> 48:40.813
And then She took a milder form of incarnation.

48:41.813 --> 48:44.813
Even during the time of all the gurus,

48:44.813 --> 48:54.813
She took the form of, as you know, Janaki was the daughter of Janaka,

48:54.813 --> 49:01.813
then Fatima was the daughter of Mohammed Sahib

49:01.813 --> 49:04.813
and Nanaki was the sister of Nanaka.

49:04.813 --> 49:17.813
In those forms, these Powers sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.

49:17.813 --> 49:24.813
And later on, or sometimes simultaneously,

49:26.813 --> 49:36.813
They incarnated in milder forms to help human beings to rise.

49:36.813 --> 49:39.813
So, today is the day of thanksgiving.

49:40.813 --> 49:44.813
As Guru Puja is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru,

49:44.813 --> 49:46.813
the One who has counselled you,

49:46.813 --> 49:50.813
the One who has told you about the Truth,

49:50.813 --> 49:57.813
the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realisation.

49:58.813 --> 50:03.813
And the Devi puja is a thanksgiving where, single-handed,

50:05.813 --> 50:09.813
just like a very loving mother, under Her sari,

50:09.813 --> 50:18.813
She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around,

50:19.813 --> 50:24.813
every sort of problems that existed

50:24.813 --> 50:31.813
and ultimately brought you into Sahastrara level and then gave you Realisation.

50:31.813 --> 50:35.813
It’s a real thanksgiving to the Mother.

50:37.813 --> 50:43.813
So, we can say Navaratri is like a Mother’s Day where you give thanksgiving to Her:

50:43.813 --> 50:50.813
which was just relentless, continuous working for Her children.

50:53.813 --> 50:59.813
Motherhood is much more important than the guruhood.

50:59.813 --> 51:05.813
Because guru is the one who trains you, makes you efficient.

51:05.813 --> 51:08.813
But the Mother forgives you,

51:08.813 --> 51:13.813
She loves you, She sustains you and She teaches you how to love.

51:13.813 --> 51:19.813
She has tremendous patience and tremendous, love and She does it single-handed.

51:19.813 --> 51:23.813
She doesn’t expect anything from you – absolutely selfless.

51:24.813 --> 51:31.813
'Selfless’ is a very small word I should say, it’s such an expansive compassion

51:31.813 --> 51:41.813
which engulfs everything that is wrong, dissolves it, digest it, absorbs it.

51:43.813 --> 51:48.813
So, it’s a very great day Navaratri is, for all the Sahaja Yogis,

51:48.813 --> 52:01.813
because then She took Her form as Sita, as the Power of Shri Rama, silent potential,

52:01.813 --> 52:07.813
suffering. How much She suffered! How much She suffered!

52:09.813 --> 52:12.813
Then She took the form of Radha.

52:13.813 --> 52:21.813
Then She came as five powers of Saraswati as the five wives of Shri Krishna.

52:23.813 --> 52:30.813
Then She came as Mary: that was the greatest suffering, I think, to see the Son being crucified.

52:30.813 --> 52:36.813
The suffering, silent, patient suffering, She had to go through it.

52:37.813 --> 52:40.813
All that drama, to be seen, was too much.

52:40.813 --> 52:46.813
She went through all that because you all had to cross your Agya Chakra.

52:46.813 --> 52:48.813
She had to sacrifice Her Child.

52:48.813 --> 52:52.813
It’s easy for a father to do that, very difficult for a mother.

52:53.813 --> 52:59.813
Now you are all mothers, so many of you, you will know what it is to have a child

52:59.813 --> 53:02.813
and how one feels about it.

53:05.813 --> 53:07.813
After doing that,

53:07.813 --> 53:13.813
She comes to the state where you have to give your Realisation.

53:13.813 --> 53:17.113
Is a work of tremendous patience, as you know.

53:17.113 --> 53:20.813
It’s tremendous patience and understanding.

53:20.813 --> 53:28.813
Human beings, as the time advanced, have evolved no doubt for Realisation,

53:28.813 --> 53:34.813
but also evolved to very funny, stupid, crooked nonsensical ways.

53:34.813 --> 53:40.813
It’s impossible to understand how they go about with their stupid ideas

53:40.813 --> 53:42.813
and how troublesome they can be!

53:42.813 --> 53:47.813
They can be very crooked, funny, troublesome

53:47.813 --> 53:53.813
to such an extent that sometimes even it is difficult to forgive.

53:55.813 --> 54:01.813
Despite that so many of you are here today, in Europe,

54:01.813 --> 54:07.813
in the land of the Guru, here I find, who have got Realisation.

54:07.813 --> 54:14.813
So, the Mother’s pride, Mother’s joy knows no bounds,no doubt about it.

54:14.813 --> 54:17.813
It’s such a great thing to see Her children

54:17.813 --> 54:23.813
sitting here to receive all the powers from Her.

54:24.813 --> 54:28.813
Now, again, when we are in this situation,

54:28.813 --> 54:34.813
we have to know the first principle with which the whole thing started:

54:34.813 --> 54:38.813
that it is the power of love.

54:41.813 --> 54:47.813
It is the power of love that has brought you to this state

54:47.813 --> 54:53.813
and it’s the power of love that you will express and manifest; you will evolve.

54:55.813 --> 55:02.813
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga also the temptations become subtler and subtler.

55:02.813 --> 55:10.813
We try to do Sahaj Yog, we try to spread Sahaja Yoga, sometimes for the powers .

55:10.813 --> 55:13.813
Maybe you are lonely, so you want to have more Sahaja Yogis.

55:13.813 --> 55:19.813
Maybe you do it because you think that, that’s how you spread your powers.

55:19.813 --> 55:24.813
Even there are problems on leadership I find, ego problems there are.

55:24.813 --> 55:28.813
Somebody’s appointed a leader then another feels bad, this, that all goes on.

55:28.813 --> 55:33.813
I see the drama going on. Like small children they fight. What is this leadership?

55:33.813 --> 55:37.813
Is just artificial! It’s not even noted in any newspaper!

55:43.813 --> 55:48.813
As they have mock governments we have a mock leadership.

55:50.813 --> 55:54.813
So, then people fight for that – this becomes subtler.

55:54.813 --> 55:57.813
The power struggle goes on becoming subtler and subtler.

56:00.813 --> 56:06.813
Then again money problems come up. Some people think that

56:06.813 --> 56:09.813
Sahaja Yoga is a very big way of making money.

56:09.813 --> 56:13.813
Or some people think that, “We can get lot of money, because

56:13.813 --> 56:18.813
Mother blesses people with money, affluence, so let us be in Sahaja Yoga,”

56:18.813 --> 56:20.813
but don’t spend a single pai, you see,

56:20.813 --> 56:27.813
just manage it. No! It’s not like that. It’s the other way round!

56:30.813 --> 56:33.813
It’s again the another dilemma is there that,

56:33.813 --> 56:43.813
in India which is a place of poverty compare to all of you, everyone donates money.

56:43.813 --> 56:49.813
All the trustees in every centre wherever there are trustees,

56:49.813 --> 56:54.813
have to donate at least five thousand rupees to become the trustees.

56:54.813 --> 56:58.813
Of course, I don’t get anything out of it,

56:58.813 --> 57:02.713
but I must have donated I don’t know how many how much Myself

57:02.713 --> 57:05.813
to become the Trustee of Sahaja Yogis!

57:07.113 --> 57:10.113
But you have to donate.

57:13.113 --> 57:19.113
And when you become miserly again that means, again, it’s the same thing going on.

57:21.113 --> 57:26.113
You have bank balances, but the source is finished and you have nothing left.

57:27.113 --> 57:31.113
The bank balance should be with God.

57:31.113 --> 57:36.113
Then He gives you interest more than the capital.

57:36.113 --> 57:39.113
Is there any bank which does that?

57:42.113 --> 57:46.113
At least not the Swiss Bank!

57:48.113 --> 57:51.113
You have to pay for keeping money with them.

57:55.113 --> 58:04.113
That’s how it is. You should tap . Always try to go to the source.

58:07.113 --> 58:12.113
This becomes subtler and subtler in the sense

58:12.113 --> 58:16.113
that people think that now their children are realized souls.

58:17.113 --> 58:21.113
All right, so what? They are not Gods, are they?

58:21.113 --> 58:26.113
They get so involved with their children, I mean, this is another stupidity women fall into.

58:28.113 --> 58:31.113
But to them their child is so important,

58:31.113 --> 58:33.113
they get so adhered to the child.

58:33.113 --> 58:38.113
I mean, first they used to neglect the children, now they become so attached to their children

58:38.113 --> 58:42.113
that they look like glued people all the time.

58:44.113 --> 58:49.113
And such children cannot grow properly unless and until you give them freedom.

58:50.113 --> 58:53.113
Give them full freedom to grow.

58:53.113 --> 59:02.113
But guidance, of course, that they are majestic people, meaning Sahaja Yogis,

59:02.113 --> 59:07.113
they are born realised as a Sahaja Yogi, as a good Sahaja Yogi how they should behave.

59:07.113 --> 59:12.113
Have a rapport, talk to them, tell them about it, how they be.

59:12.113 --> 59:17.113
Develop that self-respect within them that they should be like this.

59:17.113 --> 59:19.113
Not to glue them to you.

59:23.113 --> 59:27.113
That’s not the way. Children will never grow properly, even physically,

59:27.113 --> 59:29.113
if you glue them to yourself.

59:31.113 --> 59:36.113
In the West now I see new ideas coming up that the children must be glued to the mother.

59:37.113 --> 59:42.113
This is from one extreme to another extreme.They’ll become very left-sided.

59:42.113 --> 59:47.113
Even if they’ll be grown up in age they won’t grow up in their brains.

59:47.113 --> 59:51.113
They won’t grow up in their behaviour if they are glued with the mother.

59:52.113 --> 59:56.113
If they cry for a while, little bit, doesn’t matter,

59:56.113 --> 01:00:00.113
but the children must be made to sleep away from the mother.

01:00:00.113 --> 01:00:05.113
All the time you should not carry your children in your lap. There is no need at all.

01:00:06.113 --> 01:00:12.113
But this is not that the child wants, is the mother who wants this kind of a thing.

01:00:14.113 --> 01:00:21.113
And some fathers also I have seen glue down to their children

01:00:22.113 --> 01:00:29.113
and then they say, “Mother, my child is spoiled, he’s like this, like that.”

01:00:29.113 --> 01:00:34.113
Such children will get possessed very fast if you make the children dependant on you.

01:00:34.113 --> 01:00:37.113
Very fast they’ll become possessed.

01:00:37.113 --> 01:00:41.113
If you make them over-independent, “You are on your own”,

01:00:41.113 --> 01:00:44.113
like the other side was that when we were in Oxted

01:00:44.113 --> 01:00:49.113
a girl of seven years used to come and give us newspapers.

01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:52.113
And she was a daughter of a lord!

01:00:52.113 --> 01:00:57.113
At about five o’clock in the morning, in that cold she used to climb up all the way

01:00:57.113 --> 01:01:01.113
on a bicycle delivering those newspapers.

01:01:01.113 --> 01:01:04.113
And when I told her mother, “What are you doing? It’s very dangerous,

01:01:04.113 --> 01:01:07.113
this child is in danger, she is a girl, how can you do that to her?”

01:01:07.113 --> 01:01:10.113
she said, “No, no, she has to be on her own.”

01:01:12.113 --> 01:01:18.113
So, the one side is to be on her own and another side is to glue them,

01:01:18.113 --> 01:01:23.113
is again the same subtle attitude of possessiveness. It’s possessiveness,

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:29.113
"This is my child, I must look after the child, the child is self-realised soul, this, that.”

01:01:29.113 --> 01:01:35.113
Only your child is not realised soul, everybody’s child is the realised soul in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:35.113 --> 01:01:38.113
How much do you do for other’s children?

01:01:38.113 --> 01:01:41.113
Or only you look after your own child?

01:01:43.113 --> 01:01:47.113
The custom should be: if you buy one thing for your child,

01:01:47.113 --> 01:01:51.113
buy two more things for another child.

01:01:51.113 --> 01:01:56.113
Buy better things for another child and less things for your child.

01:02:01.113 --> 01:02:04.113
Let your child share his things with others.

01:02:05.113 --> 01:02:09.113
At the time when you are buying something, buy something that he can share.

01:02:09.113 --> 01:02:11.113
Teach him how to share.

01:02:11.113 --> 01:02:17.113
Because though they are realised souls, with the mothers and the fathers like this

01:02:17.113 --> 01:02:22.113
they’ll become again the same miserly old-style people:

01:02:24.113 --> 01:02:30.113
quarrelsome, fighting, beating each other, troubling each other.

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:32.113
So be careful .

01:02:32.113 --> 01:02:43.113
Being realised-souls, you will be surprised, they will be extremely, extremely convenient for you.

01:02:43.113 --> 01:02:46.113
Give them to other Sahaja Yogis to handle, depend on them,

01:02:46.113 --> 01:02:48.113
let them look after.

01:02:48.113 --> 01:02:55.113
And the homogeneous feeling comes through children. Children are the ones who bind each other.

01:02:55.113 --> 01:02:59.113
But, “Don’t touch my child! This is my child!”

01:02:59.113 --> 01:03:02.113
you close the door as soon as somebody comes in.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:07.113
That’s you are going back in the same way as your mothers have been.

01:03:08.113 --> 01:03:11.113
There’s no war on in Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:12.113 --> 01:03:16.113
We are in the government of God.

01:03:17.113 --> 01:03:20.113
This realisation has to come.

01:03:20.113 --> 01:03:25.113
There is no need to seek all these useless things, these pleasures of life.

01:03:26.113 --> 01:03:31.113
Understand your responsibility

01:03:31.113 --> 01:03:37.113
that you are Sahaja Yogis first and last and, in the middle

01:03:39.113 --> 01:03:43.113
and as Sahaja Yogis what is your duty?

01:03:43.113 --> 01:03:49.113
Is to be completely dedicated for the betterment and the benevolence of others.

01:03:51.113 --> 01:03:55.113
That’s the only thing which is going to nourish you to rise.

01:03:55.113 --> 01:03:59.113
If you look after your children like this, like mad, it’s not going to help you .

01:03:59.113 --> 01:04:01.113
You’ll have problems.

01:04:01.113 --> 01:04:04.113
If you neglect your children, you will have problems.

01:04:07.113 --> 01:04:14.113
So come in the centre and be just witnesses of all that.

01:04:18.113 --> 01:04:24.113
It’s a very common failing in the beginning of every Sahaja Yogi who comes to Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:24.113 --> 01:04:30.113
They’ll send me the list of five generations on this side and five generations on this side

01:04:30.113 --> 01:04:41.113
"my fathers, brothers, sisters, this thing, that thing, real cousins, real this thing is sick.

01:04:41.113 --> 01:04:44.113
So please, Mother, put Your attention.”

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:48.113
And when I put my attention, the attention returns back, I can’t find that.

01:04:50.113 --> 01:04:56.113
It starts like that to begin with. Alright, in the beginning I say, “Alright, just now they have entered.”

01:04:56.113 --> 01:05:00.113
"But you don’t know", these are tentacles which keep you down,

01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:06.113
they do not allow you to rise in the domain of God.

01:05:06.113 --> 01:05:12.113
In the domain of God everything that is yours, even your hair,

01:05:12.113 --> 01:05:15.113
are looked after by God Almighty.

01:05:15.113 --> 01:05:21.113
Every thing! Can you understand that? Can you realise that?

01:05:21.113 --> 01:05:32.113
Is all done by billions and billions and billions of powers of Adi Shakti.

01:05:37.113 --> 01:05:43.113
What can you do yourself? Nothing! Except for worrying and troubling.

01:05:43.113 --> 01:05:52.113
So just if you believe and assume that power today

01:05:52.113 --> 01:05:56.113
that you are in the domain of God,

01:05:57.113 --> 01:06:01.113
which is active benevolence,

01:06:01.113 --> 01:06:06.113
the nature of it is active benevolence

01:06:07.113 --> 01:06:09.113
as we say ‘hita’  (हित).

01:06:14.113 --> 01:06:18.113
If you are sick, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:18.113 --> 01:06:21.113
If you are alright, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:21.113 --> 01:06:27.113
If you have money, it is for your benevolence. If you don’t have money, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:31.113 --> 01:06:36.113
Everything does good for you in the domain of God.

01:06:36.113 --> 01:06:43.113
Do not judge it according to your own standards.

01:06:43.113 --> 01:06:50.113
Whom do you think to be a person who is benevolent in this world apart from Me?

01:06:52.113 --> 01:06:54.113
Really, in the real sense of the word?

01:06:55.113 --> 01:06:59.113
Supposing you take a man who is very rich;

01:06:59.113 --> 01:07:01.113
is he benevolent?

01:07:02.113 --> 01:07:08.113
No. Is he happy? No. Is he respected? No.

01:07:12.113 --> 01:07:18.113
At least he has to be a realised soul to be somewhere near that description.

01:07:20.113 --> 01:07:24.113
And if you have to ascend in the domain of God,

01:07:24.113 --> 01:07:28.113
you have to know that everything works through His power:

01:07:28.113 --> 01:07:37.113
your activity, your inactivity, your sleep, everything is worked through His powers of love.

01:07:37.113 --> 01:07:42.113
Love can never harm, can never destroy.

01:07:42.113 --> 01:07:45.113
You go a little ahead with it

01:07:48.113 --> 01:07:54.113
and it showers flowers upon you.

01:07:56.113 --> 01:08:03.113
But understand your nature: supposing you are a left-sided person.

01:08:03.113 --> 01:08:07.113
Mostly I’ve seen left sided persons always want to do my pujas.

01:08:07.113 --> 01:08:12.113
And the right-sided person are organising. Do the other way round.

01:08:12.113 --> 01:08:20.113
must know your nature, give yourself a balance, and then enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:08:20.113 --> 01:08:25.113
Like you entering into a door, say for example,

01:08:25.113 --> 01:08:28.113
and you have too much load on your back,

01:08:28.113 --> 01:08:30.113
meaning you are a left-sided person.

01:08:30.113 --> 01:08:37.113
Then take down the load from your back on your head and enter in.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:44.113
But if you have too much on your head, put it on your back and enter in.

01:08:44.113 --> 01:08:47.113
Because you’re tired. You do it every day.

01:08:47.113 --> 01:08:51.113
Supposing this hand is tired, you put it on the left hand.

01:08:51.113 --> 01:08:56.113
I see in aeroplane when people are walking, they are holding it in one hand

01:08:56.113 --> 01:09:00.113
and automatically when it is tired, they put it to the left – automatically.

01:09:00.113 --> 01:09:02.113
They are not Sahaja Yogis!

01:09:03.113 --> 01:09:09.113
In the same way in life also, if you have done one-sidedness too much,

01:09:09.113 --> 01:09:14.113
try to do the other side and give yourself a balance.

01:09:16.113 --> 01:09:21.113
Navaratri is the day to give you the balance.

01:09:22.113 --> 01:09:29.113
Those whose right hand is tired will get the power in the left hand.

01:09:29.113 --> 01:09:38.113
Those who have the left hand tired will get the power on the right hand to share the load.

01:09:39.113 --> 01:09:47.113
So those who are having money problems will solve their money problems.

01:09:48.113 --> 01:09:54.113
And those who have sleeping problems will solve their sleeping problems.

01:09:54.113 --> 01:09:59.113
But one can say if somebody has both, then what do they do?

01:09:59.113 --> 01:10:05.113
I know of somebody, I lived there, in that country

01:10:05.113 --> 01:10:10.113
where they have both the problems, they sleep as well as they have no money, and they are not bothered!

01:10:25.113 --> 01:10:28.113
So, for such people what should we do?

01:10:28.113 --> 01:10:33.113
Of course, I won’t tell you, but one has to do something about it!

01:10:40.113 --> 01:10:43.113
One has to work out something.

01:10:46.113 --> 01:10:48.113
They just don’t move

01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:54.113
and if you tell them, answer is, “I know. I know I sleep a lot;

01:10:54.113 --> 01:10:58.113
I know I’m like this. I know. I know.”

01:10:58.113 --> 01:11:01.113
That’s all. Then what do you say?

01:11:01.113 --> 01:11:07.113
It stops you completely. You can’t go further. If they know, what more to be told?

01:11:11.113 --> 01:11:21.113
This is a complete mountain there standing just to finish you completely.

01:11:30.113 --> 01:11:33.113
So, one has to do.

01:11:35.113 --> 01:11:37.113
Everyone has to do something.

01:11:37.113 --> 01:11:39.113
Somebody is working it out,

01:11:39.113 --> 01:11:42.913
somebody is doing some work,

01:11:42.913 --> 01:11:44.913
and another is not helping.

01:11:44.913 --> 01:11:51.913
Then that cannot be completed, it’s a collective work, you cannot! One person cannot do it.

01:11:52.913 --> 01:11:57.913
I’ve seen it happens like this. It’s a collective work.

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:03.913
So, we come to the position that Navaratri today is not the work of Mother only,

01:12:03.913 --> 01:12:07.913
which She did so far, is the work of every one of you.

01:12:08.913 --> 01:12:10.913
I cannot do it single-handed.

01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:15.913
If I could, there was no need for you to be here,

01:12:15.913 --> 01:12:20.913
I would have built the aeroplane, put you there, pushed them some or other, lock it up and put you there.

01:12:20.913 --> 01:12:22.913
It’s not possible.

01:12:23.913 --> 01:12:26.913
You all have to carry your own aeroplanes.

01:12:26.913 --> 01:12:30.913
Build it up and carry it yourself with dignity,

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:33.913
not like small children. So, you have to mature.

01:12:34.913 --> 01:12:39.913
And for that maturity it’s a collective thing that has to take place.

01:12:39.913 --> 01:12:43.913
In the beginning in the school, alright, they’ll teach you two plus two is equal to four.

01:12:43.913 --> 01:12:47.913
But when you go to the college, you have to do it yourself,

01:12:48.913 --> 01:12:51.913
solve the problem yourself.

01:12:51.913 --> 01:12:59.913
And that’s what it is today. Sahaja Yoga is good, you get your Realisation in these modern times,

01:12:59.913 --> 01:13:03.913
but the maturity has to take place,

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:05.913
otherwise useless.

01:13:05.913 --> 01:13:13.913
Up to the seed it was alright, but once it is sprouted it must become the tree, otherwise it’s useless.

01:13:14.913 --> 01:13:17.913
And that all of you have to do together,

01:13:17.913 --> 01:13:20.913
helping each other, understanding each other.

01:13:20.913 --> 01:13:24.913
And everyone has to work it out.

01:13:24.913 --> 01:13:27.913
Even if one person suffers, I suffer.

01:13:32.913 --> 01:13:36.913
The whole thing has become collective.

01:13:38.913 --> 01:13:41.913
The Devi has become collective.

01:13:43.913 --> 01:13:46.913
It’s a venture.

01:13:48.913 --> 01:13:53.913
It’s a venture, I know, too much of it. There was no other way out.

01:13:53.913 --> 01:14:01.913
It’s like crucifixion of every part of Your body, every cell of Your body.

01:14:04.913 --> 01:14:06.913
But it’s alright.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:13.913
So today, instead of feeling guilty,

01:14:13.913 --> 01:14:19.913
you should be filled with tremendous courage and tremendous enthusiasm:

01:14:19.913 --> 01:14:24.913
that we have to do it, because Mother has given us the power.

01:14:24.913 --> 01:14:27.913
We can do it; nothing should keep us down.

01:14:28.913 --> 01:14:30.913
And we are going to help each other.

01:14:30.913 --> 01:14:36.913
One person is doing one job, nobody will look at it, you see, they won’t just move!

01:14:36.913 --> 01:14:41.913
"I know, I’m sitting down, I know. I don’t do anything I know.”

01:14:45.913 --> 01:14:48.913
And in Sahaja Yoga, it has become even subtler,

01:14:48.913 --> 01:14:52.913
"I want to do but there’s a bhoot in me which doesn’t allow me to do it.”

01:14:54.913 --> 01:14:56.913
So, you get out with your bhoot!

01:14:57.913 --> 01:14:59.913
That’s what it is.

01:15:01.913 --> 01:15:11.913
All these arguments are stupid, of no value in Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:11.913 --> 01:15:15.913
That means you have not understood the meaning of Sahaja Yoga,

01:15:15.913 --> 01:15:21.913
you have not understood the meaning of yourself, and you have no respect for your life.

01:15:21.913 --> 01:15:22.913
That’s what it is.

01:15:22.913 --> 01:15:26.913
If you indulge into such thinking, then it is no good.

01:15:26.913 --> 01:15:31.913
But today you have to promise to yourself and to me within your heart

01:15:32.913 --> 01:15:37.913
that you are going to be filled with that enthusiasm and that shakti.

01:15:39.913 --> 01:15:42.913
The time has come.

01:15:48.913 --> 01:15:53.913
Which is going to make you real yogis.

01:15:56.913 --> 01:15:58.913
Complete dedication.

01:15:58.913 --> 01:16:04.913
Imagine these PLO people what they are doing, fearlessly.

01:16:04.913 --> 01:16:06.913
I mean, all kinds of people you see around you

01:16:06.913 --> 01:16:09.913
even in Kali Yuga are so dedicated to something nonsensical.

01:16:09.913 --> 01:16:13.913
Why can’t we be dedicated to something so sensible?

01:16:17.913 --> 01:16:20.913
They are not afraid of anything,

01:16:20.913 --> 01:16:23.913
they are dare devils.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.913
Why can’t we become like that?

01:16:26.913 --> 01:16:29.913
What’s wrong with us?

01:16:30.913 --> 01:16:37.913
So every one of us must have that enthusiasm and “I’m an institution by myself.

01:16:37.913 --> 01:16:42.913
And I’m going to do it, I’m not going to take advantage of the ashram life,

01:16:42.913 --> 01:16:46.913
nicely settled down in the ashram. You see very good, cheap.”

01:16:46.913 --> 01:16:50.913
No! We are all going to move out also

01:16:50.913 --> 01:16:53.913
and take up a place somewhere else.

01:16:53.913 --> 01:16:55.913
For the time being ashram is alright.

01:16:55.913 --> 01:16:58.913
But then give more room to others who are coming.

01:16:58.913 --> 01:17:02.913
You get out of it. Go out and stay somewhere and work it out.

01:17:04.913 --> 01:17:08.913
Then in the ashram, “This is my house, I have spent money for this,

01:17:08.913 --> 01:17:12.913
this is my furniture, this is this thing, that thing.”

01:17:15.913 --> 01:17:23.913
Actually, you should know how to live on a string, shoestring, as they say, on a shoestring.

01:17:23.913 --> 01:17:29.913
Of course, now I’m feeling that every ashram has such a lot of furniture that they had to [UNCLEAR bring].

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:33.913
Better live on a shoestring.

01:17:33.913 --> 01:17:39.913
So the tapasya starts.

01:17:39.913 --> 01:17:42.913
Go into a penance yourself.

01:17:42.913 --> 01:17:47.913
But then I will hear, “Mother, I’m on a tapasya, I’m eating only once.”

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:52.913
Why? Who ask you to be on tapasya? Enjoy! Enjoy your tapasya!

01:17:52.913 --> 01:17:55.913
Then it is Sahaja, otherwise: nonsense.

01:17:55.913 --> 01:17:59.913
Enjoy. If you can enjoy your tapasya then you are sahaj;

01:17:59.913 --> 01:18:03.913
With enthusiasm. Look at these PLOs,

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:07.913
look at these people,

01:18:09.913 --> 01:18:15.913
do they say, "We are going in a tapasya”? Nothing.

01:18:16.913 --> 01:18:19.913
You have examples of people around you.

01:18:20.913 --> 01:18:23.913
But we can’t say  they are possessed by bhoots.

01:18:23.913 --> 01:18:29.913
Or even if they are what about you? You better get possessed by sahaj bhoots for a change!

01:18:31.913 --> 01:18:35.913
If that’s the way, only, you can be motivated.

01:18:41.913 --> 01:18:47.913
So, tell your mind, “No explanations, nothing doing. I am going to show my worth!”

01:18:55.913 --> 01:19:00.913
But all the time if the attention is just to show off

01:19:00.913 --> 01:19:04.913
or to be in my attention

01:19:05.913 --> 01:19:12.913
or to be in contact with me, to be writing to me or something, is not going to help at all.

01:19:17.913 --> 01:19:23.913
I am just a mirror, and you see within myself yourself, in the true way.

01:19:23.913 --> 01:19:29.913
And also, this mirror, is full of maya.

01:19:29.913 --> 01:19:39.913
So, a devil may look into this mirror and may look like a saint to him.

01:19:39.913 --> 01:19:43.913
If he has ego, he might look like a saint to himself.

01:19:45.913 --> 01:19:56.913
Or if he is a left-sided person he might think he is the incarnation of Bhairava – he might.

01:20:00.913 --> 01:20:10.913
But if he is truthful, he can see clearly that he is the highest of highest, he's a sahaja yogi

01:20:10.913 --> 01:20:16.913
And unless and until you see yourself like that, know that it’s a maya.

01:20:21.913 --> 01:20:28.913
So, to realise that you have achieved a lot by getting your Realisation,

01:20:28.913 --> 01:20:32.913
of rising so much higher above all these petty ideas.

01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:37.913
Every idea is petty, whether it is economics, politics, philosophy,

01:20:37.913 --> 01:20:41.913
any ism, anything is all petty for a Sahaja Yogi,

01:20:44.913 --> 01:20:50.913
because none of them know even this much about God’s domain.

01:20:50.913 --> 01:20:53.913
What are they talking about is economics!

01:20:57.913 --> 01:21:00.913
They do not know anything about His politics.

01:21:02.913 --> 01:21:07.913
They do not know anything that there is a miraculous power

01:21:07.913 --> 01:21:10.913
which rules the whole Universe,

01:21:11.913 --> 01:21:16.913
and which is so efficient. Which never fails.

01:21:17.913 --> 01:21:23.913
So timely, so sensible, so interesting, dramatic.

01:21:23.913 --> 01:21:28.913
See how we reserved all these things in no time.

01:21:28.913 --> 01:21:33.913
How we got to this place. I was to have this puja here.

01:21:33.913 --> 01:21:36.913
All this you know. How I came here.

01:21:36.913 --> 01:21:41.913
See the miracle working. How the powers of the Divine are working.

01:21:41.913 --> 01:21:43.913
You be the proper instrument of the Divine.

01:21:43.913 --> 01:21:46.913
And it has another force as I told you

01:21:46.913 --> 01:21:50.913
centripetal and centrifugal – and you might be thrown out.

01:21:52.913 --> 01:21:58.913
So be careful on that point. Face yourself in truthfulness!

01:21:58.913 --> 01:22:02.913
Do not get pampered by your ego or morosed  by your superego!

01:22:02.913 --> 01:22:07.913
Just see for yourself as a powerful instrument of love.

01:22:07.913 --> 01:22:10.913
But in love you do not become indiscrete.

01:22:12.913 --> 01:22:20.913
Steadily, beautifully, gently you attend to it.

01:22:22.913 --> 01:22:28.913
And so much power can be born.

01:22:28.913 --> 01:22:33.913
You will be amazed that water, which looks something so frivolous to us,

01:22:33.913 --> 01:22:36.913
has so much power in it.

01:22:37.913 --> 01:22:39.913
You know about hydrostatics.

01:22:42.913 --> 01:22:46.913
This Mother Earth which looks so simple:

01:22:46.913 --> 01:22:51.913
We walk on Her on our feet. She attracts us on ourself.

01:22:51.913 --> 01:22:54.913
She’s spinning with such a speed Herself,

01:22:54.913 --> 01:22:56.913
She keeps us sticking on to Her.

01:22:57.913 --> 01:23:02.913
She’s doing thousands and thousands of tremendous jobs,

01:23:02.913 --> 01:23:06.913
this great Mother Earth She looks so simple.

01:23:06.913 --> 01:23:14.913
She’s so powerful. In the same way you are made out of this Ganesha Tattwa which is so tremendous.

01:23:18.913 --> 01:23:22.913
This Navaratri should give you that power,

01:23:23.113 --> 01:23:28.913
those nine powers of nine chakras.

01:23:28.913 --> 01:23:33.913
Seven chakras: you already know.

01:23:33.913 --> 01:23:38.913
Above that you become the master yourself,

01:23:39.913 --> 01:23:44.913
and then you become the Power yourself.

01:23:52.913 --> 01:23:54.913
May God bless you!
