1
00:00:00,277 --> 00:00:04,879
...like a birthday of Shiva, you can say
or something, “How can it be?”,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,225
because He is eternal, He is all the time
there.

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:14,455
So what demarcates today’s
celebration,

4
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:19,936
is the establishment of Shiva on this
earth.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:32,162
In the material self. Every matter has
been created with a deity

6
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:37,862
and that deity is established in that
matter, as you know.

7
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:47,801
So when it was thought by Adi Shakti

8
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:52,462
that first we must establish Shiva; without
Shiva you cannot establish anything.

9
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:56,243
First He is to be established, because
He is the absolute.

10
00:00:56,444 --> 00:01:00,657
So you have to establish Shiva.

11
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:05,833
And now what should we do?
How to establish Him?

12
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:11,351
He is the God of Tamo Guna.

13
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:20,002
He is the cold, He is the God of all
that is not active.

14
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:31,878
So first of all, this earth, when it
receded from the sun, which was very hot,

15
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:39,442
was taken very near to the moon. The moon
is the brother-in-law of Shiva.

16
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:48,864
So it was taken so close to moon that
the whole earth got covered with ice.

17
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:55,583
And it was then gradually moved towards
the sun.

18
00:01:55,784 --> 00:02:04,554
When it was moved towards the sun,
gradually, then it started melting.

19
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:08,832
And the point that did not melt at all

20
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:12,782
was the point where Shiva was to be
established.

21
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:21,167
That was predestined, that spot, and
that spot is the Kailash.

22
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:26,457
The ice never melts there and if you see

23
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:30,241
the whole mountain is like the face
of Shiva –

24
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:35,000
the eyes, the nose and everything you can
see clearly getting out –

25
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:41,749
and all the year round, it keeps its shape
as it is.

26
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,792
That is how Shiva was created.

27
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:56,869
And He was placed in a witness state,

28
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:05,609
as the spectator of all that happens
on this earth,

29
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:08,936
facing towards the Kundalini of
the universe,

30
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:13,739
which they were going to place in India.

31
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,359
So He is facing towards the south.

32
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:25,256
He is looking at the south with both
the hands like this,

33
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:32,955
like a spectator watching the spectacle
of the Adi Kundalini.

34
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:38,457
That is how Shiva was created.

35
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:49,513
So, though we say that the heart
of the universe is England,

36
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:59,386
still Shiva resides on top of
the Sahasrara: this is the seat.

37
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:06,467
Like you have got the seat of Shiva on top
of your head,

38
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:14,818
but He resides in your heart, in the same
way Shiva belongs to this place

39
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:20,154
and He looks at the whole body from that,
this point -

40
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:28,197
so the Feet are the south, this
(Sahasrara) is the north,

41
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:36,166
this is the east, I'm sorry, west (right
arm), and this is the east (left arm).

42
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:43,476
That is how we can see the whole map of
the universe, of the world that is created.

43
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:49,964
So now… [(Hindi) You can just sit.
Yogi: Sit down.

44
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,108
Shri Mataji: Sit down, sit down. Don’t
stand up.

45
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:56,199
Listen to My lecture. Now don’t take
photographs.

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,407
You must listen to My lecture attentively.

47
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:11,954
In a meditative way you must listen to Me.
You must make full use of Me, isn’t it?

48
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,756
You should be meditative. Then you can hear
Me very clearly, you don’t have to bother.

49
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:25,071
You have to be meditative.]
Yogi: So, this is south.

50
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:34,185
Shri Mataji: So you are facing towards
the south as a witness.

51
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:41,298
Just now, somebody told Me that
in the south people put their head

52
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:47,128
towards the south and put their feet
towards the north, I mean, imagine.

53
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:50,919
The feet are put towards Shiva, who is
in the north.

54
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,684
Kailasha is in the north, isn’t it? It is
not in the south.

55
00:05:55,885 --> 00:06:01,161
So why put your feet towards the north?
I mean, one must use logic.

56
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:06,196
These brahmins have told you all these
stories and you are doing just the opposite

57
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,911
that should not be done.

58
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:12,329
Sometimes I feel, “God save this country
from brahmins.”

59
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,782
They’re everywhere now: they’re our rulers,
they’re everywhere,

60
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,774
and they have no idea what Brahma is.

61
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:23,854
If they are real Brahmins, I’m sure
one day,

62
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:29,895
the real Brahmins will be in charge
of this country.

63
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:38,410
So now, when we understand

64
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:42,632
that Shiva is the first thing that is
established in the matter,

65
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:47,680
then in us also first the Shiva is
established.

66
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:53,399
When the foetus takes its form,

67
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,618
the throb in the heart is the establishment
of Shiva.

68
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:03,922
That is the sign that Shiva has been
established.

69
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:13,581
In case of people

70
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:20,621
who are born with bad heart or with
troubles,

71
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,039
one has to say that Shiva is not fully
established.

72
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,808
Not that they are bad people, but they are
not supposed to live for long,

73
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,669
and have to have another heart later on
maybe,

74
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,560
or that there might be some sort of
a problem in their previous lives,

75
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:45,255
and if they pay attention to Shiva tattwa,
their heart can be cured.

76
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:51,297
So the most important organ in the body
is the heart.

77
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:55,460
If the heart fails, you cannot remain
on this earth.

78
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,488
So the most important thing is to look
after

79
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:05,065
your Shiva principle which is the Atma.

80
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:10,114
We are worried about every sort of mundane
thing.

81
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:14,588
Worried about this, worried about that,

82
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:21,370
but we are not worried about our Spirit.

83
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:25,071
This is the biggest problem with us.

84
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:30,515
If you worry about your Spirit, if you pay
attention to your Spirit,

85
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:37,617
the whole universe then vibrates with
Parabrahma, which is nothing but joy.

86
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:46,519
So without, without any attention
to Spirit,

87
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,646
if we think we can enjoy life, you cannot.

88
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:53,828
You cannot enjoy your life if you pay
attention

89
00:08:54,029 --> 00:09:01,507
to other nonsensical things and you do not
pay attention to your Spirit.

90
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:07,658
The complete silence comes into us only
through Spirit.

91
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:13,238
If the Spirit is awakened within us, this
silence starts working

92
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:20,296
and you feel extremely relaxed and
absolutely one with your Self.

93
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:27,126
There is no problem, you don’t seek other
things that normally people seek -

94
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:33,843
you seek your own company and you want
to be some time with yourself.

95
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:38,522
Only thing that you seek after finding
your Spirit

96
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:44,727
is the company of other Sahaja Yogis who
also have found the Spirit,

97
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:50,455
so there is a rapport established between
Spirits, that is in the heart.

98
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:55,711
And this Spirit is the universal being
within us, about which I have told you

99
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:58,330
that once you become one with the Spirit,

100
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,310
you automatically become universally
conscious.

101
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:06,835
There are so many qualities of the Shiva,
Shiva tattwa,

102
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:12,318
of the principle of Shiva, that I need not
tell you, but today I will tell you

103
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,450
another dimension, which I have not touched
so far, about Shiva tattwa.

104
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:22,975
The physical aspect of Shiva tattwa is

105
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:30,503
that such a person is a more a cold type
of a person.

106
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:41,279
In the sense, that such a person is not
a person who gives hot vibrations,

107
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:49,193
but who has too much of it (cold)
sometimes, not in balance, overdoes it,

108
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:56,978
develops a kind of a temperament which
can be extremely cold.

109
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:02,128
Could be low blood pressure with it,
could be diarrhea also,

110
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:07,769
diarrhea also one can get with too much
of spiritual strength.

111
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:14,069
And also could be on the love side because
of the left side.

112
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:21,779
Because left side is the kapha as you call
it, is kapha is the phlegm that is more.

113
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,127
Because the left side is more, such
a person is always apt to catch colds

114
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:33,288
and has problems of the colds.

115
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:36,116
So such a person has to protect oneself

116
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:39,404
from getting into colds and things
like that,

117
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:44,297
and the methods to be employed are to be
learnt through Sahaja Yoga.

118
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:53,728
But to give it a balance, the Spirit itself
is beyond health problems.

119
00:11:53,929 --> 00:12:00,241
But the left-sided person who always thinks
of the Spirit, also can become one-sided.

120
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:04,371
When he has to live on this earth, he has
to be a balanced person.

121
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:09,331
So he has to take to another side and
that side is the activity

122
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:16,255
of the spiritual growth within himself.
A person who is very spiritually developed

123
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:20,550
cannot exist as a Shiva tattwa on this
earth.

124
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:24,441
He has to exist as a balanced personality.

125
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:28,611
And when he starts developing that
balancing within himself,

126
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:35,383
the Spirit from his heart starts rising
and goes on top of his head.

127
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:39,478
So this is the second stage where
one has to go.

128
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,908
Here is the whole collectivity.

129
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:50,630
So when you start taking your love
and affection

130
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,954
into your central nervous system, you can
say, and put it on top of your head,

131
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:02,144
that means, as soon as you put it
in your Virat,

132
00:13:02,345 --> 00:13:06,283
when it starts spreading through
your Virata shakti,

133
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:12,102
through your collective being, then only
you are a complete personality.

134
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:15,879
Otherwise, you are Shiva tattwa –
Shiva tattwa exists

135
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,240
whether this universe exists or not.

136
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:25,579
It exists even when the whole universe
is existing;

137
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:33,219
even, even it vanishes, it all goes into
that magnet, into that Shiva tattwa.

138
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,602
So a person who has a spiritual hankering
must know

139
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:45,040
that to raise your Shiva above the heart
level,

140
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:53,550
he has to raise it gradually onto a very
detached method

141
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:58,761
of existing on top of the Sahasrara,

142
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:04,076
where there is a complete balance,
complete balance.

143
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:10,655
Many people I have seen in Sahaja Yoga are
extremely loving, nice, very sweet persons.

144
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:14,788
Like in Delhi, I would say, people are not
so harsh as in Bombay.

145
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:19,470
Bombay people could be harsh, Puna people
are little harsher also.

146
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:24,440
But Bombay and Puna people are deeper.

147
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:31,006
The reason is they have balanced themselves
a little,

148
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:35,673
and they have gone above their heart
feelings, like sympathies, you see.

149
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:40,341
“Don’t be unkind to somebody, don’t say
anything harsh to somebody,”

150
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:43,008
can be very, very funny also sometimes.

151
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:50,738
Like yesterday, I was sleeping in the place
where you always sleep.

152
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:55,182
Now if I was in any Bombay or Puna center,
anywhere,

153
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:58,594
you can’t hear any voice, anywhere,
nothing.

154
00:14:58,795 --> 00:15:06,179
Like a lion, you see, like a tiger is in
a forest, nobody will hear your voice.

155
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,109
If there’s a tiger,

156
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,135
you can know for miles together there’s
tiger somewhere, it’s so silent.

157
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:17,144
But if I’m in Delhi, then everybody’s
talking:

158
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:21,259
somebody was talking about money, this,
that, the whole kind of jabbering was [on],

159
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,099
even the Sahaja Yogis from foreign had
become Delhi Sahaja Yogis.

160
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,954
They were all talking so much, I was
surprised.

161
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:30,821
How did they take to this talking so much
there?

162
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,811
All were talking, jabber, jabber.
On the contrary, if I’m sleeping there,

163
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:39,081
you all should have been in meditation,
sitting down and doing meditation.

164
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:43,714
Instead of that, everyone was busy with
all the possible nonsensical talks,

165
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:47,901
as if they have no other chance to talk.

166
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:51,793
And they were all jabbering, jab, jab,
jab, jab; I didn’t know what to say

167
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:55,678
and I just, I didn’t know what to do.
That's what.

168
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:02,154
But this is what one has to know, that
unless and until you raise

169
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:06,246
your sympathetic attitudes – like you tell
somebody something,

170
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:11,732
“I have had such a problem in this
business”, say example like this.

171
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,987
I mean, what a topic, but doesn’t matter.

172
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:17,073
If you start, “I had a problem with this”,
another will:

173
00:16:17,274 --> 00:16:20,839
“Yes, I too had…”, you see, the sympathies.

174
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,569
“I too had such a problem, these people
are so bad,

175
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,964
that happened, he had the same problem”,
same talk.

176
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:33,177
They are all, you see, talking about things
which are irrelevant to Sahaja Yoga.

177
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:37,588
Even relevant to Sahaja Yoga you should
not talk when I’m there.

178
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,824
I have to make a humble request to all
of you –

179
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:44,150
that the way you people sometimes behave
is not good

180
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:49,290
and is not congenial to Sahaja Yoga.

181
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:53,826
Even to keep your mouth open in My front
is not a good thing.

182
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:56,912
But I don’t want to tell you in such
details,

183
00:16:57,113 --> 00:17:01,789
but it is so many things are there that
you have to learn

184
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,323
before you raise your Shiva tattwa
from your heart.

185
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:10,140
You are good at pleasing people,
at organizing you are excellent,

186
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:13,236
you organize very well, there are
no quarrels.

187
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:19,340
Sahaja Yogis in Bombay quarrel quite a lot
and even Puna Sahaja Yogis are quarrelsome.

188
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,828
But I must say, Puna Sahaja Yogis are
very deep,

189
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:27,370
and Bombay Sahaja Yogis are very deep
individually, they have achieved something.

190
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:32,098
Now they have to go further than that,
is to go little bit in the heart again.

191
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,397
This is the second descent they have
to have to feel more that way,

192
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:41,311
they are very, very strict with people.

193
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:45,489
But you see, certain amount of strictness
is to be accepted.

194
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,995
For example, if somebody is told, “Don’t
touch Mother’s feet”, one feels very bad.

195
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,144
But this is a very mundane sort of
an understanding of the Mother.

196
00:17:56,345 --> 00:18:00,191
If She says, “Don’t touch My feet”, that’s
what you are supposed to do.

197
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:06,576
You have to do exactly what will please Me,
and not what will please you.

198
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:10,560
So you must change your attention from
pleasing all the public.

199
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:14,849
Some people say, “Those who come first
time, Mother, we must not say this”.

200
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,029
You must! Certain things you must say
to them.

201
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:28,628
Otherwise, you will make Me a-prasanna;
that will cause problems!

202
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:32,622
But when you say to others, you need not go
like Puna and Bombay people

203
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:38,351
in their special Marathi language, but
say it in a proper Urdu style,

204
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:42,541
that people don’t feel bad, but you must
say it!

205
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:45,435
You should not put those people on My head;

206
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:49,740
instead of that, you should tell them
in such a way that people are all right.

207
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:52,934
So to go deeper into you,
you must do also

208
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:57,423
individual meditation and samuhik
(collective).

209
00:18:57,624 --> 00:19:00,787
I would not say all the Sahaja Yogis
in Delhi are like that,

210
00:19:00,988 --> 00:19:05,091
but… we are very good at organizing,

211
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:10,484
which our Bombay Sahaja Yogis and these
Puna Sahaja Yogis must learn.

212
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:13,939
They quarrel among themselves and I really
get fed up.

213
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,040
And they treat each other shabbily, that
I don’t like.

214
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,211
But individually they are all right,
so they become individualistic.

215
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:30,446
Some people become individualistic and some
people become publicist, publicist,

216
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,560
you see, they’ll please the public, now
they are two extremes.

217
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:40,368
What should a Sahaja Yogi do? They have
to become Mother addicts.

218
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:44,823
They should do what your Mother likes.

219
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:51,682
Do you understand? Need not please the
public or need not please the individual,

220
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:55,546
but do what your Mother will like.
That’s a very simple thing

221
00:19:55,747 --> 00:20:01,139
which Adi Shankaracharya has told you,
that just keep the Mother pleased.

222
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,747
But nobody makes that study.

223
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:07,646
Try to make the study, “What makes
Mother pleased?”

224
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:16,915
Then you will see, I’m very easily pleased,
you see, as a Shiva tattwa.

225
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:22,739
Even if you make mistakes, thrice you pull
your ears, it's all right.

226
00:20:24,968 --> 00:20:28,630
But don't go too far with it.

227
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:32,400
You see, the mistakes you commit is
all right,

228
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:36,679
but don’t take it for granted that you can
go on committing mistakes.

229
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,516
Because you really get a big rope, but you
will hang yourself ultimately, isn’t it?

230
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:44,601
So be afraid of the rope also which is
given to you,

231
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:47,610
it will hang you much better, otherwise.

232
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:52,472
So one has to understand that you should
not be addicted to public opinion

233
00:20:52,673 --> 00:20:57,151
or to the opinion of your own. Both things
are wrong.

234
00:20:57,352 --> 00:21:02,333
You must behave in such a manner that it
should please all the deities within Me.

235
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:07,546
As far as I am concerned, I don't exist,
I have no existence.

236
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:12,907
Really, believe Me, I have no existence
at all, I just...

237
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:18,578
It's an assemblage of so many existences,
you can say.

238
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,722
Otherwise, I don’t exist, I don’t find
Myself anywhere in this body, anywhere;

239
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:25,183
I don’t find Myself anywhere
in the universe.

240
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:32,187
I’m nowhere, I sometimes find, “What is all
this? Is not Mine, is all foreign to Me.”

241
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:41,464
But still, I permeate into it, enjoy it,
live with it,

242
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:45,907
but I’m not in it, nowhere.

243
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:51,090
So if you just try to understand what
pleases your Mother,

244
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:55,305
you will develop your dignity because I
want you to be dignified;

245
00:21:55,506 --> 00:21:59,230
it will develop your joy because I want you
to be joyous;

246
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:09,914
it will give you more capacity to achieve
more vibrations within yourself

247
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:13,411
because that is what I’m giving.

248
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:19,054
Whatever is good for you, if you do that,
it will please Me.

249
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,540
But what I think is good for you, you may
not think;

250
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:27,184
you may have your own ideas,
individualistic again

251
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:30,012
or maybe public-wise.

252
00:22:30,213 --> 00:22:33,838
Like I’ve told you that, “Please, don’t
arrange My program

253
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:39,055
before 7 o’clock in the evening.” Then you
may say, “It won’t suit our public.”

254
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:43,789
Doesn’t matter: it doesn’t suit Me, that’s
the main point.

255
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,563
Because I have certain timings when only
I can really be very good.

256
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:52,980
That time I have to give to somebody else,
is fixed!

257
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:56,786
So you don’t fix My timings according
to yours.

258
00:22:56,987 --> 00:23:00,639
Morning time before 11 o’clock no programs
should be fixed.

259
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,945
Early in the morning if you fix,
fix at five, I don’t mind.

260
00:23:05,146 --> 00:23:09,776
I have certain timings which I have to use
for some other purpose.

261
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:15,009
So you have to understand that whatever
suits Me should be done,

262
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:21,628
because that is for your good also, because
there are most beneficial.

263
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:27,583
I’m just telling you My own tricks so that
you take more advantage of Me.

264
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:32,492
But they insist on that the people who are
going to the office won’t be able to come -

265
00:23:32,693 --> 00:23:36,334
such people should not come at all!

266
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:42,415
If there is a picture at 7 o’clock,
they’ll go at that picture or not?

267
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:46,918
Then why should you make your Mother
so cheap

268
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,669
that it should suit their convenience?

269
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,074
Iif there are few people, it is even better
for us:

270
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:58,831
we’ll have better accommodation
in the Kingdom of God.

271
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:04,784
So don't make Me cheap! That one should
understand, not to cheapen Me,

272
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:09,468
keeping the dignity of your Mother.
Whatever is to be achieved, I agree,

273
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:14,163
that all the brothers and sisters must be
helped, all the public must be helped,

274
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:18,354
but we can’t get rid of the kachras
(rubbish), otherwise, you see.

275
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:21,772
There are lots of things which are to be
just thrown away.

276
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:25,538
So we don’t, should not worry about
the kachra part.

277
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:28,084
Whatever is the best we’ll have,

278
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:32,020
but to have that also one should not speak
harshly.

279
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,992
Again I will say not to use harsh words.

280
00:24:35,193 --> 00:24:38,990
The way people, “Get out, get out, get
out!”, like that one should not talk.

281
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:42,293
Change your language. You must educate
yourself

282
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:47,262
how to talk to people in a soft way,
in a proper way.

283
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:51,860
That is very important for Sahaja Yoga,
because if you go on insulting,

284
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:56,737
maybe you might insult some saint!
So you should not do in that way.

285
00:24:56,938 --> 00:25:05,809
Understand it, and try to make your
individual being so capable that,

286
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,901
when you go to the public, you are able
to put the right perspective,

287
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:23,494
the right concept, the right conduct, the
right behavior, and the right knowledge.

288
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:29,540
Here I do not mean right rationally,
right which is absolute.

289
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:35,481
The Shiva is the absolute, He is the giver
of absolute knowledge,

290
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:38,423
He knows what pleases Me.

291
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:47,992
The moment something will happen that will
really displease Me, He will shut the show.

292
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:52,233
He is just watching this to please Me.

293
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:57,308
The moment he’ll find that this is not
working out, He’ll stop the whole show

294
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:01,381
and He'll say, “Shut it, finished”.

295
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:07,032
So though I may say the spectator is Shiva,
but He is just the judge,

296
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:10,768
and He sees those things, so try to be
all right.

297
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:16,942
A nice spectacle I try to make to please
Shiva so He continues to be there,

298
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:20,775
and this let [let this?] universe be a nice
place for staying,

299
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:29,092
in which you rise and attain that eternal
life which is promised to you.

300
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,565
But one has to understand what pleases
Mother.

301
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:40,437
Some people have a habit of just looking
at Me straight all the time:

302
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:42,938
it’s not the way to be done!

303
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:50,176
Put your eyes down, all the time just you
cannot stare at Me, it’s stupid!

304
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:53,279
Apart from stupidity, it will not please
Me.

305
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,892
Will it please you if I start staring
at you all the time?

306
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:02,453
I don’t stare at you, I try to please you
by doing all kinds of things:

307
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,788
why don’t you learn something from Me,
how I try to please you?

308
00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:11,653
You can’t do all these things of course,
I know, because somebody says, “Mother,

309
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:15,078
we went there, a horse was given to us,
this, that.”

310
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,793
This side you cannot achieve yourself
for Me, isn't it?

311
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:23,559
If I have a difficulty, you can’t solve
My difficulty, isn’t it?

312
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,671
But I can solve your difficulties; so I can
please you very easily

313
00:27:26,872 --> 00:27:29,129
because I have so many methods of pleasing
you.

314
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,716
For whatever methods are there, by which
one should not positively displease,

315
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:36,934
that’s the only thing is. You don’t do
anything special,

316
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:40,696
but don’t do something extraordinary
just to displease.

317
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:44,814
If you understand this simple thing,
that don’t try to do anything

318
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:49,877
that will displease, you please Me,
It is so simple.

319
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:56,501
You don’t have to do anything extra,
just try to be

320
00:27:56,702 --> 00:28:03,830
loving, affectionate, dignified, and I’ll
be very happy with all that.

321
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:07,301
As it is I’m overjoyed, I’m very happy
with you.

322
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,849
But I have to tell you what one has
to achieve,

323
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,079
and how one has to go above these things.

324
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:23,644
So it is necessary now for Delhi people
to rise from the heart to the Sahasrara.

325
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:30,705
And it is necessary for Bombay and Puna
people to go from heart to the…

326
00:28:30,906 --> 00:28:36,856
go from the Sahasrara to the heart.

327
00:28:37,064 --> 00:28:44,707
I would say, Rahuri people are in between.
Rahuri people are in between.

328
00:28:44,908 --> 00:28:49,968
They are very good organizers, and they
don’t create problems for Me,

329
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:52,603
as far as individuals are concerned.

330
00:28:52,804 --> 00:28:58,443
So I think, Rahuri is a place, perhaps
maybe it is My Mecca,

331
00:28:58,644 --> 00:29:03,258
that it is so good, whatever it is.
But we all can be like that.

332
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:10,584
We all can change and inform each other
and improve and educate ourselves.

333
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:14,656
All this education can come to us, if we
really love ourselves,

334
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:16,964
and care for our evolution.

335
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:21,279
We don’t have to bother about it much,
if we really care for it.

336
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,768
Gradually, all these things will work out
and the balance can be established.

337
00:29:27,969 --> 00:29:33,101
Those people who talk too much, should not
talk so much.

338
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:37,160
What I feel that when you talk too much,
when you stop, you just stop.

339
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:40,954
It is in between: when it is necessary
you must talk,

340
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:44,836
when it is not necessary you should
not talk.

341
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:50,281
So that kind of personality gradually
you can develop with Sahaja Yoga,

342
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:57,722
that you will develop that wisdom how far
to go, how far not to go.

343
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:00,987
Not to go is the quality of Shiva.

344
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:07,089
He doesn’t do anything, He is just sitting
down there and watching the whole joke.

345
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:14,270
He doesn’t do anything, but still, He’s
the one who has to watch:

346
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:19,912
if He doesn’t watch, then the whole show
is over.

347
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:27,720
If you understand that in not doing
anything, how much He’s doing!

348
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:31,130
See the contrast: He’s doing nothing
as such.

349
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:35,359
But He’s making everybody dance,
to please Him.

350
00:30:36,232 --> 00:30:40,167
In the same way, in one shot you have
both the natures:

351
00:30:40,368 --> 00:30:46,197
as Sahaja Yogis you can achieve that kind
of a balanced personality.

352
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:53,217
It is for your good, for your evolution,
for your development.

353
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:57,532
So today, all of you have a great chance
of evolving

354
00:30:57,733 --> 00:31:01,181
individually within yourself the Shiva
tattwa,

355
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:08,259
which ultimately permeates into the whole.

356
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:14,138
Kabira has said it in a beautiful couplet,
I don’t know if you people have understood,

357
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:18,785
which is: (Hindi) “Man mamta ko
Thir kar launga”.

358
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:25,429
"The compassion of my heart I will vibrate,
I will bring it out;

359
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:32,145
the compassion of my heart I will vibrate,
I’ll bring it out;

360
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:37,867
“Aur paancho tattwa milaunga”,
and put it into the five elements."

361
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:40,571
See Kabira, do you follow him how great
he is?

362
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:42,760
People talk of Kabir Das, see, he says
that,

363
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:48,224
“Take it out of the heart and put it into
all the five elements.”

364
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,245
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

365
00:31:51,446 --> 00:31:56,290
If you understand that, then you don’t have
to understand anything else.

366
00:31:56,491 --> 00:32:00,290
You have got it in your heart, become
the capitalist in your heart,

367
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:03,324
and become a communist outside.

368
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,568
If you can achieve this balance properly,
you have done it.

369
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:14,967
And we can do it, we all of us put together
we will do it, we can achieve it;

370
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:18,719
and we can show to the world that
everyone can achieve it.

371
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:25,000
All ordinary human beings so-called will,
can become extraordinary.

372
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:29,703
So today, we have to decide about ourselves
that we are going to do it,

373
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:35,737
 we are going to be educated about it,
in a spiritual way, in a Sahaja way.

374
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:39,131
And every moment if you watch yourself,
you can do it.

375
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,814
And not to explain yourself, or to say,
“Oh, this happened to me,

376
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:44,952
that happened to me”; that’s not the point.

377
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:48,041
Many people tell Me like that, that’s
absurd.

378
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,294
You challenge yourself: How can it
happen to you?

379
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:53,311
Why don’t you do it? You should do it.
Why can’t you do it?

380
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:57,115
Like that you take yourself to task and you
can work it out, I’m sure,

381
00:32:57,316 --> 00:33:00,684
because you have got the power with you.

382
00:33:01,837 --> 00:33:08,723
I bless you all for your spiritual
development

383
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:18,449
and for your collectivity. Both things
must be looked after.

384
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,081
If you have spiritual development and
no collectivity, it is useless.

385
00:33:23,312 --> 00:33:29,230
If you have collectivity and spiritual
development none, it is useless.

386
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:31,526
Combine it properly.

387
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:39,757
So we have to take Shiva and establish Him
into the Virat.

388
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:44,332
This is what we have to do, and if you
understand this point,

389
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:47,322
your relationships with others also will be
good,

390
00:33:47,523 --> 00:33:51,078
permanent, of a very substantial nature.

391
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:57,810
And the quality of Sahaja Yogis’ life will
be something very, very great.

392
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:01,011
May God bless you all.
