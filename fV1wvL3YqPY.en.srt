1
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:29,480
I 

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:46,610
have to 
tell 

3
00:00:46,610 --> 00:01:34,539
you thank you very much for this celebration,
for all these beautiful balloons; but, looking

4
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:51,719
at these balloons, we have to 
also see some of them who have lost their

5
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,600
air completely.

6
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,890
This is another problem we face in the West
because to have ego itself, according to the

7
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,640
Western culture, is a very great achievement.

8
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:14,300
And when we start living with our ego I know
how one looks like.

9
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,310
He really looks like a stupid fellow.

10
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:28,440
When he talks, when he describes himself,
you don't know where to look because just

11
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,220
feel like laughing at his stupidity.

12
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,500
Ego is the outcome of stupidity.

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:48,280
I don't know what to say; how to give a simile
to ego, because it's just bloated and makes

14
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:56,971
you float in the air, and when it bursts you
are down on the earth.

15
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:02,520
But you are not down on the earth the way
Sahaja Yogis should be down to earth; but

16
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,840
you are completely finished.

17
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,920
All your arrogance goes to waste.

18
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,950
You can never understand Sahaja Yoga if you
have this ego in your head.

19
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,210
I have known people who have this ego.

20
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:25,250
They have come to Sahaja Yoga and still they
want to think that they know more than anybody

21
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,320
else.

22
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:37,180
To know about yourself you have to go deep
down, and to go deep down you have to give

23
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:44,140
up all this idea which makes you float in
the air.

24
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,950
Imagine if you have a big balloon attached
to you.

25
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,940
How can you go deep down into the sea?

26
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,540
You cannot.

27
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:07,950
That kind of a air which makes you float in
the air, absolutely in an area of stupidity,

28
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:16,180
what else -I mean English you will think there
are no words- stupidity means everything.

29
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,880
Then you may think no end of yourself.

30
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,370
You may think whatever you like, you can behave
the way you like and all that but what do

31
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,130
you achieve?

32
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,420
You achieve nothing out of it.

33
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,639
Whatever you achieve people are jealous of
you.

34
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,640
They want to harm you.

35
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,690
You have no friends.

36
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,979
Nobody cares for you, and in Sahaja Yoga people
know who has got this problem.

37
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:55,449
So, I've seen people when they start talking
they say, “Ah!

38
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,969
We know, we know him.”

39
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:05,400
Once I had an experience, long, long time
back in Pune where the people who were owning

40
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:14,419
that wada said that we cannot have Shri Mataji's
program because She is not a Brahmin.

41
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,770
So the Sahaja Yogis said, all right we'll
give it in the newspaper because She is not

42
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,880
a Brahmin we cannot have a program.

43
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:31,009
So, these people came to My program and the
owner of that was sitting on the gallery on

44
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,009
top.

45
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,039
He couldn't even walk.

46
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,759
He was suffering from some sort of a funny
disease.

47
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,160
So these people suddenly start.

48
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
I didn't know.

49
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
They didn't tell Me anything.

50
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,039
They didn't tell Me that these people have
protested or whatever it is.

51
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:53,340
So they all started shaking like this, like
this, like this.

52
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,199
I said, “What is this?”

53
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,490
So I said, “What is it?”

54
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,990
They said “Mother, stop it.

55
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,430
We know You are Shakti but stop it.

56
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,110
It's too much, too much.”

57
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,789
“But what did you do?”

58
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:11,800
They said, “We didn't do anything.

59
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,800
We just said this is a Brahmin's thing and
a Brahmin's wada, and this area is mostly

60
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,439
resided by Brahmins, so we thought that You
cannot have your program.”

61
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,720
I said, “Really, that's all ?”

62
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,250
“Yes, yes, that's all.

63
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,560
But it's, you see on the other side, you see
those people?

64
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,160
They are also shaking with Your power.”

65
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,210
So I asked them, “Who are you?

66
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,439
Are you also Brahmins ?”

67
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,680
They said, "No, no.

68
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,879
We are certified mad people from Thana.”

69
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,720
“And how are you here?”

70
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
They said, “There was one fellow who was
mad was cured by You.”

71
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
“Really?”

72
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,370
“So our superintendent is here.

73
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,680
He has brought us here.

74
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,330
We are certified mad.

75
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,330
Certified.”

76
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,779
My goodness, these people looked at Me.

77
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,860
I said, “See now, you tally.

78
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,860
You are shaking and they are shaking.

79
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,080
Now you tally.

80
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,910
Where are you?”

81
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,910
And they all became Sahaja Yogis.

82
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,259
Not only that but the gentleman sitting upstairs
I told him, "You get up and come down."

83
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,710
He came
and since that day he has surrendered his

84
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,120
life and did a lot of work in Pune.

85
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,970
So what I'm saying that anybody who talks
like that; that “This is wrong, in Sahaja

86
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,979
Yoga, this should not happen, we should not
have paid so much, or this leader is not good”;

87
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:53,830
should take a paper, thin paper, on his hand,
and put it before the photograph.

88
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,699
If you can stop the shaking then you are all
right.

89
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:07,210
All of you can try this.

90
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,210
Then try on the right hand.

91
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,210
Very practical.

92
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:18,350
If the paper is shaking that means Mr. Ego
is shaking, and you know how to treat your

93
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,780
ego in Sahaja Yoga, thanks to Mohammed Sahib.

94
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,849
He has told us how to treat it.

95
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,599
Now these two problems are within us.

96
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:38,909
One of them is our conditioning and another
is this ego business, and we make our mind

97
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:46,279
out of that and we are playing under the governance
of these two things which we have used to

98
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,750
make this mind.

99
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,990
Now you have to be careful.

100
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,139
You find out with left hand.

101
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,139
Now let's see.

102
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,610
If the left hand is shaking then you are conditioned.

103
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,600
If the right hand is shaking then you are
egoistical.

104
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,410
So now you treat it.

105
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,660
You treat these two things.

106
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,790
Before Me you'll get vibrations all right
because you see I am your Mother.

107
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,950
All right.

108
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,880
But that doesn't mean you are all right.

109
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,850
You try on My photograph; that's much more
sharp.

110
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,890
So being Mother you know I play around.

111
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:27,060
I think, I don't know what I should say, but
maybe you may not feel that way.

112
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,149
But before the photograph you put on the left
hand side a newspaper or a little paper or

113
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:34,259
a thin paper.

114
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:37,120
On the right hand side another paper.

115
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,130
One by one you try and judge yourself, what
are you?

116
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:48,670
After all you have not come here in Sahaja
Yoga to emancipate Me.

117
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:55,910
You have come here to evolve yourself and
because of that you have to face yourself

118
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:03,730
and see for yourself what is within you which
is very strong, which is troublesome, which

119
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,470
is dragging you down, which is killing.

120
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:16,050
Sahaja Yoga is nothing but Ocean of Joy.

121
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,509
I thought that in My absence you'll be all
enjoying it all right; you do.

122
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:29,690
Airport I have seen sometimes I am late because
of the plane, about four hours, five hours,

123
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,769
and everybody is so fresh, and so nice early
in the morning.

124
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:34,769
I said, “What's happened ?”

125
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,759
“The whole night we have been enjoying Mother.”

126
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:44,569
So what you enjoy in that is collectivity:
Sangat That collectivity you should enjoy

127
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:51,260
only by getting rid of your nonsensical boundaries
that you have built, and then you see the

128
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,260
joy.

129
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:59,949
All the time you'll be floating in joy.

130
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:06,860
There is a sense which people have which you
may not have before realization.

131
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:14,440
Some of the people, I was amazed how deep
they are, how they took to Sahaja Yoga.

132
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Supposed to be very great men.

133
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,000
Supposed to be people of very great principles
but very hot-tempered, intolerant about people,

134
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,050
and they take to Sahaja Yoga just like this
because inside there's a big depth, so that

135
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,319
everything is absorbed without any problem.

136
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:44,819
Everybody can achieve but one has to be careful
as to the two wheels of our mind.

137
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:50,270
One is the ego, another is the conditioning.

138
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,930
All kinds of conditionings are there, especially
in India.

139
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,759
In the West it is all kinds of egos you know,
different, different types.

140
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:06,254
I have seen so many types and varieties of
egos, I was surprised; to face that.

141
00:12:06,254 --> 00:12:07,959
I didn't know what to say.

142
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:15,339
It's a very, very subtle thing which people
have carved out of their minds.

143
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:24,200
So for you today it is to be decided that
you are only still small children, and like

144
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:35,819
small children you must have a very clean
heart to accept, to absorb the beauty of peace

145
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:42,930
that is within you; and also the beauty of
purity.

146
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,360
Without purity you cannot enjoy anything.

147
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:57,399
So in Sahaja Yoga though we have so many people
I must say the purity of these few saints,

148
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:04,420
who lived earlier, we have to yet achieve.

149
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,480
For example, yesterday they were singing about
Ali.

150
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,930
I was so very happy because He was an Incarnation.

151
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,670
And His purity people are singing now; not
at that time.

152
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,410
He was killed at that time, He was tortured.

153
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,260
That always they do.

154
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,740
Then we have many others.

155
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,820
We have here Dam Dam Sahib.

156
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,620
See what a great thing to come to.

157
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,140
We have here Nizamuddin Auliya.

158
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:40,930
We have so many people in our country itself
that nobody, no other country can claim.

159
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,660
They have one, say in England they have William
Blake or this and that.

160
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,839
We had so many people.

161
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:48,839
Why?

162
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:56,379
Not because we were very good people, but
because we were to be improved.

163
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:59,199
Things had to be done.

164
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,199
So they were born.

165
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:08,459
Though this is a Yoga Bhoomi anywhere you
go in India, I was surprised, in Haryana so

166
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:14,620
many great saints lived there.

167
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,910
But they were all tortured, troubled, never
understood.

168
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:27,029
It was so painful and hurts you how this stupid,
ignorant, blind people tortured them.

169
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:34,480
So now it is our duty of Sahaja Yogis to,
first of all, find out who is a saint.

170
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,040
Even among Sahaja Yogis, as I described in
Hindi language, there are people who try to

171
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,790
trouble, trouble others.

172
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:54,120
If you have no recognition and understanding
of what is the truth, what is love, what is

173
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,209
pure compassion, then you are not a Sahaja
Yogi.

174
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:03,120
It's like an obtuse angle you see, you have.

175
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,870
You look at a person with an obtuse angle
you don't see anything, one-sided.

176
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:20,470
Now, at this juncture when I am so very old
now; I have to request that you turn your

177
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,940
eyes to yourself.

178
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Introspect.

179
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:31,230
Because among you there are some people who
will try to divert your attention, will try

180
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,889
to say things.

181
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:38,360
Very easy to say, “He is very dishonest,
he is very immoral”; very easy to say.

182
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,990
What are you?

183
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:50,970
We have to now understand that Sahaja Yoga
is to be consolidated through synthesis.

184
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,480
We are believers of synthesis.

185
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,089
Any divisive thing that comes into your mind
you should just throw it away.

186
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:04,460
This is a request on this day I make you - that
you please introspect.

187
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,140
Unless and until you introspect you cannot
even respect yourself.

188
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,690
You cannot even love yourself.

189
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,779
If you love yourself you will introspect and
find out what's wrong.

190
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:25,240
Supposing I love this sari, then if I find
any doubt about it or see any dot somewhere

191
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,769
or something I'll get it cleaned.

192
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:32,319
I'll not be proud of it, wear it and go round
saying, “Ah!

193
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:36,249
See I've got so many spots.”

194
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:46,540
In the same way, you should be not proud of
whatever asahaj temperaments you have within

195
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,610
yourself.

196
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,899
And don't talk like that.

197
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,949
Christ has called them 'murmuring souls'.

198
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:57,660
He said, “Beware of the murmuring souls”.

199
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,360
I would say: "Throw away all the murmuring
souls".

200
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,920
That's the only way.

201
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,780
In Hindi as they say 'bakwas’; their name
is bakwas; means the ones who just chatter,

202
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,480
chatter, chatter; talk all nonsense about
others.

203
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,079
He doesn't know what he is.

204
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,699
It is much more in India, I must confess.

205
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,789
I'm sorry, though I'm an Indian.

206
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:32,960
It is a habit of talking ill of others, sitting
down just chit-chatting.

207
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,429
They will not talk of Sahaja Yoga.

208
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,450
How many people know Sahaja Yoga in the proper
way?

209
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,980
I mean if I have to give degrees, what degrees
I should give to you?

210
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,080
Tell Me.

211
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,020
You don't know even about your vibrations.

212
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:56,940
Of course you are Sahaja Yogis because you
have fallen into this trap of achieving evolution.

213
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,419
But how many are really grown up into it?

214
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:02,610
You can.

215
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:08,870
So I have to again and again tell you, to
make Me happy, you have to give up all these

216
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:17,740
nonsensical, cheapish talks; but try to understand
from each other what we know of Sahaja Yoga.

217
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:30,130
Discuss it and contribute to this knowledge
by describing your experiences of Sahaja Yoga.

218
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,570
There are many who do it.

219
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,429
I am not saying they don't do.

220
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:39,360
But even there's one bad fellow he can spoil
all of them; like one bad apple can spoil

221
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,820
all the apples.

222
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,370
So what do we do -throw away the apple out
of the basket.

223
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:58,580
It is important see, even I feel all this,
standing like a witness to you, silent witness.

224
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:12,950
When I see big, big mountains, and I think
they are like great saints who are watching,

225
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:22,500
and they are trying to record what is happening
in this world because they also understand.

226
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,710
They also know.

227
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:34,890
I have to again, and again, tell you that
today is the day to see your own self, your

228
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,070
own chakras, your own - I should say - defects.

229
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:48,440
That will give you permanently the joy that
is promised.

230
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,830
You will get thoughtless awareness.

231
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,220
Also you'll get doubtless awareness.

232
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:05,020
But never get into the trap of your conditioning
and of your ego.

233
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:11,549
This is what I have to tell you today, on
this day where you are celebrating, that you

234
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,710
celebrate your own birthday.

235
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,570
Celebrate it.

236
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,600
See for yourself what you have achieved and
what you are going to achieve.

237
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,279
It's time for you to celebrate than to celebrate
My birthday.

238
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,900
I'll be very happy to celebrate your birthday
than to celebrate Mine.

239
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
So may God bless you.

240
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Today, I was thinking, that we had given a
nice chance to children to come up.

241
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
But all the leaders are also My children.

242
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
So they should come here on the stage and
can say Atharva Sheersha.

243
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Not the children which are really children,
in the real sense of the word, but those who

244
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
have become child-like.

245
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
All such people should come up and say Arthava
Sheersha, We all should say Atharva Sheersha.

246
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
It’s going to be a very small puja because
you are worshipping Me as I am.

247
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:32,904
It’s not like anything.
