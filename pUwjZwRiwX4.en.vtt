00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640
And welcome Akbar, who's going to share with us some of his amazing early experiences in

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.800
Sajyoga tonight.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.640
So just to start, Akbar, how did you come to find Sajyoga in the first place?

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.640
When was that?

5
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.640
Hello to everyone.

6
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.640
I'm Akbar, I'm from the United States of America.

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:39.160
Before I start my experiences, I just wanted to thank Caroline and other people, other

8
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:50.280
yogis are helping to support this beautiful memory of the old Saj yogis.

9
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.320
Really thank you for your love and care and time you put for that.

10
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
Thank you very much.

11
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.800
It's an enormous pleasure and a privilege.

12
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.880
So it is a little bit long story.

13
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.720
When I finished my study as an architect in Rome University, I started working in Rome

14
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:32.120
for a couple of years, but then somehow it was not easy to find a job.

15
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.320
Then I searched out of Italy, so I found a job in Zimbabwe.

16
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.320
I said, okay, I'm going to Zimbabwe.

17
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.760
Then they told me from London there are cheap flights to Zimbabwe because it's colony of

18
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.760
Britain.

19
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.320
I said, okay, go to London, spend some time there.

20
00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.320
Anyway, after a couple of weeks, I found a job as an architect.

21
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.320
I found a beautiful house in Hampstead.

22
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:19.320
Seems that everything was just arranged because the house was five minutes to Hampstead Hall,

23
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.320
walking.

24
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:28.640
Then in front of my house was this Indian store and behind my house was this Hampstead

25
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.840
Heath Park.

26
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.360
Before that, I was searching for many years.

27
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.600
I was traveling from one country to another country, one book to another book, but somehow

28
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.080
I couldn't find anything.

29
00:02:48.080 --> 00:03:00.480
For a couple of years, I was working there and my seeking was getting more strong.

30
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.120
I started having headaches and stomach problems.

31
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.760
After the work, I used to go to this Hampstead Heath Park and walk and just complain to the

32
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760
Divine.

33
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.560
So what shall I do?

34
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.840
I don't know what else I do.

35
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.640
I didn't harm anybody.

36
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.840
I didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.360
All these thoughts, I cannot stop them, all these doubts and this kind of...

38
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.360
I'm not happy.

39
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:45.360
All the time, every day I go three, four, five hours just walking like mad and talking.

40
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.360
Then one day I was just walking.

41
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.040
Suddenly I heard a voice telling me, the thing you are searching is within you, it's not

42
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.040
out.

43
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.120
I just couldn't move.

44
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.640
I don't know, maybe a little movement of Kundalini was there.

45
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.880
I was so happy, so happy that, okay, if it's inside me, I will find it.

46
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.720
I'm so tired of searching outside.

47
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.240
I don't know, for one hour maybe I couldn't move.

48
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.960
But the first time I felt my feet were on the ground.

49
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.720
It was a different kind of feeling.

50
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.720
I never had that.

51
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.720
From the next day I go walk and put my attention inside, so what is inside, what I have to

52
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.720
search, talking just myself.

53
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.720
And then I remember the Sufis saying, the God is within you.

54
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.720
I was saying, oh God, where are you?

55
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.720
What can I do?

56
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.720
How can I contact you?

57
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.720
I didn't know what to do, so talking to myself all the time.

58
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.720
Well, this for a couple of months was like this.

59
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:19.720
So I went to the library, I got all the Sakhrit books, Bible, Quran and yoga.

60
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.720
So I studied a little bit those.

61
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:32.720
Then I said, okay, if I have to start finding the God, maybe through religion.

62
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.720
Because until 15 years old, my mother was doing this namaz, this Islamic prayer.

63
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.720
My father was doing, so I was doing also.

64
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.720
But one day I did the namaz, I see before namaz, after namaz, I'm the same, nothing

65
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720
is changing.

66
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.720
So I left it.

67
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.720
After all these years passing now, I said, okay, I have to do this namaz.

68
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:09.720
I start doing namaz, and I go, somehow you put your, you bend and you put your both feet

69
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.720
on your knees and say some prayer.

70
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:24.720
And I feel my void is full of vibration, something is happening there and I don't want to get

71
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.720
up, I want to stay there.

72
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:36.720
Then when I put my head on the floor, here I feel like lots of vibration is happening

73
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.720
from my namaz during one hour.

74
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.720
So for a couple of months it was like that.

75
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:50.720
Then one day I said, I was feeling so thirsty of worshipping God.

76
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.720
I was feeling alone.

77
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.720
I said, where can I go?

78
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.720
There is mosque and church.

79
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.720
I said, I know this place is not the right place, but I was so thirsty.

80
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.720
I said, okay, I go to the church.

81
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.720
So I go to first church in Hampstead, the door is closed.

82
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.720
Oh God, all my life I see these doors are open, now I want to go, it's closed.

83
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.720
I go to second church, the door is closed.

84
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.720
I said, okay, God doesn't want to go to the church.

85
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:37.720
So I come to the house and after noon I was going to shopping.

86
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:48.720
So I knew the thing that I stole, the owner, that was young chap and we were friends.

87
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:58.720
So as soon as I put my feet in the shop, I see a small picture of Shri Mataji on the wall.

88
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:12.720
So two years this photo was there, but since I was not ready, not 21 days like a duija, like a bird.

89
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.720
So I asked him, who is she?

90
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.720
He said, oh, she's curing and she didn't know exactly what's happening.

91
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.720
But she said, oh, I can take you every Thursday, they have program there.

92
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.720
I said, yes, please.

93
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.720
So I come there.

94
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:41.720
At that time there was this John, this little guy was doing introduction and he was talking about insight.

95
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:53.720
I was so happy, at least I can understand this channel, this chakras, because I didn't know anything about it.

96
00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:05.720
So, so happy when we finished, I just jump on walking and I said, thank you, since I find that I was searching for many years.

97
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:18.720
Then Shri Mataji's talk and her talk was just seems all my cells of my brain was rusted.

98
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.720
Her talk was just getting live.

99
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.720
It's like that, this is it.

100
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.720
So I was so, so happy.

101
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:42.720
And every week I was the first person with the flower going there, sitting there next to the cassette player, because I was interested in Shri Mataji's talk.

102
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:52.720
And I was trying to learn a few phrases and practice them from the beginning.

103
00:09:52.720 --> 00:10:00.720
So she was saying, for example, go and watch the trees and see how long you can watch without thinking.

104
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:21.720
So I was practicing going to garden and watching, or when I was walking through shops, looking the vitrine, nice clothes and things, I was practicing if I can be thoughtless watching.

105
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:27.720
Anyway, so three months is passing.

106
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:34.720
Every time I go, one of these people was working on me, was this svergi.

107
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.720
Every time, he said, do you feel this cool breeze?

108
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.720
I said, what do you want? What is this cool breeze? I'm so happy you have found it.

109
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.720
I was saying, no, I don't feel it, but I'm so happy I found it.

110
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:58.720
After three months, one time I come back from the program, I go home, I have my dinner.

111
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.720
It was about 10.30, 11 o'clock, I go to sleep.

112
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.720
As soon as I put my head down, my eyes are closed.

113
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:17.720
And then suddenly I feel like a cool drop of water in my Saraswara, in front of the mohairia.

114
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:24.720
Now I can see my eyes are closed, I am so relaxed.

115
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.720
My thought process is stopped.

116
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.720
So my attention is exactly here, what's happening?

117
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.720
I'm not moving at all.

118
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:43.720
So this drop of water, like heartbeat, becomes larger and larger and larger and larger.

119
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:51.720
After some time, all the sasras cool down, the rest of my body becomes more hot.

120
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:58.720
In a way, I can feel very vividly this coolness is coming down.

121
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.720
I came down, came down, turned around, my head is cool.

122
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:10.720
I don't feel the weight of my body and I'm just enjoying this.

123
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.720
Came down, came down, came down.

124
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:21.720
As soon as I reached my heart, suddenly, like when you put the TV on, the image comes,

125
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.720
I see my heart in the palm of both hands.

126
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.720
Now my eyes are closed, I can see this is my heart.

127
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.720
It is palpitating, it's full of light.

128
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:42.720
I can see all the veins and I was so doubting, this is my heart.

129
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.720
I said, let me see if the palpitating is the same to make sure.

130
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.720
I listened to my heart palpitating and see if it's the same.

131
00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.720
So this coolness has stayed a long time in my heart.

132
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:09.720
So when the heart was cooled down, as soon as the coolness went down,

133
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.720
then this image went away.

134
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:20.720
I came down, came down, came down, until my toes, all my body is cool.

135
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:30.720
And as soon as all my body got cool down, then I feel the chakras palpitating,

136
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.720
getting out of the heat.

137
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.720
I feel better and better, exactly, I can feel where are the chakras.

138
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.720
So this was going on and on and on.

139
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:51.720
After sometime I just opened my eyes and I see the sunlight from the window.

140
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.720
I said, no, it's not possible.

141
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.720
I opened my eyes, it's three o'clock the day after.

142
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:03.720
It was 17 hours, this took place.

143
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.720
It still was working, but I had to go to work.

144
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:20.720
So I just came down from the bed and suddenly I remember the Bible was written about baptism.

145
00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.720
It becomes like a second birth.

146
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:30.720
And exactly it was like that because I was feeling a newborn, like a baby,

147
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:39.720
without any kind of all my problems, thinking, doubt, nothing, no thought.

148
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.720
Babbling with the joy for four days, it was like this.

149
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.720
Day and night, these seven chakras was palpitating, clearing up the chakras.

150
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:59.720
And I was just in the realm.

151
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:05.720
So then after one month, Shrimadji came.

152
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.720
The first program was in…

153
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.720
Akbar, what year was that? What year was that?

154
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.720
This was 82.

155
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.720
1982.

156
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.720
Then after program, the sahaja yogis went to Shrimadji and said,

157
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.720
Shrimadji, we found a Muslim.

158
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.720
Shrimadji was laughing and said, come here.

159
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:35.720
I sat there with her hand, she massaged my satsaras.

160
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.720
She said, oh, it's okay.

161
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:46.720
After four days, I was in the train with Shrimadji and two other yogis.

162
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.720
They were four people going to Brighton for Buddha Buddha.

163
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.720
I'm only four months inside yoga.

164
00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:03.720
I'm so happy about myself because it was totally new life.

165
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.720
Shrimadji is sitting in front of me.

166
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:18.720
Somehow we went to Brighton, five days we were with her, doing full job, going shopping with her.

167
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:29.720
After that, I said, I have to go around the world to bring this message because I know everybody has problems.

168
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.720
Because I was traveling a lot.

169
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.720
So I said, let's start from Italy.

170
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.720
I have to go back to Italy because I knew many people there, friends and friends.

171
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:48.720
So then from there, we started.

172
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:59.720
Shrimadji wanted to make a school, so we had to find the ashram, the first ashram in Rome.

173
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:10.720
After that, she wanted to buy an ashram.

174
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:22.720
So this was the story of my self-realization.

175
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.720
What other experiences did you have with Shrimadji that you can tell us about, Thakbam?

176
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:39.720
One of the experiences was the first time in the hamster hall when I was sitting to her, she said, what are you doing?

177
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.720
I said, I'm an architect. She said, oh, one day you have to build a house for me.

178
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.720
So years passed, nothing happened.

179
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.720
Pratistan was built.

180
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:59.720
Then we started Sahaja Yoga in Istanbul.

181
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.720
And the first program, there were many people.

182
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:11.720
And then after three weeks, there were about 50 people in the follow-up.

183
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.720
Then we said somebody has to stay, take care of them.

184
00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:22.720
So I said, this is a Muslim country, so maybe I have to stay.

185
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:29.720
So for nine months, I rented an apartment and I was doing a program.

186
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:36.720
After nine months, we invited Shrimadji to come there.

187
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.720
And then when she came, she was very happy about the new seekers.

188
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:48.720
She said, oh, you have to come to India to build a house for me.

189
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.720
I forgot everything.

190
00:18:52.720 --> 00:19:02.720
So I went to India and this was amazing because there was another architect in India, so we were two architects.

191
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.720
So we went to measure the plot and came to her.

192
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:16.720
We put a small little table for her and pen and paper.

193
00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.720
We measured the plot and put it in front of her.

194
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.720
And we told each other, we don't suggest anything.

195
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.720
Whatever she said, she said, gee, gee, gee, gee.

196
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:36.720
So she started planning, okay, bedrooms are here, these are windows.

197
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:52.720
The escape steps are here, the bathrooms are here.

198
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:56.720
So four or five hours she planned.

199
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.720
This is a five-story building.

200
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.720
But you could see somehow the staircase doesn't go there.

201
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.720
But she was asking, is okay, the staircase here?

202
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.720
Gee, gee, gee.

203
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.720
So we come and we put in the escape.

204
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.720
Next day we go there.

205
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.720
The staircase is not here.

206
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720
It's here.

207
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.720
The bedroom is not there.

208
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.720
She changed everything.

209
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.720
Three, four hours, five hours.

210
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.720
So we came back and put in the staircase, go back there.

211
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:42.720
Every day we go there until little by little you could see, oh, this is a great idea.

212
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:49.720
She kind of made kind of thing to get the light in the center of the building.

213
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.720
The building is in Noida.

214
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.720
It was private, I don't know.

215
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.720
House for her.

216
00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:04.720
Anyway, after 16 days, it was nearly done.

217
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.720
Everything was nicely done.

218
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720
Without VISA, anything.

219
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.720
It did everything.

220
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:21.720
So at the end when we finish, then she said, ah, these architects, they have some concept in their head.

221
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.720
The staircase should be there.

222
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.720
The bathroom should be there.

223
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.720
But building a house is like a woman want to have a child.

224
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.720
So nine months it take until the baby is completed.

225
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.720
So the building is the same.

226
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:49.720
So I have to put first the bedroom is there, then staircase there, then see how it's coming, then change it.

227
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.720
I have to create.

228
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.720
Otherwise, this architect have concept in their head.

229
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.720
So that was amazing.

230
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.720
I heard also the engineering part she did it.

231
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.720
Which kind of bar you put, this thing.

232
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.720
It was kind of amazing.

233
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:20.720
Then after that, I was two years there until the structure of the building was finished.

234
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.720
And after two years, she said, okay, come to Milano.

235
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.720
I want to buy a castle.

236
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:34.720
So I came, we went to Milano every day because different castle.

237
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:50.720
We find one castle, real castle on two floor, high ceiling, all painting, very nice, nice old furniture and 90 bedroom.

238
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.720
It was really a castle.

239
00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.720
So she asked us, do you like it?

240
00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.720
Yes, she might have did.

241
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.720
So okay, bargain, bye.

242
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:12.720
So this would take few days until the practical thing was happening.

243
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.720
In the meantime, she said, let's go to see other places.

244
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.720
None, we end up in Cabela.

245
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.720
Her car was this Lincoln, you couldn't go to that road.

246
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.720
She said, okay, I'll sit here in the car.

247
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.720
You guys go, let me see.

248
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.720
I stayed with her with the others up there.

249
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.720
They came back with the face all down.

250
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.720
So how is it?

251
00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.720
She managed, it's all broken and small compared to the others.

252
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.720
She didn't say anything.

253
00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.720
I mean, my experience is that she knew every single thing.

254
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.720
She just was just playing with her children.

255
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.720
Enjoy.

256
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.720
She didn't say anything.

257
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.720
So she said, okay, let's go buy some furniture.

258
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.720
No, she didn't buy anything and still go furniture.

259
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.720
So we find huge building, five-story building.

260
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:32.720
One floor is beds, one floor is dining room, chairs, one floor is cupboard.

261
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.720
She just not stopping, just walking.

262
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.720
You're right, four beds of single bed, two beds of double.

263
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.720
This is the room.

264
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.720
Chair, table, big list.

265
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.720
Two or three hours we were just going up and down.

266
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.720
So nice Guru Puja is coming.

267
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.720
She wanted to do puja in the garden of the castle.

268
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:07.720
It happened for some reason we couldn't buy that big castle.

269
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.720
So quickly she said, let's go to Cabela.

270
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.720
So she came there.

271
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.720
The mayor of Cabela has a jeep.

272
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.720
So we went up.

273
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.720
In one hour she bought Cabela.

274
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:33.720
And then for puja somehow we organized everything there next to the river.

275
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:41.720
And exactly all those furniture she bought it, we can see Cabela just right through there.

276
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.720
This was another episode.

277
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:58.720
Akbar, before you continue, do you remember, I seem to remember a little Ganesha puja on the lawn at the back of the castle, even before Guru Puja.

278
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.720
Do you remember that?

279
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.720
Well, it can't have been before Guru Puja, but there was a little puja.

280
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.720
This was after.

281
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:14.720
The first was on the river we rent a kind of a place.

282
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.720
We put a tent and it was there.

283
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:23.720
Then we kind of did puja on the back of the castle.

284
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.720
A little one just on that lawn outside.

285
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720
Yeah.

286
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:39.720
Another story was buying this rum ashram.

287
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:47.720
She was in Rome and I was a driver or someone.

288
00:26:47.720 --> 00:27:03.720
Before she's coming tomorrow, the day before that, I just thought I go buy a new suit and then go to airport and have a new suit.

289
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:10.720
So I go one road close to my house from one shop to another shop.

290
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.720
These that was not my side.

291
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:22.720
I couldn't find and this is eight o'clock and shops are closing.

292
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.720
I reached to the end of the road.

293
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:31.720
Then I said, OK, maybe mother doesn't want to buy a suit.

294
00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.720
I come home.

295
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.720
I come towards the car.

296
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.720
Now the road is a bit dark because all the shops are closed.

297
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.720
And I reached to my car.

298
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.720
I see a plastic bag hanging to my door.

299
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.720
I said, somebody mistake.

300
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.720
Shall I wait and see if somebody come?

301
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.720
Ten minutes I wait.

302
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.720
Nobody coming and nobody's in the road.

303
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:09.720
I just go there and look a little bit in the bag at some clothes.

304
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.720
Again, another five minutes I wait and nobody comes.

305
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.720
So I came home.

306
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.720
There were three suits in my size.

307
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.720
Because my legs were short.

308
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.720
All the time I have to shorten but this was.

309
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.720
So anyway, we go to the airport.

310
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.720
We bring her.

311
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.720
She was about one week in Rome.

312
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:41.720
And at that time we had 100 children, two, three years old.

313
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:49.720
So the departure day, she had flight I think at two o'clock afternoon.

314
00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:55.720
Usually she get up at seven, eight, have tea.

315
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.720
Talk to people.

316
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.720
Then always have breakfast.

317
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.720
No, shower, then breakfast.

318
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.720
Then she's ready.

319
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.720
So now it's nine o'clock, ten o'clock, eleven o'clock.

320
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.720
Still she's not moving.

321
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.720
She didn't have still breakfast.

322
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:23.720
And she's not, she didn't have shower.

323
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.720
Then somehow she went shower, have breakfast.

324
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.720
Nice.

325
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.720
12.30.

326
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.720
Now have one hour and half.

327
00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.720
Then 100 children are waiting outside with the flowers.

328
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:48.720
We are shaking because flight is canceling.

329
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:55.720
So we come out hugging these children, drinking flowers.

330
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.720
So we have, she sat in the car.

331
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.720
We have one hour.

332
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.720
She went to sleep.

333
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:10.720
We were going 180, 190 kilometers an hour.

334
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.720
Ten kilometer to the airport.

335
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:20.720
It was an accident so all the cars stopped.

336
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.720
In Italy there is always a line for police and things.

337
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.720
So we put it there, all the light on.

338
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:34.720
And we're going 100 kilometer an hour.

339
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:40.720
We just reach to the airport and we see all the yogis are outside.

340
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:49.720
So I felt that something happened because usually most of the people are inside.

341
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.720
As soon as I break, she just woke up.

342
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.720
She said, what's happening?

343
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:02.720
So we put the glass down.

344
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.720
They said, she's already, flight is canceled.

345
00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.720
Oh, okay.

346
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.720
Let's go have lunch.

347
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.720
So we go to the fish restaurant, very nice.

348
00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.720
And we have lunch.

349
00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:26.720
And there we had, Guido had this advertisement about this Rome Armstrong.

350
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:32.720
And it was a big project so he couldn't decide, meeting Shimadu.

351
00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.720
He asked her, Shimadu, shall we go see this place?

352
00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.720
I said yes.

353
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.720
So we go, we come to the Armstrong.

354
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720
She sat in the car.

355
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:51.720
She said, oh, already I saw, you go and see.

356
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:59.720
So we go see and it was perfect because many rooms and if you are up in there,

357
00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:05.720
you can see big hall and all these Roman arches, very nice.

358
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:11.720
And big land also is there.

359
00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.720
So we came out, the Shimadu is perfect.

360
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.720
Then she said, go see the other building.

361
00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.720
It was two buildings that honor couldn't sell because it was too good.

362
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.720
So it divided in two.

363
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.720
Anyway, we went to see the other one also.

364
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.720
Okay, bargain.

365
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:42.720
So then somehow we go to the Armstrong.

366
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:53.720
These are few episodes somehow of my story with her.

367
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.720
Exactly, she should know what is happening.

368
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:04.720
Do you have any special miracle stories to tell us, Akbar?

369
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.720
Miracle stories are a lot.

370
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.720
I just say few of them.

371
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:26.720
Somehow this was, I was living in Tenablet and she was going to Los Angeles.

372
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.720
And we were in the airport.

373
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.720
I was there also.

374
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.720
And 50, 60 leaders were there also.

375
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.720
Then it was after the puja.

376
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:46.720
But before her departure, she called me and said,

377
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.720
when we come to Los Angeles, I want to talk to you about Iran.

378
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.720
Now I'm living in Capella.

379
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.720
I see her often, but not a lot.

380
00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.720
I knew because there are many Iranians there also.

381
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.720
Anyway, I went much earlier.

382
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.720
I did program.

383
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.720
I had interviewing TV.

384
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.720
It was a big program, very nice.

385
00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:18.720
So I went to see her in the house.

386
00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.720
And I said, I mean, she asked me to go and see her.

387
00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.720
I don't want to travel.

388
00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:30.720
I don't have anything that I have to see her.

389
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:35.720
But this fellow went up there and she said, Akbar is here.

390
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:41.720
She just said, oh, Akbar the king, tell him to come up.

391
00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720
And she went up.

392
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:49.720
This was 2003, exactly the time when she started receiving back.

393
00:34:49.720 --> 00:35:02.720
I never forget that she was so happy and the collaboration was amazing.

394
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.720
And SSTP was there and she was saying, oh, he's doing so much for Sahabhi.

395
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.720
Oh, God.

396
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:17.720
I said, Shri Mataji, please, this message you brought it for us, this love is so great.

397
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.720
You cannot hold it down.

398
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720
You have to go.

399
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:30.720
Anyway, at the end, she said, these Iranians are very dharmic people, open-hearted.

400
00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.720
So lots of seekers are there.

401
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.720
So we have to try to save as much as we can.

402
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.720
Shri Mataji, I promise you, I do my little best.

403
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:51.720
So from that time, I used to go to Los Angeles, stay three months and come back to three weeks

404
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.720
in Kabela, then go back for three months, for two years.

405
00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.720
I did a lot of program in different cities.

406
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:08.720
And then one time in the immigration, they cut hold of me.

407
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.720
So they put me in one room.

408
00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.720
They don't tell me what's happening, but I know.

409
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.720
It's like they go in the computer, they see two years I'm there.

410
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.720
What is he doing there?

411
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:36.720
These are few experience I had really taught me that surrendering, what does it mean surrendering?

412
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.720
So I arrived there, it was six o'clock.

413
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.720
Now it's 10 o'clock in the night.

414
00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.720
They don't tell me anything.

415
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.720
It's 12 o'clock.

416
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.720
I felt the next day they want to send me back.

417
00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.720
So it's one o'clock.

418
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.720
I just said, okay, let me meditate.

419
00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:12.720
I mean, in that kind of vibration there is police, very serious stuff.

420
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.720
I just, I don't know, five, 10 minutes meditating.

421
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:25.720
So Kundalini was so strong and suddenly I feel my heart full of joy.

422
00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.720
My body was joy.

423
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:35.720
And I just felt, okay, if they want to send me back, it's good.

424
00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.720
Because my family is there, my family is there.

425
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.720
Here I have to run, here and there.

426
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.720
It works.

427
00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:49.720
I kind of really surrendered because until one o'clock my attention was so worried.

428
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.720
I came all this way, what is happening?

429
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.720
His ego started.

430
00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.720
But in that moment, now you see how the divine plays.

431
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:09.720
I open my eyes, I see all these police officers are changed.

432
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.720
When they change, I don't know.

433
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.720
It was five minutes of meditation.

434
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.720
And this African American lady, police officer sitting there.

435
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.720
I just jumped to her.

436
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:28.720
I said, you know, we are teaching meditation and this energy will awaken.

437
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:34.720
And you enter into this state of thoughtless awareness.

438
00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.720
She said, what?

439
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.720
Thoughtless.

440
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.720
How can you be thoughtless?

441
00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.720
I'm getting crazy.

442
00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.720
I have so many thoughts, I don't know what to do.

443
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.720
I said, it's so easy.

444
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.720
You want to try?

445
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.720
She said, yes.

446
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:55.720
Okay, my police officer watching me.

447
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.720
I said, open your eyes, close your eyes.

448
00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.720
I saw his eye gear is there, his back.

449
00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.720
So I open my eye gear and push.

450
00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.720
My eye gear is open and she just went.

451
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.720
I said, stay as long as you want, enjoy.

452
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.720
Nearly 20 minutes she was in that state.

453
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.720
She opened her eyes.

454
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.720
What did you do?

455
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.720
There's no thought.

456
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:29.720
I said, this is what I'm doing.

457
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.720
So this is my business card.

458
00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.720
So that is, you have a hole in Los Angeles.

459
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.720
You can go there.

460
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.720
It's free of charge.

461
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.720
She said, why you are here then?

462
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.720
I said, that's why we are here.

463
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.720
I don't know what they think.

464
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.720
I'm coming here just to teach meditation.

465
00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:58.720
She said, wait, I go and see what they have written for you.

466
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.720
After five minutes, she came.

467
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.720
I said, oh, sorry.

468
00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.720
I'm so sorry from immigration department.

469
00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.720
You are free.

470
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720
You want the car?

471
00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720
We can give you a car.

472
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.720
You want the telephone?

473
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.720
She said, telephone.

474
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.720
I'm very sorry.

475
00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.720
For five times she came to Albroga.

476
00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:29.720
But as she was living near the airport, we couldn't follow.

477
00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.720
So kind of a few episodes that said,

478
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.720
you're really surrendering what doesn't mean.

479
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.720
Then she is in the realm of divine.

480
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.720
She can do anything.

481
00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.720
She is God Almighty.

482
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.720
She can change everything.

483
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:58.720
So another episode was, it was about London.

484
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.720
So I was living in United, Los Angeles,

485
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.720
but my children were in Rome, Australia.

486
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.720
They were studying there.

487
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:14.720
So three months before, I said, okay,

488
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:20.720
I come for Christmas time, spend time with my children.

489
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.720
I said, okay, they were happy.

490
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.720
So I got my ticket.

491
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.720
And two weeks before my departure,

492
00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.720
my son is calling me and said,

493
00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:38.720
oh, there is the UO Shakti Seminar in London.

494
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.720
So shall we go there?

495
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.720
I said, I'm coming there to spend with you.

496
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.720
What, you're going there?

497
00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.720
But then I said, yes, I mean,

498
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.720
we would enjoy more there with me.

499
00:41:53.720 --> 00:42:00.720
Anyway, I said, anyway, I come to Brahma Ashram.

500
00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.720
So our flight come to the London.

501
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.720
And the captain, they says, there is so much fog.

502
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.720
So they don't allow any plane to land.

503
00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.720
But they told us, 10 minutes we go around,

504
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.720
maybe something happened.

505
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.720
Already I feel, oh, London,

506
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.720
children are coming there,

507
00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.720
Christmas time.

508
00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.720
Somehow I'm happy with them.

509
00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.720
And after 10 minutes, the captain says,

510
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.720
okay, only they give permission to us

511
00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.720
because we're coming from far away from America.

512
00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.720
So the plane landed.

513
00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.720
I entered the airport full of people.

514
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.720
Everybody's angry.

515
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.720
All the flight was canceled.

516
00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.720
I'm so happy.

517
00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.720
Let's go see what's happening.

518
00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.720
I went to the desk with Isha.

519
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.720
So what shall we do?

520
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.720
He said, they say for five days,

521
00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.720
this fog is there.

522
00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:18.720
All the flights are canceled for five days.

523
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:24.720
So this is the five star hotel thing.

524
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.720
This is money for your traveling.

525
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.720
This is for eating.

526
00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.720
So five days we were there.

527
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.720
We went to the seminar.

528
00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.720
We spent time with Christmas time with them.

529
00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.720
Somehow.

530
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.720
More part of these stories?

531
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.720
Yes, please. Yes, please.

532
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.720
Yes, yes.

533
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:06.720
Another time was this very,

534
00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.720
was India tour.

535
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:15.720
And always, whenever I went to the tour,

536
00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.720
they used to give me a bus.

537
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.720
So there were so many buses, Krishna bus, Kanesha bus.

538
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.720
This was Ak bus.

539
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.720
It was famous.

540
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.720
In this bus, there is no eating, no sleeping.

541
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.720
Only bad.

542
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:38.720
So all these musicians, joyful people, they were full.

543
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.720
I mean, really it was particular.

544
00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:47.720
So this time, this year, it was very nice tour.

545
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.720
And everybody tell, come on, you have to go.

546
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.720
I said, there's no money.

547
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.720
I cannot.

548
00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.720
Two months before.

549
00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:00.720
But time to turn the car, I said, still nothing happened.

550
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:06.720
This is another kind of surrendering example.

551
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:15.720
Two days before the tour start, I just surrender.

552
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.720
I said, two days, not possible anymore.

553
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:24.720
Because always the desire was mother, some miracle, some thing.

554
00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:32.720
So I just was not in my head.

555
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.720
And I was clearing up my office paper things.

556
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:44.720
In those time, they used to give the booklet from the bank,

557
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.720
how much you have, how much you spend,

558
00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.720
every time they write it down.

559
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:57.720
And whenever I changed my residence, I didn't change.

560
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.720
I didn't close my account.

561
00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:04.720
I opened another account next to my place.

562
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.720
Somehow four or five of these booklets came down in my hand.

563
00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:15.720
I opened one, five euro, ten euro, five euro, ten euro,

564
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.720
three thousand euro, three thousand euro.

565
00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:27.720
If in those time, if I had three thousand euro, I cannot forget.

566
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:34.720
So I said, okay, if three thousand euro is there,

567
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:41.720
but I had the Iranian passport to get the Indian visa,

568
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.720
usually three or four days in those time.

569
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.720
I said, if this happens, let's go see what's happening.

570
00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.720
So I go to the Indian Embassy.

571
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.720
I ask, is it a bit urgent?

572
00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.720
He said, when do you want? I said, tomorrow.

573
00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.720
He said, come this afternoon, it's ready.

574
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:16.720
So this three thousand was exactly the right amount to enjoy shopping and train.

575
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:22.720
So still, I don't know from where this three thousand came.

576
00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:28.720
And one bank didn't complain so much.

577
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:37.720
Another one, so many.

578
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:46.720
Somehow I was in India tour, something happened one week before I had to come back to Italy.

579
00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:54.720
So everybody was saying, no, we cannot change your ticket, it's too difficult, don't go.

580
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.720
I said, no, I have to go. I know something will happen.

581
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.720
I come to daily airport in Air France.

582
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.720
I go there, I said, there's something urgent, I have to go back.

583
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.720
So he said, it's impossible, 24 hours are waiting.

584
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.720
I said, I have to go.

585
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.720
He said, there is no possibility.

586
00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.720
I said, can I talk to your manager?

587
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:31.720
The manager came, I said, look, I have to go, this is very emergency problem.

588
00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.720
No possibility.

589
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.720
Wait until the end and see what's happening.

590
00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:44.720
So at the end, before they closed the door, he came and said, oh, there is one place.

591
00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:51.720
So he gave me, I go there, I sit, a lady sitting there.

592
00:48:52.720 --> 00:49:00.720
I mean, can you believe, how can it possible, never happen, they give one seat to two people.

593
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.720
I see the numbers she had and I have, it's the same.

594
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:15.720
So this lady came and said, what's happening?

595
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:21.720
I said, well, it's the same number.

596
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.720
Check it out.

597
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.720
Okay, you come with me.

598
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:36.720
And it took me the first last I sit there, first time from India.

599
00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.720
It was the most joyful flight of my life.

600
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:58.720
Do you have any more miracle stories or do you want to just share some of these experiences that helped you go deeper Akbar?

601
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.720
I think we go to that because it's getting closer to ending.

602
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.720
I don't think anybody is bored by your stories.

603
00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:12.720
Enjoy, enjoy.

604
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.720
Thank you.

605
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:30.720
So, I mean, the most important thing in my Sahaja life is that

606
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:44.720
from, as I said from the beginning, studying Shri Mataji's Thak.

607
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:53.720
Because I saw when I'm listening to her Thak, so after two, three days, I don't remember anything.

608
00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.720
So there is, I cannot absorb.

609
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:08.720
So the Divine came with all this pure knowledge of God Almighty.

610
00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.720
So she's chosen us as employees.

611
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:33.720
So our job, which I understood, is that I go to her Thak and write and find all these phrases, all these words, which is pure knowledge of Divine.

612
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:48.720
And read again and again for 50 times, 100 times, 200 times, then absorb those vibrations, then retain it.

613
00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:59.720
Then what's happening? First of all, I feel the joy because all these words, all these phrases of her give you joy.

614
00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:10.720
And also the satsaras is open. So whatever I learn from my satsara goes to the eater and goes all over.

615
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.720
Now the human beings, those who are ready, they can absorb, they can grasp.

616
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:26.720
Even if they don't come to Sahaja Yoga, but they grow, with my growth, all human beings can grow.

617
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:44.720
So this first thing somehow that all the time from 40 years of my Sahaja Yoga life really is helping me a lot.

618
00:52:44.720 --> 00:53:07.720
So then another thing I learned is that somehow Shri Mataji also is in our sacrum bone. She is there.

619
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:21.720
All the deities are within ourselves. So I learned that as much as possible, I just bring my attention within myself.

620
00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:33.720
Every day, in the morning, I close my eyes and put my attention, put my hand in the sacrum bone and talk to her.

621
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:42.720
Shri Mataji, thank you for giving us this big blessing. Are you happy? Are you okay?

622
00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:55.720
Just talking with her, talking to them with the Swami, just like that.

623
00:53:55.720 --> 00:54:06.720
I can see, I mean, I feel those vibrations which are within me.

624
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:21.720
Then little by little, when I grow in Sahaja Yoga, I really can feel that.

625
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:36.720
This Akbar really cannot do anything because from childhood, my ego and superego is like a tape recorder.

626
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:50.720
So I record like this and this. This is the sun. This is the color of blue. So this tape recorder doesn't have any power.

627
00:54:50.720 --> 00:55:06.720
So what I am doing during the day, whatever I do, Akbar, you are not doing. Then suddenly you kind of become thoughtless.

628
00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:19.720
Then I make this mother kundalini work. In reality, she is doing everything. She is digesting my food. She is breathing for me.

629
00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:29.720
She is running my heart. She is taking care of my liver, my kidney. 300 billion cells are working within me.

630
00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:44.720
Akbar cannot do anything. He cannot move my fingers. So all is done by her. When I cook, I just, Swamahataji, you are going to cook.

631
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:52.720
When I eat, I say I have to give food to all these deities which matters within me.

632
00:55:53.720 --> 00:56:06.720
Then this feeling of respecting yourself, loving yourself is developing within us. And this is always within me.

633
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:22.720
So wherever I go, I feel great. I feel good. I feel so peaceful and joyful. Because, okay, this kind of altar is there.

634
00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:33.720
But that altar has a feeling I learn within ourselves. And wherever we go, it is with us.

635
00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:55.720
So this also is a beautiful play when we just can watch through this thoughtless awareness, maybe a little bit in thoughtless awareness.

636
00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:06.720
Then you don't have any doubt about yourself that you don't do any single thing. Then you surrender.

637
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:29.720
When I surrender, then I feel so much bliss. Then she is doing everything. Whatever is good for my life, for my growth, it's happening.

638
00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:45.720
Because then you become the citizen of her. Then when you are a citizen of the divine, then she will take care of everything.

639
00:57:45.720 --> 00:58:08.720
I really don't know how to thank her. Every walk of my life, I just bow within myself. I just say thank you, Srimadaji. Thank you. Thank you.

640
00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:30.720
She is giving us this beautiful life that somehow we don't have any desire, we don't want anything. Because she is fulfilling you totally.

641
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:46.720
And you are still going around the world giving realization to Iranians mainly, isn't it?

642
00:58:47.720 --> 00:59:04.720
Yes, mainly to Iranians. Recently, for three months, we went to all Europe, from Germany, Holland, Belgium, Scandinavia, to different cities.

643
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:18.720
With the car, we went 10,000 kilometers. Because now Iranians are everywhere. That's why Srimadaji knew at that time. She told me, take care of Iranians.

644
00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:38.720
Then we came back and we went to Los Angeles. Again, I went around, I did so many programs. Now I'm coming to London. In June, we have some programs in Hampstead.

645
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:58.720
When I have to go to Paris, there are thousands and thousands of Iranians in these places. As long as I can walk, I can talk, I just try to give this message.

646
00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:13.720
It's amazing, I can see wherever I do programs, when you see the eyes of these people. I don't know if Iranians are so particular, I don't know.

647
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:32.720
As soon as I talk to them, I see this energy awakened, you feel this coolness in your fontanel bone area, I can see the Kundalini in their eyes. It's just shining. I never saw anywhere.

648
01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:55.720
I don't know, maybe Iran is in the map of the Divine Special Place, I don't know. But she always, whenever she saw us, she talked about Iran was the first place she gave collective self-realization in 1970.

649
01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.720
I did not know that.

650
01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:25.720
The first place she gave self-realization was because Baba Mama was there in 1970, she went to visit her. Then Baba Mama had a friend, colleagues, so one day, everybody there wanted to know about this meditation.

651
01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:44.720
And she gave self-realization. A couple of times she asked me, still those people are coming to Swaraj Yoga? I said, I don't know, I'm not there. But somehow.

652
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.720
We still just have a few minutes left. Does anybody have a question for Akbar?

653
01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:05.720
I think everybody's just blown away by your story, Saqbar.

654
01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.720
Maybe a couple of minutes, we can meditate?

655
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.720
Yeah, sure, please.

656
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.720
We just close our eyes.

657
01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.720
Just put both hands in the sacrum bone.

658
01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.720
Just we bring our attention on our sacrum bone.

659
01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:57.720
We just thank Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji, for choosing us as her children, as her disciples, as her employees.

660
01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:10.720
And try to feel this amazing power of her.

661
01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.720
See if you can feel it rising so nicely, so smoothly.

662
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:47.720
You have to make her work. In reality, she is doing all the work.

663
01:03:48.720 --> 01:04:03.720
But if we make her work, then we will develop her. We will develop our Kundalini. Otherwise, we're developing our ego.

664
01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:11.720
Now we put our hand on our heart.

665
01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:29.720
And try to feel the spirit, which is always Shri Mataji herself.

666
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:46.720
See if we can feel the joy come out of our hands.

667
01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:15.720
The tanks have it.

668
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:33.720
Now we bring our hand with palm of our right hand, our satsrata.

669
01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:48.720
Just try to massage the lotus feet in our satsram.

670
01:05:48.720 --> 01:06:11.720
Just feel she is sitting in our satsram and also she is sitting in the satsram of all these human beings.

671
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:19.720
The human beings, they think they are doing this, they are doing that.

672
01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:30.720
This one is the President of America, the other one is making a war, this, that. But they don't know, they cannot move one finger.

673
01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:39.720
It's such a lila, such a drama, such a play. It's amazing.

674
01:06:39.720 --> 01:07:04.720
Now we can bring our hand down and for a few moments, let's become one with this silence which prevails the whole universe.

675
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:17.720
This is the power of our Divine Mother. Become one with this silence.

676
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:47.720
Let's get lost.

677
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:19.720
Let's get lost.

678
01:08:34.720 --> 01:09:00.720
This last step to our evolution, she chose us as an instrument.

679
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:09.720
At the Big Bang, the Adishakti is separated from Sadashiva.

680
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:25.720
Now when we rise our Kundalini, we rise Adishakti, we meet them with Sadashiva.

681
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:41.720
It means one cycle of our evolution ending when our Kundalini established in our satsram.

682
01:09:41.720 --> 01:10:00.720
Such a responsibility, such a beautiful play, such an important we are for Divine.

683
01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:09.720
We have to meet them as much as possible.

684
01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:50.720
Thank you.

685
01:10:50.720 --> 01:11:09.720
Such a beautiful realization. Thank you everyone. Thank you for listening to me.

686
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:20.720
We can rise our Kundalini if we don't simplify now.

687
01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:32.720
With this knowledge that we are meeting Adishakti with Sadashiva.

688
01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.720
Thank you.

689
01:11:53.720 --> 01:12:07.720
Thank you. Thank you Akbar. I shall be listening to this talk again, especially to your tips on going deeper. I need to take those in again definitely. Thank you so much.

690
01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.720
Thank you very much. Thank you everybody.

691
01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.720
Thank you Akbar.

692
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.720
Thank you Akbar.

693
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.720
Thank you.
