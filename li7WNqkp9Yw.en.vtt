00:02:11.462 --> 00:02:17.665
We have had Bhairava Puja in Belgium

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:23.793
and now I thought today let us have Mahakali Puja

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:30.936
because yesterday's experience, last night's experience,

00:02:31.137 --> 00:02:35.121
was the work of Mahakali.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:43.005
She has a double role all the time, she's at two extremes.

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:53.858
On one side she is full of joy, giver of joy,

00:02:55.093 --> 00:03:00.227
she's very happy when she sees her disciple are joyous.

00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:03.912
Joy is her own quality, is her energy,

00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:07.618
and yesterday you must have been amazed to see

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.266
so many middle-aged ladies of France smiling and laughing.

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:17.637
I'd never seen them smiling;

00:03:19.786 --> 00:03:22.968
it's very surprising how they were so joyous

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:28.629
and so very happy and this is the energy of Mahakali

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.613
that gives you all that joy after Realization

00:03:32.814 --> 00:03:35.801
and the joy you enjoy among yourselves,

00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:39.684
all these are the qualities of Mahakali

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:44.075
and when they will read out the names of Mahakali

00:03:44.276 --> 00:03:54.036
you will know how her powers manifest in Sahaja Yoga

00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:56.864
and how it has helped you all

00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:00.862
to get drenched into the Ocean of Joy.

00:04:05.492 --> 00:04:16.955
To begin with I have to tell you one thing that

00:04:17.168 --> 00:04:20.389
Mahakali Puja, when you are doing,

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.449
you have to feel a joy within yourself,

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:31.028
and joy from other Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.229
If you, if you cannot feel that, that means you are not yet grown

00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:41.972
and there's some problem, maybe with your parents,

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:44.714
maybe with your children, maybe it's family, with your country,

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:48.145
whatever it is but there's some sort of a conditioning

00:04:48.346 --> 00:04:51.879
which is working out that doesn't give you that joy.

00:04:55.626 --> 00:05:02.445
And to grow into Sahaja Yoga is very important,

00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:04.466
which I think people don't understand,

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:09.054
even if they live in ashrams, they don't understand one thing,

00:05:09.255 --> 00:05:11.888
that you have to be collective.

00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:18.530
If you are not collective then you are thrown out, gradually.

00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:26.636
Now this Mahakali power has got seven strings you can say this,

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:30.894
and these strings are there to throw you out

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:33.933
into collective subconscious (next couple of words inaudible).

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.212
Like as in the sitar you have seen for the resonance,

00:05:38.413 --> 00:05:40.771
there are other strings also.

00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:45.105
So once you start getting out of the collectivity

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:52.972
it is the Mahakali Herself, picks you out and starts throwing you out,

00:05:53.173 --> 00:05:56.981
slowly slowly to the subconscious area

00:05:57.182 --> 00:06:00.658
and where you just disappear.

00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:04.642
And all kinds of problems start,

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.274
I have seen this happening in every country,

00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:14.906
that people who do not attend the collective meditation.

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:19.185
For France I have the same report

00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:26.466
and I think the people who do not grow will be thrown out.

00:06:28.302 --> 00:06:32.072
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action,

00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:35.100
as the Mahakali has a double action.

00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:37.702
She's extremely loving, full of joy,

00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:42.546
full of happiness and She's the one who's extremely cruel, wrathful,

00:06:42.747 --> 00:06:46.655
She's the one who's the slayer of all the demons and the evil,

00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:51.312
and those people who try to do evil.

00:06:51.513 --> 00:06:54.412
So once you are thrown out into the left side

00:06:54.631 --> 00:06:56.803
then you can imagine, you can develop any kind

00:06:57.004 --> 00:06:58.921
of left-side diseases to begin with,

00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:01.708
Mooladhara diseases are the worst,

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:06.785
you develop diseases like mellitus, this, er, er,

00:07:06.986 --> 00:07:09.999
you must have heard of the disabilities caused

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.613
by the muscles getting degenerated.

00:07:13.814 --> 00:07:17.814
All muscular degeneration comes from this problem.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.955
So at any cost that must be avoided.

00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:29.997
But if you are not in the collective, if you do not understand the collective,

00:07:30.198 --> 00:07:33.327
and if you are out of the collective

00:07:33.543 --> 00:07:37.980
you'll be surprised that negative forces will join together

00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:40.930
and they'll pull you out.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.490
So this is one of the things that happens,

00:07:45.936 --> 00:07:52.331
so be very careful that don't avoid the collective programmes.

00:07:55.543 --> 00:08:00.895
The, another problem about Mahakali is that,

00:08:01.096 --> 00:08:04.824
that She's the one who gives you the feeling

00:08:05.025 --> 00:08:10.256
for your wife, for your husband,

00:08:10.457 --> 00:08:14.053
She is the one.

00:08:15.486 --> 00:08:19.962
Now there also, the same problem.

00:08:20.163 --> 00:08:27.852
If both of them are alright, She's alright

00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:32.711
but if She finds any one of them going astray

00:08:32.912 --> 00:08:36.084
She'll throw that person out and out and out

00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:38.496
and the, another person, if that person is attached

00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:43.543
to that person also will be thrown out. So this business of falling in love,

00:08:43.744 --> 00:08:46.293
this nonsense that we have here, that you fall in love,

00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:49.550
but the word is all right because you fall really in love.

00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:51.891
It's a real falling happens.

00:08:53.243 --> 00:08:56.002
So what happens when you start falling in love,

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:59.315
there's a kind of a maya of this Mahakali

00:08:59.516 --> 00:09:02.836
and you just get infatuated, your ego gets pampered,

00:09:03.037 --> 00:09:06.336
or something like that, or you have certain ideas of a wife

00:09:06.537 --> 00:09:10.138
or something and then you think 'Oh, that's the one for me.'

00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:15.220
So in these cases only two things can happen;

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.369
either you can be lost completely because of

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.636
your wife or your husband whom you adore and admire

00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:26.226
and you, you've finished, I mean your personality is finished.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.130
Or else, the another thing which is even more serious is that,

00:09:32.331 --> 00:09:35.331
that you'll completely break forever and hate each other.

00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:39.633
That's why they say that there's a love and hate relationship.

00:09:39.834 --> 00:09:42.435
How can love be hate?

00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:49.406
But it becomes, because of the, this quality of the Goddess

00:09:49.607 --> 00:09:53.304
that She is on one side extremely loving,

00:09:53.505 --> 00:09:57.473
extremely kind, extremely soft,

00:09:57.673 --> 00:10:00.142
she goes up to a point.

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.847
And then She throws you on the other side,

00:10:04.048 --> 00:10:08.331
and that is why in these countries where people always fall in love, you see,

00:10:08.532 --> 00:10:13.304
they don't marry otherwise, unless and until they have fallen in love.

00:10:13.657 --> 00:10:16.457
In that they cross all the maryadas also.

00:10:17.394 --> 00:10:19.662
In falling in love they will marry somebody

00:10:19.863 --> 00:10:24.045
who is already married or who is, they'll carry on with somebody

00:10:24.246 --> 00:10:28.698
who is not yet divorced

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:33.655
or also they will have marriages, er, among themselves

00:10:33.855 --> 00:10:36.465
in the same household or something.

00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:38.564
All kinds of things they do and the old woman

00:10:38.765 --> 00:10:42.100
marries a young man or a young, er,

00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:44.202
old man marries a young girl, like that,

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.378
all nonsensical things, without any maryadas.

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:50.831
And they do not stick together, they have no maryadas.

00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:57.214
To marry is to create a maryada, maryada of your behaviour

00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:59.999
and this is the maryada which, if you do not keep,

00:11:00.258 --> 00:11:04.275
er, keep, then this Mahakali gets into it.

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:07.783
So first of all one has to be collective,

00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:09.320
the ones who are not collective,

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:13.150
who do not attend every time a collective programme.

00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:14.869
You might give suggestions,

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.577
that you would like to come for such and such thing.

00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:20.411
For example, I have already explained,

00:11:20.612 --> 00:11:23.379
that you shouldn't talk, put my,

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.637
there are so many tapes which they have not, never heard.

00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:30.067
List...let them listen to my tape then go into meditation

00:11:30.268 --> 00:11:32.793
and then do the aarti and finish it off.

00:11:32.994 --> 00:11:36.011
Because these tapes are to be heard again and again.

00:11:36.212 --> 00:11:40.737
Now those who get any questions out of those tapes

00:11:40.938 --> 00:11:44.901
can, next time, discuss it before starting the tapes.

00:11:45.102 --> 00:11:49.571
That's a very good thing and that works. In India nobody speaks,

00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:53.594
they just put my tapes on or show my video,

00:11:53.795 --> 00:11:59.815
after that they just have meditation and aarti. Finished.

00:12:00.016 --> 00:12:03.050
After that nobody talks. But before starting it,

00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:08.245
they do it is to talk to each other and discuss the problems

00:12:08.446 --> 00:12:15.140
or discuss anything that they felt about the previous programme.

00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:17.874
Because you have not come here to marry someone

00:12:18.075 --> 00:12:20.700
or to fall in love into something.

00:12:22.098 --> 00:12:24.437
You have not come here to get after some woman

00:12:24.638 --> 00:12:28.217
because she's your wife or some man because he's your husband.

00:12:28.418 --> 00:12:32.418
You have had so many husbands and wives in previous lives.

00:12:33.543 --> 00:12:36.566
But you have come here for your ascent;

00:12:39.215 --> 00:12:40.806
and if you have come here for your ascent

00:12:41.007 --> 00:12:44.801
you have to keep a watch. How is your mind working?

00:12:45.793 --> 00:12:48.490
Supposing I say that you should have good married life,

00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:52.452
of course, I do say, you should have good married life.

00:12:52.653 --> 00:12:56.106
But not at the cost of losing your ascent.

00:12:58.213 --> 00:13:03.426
It has happened with people, we have lost a complete,

00:13:03.627 --> 00:13:06.012
I should say, a city like that.

00:13:06.213 --> 00:13:09.361
Such stupidity came, comes up over people.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.212
So be careful not to get lost,

00:13:13.413 --> 00:13:17.157
you have not come here to have only a happy married life

00:13:17.358 --> 00:13:21.313
but happy married life is just one step.

00:13:21.514 --> 00:13:24.040
But if that step is taking you away

00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:28.928
from the real path of your ascent is better to be careful.

00:13:33.225 --> 00:13:38.071
Also we must understand the innocence means purity,

00:13:38.272 --> 00:13:40.526
purity of thought. As I explained yesterday

00:13:40.727 --> 00:13:43.722
I hope you understood the meaning of purity.

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:48.781
Purity is to be understood much more by Europeans.

00:13:48.982 --> 00:13:53.982
Very important. Specially French.

00:13:56.739 --> 00:13:59.543
Because the whole society is suffering.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:06.961
Society can only be pure if the family life is pure.

00:14:07.162 --> 00:14:13.078
Not only that but your relations with each other are pure.

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:17.279
Like I was told that somebody fell in love in Ganapatipule.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.989
I mean you go for a pilgrimage.

00:14:20.935 --> 00:14:24.013
It's like you have to go to buy a sari and you

00:14:24.214 --> 00:14:28.815
end up with a shaving stick.

00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:30.651
It's that stupid.

00:14:30.852 --> 00:14:36.068
You are coming to Ganapatipule for a, for what?

00:14:36.732 --> 00:14:48.136
You are coming there for your ascent, it's a pilgrimage.

00:14:48.337 --> 00:14:50.430
But in the pilgrimage I've never heard anybody

00:14:50.643 --> 00:14:55.238
falls in love with each other and goes to marriage.

00:14:55.439 --> 00:14:59.855
So this bhoot of falling in love must be given up in Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:01.841
that is one of the biggest loads.

00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:06.354
And, and must understand that purity means chastity.

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:13.277
Innocence means chastity,

00:15:13.478 --> 00:15:16.908
not only physical also mental chastity.

00:15:19.392 --> 00:15:21.990
You have to have mental chastity,

00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:27.105
if you don't have mental chastity you cannot ascend.

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:35.145
Actually in the West it is more mental that physical, is a fact.

00:15:38.192 --> 00:15:41.731
And that's why their brains (inaudible?) have gone off.

00:15:41.932 --> 00:15:45.565
And they are becoming just like, I think, potatoes now, I think.

00:15:46.206 --> 00:15:49.098
Because if you go on mentally imagining

00:15:49.299 --> 00:15:52.236
and playing around and working it out this way,

00:15:52.437 --> 00:15:54.642
it's going to be absolutely dangerous

00:15:54.843 --> 00:15:58.103
because it's all imagination, it has nothing to do with reality.

00:15:58.304 --> 00:16:00.846
The more you get into this kind of a nonsense

00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:04.023
the more you become away from reality.

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:06.744
That never means you should be dry,

00:16:06.945 --> 00:16:11.094
it never means you should be, er,

00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:14.040
negligent of your responsibility, does not mean.

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:17.692
As I said, the sap...

00:16:31.042 --> 00:16:39.260
As I've said that the sap in the tree rises, all right?

00:16:39.461 --> 00:16:44.424
Then it purifies, it nourishes

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:49.042
every part of the plant separately in a different way.

00:16:49.243 --> 00:16:53.612
Like it's a mother, so mother, father, is a father,

00:16:53.813 --> 00:16:59.172
sister, is a sister, brother, is a sister, brother is a brother.

00:16:59.373 --> 00:17:02.211
The brother-sister relations

00:17:02.412 --> 00:17:08.544
cannot become husband-wife relations. How can it be?

00:17:16.388 --> 00:17:21.304
Now what happens really is that such a confusion in the mind

00:17:21.505 --> 00:17:27.019
and it has created tremendous problems for us.

00:17:29.863 --> 00:17:35.107
Then the sap nourishes all these things and comes back.

00:17:36.631 --> 00:17:39.266
It doesn't get attached to something:

00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:43.094
'Oh, she's my wife so the first priority is my wife.'

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:46.250
Because I've said, of course, family life has to be all right,

00:17:46.451 --> 00:17:48.732
you must look after your family life.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.782
But that doesn't mean that you make everything suffer,

00:17:52.983 --> 00:17:55.842
that doesn't mean that your ascent should be finished.

00:17:56.053 --> 00:17:58.178
Cannot be that.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.868
You are not like ordinary people, you are saints

00:18:02.069 --> 00:18:05.412
and for the saints the main thing is their ascent,

00:18:05.623 --> 00:18:11.047
not their family life, not their material possessions, nothing.

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:14.598
Nor their children, but their ascent, once they ascend

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:18.912
everything will ascend with it.

00:18:24.872 --> 00:18:31.864
Now the understanding of chastity should be there.

00:18:32.124 --> 00:18:35.025
It can come to you very easily if you ascend,

00:18:35.226 --> 00:18:38.234
it's such a vicious circle.

00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:41.091
It is such a vicious circle.

00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:45.292
Now first of all you get your Realization, all right.

00:18:47.331 --> 00:18:53.537
Now you must know that Kundalini itself is the Mahakali shakti

00:18:54.038 --> 00:18:56.167
because she's the primordial.

00:18:56.368 --> 00:19:00.368
Mahakali shakti is the primordial shakti within us.

00:19:00.665 --> 00:19:03.665
And is the Kundalini is the Mahakali shakti.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:09.774
And she remains as a virgin within you.

00:19:09.975 --> 00:19:13.349
Means She's purity, She has a power to purify.

00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:22.845
All that happens when you get your Realization.

00:19:23.127 --> 00:19:28.884
She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects on you.

00:19:31.495 --> 00:19:35.495
Now the one who's sitting there is Shri Ganesh.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.072
Now people don't understand what is innocence is.

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.616
Shri Ganesha is sitting there

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:53.908
and He is the one who resides on mooladhara,

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:57.463
even over his Mother because He's like a guard,

00:19:57.664 --> 00:20:02.611
and He's the one who tells whether She can ascend or not.

00:20:02.812 --> 00:20:08.601
Unless and until He gives permission She cannot ascend.

00:20:09.578 --> 00:20:17.018
So Shri Ganesha gives the ascending sort of, er,

00:20:17.925 --> 00:20:23.778
OK, alright, you can rise.

00:20:23.979 --> 00:20:30.775
And he stops all his work.

00:20:30.975 --> 00:20:34.685
You have seen th... Me, sitting for hours together.

00:20:34.913 --> 00:20:36.475
I don't have to go even to the bathroom

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:40.203
or anywhere because Shri Ganesha stops all his work.

00:20:41.797 --> 00:20:44.971
He's only worried now about the ascent

00:20:45.172 --> 00:20:50.278
and on every chakra he checks your purity,

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.427
and then accordingly the Kundalini tries to purify.

00:20:57.763 --> 00:21:02.360
But when it reaches the mental level,

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:05.524
mental level has all these funny ideas of romance,

00:21:05.725 --> 00:21:08.419
this nonsense, that nonsense.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.515
I was surprised the other day,

00:21:11.716 --> 00:21:14.982
there was a girl who was having a trouble with her husband

00:21:15.183 --> 00:21:18.364
of expressing her love to her husband after marriage;

00:21:18.565 --> 00:21:21.166
before marriage she was all right.

00:21:22.135 --> 00:21:25.935
So I told her: 'Read some book where they have described

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:30.229
the romance between husband and wife'.

00:21:31.363 --> 00:21:33.380
So she said, 'There is no book I have known.'

00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:35.224
Then I asked one professor to find out,

00:21:35.425 --> 00:21:37.358
he said there's no such book.

00:21:41.243 --> 00:21:45.087
In Sahaja Yoga the romance starts after the marriage.

00:21:46.322 --> 00:21:50.760
But also with maryadas, not at the cost of Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:50.961 --> 00:21:53.822
not at the cost, cost of your ascent.

00:21:57.204 --> 00:21:59.546
So all these ideas people have in the West,

00:21:59.742 --> 00:22:01.960
I know you are so much conditioned about it.

00:22:02.133 --> 00:22:04.000
So, you say now let us see,

00:22:04.188 --> 00:22:05.744
this is some (? inaudible word) after all,

00:22:05.945 --> 00:22:08.922
we have to give all the benefit to them.

00:22:10.656 --> 00:22:14.056
Now we select people, we do everything.

00:22:15.744 --> 00:22:18.215
Is all the work of Mahakali

00:22:18.416 --> 00:22:21.098
because you have to work on the vibrations,

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:23.418
it's all the work of Mahakali.

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:27.495
And after marriages also some marriages do fail.

00:22:27.988 --> 00:22:29.529
The reason being they do not know

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.550
what is the purpose of their marriages.

00:22:40.395 --> 00:22:43.168
So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali is that

00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:48.324
She is purity. Absolute purity.

00:22:49.309 --> 00:22:54.521
And that purity if we cannot imbibe within us,

00:22:54.722 --> 00:22:57.722
we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:58.604 --> 00:23:02.981
Now this mind is so much conditioned, I know.

00:23:03.182 --> 00:23:05.307
Our children will be much better off than ourselves.

00:23:06.148 --> 00:23:10.148
Then they won't have these conditionings as we have had.

00:23:11.742 --> 00:23:14.617
And so many problems can be just avoided

00:23:14.818 --> 00:23:17.330
if you really become pure people.

00:23:18.487 --> 00:23:21.205
I see in the other society in which I move,

00:23:21.406 --> 00:23:22.668
nobody seems to be safe,

00:23:22.869 --> 00:23:25.478
somebody's wife is running with somebody's husband,

00:23:25.674 --> 00:23:28.181
somebody's daughter is running with somebody's father,

00:23:28.369 --> 00:23:32.236
somebody's running, a boy running with somebody's mother.

00:23:32.895 --> 00:23:36.769
Next day you find somebody else standing there husband and wife.

00:23:36.981 --> 00:23:40.600
Or sometimes it's so biz...funny that you can't believe it,

00:23:40.803 --> 00:23:45.139
how can it be? And everybody's in danger.

00:23:46.389 --> 00:23:47.715
A man goes to the house,

00:23:47.916 --> 00:23:51.692
he finds his wife run away with another man.

00:23:51.934 --> 00:23:56.495
Or a man goes for his work, he's run away with another woman.

00:23:56.696 --> 00:24:02.250
So the, She, She's the one, She gives you stithi, the state.

00:24:02.469 --> 00:24:05.859
Stithi means consolidation.

00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:13.393
Without your proper consolidation into your purity,

00:24:13.659 --> 00:24:19.238
not into your romantic life, you cannot rise.

00:24:22.012 --> 00:24:24.051
Like when we make the aeroplane,

00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:26.858
first we have to consolidate it.

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:28.944
Fix it up properly, work it out,

00:24:29.145 --> 00:24:31.561
so that when it goes in the air

00:24:31.762 --> 00:24:36.543
all its parts do not fly away with the passengers.

00:24:38.489 --> 00:24:47.047
In the same way when we are ascending Shri Ganesha does that,

00:24:47.248 --> 00:24:52.059
he just stops the action of excretion completely

00:24:52.261 --> 00:24:56.384
and the ascent starts.

00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.986
They are doing their work all right,

00:24:59.186 --> 00:25:01.274
despite the fact they have been insulted,

00:25:01.475 --> 00:25:04.438
they have been neglected, we have misbehaved,

00:25:04.639 --> 00:25:06.688
whatever we might have done,

00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:09.076
they are doing their jobs alright.

00:25:09.295 --> 00:25:12.641
We can see it, so many people getting their Realization.

00:25:12.842 --> 00:25:15.431
But what are we doing about it?

00:25:17.408 --> 00:25:20.884
We cannot be even collective,

00:25:22.994 --> 00:25:26.462
we cannot attend collective things.

00:25:27.202 --> 00:25:29.314
And look at them how generous they are,

00:25:29.515 --> 00:25:33.863
they are extremely collective, they are extremely collective,

00:25:34.064 --> 00:25:40.704
to such an extent to somebody supposing worships Shri Krishna.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.243
His heart will catch.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.229
Why? Because you must also worship Shiva.

00:25:54.401 --> 00:25:58.001
They are so collective and so much connected with Me.

00:26:00.277 --> 00:26:01.998
So they are all collective, in the same way

00:26:02.199 --> 00:26:05.899
you are also devas, you also should be collective.

00:26:08.714 --> 00:26:10.233
As soon as you become collective

00:26:10.434 --> 00:26:13.434
all these nonsensical things will drop out.

00:26:14.224 --> 00:26:17.849
All these ideas will drop out. You do not become collective

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.542
because you have not dropped out all these things,

00:26:21.742 --> 00:26:25.520
or else you are afraid of dropping them out.

00:26:27.404 --> 00:26:29.218
So let us know what is our purpose (is?),

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:32.067
our purpose is to ascend.

00:26:33.482 --> 00:26:36.682
And what is the Mahakali power is doing for us.

00:26:37.761 --> 00:26:41.651
She is giving you your ascent through Kundalini.

00:26:41.878 --> 00:26:49.471
She is purify; She's giving you all the powers.

00:26:49.847 --> 00:26:57.011
She is protecting you all the time, She is giving you joy.

00:26:58.436 --> 00:27:00.133
But what are we doing for Her?

00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:12.695
Her only, only desire is that my children should be saintly,

00:27:12.896 --> 00:27:16.496
that they should have beautiful qualities of a saint.

00:27:17.092 --> 00:27:20.825
That he doesn't fall at every woman, fall at every man.

00:27:21.194 --> 00:27:23.678
It's not so cheap, you see.

00:27:26.952 --> 00:27:28.912
And mentally specially,

00:27:30.944 --> 00:27:33.405
I mean if the Sahasrara is spoilt

00:27:33.606 --> 00:27:35.832
how can Sahaja Yoga work out?

00:27:37.473 --> 00:27:40.473
The whole play is of the Sahasrara.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.981
And that purity should manifest.

00:27:48.182 --> 00:27:52.049
Through you we are going to change the world.

00:27:52.643 --> 00:27:54.247
Through no-one else.

00:27:54.448 --> 00:27:57.848
The Sahaja Yogis who are going to change the world.

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:01.959
Now look at the generosity, when my body is so generous.

00:28:03.956 --> 00:28:07.408
Yesterday one lady came, I think she,

00:28:07.609 --> 00:28:11.471
she had a very bad liver. She came downstairs and I,

00:28:11.672 --> 00:28:15.672
my liver started pumping vibrations, terrible.

00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:20.102
She had a very bad liver though; she had taken drugs,

00:28:20.303 --> 00:28:22.282
I mean she had taken drugs and all that suffering

00:28:22.483 --> 00:28:26.982
was done to me, by this liver of mine.

00:28:27.342 --> 00:28:32.269
It didn't think that 'Oh Mother, she's come all the way out suffering'

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:37.347
so started just pumping for that woman.

00:28:39.074 --> 00:28:44.057
So generous it is. And they are so generous themselves

00:28:44.258 --> 00:28:46.388
the way they bestow blessings (all over?).

00:28:46.589 --> 00:28:50.504
How they are hard working, how they are running about.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.582
What are we giving them?

00:28:58.762 --> 00:29:01.457
They give us joy, they look after us,

00:29:01.658 --> 00:29:05.191
they look after our children, they look after everything,

00:29:05.392 --> 00:29:09.059
they manage everything. Now what are we doing for them?

00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:12.246
Also I've heard that people don't help

00:29:12.447 --> 00:29:14.217
when they have to do postering, they have to do,

00:29:14.418 --> 00:29:18.277
very few people come up.

00:29:18.478 --> 00:29:24.292
This is being ungrateful,
very ungrateful to those.

00:29:24.493 --> 00:29:26.655
All the deities are present

00:29:26.855 --> 00:29:29.987
when you are having those collective programmes.

00:29:32.636 --> 00:29:34.458
And surprisingly the old Sahaja Yogis

00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:38.272
are more difficult than the new ones.

00:29:38.473 --> 00:29:40.860
I mean this I just, surprising.

00:29:41.061 --> 00:29:45.334
I mean are they becoming now out of date or something?

00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:49.485
Christ has said 'First will be the last'.

00:29:49.686 --> 00:29:52.906
I hope that's not going to happen.

00:29:53.107 --> 00:29:54.616
Sort of a confidence they develop,

00:29:54.817 --> 00:29:56.445
'Oh, we are old Sahaja Yogis.'

00:29:56.646 --> 00:30:00.646
We have had a horrible results in London

00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:03.125
of this consciousness that 'We are old,

00:30:03.326 --> 00:30:04.875
we'll do whatever we like.

00:30:05.076 --> 00:30:09.138
We may attend the collective or not.' A kind of a ego.

00:30:11.467 --> 00:30:14.545
Please be careful.

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:18.429
Christ has clearly said 'First will be the last.'

00:30:18.629 --> 00:30:22.835
And I've seen so many of them, just getting out like that,

00:30:23.036 --> 00:30:26.364
even I don't know how they get out.

00:30:29.591 --> 00:30:34.825
In such stupid ways that unimaginable for anyone.

00:30:35.026 --> 00:30:40.583
Like one gentleman in Italy was an old Sahaja Yogi

00:30:40.784 --> 00:30:44.929
just got up and said: 'I am Maha Mataji.'

00:30:45.828 --> 00:30:49.963
Everyone started looking at him. 'What do you mean?'

00:30:50.164 --> 00:30:56.632
'I am Maha Mataji and I'm going to do all this myself.'

00:30:58.102 --> 00:31:01.579
So they said, 'Alright, so we are going out of ashram.'

00:31:01.782 --> 00:31:05.221
'No, no, no, I can't manage the ashram, I'm getting out.'

00:31:05.422 --> 00:31:08.066
And he went and stayed with someone, that lady,

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:14.004
who heard against me and got cancer and died.

00:31:20.869 --> 00:31:23.731
In the collectivity supposing you have one problem,

00:31:23.932 --> 00:31:28.728
another one has some problem. It just works out, balances.

00:31:31.963 --> 00:31:37.850
As one finger is cut out, it is useless

00:31:38.051 --> 00:31:44.582
or a nail which is taken out is useless. It dies.

00:31:45.449 --> 00:31:48.577
So that is how we are organizing

00:31:48.778 --> 00:31:52.473
our spiritual death and ultimately I don't know what else.

00:31:52.674 --> 00:31:54.179
And then they come back that

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.567
'Mother I have got now these troubles so I have come back,

00:31:56.768 --> 00:32:00.307
I was out of Sahaja Yoga for three years.'

00:32:00.508 --> 00:32:02.088
I say: 'What do you mean, out of Sahaja Yoga?'

00:32:02.289 --> 00:32:05.672
'I didn't attend any collective programme.'

00:32:09.352 --> 00:32:12.632
I am thinking of the collectivity of the whole world,

00:32:13.109 --> 00:32:18.322
that's my vision, and if Sahaja Yogis cannot be collective

00:32:18.523 --> 00:32:22.267
who is going to be collective?

00:32:22.468 --> 00:32:25.874
Who is going to fulfill my vision?

00:32:30.829 --> 00:32:35.194
So all of you, those who call themselves Sahaja Yogis,

00:32:35.395 --> 00:32:38.051
must attend the programme.

00:32:39.715 --> 00:32:41.912
And the second thing is that

00:32:42.113 --> 00:32:50.113
there was a little problem of generosity of people.

00:32:50.902 --> 00:32:54.435
Of course that's also is a character of Mahalaxshmi,

00:32:54.655 --> 00:32:57.209
She's very generous.

00:32:57.546 --> 00:33:03.616
And when you are generous in giving vibrations

00:33:04.335 --> 00:33:08.766
and looking after people, this and that,

00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:12.115
then Mahalaxshmi's principle works out.

00:33:12.316 --> 00:33:14.568
But Mahalaxshmi doesn't give money to people

00:33:14.769 --> 00:33:17.855
who are miserly, will never give.

00:33:19.043 --> 00:33:24.664
They may have money in the bank but they can never enjoy.

00:33:27.586 --> 00:33:32.768
So if there is need people have to give money to Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:32.969 --> 00:33:37.328
I have been supplying lot of money, as you know, from the very beginning.

00:33:37.633 --> 00:33:39.135
Those who are early Sahaja Yogis will know

00:33:39.336 --> 00:33:41.536
how much I have been able to pay.

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:45.099
But now we are growing and everybody should know

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:51.690
that we have to pay. After all this is our responsibility.

00:33:51.894 --> 00:33:55.500
Where are we going to spend our money, in what?

00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:58.044
I mean my family feels that, that what,

00:33:58.287 --> 00:34:01.724
whatever money I'm spending for Sahaja Yoga is the best.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.192
They get punyas, is the best for them.

00:34:05.393 --> 00:34:13.393
Only with punyas you get more wealth, health and prosperity.

00:34:13.674 --> 00:34:16.674
If you do not have punyas you cannot get it.

00:34:17.595 --> 00:34:21.852
It will come and go away.

00:34:22.053 --> 00:34:26.365
It will disappear, into thin air.

00:34:29.591 --> 00:34:33.528
So I was surprised that people are not generous.

00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:42.964
We have to know that we are so much better off people

00:34:43.165 --> 00:34:46.165
than many others.

00:34:47.235 --> 00:34:50.143
Like the Eastern Bloc people are not so good

00:34:50.344 --> 00:34:52.203
in money matters just now.

00:34:52.727 --> 00:34:56.714
I'm not saying that we have to help them but we have to think.

00:34:56.922 --> 00:34:59.343
Have we sent something for them as presents?

00:34:59.946 --> 00:35:01.946
Can we do something for them?

00:35:02.548 --> 00:35:07.141
The matter has the value which is again Mahakali's power.

00:35:07.342 --> 00:35:11.295
Is the power of Mahakali,

00:35:11.639 --> 00:35:17.751
that the matter carries the love.

00:35:17.952 --> 00:35:20.454
Expresses.

00:35:23.681 --> 00:35:28.424
So many times I have seen how, very sweetly,

00:35:28.625 --> 00:35:30.307
they gave me something.

00:35:30.508 --> 00:35:34.765
I really don't take anything and I don't need anything

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.653
but certain things which show so such concern,

00:35:37.854 --> 00:35:43.042
such understanding, such love.

00:35:43.909 --> 00:35:46.604
How will you express your love?

00:35:47.956 --> 00:35:51.229
To those people who're so far away.

00:35:54.487 --> 00:36:01.653
You just try, try to give, try to give for Sahaja Yoga also

00:36:01.854 --> 00:36:07.463
and you'll be amazed how it will work out.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:13.202
For collectivity we have to know that Shri Bhairavanath

00:36:13.403 --> 00:36:18.098
and Shri Hanumana and Shri Ganesha,

00:36:18.299 --> 00:36:23.144
these three principles that work within

00:36:23.345 --> 00:36:26.784
us, all of them have parallel work to do, parallel work,

00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:31.073
they do not interfere for each other. But if it comes to help

00:36:31.274 --> 00:36:37.436
they go all out, there's no quarrel.

00:36:37.636 --> 00:36:40.342
No quarrel between the two, no.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.061
If Hanuman needs Bhairava, he is there,

00:36:43.272 --> 00:36:47.412
if Bhairava needs Hanumana he is there, all out.

00:36:48.517 --> 00:36:55.475
So this collectivity comes only by understanding one thing

00:36:55.676 --> 00:36:58.418
what a great work we are doing today,

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:03.034
people are not conscious of that, they take it just by the way.

00:37:03.472 --> 00:37:06.912
In the war you have seen how people fight,

00:37:07.113 --> 00:37:11.464
even if they have the fear of dying.

00:37:11.759 --> 00:37:15.259
Formerly nobody was paid also in the military.

00:37:16.923 --> 00:37:20.104
But they went and fought, maybe for their country,

00:37:20.305 --> 00:37:24.104
for anything. And they used to join together to fight,

00:37:24.305 --> 00:37:27.948
they allowed themselves to be killed, they helped each other,

00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:31.417
they did this, all these qualities are there

00:37:31.618 --> 00:37:34.597
when we want to hate someone.

00:37:34.798 --> 00:37:37.462
But when we want to love someone why shouldn't we help,

00:37:37.674 --> 00:37:40.727
those qualities emerging out of us.

00:37:45.028 --> 00:37:49.491
These are the qualities of Mahakali

00:37:49.692 --> 00:37:53.846
because She is the expert of war affairs.

00:37:55.112 --> 00:37:57.831
She's the One who makes people work

00:37:58.894 --> 00:38:04.187
and She's the One who makes them fight because is the desire.

00:38:04.388 --> 00:38:10.630
They have nothing there, just the desire to do something

00:38:10.831 --> 00:38:17.794
and then they join together and then the Mahasaraswati helps them to act

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:22.302
but first the desire is so strong.

00:38:22.502 --> 00:38:25.119
Now the desire has to be very very strong within us

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.991
that we have to be for the emancipation of the whole world,

00:38:29.195 --> 00:38:31.546
we are the people, we are the special people,

00:38:31.726 --> 00:38:32.679
we are in the (foundation?).

00:38:32.961 --> 00:38:40.105
Nothing else is more important than our own personality

00:38:40.306 --> 00:38:44.839
being completely dedicated for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:46.508 --> 00:38:51.982
This desire has to be extremely strong and very pure.

00:38:53.393 --> 00:38:58.839
Those actually desire it, actually,

00:38:59.191 --> 00:39:01.347
they get their Realization like that,

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:03.393
they reach their depth like that

00:39:03.594 --> 00:39:05.800
and they enjoy doing work of Sah...

00:39:06.001 --> 00:39:09.735
they all the time they enjoy it, for them nothing is more important.

00:39:15.212 --> 00:39:17.191
As we say in, there's a saying that

00:39:17.392 --> 00:39:20.970
when you get the re...water of Ganges to drink,

00:39:21.171 --> 00:39:26.460
why should you take water from dirty, er, rivers?

00:39:28.873 --> 00:39:31.527
So the whole attention is that side,

00:39:32.004 --> 00:39:35.740
the all the joy you get out of this romance and this love,

00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:41.141
and this and that, becomes zero before it because it's Nirananda.

00:39:41.401 --> 00:39:44.244
Only joy.

00:39:44.445 --> 00:39:47.562
In the marriage you see wife says like this, says that,

00:39:47.763 --> 00:39:54.346
er, all this is so conditioning. Any, any joy.

00:39:55.222 --> 00:39:57.771
You have different joys on different centers,

00:39:57.972 --> 00:40:00.099
they are all given by Mahakali,

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.542
but the greatest of all you have got after Realization

00:40:03.831 --> 00:40:09.190
is the Nirananda, that state you must reach, to Nirananda state.

00:40:11.082 --> 00:40:13.894
If you are in that state of Nirananda,

00:40:14.647 --> 00:40:19.420
You are absolutely purified.

00:40:19.799 --> 00:40:23.898
But how to bring the purity.

00:40:24.694 --> 00:40:27.990
Just by developing thoughtless awareness

00:40:28.191 --> 00:40:32.519
and looking at things without thinking.

00:40:35.752 --> 00:40:40.230
For that you have to be collective. If you are collective,

00:40:40.431 --> 00:40:42.720
I am there, wherever you are collective,

00:40:43.009 --> 00:40:46.988
wherever you gather, I am there

00:40:47.189 --> 00:40:49.335
and nothing gives me greater pleasure

00:40:49.568 --> 00:40:53.787
to hear that all of you are attending this programme.

00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:57.707
You'll be amazed that in Australia we have so many

00:40:57.908 --> 00:41:08.017
centers in every, every city but they all attend

00:41:08.218 --> 00:41:13.764
the programmes of collectivity

00:41:13.965 --> 00:41:21.381
because they know collectivity is the ocean of nourishment.

00:41:23.847 --> 00:41:29.450
This is the simplest thing we have to do,

00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:33.655
but the bhoots are much more collective.

00:41:33.856 --> 00:41:39.207
Much more collective. Bhoots can go

00:41:39.408 --> 00:41:43.594
to such a length of fraternity

00:41:43.795 --> 00:41:47.701
that you'll be amazed.

00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:54.394
There was a lady in France only.

00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:58.731
She was an old lady and her daughter was in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:58.931 --> 00:42:02.722
She had become absolutely mad so she put her in the,

00:42:02.923 --> 00:42:04.177
I mean absolutely bhootish,

00:42:04.377 --> 00:42:07.363
and so she put her in a elderly home.

00:42:07.564 --> 00:42:12.183
And in the elderly home she only knew how to go to church on Sundays,

00:42:12.384 --> 00:42:14.088
she would dress up and go to church,

00:42:14.288 --> 00:42:17.210
that's only sensible thing she used to do.

00:42:18.923 --> 00:42:24.227
So she put her in the thing and there was a church,

00:42:24.436 --> 00:42:28.602
and she told me this, her daughter told me that it is very amazing

00:42:28.803 --> 00:42:31.749
that all of them get up in the morning,

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:34.552
dress up well and go to church

00:42:34.753 --> 00:42:37.875
and in the, inside the church there are graves of people

00:42:38.076 --> 00:42:42.555
who have died, out of those, I mean,

00:42:42.755 --> 00:42:47.054
half-mad or full-mad elderly people.

00:42:47.255 --> 00:42:50.589
Otherwise they did not know even how to wear their dresses,

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:54.582
they didn't know how to eat their food, they didn't know anything

00:42:54.783 --> 00:42:57.098
but when it came to going

00:42:57.299 --> 00:43:00.687
to church to that bhootish place where all the bhoots were there,

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.117
they all would get up in the morning, dress up properly

00:43:04.312 --> 00:43:08.393
and go to the church, sit down, sing hymns and come back.

00:43:08.594 --> 00:43:11.688
As if like possessions.

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:15.010
Such a fraternity of bhoots there is.

00:43:15.211 --> 00:43:17.267
As soon as one bhoot comes in,

00:43:17.468 --> 00:43:20.476
one bhoot came now recently from Australia.

00:43:20.694 --> 00:43:23.463
Now he is gathering all the bhoots round here.

00:43:23.664 --> 00:43:28.934
Even to Pune there he gathered, all the bhoots, immediately.

00:43:29.146 --> 00:43:32.968
Then he came here, now he's gathering those bhoots.

00:43:33.169 --> 00:43:34.820
People are getting friendly with him.

00:43:35.021 --> 00:43:38.130
Exactly who are bhoots you can make it out

00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:39.849
by just seeing a bhoot sitting there

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.666
and who is sitting next to that person.

00:43:42.862 --> 00:43:46.028
They are so attracted like a magnet,

00:43:46.229 --> 00:43:49.502
well the magnet is the quality of Mahakali.

00:43:54.276 --> 00:43:58.629
Bhoots know me better than anybody else can know

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:02.759
because they know my past, they are in the past.

00:44:03.025 --> 00:44:06.223
And they know who has got bhoots

00:44:06.424 --> 00:44:08.533
and how they attract each other,

00:44:08.838 --> 00:44:12.829
and how they act on a bhootish person.

00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:20.940
That is why the positive collectivity has to be there.

00:44:22.347 --> 00:44:26.706
But when it comes to positivity they do not get collective.

00:44:27.808 --> 00:44:30.355
All those who do not get collective will gradually

00:44:30.556 --> 00:44:35.628
go into the fraternity of bhoots

00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:38.829
because today we are dealing about Mahakali.

00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:42.470
She is the One who knows everything about these bhootish things,

00:44:42.671 --> 00:44:45.257
she's in charge, I mean.

00:44:45.457 --> 00:44:48.833
She's the Lord of all these bhoots and She knows

00:44:49.034 --> 00:44:52.233
and She looks after then and She manages them.

00:44:52.515 --> 00:44:56.069
But where's, (inaudible word?) want to go into that realm,

00:44:56.335 --> 00:45:00.389
what has She to do?

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.190
She has locked them up on one side

00:45:03.391 --> 00:45:05.515
but Sahaja Yogis want to go there,

00:45:05.719 --> 00:45:09.414
just enter through back doors into that area,

00:45:09.615 --> 00:45:13.154
what can you do?

00:45:14.547 --> 00:45:17.920
Of course She protects, She doesn't want anyone to go there,

00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:20.758
She's just kept them out and told the bhoots

00:45:20.959 --> 00:45:25.953
not to come this side, but Sahaja Yogis only go there.

00:45:26.154 --> 00:45:29.647
That's been reported.

00:45:32.522 --> 00:45:37.875
Under these circumstances, Sahaja Yoga has gone very far,

00:45:38.076 --> 00:45:41.219
very much in so many other countries.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:43.732
In France you have seen yesterday

00:45:43.933 --> 00:45:50.063
how this ananda shakti of the Mother acted on people. '

00:45:50.263 --> 00:45:53.834
It was wonderful to see that, everybody came to me

00:45:54.035 --> 00:45:56.920
and they were full of smiles, I have never seen

00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:00.717
any French woman of that age smiling, never, no question,

00:46:00.918 --> 00:46:03.878
even if you tickled them, even if you certify that

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.818
this is a joke they'll not smile like that.

00:46:08.019 --> 00:46:10.027
I've never seen their teeth.

00:46:10.394 --> 00:46:14.455
Yesterday the whole face was lit up, so many of them,

00:46:14.656 --> 00:46:17.355
something so miraculous it was.

00:46:17.556 --> 00:46:24.925
This anandini shakti of Mahakali was acting so beautifully yesterday

00:46:25.126 --> 00:46:28.199
and you are the people who will now

00:46:28.399 --> 00:46:30.336
guide or misguide them.

00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:34.860
If you become, all of you become,

00:46:35.061 --> 00:46:37.120
higher personalities,

00:46:37.321 --> 00:46:39.929
if you become collective all of you,

00:46:40.129 --> 00:46:42.263
and if you become generous,

00:46:42.471 --> 00:46:46.343
and if you become absolutely pure, they will say

00:46:46.544 --> 00:46:50.921
'Now look at these people, how beautiful they look.'

00:46:51.132 --> 00:46:54.236
You already look very beautiful, your faces shine,

00:46:54.437 --> 00:46:58.437
but it will all disappear.

00:47:00.574 --> 00:47:09.387
And the effects of disappearance are not very simple.

00:47:09.587 --> 00:47:14.385
So be careful, I of course bless you,

00:47:14.586 --> 00:47:22.586
with all the qualities of Bhairava,

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.444
as He is the greatest disciple of Mahakali

00:47:27.645 --> 00:47:29.850
and He is the One who is running up and down,

00:47:30.051 --> 00:47:32.582
morning till evening every time, specially in the night

00:47:32.848 --> 00:47:36.506
He is working so very hard killing these horrible rakshasas,

00:47:36.707 --> 00:47:40.535
this, that,

00:47:42.865 --> 00:47:47.677
and achieving such results.

00:47:47.877 --> 00:47:53.201
We have to join Him, all of us, and work it out.

00:47:53.452 --> 00:47:57.625
May God Bless You.
