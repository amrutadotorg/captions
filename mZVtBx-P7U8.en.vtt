WEBVTT

00:07.930 --> 00:10.399
So, I talk of friendship

00:12.621 --> 00:14.484
- is to have a friend.

00:14.685 --> 00:18.898
If we have worries, we always tell to our
friends

00:18.978 --> 00:22.604
but not to persons of acquaintance.

00:22.685 --> 00:28.624
If you have problems, we'll never tell it
to somebody who we just know by-the-way,

00:28.718 --> 00:32.672
but to our friends, and so friendship.

00:34.805 --> 00:38.985
Even if you are a leader, you are a friend of the people.

00:41.083 --> 00:44.327
Friendship is such that

00:45.826 --> 00:51.013
you could share your secrets,

00:51.222 --> 00:55.761
you could share your problems. You do that with Me.

00:56.535 --> 00:58.535
And why not with each other?

00:59.950 --> 01:07.551
It's a question of understanding that
Sahaja Yogis are all really friends to each other.

01:07.926 --> 01:11.859
I think relationship of friendship is even higher than

01:11.939 --> 01:14.551
any other relationship we could think of,

01:14.632 --> 01:18.249
because there is nothing to be gained out of our friendship.

01:18.944 --> 01:24.727
It never ceases and you just enjoy the friendship, that's all.

01:25.404 --> 01:28.821
Then you can pull each other's legs, sometimes.

01:30.334 --> 01:36.083
You could be little joking with another person,

01:36.284 --> 01:40.937
making fun of another person. It's all right, it's friendship.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.228
But this is the purest form

01:45.429 --> 01:49.985
of understanding our relationships with each other.

01:51.828 --> 01:59.570
And a friend is the one who is always,

01:59.770 --> 02:04.917
for no rhyme and reason, concerned about his friend.

02:06.014 --> 02:10.334
Before Sahaja Yoga, you could have only one friend

02:11.770 --> 02:15.546
or at the most two. Three meant a crowd,

02:15.747 --> 02:18.979
cannot have three persons as your friends.

02:19.543 --> 02:25.998
But in Sahaja Yoga we are all friends, pure friendship.

02:26.464 --> 02:31.284
Friendship of a very beautiful nature

02:31.722 --> 02:37.041
- that you enjoy the joy of another person.

02:38.299 --> 02:40.369
In vibrations you do.

02:42.033 --> 02:46.228
If you feel the vibrations of another Sahaja Yogi, you really enjoy.

02:52.930 --> 02:56.945
I have seen this kind of friendship

02:57.626 --> 03:03.610
when we were young because that
time people were more open hearted

03:03.810 --> 03:06.781
as my father had his friends.

03:09.547 --> 03:13.804
He was a very orthodox Brahmin, a friend of his

03:14.004 --> 03:20.370
and he was the chairman of an
organization all over the country.

03:20.571 --> 03:26.399
And the school that, one of the schools where I was studying,

03:27.555 --> 03:31.699
that organization was running.
So, he was the big boss in that school.

03:32.413 --> 03:39.930
So, My father had to go for a case
far away and he took all his family

03:40.027 --> 03:42.419
and he sent Me to the hostel.

03:42.620 --> 03:48.942
He wrote to his friend that, "I'm going away
and my daughter has to appear for her final exams.

03:49.023 --> 03:55.550
But I'm sorry I had to go, taking my family
with me. But this is a nice chance."

03:55.736 --> 03:59.160
So, the friend wrote, "All right,
doesn't matter. You can go away.

03:59.241 --> 04:01.735
I'm going to look after your daughter."

04:01.816 --> 04:04.903
He came down and he stayed in the hostel.

04:04.984 --> 04:08.688
Took a room there in the hostel.
We all were there.

04:09.182 --> 04:12.489
He was a Brahmin, he would
not touch an egg. He was a Brahmin.

04:12.690 --> 04:17.953
But he knew that I eat eggs and I am a non-veg.

04:18.573 --> 04:22.486
So, this was about summertime had started.

04:22.687 --> 04:29.362
But he would still put on his
overcoat or a raincoat and walk out.

04:29.662 --> 04:33.949
I don't know from where he used to get eggs in the morning,

04:34.145 --> 04:37.973
bring it in his room because it was a Brahmin school,

04:38.363 --> 04:44.863
and secretly cook the eggs
for Me, and then he would call Me,

04:44.944 --> 04:47.650
and give Me the eggs to eat. I said,
"I don't need them."

04:47.730 --> 04:49.108
"No, no, no you have to have.

04:49.189 --> 04:52.672
You know, Your father has gone
away, I have to look after You." So sweetly!

04:52.873 --> 05:01.308
And he was the head of heads there, breaking his own
rules and regulations for Me that he was making non-veg food.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.170
And then he would take all the,

05:04.370 --> 05:09.836
see, shells of the eggs in a paper,

05:10.037 --> 05:17.406
put it in the pocket in a big overcoat,
walked out and throw them somewhere.

05:19.323 --> 05:23.849
Then he would come with Me to leave Me for My exams.

05:24.050 --> 05:27.284
Evening again, he was there, waiting for Me.

05:27.533 --> 05:31.544
He was such a big man, such a
great man, very much respected.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.230
I mean, he was the head of the heads.

05:34.804 --> 05:40.242
In friendship one can really enjoy!

05:40.443 --> 05:45.406
You need a very large heart
to be a friend, very large heart.

05:46.132 --> 05:51.938
If you look after your own child, support your
own child then you are a gone case for Sahaja Yoga,

05:52.776 --> 05:58.346
but if you have that kind of a largeness of friendship.

06:00.431 --> 06:04.331
There is a nice story My father used to tell us about friends

06:04.518 --> 06:07.772
because My brother was, had lots of friends,

06:07.973 --> 06:11.417
they used to go about gallivanting, this, that.

06:11.633 --> 06:18.198
And then used to always criticize
that what father your friends come in.

06:18.399 --> 06:23.564
They just look after your lawn sometimes
because somebody is fond of lawn.

06:23.765 --> 06:27.433
Then another does that. And you don't people discuss,

06:27.633 --> 06:31.796
argue anything - just, I don't know
how you enjoy each other's company.

06:32.001 --> 06:36.624
He said, "No, we talk, it's not that.
No, no, we enjoy very much."

06:37.091 --> 06:40.935
So, My father told him, "All right, I will tell you a story".

06:41.181 --> 06:46.983
That there was a father who had
a friend and the son had a friend.

06:47.374 --> 06:52.467
Modern times, I mean modern
these days is also old times, I should say.

06:52.668 --> 06:57.919
So, the father said to the son that,

06:58.119 --> 07:01.717
"You see, friendship is where,

07:01.917 --> 07:07.774
you can always rely on your
friend and your friend can rely on you."

07:10.722 --> 07:14.865
He said, "Really?" "Yes", he said so.

07:15.066 --> 07:17.785
"Oh, my friends I can rely",

07:19.104 --> 07:25.495
the boy said, "I can rely on my
friends". He said "Really?" "Yes."

07:26.145 --> 07:33.537
So, father said, "All right, let's
test your friends and my friends."

07:33.738 --> 07:37.049
So, they went down, they asked.

07:37.771 --> 07:43.272
The father went with the son,
and went to these friends of the son.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.678
And the son thought

07:47.567 --> 07:53.472
- he told the son that, "You have to say
that I have murdered someone and help me."

07:53.948 --> 07:55.766
He said, "All right".

07:56.509 --> 08:01.655
So, they went to one friend.

08:01.888 --> 08:06.134
That friend said, "You murdered?
Baba, you get out!" He closed the door.

08:06.525 --> 08:08.817
Another one they went to, he closed the door.

08:09.018 --> 08:13.805
Third one he said, "No, no don't say that you have
come to my house. I have nothing to do with you."

08:14.006 --> 08:16.849
All his twenty friends said, "No".

08:17.229 --> 08:21.986
He said, "All right, now let me go to
one friend of mine." They went there.

08:22.762 --> 08:25.956
So, they knocked at the door,
knocked at the door. Door would not open.

08:26.157 --> 08:31.559
Then he shouted, "I am here." So, the boy started
saying, "Look at this. Your friend is not even coming."

08:31.760 --> 08:34.395
He said, "No, no, no, just wait and see."

08:34.695 --> 08:41.322
So, about ten minutes later the friend came and
opened the door, and took him inside. "What's the matter?"

08:42.170 --> 08:47.941
He said, "You know I have murdered somebody" -
the father said - "and so we have come to you for help".

08:48.142 --> 08:55.578
"I knew something must be there
because why will you come at this hour?

08:55.904 --> 08:59.568
So, I was collecting all the ornaments of my wife.

08:59.775 --> 09:04.840
I mean, if you need money, I better give
you the ornaments. So, that's why I was late."

09:05.041 --> 09:08.633
"But", he said, "if you have murdered, it doesn't matter.

09:08.951 --> 09:11.010
Now, you've got children, I don't have.

09:11.091 --> 09:13.063
So, you better tell them I have murdered.

09:13.143 --> 09:17.355
Tell me how the murder took place,
I'll take the murder upon myself."

09:17.535 --> 09:20.453
And the son was surprised.

09:20.755 --> 09:22.648
He said, "No, take this."

09:23.388 --> 09:26.500
Then the father said, "See now, this is my friend.

09:26.701 --> 09:30.474
You had twenty friends and I have only one friend.

09:30.675 --> 09:35.974
This is his friendship." And this kind of a
friendship, we Sahaja Yogis should have.

09:36.238 --> 09:40.655
I mean with a friend you cannot be tense.
Cannot be.

09:41.584 --> 09:48.052
That is first sign. And with your friend sitting
there, you won't doze off, and you won't sleep.

09:48.627 --> 09:50.627
But you enjoy.

09:50.886 --> 09:58.371
Once I was traveling by train and we had two compartments.

09:58.637 --> 10:01.972
So, in one compartment myself and one old lady were there.

10:02.173 --> 10:06.225
I mean, I was older than her but she though she was older.

10:07.043 --> 10:10.993
And she was trying to sleep.

10:11.364 --> 10:17.124
And in the other compartment were two friends.
They had met. Ahh! So they were enjoying.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.733
He was hitting him and he was hitting him.

10:19.933 --> 10:22.618
He said, "Aye, you!" And like that going on.

10:22.819 --> 10:26.640
So, this lady said, "Look at these people.
They are not allowing us to sleep."

10:26.841 --> 10:31.080
So she went and shouted at
them, "Will you stop this nonsense?

10:31.161 --> 10:35.407
What is going on?" He said, "We have met
after a long time, you see, so, we are enjoying."

10:35.488 --> 10:41.041
She said, "This is not the way. Why are you hitting each
other if you are enjoying? And don't talk loudly." She went away.

10:41.122 --> 10:43.613
Then I went and said, "Now, you shout. I am here.

10:43.813 --> 10:46.963
Don't say anything. I'll lock
the door. This lady won't come."

10:47.164 --> 10:51.141
They were surprised. I said, "I am
enjoying the way you are enjoying each other."

10:51.342 --> 10:55.696
They said, "You don't want to sleep?"
"No, no, I want to hear what you say to each other."

10:55.923 --> 10:58.523
And they were surprised how I was enjoying

10:58.603 --> 11:02.249
the way they were hitting each other
and enjoying each other.

11:03.752 --> 11:05.496
So, this is how,

11:06.532 --> 11:10.117
I have to tell you that we have to be friends.

11:10.274 --> 11:14.155
We have to share, enjoy sharing.

11:14.467 --> 11:19.363
There is no seriousness about it.
How can you be serious with your friend?

11:19.564 --> 11:23.602
Just relaxed enjoying each other's company.

11:23.803 --> 11:27.856
Even if you have to argue - argue, doesn't matter.

11:28.057 --> 11:30.962
Even if you have a different view, it's all right.

11:31.163 --> 11:37.335
But, you should not try to impose yourself on your friend,

11:37.536 --> 11:41.661
nor your friend should try to impose.
But try to understand each other.

11:43.487 --> 11:46.044
That's how we are going to learn such a lot.

11:46.245 --> 11:49.208
You have to learn such a lot from each other.

11:49.409 --> 11:53.424
For example, I learnt so much from French
you'll be surprised.

11:53.547 --> 11:58.002
Learnt lot of things from French,
the way they have their art,

11:58.203 --> 12:02.672
their ideas of art, their music, their culture.

12:02.873 --> 12:05.012
Lots of things to be learnt.

12:05.724 --> 12:09.097
So, you have friends in India,
you have friends everywhere,

12:09.177 --> 12:12.169
you have friends now in South America.

12:13.290 --> 12:20.003
Everywhere you have friends.
You just go ahead with My badge. Finished.

12:20.204 --> 12:23.672
Oh! They will all jump for you,
they will do anything for you.

12:25.882 --> 12:27.786
So, this friendship,

12:28.436 --> 12:33.766
just think of it in this world we have
thousands and thousands of friends,

12:33.966 --> 12:36.273
everywhere we go.

12:37.425 --> 12:41.690
And this is what we have to know within ourselves

12:41.891 --> 12:49.344
that we have to be ourselves
very, very friendly type, very friendly.

12:49.545 --> 12:53.936
There is an openness between one friend and another friend.

12:54.137 --> 12:59.608
There is no closeness. There is no tension.
There is no formality.

13:00.324 --> 13:02.208
And reliance.

13:02.408 --> 13:08.253
So much so that you can talk to them about what you want,

13:08.566 --> 13:14.647
what is your need and what problems you have.

13:16.752 --> 13:23.128
I hope you understand that love means
complete freedom,

13:23.566 --> 13:25.970
to yourself and to others.

13:26.642 --> 13:32.926
If you love someone, then there is
complete freedom and understanding.

13:33.127 --> 13:36.262
But this love has to be very, very pure.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.444
Complete understanding.

13:39.144 --> 13:46.151
You have to feel that friendship.

13:46.364 --> 13:50.248
And, you will feel very proud
that you have so many friends.

13:50.449 --> 13:54.738
And real friends! You have so many friends
who are real friends.

13:55.143 --> 13:56.933
You will be so very -

14:01.722 --> 14:07.853
feeling a thing as if you
are a great personality

14:08.570 --> 14:12.232
that you have so many friends in this world.

14:13.079 --> 14:14.983
You are not alone.

14:15.330 --> 14:23.651
Imagine before this what we had, so
many saints, so many great souls were born

14:24.507 --> 14:29.944
and they were treated like singular people

14:30.710 --> 14:34.365
and tortured, killed, poisoned.

14:34.566 --> 14:36.566
They were alone.

14:38.243 --> 14:40.243
But you are not.

14:41.174 --> 14:45.498
You are all - are friends to each other

14:45.699 --> 14:50.370
and the greatest friend you have is the Divine power,

14:50.670 --> 14:55.050
which is looking after you and doing everything for you.

14:55.803 --> 15:05.132
So, when you meet a friend, you know,
how you feel like just taking him to your heart,

15:07.019 --> 15:10.620
just embracing.

15:10.700 --> 15:16.780
And you don’t know what to do with that. And
sometimes it’s so much that you feel like beating.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.213
Beating yourself or beating the friend.

15:21.293 --> 15:26.714
That sort of a joy is Ahlada Dayini: that is Radha.

15:26.794 --> 15:33.620
So, today let us now – the power of joy, we have to worship

15:33.700 --> 15:41.633
the power of joy and this power of joy which is Ahlada Dayini.
