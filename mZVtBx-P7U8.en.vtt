00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.399
So, I talk of friendship

00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:14.484
- is to have a friend.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:18.898
If we have worries, we always tell to our
friends

00:00:18.978 --> 00:00:22.604
but not to persons of acquaintance.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:28.624
If you have problems, we'll never tell it
to somebody who we just know by-the-way,

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:32.672
but to our friends, and so friendship.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:38.985
Even if you are a leader, you are a friend of the people.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:44.327
Friendship is such that

00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:51.013
you could share your secrets,

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:55.761
you could share your problems. You do that with Me.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:58.535
And why not with each other?

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.551
It's a question of understanding that
Sahaja Yogis are all really friends to each other.

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:11.859
I think relationship of friendship is even higher than

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.551
any other relationship we could think of,

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:18.249
because there is nothing to be gained out of our friendship.

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:24.727
It never ceases and you just enjoy the friendship, that's all.

00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:28.821
Then you can pull each other's legs, sometimes.

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:36.083
You could be little joking with another person,

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:40.937
making fun of another person. It's all right, it's friendship.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.228
But this is the purest form

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.985
of understanding our relationships with each other.

00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:59.570
And a friend is the one who is always,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.917
for no rhyme and reason, concerned about his friend.

00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:10.334
Before Sahaja Yoga, you could have only one friend

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.546
or at the most two. Three meant a crowd,

00:02:15.747 --> 00:02:18.979
cannot have three persons as your friends.

00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:25.998
But in Sahaja Yoga we are all friends, pure friendship.

00:02:26.464 --> 00:02:31.284
Friendship of a very beautiful nature

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:37.041
- that you enjoy the joy of another person.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.369
In vibrations you do.

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:46.228
If you feel the vibrations of another Sahaja Yogi, you really enjoy.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.945
I have seen this kind of friendship

00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:03.610
when we were young because that
time people were more open hearted

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.781
as my father had his friends.

00:03:09.547 --> 00:03:13.804
He was a very orthodox Brahmin, a friend of his

00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:20.370
and he was the chairman of an
organization all over the country.

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:26.399
And the school that, one of the schools where I was studying,

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:31.699
that organization was running. 
So, he was the big boss in that school.

00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:39.930
So, My father had to go for a case
far away and he took all his family

00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:42.419
and he sent Me to the hostel.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.942
He wrote to his friend that, "I'm going away
and my daughter has to appear for her final exams.

00:03:49.023 --> 00:03:55.550
But I'm sorry I had to go, taking my family 
with me. But this is a nice chance."

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:59.160
So, the friend wrote, "All right,
doesn't matter. You can go away.

00:03:59.241 --> 00:04:01.735
I'm going to look after your daughter."

00:04:01.816 --> 00:04:04.903
He came down and he stayed in the hostel.

00:04:04.984 --> 00:04:08.688
Took a room there in the hostel. 
We all were there.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:12.489
He was a Brahmin, he would
not touch an egg. He was a Brahmin.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.953
But he knew that I eat eggs and I am a non-veg.

00:04:18.573 --> 00:04:22.486
So, this was about summertime had started.

00:04:22.687 --> 00:04:29.362
But he would still put on his
overcoat or a raincoat and walk out.

00:04:29.662 --> 00:04:33.949
I don't know from where he used to get eggs in the morning,

00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:37.973
bring it in his room because it was a Brahmin school,

00:04:38.363 --> 00:04:44.863
and secretly cook the eggs
for Me, and then he would call Me,

00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:47.650
and give Me the eggs to eat. I said,
"I don't need them."

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.108
"No, no, no you have to have.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.672
You know, Your father has gone
away, I have to look after You." So sweetly!

00:04:52.873 --> 00:05:01.308
And he was the head of heads there, breaking his own
rules and regulations for Me that he was making non-veg food.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.170
And then he would take all the,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.836
see, shells of the eggs in a paper,

00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:17.406
put it in the pocket in a big overcoat,
walked out and throw them somewhere.

00:05:19.323 --> 00:05:23.849
Then he would come with Me to leave Me for My exams.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.284
Evening again, he was there, waiting for Me.

00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:31.544
He was such a big man, such a
great man, very much respected.

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:34.230
I mean, he was the head of the heads.

00:05:34.804 --> 00:05:40.242
In friendship one can really enjoy!

00:05:40.443 --> 00:05:45.406
You need a very large heart
to be a friend, very large heart.

00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:51.938
If you look after your own child, support your
own child then you are a gone case for Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:58.346
but if you have that kind of a largeness of friendship.

00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:04.331
There is a nice story My father used to tell us about friends

00:06:04.518 --> 00:06:07.772
because My brother was, had lots of friends,

00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:11.417
they used to go about gallivanting, this, that.

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:18.198
And then used to always criticize
that what father your friends come in.

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:23.564
They just look after your lawn sometimes
because somebody is fond of lawn.

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:27.433
Then another does that. And you don't people discuss,

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:31.796
argue anything - just, I don't know
how you enjoy each other's company.

00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:36.624
He said, "No, we talk, it's not that. 
No, no, we enjoy very much."

00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:40.935
So, My father told him, "All right, I will tell you a story".

00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:46.983
That there was a father who had
a friend and the son had a friend.

00:06:47.374 --> 00:06:52.467
Modern times, I mean modern
these days is also old times, I should say.

00:06:52.668 --> 00:06:57.919
So, the father said to the son that,

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:01.717
"You see, friendship is where,

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:07.774
you can always rely on your
friend and your friend can rely on you."

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:14.865
He said, "Really?" "Yes", he said so.

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:17.785
"Oh, my friends I can rely",

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:25.495
the boy said, "I can rely on my
friends". He said "Really?" "Yes."

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:33.537
So, father said, "All right, let's
test your friends and my friends."

00:07:33.738 --> 00:07:37.049
So, they went down, they asked.

00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:43.272
The father went with the son,
and went to these friends of the son.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:46.678
And the son thought

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:53.472
- he told the son that, "You have to say
that I have murdered someone and help me."

00:07:53.948 --> 00:07:55.766
He said, "All right".

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:01.655
So, they went to one friend.

00:08:01.888 --> 00:08:06.134
That friend said, "You murdered?
Baba, you get out!" He closed the door.

00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:08.817
Another one they went to, he closed the door.

00:08:09.018 --> 00:08:13.805
Third one he said, "No, no don't say that you have
come to my house. I have nothing to do with you."

00:08:14.006 --> 00:08:16.849
All his twenty friends said, "No".

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:21.986
He said, "All right, now let me go to
one friend of mine." They went there.

00:08:22.762 --> 00:08:25.956
So, they knocked at the door,
knocked at the door. Door would not open.

00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:31.559
Then he shouted, "I am here." So, the boy started
saying, "Look at this. Your friend is not even coming."

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.395
He said, "No, no, no, just wait and see."

00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:41.322
So, about ten minutes later the friend came and
opened the door, and took him inside. "What's the matter?"

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:47.941
He said, "You know I have murdered somebody" -
the father said - "and so we have come to you for help".

00:08:48.142 --> 00:08:55.578
"I knew something must be there
because why will you come at this hour?

00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:59.568
So, I was collecting all the ornaments of my wife.

00:08:59.775 --> 00:09:04.840
I mean, if you need money, I better give
you the ornaments. So, that's why I was late."

00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:08.633
"But", he said, "if you have murdered, it doesn't matter.

00:09:08.951 --> 00:09:11.010
Now, you've got children, I don't have.

00:09:11.091 --> 00:09:13.063
So, you better tell them I have murdered.

00:09:13.143 --> 00:09:17.355
Tell me how the murder took place, 
I'll take the murder upon myself."

00:09:17.535 --> 00:09:20.453
And the son was surprised.

00:09:20.755 --> 00:09:22.648
He said, "No, take this."

00:09:23.388 --> 00:09:26.500
Then the father said, "See now, this is my friend.

00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:30.474
You had twenty friends and I have only one friend.

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:35.974
This is his friendship." And this kind of a
friendship, we Sahaja Yogis should have.

00:09:36.238 --> 00:09:40.655
I mean with a friend you cannot be tense. 
Cannot be.

00:09:41.584 --> 00:09:48.052
That is first sign. And with your friend sitting
there, you won't doze off, and you won't sleep.

00:09:48.627 --> 00:09:50.627
But you enjoy.

00:09:50.886 --> 00:09:58.371
Once I was traveling by train and we had two compartments.

00:09:58.637 --> 00:10:01.972
So, in one compartment myself and one old lady were there.

00:10:02.173 --> 00:10:06.225
I mean, I was older than her but she though she was older.

00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:10.993
And she was trying to sleep.

00:10:11.364 --> 00:10:17.124
And in the other compartment were two friends.
They had met. Ahh! So they were enjoying.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:19.733
He was hitting him and he was hitting him.

00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:22.618
He said, "Aye, you!" And like that going on.

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:26.640
So, this lady said, "Look at these people.
They are not allowing us to sleep."

00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:31.080
So she went and shouted at
them, "Will you stop this nonsense?

00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:35.407
What is going on?" He said, "We have met
after a long time, you see, so, we are enjoying."

00:10:35.488 --> 00:10:41.041
She said, "This is not the way. Why are you hitting each
other if you are enjoying? And don't talk loudly." She went away.

00:10:41.122 --> 00:10:43.613
Then I went and said, "Now, you shout. I am here.

00:10:43.813 --> 00:10:46.963
Don't say anything. I'll lock
the door. This lady won't come."

00:10:47.164 --> 00:10:51.141
They were surprised. I said, "I am
enjoying the way you are enjoying each other."

00:10:51.342 --> 00:10:55.696
They said, "You don't want to sleep?"
"No, no, I want to hear what you say to each other."

00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:58.523
And they were surprised how I was enjoying

00:10:58.603 --> 00:11:02.249
the way they were hitting each other 
and enjoying each other.

00:11:03.752 --> 00:11:05.496
So, this is how,

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:10.117
I have to tell you that we have to be friends.

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:14.155
We have to share, enjoy sharing.

00:11:14.467 --> 00:11:19.363
There is no seriousness about it.
How can you be serious with your friend?

00:11:19.564 --> 00:11:23.602
Just relaxed enjoying each other's company.

00:11:23.803 --> 00:11:27.856
Even if you have to argue - argue, doesn't matter.

00:11:28.057 --> 00:11:30.962
Even if you have a different view, it's all right.

00:11:31.163 --> 00:11:37.335
But, you should not try to impose yourself on your friend,

00:11:37.536 --> 00:11:41.661
nor your friend should try to impose. 
But try to understand each other.

00:11:43.487 --> 00:11:46.044
That's how we are going to learn such a lot.

00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:49.208
You have to learn such a lot from each other.

00:11:49.409 --> 00:11:53.424
For example, I learnt so much from French 
you'll be surprised.

00:11:53.547 --> 00:11:58.002
Learnt lot of things from French, 
the way they have their art,

00:11:58.203 --> 00:12:02.672
their ideas of art, their music, their culture.

00:12:02.873 --> 00:12:05.012
Lots of things to be learnt.

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:09.097
So, you have friends in India, 
you have friends everywhere,

00:12:09.177 --> 00:12:12.169
you have friends now in South America.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:20.003
Everywhere you have friends.
You just go ahead with My badge. Finished.

00:12:20.204 --> 00:12:23.672
Oh! They will all jump for you, 
they will do anything for you.

00:12:25.882 --> 00:12:27.786
So, this friendship,

00:12:28.436 --> 00:12:33.766
just think of it in this world we have
thousands and thousands of friends,

00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:36.273
everywhere we go.

00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:41.690
And this is what we have to know within ourselves

00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:49.344
that we have to be ourselves
very, very friendly type, very friendly.

00:12:49.545 --> 00:12:53.936
There is an openness between one friend and another friend.

00:12:54.137 --> 00:12:59.608
There is no closeness. There is no tension. 
There is no formality.

00:13:00.324 --> 00:13:02.208
And reliance.

00:13:02.408 --> 00:13:08.253
So much so that you can talk to them about what you want,

00:13:08.566 --> 00:13:14.647
what is your need and what problems you have.

00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:23.128
I hope you understand that love means
complete freedom,

00:13:23.566 --> 00:13:25.970
to yourself and to others.

00:13:26.642 --> 00:13:32.926
If you love someone, then there is
complete freedom and understanding.

00:13:33.127 --> 00:13:36.262
But this love has to be very, very pure.

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.444
Complete understanding.

00:13:39.144 --> 00:13:46.151
You have to feel that friendship.

00:13:46.364 --> 00:13:50.248
And, you will feel very proud 
that you have so many friends.

00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:54.738
And real friends! You have so many friends 
who are real friends.

00:13:55.143 --> 00:13:56.933
You will be so very -

00:14:01.722 --> 00:14:07.853
feeling a thing as if you
are a great personality

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.232
that you have so many friends in this world.

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:14.983
You are not alone.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:23.651
Imagine before this what we had, so
many saints, so many great souls were born

00:14:24.507 --> 00:14:29.944
and they were treated like singular people

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.365
and tortured, killed, poisoned.

00:14:34.566 --> 00:14:36.566
They were alone.

00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:40.243
But you are not.

00:14:41.174 --> 00:14:45.498
You are all - are friends to each other

00:14:45.699 --> 00:14:50.370
and the greatest friend you have is the Divine power,

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.050
which is looking after you and doing everything for you.

00:14:55.803 --> 00:15:05.132
So, when you meet a friend, you know,
how you feel like just taking him to your heart,

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:10.620
just embracing.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:16.780
And you don’t know what to do with that. And
sometimes it’s so much that you feel like beating.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.213
Beating yourself or beating the friend.

00:15:21.293 --> 00:15:26.714
That sort of a joy is Ahlada Dayini: that is Radha.

00:15:26.794 --> 00:15:33.620
So, today let us now – the power of joy, we have to worship

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:41.633
the power of joy and this power of joy which is Ahlada Dayini.
