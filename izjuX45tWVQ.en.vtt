00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:30.340
This was least expected that we'll have a
Puja here or we'll have any program of this

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.340
kind.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:43.919
But I think something was left out of the
whole program of such a fast one as you know

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:52.380
I had to do, going from London to Frankfurt
to America to Bogota, to be back, then Andorra

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.620
and all these places still, I thought, now
it is finished.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:08.040
And I came here in London I learned that there
was one Puja was not done it is left Vishuddhi,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:19.740
and that coincides with this Raksha Bandhan
because it is the sister relationship

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.740
and brother relationship.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:31.890
So in the history, if you go, Shri Krishna
was born the day his sister was born, and

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:44.300
this Vishnumaya was transferred from, transformed
I should say, into a lightning later on, but

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:54.819
She was the one who announced the existence
of Shri Krishna at that time - that He is

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:56.560
born and He is living, He is in the present.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:05.889
This is the job of the left Vishuddhi, of
the lightning, and you have seen that whenever

00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:12.560
I am going to any place, or I will be giving
a program or something, just before that,

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.700
the lightning, the thunder, all this appears
in the sky, you see, to show that announcement.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:25.680
So it is one of the things that is used for
announcement.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:36.810
To make it more practical and understanding
is that we use electricity now for our televisions,

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:43.700
for our announcements, for telling people
about messages of something of great importance.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.440
I don't know if they do it, might not be.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:55.150
In the same way we should use our left Vishuddhi
for the announcement of the coming of Adi

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.150
Shakti.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:04.230
But on the contrary, people start using it
as a pocket kept for our extra ego to be filled.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:15.660
When we feel guilty, firstly we feel guilty
when our sense of relationships are not all

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.660
right.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:27.790
For example, we do not understand a sister
and a brother, the relationship, which is

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:39.250
very pure, and is above all kinds of contamination.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:47.680
But as you know in the West, because maybe
of drinking and doing all kinds of things

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.370
which are against awareness, people have lost
the value system, and in that they have also

00:09:54.370 --> 00:10:01.690
lost the system to understand what is a sister
and what is a brother.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:06.500
So Vishnumaya is so important - extremely
important - because of Her, announcement of

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.680
an incarnation takes place.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:23.880
It's, you can say, in the cosmos that is the
television that announces.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.130
It works it out.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:33.290
But in our own being Vishnumaya it resides
in the left Vishuddhi, and I find that Vishnumaya

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:40.040
is the thing that suffers the most, especially
in the West, because it's a fashion to feel

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.230
guilty about everything.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:53.620
Normally, say when Vishnumaya Herself announced
that Shri Krishna is born and He is existing

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.420
on this Earth, if you see from a practical
point of view might think it's a wrong thing

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:07.130
She has done, because to tell Kamsa that He
exists and He resides, is still existing,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.850
is giving Him a danger and one would have
felt guilty later on - "Oh, why did I do it?"

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:17.240
If I had not told, he would not have known."

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.740
But that's the right thing to be done, that's
the job they have to do.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:31.910
So we have to see for ourselves that what
makes us guilty for small, small things is

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:38.430
actually is our own ego reacting against us
and wants us to reconcile with what mistakes

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.990
we have committed.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:48.950
Like some people feel guilty because they
have said something they should not have said,

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:59.170
or maybe because they have done something
which they should not have done normally.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:05.370
May not be on a Sahaja Yoga basis, maybe something
else also, very frivolous.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.620
Like somebody spills - say - coffee.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.260
They feel guilty.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:17.010
Or somebody puts the knife on the other side,
on the left hand side, then they'll feel guilty.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:22.670
I mean such stupid things like that which
are regarded as norms in the society and people

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:29.680
start thinking that these norms are very,
very important - as if they are something

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.240
like a dharma and you must maintain those
norms.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.520
But these norms are man-made, most of them
are man-made.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.560
You see some of them are so stupid and so
horrifying that I think, in England I feel,

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.870
there are some, which must be really completely
squashed and finished - like shaking hands.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:56.440
It's a very bad thing, I think, is to do,
is to shake hands with everyone, because God

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.080
knows what kinds of hands people are having,
what kinds of vibrations they have.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:07.330
Now, when My husband has his reception sometimes
I have to shake hands with seven hundred people

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:15.430
coming in, and then seven hundred drunkards
going out.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:22.670
So, this shaking of hands, I think is a very,
very bad habit.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:27.770
It's all right for Sahaja Yogis to shake hands,
but for others to shake anybody's hand, is

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:32.991
better to do Namaste, though it might be some
a very simple Indian method, but I think is

00:13:32.991 --> 00:13:40.170
the best way is to say, "Namaste", because
shaking hands can cause lots of problems to

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:46.450
human beings, and now with all these diseases
coming up and all that, I think one has to

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.280
be very careful about shaking hands.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:54.050
Worse than that is in France I find is like
when you meet someone you must kiss, you see

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.790
- is the worst habit I tell you, horrible.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:04.980
But they do kiss you all the time if you go
there, I had very bad shocks to begin with,

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.940
you see anybody would just get you, kiss you
here, kiss you there, you start looking at

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.150
the person.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:16.540
Now with the fear of AIDS and all that perhaps
they might stop all that nonsense.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.980
But there is no need to do all, this is not
a very good way of wishing anyone, doesn't

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.939
show any respect, in both the cases.

00:14:22.939 --> 00:14:27.760
When you shake hands also there's no respect
and even when you kiss somebody there is no

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.760
respect.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:36.390
But if you say "Namaste" means "I bow to you",
Namaste is "I bow to you", is respect, and

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:41.080
this is one thing we have to do is to respect
each other.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:47.270
But when we are not then we feel guilty, and
like that, you see these all like "Thank you".

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.820
If you have not said, "thank you" to somebody
then we think we have done a big mistake.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.579
I mean the amount of thank-you's we do, you
know.

00:14:54.579 --> 00:15:00.800
We get so much used to it, that even if you
see a statue you say "Thank you very much

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.800
for your darshan."

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.500
It goes on like that, you see, it's a bit
too much.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.000
Too much "Thank you" becomes a lip service
- or "sorry".

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.940
Nowadays, in our times we used to say, "I
beg your pardon" on the phone, but now people

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.519
say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry" I mean sorry for
what?!

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:22.579
Just can't, that "sorry" goes into left Vishuddhi.

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:26.630
If you don't hear it's none of your faults,
maybe the fault of the telephone, maybe the

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.230
fault of the other person.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.760
So, without understanding what is there to
be sorry, just go on saying "Sorry, sorry,

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.750
sorry", feeling sorry for something, is absolutely
boring and such a person can become extremely

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:46.329
boring, since morning till evening he is saying
"I'm sorry for this, I'm sorry for that, I'm

00:15:46.329 --> 00:15:51.170
sorry for this", and all the time feeling
sorry for everything, you feel sorry for that

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.290
person.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:16:02.060
So one has to be in a joyful mood, and doesn't
matter if somebody doesn't say "Sorry", doesn't

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.060
matter.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.070
But some people can take a very big objection
if you don't say "Thank you" to them.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:12.100
Very funny thing is that I have experienced
in England once.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:17.850
I was going out - John was there, John was
driving the car, and My daughter was coming

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:23.970
out of the house so he left the door open
and he just, as soon as she sat down, hardly

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:28.190
took about five, six seconds, he closed the
door, went round.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:33.450
But he didn't say "Thank you" to the fellow
who was standing behind, you see they are

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.579
supposed to be all very rich, cultured, educated
people.

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:39.940
So this fellow got out of his car, caught
hold of this belt, and he wouldn't allow the

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.889
car to move and the car was moving.

00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:44.880
I couldn't understand what was happening.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.150
So I asked John, "Stop the car, stop the car."

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.150
I said, "What's the matter?"

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.340
"She didn't say 'Thank you' to me."

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.650
This fellow would have been killed or something
would have happened to him, doesn't matter,

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.870
you should say "Thank you".

00:16:53.870 --> 00:17:00.470
These are the funny norms that we have, so
many of them and sometimes we miss the point,

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.420
sometimes we miss the point because the whole
thing becomes so mechanical.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.590
It is not mechanical if you say "Thank you".

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:14.870
It's a way of just, even expression or smile
or just a gesture can say that you are thankful

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:18.350
to people for what they have done.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:21.060
But it is a norm, which is created since long,
you know.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.800
They have dropped out so many things, like
they have dropped out their tailcoats, everything,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.620
and I think too much thanking and too much
feeling sorry should be dropped out.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.151
Either you go to the left or to the right.

00:17:33.151 --> 00:17:38.000
So the best thing now is if somebody does
something for you, all right just a smile,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.400
sometimes say "Thank you" all right, but not
all the time, did you say Thank you?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.170
Like one child told me "I don't want to go
to their house", I said, "Why?"

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.650
"Because I have to say 'thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you' all the time."

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:58.470
So children also somehow or another find it's
very artificial, becomes a lip service, and

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:03.660
this lip service can go anywhere and people
start feeling very sorry for things like - I

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.000
didn't send a Christmas card, so they feel
sorry.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.760
Christmas card is not important.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.160
We must see why we have to send a Christmas
card.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.470
Is to wish this person.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.209
Do you have that in your heart?

00:18:15.209 --> 00:18:18.360
Did you feel that from your heart?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:24.170
Once you start feeling from your heart then
you will never catch your left Vishuddhi.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.550
It's a very superficial way of avoiding the
mistakes you have committed.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:33.910
Now supposing I have not done something which
I should have done, sometimes it happens,

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:39.269
then I feel it in My heart you know, just
feel it.

00:18:39.269 --> 00:18:40.269
Should have done it.

00:18:40.269 --> 00:18:42.889
If I have not done it then it gets corrected.

00:18:42.889 --> 00:18:46.710
Not only that but for a Sahaja Yogi it works.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.230
So to feel it in your heart otherwise whatever
is superficial you shouldn't worry.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:57.510
You shouldn't worry, you are all Yogis, you
must know you are all saints now, so you don't

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.390
have to worry about small, small things.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:04.519
Even if you slap someone is all right, if
it is necessary you can slap people.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:09.130
There were yogis used to throw stones at others
just to save themselves from their boredom,

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.130
from their aggression.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:15.860
So it's all right, you are all saints, so
saints can do that way.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:21.940
I read a very nice story about a king who
was a monk, you see and he had to be a king.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.570
He didn't want to become a king because he
said, "I am a saintly person.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:26.570
I don't want."

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.190
He was a saint, but he was made, he was forced,
to become because there was no one, everybody

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.510
was very happy, and he gave all permission
to do whatever they like.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:39.640
But the grandees of that place you see, all
the people who were holding the courts, and

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.780
all that, became very powerful because he
was a very mild person and very kindly person,

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.990
and they just exploited all the villagers,
and they exploited all the poor people, and

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:55.300
all the farmers, and everybody took away all
their things and they looted them, tortured

00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:00.459
them, and troubled their women, and did all
kinds of monstrous things to his subjects.

00:20:00.459 --> 00:20:01.459
But then he was told about it.

00:20:01.459 --> 00:20:13.009
Then he thought that now I am sitting as a
king here and though I am a saint and as a

00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:14.220
saint I have a duty to perform.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:20.630
So he made a very nice plot you see, got very
good people, handful of people who were very,

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:28.830
very close to him, and on whom he can depend,
and he called all these grandees for a court

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:36.800
and tell them not to bring any weapons on
them and then cut everybody's neck there - everybody's.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:45.240
He was a saint, though he cut everybody's
neck, because these people were horrid.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.820
To punish them was his job, and he did it
without feeling guilty, without catching on

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.750
the left Vishuddhi.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:58.160
So whatever has to be done has to be done,
there's nothing to be sorry about it.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.861
You don't have to be sorry at all, but, whatever
you feel then if it is not expressed, that

00:21:04.861 --> 00:21:10.949
feeling properly, then you have to feel it
in your heart so that it acts and works - this

00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:13.570
is, of course, for left Vishuddhi.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:18.550
But one thing we have to ask ourselves, "How
do we get rid of our left Vishuddhi?"

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:23.060
And when you start asking this question, "Why
have I got left Vishuddhi?"

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.730
It is the surplus of your ego as I have told
you.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:34.330
So try to watch what you have done, try to
see what you have said, why did you do it?

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.769
And then face it, and next time don't do it,
so you won't have the guilt because guilt

00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:45.840
is nothing but a stored up mistakes and, like
going to a priest and saying, "I'm sorry I

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.519
did this, I did that" and again doing the
same thing.

00:21:48.519 --> 00:22:10.740
It amounts to the same because then you don't
correct yourself.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:25.490
So this
amounts to one thing, to understand what mistakes

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:32.949
you have committed, what your ego wants to
feel bad about it, and then do not store it

00:22:32.949 --> 00:22:35.630
up, face it up and never do it again.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:43.240
Just we determine "I'll not do it again,"
that's all.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.090
You have to just say, "I will not do it again"
- whatever it is.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.250
Face up to it and say that I will not do it
again.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.500
That's the best way you can manage your left
Vishuddhi.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.670
Another thing is the announcement.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.069
If you use your left Vishuddhi for announcement
there cannot be any guilt.

00:22:58.069 --> 00:23:02.880
Without feeling any guilt, without feeling
nervous, without feeling funny about it, you

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.670
have to go on telling about it.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.670
It works!

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.670
It works very well.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.530
We need not be now anymore afraid, now I've
been in this country fourteen years, working

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.290
in the West for fourteen years, you can talk
about it very freely.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.630
Today only they gave Me an example of that.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:25.769
That the musicians were coming, and while
coming, one of them happened to go earlier

00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:28.769
and they asked him, "Why are you going to
London?"

00:23:28.769 --> 00:23:32.810
He said, "We are going to sing devotional
songs to Shri Mataji."

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.530
"Who is Shri Mataji?"

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.240
He showed My photograph.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.240
Finished.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:42.889
He never asked them for anything, didn't ask
for their passport, didn't check them or anything.

00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:49.320
Another thing was when they came and the customs
people were there and they asked, "Where are

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.410
you singing, where are you fixed?"

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.690
They said, "We are not fixed anywhere.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:24:01.140
We are just going to sing our musical songs,
our musical devotion for Mother, and we are

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.489
going to sing songs to Her, to Mataji Nirmala
Devi.

00:24:05.489 --> 00:24:07.210
The fellow was an Englishman.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:11.359
In Hindi he said, "Thik He.

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:13.550
Thik He."

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.810
So these things announcement helps a lot.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:25.690
For example, wearing a badge, or wearing a,
what you call, a necklace like that, or a

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:30.060
ring, itself is an announcement that you have
found out the Truth.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:35.600
And then, not only that, but also if you want
you should sometimes start wearing a saree,

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.760
doesn't matter, sometimes kurta pyjama, doesn't
matter, on the streets, if you walk about,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.760
people will know.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.150
Now some say that if you wear these things
then Mother has said, "No."

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.970
I never said so, that you cannot wear.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:48.970
If you like you can wear.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:49.970
But there's a freedom to you.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.180
If you want you can wear it, or if you don't
want, need not wear.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.020
But the trouble is, sometimes like these Hari
Rama, Hari Krishna women, then they used to

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.830
wear these dresses and go about.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:03.870
But they were dirty, filthy, unwashed women.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.010
In a proper, traditional way, if you wear
sarees, people will appreciate, definitely.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.010
Why not?

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.989
They would like to see you in sarees.

00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:12.300
If you want you can wear it.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.460
Will be a good idea for you to go about.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.729
There's no harm in wearing sarees.

00:25:16.729 --> 00:25:23.400
I think it's very decent dress, and makes
a woman look like a woman much more than pants,

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.340
and those jeans and things like that.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.640
So it doesn't matter.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.920
But then don't feel guilty with it.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.520
If you want to wear it, wear it with daring
and with courage.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.420
Be a brave person.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:41.300
So only the brave people can get rid of their
left Vishuddhi.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.510
Because you are brave you are doing it.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.020
That's the culture that has to come.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.760
We like the sarees, we'll wear, we like the
kurta pyjamas.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.640
Now in this heat, to wear a three-piece suit.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.739
Is it good?

00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:58.580
But you'll wear three-piece suit with a tie,
perspiring, in India especially, I don't understand

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.980
how the English can manage with the dress
of England.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.260
Wearing three-piece suits and with the ties.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.040
All right, some people can, but not all.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.849
Those who feel very cold can manage, but not
everybody, cannot do it.

00:26:12.849 --> 00:26:17.120
So why should you wear these dresses which
are not suitable for you?

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.510
But that doesn't mean, in India I've seen
people wearing some sort of a, so-called short

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:28.220
and a so-called short on top, and moving about,
that's stupid because it is indecent.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.100
So we cannot wear indecent dresses.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.790
We have to wear decent dresses but which are
comfortable and decent.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:42.040
There is nothing like, we are English, we
are Indian, we are this - we are all universal

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.040
beings.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.979
And once we accept this, suddenly you jump
into the state of collective consciousness,

00:26:47.979 --> 00:26:49.770
into the state of Virata.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:54.310
Once Virata opens out left Vishuddi's finished.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:59.090
If you are a part and parcel of the Virata,
how can you make mistakes?

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.980
How can you be guilty?

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.790
Because it is the Virata who takes over.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.340
He's the One.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.790
Supposing now in your hand something goes
wrong.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:10.840
You don't blame your hand for it.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.640
What you blame is the body.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.840
The body has the problem and the body has
to look after.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.640
The body takes over.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.050
It comes, repairs, looks after, circulates.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.580
Whatever it is, pains or whatever it is, the
suggestion comes from the whole body.

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.880
It's not that the only finger starts feeling
guilty - the whole body.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:35.070
In the same way, once you jump into that state
of Virata, into the state where you feel I

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.979
am a part and parcel of the whole, Vishuddhi
should drop out.

00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:41.290
Left Vishuddi should completely drop out.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.830
It has no place.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.370
It has no place.

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:49.800
How can you alone feel guilty when you are
part and parcel of the whole?

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.120
What's the logic?

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.730
You cannot feel guilty.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:28:00.870
If you are part and parcel of the whole then
the whole takes over, and this is where you

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.690
can cut down your left Vishuddhi very well.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:08.640
So now we have to come to point where you
have to see what is our destiny.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.380
Sahaja Yogis have their destinies.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.450
Have you fulfilled your destiny?

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:16.450
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fashion.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:22.960
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fan of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.960
No!

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.560
You have come here to be saints, all right,
and then what is your destiny?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:41.430
Destiny is to become part and parcel of the
whole.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.620
Have you become part and parcel of the whole?

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:51.450
The collectivity part of it.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.729
You still are involved, supposing, into your
own problems - "I should have said this to

00:28:53.729 --> 00:28:59.739
my wife, to my children, to my house," then
you are not part and parcel of the whole.

00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:05.770
But if you just think of other people who
are Sahaja Yogis - how nice they are, they

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:11.180
are all my brothers and sisters, we belong
to one family, we have to be together, it's

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:20.020
all one - then what happens, the whole petty
ideas of feeling guilty and all that, disappears

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.800
into thin air.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.540
It's like one drop of something getting into
the ocean.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.180
God knows where it has gone.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:38.550
It has become such a small speck of a stuff
that you don't even see, don't even feel it,

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.370
what it is.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:48.350
So what one has to understand is that we have
to fulfil our destiny and what is our destiny?

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:55.650
Our destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole and that's how Vishnumaya asserts

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.350
Herself, shines and announces.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:03.570
When you have become part and parcel of the
whole, what is there to feel shy to tell about

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:04.570
it?

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.570
We are saints.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.650
Of course we are.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:07.810
"Are you saints??"

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:08.970
"Yes, we are."

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:14.520
You have to talk about Sahaja Yoga, you have
to talk about Me, in a very open manner, not

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.310
to feel shy about it.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:20.460
We have had a sort of processions and all
that in India.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.810
But here we dare not have any procession.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:30.170
In England, out of question, you see, I don't
know, people feel very shy about it, to have

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.170
a procession.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:32.790
But supposing you have a procession then what
happens?

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:39.120
Then you are just on the television as soon
as you have a procession.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.930
To bring yourself on the procession you have
to announce and make it a collective effort

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.370
to announce, then you are.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:52.060
But I would say we have to wait for one or
two years more, at the most one year more,

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:57.400
and then we have to go ahead with demonstrations,
with telling people, announcing it, talking

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.400
about it.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.310
This is what is Vishnumaya and if you start
thinking tonight that what you are going to

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:07.920
do about it your left Vishuddhi will be cleared
out.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:14.260
So much so that I have become deaf on My left
ear, the way you people are sometimes feel

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.840
guilty about everything.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.080
Now don't feel guilty that we have not fulfilled
our destiny.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.440
That's the trouble.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.010
Think of it positively.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:29.700
You see when you feel guilty you don't think
about it positively - "What I should have

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:35.160
done, what I should have looked after, how
I should have gone about it, how I should

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.960
have gone further."

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.700
So these things are very important to understand
that if you have to fulfil your destiny, first

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:49.080
and foremost thing is you must think about
it and understand about it, that what is your

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.080
destiny?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.080
What have you to become?

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:58.320
Because now you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
got powers, even if you are caught up, whatever

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:02.859
may be wrong, you can give realization to
others, you can do lots of marvels, you can

00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:08.671
show lots of credible things that are never
done, people can see for yourself that they

00:32:08.671 --> 00:32:15.810
are, themselves that they are, they see that
yourself is something magical box that it

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.969
can create so many things - it's true.

00:32:19.969 --> 00:32:22.219
But, that is not your destiny.

00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:26.349
The destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole.

00:32:26.349 --> 00:32:30.900
That's your destiny and to be effective much
more as a part and parcel of the whole, for

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.560
that, first thing you should start is an announcement.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:39.830
I was sorry to hear that when they wanted
to have a program and all that to be done,

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.339
only a few people were there putting the posters.

00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:53.780
There should be some method in England, specially
England is a place where people are very sort

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:57.930
of ... because it's an island, you see, they
also have their islands of their own.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.239
Everybody has an island, I find, here.

00:33:00.239 --> 00:33:05.920
And they live in an island of their own - "my
family, my house, my, my, my books, my this,

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.469
my, my, my, my that, my that."

00:33:09.469 --> 00:33:11.260
So they live in an island.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:16.630
Now if you tell them that we are having this
program - "Oh, I have no time, and I'm sorry,

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.800
I'm very busy" - or something like that.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.020
Then they feel guilty.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.820
"Oh I should have gone, you know, after all,
this and this."

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:37.200
Now you have joined a movement, a kind of
a Divine upsurge, which has to work out emancipation

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.910
of the whole of humanity.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:46.589
Now you cannot have such a mediocre effort
and because of that you suffer every way.

00:33:46.589 --> 00:33:54.290
All those countries where people have taken
a very great step forward have achieved every

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.290
way.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.180
They have got money, they have got everything
with them.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:06.849
But still if you are worried about this and
worried about that then what happens that

00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:12.969
your progress is stopped, in a way, deterred.

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:16.670
So I would request you not to worry about
anything.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:21.450
Just think, "I have to become part and parcel
of the whole."

00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:26.570
That's why last time I requested all the women
to give up this idea of possessing the husband,

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.020
possessing the children, possessing this,
possessing that.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.460
They don't have to possess anyone.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:36.610
What they have to do is to see that they do
not get possessed with such funny ideas, and

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:40.390
do not try to destroy the collectivity.

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:47.210
So the collectivity has to be brought in,
in such a way, that people do feel the oneness

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:54.989
within themselves, and feel that they are
all together, living together, as part and

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:55.989
parcel of the whole.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:35:01.310
For example, now this finger does some mistake,
I mean this finger gets hurt or something,

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:07.510
this finger doesn't go and say, "I'm sorry",
does it?

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:14.760
Or say by mistake, you see, this hand hits
this one, it won't say, "I'm sorry I hit you."

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.870
Because who is the other to say the sorry?

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.609
Who is the other for whom to feel guilty?

00:35:21.609 --> 00:35:24.450
We are all one.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.370
So what is there to say sorry?

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.110
There is no foreigner within us.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:35.510
We are all together and this is how one has
to realize that there is nothing to feel sorry

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.510
or anything.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:42.930
I never send any cards to anyone, to be very
frank, cards or flowers, to be very frank,

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:48.520
because I have no guru and I have no Mataji
to send flowers to.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.380
If I had somebody I would have sent but I
have no one, to whom should I send?

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.800
Now they are all Mine, so why should I send
it to them?

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.219
They are part and parcel of My being.

00:35:58.219 --> 00:36:00.960
So why should I send this to them?

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.410
But I can nourish them.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:08.609
I give them presents because they are part
and parcel of My being.

00:36:08.609 --> 00:36:13.900
So I just give them presents because, you
see, like the heart will nourish some parts

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.800
of the body, the head will nourish some parts
of the body or will do some function of nourishment.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.140
In the same way one can do it, is to give
presents to each other.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.140
Think about it.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.219
Small, small, things I have told you to think
about how to do it.

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:29.520
It is sometimes so.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:39.300
Like once I was singing one song in Marathi
and it was left there, for some time, I didn't

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:45.000
know how they picked it up from somewhere,
and one day I was just sitting like this and

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.910
they started the song.

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:52.560
Tears started rolling My eyes, I said, "Look
at that, how thoughtful of them to know about

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.930
that I like this song."

00:36:54.930 --> 00:37:00.760
But when you are not part and parcel of the
whole you can make a tremendous mistakes in

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.810
also pleasing other people.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:03.820
The example of that is like this.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.730
I've been to Sahasrara Puja.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:12.906
At the Sahasrara Puja there was a lady in
charge of Me and she was little, I must say,

00:37:12.906 --> 00:37:17.750
I don't know what is to say, but for two and
a half days she gave Me nothing to eat but

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.030
mozzarella cheese.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:23.510
Morning, mozzarella cheese, daytime mozzarella,
evening mozzarella.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:28.839
I said, "Must be they are turning short of
money that's why there's no food in the place."

00:37:28.839 --> 00:37:32.720
So I never said anything, I was just eating
nicely, I am not bothered.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.510
Then somebody came and told Me, "Oh what a
choice we have here."

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.510
"Eh, you have a choice?"

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.400
"Yes, lots of things what's eating."

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.989
I said, "Oh God, I've been eating only mozzarella."

00:37:41.989 --> 00:37:45.410
So they said that, "No these, they told me
that you like mozzarella."

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:56.410
I said, "All right I like mozzarella - doesn't
mean that I don't eat anything else."

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:59.989
So this kind of understanding shows what?

00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:05.440
Shows that you have not understood Me at all.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.290
You have not seen Me.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:13.820
Partially you know that once I liked, I said
all right I like mozzarella, so only mozzarella,

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.880
mozzarella, mozzarella.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:21.760
But what I would say that, you see, that,
to understand Me you must know that, to study

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.910
Me, to understand Me, what Mother is, what
She likes, what She doesn't, if you really

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:33.250
want, I mean I like practically everything,
I eat every, I have no choice of food or anything,

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.250
no choice of anything.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:40.190
I like English music, Western music, I like
even some pop music, I like every sort of

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:44.109
thing, I mean, whichever is good, which has
good vibrations, I like everything.

00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:46.469
I don't make fuss about things.

00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:53.550
But to say that Mother likes this, you see,
and they just stick onto that point, shows

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:55.099
that they are not collective.

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:57.270
Collective is to understand Me fully.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:03.859
Supposing there is a problem here so all the
blood cells know there is a problem here.

00:39:03.859 --> 00:39:05.130
They all know about it.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.120
They know about the whole body.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.489
They just don't know about that particular
cell.

00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:15.640
In the same way, if you know just particularly
about Me this aspect, that aspect, that aspect,

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.359
then I will be starving Myself, I think.

00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:25.020
So to try to understand in all aspects and
for that I think the best way is to know the

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.989
thousand names of the Goddess.

00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:33.180
She's very kind, She's "Shant Mudra" She's
absolutely tranquility, peace.

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:38.250
On the other side, She's "Roudra" She's the
one who can kill people.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.520
She can finish people.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.460
She's absolutely wrathful.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.380
It's true, I accept, it is so.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.280
But it is so, so it is so.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.250
But you must understand My in full ways.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:57.650
If you just understand in My one side, for
example, if you just understand Me to be a

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:04.300
very mild, compassionate, forgiving Mother,
then your are sadly mistaken.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:09.099
Because you might have to pay for something
that is very wrong you are doing to Sahaja

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:16.320
Yoga, you are doing to your brothers and sisters,
maybe doing to yourself, or maybe to Me.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.750
So the other side will definitely punish you.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:27.760
So you must know there are many facets to
Sahaja Yoga and all these facets are to be

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.839
understood properly.

00:40:28.839 --> 00:40:33.749
Many people in the Sahaja Yoga also feel guilty.

00:40:33.749 --> 00:40:37.740
Like now supposing while sitting before Me
they'll start giving bandhan, all right.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:42.669
I'll say, "Don't give bandhan when I'm sitting
there," then they'll feel guilty.

00:40:42.669 --> 00:40:47.199
Try to understand the essence of everything.

00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:50.539
You have to go deeper into a subtler understanding.

00:40:50.539 --> 00:40:53.729
Then you will not have this problem of Vishnumaya.

00:40:53.729 --> 00:41:03.859
The subtler understanding should be that we
have to see with our discretion, divine discretion,

00:41:03.859 --> 00:41:06.169
whatever is right and whatever is wrong.

00:41:06.169 --> 00:41:08.710
We don't have to judge it mentally.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:12.409
That's why I've seen people they sit down
for meditation for three hours.

00:41:12.409 --> 00:41:13.409
What is the need?

00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:15.029
Ten minutes is sufficient.

00:41:15.029 --> 00:41:19.729
But the thing is when they don't understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga they behave

00:41:19.729 --> 00:41:25.669
in such a funny, gross, maddening manner that
even there have been people who have been

00:41:25.669 --> 00:41:31.370
reporting and saying that Sahaja Yoga is a
thing that makes people mad, they start behaving

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:36.539
in a funny manner, they do funny actions and
all that.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:41.360
So all the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga is to
be understood.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.610
This is how you will become the part and parcel
of the whole.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.060
The subtleties of Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:52.689
There are many who do not know even what are
the chakras on the feet are.

00:41:52.689 --> 00:42:00.019
They do not know what is the way one has to
behave in Sahaja Yoga so that we express our

00:42:00.019 --> 00:42:02.949
maximum love.

00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:06.519
So many there are ways of handling things.

00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:13.850
If you really accept that you have to be a
subtler being you'll be surprised, you will

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:20.479
be endowed with such capacities that you can
handle any number of people, anytime, any

00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:23.729
nationality, you will know everything about
it.

00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:26.509
Because subtlety means you go to the essence
of everything.

00:42:26.509 --> 00:42:33.080
If you go to the essence of everything then
you start seeing what is built on the essence.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:40.140
It is very easy to deal with a person if you
see the essence of everything.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:46.810
So for Sahaja Yoga it is important to know
that left Vishuddhi is just avoiding the subject.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.070
You are not facing it.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.420
Secondly, you cannot go to the subtler thing.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:58.310
Another thing, which catches left Vishuddhi
is of course smoking, as you know drugs, and

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:02.830
also tobacco, is very bad for left Vishuddhi.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:11.160
But the worst of all in the left Vishuddhi,
is the mantras given by wrong gurus.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.999
Because that is the essence.

00:43:13.999 --> 00:43:19.080
Mantras are the essence of what one says.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:24.130
So what happens to you, that if your left
Vishuddhi is not all right, even if you say

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.600
mantras, they are not effective.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:36.039
Whatever mantras you say with your left Vishuddhi
are still half-baked, are not fully vibrated,

00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:38.380
because of left Vishuddhi problem.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:44.380
But if you say Mantras without the left Vishuddhi
problem then the mantras become absolutely

00:43:44.380 --> 00:44:14.299
complete, or most effective, or as you say,
that Purnatwa is the completion.

00:44:14.299 --> 00:44:21.549
It has the full effect.

00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:32.100
So this is one thing is to see that you make
everyone understand that we are all collectively

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:39.110
bound, and then you won't feel like hurting
anyone, or troubling anyone, or saying anything

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:40.110
bad.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:43.019
But if you are not collectively conscious
then you will do it.

00:44:43.019 --> 00:44:44.039
You will do it.

00:44:44.039 --> 00:44:46.570
You will hurt others.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:47.570
You will torture others.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:48.570
You will take advantage of them.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.439
You might exploit them, you might do anything.

00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:56.310
But if you know you are part and parcel of
the whole, if you know, in the sense, if you

00:44:56.310 --> 00:45:01.610
know on your central nervous system when it
becomes part and parcel of your being that

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:08.289
you know, it is a sort of an awareness within
you which makes you feel that you are part

00:45:08.289 --> 00:45:14.350
and parcel of the whole, you cannot commit
mistakes, and then you do not feel guilty.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:24.639
So today is the day of a very big relationship
between brother and sister where a sister

00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:27.600
never feels guilty and brother never feels
guilty.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.630
Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty
about themselves and they should always openly

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:37.060
tell whatever they think wrong or whatever
they think is right.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:42.029
There is no harm, a sister can always go and
correct the brother, and a brother can always

00:45:42.029 --> 00:45:43.029
come and correct the sister.

00:45:43.029 --> 00:45:49.009
This is the relationship in which nobody should
feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest

00:45:49.009 --> 00:45:51.610
relationship that you could think of.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:57.469
As mother, if she tells something, the difference
of age is so much that you may not understand.

00:45:57.469 --> 00:46:02.889
Maybe if the father says something the children
may not understand, the difference of age

00:46:02.889 --> 00:46:08.799
is too much and also the norms that we have
created of saying that there's a generation

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:12.239
gap and all this nonsense that is also in
the head.

00:46:12.239 --> 00:46:18.229
But supposing a brother and sister, if they,
between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:18.229 --> 00:46:24.539
they have every right to say whatever is wrong
between them and work it out - not to put

00:46:24.539 --> 00:46:26.179
it as a guilt.

00:46:26.179 --> 00:46:29.220
But now with Rakhi sister is even better.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:35.049
Now with Rakhi sister we have established
a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is

00:46:35.049 --> 00:46:40.120
a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships
with that person.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:46.600
It kills all your flirtations, all your funny,
funny relationships that one develops, all

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:57.400
kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people
going astray, once you have understood the

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:04.519
principle that we have to first settle ourselves
on very holy relationship with each other.

00:47:04.519 --> 00:47:09.929
This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish
that holy relationship.

00:47:09.929 --> 00:47:18.729
And moreover, one has to see that this holy
relationship gives you joy, happiness, and

00:47:18.729 --> 00:47:19.729
pleasure.

00:47:19.729 --> 00:47:25.190
It is not just a holy relationship of some
force or some sort of a thing.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:29.249
Even if you cannot give anything to your sister,
or the brother cannot do anything for the

00:47:29.249 --> 00:47:30.399
sister, doesn't matter.

00:47:30.399 --> 00:47:36.969
The relationship is in the heart, and is felt
very much and when you feel it, that relationship,

00:47:36.969 --> 00:47:41.870
that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows.

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:46.239
I know of some people who have sacrificed
such a lot for the brothers and so much for

00:47:46.239 --> 00:47:47.970
the sisters.

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:54.219
So one has to understand this relationship
is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely

00:47:54.219 --> 00:47:56.959
open - there should be no formality in it.

00:47:56.959 --> 00:48:00.549
That a brother should go and say, "I'm sorry,"
and the sister should go and say, "I'm sorry."

00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:06.459
You have to be open and tell - you should
never feel bad about your brother or sister.

00:48:06.459 --> 00:48:07.459
But it can be the other way around.

00:48:07.459 --> 00:48:13.009
I have seen people, like there was a bhootish
woman, who turned out to be very bhootish,

00:48:13.009 --> 00:48:16.779
and then somebody said, "But she's my Rakhi
sister."

00:48:16.779 --> 00:48:17.919
So what?

00:48:17.919 --> 00:48:20.820
As soon as she becomes bhootish there's no
Rakhi.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.879
Impurity, any impurity walking in, no Rakhi
anymore.

00:48:24.879 --> 00:48:25.879
Finished.

00:48:25.879 --> 00:48:27.129
That's broken long time back.

00:48:27.129 --> 00:48:30.689
You have to have pure relationships of pure
personalities.

00:48:30.689 --> 00:48:35.340
You cannot have impure personalities, "and
then I must help, I have a weakness for the"

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:40.330
- it has created lots of problems for Me in
America this Rakhi sister business, you see,

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:46.749
she's the Rakhi sister of that, and this Rakhi
sister just started creating a kind of a problem

00:48:46.749 --> 00:48:56.450
of a, we can say, intrigue, and she started
telephoning to her Rakhi brothers, and all

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.830
Rakhi brothers joined in that intrigue.

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:03.659
It should not, in any way, cover your discretion.

00:49:03.659 --> 00:49:07.179
That's why the discretion stands in between.

00:49:07.179 --> 00:49:11.229
To understand when Rakhi sister is telling
you something - is it going against Sahaja

00:49:11.229 --> 00:49:12.879
Yoga or for Sahaja Yoga?

00:49:12.879 --> 00:49:15.129
That discretion is in between.

00:49:15.129 --> 00:49:22.249
Before you go to this point you have a discretion
here to see for yourself that this Rakhi relationship

00:49:22.249 --> 00:49:28.479
has to be nourishing, supporting, helping
Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:28.479 --> 00:49:33.129
Other than that it doesn't exist.

00:49:33.129 --> 00:49:38.519
We are brothers and sisters in Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:38.519 --> 00:49:47.419
Anything that breaks it, there's no relationship
at all, anyway.

00:49:47.419 --> 00:49:55.259
If you understand this simple thing I think
we have done a good job today.

00:49:55.259 --> 00:49:57.700
May God Bless you!

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.739
Now for a puja, we should have a very simple
puja.

00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:05.560
Actually, I was saying there's no need to
give Me a saree because I am not anybody's

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:12.090
sister or a brother.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:13.979
But Rakhi day, My brother is here.

00:50:13.979 --> 00:50:20.029
It's nice that we can have it in a way My
physical brother is here.

00:50:20.029 --> 00:50:27.049
It's very good we are having a rakhi program
today in his presence.

00:50:27.049 --> 00:50:37.630
And, all of you should also understand that
it's a very subtle, pure, beautiful relationship

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:41.269
that exists between a brother and a sister.
