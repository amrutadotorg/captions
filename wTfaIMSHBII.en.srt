1
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:12,319
So, actually, we bow to innocence within us.

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,810
And this innocence is the one

3
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,531
which gives you the enlightenment.

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,195
As I told you yesterday, the light has innocence.

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,751
But this is innocent without knowledge.

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,837
But your light is innocent with knowledge.\h\h

7
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,202
We always think that the people who\hhave got knowledge

8
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:58,715
can never be innocent,

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,466
can never be simple.

10
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:06,596
And the idea we have got about innocense is that

11
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:10,760
an innocent person\his always deceived

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,289
can be befoodled,

13
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,676
and can be always taken for granted.

14
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,839
But innocence is a power.

15
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:30,000
It is a power which protects you,

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,430
which gives you light of\hknowledge. 

17
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:41,333
Knowledge that we have,in the worldly sense,

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,495
is how to exploit others

19
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:50,000
how to cheat others, how to make money out of them,

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,980
how to make fun of others,

21
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:57,706
how to look down upon others.

22
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:08,513
But the light of innocence is the light by\h
which you know

23
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:11,763
that love is the highest thing.

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,705
And it teaches you how to love others,

25
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,722
how to\hcare for others,

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,578
how to be gentle about others.

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,700
It also gives you the light\hwithin.
It's just the other way round

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,246
of this 'avidya' (false knowledge) 
that we have in this world.

29
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:36,175
Just\hthe other way around.

30
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:43,430
The 'avidya' (false knowledge) outside
 teaches us competition,

31
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:50,717
how to put the other person\hdown.

32
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:54,258
Because it has fear.

33
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,679
it is insecured.

34
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,746
This knowledge\h
is not secured at all.

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,516
If it had security, it would\h
not have behaved like this.

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,163
But the light of innocence knows everything.

37
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,639
It has no fear.

38
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,173
When we say, "Children are innocent"

39
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:31,267
we mean to\hsay that
they have that power of innocence.

40
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,927
Many times, people have noticed,
if a child falls from a height, \hhe doesn't die.

41
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:45,197
While a young man\hmay die
 with a much smaller height.

42
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,355
And the child is not afraid while falling.\h\h

43
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,867
He just enjoys as if-

44
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:57,308
as if there's a\hparachute
 coming down nicely.

45
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,167
And then when he falls down also\h
just gets up, laugh, smiles at everyone.\h

46
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,446
He doesn't understand why everybody is worried.

47
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,833
Because in that, in a sense, he\h
knows that he's looked after.\h\h

48
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:22,124
He is protected. He knows that there\h
is a power which is much higher\hthan him.

49
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:25,206
And he does not have to worry.

50
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:30,000
Then we\hstart putting ideas 
into the head of the child.

51
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,677
And that is how he starts\h
losing his power of innocence.

52
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,384
And he becomes a coward.

53
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:45,778
He becomes a cunning\hfellow.

54
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:50,299
He becomes an unrighteous personality.

55
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:04,455
But still, we would say that the innocence\h
of children is innocense of ignorance, in a way,

56
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,756
because they do not know the dangers of life.

57
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,661
But the light of innocence knows all the dangers

58
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,355
and also knows how to get rid of it,

59
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,412
also knows how to be away from such a person.

60
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:41,742
There was a wise man who was going on a staircase.

61
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:48,473
And there was a stupid man coming\h
from the other side, a foolish man.\h\h

62
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:52,676
So, foolish people are always aggressive. \h
That is one of the signs.

63
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:56,037
Because they have an inferiority complex.

64
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,880
So, the foolish man says to\h
the man who was coming up,\h\h

65
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,000
he says, "One had to move one one side".

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,179
So, he says, "I don't move for fools", the foolish one says.

67
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,918
So, the wise man says, "I do" and he moved.

68
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:32,170
That's how the light of innocence tells you\h
how far to go with a person,

69
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:36,315
how far to talk to a person,

70
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:42,562
how far to indulge in another person's\h
personality or his problems.

71
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,000
Otherwise, he recides.

72
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,753
He understands that this gentleman is a\h
stupid fool, "So, I move for a fool", like that.

73
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,262
He doesn't pay attention to such a person.

74
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:57,986
He doesn't bother about such a person.

75
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,471
This is the light of innocence which gives\h
you discrimination,

76
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:07,069
how far to go with others.
