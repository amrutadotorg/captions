00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:19.563
We see that also, today, I must tell you
about the part that is politics.

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:23.120
In politics also these people have
developed two types of theories:

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:25.492
one is left-sided, one right-sided.

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:28.654
The left-sided theories are democratic,

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:31.714
where you can indulge into anything
you like.

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:34.144
It’s the individual that is important.

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:36.703
The individual indulges into everything

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:41.135
and you should not stop him from doing
whatever he likes, he’s an individual:

00:00:41.336 --> 00:00:44.305
so he has a right to cut his nose, he has
a right to cut his eyes,

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:47.475
to do what he likes.

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:51.416
An individual is allowed to do what
he likes to do,

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:58.198
and then what happens [is] that we find
this democracy becomes a demonocracy:

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.133
everybody is a demon. Everybody is busy
cutting throats,

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:08.858
cutting all the basis and the roots of life

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:13.021
because everybody is Brahma, becomes
a great personality,

00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:18.643
because the individual is so great and
the collective is lost, completely lost.

00:01:18.844 --> 00:01:23.587
But on the other side, where it is more
discipline,

00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:28.790
more aggressiveness, more controls and
everything [with] the Right Side,

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:33.890
which we can call as communism, where
people are controlled all the time.

00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:38.831
Now why? Because for the collective
the individual must sacrifice.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:43.618
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak,

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.158
then the collective cannot be strong:
it cannot be strong.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.344
The individuals have to be strong.
For example, you will see

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:55.473
that the people who come from communist
countries,

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:59.513
they drink more than people who can
drink here.

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:04.107
Or those who come, say from Islamic
countries, where they don’t touch anything,

00:02:04.308 --> 00:02:07.202
can drink more than even sardarjees.

00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:11.918
So you can imagine what is the situation
of human beings is

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:17.220
that, out of fear if you try to control
him, he goes to the Right Side.

00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:21.607
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed,

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:27.533
he doesn’t accept the situation, he doesn’t
become that,

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:32.142
he doesn’t have that power to control
himself.

00:02:32.343 --> 00:02:39.151
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.
He’s still there.

00:02:39.352 --> 00:02:43.702
As soon as he gets a chance he falls
into it. So that fails.

00:02:43.903 --> 00:02:46.353
So the individuals are weak in that case.

00:02:46.554 --> 00:02:50.408
And where there is complete abandonment,
do what you like,

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.343
live the way you like, indulgences, all
kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

00:02:56.544 --> 00:02:58.726
I mean, everyday you see and you say,

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:02.093
“Oh God, this is a decadent society,
this is happening!”

00:03:02.294 --> 00:03:07.580
Decadence is because an individual
[to] whom you have given all these powers,

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.665
has no power to bear them.

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:16.617
An individual cannot bear money. He
cannot bear power of any kind.

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:22.695
He cannot bear love. He cannot bear
kindness.

00:03:22.896 --> 00:03:29.115
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:33.986
But when an individual becomes
the collective -

00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:37.433
this is the ascent through the central
path -

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:46.419
when he becomes the collective, in his
strength he strengthens the collective.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.697
And also the collective looks after,
protects, and guides the individual.

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:54.611
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

00:03:54.812 --> 00:04:01.887
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:08.745
And there where we feel that still we are
something great,

00:04:08.946 --> 00:04:17.230
we are different, we are Indians or we are
from England or from France,

00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:21.019
still if you are identified then you are
not collective.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.804
In collective sense we are all one, part
and parcel of one being.

00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:31.399
Then you are really acting as collective
being

00:04:31.613 --> 00:04:34.643
and you are one with the Divine. Where
the Sun is looking after you,

00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:38.140
the Moon is looking after you, the winds
are looking after you;

00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:44.822
all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

00:04:45.023 --> 00:04:50.204
Ether, everything is working for you and
you are so well-protected

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:57.224
and blessed by the special quality to enjoy
the joy.

00:04:57.425 --> 00:05:00.530
Then you really become sensitive to that
joy,

00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:03.652
when you are one with the whole.

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:08.503
Like if supposing this finger or this
finger is not one with the whole,

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:12.810
is numbed out… as it happens in leprosy,
what happens

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.213
that this finger becomes numbed out.

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:21.194
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:26.629
because there is no connection, no nerves
acting, it’s insensitive.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.657
In the same way if you are not collective

00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:37.965
and not bothered about collective you are
going to be dropped out.

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:41.932
You are not going to be there to enjoy

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:47.793
the beauties of your own glory and that
of the collective.

00:05:47.994 --> 00:05:51.827
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves,

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:55.746
we have to ascend and we have to be
collective.

00:05:55.947 --> 00:05:59.237
It’s very easy to find out faults with
others.

00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:02.539
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.806
Very easy to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

00:06:08.007 --> 00:06:13.201
Better find faults with yourself. The rest
I’ll look after.

00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:17.898
First you just find faults with yourself
and try to understand others

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.132
and love others and enjoy the company
of others.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:26.964
This, once you decide that we have
to enjoy,

00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:30.649
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.487
Just this decision, this faith, within you

00:06:34.688 --> 00:06:38.259
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.363
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

00:06:42.564 --> 00:06:48.223
Just this decision itself will give you
the power to enjoy.

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:51.966
But the decision should be firm,
no hypocrisy,

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:56.042
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,
nothing,

00:06:56.243 --> 00:07:02.151
just pure desire within us that we have
to be the Spirit.

00:07:02.352 --> 00:07:06.568
And the Spirit which is the collective
being within us.

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:11.541
I hope today on this day of resurrection,

00:07:11.742 --> 00:07:18.466
we have to be thankful to Christ very much
for showing us the way

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:29.645
and also we have to be very much concerned
and alerted about ourselves:

00:07:29.846 --> 00:07:32.663
Where are we? Where do we stand?

00:07:32.864 --> 00:07:36.224
What are we up to? What are we doing?

00:07:36.425 --> 00:07:40.165
What is our responsibility? What is
expected of us?

00:07:40.366 --> 00:07:43.255
Why all these blessings are given to us?

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:47.199
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga,
no sacrifice.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.241
Nobody wants you anything to commit
or to do

00:07:52.442 --> 00:07:55.548
or membership or anything like that.

00:07:55.749 --> 00:08:01.194
I think it’s my commitment. As I said,
that God has the commitment

00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:08.582
but you also have one commitment that
your desire should be pure.

00:08:08.783 --> 00:08:12.644
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:16.099
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out.”

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.818
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and
that’s what He achieved.

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:24.140
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

00:08:24.893 --> 00:08:27.902
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

00:08:28.103 --> 00:08:35.885
He was very young, I must say. But how
much He has done for humanity.

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:40.098
Nobody could have achieved that much
in that small age as He has done it.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.226
It’s remarkable! It’s really remarkable!

00:08:43.427 --> 00:08:48.255
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:53.244
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:56.072
And today is the day of certain promises.

00:08:56.273 --> 00:08:57.780
May God bless you for that.

00:08:57.981 --> 00:09:03.191
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
