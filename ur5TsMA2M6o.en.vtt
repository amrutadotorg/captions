00:12.609 --> 00:19.563
We see that also, today, I must tell you
about the part that is politics.

00:19.764 --> 00:23.120
In politics also these people have
developed two types of theories:

00:23.321 --> 00:25.492
one is left-sided, one right-sided.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.654
The left-sided theories are democratic,

00:28.855 --> 00:31.714
where you can indulge into anything
you like.

00:31.915 --> 00:34.144
It’s the individual that is important.

00:34.353 --> 00:36.703
The individual indulges into everything

00:36.904 --> 00:41.135
and you should not stop him from doing
whatever he likes, he’s an individual:

00:41.336 --> 00:44.305
so he has a right to cut his nose, he has
a right to cut his eyes,

00:44.506 --> 00:47.475
to do what he likes.

00:47.676 --> 00:51.416
An individual is allowed to do what
he likes to do,

00:51.617 --> 00:58.198
and then what happens [is] that we find
this democracy becomes a demonocracy:

00:58.399 --> 01:03.133
everybody is a demon. Everybody is busy
cutting throats,

01:03.334 --> 01:08.858
cutting all the basis and the roots of life

01:09.059 --> 01:13.021
because everybody is Brahma, becomes
a great personality,

01:13.222 --> 01:18.643
because the individual is so great and
the collective is lost, completely lost.

01:18.844 --> 01:23.587
But on the other side, where it is more
discipline,

01:23.788 --> 01:28.790
more aggressiveness, more controls and
everything [with] the Right Side,

01:28.991 --> 01:33.890
which we can call as communism, where
people are controlled all the time.

01:34.091 --> 01:38.831
Now why? Because for the collective
the individual must sacrifice.

01:39.032 --> 01:43.618
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak,

01:43.819 --> 01:48.158
then the collective cannot be strong:
it cannot be strong.

01:48.359 --> 01:51.344
The individuals have to be strong.
For example, you will see

01:51.545 --> 01:55.473
that the people who come from communist
countries,

01:55.674 --> 01:59.513
they drink more than people who can
drink here.

01:59.714 --> 02:04.107
Or those who come, say from Islamic
countries, where they don’t touch anything,

02:04.308 --> 02:07.202
can drink more than even sardarjees.

02:07.403 --> 02:11.918
So you can imagine what is the situation
of human beings is

02:12.119 --> 02:17.220
that, out of fear if you try to control
him, he goes to the Right Side.

02:17.421 --> 02:21.607
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed,

02:21.808 --> 02:27.533
he doesn’t accept the situation, he doesn’t
become that,

02:27.734 --> 02:32.142
he doesn’t have that power to control
himself.

02:32.343 --> 02:39.151
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.
He’s still there.

02:39.352 --> 02:43.702
As soon as he gets a chance he falls
into it. So that fails.

02:43.903 --> 02:46.353
So the individuals are weak in that case.

02:46.554 --> 02:50.408
And where there is complete abandonment,
do what you like,

02:50.609 --> 02:56.343
live the way you like, indulgences, all
kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

02:56.544 --> 02:58.726
I mean, everyday you see and you say,

02:58.927 --> 03:02.093
“Oh God, this is a decadent society,
this is happening!”

03:02.294 --> 03:07.580
Decadence is because an individual
[to] whom you have given all these powers,

03:07.781 --> 03:10.665
has no power to bear them.

03:10.866 --> 03:16.617
An individual cannot bear money. He
cannot bear power of any kind.

03:16.818 --> 03:22.695
He cannot bear love. He cannot bear
kindness.

03:22.896 --> 03:29.115
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

03:29.316 --> 03:33.986
But when an individual becomes
the collective -

03:34.187 --> 03:37.433
this is the ascent through the central
path -

03:37.634 --> 03:46.419
when he becomes the collective, in his
strength he strengthens the collective.

03:46.620 --> 03:52.697
And also the collective looks after,
protects, and guides the individual.

03:52.898 --> 03:54.611
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

03:54.812 --> 04:01.887
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

04:02.136 --> 04:08.745
And there where we feel that still we are
something great,

04:08.946 --> 04:17.230
we are different, we are Indians or we are
from England or from France,

04:17.431 --> 04:21.019
still if you are identified then you are
not collective.

04:21.220 --> 04:26.804
In collective sense we are all one, part
and parcel of one being.

04:27.005 --> 04:31.399
Then you are really acting as collective
being

04:31.613 --> 04:34.643
and you are one with the Divine. Where
the Sun is looking after you,

04:34.844 --> 04:38.140
the Moon is looking after you, the winds
are looking after you;

04:38.341 --> 04:44.822
all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

04:45.023 --> 04:50.204
Ether, everything is working for you and
you are so well-protected

04:50.405 --> 04:57.224
and blessed by the special quality to enjoy
the joy.

04:57.425 --> 05:00.530
Then you really become sensitive to that
joy,

05:00.731 --> 05:03.652
when you are one with the whole.

05:03.853 --> 05:08.503
Like if supposing this finger or this
finger is not one with the whole,

05:08.704 --> 05:12.810
is numbed out… as it happens in leprosy,
what happens

05:13.011 --> 05:15.213
that this finger becomes numbed out.

05:15.414 --> 05:21.194
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know

05:21.395 --> 05:26.629
because there is no connection, no nerves
acting, it’s insensitive.

05:26.830 --> 05:30.657
In the same way if you are not collective

05:30.858 --> 05:37.965
and not bothered about collective you are
going to be dropped out.

05:38.166 --> 05:41.932
You are not going to be there to enjoy

05:42.133 --> 05:47.793
the beauties of your own glory and that
of the collective.

05:47.994 --> 05:51.827
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves,

05:52.033 --> 05:55.746
we have to ascend and we have to be
collective.

05:55.947 --> 05:59.237
It’s very easy to find out faults with
others.

05:59.438 --> 06:02.539
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

06:02.740 --> 06:07.806
Very easy to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

06:08.007 --> 06:13.201
Better find faults with yourself. The rest
I’ll look after.

06:13.402 --> 06:17.898
First you just find faults with yourself
and try to understand others

06:18.099 --> 06:23.132
and love others and enjoy the company
of others.

06:23.333 --> 06:26.964
This, once you decide that we have
to enjoy,

06:27.165 --> 06:30.649
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

06:30.850 --> 06:34.487
Just this decision, this faith, within you

06:34.688 --> 06:38.259
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

06:38.460 --> 06:42.363
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

06:42.564 --> 06:48.223
Just this decision itself will give you
the power to enjoy.

06:48.424 --> 06:51.966
But the decision should be firm,
no hypocrisy,

06:52.167 --> 06:56.042
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,
nothing,

06:56.243 --> 07:02.151
just pure desire within us that we have
to be the Spirit.

07:02.352 --> 07:06.568
And the Spirit which is the collective
being within us.

07:06.769 --> 07:11.541
I hope today on this day of resurrection,

07:11.742 --> 07:18.466
we have to be thankful to Christ very much
for showing us the way

07:18.667 --> 07:29.645
and also we have to be very much concerned
and alerted about ourselves:

07:29.846 --> 07:32.663
Where are we? Where do we stand?

07:32.864 --> 07:36.224
What are we up to? What are we doing?

07:36.425 --> 07:40.165
What is our responsibility? What is
expected of us?

07:40.366 --> 07:43.255
Why all these blessings are given to us?

07:43.456 --> 07:47.199
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga,
no sacrifice.

07:47.400 --> 07:52.241
Nobody wants you anything to commit
or to do

07:52.442 --> 07:55.548
or membership or anything like that.

07:55.749 --> 08:01.194
I think it’s my commitment. As I said,
that God has the commitment

08:01.395 --> 08:08.582
but you also have one commitment that
your desire should be pure.

08:08.783 --> 08:12.644
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

08:12.845 --> 08:16.099
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out.”

08:16.300 --> 08:20.818
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and
that’s what He achieved.

08:21.019 --> 08:24.140
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

08:24.893 --> 08:27.902
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

08:28.103 --> 08:35.885
He was very young, I must say. But how
much He has done for humanity.

08:36.086 --> 08:40.098
Nobody could have achieved that much
in that small age as He has done it.

08:40.299 --> 08:43.226
It’s remarkable! It’s really remarkable!

08:43.427 --> 08:48.255
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

08:48.456 --> 08:53.244
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

08:53.445 --> 08:56.072
And today is the day of certain promises.

08:56.273 --> 08:57.780
May God bless you for that.

08:57.981 --> 09:03.191
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
