00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.937
Ladies and gentlemen. You see, first I
would like to introduce myself.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:09.403
I've been a professor and Head of the Department
of Physiology, at Maulana Azad Medical College.

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:14.629
Then I was the Chief of the Physiology
Department at JIPMER, Pondicherry and

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.942
recently, I was the Chief of the Department
of Physiology and also Medical Suprintendent

00:00:19.942 --> 00:00:23.875
of The Lady Harding Medical College
and The Sucheta Kriplani Hospital.

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:29.995
Now, first I would like to tell you, that 
how I came into Sahaja yoga. Now,

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:37.033
I listened to the talk of Shri Mataji in 
1984 and as Mr. Rajesh Shah has told you,

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:42.806
that in the presence of Mother, the Kundalini
of a person awakens and he gets the experience

00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:47.673
of the cool breeze. Now all the persons
present in the hall got the experience of

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:53.843
the cool breeze but unfortunately, I had a
little doubt in my mind, as many persons

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:58.996
initially have. So, I very humbly
requested Shri Mataji, that,

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:04.806
"Mother, I would like to do some research
work or because I would like to find out

00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:10.831
whether actually one gets the feeling of the
cool breeze or it is simply a subjective feeling

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:18.022
or [INAUDIBLE] told me earlier also, it might
be due to hypnosis or other thing. So, I

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:24.961
took the permission of Shri Mataji into my
University faculty meeting and I told them

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:30.932
that I want to work on Sahaja yoga and to
establish whether one gets the cool breeze or not.

00:01:30.932 --> 00:01:37.355
There was a little opposition in the faculty
meeting because they wanted to work more

00:01:37.355 --> 00:01:43.121
on fundamental aspects but ultimately
seeing that yoga is very important and one

00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:49.211
must know the, what happens, you see, when
a yoga is done in the body - the University

00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:55.119
agreed on it and got it recognized as a
subject for research. Now, two of my

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.840
students you see, I took one student, who
did a Doctorate on Sahaja Yoga Philosophy

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.351
and he tried to find out that what are the
physiological effects of the Kundalini awakening

00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:13.236
by Sahaja yoga. That was the first thesis done.
It was presented, scrutinized by examiners,

00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:20.102
foreign as well as outsiders and Dr. Sethi
who was the, my student, got the degree of

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:26.710
Doctorate in Physiology Medicine on this
subject. Another student, Dr. Chugh is here,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.619
he was the next my student, Post Graduate
student and he has also been given the degree

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:39.578
of Doctor of Medicine on Sahaja yoga. He's
got work on the Role of Sahaja yoga in the

00:02:39.578 --> 00:02:45.209
treatment of Psychosomatic diseases. So
these were the two thesis and they were

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.661
highly credited by the examiners and in
Lady Harding Medical College, which also

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:57.171
started giving Sahaja yoga to the patients, you
see, for the treatment of Psychosomatic diseases.

00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:01.858
Because of the first discovery, you see,
of The Physiological Effects, we found that

00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:06.688
one is doing a Sahaja yoga, you see, there
is a change, a profound changes in the body

00:03:06.688 --> 00:03:13.402
which occur and which are very important you
see, for their utility for the human beings

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:18.214
because in modern age, you see we find,
what happens is, that we are going into

00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:22.884
stress and strain of [UNCLEAR]. If you read,
you see, the Medical literature, you find

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:28.947
people say that it is the Psychological
stress which is responsible for increasing

00:03:28.947 --> 00:03:33.626
incidence of hypertension in most of the
Western countries, developing countries

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:38.690
as well as the developed countries. And we
found by our first thesis, you see, which

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.012
work was done, that this could be a very
important, if a person practices Sahaja yoga,

00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:50.256
the stress factor can be managed very nicely
because all the parameters, you see, for testing,

00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:55.858
whether a person is in a state of stress,
tension or anxiety or he is in a relaxed

00:03:55.858 --> 00:04:02.408
state are done and we found that a person
who did Sahaja yoga only for 20 minutes a day,

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:08.153
you see, in about 3-4 months time there were
changes in his blood, there were changes

00:04:08.153 --> 00:04:12.609
in the heart, there were changes in the
electro encaphalograph, there were changes

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.049
in the muscle activity and the changes in
the neuro-transmitters. One of the very

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.710
important neuro-transmitter, Adrenaline,
you see, which is produced by the stimulation

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.623
of the Sympathetic Nervous system, when
you are anxious, you see, you are in tension,

00:04:27.623 --> 00:04:32.226
what happens is, there is greater pouring
of Adrenaline in the body and as a result

00:04:32.226 --> 00:04:37.077
of which, your heart beat increases, you 
see, and you find there is a muscle, you see,

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:42.447
blood lactic acid increases and persons,
if they are having accumulated stress for

00:04:42.447 --> 00:04:47.459
years together, you develop various type
of cardiovascular disorders, like essential

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:53.632
Hypertension is one, Ischemic heart disease
is another and even Arrhythmia. So, we tried

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:59.907
to find out that how, we tried to do it on the
patients and that is how the work of Dr. Chugh

00:04:59.907 --> 00:05:06.343
started, you see and we did the work on
patient and we took two groups, you see.

00:05:06.343 --> 00:05:10.886
We took the patients with the Hypertension as
well as Bronchial Asthma. Bronchial Asthma

00:05:10.886 --> 00:05:17.124
also has got a psychological factor in it,
stress factor. We took these two groups and to

00:05:17.124 --> 00:05:23.913
our surprise we found, it gave a dramatic
effect. 98%, if I'm correct, you see, the

00:05:23.913 --> 00:05:30.454
patients of hypertension improved and then
they were without drugs on follow-up and

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:35.247
they had no way. The other group, which
was simply on drugs, was not cured, you see

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:41.320
and they were getting, you see their blood
pressure was very high and so we concluded that,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.384
if a person is doing Sahaja yoga regularly,
then we find the Essential Hypertension can

00:05:47.384 --> 00:05:52.405
be treated and the persons who are prone to
essential hypertension, you see, that can be

00:05:52.405 --> 00:05:57.806
prevented. And similarly in Bronchial Asthma,
you see we found that was very, very helpful.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:05.098
Now after this you see, we recently went
to Russia, you see, and in Russia, you see, we

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:11.587
I attended a conference in Yalta and the
conference was very good because the role

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:17.912
was there the, it was on the 'Yoga and
Self-regulation' and this was organized

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:20.312
by the people of Non-traditional Medicine.

00:06:20.312 --> 00:06:25.556
In Russia also people want that they are
fed up with the drugs and they want that

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:30.017
there should be a system of medicine,
you see, which may be non-traditional

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:36.086
and they found that yoga is very good. So
many types of yogic were there, you see,

00:06:36.086 --> 00:06:42.165
TM people were there, Rajnishites were there,
you see the Brahmakumaris were there,

00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:47.053
Magneto Therapy were there, so many they are.
But in the end of the conference, you see,

00:06:47.053 --> 00:06:51.142
they found, they were convinced that
Sahaja yoga is one of the best and it is

00:06:51.142 --> 00:06:55.876
the scientific work has been done, it has
been proved statistically, that you see,

00:06:55.876 --> 00:07:00.475
the person who is doing Sahaja yoga, is
able to regulate his brain activity.

00:07:00.475 --> 00:07:05.921
You see, as Mother has told, you see when
one is doing Sahaja yoga, you are in balance.

00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:11.784
The activity of the Sympathetic and Para
Sympathetic is is modulated and you are in a

00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:17.029
balance and that is how, when a person is
doing Sahaja yoga, your diseases are

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:22.209
automatically cured. More so, they are
prevented. If a normal person is doing,

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:27.664
you can prevent the occurrence of disease.
So in Yalta, conference was very nice. Then

00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:33.305
in Moscow we had another conference and there
too, it was a Conference on Yoga and Sports.

00:07:33.305 --> 00:07:37.801
And I told them, if a person - you see, there
what happens in sports, you see, they are

00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:42.533
also in great tension because finding out
that they should be able to keep the time,

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:47.770
you see and they should win in it and all
those things. So, I told them, if a person

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.358
is doing Sahaja yoga, you see they will be
able to manage the stress factor which is there

00:07:53.358 --> 00:07:59.248
and again you see, it also because it acts
at the level of the limbic system, you see

00:07:59.248 --> 00:08:06.400
it might help in the efficiency as well. Then
I gave a talk in the Institute of Neurology,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.016
at Leningrad, you see, is one of the very
famous Institute there. They do a lot of

00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:17.196
operations and they requested me to give
a talk because they said that they are also

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:22.834
very much affected by the Hypertension.
Because what happened tension is there,

00:08:22.834 --> 00:08:27.800
many people develop Hypertension, so they
said that, "We want to do it," and they

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.798
took the realization and 90% people, doctors
who were there, they got their realization.

00:08:33.798 --> 00:08:39.921
Now another thing which we are doing in
Delhi nowadays, is the Effect of Sahaja
yoga on Epilepsy.

00:08:40.358 --> 00:08:46.548
So they got very much interested to do work
on Epilepsy because the Grandmal Epilepsy

00:08:46.548 --> 00:08:51.509
can have no treatment and the drugs which
are given, they are to be given for the whole life.

00:08:51.895 --> 00:08:57.885
So, they said, it would be very good idea,
if Dr. Rai you could get this thing done here

00:08:57.923 --> 00:09:06.023
and we are thinking, they have signed rather
a project also, where we will go and give them

00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:11.096
the initiation in Sahaja yoga, their patients
and they will try also to find out that

00:09:11.096 --> 00:09:15.064
what is the result. In Delhi we are doing
it in collaboration with the

00:09:15.064 --> 00:09:19.433
Defense Institute of Physiology and Allied
Sciences - the results are very good.

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:24.525
We are finding that the attacks, you see,
of Epilepsy are decreasing when a person

00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:30.251
is doing Sahaja yoga. So, and then you
see, we had also did some public lectures

00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:36.715
and as Rajesh Shah told you just now, you
see, about 1500-2000 people were attending

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:43.423
the lectures and there were requests from
many places that mini centers may be opened.

00:09:43.423 --> 00:09:49.576
We have already got a center at Leningrad,
Moscow, Kiev and Sochi. They are the four

00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:54.769
places where the centers are there but
they wanted center at Tashkent, Yalta,

00:09:54.769 --> 00:10:00.634
Novosibirsk in Siberia and so on. So there
was a very good response and the people

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:07.314
think there, that this could be one of the
Non-traditional System of Medicine in Russia -

00:10:07.314 --> 00:10:11.419
they are very much. You see, the Ministry
of Education, we had a meeting with them

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:18.073
and there I think, the Deputy Minister was
very much interested and he said,

00:10:18.073 --> 00:10:24.973
"Dr. Rai, can it help it in the development of
children? Can it help at the rehabilitation centers?"

00:10:24.973 --> 00:10:30.688
I said, "Certainly, " because, you see, as
a Physiologist I know, that if the

00:10:30.688 --> 00:10:36.340
actualization of the Kundalini takes place
at the level of the Limbic system, which

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.741
affects the behavior of a person, naturally
it is going to be a very successful. Because

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:48.039
the behavior of the children, you see, in
the orphanages you see the little and different.

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:53.026
So, if they do it and practice it, it 
comes down to a normal level. So they are

00:10:53.026 --> 00:10:59.043
thinking of doing a research on this as
well. Similarly, in other schools also they

00:10:59.043 --> 00:11:05.344
wanted because it can also increase the
creativity in children because of the

00:11:05.344 --> 00:11:09.812
connections of the Limbic system with the
Frontal lobe. You find, the children who

00:11:09.812 --> 00:11:15.735
are doing Sahaja yoga, they excel in their
performance. This is our own experience, Mother.

00:11:15.735 --> 00:11:19.907
At Delhi we have seen, some of the children
who were very poor and who were coming to the

00:11:19.907 --> 00:11:25.407
centers and doing this, they stood first
in their classes. Now remarkable! This is

00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:30.372
all because of the creative power, you see.
When a children are doing it, you see,

00:11:30.372 --> 00:11:36.122
their Kundalini gets awakened, you see your
Frontal lobe is also stimulated, which is

00:11:36.122 --> 00:11:42.340
the seat for the higher intellectual
activity. So, we find that, this is Sahaja yoga.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.139
You see, Mother has discovered it, She is
the founder of the Science of Sahaja yoga

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:53.890
and I think, it is a unique yoga and the best
yoga, which the human mankind can have today.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:59.358
The drug problem, you see which is there,
can also be solved by this. You see the

00:11:59.358 --> 00:12:03.888
people are taking drug - why they take
drug? It is because the tension, because

00:12:03.888 --> 00:12:09.396
of certain problems - emotional problems,
other problems are there. So, if one starts

00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:15.274
doing it, all these things will improve. I
know persons, you see, by my experience

00:12:15.274 --> 00:12:21.529
you see, that they have left smoking, they
have left alcohol - persons who have been

00:12:21.529 --> 00:12:26.189
taking alcohol all their life - now they don't
touch it. They say, "If I can't touch it,"

00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:32.238
even if you offer them. So, if just things
can happen, I think it is a wonderful thing

00:12:32.238 --> 00:12:38.259
and best for the mankind. Similarly you'll
see, so much as I told you earlier, the

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:44.213
Ischemic heart disease, the heart attacks.
Now the doctors all over the world know

00:12:44.213 --> 00:12:51.003
that it is the psychological stress, which
is responsible for increasing even the

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:55.394
blood cholesterol level. Recently you see,
in the last two years, people have found

00:12:55.394 --> 00:13:00.917
it out and that is the cause of the Atherosclerosis.
Another thing what they have found

00:13:00.917 --> 00:13:07.490
recently is, that this psychological stress,
emotional stress can cause a spasm of your coronary

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:12.770
vessels and thereby, can give rise to
heart attack and sudden death, Mother.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:18.854
Now all these things can be prevented, you
see, if a person is doing Sahaja yoga

00:13:18.854 --> 00:13:27.028
everyday for say, about 10-15 minutes. So, it
very nice, it is a life, I say Sahaja yoga, that

00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:31.591
you have a Sahaja yoga lifestyle, I think,
you can prevent the heart diseases.

00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:36.585
So Mother, this is what, I think, is there. If
any questions are there, most welcome to ask.
