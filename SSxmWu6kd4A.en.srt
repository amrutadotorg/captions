00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:26,208
Sankranti Puja, Rahuri, India

2
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:37,417
January 14th, 1987

3
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:37,291
Today is the day where we celebrate the change

4
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:42,834
of the axis of the Sun and that He moves

5
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:48,041
towards the tropic of cancer.

6
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:59,250
Tropic of cancer is the one

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,959
which represents the motherhood,

8
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:17,625
the motherhood of the Earth.

9
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:31,000
This tropic of Cancer has passed through

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
quite a big area of land

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:39,709
while the tropic of Capricorn has not.

12
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,667
And the area through which it has passed

13
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,917
it has created

14
00:02:52,208 --> 00:03:01,375
different beautiful manifestation

15
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,959
of the motherhood qualities on this Earth.

16
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,709
We celebrate this change

17
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,667
because the Sun has now moved into the new

18
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:29,208
dimension so that all over the world

19
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:37,834
there will be the warmth of the Sun.

20
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,250
Warmth of the Sun

21
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,917
represents the warmth of God's love.

22
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,333
This is the reason why we celebrate

23
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:02,125
this festival

24
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,000
by giving you some sort of a sweet

25
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:09,417
made out of sesame seeds.

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,166
Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat giving

27
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:24,417
and now as we are coming from the cold,

28
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:31,000
we come to the hot season, in a way hotter season,

29
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:36,959
so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun.

30
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:43,208
These special things are made out of the seed

31
00:04:43,792 --> 00:04:49,375
of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,709
and the warm of the Sun.

33
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,125
Though in India the heat is too much,

34
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:07,583
still people are waiting for this time to come in

35
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,999
and they celebrate it with such a warm heart.

36
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:17,000
At this time it is said that

37
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:26,291
they give you this sesame seed and the sugar to eat,

38
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:30,959
but now you must speak in a sweet manner,

39
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:36,125
"gudd gudd bola", means you must speak in the sweet manner.

40
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:41,750
Speaking in the sweet manner is very important.

41
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:47,083
Some people think it is smart to speak in a rude manner

42
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:52,750
or is very intelligent to shout on people,

43
00:05:55,667 --> 00:06:00,000
but no one likes this kind of a personality.

44
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:06,667
You may be intelligent, you may be very sharp or smart,

45
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,999
maybe on a television people may like to see you,

46
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:17,125
but not as companions, as friends.

47
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,667
To speak in a very sweet manner

48
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:31,500
is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God.

49
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,041
Those who fear God will never speak

50
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,834
rudely to another person, because in another person

51
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,291
also the same spirit is shining

52
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:47,750
and why should we be sharp or angry with another person

53
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:53,458
who is created by God Almighty as we are created.

54
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:59,583
So this loving, beautiful relationship

55
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,333
that we have with each other,

56
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,500
after Sahaja Yoga especially,

57
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,667
let us express in talking to each other sweetly.

58
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:13,041
There are so many ways by which we could be sweet.

59
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:19,834
There are little, little things if you do,

60
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,375
you can create lot of sweetness,

61
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:29,125
but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory.

62
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,375
I try these things many a times.

63
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:38,500
Once one of the Sahaja Yogi,

64
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,000
who is a very good Sahaja Yogi and an active Sahaja Yogi,

65
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:45,250
was going in the car with Me

66
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:54,208
and his knife was stolen by the driver or somebody

67
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,667
and he got very angry with the driver.

68
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,999
I said, "Forget it, you see he is an poor man,

69
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:05,291
so he has taken it away, doesn't matter, just forget it."

70
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,000
He says, "No, it was because it's a present to me

71
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,542
from somebody who was in Switzerland and

72
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,375
it's a Swiss knife which I was keeping with me.

73
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:18,250
So I feel sorry that I have lost it."

74
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:20,834
When I went to Switzerland I bought that kind of a

75
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,083
same knife for him.

76
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,792
When I came, when I gave him,

77
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,709
he didn't have words to say anything.

78
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:32,083
He said, "Mother, how did You remember?

79
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,000
After such a long time how did you manage

80
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,041
to get this knife?"

81
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:37,959
I said, "I have a very good memory."

82
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,333
That's the trouble with Me.

83
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:45,083
The memory is so good that sometimes,

84
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,375
I just don't know,

85
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,834
I may embarrass some people with My memory.

86
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,999
It is that good, I don't forget anything whatsoever.

87
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,208
I, of course, forget all the bad things,

88
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:02,041
because no use remembering bad things,

89
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,625
no use thinking of them.

90
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:09,250
Because of forgiveness you can always forget the bad things.

91
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,709
And if you remember the good things

92
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,417
your joy becomes multiplied.

93
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,959
If you try to remember something bad

94
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,917
then your joy goes down.

95
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,041
Every time you see a person try to remember

96
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,542
what good that person has done to you.

97
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,000
What good that person has.

98
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,083
If you have memory for good things

99
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,834
you will have a very nice time.

100
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,999
Now today is the day when you are all leaving India.

101
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,667
Some of you will be leaving day after tomorrow.

102
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,083
Whatever it is,

103
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,959
I have to tell you one thing, that

104
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:53,375
whatever was possible has been done here, for you people

105
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,375
to give you joy and happiness.

106
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,125
Now when you are going back,

107
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,041
try to remember all that was said to you.

108
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,000
All that was nice.

109
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,917
How people praised you.

110
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,500
How they loved you. How they were kind to you.

111
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,959
How you met some nice people.

112
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,417
What nice experiences you had

113
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,500
but don't brood over things which are worthless.

114
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:22,125
All right, somebody must have said something harsh to you

115
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
or you might have said something harsh to someone,

116
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,500
just forget it.

117
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:29,417
Try to understand that you are spoiling

118
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:32,291
your chances of enjoying life.

119
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:40,542
Nobody is hurt by that so try to be extremely happy

120
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,917
that you have met so many people,

121
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,875
that you have had weddings,

122
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,917
that you have seen so many weddings.

123
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:51,125
We have had a nice time and every bit of it was

124
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,667
full of joyous vibrations.

125
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,709
Of course, today some of you would be a little unhappy

126
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,750
I can understand that because your spouses are leaving,

127
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,417
somebody's husbands are going away or

128
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,375
somebody's wives are going away.

129
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,875
So I can see some of them

130
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,625
are looking rather miserable about it.

131
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,875
But that's a good thing because it is out of love

132
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,667
and out of attraction for each other,

133
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,458
for enjoying the company of each other.

134
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:29,083
That's suggestive of something very good to Me

135
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,959
but still I would say that, after all,

136
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,375
you are going to meet each other

137
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,999
and remember all the good things that

138
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:38,083
you have said to each other,

139
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,583
you have enjoyed with each other and try to keep happy.

140
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,834
Because these days will pass very fast.

141
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,291
In Sahaja Yoga you just forget time, everything,

142
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,083
the time passes so fast and all these things will pass over

143
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:55,417
and you will be again united with your husbands or wives,

144
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:57,125
whatever may be the case.

145
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,917
So there is nothing to feel very sad about all these things,

146
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,250
and to keep smiling and laughing,

147
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:04,917
so when they are departing also,

148
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:08,917
they should not feel, see your last face full of tears but,

149
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,999
but remember the face of assurance and courage,

150
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,750
that the hope is there,

151
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,458
we are going to meet very soon and

152
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:23,333
there is nothing to feel very sad about it.

153
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,333
Today is the day to make joy and to enjoy everything

154
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:33,333
and to feel the blessings of God all around us.

155
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:37,750
The Sun has come back in His own glory

156
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:43,834
and we have to wish Him all success in the coming year,

157
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,041
because in this part of Maharashtra

158
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,333
as you know there has been no rain.

159
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,709
There has been problems with them and

160
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,333
we have to wish Him success

161
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:58,041
so that He can bring forth the rain

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,959
and all that is needed out of this solar energy

163
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,709
that we have in this country.

164
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,917
And you have to be beaming like the Sun

165
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,959
when you go back to your countries.

166
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,917
That your countries are not so hot as ours are neither

167
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,625
you have that much of warmth there and you can find

168
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:26,458
that why people are so warm and so much loving because

169
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,500
we have the Sun with us.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,417
Now you carry the Sun with you and you give them love

171
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,709
and affection and warmth and let them feel that the Sun

172
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,625
has been brought from India by you.

173
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,083
Whenever I have traveled anywhere, in any country,

174
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:46,041
the Sun used to be there very bright, so they said that,

175
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,250
there is a saying that, when the Indians travel

176
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,500
they carry the Sun with them.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,875
Of course you can't carry the Sun in your pockets

178
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,709
but we must be carrying it in our hearts, the Sun.

179
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,125
That must be the reason that's why

180
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,709
the Sun was shining so well

181
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,834
and everybody came out with their good dresses

182
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,999
and everything was ...were, and were enjoying.

183
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,333
So this is what it is,

184
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,625
that you have to carry the Sun with you

185
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,625
speaking sweetly today and forever to each other

186
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,750
to be friendly, to be helpful, to be kind

187
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,792
because you are yogis,

188
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,375
you are not ordinary people.

189
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,834
You are yogis, you represent that category of people

190
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,709
who are known for their righteousness,

191
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,834
for their goodness and for their compassion and love.

192
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,917
So I wish you all best of luck.

193
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,542
Enjoy your journeys,

194
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,750
enjoy everything and pass this joy

195
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,417
that you have achieved here,

196
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,542
to other people, to other Sahaja Yogis

197
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,999
and to other people who are not even Sahaja Yogis.

198
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,750
May God bless you with that.

199
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:49,000
Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.

200
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,000
Today is an auspicious day and on this day we give sesame

201
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,875
seeds to others and ask them to talk sweetly.

202
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:59,125
We tell others but it would be better if we tell it

203
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,959
to ourselves also because it is easier to tell others

204
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,667
to talk sweetly but: “I’ll talk harshly.”

205
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,083
With this habit of ours have created

206
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:12,166
wrong ideas about ourselves. We do not have any idea

207
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:17,083
of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us.

208
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,625
God has given such a lot of blessings to us in this country.

209
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,208
But in this country people do not care much for cleanliness.

210
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,625
In this country there are different types of germs

211
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,792
and parasites.

212
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,000
I feel that we have all the parasites of the whole world

213
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,834
in this country. We even have parasites which

214
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,709
cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

215
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,458
If these parasites go to the other countries they will die.

216
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,000
Because of the cold they cannot survive.

217
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,166
Due to the Sun, there are so many parasites in this country.

218
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:51,792
Once a scientist asked Me, “How is it possible to remain

219
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:56,041
alive with so many parasites present in your country?”

220
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,792
I replied that “In this country, the people are not only

221
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,375
alive but live with joy and happiness,

222
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,000
with a lot of bliss and happiness.”

223
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,083
The reason for this is the Sun.

224
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,083
The Sun has taught us to keep our homes open

225
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,333
and also open our hearts.

226
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,458
In England, if you have to go out somewhere

227
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,125
then you have to spend at least fifteen minutes just to put

228
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,125
on the right clothes.

229
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,542
It’s as if you are wearing a shield before going out,

230
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:27,959
otherwise you might catch a cold and affect your head.

231
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,625
This is the situation there.

232
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,083
Today you are sitting here in the open but we cannot sit

233
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,583
like this in England or in any other Western country.

234
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,250
Because of the weather these countries have become very cold.

235
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,125
Even in our country there are areas (city), for example

236
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,333
if you go to cities like Bhowali or the other side of

237
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:57,208
Nainital and Dehradun and very close to the Himalayas, then

238
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:02,834
you can find the cold weather as in the other countries.

239
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:08,667
There, it is also cold like in England and America.

240
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,000
But in these cold countries not even birds or insects

241
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,542
can survive.

242
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,291
There are a lot of forests with beautiful flowers in them.

243
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,250
They call it a valley of flowers.

244
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,625
There are so many beautiful flowers – as if it is a paradise

245
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,333
on earth – but this feeling is only for a moment.

246
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:30,667
It is so cold there that we cannot even open our eyes

247
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,834
to see that beautiful place.

248
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,208
We have to wear spectacles otherwise our eyes are hurt,

249
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,125
because of the cold.

250
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,709
But in spite of the cold,

251
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,583
those countries have progressed so much.

252
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:48,500
They have fought against the nature and the cold climate

253
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,417
and strengthened their countries.

254
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,417
In spite of having a lot of sun, we have not been able

255
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,333
to exploit its advantages.

256
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,667
We can also produce solar energy.

257
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,458
If we use the solar energy we will never have a dearth

258
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,375
of (electrical) energy.

259
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:09,667
Even the cars can run on solar energy.

260
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,709
But the attention of the politicians here in India

261
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,083
is elsewhere and due to this fact, we cannot exploit

262
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:17,500
the advantages from the sun but suffer from it.

263
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:21,917
If we do not go to the extremes then we can do a lot of work.

264
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:24,000
The main thing which we can learn from the Sun

265
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,834
is Its capacity of giving. It always gives.

266
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:32,041
It does not take anything but always gives.

267
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,083
Due to this tremendous giving power of the Sun

268
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,667
we can have rain, we can have crops and living beings.

269
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,166
If we did not have the sun then we would not have anything.

270
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,041
It is due to the giving power of love of the Sun only, that

271
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,917
we have been able to reach this state.

272
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,250
Thus what we have to learn from the Sun is that we should

273
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,417
also develop the power of giving.

274
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,542
If we look around us we will find people who will always

275
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,458
think, “How I can save money and keep it for myself?”

276
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,291
Even if I give money for some programs, some people still

277
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:01,667
think how they can save money from that also.

278
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,542
Even if I have given them some money to spend they always

279
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:08,000
have a tendency to save money from everything. Why?

280
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,208
Because there is a tendency to hold on to something.

281
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,542
If someone goes to the market and they find that prices

282
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,458
have risen, and if we ask, “Why?” they reply that

283
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,750
“Because the others have increased the prices,

284
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,250
that’s why I also increase the price.”

285
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,917
If the (cost) prices of the commodities are not rising then

286
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,917
why do they raise the (selling) price?

287
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:28,000
They have always a tendency to suck the energy of others.

288
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,792
Even if I want to make a small ceremony for a festive

289
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,083
occasion, then others tell Me,

290
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,834
“Shri Mataji you will not be able to succeed.”

291
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,417
When I ask, “Why?” the reply is that people are corrupt and

292
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,875
they will eat (grab) money.

293
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,166
As I eat the food they eat money, so maybe we will not get

294
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,000
along together. It is such an absurd thing.

295
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,083
Those who are responsible for the country’s welfare,

296
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,625
those who are the administrators and those on whom the power

297
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,875
has been bestowed by God, even they do not understand that

298
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,417
we have to give.

299
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:13,000
This quality of giving one has to learn from the Sun:

300
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,041
that we have come (on this earth) to give and not to take.

301
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,750
This complete change from within has to be reached with

302
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,750
an understanding that we have to give and not to take.

303
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,291
We have to have the passion of giving.

304
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:27,625
It’s as if when a mother knows that “Today my son is coming”

305
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,583
then with passion she thinks, “What can I do for him,

306
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,667
what food can I cook for him?”

307
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:35,208
This is the passion which a mother has.

308
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,291
Even if she doesn’t have the ingredients, she might borrow

309
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,417
them from the neighbors and prepare some sweets for you.

310
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,166
She always feel that she has not done enough.

311
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,542
Unless and until we have this kind of collective passion

312
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:50,709
from inside and have this kind of feeling about others,

313
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,166
no country can progress, neither our own nor other countries.

314
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:57,375
But we always have the urge to take things from others,

315
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,959
to plunder from others, to borrow from others or

316
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,125
to deceive others. Because of this urge our children

317
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:04,959
will suffer, we will suffer and we will not be able

318
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,125
to achieve anything in this country.

319
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:12,291
In My in-law’s village (inaudible)…to build a lake.

320
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,166
The government gave them money in thousands for the purpose.

321
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,417
But the lake was never built.

322
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,000
They said that they had dug a hole to make a lake but then

323
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,875
they covered it again since they did not find any water.

324
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,750
But in fact the hole was never dug.

325
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,458
So where did the money go?

326
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,542
They sent it to Switzerland (bank).

327
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:32,291
So the banks will again borrow from Switzerland and send

328
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,041
the money again to Switzerland.

329
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,041
If the Sun acts in this way then we cannot survive

330
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,834
even for one day.

331
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,375
If he alone eats (consumes) everything, what can we eat?

332
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,625
Today we are celebrating the SANKRANTI.

333
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:50,083
Sankranti means a sort of Kranti (revolution) by which

334
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,000
we acquire the habit of giving.

335
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,333
Everybody says that we should have the habit of giving

336
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,625
but most of the people believe in donating something

337
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,333
to the priest.

338
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,333
Also, many people preach the art of giving

339
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,667
just to fill their own pockets.

340
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,875
This doesn’t have any meaning.

341
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,875
There is always a question of whom to give and why to give.

342
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,792
In fact, in all liberty and freedom, we should see

343
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,750
for ourselves what we are giving for our country,

344
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,500
for our brothers and sisters and our neighbors.

345
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:29,583
We should not be selfish, but give with all our heart

346
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,041
so that we get all the joy of giving.

347
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,208
When we give with all our heart, the joy that we get

348
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,583
cannot be compared with any other joy.

349
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,750
If we want to feel this kind of joy only, then we should

350
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:50,083
celebrate the SANKRANTI today.

351
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,458
Our nature should become like the Sun.

352
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,750
Whatever he is doing, he doesn’t have the feeling that

353
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,999
he is doing something. He is doing everything in AKARMA

354
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,999
(without the feeling of doing anything) and constantly

355
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,583
burning himself and giving you joy, light,

356
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,709
the essence of living, and he nourishes you.

357
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,875
We see the Sun every day and many people do Namaskar also,

358
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,041
but we only do Namaskar without imbibing

359
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,834
his qualities of giving.

360
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,417
I told you a very small thing:

361
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,542
that every Sahaja yogi

362
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:33,125
should plant a banyan tree in his garden.

363
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,000
Why do we have to take money from the government

364
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,875
for this purpose?

365
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,542
Just to plant a tree and put a fence around that

366
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,583
tree doesn’t need much money.

367
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,291
Even to smoke bidi (tobacco) costs more.

368
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,667
Try to do this small thing so that others should see that

369
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,542
you are at least doing something.

370
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,000
In spite of this we always think how we can get money

371
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:51,291
from others, how we can plunder others and how we can

372
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,917
save money at others cost.

373
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,500
Because of these tendencies within us,

374
00:23:56,959 --> 00:23:59,375
our country can never progress.

375
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,125
We did not have these tendencies before in people,

376
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,750
in the earlier days.

377
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:08,709
I can tell you that when I was young I saw people who

378
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:12,291
believed only in giving and never in taking.

379
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:15,917
I saw them giving only, they did not like taking.

380
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,041
Even the parents did not like it if the children took

381
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,125
something from others and would tell them to return it.

382
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,208
I still remember in My father’s house they had made

383
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,166
some chairs and also an umbrella, out of silver.

384
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,667
Everybody asked, “Why did you make these out of silver?”

385
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,166
So the reply was, “When we have marriage ceremonies,

386
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,458
instead of borrowing or hiring them,

387
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:37,250
it would be better that we have them with us once

388
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,208
and for all, because if we had to hire then sometimes

389
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,250
we did not get them in time because the earlier person

390
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,875
who had borrowed had not returned them.

391
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,542
And sometimes these umbrellas were lost because someone

392
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,458
had never returned them and so they got lost.”

393
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:47,917
So what I wanted to say is that if we have money,

394
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,750
we should invest it into something collective.

395
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,291
If you want to construct a badminton court,

396
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,709
then in that court everybody should be able to come

397
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:55,166
and play and we should not say that only my children

398
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,083
should play in that court. If somebody buys a car,

399
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,625
we should be able to take all the children to school.

400
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,333
Thus we should buy a big car so that all the children

401
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,291
can be taken to school.

402
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,458
This habit of being collective and being useful

403
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,750
to everybody, one should learn from the Sun.

404
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,999
And today is a special day when we can learn this thing

405
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:13,709
from the Sun. And we should take a vow that

406
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,333
“I’ll do something which is collective.”

407
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,291
I do not understand how people can eat without caring

408
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:22,250
for the common public.

409
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,999
You do not even worry about your neighbors and do not

410
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,750
do anything for the common people.

411
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:30,458
I told you a very small thing is to plant a tree.

412
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,542
We have got so many yogis in Maharashtra,

413
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,291
even if each one plants one tree and looks after it,

414
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:39,125
this will be certainly helpful to everybody.

415
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,250
Thus I request all of you to do something collective and

416
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,750
it will be useful to everybody.

417
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:49,041
But one should never think how much will I earn from it

418
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,917
and make money out of it.

419
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:53,291
It should not happen like the way we give money

420
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,000
to the priest.

421
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,583
One should open his heart and lovingly do something

422
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,583
for the collective and feel the joy out of it.

423
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:02,375
One should make it a habit.

424
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,542
I do not want to say that others should have

425
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,834
everything for free.

426
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,959
I never said that you do something for free for

427
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,291
the people who have come from abroad.

428
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:14,250
If you look at them you will see that they have brought

429
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,625
so many things for you from abroad to give you as presents.

430
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:21,375
Of course I have contributed a lot.

431
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,709
But they have also brought a lot of things of their own.

432
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,875
When I saw the presents here, I thought that they were

433
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,834
the presents which I had bought in Rome for you

434
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,959
but then they told Me that these were the presents

435
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:32,417
which they bought themselves and they had not

436
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,709
brought My presents.

437
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,166
They felt such a lot of joy to bring so many things

438
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,625
for you.

439
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:41,667
They do not even know in Italy to whom these presents were

440
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:44,041
to be given but they do not bother.

441
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:46,083
They leave it to Me to give them to the Sahaja yogis

442
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:48,125
here in India.

443
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,750
But in India we have a tendency to think only about

444
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,458
our children and about our mother.

445
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:55,959
Then the mother comes walking, limping on one leg.

446
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:58,750
Then you start saying that “My mother did not get

447
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,834
a high quality sari.”

448
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,583
Since I do not have one I give her a simple sari.

449
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,500
This is the tendency here.

450
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,125
But with the people from abroad it is just the opposite.

451
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,542
When they came here they came with so many presents

452
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:15,709
it seems they brought two tons of presents from abroad.

453
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,166
Even My hands starting paining while giving these

454
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,417
two tons of presents.

455
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:23,667
What I want to say is that they do not expect anything

456
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,959
from you. But your behavior should be such as to show

457
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,583
an example for them. And you should show them that

458
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,000
you are in no way inferior to them,

459
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,458
“We are here really to serve you, to welcome you,

460
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:35,083
whatever is possible from our side

461
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,000
we do not hesitate to do.”

462
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,041
It doesn’t cost any money nor any hard work.

463
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,917
The only thing is that we should change our outlook.

464
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,834
If even after coming in Sahaja Yoga we are not able

465
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,709
to change our nature in this manner then I do not feel

466
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:49,333
that we can change the entire humanity with Sahaja Yoga.

467
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,583
The biggest quality in us is to give to others.

468
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,083
And this quality we should imbibe within us.

469
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,041
In Sahaja yoga your Kundalini is awakened and you

470
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,250
realize your spirit but the essence of spirit is like that

471
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,625
of the Sun and this essence is of giving.

472
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:03,625
If you have seen one photograph of Mine, there is the Sun

473
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,583
shining on My heart; in fact there is a Sun in My heart

474
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,208
and because of this I never feel that I should take something

475
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,000
from them or to plunder anybody.

476
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:14,125
I do not understand from which part of your head this idea

477
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,208
of plundering them comes from.

478
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:19,166
This is a very strange behavior.

479
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,375
Sahaja yogis should not think in this way but on the contrary

480
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,667
every day we must think what we can give or do for others.

481
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,959
In Rahuri itself I have started an organization

482
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,792
whose name is “SAHAJ STREE SUDHAR” or “SAMAJSUDHAR”

483
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,709
(association for the welfare of women).

484
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,999
Through Life Eternal Trust we cannot use the money for

485
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,792
the welfare of the women thus we had to create

486
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,375
this organization.

487
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,542
This organization has been registered and people from Canada

488
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,083
and elsewhere are ready to donate to it but here I do not

489
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,125
find anybody to work for this organization.

490
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,083
If the local women take it upon themselves to work for this

491
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,375
organization only then it will succeed.

492
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,542
We have acquired land and all the facilities but we do not

493
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:52,208
find time to devote for this organization.

494
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,417
So how can we go to this place?

495
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:56,208
But one should remember that people are coming from abroad

496
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,125
with the money to donate for your organization.

497
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,750
They have brought fourteen machines for the women here.

498
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,625
You can see women loitering about without doing anything.

499
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:04,875
You can ask them to work so that they can earn

500
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,583
something out of it. And they can prosper.

501
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:10,041
At least these things we should try to think about.

502
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,041
Instead of that we always think about ourselves.

503
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,875
So the persons who are in Sahaja Yoga should know that this

504
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:15,959
selfish attitude is not accepted in Sahaja Yoga.

505
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:18,583
We should think in terms of global advantage.

506
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,792
The lives (Vibhouti) of saint are for the salvation

507
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,458
of the world. And also for the salvation of saint lives,

508
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:24,000
this world exists.

509
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:26,500
Thus the saints will be blessed by this attitude…

510
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:30,041
(VIBHOUTI means Ashes with which Shiva is decorated).

511
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:33,875
Now you have become saints you should behave like saints

512
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:36,417
and the first quality of a saint is giving.

513
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:39,750
You have never heard of a saint plundering anybody.

514
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,542
If a saint thinks of cheating he does not remain a saint.

515
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,792
Thus from our side we should always think how much

516
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,792
we can give and what we can give,

517
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:52,458
how much love we can give.

518
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,417
And how many people we can help.

519
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,542
All our attention should be for this purpose.

520
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:59,208
Nowadays there are welfare associations

521
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:02,041
just for election purposes.

522
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:05,417
We should not create any such type of welfare association.

523
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,208
But we should create associations in which we can

524
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,500
work selflessly and our love should be NIRVAJYA (selfless)

525
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:12,500
and we should not expect anything in return.

526
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:15,083
And there are no limits for our love, it is an endless love.

527
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,542
When we have this kind of love automatically

528
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,834
we will know what is to be done.

529
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,583
The improvements should be done gradually and every

530
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,417
Sahaja yogi should contribute to this collective welfare.

531
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,625
We should try to devote our time for this purpose and

532
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,667
work hard to achieve our goals. It should not happen

533
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:31,417
that “Shri Mataji has come, She gives a talk,

534
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,542
and when She goes everything is finished.”

535
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,542
These people (from abroad) have done a lot.

536
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,999
They have started schools and social welfare.

537
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,125
We should also start something in this manner.

538
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,375
Sahaja Yoga should not become an association of people

539
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:44,999
who have realized the spirit and are swimming in the joy

540
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:48,000
but are lazy lumps.

541
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,709
It should not happen this way.

542
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:54,959
We should try to see how we can help others.

543
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:57,875
We should open our eyes to look around us with love

544
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,208
and try to see how we can help others.

545
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:04,834
Still I have not been able to move to India.

546
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,291
Once I come back to India you will see that

547
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,834
I will make everyone work.

548
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,959
Thus it is advisable to start working before I come.

549
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,458
Sahaja Yoga is not meant only for sitting and meditating.

550
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,333
For meditating why do you need Sahaja Yoga?

551
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,333
You can go the Himalayas.

552
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,417
If you want to stay here and be in Sahaja Yoga then

553
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,709
the common people should be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

554
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,291
But Sahaja Yoga should not become like these

555
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,125
modern welfare organizations.

556
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,834
We should try to achieve our goals with full sincerity

557
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,417
and only then we can say that we have established Sahaja Yoga.

558
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,333
Now I heard a lot of praise for Me.

559
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:39,709
I heard the songs and they gave Me a lot of Joy and

560
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,667
satisfaction that people have recognized Me.

561
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,583
But you should remember one thing – you should work

562
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,458
in order to know yourself because you cannot see

563
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,417
yourself in the mirror.

564
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:51,875
You should be able to see what you have achieved,

565
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,999
like in the earlier days you used to look after

566
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:56,375
your household, your children. In the same manner,

567
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,959
if you are not able to work for the collective,

568
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,125
then in My opinion, you have not achieved anything

569
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,417
through Sahaja Yoga.

570
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:05,709
You have remained where you were,

571
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,000
you have not progressed at all.

572
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,458
Next year when I come, you should be able to tell Me

573
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:14,999
how many banyan trees you have planted.

574
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:19,041
Secondly, you should be able to tell Me what collective

575
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,166
or social work you have done.

576
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,750
If you try to look around you will definitely be able

577
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,291
to see some collective work which you can do

578
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:28,542
and you should do.

579
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:31,125
I’m sure you will be able to do it very well.

580
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,417
It doesn’t need any money – only you have to decide

581
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:35,375
within your heart. When I started Sahaja Yoga,

582
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,333
at that time I’d given realization to one lady only

583
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,625
and I started without any money.

584
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,291
I did not have support from anybody but even then

585
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,417
I started Sahaja Yoga.

586
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:48,000
But because of honesty of the work and the consistency,

587
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,417
it has spread so much.

588
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:51,917
Now each one of you, man or woman,

589
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,999
you have the responsibility that when you will

590
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,792
introduce Sahaja Yoga to the general public,

591
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,250
you will be able to give them some proof of the general

592
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,834
well being. You need not break any law for this.

593
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,500
You need not do anything wrong nor need you do

594
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:11,667
anything unlawful. In a very simple way if you just

595
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,333
open your eyes you will be able to see what you can do

596
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,417
for the general welfare of the people,

597
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:18,750
how you can help the wellbeing of the people.

598
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,250
And I’m here to give you all the strength and energy

599
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,166
to do this work.

600
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,417
We do not need any vote nor any money or anything else.

601
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,375
You should give you Me a promise that without expecting

602
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,625
anything in return you will start working for

603
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:32,500
the welfare of the people.

604
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,000
Sometimes, it might so happen that when people start

605
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,625
some welfare work they go round asking for funds.

606
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,625
This is wrong. We should not ask for money in the beginning.

607
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,250
First you should start some work which does not need money.

608
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,500
Everyone feels that without money we cannot do anything.

609
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,792
You have got the powers so why do you need money?

610
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:50,458
If somebody is sick or not well in your neighborhood

611
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:54,625
then you can go and visit him and try to soothe that person.

612
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,542
Instead of that, what I see is that

613
00:33:57,917 --> 00:33:59,333
you bring the sick person to Me.

614
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:01,041
The other day, someone brought

615
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,834
an injured person to Me. He had a broken arm.

616
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,834
A Sahaja yogi could have treated him in two minutes and

617
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,834
made him well but instead of that, they brought him to Me

618
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,333
and that too right in the middle of a public program

619
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,125
and asked Me to treat his arm.

620
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,792
You are so many and all the powers are flowing

621
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,083
through your hands but still you do not use them.

622
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:18,125
If you are not able to treat even these small ailments

623
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:22,999
what is the use of you being a Sahaja yogi? Someone says,

624
00:34:23,834 --> 00:34:26,500
"my mother is sick, my father has broken his leg.”

625
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:31,625
Instead of bringing them to Me you can easily treat them.

626
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:35,083
You do have the powers, try to use them.

627
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:37,750
Thus you should be able to help the people without

628
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:41,834
expecting anything in return and with full Joy.

629
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:45,125
You will be able to feel a lot of joy when you have

630
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,250
the feeling that you do not do anything but you are just

631
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:53,583
an instrument of God and you are living in this world,

632
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:57,999
in this country and you are giving something special to them.

633
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,083
It is such a big thing, such a big understanding.

634
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,959
With such a feeling, if all of you decide to work,

635
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,375
then, you will be able to do something for others

636
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:10,166
and other people will see what Sahaja Yoga is.

637
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,999
Now people think what is Sahaja Yoga –

638
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:17,041
just everybody meditating together and that’s all.

639
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,792
Even if there is some problem in the country Sahaja yogis

640
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,166
are just sitting in meditation.

641
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,417
One man came and told Me, “My wife doesn’t cook.”

642
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,458
I asked, “Why?” He said, “She just meditates.”

643
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,625
So I said, “Is it so? But who told her that?”

644
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,959
First she should cook, for meditation even

645
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,166
five minutes are sufficient.

646
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,667
I have given you the power and the energy to cook well.

647
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,750
Thus one should have the confidence

648
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,667
that you are capable of work.

649
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,166
I am giving you the powers, you can assimilate them.

650
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,667
If you just meditate every day it is not sufficient.

651
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,999
You have to see what wellbeing you are

652
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:55,000
giving to the others.

653
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,750
But instead of that, you always think about your own wellbeing

654
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:59,667
and come and ask Me to treat your son, your father,

655
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,458
your mother, or ask that you should get a good job.

656
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:02,875
And you want that I should also come to your house

657
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,041
to eat, do this, do that.

658
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,250
This way, you try to impose your will upon Me

659
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:10,041
but about you, what can you do?

660
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,166
You should always remember that you have to do something.

661
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,125
“I will show Shri Mataji what I’m capable of,

662
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:17,250
to do something special.”

663
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,709
We should decide this once and for all.

664
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:26,166
I have an image in front of My eyes as Shri Gyaneshwara

665
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:32,667
has said, "BOLTE PIYUSHANCHE SAGAR."

666
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,208
(Words or sayings are like the oceans of nectar)

667
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:42,917
Where is it? I want to see it.

668
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:46,999
Thus on this auspicious day I give you

669
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,250
all My sweet blessings that you will help everyone

670
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,166
and look after their wellbeing and you will treat

671
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,125
everyone with love and you will talk sweetly,

672
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:59,458
full of love.

673
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,333
He is saying you should put your hands

674
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,750
like this to say that you are bound by Mother's words.

675
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,000
And we will try to do good to others and

676
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,667
we will be very kind to each other.

677
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:44,291
I've been telling them that we have to be collective

678
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:47,083
not among only Sahaja Yogis but with others also.

679
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,709
We should see surroundings, what's wrong where,

680
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:55,333
how we can help. We have many social obligations

681
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:57,458
which we have to fulfill.

682
00:37:57,834 --> 00:38:00,583
Now you have reached the stage where you can do that

683
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:06,542
without forming any social organization which collects money

684
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:09,458
and have saints and things that kind of a nonsense.

685
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:13,875
But you can see around yourself who are the needy,

686
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,417
to whom you can help.

687
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,959
And that is how you can really give

688
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:23,000
a very positive form to Sahaja Yoga.

689
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,792
Marathi

690
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,667
Rahurila

691
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:29,083
I'll be giving this water to all of you

692
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:34,959
all the leaders and aslo..

693
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,542
you can take it.

694
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,834
this water is very good for

695
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:45,166
all diseases of the Mooladhara chakra.
