00:00:02.147 --> 00:00:07.336
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 10 September 1995.

00:09:40.726 --> 00:09:45.082
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

00:09:45.242 --> 00:09:49.101
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

00:09:49.343 --> 00:09:52.327
I don’t know what to say.

00:09:54.843 --> 00:09:58.550
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.488
because most of you come from a culture

00:10:03.648 --> 00:10:07.418
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

00:10:07.578 --> 00:10:11.516
They never realised how important it was that,

00:10:12.015 --> 00:10:15.865
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

00:10:17.538 --> 00:10:22.609
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

00:10:24.953 --> 00:10:32.820
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

00:10:33.171 --> 00:10:38.484
And also the desire to know the Divine

00:10:47.326 --> 00:10:50.398
vanishes also in the thin air

00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:56.953
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

00:10:58.195 --> 00:11:02.421
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:11.749
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

00:11:12.054 --> 00:11:16.820
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:25.780
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:32.051
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

00:11:36.308 --> 00:11:46.398
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

00:11:46.558 --> 00:11:52.343
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

00:11:55.179 --> 00:12:00.862
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

00:12:01.022 --> 00:12:04.949
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

00:12:05.109 --> 00:12:07.621
and entertained us the most.

00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:11.058
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

00:12:11.218 --> 00:12:16.044
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:19.945
and they think that you are laughing at them.

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:31.117
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.667
was more than what one would expect

00:12:37.827 --> 00:12:42.937
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

00:12:43.097 --> 00:12:48.961
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:51.418
that made us so happy.

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:58.055
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

00:12:58.215 --> 00:13:05.020
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

00:13:05.957 --> 00:13:10.883
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

00:13:11.043 --> 00:13:14.965
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

00:13:16.035 --> 00:13:21.461
His manifestation within you is so evident.

00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:26.801
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

00:13:27.246 --> 00:13:29.793
so very different from other people.

00:13:30.886 --> 00:13:34.254
One day I was travelling from London

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:40.640
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.023
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

00:13:46.183 --> 00:13:53.925
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

00:13:54.597 --> 00:13:59.476
I asked her, “Who are you?”

00:13:59.636 --> 00:14:03.507
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

00:14:03.772 --> 00:14:09.289
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:12.324
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.824
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

00:14:19.879 --> 00:14:25.242
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

00:14:25.402 --> 00:14:28.597
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:37.246
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

00:14:38.347 --> 00:14:42.269
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

00:14:42.613 --> 00:14:45.422
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

00:14:45.582 --> 00:14:50.515
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

00:14:50.675 --> 00:14:53.441
He’s not talked about the source.

00:14:57.011 --> 00:14:59.965
I said, “Better find out,

00:15:00.511 --> 00:15:04.890
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:10.750
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.871
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

00:15:15.933 --> 00:15:22.652
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

00:15:22.996 --> 00:15:24.625
and not by the Father.

00:15:24.785 --> 00:15:27.719
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:33.140
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.586
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

00:15:36.746 --> 00:15:48.355
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:53.433
also about the Jews.

00:15:54.488 --> 00:15:59.867
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

00:16:00.027 --> 00:16:02.425
nor about Shri Ganesh.

00:16:04.206 --> 00:16:11.594
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

00:16:11.754 --> 00:16:19.414
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

00:16:19.574 --> 00:16:25.215
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.851
So now, when we deal with our children,

00:16:33.011 --> 00:16:38.898
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:43.339
they are very innocent, very simple;

00:16:43.777 --> 00:16:49.359
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:52.214
and they lose their moorings.

00:16:56.074 --> 00:17:03.086
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

00:17:03.246 --> 00:17:08.152
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:15.887
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

00:17:16.683 --> 00:17:21.027
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:28.281
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

00:17:28.441 --> 00:17:31.738
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:36.167
But you should know He is on every chakra.

00:17:37.277 --> 00:17:46.734
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

00:17:46.894 --> 00:17:49.167
specially the spiritual one.

00:17:50.207 --> 00:17:54.691
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

00:17:56.402 --> 00:18:00.746
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

00:18:01.527 --> 00:18:08.277
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

00:18:09.152 --> 00:18:18.035
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:26.743
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

00:18:26.903 --> 00:18:28.597
It was Sahaj.

00:18:29.222 --> 00:18:35.726
The life before Self-realisation was different.

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:38.241
You got your transformation

00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:48.292
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.828
But here now we have to see

00:18:51.988 --> 00:18:57.078
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

00:18:57.238 --> 00:19:02.017
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

00:19:02.177 --> 00:19:10.398
you have to cure people, you have to love them

00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:13.164
and you have to be compassionate

00:19:13.324 --> 00:19:21.125
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:25.930
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:35.537
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:38.427
You can project it to others.

00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:46.739
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:53.763
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.921
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

00:19:59.081 --> 00:20:03.741
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:07.272
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

00:20:07.432 --> 00:20:11.929
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

00:20:12.089 --> 00:20:15.030
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.374
This is what you have to practise,

00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:23.948
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:29.701
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

00:20:30.575 --> 00:20:33.257
Now, for example, say

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:43.301
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:47.218
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

00:20:47.378 --> 00:20:52.921
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:57.315
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

00:20:58.745 --> 00:21:06.534
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:14.655
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:21.385
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

00:21:22.455 --> 00:21:24.386
Not very difficult.

00:21:24.737 --> 00:21:29.515
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

00:21:29.675 --> 00:21:35.480
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:40.804
The energy will diminish.

00:21:40.964 --> 00:21:47.917
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

00:21:49.018 --> 00:21:54.865
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

00:21:55.025 --> 00:21:57.349
you are not ordinary people

00:21:57.509 --> 00:22:02.822
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

00:22:03.564 --> 00:22:12.568
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

00:22:12.728 --> 00:22:16.220
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:21.341
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

00:22:21.501 --> 00:22:27.397
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

00:22:27.557 --> 00:22:30.833
or how to deliberately do this.

00:22:30.993 --> 00:22:34.068
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:37.685
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

00:22:37.845 --> 00:22:50.021
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

00:22:50.181 --> 00:22:54.228
but just your majestic personality.

00:22:55.243 --> 00:22:59.087
This personality is here now, you see,

00:22:59.985 --> 00:23:03.727
is sitting in such a majestic manner

00:23:04.915 --> 00:23:11.013
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

00:23:11.173 --> 00:23:20.478
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.607
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

00:23:27.767 --> 00:23:30.970
I don’t think is alright.

00:23:31.275 --> 00:23:36.544
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

00:23:36.704 --> 00:23:40.071
so much ego, so much conditioning.

00:23:40.618 --> 00:23:47.888
But something within you can rise above others

00:23:48.048 --> 00:23:58.470
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

00:23:58.907 --> 00:24:01.138
where you stand with yourself.

00:24:01.298 --> 00:24:05.075
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

00:24:05.235 --> 00:24:09.880
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:18.087
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

00:24:18.336 --> 00:24:23.354
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

00:24:23.514 --> 00:24:30.123
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

00:24:30.896 --> 00:24:33.734
But the innocence that you have,

00:24:34.617 --> 00:24:39.761
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:46.983
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

00:24:47.143 --> 00:24:50.951
you are not properly dressed up

00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:54.487
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

00:24:54.647 --> 00:24:57.753
that they expect every other person to be.

00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:00.947
It’s a funny thing that in this world

00:25:01.108 --> 00:25:04.456
all human beings expect others to be very good.

00:25:04.616 --> 00:25:06.933
Everybody should be a hero or something

00:25:07.093 --> 00:25:09.784
– what about themselves they never think!

00:25:09.944 --> 00:25:13.136
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

00:25:13.296 --> 00:25:17.199
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:22.816
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

00:25:22.976 --> 00:25:27.667
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

00:25:27.827 --> 00:25:30.870
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:36.488
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

00:25:36.648 --> 00:25:42.753
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

00:25:42.913 --> 00:25:44.882
as a child does.

00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:51.011
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

00:25:51.171 --> 00:25:55.363
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

00:25:55.523 --> 00:26:01.292
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

00:26:01.452 --> 00:26:05.839
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:14.444
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

00:26:14.952 --> 00:26:20.355
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

00:26:20.515 --> 00:26:24.499
the whole world get worried about it,

00:26:24.757 --> 00:26:28.597
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

00:26:28.757 --> 00:26:34.933
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:39.081
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

00:26:39.241 --> 00:26:43.324
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

00:26:43.484 --> 00:26:49.230
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:53.824
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

00:26:53.984 --> 00:26:58.351
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

00:26:58.866 --> 00:27:07.128
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

00:27:07.288 --> 00:27:09.647
but just spontaneously.

00:27:10.515 --> 00:27:17.730
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.628
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

00:27:21.788 --> 00:27:24.628
You can’t run away from the society.

00:27:24.788 --> 00:27:32.679
You start getting all the rapport with such people

00:27:33.038 --> 00:27:37.426
who are talking about things

00:27:37.586 --> 00:27:41.581
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

00:27:41.741 --> 00:27:45.749
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

00:27:47.202 --> 00:27:50.988
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

00:27:51.148 --> 00:27:56.992
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

00:27:58.874 --> 00:28:05.761
In the sense that – when I was in London

00:28:05.921 --> 00:28:10.355
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

00:28:10.515 --> 00:28:14.355
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

00:28:14.515 --> 00:28:16.483
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

00:28:16.644 --> 00:28:20.238
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:23.363
all the married women have to wear this.

00:28:23.523 --> 00:28:28.847
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

00:28:29.007 --> 00:28:30.589
So I said that,

00:28:30.749 --> 00:28:35.105
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

00:28:35.265 --> 00:28:38.558
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

00:28:38.718 --> 00:28:44.968
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:50.902
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:56.167
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

00:28:56.327 --> 00:29:00.866
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

00:29:01.413 --> 00:29:04.675
For the innocence, I think

00:29:04.835 --> 00:29:09.905
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

00:29:12.061 --> 00:29:16.191
And that’s how it is a society, today,

00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:22.636
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

00:29:22.796 --> 00:29:24.652
Every individual is separate,

00:29:24.812 --> 00:29:29.066
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

00:29:29.226 --> 00:29:35.433
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

00:29:35.593 --> 00:29:39.847
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

00:29:40.007 --> 00:29:43.292
or greed behind the whole thing.

00:29:43.452 --> 00:29:48.949
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

00:29:49.109 --> 00:29:54.488
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

00:29:54.648 --> 00:29:58.003
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:03.007
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

00:30:04.124 --> 00:30:08.995
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

00:30:09.155 --> 00:30:12.480
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.370
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.214
“What will they misunderstand?”

00:30:17.374 --> 00:30:21.441
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

00:30:21.601 --> 00:30:24.277
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

00:30:24.437 --> 00:30:28.003
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

00:30:28.163 --> 00:30:32.542
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

00:30:32.702 --> 00:30:37.441
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:40.003
But then I noticed it’s too much

00:30:40.163 --> 00:30:44.066
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

00:30:44.226 --> 00:30:47.214
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

00:30:47.374 --> 00:30:51.034
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

00:30:51.194 --> 00:30:54.503
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

00:30:54.663 --> 00:31:04.175
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

00:31:04.335 --> 00:31:11.718
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

00:31:11.968 --> 00:31:16.870
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.097
I just can’t understand how they accept.

00:31:19.257 --> 00:31:24.827
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:29.847
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

00:31:30.007 --> 00:31:33.503
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:38.261
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

00:31:38.421 --> 00:31:44.089
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

00:31:44.249 --> 00:31:49.519
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:54.749
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

00:31:56.725 --> 00:31:59.673
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:02.002
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

00:32:02.162 --> 00:32:05.456
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

00:32:05.616 --> 00:32:09.902
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

00:32:10.062 --> 00:32:13.092
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

00:32:13.252 --> 00:32:17.967
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:23.593
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

00:32:23.753 --> 00:32:27.761
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

00:32:27.921 --> 00:32:36.014
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

00:32:36.174 --> 00:32:40.081
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

00:32:40.241 --> 00:32:46.094
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

00:32:46.254 --> 00:32:50.058
but every time you see something you find

00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:54.722
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

00:32:54.882 --> 00:32:58.449
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

00:32:58.609 --> 00:33:05.757
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

00:33:07.007 --> 00:33:12.035
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

00:33:12.195 --> 00:33:14.199
I don’t understand.

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:18.441
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

00:33:18.601 --> 00:33:21.886
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

00:33:22.046 --> 00:33:24.066
“So what? What’s wrong?”

00:33:24.226 --> 00:33:28.011
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

00:33:28.171 --> 00:33:31.816
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:37.245
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

00:33:37.405 --> 00:33:42.331
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

00:33:42.491 --> 00:33:48.636
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

00:33:48.796 --> 00:33:53.597
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

00:33:53.757 --> 00:33:59.195
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.855
you should be very careful,

00:34:02.015 --> 00:34:04.791
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

00:34:04.951 --> 00:34:09.101
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

00:34:10.577 --> 00:34:19.144
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

00:34:19.304 --> 00:34:25.531
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

00:34:28.062 --> 00:34:32.324
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

00:34:32.484 --> 00:34:39.718
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

00:34:40.796 --> 00:34:45.870
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.956
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

00:34:50.116 --> 00:34:54.480
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.378
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

00:34:59.538 --> 00:35:04.534
how He has made their attention so beautiful

00:35:04.694 --> 00:35:08.870
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.366
all the innocent things of the world.”

00:35:12.702 --> 00:35:17.425
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

00:35:17.585 --> 00:35:20.785
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

00:35:20.945 --> 00:35:22.511
There are many who are struggling

00:35:22.671 --> 00:35:27.988
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

00:35:28.148 --> 00:35:32.037
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:35.744
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

00:35:35.905 --> 00:35:39.191
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

00:35:39.351 --> 00:35:43.929
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

00:35:45.663 --> 00:35:49.824
That shows that there are so many people still

00:35:49.984 --> 00:35:55.519
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

00:35:55.679 --> 00:35:57.278
and they want to enjoy it.

00:35:57.438 --> 00:36:00.777
But a society has to be created of that kind.

00:36:00.937 --> 00:36:06.167
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

00:36:06.327 --> 00:36:13.538
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.755
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

00:36:16.915 --> 00:36:19.822
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

00:36:19.982 --> 00:36:24.910
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:28.851
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

00:36:29.359 --> 00:36:33.636
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

00:36:33.796 --> 00:36:38.355
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

00:36:38.515 --> 00:36:42.230
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:48.949
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:52.769
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

00:36:52.929 --> 00:36:55.141
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

00:36:55.301 --> 00:36:58.386
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

00:36:58.546 --> 00:37:00.902
And one of them then turned around and said,

00:37:01.062 --> 00:37:04.503
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

00:37:04.663 --> 00:37:06.745
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

00:37:06.905 --> 00:37:09.574
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

00:37:09.734 --> 00:37:14.863
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

00:37:15.023 --> 00:37:18.699
you have to project now, to project towards others.

00:37:18.859 --> 00:37:22.597
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

00:37:22.757 --> 00:37:25.589
just with one glance you can put that person right,

00:37:25.749 --> 00:37:31.089
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:34.390
In a way that’s a projection.

00:37:35.265 --> 00:37:39.277
Around your society, around where you are working,

00:37:39.437 --> 00:37:44.581
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

00:37:44.741 --> 00:37:47.910
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:53.745
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

00:37:53.905 --> 00:37:57.589
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

00:37:57.749 --> 00:38:01.745
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:05.011
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

00:38:05.171 --> 00:38:08.956
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

00:38:09.116 --> 00:38:13.472
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

00:38:13.632 --> 00:38:17.238
You have those qualities within you

00:38:17.398 --> 00:38:20.714
because potentially you had them before

00:38:20.874 --> 00:38:25.113
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

00:38:25.273 --> 00:38:29.242
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:36.636
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

00:38:36.796 --> 00:38:40.886
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

00:38:41.046 --> 00:38:45.706
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

00:38:45.866 --> 00:38:49.441
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:53.277
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

00:38:53.437 --> 00:38:59.261
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:03.042
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

00:39:03.202 --> 00:39:08.238
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

00:39:08.398 --> 00:39:11.867
It is not a coincidence we should say.

00:39:12.741 --> 00:39:17.792
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

00:39:17.952 --> 00:39:21.378
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

00:39:21.538 --> 00:39:25.081
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

00:39:25.241 --> 00:39:28.345
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

00:39:28.505 --> 00:39:32.085
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

00:39:33.171 --> 00:39:36.237
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

00:39:36.397 --> 00:39:38.699
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

00:39:38.859 --> 00:39:42.000
He put them under the seat and did all that.

00:39:43.226 --> 00:39:48.995
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

00:39:49.155 --> 00:39:52.928
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

00:39:54.405 --> 00:39:58.386
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

00:39:58.546 --> 00:40:01.110
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:05.980
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.995
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

00:40:09.155 --> 00:40:11.441
You see, it is the power that you have.

00:40:11.601 --> 00:40:16.421
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

00:40:16.718 --> 00:40:23.991
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

00:40:24.257 --> 00:40:27.929
You see, how children understand love.

00:40:28.264 --> 00:40:33.842
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

00:40:34.002 --> 00:40:39.780
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

00:40:40.257 --> 00:40:45.019
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

00:40:45.179 --> 00:40:49.730
and they were very troublesome to begin with

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.677
and the parents were worried about them.

00:40:52.837 --> 00:40:55.179
They sent them to Dharamsala

00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:00.214
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:03.886
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

00:41:04.046 --> 00:41:08.597
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

00:41:08.757 --> 00:41:11.574
they came back and the parents asked them,

00:41:11.734 --> 00:41:14.512
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:17.662
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

00:41:17.822 --> 00:41:20.683
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

00:41:20.843 --> 00:41:26.726
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

00:41:28.007 --> 00:41:30.724
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

00:41:30.884 --> 00:41:35.589
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

00:41:35.749 --> 00:41:39.120
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.488
We are not bothered.”

00:41:40.648 --> 00:41:43.527
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

00:41:43.687 --> 00:41:45.949
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:48.660
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.699
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:56.824
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

00:41:56.984 --> 00:42:00.817
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

00:42:00.977 --> 00:42:06.125
Very much satisfied, dignified.

00:42:07.062 --> 00:42:11.512
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

00:42:11.672 --> 00:42:14.433
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

00:42:14.593 --> 00:42:17.335
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

00:42:17.495 --> 00:42:20.118
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

00:42:20.278 --> 00:42:24.847
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

00:42:25.007 --> 00:42:28.484
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

00:42:28.992 --> 00:42:31.394
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

00:42:31.554 --> 00:42:35.176
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

00:42:35.336 --> 00:42:43.146
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

00:42:43.929 --> 00:42:46.855
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

00:42:47.015 --> 00:42:49.215
but I have not been with them for a long time,

00:42:49.375 --> 00:42:51.725
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

00:42:51.885 --> 00:42:56.203
but look at the love that they have.

00:42:56.429 --> 00:42:59.715
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

00:42:59.875 --> 00:43:02.793
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

00:43:02.953 --> 00:43:05.004
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

00:43:05.164 --> 00:43:08.246
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

00:43:08.406 --> 00:43:12.816
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

00:43:12.976 --> 00:43:19.590
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:25.887
and so much they admire, they want it.

00:43:26.047 --> 00:43:31.972
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

00:43:32.132 --> 00:43:36.950
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:41.077
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

00:43:41.237 --> 00:43:44.566
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

00:43:44.726 --> 00:43:48.730
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:50.579
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

00:43:50.739 --> 00:43:53.551
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

00:43:53.711 --> 00:43:59.422
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

00:44:00.828 --> 00:44:03.808
and we enjoyed all that very much.

00:44:03.968 --> 00:44:10.484
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:17.449
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

00:44:17.609 --> 00:44:22.461
creating something sweet of this kind.

00:44:22.672 --> 00:44:27.566
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

00:44:27.726 --> 00:44:34.738
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

00:44:34.898 --> 00:44:39.676
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

00:44:39.836 --> 00:44:43.261
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

00:44:43.421 --> 00:44:46.465
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

00:44:46.625 --> 00:44:49.183
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

00:44:49.343 --> 00:44:53.472
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

00:44:53.632 --> 00:44:58.496
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

00:44:58.656 --> 00:45:03.051
so they got equipped from within.

00:45:03.211 --> 00:45:07.777
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

00:45:07.937 --> 00:45:11.660
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:19.144
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

00:45:19.304 --> 00:45:22.074
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

00:45:22.234 --> 00:45:25.324
also know that we have to give it to others.

00:45:25.484 --> 00:45:29.847
We have to pour this into others.

00:45:30.007 --> 00:45:33.332
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

00:45:33.492 --> 00:45:37.285
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

00:45:37.445 --> 00:45:42.613
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:47.558
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

00:45:47.718 --> 00:45:51.824
And Shiva had to cut His head

00:45:51.984 --> 00:45:56.472
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

00:45:56.632 --> 00:46:02.494
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

00:46:02.654 --> 00:46:06.676
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

00:46:06.836 --> 00:46:11.285
because in innocence you become a person

00:46:11.445 --> 00:46:14.855
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

00:46:15.015 --> 00:46:19.153
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

00:46:19.313 --> 00:46:24.922
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

00:46:25.726 --> 00:46:31.535
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

00:46:31.695 --> 00:46:33.105
There was a king in China.

00:46:33.265 --> 00:46:36.926
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

00:46:37.086 --> 00:46:47.426
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

00:46:47.586 --> 00:46:51.859
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

00:46:52.445 --> 00:46:55.816
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

00:46:55.976 --> 00:47:00.949
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:03.051
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:09.090
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:13.842
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

00:47:14.002 --> 00:47:16.678
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

00:47:16.838 --> 00:47:20.678
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:24.412
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

00:47:24.572 --> 00:47:32.517
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

00:47:32.853 --> 00:47:35.955
So all the cocks were together.

00:47:36.502 --> 00:47:40.701
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

00:47:40.861 --> 00:47:44.084
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

00:47:44.244 --> 00:47:47.314
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

00:47:47.474 --> 00:47:49.576
he was just standing straight.

00:47:49.736 --> 00:47:54.240
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.561
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

00:47:59.721 --> 00:48:03.889
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

00:48:04.049 --> 00:48:07.568
where they were having these fights.

00:48:07.728 --> 00:48:12.041
And this was the only cock which stood up.

00:48:12.213 --> 00:48:17.904
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

00:48:18.064 --> 00:48:22.576
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

00:48:22.736 --> 00:48:26.942
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

00:48:27.103 --> 00:48:30.327
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

00:48:30.487 --> 00:48:34.787
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

00:48:34.947 --> 00:48:39.529
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

00:48:39.689 --> 00:48:45.291
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

00:48:45.451 --> 00:48:54.885
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

00:48:55.045 --> 00:48:58.108
if you take to your innocence.

00:48:58.537 --> 00:49:03.432
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

00:49:03.592 --> 00:49:08.975
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.939
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

00:49:13.099 --> 00:49:15.338
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

00:49:15.498 --> 00:49:18.197
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

00:49:18.357 --> 00:49:20.471
It rained so much so that they said,

00:49:20.631 --> 00:49:25.525
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

00:49:25.685 --> 00:49:27.922
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

00:49:28.082 --> 00:49:33.556
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

00:49:33.716 --> 00:49:39.756
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

00:49:40.287 --> 00:49:47.283
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

00:49:47.443 --> 00:49:52.576
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

00:49:52.818 --> 00:49:56.588
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

00:49:56.748 --> 00:50:02.111
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

00:50:02.271 --> 00:50:08.194
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

00:50:08.354 --> 00:50:13.438
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

00:50:13.598 --> 00:50:18.486
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

00:50:18.646 --> 00:50:32.241
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

00:50:32.401 --> 00:50:34.735
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

00:50:34.895 --> 00:50:39.892
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

00:50:40.052 --> 00:50:46.635
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:52.906
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

00:50:53.066 --> 00:50:56.648
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

00:50:56.808 --> 00:51:00.445
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

00:51:00.605 --> 00:51:05.437
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

00:51:05.597 --> 00:51:09.921
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

00:51:10.081 --> 00:51:15.195
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

00:51:15.355 --> 00:51:18.484
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

00:51:18.644 --> 00:51:23.093
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

00:51:23.253 --> 00:51:30.800
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

00:51:31.456 --> 00:51:34.552
How He guides you and how He helps you.

00:51:34.712 --> 00:51:36.957
How He takes you to [the] right path.

00:51:37.117 --> 00:51:39.566
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

00:51:39.726 --> 00:51:44.941
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:49.535
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

00:51:49.695 --> 00:51:54.660
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:59.027
He takes you to the righteous road.

00:51:59.187 --> 00:52:03.222
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

00:52:03.382 --> 00:52:05.933
You always meet friends here and there.

00:52:06.093 --> 00:52:08.347
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

00:52:08.507 --> 00:52:10.949
And that is how He works.

00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:20.683
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

00:52:20.843 --> 00:52:23.324
because you are His ganas.

00:52:23.484 --> 00:52:26.367
But the ganas have to work!

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:33.108
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

00:52:33.295 --> 00:52:41.753
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

00:52:41.913 --> 00:52:47.863
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

00:52:48.023 --> 00:52:50.933
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

00:52:51.093 --> 00:52:54.394
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

00:52:54.554 --> 00:52:57.468
He gives you all the good time.

00:52:58.413 --> 00:53:00.832
Then what are we doing about it?

00:53:00.992 --> 00:53:06.160
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.922
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

00:53:10.484 --> 00:53:14.347
What can we do as antibodies?

00:53:14.507 --> 00:53:26.259
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

00:53:26.861 --> 00:53:33.282
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

00:53:33.469 --> 00:53:39.904
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

00:53:40.064 --> 00:53:42.490
You may melt away many people.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:49.662
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

00:53:49.822 --> 00:53:54.474
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

00:53:54.634 --> 00:53:58.230
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

00:53:58.391 --> 00:54:03.089
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:05.948
Because you are so powerful.

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:09.200
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

00:54:09.361 --> 00:54:14.638
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

00:54:14.798 --> 00:54:18.068
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

00:54:18.228 --> 00:54:22.232
And all that works out so well.

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:25.912
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

00:54:26.072 --> 00:54:31.928
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

00:54:32.088 --> 00:54:35.111
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:35.368 --> 00:54:40.256
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:43.416
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

00:54:44.767 --> 00:54:48.217
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

00:54:48.377 --> 00:54:52.041
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

00:54:52.783 --> 00:54:56.670
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:00.209
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

00:55:00.369 --> 00:55:03.006
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:07.881
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:13.245
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:17.553
But you are not to feel any strain.

00:55:17.713 --> 00:55:21.959
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:24.889
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

00:55:25.049 --> 00:55:27.334
– confidence and faith in yourself.

00:55:27.494 --> 00:55:32.451
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:36.345
which is nothing but compassion and love.

00:55:37.548 --> 00:55:39.428
If you have that faith

00:55:39.588 --> 00:55:44.924
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

00:55:46.462 --> 00:55:54.502
of having [a] relationship with others.

00:55:56.166 --> 00:56:03.650
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.181
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

00:56:09.353 --> 00:56:13.045
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

00:56:13.205 --> 00:56:16.428
I have never got into a fury or a temper

00:56:16.588 --> 00:56:18.771
because I think I can manage without it.

00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:22.795
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

00:56:22.955 --> 00:56:27.873
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

00:56:28.033 --> 00:56:32.459
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

00:56:32.619 --> 00:56:35.381
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

00:56:35.541 --> 00:56:38.724
it is such an energy-giving thing,

00:56:38.884 --> 00:56:48.384
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

00:56:49.837 --> 00:56:52.412
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

00:56:52.572 --> 00:56:58.662
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

00:56:58.822 --> 00:57:03.443
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

00:57:03.603 --> 00:57:07.529
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

00:57:07.689 --> 00:57:09.556
that you can’t leave.

00:57:10.213 --> 00:57:15.803
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

00:57:15.963 --> 00:57:17.986
they don’t know how the child is lost.

00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:24.421
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

00:57:24.581 --> 00:57:29.857
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

00:57:30.017 --> 00:57:32.709
But when they are young, they are innocent

00:57:32.869 --> 00:57:37.357
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

00:57:37.517 --> 00:57:42.896
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

00:57:43.056 --> 00:57:47.076
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

00:57:47.236 --> 00:57:53.716
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

00:57:53.876 --> 00:57:58.294
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

00:57:58.454 --> 00:58:02.123
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

00:58:02.283 --> 00:58:08.248
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

00:58:08.408 --> 00:58:11.443
that your children are looked after.

00:58:11.603 --> 00:58:14.818
But you are also a child of your Mother.

00:58:14.978 --> 00:58:19.334
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

00:58:19.494 --> 00:58:25.724
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

00:58:25.884 --> 00:58:29.326
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

00:58:29.486 --> 00:58:34.287
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

00:58:34.447 --> 00:58:36.310
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:39.826
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

00:58:39.986 --> 00:58:41.841
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:42.002 --> 00:58:45.485
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

00:58:45.646 --> 00:58:54.048
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:58.959
Today is to celebrate His birth

00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:04.545
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

00:59:04.705 --> 00:59:10.572
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

00:59:11.228 --> 00:59:16.006
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

00:59:16.166 --> 00:59:22.635
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

00:59:23.283 --> 00:59:26.549
And that’s why He was first created.

00:59:27.299 --> 00:59:32.412
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

00:59:32.572 --> 00:59:35.963
so that He can look after all the people

00:59:36.377 --> 00:59:44.002
who are going to come from ages to ages,

00:59:44.424 --> 00:59:48.987
to guide them always on the right path.

00:59:49.173 --> 00:59:53.928
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

00:59:54.088 --> 00:59:58.256
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

00:59:58.416 --> 01:00:00.967
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

01:00:01.127 --> 01:00:03.076
That I should have not done.”

01:00:03.236 --> 01:00:08.568
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

01:00:08.728 --> 01:00:11.912
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

01:00:12.072 --> 01:00:15.404
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

01:00:15.564 --> 01:00:19.334
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

01:00:19.494 --> 01:00:23.193
“Why did you give up your land?”

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:27.404
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

01:00:27.564 --> 01:00:31.886
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:36.069
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

01:00:36.229 --> 01:00:38.146
So I thought it’s better to give up.

01:00:38.306 --> 01:00:40.717
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

01:00:40.877 --> 01:00:45.072
And he so innocently was telling me that,

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:51.279
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:54.381
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:58.779
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

01:00:58.939 --> 01:01:00.785
But I said, “What about your brother?”

01:01:00.946 --> 01:01:04.431
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

01:01:04.591 --> 01:01:07.521
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:11.904
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

01:01:12.064 --> 01:01:15.060
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.889
Later on I might become a bad man.”

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:21.700
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.412
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

01:01:24.572 --> 01:01:29.130
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:33.639
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

01:01:33.799 --> 01:01:35.217
I don’t know what to do.

01:01:35.377 --> 01:01:38.553
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

01:01:38.713 --> 01:01:44.526
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:47.990
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:52.154
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

01:01:52.314 --> 01:01:56.459
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

01:01:56.619 --> 01:02:02.474
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

01:02:02.634 --> 01:02:06.170
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:10.537
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

01:02:10.697 --> 01:02:13.381
So he can save me from the smoking.”

01:02:13.541 --> 01:02:17.904
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

01:02:18.064 --> 01:02:20.779
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:24.334
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:28.990
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:33.615
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

01:02:33.775 --> 01:02:38.232
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

01:02:38.392 --> 01:02:42.489
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

01:02:42.649 --> 01:02:47.877
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

01:02:48.439 --> 01:02:53.420
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.209
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

01:02:58.369 --> 01:03:03.842
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

01:03:04.002 --> 01:03:09.560
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.381
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:16.529
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

01:03:16.689 --> 01:03:21.045
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

01:03:21.205 --> 01:03:25.506
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

01:03:25.666 --> 01:03:28.490
For example, I have never seen such honest people

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:32.310
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:36.092
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

01:03:36.252 --> 01:03:39.123
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:42.045
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

01:03:42.205 --> 01:03:45.795
but most of you have become so honest.

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:48.654
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

01:03:48.814 --> 01:03:52.666
and to see people who are so honest.

01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:56.612
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

01:03:56.772 --> 01:04:01.490
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:07.447
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

01:04:07.657 --> 01:04:13.271
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

01:04:13.431 --> 01:04:17.837
how you people are so much fond of me.

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:29.420
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:32.623
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

01:04:32.783 --> 01:04:36.154
and that is Shri Ganesha’s, again, the quality.

01:04:36.314 --> 01:04:38.310
Because He’s so attached to me

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:42.217
that he will fight his Father, he will fight everybody.

01:04:42.377 --> 01:04:44.139
That’s what you are.

01:04:44.299 --> 01:04:46.482
Anything against me, you cannot tolerate,

01:04:46.642 --> 01:04:50.498
anything wrong said against me you cannot follow.

01:04:50.658 --> 01:04:55.349
I have seen people getting furious if somebody said a word against me.

01:04:55.509 --> 01:05:02.115
So this quality of love for me is coming from Shri Ganesha within you.

01:05:02.275 --> 01:05:05.224
But the another quality, as I said, is that

01:05:05.384 --> 01:05:10.146
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:15.873
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

01:05:16.033 --> 01:05:22.670
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:30.224
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

01:05:30.384 --> 01:05:33.699
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

01:05:33.859 --> 01:05:37.389
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:42.803
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

01:05:42.963 --> 01:05:47.998
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

01:05:48.158 --> 01:05:50.404
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

01:05:50.564 --> 01:05:54.295
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

01:05:54.455 --> 01:06:00.193
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

01:06:00.353 --> 01:06:04.240
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.521
Nobody makes a mistake.”

01:06:06.681 --> 01:06:10.084
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

01:06:10.244 --> 01:06:14.576
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

01:06:14.736 --> 01:06:18.736
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

01:06:18.897 --> 01:06:23.014
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

01:06:23.174 --> 01:06:28.170
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:32.209
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

01:06:32.369 --> 01:06:36.795
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:44.498
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

01:06:44.658 --> 01:06:55.986
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

01:06:56.752 --> 01:07:01.224
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:06.084
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

01:07:06.244 --> 01:07:09.795
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

01:07:09.955 --> 01:07:12.380
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:15.849
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

01:07:16.009 --> 01:07:22.756
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

01:07:22.916 --> 01:07:28.662
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

01:07:28.822 --> 01:07:36.303
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

01:07:36.463 --> 01:07:41.209
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

01:07:41.369 --> 01:07:48.943
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

01:07:49.103 --> 01:07:55.654
with such speed and with such lightness:

01:07:55.814 --> 01:07:58.240
they were lifting their legs and hand.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.775
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

01:08:04.884 --> 01:08:09.982
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

01:08:10.142 --> 01:08:14.060
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.974
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

01:08:18.134 --> 01:08:20.849
They earn their living, they are farmers,

01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:25.959
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

01:08:26.119 --> 01:08:29.912
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:38.271
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

01:08:38.431 --> 01:08:41.553
or another bad things that people think

01:08:41.713 --> 01:08:45.157
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

01:08:45.317 --> 01:08:48.403
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

01:08:48.563 --> 01:08:54.146
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

01:08:54.306 --> 01:08:56.287
in a very beautiful manner.

01:08:56.447 --> 01:09:02.334
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

01:09:02.494 --> 01:09:05.678
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

01:09:05.838 --> 01:09:11.678
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

01:09:11.838 --> 01:09:17.982
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

01:09:18.142 --> 01:09:23.334
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

01:09:23.494 --> 01:09:26.068
and think of violence and killing people?

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:28.865
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

01:09:29.025 --> 01:09:32.873
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:37.889
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:44.381
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:48.615
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

01:09:48.775 --> 01:09:54.529
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

01:09:54.689 --> 01:09:56.810
There is no need for us to fight.

01:09:56.970 --> 01:10:01.365
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

01:10:01.525 --> 01:10:05.146
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

01:10:05.306 --> 01:10:08.326
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

01:10:08.486 --> 01:10:11.037
He’ll either become a transformed person

01:10:11.197 --> 01:10:15.213
or he will not be there to trouble you.

01:10:16.048 --> 01:10:21.170
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:23.572
and our powers.

01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:29.373
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

01:10:29.533 --> 01:10:34.556
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:39.451
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:43.111
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

01:10:43.384 --> 01:10:44.899
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.262
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

01:10:48.423 --> 01:10:50.482
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

01:10:50.642 --> 01:10:53.490
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:58.881
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:04.810
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.318
You can do it, everything. You can.

01:11:07.478 --> 01:11:11.709
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

01:11:11.869 --> 01:11:16.553
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

01:11:16.713 --> 01:11:18.904
you are not going to spoil anybody,

01:11:19.064 --> 01:11:23.935
but your power itself will show that this power

01:11:24.095 --> 01:11:32.490
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:35.685
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

01:11:35.845 --> 01:11:41.611
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

01:11:41.813 --> 01:11:47.201
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

01:11:47.361 --> 01:11:54.861
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

01:11:55.642 --> 01:12:01.318
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

01:12:01.478 --> 01:12:05.349
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

01:12:05.509 --> 01:12:08.584
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

01:12:08.744 --> 01:12:12.639
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

01:12:12.799 --> 01:12:16.412
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

01:12:16.572 --> 01:12:19.474
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

01:12:19.634 --> 01:12:22.180
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

01:12:22.341 --> 01:12:25.513
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:28.764
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

01:12:28.924 --> 01:12:32.490
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:34.693
and they are sitting there and fighting,

01:12:34.853 --> 01:12:38.529
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:42.833
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

01:12:42.993 --> 01:12:46.006
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

01:12:46.166 --> 01:12:47.740
So there were four tiers.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:51.740
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.099
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

01:12:54.259 --> 01:12:59.204
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

01:12:59.689 --> 01:13:03.709
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

01:13:03.869 --> 01:13:11.697
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

01:13:12.563 --> 01:13:18.467
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:23.900
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

01:13:24.704 --> 01:13:27.178
He’s the one who worked it out.

01:13:27.338 --> 01:13:28.740
That’s why they say always,

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.654
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:35.615
because then it gives you that peace,

01:13:35.775 --> 01:13:41.326
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

01:13:41.486 --> 01:13:44.619
that you never thought it would.

01:13:47.634 --> 01:13:52.232
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

01:13:52.392 --> 01:13:57.154
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

01:13:57.314 --> 01:14:00.318
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:02.693
We are still hoping to get the land

01:14:02.853 --> 01:14:06.100
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.834
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

01:14:08.994 --> 01:14:13.115
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

01:14:13.275 --> 01:14:17.216
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

01:14:17.376 --> 01:14:23.361
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

01:14:24.228 --> 01:14:27.935
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

01:14:28.095 --> 01:14:31.295
But all that has worked out so well and now

01:14:31.455 --> 01:14:35.170
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:37.409
May God Bless you.
