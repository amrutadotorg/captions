WEBVTT

00:05.630 --> 00:15.710
Today we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:16.790 --> 00:24.830
I think this is the most important puja

00:26.710 --> 00:34.030
because it is the power of Adi Shakti

00:34.190 --> 00:38.110
that has given you Self Realisation,

00:38.590 --> 00:41.990
that has given you the Truth,

00:42.270 --> 00:48.110
that has given you the power of compassion and love.

00:59.430 --> 01:10.190
That's the power that separated from Sadashiva

01:12.470 --> 01:30.430
and this power wanted Herself to create this complete universe.

01:30.910 --> 01:40.870
Universes after universes, She's creating and loving.

01:41.030 --> 01:49.310
With Her love, She did this great creation,

01:49.470 --> 01:54.830
creation of this world also.

01:55.110 --> 02:01.430
This is a specially selected planet,

02:01.590 --> 02:08.190
which was very beautifully brought in the centre

02:08.350 --> 02:11.790
between the sun and the moon

02:13.310 --> 02:21.150
for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.

02:23.110 --> 02:34.470
This is Her great work with such love and affection

02:35.110 --> 02:38.430
and with very great hope

02:39.910 --> 02:47.630
that Her children will know the truth

02:48.110 --> 02:52.470
and will get the ultimate knowledge about themselves

02:52.630 --> 02:56.750
and about everything else.

03:03.190 --> 03:07.270
As you have read in the Bible

03:07.430 --> 03:14.070
about how Adi Shakti came in the form of a snake

03:14.230 --> 03:17.430
and told human beings

03:17.590 --> 03:26.510
that you have to know the knowledge,

03:26.670 --> 03:32.870
Adam and Eve, and to Eve specially,

03:33.033 --> 03:39.710
and they accepted to eat the fruit of knowledge

03:42.820 --> 03:47.700
because they would have remained just like animals,

03:47.860 --> 03:51.660
without knowing anything subtleties of life —

03:51.820 --> 03:55.420
little higher animals maybe  —

03:57.140 --> 04:03.940
that once they ate the fruit they started feeling

04:04.620 --> 04:07.860
that there is something wrong the

04:08.020 --> 04:11.980
way they are without any clothes,

04:12.500 --> 04:17.500
so they brought some leaves of the tree

04:17.660 --> 04:21.100
and covered themselves.

04:21.620 --> 04:28.500
So the first knowledge came was of chastity

04:29.380 --> 04:34.860
because Shri Ganesha was established

04:35.060 --> 04:43.020
and His influence brought forth this consciousness

04:43.180 --> 04:46.100
that we have to cover our bodies.

04:46.260 --> 04:49.660
We are no more animals.

04:49.820 --> 04:53.780
Only the animals

04:53.940 --> 04:56.620
— of course, they're not standing, so it is all right —

04:56.780 --> 04:59.780
are not aware of it.

05:03.420 --> 05:08.740
With the knowledge of chastity,

05:08.900 --> 05:13.060
gradually human beings started growing

05:13.540 --> 05:17.780
into beautiful nations,

05:19.460 --> 05:26.060
but there are so many things,  which were still to be known,

05:27.580 --> 05:30.460
to be aware of it.

05:31.460 --> 05:39.140
You may be aware of many things,

05:42.660 --> 05:52.580
but unless and until you get your spiritual awakening,

05:53.620 --> 05:58.220
unless and until you get your self knowledge,

05:58.380 --> 06:04.700
all other knowledge is absolutely nothing.

06:08.820 --> 06:14.420
With this self knowledge only, you become powerful.

06:14.580 --> 06:22.140
The real power — the real power is of love and compassion.

06:25.300 --> 06:33.620
Today when you see the whole world is busy fighting

06:33.780 --> 06:39.460
and they are trying to protect people

06:39.620 --> 06:44.380
from wars and creating

06:44.540 --> 06:53.020
great, huge, protecting instruments.

06:54.300 --> 06:59.260
The whole world seems to be in a mad race

06:59.420 --> 07:05.340
of killing each other, of destroying each other,

07:05.500 --> 07:14.460
of competition, ambition,

07:14.620 --> 07:19.980
leading to fighting and then to greater wars.

07:20.260 --> 07:25.820
They're fighting for a piece of land.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.140
So ignorant they are.

07:30.300 --> 07:38.980
Can you carry even a pinch of this land with you

07:39.140 --> 07:41.780
when you die?

07:44.060 --> 07:48.020
When you are born you come with closed fists.

07:48.180 --> 07:53.220
When you die you go with open hands.

07:53.780 --> 07:57.380
What do you take with you?

07:57.540 --> 08:02.340
All right, you may not like to take anything,

08:02.500 --> 08:06.740
but do you enjoy whatever you think is so great

08:06.900 --> 08:10.180
for which you are fighting?

08:10.900 --> 08:17.740
Why this fighting going on among all nonsensical people?

08:18.580 --> 08:27.900
It's surprising how people give up their peace,

08:28.060 --> 08:31.140
give up their understanding

08:31.300 --> 08:36.900
when it comes to a piece of land.

08:40.500 --> 08:46.740
And the whole thing has moved into a very wrong direction

08:46.900 --> 08:53.180
and going towards complete destruction.

08:54.180 --> 09:04.100
The thing that has made human beings so much suffering

09:04.260 --> 09:12.220
because of all their ignorance,

09:12.380 --> 09:18.660
by which they have all those habits,

09:18.820 --> 09:22.500
all those attractions,

09:22.660 --> 09:29.260
all those identification, which is ruinous,

09:29.420 --> 09:36.980
which will ruin all of them, each one by one.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.580
They have to take to sense

09:41.740 --> 09:49.020
and they have to take to their self knowledge.

09:49.180 --> 09:57.660
Self knowledge is the key

09:58.660 --> 10:05.940
for a saviour to give to people.

10:07.820 --> 10:11.620
We have had so many saints.

10:11.780 --> 10:15.900
We have had so many Sufis.

10:16.060 --> 10:20.620
We had Tao people. We had Zen people.

10:20.780 --> 10:26.860
All kinds of realised souls came on this Earth.

10:27.860 --> 10:33.820
They all suffered. They were tortured. Nobody understood them.

10:35.260 --> 10:42.820
But now the time has come for you to know the truth,

10:43.300 --> 10:49.860
but truth which is not dry, truth which has compassion,

10:50.020 --> 10:54.020
truth that encompasses everyone,

10:54.180 --> 11:02.380
that brings the complete view of our existence.

11:02.540 --> 11:09.020
Why are we here on this Earth? What is our purpose?

11:09.180 --> 11:12.140
What should we do? Adi Shakti's

11:13.380 --> 11:17.540
powers are such

11:17.700 --> 11:21.300
of love and compassion,

11:21.460 --> 11:26.660
that makes you understand your self first.

11:27.820 --> 11:34.100
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

11:34.660 --> 11:41.780
There's no awareness of your own being.

11:41.940 --> 11:46.900
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

11:47.460 --> 11:53.060
how much you have to be seriously

11:53.220 --> 11:57.900
becoming aware of your self first.

11:58.940 --> 12:02.700
That is extremely important.

12:03.380 --> 12:07.980
First you have to be aware of your self.

12:10.140 --> 12:14.340
And now you have the light of your spirit.

12:14.500 --> 12:19.260
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

12:19.580 --> 12:23.060
and you can see how far you are going,

12:23.220 --> 12:26.860
how wrong things you are doing,

12:27.020 --> 12:31.380
what harm you are doing to yourself

12:32.260 --> 12:35.900
and you have a power to cure it,

12:36.060 --> 12:41.260
to improve it and to come to your senses.

12:41.420 --> 12:45.820
These are the most important times.

12:45.980 --> 12:49.140
You will never get these times again.

12:49.300 --> 12:56.100
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

12:57.060 --> 13:04.020
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

13:04.180 --> 13:08.260
not only the self knowledge,

13:08.420 --> 13:12.460
but you know how to do it.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.980
Otherwise, about the saints,

13:16.140 --> 13:20.660
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

13:20.820 --> 13:23.500
they have just described

13:23.660 --> 13:30.420
what a person with self knowledge is,

13:30.580 --> 13:35.620
how he behaves, how his style is,

13:35.780 --> 13:38.780
how he's so different from others.

13:38.940 --> 13:43.980
But none of them have said how you become that.

13:44.980 --> 13:48.620
No one has been able to say that.

13:48.780 --> 13:52.780
Nobody has been able to do that also

13:52.940 --> 14:01.380
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

14:01.620 --> 14:08.740
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

14:09.580 --> 14:14.980
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

14:15.140 --> 14:24.420
to put the kundalini  in your sacrum bone.

14:26.540 --> 14:32.940
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.660
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

14:36.820 --> 14:42.140
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

14:42.340 --> 14:45.580
much stronger, much more powerful.

14:45.740 --> 14:53.420
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

14:54.580 --> 15:00.860
and when She rises you know what happens to you

15:01.300 --> 15:07.100
and how you get your Realisation.

15:08.300 --> 15:12.060
But you have to be very watchful.

15:12.300 --> 15:17.060
Are you really a compassionate person?

15:18.780 --> 15:21.620
If you are compassionate,

15:21.780 --> 15:25.300
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

15:25.460 --> 15:32.180
I think, will be to help others,

15:32.340 --> 15:35.100
to emancipate others.

15:35.260 --> 15:41.580
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

15:41.740 --> 15:50.780
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

15:50.940 --> 15:53.380
It cannot happen.

15:53.820 --> 15:59.860
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

16:00.020 --> 16:01.700
to work so hard?

16:01.860 --> 16:06.860
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

16:07.020 --> 16:10.500
but, from my very childhood

16:11.140 --> 16:14.060
I've worked very hard

16:14.220 --> 16:19.500
and I've gone through very difficult times,

16:19.660 --> 16:26.540
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

16:26.700 --> 16:32.700
but the worst time I have, when I see

16:32.860 --> 16:37.100
those people whom I have given Realisation,

16:37.260 --> 16:41.220
those who are self-realised people,

16:41.380 --> 16:49.020
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

16:49.180 --> 16:53.060
and, if they have, it is very little.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.380
They don't have that compassion

16:56.540 --> 16:59.420
and don't have that love

16:59.580 --> 17:03.260
that we have to today save the world,

17:03.420 --> 17:05.660
save the humanity.

17:05.820 --> 17:12.060
That's our — not only our principal work,

17:12.220 --> 17:17.060
but the only work that we have to do.

17:17.220 --> 17:22.580
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

17:22.740 --> 17:28.500
except for your own efforts here,

17:28.660 --> 17:31.340
individual efforts

17:31.500 --> 17:34.820
to give Self Realisation to others

17:34.980 --> 17:38.820
and give them this knowledge.

17:38.980 --> 17:44.860
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

17:45.020 --> 17:48.500
It is very subtle, no doubt,

17:48.660 --> 17:51.420
and, as I've told you,

17:51.580 --> 17:57.780
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

17:57.940 --> 18:03.860
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

18:04.020 --> 18:09.140
and they are trying to find out something about it.

18:09.300 --> 18:16.340
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

18:16.500 --> 18:23.620
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

18:23.780 --> 18:26.860
that has happened to you.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.580
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

18:29.740 --> 18:32.300
even if you have starved yourself,

18:32.460 --> 18:38.780
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

18:38.940 --> 18:45.660
even   you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

18:45.820 --> 18:48.620
you could not have got your Realisation.

18:48.780 --> 18:51.220
That would not have been possible.

18:51.380 --> 18:57.860
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

18:58.020 --> 19:03.620
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

19:03.780 --> 19:09.180
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

19:09.340 --> 19:16.180
Just to see that you all are created

19:16.340 --> 19:19.460
and you're all My hands.

19:19.620 --> 19:25.420
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

19:25.580 --> 19:28.420
And that is what I have been telling you,

19:28.580 --> 19:35.940
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

19:36.100 --> 19:43.100
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

19:43.340 --> 19:49.060
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

19:50.660 --> 19:55.340
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.220
Try to understand this.

19:58.380 --> 20:02.180
It's not work of any saint.

20:02.340 --> 20:06.940
It's not work of any incarnation.

20:07.100 --> 20:10.980
It's not work of any politician.

20:11.140 --> 20:17.420
And not work of any big leader.

20:17.580 --> 20:21.620
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

20:21.820 --> 20:28.980
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

20:29.140 --> 20:35.020
Now it is for you to see.

20:36.500 --> 20:43.420
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

20:43.580 --> 20:53.100
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

20:53.260 --> 20:57.180
The greatest thing you can do for Me

20:57.340 --> 21:01.620
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

21:02.180 --> 21:09.860
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

21:12.620 --> 21:16.060
You didn't have to do any efforts.

21:16.220 --> 21:20.300
You didn't have to pay any money.

21:21.100 --> 21:29.220
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

21:29.380 --> 21:33.420
You got it spontaneously.

21:34.380 --> 21:39.980
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

21:40.140 --> 21:44.180
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

21:46.700 --> 21:56.420
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

21:58.180 --> 22:06.460
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

22:07.220 --> 22:10.540
People have tried to spread their religion

22:10.700 --> 22:14.380
by showing compassion to poor people,

22:14.540 --> 22:19.500
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

22:20.580 --> 22:27.100
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

22:28.220 --> 22:33.420
What they have to do is to transform other people.

22:33.700 --> 22:38.860
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

22:39.180 --> 22:43.820
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

22:44.180 --> 22:46.460
Put your mind to it

22:46.620 --> 22:51.140
and you will know how you can manage it.

22:54.620 --> 23:01.700
There should be all the time compelling desire

23:01.860 --> 23:04.700
that we have to find out method

23:04.860 --> 23:08.660
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

23:09.580 --> 23:15.860
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

23:16.020 --> 23:22.980
that some seed fell on the marshy land

23:23.540 --> 23:29.460
and they sprouted, but never grew.

23:29.780 --> 23:36.900
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

23:37.540 --> 23:43.820
and become something very, very special and real

23:44.780 --> 23:50.780
by knowing what you can do.

23:52.020 --> 23:55.020
I have a vision, no doubt,

23:55.180 --> 23:59.380
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

23:59.660 --> 24:06.020
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

24:06.820 --> 24:11.060
I know some countries are very difficult.

24:11.220 --> 24:15.300
Try to find out what is the problem,

24:15.460 --> 24:20.420
why it is so very difficult.

24:21.420 --> 24:26.660
Attention has to be paid to this,

24:26.820 --> 24:34.420
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

24:35.860 --> 24:39.100
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

24:39.260 --> 24:44.020
which we call as the last judgement,

24:44.180 --> 24:47.860
but let us, through our compassion and love,

24:48.020 --> 24:50.980
save as many as possible.

24:52.500 --> 24:56.500
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

24:57.060 --> 25:01.900
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

25:02.060 --> 25:04.660
They're all there, no doubt.

25:04.820 --> 25:09.740
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

25:09.900 --> 25:14.500
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

25:14.900 --> 25:18.340
which is very great,

25:18.500 --> 25:22.300
which is very penetrating,

25:22.460 --> 25:25.500
which is miraculous.

25:25.660 --> 25:28.940
It's so effective,

25:29.100 --> 25:35.060
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

25:35.220 --> 25:38.220
how will you work it out.

25:38.380 --> 25:43.780
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

25:43.940 --> 25:48.140
but nobody is there to work it out.

25:48.340 --> 25:55.180
All the time I had to go through very,

25:55.340 --> 25:58.260
very hazardous times

25:58.420 --> 26:05.180
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

26:05.340 --> 26:09.260
the way things are so difficult for Me.

26:09.420 --> 26:15.900
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

26:16.820 --> 26:22.020
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

26:22.180 --> 26:24.620
but those who walk on that,

26:24.780 --> 26:29.940
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

26:30.100 --> 26:36.380
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

26:36.540 --> 26:39.540
'Let many walk on this road,

26:39.700 --> 26:42.220
which was created with such

26:42.380 --> 26:46.500
patience, understanding and love.'

26:46.660 --> 26:53.260
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

26:53.420 --> 26:58.900
doing your level best to change this world

26:59.060 --> 27:01.060
— has to be changed.

27:01.220 --> 27:04.980
As it is, humanity has to be saved

27:05.140 --> 27:08.860
through you and nobody else.

27:09.580 --> 27:13.620
No president, no prime minister,

27:13.780 --> 27:16.060
no minister,

27:16.220 --> 27:20.020
none of these people can change the world

27:20.180 --> 27:21.940
and save it.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.020
It is you who are entitled.

27:25.180 --> 27:27.620
You have got this power.

27:27.820 --> 27:34.580
Do you realise your own status?

27:34.740 --> 27:39.380
Your own being?

27:39.540 --> 27:43.100
which has risen so high?

27:43.260 --> 27:49.140
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

27:49.300 --> 27:53.140
you would go all out

27:53.700 --> 28:00.260
to express your love and compassion to other people,

28:00.420 --> 28:05.660
to make them realise what they are.

28:05.820 --> 28:08.900
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.340
There's no other way out.

28:11.500 --> 28:18.220
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

28:18.380 --> 28:22.820
is something very, very superficial.

28:23.500 --> 28:31.100
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

28:32.740 --> 28:36.660
We have seen children. They're coming up.

28:36.820 --> 28:41.500
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

28:41.660 --> 28:47.740
But before them, you have to show your own merits

28:47.900 --> 28:50.780
of what you have done.

28:50.940 --> 28:53.860
It's not a static work.

28:54.020 --> 29:00.420
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

29:00.580 --> 29:09.940
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

29:14.340 --> 29:22.940
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

29:24.860 --> 29:30.300
You are the one[s] who have to build up

29:30.460 --> 29:34.060
the destiny of human beings.

29:34.220 --> 29:38.940
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.580
You could never have got your Realisation.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.820
You'd never have come to Me.

29:43.980 --> 29:48.300
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

29:48.460 --> 29:52.580
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

29:52.740 --> 29:55.660
You know it cannot be forced.

29:55.820 --> 29:59.460
This Realisation cannot be forced.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.780
This awareness cannot be forced.

30:02.940 --> 30:09.980
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

30:10.140 --> 30:16.540
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

30:16.700 --> 30:21.140
And see for yourself what you have done,

30:21.300 --> 30:23.460
what you have done.

30:23.620 --> 30:29.860
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

30:30.020 --> 30:34.420
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.980
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

30:37.140 --> 30:41.180
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

30:41.340 --> 30:44.940
and is very powerful.

30:45.100 --> 30:49.660
Power will be achieved by them

30:49.820 --> 30:52.500
— power of love and compassion,

30:52.660 --> 30:56.900
which is not only words of love.

30:57.060 --> 31:02.660
It is not only act of loving others,

31:03.300 --> 31:12.020
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

31:12.180 --> 31:15.620
which will just emit

31:15.780 --> 31:26.100
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

31:26.860 --> 31:37.740
All should just take a very brave personality.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.820
I must say people have improved,

31:41.980 --> 31:45.100
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

31:45.260 --> 31:49.420
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

31:49.580 --> 31:53.980
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

31:54.140 --> 31:59.780
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

32:00.500 --> 32:07.620
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

32:07.780 --> 32:11.140
people who have failed,

32:11.300 --> 32:19.100
people who are still in a state

32:19.740 --> 32:26.380
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

32:26.540 --> 32:32.660
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

32:32.980 --> 32:36.900
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

32:37.060 --> 32:40.500
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

32:40.660 --> 32:46.580
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

32:48.940 --> 32:55.220
Why? Is that My job?

32:55.380 --> 32:59.580
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

32:59.740 --> 33:03.020
can be cured by photographs,

33:03.180 --> 33:08.340
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

33:08.500 --> 33:13.900
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

33:14.060 --> 33:18.660
mentally, emotionally, financially,

33:18.860 --> 33:21.740
also in the marriages,

33:24.740 --> 33:27.740
that's not your job,

33:27.900 --> 33:30.700
neither Mine.

33:30.860 --> 33:35.020
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

33:35.180 --> 33:39.620
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

33:42.220 --> 33:49.460
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

33:49.620 --> 33:52.500
if it fails, to write to Me

33:52.660 --> 33:56.100
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

33:56.260 --> 33:59.140
What's so important?

33:59.940 --> 34:05.980
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.340
Why not use them first?

34:08.500 --> 34:12.660
Our job is not to cure people.

34:12.860 --> 34:17.700
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

34:17.860 --> 34:24.580
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

34:24.740 --> 34:29.220
or to the people who are suffering,

34:29.380 --> 34:34.660
but what about Sahaj Yog?

34:38.020 --> 34:41.300
If you have one sick person,

34:41.460 --> 34:45.580
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

34:45.740 --> 34:48.980
What is the reason?

34:49.140 --> 34:53.060
Is it compassion?

34:53.220 --> 34:55.420
It's not.

34:57.140 --> 35:03.700
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

35:04.660 --> 35:07.580
Is not compassion.

35:07.740 --> 35:11.020
Compassion today is

35:11.180 --> 35:17.540
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

35:17.940 --> 35:21.340
into good people.

35:21.500 --> 35:25.580
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

35:26.060 --> 35:29.820
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

35:29.980 --> 35:34.140
We should not be unkind, of course, but

35:34.300 --> 35:40.620
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

35:41.060 --> 35:44.020
Is a very common thing

35:44.180 --> 35:49.780
that people indulge more into so-called curing

35:49.940 --> 35:55.500
and improving and this. It's all right.

35:55.860 --> 36:01.060
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

36:01.220 --> 36:04.500
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

36:04.660 --> 36:08.100
It's all right. Finish them.

36:09.060 --> 36:13.220
If they don't want to live together, let them.

36:13.940 --> 36:17.660
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

36:17.820 --> 36:21.620
many people who are healthy in this world.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.140
Now how can you go on struggling with people

36:25.300 --> 36:29.180
who don't want to live together and have problems?

36:29.900 --> 36:32.460
That's not your job.

36:32.620 --> 36:35.700
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.020
You are not a social worker.

36:39.180 --> 36:40.740
Of course,

36:40.900 --> 36:46.260
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

36:47.980 --> 36:54.020
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

36:54.700 --> 36:59.460
With that, the greatest disease

36:59.620 --> 37:05.300
is of meanness, of cruelty,

37:07.820 --> 37:13.420
of torturing others, anger.

37:14.380 --> 37:18.100
All these diseases can be cured,

37:18.260 --> 37:22.300
which are internal, not external.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.020
That is today wanted.

37:25.180 --> 37:29.180
Every country's fighting and is tortured

37:29.340 --> 37:36.500
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

37:37.460 --> 37:42.780
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

37:42.940 --> 37:47.540
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

37:48.340 --> 37:53.780
that when you give Realisation to someone

37:53.940 --> 37:59.460
and he values it, and he grows into it,

37:59.660 --> 38:04.140
then you are protected.

38:04.300 --> 38:08.140
You are completely protected.

38:08.700 --> 38:12.500
Who protects you, you may say?

38:12.660 --> 38:15.580
The Adi Shakti, all right,

38:15.740 --> 38:23.380
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

38:23.540 --> 38:30.220
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

38:30.780 --> 38:42.300
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

38:42.580 --> 38:46.340
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

38:46.500 --> 38:50.180
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

38:50.340 --> 38:58.660
and if He finds something really very wrong,

38:58.860 --> 39:02.420
I cannot control it.

39:02.660 --> 39:09.180
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.980
He destroys.

39:13.140 --> 39:20.860
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

39:24.620 --> 39:28.460
Anywhere there is a calamity,

39:28.620 --> 39:35.620
we can say, like an earthquake

39:35.780 --> 39:40.300
or some sort of a hurricane,

39:40.460 --> 39:42.300
all these things come

39:42.460 --> 39:50.340
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

39:51.580 --> 39:54.940
I can't help you there,

39:55.380 --> 40:00.780
but if you really give Realisation to people,

40:02.500 --> 40:06.140
all these can be averted.

40:07.060 --> 40:13.100
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

40:13.260 --> 40:17.660
that She started this work of creating this world,

40:17.820 --> 40:22.980
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

40:23.180 --> 40:27.500
but your responsibility is also very important.

40:30.700 --> 40:34.380
You cannot be responsible.

40:37.220 --> 40:47.100
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

40:48.860 --> 40:53.300
I never felt it was My responsibility,

40:54.380 --> 40:58.260
never felt this was My job,

40:58.420 --> 41:01.500
never felt I have to do it.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.140
'I did it.'

41:07.500 --> 41:09.460
That is the work.

41:09.620 --> 41:13.900
That's the kind of personality you should have.

41:14.060 --> 41:19.940
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

41:22.060 --> 41:26.580
in a very beautiful manner

41:26.740 --> 41:31.900
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

41:32.060 --> 41:38.580
how you are supported and how everything works out.

41:38.860 --> 41:42.460
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

41:42.620 --> 41:45.700
you can give Realisation to people.

41:47.380 --> 41:50.940
You can change their lives.

41:51.620 --> 41:53.940
Never you would feel such joy,

41:54.100 --> 42:02.060
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

42:02.580 --> 42:06.500
a big job or a big name

42:06.660 --> 42:13.100
or a very big award, no.

42:14.060 --> 42:19.260
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

42:20.100 --> 42:24.940
knows no bounds,

42:25.540 --> 42:29.420
is such a joy-giving thing.

42:30.500 --> 42:35.500
You develop such fraternities,

42:35.660 --> 42:41.700
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

42:42.100 --> 42:46.940
such enjoyment of love,

42:47.380 --> 42:50.580
enjoyment of compassion.

42:50.740 --> 42:54.540
It's a different level of enjoyment

42:54.700 --> 42:58.780
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

43:01.100 --> 43:04.500
You're not to be afraid of Me,

43:04.660 --> 43:08.900
but be afraid of yourself.

43:09.060 --> 43:12.780
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

43:12.940 --> 43:16.500
what have you been doing so far.

43:16.660 --> 43:19.900
What have you done so far?

43:20.060 --> 43:26.380
Because you have been enlightened.

43:27.140 --> 43:30.100
If the enlightened people

43:30.260 --> 43:34.100
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

43:34.260 --> 43:37.020
Look at these little, little candles.

43:37.180 --> 43:42.940
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

43:43.100 --> 43:47.060
They're burning themselves to give that light.

43:47.220 --> 43:53.300
If we cannot give that light,

43:54.580 --> 43:58.860
what is the use of enlightenment?

44:00.020 --> 44:04.740
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

44:04.900 --> 44:09.780
the light of love, compassion,

44:09.940 --> 44:16.660
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

44:16.820 --> 44:19.580
as you see in the films.

44:19.740 --> 44:25.100
It is a divine love which works

44:26.300 --> 44:31.340
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

44:31.500 --> 44:34.900
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

44:35.060 --> 44:39.620
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

44:39.780 --> 44:44.340
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

44:44.500 --> 44:48.260
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

44:48.420 --> 44:52.380
After getting the highest,

44:52.540 --> 44:58.380
why do you want to go so low as that?

44:58.540 --> 45:04.220
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

45:05.780 --> 45:10.020
You have not realised what you have got.

45:12.220 --> 45:15.900
And you don't respect yourself.

45:16.300 --> 45:23.260
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

45:23.420 --> 45:34.140
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

45:34.660 --> 45:38.220
We have to work it out.

45:38.380 --> 45:41.860
Single-handed, I've done it,

45:42.020 --> 45:45.620
worked very hard, I must say,

45:45.780 --> 45:52.940
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

45:54.460 --> 46:01.660
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

46:02.420 --> 46:05.380
That doesn't matter.

46:07.780 --> 46:11.820
And such beautiful pearls I have discovered.

46:12.460 --> 46:17.140
But you must keep your lustre

46:17.300 --> 46:20.180
and work it out.

46:20.340 --> 46:27.220
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

46:27.380 --> 46:32.020
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

46:32.180 --> 46:35.900
and that people are really

46:36.060 --> 46:43.980
getting into that realm

46:44.500 --> 46:51.420
of peace, joy and happiness.

46:51.580 --> 46:54.380
That's My dream

46:54.540 --> 46:58.500
and I hope you all will all work it out.

46:58.940 --> 47:01.620
Thank you very much.
