1
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,100
Today, we are celebrating the birth of Jesus 
Christ.

2
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:50,240
The birth of Jesus Christ is very symbolic, 
because

3
00:01:50,240 --> 00:02:01,060
he was born 
in such a manner that even the poorest of

4
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,490
poor won’t be born in the stable.

5
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:32,590
And he was put in the 
bed which was made of dried grass.

6
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:49,620
He came on this earth to show people that 
for a person who is an incarnation or who

7
00:02:49,620 --> 00:03:09,349
is a highly evolved soul, is not bothered 
about the comfort of the body.

8
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:32,460
His message was so great and so deep, but 
he had disciples who were not prepared for

9
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:37,159
the battle they had to fight.

10
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,230
Is the same thing that sometimes happens with 
Sahaja Yoga.

11
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:59,959
He had only 12 disciples, we too have 12 types 
of Sahaja Yogis, and all of them, though [they]

12
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:09,790
try to dedicate themselves to Christ, fell 
a trap, some of them, to the worldly aspirations

13
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:22,569
or to their own hankerings.

14
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:32,110
His message of love and forgiveness is the 
same even today.

15
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:40,689
Preached by all, all the saints, all the incarnations, 
all the prophets.

16
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:49,580
They all have said about love and forgiveness.

17
00:04:49,580 --> 00:05:19,530
If it was challenged or people felt that this 
won’t work out, they were asked to have

18
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:27,210
faith in what he said.

19
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:37,729
But they were simple people in those days 
so they obeyed him.

20
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:47,749
Some of them definitely were very good, some 
of them half-baked and few of them were people

21
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:54,960
who were doubting.

22
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:08,960
He came on this earth to prepare for us our 
Agya chakra and despite all his efforts one

23
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:18,060
finds very difficult and the people who follow 
Christianity have the worst type of Agya.

24
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,649
Worst type!

25
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:28,539
Extremely aggressive, extremely planning type, 
futuristic.

26
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:42,479
I mean all the troubles of the right side 
are found in those countries who claim to

27
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,680
be Christians.

28
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,569
Even the early Christians who were Gnostics, 
‘gne’, ‘gne’ in Sanskrit means ‘know’,

29
00:06:53,569 --> 00:07:02,389
though [they] had the knowledge, the beginners 
were also suppressed and tortured by the people

30
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:09,330
who were supposed to be in charge of Christian 
religion.

31
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:16,679
And so many Christians were massacred by the 
so-called Christian priests and Christian

32
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:24,199
churches, and still it is going on.

33
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:37,860
What you find in the west is a great influence 
of these churches on the minds of the people.

34
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,809
Otherwise they are supposed to be intellectuals, 
otherwise they are supposed to be analytical,

35
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:47,389
otherwise they are supposed to be something 
very brainy.

36
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:55,939
But when it comes to temples and churches, 
when it come to religion, when it comes to

37
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:05,929
Christianity, I think their brains are blocked, 
completely blocked, by some sort of a mesmerism.

38
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:15,479
They just can’t think that there could be 
something very wrong with these people.

39
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:25,099
When living in Italy, I found or I was shocked 
how this catholic church was working out and

40
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:33,149
what the priests were doing and all kinds 
of scandals much more than we have in our

41
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,149
country!

42
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:44,000
Money bungling and molesting women and having 
children – I mean every sort of dirty habit

43
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,329
they had.

44
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:46,829
Supposed to be priests.

45
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:54,069
They were called ‘fathers’, they were 
called ‘mothers’, they were called ‘sisters’,

46
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:56,490
they were called ‘brothers’.

47
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:05,220
And to me it was really a shock – I didn’t 
know that such things are happening in the

48
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,310
name of Christ.

49
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:17,060
What Christ tried to show through his birth: 
there is no need to have very comfortable,

50
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:25,829
great birth in a big hospital in London, no!

51
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:36,740
The simplicity of his birth should have made 
all the Christians extremely simple and not

52
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,110
at all money oriented.

53
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:45,709
For money they went all round, crushed so 
many people all over the world, when you go

54
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:57,709
to Brazil or to Chile or to Argentina, you 
do not find a single man belonging to the

55
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:04,470
aboriginal people and they’re so unkind 
to them.

56
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:11,240
Unbelievable how aggressive these people are.

57
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,410
Even in England, where theres protestants 
I find the same thing among them.

58
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:23,740
You must go on saying “thank you, thank 
you” morning till evening, otherwise you

59
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,510
are finished.

60
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,510
Racialism.

61
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,700
What was the race of Christ?

62
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,279
Was he a fair man?

63
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,279
No!

64
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,279
Was he a white person?

65
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,670
Not at all!

66
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,850
What was His colour?

67
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,759
He was brown like Indians.

68
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:48,889
From where does this racialism come to these 
Westerners?

69
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,550
I just don’t understand.

70
00:10:51,550 --> 00:11:00,529
It has nothing to do with Christ or if it 
is real Christianity.

71
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:09,170
You go anywhere, you’ll be surprised, how 
the faithful, simple-hearted people are misused

72
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,329
by these churches.

73
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:22,860
They’re used for voting, they’re used 
for money, for everything – to such an extent

74
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:36,350
that money was made, artificially counterfeited 
in billions, by the church itself.

75
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:49,480
Such autocracy, such control, such authority 
they had that whatever they did was, the pope

76
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,950
is infallible, whatever he does is alright.

77
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:04,779
No idea of sinning, no idea of hell, no idea 
of Christ – which was nothing but purity

78
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:08,920
and innocence.

79
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:17,870
Christ had taken a hunter and hit all the 
people who were selling in front of the temple,

80
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,970
because God cannot be sold.

81
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,930
They were not selling God, they were selling 
only goods, but he said the respect of the

82
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:30,720
temple, talked about the respect of the temple.

83
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:37,560
Another great thing Christians have done, 
is to blame Jews for killing Christ.

84
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Wonderful!

85
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:48,639
Put all the blame on others, this is the speciality 
of Christians even today, is to put the blame

86
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,890
of what wrong you are doing on others, very 
common.

87
00:12:51,890 --> 00:13:01,949
And this is what you see very clearly in those 
countries, who call themselves Christians.

88
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,379
They blamed Jews.

89
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:10,190
First of all, those who were Jews at that 
time might have been Indians later on.

90
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,170
Alright, so they don’t believe in reincarnation.

91
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:19,829
I mean to say the same Jews who were there 
are born again.

92
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:33,470
Thirdly that the Jews never killed Christ, 
never, because in the multitude how can you

93
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,470
decide?

94
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:42,579
Is the judge who decided and ordered, he was 
a Roman.

95
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:50,180
So the Roman empire didn’t want to take 
the responsibility of His death so they said

96
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,070
Jews have killed Him.

97
00:13:53,070 --> 00:14:02,490
So Mr Hitler got after them and he really 
tortured them, really it’s too much, one

98
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:12,740
can’t even understand how can – he believed 
in catholic religion, how could he kill small

99
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,459
little children, in the gas chamber?

100
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:29,069
But now the same people who were tortured 
are also becoming very aggressive and now

101
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:36,399
they are against the Palestinians and the 
Palestinians on their own are Muslims and

102
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,370
the Muslims are playing a havoc all over.

103
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:55,270
So when you go through the history, and see 
the life of Christ, what do you find is aggressiveness

104
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:02,310
from one to another, from that to another, 
passing from one to another.

105
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:12,199
If somebody slaps somebody, the another person 
will try to kill that person.

106
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:19,589
So this religion has created this divisiveness; 
people are just killing each other in the

107
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,639
name of God, in the name of religion.

108
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,010
Even in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be surprised, 
I have seen people taking advantage of my

109
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:36,449
name, and trying to get into some mesmeric 
groups.

110
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:40,180
I can’t understand.

111
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,199
Using my name, using my photograph!

112
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:55,470
So beware this should not happen to you people.

113
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:09,009
Using the name of Christ, the Incarnation 
of Divine Love, they are doing all these works

114
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:17,829
of violence, hatred, of cheating, I mean very 
debased people.

115
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:24,540
And from one to another it passes, to the 
another it passes.

116
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,369
Same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

117
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:34,209
If I told somebody that you are no more a 
leader, somebody else is the leader, immediately

118
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:42,309
that person gets angry, he forgets what good 
sahaj has done to him, he just forgets.

119
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:47,790
If I tell him the leadership should pass to 
somebody else, finished!

120
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:54,759
Then he forgets that whatever good was done 
to him, whatever Sahaja Yoga has done for

121
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,980
him, he’s living only because Sahaj has 
helped him.

122
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,240
So this leadership goes into the heads of 
people.

123
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:12,600
Sahaja Yoga is not here to make leaders out 
of you, no never.

124
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:21,569
It is just for convenience we have leaders 
and if they become inconvenient we have to

125
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:26,620
change it, that’s all, as simple as that.

126
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:38,760
But still I find this idea of authority is 
something very great and they start using

127
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:46,159
it left and right, everywhere it is happening 
practically in every country, has happened

128
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:55,700
and still happening 
which is a very sad thing.

129
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,230
This will never bring forth my efforts.

130
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:09,460
My effort is to synthesise the whole, not 
to divide, by no chance to divide.

131
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:22,640
Only thing, whatever is wrong, whatever is 
unholy has to be brought to your notice.

132
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,649
See as a housewife, when we clean the rice, 
there are some white stones in it, we take

133
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:31,980
them out.

134
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,649
We don’t cook rice with that stone, do we?

135
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:38,149
And such stones have to go out.

136
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:42,010
So some of them are just like stones.

137
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,789
You cannot change them.

138
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:53,260
Namadeva has said that they are like a fly, 
who when lives gives us trouble by coming

139
00:18:53,260 --> 00:19:02,990
on our food and by making us feel nauseated 
and if by mistake we take her inside in our

140
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,649
stomach, she is dead but still she troubles 
us.

141
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,950
These are all rakshasas, I should say.

142
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:18,179
They can never understand Sahaja Yoga and 
they will always try to trouble us.

143
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:25,950
But what must the people who have achieved 
Sahaja Yoga should do.

144
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:35,029
Should they also take to such methods?

145
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:40,370
I have never blamed anyone for anything.

146
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,270
Like, people say, “Mother he didn’t give 
any money to Sahaja Yoga so he has lost all

147
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,270
his money.”

148
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:50,289
I never say like that “He should have donated 
some money!”

149
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,980
I never ask for donations, I never ask for 
money.

150
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,480
Every time I say it’s all sufficient.

151
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Don’t need.

152
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:11,549
I have never asked for a single pie from anyone 
to be given to me even when I needed

153
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:22,000
because I know I don’t have that problem.

154
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,149
From the life of Christ one has to understand.

155
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:27,890
He had no problems.

156
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,710
He was fearless.

157
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,470
He knew he was the son of God.

158
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,559
He had no problems at all.

159
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:41,330
He faced everything, even his crucifixion.

160
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,470
And people, I think, liked his crucifixion 
or what?

161
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,720
They carry the cross.

162
00:20:49,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Of course is the transformed symbol of Swastika 
no doubt but still.

163
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,940
He had to sacrifice his life.

164
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:24,210
He sacrificed his life for all the human being 
not for only white or black, brown or blue

165
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:35,230
but he sacrificed his life for all of us so 
that we could cross over our agnya.

166
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:42,720
The condemnation we should do is not of others 
but of ourselves.

167
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:52,840
We can call that as a crucifixion of ours 
by which we see as Sahaja Yogis where are

168
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
we going.

169
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,160
I’m told there are some 80-90 Sahaja Yogis 
who have come, who were mesmerised by some

170
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
people.

171
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,520
How could Sahaja Yogis be mesmerised?

172
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,610
Is it possible?

173
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:22,659
They never must be praying, they may not be 
doing meditation.

174
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:26,090
How can they get into it?

175
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,919
And now they are asking for forgiveness.

176
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,340
I forgive but that doesn’t mean they will 
be alright.

177
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,270
We cannot fix them anymore.

178
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:46,000
We do not put spoiled apples with the good 
ones, do we?

179
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,390
This [is] no wisdom.

180
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,690
They are already spoiled, and they should 
keep out till I say.

181
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,529
They should not attend any centre, they should 
not come to any puja.

182
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:01,480
They should let them cleanse themselves.

183
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:08,419
Though a rotten apple cannot get well they 
can.

184
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:14,360
They should try to understand that they were 
not Sahaja Yogis.

185
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:24,029
If a Sahaja Yogi can get mesmerised, then 
what’s the use of doing Sahaja Yoga.

186
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:32,340
What’s the use of getting your Kundalini 
raised?

187
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:40,210
That means that they are very poor Sahaja 
Yogis.

188
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:49,750
Surprisingly I have not seen this kind of 
a phenomena in the west, very surprising!

189
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:56,679
Western Sahaja Yogis, whatever they were, 
they are great Sahaja Yogis, I must say if

190
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:03,220
you consider the number of good people there.

191
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,730
They have given up so-called Christianity, 
they have given up all this nonsense, drinking,

192
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:14,019
drugs, womanising, everything they have given 
up.

193
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:22,769
And I haven’t met one person who has taken 
to drinking again or who has taken even to

194
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:24,860
smoking.

195
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:30,960
This Yoga bhoomi of yours, which is India.

196
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,149
How could it happen here?

197
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:36,990
Specially in Maharashtra.

198
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:44,299
I think some devilish people are born in this 
Maharashtra all the time because how is it

199
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:53,070
they tortured each and every saint?

200
00:24:53,070 --> 00:25:00,220
How?

201
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:09,490
How is it, they have been so much enticed 
by somebody who is saying something which

202
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:16,750
I have never said?

203
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:27,320
Shows a very low type of people, very low.

204
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:36,130
And they must have been always being born 
in this Maharashtra, I am sure and again they

205
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:44,160
are born today.

206
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:52,750
I never wanted to talk about this at the jubilant 
time like this when Christ was born.

207
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:59,840
Yes, it’s a thing of jubilation because 
He came as a Saviour.

208
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,120
He did everything that is possible under the 
sun.

209
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:16,620
For us it’s alright but what about Him, 
what did we give Him?

210
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:22,320
In the same way many Sahaja Yogis go on demanding, 
Mother we can’t even meet you, we can’t

211
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,039
even shake hands with you, we can’t even 
fall at your feet.

212
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:32,090
We can’t do this, we can’t do that.

213
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,559
It surprises me.

214
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:38,460
“You must do this, You must do that.”

215
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,390
All the time lecturing to me.

216
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,899
What you must do?

217
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:58,530
You must do, is to meditate and to believe 
that this Paramchaitanya is My power and that

218
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,059
you have felt My power within you.

219
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,350
The more you are away from you the better 
you will be.

220
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:18,679
Absolutely, I can’t understand the demanding 
nature of some Sahaja Yogis.

221
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:28,710
They have got their Jagruti (awakening of 
Kundalini) which would never have happened.

222
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:34,490
If Christ wanted, He would have killed all 
of them and lived very well, but I think He

223
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:51,220
must have been fed up with the stupidity all 
around.

224
00:27:51,220 --> 00:28:00,500
So at this time, we have to understand that 
such a great Incarnation came on this earth.

225
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,180
Of course he couldn’t give Realisation.

226
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,259
Imagine the people who were about to crucify 
Him, how could he give realisation?

227
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:15,840
Supposing somebody comes with the dagger at 
Me, can I give them realisation?

228
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,409
It’s all right.

229
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:23,100
Nobody listened to Them, nobody thought anything 
of them but not you!

230
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,010
You people have got your realisation.

231
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,570
You are born again people.

232
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,429
You are great people.

233
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:31,000
Your potential is there.

234
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,739
Instead of utilising that now, what are you 
doing?

235
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:41,919
How many people are really involved in Sahaja 
Yoga?

236
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,919
Introspect.

237
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,100
They have their own business, they have their 
own this thing, they have – How many are

238
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,770
really involved in Sahaja Yoga?

239
00:28:49,770 --> 00:29:01,169
He had only twelve disciples, except for one 
or two, all of them dedicated without realisation,

240
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:08,509
dedicated fully to the work of Christianity 
and which spread because they had not much

241
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:11,220
idea about the whole thing.

242
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:19,630
The Christians that they had were just converts, 
useless people

243
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:26,390
and I would say that if they did not do any 
justice to the birth of Christ, one can understand.

244
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,940
But what about you people?

245
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:44,750
Who are born twice, who have got their self 
Knowledge, who are so equipped with all the

246
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:56,159
powers, who are connected with this all power, 
what you can call the power of Divine Love?

247
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:07,690
All your powers can be utilised, can be known.

248
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:13,740
It’s like some dynamic machine which has 
started.

249
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:26,549
Few wheels are moving but there are so many 
wheels after wheels and so much you can do.

250
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:33,610
I cannot blame the Christians who are so stupid 
because after all they never got their awakening.

251
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:41,409
Only some priest would bring some water, put 
it on their head and baptised them, finished.

252
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:45,909
But what about you people?

253
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:51,440
I have lived because of you, because I wanted 
to see that you people mature.

254
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,420
That’s the idea of the Mother is.

255
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:05,580
There are many who are matured, I would not 
say, but still many have to be matured.

256
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:11,429
Doesn’t mean that you should be able to 
give big lectures, or write books or anything.

257
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:14,389
But within yourself you should mature.

258
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:32,929
Your own personality should flower into the 
fragrance of love of divinity.

259
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:36,990
This is what I would say is the difference 
between Me and Christ.

260
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,570
He said “Baba I had enough, No, No, No more!

261
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:45,820
With these stupid people.”

262
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,799
Not Me, I knew what was the world like.

263
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,460
I knew what had happened to this world.

264
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:59,070
Today the world is much worse, because all 
the religions are fighting among themselves,

265
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,450
firstly.

266
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:08,330
All the politicians are trying to be very 
badly corrupt, competing in that corruption.

267
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:14,300
Nobody has sense of truth and honesty.

268
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:25,720
Everybody is involved in the advertisement, 
newspapers, media, this, that, which is the

269
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,460
most corrupting influence today.

270
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:39,990
With all this background, I know by the year 
2000, Sahaja Yoga will come out in the whole

271
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:52,749
world as something very great…(applause) 
– You did not allow me to complete the sentence

272
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:58,620
– if you people become real Sahaja Yogis.

273
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,700
All of you.

274
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,799
All of you who are attending to Me here.

275
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:09,510
Even this much group if it becomes real Sahaja 
Yogis.

276
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,789
It doesn’t matter if I cannot meet you personally.

277
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:17,120
It doesn’t matter if I cannot go to your 
places.

278
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,019
It doesn’t matter, nothing matters.

279
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:26,600
Christ’s disciples worked when he never 
existed.

280
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:35,210
So it’s not important, what is important 
is that you are the people who are responsible

281
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:41,070
for the emancipation of this world, for the 
synthesis of this world, to bring peace and

282
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,830
joy and happiness to people.

283
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:50,299
Just now when I was coming, people spread 
the shawls.

284
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:59,720
It reminded Me of Christ when he came, they 
brought palms leaves to wish him and spread

285
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,990
their shawls on the ground for him to go, 
and where does he go?

286
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,990
To Gallows.

287
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:13,270
He goes to cross, he goes for his death.

288
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:21,690
When you show your love for Me, you have to 
know that you have to love the whole work

289
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,970
of Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:30,490
It’s not some personal relationship with 
Me that is going to work out.

291
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:35,030
All these western countries in the influence 
of Christianity will go down, you will see.

292
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,330
They are going down already because there’s 
is no morality.

293
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:45,320
There’s recession, all kinds of problems, 
their children are wavered, they are drinking,

294
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,520
smoking, doing all kinds of things.

295
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,820
Even their influence on us is corrupting us.

296
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,060
Antichrist activity, throughout if you find.

297
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,700
It’s nothing but antichrist activity.

298
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,850
Who is the Antichrist?

299
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,630
They are describing he is the antichrist, 
that fellow is the Antichrist.

300
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,000
That’s not the thing.

301
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:16,870
There is an antichrist within us, who accepts 
all these things which are against the purity

302
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:22,240
and love of Christ.

303
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,780
So first of all among yourselves.

304
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,300
What is he going?

305
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,070
Sit down!

306
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:39,430
You must teach your children some manners.

307
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,600
This girl who was drowned is because you neglected 
the child.

308
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,790
The father, where was he?

309
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,790
I don’t know.

310
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:52,930
I can’t understand how can a child be left 
like that.

311
00:35:52,930 --> 00:36:02,920
It’s important to discipline your children.

312
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,150
…if you have a neighbour, you’ve had it.

313
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:15,131
He will try to find out where you go, what 
you do.

314
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:24,610
He will have a binocular to see and you make 
any noise, you are finished but even if you

315
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,490
sing, you are finished.

316
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,060
In that way, Indians are better.

317
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,950
They don’t have that noise difficulty.

318
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,390
We don’t have.

319
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,730
Indians can live in the noise.

320
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:42,230
I wanted to find out why Indians are so adjustable 
to noise.

321
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,120
They don’t mind noise.

322
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:53,870
I found out the reason is that in the west 
people are under stress and strain and that’s

323
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,540
why they can’t bear.

324
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,420
But in India, people don’t know what is 
stress and strain is.

325
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,952
Still that has not developed, I don’t know 
how to that extent.

326
00:37:05,952 --> 00:37:08,040
That disease has not come.

327
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,160
That might be the reason that they are so 
much frightened of noises.

328
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,590
People will come from villages here.

329
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,190
They’ll sleep on the station, nothing happens.

330
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:27,040
The trains are coming and going, nicely sleeping.

331
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:34,370
Imagine in the west, thank God, in Italy we 
have neighbours little far away, we had a

332
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,370
little trouble.

333
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:40,510
But in England, we had to go on changing our 
ashram from one place to another, run away

334
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,460
from here to there, because of great neighbours, 
we had one of them had the name Mr Peace.

335
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:51,110
I don’t know who gave him that name.

336
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,340
Such contradictions in life.

337
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,890
Such horrible contradictions.

338
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:07,370
I don’t know how will they learn how to 
love their neighbour.

339
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,020
But Indians do.

340
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:15,580
Somehow they don’t have this problem, not 
much.

341
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,400
Sometimes they have but not so much.

342
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:27,350
But if there is a music supposing, all the 
neighbours will join, bring tea, bring this,

343
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,600
they’ll be enjoying the music.

344
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,560
But there the collectivity is so little I 
think, I can’t understand how can they call

345
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,940
themselves Christians.

346
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:50,140
Only they go to church, well dressed and our 
Mayor told Me that for fifteen minutes hardly

347
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,890
we can sit.

348
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,050
We start looking at the watches.

349
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,400
Fifteen minutes.

350
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:05,120
And after half an hour, we all run out of 
the jail and how is it these people are sitting

351
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,020
with you for hours together.

352
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:14,350
I said, I must be mesmerising them.

353
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:20,160
I mean they are not so collective, unless 
and until they drink, they cannot be collective.

354
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,770
Unless and until they get intoxicated, they 
cannot talk to each other.

355
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:28,990
They are all the time tired.

356
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,700
They are supposed to be Christians.

357
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:39,700
They are so tired, you see them in the films 
or anywhere, they come and sit down “hah!”.

358
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
What has happened?

359
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,690
Young people.

360
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,500
All the time thinking, thinking, thinking, 
which comes from Agya.

361
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:58,030
Which comes from anti-Christ activity!

362
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,120
Anti-Christ activity, thinking, thinking, 
thinking.

363
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,660
What should we do tomorrow?

364
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,780
What is to be done and all that.

365
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:20,660
Still we have to hope that this kind of religion 
will finish.

366
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,560
All such religions must finish.

367
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,830
They have to go now, it’s too much.

368
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:31,530
you cannot support them.

369
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:39,410
They are so much full of anti-religious temperament 
that you just can’t bear them.

370
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:51,240
Better to finish Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, 
Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, all isms one after

371
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,040
another.

372
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,220
To what religion did Christ belong?

373
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,520
I don’t know.

374
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,940
You belong to one religion which is Sahaj.

375
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,600
Which is the universal religion, which is 
the pure religion, which is born within you.

376
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:21,740
You don’t belong to any other religion because 
there is no religion in that.

377
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:39,550
So by the time 2000 years, I hope all these 
religions will run away from this earth.

378
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:44,340
(applause).

379
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:55,230
All of them fighting for nothing at all, killing 
each other for nothing at all.

380
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,820
They want, they want to fight, they like to 
fight.

381
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:06,780
Why blame Koran, why blame Bible, why blame 
Christ, why blame anyone.

382
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,090
They want to fight.

383
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,490
They are of divisive nature.

384
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:17,640
They want to have separate nations, separate 
communities, separate this.

385
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,410
Once you start separating you are antichrist.

386
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,730
Absolutely.

387
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:38,700
In Sahaja Yoga also I say that you are one 
identity, you are not separate country, separate

388
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:46,590
organisation, separate this, doesn’t exist 
in my own idea.

389
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,310
Doesn’t exist.

390
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:53,440
I never thought of it.

391
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,890
We are all children of one Father and of one 
Mother.

392
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,200
We have no business to think we are separate.

393
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,110
Even now, I have seen groups are made very 
easily.

394
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,110
How?

395
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:15,940
The groups are made.

396
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:30,780
Like I find Maharashtrians

397
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:39,390
are sitting together (Mother talks briefly 
in Marathi.)

398
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:47,090
Then we have group of the North Indians.

399
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:53,680
Indians are quite separatist I tell you, somehow, 
by temperament.

400
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,060
North Indians also have separate separate 
ideas.

401
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,200
“You must come to Indore.”

402
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,040
Why?

403
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,920
Is it not a part of India?

404
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,360
They can’t come to Delhi?

405
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:16,360
“You must come to Kanpur, You must come 
to Allahabad, you must come to Indore.”

406
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,220
You must go to every village, every place.

407
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,270
Why?

408
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:35,750
You are born today in Delhi, tomorrow you 
will be born in some horrid place, then, “This

409
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,040
place is mine.

410
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,300
This is my house..must come to my house.”

411
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,660
That’s another headache.

412
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,180
“You must come to my house.”

413
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,840
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

414
00:44:48,840 --> 00:45:02,670
Once you start that, you are finished, you 
are no more belonging to Christ, no more.

415
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:09,011
This is a very, very common programme – even 
today that, if you see around yourself, must

416
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:13,340
be people from your own country.

417
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:20,820
Just see around yourself, are you sitting 
with another people?

418
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,360
Who is the other?

419
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,930
In Sahaja Yoga, who is the other?

420
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:40,930
We are all one and this unity we have to learn, 
if you really love Me and Christ.

421
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:48,060
All this groupism and all this has to end 
now among Sahaja Yogis, must end.

422
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:57,080
We are all one identity, we are all one living 
body.

423
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,250
We are all one living organism.

424
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,420
We cannot say we are separate.

425
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:13,870
Can this hand separate from the body, can 
it exist?

426
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:21,310
Once you start giving it up, you will be surprised, 
you will have real enjoyment.

427
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:32,480
But once you have all these ideas about my, 
my, you can’t even enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

428
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:44,600
Cannot enjoy anybody else – “my wife, 
my children, my house”, my this, my that.

429
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,790
That awakening has to come within.

430
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:52,830
“I don’t belong to this country.”

431
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:59,030
Many girls you see and boys have written, 
“We’ll have Indian marriage.”

432
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:04,120
Only the age of the woman is 35 years.

433
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,120
Only!

434
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:13,880
Now where will I find a husband for her in 
India, must be some widower or somebody.

435
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,700
Must have an Indian marriage!

436
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,210
Can you beat that?

437
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,090
Such people, is impossible to marry them.

438
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:28,550
I give you choice, all right have a choice.

439
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:36,460
I also have a choice – I can’t marry you!

440
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,060
That is My choice!

441
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,720
You have the freedom to say where you want 
to marry – alright marry.

442
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,430
But as far as I am concerned, I can’t marry 
you like that.

443
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:58,440
You have to marry wherever there is a good 
match for you.

444
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:04,800
Many Indian girls have married with Indians 
boys, and have suffered a lot, such a lot,

445
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:13,410
you won’t believe! (talks in Hindi briefly).

446
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,220
Not in Sahaja Yoga any more!

447
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:24,030
We have not been able to organise even one 
marriage of a Hindustani with an Hindustani

448
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:26,810
– not possible.

449
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:31,470
That’s not the desire of the Divine.

450
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:42,630
Why don’t you find in your own community 
somewhere [the] same thing.

451
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,030
As in India, is very particular.

452
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,720
Very very particular.

453
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,940
Like when my daughter was to be married, they 
said “No!

454
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,320
He his not a Shrivastava.

455
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,410
If he is a Shrivastava also, he is not the 
same Shrivastava.

456
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,720
Even if he is the same Shrivastava, his this 
thing is different!”

457
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
I mean.

458
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,320
I said, “Now this is going to finish”.

459
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:11,580
Because I had all my elders living and they 
were after me.

460
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:17,550
I said “Whether he is a Shrivastava or not 
Shrivastava I am going to marry them, finished!”

461
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,270
My husband agreed.

462
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:25,330
Same with my grandchildren.

463
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,390
If you get Shrivastava, well and good, otherwise 
forget it.

464
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,980
Maharashtrians also same.

465
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:40,050
Maharashtrians who have become Christians 
[are] also the same, you be amazed, Christians!

466
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:47,500
Now they are saying we are Dalit Christians, 
means who were converted from the lower caste

467
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,740
into Christianity.

468
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,740
Now there is a new caste that’s come.

469
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,960
Once you have become Christian, what is your 
caste?

470
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,540
You are Christian, not that.

471
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,770
They are Dalits and they are higher Christians.

472
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:08,800
They will not marry in the Dalit and Dalit 
won’t marry in the higher.

473
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:18,930
Supposed to be Christians, following Christ, 
going to church regularly, well dressed.

474
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,250
Even if they do not have a proper suit.

475
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:26,750
They must wear like English some suit, borrow 
it, and go to church because according to

476
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,160
Indian Christians, Christ was born in England.

477
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,820
(laughter) Really, you won’t believe.

478
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,000
Unless and until you wear a suit and a tie, 
you can’t go to the Church.

479
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:53,210
Can you imagine, anybody, going with a dhoti 
to church? (more laughter) Impossible situation.

480
00:50:53,210 --> 00:51:01,560
Even in my time, thank God I didn’t marry 
a Christian, but my own sisters and all were

481
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,270
forced to wear veils and not the saris, wear 
the frocks and the veils.

482
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:11,110
Can you imagine the wedding dress.

483
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,690
We, Indian women, can’t do without the saris.

484
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,850
But they were forced.

485
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,620
So many women married the way English marry.

486
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:27,960
And I was amazed even the Japanese who are 
Christians come to Australia and dress up

487
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:38,500
like these English brides and get married 
– because they are Christians.

488
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:44,090
That shows that they believe that Christ was 
born in England or what?

489
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:54,480
Actually, for Christians it’s not necessary 
to worry about any dress.

490
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,950
All this nonsense comes from the West that 
you must dress up like this, you must have

491
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,290
your spoon here, fork here.

492
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:11,610
Did Christ eat with fork and spoon?

493
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:15,490
He was born in the manger.

494
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:21,230
It’s impossible to understand these people 
are Christians.

495
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:25,850
So much worried about the spoons and forks 
and they came to your house for dinner, they

496
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:31,040
lift the plate to see from what company you 
have bought it.

497
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,950
[That’s] very important!

498
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,870
Such silly people!

499
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:39,640
I tell you they call themselves Christians.

500
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:47,750
Christ was born in the manger and [they are] 
so particular about nonsensical things.

501
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:58,110
You see one must understand the greatness 
of His birth, in which he has shown that he

502
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:03,190
was born with the cows tied there and the 
calves were there.

503
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:11,680
He was born in the manger.

504
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:18,310
Not only the Christians abroad but they are 
also in India the same – you can make out

505
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:19,850
a Christian in no time.

506
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:27,950
See them on a Sunday morning.

507
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:37,130
That way my father opposed it – he used 
to wear kurta, because Christ wore kurta.

508
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:43,210
He didn’t wear suit, did he?

509
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:45,230
And so superficial they are.

510
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,820
Nothing to learn from them.

511
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:56,840
They will put here on top [a label written] 
“Saville Row”, On top of the suit!!

512
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:05,310
Such stupid people, I tell you, and the Indians 
are following them left and right, I can’t

513
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,530
understand.

514
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:07,570
They are anti-Christ.

515
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:12,410
Don’t follow them on these points.

516
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:19,550
Indians have at least certain sense of dignity.

517
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:29,490
If you have any, why should you wear a suit 
on a May day here?

518
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,960
In this heat?

519
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,780
We are Sahaja Yogis.

520
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,440
We have to wear a common dress of a common 
man.

521
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:46,130
Whom are we going to impress except for this 
Paramchaitanya?

522
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:58,740
They are extremely superficial extremely meticulously 
particular about their dress, how they live

523
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,340
and it’s really horrible.

524
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:10,470
I have seen this and that is the reason I 
think I should warn you.

525
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:17,340
Don’t take to that culture, that is anti-Christ 
culture.

526
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:25,810
Absolutely anti-Christ in every way.

527
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:33,480
In every way they have insulted Christ out 
and out.

528
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,510
You people should not anymore insult Christ.

529
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,500
In a simple way you live.

530
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:49,000
I mean now this sari, they forced me to wear 
is like a big bag for Me but what to do.

531
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,730
Yesterday also they forced Me, today also 
they forced me.

532
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:56,350
I am supposed to wear all this because I am 
Adi Shakti, supposed to be.

533
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:06,430
If I was Christ, I would have been better 
off.

534
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:09,330
He was much more free than Me!

535
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:17,830
Now, with all this what we have to know, what 
is the message?

536
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:25,180
What is the message of Christ?

537
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:33,600
That you develop your spirituality, your divinity 
by which you know what is the dignity of a

538
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,960
Sahaja Yogi is.

539
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:41,860
He was your eldest brother I should say.

540
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,670
His lifestyle you should follow.

541
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:51,620
Absolutely not afraid of anything, not worried 
about any job, nothing, not worried about

542
00:56:51,620 --> 00:57:00,310
any business anything, absolutely free from 
all worries.

543
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:08,450
So many examples we have, beautiful examples 
of his life, but when we see Christians, we

544
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:21,290
try to reflect it as an expression of the 
life of Christ and that is where we make mistake.

545
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:33,180
They are, by no means they are for Christ, 
they are, by no means, following Christ.

546
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:38,690
So as Sahaja Yogis, we have a different culture.

547
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,580
We have a culture where we respect morality.

548
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,980
We have dignity, we have our own personality.

549
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:55,480
We are fearless, we don’t tell lies, we 
don’t cheat and we can never get mesmerised.

550
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:09,230
So we have to have, now we can call it “the 
Mother’s culture”, and which is not in

551
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:16,270
any way showing off, or in any way taking 
to artificial things.

552
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:23,541
The whole thing will change, the whole concept 
will change, whole idea will change, once

553
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:34,920
you understand that you are now in “the 
Mother’s culture”.

554
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,990
Now they have forced me, so I am wearing all 
right.

555
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,750
You want me to wear, alright I’ll wear.

556
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:48,830
But normally if you leave it to Me what do 
I wear, you know that.

557
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:52,650
Secret is out already!

558
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:57,920
If you want to give me presents, give me, 
I never asked you for presents, nothing!

559
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,780
Forcing the presents on my head!

560
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,910
Alright, for your joy’s sake you have it.

561
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,580
What to do?

562
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,280
But one thing I must request these Maharashtrians.

563
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:17,180
They are not going to give me anymore, anymore, 
again anymore what they call is the oti part.

564
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:21,090
My oti is overfull.

565
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:25,920
Absolutely, nobody has to give me oti.

566
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,840
If somebody gets married, if somebody has 
a child, somebody has anything, they’ll

567
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,950
bring the oti.

568
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:39,380
There is no need to give me any oti, you can 
go to the temple, you give your oti there

569
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:47,210
it is resold and resold and resold in between 
the sellers who are Gujaratis, the brahmins

570
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:53,170
who are the pujaris make money.

571
00:59:53,170 --> 01:00:00,570
So no more oti, nobody is going to give Me 
any oti whatsoever.

572
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:12,730
On a Christmas day I have to say one thing 
– what did we give to Christ.

573
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:19,320
And the second question what are we going 
to give to Mother.

574
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,560
This is very important.

575
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:29,520
I don’t want anything from you, nothing.

576
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,280
I am fully content with Myself.

577
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:41,000
What I want is that you must dedicate yourself 
to Sahaja Yoga, to truth and to love.

578
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:56,830
I will be very happy and also not to talk 
like, what you call, Christ has called them,

579
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:01,550
“murmuring souls” – talking here there, 
one saying there.

580
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,800
All this.I don’t like at all.

581
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,400
I don’t like it and it should not be done.

582
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,480
If you do like this, you will fall, fall very 
badly.

583
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,320
This is the last judgement.

584
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:17,260
Either you‘ll go to heaven or you‘ll go 
to hell.

585
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:20,090
It’s already working out like that.

586
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,870
So let’s see.

587
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,650
Where are you?

588
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:31,500
So I have to again and again tell you as your 
mother, I have to correct you and tell you

589
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:43,210
that remember this is the last judgement and 
please, do not take anymore to the activities

590
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:46,970
which are anti-Christ.

591
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:53,640
You can judge within yourself – [whether] 
whatever you are doing is not good, and for

592
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,170
that, best thing is to dedicate yourself to 
Sahaja Yoga.

593
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:01,230
But not to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

594
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,570
Not to make politics out of Sahaja Yoga.

595
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:13,680
But make Sahaja Yoga like a big, huge, big 
tree and it will work out.

596
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,390
I know it will work out.

597
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:17,650
You have the potential.

598
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,240
That’s why you are here.

599
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,050
May God bless you all
