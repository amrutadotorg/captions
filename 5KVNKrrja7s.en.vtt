Sahastrara Puja
Cabella Ligure 7.5.2000

10:04.793 --> 10:20.169
Thirty years back, when Sahastrara was opened,

10:20.844 --> 10:24.955
I found darkness all over.

10:25.239 --> 10:29.220
People were so ignorant.

10:29.458 --> 10:36.264
They had no awareness  what they have to find.

10:36.466 --> 10:45.717
Of course, I found they wanted to find something that was unknown,

10:45.908 --> 10:52.311
but they did not know what was unknown, what they have to find.

10:53.096 --> 10:59.647
And they were extremely ignorant people, about themselves,

10:59.863 --> 11:07.032
and about their surroundings, and about the aim of their life.

11:07.590 --> 11:16.201
I didn’t know how to start the topic with them.

11:17.102 --> 11:28.538
When the Sahastrara was opened, I thought of trying

11:29.411 --> 11:38.877
Self-realisation only on one lady: she was an old lady.

11:39.107 --> 11:45.107
And there was another lady who also started to come up.

11:45.972 --> 11:56.114
This old lady got her Realisation, and then the another lady who was much younger

11:56.941 --> 12:03.592
she told me that she gets fits and she gets possessed.

12:03.799 --> 12:08.691
“Oh my God!” I said, “how will I give her Realisation?”

12:09.109 --> 12:17.499
But somehow she got cured very fast and she also got her Realisation.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.482
It’s a very unknown knowledge.

12:21.974 --> 12:27.305
Also, human beings, in their ego, do not want to accept

12:27.669 --> 12:35.098
that they are not yet complete, that they have to have their Realisation.

12:35.693 --> 12:45.685
Also their style of life was such that they had no time for themselves.

12:47.256 --> 12:56.212
I found it very difficult to convince people that you must take your Self-realisation,

12:56.959 --> 13:01.954
because they thought it is something imaginary,

13:02.074 --> 13:07.415
it is very far-fetched, and they only believed in ‘gurus’

13:07.581 --> 13:14.526
who would say alright, “Do this much of rituals, karmakand."

13:14.673 --> 13:16.323
That’s all!

13:16.433 --> 13:20.035
And they were doing all kinds of rituals

13:20.218 --> 13:24.130
with the ‘kind’ guidance of their gurus,

13:24.618 --> 13:29.283
without knowing that you have to first know yourself,

13:29.465 --> 13:37.210
which is said by all the great incarnations, all the saints – clearly!

13:38.622 --> 13:45.908
It is not that it was only my idea that people should get their Self-realisation

13:46.174 --> 13:50.258
but it was the idea of all those people.

13:50.771 --> 13:56.510
They said, one after another, for centuries, that “Seek yourself."

13:57.026 --> 13:59.268
Even Christ said “Know thyself”.

13:59.355 --> 14:03.811
Mohammed Saheb said the same, Nanak Saheb said the same.

14:03.914 --> 14:09.451
But nobody tried to know that these rituals are not

14:09.611 --> 14:14.073
the end of life, they will not serve the purpose,

14:14.280 --> 14:17.699
and that you have to have Realisation.

14:21.259 --> 14:25.645
So those two ladies, only, got Self-realisation,

14:25.907 --> 14:30.747
and with that I thought, “Let’s go to the seashore."

14:31.239 --> 14:36.338
And about thirty people came with me.

14:37.766 --> 14:44.171
And they were talking in a very funny manner as to:

14:44.354 --> 14:50.020
How they can get Self-realisation?
They don’t deserve it.

14:50.206 --> 14:55.416
They have not been very good people.

14:55.473 --> 14:58.479
All kinds of things: condemning themselves!

14:59.558 --> 15:04.584
And in that lot I got about twelve people, altogether,

15:05.030 --> 15:10.968
inclusive of these two ladies who got Realisation [before].

15:13.703 --> 15:28.412
This is a sign that the movement of knowing yourself is very, very slow,

15:30.027 --> 15:36.426
and people don’t understand why they should know themselves.

15:36.803 --> 15:43.234
I was quite disappointed, because nobody understood me.

15:44.572 --> 15:49.441
But one day it so happened that, in one of the programmes,

15:49.846 --> 15:54.512
one lady came: she was possessed,

15:55.137 --> 15:59.597
and she started talking in Sanskrit language.

15:59.811 --> 16:05.980
She was just a maid-servant, and everybody was surprised

16:06.347 --> 16:10.412
and she said, “You don’t know who she is!”

16:10.861 --> 16:18.414
And then she started describing me from the Saundarya Lahari.

16:18.777 --> 16:22.287
I was wondering, “What’s the matter with this lady?”

16:23.032 --> 16:26.426
Like a man she spoke. Her voice was like a man.

16:26.662 --> 16:29.807
People may believe it or not. But she was very possessed.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.778
And then they started asking her.

16:34.831 --> 16:39.317
And then they came and asked me, “Mother, what she is saying – is it true?”

16:39.817 --> 16:42.382
I said, “You should find out yourself."

16:42.546 --> 16:48.580
Because  those days people were such that if you tell them anything like that,

16:48.751 --> 16:51.175
they would turn their faces.

16:51.305 --> 16:57.455
Only the kind of false gurus who would say “Alright, you give me five rupees."

16:57.780 --> 17:00.389
They would be very happy that, “You can purchase the guru!

17:00.389 --> 17:03.098
Now you don’t have to bother about anything.

17:03.967 --> 17:07.800
You don’t have to do anything."

17:09.714 --> 17:16.168
So, with that, gradually, it started working out.

17:16.395 --> 17:21.168
And I remember that these people who got their Realisation

17:21.834 --> 17:26.261
asked me, “Mother you allow us to do Durga puja."

17:26.698 --> 17:31.724
Durga puja was regarded as something, a very difficult thing.

17:32.173 --> 17:38.862
And Brahmins were normally not ready to do it,
because they were not Realised-souls,

17:39.045 --> 17:46.747
so they used to get into fits and into all kinds of problems.

17:46.940 --> 17:50.054
So they called the Brahmins, seven of them,

17:50.182 --> 17:53.126
and told them, “You just don’t worry.

17:53.295 --> 17:58.194
Nothing will happen to you, because now you are facing the Reality.

17:58.324 --> 18:01.939
It’s not some sort of a...

18:03.247 --> 18:06.827
murti  puja or anything. It’s a human being."

18:07.049 --> 18:09.526
They were quite frightened. They came down.

18:09.831 --> 18:13.680
But something happened to them: with a great

18:13.807 --> 18:17.852
confidence they started all the mantras, everything,

18:18.106 --> 18:20.988
and the vibrations started flowing everywhere.

18:22.807 --> 18:29.052
Even, we were very close to the sea, I found  the sea was roaring.

18:29.369 --> 18:33.860
But people didn’t understand.

18:34.299 --> 18:37.531
Except for these seven people, they said, “Nothing happened to us,

18:37.618 --> 18:39.829
we dideverything so well!”

18:40.558 --> 18:44.728
I think that was the first miracle of Sahaja Yoga.

18:46.253 --> 18:49.957
You see, the trouble with human mind at this level,

18:50.045 --> 18:55.794
or at this time, is that they have too much of self-importance,

18:56.761 --> 19:00.038
and they think no end of themselves.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.194
So already they think, “We are great!

19:03.249 --> 19:07.598
What is there to know ourselves?
We know ourselves very well."

19:08.411 --> 19:16.192
So the basic seeking power is humility.

19:16.838 --> 19:24.289
If you think you know everything, you cannot humble down, and you cannot seek.

19:25.435 --> 19:30.218
Even if you seek, they don’t want to follow anybody’s path.

19:30.271 --> 19:31.776
They say, “We have our own path.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.808
We will follow our own path.

19:33.988 --> 19:36.438
We’ll do whatever we want to do!”

19:36.763 --> 19:42.621
And, like this, I faced many people, in different countries,

19:42.978 --> 19:46.926
who just came to listen to my lecture, that’s all,

19:47.609 --> 19:50.323
but they wouldn’t take Realisation.

19:50.808 --> 19:57.612
And some of them did take their Realisation, they got it, but they got it lost.

19:59.007 --> 20:05.207
Somehow this was such a funny story for me

20:05.445 --> 20:08.548
that: I am giving them Realisation,

20:08.718 --> 20:11.185
I am taking no money for it, nothing.

20:11.288 --> 20:13.971
I used to travel on my own.

20:14.155 --> 20:18.875
But despite that, why is it, that the people

20:19.193 --> 20:22.970
don’t realise the value of Self-realisation?

20:24.601 --> 20:29.988
Then a gentle man who got Realisation, in the first lot,

20:30.539 --> 20:37.693
he told me, “Today, is a consumer society, as they call it, whatever it is."

20:38.249 --> 20:43.379
That, “Unless and until you take money from them, they will never value it.

20:43.728 --> 20:48.441
Let them feel that we have paid for it, for our Realisation.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.240
So at the gate only, you should keep somebody to take money,

20:51.288 --> 20:54.054
otherwise they don’t take to it."

20:54.942 --> 20:58.135
I said, “But you cannot sell it – it’s falsehood.

20:58.751 --> 21:02.530
You cannot sell Self-realisation to people."

21:03.711 --> 21:07.122
He said, “Then, you see, you won’t be successful."

21:07.773 --> 21:13.597
With other gurus this is main thing is that they just accept

21:13.946 --> 21:17.045
the money and even they tell people, “Bring so much money!

21:17.060 --> 21:19.839
Do this much. There is a fees.

21:20.383 --> 21:27.462
And that’s how only the ego is satisfied and people take to false people.

21:29.716 --> 21:34.265
This falsehood, they may realise later on,

21:34.376 --> 21:40.243
because they suffer a lot, with all kinds of physical,  mental problems,

21:40.576 --> 21:44.601
but by that time they are gone cases.

21:46.077 --> 21:52.479
Now the Sahastrara has not been yet described in any one of the books.

21:52.836 --> 21:57.357
Though they have talked about it, in our ancient books, in India also.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.855
They have talked about Sahastrara

21:59.910 --> 22:04.754
but nobody has described it except that it has one thousand petals.

22:06.722 --> 22:10.961
At least if they had mentioned something about it,

22:11.183 --> 22:15.798
it would have been easier for me to show that, “See, this is written in the book."

22:15.910 --> 22:18.239
Because people are like that!

22:18.461 --> 22:23.822
It has to be written in some book and that only they accept.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.943
It’s a very difficult situation!

22:27.236 --> 22:30.946
Because nobody had given a collective Realisation,

22:31.238 --> 22:34.690
so nobody had written to that extent, except for

22:34.834 --> 22:38.476
one or two people who wrote clearly about Kundalini.

22:39.007 --> 22:42.936
But I wouldn’t say it was so clear, because it was all in poetry.

22:43.099 --> 22:48.807
So people would sing the songs, but they would not understand.

22:50.461 --> 22:55.570
But I was thinking, “How these people who were lost,

22:56.018 --> 23:02.288
here and there under some sort of a seeking, what will happen to them?

23:03.143 --> 23:08.799
And how will I be able to give them Self-realisation?”

23:11.548 --> 23:19.719
Experiences were so horrid, but doesn’t matter.

23:20.434 --> 23:26.835
I went on and on and on, and I worked it out.

23:27.294 --> 23:35.200
Of course, we met some people who were also very cruel and nasty,

23:35.708 --> 23:40.528
who troubled me and troubled Sahaja Yogis.

23:41.654 --> 23:52.403
All these things should have really dampened my enthusiasm.

23:52.760 --> 23:58.826
But on the contrary I started thinking, “Why?
Why people are like this?”

23:59.795 --> 24:09.458
Then I realised one thing: that we cannot have the whole world to get Self-realisation.

24:10.498 --> 24:14.280
This is the Last Judgment.

24:14.637 --> 24:21.677
At this time people have to decide what is the most important thing.

24:22.703 --> 24:30.002
They have to know themselves and understand what they have got.

24:32.204 --> 24:42.888
It’s not just having a big number that will help us, but really solid Sahaja Yogis.

24:45.331 --> 24:53.179
Then I found there were people who got cured of many diseases

24:53.737 --> 24:57.197
but most of them got lost.

24:57.840 --> 25:02.052
Some of them, who were drug addicts, gave up drug-addiction.

25:02.640 --> 25:06.494
Drinking, they gave up.
Smoking they gave up.

25:06.590 --> 25:10.140
I never said a word, that, “You give up this or give up that."

25:10.247 --> 25:15.732
I knew, once the Kundalini rises, they will automatically give up.

25:16.387 --> 25:18.142
And it happened.

25:18.254 --> 25:26.089
And that’s how people became so clean, so beautiful, and started enjoying their life.

25:26.765 --> 25:29.116
But nobody would believe them.

25:30.163 --> 25:35.597
When they went round and talked to people, they said, “Oh, you have gone mad!”

25:35.739 --> 25:40.768
They couldn’t believe how they have stopped drinking, how they are not smoking.

25:40.871 --> 25:44.080
They said, “We want to drink! And what is this?”

25:44.727 --> 25:52.560
So, the identification, I found, of these people were mostly

25:52.758 --> 25:58.632
with the very loose type of enjoyment.

25:59.411 --> 26:06.399
They enjoyed very loose type of things, which had nothing to do with the Spirit.

26:07.230 --> 26:10.989
Gradually, of course, it started working out.

26:12.556 --> 26:23.187
But still, I must say, that we can’t expect, in this Kali Yuga,

26:23.902 --> 26:30.193
to have billions and billions of people in Sahaja Yoga.

26:30.486 --> 26:37.161
Though it’s my desire, it’s your desire, and you want them to get their Self-realisation,

26:37.875 --> 26:41.770
by which so many good things can happen.

26:41.982 --> 26:47.966
Firstly, your physical self improves.

26:49.916 --> 26:52.256
Many people have been cured.

26:52.290 --> 26:55.300
Christ cured only twenty one people.

26:56.267 --> 27:03.349
But I don’t know how many thousands have been cured with Sahaja Yoga.

27:04.656 --> 27:13.252
Also there’s another very big problem with human beings:

27:14.196 --> 27:22.635
that they read all kinds of books,

27:22.929 --> 27:28.389
and they have no clear-cut idea as to what they should find,

27:29.804 --> 27:31.685
what is their seeking.

27:33.666 --> 27:36.065
It’s a very big problem.

27:36.336 --> 27:39.746
And whatever is in one book, they’ll try to follow that.

27:40.009 --> 27:43.364
I mean they are  shifting type of people.

27:43.874 --> 27:47.163
They shift from one to another

27:47.720 --> 27:55.169
and then progress in Sahaja Yoga is much more difficult, very difficult,

27:55.526 --> 27:58.253
because if you are going on one path

27:58.364 --> 28:03.734
and you start shifting from one to another, you may go back.

28:03.996 --> 28:07.613
But in that they find it is their ‘freedom’.

28:07.881 --> 28:13.126
Actually without Realisation you don’t have your freedom, of anything.

28:13.550 --> 28:23.290
Freedom is that in which you know what you are,
you know what you are capable of.

28:23.742 --> 28:28.977
In the freedom you are the one who should receive all the blessings.

28:29.588 --> 28:33.566
If these blessings are not there then you are not free.

28:33.757 --> 28:42.052
There’s something wrong, somewhere, in your own life.

28:42.507 --> 28:48.795
Because once you get your Realisation you become absolutely free people.

28:49.751 --> 28:55.502
‘Free’ means, your own Spirit guides you.

28:55.872 --> 29:04.155
The Spirit, as you know, is the reflection of the Divine, the God Almighty.

29:04.617 --> 29:10.155
If everybody has the same reflection and He’s awakened,

29:10.544 --> 29:17.542
then in the awareness it works.
As if they know what is right and what is wrong,

29:17.654 --> 29:21.524
what is constructive and what is destructive.

29:22.550 --> 29:27.142
It is not some sort of a false satisfaction that you have,

29:27.260 --> 29:32.255
but in reality, you feel the Reality.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.020
And that is what it has to happen.

29:36.305 --> 29:40.546
The first thing, in Sahaja Yoga, is that you get the experience,

29:40.829 --> 29:47.383
experience of feeling the spanda, the cool breeze, on your finger tips.

29:47.745 --> 29:51.265
Without the experience you should not believe anything.

29:51.448 --> 29:59.093
That means a new dimension has come now, in your nerves,

29:59.720 --> 30:08.110
that you can feel the system

30:08.662 --> 30:14.061
which has been not known to you.

30:14.202 --> 30:22.627
Sympathetic nervous system was there but you never knew how it is working.

30:23.065 --> 30:27.285
The knowledge about yourself was so poor.

30:27.768 --> 30:32.886
But after Realisation suddenly the whole thing got enlightened.

30:33.264 --> 30:38.710
Suddenly you started feeling it, the newness, among yourselves.

30:39.064 --> 30:42.652
Still sometimes you haveto fight your ego,

30:42.810 --> 30:46.500
you have to get over your ignorance of things.

30:47.061 --> 30:50.770
Because Realisation gives you Absolute Knowledge,

30:51.563 --> 30:55.367
Absolute Knowledge. It cannot be challenged.

30:56.978 --> 31:02.265
It’s single: as they call it – ‘Ekameva Satya’, (the only Truth).

31:02.846 --> 31:09.963
And when you get that knowledge then you can tally it also.

31:10.257 --> 31:14.754
You can find out if it is correct or not.

31:15.973 --> 31:20.621
This is something that has happened to all of you,

31:20.819 --> 31:27.624
and you have already got those vibrations with which you can feel it.

31:28.491 --> 31:35.991
For example, there may be some dissatisfied souls with Sahaja Yoga.

31:37.008 --> 31:44.628
But you can find out, on vibrations, who are these people and what are they doing.

31:44.897 --> 31:52.991
On vibrations you can make out if those people have reached
that state of Reality or not.

31:53.418 --> 31:59.132
You can make out if these people, who are

31:59.743 --> 32:05.951
trying to oppose you, or trying to tell you something else –
“How far are they?”

32:06.911 --> 32:09.741
On your fingertips you know.

32:09.852 --> 32:15.820
This is what is Qiyamah about which Mohammed Saheb has said.

32:16.214 --> 32:20.972
The other day I must tell you, an experience we had: There was one fellow

32:21.162 --> 32:27.619
who came from the television  known as ‘Star’.

32:28.244 --> 32:34.644
And he started asking me very funny questions, which had no relevance.

32:35.360 --> 32:38.474
His name was ‘Abbas’, so I said, “Abbas bhaiya,

32:38.630 --> 32:43.340
you are wasting your time and my time.
Will you come to the right questions!”

32:44.697 --> 32:48.745
So he said, “I am against all fundamentalism."

32:48.912 --> 32:50.719
“But I am not fundamentalist.

32:51.383 --> 32:55.101
How do you know I am that or not?”

32:56.242 --> 32:59.092
So he said, “I am trying to find out!”

32:59.299 --> 33:02.579
“Alright,” I said, “you put your hands towards me.

33:02.861 --> 33:07.800
Mohammed Saheb has said that ‘At the time of, Qiyamah your hands will speak’."

33:08.106 --> 33:13.039
And, you will be amazed, immediately he started feeling cool breeze on his hands.

33:13.149 --> 33:16.651
He said, “What’s happening to me?”
I said, “That’s what it is!”

33:20.500 --> 33:25.121
No use arguing, no use talking about it,

33:25.294 --> 33:28.089
no use enquiring.

33:28.225 --> 33:30.639
Just see yourself the experience of it.

33:30.830 --> 33:39.155
He just got so stunned and after that whatever he talked to me, he never published it.

33:39.997 --> 33:44.820
So what I am saying  that if the people reach the Truth

33:45.214 --> 33:50.319
and they know this is the Truth, nothing can change them.

33:50.506 --> 33:53.226
If they have reached the Truth, I am saying.

33:53.329 --> 33:59.399
You can see in the life of all the great people that they think “This is the Truth”.

33:59.572 --> 34:08.012
Not by just reading, not by just believing but as an experience,

34:08.432 --> 34:13.303
that, on their central nervous system they can feel the Truth.

34:13.680 --> 34:18.864
Then it is impossible to change them.

34:19.374 --> 34:26.054
Like you can see a seed becomes a tree, then you cannot make the tree into a seed.

34:26.308 --> 34:31.902
Seed is a seed, but when the seed changes into the tree

34:32.108 --> 34:35.193
then you cannot bring it back to the seed.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.401
It may create more seeds, that’s different.

34:38.842 --> 34:43.162
so, in the same way, once you have got your Realisation,

34:43.297 --> 34:46.408
and once you have become one with the Divine,

34:46.781 --> 34:51.621
then there is no question of you going down, unless and until you,

34:51.714 --> 34:53.764
yourself, want to go down.

34:55.570 --> 35:00.666
It’s very very remarkable, how you get this property,

35:00.817 --> 35:05.526
how you get this ability and this capability,

35:05.684 --> 35:09.171
and after that you don’t lose it!

35:09.477 --> 35:15.017
Of course, first you must grow, and for that you have to meditate.

35:15.655 --> 35:21.553
But this meditation, once you do it, the whole

35:21.783 --> 35:28.718
being itself gets so enlightened and so beautiful that you don’t want to change it.

35:28.924 --> 35:32.524
You want to be there and enjoy it forever.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.782
But of course you want to give it to others

35:35.925 --> 35:38.776
because you see  you are enjoying so much.

35:38.866 --> 35:41.781
Like, on the street, you find somebody

35:41.900 --> 35:46.131
starving and you are very full, then you feel like giving food to that person.

35:46.290 --> 35:51.462
In the same way, you see in this world, people are madly seeking, running up and down,

35:51.561 --> 35:54.552
doing all kinds of things, so you want to tell them.

35:54.631 --> 35:56.832
They may or may not believe.

35:56.958 --> 36:06.978
They may try to absolutely deny you, defy you.

36:07.152 --> 36:08.972
They can do anything.

36:09.036 --> 36:14.511
But you know for definite that you are on the right path, you are on the

36:14.749 --> 36:20.564
right state of mind which is a Sahaja state.

36:21.008 --> 36:26.039
In Sanskrit it is called ‘sahaja avastha’, ‘sahajavastha’.

36:26.205 --> 36:31.749
In sahajavastha you do not react, you do not react.

36:32.144 --> 36:33.724
You just see and appreciate.

36:33.873 --> 36:38.778
Now see: I came, I saw this beautiful, such an idea of Sahastrara,

36:38.865 --> 36:44.487
all the chakras, they have crossed over, gone up there and from there they have.

36:44.631 --> 36:46.891
Very good expression.

36:48.407 --> 36:54.987
But any other person would say, “Oh, this colour combination is not good!”

36:56.826 --> 36:58.709
“Why did they use this?

36:58.931 --> 37:00.982
Why don’t they use something else?”

37:00.998 --> 37:04.923
Like that, you see, finding faults with others!

37:06.355 --> 37:13.335
And this finding faults actually comes from your brain which is not yet enlightened.

37:13.454 --> 37:17.189
You cannot enjoy anything because you react.

37:17.308 --> 37:19.198
All the time you go on reacting.

37:19.389 --> 37:23.242
If somebody says something nice, still you are reacting.

37:23.496 --> 37:27.778
If someone says something bad, of course you are reacting!

37:28.113 --> 37:29.583
No question!

37:30.464 --> 37:39.082
So for us to understand that
we are not free to react, we are not that cheap to react.

37:41.567 --> 37:44.758
We are on a very high pedestal.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.180
What is our job Is to enjoy?

37:48.482 --> 37:50.770
Enjoy everything.

37:51.365 --> 37:58.263
And that enjoyment is the blessing of the Divine.

37:59.277 --> 38:04.818
Even you can enjoy the turmoil and the torture.

38:05.136 --> 38:09.238
Everything you can enjoy if you see the point that:

38:09.397 --> 38:14.426
nothing can happen to your Spirit, which is the real light.

38:14.713 --> 38:21.821
Whatever you may suffer, whatever you may think is troubling you –

38:21.980 --> 38:27.466
actually this silent light of the Spirit

38:27.513 --> 38:35.651
makes you absolutely, perfectly joyous and you give joy to others.

38:36.183 --> 38:39.634
You don’t design it, you don’t plan it,

38:39.745 --> 38:43.568
how to give joy, but you just automatically give joy.

38:44.337 --> 38:52.782
And this giving joy is also effortless, sahaj, because you are in the sahaja state.

38:53.112 --> 39:01.692
In the sahaja state you just see things.

39:02.842 --> 39:05.130
It’s a drama, you feel.

39:05.273 --> 39:11.508
It’s a different styles, different types and you just see and watch,

39:11.963 --> 39:16.341
and get the joy out of it.

39:17.413 --> 39:22.233
It is not important to say, “I like this, I like that." No!

39:23.702 --> 39:28.172
That ‘I’, which likes, is nothing but ego,

39:28.331 --> 39:36.836
and keeps you out of the enjoyment which is reality, which is real.

39:37.001 --> 39:44.157
Every thing in this world, that you find is troublesome,

39:44.400 --> 39:52.470
if you see  from another angle, from a sahajasthiti,
you won’t feel the troubles.

39:53.502 --> 39:56.827
But that higher life should be there.

39:57.032 --> 40:01.567
That higher standard should be built-in within you.

40:02.337 --> 40:07.059
The other day I had a meeting with the bureaucrats

40:07.480 --> 40:10.591
and I told them, “I know that the pay is less.

40:10.869 --> 40:16.804
You may think that the others get much more pay, they are having much more facilities.

40:17.209 --> 40:21.727
But there is one way you can really enjoy your work:

40:21.902 --> 40:25.655
if you have patriotism, deshabhakti."

40:25.809 --> 40:32.759
If you have patriotism for your country, no amount of sacrifice

40:33.424 --> 40:37.053
will satisfy you. You’ll want to give everything.

40:37.261 --> 40:44.217
And you can go through all kinds of so-called dearth and depressive states

40:44.423 --> 40:47.453
without even feeling anything about it.

40:48.359 --> 40:53.536
And, at the same time, your feelings become very deep.

40:54.409 --> 41:02.360
For example, you are travelling and suddenly you find somebody who is sick:

41:02.612 --> 41:07.344
you can feel it on your vibrations that this person is sick;

41:07.531 --> 41:12.856
and immediately your sympathy and your love flows to that person.

41:13.049 --> 41:14.658
You will try to help that person.

41:14.997 --> 41:18.555
If possible you will try to even cure that person.

41:18.877 --> 41:23.824
Just like that, your whole being becomes like an ocean

41:23.928 --> 41:28.326
which absorbs all the rivers and

41:28.440 --> 41:36.532
all kinds of watery things, whatever it is, within its abdomen, I should say.

41:36.786 --> 41:43.369
It just takes all that is there,

41:43.560 --> 41:47.665
but it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t trouble him.

41:48.177 --> 41:53.590
He is like over-powering person, with his love.

41:54.044 --> 41:55.864
He doesn’t show his power.

41:55.999 --> 41:59.073
He does not bother about his self-importance.

41:59.192 --> 42:04.433
If somebody tries to insult you, “Alright."

42:05.259 --> 42:08.131
What is there there, the insult part of it?

42:08.300 --> 42:12.296
And such people who have reached that sahajavastha

42:12.423 --> 42:17.066
are the greatest creators of art, of music,

42:17.629 --> 42:22.859
of great thoughts and that’s why these survive.

42:23.010 --> 42:27.689
So many people write, but it goes out.

42:27.802 --> 42:31.735
So many people create, but nobody bothers.

42:32.012 --> 42:37.113
But those who are Realised-souls, whatever they create, is of eternal nature.

42:37.406 --> 42:42.031
Because they are now in the Ocean of Eternity.

42:42.531 --> 42:47.224
They are in the ocean of purity,

42:47.382 --> 42:54.801
where there is no idea at all, of hurting anyone or troubling anyone.

42:56.015 --> 42:58.415
Such a protection is there for them.

42:59.029 --> 43:01.705
They cannot be harmed!

43:01.951 --> 43:06.234
Because after all you have entered into the kingdom of God,

43:06.552 --> 43:10.660
so who can dare harm you or trouble you?

43:11.152 --> 43:20.969
Such a prosperity I have seen among Sahaja Yogis,
and such a generosity that they have,

43:21.461 --> 43:24.761
and such understanding about things.

43:25.031 --> 43:29.849
I don’t have to give lectures, “Now don’t do this and don’t do that!”

43:29.914 --> 43:31.624
No, no more.

43:33.052 --> 43:44.138
And those who are not yet already matured in Sahaja Yoga should try to mature.

43:44.570 --> 43:50.446
And those who are not matured and troubling, don’t worry about them.

43:50.558 --> 43:52.671
You should have pity.

43:52.782 --> 43:57.636
You should really have pity for such people that they are so immature.

43:58.255 --> 44:03.340
Today it is something great, I feel, because thirty years I have been

44:03.483 --> 44:10.180
running up and down everywhere and I have been able to gather so many people.

44:10.577 --> 44:16.408
There are so many Sahaja Yogis, you see, and also, all over the world.

44:16.805 --> 44:19.199
This is just a wee-bit of that.

44:19.389 --> 44:25.760
So this is something  was to happen, has been already described,

44:26.141 --> 44:31.101
has been prophesised by people that such and such thing will be happen,

44:31.355 --> 44:35.619
that so many people will get their Self-realisation.

44:35.959 --> 44:40.786
Unbelievable it was, of course, but, as now you see,

44:41.058 --> 44:46.556
how sweet is the feeling that we are all one.

44:46.951 --> 44:53.884
There’s no quarrel, no fight, no bad ideas, and nobody likes cheap things.

44:54.489 --> 45:03.615
They want to have something that is pleasing and has a quality of understanding.

45:05.525 --> 45:10.015
And I have seen people becoming poets, writing beautiful poetry.

45:10.396 --> 45:13.224
I have seen people becoming orators.

45:13.415 --> 45:20.486
Also I have seen people becoming very good organisers.

45:21.079 --> 45:27.119
But one thing is very important, is the humility.

45:27.540 --> 45:34.024
I said in the beginning and again I would say: what will appeal to people is your humility.

45:34.627 --> 45:40.572
You should be a humble person, not think that you are something special,

45:40.762 --> 45:53.327
or not think that you are some sort of a self-important person.

45:53.966 --> 46:00.336
Once you think that you are important then you are not part and parcel of the whole.

46:00.502 --> 46:06.526
If my one hand starts thinking, “I am important,” it’s stupid.

46:06.820 --> 46:08.855
How can one hand be important?

46:09.045 --> 46:11.095
All hands are needed.

46:11.289 --> 46:13.057
Everything is needed.

46:13.155 --> 46:14.615
Legs are needed.

46:14.721 --> 46:17.512
How can one part be so important?

46:17.745 --> 46:23.798
If you start thinking like that anywhere in your journey of Sahaja Yoga,

46:23.869 --> 46:27.003
then I must say, you are not in the sahajavastha.

46:27.202 --> 46:36.231
So my own effort was to take you into that beautiful arena of Sahaja,

46:36.694 --> 46:41.916
where you will be absolutely one with your Self,

46:42.004 --> 46:46.379
one with the nature, one with all the people

46:46.530 --> 46:51.652
who are around you, with your own country, and countries.

46:51.985 --> 46:57.500
Everywhere, the whole atmosphere, as they say, the whole Brahmanda (universe)

46:57.749 --> 47:03.059
becomes part and parcel of you, and you are not separated from that.

47:03.249 --> 47:13.750
Then the echoes – they call ‘ninaad’

47:13.980 --> 47:20.223
the echoes of your being, of your life can be easily seen.

47:20.644 --> 47:26.715
Not in material advancement or in any other kind of a thing

47:26.905 --> 47:32.410
but in the spiritual area, which is the highest.

47:33.473 --> 47:38.783
Everywhere, in every country, there have been people of that quality

47:38.950 --> 47:42.531
and, till today, they are all remembered.

47:42.722 --> 47:51.056
In the same way you all will be representing a very great knowledge

47:51.260 --> 47:58.305
about Reality: in your life, in your creation or in your working.

47:58.425 --> 48:03.495
In every way you can do anything.

48:03.749 --> 48:08.102
Now, only thing that, now, we have to do is to decide:

48:08.205 --> 48:11.343
how many people we are going to give Realisation?

48:11.660 --> 48:13.570
What we can do for Realisation?

48:14.201 --> 48:15.777
What should we do?

48:16.023 --> 48:21.965
This is the only thing, if you go on with your

48:22.219 --> 48:34.547
complete emancipation, you will be surprised, it’s like climbing up a big mountain.

48:35.643 --> 48:39.502
But when you have reached to the peak, you can see everything very well,

48:39.621 --> 48:42.981
and you feel so satisfied that you are at the peak.

48:43.591 --> 48:48.750
So, that climbing part, even  some of you have to do it,

48:48.988 --> 48:52.720
it is alright, there’s no problem, you can do it.

48:52.828 --> 48:56.455
You must have respect for yourself, love yourself,

48:56.521 --> 49:01.480
and  understanding that you have to reach the peak, peak of the mountain.

49:01.592 --> 49:05.465
And once you have reached the peak of the mountain you will know you are there.

49:05.748 --> 49:09.868
And then you start showering all your love,

49:10.058 --> 49:14.484
affection, and everything, that flows down the mountain.

49:14.578 --> 49:16.568
That is the life for you.

49:16.778 --> 49:19.446
It’s the greatest type of life.

49:19.555 --> 49:25.914
Forget all other people: politicians and all other people who were supposed to be great.

49:25.996 --> 49:27.226
Forget them!

49:27.313 --> 49:29.730
You are much higher than that,

49:30.239 --> 49:40.007
because you are already chiselled like a diamond with the Sahaj style of life;

49:40.499 --> 49:48.638
which is very satisfying and also which is very much absolutely peace giving.

49:48.904 --> 49:52.334
It gives you joy, it gives you peace,

49:52.456 --> 49:57.609
it gives you capabilities, it gives you so many things that you cannot count,

49:57.903 --> 50:02.623
like the thousand petals of your Sahastrara which are enlightened.

50:02.741 --> 50:06.651
God knows what all you can have with this!

50:06.912 --> 50:12.990
This is such a tremendous area you are in – the thousand petals.

50:13.278 --> 50:17.679
And from there, people have gained all the knowledge about science,

50:17.774 --> 50:21.855
knowledge about all the great discoveries are from there.

50:22.188 --> 50:27.601
So this is what one has to realise one’s own esteem.

50:27.753 --> 50:33.725
Self-esteem is different form self-importance.

50:34.078 --> 50:36.200
You should have self-esteem.

50:36.354 --> 50:38.729
With that you will become humble.

50:39.875 --> 50:44.944
You will become very loving because you are capable of love.

50:45.267 --> 50:47.986
And it is not forced on you.

50:48.480 --> 50:54.749
I agree that from the ocean the clouds rise

50:54.964 --> 50:57.101
and then they give rain and all that,

50:57.203 --> 51:01.218
but it is in the cycle of life  they are doing it.

51:01.486 --> 51:04.967
They are not conscious of it.

51:05.310 --> 51:10.170
They don’t think that they are doing something great because they are in the cycle.

51:10.366 --> 51:13.994
You are out of the cycle and still you are doing

51:14.280 --> 51:20.126
work without any feeling of self-importance.

51:20.840 --> 51:23.629
You are doing because you have to do it!

51:23.831 --> 51:30.342
Another cycle, not the natural cycle, but another cycle of awareness,

51:30.469 --> 51:33.432
where you are aware as to what you are doing.

51:33.567 --> 51:39.836
At the same time you are very humble, you are very loving, you are very kind.

51:40.676 --> 51:43.917
You don’t shout, you don’t beat anyone.

51:44.390 --> 51:47.280
You don’t say anything harsh to anyone.

51:47.358 --> 51:51.815
And you can manage the most difficult person.

51:51.955 --> 51:56.077
If someone tries to be funny, you can always raise the Kundalini

51:56.268 --> 51:58.464
and be satisfied with it.

51:58.607 --> 52:03.977
If you secretly raise the Kundalini, the other person is finished!

52:04.207 --> 52:07.119
If you cannot raise it, then forget it!

52:07.409 --> 52:10.910
Forget it! He is a difficult person, you know, it’s a stone.

52:11.061 --> 52:13.318
Now in the stone, what can you do?

52:13.424 --> 52:23.588
You cannot make it flow, the love and the dignity, all these qualities.

52:23.787 --> 52:29.237
It is not possible from a stone-hearted person, so forget it, that’s not your job.

52:29.684 --> 52:31.455
That’s not your job at all.

52:31.567 --> 52:38.389
So, I would request that, first of all, you should see that: how much humble we are.

52:38.732 --> 52:45.892
You have to be very humble and that is your decoration, that is your beauty.

52:46.335 --> 52:53.588
So you have your love, which is pure, without any lust or greed.

52:53.780 --> 52:59.902
You love others only because you are in love.

53:00.612 --> 53:05.691
And then, secondly, you are blessed with peace,

53:05.858 --> 53:09.921
you are absolutely at peace with yourself.

53:10.070 --> 53:13.864
And you will be amazed – with peace, wisdom will come to you.

53:14.292 --> 53:18.687
You will be regarded as the wisest man, wisest woman,

53:18.799 --> 53:21.492
because you are at peace with yourself.

53:21.694 --> 53:26.332
Only in peace you can discover the Truth,

53:26.475 --> 53:30.769
you can discover every solution that you want to.

53:31.673 --> 53:39.492
You become  very wise and sensible person – outstandingly great than others.

53:39.844 --> 53:42.846
You are not like common, general, people.

53:43.383 --> 53:47.050
Then you have joy.

53:47.206 --> 53:53.024
Joy is something I cannot express in words but still

53:53.124 --> 53:57.366
joy, as I have told you many a times, it is singular.

53:57.532 --> 54:01.645
It is not happiness or unhappiness, it is just joy.

54:01.876 --> 54:03.633
Just you enjoy.

54:03.968 --> 54:10.910
You enjoy everything, enjoy every company, every incident,

54:11.021 --> 54:15.382
every scene, every happening in your life.

54:15.469 --> 54:17.963
You know how to enjoy everything.

54:18.902 --> 54:22.119
You see, just joy has a great capacity.

54:22.590 --> 54:27.040
Once, I remember I had gone with my son-in-law and daughter

54:27.159 --> 54:31.333
to see some historical place and we had to climb a lot.

54:31.859 --> 54:36.706
We were climbing for about three hours, so, naturally, we all got tired

54:36.983 --> 54:41.419
and there was a little resting place, made of marble,

54:41.578 --> 54:45.245
so we said, “Let us spread out ourselves here!”

54:45.530 --> 54:48.950
So when I spread it out, they were so much

54:49.077 --> 54:54.350
saying, “Why should we have come here, of all the things"
All that they were grudging.

54:54.508 --> 55:01.904
Then suddenly, you know – this is the joy point –
suddenly I saw the carvings of elephants.

55:02.234 --> 55:04.886
So I said, “Can you see these elephants?

55:05.040 --> 55:08.986
Everybody’s tail is differently made!”

55:10.057 --> 55:15.079
They said, “Mummy, how could you see the elephants’ tails?

55:15.198 --> 55:17.511
We are so tired!”

55:17.590 --> 55:20.172
I said, “You also see! Just see that."

55:20.342 --> 55:27.372
Because this joy, it shifts, shifts your mind from nonsense.

55:27.926 --> 55:30.272
You just say, “It’s all nonsense."

55:30.328 --> 55:32.130
You just shift your mind.

55:32.193 --> 55:33.989
This is the way you get joy!

55:34.060 --> 55:36.785
And goes to the thing that will  joy giving.

55:36.864 --> 55:40.792
Supposing there is a person who is quite boring,

55:40.911 --> 55:45.095
you know, then what happens, you just see the

55:45.262 --> 55:50.738
humour behind boring: how a person bores you!

55:52.870 --> 56:02.290
And what you learn out of it is – never bore anyone.

56:04.488 --> 56:14.665
So this joy has a speciality, that it teaches you the essence of joy of everything.

56:15.025 --> 56:23.325
If it is a bad film, still you enjoy because you see how bad it is.

56:23.892 --> 56:28.627
Supposing, of course if it is a good film, then you can always see them!

56:29.087 --> 56:35.116
But you do not go with a mind, how to criticise.

56:35.393 --> 56:38.933
This criticism business goes out of your mind.

56:39.035 --> 56:43.144
So what happens  your mind shifts immediately

56:43.279 --> 56:48.716
from something that is ridiculous to something interesting in the same thing.

56:49.048 --> 56:54.027
So you don’t criticise and you don’t feel bad about it.

56:54.411 --> 57:02.591
Sometimes it so happens that people are amazed that how I tolerate such people.

57:02.900 --> 57:08.040
But I don’t tolerate, I am not paying any attention, whatever the person may be doing.

57:08.254 --> 57:15.272
If you are of that nature, that we can call as a condition

57:15.530 --> 57:21.470
where you are absolutely in the Turya state:

57:21.701 --> 57:25.185
so Kabira has said, “Jab mast hue, fir kya bole?”

57:25.312 --> 57:30.230
When I have gone into that state of joy, why should I say anything?

57:30.906 --> 57:37.967
It is like that: a temperament which you have to understand, and respect it.

57:38.136 --> 57:40.336
That is within you, but respect it.

57:40.470 --> 57:44.857
Do not compare it with others, others are not at your level.

57:44.966 --> 57:49.195
So you are at a different level and you just try to enjoy.

57:49.400 --> 57:53.787
Never feel that you are something higher or greater – no, never feel .

57:53.968 --> 58:01.288
What you should feel  that thankfulness that you are not mixed up with

58:01.671 --> 58:07.303
all those funny ideas and funny style of life

58:07.383 --> 58:10.218
where you go on criticising – “This is not good!
I don’t like it!

58:10.329 --> 58:11.730
I don’t like it!”

58:13.272 --> 58:15.747
Who are you?You don’t know yourself.

58:15.858 --> 58:18.998
When you say, “I don’t like it,” you are not knowing yourself.

58:19.323 --> 58:22.595
How do you know what you don’t like?

58:22.794 --> 58:28.375
I have seen people with very poor knowledge,

58:28.692 --> 58:35.610
who are just knowing  little bit here and there, are very critical of others.

58:35.888 --> 58:38.470
I don’t know the reason, why it is so.

58:38.563 --> 58:41.733
But maybe that they think no end of themselves!

58:42.544 --> 58:45.033
But this is what is very common.

58:45.247 --> 58:51.191
But if you know the Absolute Knowledge, then you become really humble;

58:51.358 --> 58:57.648
absolutely humble and sweet, gentle and kind.

58:58.663 --> 59:03.846
So today is a great day otherwise, for me also: I didn’t know

59:03.917 --> 59:08.382
that I will survive so many years to see this beautiful day.

59:08.819 --> 59:15.349
Because after all, it was very hard life, according to others’ standards.

59:15.627 --> 59:23.432
But what is most joy giving to me was creating Sahaja Yogis,

59:23.837 --> 59:28.040
and listening to them and talking to them,

59:28.326 --> 59:34.551
the way they were so sweet and so kind and so respectful!

59:34.963 --> 59:39.834
All this has helped me so much and I must thank you for that.

59:40.064 --> 59:47.103
With your support, with your help, with your understanding, I could achieve it.

59:47.531 --> 59:54.501
If I could have achieve it on my own, I would never have asked for this help of yours.

59:54.712 --> 59:59.383
But you are just like my hands, you are just like my eyes.

59:59.487 --> 01:00:03.394
And I need you very much because, without you I cannot do it.

01:00:03.479 --> 01:00:07.090
It’s like channelising: unless and until you have channels,

01:00:07.233 --> 01:00:10.396
what’s the use of being Adi Shakti or anything?

01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:12.126
How will you channelise it?

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:21.171
If there is electrical movement, you need channels, otherwise its a static thing.

01:00:21.556 --> 01:00:27.227
In the same way I felt, always, that I needed more and more channels,

01:00:27.346 --> 01:00:33.058
and when it worked out, I was really, really in a very great Spirit.

01:00:33.252 --> 01:00:38.785
So I thank you very much, again, for this day that has come.

01:00:39.047 --> 01:00:44.187
And I bless you from my heart that – now you take over responsibility.

01:00:44.385 --> 01:00:49.029
You are a Sahaja Yogi, so you have a responsibility, also,

01:00:49.108 --> 01:00:52.538
to give Realisation to others. Don’t keep to yourself.

01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:54.906
This has to be given to others.

01:00:55.089 --> 01:00:58.261
And you can explain, you can talk to them,

01:00:58.373 --> 01:01:01.063
you can really, very well, understand them.

01:01:01.263 --> 01:01:05.883
Try to understand them and talk to them.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.725
And you must give Realisation to others, otherwise you won’t feel complete.

01:01:12.052 --> 01:01:14.702
To feel complete, you have to do that.

01:01:14.948 --> 01:01:16.824
May God bless you all.
