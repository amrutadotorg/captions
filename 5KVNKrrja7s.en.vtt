Sahastrara Puja
Cabella Ligure 7.5.2000

00:10:04.793 --> 00:10:20.169
Thirty years back, when Sahastrara was opened,

00:10:20.844 --> 00:10:24.955
I found darkness all over.

00:10:25.239 --> 00:10:29.220
People were so ignorant.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:36.264
They had no awareness  what they have to find.

00:10:36.466 --> 00:10:45.717
Of course, I found they wanted to find something that was unknown,

00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:52.311
but they did not know what was unknown, what they have to find.

00:10:53.096 --> 00:10:59.647
And they were extremely ignorant people, about themselves,

00:10:59.863 --> 00:11:07.032
and about their surroundings, and about the aim of their life.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:16.201
I didn’t know how to start the topic with them.

00:11:17.102 --> 00:11:28.538
When the Sahastrara was opened, I thought of trying

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:38.877
Self-realisation only on one lady: she was an old lady.

00:11:39.107 --> 00:11:45.107
And there was another lady who also started to come up.

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:56.114
This old lady got her Realisation, and then the another lady who was much younger

00:11:56.941 --> 00:12:03.592
she told me that she gets fits and she gets possessed.

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:08.691
“Oh my God!” I said, “how will I give her Realisation?”

00:12:09.109 --> 00:12:17.499
But somehow she got cured very fast and she also got her Realisation.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:21.482
It’s a very unknown knowledge.

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:27.305
Also, human beings, in their ego, do not want to accept

00:12:27.669 --> 00:12:35.098
that they are not yet complete, that they have to have their Realisation.

00:12:35.693 --> 00:12:45.685
Also their style of life was such that they had no time for themselves.

00:12:47.256 --> 00:12:56.212
I found it very difficult to convince people that you must take your Self-realisation,

00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:01.954
because they thought it is something imaginary,

00:13:02.074 --> 00:13:07.415
it is very far-fetched, and they only believed in ‘gurus’

00:13:07.581 --> 00:13:14.526
who would say alright, “Do this much of rituals, karmakand."

00:13:14.673 --> 00:13:16.323
That’s all!

00:13:16.433 --> 00:13:20.035
And they were doing all kinds of rituals

00:13:20.218 --> 00:13:24.130
with the ‘kind’ guidance of their gurus,

00:13:24.618 --> 00:13:29.283
without knowing that you have to first know yourself,

00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:37.210
which is said by all the great incarnations, all the saints – clearly!

00:13:38.622 --> 00:13:45.908
It is not that it was only my idea that people should get their Self-realisation

00:13:46.174 --> 00:13:50.258
but it was the idea of all those people.

00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:56.510
They said, one after another, for centuries, that “Seek yourself."

00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:59.268
Even Christ said “Know thyself”.

00:13:59.355 --> 00:14:03.811
Mohammed Saheb said the same, Nanak Saheb said the same.

00:14:03.914 --> 00:14:09.451
But nobody tried to know that these rituals are not

00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:14.073
the end of life, they will not serve the purpose,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.699
and that you have to have Realisation.

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:25.645
So those two ladies, only, got Self-realisation,

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:30.747
and with that I thought, “Let’s go to the seashore."

00:14:31.239 --> 00:14:36.338
And about thirty people came with me.

00:14:37.766 --> 00:14:44.171
And they were talking in a very funny manner as to:

00:14:44.354 --> 00:14:50.020
How they can get Self-realisation?
They don’t deserve it.

00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:55.416
They have not been very good people.

00:14:55.473 --> 00:14:58.479
All kinds of things: condemning themselves!

00:14:59.558 --> 00:15:04.584
And in that lot I got about twelve people, altogether,

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:10.968
inclusive of these two ladies who got Realisation [before].

00:15:13.703 --> 00:15:28.412
This is a sign that the movement of knowing yourself is very, very slow,

00:15:30.027 --> 00:15:36.426
and people don’t understand why they should know themselves.

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:43.234
I was quite disappointed, because nobody understood me.

00:15:44.572 --> 00:15:49.441
But one day it so happened that, in one of the programmes,

00:15:49.846 --> 00:15:54.512
one lady came: she was possessed,

00:15:55.137 --> 00:15:59.597
and she started talking in Sanskrit language.

00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:05.980
She was just a maid-servant, and everybody was surprised

00:16:06.347 --> 00:16:10.412
and she said, “You don’t know who she is!”

00:16:10.861 --> 00:16:18.414
And then she started describing me from the Saundarya Lahari.

00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:22.287
I was wondering, “What’s the matter with this lady?”

00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:26.426
Like a man she spoke. Her voice was like a man.

00:16:26.662 --> 00:16:29.807
People may believe it or not. But she was very possessed.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.778
And then they started asking her.

00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:39.317
And then they came and asked me, “Mother, what she is saying – is it true?”

00:16:39.817 --> 00:16:42.382
I said, “You should find out yourself."

00:16:42.546 --> 00:16:48.580
Because  those days people were such that if you tell them anything like that,

00:16:48.751 --> 00:16:51.175
they would turn their faces.

00:16:51.305 --> 00:16:57.455
Only the kind of false gurus who would say “Alright, you give me five rupees."

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.389
They would be very happy that, “You can purchase the guru!

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:03.098
Now you don’t have to bother about anything.

00:17:03.967 --> 00:17:07.800
You don’t have to do anything."

00:17:09.714 --> 00:17:16.168
So, with that, gradually, it started working out.

00:17:16.395 --> 00:17:21.168
And I remember that these people who got their Realisation

00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:26.261
asked me, “Mother you allow us to do Durga puja."

00:17:26.698 --> 00:17:31.724
Durga puja was regarded as something, a very difficult thing.

00:17:32.173 --> 00:17:38.862
And Brahmins were normally not ready to do it,
because they were not Realised-souls,

00:17:39.045 --> 00:17:46.747
so they used to get into fits and into all kinds of problems.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.054
So they called the Brahmins, seven of them,

00:17:50.182 --> 00:17:53.126
and told them, “You just don’t worry.

00:17:53.295 --> 00:17:58.194
Nothing will happen to you, because now you are facing the Reality.

00:17:58.324 --> 00:18:01.939
It’s not some sort of a...

00:18:03.247 --> 00:18:06.827
murti  puja or anything. It’s a human being."

00:18:07.049 --> 00:18:09.526
They were quite frightened. They came down.

00:18:09.831 --> 00:18:13.680
But something happened to them: with a great

00:18:13.807 --> 00:18:17.852
confidence they started all the mantras, everything,

00:18:18.106 --> 00:18:20.988
and the vibrations started flowing everywhere.

00:18:22.807 --> 00:18:29.052
Even, we were very close to the sea, I found  the sea was roaring.

00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:33.860
But people didn’t understand.

00:18:34.299 --> 00:18:37.531
Except for these seven people, they said, “Nothing happened to us,

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:39.829
we dideverything so well!”

00:18:40.558 --> 00:18:44.728
I think that was the first miracle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:46.253 --> 00:18:49.957
You see, the trouble with human mind at this level,

00:18:50.045 --> 00:18:55.794
or at this time, is that they have too much of self-importance,

00:18:56.761 --> 00:19:00.038
and they think no end of themselves.

00:19:00.607 --> 00:19:03.194
So already they think, “We are great!

00:19:03.249 --> 00:19:07.598
What is there to know ourselves?
We know ourselves very well."

00:19:08.411 --> 00:19:16.192
So the basic seeking power is humility.

00:19:16.838 --> 00:19:24.289
If you think you know everything, you cannot humble down, and you cannot seek.

00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:30.218
Even if you seek, they don’t want to follow anybody’s path.

00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:31.776
They say, “We have our own path.

00:19:31.871 --> 00:19:33.808
We will follow our own path.

00:19:33.988 --> 00:19:36.438
We’ll do whatever we want to do!”

00:19:36.763 --> 00:19:42.621
And, like this, I faced many people, in different countries,

00:19:42.978 --> 00:19:46.926
who just came to listen to my lecture, that’s all,

00:19:47.609 --> 00:19:50.323
but they wouldn’t take Realisation.

00:19:50.808 --> 00:19:57.612
And some of them did take their Realisation, they got it, but they got it lost.

00:19:59.007 --> 00:20:05.207
Somehow this was such a funny story for me

00:20:05.445 --> 00:20:08.548
that: I am giving them Realisation,

00:20:08.718 --> 00:20:11.185
I am taking no money for it, nothing.

00:20:11.288 --> 00:20:13.971
I used to travel on my own.

00:20:14.155 --> 00:20:18.875
But despite that, why is it, that the people

00:20:19.193 --> 00:20:22.970
don’t realise the value of Self-realisation?

00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:29.988
Then a gentle man who got Realisation, in the first lot,

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:37.693
he told me, “Today, is a consumer society, as they call it, whatever it is."

00:20:38.249 --> 00:20:43.379
That, “Unless and until you take money from them, they will never value it.

00:20:43.728 --> 00:20:48.441
Let them feel that we have paid for it, for our Realisation.

00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.240
So at the gate only, you should keep somebody to take money,

00:20:51.288 --> 00:20:54.054
otherwise they don’t take to it."

00:20:54.942 --> 00:20:58.135
I said, “But you cannot sell it – it’s falsehood.

00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:02.530
You cannot sell Self-realisation to people."

00:21:03.711 --> 00:21:07.122
He said, “Then, you see, you won’t be successful."

00:21:07.773 --> 00:21:13.597
With other gurus this is main thing is that they just accept

00:21:13.946 --> 00:21:17.045
the money and even they tell people, “Bring so much money!

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.839
Do this much. There is a fees.

00:21:20.383 --> 00:21:27.462
And that’s how only the ego is satisfied and people take to false people.

00:21:29.716 --> 00:21:34.265
This falsehood, they may realise later on,

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:40.243
because they suffer a lot, with all kinds of physical,  mental problems,

00:21:40.576 --> 00:21:44.601
but by that time they are gone cases.

00:21:46.077 --> 00:21:52.479
Now the Sahastrara has not been yet described in any one of the books.

00:21:52.836 --> 00:21:57.357
Though they have talked about it, in our ancient books, in India also.

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:59.855
They have talked about Sahastrara

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:04.754
but nobody has described it except that it has one thousand petals.

00:22:06.722 --> 00:22:10.961
At least if they had mentioned something about it,

00:22:11.183 --> 00:22:15.798
it would have been easier for me to show that, “See, this is written in the book."

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.239
Because people are like that!

00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:23.822
It has to be written in some book and that only they accept.

00:22:24.644 --> 00:22:26.943
It’s a very difficult situation!

00:22:27.236 --> 00:22:30.946
Because nobody had given a collective Realisation,

00:22:31.238 --> 00:22:34.690
so nobody had written to that extent, except for

00:22:34.834 --> 00:22:38.476
one or two people who wrote clearly about Kundalini.

00:22:39.007 --> 00:22:42.936
But I wouldn’t say it was so clear, because it was all in poetry.

00:22:43.099 --> 00:22:48.807
So people would sing the songs, but they would not understand.

00:22:50.461 --> 00:22:55.570
But I was thinking, “How these people who were lost,

00:22:56.018 --> 00:23:02.288
here and there under some sort of a seeking, what will happen to them?

00:23:03.143 --> 00:23:08.799
And how will I be able to give them Self-realisation?”

00:23:11.548 --> 00:23:19.719
Experiences were so horrid, but doesn’t matter.

00:23:20.434 --> 00:23:26.835
I went on and on and on, and I worked it out.

00:23:27.294 --> 00:23:35.200
Of course, we met some people who were also very cruel and nasty,

00:23:35.708 --> 00:23:40.528
who troubled me and troubled Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:41.654 --> 00:23:52.403
All these things should have really dampened my enthusiasm.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:58.826
But on the contrary I started thinking, “Why?
Why people are like this?”

00:23:59.795 --> 00:24:09.458
Then I realised one thing: that we cannot have the whole world to get Self-realisation.

00:24:10.498 --> 00:24:14.280
This is the Last Judgment.

00:24:14.637 --> 00:24:21.677
At this time people have to decide what is the most important thing.

00:24:22.703 --> 00:24:30.002
They have to know themselves and understand what they have got.

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:42.888
It’s not just having a big number that will help us, but really solid Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:45.331 --> 00:24:53.179
Then I found there were people who got cured of many diseases

00:24:53.737 --> 00:24:57.197
but most of them got lost.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.052
Some of them, who were drug addicts, gave up drug-addiction.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.494
Drinking, they gave up.
Smoking they gave up.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.140
I never said a word, that, “You give up this or give up that."

00:25:10.247 --> 00:25:15.732
I knew, once the Kundalini rises, they will automatically give up.

00:25:16.387 --> 00:25:18.142
And it happened.

00:25:18.254 --> 00:25:26.089
And that’s how people became so clean, so beautiful, and started enjoying their life.

00:25:26.765 --> 00:25:29.116
But nobody would believe them.

00:25:30.163 --> 00:25:35.597
When they went round and talked to people, they said, “Oh, you have gone mad!”

00:25:35.739 --> 00:25:40.768
They couldn’t believe how they have stopped drinking, how they are not smoking.

00:25:40.871 --> 00:25:44.080
They said, “We want to drink! And what is this?”

00:25:44.727 --> 00:25:52.560
So, the identification, I found, of these people were mostly

00:25:52.758 --> 00:25:58.632
with the very loose type of enjoyment.

00:25:59.411 --> 00:26:06.399
They enjoyed very loose type of things, which had nothing to do with the Spirit.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.989
Gradually, of course, it started working out.

00:26:12.556 --> 00:26:23.187
But still, I must say, that we can’t expect, in this Kali Yuga,

00:26:23.902 --> 00:26:30.193
to have billions and billions of people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:30.486 --> 00:26:37.161
Though it’s my desire, it’s your desire, and you want them to get their Self-realisation,

00:26:37.875 --> 00:26:41.770
by which so many good things can happen.

00:26:41.982 --> 00:26:47.966
Firstly, your physical self improves.

00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:52.256
Many people have been cured.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.300
Christ cured only twenty one people.

00:26:56.267 --> 00:27:03.349
But I don’t know how many thousands have been cured with Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:13.252
Also there’s another very big problem with human beings:

00:27:14.196 --> 00:27:22.635
that they read all kinds of books,

00:27:22.929 --> 00:27:28.389
and they have no clear-cut idea as to what they should find,

00:27:29.804 --> 00:27:31.685
what is their seeking.

00:27:33.666 --> 00:27:36.065
It’s a very big problem.

00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:39.746
And whatever is in one book, they’ll try to follow that.

00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:43.364
I mean they are  shifting type of people.

00:27:43.874 --> 00:27:47.163
They shift from one to another

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:55.169
and then progress in Sahaja Yoga is much more difficult, very difficult,

00:27:55.526 --> 00:27:58.253
because if you are going on one path

00:27:58.364 --> 00:28:03.734
and you start shifting from one to another, you may go back.

00:28:03.996 --> 00:28:07.613
But in that they find it is their ‘freedom’.

00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:13.126
Actually without Realisation you don’t have your freedom, of anything.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:23.290
Freedom is that in which you know what you are,
you know what you are capable of.

00:28:23.742 --> 00:28:28.977
In the freedom you are the one who should receive all the blessings.

00:28:29.588 --> 00:28:33.566
If these blessings are not there then you are not free.

00:28:33.757 --> 00:28:42.052
There’s something wrong, somewhere, in your own life.

00:28:42.507 --> 00:28:48.795
Because once you get your Realisation you become absolutely free people.

00:28:49.751 --> 00:28:55.502
‘Free’ means, your own Spirit guides you.

00:28:55.872 --> 00:29:04.155
The Spirit, as you know, is the reflection of the Divine, the God Almighty.

00:29:04.617 --> 00:29:10.155
If everybody has the same reflection and He’s awakened,

00:29:10.544 --> 00:29:17.542
then in the awareness it works.
As if they know what is right and what is wrong,

00:29:17.654 --> 00:29:21.524
what is constructive and what is destructive.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:27.142
It is not some sort of a false satisfaction that you have,

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:32.255
but in reality, you feel the Reality.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.020
And that is what it has to happen.

00:29:36.305 --> 00:29:40.546
The first thing, in Sahaja Yoga, is that you get the experience,

00:29:40.829 --> 00:29:47.383
experience of feeling the spanda, the cool breeze, on your finger tips.

00:29:47.745 --> 00:29:51.265
Without the experience you should not believe anything.

00:29:51.448 --> 00:29:59.093
That means a new dimension has come now, in your nerves,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:08.110
that you can feel the system

00:30:08.662 --> 00:30:14.061
which has been not known to you.

00:30:14.202 --> 00:30:22.627
Sympathetic nervous system was there but you never knew how it is working.

00:30:23.065 --> 00:30:27.285
The knowledge about yourself was so poor.

00:30:27.768 --> 00:30:32.886
But after Realisation suddenly the whole thing got enlightened.

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:38.710
Suddenly you started feeling it, the newness, among yourselves.

00:30:39.064 --> 00:30:42.652
Still sometimes you haveto fight your ego,

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.500
you have to get over your ignorance of things.

00:30:47.061 --> 00:30:50.770
Because Realisation gives you Absolute Knowledge,

00:30:51.563 --> 00:30:55.367
Absolute Knowledge. It cannot be challenged.

00:30:56.978 --> 00:31:02.265
It’s single: as they call it – ‘Ekameva Satya’, (the only Truth).

00:31:02.846 --> 00:31:09.963
And when you get that knowledge then you can tally it also.

00:31:10.257 --> 00:31:14.754
You can find out if it is correct or not.

00:31:15.973 --> 00:31:20.621
This is something that has happened to all of you,

00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:27.624
and you have already got those vibrations with which you can feel it.

00:31:28.491 --> 00:31:35.991
For example, there may be some dissatisfied souls with Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:37.008 --> 00:31:44.628
But you can find out, on vibrations, who are these people and what are they doing.

00:31:44.897 --> 00:31:52.991
On vibrations you can make out if those people have reached
that state of Reality or not.

00:31:53.418 --> 00:31:59.132
You can make out if these people, who are

00:31:59.743 --> 00:32:05.951
trying to oppose you, or trying to tell you something else –
“How far are they?”

00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:09.741
On your fingertips you know.

00:32:09.852 --> 00:32:15.820
This is what is Qiyamah about which Mohammed Saheb has said.

00:32:16.214 --> 00:32:20.972
The other day I must tell you, an experience we had: There was one fellow

00:32:21.162 --> 00:32:27.619
who came from the television  known as ‘Star’.

00:32:28.244 --> 00:32:34.644
And he started asking me very funny questions, which had no relevance.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.474
His name was ‘Abbas’, so I said, “Abbas bhaiya,

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:43.340
you are wasting your time and my time.
Will you come to the right questions!”

00:32:44.697 --> 00:32:48.745
So he said, “I am against all fundamentalism."

00:32:48.912 --> 00:32:50.719
“But I am not fundamentalist.

00:32:51.383 --> 00:32:55.101
How do you know I am that or not?”

00:32:56.242 --> 00:32:59.092
So he said, “I am trying to find out!”

00:32:59.299 --> 00:33:02.579
“Alright,” I said, “you put your hands towards me.

00:33:02.861 --> 00:33:07.800
Mohammed Saheb has said that ‘At the time of, Qiyamah your hands will speak’."

00:33:08.106 --> 00:33:13.039
And, you will be amazed, immediately he started feeling cool breeze on his hands.

00:33:13.149 --> 00:33:16.651
He said, “What’s happening to me?”
I said, “That’s what it is!”

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.121
No use arguing, no use talking about it,

00:33:25.294 --> 00:33:28.089
no use enquiring.

00:33:28.225 --> 00:33:30.639
Just see yourself the experience of it.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:39.155
He just got so stunned and after that whatever he talked to me, he never published it.

00:33:39.997 --> 00:33:44.820
So what I am saying  that if the people reach the Truth

00:33:45.214 --> 00:33:50.319
and they know this is the Truth, nothing can change them.

00:33:50.506 --> 00:33:53.226
If they have reached the Truth, I am saying.

00:33:53.329 --> 00:33:59.399
You can see in the life of all the great people that they think “This is the Truth”.

00:33:59.572 --> 00:34:08.012
Not by just reading, not by just believing but as an experience,

00:34:08.432 --> 00:34:13.303
that, on their central nervous system they can feel the Truth.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.864
Then it is impossible to change them.

00:34:19.374 --> 00:34:26.054
Like you can see a seed becomes a tree, then you cannot make the tree into a seed.

00:34:26.308 --> 00:34:31.902
Seed is a seed, but when the seed changes into the tree

00:34:32.108 --> 00:34:35.193
then you cannot bring it back to the seed.

00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:38.401
It may create more seeds, that’s different.

00:34:38.842 --> 00:34:43.162
so, in the same way, once you have got your Realisation,

00:34:43.297 --> 00:34:46.408
and once you have become one with the Divine,

00:34:46.781 --> 00:34:51.621
then there is no question of you going down, unless and until you,

00:34:51.714 --> 00:34:53.764
yourself, want to go down.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:00.666
It’s very very remarkable, how you get this property,

00:35:00.817 --> 00:35:05.526
how you get this ability and this capability,

00:35:05.684 --> 00:35:09.171
and after that you don’t lose it!

00:35:09.477 --> 00:35:15.017
Of course, first you must grow, and for that you have to meditate.

00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:21.553
But this meditation, once you do it, the whole

00:35:21.783 --> 00:35:28.718
being itself gets so enlightened and so beautiful that you don’t want to change it.

00:35:28.924 --> 00:35:32.524
You want to be there and enjoy it forever.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.782
But of course you want to give it to others

00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:38.776
because you see  you are enjoying so much.

00:35:38.866 --> 00:35:41.781
Like, on the street, you find somebody

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.131
starving and you are very full, then you feel like giving food to that person.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:51.462
In the same way, you see in this world, people are madly seeking, running up and down,

00:35:51.561 --> 00:35:54.552
doing all kinds of things, so you want to tell them.

00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:56.832
They may or may not believe.

00:35:56.958 --> 00:36:06.978
They may try to absolutely deny you, defy you.

00:36:07.152 --> 00:36:08.972
They can do anything.

00:36:09.036 --> 00:36:14.511
But you know for definite that you are on the right path, you are on the

00:36:14.749 --> 00:36:20.564
right state of mind which is a Sahaja state.

00:36:21.008 --> 00:36:26.039
In Sanskrit it is called ‘sahaja avastha’, ‘sahajavastha’.

00:36:26.205 --> 00:36:31.749
In sahajavastha you do not react, you do not react.

00:36:32.144 --> 00:36:33.724
You just see and appreciate.

00:36:33.873 --> 00:36:38.778
Now see: I came, I saw this beautiful, such an idea of Sahastrara,

00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:44.487
all the chakras, they have crossed over, gone up there and from there they have.

00:36:44.631 --> 00:36:46.891
Very good expression.

00:36:48.407 --> 00:36:54.987
But any other person would say, “Oh, this colour combination is not good!”

00:36:56.826 --> 00:36:58.709
“Why did they use this?

00:36:58.931 --> 00:37:00.982
Why don’t they use something else?”

00:37:00.998 --> 00:37:04.923
Like that, you see, finding faults with others!

00:37:06.355 --> 00:37:13.335
And this finding faults actually comes from your brain which is not yet enlightened.

00:37:13.454 --> 00:37:17.189
You cannot enjoy anything because you react.

00:37:17.308 --> 00:37:19.198
All the time you go on reacting.

00:37:19.389 --> 00:37:23.242
If somebody says something nice, still you are reacting.

00:37:23.496 --> 00:37:27.778
If someone says something bad, of course you are reacting!

00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:29.583
No question!

00:37:30.464 --> 00:37:39.082
So for us to understand that
we are not free to react, we are not that cheap to react.

00:37:41.567 --> 00:37:44.758
We are on a very high pedestal.

00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:48.180
What is our job Is to enjoy?

00:37:48.482 --> 00:37:50.770
Enjoy everything.

00:37:51.365 --> 00:37:58.263
And that enjoyment is the blessing of the Divine.

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:04.818
Even you can enjoy the turmoil and the torture.

00:38:05.136 --> 00:38:09.238
Everything you can enjoy if you see the point that:

00:38:09.397 --> 00:38:14.426
nothing can happen to your Spirit, which is the real light.

00:38:14.713 --> 00:38:21.821
Whatever you may suffer, whatever you may think is troubling you –

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:27.466
actually this silent light of the Spirit

00:38:27.513 --> 00:38:35.651
makes you absolutely, perfectly joyous and you give joy to others.

00:38:36.183 --> 00:38:39.634
You don’t design it, you don’t plan it,

00:38:39.745 --> 00:38:43.568
how to give joy, but you just automatically give joy.

00:38:44.337 --> 00:38:52.782
And this giving joy is also effortless, sahaj, because you are in the sahaja state.

00:38:53.112 --> 00:39:01.692
In the sahaja state you just see things.

00:39:02.842 --> 00:39:05.130
It’s a drama, you feel.

00:39:05.273 --> 00:39:11.508
It’s a different styles, different types and you just see and watch,

00:39:11.963 --> 00:39:16.341
and get the joy out of it.

00:39:17.413 --> 00:39:22.233
It is not important to say, “I like this, I like that." No!

00:39:23.702 --> 00:39:28.172
That ‘I’, which likes, is nothing but ego,

00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:36.836
and keeps you out of the enjoyment which is reality, which is real.

00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:44.157
Every thing in this world, that you find is troublesome,

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:52.470
if you see  from another angle, from a sahajasthiti,
you won’t feel the troubles.

00:39:53.502 --> 00:39:56.827
But that higher life should be there.

00:39:57.032 --> 00:40:01.567
That higher standard should be built-in within you.

00:40:02.337 --> 00:40:07.059
The other day I had a meeting with the bureaucrats

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.591
and I told them, “I know that the pay is less.

00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:16.804
You may think that the others get much more pay, they are having much more facilities.

00:40:17.209 --> 00:40:21.727
But there is one way you can really enjoy your work:

00:40:21.902 --> 00:40:25.655
if you have patriotism, deshabhakti."

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:32.759
If you have patriotism for your country, no amount of sacrifice

00:40:33.424 --> 00:40:37.053
will satisfy you. You’ll want to give everything.

00:40:37.261 --> 00:40:44.217
And you can go through all kinds of so-called dearth and depressive states

00:40:44.423 --> 00:40:47.453
without even feeling anything about it.

00:40:48.359 --> 00:40:53.536
And, at the same time, your feelings become very deep.

00:40:54.409 --> 00:41:02.360
For example, you are travelling and suddenly you find somebody who is sick:

00:41:02.612 --> 00:41:07.344
you can feel it on your vibrations that this person is sick;

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:12.856
and immediately your sympathy and your love flows to that person.

00:41:13.049 --> 00:41:14.658
You will try to help that person.

00:41:14.997 --> 00:41:18.555
If possible you will try to even cure that person.

00:41:18.877 --> 00:41:23.824
Just like that, your whole being becomes like an ocean

00:41:23.928 --> 00:41:28.326
which absorbs all the rivers and

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:36.532
all kinds of watery things, whatever it is, within its abdomen, I should say.

00:41:36.786 --> 00:41:43.369
It just takes all that is there,

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.665
but it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t trouble him.

00:41:48.177 --> 00:41:53.590
He is like over-powering person, with his love.

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:55.864
He doesn’t show his power.

00:41:55.999 --> 00:41:59.073
He does not bother about his self-importance.

00:41:59.192 --> 00:42:04.433
If somebody tries to insult you, “Alright."

00:42:05.259 --> 00:42:08.131
What is there there, the insult part of it?

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.296
And such people who have reached that sahajavastha

00:42:12.423 --> 00:42:17.066
are the greatest creators of art, of music,

00:42:17.629 --> 00:42:22.859
of great thoughts and that’s why these survive.

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:27.689
So many people write, but it goes out.

00:42:27.802 --> 00:42:31.735
So many people create, but nobody bothers.

00:42:32.012 --> 00:42:37.113
But those who are Realised-souls, whatever they create, is of eternal nature.

00:42:37.406 --> 00:42:42.031
Because they are now in the Ocean of Eternity.

00:42:42.531 --> 00:42:47.224
They are in the ocean of purity,

00:42:47.382 --> 00:42:54.801
where there is no idea at all, of hurting anyone or troubling anyone.

00:42:56.015 --> 00:42:58.415
Such a protection is there for them.

00:42:59.029 --> 00:43:01.705
They cannot be harmed!

00:43:01.951 --> 00:43:06.234
Because after all you have entered into the kingdom of God,

00:43:06.552 --> 00:43:10.660
so who can dare harm you or trouble you?

00:43:11.152 --> 00:43:20.969
Such a prosperity I have seen among Sahaja Yogis,
and such a generosity that they have,

00:43:21.461 --> 00:43:24.761
and such understanding about things.

00:43:25.031 --> 00:43:29.849
I don’t have to give lectures, “Now don’t do this and don’t do that!”

00:43:29.914 --> 00:43:31.624
No, no more.

00:43:33.052 --> 00:43:44.138
And those who are not yet already matured in Sahaja Yoga should try to mature.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:50.446
And those who are not matured and troubling, don’t worry about them.

00:43:50.558 --> 00:43:52.671
You should have pity.

00:43:52.782 --> 00:43:57.636
You should really have pity for such people that they are so immature.

00:43:58.255 --> 00:44:03.340
Today it is something great, I feel, because thirty years I have been

00:44:03.483 --> 00:44:10.180
running up and down everywhere and I have been able to gather so many people.

00:44:10.577 --> 00:44:16.408
There are so many Sahaja Yogis, you see, and also, all over the world.

00:44:16.805 --> 00:44:19.199
This is just a wee-bit of that.

00:44:19.389 --> 00:44:25.760
So this is something  was to happen, has been already described,

00:44:26.141 --> 00:44:31.101
has been prophesised by people that such and such thing will be happen,

00:44:31.355 --> 00:44:35.619
that so many people will get their Self-realisation.

00:44:35.959 --> 00:44:40.786
Unbelievable it was, of course, but, as now you see,

00:44:41.058 --> 00:44:46.556
how sweet is the feeling that we are all one.

00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:53.884
There’s no quarrel, no fight, no bad ideas, and nobody likes cheap things.

00:44:54.489 --> 00:45:03.615
They want to have something that is pleasing and has a quality of understanding.

00:45:05.525 --> 00:45:10.015
And I have seen people becoming poets, writing beautiful poetry.

00:45:10.396 --> 00:45:13.224
I have seen people becoming orators.

00:45:13.415 --> 00:45:20.486
Also I have seen people becoming very good organisers.

00:45:21.079 --> 00:45:27.119
But one thing is very important, is the humility.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:34.024
I said in the beginning and again I would say: what will appeal to people is your humility.

00:45:34.627 --> 00:45:40.572
You should be a humble person, not think that you are something special,

00:45:40.762 --> 00:45:53.327
or not think that you are some sort of a self-important person.

00:45:53.966 --> 00:46:00.336
Once you think that you are important then you are not part and parcel of the whole.

00:46:00.502 --> 00:46:06.526
If my one hand starts thinking, “I am important,” it’s stupid.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.855
How can one hand be important?

00:46:09.045 --> 00:46:11.095
All hands are needed.

00:46:11.289 --> 00:46:13.057
Everything is needed.

00:46:13.155 --> 00:46:14.615
Legs are needed.

00:46:14.721 --> 00:46:17.512
How can one part be so important?

00:46:17.745 --> 00:46:23.798
If you start thinking like that anywhere in your journey of Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:23.869 --> 00:46:27.003
then I must say, you are not in the sahajavastha.

00:46:27.202 --> 00:46:36.231
So my own effort was to take you into that beautiful arena of Sahaja,

00:46:36.694 --> 00:46:41.916
where you will be absolutely one with your Self,

00:46:42.004 --> 00:46:46.379
one with the nature, one with all the people

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:51.652
who are around you, with your own country, and countries.

00:46:51.985 --> 00:46:57.500
Everywhere, the whole atmosphere, as they say, the whole Brahmanda (universe)

00:46:57.749 --> 00:47:03.059
becomes part and parcel of you, and you are not separated from that.

00:47:03.249 --> 00:47:13.750
Then the echoes – they call ‘ninaad’

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:20.223
the echoes of your being, of your life can be easily seen.

00:47:20.644 --> 00:47:26.715
Not in material advancement or in any other kind of a thing

00:47:26.905 --> 00:47:32.410
but in the spiritual area, which is the highest.

00:47:33.473 --> 00:47:38.783
Everywhere, in every country, there have been people of that quality

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:42.531
and, till today, they are all remembered.

00:47:42.722 --> 00:47:51.056
In the same way you all will be representing a very great knowledge

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:58.305
about Reality: in your life, in your creation or in your working.

00:47:58.425 --> 00:48:03.495
In every way you can do anything.

00:48:03.749 --> 00:48:08.102
Now, only thing that, now, we have to do is to decide:

00:48:08.205 --> 00:48:11.343
how many people we are going to give Realisation?

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.570
What we can do for Realisation?

00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:15.777
What should we do?

00:48:16.023 --> 00:48:21.965
This is the only thing, if you go on with your

00:48:22.219 --> 00:48:34.547
complete emancipation, you will be surprised, it’s like climbing up a big mountain.

00:48:35.643 --> 00:48:39.502
But when you have reached to the peak, you can see everything very well,

00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:42.981
and you feel so satisfied that you are at the peak.

00:48:43.591 --> 00:48:48.750
So, that climbing part, even  some of you have to do it,

00:48:48.988 --> 00:48:52.720
it is alright, there’s no problem, you can do it.

00:48:52.828 --> 00:48:56.455
You must have respect for yourself, love yourself,

00:48:56.521 --> 00:49:01.480
and  understanding that you have to reach the peak, peak of the mountain.

00:49:01.592 --> 00:49:05.465
And once you have reached the peak of the mountain you will know you are there.

00:49:05.748 --> 00:49:09.868
And then you start showering all your love,

00:49:10.058 --> 00:49:14.484
affection, and everything, that flows down the mountain.

00:49:14.578 --> 00:49:16.568
That is the life for you.

00:49:16.778 --> 00:49:19.446
It’s the greatest type of life.

00:49:19.555 --> 00:49:25.914
Forget all other people: politicians and all other people who were supposed to be great.

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:27.226
Forget them!

00:49:27.313 --> 00:49:29.730
You are much higher than that,

00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:40.007
because you are already chiselled like a diamond with the Sahaj style of life;

00:49:40.499 --> 00:49:48.638
which is very satisfying and also which is very much absolutely peace giving.

00:49:48.904 --> 00:49:52.334
It gives you joy, it gives you peace,

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:57.609
it gives you capabilities, it gives you so many things that you cannot count,

00:49:57.903 --> 00:50:02.623
like the thousand petals of your Sahastrara which are enlightened.

00:50:02.741 --> 00:50:06.651
God knows what all you can have with this!

00:50:06.912 --> 00:50:12.990
This is such a tremendous area you are in – the thousand petals.

00:50:13.278 --> 00:50:17.679
And from there, people have gained all the knowledge about science,

00:50:17.774 --> 00:50:21.855
knowledge about all the great discoveries are from there.

00:50:22.188 --> 00:50:27.601
So this is what one has to realise one’s own esteem.

00:50:27.753 --> 00:50:33.725
Self-esteem is different form self-importance.

00:50:34.078 --> 00:50:36.200
You should have self-esteem.

00:50:36.354 --> 00:50:38.729
With that you will become humble.

00:50:39.875 --> 00:50:44.944
You will become very loving because you are capable of love.

00:50:45.267 --> 00:50:47.986
And it is not forced on you.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:54.749
I agree that from the ocean the clouds rise

00:50:54.964 --> 00:50:57.101
and then they give rain and all that,

00:50:57.203 --> 00:51:01.218
but it is in the cycle of life  they are doing it.

00:51:01.486 --> 00:51:04.967
They are not conscious of it.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:10.170
They don’t think that they are doing something great because they are in the cycle.

00:51:10.366 --> 00:51:13.994
You are out of the cycle and still you are doing

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:20.126
work without any feeling of self-importance.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:23.629
You are doing because you have to do it!

00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:30.342
Another cycle, not the natural cycle, but another cycle of awareness,

00:51:30.469 --> 00:51:33.432
where you are aware as to what you are doing.

00:51:33.567 --> 00:51:39.836
At the same time you are very humble, you are very loving, you are very kind.

00:51:40.676 --> 00:51:43.917
You don’t shout, you don’t beat anyone.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.280
You don’t say anything harsh to anyone.

00:51:47.358 --> 00:51:51.815
And you can manage the most difficult person.

00:51:51.955 --> 00:51:56.077
If someone tries to be funny, you can always raise the Kundalini

00:51:56.268 --> 00:51:58.464
and be satisfied with it.

00:51:58.607 --> 00:52:03.977
If you secretly raise the Kundalini, the other person is finished!

00:52:04.207 --> 00:52:07.119
If you cannot raise it, then forget it!

00:52:07.409 --> 00:52:10.910
Forget it! He is a difficult person, you know, it’s a stone.

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:13.318
Now in the stone, what can you do?

00:52:13.424 --> 00:52:23.588
You cannot make it flow, the love and the dignity, all these qualities.

00:52:23.787 --> 00:52:29.237
It is not possible from a stone-hearted person, so forget it, that’s not your job.

00:52:29.684 --> 00:52:31.455
That’s not your job at all.

00:52:31.567 --> 00:52:38.389
So, I would request that, first of all, you should see that: how much humble we are.

00:52:38.732 --> 00:52:45.892
You have to be very humble and that is your decoration, that is your beauty.

00:52:46.335 --> 00:52:53.588
So you have your love, which is pure, without any lust or greed.

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:59.902
You love others only because you are in love.

00:53:00.612 --> 00:53:05.691
And then, secondly, you are blessed with peace,

00:53:05.858 --> 00:53:09.921
you are absolutely at peace with yourself.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:13.864
And you will be amazed – with peace, wisdom will come to you.

00:53:14.292 --> 00:53:18.687
You will be regarded as the wisest man, wisest woman,

00:53:18.799 --> 00:53:21.492
because you are at peace with yourself.

00:53:21.694 --> 00:53:26.332
Only in peace you can discover the Truth,

00:53:26.475 --> 00:53:30.769
you can discover every solution that you want to.

00:53:31.673 --> 00:53:39.492
You become  very wise and sensible person – outstandingly great than others.

00:53:39.844 --> 00:53:42.846
You are not like common, general, people.

00:53:43.383 --> 00:53:47.050
Then you have joy.

00:53:47.206 --> 00:53:53.024
Joy is something I cannot express in words but still

00:53:53.124 --> 00:53:57.366
joy, as I have told you many a times, it is singular.

00:53:57.532 --> 00:54:01.645
It is not happiness or unhappiness, it is just joy.

00:54:01.876 --> 00:54:03.633
Just you enjoy.

00:54:03.968 --> 00:54:10.910
You enjoy everything, enjoy every company, every incident,

00:54:11.021 --> 00:54:15.382
every scene, every happening in your life.

00:54:15.469 --> 00:54:17.963
You know how to enjoy everything.

00:54:18.902 --> 00:54:22.119
You see, just joy has a great capacity.

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:27.040
Once, I remember I had gone with my son-in-law and daughter

00:54:27.159 --> 00:54:31.333
to see some historical place and we had to climb a lot.

00:54:31.859 --> 00:54:36.706
We were climbing for about three hours, so, naturally, we all got tired

00:54:36.983 --> 00:54:41.419
and there was a little resting place, made of marble,

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:45.245
so we said, “Let us spread out ourselves here!”

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:48.950
So when I spread it out, they were so much

00:54:49.077 --> 00:54:54.350
saying, “Why should we have come here, of all the things"
All that they were grudging.

00:54:54.508 --> 00:55:01.904
Then suddenly, you know – this is the joy point –
suddenly I saw the carvings of elephants.

00:55:02.234 --> 00:55:04.886
So I said, “Can you see these elephants?

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.986
Everybody’s tail is differently made!”

00:55:10.057 --> 00:55:15.079
They said, “Mummy, how could you see the elephants’ tails?

00:55:15.198 --> 00:55:17.511
We are so tired!”

00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:20.172
I said, “You also see! Just see that."

00:55:20.342 --> 00:55:27.372
Because this joy, it shifts, shifts your mind from nonsense.

00:55:27.926 --> 00:55:30.272
You just say, “It’s all nonsense."

00:55:30.328 --> 00:55:32.130
You just shift your mind.

00:55:32.193 --> 00:55:33.989
This is the way you get joy!

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:36.785
And goes to the thing that will  joy giving.

00:55:36.864 --> 00:55:40.792
Supposing there is a person who is quite boring,

00:55:40.911 --> 00:55:45.095
you know, then what happens, you just see the

00:55:45.262 --> 00:55:50.738
humour behind boring: how a person bores you!

00:55:52.870 --> 00:56:02.290
And what you learn out of it is – never bore anyone.

00:56:04.488 --> 00:56:14.665
So this joy has a speciality, that it teaches you the essence of joy of everything.

00:56:15.025 --> 00:56:23.325
If it is a bad film, still you enjoy because you see how bad it is.

00:56:23.892 --> 00:56:28.627
Supposing, of course if it is a good film, then you can always see them!

00:56:29.087 --> 00:56:35.116
But you do not go with a mind, how to criticise.

00:56:35.393 --> 00:56:38.933
This criticism business goes out of your mind.

00:56:39.035 --> 00:56:43.144
So what happens  your mind shifts immediately

00:56:43.279 --> 00:56:48.716
from something that is ridiculous to something interesting in the same thing.

00:56:49.048 --> 00:56:54.027
So you don’t criticise and you don’t feel bad about it.

00:56:54.411 --> 00:57:02.591
Sometimes it so happens that people are amazed that how I tolerate such people.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:08.040
But I don’t tolerate, I am not paying any attention, whatever the person may be doing.

00:57:08.254 --> 00:57:15.272
If you are of that nature, that we can call as a condition

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:21.470
where you are absolutely in the Turya state:

00:57:21.701 --> 00:57:25.185
so Kabira has said, “Jab mast hue, fir kya bole?”

00:57:25.312 --> 00:57:30.230
When I have gone into that state of joy, why should I say anything?

00:57:30.906 --> 00:57:37.967
It is like that: a temperament which you have to understand, and respect it.

00:57:38.136 --> 00:57:40.336
That is within you, but respect it.

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:44.857
Do not compare it with others, others are not at your level.

00:57:44.966 --> 00:57:49.195
So you are at a different level and you just try to enjoy.

00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:53.787
Never feel that you are something higher or greater – no, never feel .

00:57:53.968 --> 00:58:01.288
What you should feel  that thankfulness that you are not mixed up with

00:58:01.671 --> 00:58:07.303
all those funny ideas and funny style of life

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:10.218
where you go on criticising – “This is not good!
I don’t like it!

00:58:10.329 --> 00:58:11.730
I don’t like it!”

00:58:13.272 --> 00:58:15.747
Who are you?You don’t know yourself.

00:58:15.858 --> 00:58:18.998
When you say, “I don’t like it,” you are not knowing yourself.

00:58:19.323 --> 00:58:22.595
How do you know what you don’t like?

00:58:22.794 --> 00:58:28.375
I have seen people with very poor knowledge,

00:58:28.692 --> 00:58:35.610
who are just knowing  little bit here and there, are very critical of others.

00:58:35.888 --> 00:58:38.470
I don’t know the reason, why it is so.

00:58:38.563 --> 00:58:41.733
But maybe that they think no end of themselves!

00:58:42.544 --> 00:58:45.033
But this is what is very common.

00:58:45.247 --> 00:58:51.191
But if you know the Absolute Knowledge, then you become really humble;

00:58:51.358 --> 00:58:57.648
absolutely humble and sweet, gentle and kind.

00:58:58.663 --> 00:59:03.846
So today is a great day otherwise, for me also: I didn’t know

00:59:03.917 --> 00:59:08.382
that I will survive so many years to see this beautiful day.

00:59:08.819 --> 00:59:15.349
Because after all, it was very hard life, according to others’ standards.

00:59:15.627 --> 00:59:23.432
But what is most joy giving to me was creating Sahaja Yogis,

00:59:23.837 --> 00:59:28.040
and listening to them and talking to them,

00:59:28.326 --> 00:59:34.551
the way they were so sweet and so kind and so respectful!

00:59:34.963 --> 00:59:39.834
All this has helped me so much and I must thank you for that.

00:59:40.064 --> 00:59:47.103
With your support, with your help, with your understanding, I could achieve it.

00:59:47.531 --> 00:59:54.501
If I could have achieve it on my own, I would never have asked for this help of yours.

00:59:54.712 --> 00:59:59.383
But you are just like my hands, you are just like my eyes.

00:59:59.487 --> 01:00:03.394
And I need you very much because, without you I cannot do it.

01:00:03.479 --> 01:00:07.090
It’s like channelising: unless and until you have channels,

01:00:07.233 --> 01:00:10.396
what’s the use of being Adi Shakti or anything?

01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:12.126
How will you channelise it?

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:21.171
If there is electrical movement, you need channels, otherwise its a static thing.

01:00:21.556 --> 01:00:27.227
In the same way I felt, always, that I needed more and more channels,

01:00:27.346 --> 01:00:33.058
and when it worked out, I was really, really in a very great Spirit.

01:00:33.252 --> 01:00:38.785
So I thank you very much, again, for this day that has come.

01:00:39.047 --> 01:00:44.187
And I bless you from my heart that – now you take over responsibility.

01:00:44.385 --> 01:00:49.029
You are a Sahaja Yogi, so you have a responsibility, also,

01:00:49.108 --> 01:00:52.538
to give Realisation to others. Don’t keep to yourself.

01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:54.906
This has to be given to others.

01:00:55.089 --> 01:00:58.261
And you can explain, you can talk to them,

01:00:58.373 --> 01:01:01.063
you can really, very well, understand them.

01:01:01.263 --> 01:01:05.883
Try to understand them and talk to them.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.725
And you must give Realisation to others, otherwise you won’t feel complete.

01:01:12.052 --> 01:01:14.702
To feel complete, you have to do that.

01:01:14.948 --> 01:01:16.824
May God bless you all.
