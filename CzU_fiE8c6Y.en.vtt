00:00:07.511 --> 00:00:10.071
I am overjoyed to see you all here.

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:14.059
Actually the whole night I was working 
on Melbourne seekers,

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.948
that they should come today and 
should establish their realisation very well.

00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:28.180
Now we have to understand a few things 
about Sahaja Yoga very clearly

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.551
and there is no compromise on these 
few things that we have to accept.

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:37.541
Because, as I told you, 
Truth cannot compromise for you,

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:40.258
you have to compromise for Truth.

00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:45.452
So the first is that Sahaja Yoga is not just a precept,

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:52.515
is not just a precept: it is practice. 
It is not just a mental idea.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:56.898
Now you got realisation, all right, 
but it is not sufficient.

00:00:57.018 --> 00:01:00.981
Even if you think that you got realisation 
so now you are all right,

00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:05.553
you become the Spirit, all right;

00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:11.476
but still, it is more a mental conception 
than a real identification.

00:01:11.596 --> 00:01:16.773
So it is not that if you get your realisation,

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:21.099
and you start the awakening of your Kundalini,
starts very well.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.375
Still it is to be understood 
that it is the practice of Sahaja Yoga

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:30.345
which is more important than the precept of it.

00:01:30.678 --> 00:01:35.933
There are many people in India 
who can’t read or write,

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.547
who don’t have all these mental activities 
as you have

00:01:39.668 --> 00:01:42.284
and are not so complicated as you are.

00:01:42.404 --> 00:01:44.768
Some of them are aboriginal people,

00:01:44.888 --> 00:01:48.566
 just living in the villages, very simple people.

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:55.972
They get realisation, they feel the joy 
much faster than the complicated ones will

00:01:56.093 --> 00:01:58.017
and they just start working on it.

00:01:58.137 --> 00:01:59.773
You have to work it out.

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:02.294
This is not the compassion that speaks,

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:07.777
talks, elaborates and advertises, 
but it works.

00:02:07.897 --> 00:02:12.033
Sahaja Yoga is a thing that works, 
the religion that works.

00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:16.708
And this is what we must understand first of all, 
that it is not the talking,

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:28.363
it is not the precept that you are a great soul: 
you have to become.

00:02:28.563 --> 00:02:30.400
Not that you are not. You are.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.733
But you have to be aware of it. 
More light has to flow into you.

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:38.555
Definitely you must be something 
special to get it, no doubt.

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:43.935
But you must allow your lamp 
to be cleared out, cleansed,

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:46.432
so that more light is given.

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:53.507
And it works wonders for people 
who honestly want to ascend in spirituality.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:59.090
As I told you before also that it is 
a concept that many people have

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.456
that Sahaja Yoga cures people. 
It is not true.

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:08.634
It is just as a by-product it may cure you; 
just as a by-product.

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:17.960
So one must understand the blessing has 
come to you only because you are a seeker,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.928
you have done lots of good in your past life 
and this life also

00:03:22.048 --> 00:03:26.331
and that God has chosen you 
to be in His Kingdom.

00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:31.092
But it cannot be demanding, 
you cannot demand,

00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:33.242
you cannot demand anything from God,

00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:36.383
He has to give you, because 
He knows what you deserve.

00:03:36.503 --> 00:03:39.280
And He gives you much, much, much more 
than what you deserve.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.751
I mean, I have seen people 
who have been in Sahaja Yoga

00:03:41.872 --> 00:03:43.592
that after one year they start asking,

00:03:43.713 --> 00:03:47.038
“Mother, what did we do to deserve all this?”.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.686
They just can’t believe it.

00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:52.213
I said, “Must be something, 
you must know there must be something

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:54.800
that the blessings have come to you”.
