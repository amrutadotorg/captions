00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:21.940
Today again I must thank [SOUNDS LIKE Mr.
Swanowaphala] for singing such a beautiful

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:33.190
song about the Devi. I was very much impressed
the way Patrick told you that they are confident

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:46.020
that they can solve any problem. That's what
it has to be. That's the sign of a Sahaja

00:35:55.999 --> 00:36:01.859
Yogi who has reached a very great height in
his understanding about himself and about

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:05.289
others.

00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:12.289
The Chakra of the Goddess lies behind the
sternum bone in the spinal chord. This Chakra

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:35.850
is placed above the Bhavasagara, above the
Void, as we call it in Sahaja Yoga. And the

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:45.200
bridge that has to be crossed by the bhaktas,
by the seekers, is guarded by. She's the one,

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:08.210
She helps Her children to come through that
passage when there are negative forces trying

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:22.310
to attack on a seeker.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:29.310
This chakra is placed at the back of the sternum
bone as I told you. In childhood, the antibodies

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:39.530
are formed in the sternum bone. They are the
warriors or the [SOUNDS LIKE Sainikas] of

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:58.280
the Devi. Until the age of 12 years they grow
and multiply, and ultimately they all get

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:09.540
distributed all over the body, and a human
being is made able to face any outside invasion

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:22.630
on him. These antibodies know how to fight.
They are extremely confident and they know

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:46.880
who are their enemies. They've all these messages
built in themselves. So when the anti-God

00:38:53.730 --> 00:39:00.730
element enters into the being through any
process, say, through food, through words,

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:10.550
through action, through devilish people, or
black magic, these antibodies combine together,

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:26.379
collectively fight the invaders.

00:39:26.379 --> 00:39:33.379
Those who do not have their Central Heart
properly developed suffer from tremendous

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:47.690
insecurity all their lives. When they are
children, you try to control them by frightening.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:06.880
These children later on become extremely insecure.
They are afraid of darkness, they are afraid

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:17.290
of night. Some of them are afraid of everything.
Because the antibodies that are built in the

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:29.210
body are not sufficient in number and being
this center so weak, the person feels extremely

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:41.660
insecure. Later on in life when the child
goes to the school or he tries to work out

00:40:47.139 --> 00:40:54.139
something for the future, then also his confidence
can be shaken by parents, teachers, and outside

00:41:04.729 --> 00:41:11.440
people. So it is very important to understand
children who are growing.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:18.440
In the West they analyze everything and try
to put human beings into compartments. First

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:30.820
the child, is a child according to them, child
has no innocence, and he's extremely selfish.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:42.550
Second part is adolescence, which they think
is
a very arbitrary, moody stuff. In India, we

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:59.030
do not know that there is something like adolescence.
Now these adolescent people form a group,

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:07.810
and they start criticizing or making fun of
all the elders. At a very young age it starts.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:18.620
First they make fun of the teachers, then
of the parents, then of all the people who

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:25.669
are senior to them. They start becoming extremely
active in their brains because they see too

00:42:29.669 --> 00:42:36.669
many televisions and things like that, and
then they start behaving at a very young age

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:44.350
in such violent ways that one cannot imagine.

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:51.350
I used to live about 25 miles away from London.
And every time I would go to London, I would

00:42:54.460 --> 00:43:00.630
find some children doing some sort of a mischief,
somewhere. One day some of them entered into

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:07.630
my compartment, and they started pulling out
all the covers, thrusting their knives into

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:19.660
the seats, opening out all the upholstery.
I was just sitting and watching. So I said,

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:31.530
"Now are you tired? Please sit down. What's
the problem?" They said, "We are all very

00:43:31.979 --> 00:43:37.240
angry." I said, "For what? Why are you angry?"
Said, "We are just angry." I said, "But you

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:44.240
have to be angry for something." They were
children going to good schools definitely,

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:56.130
wearing very good clothes. And then I had
to, - when the train stopped - I called the

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.470
ticket collector and told him that these boys
have been doing all this hooliganic, hooliganism

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:06.470
in the compartment and you better look at
it. And he came in and he said, "this is a

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:15.410
common thing" and then somehow or other he
took them out.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:22.410
But the only thing I felt about them is, that
all of them had their Center Heart catching.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:31.270
On the Kundalini, they were catching their
Center Heart. But when they saw Me, they sat

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:39.620
down. They were quiet, they listened to Me.
I settled their Center Heart. And most of

00:44:45.709 --> 00:44:51.770
them said, "We are angry with our mother."
"Why?" "Because our brothers are angry." "But

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:58.770
why your brothers are angry?" Then I discovered
that Freud has given these funny ideas against

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:06.470
the mother. Mother itself, can you imagine!
What a anti-God activity it is.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:13.760
To an Indian, Mother is the primal thing - any
Indian. Because his sense of security lies

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:26.510
in the mother. Even if the father is hot-tempered,
is angry, still they depend on the mother.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:40.600
Because mother knows when to get angry and
when not to get angry. She has the discrimination.

00:45:40.959 --> 00:45:46.950
And she is the one who protects them.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:53.950
The idea of Mother is completely blasted in
the West, and this is the reason why the children

00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:02.480
of that country feel so insecure, and when
they grow, they are extremely insecure. You

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:10.680
won't believe that all the time they are polishing
their brass, cleaning their house, but not

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:19.350
even a rat enters their houses. And if they
have to talk to someone, they'll make a person

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:24.880
stand outside and talk from inside, specially
in London, because they are literally frightened.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:31.880
Nobody will believe, the British who ruled
us, are such frightened people. But they are.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.160
They are frightened of each other, they are
frightened of themselves. The reason is, the

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.140
Center Heart is absolutely weak.

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:49.140
I've told you the first reason, the family
insecurities. The child does not know when

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:57.540
he comes back from school, whether his mother
would be there or she would be gone. They

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:06.920
don't have mothers who can bear a lot from
the husbands and smile and show no signs of

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:14.540
their agony to their children. But the mothers
in that country, I've seen, always try to

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:21.540
use their children from all kinds of emotional
blackmail, you can call it. They try to torture

00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:28.649
the child by telling all the things the husband
is doing to them and whatever is the problem

00:47:28.649 --> 00:47:35.649
they are facing with the husbands. So the
child is not secured by the mother, but, on

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:42.910
the contrary, child starts giving security
to mother there. At a very young age it starts,

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:50.100
and the child becomes extremely negative and
left-sided. He feels that he's born in a place

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:56.279
full of hatred, insecurity, and fear.

00:47:56.279 --> 00:48:03.279
When the bhaktas are born in those countries,
they are also the same way. Because they think

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:11.760
if they have to go to a Guru, the Guru, as
known so far, tortures them or extracts all

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:19.529
the money, takes their [SOUNDS LIKE pareeksha,
tess], and he sometimes leaves them high and

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:24.399
dry on the streets.

00:48:24.399 --> 00:48:31.399
But in our country the Goddess has taken Incarnation
many a times. Thousands time She has taken

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:40.510
here Her birth, whenever the bhaktas called
Her, when they are pestered by the negative

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:49.350
force, She came on this Earth to save them.
These things used to be just accepted by people,

00:48:55.839 --> 00:49:02.839
but never were really accepted in their hearts.
People thought these are some sorts of mythological

00:49:07.899 --> 00:49:14.660
stories that the Goddess came on this Earth
and She tried to save the people. They could

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:21.630
not believe that there could be a Shakti who
could be born, who could fight these horrible

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:28.630
rakshasas, and kill them, and save Her children,
Her bhaktas, from agony. It was too much.

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:38.350
But today in Sahaja Yoga, you have seen that
when Kundalini rises and stops at the Center

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:47.800
Nabhi, you have to say the mantra of 'Jagadamba',
and the Kundalini rises. That means, She resides

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:59.130
in the Center Heart, and when She is being
worshipped, the Kundalini rises. This center

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:15.730
has got twelve petals. But the Goddess has
thousand hands and thousand eyes. She has

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:36.950
16,000 Naris to work out Her different aspects
of enlightenment. But the first thing She

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:50.990
has to do, through Her generosity, and kindness,
and compassion, and patience, She has to suck

00:50:53.480 --> 00:51:00.480
in the sins - the [SOUNDS LIKE Papavimochini]
- the sins of human beings.

00:51:03.199 --> 00:51:10.199
One of the sentences in Bible was, "Wages
of fear is sin." Or you can put it the other

00:51:14.899 --> 00:51:21.899
way round, "The wages of sin is fear." If
you have fear, you are committing a sin against

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:36.760
your Self and against God. Because, if Mother
is Almighty, and She can solve all your problems,

00:51:42.089 --> 00:51:47.860
you are under Her protection, then why should
you have any fear? That means you do not believe

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:54.860
that She's that powerful. When a person is
frightened, this center start breathing fast,

00:52:01.149 --> 00:52:08.149
giving rhythmic instructions to all the antibodies.
With that you feel you are getting a palpitation

00:52:17.429 --> 00:52:24.429
in the heart. This palpitation is nothing
but a signal to all the antibodies to fight

00:52:28.499 --> 00:52:33.049
the emergency of an attack.

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:40.049
But when somebody builds up insecurity later
on in life, it becomes a physical problem.

00:52:49.149 --> 00:52:56.149
If they have insecurities earlier, it is an
emotional problem. But later on in life, when

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:04.690
one develops a insecurity - any kind, like
a wife is insecure about her husband; husband

00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:13.789
is a loafer or a bad man, and carrying on
with other women, so the motherhood of the

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:24.090
wife is challenged. And when her motherhood
is challenged, she may get the weakening of

00:53:25.919 --> 00:53:32.919
this center, by which she may suffer quite
a lot and may have even breast cancer. These

00:53:33.259 --> 00:53:40.259
insecurities can be also self-made, imaginary.
People can just think about it and build up

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:47.720
some sort of insecurities, which are of no
actual existence.

00:53:50.139 --> 00:53:57.139
But such fears are very much more in the West.
Because the life in the West has no mooring,

00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:06.979
has no explanation. Whatever you ask them,
they'll say, "What's wrong?" A husband will

00:54:06.979 --> 00:54:13.269
say, "What's wrong?" in having a keep. And
the wife will also say, "All right, if he

00:54:13.269 --> 00:54:18.830
wants to have a keep, let him have it." In
India, no woman would tolerate such a situation.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:25.830
She would starve, she would do everything,
but she will never touch a man who has a keep.

00:54:29.159 --> 00:54:36.159
So the basis of the strength of Indian women
is their sense of chastity. The sense of chastity

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:49.479
in the Indian women is so great that nothing
can deter them as long as they are chaste.

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:59.489
But if they are not chaste, then fear settles
in them very fast. Chastity is the strength

00:55:05.179 --> 00:55:12.179
of women. And that's why those women who have
fear, mostly, have a problem of their chastity

00:55:14.359 --> 00:55:21.359
being challenged. A woman who is frightened
that her chastity may be disturbed, also can

00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:32.739
develop a problem with the Heart Chakra. Such
women can develop breast cancers, breathing

00:55:42.169 --> 00:55:49.169
troubles, and other kind of frightening diseases
on the emotional level also.

00:55:51.039 --> 00:55:58.039
This Chakra is ruined in women when they lose
their only child; because their motherhood

00:56:03.239 --> 00:56:10.239
is finished, they feel. And that is the worst
thing that can happen to a woman, if she's

00:56:10.739 --> 00:56:17.739
a woman. But if she's not a woman, she doesn't
feel much, and she just behaves in a very

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:26.580
manly way. And that's what I've seen in the
West, that women really don't much care when

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:34.720
their children die. But it is because they
are not women. If you are a woman you definitely

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:43.700
feel for your children and their death. But
after some time, such a woman comes back again

00:56:45.859 --> 00:56:52.210
and she accepts the life as it is, for the
sake of her husband, or may be if she has

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:59.210
more relations or other children. She becomes
extremely powerful as a reaction to what has

00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:04.279
happened to her.

00:57:04.279 --> 00:57:11.279
That's only possible if your center of Heart
is all right. Such women do not grudge, do

00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:21.249
not complain, are extremely serene, and can
bear up lots of things. They are extremely

00:57:21.249 --> 00:57:28.249
tolerant and can go to any extent to help
their children, but they are never spoiling

00:57:31.099 --> 00:57:37.820
their children. They never spoil their children,
because they understand spoiling is much worse

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:44.450
than beating the child. They never spoil the
children, nor ever pamper them, and never

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:51.259
get dominated by their children. They know,
"I have to guide the child and have to look

00:57:51.259 --> 00:57:57.779
after the child." So they look after all the
ideals and righteousness and the virtues of

00:57:57.779 --> 00:58:04.779
the child. And if he tries to get out of it,
they go all out to win him over back to virtue

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:14.340
and to better life. But those people, those
women, who do not care for actual growth of

00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:22.779
the child, may just avoid it and escape it.

00:58:22.779 --> 00:58:29.779
In the men, this chakra is caught up if they
have lost their mother very early, or if their

00:58:31.669 --> 00:58:38.669
mother by chance is a very cruel woman. Also
this chakra can be caught up by men, if they

00:58:41.299 --> 00:58:48.299
have been to wars, and if they have seen frightful
things in the war. Such people could be extremely

00:58:50.379 --> 00:58:57.379
emotional and could be easily befooled by
people who try to win over their emotions.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:12.590
What is to be done to improve this chakra?
In Sahaja Yoga we have many techniques by

00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:19.799
which we can improve this chakra, and get
your confidence back. As Patrick has said

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:26.940
- that he never used to speak. And I have
seen many actors who act very well and when

00:59:28.639 --> 00:59:33.559
they came to My program, they said, "Mother
please don't ask us to speak because we just

00:59:33.559 --> 00:59:38.739
don't know how to speak. We can act, but we
cannot speak to people." They tried once or

00:59:38.739 --> 00:59:45.739
twice and they ended up with two-three sentences,
mumbled down and sat down. I found out all

00:59:47.149 --> 00:59:54.149
of them had this Chakra very badly damaged.
Perhaps they lacked the love of their mothers,

00:59:57.509 --> 01:00:04.509
perhaps they did not love their mothers, or
perhaps, may be that they did not understand

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:08.219
the value of virginity in women.

01:00:08.219 --> 01:00:15.219
So those men, who try to look at every woman
who passes by, those men who try to have lusty

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:28.340
eyes, can also develop this center very badly.
And lots of problems can come through this

01:00:31.489 --> 01:00:32.080
center.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:39.080
One of the problems that comes through this
could be lung cancer. But I've seen this center

01:00:42.169 --> 01:00:49.169
is very badly affected also by certain negligence
in life. Like some people have a habit of

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:56.479
having a very hot bath, and then coming out
of that hot bath and enter into some cool

01:00:57.289 --> 01:01:04.289
place. Such people will catch this center
very badly and they will have a problem. Then

01:01:05.469 --> 01:01:11.879
there's another thing, which is looks very
simple, but many people have a habit in, specially

01:01:11.879 --> 01:01:18.879
summers, to wear a one single kurta or a single
shirt and not the under-shirt. This is also

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:30.809
not proper. A man must always have something
under his shirt, otherwise when it starts

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:38.889
perspiring, he can get trouble into this Heart
Center.

01:01:38.889 --> 01:01:44.960
This Heart Center is caught up by various
emotional problems in human beings. Husband

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:51.359
and wife, if they all the time quarrel, there's
always quarrelling in the house, specially

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:57.919
if the mother is very dominating, the child
develops this center. And if the father is

01:01:57.919 --> 01:02:04.889
very dominating, the child develops this - the
Heart itself. So it is very important that

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:11.349
husband and wife should never quarrel in the
presence of their children.

01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:18.349
Now there resides in this center, the incarnation
of the Goddess, who came on this Earth thousands

01:02:20.619 --> 01:02:27.619
of time, and She resides there for your protection.
But first of all you have to be worthy of

01:02:30.559 --> 01:02:37.559
Her protection. When She came on this Earth
many a times, you know, Her body was made

01:02:38.149 --> 01:02:45.149
by various forces, as if She was like a bubble
and the bubble was covered by so many things

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:52.940
added on to that. And that's how She got lots
of things from various Gods. Like Her hair

01:02:55.029 --> 01:03:02.029
She got from Yama, the God of death; Her nose
She got from ah the God of wealth, Kubera;

01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:17.589
and Her ear She got from the Povana, that
is air. Like that, Her body was made specially

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:25.820
by the essences of these great Deities, who
donated their essences to the Goddess, to

01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:31.239
be equipped to do these multifarious activities.

01:03:31.239 --> 01:03:38.029
Now the first activity, as I told you, of
the Goddess is to save Her children from the

01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:45.029
negative forces. So She looks extremely mild,
sweet but She can be extremely violent, - in

01:03:48.909 --> 01:03:55.909
the sense, She can kill or crush anyone who
tries to overpower Her children. [SOUNDS LIKE

01:03:58.809 --> 01:04:05.809
Atisaumya Atiraudra] - these two temperaments
exist only in the Goddess, because She is

01:04:08.629 --> 01:04:15.629
the Mother; and at any cost She wants to save
Her child. Also towards Her child when he

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:22.849
goes beyond a point of understanding, when
he shows no sense of discipline, then also

01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:28.599
Goddess can pull him down by certain methods
that She adopts.

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:35.599
Now first of all is that She gives all that
is needed to remove the fear from the mind

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:43.839
of sadhakas. Secondly, She cures this center
by giving birth to additional antibodies in

01:04:49.519 --> 01:04:56.519
the body. And, by vibrating the tired antibodies
to act in a way that they can fight back again.

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:16.239
Even in day-to-day life, She may establish
Her existence by showing lots of miracles

01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:23.359
to Her children. We had a lady coming to see
Me and she was rather late. And when she came

01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:32.679
back I asked her what was the problem, she
said, "No, there was no problem, but my bus

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:39.679
fell down about 20-30 feet down, and the thing
rolled down and fell on the ground with all

01:05:44.249 --> 01:05:51.249
the four legs intact. And all of us in the
bus were saved. But the driver got upset and

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:59.450
he ran away. So somebody who was ah in the
car, who knew how to drive, came down and

01:06:00.889 --> 01:06:07.889
he start - switched on the car and the car
started moving. And we came back then to Bombay."

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:13.599
So, on the way they started asking, "There
must be some saint sitting here, otherwise

01:06:13.599 --> 01:06:18.899
how can we be protected? Only a saint can
protect us like this." And she was wearing

01:06:18.899 --> 01:06:24.509
my ring. "Oh!" - they said - "This is Mataji's
disciple." They all started falling at her

01:06:24.509 --> 01:06:28.049
feet, saying, "Oh! You have saved us, you
have saved us."

01:06:28.049 --> 01:06:32.999
So, there are many miracles that take place
in your life. When you see an accident taking

01:06:32.999 --> 01:06:38.690
place, suddenly you find the accident is over.
There was one fellow, was a journalist called

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:45.690
Marathe. He and his friend, another journalist,
were coming from Lonavla down, and it's a

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:53.899
very big sloppy road, ghat, and their brakes
failed. And the driver said, "Now the brakes

01:06:53.899 --> 01:07:00.899
have failed and you take God's name." And
they started remembering their Mother. And

01:07:01.169 --> 01:07:08.169
suddenly they saw a big truck coming ahead.
They were about to bang onto that, they closed

01:07:08.519 --> 01:07:15.029
their eyes. And God knows what happened - they
opened the eyes and saw the truck was going

01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:20.259
upward and they were moving forward without
any difficulties. And they were amazed how

01:07:20.259 --> 01:07:25.169
it has happened, as if somebody has lifted
their car and put before the truck, and they

01:07:25.169 --> 01:07:29.959
been saved. And the driver also closed his
eyes and took the name of the Mother. It is

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:36.959
possible! It has happened with so many people
that they do not know how it works out.

01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:43.979
So one has to believe that we have the Mother
within ourselves, in our heart, and if She's

01:07:43.979 --> 01:07:50.979
awakened, She is going to look after us. She
is going to give all the protection that is

01:07:51.339 --> 01:07:54.529
needed. And there's nothing to be frightened
of anything.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:08:00.139
But you can imagine, as Patrick has said clearly,
that they were quite frightened, and I know

01:08:00.139 --> 01:08:05.279
they are. Even English language is like that.
All the time they'll say, "I am afraid..."

01:08:05.279 --> 01:08:11.379
"I am afraid I have to go." What is there
to be afraid, if you have to go? You better

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:17.539
go. "I am afraid, if I am doing." - they are
all the time jittery like that. And so jittery

01:08:17.539 --> 01:08:20.830
and when they talk, you know, they are so
frightened that sometimes you feel nervous

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:25.399
with them, that you you do not know how to
approach them, the way they are nervous. And

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:30.759
one of the reasons why they are nervous is
that, because they plan too much, think too

01:08:30.759 --> 01:08:37.759
much, analyze too much and then ego settles
down into their brains, and ultimately covers

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:44.899
the heart. Because their ego covers their
heart, they get a fright. Actually it so happens

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:51.899
that if you become ego-oriented you start
seeing yourself through. Because when you

01:08:53.159 --> 01:08:59.049
are at a level, you can even see your ego
very clearly, and then you get frightened

01:08:59.049 --> 01:09:04.159
of other people, because you think they too
also must be having the same type of an ego,

01:09:04.159 --> 01:09:08.320
and you are really frightened of it.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.269
It is very common also, in the East. Now in
India, I should say, that supposing you have

01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:18.269
to go to a government office, be careful.
Ah, anybody, even a [SOUNDS LIKE chaprasi]

01:09:20.879 --> 01:09:27.879
can shout at you for nothing at all. They
develop a system of barking all the time,

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:33.349
just go on barking. The reason is they bark
at you because they themselves are insecure.

01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:38.260
A chaprasi is insecure of his boss, his boss
is insecure of his boss, his boss is insecure

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:43.200
of his boss, ultimately the minister is afraid
of the voters, and the voters are afraid of

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.240
the minister. It's such a vicious circle.
So the whole system works out into such a

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.169
terrible insecurity (Shri Mataji laughing)
that you don't understand what is there to

01:09:53.169 --> 01:10:00.169
bark at? What is there to shout at? And then
a kind of a identification with the falsehood

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.130
is built up so much that you are no more a
human being; you are either a secretary or

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:10.359
you are an under secretary or a joint secretary,
I do not know who is higher who is lower.

01:10:10.359 --> 01:10:17.359
And then you have a some other secretaries
and then you have clerks, and this, and that,

01:10:18.819 --> 01:10:25.819
and that. And you are that, you are nothing
else but that. So because you are that, you

01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:31.519
must have these horns, and you must shout
at people, otherwise nobody is going to believe

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:33.150
that you are something.

01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:38.940
So it is such an identification that develops
into human beings, that too, because of this

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:45.510
Heart not being developed properly. Because
if your Heart is developed properly, then

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:49.950
you are a human being. Because you know your
Mother has given you the birth and you are

01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:56.490
a human being. It is there's no need to have
any fear from another human being who is also

01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:01.680
a child of your Mother. So there has to be
no fear about it.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:07.470
But the trouble is that when human beings
ah start wearing anything; supposing they

01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:13.980
wear a suit, immediately they'll start speaking
in English. As soon as they wear pajamas,

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:20.519
they start speaking in Hindi language, or,
say, dhoti, - Hindi language and pajamas,

01:11:20.519 --> 01:11:27.519
they might start giving [SOUNDS LIKE galis].
So it is a kind of a very superficial identification

01:11:29.339 --> 01:11:35.019
human beings develop, because there is no
depth in the heart. If they had that depth,

01:11:35.019 --> 01:11:39.890
that mooring in the heart, then they would
not develop these superficial things. And

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:44.990
as a result of that, they are frightened.
Because they know they are superficial, others

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:49.859
are superficial, they have got beard, we have
got beard. So they'll quarrel, if I am going

01:11:49.859 --> 01:11:56.539
to pull his beard, he might pull my beard
as well. Such a fear exist among human beings.

01:11:56.539 --> 01:12:02.140
And then, another thing, another steps come
into the minds of the people, that, why not

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:09.140
pull his legs to go up? This is the third
category of debasement.

01:12:10.839 --> 01:12:17.839
If you are the child of the same Mother, how
can you go higher than anybody else? You will

01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:25.740
remain always the child of the Mother. How
can you go higher than any other child, in

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:32.680
the eyes of Mother? You cannot. On the contrary,
if you try to do such tricks, the Mother will

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.210
punish you.

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:41.190
And this is the second thing that Mother does,
is to punish Her children. Yes, She punishes.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:48.190
In very sweet ways first of all. For example,
if the child is not eating and troubling,

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:55.950
She said, "All right, you don't want to eat,
all right, don't eat." That's a very simple

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:02.470
way of punishing children. But then She says,
"All right you want to have the way you want

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:04.200
to have, go ahead."

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.890
Like I tell them not to do such and such thing,
it's not good. For example, I told them that

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:16.890
don't ah change the flats just from the beginning,
and let the all the Sahaja Yogis stay with

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:24.779
other Sahaja Yogis. But the organizers thought,
it's better to take the flats, whatever may

01:13:24.779 --> 01:13:28.680
be the reason. Because (Smiling) they are
very wise organizers. But, you see, Mother

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:35.680
says something very simple, but it has a meaning,
one must know. And they arranged it that way.

01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:43.400
So, half of the people just protested that,
"No, we are going to see stay with some Sahaja

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:46.910
Yogis, we want to be with them." So they were
accommodating. The others were, - British,

01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:53.910
- you know, now a days are on the other side
of the mood. They are very, very tolerant.

01:13:55.309 --> 01:14:02.010
And they said, "All right, if we are not arranged,
we'll stay in the flats." So they stayed in

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:07.289
the flats. But what happened? It rained, and
rained, and rained, and rained, and they could

01:14:07.289 --> 01:14:14.289
not arrange their food even under the ah roof
they had built. So they had to shift, all

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:19.769
of them, to other places, and all of them
had to stay with other Sahaja Yogis, as told

01:14:19.769 --> 01:14:25.279
by Mother. If they had listened to the Mother,
they would have saved some money, as well

01:14:25.279 --> 01:14:31.019
as they would have saved some trouble, and
there would have been no problem at all. That's

01:14:31.019 --> 01:14:36.869
how little tricks here and there are played
by Mother just to convince the children that

01:14:36.869 --> 01:14:39.700
you have been stupid.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:46.700
Now, there are so many things like that which
Mother can play, and Her playfulness is very

01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:57.450
important in life. Because if She is severe
with the children, they'll run away. If She's

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:05.529
like any other gurus, the Gurus, the Satgurus
also, they used to beat their disciples! They

01:15:05.529 --> 01:15:12.529
used to hang them by a string! You don't know
how the Gurus treat their disciples! Some

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:19.640
of them take lots of money from their disciples,
and some of them take lots of aa things from

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:25.079
their disciple. They want complete surrendering,
and they make them subservient. They really

01:15:25.079 --> 01:15:32.079
torture the lives of their children, of their
disciples, we should say! But the Mother doesn't

01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:39.529
want to do that. So she plays little tricks
here and there and tries to correct the children.

01:15:39.529 --> 01:15:46.529
Now I'll give you an example of a Guru, whom
I met about five-six years back. He came from

01:15:49.099 --> 01:15:56.099
Amarnath to a small village, small district
place near Bombay, where a Sahaja Yogini was

01:15:56.150 --> 01:16:01.329
staying. And he sent his disciple, who was
staying in that place, to see that Sahaja

01:16:01.329 --> 01:16:06.740
Yogini. And she he went in and told that,
"You see, my Guru is coming, and he wants

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:13.740
to see Mataji. And he has told me that only
Adi Shakti will clear out my Agnya chakra."

01:16:13.859 --> 01:16:17.539
So she couldn't understand, she said, "What
is your Guru doing?" "Oh, God! Don't talk

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:23.420
about him," he held his ears. "Don't take
his name. Oh! You can't know how - what sort

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:29.359
of a person he is." he said. "But why doesn't
he open your Agnya Chakra? Mother will be

01:16:29.359 --> 01:16:33.539
coming but, of course, why shouldn't you do
that?" He said, "No, no, no, no! He said only

01:16:33.539 --> 01:16:39.099
She should open, nobody else should open it.
And he sent me to this place about five years

01:16:39.099 --> 01:16:46.099
back, saying that in the sixth year Adi Shakti
will be coming, and She'll open your Agnya

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:51.680
Chakra." Now can you believe it! Poor fellow
suffering from that horrid Agnya Chakra, was

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.490
suffering when this Guru had come.

01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:59.400
So he came to see Me and he told Me, "Mother,
my Guru has come and he wants to see You."

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:05.990
So I went to see him. And this Guru was sitting
down there with a big temper, you see, the

01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:10.579
nose were all bloating. Of course, when I
went there he touched My feet and everything,

01:17:10.579 --> 01:17:15.680
and then he called one very bad name to this
thing, "Did he go, did he touch Your feet?

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.839
Was he all right? Was he behaving all right?"
I said, "He was all right, but I can't understand

01:17:19.839 --> 01:17:24.990
why did you not open his Agnya chakra!" He
said, "Let him go to hell now! I am not going

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:31.789
to open his Agnya Chakra, who opened my Agnya
chakra? Why should I open his Agnya chakra?"

01:17:31.789 --> 01:17:37.759
So I said, "This is not good. I should open."
"Yes, yes, you will, because you are a Mother.

01:17:37.759 --> 01:17:44.759
I am not a Mother." So he went inside, ah
and the disciple told Me, "Mother! He hanged

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:53.140
me by legs on top of this well! For three
days I was hanging there." I said, "For what?

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:59.309
Why did he hang you there?" You said you said
she said, "Don't ask any one." Then he came

01:17:59.309 --> 01:18:04.640
in, "Yes, yes, I hanged you! Yes, I will,
again!" So I said, "Why did you hang him?"

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.200
"He was smoking. Because he was smoking, I
hanged him there. I said, now smoke, and I

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.769
was putting him down, up and down," I said,
I am smoking you." And he tortured him like

01:18:14.769 --> 01:18:19.369
this. I said, "But why should you do such
a horrible thing?" He says, "Otherwise how

01:18:19.369 --> 01:18:22.910
will you discipline? I am not a Mother. I
don't know how to discipline. This is the

01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:27.009
only way I can discipline him." And he said,
"You go on spoiling him, but I am going to

01:18:27.009 --> 01:18:30.809
discipline him like that." "All right, - I
said, - you shut up now, just now don't talk,

01:18:30.809 --> 01:18:32.789
or by let Me put his Agnya right."

01:18:32.789 --> 01:18:36.900
And I took about two minutes to put his Agnya
right. I said, "His Agnya is all right now".

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:41.180
Ah. Then he said, "Did he promise You that
he will not smoke?" I said, "He did not."

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:45.950
So he said, "You better ask him to promise,
otherwise I will not allow him to eat his

01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:52.119
food for three days." I said, "Ba-ba! This
is a horrible Guru! God save this disciple

01:18:52.119 --> 01:18:54.700
from this Guru (Shri Mataji laughs).

01:18:54.700 --> 01:19:01.700
But, you see, what he was meaning that there
should be a discipline in a disciple. There

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:09.240
has to be a complete understanding that he
is the Guru. But he said, "Look at these people.

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:16.089
How are they? They take liberties with You,
they trouble You so much, eh they try to be

01:19:16.089 --> 01:19:19.960
funny with You. Still You don't say anything
to them." I said, "I don't have to say. I

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:26.960
know how to correct them." So this is the
quality of the Mother, who can correct people.

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:33.539
She knows who doubts them, She knows who thinks
aah who thinks wrong about Her. She knows

01:19:33.539 --> 01:19:38.650
who thinks rightly about Her. She knows everything.
If She knows everything, She doesn't have

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:43.650
to worry. She is completely secure about it,
and She doesn't have the insecurity of the

01:19:43.650 --> 01:19:47.809
Guru, that one day the disciple will misbehave
or anything, because She knows how to correct.

01:19:47.809 --> 01:19:54.589
The other day I met one gentleman, a Sahaja
Yogi, and he came to Me and he started explaining

01:19:54.589 --> 01:20:00.650
to Me, "Mother, You don't know, this happened..."
I said, "Now, I don't know anything, isn't

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:03.049
it? You think I don't know anything?" He said,
"Yes Mother, how will You know?" I said I

01:20:03.049 --> 01:20:06.130
said, "I'll tell you one thing, that you pay
play lot of cricket in your childhood until

01:20:06.130 --> 01:20:13.130
you came to Sahaja Yoga." "Yes, that's true.
How do You know?" I said, "That's how I knew."

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:20.250
So I know on, then you know. Then he accepted,
"All right, You know Mother all about me,

01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:24.150
I don't know how You know." But She's [SOUNDS
LIKE Avalokiteshvari] - She's the one who

01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:28.190
sees everything. She knows, somehow or the
other, She knows. How She knows, that cannot

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:32.420
be explained at this stage. But She knows
each and everything what you are doing, if

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:34.109
She wants to.

01:20:34.109 --> 01:20:41.019
And the third quality of a Mother is, that
She's a Mahamaya. She talks like you, sits

01:20:41.019 --> 01:20:47.109
like you, ah She'll behave like you, ah everything
will be just like you. And you won't be able

01:20:47.109 --> 01:20:54.109
to make out the depth of this woman, who is
a Maha Maya because She plays such tricks

01:20:54.799 --> 01:20:58.759
on you and such thing in such a beautiful
way that you cannot make it out. You think

01:20:58.759 --> 01:21:05.759
that you're all right. You go to a person
and you tell anything you feel like about

01:21:07.069 --> 01:21:13.240
Mother, you try to do anything and ultimately
you discover that everything She knows. And

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:18.950
when you discover that, gradually you start
understanding that, "When She knows everything

01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:19.519
about me,

01:21:19.519 --> 01:21:26.519
I better be all right." And how does She know?
Because She resides in your Center Heart.

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:33.920
She knows everything what you have been doing,
what you are doing, what you're thinking of

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.440
doing. So She what does She do? [SOUNDS LIKE
Sankalpa vikalpa karowati], whatever sankalpas

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:43.609
you are making, She'll make it fall. If you
say, "Now, I have decided, Mother, to do this,

01:21:43.609 --> 01:21:50.609
and I'm going to do it" it will fail. You
have to judge yourself as a real son of your

01:21:53.839 --> 01:21:54.480
Mother.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:59.160
As in Bombay or any place we tried to get
some land, nobody could get it. "We tried,

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:02.480
tried, tried, you see. This is black market
money, bribery, corruption." I said, "Nothing

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:07.769
doing, I'm not going to do any of those things."
So then said, "Then Mother, how are we to

01:22:07.769 --> 01:22:11.569
achieve it?" I said, "You will achieve it,
don't you worry." Then they started saying,

01:22:11.569 --> 01:22:16.759
"She's not practical, She's this, She's that."
And everybody, who said, turned out to be

01:22:16.759 --> 01:22:19.390
very impractical. "Ultimately", - I said,
- "When you will be ready for Sahaja Yoga,

01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:26.390
then you'll get the land and the Ashram."
Because once you start an Ashram and have

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:31.640
some money there, you'll find all kinds of
bhoots will join together and will make fun

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.589
with the money that has been collected, there
won't be any proper arrangement, no proper

01:22:36.589 --> 01:22:38.420
discipline.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:45.420
And that is why the time has to be given for
children to learn through making errors, through

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:53.089
making mistakes, and understanding what mistakes
we are making and how we have to correct it.

01:22:53.089 --> 01:22:58.700
Once they start understanding it, then it
is very easy, very easy to communicate to

01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:05.700
them what they are supposed to do, what they
have done is wrong, and how to correct it.

01:23:06.559 --> 01:23:11.819
But as long as they think they are LIKE very
wise, as long as they think they are extremely

01:23:11.819 --> 01:23:17.650
nice people, and that they are on their own,
Mother says, "All right, go ahead, doesn't

01:23:17.650 --> 01:23:18.119
matter."

01:23:18.119 --> 01:23:25.119
Now you must know that Mother has saved people
from that Bhavasagara with such great difficulty.

01:23:25.499 --> 01:23:30.619
It's not easy to do that, it's a tremendous
task. Sometimes to raise the Kundalini of

01:23:30.619 --> 01:23:37.619
thousands of people, I feel like ah a big
mountain I have to raise. It's terrible. But

01:23:40.119 --> 01:23:47.119
people on the whole, who are not yet corrected,
think they are obliging Me by taking Realization.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:53.749
This is a very common feeling with human beings.
And I feel like laughing at the stupidity

01:23:53.749 --> 01:24:00.749
of the ego, that they are obliging Me by taking
this ooh Realization. And the way they talk

01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:07.259
is all on this terminology, "I came, I was
sitting there for three days, I never got

01:24:07.259 --> 01:24:13.019
Realization." As if I've done some criminal
act.

01:24:13.019 --> 01:24:18.789
So the whole attitude of a person gradually
changes towards the Mother, and he starts

01:24:18.789 --> 01:24:25.789
thinking that, "She is here for my well being.
And my well being is Her only concern about

01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:34.380
me. Somehow She'll achieve my Realization.
She's working very hard, and I must co-operate.

01:24:34.539 --> 01:24:40.589
I must learn to co-operate, it is for my [SOUNDS
LIKE heeta], for my good, She's doing it.

01:24:40.589 --> 01:24:46.170
And I should try to understand that it is
for my good." When such an attitude is developed,

01:24:46.170 --> 01:24:50.799
it is much easier to establish a disciple.

01:24:50.799 --> 01:24:57.799
But this disciple is different from a son
or a daughter. Because Mother is a Guru, no

01:24:58.119 --> 01:25:03.869
doubt, Mother is a Guru from the very beginning
you are born. But for a Mother, it is very

01:25:03.869 --> 01:25:09.420
difficult to be as harsh as these Guru are.
Not at all, nowhere near them. One cannot

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:16.259
beat them in the harshness. But it is for
you, in your own wisdom, to understand how

01:25:16.259 --> 01:25:23.019
to behave, how to ask for Realization, how
to change your attitude. Because if you think

01:25:23.019 --> 01:25:28.619
too much of yourself, and you try to show
off, She'll say, "Yes, yes, you are very great,

01:25:28.619 --> 01:25:32.410
really you are very, very great, you know",
till you suddenly discover that you have developed

01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:38.710
two big horns your head and now you are good
for nothing. Then She will say, "All right,

01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:45.009
now come along, you have developed this disease,
I'll put you right." So better not do all

01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:45.779
those things.

01:25:45.779 --> 01:25:52.710
On one side She is willing to go all out to
save you from all troubles. Like, supposing

01:25:52.710 --> 01:25:57.349
you have some heart trouble, if you have some
any other trouble, She'll go all out to save

01:25:57.349 --> 01:26:00.640
you. It's not easy to cure anybody's heart.
People think that Mother has cured us, so

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.410
it is all right, take it for granted. It's
not so. When you get Sahaja Yoga, you'll be

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:12.410
surprised that when you try to cure one person,
you'll fall sick for three days. Is not easy

01:26:12.819 --> 01:26:19.369
to cure. And those people, who cure, sometimes
do it through bhoots, also. Those who have

01:26:19.369 --> 01:26:23.059
bhoots can also cure. Because they themselves
are bhoots, what can happen to the bhoots?

01:26:23.059 --> 01:26:29.730
They cure people but put one bhoot into the
patient in such a way that that patient becomes

01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:36.730
a slave. And such bhootish people can be curer,
or faith healers, or anything, like supraconscious,

01:26:37.769 --> 01:26:44.769
all sorts of people, but when they cure any
person, be sure they are putting another serious,

01:26:46.039 --> 01:26:52.349
more serious problem into. They do not cure
you really. They actually are putting some

01:26:52.349 --> 01:26:57.869
diseases into you, or into the patients, it's
a very risky game.

01:26:57.869 --> 01:27:03.749
But a Sahaja Yogi, if he tries to cure somebody
- because he cannot put somebody else in the

01:27:03.749 --> 01:27:10.749
vacuum - he gets a problem himself. He's sucked
in. So, My advice is always for every Sahaja

01:27:16.829 --> 01:27:23.829
Yogi that you should not cure anyone. There
is no need for you to cure by touching. You

01:27:25.539 --> 01:27:30.529
should use My photograph, you can distribute
My photograph, tell people how to cure themselves.

01:27:30.529 --> 01:27:37.430
But don't cure anybody because you will have
problems, because you are not a bhoot. And

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:44.069
your will be hit hard. So be careful about
it, don't try to cure anyone, only use the

01:27:44.069 --> 01:27:51.069
photograph. By using the photograph the shraddha
will be there, the person will be steady,

01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:54.349
and you'll be all right.

01:27:54.349 --> 01:28:00.220
Ah, like yesterday we had some patient here.
And some people felt the compassion, you know,

01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:04.809
for that. And they all caught up. There was
no need to feel compassion. Have you got more

01:28:04.809 --> 01:28:10.309
compassion than I have? What was the need
to bring the patient here? There was no need.

01:28:10.309 --> 01:28:16.160
But they both got caught up. So there is no
need to bring any patients to Me. That's not

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.460
the way to behave. Never bring any patient.
If there's a patient, leave them alone. Tell

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:26.069
them, "Mother will look after you. We have
nothing to say. You. There's a photograph,

01:28:26.069 --> 01:28:32.230
you must use the photograph, get your treatment
done with the photograph, and you get cured."

01:28:32.230 --> 01:28:38.220
Otherwise, first thing that will happen to
you, that you'll catch on your Center Heart.

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:44.559
Because that's not your job. You are not to
do that. If you try to do it, actually it

01:28:44.559 --> 01:28:49.839
is your ego sometimes that makes you think
that you should cure a person, sometimes.

01:28:49.839 --> 01:28:56.839
And when you try to do through your ego, you
get into trouble. Not that you cannot cure.

01:28:57.690 --> 01:29:04.099
You can. But you have to be of that level,
when you try to cure a person you do not become

01:29:04.099 --> 01:29:09.140
a supraconcious personality, means you do
not become ego-oriented. But they do, ultimately,

01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:14.259
all of them. Those who have tried to cure
others, and do like that, they have gone out

01:29:14.259 --> 01:29:19.160
of Sahaja Yoga completely, becoming just mediums.
They have become mediums, horrible people.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:26.160
When they talk on the phone, I feel somebody's
pouring poison into my ears. They are so horrid,

01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:27.400
that you can't imagine.

01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:34.150
So, it is important for people who get Realization
not to indulge into any curing because they

01:29:34.170 --> 01:29:38.529
will develop this Center Heart very much.

01:29:38.529 --> 01:29:43.990
Center Heart can be developed in countries
where there's all fear, people are frightened.

01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:50.859
It can be developed by other things by which
people are frightened. Reading books of bad

01:29:50.859 --> 01:29:57.380
gurus and reading the books about shocking
things, like many people who read the Kundalini's

01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:04.369
book have got Center Heart (Shri Mataji laughing),
because they are so frightened about the Kundalini!

01:30:04.369 --> 01:30:10.710
Anything that frightens you if you read can
make your heart very, very weak and dangerous.

01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:15.650
Now we have two other sides to this Center
Heart - is the Mother's Heart - is Her own

01:30:15.650 --> 01:30:22.650
brother, is Vishnu, takes incarnation as Shri
Rama on the Right Heart. Who, we think is

01:30:23.599 --> 01:30:30.019
the (Mother) - Father who is looking after
His children. So that is the Father, and this

01:30:30.019 --> 01:30:36.069
is the Mother. Though here the Father and
the Mother are in two aspects, that the Mother

01:30:36.069 --> 01:30:43.069
is the ah Sister of the Father. And Father
is the Mama of the disciple of the sadhakas.

01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:55.410
The Mama is a greater father than a father,
as you all know. And so this Uncle who is

01:30:55.759 --> 01:31:02.759
the incarnation of Shri Narayana, looks after
the protected aah disciples of the Mother.

01:31:10.559 --> 01:31:17.559
He gives that Father's understanding to the
children. Because at this stage, this Father,

01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:27.970
God Almighty, is not known, who is Shiva.
So this Uncle looks after the children till

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:37.390
they are grown up enough to meet their Father.
And that is how we can say that Parvati, or

01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:45.130
Uma, or Devi, She comes to Her Mother's place,
[SOUNDS LIKE Mayka], and resides in this Center

01:31:46.609 --> 01:31:53.420
Heart. And there Her brother protects Her
children. When She gives Realization to children,

01:31:53.420 --> 01:32:00.420
or gives them second birth, then this Mama
looks after the Sister's children and helps

01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:08.279
them to build up the security of a father.

01:32:08.279 --> 01:32:15.279
So the right side of every human being represents
the fatherhood, the Fatherhood. And the Fatherhood

01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:26.210
of a man is very important. If this center
is spoilt, or if there's something wrong with

01:32:26.309 --> 01:32:33.309
it, then you get asthma as a disease. Asthma
is only caused by this center being spoilt

01:32:36.519 --> 01:32:43.009
or some other combinations with this center.
Asthma is very common among girls and boys.

01:32:43.009 --> 01:32:49.140
And the relationship with the father, or the
understanding of the father, or your own fatherhood

01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:55.960
is not all right, you get this trouble of
asthma, and for that one has to ask the questions

01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:02.200
to the sadhakas, what sort of a father you
have. As one gentleman came and asked Me,

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:06.759
"Why everybody's asking me, what sort of a
father you have? What sort of a - everybody

01:33:06.759 --> 01:33:12.059
asked me, what about your father, what about
your father? What has my father to do with

01:33:12.059 --> 01:33:17.089
me?" Actually everybody feels the Right Heart,
and they have to ask about the father. Because

01:33:17.089 --> 01:33:22.900
father resides in the Right Heart, and the
principle of fatherhood, if it is spoilt,

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:28.630
if there is a problem with the principle of
fatherhood, then you get this problem and

01:33:28.630 --> 01:33:34.200
many other problems ah which I do not want
to discuss now at length. But you can understand

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:40.119
a person who has no father, how diffident
he is, and how he behaves, and also such people,

01:33:40.119 --> 01:33:46.759
those who have not known a father, can become
very wayward, licentious or permissive, or

01:33:46.759 --> 01:33:53.759
could be very much secretly licentious. The
people who lose their father do not have that

01:33:55.079 --> 01:34:01.509
lacking - a lacking - they lack in that discipline
that the father gives them. Or could be, such

01:34:01.509 --> 01:34:08.509
ah people could take to a very remorse and
unhappy life. Or they could be very hard on

01:34:09.279 --> 01:34:14.029
their children, or could be extremely kind
and spoil the children. It could be any way.

01:34:14.029 --> 01:34:21.029
So it has of both the reactions, ah either
ah too much of love-giving or too much of

01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:28.230
strictness. It can be anything. Or a person
could be ah of this kind, may be very strict

01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:33.769
in childhood, and could be extremely lavish
in old age. It's a - it is a very imbalanced

01:34:33.769 --> 01:34:34.019
personality.

01:34:33.829 --> 01:34:40.559
So the person who has no father has to know
that his father is Shri Rama. He should not

01:34:40.559 --> 01:34:47.559
worry about anything. He is the One, with
one ah arrow He can kill any number of people.

01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:54.650
So he should have no fear, at all, about his
father not being there or father being dead

01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:03.079
or something happening like that. On the contrary,
if the father is dead, it's better to tell

01:35:03.079 --> 01:35:08.259
him not to worry about ah you and that you
are all right, so that you leave your father

01:35:08.259 --> 01:35:12.710
in peace and ask him to take his birth, than
to bind him to this earth.

01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:18.819
This is the Right Heart and the Left Heart
is the mother, actually your own mother, whosoever

01:35:18.819 --> 01:35:25.819
it is. That is the motherhood, in the sense,
that if your mother has been extremely unkind

01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:33.380
and extremely funny, or your relationship
with mother is bad, then know that there's

01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:38.640
something wrong on the Left Heart ah which
is indicated in you.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:45.619
So these two points are very important in
human beings. If a Sahaja Yogi just decides

01:35:45.619 --> 01:35:52.489
that, "I have a Father and a Mother; God Almighty
is my Father and my Mother" then these problems

01:35:52.489 --> 01:35:58.900
can be easily solved. But in Sahaja Yoga,
it is not what you think that works out, it

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:02.489
does not. Like in the car if you sit down
and think that, "I am going to Connaught Place",

01:36:02.489 --> 01:36:08.039
you won't move. You have to move your hands.
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga you have to

01:36:08.039 --> 01:36:12.519
move your hands. Clear you Chakras, move them
higher and put them up. It's not what you

01:36:12.519 --> 01:36:16.920
think is important in Sahaja Yoga. Not at
all. You may think ah that, "I'm doing very

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:23.920
well in Sahaja Yoga, I'm very good", but it's
not so. It is what you actually achieve, your

01:36:24.829 --> 01:36:30.920
ascent is the point. So, as in the car, as
I told you, you cannot just sit down and think

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:37.009
and do the job. In the same way, you have
to run this machine, and you have to see that

01:36:37.009 --> 01:36:42.109
you get all this movement. There should be
[SOUNDS LIKE ghati] in you. Otherwise, there

01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:48.839
is no sense in just talking about Sahaja Yoga,
thinking about Sahaja Yoga, and eh convincing

01:36:48.839 --> 01:36:54.779
yourself that you are a great Sahaja Yogi.
It is how you manifest it is the point, which

01:36:54.779 --> 01:36:59.920
very few people understand. Very, very few
people understand that it has to be manifesting,

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.339
it has to be [SOUNDS LIKE karyanmit]. It is
not just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk

01:37:05.339 --> 01:37:06.359
morning till evening.

01:37:06.359 --> 01:37:11.569
Even when I'm talking, now I'm opening your
heart, Heart Center. I'm working it. Even

01:37:11.569 --> 01:37:16.589
I'm talking, also I'm opening. It's working.
You will see your Heart Chakra is open by

01:37:16.589 --> 01:37:23.589
the time I finish My lecture. It is so, because
I know how to do it. When I talk I'm just

01:37:23.589 --> 01:37:27.519
watching where the Chakras are catching, what's
happening and I'm catching all these points

01:37:27.519 --> 01:37:32.380
and touching it and trying to open it.
And that's how it should be, that even when

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:37.859
you talk it should be karyanvit. Even when
you are quiet and raising hands it should

01:37:37.859 --> 01:37:41.819
be karyanvit. Whatever you do, you should
be karyanvit. Even if you glance at anyone

01:37:41.819 --> 01:37:48.819
it should be karyanvit, it should not be just
a eh kind of a jabbering that we do sometimes

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.920
about Sahaja Yoga.

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:58.920
The greatest fear human beings have that they
think they have done lots of mistakes, and

01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:04.329
these mistakes are too many, and they can
never get Realization, they'll be doomed,

01:38:04.329 --> 01:38:11.329
they'll be going to hell. This is not true,
at all true. Nobody is going to go hell - if

01:38:11.890 --> 01:38:17.460
they you do not want to. If you want to stop
it, you can stop it. The time has come. You

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:23.920
are going to be blessed and blessed for ever.
So may God bless you!

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:29.579
Today's lecture I've given you ah in a way
that you should understand importance of confidence,

01:38:29.579 --> 01:38:35.380
but not by saying, "I am confident." Because
when you say outwardly you are actually egoistical.

01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:41.999
But when you say in your vibrations, then
you are confident.

01:38:41.999 --> 01:38:44.460
May God bless you all!

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:51.299
Today I'm sorry I have to go for a dinner
tonight and I won't be able to spend much

01:38:51.299 --> 01:38:56.180
time today for touching Feet, because yesterday
My brother came home for dinner and I reached

01:38:56.180 --> 01:39:00.589
11 o'clock, so he went away without eating
food. Again today he's coming so I hope today

01:39:00.589 --> 01:39:07.589
you'll excuse Me for My brother because, after
all I must look after your Mama also sometimes

01:39:08.749 --> 01:39:15.749
(Laughter). May God bless you!

01:39:18.029 --> 01:39:23.539
Tomorrow I'll talk to you about Vishuddhi
Chakra, ah which I will start exactly at 6.30.

01:39:23.539 --> 01:39:28.989
I hope you make it convenient to Me and exactly
at 6.30 we start our program tomorrow exactly

01:39:28.989 --> 01:39:29.299
at 6.30.

01:39:29.299 --> 01:39:29.549
(Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi a few words)

01:39:29.299 --> 01:39:29.549
Those who do not obey suffer. You should not.
Once I've said it, what is there? Obedience,

01:39:29.299 --> 01:39:29.549
why is it difficult? Why is it difficult to
obey? It is just try and obey and you'll find

01:39:29.299 --> 01:39:29.549
it, obedience gives you the real confidence
- is obedience, just obedience. Just try.

01:39:29.299 --> 01:39:29.549
Just try to obey. It's very simple. And said
today no touching a Feet is all right. For

01:39:29.299 --> 01:39:29.819
Indians it is difficult, but if in English,
if I say, "You touch My Feet" they will not,

01:39:29.819 --> 01:39:32.390
they say, "Who are You?" (Shri Mataji laughs).
You laugh at them and they laugh at you. That's

01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.720
what it is. So today you become Englishmen.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:32.970
Thank you very much.
