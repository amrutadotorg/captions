00:07.160 --> 00:11.679
So, today's understanding should be that

00:11.800 --> 00:17.040
we all should become collective from inside.

00:17.560 --> 00:21.468
We should not grudge or grumble about everything

00:23.080 --> 00:25.880
and enjoy the collectivity.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.120
But the second side of collectivity is this,

00:30.240 --> 00:33.879
that, do not try to exploit the collectivity

00:34.000 --> 00:36.360
otherwise you'll be in trouble.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.319
Like, I've seen some people don't know how to use their bathrooms.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.135
When you are collective you have to be

00:45.256 --> 00:50.459
respecting the collectivity of others.

00:51.439 --> 00:57.879
By your presence another person should not, by any chance, suffer,

00:58.680 --> 01:10.560
or should not feel in any way insulted or inconvenienced.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.159
So when you are in the collective it should be such

01:16.280 --> 01:19.759
that another person should enjoy your company,

01:19.880 --> 01:23.280
enjoy your being there.

01:23.880 --> 01:31.120
That is something where there is no problem.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.439
But if you are demanding,

01:36.560 --> 01:40.543
and if you are asking for things and you think no end of yourself,

01:40.664 --> 01:42.872
you can not at all collective, by any chance,

01:42.993 --> 01:51.073
but you'll suffer for that, automatically you will suffer.

01:52.760 --> 02:00.118
If this is realized and understood properly, your Agnya is solved.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.378
Like anger.

02:11.482 --> 02:17.082
There are people always boast, "I'm very angry with him." Boast.

02:19.880 --> 02:24.079
But just make that anger into forgiveness

02:24.263 --> 02:29.000
and you will see the person, instead of you getting into problems,

02:29.121 --> 02:31.710
he will get into problems.

02:32.094 --> 02:40.574
Anger will upset you, but forgiveness will upset him, automatically.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.160
It's the biggest weapon you have got is to forgive.

02:45.640 --> 02:51.440
And this is shown in Buddha's character throughout.

02:58.920 --> 03:05.438
And this will give you self-respect

03:06.392 --> 03:09.712
that you are not disturbed by anything, you see.

03:09.916 --> 03:13.276
Like a ship has to be seaworthy.

03:13.397 --> 03:15.732
If you put the ship on the sea and if it breaks,

03:15.853 --> 03:18.239
what's the use of making a ship?

03:18.360 --> 03:20.319
What's the use of a Sahaja yogi

03:20.440 --> 03:23.297
who gets disturbed at every moment?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.920
You have to be seaworthy, and if you are seaworthy

03:28.040 --> 03:30.239
nothing can disturb you. All right.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.480
The elephant is walking and the dogs are barking all right,

03:33.601 --> 03:35.323
let them bark. What does it matter?

03:35.444 --> 03:37.712
The elephant looks this side, like that,

03:37.833 --> 03:41.439
sometimes takes some water and blesses them with water.

03:41.560 --> 03:46.513
"All right. Quieten down; so that your head will be cooled down."

03:48.634 --> 03:54.394
That will give you self-esteem and you will know what you are

03:54.515 --> 03:57.955
much higher than others.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.200
And this is what is … how to get rid of your ego,

04:05.321 --> 04:10.080
which is a very, very big problem according to you people.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.373
"Mother, how to get rid of ego?"

04:14.520 --> 04:18.481
Ego can be said, "You go."

04:21.328 --> 04:26.488
When this I-ness goes away, the Self rises.

04:27.240 --> 04:30.200
What is there to feel hurt? What is there to feel bad?

04:30.320 --> 04:34.360
What is there to hurt others?

04:34.988 --> 04:36.989
Han [Hindi meaning 'yes'] all right, you are cheated,

04:37.110 --> 04:41.719
very good; at least you have not cheated anyone, be happy about it.

04:41.840 --> 04:48.680
But once you are without ego means you have surrendered yourself,

04:48.800 --> 04:51.483
no one can cheat you.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.655
Can you understand that?

05:01.240 --> 05:09.479
No one can cheat you because there is some higher force,

05:09.600 --> 05:12.693
which is looking after you.

05:17.040 --> 05:21.440
This is the way we should understand Buddha.

05:21.560 --> 05:26.958
This is … we should know our Buddha qualities.

05:27.079 --> 05:30.800
This is how our ego can be dissolved.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.760
When you say, "Mother, we surrender to You,"

05:34.880 --> 05:43.320
That just means that you give that horrible ego a complete holiday,

05:44.920 --> 05:51.220
it means that. That is how this ego disappears.

05:53.320 --> 05:57.200
I think all your, your… just now,

05:57.320 --> 06:02.320
your Agnyas are opened out, most of you, somehow.

06:02.862 --> 06:06.444
And then you'll laugh at everything;

06:06.565 --> 06:12.847
you'll make fun of yourself; just enjoy everything.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.764
May God bless you.
