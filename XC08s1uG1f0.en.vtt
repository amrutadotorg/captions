00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.679
So, today's understanding should be that

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.040
we all should become collective from inside.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.468
We should not grudge or grumble about everything

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.880
and enjoy the collectivity.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.120
But the second side of collectivity is this,

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.879
that, do not try to exploit the collectivity

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.360
otherwise you'll be in trouble.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.319
Like, I've seen some people don't know how to use their bathrooms.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.135
When you are collective you have to be

00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:50.459
respecting the collectivity of others.

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:57.879
By your presence another person should not, by any chance, suffer,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:10.560
or should not feel in any way insulted or inconvenienced.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.159
So when you are in the collective it should be such

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.759
that another person should enjoy your company,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.280
enjoy your being there.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.120
That is something where there is no problem.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.439
But if you are demanding,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.543
and if you are asking for things and you think no end of yourself,

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:42.872
you can not at all collective, by any chance,

00:01:42.993 --> 00:01:51.073
but you'll suffer for that, automatically you will suffer.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.118
If this is realized and understood properly, your Agnya is solved.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.378
Like anger.

00:02:11.482 --> 00:02:17.082
There are people always boast, "I'm very angry with him." Boast.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.079
But just make that anger into forgiveness

00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:29.000
and you will see the person, instead of you getting into problems,

00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:31.710
he will get into problems.

00:02:32.094 --> 00:02:40.574
Anger will upset you, but forgiveness will upset him, automatically.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.160
It's the biggest weapon you have got is to forgive.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.440
And this is shown in Buddha's character throughout.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.438
And this will give you self-respect

00:03:06.392 --> 00:03:09.712
that you are not disturbed by anything, you see.

00:03:09.916 --> 00:03:13.276
Like a ship has to be seaworthy.

00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:15.732
If you put the ship on the sea and if it breaks,

00:03:15.853 --> 00:03:18.239
what's the use of making a ship?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.319
What's the use of a Sahaja yogi

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.297
who gets disturbed at every moment?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.920
You have to be seaworthy, and if you are seaworthy

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.239
nothing can disturb you. All right.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.480
The elephant is walking and the dogs are barking all right,

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:35.323
let them bark. What does it matter?

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.712
The elephant looks this side, like that,

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:41.439
sometimes takes some water and blesses them with water.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.513
"All right. Quieten down; so that your head will be cooled down."

00:03:48.634 --> 00:03:54.394
That will give you self-esteem and you will know what you are

00:03:54.515 --> 00:03:57.955
much higher than others.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.200
And this is what is … how to get rid of your ego,

00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:10.080
which is a very, very big problem according to you people.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.373
"Mother, how to get rid of ego?"

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.481
Ego can be said, "You go."

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:26.488
When this I-ness goes away, the Self rises.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.200
What is there to feel hurt? What is there to feel bad?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.360
What is there to hurt others?

00:04:34.988 --> 00:04:36.989
Han [Hindi meaning 'yes'] all right, you are cheated,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.719
very good; at least you have not cheated anyone, be happy about it.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.680
But once you are without ego means you have surrendered yourself,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.483
no one can cheat you.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.655
Can you understand that?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:09.479
No one can cheat you because there is some higher force,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.693
which is looking after you.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.440
This is the way we should understand Buddha.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.958
This is … we should know our Buddha qualities.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:30.800
This is how our ego can be dissolved.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.760
When you say, "Mother, we surrender to You,"

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:43.320
That just means that you give that horrible ego a complete holiday,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.220
it means that. That is how this ego disappears.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.200
I think all your, your… just now,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.320
your Agnyas are opened out, most of you, somehow.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.444
And then you'll laugh at everything;

00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:12.847
you'll make fun of yourself; just enjoy everything.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.764
May God bless you.
