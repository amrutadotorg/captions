1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,970
Now, any questions?

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,970
Question from a yogini: I have a question.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,970
Something that I’m encountering in my life,
and I and this guy who I introduced to Sahaja

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:07,970
and we went together.

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,970
He became very frightened after the first
meeting and he became very much against Sahaja

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,970
Shri Mataji: Me?

7
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,970
Yogini: Yes, saying that You were bad.

8
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,970
And I, continually I have had great results
with another woman who has experienced.

9
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:21,760
And he, on the contrary is very much against
it and we were involved a lot with channeling

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
and a spiritual, you know, man that channels
spirits.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
And I seem to think that he is still involved
with that in some way.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,760
I seem to think that is what is holding him
back.

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:58,510
Something is holding him and I don’t know
that if it is my place to help him or just

14
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:10,659
be a light or … I don’t know what to do.

15
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:42,830
Shri Mataji: Now to be very frank, no American
is afraid of anything.

16
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,350
Every world is afraid of them.

17
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,840
It’s a wrong idea they have.

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,299
It’s very surprising that the people who
give sense of insecurity to everyone always

19
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:57,830
say, “I’m insecure."

20
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,850
Very surprising.

21
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,770
That’s the way they can just say.

22
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:08,020
I haven’t met any American who is insecure.

23
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,620
On the contrary they are extremely aggressive
people – very, very aggressive for nothing

24
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
at all.

25
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,569
I’ll give an example.

26
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:24,069
The other day we had gone to one lawyer and
we were waiting for the lift to come down.

27
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:32,850
When the lift came, such a hefty, tall man,
six foot at least seven inches, very hefty

28
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,420
man was in that.

29
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,480
And we were standing for the lift to come,
we didn’t know there’s somebody inside

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
there.

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,870
As soon as the lift opened, he says, “Who
are you, like a bunch of thugs standing here?”

32
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,140
Can you imagine?

33
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,410
We were amazed.

34
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,099
There was no need.

35
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,989
He had a chance to say something to us, he
just said it.

36
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,030
“So please,” we said.

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,560
“It’s all right."

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,610
What could you do?

39
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,390
This is the kind of fear they have.

40
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,250
Russians and Americans.

41
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,209
Both are just the same, I would say.

42
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,770
Let them fight it out among themselves.

43
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:27,239
But to say that an American is frightened
of something, that’s the biggest joke.

44
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,040
They are not frightened.

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:41,849
On the contrary, they always fall into problems
because they go to something which is challenging. I’ll give a [UNCLEAR]

46
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,720
All the false gurus take money from you.

47
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
All right.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:57,800
Now they say, this one, recently somebody
told Me she paid so much money to the gentleman.

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,620
He took her into a room all alone.

50
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,500
She’s not frightened!

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,980
I mean an Indian woman would be frightened
of a man who takes her into a room alone.

52
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,129
She says, “No, no, no.

53
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,510
You’d better do whatever you like."

54
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,739
She’s not frightened.

55
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,750
She went inside the room.

56
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,959
He said, “Now take out your clothes."

57
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,970
She took out her clothes.

58
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,970
Not frightened.

59
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,580
He said, “Now you sit here, and jump.

60
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,770
Jump, jump, jump!”

61
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,880
She started jumping.

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,920
Not afraid that she’ll break her bones or
hands or feet or anything.

63
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,170
Just started jumping.

64
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,170
“Haah!

65
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,240
I feel very fine.

66
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,520
I feel very nice."

67
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,860
What are they afraid of?

68
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,130
Doing stupid things they are not afraid of,
doing nonsensical things they are not afraid

69
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,340
of, but to do sensible things they are.

70
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,060
That’s basically wrong thing.

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,300
You know in Brighton we had a nude, a nude
– what do you call that?

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,740
– swimming pool.

73
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,870
When it’s such a cold time there.

74
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,690
I don’t know why in a country which is so
cold people want to take out their clothes.

75
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,720
Some sort of – I can’t understand.

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,130
I mean in the night we sleep with all our
clothes on in a place like India.

77
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,990
What is the need to take out clothes, I still
don’t understand.

78
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,070
All right.

79
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:26,320
So, there was a, one swimming pool they started,
a very big venture, you know.

80
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,790
All the television, everything focused and
everybody watching, is for the women and men

81
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,870
who become nude.

82
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,490
What is so great?

83
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,490
Anybody can become.

84
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,160
But, there was an old lady, of My age, walking
into the water.

85
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,770
It’s very cold, you know.

86
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,850
I was wondering, “This woman will get cold
or something like that and pneumonia."

87
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,600
They said, “How do you feel?”

88
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,280
“Oh, I feel very hot."

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,640
This stupid woman was feeling hot, you know.

90
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,169
This is what it is.

91
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:01,140
“What’s wrong?”

92
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,690
To do something stupid, nonsensical they have
no fear.

93
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:14,900
How is it you think all these gurus have prospered
with all their tricks where people have become

94
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,100
mad, have become lunatics; they’ve lost
their money, sold their children out.

95
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
How?

96
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,199
For Sahaja Yoga, they’re frightened.

97
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,199
Why?

98
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,199
You see the point?

99
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,570
See the point?

100
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,800
This is exact is the character.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,080
Such people cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

102
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,650
We have to have people of strength, people
of character, people of dignity.

103
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,400
We can’t have such people who go after this
thing.

104
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,870
Like the other day, one boy came and he asked
Me all stupid questions and he was saying

105
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,699
that, “You see, what about flying in the
air?”

106
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,229
I said, “It’s all right.

107
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,460
But supposing you are suddenly dropped down.

108
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,910
What will you do?”

109
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,300
He’s willing to fly in the air.

110
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,430
Supposing, you see, he has no wings, nothing,
no parachute.

111
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,330
How will he come down?

112
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,160
Even the children understand the joke.

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,009
So this is what it is.

114
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:22,870
To be like a clown, they have no fear at all.

115
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:31,790
But to be sensible, balanced and dignified,
they’re afraid.

116
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:41,820
We are not here to ask for elections, are
we?

117
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:53,360
Sahaja Yoga is difficult – for people who
are stupid, naturally, people who want to

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,780
have a life of destruction.

119
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:08,300
It’s for people who want to evolve, people
who want to become more compassionate, affectionate,

120
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:17,330
and humble – which is very difficult.

121
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,889
Here the training is, if you are humble, anybody
will trample on you, you’ll be finished,

122
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,889
you’ll be killed.

123
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:23,889
All right?

124
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:28,120
You have to be aggressive.

125
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,560
To say an aggressive person is afraid of another
person, then you’d better change the meaning

126
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,419
of the word “aggressive."

127
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,909
I would not say only Americans, even English.

128
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,970
In English language, “I’m afraid."

129
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,970
What are they afraid?

130
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,970
Everybody is afraid of an Englishman.

131
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,569
If he comes in your house, be careful.

132
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:53,869
He’ll create problem between husband and
wife.

133
00:08:53,869 --> 00:09:00,899
What is there to be afraid?

134
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:11,929
Afraid of that is Divine, of that is blissful,
that is

135
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,209
such an advantage to you?

136
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,560
Sahaja Yoga is nothing but blessings, blessings,
blessings.

137
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,439
Nothing to sacrifice, nothing to give up,
nothing to sell out.

138
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:31,089
Even small, small things like children, their
problems, this, that is looked into.

139
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:41,439
Somebody who cares for you, Somebody who manages
things, Somebody who makes you powerful and

140
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:44,059
confident and secure.

141
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:45,950
What is there to be afraid of?

142
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,970
But the brains are upside down.

143
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,800
They are not afraid of a tiger, but afraid
of a cow.

144
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,160
What do you say to such a person?

145
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,040
Say, “What are you afraid of?”

146
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,809
“Afraid of a cow."

147
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,050
“And what you’re not afraid of?”

148
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,839
“Not of a tiger."

149
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,230
“All right.

150
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,319
It’s all right.

151
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:14,319
Sorry.

152
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,559
I’ll go to some other place."

153
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,680
That’s what you have to say.

154
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,779
I mean, this is what it is: people are just
upside down.

155
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,839
Their value system is upside down.

156
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,720
Example I’ll give you, very simple example,
this Mr.

157
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,420
Hart lost his election because they said he
had some relationship with some woman somewhere.

158
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,129
It’s so common in this country.

159
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:40,170
What is there that he should lose?

160
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:46,179
I mean, if he had done something else, like
if he had taken some money of the government

161
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,829
or must have cheated them, then it’s all
right.

162
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,239
But on a point which everybody does!

163
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:54,699
It would be tomorrow, “Why did you eat a
sausage?

164
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:58,019
That’s why it lose you."

165
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,350
It’s absurd.

166
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,879
They’re upside down.

167
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,319
Brains are upside down.

168
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:04,829
See, what is the logic?

169
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:08,459
So those who say they’re afraid, you say,
“You’re right.

170
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,369
You go and bang your head with something.

171
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,550
That would be better for you."

172
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:19,889
It’s all stories, I tell you, is the way
they put you down.

173
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:29,410
There’s nothing to be afraid from a fragrance
of the flower – it’s like that.

174
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,829
There’s … we have a guru who cannot bear
any flowers.

175
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:34,160
No fragrance.

176
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,189
But if you take the water from the gutters,
he’s very happy.

177
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,049
Now, what do you say to that?

178
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:44,269
I mean we are not here to please such people,
are we?

179
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,149
You know there’s a guru like that.

180
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:49,970
He can’t bear … He got how many Rolls
Royces?

181
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,379
Sixty-three Rolls Royces.

182
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:57,579
And they used to take gutter water for him,
instead of giving flowers.

183
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:05,699
And there are many Americans who did it, thousands
and thousands and thousands.

184
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:10,739
Imagine, to buy sixty-three Rolls Royces out
of American money.

185
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:14,239
What do you say to them?

186
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:24,279
But they’re afraid to come to Sahaja Yoga.

187
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,889
See?

188
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,609
This is self-deception.

189
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:31,290
There’s nothing hiding in Sahaja Yoga.

190
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,100
We have to say what one has to say.

191
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,470
We have to face what one has to face.

192
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,000
You should not have any conditionings about
it.

193
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,389
You should not have any ego about it.

194
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:49,300
Try to understand that this has to be understood:
that we have to be ourselves.

195
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,189
We have to grow.

196
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:54,509
Whatever is wrong within us has to go away.

197
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,410
But it’s only possible when you become the
Self.

198
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,911
Like, if I have something wrong on My sari,
I can only see it if I have eyes, otherwise

199
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:05,319
anybody says, “You’re wearing a sari which
is dirty”, I might be angry.

200
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:10,569
If I’m identified with the sari, I’ll
be angry.

201
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:12,120
But if I see, “Oh God!

202
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,959
I’d better clean it."

203
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:20,899
So it’s a vicious circle how to open their
eyes, because to open their eyes is very difficult,

204
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,269
impossible, because they are afraid.

205
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:28,930
They’re afraid of the light, happy with
the darkness.

206
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,609
Now you cannot please them.

207
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:44,519
Also, you must know that if you put the whole
American people together and all the Western

208
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:54,249
people together, we have manifold more people
say in India and other countries who will

209
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,699
become realized souls.

210
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:59,779
God doesn’t bother from where they come.

211
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:08,680
If they want to accept such horrible gurus,
let them have it and go with them.

212
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,790
As they say, “Take two running jumps and
go to Hell!”

213
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,549
That’s the attitude of the Divine, I really
tell you.

214
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:24,709
But not Mine, because I am the Mother so I
have to make the compromise between the nonsensical

215
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:30,439
people and the Divine, which is nothing but
sense.

216
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:35,179
There, that is common sense.

217
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,620
So what I have to do is to: “All right.

218
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Doesn’t matter.

219
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Let’s try.

220
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Let’s try.

221
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620
They’ll come along.

222
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
They’ll be all right.

223
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,949
They are created by God, that’s why they
are loved."

224
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,459
But not because you are seeking any elections.

225
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,329
You must realize it.

226
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:54,749
We are not the only human beings living.

227
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:57,149
We are not the topmost people.

228
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,129
Let’s see where we have gone.

229
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:07,919
I don’t want to condemn anyone as such,
because they are all My children, but I would

230
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,180
like you to see where are we.

231
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,209
We must understand, we are getting destroyed,
our children are getting destroyed, our society

232
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,079
is getting destroyed, the whole thing is getting
destroyed.

233
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,079
Where are we?

234
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,249
What’s the use of calling ourselves great?

235
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:29,149
Now AIDS, you’ll be surprised, there’s
a war on AIDS – what is the war on AIDS?

236
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:42,629
Once upon a time, you see, these tourists
used to bring their clothes and their, what

237
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:49,680
you call, sleeping bags and everything, and
sell them in the border of Nepal.

238
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,059
My daughter lives there.

239
00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:00,540
Once they got the news of AIDS, not that they
don’t purchase this, but they’ve thrown

240
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,379
everything, whatever they had in the house
and burnt it up.

241
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,179
This is the situation.

242
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:13,799
Nobody wants to kiss an American these days,
to be very frank.

243
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,649
I’ve been warned.

244
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,070
That’s what you are.

245
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,070
That’s what we are going.

246
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,910
Let’s see where are we going, relatively.

247
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,889
But we think still we are great.

248
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,730
Then who can help you?

249
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,589
You are just holding on now to something.

250
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,179
Any moment you’ll fall down.

251
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:43,829
Supposing that is the situation, then try
to understand you are in a difficult situation.

252
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:53,100
I want to warn you again, just like Vishnumaya,
be – not only that you should understand,

253
00:16:53,100 --> 00:17:01,069
but be in possession of this understanding
that we have to save others.

254
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:08,360
If they are afraid, tell them, “What are
you afraid of, stupid fellow?

255
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,819
Come along."

256
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,299
They like it, I tell you.

257
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:16,299
“But I am afraid …”

258
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:19,959
Then you also very sophisticatedly say, “Oh,
I am sorry you are afraid.

259
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,980
What are you afraid of?”

260
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,100
All right?

261
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,919
That’s how it will work.

262
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,419
Otherwise it is not going to work out.

263
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,669
I’ve tried all tricks.

264
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:37,659
Nothing works out unless you tell them, “Better
join Sahaja Yoga otherwise you’ll be destroyed

265
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:38,659
tomorrow.

266
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,970
You’ll get cancer, you’ll get AIDS, you’ll
get this.

267
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,279
If you want to save yourself, come to Sahaja
Yoga."

268
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,320
That’s what they understand, and that’s
what the gurus do to them.

269
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,940
“If you do not jump, I’ll throw you out
of the room."

270
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,520
So they start jumping.

271
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,030
It’s a fact.

272
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:03,240
Till they break their bones, they jump.

273
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:13,559
So you should know that you’re Sahaja Yogis
and that you are building up a new society

274
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,250
of people who can save others.

275
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:22,600
For that you have to know how far people have
gone, how you have to pull them out, how you

276
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,429
have to work it out.

277
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:38,309
Any style of compromise, any style of explanation,
discussion – try everything, because after

278
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:41,840
all, I don’t want them to be destroyed.

279
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,030
But don’t think what they say has any sense
in it.

280
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:53,789
You must have a higher understanding than
they are because you know that they are catching

281
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:56,330
on the Agnya and they are afraid.

282
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,700
All right?

283
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:06,789
Some of them do say – I’ve heard – that,
“Supposing we get transformed, then we cannot

284
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:10,070
enjoy the life of every day life."

285
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,980
What are you enjoying?

286
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:18,670
On the road you are walking, when I came in
Los Angeles, they told Me, “Mother, do You

287
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,370
know, serious things have happened."

288
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,230
I said, “What serious things?”

289
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,389
“On this road three people were killed last
week."

290
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:30,110
I said, “How?”

291
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,830
“Just they shot."

292
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:37,330
“What’s so great about us?”, you should
ask.

293
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,610
“Aren’t you worried about this may happen
to you – to happen to your children?

294
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,500
They’ll be killed.

295
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,760
Anybody can kill you.

296
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,419
What are you doing about it?”

297
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:55,950
Talk like that as if you understand the problem.

298
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:02,580
You express your concern, your heartfelt concern.

299
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,370
Definitely they will understand.

300
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,980
Because they told Me that “In Sahaja Yoga
it’s very bad because we’ll be transformed

301
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,340
and then we’ll not enjoy."

302
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,000
So this is what you’re enjoying on the street
– go ahead.

303
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,120
Enjoy the fear, the scariness of it.

304
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,160
You can’t make your children play in the
front door.

305
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,320
That’s what you’re enjoying?

306
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,289
They enjoy, if they’re stupid they say,
“We … this is our fundamental right to

307
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,110
be stupid."

308
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:42,960
But you have a fundamental right to enjoy
joy, to meet joy.

309
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,020
Have you met joy?

310
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,080
That’s your fundamental right: to be the
Spirit.

311
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,179
Have you become the Spirit?

312
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:57,159
It’s fundamental right – what sort of
a fundamental right it is to be stupid?

313
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:03,049
And they say it openly, shamelessly, without
any respect of yourself.

314
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:09,230
They have no respect of themselves, so they
have to first have their own respect.

315
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,970
For that, they have to understand that they’re
human beings at the epitome of evolution.

316
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,850
They don’t have to become worms now anymore.

317
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,879
All this you can talk to them the way I’m
talking to you, all of you, and tell them,

318
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,040
“See, now this is what it is.

319
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,389
What is happening?

320
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:27,690
What are we doing about it?”

321
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,690
All right?

322
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,200
Even then if they say so, all right.

323
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,000
Don’t waste your energy.

324
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:44,160
We have to work it out together.

325
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,740
Try any tricks that are possible; you are
permitted.

326
00:21:50,740 --> 00:22:00,299
But in Sahaj Yoga there’s no need to tell
lies, no need to do any harm, to torture someone.

327
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,159
There’s no need at all.

328
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:16,490
But better bring to their understanding, in
their vision, what is going to happen to the

329
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,490
country.

330
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,490
That’s your job as Sahaj Yogis.

331
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,610
I don’t want anything from you, as you know.

332
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:29,809
But, you have to understand that Mother has
given us realization, that we have become

333
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,279
Sahaj Yogis – for what?

334
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,940
We have become Sahaja Yogis to be the light,
to show them the light, show them the darkness,

335
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,049
show them the way they will fall down and
will be destroyed.

336
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:44,049
That’s our job.

337
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:45,049
All right?

338
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:46,049
May God bless you.

339
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,049
Any other question, please?

340
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,049
Question from a Yogi: I was wondering if You
could talk about what we could do to form

341
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:58,480
a school for our children here in America.

342
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:10,549
Many of us now with small children [???????]

343
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:16,740
Shri Mataji: That has been My primal problem
here.

344
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,690
I know, it’s terrible, I know!

345
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,690
You see it’s going to be very difficult
for you to have your children sent to these

346
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,990
schools because the atmosphere is so bad.

347
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:37,330
For the time being I only feel that you must
develop your children in such a manner that

348
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:46,340
they become strong, self-confident, and also
they have good examples before them, as you

349
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,600
people are – to begin with.

350
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:57,580
And you will find many Indian families are
here, but what I have seen is that the children

351
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:05,500
of at least sixty percent of Indian families
don’t learn bad things, normally.

352
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,400
This is My own experience.

353
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,730
The reason is because the Indian family people
are all the time talking to their children,

354
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:23,519
having a nice family meetings together, taking
them out, telling them about good things,

355
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:31,380
of sharing; because those people who are here
from India have had that kind of a training,

356
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,360
so they are trying to train their children
in the same way.

357
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:44,899
Now the families which are so-called “advanced”
here can beat you hollow in nonsensical things.

358
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:49,629
Because when it comes to advancement, they
don’t know how to relate it to anything

359
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:50,629
else.

360
00:24:50,629 --> 00:25:01,190
But those who are not that way, those who
have been going through a lifestyle, still

361
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:12,620
maintain their own ideas and their own behavior,
their own principles.

362
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:19,059
They are imbibed by children, and they just
think, “These are another category of people;

363
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:24,590
these are not our style, these are different."

364
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,659
They don’t change.

365
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,990
I’ve seen many families like that.

366
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,950
In the same way, first of all you must pay
full attention to your children, talk to them,

367
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,320
bring them up in such a manner that they have
another value system.

368
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:47,549
I mean, I can say about My own daughters or
grandchildren, you put them anywhere in the

369
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:53,549
world, they will never become like others,
because they have their roots.

370
00:25:53,549 --> 00:26:00,080
So you must try to make their roots very strong
into great principles.

371
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:10,350
Then they won’t be that much in difficulty.

372
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:19,960
Like as I was discussing today … people
that … see the … as I said that Indian

373
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:27,730
society has built up itself in traditional
… now ages it has built in traditions and

374
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,730
things.

375
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,100
So it must have made mistakes, trial and error
and all that.

376
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,399
But it has reached certain really some very
fine points.

377
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:43,960
One thing about children in India, say, we
don’t tell them, “Don’t touch this!

378
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,019
Don’t take this!

379
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:48,080
Don’t open this!”

380
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Never.

381
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,330
We also don’t allow them just to behave
like a bull in a china shop.

382
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,610
Supposing now I want to have a Diet Coke.

383
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,610
All right?

384
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:04,120
So I tell a child, “All right, go and get
one tin of Diet.

385
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,220
Now bring this glass.

386
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:13,200
Slowly, because it is very good, so beautiful,
you have to use it very carefully.

387
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Now keep it there.

388
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,039
Now open the can.

389
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,649
Put it in there.

390
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:22,970
Now you have bring it and give it to a friend
or anyone."

391
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,330
So the child carries it very carefully.

392
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,419
But supposing it falls down, doesn’t matter!

393
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,980
He’ll have another one.

394
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:41,129
So the child develops the deftness of handling
it, the respect for it, and not the sort of

395
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:45,039
a fear of it.

396
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,490
The cooking, same way.

397
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,039
Today there was a big complaint about the
way people cook here.

398
00:27:52,039 --> 00:28:04,230
And in the discussion then I reached a conclusion
that the mother cooks that way.

399
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:11,470
So what mothers says, all right, she … the
child doesn’t sit in the TV room if mother

400
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,970
is cooking, in Indian homes.

401
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,840
Is the child is in the TV room?

402
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,559
No, is with the mother.

403
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,429
The mother says, “All right.

404
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:22,429
Now what you do, we’ll cut some vegetables.

405
00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:23,429
I’m cutting.

406
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:24,429
Now you’d better do it.

407
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:27,951
Now whatever is left out, which is not to
be used for cooking, we’ll have to put it

408
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:28,951
in this thing.

409
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:32,190
Now, this has to go into the wastepaper basket."

410
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:38,690
And Indian kitchen is all the time clean,
spic and span, every minute.

411
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,320
Every room is spic and span.

412
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,320
House.

413
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,909
Outside, what can we do?

414
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:46,640
It’s the government, the management nonsense.

415
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,499
I mean the people here think they’re very
clean; I think they are not, only the government

416
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:55,220
is.

417
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,480
The clothes are hanging here – this, that.

418
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,480
In Indian homes, even in the poorest of poor
you go, everything looks spic and span, clean.

419
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,659
Because the child is told to keep it.

420
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:09,120
Now the child has, say, a paper in his hand.

421
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,070
He won’t throw it everywhere.

422
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,450
Carry it, take it to the … How?

423
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,080
because the mother will say, “All right,
now this paper is here.

424
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,100
Where should it go?”

425
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,289
All the time the mother and the child are
together, or the father.

426
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:24,289
All the time.

427
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:25,289
Wherever.

428
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:28,399
It’s not that the children can’t go to
this place.

429
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,059
Here the beginning itself is wrong.

430
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,980
When the little child is born, you put him
in another room and the parents are sleeping

431
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,169
in another room.

432
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,240
It’s the worse thing that you can do to
a little baby.

433
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:45,559
That’s how the child will become very insecure,
unhappy, abnormal.

434
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:57,009
In the subconscious, the child will have a
very funny feelings.

435
00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:01,809
After marriage, after having children the
parents have to accept parenthood.

436
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:10,360
They are still in the bridal dresses, or the
men are still thinking they are romantic heroes

437
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,360
going around.

438
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
You are parents now!

439
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Otherwise don’t produce children.

440
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,690
If you produce children, be parents.

441
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,820
That doesn’t mean you should become absolutely
boring type people.

442
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,360
But, take interest in your children; keep
them with you all the time; talk to them;

443
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,409
tell them how to behave.

444
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:37,100
I mean the behavior here of children is abnormally
funny I find.

445
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:45,029
For that, one has to blame the training.

446
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:48,309
And all the freedom is to be given to children.

447
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:54,549
Now the carpet is more important than child;
a door is more important, wall is more important

448
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:55,549
than the child.

449
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,610
Then what happens, when the children grow
up I’ve seen, when they go to somebody’s

450
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,929
house they start using everything as if their
own.

451
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:08,679
In their house they are very comfortably seated.

452
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:15,299
And also every way you have restrictions on
children, which sometimes shocks.

453
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:20,590
Like I’ll tell you the example of My own
granddaughter, she was telling Me that “Naani,

454
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,090
I’d invited some girls for my birthday party.

455
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,429
And you know they liked it very much.

456
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:30,260
And she asked me, ‘Can I have some more?’

457
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,460
I was surprised.

458
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,539
It was all Mummy had made for them, and she
had such a lot inside, and she was enjoying,

459
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,539
they were eating.

460
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:40,289
So they came and asked, ‘Can I have for
some more?’

461
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:45,830
They’re not beggars; they are children.

462
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,309
They should rule all their wants.

463
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,190
They should ask for.

464
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,279
But then you’ll get some toys, put them,
the toy is with the child.

465
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,059
The child doesn’t know the parents.

466
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,789
Toys, fill it up with the toys.

467
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:03,169
Then by the time you go in the garage, there’s
no place.

468
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:11,119
All the toys are kept there, you see.

469
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,690
So the whole training system is wrong.

470
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:17,429
You must take your child with you.

471
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:18,629
You must take him out.

472
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:20,190
You must show everything.

473
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,960
Who else is going to teach them?

474
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,620
I see a mother who is, say, a person who has
done, say, M.A.

475
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:35,659
in Botany, and the child doesn’t know what
is a leaf and what is a flower.

476
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:39,769
Involve them with yourself.

477
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:44,000
You go to work, tell them what happened, “You
know, today this thing happened in the work,

478
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,029
this is what."

479
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,870
They are something separate from you.

480
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,000
How can they grow?

481
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,679
At this time, they depend on you for all their
nourishment.

482
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,909
Every time.

483
00:32:54,909 --> 00:33:01,399
And in that you have to teach them how to
share things.

484
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:06,299
But I think very little time is spent with
children, which should be much more – much,

485
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,299
much more.

486
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,980
Continuously it should be.

487
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,730
I mean even My girls who are – one is forty
years of age, even now she comes and sleeps

488
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,649
with Me in the morning time.

489
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:24,590
She must hug Me, sleep with Me; and when I
come, she cries like a little baby, what to

490
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,590
do?

491
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,159
I did the same with My mother.

492
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,080
But I knew everything about My mother, and
I knew so many things that she liked and what

493
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,940
she didn’t like and what should not be done.

494
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,240
And there’s such an attachment to the mother
comes in, and father.

495
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,499
You don’t want to lose that love.

496
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:50,490
Once My daughter asked Me, when she was in
college, “I want to wear sleeveless blouses."

497
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,019
I said, “Go ahead.

498
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,019
No harm”

499
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,809
She said, “But why don’t You wear?”

500
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:55,809
I said, “I feel shy.

501
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,360
I feel shy to expose My arms."

502
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,059
Then she said immediately, “Then this is
no criteria – because I’ve asked You,

503
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,600
You should say ‘yes’ to me?

504
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,200
No, that’s not good."

505
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,470
She, herself, corrected herself.

506
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:19,490
So first a complete integration of the children
with yourself.

507
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:25,571
Now, the films – they have films for children,
for adolescents then I don’t know what else

508
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:26,659
is there.

509
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,790
No, all the films should be for everyone.

510
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,790
But if you have to show filthy stuff, then
you have to have it after twelve o’clock

511
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,020
in the night.

512
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,040
Why to see filthy stuff?

513
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,890
Whatever you’re children cannot see, why
should you see?

514
00:34:46,890 --> 00:35:00,829
It’s not something very mature, is it, that
you want to see and the children can’t see.

515
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:07,930
So the whole shifting starts, like a mother
is seeing the very mature thing is about God,

516
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,300
is about some great Incarnation, of some philosophy.

517
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,809
Children are also sitting.

518
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:19,970
And they start asking, “What is collective
consciousness?” at a very young age.

519
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,450
“What is Chaitanya?

520
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,450
What is Omkara?”

521
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,710
The whole attention moves to something else.

522
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,080
Otherwise you show them the thing for the
children in that they show you this doll coming

523
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,670
today, that doll.

524
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,740
“Mommy, I must have that doll!”

525
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,450
Get them the doll and be finished with them.

526
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,530
That’s wonderful.

527
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,900
Bring their attention out of all these things.

528
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:47,880
See these all medias, everything, are working
on your children morning till evening.

529
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,520
Now they have a doll in America which even
have a birth date.

530
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:58,570
And then you have to join a club, and for
that club you have to pay so much, so much

531
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,570
dollars.

532
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:06,349
Then you become a member of that, and they
write to you, “What is the name for the

533
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:12,020
child and when was she christened, and this
and that."

534
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,940
They are playing upon your children.

535
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,000
And you are happy as long as children don’t
trouble you, and when they trouble you in

536
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,240
England – I don’t know in America what
do they do – they kill their children.

537
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,670
Then the children kill them.

538
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:34,140
Whole thing is upside down.

539
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:44,450
India it might happen if they become developed
and advanced.

540
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:47,520
So we are different people; we come out of
it.

541
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,050
Now let’s start another way.

542
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,570
Let’s not identify ourselves with that nonsense.

543
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,930
Let’s be something extraordinary.

544
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:01,940
Let’s make our children something different.

545
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:08,990
That’s what is to be given to your children,
not money, wealth, toys.

546
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,110
No!

547
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,220
Personality.

548
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,339
Roots.

549
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,850
You are their roots.

550
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:20,710
If you are shifty like this, how do you expect
your children to be all right?

551
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,420
You have to nourish them.

552
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,770
All right?

553
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:32,380
So first of all, the education of the child
starts with the father, mother and the family

554
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,740
– and the respect for elders.

555
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:40,680
Supposing your father is there, your mother
is in the house, and if you will ill treat

556
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:46,030
your parents, they will ill treat you, naturally.

557
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:55,049
There is a very interesting story: There was
an old lady and she had a father-in-law who

558
00:37:55,049 --> 00:38:04,160
was very old, and the son always used to carry
his broth in a bowl made of ordinary clay.

559
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,920
And she used to treat him like a dog, the
daughter-in-law.

560
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:17,820
One day that broke, and this boy fell down
and it broke and he started crying.

561
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,490
So the mother thought he’s very badly hurt
the way he was crying.

562
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,230
He said, “No, I am not hurt, but this thing
is broken."

563
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,100
“So why are you crying for that?

564
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,530
We can get another one."

565
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,590
“Sure you can get another one?”

566
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,670
She said, “Yes."

567
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:38,109
“You know because I was worried how will
I give you food when you will be old.

568
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:47,500
That’s what I was worried, that when I have
to send you food, how will I manage?”

569
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:53,240
Then she understood.

570
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:00,680
How you treat others, how you behave towards
others, how you live neatly, clean ways and

571
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,290
things – that’s what children learn.

572
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:10,460
Greatest thing, more than precepts, are practices.

573
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,910
Here the husband, wife will quarrel in the
presence of children, beat each other.

574
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,400
Can you imagine?

575
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,480
I’ve seen that.

576
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,070
I mean if you see any film these days, it’s
the quarrel between husband and wife – put

577
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,109
this way, that way, that way, this way, this
way, that way.

578
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:31,530
That’s all, get fed up with it.

579
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:37,740
No respect, no love, no affection.

580
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,500
Or some sort of a destruction.

581
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,480
Then the children, themselves, don’t want
to see any picture.

582
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,160
You see, when My daughters were small, I would
only take them to religious picture like Shri

583
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,420
Rama’s life, this, that, and all that.

584
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,200
So they developed a taste for that.

585
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,710
So when they went home to My mother’s place
they said, “We will not go to this picture.

586
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,360
If there is any Ramas, Hanumanas, then we’ll
go."

587
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:11,400
So My sister said, “You see, first of all
we can’t leave them alone in the house.

588
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,440
You can’t take them to any picture, they
don’t like any other picture but that of

589
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
God’s pictures.

590
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,099
So, I mean there are not so many, so what
to do?”

591
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:23,140
I said, “All right, why don’t you also
see with them the same?”

592
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:32,579
She said, “But there are some nice social
pictures, but they don’t like it."

593
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:38,780
So what sort of books you give them, what
sort of things you talk to them – always

594
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,089
be with them, keep them with you.

595
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:41,369
That’s the best.

596
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:45,920
Or even if they have to go to some school,
it should be a school where there’s love,

597
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,150
affection, good company, they talk of Sahaj
Yoga, sort of a thing.

598
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:55,789
I wish you could start a school of Sahaja
Yoga in America.

599
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,760
But you know how difficult it is to start
anything sensible?

600
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,490
Everybody is afraid.

601
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:07,320
But if you want to start a school of nonsensical
things, they’ll give you grants.

602
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,849
It’s very difficult, even in England – same
thing, can’t start a school.

603
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:22,299
If you want to start some sort of a disco,
it’s very easy.

604
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:26,049
Many schools are closing down in England.

605
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:31,270
Actually, there was a school for sale.

606
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,380
I wanted to buy in My own simple ideas.

607
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,110
They said, “Mother, first think why it is
closed."

608
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,110
I said, “Why?”

609
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,520
“Because of the different rules and regulations,
it is closed."

610
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:52,910
I said, “Then, you’re great grandchildren
might be able to go to that school.

611
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,530
It will take so much time."

612
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,780
So first thing I’ll say, you should look
after your children.

613
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,690
Tell them when it is wrong, you must tell
them, “This is wrong, it should not be done."

614
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,910
Like your child doesn’t respect others,
you must tell them.

615
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:18,480
If he doesn’t do, if he spoils something
or does something wrong to others, then you

616
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
must tell him.

617
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,089
If he doesn’t share things, you must tell,
“You must share your doll.

618
00:42:24,089 --> 00:42:26,759
You must share this."

619
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:34,100
But when it comes to correcting him for nonsensical
things, you should not.

620
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,600
You’ll see, it will change.

621
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,109
Then later on, of course, we have to think
of school and all that, trying to do something.

622
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:47,040
Let’s work it out, maybe, then we’ll take
over.

623
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,500
Basically they should be all right.

624
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,839
Otherwise, they come to India and slap all
the teachers.

625
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,410
What’s the use?

626
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,980
It’s not easy.

627
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,960
Western children are not easy, you know, to
manage.

628
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:09,980
Actually, then definitely they’ll be frightened
of western children coming to India – rather

629
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,160
difficult.

630
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,900
Because you must discipline them.

631
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:20,940
And the main thing is, they should like the
discipline, they should want the discipline.

632
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,180
That’s how you should be.

633
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,200
This stupid idea of freedom, means license,
should go out.

634
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,619
They should like it.

635
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:39,240
I remember My parents, the way they disciplined
us, we would like it.

636
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:46,339
Any child would remember that, “Oh my father,
very particular."

637
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:51,890
But here they’ll call a twelve-year-old
son – I know a friend of ours, such a shocking

638
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:52,890
story!

639
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,220
The lady come to -friend means in the official
way.

640
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,950
She came to London and she said, “Have you
seen the pubs?”

641
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,359
I said, “No."

642
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:04,710
“Wonderful, interesting pubs in London."

643
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,119
I said, “Really?”

644
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,940
She had a list of them.

645
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,200
She said, “The best is this one."

646
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,859
I said, “What is so special?”

647
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:16,500
“It’s called as the Hermit’s Pub."

648
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,490
“So what is great?”

649
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:25,080
“You see, a man died in this place, and
people did not know for months together.

650
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:32,319
Then the smell started coming out, so they
came in, took him away and buried him.

651
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,359
But all the cobwebs and all the smell is still
retained.

652
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,320
And that’s the most expensive pub in London."

653
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,490
I said, “Oh God.

654
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,660
What’s this going on?”

655
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:52,170
This lady said, “You know, we are very free
with our children.

656
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,760
We allow them to do what they like."

657
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,770
And she had two sons, I think – one was
twelve-year-old and one was eleven-year-old.

658
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:04,030
And these husband, wife were sleeping upstairs,
in America.

659
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:12,079
These two children were having a party, and
the father had given them alcohol, beer, all

660
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,880
open drink.

661
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,359
“Oh, enjoy, we are one!”

662
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,140
And these children of that age group started
drinking, and then I don’t know what happened

663
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:28,170
to them, they put fire to some alcohol and
the whole house was burnt.

664
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,060
One child ran out, eleven-year-old.

665
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:37,980
The mother, father, one son all died and so
many children.

666
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:45,740
This is no freedom.

667
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:53,599
You have to teach your children discretion;
you have to teach them.

668
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,050
This is what one has to learn.

669
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,751
So I think before starting a school for children,
let us start a school for parents.

670
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:01,751
What do you say?

671
00:46:01,751 --> 00:46:02,751
All right.

672
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,751
What is next?

673
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:13,220
Ursula: Shri Mataji, You had suggested that
we can try many tricks, or different tricks

674
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:26,950
for approaching seekers to find our brothers
and sisters.

675
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,950
And in Australia, when someone has …

676
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:29,950
Shri Mataji: No, no, no.

677
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,950
I can’t hear you.

678
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:31,950
Just come here.

679
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,950
Yes, Ursula.

680
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,950
What is it?

681
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:42,890
Ursula: You had suggested that we could try
many tricks to find our brothers and sisters,

682
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,710
and different ways and approaches.

683
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:55,020
And in Australia, each idea seems to be … they’re
so enthusiastic and they, they support the

684
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,240
idea.

685
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:11,013
And this is, I don’t know if it’s just
my feeling, but there’s a feeling here that

686
00:47:11,013 --> 00:47:14,180
when there’s a suggestion or an idea we’re
very “Oh, no."

687
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,430
One person may say, “Yes, good idea."

688
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:17,760
Another person may say “No, no."

689
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,500
And then you don’t want to do anything wrong,
so you just don’t do anything, you just

690
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,500
wait.

691
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,500
And then nothing happens.

692
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Shri Mataji: Among Sahaj Yogis, you mean to
say?

693
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Ursula: Among Sahaj Yogis.

694
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,900
Shri Mataji: See, it comes from the individualistic
attitude about ourselves.

695
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,700
I mean anything you tell them, they cannot
live collectively, that we know in the West.

696
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,630
I know what I have to go through when we have
to organize their programs with three hundred

697
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,280
people coming, this and that.

698
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:55,200
But … this individualism is so much, like
every bathroom has a different tap.

699
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,750
You’d better ask somebody, otherwise you’ll
land up into difficulties.

700
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:07,760
Even the ties have to be different; everything
has to be different.

701
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:14,099
Now, if there’s something fundamental, then
you can ask your leader.

702
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,920
But if it is something mundane, all right.

703
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,920
You want blue color?

704
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,920
I have blue.

705
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,089
You want red?

706
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:20,160
Have red.

707
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,910
Like that you can solve your problem.

708
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:27,412
If it is something fundamental, then you should
ask your leader.

709
00:48:27,412 --> 00:48:39,619
But if it is something which is not fundamental,
which is very simple, let them have their

710
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:41,690
own way, then gradually they’ll grow into
it.

711
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,010
Because this is the basic problem of this
country is.

712
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,890
So-called individualism makes them feel that,
“Oh, this mine.

713
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:51,130
I’ll do it the way I like."

714
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:54,430
Now say a motor car has a different handle.

715
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:59,480
Now a person who’s sitting inside must know
what sort of a handle it is.

716
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,680
Tomorrow something happens, you can’t even
open it.

717
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,020
Otherwise, they’re not at all individualistic,
I’ll tell you how.

718
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,490
Like in India, supposing I’m wearing this
sari.

719
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,640
Maybe there’s another sari like that.

720
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,100
If another lady’s wearing the same sari,
she’ll go and change and come back.

721
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,090
She won’t wear the same sari.

722
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:26,400
But, here when fashion, if somebody’s … now
that our Princess of Wales has this kind of

723
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,619
a hairstyle, all English girl’s have the
same hairstyle.

724
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,859
You don’t know from one to another.

725
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:36,390
So what is so individual about them?

726
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,390
If some fashion starts, now this is the fashion,
very fashionable.

727
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,529
What is fashionable?

728
00:49:41,529 --> 00:49:45,819
Is to cut your hair this way and make a punk.

729
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:47,300
So everybody is a punk.

730
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,760
Suddenly you find Sahaja Yogis walking as
punks, you want to know who is who.

731
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,059
So what is the individual character there?

732
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,930
Where is the individuality?

733
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:05,609
On principles you should be individuals – on
principles, and not on artificial things.

734
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:07,980
Now this one has a principle.

735
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,059
Supposing I’m wearing this sari.

736
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:16,530
It’s made by hand, it’s one designed by
one person.

737
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,289
So I’m giving importance to one person.

738
00:50:18,289 --> 00:50:22,190
Now he might have made two or three or four
at the most.

739
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:32,309
Now if somebody repeats the same sari, that
means I have not encouraged that man so much.

740
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:37,520
Like you can have the same sari made out of
a, say, machine.

741
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,950
Then you’ll start, “All right have ten
saris like this, twenty saris like this, all

742
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,480
made by machines."

743
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:51,510
But here, because we want to have a sari separate,
it has to be made with hand.

744
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,150
In principle, see?

745
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:58,030
How it helps!

746
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:04,520
This is what it is.

747
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,710
In principle you should be collective; in
principle you should be individualistic.

748
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:13,619
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t want you dressed
up the same way.

749
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,890
I mean I don’t want Americans to go about
like something Chinese.

750
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:24,270
Let us have our own dress, dress up the way
we like, everything.

751
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:26,309
That’s all right.

752
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:28,359
It’s nothing important.

753
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:31,510
But in principle, we have to be the same.

754
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:38,980
One principle nourishes the tree – the sap.

755
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,480
It has many flowers, fruits.

756
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,020
It has many leaves, it’s all right – outside.

757
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,960
So in principle you have to be collective.

758
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,960
All right?

759
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,960
For mundane things, why to fight?

760
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:06,140
But in any case, somebody who is an elder,
who knows better, who’s wiser – listen

761
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,130
to that person.

762
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:14,670
We always have an awe, and a respect for elders.

763
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:19,559
Like I see, thank God, you have now Sherayu,
supposing – take one case, individual case.

764
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:23,400
She’s come all the way from India, now she’s
staying.

765
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,390
She knows quite a lot about pujas, things
like that.

766
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,309
She knows how to do many things.

767
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:33,540
You should be prepared to know from her.

768
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,470
Otherwise sometimes it’s very embarrassing
the way things happen.

769
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,839
Now she’s here, she can teach you.

770
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,359
There’s nothing wrong in learning.

771
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,150
She has learned many things from you.

772
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:44,359
But there’s no respect, I think sometimes,
for her, at all.

773
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:46,720
She’s an auntie somewhere sitting on the
shelf.

774
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,630
No, she’s here for a purpose, one should
learn, respect.

775
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:56,440
But that doesn’t mean you be her slave or
anything, but you gain something out of her.

776
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,260
Another person who comes here should learn.

777
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,720
Like from Americans, we have to learn a lot.

778
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,660
Tell Me what.

779
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:10,500
Yogini: I don’t think we’re doing much
about communication.

780
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,099
Shri Mataji: The communication is not there
because of individualism.

781
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:16,369
But, that’s not so.

782
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:22,880
There’s no individualism at all, because
I’ve seen, once the fashion starts, everybody

783
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,880
looks the same.

784
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,520
The other day I came, I saw ladies looking
like men with muscles like this, walking like

785
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,520
that.

786
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,809
I said, “What sort of creature is this?”

787
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:35,809
One came, two came, three came, five came,
ten came.

788
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:37,410
“What’s this going on?”

789
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,619
I didn’t understand.

790
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:41,180
They are all walking like that, like Draculas.

791
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,190
I said, “What is this?”

792
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,701
“Oh, this is fashionable."

793
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:46,701
What is fashionable?

794
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,869
“They’re developing their muscles."

795
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:52,410
What’s the principle?

796
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:57,119
(continued on second cassette)

797
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,480
That’s it.

798
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,400
So, in such things we do not argue.

799
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:09,000
Means in stupidity we don’t argue, but in
sensible things we argue.

800
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,089
In sensible things – we have to understand
what is sensible.

801
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:17,060
After all, we are realized souls; we are not
like other people.

802
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,079
We must understand what is good.

803
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:21,200
When I say something, you agree.

804
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,830
I don’t know how.

805
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:26,830
You like it.

806
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,230
I may say something also which may not be
so palatable, but you like it.

807
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:34,180
See, think must have it, it’s a medicine.

808
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:41,240
In the same way, one should see to things
which you may not like so much, because maybe

809
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:51,069
you’re conditioned, but see to the sense
of it, the common sense, the balance.

810
00:54:51,069 --> 00:54:57,029
You can understand, and you have something
very great called vibrations.

811
00:54:57,029 --> 00:55:01,039
But even that also, I have seen, horrible
things they do.

812
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:08,269
Some people went – husband, wife – went
to stay with some lady because her husband

813
00:55:08,269 --> 00:55:09,750
had gone to India.

814
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:14,130
Threw all her furniture out, all her carpets
out, everything out.

815
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:16,519
I said, “Why did you do it?”

816
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:17,519
“Very bad vibrations."

817
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:18,519
I said, “Really?

818
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:22,440
Now will you please pay for all that – for
the bad vibrations."

819
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,070
I mean anybody else’s things, who are you
to decide good or bad vibrations?

820
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,430
You look after your own vibrations.

821
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:35,960
So they also sometimes use the vibrations
just to, sort of, express their ego.

822
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:45,720
So let us try on ourselves, everyone, “Am
I doing it just for ego’s sake?

823
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,470
Am I quarreling because of ego?

824
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,299
Am I saying ‘no’ for ego?”

825
00:55:51,299 --> 00:55:54,590
As far as possible, try to concede.

826
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:57,950
You’ll feel much better.

827
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:02,990
You’ll learn much more.

828
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:08,380
I mean, I’ve learned so many things since
I’ve been abroad, I mean, I didn’t know

829
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,380
so many things.

830
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,420
I don’t know even now.

831
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:17,339
For example, I didn’t know how to operate
a TV.

832
00:56:17,339 --> 00:56:21,440
Even now, I don’t know much about it.

833
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,440
Really.

834
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:28,029
I didn’t know how to operate a telephone
of a particular type.

835
00:56:28,029 --> 00:56:32,449
So, I had to learn.

836
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:40,030
I had to learn how to book a ticket, which
I don’t do even now, but still I have to

837
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,030
learn.

838
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,930
So many things I have to learn, and whatever
I can learn I would like to learn.

839
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:53,980
Cooking I know, but I never knew how to wash
utensils because in India they, I mean normally

840
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,980
you have servants.

841
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:59,500
But I learned it – your style with fairy
liquid.

842
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,510
I had to learn.

843
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,039
There’s nothing wrong in it.

844
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:08,100
So one must try to learn, than to argue.

845
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:14,619
Ursula: In Australia, the enthusiasm and the
joy that they have!

846
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:23,640
And if someone has an idea for something,
there’s just so much support for that, that

847
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,900
they all go out to help each other.

848
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,340
It becomes a very big, collective effort.

849
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,480
Shri Mataji: But Australia, Australians are
very wise people.

850
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,520
They understand wisdom.

851
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,279
That’s what we have to be – wise, very
wise.

852
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:43,269
And if any Indian is there, they try to ask,
“how do you do?”

853
00:57:43,269 --> 00:57:48,819
Particular things, on principle as a puja
things, they’ll ask an Indian.

854
00:57:48,819 --> 00:57:51,200
But booking the seats, never ask Indians.

855
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,690
They’re no good.

856
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:58,569
Cooking, kitchen, cleaning – very good.

857
00:57:58,569 --> 00:58:00,059
Maintaining house – all right.

858
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,640
Looking after children – all right.

859
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,920
But driving a car, an Indian?

860
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,000
Save Me.

861
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,779
I would never sit in a car which is driven
by an Indian in America.

862
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:14,630
Because crazy the way people drive.

863
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:19,710
You know this fellow won’t know how to do
it.

864
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:26,900
So it is just wisdom and discretion one has
to use, and not to fight.

865
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:31,200
It happens, I’m happy, I’ve seen this
in Australians.

866
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:38,029
They were declared as people of – people
who were criminals, the children of criminals.

867
00:58:38,029 --> 00:58:40,320
They are so sensible.

868
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:46,780
Discretion must be used, that’s important.

869
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,940
It’s sad.

870
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:59,710
But it will be all right, I’m sure one day.

871
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,390
Never argue on things which doesn’t involve
any principle.

872
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:07,050
It’s the best way; it’s the happiest.

873
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:13,700
Even now, you see today it was so warm.

874
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,140
I wanted to wear a cotton sari, you see.

875
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,180
But My children said, “No, must wear this
one."

876
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,180
I said, “Wore it."

877
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,180
I was perspiring, this, that.

878
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,160
All right, doesn’t matter, what’s the
difference, perspire for a while.

879
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,609
Came out with this sari.

880
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:28,359
They liked it, so it’s all right to please
them.

881
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:32,170
Nothing, no principle is involved in it.

882
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:37,940
When you think about others, then you will
get rid of this problem.

883
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:44,440
But so many people try to preach also Sahaja
Yoga to others.

884
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,460
They should not.

885
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,530
It’s a very serious thing, they will start
teaching.

886
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:53,839
It need not be taught that way – then people
don’t like it.

887
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:59,910
But your own behavior, in your own character,
in your own responses, people should see “this

888
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,769
person is like this."

889
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:04,089
And they should imbibe it.

890
01:00:04,089 --> 01:00:14,460
That’s the point, I think what we lack is
discretion.

891
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,500
If you are discrete, you will learn very fast,
it’s not difficult.

892
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,539
Ursula: We still can be very judgmental of
newcomers.

893
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:28,740
If they have particular problems, we get all
… it’s hard.

894
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:33,200
Shri Mataji: The newcomers.

895
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,320
Agreed.

896
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:39,010
With the newcomers, you should not be harsh
with them.

897
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,680
You should be kind, you should try to understand
this thing.

898
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:50,390
But, you know still, I tell you sometimes
… The other day I had some boy who had come,

899
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,390
all right?

900
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,529
He asked Me at least twenty questions.

901
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:57,539
I answered them properly – this thing, that
thing.

902
01:00:57,539 --> 01:01:09,990
And he got so pampered, he sent Me news, “I
don’t want to become Sahaja Yogi."

903
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:17,960
I mean, but for Me, anybody would box his
nose, for such an answer.

904
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:23,640
You see, you have to take it in a stride.

905
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,420
Situation is so bad; situation is very bad.

906
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:32,530
Must understand we are on a warpath, whatever
is possible, we can do it.

907
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:35,170
But every country has improved so much.

908
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:42,329
So what’s wrong here is: people don’t
want to learn; people don’t want to understand

909
01:01:42,329 --> 01:01:48,650
the sacrifice of giving up your ego, giving
up your decisions.

910
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:51,260
“All right, let’s see, let’s see."

911
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,260
Like that.

912
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,309
That’s why it doesn’t grow.

913
01:01:54,309 --> 01:02:00,450
Now one thing I must say, in America if you
have My program, hall will be full, I won’t

914
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,380
be able to enter in, and when I get out, I’ll
be pushed out like a piston.

915
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,609
I’ve seen it.

916
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:10,349
It’s the people are so much I don’t know
how to get in and how get out.

917
01:02:10,349 --> 01:02:11,470
It’s terrible!

918
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:15,950
And when I go away, they just disappear.

919
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:25,860
Because, there’s something lacking – of
course, I agree – among Sahaj Yogis, that

920
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,860
we have to see.

921
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:31,650
After all, nothing special about Me as such,
I mean, they just see My photograph and come

922
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,190
to the programs and sit down there.

923
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:37,599
Even if I have three days program, it goes
on increasing.

924
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,869
While there are Sahaj Yogis who may not even
be able to have one person in the hall.

925
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:45,759
What’s the reason?

926
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,640
They don’t know Me.

927
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,640
All right?

928
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,450
So there’s something lacking in us, also,
when the newcomers come in, how we treat them,

929
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,680
we talk to them, how we appeal to them.

930
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,210
Once in awhile of course there will be somebody
who will rude.

931
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,210
Doesn’t matter.

932
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,490
But try to be nice to them.

933
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:08,430
On the whole I think the newcomers – I won’t
tell all these things to a newcomer if he

934
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,430
comes.

935
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:13,250
If a newcomer come I say, “Oh, very nice.

936
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,150
How are you?

937
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,420
This, that."

938
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,690
You see?

939
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,599
Settle him down.

940
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:26,089
Any other fundamental differences you find,
you can ask Me – fundamental.

941
01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:45,160
Yogi: I’m just little curious about, well,
future little bit.

942
01:03:45,160 --> 01:04:18,640
Are You going to manifest Yourself in some
different way as Shri Kalki?

943
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:40,619
Or are You going to sort of let the change
happen a little more gradually?

944
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,960
Shri Mataji: Direct questions.

945
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,750
You tell Me, what should I do?

946
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,820
Tell Me, what should I do?

947
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,150
Any other form won’t be suitable.

948
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,180
Try any other form.

949
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:58,940
Take Shri Krishna’s form, You have to take
the Sudarshana and just kill off all those

950
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,259
who don’t believe in Sahaja Yoga.

951
01:05:02,259 --> 01:05:04,779
Is it all right?

952
01:05:04,779 --> 01:05:07,930
Take form of Jesus Christ.

953
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:14,190
Hang Yourself nicely, finish with everyone.

954
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,569
Then think of Kalki.

955
01:05:17,569 --> 01:05:21,970
Finish everything.

956
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:27,180
After doing all this work, beautifully creating
all this world so beautifully, don’t you

957
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:32,690
think One should manage it, try to manage
it, as far as possible?

958
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,300
That’s My style.

959
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:38,470
Which one would you prefer?

960
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,579
(Laughter from the yogis)

961
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:43,279
Shri Mataji: What did he say?

962
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:47,329
Voice from the crowd: He likes Your style,
Mother.

963
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:48,670
Shri Mataji: Aha!

964
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:49,670
That’s it.

965
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:52,250
You see that’s what – nothing else.

966
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:57,809
Of course you should know that Kalki’s acting,
everybody’s acting, everybody’s acting

967
01:05:57,809 --> 01:06:03,349
but is on a low key, as they say.

968
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:10,209
One has to be very careful; it’s a very
delicate job.

969
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:12,940
So many are lost.

970
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,960
These gurus have taken over so many.

971
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,100
It’s a very, very delicate job.

972
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,820
All right?

973
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:33,760
But if necessary, I can do something.

974
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,069
Now, any other question?

975
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:49,029
What time is your dinner?

976
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:50,940
Any other question?

977
01:06:50,940 --> 01:07:11,220
Yogi: Mother, it seems that many of us here
don’t really know about the Hamsa Chakra,

978
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:19,250
in terms of understanding how it relates to
the Vishuddhi and what we can do to strengthen

979
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,410
our Vishuddhi.

980
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:28,680
Shri Mataji: Hamsa Chakra stands between Vishuddhi
and Agnya as you can see clearly positioned

981
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,680
like that.

982
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:36,740
But from Vishuddhi there are many nerves which
pass through Hamsas and end up here.

983
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,300
They don’t all go to the brain.

984
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:48,839
Or we can say that at this time, at this point,
all our reactions which are what you call

985
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:53,680
reflex reactions finish off.

986
01:07:53,680 --> 01:08:03,250
So supposing now I get some dirty smell, I’ll
close My nose like that, or if I can’t hear,

987
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:09,349
I’ll just pull My ears like this; or if
I see something dirty, or if I see something

988
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:12,380
jarring, My eyes will close automatically.

989
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:17,089
If somebody tries to put a pin through Me,
immediately I’ll … spontaneously, it’s

990
01:08:17,089 --> 01:08:26,890
all built in, within My system, and your system,
too, that you react with reflex action.

991
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:28,810
Same thing may not happen to animals.

992
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,420
Animals are different.

993
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:36,160
Some animals have certain reflex actions,
some have some reflex actions; but we are

994
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:41,790
different and our reflex actions we are all
practically just the same.

995
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:43,750
There’s not much individuality.

996
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:48,340
There isn’t much difference in our reflex
actions.

997
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,660
At the most, with conditioning somebody might
say “Yah!”, somebody might say “Oh!”,

998
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,430
somebody might say something – that’s
different.

999
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:59,590
But the reflex actions are just the same.

1000
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:07,040
So up to the reflex action, we don’t have
to use discretion.

1001
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,010
Then starts our discretion part.

1002
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:14,820
Discretion starts when we are using these
two nadis which meet here, without going to

1003
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,820
the Agnya.

1004
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:27,540
So when these two nadis meet here, what happens
we start seeing through our experiences.

1005
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:33,140
First would be a reflex action, automatic
reflex action.

1006
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:39,000
The second is when, supposing a child, if
you tell the child, “Now this is hot; don’t

1007
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,710
put your hand there”, he won’t listen.

1008
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:42,870
Put the child.

1009
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:47,430
With experience, he will develop reflex actions,
the conditionings of it.

1010
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,760
So thus reflexes are built in within us.

1011
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:58,130
Also, they are built in within us with, we
should say, with other conditionings like,

1012
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:07,200
you see, in a country supposing there’s
racialism, or in a country like ours there’s

1013
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,530
a caste system.

1014
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:14,060
Then person react according to what they have
learned from childhood.

1015
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:20,630
All these conditionings could be of the present
day, when you are born.

1016
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:24,790
You could have been, yourself, born in last
life in, say, Africa.

1017
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:31,560
Today you are born with a white skin, so you
have started sort of calling that African

1018
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,790
you have become.

1019
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:39,950
All these conditionings can be built in, into
your Hamsa Chakra, which have come from your

1020
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:48,200
training of the mind, you can say the experiences
of the mind, the experiences of the society,

1021
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:54,520
of your knowledge, of your education, the
way you’re conditioned can be built in here

1022
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,960
– in the Hamsa Chakra.

1023
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,830
And it reacts to things which has no meaning.

1024
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,200
If you were … “I hate someone!”

1025
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,200
Why?

1026
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:14,870
Because that person wears a blue jean, or
something; or you can say a green shirt.

1027
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,110
Now this is built in your mind.

1028
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:22,870
Or sometimes this falling in love, also, comes
from the same kind of a conditioning.

1029
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:29,690
Supposing you had met somebody who had, say,
blue eyes and was kind to you.

1030
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:34,130
So you have fascination for a person who has
blue eyes.

1031
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:40,970
There’s no pure idea about beauty; there’s
no pure idea of happiness; there’s no pure

1032
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,970
idea of esthetics.

1033
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,200
All is condition.

1034
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:52,140
For some people, this is beautiful; for somebody,
this is not beautiful.

1035
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:59,830
So this is the place where these interchanges
take place between both the nadis, and here

1036
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:05,690
the Hamsa lies outside the path of Kundalini.

1037
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:12,310
They sort of come out here, out of the path
of Kundalini.

1038
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,960
It’s very surprising.

1039
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:20,250
When the Kundalini moves, She goes from Vishuddhi
direct to Agnya.

1040
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:25,730
Now, how can we improve our Hamsa then?

1041
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:32,940
It’s a big problem, because if our Hamsa
is sick, is over-conditioned.

1042
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:37,390
The Kundalini cannot work on it; it just gives
up.

1043
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:43,570
Now, so for Hamsa we use all these physical
things.

1044
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:48,800
Like I said, put the ghee in the nose.

1045
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:54,920
Keep it in a way that it is nourished properly.

1046
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,430
Because Kundalini, if it tries to too much
attack the Hamsa, it will have problem.

1047
01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:07,930
Problem because, as it is most of our time
we spend in such a manner that your Hamsa

1048
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:14,960
things become – what you call the epithelial
cells, the linings – become dried out.

1049
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:29,040
When the Kundalini rises, She may try to create
a problem more for that dryness – maybe.

1050
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:36,990
So it is kept out, but it has an effect in
the sense that even if there is a light outside,

1051
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:40,600
it can fall inside.

1052
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:45,950
So it’s not the Kundalini directly that
affects your Hamsa.

1053
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:57,230
It is like when the Kundalini awakens, you
yourself see now that a person is, whether

1054
01:13:57,230 --> 01:14:02,710
he is fair complexion or dark complexion,
he is a human being.

1055
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:08,910
You reason it out and Hamsa clears up.

1056
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:15,200
Then you see yourself that, “Oh, I’m very
egoistical."

1057
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:22,260
You start seeing yourself through your Agnya,
start seeing that, “I’m so conditioned."

1058
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:31,340
So you reason it out, and that’s how you
correct your conditionings.

1059
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:33,270
This is what is Hamsa Chakra.

1060
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:41,340
So Hamsa Chakra cannot be done if just you’re
a realized soul, but is an effect, is the

1061
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:46,180
symptom of your Kundalini awakening.

1062
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:54,560
Some people think that you develop discretion
just as the Kundalini rises.

1063
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,180
Is a wrong idea.

1064
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:58,180
No.

1065
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:03,740
That has to be deliberately seen that you
build up that discretion within yourself.

1066
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:11,240
But once it is built – for example My discretion
is absolute, I just know what it is.

1067
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:18,640
You see My conditioning here is absolute,
is one with the Kundalini, one with reality.

1068
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,390
But for human beings, it has to be reflected
by understanding.

1069
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:28,010
Like a child who touches something hot, then
it is hot.

1070
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:31,080
Now this is hot, because it’s heated up.

1071
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:35,170
So you see a person is catching on the right
heart.

1072
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:36,170
Right.

1073
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:40,510
He’s catching on the right heart means he’s
got a right heart, and he is suffering from

1074
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:42,830
such and such thing.

1075
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,940
You have to see it yourself.

1076
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:47,930
Now if you tell the person, “Are you suffering
from, say, asthma?”

1077
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:50,750
He says, “Yes, how do you know?”

1078
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:55,910
“I know it because I’ve learned it through
my finger which was burning, that’s why

1079
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,350
I know it is."

1080
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:04,000
But supposing somebody has an asthma and in
that plays the part your Kundalini, you will

1081
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,990
get asthma immediately.

1082
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:08,560
You see the point?

1083
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:14,630
The conditioning cannot come to us unless
and until it passes through, or sieves through,

1084
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:16,710
our reasoning and understanding.

1085
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:19,180
Are you understand the point?

1086
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,240
It cannot work.

1087
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:28,470
The reason is, it filters your collective
consciousness.

1088
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:35,850
Otherwise, you go near a person who has AIDS,
and you become collectively conscious that

1089
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:37,270
he has AIDS.

1090
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:47,310
And if you imbibe all that into you as a conditioning,
you will get it.

1091
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:49,000
But you are separated.

1092
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,030
Like person who reads a – there’s a very
nice story about this, Jerome has written.

1093
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:59,950
Like one man, he went and read Materia Medica.

1094
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:06,020
Went and told doctor that, “Doctor I have
all the diseases except for one, which is

1095
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,020
housewife’s knee.

1096
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,950
He said, “How is it you haven’t got it?”

1097
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,250
“Because I am not a housewife."

1098
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:16,300
So he got conditioned into all the diseases.

1099
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:22,740
That’s how many people get diseases, but
thank God there’s a filter.

1100
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:28,610
If somebody has a disease, you don’t get
it, because you can filter it.

1101
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:32,750
But Hamsa Chakra could be affected by baddhas.

1102
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:40,420
That’s one problem, if some baddha passes
through the nose, you might; some viruses

1103
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,400
pass through the nose, you might.

1104
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,100
Affected, means it can get sick.

1105
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:51,980
But one must understand the discrimination
between the two.

1106
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:55,130
Say there’s a virus infection outside.

1107
01:17:55,130 --> 01:18:08,240
It can pass into your Hamsa Chakra and can
give you a problem of sinus, this, that – physical.

1108
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:12,750
But you won’t become like a person who has
given you virus infection.

1109
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:16,460
So there is a filter.

1110
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:23,770
But supposing there’s a person who is very
hectic.

1111
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:27,914
And you come in contact with that person – he’s
very hectic, so your Swadisthana can take

1112
01:18:27,914 --> 01:18:28,914
over.

1113
01:18:28,914 --> 01:18:31,790
You can become hectic with that person.

1114
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:36,450
Being with that person, you can become hectic.

1115
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:44,290
But as far as the Hamsa is concerned, with
anybody you live, your Hamsa doesn’t carry

1116
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:47,490
the complete impact of that because there’s
filter.

1117
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:55,120
So now, if you have to develop the discretion,
you have to learn, you have to understand.

1118
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,420
It doesn’t come automatically.

1119
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:07,660
But with children who are born realized, their
Hamsa is so developed that they know it – what

1120
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:10,040
is right, what is wrong.

1121
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:17,990
Because their Hamsa is so much trained that
way, they don’t have to use much understanding.

1122
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:25,750
But those who are now growing up, have become
now Sahaja Yogis have to know through their

1123
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,022
own experiences their Hamsa.

1124
01:19:27,022 --> 01:19:29,360
It’s a filter, also.

1125
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:41,100
But for a child, he knows what is right, what
is wrong, because his Hamsa is developed.

1126
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:45,000
In India, when the child is born he’s massaged
nicely.

1127
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,900
Oiling is the best way to have a good Hamsa.

1128
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:59,700
Oil his hair, oil his body, put some drops
in the nose, everything.

1129
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:13,120
They try in the ear, in the nose and that’s
how they build up.

1130
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:18,310
So what I have to say that physically you
should help your Hamsa Chakra by using ghee

1131
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:27,310
and all that, and mentally you should use
it by learning things, in experience – what

1132
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:44,730
to do, how to do it, how to work it out, how
to establish.

1133
01:20:44,730 --> 01:20:49,890
That is how Hamsa Chakra grows and makes you
discrete.

1134
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:54,660
That’s why tradition is very important.

1135
01:20:54,660 --> 01:21:01,450
Tradition gives you the growth of the Hamsa
Chakra and then you go on discarding whatever

1136
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:04,020
is wrong out of that tradition.

1137
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:07,140
Then again, you keep whatever is good.

1138
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:11,040
Give it to your children, to your children,
to your children.

1139
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:19,530
So the discretion comes to a person who is
traditionally built up better than a person

1140
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:22,530
who has no traditions.

1141
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:34,100
Now, for example, this morning I was discussing
that people take, fill the wash basin and

1142
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,670
wash their face, in the West.

1143
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:40,860
In India, we cannot conceive of it, cannot
even think of it.

1144
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:44,080
I mean, people don’t know it can be done.

1145
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:50,730
Because in traditional way it has come out
that if you’re washing your face and again

1146
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:55,870
the water goes into there, then all the dirt
is in it, again you’re using the same water.

1147
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,210
So you cannot have completed.

1148
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,940
So always use running water.

1149
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,120
Traditionally we’ve learned it.

1150
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:09,930
So it’s so much in our heads, in our discretion,
that we cannot even think of such a thing.

1151
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:13,430
Simple thing that Mooladhara must be cleaned
and washed.

1152
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:19,750
Any Indian, you take it, he knows that is,
because they must have had some problems before.

1153
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:26,270
Whether he is in the North, he’s in the
South, East or West – ask him.

1154
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:30,990
Auspiciousness is another thing.

1155
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:34,670
It’s so much imbibed in the tradition.

1156
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:43,100
But if you have a tradition, say, of doing
things which are absurd – also you can have

1157
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,210
traditions like that.

1158
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:48,900
Like very primitive people have all kinds
of traditions which are very absurd.

1159
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:55,780
I was told that if you go to Ladakh what they
do, somebody dies, they keep the hand of the

1160
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:59,940
dead person in the house all the time like
that.

1161
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,120
They think that that helps.

1162
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:08,250
But with tradition which is wrong by discarding
that, they will understand that is wrong.

1163
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:14,620
So the more traditional you are, the ancient
you are, you learn many things.

1164
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:21,660
Like we have seen English are, in a way, very
traditional, so they – supposing theirs

1165
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:28,690
a lady coming down and you are coming with
the lady, then the man will be in front – automatically.

1166
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:31,980
He’ll just move.

1167
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:35,630
But if she’s going up, then man will follow
her.

1168
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:41,370
Just happens, automatically, because traditionally
they have learned that if you’re going down,

1169
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:44,950
the lady may fall or something, so we should
be in front.

1170
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:52,730
So what you call as the traditional habits
of person gives you this Hamsa.

1171
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:57,480
And these habits are built better and better
with trial and error methods.

1172
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,390
And that’s how you develop it.

1173
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:03,580
Now for people who are Sahaj Yogis, it’s
much easy to imbibe them, because if you see

1174
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,610
something, “Yes, that’s wrong – should
not do it – finished."

1175
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:09,110
But you should be so clear cut about it as
you determine.

1176
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,110
It works out.

1177
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:13,350
You’re Hamsa will be all right.

1178
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:16,320
But you tell them ten times, still they do
the same thing.

1179
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:26,350
Then that means their Hamsa is not willing
to accept.

1180
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:31,500
But you must nourish it, you must look after
it, you must – as I said also this kajal

1181
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,680
is also very good for Hamsa Chakra.

1182
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:40,610
All kajal and the oil in the nose, ears – it’s
very good.

1183
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:44,990
All acts for that.

1184
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:59,870
Even, say, talking to another person, to talk
discretely is to say something which doesn’t

1185
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:03,720
lose its power of affecting that person.

1186
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:09,241
Like if you say something very harsh, then
you should know how to neutralize it so that

1187
01:25:09,241 --> 01:25:12,220
he retains that into himself.

1188
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:20,310
All these discretions only come also by tradition.

1189
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:31,120
When you find something that is futile, in
a collective way in a tradition drops out.

1190
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:42,290
So the blessings of the tradition is great,
but greater are the blessings of your Spirit.

1191
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:47,350
And the blessings of the Spirit are such that
through your vibrations, immediately you know

1192
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,580
this is wrong.

1193
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:51,860
But you have to be honest about it and you
just give up.

1194
01:25:51,860 --> 01:26:11,640
You want to ascend, you want to improve your
vibrations, so for that whatever is needed

1195
01:26:11,640 --> 01:27:18,540
you
will do.
