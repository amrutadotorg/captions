Shri Krishna Puja
Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,940
20th August, 2000

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,920
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna
within us.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:37,610
As you know, that you all have been seeking
before coming to Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:53,710
You went to different places, read lots of
books, and also some of you were lost.

6
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:01,160
And in that seeking, perhaps you did not know
what you were seeking.

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:09,560
What you were seeking was to know yourself.

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,509
In all religions it is said “Know thyself.”

9
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:17,190
It’s a common thing all of them have said.

10
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:24,321
This is one point which is absolutely there
in every religion, “Know thyself” – because

11
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:30,130
without knowing yourself you will not know
God.

12
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,710
You will not know spirituality.

13
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:40,361
So the first step was to know yourself, and
that one people did all kinds of tricks with

14
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:50,510
you, they taught you in a different ways and
tried to actually loot you and cheat you.

15
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,450
All those things have happened, is finished.

16
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:01,330
So then you come to Sahaja Yoga and you get
your Self-realization.

17
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:15,560
Well, what is the purpose of Self-realization
is to know God, or the Goddess; that is the

18
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,599
purpose of Self-realization.

19
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:29,769
But after getting Self-realization, what should
happen to you?

20
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:37,680
Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical
things like drugs and all those things; you

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:46,219
have lost interest in reading also useless
books; you have lost interest in other habits

22
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:48,689
like drinking and all that.

23
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:53,349
But that’s not enough, that’s not enough.

24
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,859
That would happen in anyway.

25
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:04,659
What has to happen by knowing God, is that
why does God wants you to know Him?

26
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:09,809
Because He wants to see His reflection in
you.

27
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:16,010
He wants to see His reflection, that’s why
He has created you, and He wants to see His

28
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,290
reflection in you.

29
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,079
Same with the Goddess.

30
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:30,279
She has given you Self-realization because
She wants to see Her reflection in you.

31
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:48,129
So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection,
which is so much purer, beautiful, loving,

32
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:57,269
compassionate and above all, full of wisdom.

33
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:05,079
So this is the point one has to reach, where
you understand you have to have wisdom.

34
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,040
If you are lacking in wisdom then you are
not a self-realized person.

35
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:20,350
At the level of Shri Krishna, you see, He
wants you to become one part and parcel of

36
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:27,790
the Virata – or the Viratangana, also wants
the same thing, that you should become part

37
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,540
and parcel of the Virata.

38
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,710
Not because you are realized souls now, so
you go about thinking you are perfectly all

39
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,160
right, you don’t have to do anything about
it.

40
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:53,980
What do you do beyond this is the point, that
after Self-realization you have to see the

41
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:07,121
reflection that should be within you from
the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

42
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:18,930
Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult
situation, as you know, and He was carried

43
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:25,260
from there to Gokul, where He was brought
up by Yeshoda.

44
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:33,910
Now there He started His playfulness.

45
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:41,490
So you have to be playful in life, you have
to create fun and joy.

46
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:50,570
He didn’t say that you sit down like a old
sage somewhere in the Himalayas, but you mix

47
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:57,960
up with children, you talk to them, you play
with them, have fun.

48
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,250
At the same time He was destroying negative
forces which acted upon Him.

49
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,710
In His playfulness only He has done it, as
a child only He has done it.

50
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:17,800
How matured He was as a child you can see,
that He killed the Putana, and there are two

51
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,900
horrible rakshasas also, He killed them.

52
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:32,060
At the same time He was playing with the gopis
and teasing them, troubling them, making fun

53
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,610
of them.

54
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,890
Why?

55
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:46,860
Because He wanted them to be playful; and
all kinds of celebrations He arranged.

56
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:56,350
He had once a big rain came, and He lifted
the complete mountain on His fingertips.

57
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:02,520
That time these people should have understood,
it’s not possible, it’s a miracle.

58
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:12,660
But He was just standing there with the one
finger at the mountain in a very simple, unassuming

59
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:20,920
manner; He was doing all that to protect all
the boys who were playing with Him.

60
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:30,670
Then He went and killed Kaaliya, the one who
was a big snake in the water.

61
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:38,680
In the water this horrible fellow was creating
venom, and by which many people were killed.

62
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:52,270
It took Him no time and He jumped inside that
horrible water of Yamuna, from where He rescued

63
00:07:52,270 --> 00:08:02,050
in a way all the people by killing or hitting,
or you can say that by winning over this Kaaliya.

64
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:11,320
But the wives of the big serpent, they asked
Him that “Please forgive him,” and He

65
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,740
forgave.

66
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:21,150
All these things show a child of six, seven
years doing all these great things without

67
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:28,030
feeling what He was doing, we can say that
without even thinking about it.

68
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,870
But He achieved it, because He was aware that
He was Shri Krishna.

69
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,900
So first thing, you have to be aware that
you are self-realized people.

70
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:50,639
You are not ordinary people to behave in an
ordinary way, you are special people made

71
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,620
specially to reflect the qualities of God
Almighty.

72
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,569
It’s not expected that you go and kill Kaaliya.

73
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:11,270
But the situation is such today that you are
all the time protected.

74
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,379
You are all the time protected.

75
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:23,250
No one can harm you, no one can kill you,
and you can be looked after because you are

76
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:30,199
Sahaja yogis.

77
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:36,350
Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja
yogi towards taking decisions, one should

78
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,420
understand.

79
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:48,029
It should be a spontaneous decision.

80
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:53,740
You don’t have to tally it with this, go
there and find out – immediately, spontaneous,

81
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:01,110
like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river.

82
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:07,380
So in the same way you should have a very
spontaneous decision for anything.

83
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,579
Now you want to buy, say, a carpet.

84
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:10,579
All right.

85
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:16,839
You go in the shop and immediately you should
know which is the one.

86
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:24,079
In every walk of life you should have a very
spontaneous decision, instant decision.

87
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,540
But what I find, the style is very different.

88
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:37,579
They’ll go from shop to shop, then make
a list of it, then make all the measurements,

89
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:42,959
then go home and say that “We’ll decide
it tomorrow.”

90
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,860
That’s not the way a Sahaja yogi behaves.

91
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:55,270
Sahaja yogi has to decide everything absolutely
spontaneously, at that moment.

92
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:05,410
You should be like this: now somebody is getting
drowned, so the first impulse should be that

93
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,360
you have to save.

94
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,519
And how do you save?

95
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:19,180
You jump in the water – because you are
protected, nothing can happen to you, so just

96
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,089
jump in the water and you’ll save the person.

97
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:29,579
Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude,
this should be your temperament, that you

98
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,740
take a very spontaneous decision.

99
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:44,769
All this thinking and all kinds of decision-making,
and having a big conference for decisions

100
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:48,949
and all that – not needed.

101
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:58,079
In day-to-day life also you have to be like
that.

102
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:06,399
Also in every political life, economic life
or any other life you have to lead, you have

103
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,800
to be very spontaneous.

104
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,220
How do you become spontaneous?

105
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
What quality you have got?

106
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:25,069
What is the weapon you have got, to know what
decision to take?

107
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:28,179
Do you know?

108
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:36,110
You have got vibrations, you have the feel
of the vibrations, and you know what vibrations

109
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,050
are.

110
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,569
You know what vibrations tell you, and convey
and communicate to you.

111
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:46,009
They speak to you.

112
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:55,139
So through your vibrations you should know
in a second what should you do.

113
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:00,980
For example now, somebody told Me that “Mother,
when I came to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations.”

114
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,970
It’s a fact.

115
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:08,050
But how many of you feel that way?

116
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,990
Because your sensitivity is not yet developed.

117
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,579
You have to be sensitive about your vibrations.

118
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:25,129
You should know looking at anyone, sitting
next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone,

119
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:32,930
you should know what sort of vibrations that
person has.

120
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:39,040
This kind of sensitivity if you develop, then
you will definitely take a very spontaneous

121
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
decision.

122
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,529
You know I am very good at it.

123
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:52,279
I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really
five minutes.

124
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,889
When I came here they said, “You can’t
go up, because You have big car.”

125
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:01,680
So the Mayor said, “All right, come along,
I’ll take You in my car.”

126
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,610
So I went with him on the car, on that car,
and I saw it.

127
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,059
It was all dilapidated, no doubt.

128
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:19,389
It was all absolutely in a shambles, all right,
and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt.

129
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:24,550
And everybody who was with Me, they said,
“Ah, what a place, Mother!

130
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,130
You can’t buy that.”

131
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,989
So I told the Mayor, “I am buying it.”

132
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:31,040
“When?”

133
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,089
“Today.

134
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,139
Now!”

135
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,139
He was amazed.

136
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,769
I said, “You tell Me, how do I buy?”

137
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,569
He said, “Very easy.

138
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:47,489
In this Italy You have to buy like this, that
You pay one-third of the price, all right?

139
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:49,779
And then You can occupy.

140
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:55,630
If You find something wrong with the place
You can give up, but then You’ll not get

141
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,630
Your money.

142
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,839
But if the other fellow who is selling You
says no, then he has to pay double.”

143
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,989
I said, “Very good bargain.

144
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:03,989
I am buying.

145
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:05,329
I have told you I am buying.

146
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:07,410
I’ll buy.”

147
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,689
And everybody was surprised what Mother was
doing.

148
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:16,310
So what decided was the vibrations.

149
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,600
Vibrations of the place just decided.

150
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,889
I said, “Buy it.”

151
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:25,959
That way they took Me to seven, I think, castles;
I said no.

152
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:31,510
Outside only I could say no, and they were
surprised I didn’t even go inside.

153
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,439
I said, “Ask them what was here.”

154
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,709
They said, “Nunnery.”

155
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,980
I said, “See?”

156
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,249
Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous
decision.

157
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:55,730
Then you will be amazed how in such a short
time you can really achieve such great things.

158
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:05,600
But that doesn’t mean that you all should
do that way; first you should have that sensitivity

159
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
of vibrations.

160
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,000
If you have that sensitivity of vibrations,
then I would say you are now matured in Sahaja

161
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yoga.

162
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,249
So the maturity has to be brought in.

163
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:24,310
You cannot just say, “Now it’s all right,
I have got Self-realization, I can do this.”

164
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,410
First you tally your sense of sensitivity.

165
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,549
So now, how do you know?

166
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:43,319
For example, you take a spontaneous decision,
you find that you have got nothing, it’s

167
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:46,279
all nonsense – possible.

168
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:53,999
But you can see for yourself that your decisions,
if they are spontaneous: if they fail, if

169
00:16:53,999 --> 00:17:05,350
they are wrong, if there are some mistakes
or that will make you suffer, whether economically,

170
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:14,960
politically, in every way, then your whole
value system will be judged very well how

171
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:27,170
far you have gone into Sahaja Yoga, how far
you have achieved your Self-realization, and

172
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,360
where are you.

173
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,080
This is what is the way to test yourself.

174
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:44,930
You should not be afraid of failures, and
not get enamored by success, because you are

175
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,460
self-realized souls.

176
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,860
Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately
you will know what is it.

177
00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:00,610
Now of course, I wouldn’t say that you could
have the same as I have, but you should try

178
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,610
it.

179
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:09,450
Now, I have seen some people will praise some
man, “Oh Mother, he’s so good.

180
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,100
You must meet him.

181
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:18,700
He’s such a nice person and he’s of such
a help, and this will happen and that will

182
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
happen.”

183
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,980
I said, “All right, you show Me a photograph.”

184
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,750
I said, “I am sorry, I don’t want to meet
him.”

185
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,570
They can’t understand.

186
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,270
“Such a great man, he’ll be a minister
tomorrow.”

187
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,320
“I don’t want to meet him.”

188
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,630
And you find immediately, just next day, a
big report about him in the newspaper that

189
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,660
he’s a very bad man.

190
00:18:50,660 --> 00:19:00,600
So you must tally your experience and your
understanding of what you have decided spontaneously.

191
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,840
But still I would say, keep to spontaneous
decisions.

192
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:13,400
Don’t think about it how it should work
out, what should we do.

193
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:27,420
It has a very far-fetched influence on your
mind also that you see, that you know what

194
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,130
is right and what is wrong.

195
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,770
I don’t know how many of you have seen the
house I have built.

196
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:42,450
The another side of Shri Krishna was that
He was extremely creative.

197
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:49,960
In His childhood He did all these things,
these pranks, and when He became a grown-up

198
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,580
person He became the king of Dwarika, of that
area.

199
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,880
And He used to dress up like a king only – after
all, He was a king.

200
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:11,360
When He was a child He used to wear a small
little piece of a feather from the peacock,

201
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,600
but when He became the king He was wearing
all the things, and He used to sit on the

202
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,520
throne and talk to people in that manner.

203
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:29,240
All that greatness was there, and He was extremely
creative.

204
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:39,260
He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful
castle or you can say, palace in Dwarika,

205
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,300
out of gold – can you believe it?

206
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,920
Shri Krishna did it.

207
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,010
And it was all then covered with water.

208
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:55,310
Now the intellectuals in India, all trained
by Western people I think, said that it’s

209
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:02,580
not possible, there’s nothing in the water
and He never built His palace there; it’s

210
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:10,160
all a story just, just like a myth.

211
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,370
But some people believed in it, and they dug
up.

212
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,210
They went down and they found there was a
very big palace.

213
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,350
There was gold little bit left, but not all
of it was there.

214
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:30,790
And they were amazed, such a huge, big palace
He had made.

215
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:36,280
Under the water it had gone, but it was there.

216
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:44,180
Like this, all these incarnations who came
were extremely creative.

217
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,900
If you are not creative, what’s the use
of Self-realization?

218
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:58,080
Now, what is the greatest creative thing you
can do very easily is to make others Sahaja

219
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,890
yogis.

220
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:12,080
That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing,
is to make others Sahaja yogis and give them

221
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:20,770
the blessings of the Divine, which they have
been seeking for ages.

222
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:28,110
By giving them, you don’t know what a solace,
what a blessing you give.

223
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:35,681
So now when you have got your Self-realization
– you got it very easily, I must say; they

224
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:45,950
all say that it is a instant nirvana, Sahaja
Yoga is instant nirvana, it’s true – but

225
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:53,410
whatever you get so easily and instantly,
you don’t understand the value of that.

226
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:59,120
They always say for India that they got their
freedom so easily; they didn’t get it that

227
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,620
easily, that’s why they do not value it.

228
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:13,430
But it is true, if you get anything free firstly
and without any special effort, then you don’t

229
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,490
value it, you don’t understand.

230
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,010
You think it’s a matter of right.

231
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,560
But do you know how much people have suffered
for getting Self-realization?

232
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:29,520
They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on
one leg, sometimes on their heads for months

233
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,010
together, and they didn’t get realization.

234
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:44,600
I have heard of some people who lived in a
room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realization.

235
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,930
And why they lived like that?

236
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:55,640
Because they thought by keeping away from
other people, other bad atmosphere, everything,

237
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,360
they might get realization.

238
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,680
They never got it.

239
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:10,730
So one must understand, though you have got
it very easily, it’s something so precious,

240
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,770
so great.

241
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:18,140
It’s not very easy to get Self-realization.

242
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:28,270
You read about the people who are self-realized.

243
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,150
Perhaps they did not even know how they got
it, they did not know even about the kundalini,

244
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:39,610
but they got it, through their guru maybe,
maybe their efforts.

245
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:47,990
Buddha, how much He had to suffer till He
gets His realization – think of Him, how

246
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,590
He got His realization.

247
00:24:50,590 --> 00:25:00,660
I mean, you shudder to see of His life: ultimately
dies of hunger and poverty.

248
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,810
But nothing happened to you.

249
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:11,210
You have got it without any difficulties,
in a very sweet manner, all of you.

250
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,290
Nothing – you don’t have to pay, you don’t
have to do anything about it.

251
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:22,920
But that doesn’t mean you should not value
it.

252
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:35,450
Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth
spontaneously sprouts and gives life to the

253
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:44,970
primule which grows, can grow into a shrub
and then into a tree.

254
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:54,280
But you have to put water in, and you have
to have the care of a gardener or someone.

255
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:01,260
In your case, you are the one who has to do
all that.

256
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:11,350
First of all you have to put the nourishment
of compassion and love.

257
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,470
Have you got that compassion and love?

258
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,590
Do you love people?

259
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,690
Like somebody told Me today – I was shocked
– “I don’t like children.”

260
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,610
I said, “You don’t like children?”

261
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,760
“No, I like others’ children, not mine.”

262
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:35,390
Just imagine, how can you be doing that?

263
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,480
How can you say such a thing, you don’t
like your own children, anything?

264
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:48,340
First of all, for all of you I would say that
you should never say “I like” and “I

265
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,480
don’t like.”

266
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,180
These are anti-mantras.

267
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,590
“I like this” – it’s very common.

268
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,290
Who are you?

269
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,570
“I don’t like this carpet.

270
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,540
I don’t like that silver thing.”

271
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,650
Who are you?

272
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,640
Can you make one like that?

273
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:15,090
To take a decision of that kind is also shows
they think it’s very spontaneous – it’s

274
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,090
not.

275
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,832
It has come from your conditioning, that you
think you have a right to say “I don’t

276
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:22,900
like, I don’t want.”

277
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,900
But who are you?

278
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:33,930
If you are the spirit you’ll never use these
words, because it might hurt somebody.

279
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:42,640
You’ll never say something that will hurt
others, you’ll never do anything that will

280
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:50,810
be dangerous for others; but always you’ll
say something that would be extremely loving

281
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,010
and compassionate, and peace-giving.

282
00:27:53,010 --> 00:28:00,610
You will emit joy for others.

283
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:09,030
There is the power of spirit, that it gives
joy to others.

284
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:14,710
If you are a glum person, grumpy person, then
you are not self-realized.

285
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:23,360
You should be able to give joy and love and
compassion, and it should happen absolutely

286
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,550
spontaneously.

287
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:40,960
There’s a story about a saint in India,
in Maharashtra.

288
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:50,290
So they all used to take water in a container
called as kanwar, and would take it all the

289
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:55,620
way to Gujarat, to a temple of Shri Krishna.

290
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:02,960
That was regarded as a great, you can say,
surrendering to Shri Krishna.

291
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,570
So that saint also carried water in that container,
this kanwar.

292
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:19,650
All the way he carried it from his village
in Maharashtra, and when he reached the temple,

293
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:33,500
at the foot of that temple he saw a donkey
very thirsty, dying out of thirst.

294
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:40,270
So he gave that water to that donkey.

295
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,460
Everybody said, “Imagine, you brought this
water for miles together, for days together

296
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:52,730
to be put on the deity here, and now you have
given it to this donkey.”

297
00:29:52,730 --> 00:30:01,870
He said, “You don’t know, God has come
all the way down here to take the water.”

298
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:07,350
See the attitude that he took.

299
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:16,620
So for a self-realized person the compassion
should be like that, of very generous nature.

300
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:23,920
If you are not generous, if you are miserly,
always worried about your money and saving

301
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:32,700
of it, then firstly you are not a matured
Sahaja yogi – you are not.

302
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:39,120
Apart from that, this kind of money will never
give you any happiness.

303
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,760
Miserliness is against spirit.

304
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous.

305
00:30:48,760 --> 00:31:02,910
It never strives to save something, or cheat
people or steal something – is out of question;

306
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:08,950
because there is no greed left in it, there
is no greed at all.

307
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:18,630
And that is why such a person who is a realized
soul cannot be greedy, has to be extremely

308
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,780
generous.

309
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:28,860
I have seen many people like that who have
been extremely generous, and who have been

310
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,520
very understanding about the problems of others.

311
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,710
While a Sahaja yogi will have his own problems,
he is not a Sahaja yogi at all.

312
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:48,380
He is there to solve the problems of others,
and not to solve his own problems and go about

313
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,660
talking about it, “This is the problem I
have.”

314
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,150
Now this is a new word that has developed
in modern times.

315
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:59,720
They never used to use the word “problem”
before, I tell you; only for geometry we used

316
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,420
this word “problem.”

317
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,510
But now it has started with a … “There’s
no problem.”

318
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:11,500
They are all in a problem, actually they are
problems, I think.

319
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:18,330
So what you have to do is to understand that
you should not give your problems to others.

320
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:25,250
You should not ask for anything, “Please
do this for me, please do that for me.”

321
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:37,770
It’s very surprising that people try to
sort of take advantage of others.

322
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,870
Now some people like to visit some countries,
so they will ask you, “Please call me.

323
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,560
I would love to come to your country,” and
a generous Sahaja yogi will say, “All right,

324
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,350
come along.”

325
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:55,290
Now, who is failing here is the person who
asked.

326
00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:03,280
You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever,
because you are complete.

327
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,809
Not that only you are satisfied, but are complete.

328
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:12,220
What can anybody give you?

329
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,559
All desires just disappear when you are in
complete shape.

330
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,150
Like today I was coming, I saw lots of stars
had come out.

331
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,970
I said, “As soon as the moon will come,
they’ll all disappear.”

332
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:38,690
In the same way, when you are complete, you
do not expect anybody to do anything for you.

333
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,380
On the contrary, you want to find out what
you can do for others.

334
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,700
You become the others, in a way that whatever
is the problem of others you take upon your

335
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,020
head.

336
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,200
You jump into it.

337
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:04,370
It’s a very, very interesting growth that
should come in you.

338
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:13,250
It should happen to all of you, because you
have got your Self-realization.

339
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:20,780
You develop a kind of a personality which
only lives for others, not for oneself.

340
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,680
You will be amazed: you can live anywhere,
you can sleep anywhere.

341
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,840
You can have food, you need not have food,
whatever type of food you get it’s all right,

342
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:36,450
because you are so satisfied.

343
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:44,460
On the contrary, you’d like to cook for
others, give them food, do whatever you like

344
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,380
possible, you try to do.

345
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:55,780
As long as you can work it out, you do it.

346
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,630
But there are people who have only their own
problems.

347
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,710
They are not Sahaja yogis.

348
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:11,640
How can the spirit have problems?

349
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,840
How can that happen?

350
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:25,190
So just understand that you are now the spirit,
and beyond everything.

351
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:31,530
So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

352
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:36,190
Of course you start giving realization to
people.

353
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,710
You create art.

354
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:45,920
You know Baba Mama, he was very bad at literature
and he was – well, he didn’t know any

355
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
language.

356
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,780
He was very good for mathematics, because
My mother was a mathematician, but language

357
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,270
he did not know.

358
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,921
I used to write his essays, he was so bad!

359
00:35:55,921 --> 00:36:01,530
But after realization he wrote such beautiful
poems.

360
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,310
Unbelievable!

361
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:08,530
Nobody can believe this Baba could do that,
because he didn’t know any language well.

362
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,040
I used to write his essays, as I told you.

363
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:22,480
So, amazingly, from where he started writing
Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry?

364
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,890
And one of My brothers asked him, “How do
you get this Urdu poetry?”

365
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,609
He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me.”

366
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:35,530
Everything he used to say, “Mataji tells
me.”

367
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:47,430
So the creativity within you is just flowers,
and you are amazed at yourself how this creativity

368
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,720
has come in.

369
00:36:48,720 --> 00:37:00,270
Now imagine, for a person who is a mathematician
becoming suddenly a poet – I mean, it’s

370
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,820
impossible situation.

371
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,540
And you have these capacities.

372
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:13,760
You have all these capacities that you can
become very creative, and you have to be creative

373
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,970
in every way.

374
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:24,310
I am very creative, I must say, I am all the
time working out something which comes out

375
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,350
very well.

376
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:33,960
And also I don’t have that interest as normally
people have, that it should be praised by

377
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:42,180
everyone or it should be, sort of, very much
in the newspapers and everything.

378
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,830
No, no interest.

379
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:52,180
You create for creation, for the sake of creation
you create, and you just enjoy that creation.

380
00:37:52,180 --> 00:38:03,840
And you become very adaptable, or you become
so congenial with all the things people say,

381
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,180
talk – all right, let them do it.

382
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:18,650
They will be offensive, or they could be also
praising you … you don’t know that they

383
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,480
are praising you.

384
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,730
Even sometimes when you “Shri Mataji ki
Jai!”

385
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:32,850
– I also say, and then I forget they are
talking about Me.

386
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:40,410
Somehow you are above all that, and you are
there, and you just don’t understand why

387
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:47,310
human beings behave like that, why their behavior
is so funny.

388
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:54,290
Even when they come to Sahaja Yoga I see they
have a great desire to be leaders, or they

389
00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:06,170
have a great desire to be a great organizer
of Sahaja Yoga, to be very well-known in Sahaja

390
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,170
Yoga.

391
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:17,020
They want to have an international fame as
a great Sahaja yogi.

392
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:22,490
But they do not think that “What creativity
I have shown?

393
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:26,390
What have I created?”

394
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:32,550
Just all these things are so common in human
beings that they always want others to praise

395
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:44,330
them, to have a very big sort of a exposure
– of what?

396
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,710
If you are a spirit, everybody knows.

397
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:55,140
What is there to expose, what is there to
show off, what is there to come forward?

398
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:03,405
Even if you are at the back there is light,
you know there is light.

399
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:11,530
So you have to get out of your darkness, because
you are the light and you spread light; instead

400
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:19,269
of if you are in the darkness, what light
can you spread?

401
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:23,550
So your spirit cannot have problems.

402
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:28,190
It has no fear.

403
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:38,070
But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom,
and that wisdom is the one sign of you being

404
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,660
a very higher personality.

405
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:49,570
As I told you, this is evolution, and when
you are transformed you are evolved.

406
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:58,330
Of a very different nature you become, and
you are to stand out.

407
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:06,450
If Sahaja yogis are like other people, then
what’s the use of taking to Sahaja Yoga?

408
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,890
What was Christ?

409
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,850
He was a son of a carpenter.

410
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:16,540
He never got education.

411
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,390
But what did He do?

412
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,980
He was the Spirit.

413
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:37,430
He reflected God within Him, and that’s
why He got Himself crucified also.

414
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:45,030
Now in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to get
crucified, there are all not such testing

415
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:52,130
things for you, but your value system is to
be checked.

416
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:59,050
You must find out how are you working out,
through introspection.

417
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:10,300
You should ask yourself, “So well now, Mr.
Sahaja yogi, how are you?

418
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:18,230
Are you indulging into all these things that
these people who are not self-realized are

419
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,570
doing?”

420
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:28,330
Just try to find out, because the growth of
Sahaja Yoga is shown in your behavior, in

421
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:35,290
your styles, on your face.

422
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:46,120
There is no wrinkles on a person like this,
he has no worry; you don’t worry, then how

423
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,580
will you get wrinkles?

424
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,290
Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything.

425
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:59,780
I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things.

426
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:11,451
Once in a church there was in Switzerland,
one lady came to hit Me with a Bible, and

427
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:12,470
I started laughing.

428
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,490
I said, “What a thing, and I have to be
hit by a Bible!”

429
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,490
you see.

430
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:24,220
And she got such a fright that I was laughing,
and I was saying, “Look at this stupidity

431
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,700
of this lady, coming to hit Me with a Bible!”

432
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:32,780
I mean, I can understand stone or anything
else, but Bible will never hit Me.

433
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:49,020
All these things have happened in your presence,
and you know about it.

434
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:54,050
There are negative forces.

435
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,570
They try to harm you.

436
00:43:55,570 --> 00:44:00,910
They will harm you bodily, they will harm
you mentally, they might harm you emotionally.

437
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:09,150
But when you are above this, then no one harms
you.

438
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:14,830
At least you never feel the harm, you are
not bothered about the harm.

439
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,180
But what have you created?

440
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:25,150
Today I had some ladies and some men, and
all for divorce.

441
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:31,820
After getting married in Sahaja Yoga, they
want to have divorces, can you imagine?

442
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,730
I was shocked.

443
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:38,720
And they had funny ideas that “my husband
is like my brother.”

444
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,330
I said, “Really?”

445
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:46,970
All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their
heads means there’s no light of the spirit

446
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,230
in them.

447
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:56,930
If you have light of the spirit, then your
understanding is very different.

448
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:03,310
You don’t worry about yourself, you only
worry about others, and you try to find out

449
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:06,990
solutions for them.

450
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:10,100
You try to help them.

451
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:17,250
It is very easy for you.

452
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,260
What is so easy for the light to burn?

453
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,730
Once it is enlightened, it is burning.

454
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,990
It’s difficult for it to go out of light.

455
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:33,980
But for human beings, I can’t understand,
even after realization, after growing for

456
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:41,700
years together they are still so stupid that
they don’t realize the value of their Self-realization.

457
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:54,550
It is something, the spirit, you cannot kill
it.

458
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,090
It cannot blow off.

459
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:02,250
This light will go off, but the light of the
spirit won’t go off.

460
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:11,810
But what is the oil that keeps it there is
your compassion, is love, care of others.

461
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:17,250
I know there are people who are very, say,
dominating, may be troublesome, what else

462
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,160
– but care for them.

463
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,060
Know that they are not like you, they are
not complete, they have problems; so you care

464
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,220
for them.

465
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,450
But instead of that, you start thinking that
“Why should I care for him?

466
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,450
How does he care for me?”

467
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,450
or something.

468
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,410
Then you are finished.

469
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:43,760
So this kind of a reflection, or I would say
the reaction, is not that of a spirit.

470
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,680
A spiritual person’s reactions are very,
very different.

471
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:57,369
In the life of Shri Krishna you can see that
He had a friend who was very poor, and he

472
00:46:57,369 --> 00:47:00,960
wanted to meet Shri Krishna.

473
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,980
And the wife of the friend gave him some rice
crispies, as you call them, “And that’s,

474
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,070
take for your friend.

475
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,780
You must take something for your friend.”

476
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,510
He was a little shy, you know.

477
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:23,340
And when he went to Shri Krishna, Shri Krishna
was in His palace, and the people at the door

478
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,210
said, “No, you can’t meet Him.”

479
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,890
He said, “All right.

480
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,570
You just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.”

481
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:38,800
He was sitting on the throne discussing something,
and He said, “Sudama has come!”

482
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:52,849
He rushed out and went to the door and hugged
him, hugged him again and again; and He said,

483
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:56,880
“Why are you standing here?”

484
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:07,610
He took him and put him on the throne that
He was supposed to, and He told His wives,

485
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,099
“Please come and wash his feet.”

486
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:14,200
And then they brought for him clothes and
all that.

487
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:24,270
He had a bath; He made him sleep on His bed
– see the love of Shri Krishna.

488
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:29,020
He had very dirty feet, all were cracked.

489
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:37,060
He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine
by which it would be all right.

490
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:42,960
He tried to do whatever was possible to him
to cure those cracks.

491
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:51,670
And He asked him to sleep on His bed, and
asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t

492
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,010
feel hot.

493
00:48:54,010 --> 00:49:01,960
See the compassion of Shri Krishna, it shows
so beautifully.

494
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,520
Are we that compassionate?

495
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:14,750
There was no need for Him to do that; it was
no drama, nothing – but His heart!

496
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:19,240
He took a spontaneous decision.

497
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,700
When He heard Sudama is there, He just rushed
there.

498
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:33,440
He just felt so happy that “My old friend
has come.”

499
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:49,520
Then, when He went to Hastinapur, there the
Duryodhan, the Kauravas’ eldest son, he

500
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,790
asked Him that “Why don’t You come and
stay in my palace?”

501
00:49:52,790 --> 00:50:02,359
He said, “All right, I can come, but you
see, I will go and have food with Vidur.”

502
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:07,030
Vidur was a son of a maid.

503
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:13,960
He went and had His food with Vidur.

504
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:23,030
Now Vidur being a poor man, I don’t know
what food he must have given Him, while Duryodhan

505
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:26,770
would have given Him such sumptuous food.

506
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:30,680
So for such people, taste and the level of
food and all doesn’t matter; it’s the

507
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:41,750
love, the respect of Vidur, who was a realized
soul – respecting other Sahaja yogis.

508
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:53,890
If a Sahaja yogi respects somebody who is
a governor – I can’t understand; the spirit

509
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:59,710
is above everything else – and does not
respect a Sahaja yogi, there’s something

510
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,020
wrong with him.

511
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:08,290
He should understand that this spiritual person
is higher than all these people who have these,

512
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:16,720
all kinds of these big names behind them.

513
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:29,410
And that love is shown in everybody’s life:
all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone

514
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:39,609
had that love which was above everything else,
without expecting anything, not doing it just

515
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:43,800
to expect something from them.

516
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:54,530
It is a kind of a personality which really
reflects God’s love.

517
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,930
That reflection should come from you.

518
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:05,080
You are Sahaja yogis: that doesn’t mean
that you are something higher than others,

519
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,109
but you are different.

520
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:11,140
You are above them.

521
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:14,240
You have no superiority, that’s why you
are different.

522
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,110
You are so humble, that’s why you are different.

523
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:24,910
You are so joyous, you are so peaceful, that’s
why you are humble.

524
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:34,770
There are so many things I can tell you from
the life of Shri Krishna, showing He was,

525
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:38,480
they call Him Yogeshwara.

526
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,410
He was a Lord of Yoga.

527
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:47,330
It is because He was Virat.

528
00:52:47,330 --> 00:53:00,460
But He showed it, His form, only to Arjuna,
to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna.

529
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:06,130
Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that.

530
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:16,570
So He lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy
He was living in Gokul, and He never showed

531
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,250
off His powers.

532
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:27,150
His powers were within Himself, which were
expressing spontaneously.

533
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:37,900
This power has wisdom and discretion, complete
discretion.

534
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:46,941
If it does not have then this is not divine
power, this is some satanic power: because

535
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:55,900
somebody is nice to you if you are nice to
that person, nothing doing.

536
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:04,550
Mostly we had in India people who were called
as avadhutas.

537
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:12,650
They were the realized souls who had gone
away from the society, from the multitudes,

538
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:23,010
and gone and lived in some small little place
or some cave or somewhere, hidden from others;

539
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:31,920
because they thought nobody is going to understand
them, so what’s the use of talking to them.

540
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,470
They were singled out, one person here and
one person there.

541
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:39,570
What could they do?

542
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:45,500
They were not like you, so many of Sahaja
yogis together.

543
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,910
You have so many friends and you have so many
others with you.

544
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:56,050
They were lonely people, and they hid themselves
from the society.

545
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:02,410
They would not meet people, because if they
tried anything they would be crucified.

546
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:08,520
But not you people, because you have a society.

547
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:21,349
You have a beautiful enlightened society of
very good friends, of very good spiritual

548
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:22,510
people.

549
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:31,950
With all this if you cannot create, then what
should I say?

550
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:44,780
You have to create something: may be art,
may be music, may be poetry, may be literature,

551
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:50,210
may be writing – whatever it is, you have
to create.

552
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:54,359
And above all, you have to create Sahaja yogis.

553
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:58,690
That’s the main creation you have to achieve.

554
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:06,850
That’s the main thing you have to have,
is creating Sahaja yogis all over.

555
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:13,780
And there I can go to places, can have programs,
do everything.

556
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:22,230
But you have to show with your own example
that this is something great, how they have

557
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:28,690
achieved this state; we should achieve also
that state.

558
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:40,849
So you will be the ones who will really inspire
them, who will really make them follow you

559
00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:45,500
and take to a life of a Sahaja yogi.

560
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:54,530
Actually you are Mahayogis, if you become
complete – and you have to become.

561
00:56:54,530 --> 00:57:04,050
Nothing is more important than becoming a
Mahayogi, by which your spirit gives joy,

562
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:11,930
peace and blessings to everyone.

563
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:18,230
May God bless you.
