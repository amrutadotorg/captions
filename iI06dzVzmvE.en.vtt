00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:14.544
To know where you are, as far as God is concerned.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.183
That’s the main thing, isn’t it?

00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:20.597
We are here for that, to be one with God,

00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:25.947
to be union with his power, to be his instruments.

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:31.060
And how our connections get loose,

00:00:31.747 --> 00:00:37.087
and how we can to correct it, 
we should try to understand that.

00:00:37.947 --> 00:00:46.206
First of all, we must realize 
that you are not to think about it.

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:51.276
If you start thinking too much about it,

00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:54.319
then you have seen that you do something funny

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.686
which you should not have done.

00:00:58.092 --> 00:01:01.473
Do not plan out too much about it, also,

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.780
because, in this country, if people start planning out, 
they’ll get all the planning done.

00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:09.227
For example, they have to go for a walk: 
then they must have proper shoes,

00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:13.308
they must have proper sticks, they
must have this, they must have that,

00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:16.352
and they must have gloves, and they must have everything,

00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:18.863
and they never go out.

00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:22.223
They are so exhausted with the planning itself.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.142
In the same way, it happens with Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:39.189
It very much happens the same way with Sahaja Yoga,
I have seen that

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:43.506
though I have told you not to plan it out,

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:52.719
not to think about it, still you go on doing it 
and that is how you get into problems;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.074
that by thinking you cannot correct yourself.

00:01:56.427 --> 00:02:03.034
What you can do is to know that you can put bandhans

00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:05.830
or you can give yourself a balance with your hands.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.992
You have to move your hands and not your brain. All right?

00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:14.106
Our brains are moving and hands and feet never move.

00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:21.613
And out of proportion our brains are moving
 but our hands and feet do not move.

00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:25.639
This is the society which H.G. Wells had described, 
I can see it very clearly,

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:30.790
that you have more brains than your deftness 
and then your understanding.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.724
Your fingers are not so sensitive 
and the brain leads you to artificiality.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.967
So, you are not to use your thinking 
for correcting your chakras.

00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:45.381
Now should I write it down in golden words?

00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:49.200
That you cannot think about it and sort it out.

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.266
This is one thing people do not understand.

00:03:03.865 --> 00:03:08.157
Now we have got mantras for different chakras.

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:13.407
Every chakra has got a mantra which you know.

00:03:13.488 --> 00:03:15.713
If you do not know, you should find out.

00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:21.789
Now, if one chakra is catching, 
then you work on that chakra only

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.096
and develop your mantra on that.

00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:28.165
For example, supposing you have 
to say something for your heart.

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:31.711
Then, first of all, you must ask for forgiveness from God.

00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:36.352
That means your attention has not been 
so much as it should have been on the Spirit.

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:41.779
Or, if you have done any mistakes, 
ask for forgiveness, you ask for forgiveness.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.094
Now, you ask for forgiveness from your heart.

00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:48.161
Even doing with hand can be artificial, you understand that?

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:51.478
It could be just ritualistic - but from your heart.

00:03:51.558 --> 00:03:55.000
Whatever you have to say, you say it from your heart.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.214
Ask for forgiveness from your heart - not think about it.

00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:01.926
You see, this is the trouble is. If I say something

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.919
then you start thinking about it, and then you said then

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.502
“Now, I have to take out my attention from the center,”

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:11.195
and then you start taking out your attention. You cannot.

00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:16.049
With your brain, you cannot take out 
your attention from anywhere.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:21.027
It’s only through your hands, or movement 
of your hands, or by saying mantras you bring it.

00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:24.838
Do you understand that point? Absolutely clear-cut.

00:04:24.918 --> 00:04:27.581
Many people think that if they pay attention to something

00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:30.827
and pull their attention - you cannot.

00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:35.170
But what you can do, is to, when you are saying the mantra,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.603
put your attention without thought to that particular chakra.

00:04:39.684 --> 00:04:41.743
So you master that chakra ultimately,

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:46.027
the one which is a weakness can become your mastery.

00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:52.802
But if you think, then you are catching again the heart much more.

00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:55.817
You have known that by thinking you catch your right side

00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:58.170
in the sense that it starts overacting,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.755
it gets over-activated, and left side gets frozen up 
by which heart is catching.

00:05:04.835 --> 00:05:09.622
Your ego develops which engulfs your heart.

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.736
So the more you think about it, 
how to correct your ego, the worse you are.

00:05:13.816 --> 00:05:15.803
You fight it.

00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:19.039
So then we know that you have to give a balance,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.600
bring down your ego - with your hand, 
with massaging, you can bring it down,

00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:27.741
because in your hand it is flowing, whether you are catching or not catching, flow from your hand is there

00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:32.596
- the flow from your hand is there. You may not even receive from me but there is flow already started,

00:05:32.677 --> 00:05:35.093
it’s germinated, little bit is always there.

00:05:35.174 --> 00:05:40.096
Use that to massage your head, bring down your ego.

00:05:40.177 --> 00:05:46.465
Then for heart also, do not think about it but give it, 
or you put your hand towards it.

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:48.970
Direct the vibrations but don’t think at that time.

00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:52.686
This is the important thing.

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:57.660
If you are thinking and directing, it cannot be directed

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.887
because your attention is engulfed in the thinking process.

00:06:00.967 --> 00:06:03.406
Do you understand that point?

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:09.409
And here, the problem is people think too much 
and talk too much.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:13.474
I mean, they talk about everything. 
They know everything.

00:06:13.554 --> 00:06:18.500
It is such a wasteful habit of thinking

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.775
and then talking about it.

00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:25.289
Everybody is a monarch here because of ego.

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:30.453
So now please tell your ego, 
“You please keep shut - now we know you too well.”

00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:34.175
Try to push it back as much as you can,

00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:36.983
with force sometimes, bring it back, like that.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:39.865
Try to bring it to its normal position

00:06:39.946 --> 00:06:45.847
and you will be amazed once it goes 
to its normal position you’ll feel very much lighter.

00:06:48.087 --> 00:06:50.328
So this is to be done with your hand.

00:06:50.408 --> 00:06:55.148
You can use oil to rub on your body, if you have to rub.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.463
You can use even powder or 
anything for having less friction,

00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:01.489
but it is through massage, through giving bandhans,

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.708
by taking it out, or through nimboo [lemon]

00:07:04.788 --> 00:07:09.034
or you can use even an orange or something like that,

00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:13.810
Try to take out these vibrations
through these mediums and not through thinking.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.320
Through thinking, you cannot do it.
Once you think, you have no power over yourself.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.657
There’s a barrier between the Spirit and you,

00:07:22.738 --> 00:07:25.237
because you are thinking through your ego.
