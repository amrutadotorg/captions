00:00.240 --> 00:01.760
If they take to modern writers,\h\h

00:03.520 --> 00:10.080
then they are really horrible and they just\h
very vulgar, extremely vulgar, very superficial.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.520
Sadly they are doing Shakespeare\h
like this, [inaudible] be successful.

00:15.520 --> 00:19.440
And you see how he has avoided all the\h
pomp and show of the courts and all that,\h\h

00:19.440 --> 00:26.647
just focusing on them, with the light\h
and Rembrandt style, too much of…

00:26.647 --> 00:26.707
Yogi: Mother, how did You cause the miracle?

00:26.706 --> 00:33.144
Would one of them be a realized soul or what?

00:33.144 --> 00:38.720
Shri Mataji: He was, he was\h
getting realized you see,\h\h

00:38.720 --> 00:39.280
evolving.

00:40.240 --> 00:45.200
But miracle is caused because\h
it’s a Shiva’s Island, you see.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.080
He resides there.

00:46.640 --> 00:50.720
But the English never realize, that’s the\h
point is, I don’t know when will they realize.

00:50.720 --> 00:58.960
They’re very arrogant, extremely\h
arrogant and think no end of themselves.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.240
I don’t know how they do it like that.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.640
The more they are helped the worse they become.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.840
Now of course, once Europe becomes\h
one, they’ll know what they are.

01:11.760 --> 01:16.480
They don’t have any talents, as the\h
other people have, none of the talents.

01:17.200 --> 01:22.960
Just in their pride and arrogance, they\h
remained in some sort of a fools’ paradise.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.480
Time has come for them to realize where are they.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.240
That’s why they are afraid\h
to join European community.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.640
In no way(-) They are all mediocres in everything.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.840
Everything they do is mediocre.

01:40.520 --> 01:45.920
Yogi: Today the Australian Prime Minister said we\h
should become a republic in front of the Queen.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.160
The Queen was sitting there,\h\h

01:48.160 --> 01:52.000
and the Prime Minister said, in front of\h
the Queen, we should become a republic.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.320
And in all the English newspapers they’re saying\h
that the Prime Minister insulted the Queen.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.859
Shri Mataji: Yes, what did they(-)?

01:58.859 --> 02:04.480
Yogi: Newspapers in England, they are saying\h
that the Australian prime minister insulted\h\h

02:04.480 --> 02:08.880
the Queen because he said that we should\h
become a republic in front of the Queen.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.840
Shri Mataji: You see now everybody\h
is now breaking out of Commonwealth.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.240
India has also broken, there’s no harm.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.920
Also, the Commonwealth is not such\h
a body that really looks after\h\h

02:20.720 --> 02:23.760
the interests of all the\h
countries in the same manner.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.720
It is, you see, this apartheid and\h
all that, these things are going on\h\h

02:27.840 --> 02:31.600
and, I don’t know, they are not so clear-cut.

02:31.600 --> 02:37.440
Of course, they had an Indian, from, I\h
think he was from East Africa who was the\h\h

02:39.920 --> 02:50.000
President of that, but he’s now gone and that’s\h
the reason they must be asking to be republics.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.040
So it’s no insult to her, I mean\h
a declaration is not an insult.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.280
English are like that.

02:56.720 --> 03:01.120
They can insult anyone,\h
but nobody can insult them.

03:01.120 --> 03:07.520
Yogi: The Prime Minister’s wife didn’t bow to\h
her, didn’t curtsey, and that’s a very big insult.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.800
Shri Mataji: I didn’t curtsey to her also.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.000
I never did.

03:13.120 --> 03:17.840
Actually she bent, thinking I was\h
[INAUDIBLE], so I had to lift her up.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.760
All too much of it, see now, they have these\h\h

03:26.320 --> 03:29.920
parties, this tea parties,\h
means tea party, horrible thing.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.400
Then you are supposed to wear\h
those dresses from that Moss Bros.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.920
and tight, sometime loose, they\h
all look like Charlie Chaplins.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.800
And see, then you have to walk in that wet lawn,\h\h

03:47.440 --> 03:50.960
and some ladies with the heels,\h
they just get pressed into it.

03:51.680 --> 03:55.120
It’s a mess of a thing, but you have to be there.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.320
If you are not there they notice you and\h
they’ll tell you: ‘Why didn’t you come?’

03:58.960 --> 04:02.187
But there’s certain qualities in\h
English which are to be imbibed.

04:02.187 --> 04:05.680
Is one of them, they always\h
respect work and merit.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.040
Like they have respected My husband, it’s\h
very remarkable I mean, that’s what they do.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.400
And secondly, they have very good justice.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.760
[Their] justice system is\h
the best in the whole world.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.600
They cannot be corrupted.

04:20.240 --> 04:25.760
And thirdly, I would say, as far as the\h
Parliament is concerned, and the politicians are\h\h

04:25.760 --> 04:29.520
concerned, they are very honest,\h
[there is] very little of bribery.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.600
So all this things are there, no doubt.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.280
But with this austerity of temperament,\h
you see, you also develop that kind of a\h\h

04:35.840 --> 04:39.520
dry nature, arrogance and domination and all that.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.640
So they are fully on the right\h
side, while they should be\h\h

04:42.640 --> 04:44.800
on the left because they are Shiva’s disciples.

04:52.560 --> 04:59.760
Their sense of humor, their scholarship,\h
everything is fine but the arrogance\h\h

05:00.880 --> 05:02.720
and living in fools’ paradise is too much.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.800
I mean, as far as Shakespeare is concerned,\h
He was a realized soul of a very high order\h\h

05:10.800 --> 05:13.840
so He tried to show the futility\h
of human endeavor all the time,\h\h

05:14.400 --> 05:16.960
and also the miracles of God, as in this one.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.720
But I don’t know if they have understood Him.

05:20.720 --> 05:24.800
And nowadays there’s not even one play\h
running in England, [in] London itself.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.960
You have to go all the way to\h
Stratford-on-Avon to see His plays.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.960
We saw two of them there.

05:32.480 --> 05:37.280
And now the plays they are having, it’s so\h
horrible, that you can’t see with your children,\h\h

05:37.280 --> 05:40.720
you can’t see with anyone, it’s (-)\h
I mean you don’t want see it also.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.400
It’s very cheapish style.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.960
So they should go back to their own past\h
and get out something nice from that.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.560
That’s why it has come out where.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.320
They must have learnt a lesson.

05:52.320 --> 05:58.320
In last year, no, last before that,\h
they got [INAUDIBLE] that time.

06:00.080 --> 06:00.960
They [SOUNDS LIKE: booked?]\h\h

06:00.960 --> 06:05.840
all the films and condemned that as\h
the worst, they wouldn’t show it.

06:05.840 --> 06:12.160
Very very arrogant and insulting,\h
very arrogant and insulting people.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.160
That’s a sin, to insult another human being.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.840
Racist.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.840
I think Australia also has this racialism in them.

06:25.280 --> 06:33.840
It’s not so much now in England as (-) Some of\h
the families in Australia very racist still.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.280
The way they troubled this Sandra.

06:38.080 --> 06:50.640
I mean in England nobody\h
would do that kind of a thing.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.280
But he was a good king, that’s\h
why he was helped by God.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.480
That they don’t understand.

06:55.200 --> 07:00.400
This queen is a nice lady, very nice, very\h
decent person, but she also can’t get out of it,\h\h

07:00.400 --> 07:03.760
it’s something that is, even her\h
dress is decided by the Parliament.

07:11.120 --> 07:15.840
It’s all right now, I mean,\h
I hope they learn a lesson.

07:15.840 --> 07:21.920
[ANSWER TO INAUDIBLE QUESTION]\h\h

07:21.920 --> 07:24.640
The British were very nasty to us, very nasty,\h\h

07:25.680 --> 07:30.800
and actually, they put Me on ice, they gave\h
Me electric shocks, they did everything to Me.

07:31.440 --> 07:37.120
But still I know that English (-) if it\h
goes to the English mind it will circulate.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.680
The media in English, this Murdoch\h
from here has gone, horrible fellow.

07:42.400 --> 07:49.120
No hope for England, cannot\h
see sense at all, on the whole.

07:50.480 --> 07:58.080
But they take to French\h
style sometimes, sometimes to\h\h

07:58.720 --> 08:01.040
Americans, they don’t have their self-confidence.

08:01.920 --> 08:05.573
If they develop their self-confidence,\h
they’ll see the sense of Sahaja Yoga also.

08:05.573 --> 08:11.840
Brian Bell: Shri Mother, may\h
we say Your Three Mantras?

08:11.840 --> 08:12.397
To say good night/

08:12.397 --> 08:13.920
Shri Mataji: Too many mantras already.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.200
Just see My Feet.

08:16.080 --> 08:20.480
Just see My Feet, how much swollen they\h
are, it’s with the mantras and things.

08:20.480 --> 08:25.760
So it’s better that, this puja business\h
is too much, you see, continuously,\h\h

08:25.760 --> 08:29.680
I’m having, I had how many pujas\h
you know, this short time five.

08:32.960 --> 08:38.240
Tomorrow we can say that, while\h
before the program these boys can say,\h\h

08:38.240 --> 08:40.080
when there are too many people.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.920
But with few people they don’t absorb.

08:48.400 --> 08:52.160
But it’s nice that there was puja so\h
everybody could travel, come down, and,\h\h

08:52.720 --> 09:00.880
I agreed to it but you know only fifteen days\h
[HINDI], in twenty days [HINDI] less than that.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.000
Twenty days these and then We are going there,\h\h

09:07.680 --> 09:10.320
five days… Twenty-five days\h
really we had five pujas.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.200
So five days a puja is too much for Me.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.040
All right, doesn’t matter.

09:19.040 --> 09:25.760
So we’ll do it tomorrow before the program.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.080
All right?

09:28.080 --> 09:35.840
All right, thank you very much for the\h
nice film, it was really very nice.
