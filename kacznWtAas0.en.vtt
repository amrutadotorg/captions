00:10.203 --> 00:18.614
But “diwali” word is from “deepa wali” means the “rows of lights”.

00:22.715 --> 00:30.444
It was celebrated firstly because

00:32.057 --> 00:40.305
thousands of
years back, Shri Rama was crowned on this day.

00:41.912 --> 00:53.768
That means the benevolence of human beings was crowned, was accepted.

00:56.401 --> 01:06.943
And in Shri Rama’s life, you see an ideal personality being shown to be a king,

01:07.023 --> 01:13.120
to be the benevolent king as described by Socrates.

01:16.795 --> 01:25.245
So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent king was crowned.

01:25.337 --> 01:33.977
That means we have to have a king who is benevolent.

01:34.057 --> 01:48.493
That’s only possible if the people who choose the king

01:50.780 --> 02:00.402
have no other consideration but that of benevolence of all the people.

02:03.274 --> 02:09.070
So one has to come to the conclusion

02:09.150 --> 02:16.431
that they have to be Sahaja
Yogis, because others think that:

02:16.511 --> 02:20.893
“How much money we’ll get
out of this power that we’ll have."

02:20.974 --> 02:25.690
Some think: “How much power-oriented we could be?”

02:25.984 --> 02:31.061
Some think: “How many countries I can win?”

02:33.374 --> 02:36.315
or any other domination.

02:37.315 --> 02:43.691
So in the freedom loving people who are supposed to be free,

02:43.771 --> 02:48.096
the idea of benevolence is finished.

02:49.598 --> 02:54.155
Because whatever good for you, whatever is benevolent for you,

02:54.235 --> 02:58.815
can be only understood if you have wisdom, if you have depth.

02:58.896 --> 03:03.103
But if you have this kind of freedom
is to go amuck, do what you like:

03:03.183 --> 03:07.386
“Because everybody’s doing it, I must do it.

03:07.767 --> 03:12.387
Everybody is singing like this; so I must do it."

03:12.468 --> 03:15.975
But from where does this idea come in?

03:17.825 --> 03:22.011
From where these ideas come in are the entrepreneurs

03:22.097 --> 03:26.345
who want to befool you, make slaves out of you,

03:26.425 --> 03:30.171
and this slavery is so-called freedom for you.

03:30.252 --> 03:35.423
But actually, I think it’s complete slavery because you do what they tell you,

03:35.557 --> 03:39.913
behave in the same manner as whatever they say.

03:40.136 --> 03:49.889
There are no fashions in that country, very few, very few women indulge into fashions.

03:50.266 --> 03:53.844
Nothing.
And men are also very simple.

03:53.924 --> 03:59.373
They have no fashionable things. They have only
things which are convenient, good for their climate.

03:59.453 --> 04:03.903
That’s what they wear, whether you laugh or don’t laugh.

04:03.983 --> 04:06.852
It’s everybody laughs here.

04:06.932 --> 04:12.333
If anybody laughs at them they’ll say: “This is
stupid, you see, I’ll have pity for him, that’s all."

04:14.652 --> 04:20.136
So one has to understand that it was the king, Rama, who was

04:20.216 --> 04:27.626
made the, actually accepted by the public, like a crown was
put on his head

04:27.706 --> 04:32.622
to say that benevolence is the highest thing.

04:33.333 --> 04:37.724
And whatever is benevolent for us

04:37.804 --> 04:44.824
should be accepted in our freedom, if we are really a free country.
