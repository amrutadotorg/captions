1
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:44,441
At the very outset, we have to know that the truth is what it is.

2
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:54,311
You cannot change it

3
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,901
You cannot transform it

4
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:03,661
And at this human awareness you cannot know it

5
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:22,421
That means in our evolutionary process we have reached this state of a human being

6
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,401
but it is not the end of our evolution

7
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:46,969
because we don´t know what is Absolute truth.

8
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:53,989
Whatever I´m going to tell you today

9
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:59,909
you have to take it

10
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:08,049
with an open mind like a scientist.

11
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,189
If it is proved

12
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:23,669
than you have to accept it as

13
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:26,649
honest people.

14
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:36,729
Because it is for your benevolence,

15
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:41,189
it is for the benevolence of your country,

16
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:44,649
it is for the benevolence of the whole world.

17
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:07,329
So please listen to me carefully what I have to tell you.

18
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,969
There is within us

19
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:28,889
a power,

20
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:33,069
which is placed in the triangular bone,

21
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,629
for our ascend.

22
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:55,329
It is for our last breakthrough.

23
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:03,109
And this breakthrough has to happen

24
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:08,269
as a process of our evolution.

25
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:18,129
So the truth is that

26
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:21,569
you are not this body,

27
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,209
this mind, this ego, these conditionings.

28
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:30,069
But you are the Pure Spirit.

29
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:46,369
And the second truth is that there is

30
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:52,149
a very subtle power of Divine Love

31
00:15:53,249 --> 00:16:03,169
that does all the living work.

32
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,669
We see all these beautiful flowers all around us.

33
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:23,689
But we don´t even think whatever a miracle it is.

34
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:36,369
That out of one seed such beautiful flowers come out.

35
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:44,409
Who runs your heart?

36
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:50,249
The doctors may say it is the autonomous nervous system.

37
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,209
Who is this auto?

38
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:09,089
We go to science and we find that there

39
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:12,389
are many questions which cannot be answered.

40
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,829
Science cannot tell us why are we on this Earth.

41
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,729
What is the purpose of life?

42
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:38,549
What is our identity?

43
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,869
So we take to religions.

44
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:52,529
But religions have created nothing but fundamentalism.

45
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:57,929
It is a blind faith.

46
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:04,089
And all kinds of problems have brought up in the name of God.

47
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:16,909
They are only money-oriented or power-oriented.

48
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,989
They are not spirit-oriented.

49
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:36,529
But in these modern times there are a lot of false gurus also

50
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:40,489
who have come out to make money out of your simplicity.

51
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:57,889
If it is a living process, how can you pay for it?

52
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:04,289
Like this Mother Earth.

53
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:08,909
How are we to pay Her for these flowers?

54
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,949
Also some people say we have to suffer.

55
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,989
There is no need to suffer at all.

56
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:39,569
Imagine if God Almighty is the father of all the fathers,

57
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,569
how can He want you to suffer or Him?

58
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:57,409
He is your father,

59
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:01,009
full of compassion,

60
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,989
full of joy for you.

61
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:16,189
I have seen there are some false people coming

62
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,909
and teaching some mantras

63
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,649
and things like that

64
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,449
and some boys, I was surprised

65
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:25,469
poor things were just going on saying some mantras.

66
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,449
If it is coming from India,

67
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:51,349
You should not believe that all that comems from India is good. Not at all.

68
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,729
Be very careful.

69
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:04,609
It is people who are trying to mesmerize your younger generation.

70
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:20,009
As I have told you that

71
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:25,089
you have to be the Spirit.

72
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:30,789
That means it is an actualization.

73
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:34,349
It is a happening

74
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:37,489
of becoming.

75
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:51,509
So it is not just a lecture or

76
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:55,389
or a sermon or a mental process.

77
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:08,269
But a happening within you.

78
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,709
That you become something different.

79
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:23,889
We see so many problems in this world these days

80
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,609
You have no idea how much problematic it is

81
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:31,569
in democratic countries.

82
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:45,249
But it is happening in America which is supposed to be the greatest democratic country

83
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:49,809
It is just full of idiotic and stupid people.

84
00:22:55,089 --> 00:23:01,129
It is surprising how they are taking life, for example

85
00:23:01,689 --> 00:23:05,209
they spend all their time in absolute, stupid, nonsencial

86
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:09,369
idiotic things.

87
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:21,689
I sometimes don´t understand how come

88
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:26,089
human beings can become like that.

89
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,889
Also tremendous level of

90
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:38,649
an enterpreneour starts say a fashion.

91
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:41,329
Say for example narrow pants.

92
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:57,749
So they are all dressed up like that.

93
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:02,849
Nobody has freedom to keep to their own dress.

94
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:13,569
They all wear it and they get varicose veins.

95
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:25,529
They wear it even then they get varicose veins.

96
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:30,869
Then they develop some other nonsense.

97
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:39,949
Like six-inches of a skirt for ladies.

98
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:51,669
Even in the cold of England they are wearing that kind of a dress.

99
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,929
They talk of individuality.

100
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,269
Where is the individuality?

101
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:17,569
They do really very stupid things please thank God you have escaped.

102
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:30,049
They have got the freedom, alright, but no wisdom.

103
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:46,289
And now it´s full of AIDS, full of schizofrenia, madness, lunacy, all kinds of funny diseases.

104
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,529
Drugs of all kinds they are taking.

105
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:10,929
It´s not only the children but even grown-ups in parties.

106
00:26:11,349 --> 00:26:14,069
They talk of drugs.

107
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:25,429
They have not matured at all.

108
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:31,949
I don´t say communism was the solution.

109
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:38,669
But nor is democracy.

110
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:47,709
Unless and until you have wisdom,

111
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:51,029
both things can be very dangerous.

112
00:26:57,689 --> 00:27:04,369
Now they are selling all their junk which was not sold in their countries to you people here.

113
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:24,289
Due to recession now they are going to Russia and all these places, even to India, to sell all their junk.

114
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:36,409
But there is a solution

115
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,469
to all these problems.

116
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:49,549
This solution lies within yourself.

117
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,629
You don´t have to go Moon,

118
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:02,989
You don´t have to go to Jupiter to discover it.

119
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:17,929
Most of the problems that are visible are due to human beings.

120
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:27,769
Most of the human problems are beacuse of the subtle centers,

121
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,469
within them are in trouble.

122
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,169
When this Kundalini rises,

123
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:50,349
She nourishes all these centers,

124
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:53,629
interates them and connects you to this

125
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:56,749
All-pervading Power.

126
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:16,849
Because of these centers we suffer,

127
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:21,329
physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

128
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:37,169
No doubt, with the ascend of Kundalini

129
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:42,409
people have cured of their many incurable diseases.

130
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,489
When the Kundalini comes

131
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:00,149
out of your fontanel bone area,

132
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:05,129
you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

133
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:20,849
This Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

134
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:38,649
...described about God Almighty and His son.

135
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:45,129
but nothing about the Mother.

136
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:51,709
The third one is the Holy Ghost which is a dove.

137
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:02,569
Symbolically it is alright, it is pure and it ascends.

138
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:14,369
But in all other religions they have described  a Primordial Mother.

139
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:25,569
This has happened because of Paul.

140
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:29,069
He was a hater of women.

141
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:34,389
And he never met Christ, all stories are told.

142
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:45,909
He had killed so many christians and then he wanted to jump on the platform.

143
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,949
And he chose Peter.

144
00:31:54,649 --> 00:32:00,549
as the person who will be anointed with the highest position

145
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:05,049
in christian religion.

146
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:16,689
Peter was the worst disciple of Christ.

147
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:25,209
So Christ also said to Peter

148
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,889
that a Satan will take you over.

149
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:38,169
I was myself born in a christian family.

150
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:42,409
And I asked my father: "Who is this Paul?"

151
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:49,709
He was a realized soul my father,

152
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:55,489
and he said: "He is a squatter."

153
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,809
He has done a great harm to the West.

154
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:04,729
by not respecting women.

155
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:17,289
He did not respect the Mother of Christ.

156
00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:21,869
He calls her a woman.

157
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:28,769
In Quran  Mohammed respects her very much.

158
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:38,809
And said nobody should take any objection about her morality.

159
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:58,349
This Paul´s turning of Christ´s life has really ruined the message of Christ.

160
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:16,409
You find all these churches

161
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,169
have become very money-oriented and power-oriented.

162
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:37,509
So now after giving up communism you might jump onto these, any of them

163
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:41,549
it´s very dangerous again.

164
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:57,209
Even the Madonna was never a name given in the Bible to the mother of Christ.

165
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:09,929
It came from the father religion.

166
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:13,329
Which was before Christ.

167
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:28,869
As a result the women in the West are extremely insecure.

168
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:43,109
I was surprised, how they have to all the time please the men and please the children.

169
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:55,349
And are really going into the complete waste of immorality.

170
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:07,049
India politically and economically is a hopeless case. I agree.

171
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:18,669
But the society is very well named.

172
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:31,629
And women don´t have to be insecure in that society.

173
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:37,289
For them their power is their chastity.

174
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:46,069
Even in modern times.

175
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:55,669
So to achieve that sense of security also we have to be the Spirit.

176
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:05,629
First thing that happens to you

177
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:09,129
you become thoughtlessly aware.

178
00:37:19,269 --> 00:37:22,649
It´s a new dimension in your awareness.

179
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:36,029
There are thoughts which come to us from the past and the future.

180
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,789
But we cannot be in the present.

181
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:49,909
When the Kundalini rises she separates the thoughts.

182
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:57,329
So we become thoughtless but fully aware.

183
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:06,229
We jump into the present.

184
00:38:09,729 --> 00:38:12,609
Which is the reality.

185
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:19,429
The past is finished and the future doesn´t exist.

186
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:27,409
In that state you start growing spiritually.

187
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:38,589
The Spirit is a universal being within you.

188
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:46,889
It transcends

189
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:52,109
all barriers that we have created by our mental activity.

190
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,809
Of ritualism, fundamentalism, all kinds of isms.

191
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:18,829
You realize that all these religions were born on the same tree of spirituality.

192
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:23,969
These people have cut them and are fighting with the dead flowers.

193
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,069
In the state of thoughtless awareness

194
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:46,289
you feel your peace within yourself.

195
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,949
This is the peace we are seeking.

196
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:57,049
People talk of peace,

197
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:05,169
have big arguments and conferences but there is no peace within themselves.

198
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:19,269
They have been given awards and this, that.

199
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:25,189
But I have seen they are very hot-tempered people.

200
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:34,449
So by your ascend

201
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,209
you become a peaceful personality,

202
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:41,649
relaxed personality, satisfied personality.

203
00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:55,289
And you become wise nad discreet.

204
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:07,149
Because you see the reality.

205
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:13,369
And you feel the totality.

206
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:20,369
When this Kundalini pierces thought the fontanel bone area,

207
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:23,549
you start feeling cool breeze on your fingertips.

208
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,249
This is the All-pervading power.

209
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:48,249
Which in Quran is called as Ruh.

210
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,669
In sanskrit as Paramachaitanya.

211
00:41:55,949 --> 00:42:02,269
Your attention becomes enlightened and innocent.

212
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:08,569
You innocence is never lost.

213
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,129
It is always there.

214
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:22,289
Only thing, because of your so called freedom there are some clouds.

215
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:33,289
But when Kundalini rises and connects you to the All-pervading power

216
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:38,189
you become innocent, your eyes ecome innocent.

217
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:52,169
You know the Absolute truth on your finger tips,

218
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:59,329
even the realized children can tell you

219
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:02,809
what´s wrong with your centers.

220
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:12,949
Not that you can feel your own centers, that´s self-knowledge,

221
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:14,989
but also the centers of others.

222
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:25,629
So you develop a new dimension

223
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:29,969
in your awareness of collective consciousness.

224
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:42,849
Ultimately you develop the powers to raise the Kundalini of others.

225
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:58,549
As one enlightened candle can enlighten many candles.

226
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:04,069
The life becomes absolutely blissful.

227
00:44:07,649 --> 00:44:10,749
And you jump into the ocean of joy.

228
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:15,569
Joy has no duality.

229
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:19,069
of happiness and unhappiness.

230
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:31,329
It is the experience of joy, you feel it.

231
00:44:40,669 --> 00:44:43,309
Sahajayoga is working in 55 nations,

232
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:53,169
so many have been cured.

233
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:57,549
so many have now the powers,

234
00:44:57,949 --> 00:45:03,489
but I have never seen them fighting, quarreling,

235
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:16,609
All full of humour and enjoyment.

236
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:26,829
What a different type of life.

237
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:34,409
That´s what is for you.

238
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:46,589
You have to achieve it without any difficulties.

239
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:52,289
It is very, very simple.

240
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:57,049
Sahaja means "born with you,"

241
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:04,609
is the right to be united, that is yoga, with this All-pervading power.

242
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:16,789
For which you don´t pay.

243
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:21,109
But it is a collective happening

244
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:23,729
it´s a collective organism,

245
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,909
so you have to be collective.

246
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:36,129
If one nail is cut out, it doesn´t grow.

247
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:50,009
Now see how Germans and Austrians have come to your town

248
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:52,769
and arranged this program.

249
00:47:03,689 --> 00:47:06,689
How so many English going to Russia.

250
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:14,809
Like there is one finger which has some pain, the whole body

251
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:21,089
goes to it to get it alright.

252
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:36,229
So it will take hardly about ten minutes from you

253
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:38,969
to get your realization.

254
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,889
But there are three conditions.

255
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:52,749
Which are very simple.

256
00:47:57,149 --> 00:48:01,209
The first one is that

257
00:48:01,929 --> 00:48:06,409
you should not feel guilty at all.

258
00:48:11,549 --> 00:48:14,189
It´s a fashion nowadays to feel guilty.

259
00:48:18,169 --> 00:48:22,409
After all, you are human beings and human beings all make mistakes.

260
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:26,289
You are not God.

261
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:36,149
If you make mistakes, let´s face it, why feel guilty?

262
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:48,609
By feeling guilty, this centre here on the left side

263
00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:51,129
goes out of order.

264
00:48:56,649 --> 00:48:59,849
And physically also you may suffer from angina,

265
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,849
or from spondylitis or from lethargic organs all over the body.

266
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:23,589
Don´t believe people who tell you you are sinners.

267
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:29,369
They are the greatest sinners who tell you like that.

268
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:37,689
After all you are human beings, you are at the epitomy of evolution.

269
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:48,869
The second condition is

270
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:54,089
that you have to forgive evryone in general.

271
00:50:03,049 --> 00:50:07,689
Logically whether you forgive or you don´t forgive, you don´t do anything.

272
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:12,669
But if you don´t forgive,

273
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:16,669
than you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

274
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:29,129
So you don´t even have to think about them, you have to just

275
00:50:30,249 --> 00:50:35,289
in general, say " I forgive everyone," it´s nonsense.

276
00:50:40,649 --> 00:50:43,289
Also it is a myth.

277
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:53,529
Now there is a center within us on the optic chiasm which is like this.

278
00:50:54,669 --> 00:50:56,669
Closed.

279
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:08,849
And if you don´t forgive,

280
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:11,549
then it doesn´t open.

281
00:51:12,029 --> 00:51:14,589
But if you forgive, it opens like this.

282
00:51:18,669 --> 00:51:22,069
You feel much lighter and

283
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:25,229
Kundalini may pass through.

284
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:38,789
All your life you tortured yourself by not forgiving.

285
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:42,649
And at this moment you will miss the great point

286
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:45,509
of achieving your realization.

287
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:01,349
Now the third condition is

288
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:06,329
that you have to have full faith in yourself,

289
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:11,029
full confidence that you will all get your realization tonight.

290
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:29,609
It sounds fantastic but you are fantastic.

291
00:52:30,029 --> 00:52:36,769
You don´t know yourself. Once you know yourself, you will be amazed,

292
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:39,729
how many powers you have.

293
00:52:41,789 --> 00:52:45,729
What you can do to yourself and to  the whole world.

294
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:58,249
Unless and until this microphone is connected to the mains, it has no identity, it has no meaning.

295
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,689
But as soon as you are connected to the mains,

296
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:16,989
you know what you are.

297
00:53:23,029 --> 00:53:25,549
These are the three conditions

298
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:28,009
I hope you will fulfill.

299
00:53:39,629 --> 00:53:42,589
As it is I think you are very sensible people,

300
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:47,009
the way you have elected your president,

301
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:58,649
the whole  world knows that.

302
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:07,069
So now those who do not want to have their realization,

303
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:13,809
should know that I cannot force it on you.

304
00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:23,669
Because I respect your freedom.

305
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:29,209
It´s a last judgement,

306
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:32,429
you have to judge yourself.

307
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:39,969
In Quran it is said that at the time of resurrection

308
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:42,289
your hands will speak.

309
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:46,109
They give a witness against you.

310
00:54:56,049 --> 00:54:59,489
And these hands will tell you what´s wrong with you and

311
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:02,329
what´s wrong with others.

312
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:09,029
And if you know how to correct your centers,

313
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:11,029
you can correct yourself

314
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:13,709
and you can correct others.

315
00:55:23,669 --> 00:55:27,989
Those who do not want to have realization, should leave the hall.

316
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:38,589
Of course, Sahajayoga is not meant for idiots and stupid people.

317
00:55:43,429 --> 00:55:46,549
And it´s not meant for  arrogant people either.

318
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:55,149
Also for people who are involved in some sort of an ideology or

319
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:01,669
some sort of blind faith.

320
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:18,849
Again I request those who do not want to have their self-realization,

321
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,189
they should leave the hall.

322
00:56:44,729 --> 00:56:47,769
You have to be pleasently placed to yourself,

323
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:54,629
now please

324
00:56:55,329 --> 00:57:00,049
you have to remove your shoes,

325
00:57:00,729 --> 00:57:02,809
because this Mother Earth also

326
00:57:03,189 --> 00:57:05,349
helps us to suck in our problems.

327
00:57:30,129 --> 00:57:34,049
Now the left and the right are two powers,

328
00:57:34,589 --> 00:57:36,029
one is for your desire

329
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:37,949
and another for action.

330
00:57:48,649 --> 00:57:52,169
So you have to put both your feet apart from each other

331
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,729
and sit comfortably.

332
00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:04,329
You don´t have to go to the Himalayas and stand on your head.

333
00:58:10,229 --> 00:58:13,749
You will get your realization in your seats tonight.

334
00:58:19,709 --> 00:58:24,169
So now please put your left hand

335
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:29,389
towards Me on your left hip or left.

336
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:43,549
Beacuse this is suggestive or symbolic that you

337
00:58:43,629 --> 00:58:47,269
desire to have your self-realization.

338
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:58,229
You have to have Pure desire.

339
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:06,089
The right hand we use for nourishing our centers on the lefthand side of ourselves.

340
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:15,549
This we do it only

341
00:59:15,909 --> 00:59:18,629
for tonight you don´t have to do it later.

342
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:29,189
So now please put your right hand on your heart.

343
00:59:29,189 --> 00:59:31,189
Somebody will show it.

344
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:45,709
In the heart resides the Spirit.

345
00:59:49,189 --> 00:59:52,429
If you become the Spirit, in the light of your Spirit,

346
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:55,269
you become your own master.

347
01:00:03,649 --> 01:00:07,069
So you have to take your right hand

348
01:00:07,389 --> 01:00:12,329
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

349
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:24,549
This is the center of your mastery.

350
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:33,109
Which is created by all the great Prophets.

351
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:44,529
It has to be enlightened.

352
01:00:45,569 --> 01:00:52,189
So now you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the lefthand side.

353
01:00:57,449 --> 01:01:04,109
This is the center of Pure divine knowledge.

354
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:15,689
We will know about it later on,

355
01:01:16,129 --> 01:01:20,909
how it caters to the Divine knowledge.

356
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:44,769
Now please raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

357
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:55,489
now on your heart.

358
01:01:57,289 --> 01:02:06,049
Now in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right.

359
01:02:14,229 --> 01:02:20,889
I have already told you what happens to you when this center is out of care.

360
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:33,129
Now take your right hand on your forehead across and put out your head.

361
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:46,169
This is the center for forgiving everyone in general.

362
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:55,529
Now please take back your right hand

363
01:02:55,529 --> 01:02:58,709
on the backside of your head and push back.

364
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:01,149
as far as possible.

365
01:03:09,569 --> 01:03:18,769
This center, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction.

366
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:33,589
You have to ask for forgiveness.

367
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:36,229
From this Divine power.

368
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,669
Now the last center is important.

369
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:50,809
Please stretch your palm fully.

370
01:03:55,669 --> 01:04:01,769
Put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area

371
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:06,089
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

372
01:04:15,909 --> 01:04:19,529
Push back your fingers as far as possible.

373
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,529
Press it hard,

374
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:31,989
move your scalp and move it seven times slowly, clockwise.

375
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:48,949
That´s all you have to do.

376
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:58,149
Now we have to close our eyes,

377
01:05:01,229 --> 01:05:05,709
before that please see that both your feet are apart from each other

378
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:16,729
Put the left hand toward Me like this.

379
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,649
Right hand on the heart.

380
01:05:27,649 --> 01:05:30,929
Do not concentrate, do not pressurize your mind.

381
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:39,789
Everything will work out spontaneously.

382
01:05:45,329 --> 01:05:46,689
Now close your eyes.

383
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:49,349
And please don´t open them till I tell you.

384
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:03,529
Here you have to ask Me a fundamental question

385
01:06:03,789 --> 01:06:05,709
about yourself three times.

386
01:06:06,649 --> 01:06:09,129
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

387
01:06:20,229 --> 01:06:22,709
Please ask three times in your heart.

388
01:06:26,409 --> 01:06:28,009
Mother, am I the Spirit?

389
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:38,829
I have told you, when you become the Spirit,

390
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,629
you become your own master.

391
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:58,069
So take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

392
01:06:58,069 --> 01:06:58,949
press it hard

393
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:07,189
and here ask another fundamental question about yourself to Me.

394
01:07:15,089 --> 01:07:19,569
Ask a question: "Mother, am I my own master?"

395
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,069
Three times.

396
01:07:33,789 --> 01:07:37,229
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

397
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:41,129
I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

398
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:59,049
Take out your hand

399
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:06,429
on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

400
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:19,369
Here you have to ask for Pure knowledge.

401
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:29,569
Here ask 6 times because this center has got 6 petals.

402
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:34,209
Mother please give me Pure knowledge.

403
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:02,449
As soon as you ask for Pure knowledge,

404
01:09:02,589 --> 01:09:07,149
the Kundalini starts rising and we have to nourish the upper centers

405
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,569
with our full confidence.

406
01:09:21,229 --> 01:09:26,829
So now raise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen

407
01:09:27,389 --> 01:09:30,289
on the left hand side and press it hard

408
01:09:30,409 --> 01:09:34,889
here you ahve to say with full confidence 10 times,

409
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:39,109
Mother, I am my own master.

410
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:17,249
I alreday told you that you are not this body, this mind, this ego

411
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:19,269
these conditionings but

412
01:10:19,469 --> 01:10:21,389
you are the Pure Spirit.

413
01:10:32,509 --> 01:10:35,709
So now raise your right hand on your heart and say

414
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,549
with full confidence 12 times

415
01:10:38,049 --> 01:10:40,869
Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.

416
01:10:58,709 --> 01:11:00,869
This All-pervading power is the

417
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:04,749
ocean of knowledge.

418
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:16,209
It is the ocean of joy and blessings.

419
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:27,009
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

420
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:31,609
Whatever misteakes you might have committed,

421
01:11:36,689 --> 01:11:42,529
it can be easily dissolved by this power of forgiveness.

422
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:58,109
So now forgive yourself and raise your hand to the border of your neck and turn your head to the right.

423
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:15,329
Here you have to say with full confidence 16 times

424
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:19,609
Mother I am not guilty at all.

425
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,109
I have already told you that logically

426
01:12:36,109 --> 01:12:38,489
whether you forgive or you don´t forgive

427
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:40,209
you don´t do anything.

428
01:12:48,049 --> 01:12:50,669
But you torture yourself.

429
01:12:56,009 --> 01:13:04,969
At this junction if you don´t forgive, the center won´t open and Kundalini won´t pass.

430
01:13:21,989 --> 01:13:27,229
So please forgive all of them in general, not thinking about them.

431
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:40,929
Now raise your right hand on the forehead across and put your head down

432
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:45,089
and here you have to say from your heart, not how many times

433
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:50,569
Mother, I forgive everyone in general.

434
01:14:08,349 --> 01:14:11,229
Now without feeling guilty

435
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:12,989
without counting your mistakes

436
01:14:13,789 --> 01:14:15,709
just for your satisfaction,

437
01:14:16,789 --> 01:14:21,529
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

438
01:14:40,789 --> 01:14:43,589
Take your hand on the backside of your head

439
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:46,449
and push back your head

440
01:14:46,609 --> 01:14:49,029
and here with full confidence from your heart, not how many times -

441
01:14:51,289 --> 01:14:56,429
you have to say - Divine Power if I have done wrong,

442
01:14:56,849 --> 01:15:00,049
knowingly or unknowingly, please forogive me.

443
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:24,009
The last center is important.

444
01:15:24,309 --> 01:15:26,909
Where you have to stretch your palm fully

445
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,289
and put the center of your palm

446
01:15:29,289 --> 01:15:31,229
on top of the fontanel bone area

447
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:33,969
which is a soft bone in your childhood

448
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:56,729
Put down your head and push back your fingers so there is sufficient pressure on your scalp.

449
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,509
Here again I cannot force self-realization on you

450
01:16:13,509 --> 01:16:14,949
you have to ask for it.

451
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:20,449
So move your hand seven times clockwise

452
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:26,109
say from your heart - Mother please give me my self-realization.

453
01:16:55,549 --> 01:16:58,209
Please bend your head.

454
01:17:00,289 --> 01:17:01,889
Push back your fingers.

455
01:17:43,669 --> 01:17:46,789
Take down your hands please and open your eyes.

456
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:57,749
Now please put both your hands towards Me.

457
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:10,789
And don´t think.

458
01:18:15,769 --> 01:18:18,649
Now put the right hand towards Me like this.

459
01:18:26,029 --> 01:18:28,509
Put out your head and see for yourself

460
01:18:29,069 --> 01:18:35,229
if there si cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

461
01:18:52,409 --> 01:18:59,329
You shouldn´t put your hand on top of your head, but away from it.

462
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:10,869
Put your left hand towards Me...

463
01:19:12,849 --> 01:19:16,129
not on top, a bit away or you cannot feel it at all.

464
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:24,669
Please put your left hand towards Me.

465
01:19:24,669 --> 01:19:26,849
Bend your head and see for yourself

466
01:19:26,969 --> 01:19:31,689
if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

467
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:53,249
If you have not forgiven yourself or others, it will be hot.

468
01:19:58,469 --> 01:20:00,569
Now forgive.

469
01:20:02,309 --> 01:20:07,909
Lastly again, put right hand towards me, put down your head and see for yourself

470
01:20:08,129 --> 01:20:13,049
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

471
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:35,349
Please bend your heads.

472
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:44,689
Now please raise your both your hands towards the sky like this.

473
01:20:52,749 --> 01:20:56,389
Push back your head upward.

474
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:06,609
Ask any out of these three questions three times.

475
01:21:17,449 --> 01:21:20,309
Please ask

476
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:24,709
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

477
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:36,289
Mother is this the All-pervading power of God´s Love?

478
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:50,569
Mother, is this the Paramachaytanya? Or Ruh?

479
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:55,409
Any of these questions you can ask three times.

480
01:22:05,229 --> 01:22:07,229
Now please take down your hands.

481
01:22:13,769 --> 01:22:16,169
Put your hands like this towards Me.

482
01:22:20,089 --> 01:22:22,809
And don´t think.

483
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:28,179
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips,

484
01:22:29,139 --> 01:22:32,339
or on their heads, palms,

485
01:22:32,419 --> 01:22:36,099
or out of the fontanel bone area,

486
01:22:36,309 --> 01:22:39,909
please raise your hands.

487
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:02,419
All of you. All of you.

488
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:06,879
