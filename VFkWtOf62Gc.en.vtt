00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:35.905
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:42.225
It is said about him, that

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:48.825
He is the first deity that was created on this earth

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:57.105
by Adi Shakti.

00:05:57.305 --> 00:06:01.665
And about his creation, you know the story.

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:06.745
And also you know

00:06:06.945 --> 00:06:12.265
how an elephant´s head was attached to him.

00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:20.585
Today, I am going to tell something more subtler

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:29.465
about him, Kundalini and the Mother Earth.

00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:33.945
He was made out of the Mother Earth,

00:06:37.145 --> 00:06:41.945
with the vibrations of his Mother.

00:06:42.865 --> 00:06:48.185
Now, the significance of Mother Earth,

00:06:48.385 --> 00:06:51.625
we have never understood.

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:55.665
Now look at the Mother Earth,

00:06:56.905 --> 00:07:02.825
She is the one who produces all kinds of

00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:07.985
beautiful flowers of different fragrance,

00:07:08.185 --> 00:07:15.145
of different nature, color, heights.

00:07:15.345 --> 00:07:18.545
The trees are different.

00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:23.585
Trees, when they grow up,

00:07:23.785 --> 00:07:29.025
they grow in such a manner that every leaf,

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:35.305
every leaf of that tree, gets the sun.

00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:39.025
Look at the collective sense

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:44.265
which is given to us by this Mother Earth.

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:49.345
We have never realized that this Mother Earth,

00:07:49.545 --> 00:07:55.145
which is giving us everything that we want

00:07:55.345 --> 00:07:58.905
and the sun helps the Mother Earth,

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:02.625
cooperates, coordinates with Her.

00:08:04.105 --> 00:08:08.465
To go further with it, you have seen that picture

00:08:08.665 --> 00:08:13.705
where the Kundalini is coming out of the Mother Earth,

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:17.385
and half of it is seen.

00:08:18.945 --> 00:08:24.145
So what does this Kundalini do for us?

00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:28.105
Or what does this Mother Earth do for us?

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:35.345
The Kundalini leaves the Mother Earth as a reflection,

00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:40.825
and what does She do within us,

00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:45.825
to build us up in which way?

00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:50.465
So it is the primordial power

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:54.425
which is coming out of the Mother Earth.

00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:58.865
Mother Earth itself acts like a Mother,

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:02.945
She looks after you, She gives you whatever you want,

00:09:03.145 --> 00:09:05.465
and another miraculous thing is

00:09:05.665 --> 00:09:09.105
that the highest tree is a coconut tree,

00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:11.545
and a coconut will never fall

00:09:11.745 --> 00:09:16.145
on any creature or any human being.

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:18.825
That means it´s all thinking,

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:21.705
all understanding, all consciousness,

00:09:21.905 --> 00:09:26.025
all awareness is coming from the Mother Earth.

00:09:26.225 --> 00:09:29.225
But we never understand.

00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:33.065
As it is we take it for granted.

00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:40.025
Now what does She do for us, for us human beings?

00:09:41.425 --> 00:09:44.505
She´s the primordial power.

00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:50.305
What she does is to build in us a primordial

00:09:50.505 --> 00:09:53.105
– what we can call – restrictions

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:58.225
or primordial taboos or primordial dharmas.

00:10:00.665 --> 00:10:05.545
For example, you see the steel is here.

00:10:05.745 --> 00:10:07.905
It has its own dharma,

00:10:08.105 --> 00:10:11.505
it cannot behave like wood.

00:10:11.705 --> 00:10:13.985
Wood has its own dharma,

00:10:14.185 --> 00:10:20.025
it cannot behave like silver.

00:10:20.225 --> 00:10:27.665
They all have their dharma and they are bound in that dharma.

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:33.625
Everything that is in the nature has its own dharma.

00:10:33.825 --> 00:10:36.585
If you see the tiger, if you see the lion,

00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:41.825
if you see a mongoose or if you see a snake,

00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:46.305
they all have their dharma, their style, their everything.

00:10:46.505 --> 00:10:51.305
It´s very surprising, how they are bound by it.

00:10:51.505 --> 00:10:53.785
Once in Prathisthan,

00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:57.625
I went from the other side to my bedroom,

00:10:57.945 --> 00:11:02.265
and I saw a very big snake came out of a hole.

00:11:02.465 --> 00:11:04.625
Of course I was quite away from it,

00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:08.105
but it felt my vibrations and started running away.

00:11:08.305 --> 00:11:11.745
It fell in the swimming pool and it wouldn´t come out.

00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:16.265
So somebody went down and killed it

00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:18.825
and brought his body up there.

00:11:19.025 --> 00:11:23.305
I was surprised; it was such a big one, about six feet,

00:11:23.505 --> 00:11:30.145
but it intertwined itself in a very beautiful pattern,

00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:34.065
surprisingly, when it was there. Alright.

00:11:34.665 --> 00:11:39.585
Then what they did, they said that, “Mother, if we leave it,

00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:44.705
it will fall in the water and again it will come to life,

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.105
so what should we do?

00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:49.665
I said “Let it be then. What do you do?"

00:11:49.865 --> 00:11:53.785
They said “we burn it”. So they burned the snake.

00:11:54.265 --> 00:12:01.025
But the female of the snake came out after 10 days.

00:12:01.185 --> 00:12:03.305
They said “there must be a female”,

00:12:03.505 --> 00:12:05.825
and she was searching for him

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:08.665
when suddenly somebody saw her.

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:12.945
They killed her also, they killed her

00:12:13.105 --> 00:12:16.625
and she also made the same kind of a pattern.

00:12:16.825 --> 00:12:18.145
I was amazed,

00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:20.065
very beautiful pattern

00:12:20.265 --> 00:12:24.025
of the body going round, like this, like this, like this.

00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:28.345
Exactly the same, she also made.

00:12:28.585 --> 00:12:30.425
So I was surprised

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:35.145
how is it that this lady knows how

00:12:35.345 --> 00:12:37.465
to copy her husband?

00:12:37.665 --> 00:12:40.585
She did it, and when we burnt her,

00:12:40.785 --> 00:12:44.145
she was finished of course, both of them were killed.

00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:48.785
But what I felt is that animals,

00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:53.225
creepers, those who creep permanently,

00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:57.625
other people also, every type of animal,

00:12:57.905 --> 00:13:03.425
the whole of biology I studied, I was amazed

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:09.425
that every type of animal has the exact,

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:13.625
the same sample of behavior.

00:13:15.865 --> 00:13:19.145
For example, you can put the dog in the water

00:13:19.345 --> 00:13:22.825
he´ll swim, but the cat may not.

00:13:23.065 --> 00:13:28.065
See it´s a thing that is built in, the dharma,

00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:33.305
what I call the primordial taboos.

00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:38.265
We have in the same way, primordial taboos

00:13:38.465 --> 00:13:43.065
built within us, which are dharma.

00:13:44.105 --> 00:13:47.505
A human being has to be like that.

00:13:47.705 --> 00:13:50.465
If he tries to be something else

00:13:50.665 --> 00:13:53.425
something goes wrong with his life.

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:57.225
It´s like say if you, you have a glass,

00:13:57.425 --> 00:14:01.625
you drop it on the ground, it will break, that is the dharma.

00:14:01.825 --> 00:14:05.185
In the same way when human beings

00:14:05.385 --> 00:14:09.225
start deviating from the line of dharma,

00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:11.625
they get into trouble.

00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:15.345
But it is only human beings who can do that.

00:14:15.545 --> 00:14:20.105
They can only cross over these taboos, these primordial taboos,

00:14:20.305 --> 00:14:23.785
and can become horrible.

00:14:24.025 --> 00:14:26.185
You see a person,

00:14:26.385 --> 00:14:30.265
sometimes I wonder what´s wrong with him.

00:14:31.345 --> 00:14:36.105
He has a nice home, very good wife, everything,

00:14:36.305 --> 00:14:41.585
then he has a keep (another woman), what is the need?

00:14:41.785 --> 00:14:44.745
For a man it is primordial that he should have

00:14:44.945 --> 00:14:50.545
only one wife, and she, one husband.

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:55.385
It´s a taboo, as soon as you deviate from that

00:14:55.585 --> 00:14:58.185
something goes wrong.

00:14:58.905 --> 00:15:03.105
Now who punishes, or who corrects or who destroys

00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:09.985
is this primordial power which we call as Paramchaitanya.

00:15:13.465 --> 00:15:19.065
If you can understand that it´s a structure.

00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:24.385
Say this is the structure of this hangar,

00:15:24.585 --> 00:15:28.385
now you want to break it, you can break it

00:15:28.585 --> 00:15:31.185
because you are human beings,

00:15:31.385 --> 00:15:33.705
but it will be broken.

00:15:33.905 --> 00:15:35.585
As simple as that,

00:15:35.785 --> 00:15:39.265
we have to understand we are human beings

00:15:39.465 --> 00:15:41.665
and we cannot do things

00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:46.185
which go against our dharma.

00:15:46.385 --> 00:15:49.025
Now why the dharma?

00:15:49.225 --> 00:15:54.105
Dharma has to be there for our ascent.

00:15:55.505 --> 00:16:00.825
Now man, in his intelligence and his progressiveness

00:16:01.025 --> 00:16:05.665
thinks that anything he does – what´s wrong?

00:16:05.945 --> 00:16:09.305
Especially in the west, this is very common.

00:16:09.505 --> 00:16:12.945
But I must say, for the aboriginal people,

00:16:13.145 --> 00:16:15.505
or people who are,

00:16:15.705 --> 00:16:19.105
I mean I don´t know if I should call Indians aboriginal or not.

00:16:19.305 --> 00:16:23.265
But those people who were made aware

00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:27.985
of their primordial taboos somehow.

00:16:28.825 --> 00:16:33.345
As the animals know what is bad for them

00:16:34.145 --> 00:16:42.385
and that knowledge was there with aboriginals.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:47.385
Today we are here with Australians,

00:16:47.585 --> 00:16:52.945
and in Australia aboriginals are so many

00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:58.265
I was surprised, most of their words were Sanskrit.

00:16:58.465 --> 00:17:04.385
So might be they might have got it from India,

00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:07.945
or maybe they have gone there from India.

00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:12.825
So many words they have got which are Sanskrit.

00:17:13.385 --> 00:17:18.585
So I started thinking about them.

00:17:18.905 --> 00:17:23.105
Normally aboriginals, say in India we have aboriginals.

00:17:23.305 --> 00:17:28.625
We call them “gorn, korku, peel”.

00:17:29.305 --> 00:17:33.625
We had a lady who was a maid with us,

00:17:33.825 --> 00:17:36.185
Gaynabai was her name,

00:17:36.385 --> 00:17:38.305
she was an excellent cook,

00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:42.465
but she had her maryadas.

00:17:43.025 --> 00:17:46.065
All the time, like if my father came

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.625
she would immediately cover her head

00:17:48.825 --> 00:17:51.985
and go in the other room, to respect him.

00:17:52.185 --> 00:17:55.625
Nobody told her to do that.

00:17:59.265 --> 00:18:04.705
Their marriage system was also very surprisingly good,

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:08.185
and their relationships with the children also was very good.

00:18:08.385 --> 00:18:12.825
Somehow or another in my childhood I met many of them

00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:16.145
because I also had a habit of going to the jungles

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.305
where I used to meet them

00:18:18.505 --> 00:18:21.385
and I was surprised, they would not drink

00:18:21.585 --> 00:18:27.265
this I´m telling you was about 60 years back, maybe more.

00:18:27.585 --> 00:18:29.265
They would not drink,

00:18:29.505 --> 00:18:34.985
very “lajashi” means shame of everything.

00:18:35.185 --> 00:18:40.625
A matter of, sort of prestige, for them was important.

00:18:40.825 --> 00:18:43.905
They would never steal anything,

00:18:44.105 --> 00:18:46.825
and I was really very impressed,

00:18:47.065 --> 00:18:49.945
how these people were so dharmic,

00:18:50.145 --> 00:18:52.385
so good and happy.

00:18:52.585 --> 00:18:55.385
They lived in huts, they didn´t mind,

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:59.785
but they were very clean and neat people.

00:19:02.065 --> 00:19:05.745
It is now changed.

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:10.065
The same people have changed so much.

00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:22.985
I mean they were like sacred people, I tell you, holy people.

00:19:25.065 --> 00:19:26.985
They worship Mother,

00:19:27.185 --> 00:19:31.305
they worship Mother Earth, nothing else,

00:19:31.665 --> 00:19:35.305
and I asked this lady “why do you worship Mother Earth?”.

00:19:35.505 --> 00:19:37.905
She said “she gives us everything.

00:19:38.105 --> 00:19:40.305
She is a just Mother,

00:19:40.505 --> 00:19:43.905
we live in the jungles, she looks after us,

00:19:44.105 --> 00:19:49.145
and she is the most conscious person,

00:19:49.345 --> 00:19:53.865
she knows that we are there and she has to look after us”.

00:19:55.545 --> 00:20:02.345
Even to take out some leaves from the trees,

00:20:02.545 --> 00:20:06.305
they used to think about it.

00:20:06.505 --> 00:20:09.185
But then the missionaries came,

00:20:09.385 --> 00:20:11.705
they converted them,

00:20:11.905 --> 00:20:13.625
they gave them skirts and blouses

00:20:13.825 --> 00:20:15.985
and I don´t know what all they did.

00:20:16.185 --> 00:20:17.785
But Gaynabai did not take,

00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:19.865
she said “what is this?”

00:20:20.065 --> 00:20:22.225
Why should I wear a dress like this

00:20:22.425 --> 00:20:24.745
where the whole body is exposed?

00:20:24.945 --> 00:20:28.505
No I´ll wear a sari, I can never give it up.

00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:32.465
Why should I wear this kind of a useless dress?”

00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:39.585
But when they met with these so called advanced people

00:20:39.785 --> 00:20:44.265
so many of them started living like that.

00:20:46.065 --> 00:20:47.985
They said “you have no freedom;

00:20:48.185 --> 00:20:51.745
you are just bound by something, by someone”.

00:20:51.945 --> 00:20:56.905
But actually they were bound by the sacredness,

00:20:57.105 --> 00:21:01.265
by the divine understanding

00:21:01.465 --> 00:21:05.025
and then they started changing.

00:21:05.225 --> 00:21:08.065
She was alright, her husband was alright

00:21:08.265 --> 00:21:10.505
but her son started drinking,

00:21:10.705 --> 00:21:12.585
this is the beginning of the end,

00:21:12.785 --> 00:21:17.825
then gambling and all other sorts of things he started.

00:21:18.025 --> 00:21:23.825
Then her grandson started going to prostitutes,

00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:29.185
and the idea was only that “we are free,

00:21:29.385 --> 00:21:31.825
what´s wrong?”

00:21:34.825 --> 00:21:37.185
Now these primordial taboos

00:21:37.385 --> 00:21:42.105
are in you, built in. They are there.

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:49.185
These are existing maybe in a potential state,

00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:51.145
maybe you have curbed them down,

00:21:51.345 --> 00:21:55.025
maybe you have turned them out,

00:21:55.705 --> 00:21:58.025
but they are there.

00:21:58.225 --> 00:22:01.345
All the time they are there,

00:22:02.065 --> 00:22:07.025
and that´s what we say that you are leaving the maryadas,

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:12.265
or else we say that you are insulting Shri Ganesh.

00:22:12.465 --> 00:22:17.705
So when Mother created this universe,

00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:23.145
first deity was Shri Ganesh.

00:22:24.745 --> 00:22:27.985
Auspiciousness was created.

00:22:28.185 --> 00:22:32.185
Now, we don´t understand what is auspiciousness.

00:22:32.425 --> 00:22:39.865
Auspiciousness is a complete understanding

00:22:40.065 --> 00:22:52.065
of primordial restrictions, and also of the protocol.

00:22:54.305 --> 00:22:58.345
For example, in India we all used to do that,

00:22:58.545 --> 00:23:02.065
though I was in a Christian family,

00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:04.625
that before touching the Mother Earth,

00:23:04.825 --> 00:23:06.905
getting up from the bed,

00:23:07.105 --> 00:23:10.185
we used to say “Oh Mother Earth, please forgive us

00:23:10.385 --> 00:23:14.505
because we are touching you with our feet”.

00:23:17.025 --> 00:23:21.305
So respect for the Mother Earth and for nature

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:23.145
is built in within us,

00:23:23.345 --> 00:23:27.905
it´s part and parcel, we are part and parcel of this whole

00:23:28.105 --> 00:23:32.825
we can call it whole universe.

00:23:33.265 --> 00:23:40.265
But when you get into this nonsensical idea of freedom

00:23:40.625 --> 00:23:45.385
then you are leaving your Mother Earth,

00:23:45.865 --> 00:23:49.945
your gravity itself reduces.

00:23:51.825 --> 00:23:56.465
This Mother Earth has to teach us,

00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:59.585
while we are plundering everything,

00:23:59.785 --> 00:24:02.745
the ecology, their ecology – ecology people are trying.

00:24:02.945 --> 00:24:06.865
Whatever is outside is also inside.

00:24:07.065 --> 00:24:12.345
If you want to exploit your Mother inside,

00:24:12.545 --> 00:24:16.745
or if you want to trouble your Mother inside,

00:24:16.945 --> 00:24:21.225
you can also trouble this Mother Earth.

00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:30.345
Now what has replaced our understanding is very simple,

00:24:30.545 --> 00:24:42.105
is that we are paying more attention to money.

00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:48.465
If you can cut a tree you say, to get money,

00:24:48.945 --> 00:24:52.225
then it is hurting the Mother.

00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:56.105
But if you are cutting the tree for beautifying her,

00:24:56.305 --> 00:24:58.305
then she´s happy.

00:24:58.505 --> 00:25:01.785
Her discretion is so great,

00:25:01.985 --> 00:25:06.145
see the way she produces flowers.

00:25:06.345 --> 00:25:08.945
Different, different types of flowers.

00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:13.385
In different countries, different types of flowers.

00:25:13.665 --> 00:25:16.025
Like I saw in my country

00:25:16.225 --> 00:25:19.785
that flowers are extremely fragrant,

00:25:20.265 --> 00:25:22.705
very fragrant.

00:25:22.905 --> 00:25:29.945
And she understands so much.

00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:33.465
Once I went to Australia

00:25:33.825 --> 00:25:37.465
and this flower you call hibiscus,

00:25:39.345 --> 00:25:43.225
it´s a red flower, it becomes pink and then red,

00:25:43.425 --> 00:25:46.265
imagine it becomes first pink

00:25:46.465 --> 00:25:49.185
and then gradually it becomes red.

00:25:49.385 --> 00:25:54.265
Even the sunflower goes on turning its face with the sun.

00:25:54.465 --> 00:25:57.065
Now how can you say there is no connection

00:25:57.265 --> 00:26:01.265
between a sunflower and the sun?

00:26:01.945 --> 00:26:05.385
Automatically it goes on changing.

00:26:06.025 --> 00:26:10.785
So these hibiscus flowers are the flowers

00:26:10.985 --> 00:26:14.905
which we use to worship Shri Ganesh,

00:26:15.105 --> 00:26:19.265
and the program was to worship Shri Ganesh.

00:26:19.465 --> 00:26:25.825
On the way I saw so many trees of hibiscus, just flowering.

00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:29.625
I said “at this time so many flowers”.

00:26:29.825 --> 00:26:34.465
I said “I think you´d better get these flowers for the puja”.

00:26:34.665 --> 00:26:40.785
I went and when I arrived in the hall

00:26:40.985 --> 00:26:46.225
all the Sahaja Yogis had got hibiscus on their own.

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:49.345
I never talked to them, just on their own.

00:26:49.545 --> 00:26:52.625
They didn´t know that it is to be used for Shri Ganesh

00:26:52.825 --> 00:26:57.465
but the Mother Earth herself created at that time.

00:26:58.545 --> 00:27:03.745
This is the time of Shri Ganesh when you should get hibiscus.

00:27:05.185 --> 00:27:07.425
It´s very remarkable

00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:11.665
how the nature is so much within us

00:27:11.825 --> 00:27:15.345
and how this, whatever it is within us,

00:27:15.545 --> 00:27:21.105
guides outside and receives the blessings.

00:27:21.265 --> 00:27:24.025
We are not something separate.

00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:27.465
This Mother Earth is our home,

00:27:27.665 --> 00:27:33.585
we have a home in her and she has a home within us.

00:27:34.545 --> 00:27:37.945
I said today that for Shri Ganesha,

00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:40.665
He had a body of the clay,

00:27:40.825 --> 00:27:43.025
just ordinary clay.

00:27:43.985 --> 00:27:45.785
So you can imagine,

00:27:45.985 --> 00:27:48.065
if you can really think of it,

00:27:48.265 --> 00:27:54.265
how this whole universe has created us;

00:27:56.265 --> 00:27:59.225
all of it is within us

00:27:59.425 --> 00:28:03.225
and when we try to hurt something,

00:28:04.905 --> 00:28:09.305
then we are hurting ourselves.

00:28:11.505 --> 00:28:15.465
The intelligence of Mother Earth

00:28:15.665 --> 00:28:18.985
I have seen from my childhood.

00:28:20.425 --> 00:28:25.665
It´s such a beautiful thing to know the nature

00:28:25.865 --> 00:28:27.185
and the Mother Earth

00:28:27.385 --> 00:28:30.705
that´s why all the saints, in India especially,

00:28:30.905 --> 00:28:34.265
used to go and live in the forest.

00:28:34.465 --> 00:28:38.545
Only in the forest you could see clearly

00:28:38.745 --> 00:28:47.785
how this primordial bondage was absolutely obeyed,

00:28:47.985 --> 00:28:52.585
absolutely obeyed, naturally by the nature.

00:28:53.425 --> 00:28:56.145
For us it is difficult,

00:28:56.345 --> 00:29:01.865
we are rather, “free” people.

00:29:03.985 --> 00:29:10.705
So simple things, simple things like a woman

00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:16.545
should be always covered properly in her body.

00:29:16.745 --> 00:29:19.145
Because she respects her body,

00:29:19.345 --> 00:29:21.825
she respects her chastity.

00:29:22.025 --> 00:29:24.585
But if you tell this to somebody

00:29:24.785 --> 00:29:26.825
they won´t listen.

00:29:27.025 --> 00:29:31.785
As you see the evergreens, they are always clad,

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:35.425
no leaf falls off.

00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:39.465
I call them as the females,

00:29:39.665 --> 00:29:42.825
and the other trees, deciduous,

00:29:43.025 --> 00:29:48.865
they do lose their leaves so I call them as men.

00:29:49.065 --> 00:29:51.905
Because they are men.

00:29:52.105 --> 00:29:54.505
Here it´s the other way round, I have seen.

00:29:54.705 --> 00:29:56.385
If I used to go to any party

00:29:56.585 --> 00:30:00.065
somehow or another they thought I was a very serene person,

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:01.905
you meet someone, immediately

00:30:02.105 --> 00:30:04.985
the man will button up himself

00:30:05.185 --> 00:30:07.985
and the women will open themselves.

00:30:08.185 --> 00:30:12.025
I said the whole brain from here has gone to this side

00:30:12.225 --> 00:30:14.825
and this one has gone this side.

00:30:15.025 --> 00:30:17.705
It´s so stupid.

00:30:17.905 --> 00:30:21.305
But even Mrs. Thatcher they said that she said,

00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:27.265
that it is our culture that women must expose their bodies.

00:30:27.465 --> 00:30:31.705
For what? Are they prostitutes or what?

00:30:35.225 --> 00:30:38.705
So this craze of exposure of the body

00:30:38.905 --> 00:30:43.545
has become so strong now that even in India,

00:30:43.745 --> 00:30:46.385
it´s not on the streets or in the household,

00:30:46.585 --> 00:30:49.265
but in the cinema, in films, you see women,

00:30:49.465 --> 00:30:52.185
really this never happens in India.

00:30:52.385 --> 00:30:54.825
What you see in the films, never happens!

00:30:55.025 --> 00:30:56.945
If they start wearing dresses like that

00:30:57.145 --> 00:31:00.985
so many people will throw stones at them.

00:31:03.225 --> 00:31:07.265
Then all other sorts of,

00:31:07.745 --> 00:31:12.545
I shouldn´t say clumpsy but very grotesque

00:31:12.745 --> 00:31:18.185
things happened, like, I can´t understand

00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:23.545
man having relation with man, woman having relation with woman,

00:31:23.745 --> 00:31:27.705
and children, and this and that and that.

00:31:29.145 --> 00:31:32.825
We didn´t know these things in India, I didn´t know.

00:31:33.065 --> 00:31:35.825
Why? Why has it happened here?

00:31:36.025 --> 00:31:39.425
I don´t think 50 years back they used to do that,

00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:42.305
also in these countries.

00:31:42.505 --> 00:31:46.985
Why have we given up our sense of shame?

00:31:47.185 --> 00:31:51.025
And this kind of nonsense that has come into us.

00:31:51.185 --> 00:31:55.505
I think must be some bhoots in them or badhas in them

00:31:55.705 --> 00:31:57.185
or something horrible,

00:31:57.385 --> 00:32:01.185
but this is something absolutely unnatural.

00:32:01.385 --> 00:32:04.265
Absurd!

00:32:05.905 --> 00:32:10.785
Then a married man having eyes on unmarried women

00:32:10.985 --> 00:32:17.465
and unmarried men are having relations.

00:32:17.665 --> 00:32:21.105
All kinds of things people do.

00:32:21.305 --> 00:32:25.785
And you won´t believe, this doesn´t happen in India.

00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:31.185
Really I tell you, these days it sort of spread out,

00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:36.665
but I would say in good families you don´t have it.

00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:39.345
Somebody told me there is AIDS in India,

00:32:39.545 --> 00:32:42.905
yes because they take bath in the river.

00:32:43.105 --> 00:32:47.705
If they stopped taking bath in the river this will stop.

00:32:47.905 --> 00:32:50.825
I was a medical student, I have studied,

00:32:51.025 --> 00:32:53.425
I came from a very open family,

00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:55.585
I never knew these things,

00:32:55.785 --> 00:32:59.945
that men can do such things, it´s stupid!

00:33:01.785 --> 00:33:04.465
Even in the lunatic asylum in India

00:33:04.665 --> 00:33:07.305
we have never heard of such reports.

00:33:07.505 --> 00:33:10.785
This is absurd!!

00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:20.305
You see the children.

00:33:20.505 --> 00:33:23.625
The other day Guido gave me a present of a girl,

00:33:23.825 --> 00:33:25.385
who was feeling shy,

00:33:25.585 --> 00:33:29.385
you know, the little girl was holding her frock like this and feeling shy.

00:33:29.865 --> 00:33:37.425
Shyness is the ornament of women.

00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:40.945
Children are all shy.

00:33:41.345 --> 00:33:43.425
I remember my granddaughter

00:33:43.625 --> 00:33:47.825
she was once watching one magazine,

00:33:48.065 --> 00:33:51.305
she was very small, two years or so.

00:33:51.505 --> 00:33:55.985
So she saw one woman in a bikini or something,

00:33:56.185 --> 00:33:58.305
she was hitting her, “what are you doing?”

00:33:58.505 --> 00:33:59.825
She saw in the magazine.

00:34:00.065 --> 00:34:02.625
My grandmother will come

00:34:02.825 --> 00:34:05.145
and give you two slaps, you shut up!

00:34:05.345 --> 00:34:07.185
Please wear your dresses”.

00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:11.785
They would not. Children don´t like, have you noticed it.

00:34:11.985 --> 00:34:14.785
I don´t know if they are advanced,

00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:19.945
but normally children don´t like it, this shamelessness.

00:34:20.265 --> 00:34:23.105
But the shamelessness has gone,

00:34:23.305 --> 00:34:25.745
to such an extent

00:34:25.945 --> 00:34:31.625
that to them keeping nude is a very great advancement.

00:34:36.225 --> 00:34:40.985
This is nothing.

00:34:42.265 --> 00:34:46.585
Somebody told me that he wanted to save the aboriginals

00:34:46.785 --> 00:34:49.305
but they were so much,

00:34:49.505 --> 00:34:55.265
so much impressed by the white skin,

00:34:55.465 --> 00:34:57.665
that they accepted everything.

00:34:57.865 --> 00:34:59.985
But they were even having relations

00:35:00.185 --> 00:35:04.025
with their own sister, daughter, mother.

00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:07.025
Competition.

00:35:09.265 --> 00:35:11.745
These are the subjects,

00:35:11.945 --> 00:35:14.785
it´s rather heinous to talk about,

00:35:14.985 --> 00:35:18.545
and I can´t understand

00:35:18.745 --> 00:35:23.305
how can a human being go to that level.

00:35:24.025 --> 00:35:30.065
And at this time we have Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:32.705 --> 00:35:36.185
where you have become aware, aware

00:35:36.385 --> 00:35:40.465
of your natural taboos.

00:35:40.665 --> 00:35:43.665
It is there, because I told you, potentially it is there,

00:35:43.825 --> 00:35:48.145
it is enlightened and suddenly you have accepted.

00:35:48.585 --> 00:35:51.465
I never expected so much, I tell you,

00:35:51.665 --> 00:35:55.225
but you have accepted it,

00:35:55.985 --> 00:35:58.865
and not only that, but you are enjoying it,

00:35:59.065 --> 00:36:01.745
your practicing it.

00:36:03.425 --> 00:36:07.665
You see the lives of all the great saints.

00:36:10.425 --> 00:36:14.345
You can´t have something, like Diana,

00:36:14.545 --> 00:36:16.465
see, they are going to call her a saint.

00:36:16.665 --> 00:36:19.505
She had no maryadas.

00:36:20.145 --> 00:36:21.905
Oh I have sympathies with her because

00:36:22.105 --> 00:36:24.705
her husband tortured her or maybe something,

00:36:24.905 --> 00:36:29.065
but maryadas are very important.

00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:32.385
How can she be a saint?

00:36:32.585 --> 00:36:38.025
Now if you become just an ordinary human being

00:36:38.225 --> 00:36:43.585
who has his taboos, who understands, who is aware,

00:36:44.465 --> 00:36:47.785
then they will say, “Oh what a man he was”,

00:36:47.985 --> 00:36:51.025
I mean that´s what he was,

00:36:51.225 --> 00:36:53.185
he was born like that,

00:36:53.385 --> 00:36:57.705
so such a man is praised, in the West especially.

00:36:57.905 --> 00:37:01.065
Also the other way round is that,

00:37:01.265 --> 00:37:05.065
now the majority is the law.

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:08.145
If the majority is stupid,

00:37:08.345 --> 00:37:13.745
then all the stupidity is regarded as great.

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:19.545
They have no brains they have no intelligence

00:37:19.745 --> 00:37:23.225
to understand how can these things help;

00:37:23.425 --> 00:37:26.185
alcohol for example.

00:37:26.385 --> 00:37:31.905
I mean alcohol, it has done no good to anyone,

00:37:32.705 --> 00:37:38.745
but alcohol, without alcohol you are no good.

00:37:38.945 --> 00:37:40.505
They won´t talk to you they say that

00:37:40.705 --> 00:37:44.585
unless you have alcohol you cannot talk.

00:37:47.185 --> 00:37:49.105
And it is so rampant,

00:37:49.305 --> 00:37:53.145
it is so much in the society

00:37:53.345 --> 00:37:55.745
that all the parties I attended,

00:37:55.945 --> 00:37:59.745
except for me and my husband, everybody was drinking,

00:37:59.945 --> 00:38:05.265
and drinking much more than normal because it was free.

00:38:06.705 --> 00:38:08.905
They are all poisons,

00:38:09.105 --> 00:38:11.585
these are all poisons

00:38:11.745 --> 00:38:18.185
spoiling us completely from one to another.

00:38:18.385 --> 00:38:25.505
This one is a taboo now, for cigarettes,

00:38:25.705 --> 00:38:29.545
imagine – why to smoke?

00:38:29.745 --> 00:38:33.985
I don´t understand, like a chimney people are smoking.

00:38:34.185 --> 00:38:38.825
But they have no courage to give it up now.

00:38:39.025 --> 00:38:42.065
Everywhere, no smoke, no smoke, no smoke.

00:38:42.265 --> 00:38:48.585
When will they start “no alcohol?”

00:38:50.465 --> 00:38:55.785
Everybody sees that it´s so dangerous.

00:38:55.985 --> 00:38:59.505
It is against human awareness, everybody sees it.

00:38:59.705 --> 00:39:01.305
You see people falling down,

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:05.985
you see people cursing each other, fighting.

00:39:06.185 --> 00:39:09.705
I tell you, if you stop this alcoholism

00:39:09.905 --> 00:39:14.025
all this shamelessness will go away.

00:39:14.705 --> 00:39:18.785
Because when you take alcohol your awareness is abated.

00:39:18.985 --> 00:39:20.625
One alcoholic told me

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:26.185
“when I take alcohol I don´t see my sister as my sister,

00:39:26.385 --> 00:39:30.025
but see her as my beloved”.

00:39:30.225 --> 00:39:34.065
Well how do you do that? “Yes”.

00:39:34.385 --> 00:39:40.625
But for all social status and all that you must drink.

00:39:41.265 --> 00:39:43.785
Now, we don´t even understand how

00:39:43.985 --> 00:39:50.545
our primordial taboos are completely battered

00:39:50.745 --> 00:39:54.385
by the society here.

00:39:56.225 --> 00:40:01.985
The simple thing is that

00:40:09.585 --> 00:40:16.825
to understand your own self,

00:40:17.025 --> 00:40:21.145
better sometimes to see the stupid people,

00:40:21.345 --> 00:40:25.505
you´ll be amazed what sort of things they are doing

00:40:25.665 --> 00:40:28.905
because I have seen, I used to be very amazed

00:40:29.105 --> 00:40:31.585
what are they doing?

00:40:31.785 --> 00:40:36.225
And then to cover it up, to cover it up,

00:40:37.505 --> 00:40:42.865
they have etiquettes you know, very elite.

00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:46.225
They talk in a very special manner,

00:40:46.425 --> 00:40:50.545
move themselves in a very,

00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:57.905
I should say, like a trained personality

00:40:58.105 --> 00:41:05.905
and anybody who doesn´t do that is out of their sight.

00:41:06.545 --> 00:41:11.545
They think that He lacks eliteness.

00:41:13.105 --> 00:41:19.665
So another idea is that we have to be elite.

00:41:22.305 --> 00:41:25.625
Ganesha is how made – you see that.

00:41:27.625 --> 00:41:32.905
Look at him, He´s by no means elite.

00:41:33.585 --> 00:41:38.305
He eats like a glutton

00:41:43.225 --> 00:41:48.385
and He looks at you

00:41:48.585 --> 00:41:55.825
as if He´s going to hit you with his mace.

00:41:59.625 --> 00:42:06.905
For Ganesha there is no forgiveness,

00:42:07.105 --> 00:42:13.465
when he became Christ there He developed,

00:42:13.985 --> 00:42:17.585
I don´t know how it worked out,

00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:27.625
but as Ganesha there is not at all forgiveness.

00:42:28.785 --> 00:42:31.945
Don´t try to ask forgiveness from Shri Ganesha,

00:42:32.145 --> 00:42:34.905
He´ll never forgive,

00:42:35.105 --> 00:42:37.705
even if his mother says “now you´d better forgive”,

00:42:37.905 --> 00:42:41.105
“No, that I´ll not do”.

00:42:43.265 --> 00:42:45.425
He never forgives!!

00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:49.465
Then only it comes to the point that the Mother has to say

00:42:49.665 --> 00:42:52.585
“I forgive you”, then He can do it,

00:42:52.785 --> 00:42:54.505
because one thing about Him is,

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:58.905
He´s extremely obedient to his Mother, absolutely,

00:42:59.105 --> 00:43:01.265
so if the Mother has forgiven, finished.

00:43:01.465 --> 00:43:06.065
But otherwise, he will never, never forgive,

00:43:06.265 --> 00:43:13.785
and that´s why all kinds of these horrible diseases are here.

00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:17.785
Thousands of them.

00:43:17.985 --> 00:43:24.825
Also if you don´t respect Him then impotency can come

00:43:25.025 --> 00:43:32.265
or AIDS and all these secret diseases that people have.

00:43:34.385 --> 00:43:40.505
I had a very bad time with people who suffered

00:43:40.705 --> 00:43:43.305
from these secret diseases,

00:43:43.505 --> 00:43:49.785
because Shri Ganesha accepts my forgiveness

00:43:50.065 --> 00:43:54.065
but whenever he has a chance, again He comes back!

00:43:54.265 --> 00:44:00.505
Now see, they are deities with their own dharma.

00:44:00.985 --> 00:44:04.425
They too have their own dharma.

00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:07.825
He gives you a lot of things, he gives you

00:44:08.065 --> 00:44:12.185
mainly wisdom, discretion, understanding,

00:44:12.385 --> 00:44:16.825
but if you don´t obey Him, his qualities,

00:44:17.025 --> 00:44:21.385
then he´s a very difficult man.

00:44:23.545 --> 00:44:26.745
So to tell somebody “Don´t do it” is very difficult,

00:44:26.945 --> 00:44:30.465
but the nature takes respite.

00:44:33.985 --> 00:44:40.505
If you want to become patient it´s not difficult;

00:44:41.105 --> 00:44:44.785
but to get you cured on the Mooladhara

00:44:44.985 --> 00:44:48.185
is very, very difficult.

00:44:48.425 --> 00:44:53.105
You do get cured no doubt, ultimately,

00:44:53.305 --> 00:45:00.225
but the most difficult disease is from Mooladhara.

00:45:00.705 --> 00:45:04.585
He´s a child, alright,

00:45:05.305 --> 00:45:10.865
He´s an eternal child, He´s innocence,

00:45:11.505 --> 00:45:17.585
despite all that He cannot forgive you

00:45:17.785 --> 00:45:21.905
if you disturb your innocence.

00:45:23.545 --> 00:45:26.185
Mother is just the opposite,

00:45:26.385 --> 00:45:30.265
she wants to save at any cost, she wants to save people.

00:45:31.185 --> 00:45:33.945
But not Ganesha,

00:45:34.145 --> 00:45:38.025
Ganesha says “alright,

00:45:40.825 --> 00:45:44.545
you better go to hell”

00:45:44.745 --> 00:45:47.705
and hell is in our own lives here, you see,

00:45:47.905 --> 00:45:50.945
those people who like drinking, smoking,

00:45:51.145 --> 00:45:54.025
prostitution all this – this is all hell.

00:45:54.225 --> 00:45:57.305
What else is hell?

00:45:57.665 --> 00:46:04.945
And he will never save you from hell.

00:46:11.745 --> 00:46:17.185
Only in your Aarti, in Marathi, of Shri Ganesha,

00:46:17.385 --> 00:46:20.225
they say that at the time

00:46:20.425 --> 00:46:24.665
when I am getting my realization

00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:28.945
you must save me.

00:46:29.145 --> 00:46:32.465
That´s the only thing they ask,

00:46:32.665 --> 00:46:38.865
at the time of my resurrection you must save me.

00:46:39.065 --> 00:46:41.185
It does not say that

00:46:41.385 --> 00:46:45.385
at the time of my resurrection you protect me, no!

00:46:45.585 --> 00:46:48.225
You save me.

00:46:49.585 --> 00:46:55.945
Because he´s the one who is sitting on every chakra

00:46:56.145 --> 00:47:00.745
like a vice-chancellor of the university.

00:47:02.225 --> 00:47:05.585
Even if you have Vishnu on your side,

00:47:05.785 --> 00:47:08.305
Mahadeva on your side,

00:47:08.505 --> 00:47:12.305
but if Shri Ganesha is there sitting

00:47:12.505 --> 00:47:17.065
and He says “no, not his ascent”,

00:47:17.265 --> 00:47:22.585
it doesn´t work out, it´s very difficult.

00:47:23.025 --> 00:47:28.185
So now I am telling you this that your children are here.

00:47:28.385 --> 00:47:30.425
In these modern times

00:47:30.625 --> 00:47:34.425
horrible things are happening to children.

00:47:34.625 --> 00:47:40.425
I mean, I think the whole of this negativity is against the innocence.

00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:44.025
Wherever they get the children they misuse them,

00:47:44.225 --> 00:47:46.185
they teach them bad things.

00:47:46.385 --> 00:47:51.185
Even the schools everything is so horrid.

00:47:52.025 --> 00:47:54.545
So then we have to be careful.

00:47:54.745 --> 00:47:59.785
We have to be very very careful about our children.

00:47:59.985 --> 00:48:02.625
We have to guide them properly, look after them,

00:48:02.825 --> 00:48:09.225
and let their primordial taboos should be that,

00:48:09.425 --> 00:48:20.265
that restriction, that taboo, that is to be preserved.

00:48:20.625 --> 00:48:25.745
So if a child does something nice, appreciate it.

00:48:25.945 --> 00:48:28.265
I´m not worried about a child

00:48:28.465 --> 00:48:30.865
being little bit, what you can call,

00:48:31.065 --> 00:48:36.745
being a little bit mischievous, here they have to be.

00:48:36.945 --> 00:48:38.345
It´s alright.

00:48:38.545 --> 00:48:46.505
But if he takes to anything that is anti Ganesha, be careful!

00:48:48.065 --> 00:48:52.305
All kinds of diseases can develop,

00:48:52.785 --> 00:48:57.665
and if they are destroyed in childhood, these taboos,

00:48:57.825 --> 00:49:00.825
then they are very difficult to revive.

00:49:01.065 --> 00:49:05.225
Still I have always said that innocence is never lost,

00:49:05.425 --> 00:49:08.745
only there are some clouds

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:12.945
which try to cover innocence

00:49:13.145 --> 00:49:18.465
and we become rather ignorant about it,

00:49:19.025 --> 00:49:23.345
that we have done anything wrong.

00:49:24.065 --> 00:49:27.305
That is your duty.

00:49:28.105 --> 00:49:31.345
Your society is horrible.

00:49:31.545 --> 00:49:35.145
Next generation I don´t know where it is going to end up.

00:49:35.345 --> 00:49:39.105
When I think about it I really get a fright.

00:49:44.865 --> 00:49:48.025
The solution is that you have to be

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:53.585
careful about your children and their thinking

00:49:53.785 --> 00:50:01.065
and their attitude towards Shri Ganesha.

00:50:01.305 --> 00:50:08.025
They are special lovable things for Shri Ganesha.

00:50:08.225 --> 00:50:12.505
You can´t imagine how he loves the children

00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:17.385
and he´s always there to protect your children,

00:50:17.585 --> 00:50:22.185
if he protects anything it is the children he protects,

00:50:22.425 --> 00:50:29.025
and if you people really understand what I am saying now,

00:50:29.185 --> 00:50:36.425
because if you have to cross this margin

00:50:36.585 --> 00:50:41.225
of human life and spiritual life,

00:50:41.425 --> 00:50:46.145
first thing is your Shri Ganesh!

00:50:48.705 --> 00:50:53.505
When Kundalini rises Shri Ganesh is quiet,

00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:58.225
he just supports the Kundalini to rise.

00:50:59.985 --> 00:51:04.305
He´s the one who also suggests to you

00:51:04.505 --> 00:51:08.705
that it´s the wrong way you are doing things.

00:51:11.265 --> 00:51:17.385
He looks after you, but he´ll not forgive you.

00:51:17.585 --> 00:51:21.985
It is not so difficult.

00:51:22.785 --> 00:51:24.585
The way people talk

00:51:24.825 --> 00:51:28.425
about their physical needs and all this nonsense,

00:51:28.625 --> 00:51:32.905
even the animals don't talk like that.

00:51:33.105 --> 00:51:39.145
Try to enjoy things which will give you real enjoyment.

00:51:39.345 --> 00:51:45.505
For example flowers, nature, garden.

00:51:45.705 --> 00:51:49.345
Instead of destroying this nature, try to build it up,

00:51:49.545 --> 00:51:54.705
try to see how you can make it a beautiful garden,

00:51:54.905 --> 00:51:59.745
or a beautiful place.

00:51:59.945 --> 00:52:02.465
Every time I am here

00:52:02.665 --> 00:52:06.825
I am thinking what should I do with this land here

00:52:07.025 --> 00:52:12.025
which is very barren, how can I change it.

00:52:12.225 --> 00:52:15.385
All the time there is thought

00:52:15.585 --> 00:52:21.625
about how to make it beautiful,

00:52:24.825 --> 00:52:28.585
and in that, if there is innocence,

00:52:28.825 --> 00:52:30.625
no greed,

00:52:30.825 --> 00:52:34.385
there is no competition,

00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:36.465
there is no attachment,

00:52:36.665 --> 00:52:39.625
but just to enjoy the beauty

00:52:39.825 --> 00:52:45.385
of your own creation, to see how things are.

00:52:47.945 --> 00:52:50.985
Out of proportion people have gone,

00:52:51.185 --> 00:52:54.225
out of understanding.

00:52:54.425 --> 00:52:57.785
For example, here or anywhere else in Europe

00:52:57.985 --> 00:53:02.865
you are not supposed to grow anymore fruits.

00:53:03.065 --> 00:53:06.345
Why? Because the price must be kept low.

00:53:06.545 --> 00:53:08.305
If you have so many fruits

00:53:08.505 --> 00:53:14.825
why don´t you send it to places where they don´t have fruits?

00:53:15.265 --> 00:53:20.745
They will destroy it, finish it, but they will not do that.

00:53:21.745 --> 00:53:30.785
So the love and feeling for others is not there,

00:53:31.465 --> 00:53:37.425
and they destroy if something is overproduced by the Mother Earth

00:53:37.625 --> 00:53:41.225
just to keep the prices high.

00:53:41.425 --> 00:53:44.225
Very cruel!

00:53:44.425 --> 00:53:47.305
They are very cruel still.

00:53:47.505 --> 00:53:52.625
Only thinking about money, money, money, money.

00:53:52.865 --> 00:53:55.625
All this happens.

00:53:56.505 --> 00:54:01.625
So it´s still happening

00:54:01.825 --> 00:54:07.825
and I´m sure one day will come when it will all stop.

00:54:10.665 --> 00:54:18.345
The pubs are the best buildings in the village.

00:54:18.945 --> 00:54:26.105
Then the way they glorify drinking

00:54:26.305 --> 00:54:29.305
is the best part of it.

00:54:29.505 --> 00:54:34.345
It´s all done, you see it.

00:54:34.785 --> 00:54:38.625
Now only thing I would like you to have a desire

00:54:38.825 --> 00:54:44.265
that let drinking be finished, like smoking.

00:54:44.705 --> 00:54:50.625
If you think like that might solve a little bit.

00:54:50.825 --> 00:54:52.745
I personally think

00:54:52.945 --> 00:55:00.865
it is with drinking you develop all these perverted attitudes.

00:55:01.225 --> 00:55:06.705
Otherwise if it´s a normal man with a normal brain

00:55:06.905 --> 00:55:10.105
why should he do such things?

00:55:10.305 --> 00:55:14.985
Fighting, quarrelling, killing, violence.

00:55:16.465 --> 00:55:19.985
It´s impossible to understand

00:55:20.185 --> 00:55:24.745
how can a normal person do such a thing.

00:55:24.945 --> 00:55:27.985
Shri Ganesha gives you balance,

00:55:28.185 --> 00:55:32.585
he keeps you on the proper track.

00:55:32.785 --> 00:55:35.465
But if you don´t want to listen to him,

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:38.465
you are thrown away.

00:55:44.985 --> 00:55:50.945
I hope you understand our relationship with nature,

00:55:51.145 --> 00:55:53.105
with Shri Ganesha

00:55:53.305 --> 00:56:00.065
and with our Kundalini is like,

00:56:00.265 --> 00:56:08.385
absolutely identified with each other, absolutely.

00:56:09.665 --> 00:56:12.105
If you start loving the nature

00:56:12.305 --> 00:56:18.425
all these ideas of spoiling your innocence will be finished.

00:56:20.345 --> 00:56:24.105
I used to write poetry, I´m very fond of nature,

00:56:24.305 --> 00:56:29.185
but then I told myself you have to do work for Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:33.185
If you take to poetry they´ll all call you a poetess

00:56:33.385 --> 00:56:36.385
and I don´t want to have any such position

00:56:36.585 --> 00:56:39.545
to be a poetess and all that, I gave it up.

00:56:39.745 --> 00:56:42.105
And I was a very good sportswoman.

00:56:42.305 --> 00:56:47.065
I used to play things, I used to be first in every sort of game

00:56:47.265 --> 00:56:51.225
and I had championship, this and that. I gave it up.

00:56:51.425 --> 00:56:54.545
Whatever I did I used to get into it,

00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:56.385
I studied medicine

00:56:56.585 --> 00:57:01.065
I stood in the first at the whole university. I gave it up.

00:57:02.025 --> 00:57:09.065
Why? Because I´m the Primordial Mother,

00:57:09.265 --> 00:57:13.025
and I have to do the job

00:57:13.225 --> 00:57:17.985
of awakening the primordial nature,

00:57:18.185 --> 00:57:20.545
the dharma within human beings,

00:57:20.745 --> 00:57:24.105
and that´s what I have to do

00:57:25.105 --> 00:57:28.025
and nothing else.

00:57:28.225 --> 00:57:31.065
But for that I don´t do anything I am “Nishkriya”

00:57:31.265 --> 00:57:33.945
I don´t do anything, really I don´t do.

00:57:34.145 --> 00:57:36.145
It is done by the nature.

00:57:36.345 --> 00:57:37.905
Done by Shri Ganesha.

00:57:38.105 --> 00:57:41.785
Vishnu, Mahesha, everybody, they are doing it.

00:57:41.985 --> 00:57:48.785
But, then what is the relationship?

00:57:50.865 --> 00:57:56.345
The relationship is, they are all in my body

00:57:56.545 --> 00:58:00.545
and they are all bound by their own dharma,

00:58:00.745 --> 00:58:02.745
and they act.

00:58:02.945 --> 00:58:04.665
This is the relationship,

00:58:04.825 --> 00:58:09.625
spontaneous, automatic, like a built-in relationship.

00:58:09.825 --> 00:58:11.985
For example, the fan is built in

00:58:12.185 --> 00:58:15.905
so as soon as you push the button it starts moving.

00:58:16.105 --> 00:58:18.425
It´s like that.

00:58:18.625 --> 00:58:21.985
All of them are related to me,

00:58:22.185 --> 00:58:26.105
and they have a tremendous protocol,

00:58:26.305 --> 00:58:28.545
tremendous respect,

00:58:28.745 --> 00:58:36.545
that if I say anything they will not finish it.

00:58:36.745 --> 00:58:39.185
You see this thing is that

00:58:39.385 --> 00:58:45.705
very very deep thing that I am telling you,

00:58:45.905 --> 00:58:50.905
that you are a human being,

00:58:51.105 --> 00:58:53.505
that there is built in.

00:58:53.705 --> 00:58:57.785
Within you are your dharmas

00:58:57.985 --> 00:59:01.705
and if you go against your dharmas

00:59:01.905 --> 00:59:05.585
then you´ll be finished.

00:59:05.785 --> 00:59:09.225
They´re all built in within you,

00:59:09.425 --> 00:59:15.305
they are all there, potentially.

00:59:15.505 --> 00:59:21.465
I hope you´ll understand how important it is

00:59:21.665 --> 00:59:28.305
to be aware of your restrictions within yourself.

00:59:29.145 --> 00:59:31.945
So thank you very much all of you.

00:59:32.145 --> 00:59:34.865
May God bless you!!
