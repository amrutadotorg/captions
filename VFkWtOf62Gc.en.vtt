05:27.065 --> 05:35.905
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

05:36.745 --> 05:42.225
It is said about him, that

05:42.425 --> 05:48.825
He is the first deity that was created on this earth

05:49.025 --> 05:57.105
by Adi Shakti.

05:57.305 --> 06:01.665
And about his creation, you know the story.

06:01.865 --> 06:06.745
And also you know

06:06.945 --> 06:12.265
how an elephant´s head was attached to him.

06:14.265 --> 06:20.585
Today, I am going to tell something more subtler

06:20.825 --> 06:29.465
about him, Kundalini and the Mother Earth.

06:29.745 --> 06:33.945
He was made out of the Mother Earth,

06:37.145 --> 06:41.945
with the vibrations of his Mother.

06:42.865 --> 06:48.185
Now, the significance of Mother Earth,

06:48.385 --> 06:51.625
we have never understood.

06:52.505 --> 06:55.665
Now look at the Mother Earth,

06:56.905 --> 07:02.825
She is the one who produces all kinds of

07:03.065 --> 07:07.985
beautiful flowers of different fragrance,

07:08.185 --> 07:15.145
of different nature, color, heights.

07:15.345 --> 07:18.545
The trees are different.

07:18.825 --> 07:23.585
Trees, when they grow up,

07:23.785 --> 07:29.025
they grow in such a manner that every leaf,

07:30.905 --> 07:35.305
every leaf of that tree, gets the sun.

07:35.505 --> 07:39.025
Look at the collective sense

07:39.225 --> 07:44.265
which is given to us by this Mother Earth.

07:44.465 --> 07:49.345
We have never realized that this Mother Earth,

07:49.545 --> 07:55.145
which is giving us everything that we want

07:55.345 --> 07:58.905
and the sun helps the Mother Earth,

07:59.105 --> 08:02.625
cooperates, coordinates with Her.

08:04.105 --> 08:08.465
To go further with it, you have seen that picture

08:08.665 --> 08:13.705
where the Kundalini is coming out of the Mother Earth,

08:13.905 --> 08:17.385
and half of it is seen.

08:18.945 --> 08:24.145
So what does this Kundalini do for us?

08:24.345 --> 08:28.105
Or what does this Mother Earth do for us?

08:28.865 --> 08:35.345
The Kundalini leaves the Mother Earth as a reflection,

08:35.665 --> 08:40.825
and what does She do within us,

08:41.025 --> 08:45.825
to build us up in which way?

08:46.185 --> 08:50.465
So it is the primordial power

08:50.905 --> 08:54.425
which is coming out of the Mother Earth.

08:54.625 --> 08:58.865
Mother Earth itself acts like a Mother,

08:59.105 --> 09:02.945
She looks after you, She gives you whatever you want,

09:03.145 --> 09:05.465
and another miraculous thing is

09:05.665 --> 09:09.105
that the highest tree is a coconut tree,

09:09.305 --> 09:11.545
and a coconut will never fall

09:11.745 --> 09:16.145
on any creature or any human being.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.825
That means it´s all thinking,

09:19.025 --> 09:21.705
all understanding, all consciousness,

09:21.905 --> 09:26.025
all awareness is coming from the Mother Earth.

09:26.225 --> 09:29.225
But we never understand.

09:29.425 --> 09:33.065
As it is we take it for granted.

09:35.785 --> 09:40.025
Now what does She do for us, for us human beings?

09:41.425 --> 09:44.505
She´s the primordial power.

09:44.705 --> 09:50.305
What she does is to build in us a primordial

09:50.505 --> 09:53.105
– what we can call – restrictions

09:53.305 --> 09:58.225
or primordial taboos or primordial dharmas.

10:00.665 --> 10:05.545
For example, you see the steel is here.

10:05.745 --> 10:07.905
It has its own dharma,

10:08.105 --> 10:11.505
it cannot behave like wood.

10:11.705 --> 10:13.985
Wood has its own dharma,

10:14.185 --> 10:20.025
it cannot behave like silver.

10:20.225 --> 10:27.665
They all have their dharma and they are bound in that dharma.

10:29.265 --> 10:33.625
Everything that is in the nature has its own dharma.

10:33.825 --> 10:36.585
If you see the tiger, if you see the lion,

10:36.785 --> 10:41.825
if you see a mongoose or if you see a snake,

10:42.025 --> 10:46.305
they all have their dharma, their style, their everything.

10:46.505 --> 10:51.305
It´s very surprising, how they are bound by it.

10:51.505 --> 10:53.785
Once in Prathisthan,

10:53.985 --> 10:57.625
I went from the other side to my bedroom,

10:57.945 --> 11:02.265
and I saw a very big snake came out of a hole.

11:02.465 --> 11:04.625
Of course I was quite away from it,

11:04.825 --> 11:08.105
but it felt my vibrations and started running away.

11:08.305 --> 11:11.745
It fell in the swimming pool and it wouldn´t come out.

11:11.945 --> 11:16.265
So somebody went down and killed it

11:16.745 --> 11:18.825
and brought his body up there.

11:19.025 --> 11:23.305
I was surprised; it was such a big one, about six feet,

11:23.505 --> 11:30.145
but it intertwined itself in a very beautiful pattern,

11:30.625 --> 11:34.065
surprisingly, when it was there. Alright.

11:34.665 --> 11:39.585
Then what they did, they said that, “Mother, if we leave it,

11:39.785 --> 11:44.705
it will fall in the water and again it will come to life,

11:44.905 --> 11:47.105
so what should we do?

11:47.305 --> 11:49.665
I said “Let it be then. What do you do?"

11:49.865 --> 11:53.785
They said “we burn it”. So they burned the snake.

11:54.265 --> 12:01.025
But the female of the snake came out after 10 days.

12:01.185 --> 12:03.305
They said “there must be a female”,

12:03.505 --> 12:05.825
and she was searching for him

12:06.025 --> 12:08.665
when suddenly somebody saw her.

12:08.905 --> 12:12.945
They killed her also, they killed her

12:13.105 --> 12:16.625
and she also made the same kind of a pattern.

12:16.825 --> 12:18.145
I was amazed,

12:18.345 --> 12:20.065
very beautiful pattern

12:20.265 --> 12:24.025
of the body going round, like this, like this, like this.

12:24.505 --> 12:28.345
Exactly the same, she also made.

12:28.585 --> 12:30.425
So I was surprised

12:30.625 --> 12:35.145
how is it that this lady knows how

12:35.345 --> 12:37.465
to copy her husband?

12:37.665 --> 12:40.585
She did it, and when we burnt her,

12:40.785 --> 12:44.145
she was finished of course, both of them were killed.

12:44.545 --> 12:48.785
But what I felt is that animals,

12:49.345 --> 12:53.225
creepers, those who creep permanently,

12:53.425 --> 12:57.625
other people also, every type of animal,

12:57.905 --> 13:03.425
the whole of biology I studied, I was amazed

13:03.625 --> 13:09.425
that every type of animal has the exact,

13:09.625 --> 13:13.625
the same sample of behavior.

13:15.865 --> 13:19.145
For example, you can put the dog in the water

13:19.345 --> 13:22.825
he´ll swim, but the cat may not.

13:23.065 --> 13:28.065
See it´s a thing that is built in, the dharma,

13:28.265 --> 13:33.305
what I call the primordial taboos.

13:33.985 --> 13:38.265
We have in the same way, primordial taboos

13:38.465 --> 13:43.065
built within us, which are dharma.

13:44.105 --> 13:47.505
A human being has to be like that.

13:47.705 --> 13:50.465
If he tries to be something else

13:50.665 --> 13:53.425
something goes wrong with his life.

13:53.625 --> 13:57.225
It´s like say if you, you have a glass,

13:57.425 --> 14:01.625
you drop it on the ground, it will break, that is the dharma.

14:01.825 --> 14:05.185
In the same way when human beings

14:05.385 --> 14:09.225
start deviating from the line of dharma,

14:09.425 --> 14:11.625
they get into trouble.

14:11.825 --> 14:15.345
But it is only human beings who can do that.

14:15.545 --> 14:20.105
They can only cross over these taboos, these primordial taboos,

14:20.305 --> 14:23.785
and can become horrible.

14:24.025 --> 14:26.185
You see a person,

14:26.385 --> 14:30.265
sometimes I wonder what´s wrong with him.

14:31.345 --> 14:36.105
He has a nice home, very good wife, everything,

14:36.305 --> 14:41.585
then he has a keep (another woman), what is the need?

14:41.785 --> 14:44.745
For a man it is primordial that he should have

14:44.945 --> 14:50.545
only one wife, and she, one husband.

14:51.265 --> 14:55.385
It´s a taboo, as soon as you deviate from that

14:55.585 --> 14:58.185
something goes wrong.

14:58.905 --> 15:03.105
Now who punishes, or who corrects or who destroys

15:03.305 --> 15:09.985
is this primordial power which we call as Paramchaitanya.

15:13.465 --> 15:19.065
If you can understand that it´s a structure.

15:19.265 --> 15:24.385
Say this is the structure of this hangar,

15:24.585 --> 15:28.385
now you want to break it, you can break it

15:28.585 --> 15:31.185
because you are human beings,

15:31.385 --> 15:33.705
but it will be broken.

15:33.905 --> 15:35.585
As simple as that,

15:35.785 --> 15:39.265
we have to understand we are human beings

15:39.465 --> 15:41.665
and we cannot do things

15:41.865 --> 15:46.185
which go against our dharma.

15:46.385 --> 15:49.025
Now why the dharma?

15:49.225 --> 15:54.105
Dharma has to be there for our ascent.

15:55.505 --> 16:00.825
Now man, in his intelligence and his progressiveness

16:01.025 --> 16:05.665
thinks that anything he does – what´s wrong?

16:05.945 --> 16:09.305
Especially in the west, this is very common.

16:09.505 --> 16:12.945
But I must say, for the aboriginal people,

16:13.145 --> 16:15.505
or people who are,

16:15.705 --> 16:19.105
I mean I don´t know if I should call Indians aboriginal or not.

16:19.305 --> 16:23.265
But those people who were made aware

16:23.465 --> 16:27.985
of their primordial taboos somehow.

16:28.825 --> 16:33.345
As the animals know what is bad for them

16:34.145 --> 16:42.385
and that knowledge was there with aboriginals.

16:42.585 --> 16:47.385
Today we are here with Australians,

16:47.585 --> 16:52.945
and in Australia aboriginals are so many

16:53.145 --> 16:58.265
I was surprised, most of their words were Sanskrit.

16:58.465 --> 17:04.385
So might be they might have got it from India,

17:04.585 --> 17:07.945
or maybe they have gone there from India.

17:08.145 --> 17:12.825
So many words they have got which are Sanskrit.

17:13.385 --> 17:18.585
So I started thinking about them.

17:18.905 --> 17:23.105
Normally aboriginals, say in India we have aboriginals.

17:23.305 --> 17:28.625
We call them “gorn, korku, peel”.

17:29.305 --> 17:33.625
We had a lady who was a maid with us,

17:33.825 --> 17:36.185
Gaynabai was her name,

17:36.385 --> 17:38.305
she was an excellent cook,

17:38.505 --> 17:42.465
but she had her maryadas.

17:43.025 --> 17:46.065
All the time, like if my father came

17:46.265 --> 17:48.625
she would immediately cover her head

17:48.825 --> 17:51.985
and go in the other room, to respect him.

17:52.185 --> 17:55.625
Nobody told her to do that.

17:59.265 --> 18:04.705
Their marriage system was also very surprisingly good,

18:04.985 --> 18:08.185
and their relationships with the children also was very good.

18:08.385 --> 18:12.825
Somehow or another in my childhood I met many of them

18:13.025 --> 18:16.145
because I also had a habit of going to the jungles

18:16.345 --> 18:18.305
where I used to meet them

18:18.505 --> 18:21.385
and I was surprised, they would not drink

18:21.585 --> 18:27.265
this I´m telling you was about 60 years back, maybe more.

18:27.585 --> 18:29.265
They would not drink,

18:29.505 --> 18:34.985
very “lajashi” means shame of everything.

18:35.185 --> 18:40.625
A matter of, sort of prestige, for them was important.

18:40.825 --> 18:43.905
They would never steal anything,

18:44.105 --> 18:46.825
and I was really very impressed,

18:47.065 --> 18:49.945
how these people were so dharmic,

18:50.145 --> 18:52.385
so good and happy.

18:52.585 --> 18:55.385
They lived in huts, they didn´t mind,

18:55.585 --> 18:59.785
but they were very clean and neat people.

19:02.065 --> 19:05.745
It is now changed.

19:06.105 --> 19:10.065
The same people have changed so much.

19:18.345 --> 19:22.985
I mean they were like sacred people, I tell you, holy people.

19:25.065 --> 19:26.985
They worship Mother,

19:27.185 --> 19:31.305
they worship Mother Earth, nothing else,

19:31.665 --> 19:35.305
and I asked this lady “why do you worship Mother Earth?”.

19:35.505 --> 19:37.905
She said “she gives us everything.

19:38.105 --> 19:40.305
She is a just Mother,

19:40.505 --> 19:43.905
we live in the jungles, she looks after us,

19:44.105 --> 19:49.145
and she is the most conscious person,

19:49.345 --> 19:53.865
she knows that we are there and she has to look after us”.

19:55.545 --> 20:02.345
Even to take out some leaves from the trees,

20:02.545 --> 20:06.305
they used to think about it.

20:06.505 --> 20:09.185
But then the missionaries came,

20:09.385 --> 20:11.705
they converted them,

20:11.905 --> 20:13.625
they gave them skirts and blouses

20:13.825 --> 20:15.985
and I don´t know what all they did.

20:16.185 --> 20:17.785
But Gaynabai did not take,

20:17.985 --> 20:19.865
she said “what is this?”

20:20.065 --> 20:22.225
Why should I wear a dress like this

20:22.425 --> 20:24.745
where the whole body is exposed?

20:24.945 --> 20:28.505
No I´ll wear a sari, I can never give it up.

20:28.705 --> 20:32.465
Why should I wear this kind of a useless dress?”

20:32.665 --> 20:39.585
But when they met with these so called advanced people

20:39.785 --> 20:44.265
so many of them started living like that.

20:46.065 --> 20:47.985
They said “you have no freedom;

20:48.185 --> 20:51.745
you are just bound by something, by someone”.

20:51.945 --> 20:56.905
But actually they were bound by the sacredness,

20:57.105 --> 21:01.265
by the divine understanding

21:01.465 --> 21:05.025
and then they started changing.

21:05.225 --> 21:08.065
She was alright, her husband was alright

21:08.265 --> 21:10.505
but her son started drinking,

21:10.705 --> 21:12.585
this is the beginning of the end,

21:12.785 --> 21:17.825
then gambling and all other sorts of things he started.

21:18.025 --> 21:23.825
Then her grandson started going to prostitutes,

21:25.065 --> 21:29.185
and the idea was only that “we are free,

21:29.385 --> 21:31.825
what´s wrong?”

21:34.825 --> 21:37.185
Now these primordial taboos

21:37.385 --> 21:42.105
are in you, built in. They are there.

21:43.345 --> 21:49.185
These are existing maybe in a potential state,

21:49.385 --> 21:51.145
maybe you have curbed them down,

21:51.345 --> 21:55.025
maybe you have turned them out,

21:55.705 --> 21:58.025
but they are there.

21:58.225 --> 22:01.345
All the time they are there,

22:02.065 --> 22:07.025
and that´s what we say that you are leaving the maryadas,

22:07.225 --> 22:12.265
or else we say that you are insulting Shri Ganesh.

22:12.465 --> 22:17.705
So when Mother created this universe,

22:17.905 --> 22:23.145
first deity was Shri Ganesh.

22:24.745 --> 22:27.985
Auspiciousness was created.

22:28.185 --> 22:32.185
Now, we don´t understand what is auspiciousness.

22:32.425 --> 22:39.865
Auspiciousness is a complete understanding

22:40.065 --> 22:52.065
of primordial restrictions, and also of the protocol.

22:54.305 --> 22:58.345
For example, in India we all used to do that,

22:58.545 --> 23:02.065
though I was in a Christian family,

23:02.265 --> 23:04.625
that before touching the Mother Earth,

23:04.825 --> 23:06.905
getting up from the bed,

23:07.105 --> 23:10.185
we used to say “Oh Mother Earth, please forgive us

23:10.385 --> 23:14.505
because we are touching you with our feet”.

23:17.025 --> 23:21.305
So respect for the Mother Earth and for nature

23:21.505 --> 23:23.145
is built in within us,

23:23.345 --> 23:27.905
it´s part and parcel, we are part and parcel of this whole

23:28.105 --> 23:32.825
we can call it whole universe.

23:33.265 --> 23:40.265
But when you get into this nonsensical idea of freedom

23:40.625 --> 23:45.385
then you are leaving your Mother Earth,

23:45.865 --> 23:49.945
your gravity itself reduces.

23:51.825 --> 23:56.465
This Mother Earth has to teach us,

23:57.305 --> 23:59.585
while we are plundering everything,

23:59.785 --> 24:02.745
the ecology, their ecology – ecology people are trying.

24:02.945 --> 24:06.865
Whatever is outside is also inside.

24:07.065 --> 24:12.345
If you want to exploit your Mother inside,

24:12.545 --> 24:16.745
or if you want to trouble your Mother inside,

24:16.945 --> 24:21.225
you can also trouble this Mother Earth.

24:22.265 --> 24:30.345
Now what has replaced our understanding is very simple,

24:30.545 --> 24:42.105
is that we are paying more attention to money.

24:44.025 --> 24:48.465
If you can cut a tree you say, to get money,

24:48.945 --> 24:52.225
then it is hurting the Mother.

24:52.425 --> 24:56.105
But if you are cutting the tree for beautifying her,

24:56.305 --> 24:58.305
then she´s happy.

24:58.505 --> 25:01.785
Her discretion is so great,

25:01.985 --> 25:06.145
see the way she produces flowers.

25:06.345 --> 25:08.945
Different, different types of flowers.

25:09.145 --> 25:13.385
In different countries, different types of flowers.

25:13.665 --> 25:16.025
Like I saw in my country

25:16.225 --> 25:19.785
that flowers are extremely fragrant,

25:20.265 --> 25:22.705
very fragrant.

25:22.905 --> 25:29.945
And she understands so much.

25:30.145 --> 25:33.465
Once I went to Australia

25:33.825 --> 25:37.465
and this flower you call hibiscus,

25:39.345 --> 25:43.225
it´s a red flower, it becomes pink and then red,

25:43.425 --> 25:46.265
imagine it becomes first pink

25:46.465 --> 25:49.185
and then gradually it becomes red.

25:49.385 --> 25:54.265
Even the sunflower goes on turning its face with the sun.

25:54.465 --> 25:57.065
Now how can you say there is no connection

25:57.265 --> 26:01.265
between a sunflower and the sun?

26:01.945 --> 26:05.385
Automatically it goes on changing.

26:06.025 --> 26:10.785
So these hibiscus flowers are the flowers

26:10.985 --> 26:14.905
which we use to worship Shri Ganesh,

26:15.105 --> 26:19.265
and the program was to worship Shri Ganesh.

26:19.465 --> 26:25.825
On the way I saw so many trees of hibiscus, just flowering.

26:26.385 --> 26:29.625
I said “at this time so many flowers”.

26:29.825 --> 26:34.465
I said “I think you´d better get these flowers for the puja”.

26:34.665 --> 26:40.785
I went and when I arrived in the hall

26:40.985 --> 26:46.225
all the Sahaja Yogis had got hibiscus on their own.

26:46.905 --> 26:49.345
I never talked to them, just on their own.

26:49.545 --> 26:52.625
They didn´t know that it is to be used for Shri Ganesh

26:52.825 --> 26:57.465
but the Mother Earth herself created at that time.

26:58.545 --> 27:03.745
This is the time of Shri Ganesh when you should get hibiscus.

27:05.185 --> 27:07.425
It´s very remarkable

27:07.625 --> 27:11.665
how the nature is so much within us

27:11.825 --> 27:15.345
and how this, whatever it is within us,

27:15.545 --> 27:21.105
guides outside and receives the blessings.

27:21.265 --> 27:24.025
We are not something separate.

27:24.225 --> 27:27.465
This Mother Earth is our home,

27:27.665 --> 27:33.585
we have a home in her and she has a home within us.

27:34.545 --> 27:37.945
I said today that for Shri Ganesha,

27:38.145 --> 27:40.665
He had a body of the clay,

27:40.825 --> 27:43.025
just ordinary clay.

27:43.985 --> 27:45.785
So you can imagine,

27:45.985 --> 27:48.065
if you can really think of it,

27:48.265 --> 27:54.265
how this whole universe has created us;

27:56.265 --> 27:59.225
all of it is within us

27:59.425 --> 28:03.225
and when we try to hurt something,

28:04.905 --> 28:09.305
then we are hurting ourselves.

28:11.505 --> 28:15.465
The intelligence of Mother Earth

28:15.665 --> 28:18.985
I have seen from my childhood.

28:20.425 --> 28:25.665
It´s such a beautiful thing to know the nature

28:25.865 --> 28:27.185
and the Mother Earth

28:27.385 --> 28:30.705
that´s why all the saints, in India especially,

28:30.905 --> 28:34.265
used to go and live in the forest.

28:34.465 --> 28:38.545
Only in the forest you could see clearly

28:38.745 --> 28:47.785
how this primordial bondage was absolutely obeyed,

28:47.985 --> 28:52.585
absolutely obeyed, naturally by the nature.

28:53.425 --> 28:56.145
For us it is difficult,

28:56.345 --> 29:01.865
we are rather, “free” people.

29:03.985 --> 29:10.705
So simple things, simple things like a woman

29:11.385 --> 29:16.545
should be always covered properly in her body.

29:16.745 --> 29:19.145
Because she respects her body,

29:19.345 --> 29:21.825
she respects her chastity.

29:22.025 --> 29:24.585
But if you tell this to somebody

29:24.785 --> 29:26.825
they won´t listen.

29:27.025 --> 29:31.785
As you see the evergreens, they are always clad,

29:33.105 --> 29:35.425
no leaf falls off.

29:35.625 --> 29:39.465
I call them as the females,

29:39.665 --> 29:42.825
and the other trees, deciduous,

29:43.025 --> 29:48.865
they do lose their leaves so I call them as men.

29:49.065 --> 29:51.905
Because they are men.

29:52.105 --> 29:54.505
Here it´s the other way round, I have seen.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.385
If I used to go to any party

29:56.585 --> 30:00.065
somehow or another they thought I was a very serene person,

30:00.265 --> 30:01.905
you meet someone, immediately

30:02.105 --> 30:04.985
the man will button up himself

30:05.185 --> 30:07.985
and the women will open themselves.

30:08.185 --> 30:12.025
I said the whole brain from here has gone to this side

30:12.225 --> 30:14.825
and this one has gone this side.

30:15.025 --> 30:17.705
It´s so stupid.

30:17.905 --> 30:21.305
But even Mrs. Thatcher they said that she said,

30:21.505 --> 30:27.265
that it is our culture that women must expose their bodies.

30:27.465 --> 30:31.705
For what? Are they prostitutes or what?

30:35.225 --> 30:38.705
So this craze of exposure of the body

30:38.905 --> 30:43.545
has become so strong now that even in India,

30:43.745 --> 30:46.385
it´s not on the streets or in the household,

30:46.585 --> 30:49.265
but in the cinema, in films, you see women,

30:49.465 --> 30:52.185
really this never happens in India.

30:52.385 --> 30:54.825
What you see in the films, never happens!

30:55.025 --> 30:56.945
If they start wearing dresses like that

30:57.145 --> 31:00.985
so many people will throw stones at them.

31:03.225 --> 31:07.265
Then all other sorts of,

31:07.745 --> 31:12.545
I shouldn´t say clumpsy but very grotesque

31:12.745 --> 31:18.185
things happened, like, I can´t understand

31:18.385 --> 31:23.545
man having relation with man, woman having relation with woman,

31:23.745 --> 31:27.705
and children, and this and that and that.

31:29.145 --> 31:32.825
We didn´t know these things in India, I didn´t know.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.825
Why? Why has it happened here?

31:36.025 --> 31:39.425
I don´t think 50 years back they used to do that,

31:39.625 --> 31:42.305
also in these countries.

31:42.505 --> 31:46.985
Why have we given up our sense of shame?

31:47.185 --> 31:51.025
And this kind of nonsense that has come into us.

31:51.185 --> 31:55.505
I think must be some bhoots in them or badhas in them

31:55.705 --> 31:57.185
or something horrible,

31:57.385 --> 32:01.185
but this is something absolutely unnatural.

32:01.385 --> 32:04.265
Absurd!

32:05.905 --> 32:10.785
Then a married man having eyes on unmarried women

32:10.985 --> 32:17.465
and unmarried men are having relations.

32:17.665 --> 32:21.105
All kinds of things people do.

32:21.305 --> 32:25.785
And you won´t believe, this doesn´t happen in India.

32:25.985 --> 32:31.185
Really I tell you, these days it sort of spread out,

32:31.385 --> 32:36.665
but I would say in good families you don´t have it.

32:36.825 --> 32:39.345
Somebody told me there is AIDS in India,

32:39.545 --> 32:42.905
yes because they take bath in the river.

32:43.105 --> 32:47.705
If they stopped taking bath in the river this will stop.

32:47.905 --> 32:50.825
I was a medical student, I have studied,

32:51.025 --> 32:53.425
I came from a very open family,

32:53.625 --> 32:55.585
I never knew these things,

32:55.785 --> 32:59.945
that men can do such things, it´s stupid!

33:01.785 --> 33:04.465
Even in the lunatic asylum in India

33:04.665 --> 33:07.305
we have never heard of such reports.

33:07.505 --> 33:10.785
This is absurd!!

33:17.625 --> 33:20.305
You see the children.

33:20.505 --> 33:23.625
The other day Guido gave me a present of a girl,

33:23.825 --> 33:25.385
who was feeling shy,

33:25.585 --> 33:29.385
you know, the little girl was holding her frock like this and feeling shy.

33:29.865 --> 33:37.425
Shyness is the ornament of women.

33:37.865 --> 33:40.945
Children are all shy.

33:41.345 --> 33:43.425
I remember my granddaughter

33:43.625 --> 33:47.825
she was once watching one magazine,

33:48.065 --> 33:51.305
she was very small, two years or so.

33:51.505 --> 33:55.985
So she saw one woman in a bikini or something,

33:56.185 --> 33:58.305
she was hitting her, “what are you doing?”

33:58.505 --> 33:59.825
She saw in the magazine.

34:00.065 --> 34:02.625
My grandmother will come

34:02.825 --> 34:05.145
and give you two slaps, you shut up!

34:05.345 --> 34:07.185
Please wear your dresses”.

34:07.385 --> 34:11.785
They would not. Children don´t like, have you noticed it.

34:11.985 --> 34:14.785
I don´t know if they are advanced,

34:14.985 --> 34:19.945
but normally children don´t like it, this shamelessness.

34:20.265 --> 34:23.105
But the shamelessness has gone,

34:23.305 --> 34:25.745
to such an extent

34:25.945 --> 34:31.625
that to them keeping nude is a very great advancement.

34:36.225 --> 34:40.985
This is nothing.

34:42.265 --> 34:46.585
Somebody told me that he wanted to save the aboriginals

34:46.785 --> 34:49.305
but they were so much,

34:49.505 --> 34:55.265
so much impressed by the white skin,

34:55.465 --> 34:57.665
that they accepted everything.

34:57.865 --> 34:59.985
But they were even having relations

35:00.185 --> 35:04.025
with their own sister, daughter, mother.

35:04.665 --> 35:07.025
Competition.

35:09.265 --> 35:11.745
These are the subjects,

35:11.945 --> 35:14.785
it´s rather heinous to talk about,

35:14.985 --> 35:18.545
and I can´t understand

35:18.745 --> 35:23.305
how can a human being go to that level.

35:24.025 --> 35:30.065
And at this time we have Sahaja Yoga,

35:32.705 --> 35:36.185
where you have become aware, aware

35:36.385 --> 35:40.465
of your natural taboos.

35:40.665 --> 35:43.665
It is there, because I told you, potentially it is there,

35:43.825 --> 35:48.145
it is enlightened and suddenly you have accepted.

35:48.585 --> 35:51.465
I never expected so much, I tell you,

35:51.665 --> 35:55.225
but you have accepted it,

35:55.985 --> 35:58.865
and not only that, but you are enjoying it,

35:59.065 --> 36:01.745
your practicing it.

36:03.425 --> 36:07.665
You see the lives of all the great saints.

36:10.425 --> 36:14.345
You can´t have something, like Diana,

36:14.545 --> 36:16.465
see, they are going to call her a saint.

36:16.665 --> 36:19.505
She had no maryadas.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.905
Oh I have sympathies with her because

36:22.105 --> 36:24.705
her husband tortured her or maybe something,

36:24.905 --> 36:29.065
but maryadas are very important.

36:29.665 --> 36:32.385
How can she be a saint?

36:32.585 --> 36:38.025
Now if you become just an ordinary human being

36:38.225 --> 36:43.585
who has his taboos, who understands, who is aware,

36:44.465 --> 36:47.785
then they will say, “Oh what a man he was”,

36:47.985 --> 36:51.025
I mean that´s what he was,

36:51.225 --> 36:53.185
he was born like that,

36:53.385 --> 36:57.705
so such a man is praised, in the West especially.

36:57.905 --> 37:01.065
Also the other way round is that,

37:01.265 --> 37:05.065
now the majority is the law.

37:05.265 --> 37:08.145
If the majority is stupid,

37:08.345 --> 37:13.745
then all the stupidity is regarded as great.

37:14.465 --> 37:19.545
They have no brains they have no intelligence

37:19.745 --> 37:23.225
to understand how can these things help;

37:23.425 --> 37:26.185
alcohol for example.

37:26.385 --> 37:31.905
I mean alcohol, it has done no good to anyone,

37:32.705 --> 37:38.745
but alcohol, without alcohol you are no good.

37:38.945 --> 37:40.505
They won´t talk to you they say that

37:40.705 --> 37:44.585
unless you have alcohol you cannot talk.

37:47.185 --> 37:49.105
And it is so rampant,

37:49.305 --> 37:53.145
it is so much in the society

37:53.345 --> 37:55.745
that all the parties I attended,

37:55.945 --> 37:59.745
except for me and my husband, everybody was drinking,

37:59.945 --> 38:05.265
and drinking much more than normal because it was free.

38:06.705 --> 38:08.905
They are all poisons,

38:09.105 --> 38:11.585
these are all poisons

38:11.745 --> 38:18.185
spoiling us completely from one to another.

38:18.385 --> 38:25.505
This one is a taboo now, for cigarettes,

38:25.705 --> 38:29.545
imagine – why to smoke?

38:29.745 --> 38:33.985
I don´t understand, like a chimney people are smoking.

38:34.185 --> 38:38.825
But they have no courage to give it up now.

38:39.025 --> 38:42.065
Everywhere, no smoke, no smoke, no smoke.

38:42.265 --> 38:48.585
When will they start “no alcohol?”

38:50.465 --> 38:55.785
Everybody sees that it´s so dangerous.

38:55.985 --> 38:59.505
It is against human awareness, everybody sees it.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.305
You see people falling down,

39:01.505 --> 39:05.985
you see people cursing each other, fighting.

39:06.185 --> 39:09.705
I tell you, if you stop this alcoholism

39:09.905 --> 39:14.025
all this shamelessness will go away.

39:14.705 --> 39:18.785
Because when you take alcohol your awareness is abated.

39:18.985 --> 39:20.625
One alcoholic told me

39:20.825 --> 39:26.185
“when I take alcohol I don´t see my sister as my sister,

39:26.385 --> 39:30.025
but see her as my beloved”.

39:30.225 --> 39:34.065
Well how do you do that? “Yes”.

39:34.385 --> 39:40.625
But for all social status and all that you must drink.

39:41.265 --> 39:43.785
Now, we don´t even understand how

39:43.985 --> 39:50.545
our primordial taboos are completely battered

39:50.745 --> 39:54.385
by the society here.

39:56.225 --> 40:01.985
The simple thing is that

40:09.585 --> 40:16.825
to understand your own self,

40:17.025 --> 40:21.145
better sometimes to see the stupid people,

40:21.345 --> 40:25.505
you´ll be amazed what sort of things they are doing

40:25.665 --> 40:28.905
because I have seen, I used to be very amazed

40:29.105 --> 40:31.585
what are they doing?

40:31.785 --> 40:36.225
And then to cover it up, to cover it up,

40:37.505 --> 40:42.865
they have etiquettes you know, very elite.

40:43.065 --> 40:46.225
They talk in a very special manner,

40:46.425 --> 40:50.545
move themselves in a very,

40:52.625 --> 40:57.905
I should say, like a trained personality

40:58.105 --> 41:05.905
and anybody who doesn´t do that is out of their sight.

41:06.545 --> 41:11.545
They think that He lacks eliteness.

41:13.105 --> 41:19.665
So another idea is that we have to be elite.

41:22.305 --> 41:25.625
Ganesha is how made – you see that.

41:27.625 --> 41:32.905
Look at him, He´s by no means elite.

41:33.585 --> 41:38.305
He eats like a glutton

41:43.225 --> 41:48.385
and He looks at you

41:48.585 --> 41:55.825
as if He´s going to hit you with his mace.

41:59.625 --> 42:06.905
For Ganesha there is no forgiveness,

42:07.105 --> 42:13.465
when he became Christ there He developed,

42:13.985 --> 42:17.585
I don´t know how it worked out,

42:17.785 --> 42:27.625
but as Ganesha there is not at all forgiveness.

42:28.785 --> 42:31.945
Don´t try to ask forgiveness from Shri Ganesha,

42:32.145 --> 42:34.905
He´ll never forgive,

42:35.105 --> 42:37.705
even if his mother says “now you´d better forgive”,

42:37.905 --> 42:41.105
“No, that I´ll not do”.

42:43.265 --> 42:45.425
He never forgives!!

42:45.625 --> 42:49.465
Then only it comes to the point that the Mother has to say

42:49.665 --> 42:52.585
“I forgive you”, then He can do it,

42:52.785 --> 42:54.505
because one thing about Him is,

42:54.705 --> 42:58.905
He´s extremely obedient to his Mother, absolutely,

42:59.105 --> 43:01.265
so if the Mother has forgiven, finished.

43:01.465 --> 43:06.065
But otherwise, he will never, never forgive,

43:06.265 --> 43:13.785
and that´s why all kinds of these horrible diseases are here.

43:15.705 --> 43:17.785
Thousands of them.

43:17.985 --> 43:24.825
Also if you don´t respect Him then impotency can come

43:25.025 --> 43:32.265
or AIDS and all these secret diseases that people have.

43:34.385 --> 43:40.505
I had a very bad time with people who suffered

43:40.705 --> 43:43.305
from these secret diseases,

43:43.505 --> 43:49.785
because Shri Ganesha accepts my forgiveness

43:50.065 --> 43:54.065
but whenever he has a chance, again He comes back!

43:54.265 --> 44:00.505
Now see, they are deities with their own dharma.

44:00.985 --> 44:04.425
They too have their own dharma.

44:04.825 --> 44:07.825
He gives you a lot of things, he gives you

44:08.065 --> 44:12.185
mainly wisdom, discretion, understanding,

44:12.385 --> 44:16.825
but if you don´t obey Him, his qualities,

44:17.025 --> 44:21.385
then he´s a very difficult man.

44:23.545 --> 44:26.745
So to tell somebody “Don´t do it” is very difficult,

44:26.945 --> 44:30.465
but the nature takes respite.

44:33.985 --> 44:40.505
If you want to become patient it´s not difficult;

44:41.105 --> 44:44.785
but to get you cured on the Mooladhara

44:44.985 --> 44:48.185
is very, very difficult.

44:48.425 --> 44:53.105
You do get cured no doubt, ultimately,

44:53.305 --> 45:00.225
but the most difficult disease is from Mooladhara.

45:00.705 --> 45:04.585
He´s a child, alright,

45:05.305 --> 45:10.865
He´s an eternal child, He´s innocence,

45:11.505 --> 45:17.585
despite all that He cannot forgive you

45:17.785 --> 45:21.905
if you disturb your innocence.

45:23.545 --> 45:26.185
Mother is just the opposite,

45:26.385 --> 45:30.265
she wants to save at any cost, she wants to save people.

45:31.185 --> 45:33.945
But not Ganesha,

45:34.145 --> 45:38.025
Ganesha says “alright,

45:40.825 --> 45:44.545
you better go to hell”

45:44.745 --> 45:47.705
and hell is in our own lives here, you see,

45:47.905 --> 45:50.945
those people who like drinking, smoking,

45:51.145 --> 45:54.025
prostitution all this – this is all hell.

45:54.225 --> 45:57.305
What else is hell?

45:57.665 --> 46:04.945
And he will never save you from hell.

46:11.745 --> 46:17.185
Only in your Aarti, in Marathi, of Shri Ganesha,

46:17.385 --> 46:20.225
they say that at the time

46:20.425 --> 46:24.665
when I am getting my realization

46:24.865 --> 46:28.945
you must save me.

46:29.145 --> 46:32.465
That´s the only thing they ask,

46:32.665 --> 46:38.865
at the time of my resurrection you must save me.

46:39.065 --> 46:41.185
It does not say that

46:41.385 --> 46:45.385
at the time of my resurrection you protect me, no!

46:45.585 --> 46:48.225
You save me.

46:49.585 --> 46:55.945
Because he´s the one who is sitting on every chakra

46:56.145 --> 47:00.745
like a vice-chancellor of the university.

47:02.225 --> 47:05.585
Even if you have Vishnu on your side,

47:05.785 --> 47:08.305
Mahadeva on your side,

47:08.505 --> 47:12.305
but if Shri Ganesha is there sitting

47:12.505 --> 47:17.065
and He says “no, not his ascent”,

47:17.265 --> 47:22.585
it doesn´t work out, it´s very difficult.

47:23.025 --> 47:28.185
So now I am telling you this that your children are here.

47:28.385 --> 47:30.425
In these modern times

47:30.625 --> 47:34.425
horrible things are happening to children.

47:34.625 --> 47:40.425
I mean, I think the whole of this negativity is against the innocence.

47:40.625 --> 47:44.025
Wherever they get the children they misuse them,

47:44.225 --> 47:46.185
they teach them bad things.

47:46.385 --> 47:51.185
Even the schools everything is so horrid.

47:52.025 --> 47:54.545
So then we have to be careful.

47:54.745 --> 47:59.785
We have to be very very careful about our children.

47:59.985 --> 48:02.625
We have to guide them properly, look after them,

48:02.825 --> 48:09.225
and let their primordial taboos should be that,

48:09.425 --> 48:20.265
that restriction, that taboo, that is to be preserved.

48:20.625 --> 48:25.745
So if a child does something nice, appreciate it.

48:25.945 --> 48:28.265
I´m not worried about a child

48:28.465 --> 48:30.865
being little bit, what you can call,

48:31.065 --> 48:36.745
being a little bit mischievous, here they have to be.

48:36.945 --> 48:38.345
It´s alright.

48:38.545 --> 48:46.505
But if he takes to anything that is anti Ganesha, be careful!

48:48.065 --> 48:52.305
All kinds of diseases can develop,

48:52.785 --> 48:57.665
and if they are destroyed in childhood, these taboos,

48:57.825 --> 49:00.825
then they are very difficult to revive.

49:01.065 --> 49:05.225
Still I have always said that innocence is never lost,

49:05.425 --> 49:08.745
only there are some clouds

49:08.945 --> 49:12.945
which try to cover innocence

49:13.145 --> 49:18.465
and we become rather ignorant about it,

49:19.025 --> 49:23.345
that we have done anything wrong.

49:24.065 --> 49:27.305
That is your duty.

49:28.105 --> 49:31.345
Your society is horrible.

49:31.545 --> 49:35.145
Next generation I don´t know where it is going to end up.

49:35.345 --> 49:39.105
When I think about it I really get a fright.

49:44.865 --> 49:48.025
The solution is that you have to be

49:48.185 --> 49:53.585
careful about your children and their thinking

49:53.785 --> 50:01.065
and their attitude towards Shri Ganesha.

50:01.305 --> 50:08.025
They are special lovable things for Shri Ganesha.

50:08.225 --> 50:12.505
You can´t imagine how he loves the children

50:12.705 --> 50:17.385
and he´s always there to protect your children,

50:17.585 --> 50:22.185
if he protects anything it is the children he protects,

50:22.425 --> 50:29.025
and if you people really understand what I am saying now,

50:29.185 --> 50:36.425
because if you have to cross this margin

50:36.585 --> 50:41.225
of human life and spiritual life,

50:41.425 --> 50:46.145
first thing is your Shri Ganesh!

50:48.705 --> 50:53.505
When Kundalini rises Shri Ganesh is quiet,

50:53.705 --> 50:58.225
he just supports the Kundalini to rise.

50:59.985 --> 51:04.305
He´s the one who also suggests to you

51:04.505 --> 51:08.705
that it´s the wrong way you are doing things.

51:11.265 --> 51:17.385
He looks after you, but he´ll not forgive you.

51:17.585 --> 51:21.985
It is not so difficult.

51:22.785 --> 51:24.585
The way people talk

51:24.825 --> 51:28.425
about their physical needs and all this nonsense,

51:28.625 --> 51:32.905
even the animals don't talk like that.

51:33.105 --> 51:39.145
Try to enjoy things which will give you real enjoyment.

51:39.345 --> 51:45.505
For example flowers, nature, garden.

51:45.705 --> 51:49.345
Instead of destroying this nature, try to build it up,

51:49.545 --> 51:54.705
try to see how you can make it a beautiful garden,

51:54.905 --> 51:59.745
or a beautiful place.

51:59.945 --> 52:02.465
Every time I am here

52:02.665 --> 52:06.825
I am thinking what should I do with this land here

52:07.025 --> 52:12.025
which is very barren, how can I change it.

52:12.225 --> 52:15.385
All the time there is thought

52:15.585 --> 52:21.625
about how to make it beautiful,

52:24.825 --> 52:28.585
and in that, if there is innocence,

52:28.825 --> 52:30.625
no greed,

52:30.825 --> 52:34.385
there is no competition,

52:34.585 --> 52:36.465
there is no attachment,

52:36.665 --> 52:39.625
but just to enjoy the beauty

52:39.825 --> 52:45.385
of your own creation, to see how things are.

52:47.945 --> 52:50.985
Out of proportion people have gone,

52:51.185 --> 52:54.225
out of understanding.

52:54.425 --> 52:57.785
For example, here or anywhere else in Europe

52:57.985 --> 53:02.865
you are not supposed to grow anymore fruits.

53:03.065 --> 53:06.345
Why? Because the price must be kept low.

53:06.545 --> 53:08.305
If you have so many fruits

53:08.505 --> 53:14.825
why don´t you send it to places where they don´t have fruits?

53:15.265 --> 53:20.745
They will destroy it, finish it, but they will not do that.

53:21.745 --> 53:30.785
So the love and feeling for others is not there,

53:31.465 --> 53:37.425
and they destroy if something is overproduced by the Mother Earth

53:37.625 --> 53:41.225
just to keep the prices high.

53:41.425 --> 53:44.225
Very cruel!

53:44.425 --> 53:47.305
They are very cruel still.

53:47.505 --> 53:52.625
Only thinking about money, money, money, money.

53:52.865 --> 53:55.625
All this happens.

53:56.505 --> 54:01.625
So it´s still happening

54:01.825 --> 54:07.825
and I´m sure one day will come when it will all stop.

54:10.665 --> 54:18.345
The pubs are the best buildings in the village.

54:18.945 --> 54:26.105
Then the way they glorify drinking

54:26.305 --> 54:29.305
is the best part of it.

54:29.505 --> 54:34.345
It´s all done, you see it.

54:34.785 --> 54:38.625
Now only thing I would like you to have a desire

54:38.825 --> 54:44.265
that let drinking be finished, like smoking.

54:44.705 --> 54:50.625
If you think like that might solve a little bit.

54:50.825 --> 54:52.745
I personally think

54:52.945 --> 55:00.865
it is with drinking you develop all these perverted attitudes.

55:01.225 --> 55:06.705
Otherwise if it´s a normal man with a normal brain

55:06.905 --> 55:10.105
why should he do such things?

55:10.305 --> 55:14.985
Fighting, quarrelling, killing, violence.

55:16.465 --> 55:19.985
It´s impossible to understand

55:20.185 --> 55:24.745
how can a normal person do such a thing.

55:24.945 --> 55:27.985
Shri Ganesha gives you balance,

55:28.185 --> 55:32.585
he keeps you on the proper track.

55:32.785 --> 55:35.465
But if you don´t want to listen to him,

55:35.665 --> 55:38.465
you are thrown away.

55:44.985 --> 55:50.945
I hope you understand our relationship with nature,

55:51.145 --> 55:53.105
with Shri Ganesha

55:53.305 --> 56:00.065
and with our Kundalini is like,

56:00.265 --> 56:08.385
absolutely identified with each other, absolutely.

56:09.665 --> 56:12.105
If you start loving the nature

56:12.305 --> 56:18.425
all these ideas of spoiling your innocence will be finished.

56:20.345 --> 56:24.105
I used to write poetry, I´m very fond of nature,

56:24.305 --> 56:29.185
but then I told myself you have to do work for Sahaja Yoga.

56:29.385 --> 56:33.185
If you take to poetry they´ll all call you a poetess

56:33.385 --> 56:36.385
and I don´t want to have any such position

56:36.585 --> 56:39.545
to be a poetess and all that, I gave it up.

56:39.745 --> 56:42.105
And I was a very good sportswoman.

56:42.305 --> 56:47.065
I used to play things, I used to be first in every sort of game

56:47.265 --> 56:51.225
and I had championship, this and that. I gave it up.

56:51.425 --> 56:54.545
Whatever I did I used to get into it,

56:54.745 --> 56:56.385
I studied medicine

56:56.585 --> 57:01.065
I stood in the first at the whole university. I gave it up.

57:02.025 --> 57:09.065
Why? Because I´m the Primordial Mother,

57:09.265 --> 57:13.025
and I have to do the job

57:13.225 --> 57:17.985
of awakening the primordial nature,

57:18.185 --> 57:20.545
the dharma within human beings,

57:20.745 --> 57:24.105
and that´s what I have to do

57:25.105 --> 57:28.025
and nothing else.

57:28.225 --> 57:31.065
But for that I don´t do anything I am “Nishkriya”

57:31.265 --> 57:33.945
I don´t do anything, really I don´t do.

57:34.145 --> 57:36.145
It is done by the nature.

57:36.345 --> 57:37.905
Done by Shri Ganesha.

57:38.105 --> 57:41.785
Vishnu, Mahesha, everybody, they are doing it.

57:41.985 --> 57:48.785
But, then what is the relationship?

57:50.865 --> 57:56.345
The relationship is, they are all in my body

57:56.545 --> 58:00.545
and they are all bound by their own dharma,

58:00.745 --> 58:02.745
and they act.

58:02.945 --> 58:04.665
This is the relationship,

58:04.825 --> 58:09.625
spontaneous, automatic, like a built-in relationship.

58:09.825 --> 58:11.985
For example, the fan is built in

58:12.185 --> 58:15.905
so as soon as you push the button it starts moving.

58:16.105 --> 58:18.425
It´s like that.

58:18.625 --> 58:21.985
All of them are related to me,

58:22.185 --> 58:26.105
and they have a tremendous protocol,

58:26.305 --> 58:28.545
tremendous respect,

58:28.745 --> 58:36.545
that if I say anything they will not finish it.

58:36.745 --> 58:39.185
You see this thing is that

58:39.385 --> 58:45.705
very very deep thing that I am telling you,

58:45.905 --> 58:50.905
that you are a human being,

58:51.105 --> 58:53.505
that there is built in.

58:53.705 --> 58:57.785
Within you are your dharmas

58:57.985 --> 59:01.705
and if you go against your dharmas

59:01.905 --> 59:05.585
then you´ll be finished.

59:05.785 --> 59:09.225
They´re all built in within you,

59:09.425 --> 59:15.305
they are all there, potentially.

59:15.505 --> 59:21.465
I hope you´ll understand how important it is

59:21.665 --> 59:28.305
to be aware of your restrictions within yourself.

59:29.145 --> 59:31.945
So thank you very much all of you.

59:32.145 --> 59:34.865
May God bless you!!
