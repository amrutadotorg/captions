00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:42.909
Today we have gathered here to do
the Navaratri Puja.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.373
There were nine times when the major
incarnations

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:56.513
of the Mother of this universe

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:05.146
were manifested. They were manifested
with a purpose.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:15.335
That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas,
Her disciples, Her children.

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.537
This was

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:34.400
a binding love, She could not escape it.

00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:40.172
Mother's love is binding, She cannot
escape it

00:01:40.373 --> 00:01:46.498
and She has to manifest it, work it out

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:51.780
and give that protection to all
Her children.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.139
This protection in the modern times
has taken another form.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.546
In those days, the evil was trying

00:02:07.747 --> 00:02:13.894
to harm, to destroy the people who were
righteous,

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:17.923
who were bhaktas, who were doing
good things,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.801
who wanted to lead a very religious life.

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:29.495
So to save them, She incarnated.
To protect them, She incarnated.

00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:34.247
But they knew what was good, they knew
what was wrong.

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:40.886
And they wanted to preserve their good
life, their precious life.

00:02:41.087 --> 00:02:44.810
They didn't care for money, they didn't
care for power,

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:48.752
but just they wanted their life,

00:02:48.953 --> 00:02:54.008
means they wanted to be alive to worship
the Goddess.

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.557
And when they were troubled or harmed
or destroyed

00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:02.258
by these evil forces, She had to manifest.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.478
But in modern times it's become
very complicated

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.225
as the modern times are complicated.

00:03:10.426 --> 00:03:13.172
First of all,

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:19.887
in the mind, in the lifestyle,
in the society

00:03:20.088 --> 00:03:26.457
of good human beings, righteous human
beings,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.639
fear of the wrong has entered.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.546
Like they are afraid say of their priests,
of their churches,

00:03:37.747 --> 00:03:42.200
of their temples, of their mosques,
which are all false.

00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:46.413
They are not afraid of God, they don't
believe in God.

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:51.749
They think they have created God and they
can manage God. So who is God?

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.888
The way they behave you can see clearly
that they do not recognize

00:03:56.089 --> 00:04:01.636
the existence of God, God Almighty who is
a wrathful God.

00:04:01.837 --> 00:04:05.597
They are not at all worried as to what
will happen to them.

00:04:05.798 --> 00:04:10.594
They don't even believe in the second life,
they don't believe in the resurrection.

00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:17.411
They are very short-sighted, evil people
doing all kinds of evil things.

00:04:17.612 --> 00:04:22.034
So somehow or other, as soon as you
are born,

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:25.761
you are born into some sort of a brand,

00:04:25.962 --> 00:04:31.496
you are this, you are that, you are that,
you are that, as soon as you are born.

00:04:31.697 --> 00:04:34.323
So the first brand comes onto this
modern man,

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:39.076
is of what religion to which he belongs.

00:04:39.474 --> 00:04:45.334
He can't avoid it, he has to be jolly well
belonging to some religion.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:49.080
You go anywhere, even in the passport -
nowadays they have stopped it -

00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:53.941
otherwise they used to ask: "What is
your religion?"

00:04:55.071 --> 00:05:00.353
And in India if you said you had no
religion they would not give you a passport

00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:04.134
because you are not yet qualified
evil person,

00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:08.695
or you are not following qualified
evil people.

00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:17.345
So that very simple gullible good people,
very righteous believers of God,

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:24.432
developed this kind of a fear which was put
into their heads by these false people.

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:27.292
That if you don't do like this, if you
don't pay money to us,

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:29.931
then God will be wrathful.

00:05:30.132 --> 00:05:38.940
If you do not come to the confession,
then God will be angry with you,

00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:43.272
if you do not tolerate our nonsense,
God will be angry with you.

00:05:43.473 --> 00:05:50.058
All these things started going into
the brains of the people very easily.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.863
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in drinking.

00:05:55.064 --> 00:06:00.076
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in marrying many women.

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:04.525
In some religion they believe that you
can have caste system.

00:06:04.726 --> 00:06:12.981
All is anti-God, absolutely anti-God
activity perpetuated into the society

00:06:13.182 --> 00:06:19.303
by these priests who are supposed to be
in charge of the religion.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:26.427
So the first horrible conditioning we have
when we start Sahaja Yoga is this.

00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:33.369
So to start something afresh they find it
very difficult.

00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:42.496
So the first protection Mother had
to render is from this conditioning.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.645
The second one is that of the country.

00:06:46.846 --> 00:06:50.555
Either you belong to this country,
to that country, or to that country.

00:06:50.756 --> 00:07:00.964
And these days every country is competing
with each other in all kinds of

00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:09.135
corruption, mafia, all kinds of things,
every country.

00:07:09.336 --> 00:07:12.169
Suddenly you discover.

00:07:12.862 --> 00:07:15.924
You have faith in one country, you find,
oh no, no, they were supporting

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:20.507
certain person secretly.

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:23.369
So whether they are democratic or anything,

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.461
there is a kind of a mafia working
everywhere under some name.

00:07:28.662 --> 00:07:34.963
So the so-called laws also are only
for people who are simple, gullible,

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:39.610
pure citizens, and not for the people
who put those laws on them.

00:07:39.811 --> 00:07:43.210
They take bribes, they take all kinds
of things, but still

00:07:43.411 --> 00:07:48.376
they are supposed to be in charge of law,
doing all kinds of illegal things,

00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:52.785
because they have made the law, so they
know how to be illegal.

00:07:52.986 --> 00:07:58.475
So this is the second type of fear that is
in the minds of the modern time.

00:07:58.676 --> 00:08:04.623
Then the third thing was the war.
Wars after wars came in,

00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:10.319
so many people developed a kind of a fear
about war,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.803
and as a reaction they developed a kind
of a stupid ego,

00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:19.710
just they said, to protect themselves.

00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:26.726
In protection, themselves, they have
built up a big ego

00:08:26.927 --> 00:08:34.592
and they are now becoming very,
we should say, aggressive people.

00:08:36.893 --> 00:08:46.526
So this kind of a wider range,
I should say, of fear,

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:52.905
it can be directed into any direction,
it can be directed towards anyone.

00:08:53.106 --> 00:09:01.091
Then comes - is the fear of race -
racialism.

00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:06.824
Now I'm told that neo-nazism is taking
its own course

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:10.662
and is coming up like a little snake.

00:09:13.374 --> 00:09:19.221
So this is another area which is very
dangerous now, working out.

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:26.892
Now in the minds of seekers -
in their seeking,

00:09:27.093 --> 00:09:29.650
they have been to many gurus, they have
read all kinds of books

00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:33.643
but they were seeking, you know. !!!!!!AAAAAAAAA
They can, they were seeking, yet...

00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:37.193
drink any kind of water, develop all kinds
of diseases, what can you do?

00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:42.538
You are seeking after all, you are thirsty.
It has to be excused.

00:09:42.739 --> 00:09:45.506
And that's how they develop lots
of problems,

00:09:45.707 --> 00:09:48.842
not only in their body but also
in their brain.

00:09:49.043 --> 00:09:52.760
And now it's a very delicate thing.
If you tell somebody

00:09:52.961 --> 00:09:56.128
that you have been to such and such guru,
he doesn't want to hear

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:59.671
because for him now the guru has become
the last word.

00:09:59.872 --> 00:10:02.993
You cannot say anything against his guru.

00:10:03.194 --> 00:10:06.742
Now when he starts suffering, then he may
accept,

00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:09.931
but to take it out that guru is also
very delicate

00:10:10.132 --> 00:10:14.328
because if you want to take out that guru,
then he might be hurt.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:18.317
So it's a very delicate operation.

00:10:19.755 --> 00:10:24.165
Then the modern society, the less said
the better.

00:10:24.366 --> 00:10:28.781
The norms of modern society are given
to us by people

00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:35.354
who were characterless like Freud, who had
no sense of morality,

00:10:35.555 --> 00:10:39.837
or by drunkards, though they don't have
any statues of drunkards.

00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:46.446
But most of them, if you see the abandonment
of our value system comes through drinking.

00:10:46.647 --> 00:10:49.800
And the drinking was there but not
to this extent, I mean,

00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:53.248
everybody was not a drunkard, these days
everybody can be a drunkard.

00:10:53.449 --> 00:10:56.488
And there's no shame about it.
With that drinking

00:10:56.659 --> 00:11:04.547
our value system started dropping down
and people have accepted now,

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:09.334
the normal thing is abandonment.
This is another way.

00:11:11.978 --> 00:11:16.767
Formerly the parents used to support
the person if he would take to God,

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:20.673
if he would take to righteous life
or to something higher.

00:11:20.874 --> 00:11:24.656
And if they saw these qualities in their
child they used to be happy,

00:11:24.857 --> 00:11:29.533
but these days the other way round,
the parents don't like it.

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:34.573
As if the parents have lost everything
in themselves,

00:11:34.774 --> 00:11:40.094
so they want to hold on to their children,
grandchildren and possess them.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:44.326
And brainless creatures, because their
brain has been already washed out,

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:50.284
there's nothing in their brains. To fight
the parents also is a big problem.

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:54.185
So this kind of a fear is also there, that:
"My mother should not know,

00:11:54.386 --> 00:11:58.252
my father should not know," this, that.

00:11:59.024 --> 00:12:02.358
You can say from all sides

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:09.796
the fear is burning, like flames.

00:12:09.997 --> 00:12:17.279
And we are now here, in Kali Yuga, we have
started Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:20.217 --> 00:12:29.509
So the way we have to work out
our protection has to be mutual.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:36.411
Mother of course is there to protect you
all the time,

00:12:36.612 --> 00:12:39.800
Her powers are there to protect you.

00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:44.492
But surprisingly in the modern times,

00:12:44.693 --> 00:12:49.529
there's one condition which has to be
fulfilled.

00:12:51.339 --> 00:12:56.684
Because in those days good were good

00:12:56.885 --> 00:13:01.905
and evil were evil, there was no mixing up.

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:05.538
So once they asked for Goddess, they
accepted Her,

00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:09.126
She came in Her real form and She worked
it out.

00:13:09.327 --> 00:13:14.247
But in modern times, you must know that
all these evil things

00:13:14.448 --> 00:13:18.756
are also lingering in your head, little bit
here and there.

00:13:18.957 --> 00:13:21.371
People are extremely superficial,

00:13:21.572 --> 00:13:28.834
they are very much prone to the mass
attitude, fashions, things like that.

00:13:29.035 --> 00:13:33.934
Sort of, their personality is not that
developed as that

00:13:34.135 --> 00:13:38.634
of those bhaktas who knew they were right,
who knew they were righteous,

00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:40.884
who knew whatever they were doing
was correct

00:13:41.085 --> 00:13:48.150
and were standing on their legs firm.

00:13:48.351 --> 00:13:57.048
So the modern Sahaja Yogi is very different
from the Sahaja Yogi of olden times.

00:13:57.249 --> 00:14:03.794
Because in the olden times it was not easy
to get Realization.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.896
One in a billion, or in a trillion.

00:14:10.262 --> 00:14:14.990
And they had to work very hard, so as they
worked hard, very hard,

00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:20.016
they got cleansed and built up themselves,
you see, and toiled.

00:14:20.217 --> 00:14:24.951
Like any art piece which takes time,
is done with care,

00:14:25.122 --> 00:14:28.216
is definitely thousand times better than
these modern artists

00:14:28.417 --> 00:14:31.212
just putting two, three lines like this.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:35.669
So the today's human being is like a modern
artist, you see.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.426
You put one line and you say: "You must
see this into that person,

00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:42.948
you must have an identity." I mean,
what identity people can have?

00:14:43.149 --> 00:14:47.634
With one line, you say, find out
the identity.

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:54.787
So the Sahaja Yogis which are today here,
have to realize

00:14:54.988 --> 00:15:02.358
that all these things are surrounding us,
and these evil forces are also there.

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:06.807
There are some within us, some are without.

00:15:07.451 --> 00:15:12.925
So it's a - looks to be very difficult
task, but it's not.

00:15:15.444 --> 00:15:20.553
Because one condition if you can
understand,

00:15:21.968 --> 00:15:25.359
is that you have to recognize Me.

00:15:25.568 --> 00:15:30.777
I know I am Mahamaya, I'm really very
clever at it.

00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:42.824
But I am truthful, I do not have crocodile
tears, I cannot have.

00:15:43.201 --> 00:15:48.940
I am truthful, but still I am Mahamaya.

00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:54.435
So to recognize Me what should we do?

00:15:55.208 --> 00:15:59.749
If we recognize then you are protected.

00:16:02.536 --> 00:16:09.872
And the cleansing is the simplest thing
in Sahaja Yoga is to be collective.

00:16:10.073 --> 00:16:16.236
If you are not collective then know that
something wrong with you.

00:16:16.563 --> 00:16:22.678
If you are collective then as if you are
taking your bath in the river Ganges.

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:26.700
You don't have to go to Himalayas, you
don't have to do individual sadhana much,

00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:30.015
you don't have to... just be collective.
If you are collective,

00:16:30.216 --> 00:16:36.423
if you are enjoying the collective, then
you should know that you are clean.

00:16:36.624 --> 00:16:42.508
No blemishes there, you are absolutely
all right.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:49.527
Now the second part of is - this Mahamaya
business.

00:16:49.727 --> 00:16:54.223
I had to be very close to you, I had to be
extremely close,

00:16:54.424 --> 00:16:58.682
talk to you, to have a rapport, to tell you
everything about Yoga

00:16:58.883 --> 00:17:04.702
to make you absolutely aware of yourself.
This had to be done,

00:17:04.903 --> 00:17:08.516
and with all these complications within
your mind,

00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:14.180
within your heart, within your body, I had
to work it out.

00:17:14.381 --> 00:17:21.879
To come close in the real form would have
been very dangerous,

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:28.052
so One had to be a Mahamaya. But
despite that,

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:37.654
if you could recognize Me,
to understand Me,

00:17:37.855 --> 00:17:44.123
that I am Divine personality,
it's an Incarnation -

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.749
that's all the Deities want. Then they'll
look after you in every way.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:56.034
They'll give you all the powers, they'll
give you all the satisfaction,

00:17:56.235 --> 00:18:02.095
all the protection that you want. This is
the condition

00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:06.708
which for a rational mind is very difficult
to understand,

00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:12.761
that how can Adi Shakti be in one body?

00:18:13.795 --> 00:18:18.176
How can the Infinite can become finite?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.298
But human beings cannot do that.

00:18:23.982 --> 00:18:30.021
Only human beings. God can do it. He is God
after all.

00:18:31.245 --> 00:18:37.447
And if so, you have so many miracles,
you have so many photographs,

00:18:37.648 --> 00:18:43.415
so many things to see, but this is what
one has to recognize.

00:18:44.028 --> 00:18:48.776
Now I see people, when I talk to them

00:18:48.977 --> 00:18:53.972
they start talking to Me a little
frivolously,

00:18:54.173 --> 00:19:00.621
not with that depth, not with that feeling
that I am Mahamaya.

00:19:00.829 --> 00:19:05.604
Then some of them even answer Me. Some
of them, if I tell them something,

00:19:05.805 --> 00:19:11.983
they are ready to give an answer,
explanation.

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:16.941
Of course this freedom I have given you
deliberately,

00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:25.696
but must understand that you have
to talk to Me

00:19:25.897 --> 00:19:32.560
in a way that is, you would talk
to Adi Shakti.

00:19:33.134 --> 00:19:35.635
Very important.

00:19:41.018 --> 00:19:47.919
Then how you behave is very important.
You should not be artificial,

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:54.213
you should not be superficial, but best is
to put your hand on your heart,

00:19:54.414 --> 00:19:59.983
both the hands, and just try to feel it.

00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:04.392
Your Mother is Adi Shakti.

00:20:05.009 --> 00:20:11.406
She has created all this Universe, She
has created all this world,

00:20:12.067 --> 00:20:19.815
She is for your protection. Even
Shri Krishna could not protect

00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:26.086
Pandavas - they had to go in the forest,
they had to suffer.

00:20:26.287 --> 00:20:29.827
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:30.766 --> 00:20:37.217
As soon as I come to know about your
problems, My attention can work out.

00:20:37.418 --> 00:20:41.540
Shri Rama Himself had to go to jungles.

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:50.021
All this is given to you, this protection,
because you are seekers of truth,

00:20:50.222 --> 00:20:58.486
and the truth is that I am the Adi Shakti
incarnated.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.618
Once this truth becomes one with yourself

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.650
there is nothing to fear, because
all the Deities know this fact,

00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:21.763
they know about this Incarnation very well.
They are all prepared for it,

00:21:21.964 --> 00:21:30.885
and they'll do anything to substantiate
your belief.

00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:36.911
In every way they are trying to give you
My photographs, in the sky, this, that,

00:21:37.112 --> 00:21:41.756
I mean all sorts of things. God knows what
they are going to do today.

00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:45.169
They are so anxious.

00:21:45.463 --> 00:21:49.714
They are behind the stage, before
the stage, all sides of the stage,

00:21:49.915 --> 00:21:55.544
listening to Me, feeling happy that I am
telling you the truth.

00:21:55.745 --> 00:22:02.965
But the way they recognize and the way
they act, they never disobey.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.940
If you behave in the same manner

00:22:10.141 --> 00:22:15.784
you are completely protected from all these
problems I have told you about.

00:22:17.445 --> 00:22:23.761
Now I won't say you shouldn't hate anyone,
you shouldn't do.., nothing of the kind.

00:22:27.144 --> 00:22:31.230
I wouldn't say you should not steal
something.

00:22:31.431 --> 00:22:37.838
I wouldn't say that you make money, don't
make money out of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:42.049
I don't even say don't drink, don't smoke,
I never said so.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:47.119
But automatically once you know whom
you are facing,

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.520
in whose protection you are, automatically
you will do that.

00:22:51.721 --> 00:22:54.635
Automatically. You will have no fear.

00:22:54.836 --> 00:22:59.576
Once you have recognized you will have
no fear from anyone.

00:22:59.777 --> 00:23:07.385
And the more you show that recognition,
the more you realize it,

00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:13.582
you get higher and higher. Not only
spiritually,

00:23:13.783 --> 00:23:19.955
but every way - mentally, socially,
economically, politically.

00:23:22.774 --> 00:23:26.152
It's very remarkable

00:23:27.685 --> 00:23:33.929
that not only that you recognize Me
as a Mother who loves you very much,

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:41.786
but a Mother who is powerful to protect
you, She’s very powerful.

00:23:45.081 --> 00:23:49.522
If you realize that, and if you feel that
within your heart,

00:23:49.723 --> 00:23:54.892
supposing I correct you sometime, instead
of feeling sad you should see it

00:23:55.093 --> 00:23:59.357
that "How fortunate I am that Adi Shakti
Herself is correcting me.

00:23:59.558 --> 00:24:02.862
She is taking interest in me.

00:24:03.063 --> 00:24:07.667
How fortunate I am to be born at this time,

00:24:07.868 --> 00:24:14.127
to be with Her in Her great work, what
have I done?"

00:24:16.867 --> 00:24:25.075
This recognition itself will fulfil all
the incarnations of Navaratri.

00:24:25.276 --> 00:24:31.028
So today we are worshipping the Durga,
Kali,

00:24:31.229 --> 00:24:35.752
all these great Goddesses, these Powers,
even Radha.

00:24:35.954 --> 00:24:39.126
It was Radha who killed Kamsa not
Shri Krishna.

00:24:39.342 --> 00:24:45.989
He had to ask Radha to come and kill him.
It's the Power that kills.

00:24:52.703 --> 00:24:57.196
So if you realize

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:04.434
that your Mother is the Adi Shakti.

00:25:04.635 --> 00:25:07.879
I know of so many people.

00:25:08.515 --> 00:25:13.225
There's one gentleman who is working
in London airport.

00:25:13.592 --> 00:25:16.087
Somebody tried to trouble him. He said:
"You see, be careful of?ah...

00:25:16.288 --> 00:25:19.646
my Mother is very powerful, you don't
know."

00:25:19.815 --> 00:25:24.985
Next day that man lost his job, lost
his business, lost this, lost this,

00:25:25.186 --> 00:25:30.355
and he came to him and said: "Now which
is your Mother, let me see Her?"

00:25:35.474 --> 00:25:42.012
There was a farmer in, near Rahuri,

00:25:42.213 --> 00:25:49.105
and in the night three men came to steal
some sugar cane.

00:25:50.552 --> 00:25:57.724
And next day they came and they said:
"Which Goddess do you worship?"

00:25:57.925 --> 00:26:06.994
He said: "Why?". "There were three hefty
people watching your - guarding your field,

00:26:07.202 --> 00:26:10.460
and we came just to... and we thought,
better take some of this sugar cane,

00:26:10.661 --> 00:26:17.987
after all, it looks so nice, and they beat
us. Of course we never got hurt."

00:26:21.324 --> 00:26:26.387
So just behind this recognition is
all the powers.

00:26:26.588 --> 00:26:30.702
There's so many, so many stories I can
tell you,

00:26:30.903 --> 00:26:34.928
how things have happened, how it has
worked out.

00:26:37.795 --> 00:26:45.124
But if you are doubting, still halfway,
this, that, then things won't be all right.

00:26:46.983 --> 00:26:50.229
You shouldn't worry about your reputation.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:57.701
Just go with full speed into any direction,
knowing one thing -

00:26:57.902 --> 00:27:06.612
that you are My child, and that I am
Adi Shakti.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.942
Everything that looks horrible will become
better.

00:27:11.143 --> 00:27:16.486
We have seen it now in this France case,
and all that, what has happened.

00:27:16.687 --> 00:27:21.668
Don't worry about anything, just know that

00:27:23.637 --> 00:27:26.444
I am the Adi Shakti.

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:33.712
That all the powers of Gods and Goddesses
and all that are within Me,

00:27:33.913 --> 00:27:38.113
and they are within Me, and they are all
looking after you.

00:27:38.314 --> 00:27:43.949
But if that recognition is not there, they
are not going to recognize you either.

00:27:50.444 --> 00:27:55.699
So for today's Navaratri I have to tell you
that just try to keep in mind

00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:01.562
that today you are worshipping
the Adi Shakti and not only Durga.

00:28:03.319 --> 00:28:07.737
And you are worshipping Durga and all
these Goddesses to thank them.

00:28:07.938 --> 00:28:11.784
Because if they had not saved you that time
you would have been so frightened,

00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:15.781
you would have become bad people and
you would not have been here.

00:28:15.982 --> 00:28:19.960
That is why we are thankful to them
for saving us

00:28:20.169 --> 00:28:26.687
and giving us this protection at that time
when we were very helpless.

00:28:31.856 --> 00:28:34.726
May God bless you all.
