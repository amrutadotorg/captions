00:00.350 --> 00:07.917
It was astounding the way, today, Debuji
[Debu Chaudhuri] played so well.

00:08.118 --> 00:12.359
Every time you hear him, there is
such a variety

00:12.560 --> 00:21.449
and such a deep understanding
of the principle of music.

00:22.761 --> 00:31.270
And the principle of music is that
it should entertain the Spirit.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.749
You, being Sahaja Yogis,

00:36.950 --> 00:45.865
and most of you have never learnt any
Indian music as such, like me;

00:46.113 --> 00:57.591
but it’s a fact that Indian music comes
from Omkar,

00:57.836 --> 01:03.113
from the Divine source of sound.

01:03.314 --> 01:14.809
And that’s why that comforts, entertains,
amuses the Spirit.

01:16.726 --> 01:25.381
Otherwise the Spirit is so self-satisfied
by itself, it enjoys itself.

01:26.143 --> 01:32.853
But with music and art, I feel
it gets its reflection

01:33.054 --> 01:43.307
reflects its own beautiful existence,

01:43.508 --> 01:50.681
which is permeating into every little
particle,

01:50.882 --> 01:53.802
into every molecule, into every atom.

01:54.003 --> 01:58.633
And that reflection when the Spirit sees,

01:58.834 --> 02:07.442
it has that new dimension of a beautiful
expansion of its personality,

02:07.643 --> 02:12.975
and as if you feel you are resounding
in the whole universe.

02:13.176 --> 02:19.847
Is the beauty of Indian music is this.
But especially with Debu,

02:20.048 --> 02:23.411
I’m very grateful to him that he has come
here with his son Prateek,

02:23.612 --> 02:25.478
whom I’ve seen as a little boy.

02:25.679 --> 02:29.580
And it’s so heartening to see he has taken
this art so seriously.

02:29.781 --> 02:34.351
Normally these days, young boys do not
take to art much.

02:34.552 --> 02:39.952
And that he should learn from his father,
that’s even a greater thing -

02:40.153 --> 02:51.354
that we have such delicate weaving and
such strong strokes of depth from Debu.

02:51.555 --> 02:58.252
And he is creating mirth, I felt he is like
strokes, creating mirth was Debu -

02:58.453 --> 03:06.429
was something, we can say, like some
of the very, very senior sages:

03:06.630 --> 03:10.684
as if they were playing some sort
of a hymn.

03:10.885 --> 03:17.089
It was a beautiful combination of both
father and son.

03:17.290 --> 03:20.172
I bless them from my heart for giving us

03:20.373 --> 03:26.104
such a beautiful feeling of expansion
within ourselves of our joy.

03:26.305 --> 03:30.402
Then we have Somnath, Somnathji
is a very good artist

03:30.603 --> 03:35.122
and he’s so well played today, so much
in concord

03:35.323 --> 03:41.576
and understanding with both of them.
It was such a beautiful try.

03:41.777 --> 03:44.831
I am really thankful to him that
they came all the way

03:45.032 --> 03:49.249
from India to play for us here. And
Debuji is a realized soul,

03:49.450 --> 03:52.464
his son is a realized soul; they are all
realized souls.

03:52.665 --> 03:56.503
You see, the rapport between them and you
was so beautifully done.

03:56.704 --> 04:01.422
I mean, it is not possible to describe
the joy,

04:01.623 --> 04:05.274
the Nirananda that you felt with this.

04:05.475 --> 04:11.757
Only one can say that the collectivity
of enjoyment

04:11.958 --> 04:15.411
one can have through this kind of music.

04:15.612 --> 04:19.075
I hope some of you also pick up from this.

04:19.276 --> 04:22.046
Dedicate yourself to this art of music,

04:22.247 --> 04:29.021
because for a realized soul it is very easy
to go further with it

04:29.222 --> 04:34.430
Though it’s a big tapasya, Indian music
is not an easy thing.

04:34.631 --> 04:40.207
It is a great dedication, concentration
and reverence.

04:40.408 --> 04:43.600
Otherwise you do not work it out.

04:43.801 --> 04:47.977
I’m happy that there are some Sahaja
Yogis who are now taking lessons

04:48.178 --> 04:53.610
in tabla and also in classical music.

04:53.811 --> 05:02.422
And the way our Sahaja Yogis sing
is something remarkable,

05:02.623 --> 05:07.912
that even the Maharashtrians actors and
actresses, who sing very well,

05:08.113 --> 05:10.850
had come to our programme and they
said that,

05:11.051 --> 05:15.037
“We really felt ashamed of ourselves
the way the Sahaja Yogis were singing

05:15.238 --> 05:21.567
Marathi songs and the way they were
so beautifully, rhythmically bind

05:21.768 --> 05:24.358
and how they put us together with them.”

05:24.559 --> 05:30.482
So, it’s a very beautiful net that binds
us together

05:30.683 --> 05:34.137
for our collectivity, for our delicate
feelings,

05:34.338 --> 05:40.115
and how we should be with each other,
like the music.

05:40.315 --> 05:50.163
Because the notes were very deep,
very deep, touching your heart

05:50.364 --> 05:57.861
and were spreading a kind of a light
of love in your heart,

05:58.062 --> 06:00.714
and that touches each other’s heart.

06:00.915 --> 06:06.244
And that’s what should be the understanding
of music,

06:06.445 --> 06:10.937
that it should really reach our heart.
And through our heart,

06:11.138 --> 06:18.278
we should try to feel other people,
their depth and their wisdom,

06:18.479 --> 06:24.833
their understanding and a kind
of a beautiful anxiety

06:25.034 --> 06:30.110
to please others, to make others happy,
to entertain them.

06:30.311 --> 06:32.065
And the little Prateek, I’m so happy!

06:32.266 --> 06:34.498
Prateek means “symbol”, you know, he is
a symbol of music.

06:34.699 --> 06:39.024
I hope he comes up very well and gets
a very big name in the whole world.

06:39.225 --> 06:43.711
Same for Somnath, he’s a young boy,
he’s coming up and they should keep it up.

06:43.912 --> 06:49.148
I feel so very, very happy about
the new way

06:49.348 --> 06:51.900
of young people are taking to music.

06:52.101 --> 06:55.689
And especially, if Sahaja Yogis take
to this music,

06:55.890 --> 07:01.543
it will be a very, very demanding thing
today,

07:01.744 --> 07:06.406
because Indian music is now being
neglected very much

07:06.607 --> 07:11.910
by the younger generation in India. It’s
a very sad thing but it’s happening.

07:12.111 --> 07:21.000
But for that, we have to know that
a balanced personality has to be achieved.

07:21.201 --> 07:26.312
You have to have creativity. Creativity
is there, of course,

07:26.513 --> 07:29.930
works out through your Kundalini
the creativity comes up,

07:30.131 --> 07:33.061
but you must have the technique
to express it.

07:33.262 --> 07:40.848
And the third thing is the sweetness,
the understanding,

07:41.049 --> 07:44.161
or I would say the rapport with
the audience:

07:44.362 --> 07:48.450
where to pull which string that we call
mindkaris, you see.

07:48.651 --> 07:51.629
And especially, his notes are not full,

07:51.830 --> 07:56.935
there are two missing, I think,
in his sitar which I saw.

07:57.136 --> 08:00.845
Without that how he pulls it up and plays.

08:01.046 --> 08:06.712
And the son, also, has a good way
of playing with three fingers,

08:06.913 --> 08:09.390
I saw was a different style.

08:09.591 --> 08:14.945
It will be very appealing to you people,
because that creates mirth.

08:15.541 --> 08:18.854
So, we should go to the essence of it
and see for ourselves

08:19.055 --> 08:23.462
and not worry as to what is the tala,
what is the raga, what is this.

08:23.663 --> 08:28.093
That’s not for us, for Sahaja Yogis.
We have to just enjoy

08:28.294 --> 08:31.868
without reacting to it, in thoughtless
awareness.

08:32.069 --> 08:35.811
Just enjoy the whole creativity, not
to worry too much

08:36.011 --> 08:39.013
about what is the raga is, what is
the note is.

08:39.214 --> 08:47.145
Now, for example, he played a very, I would
say, a very unique type of Bhairavi.

08:47.346 --> 08:49.042
He’s brought everything, every style

08:49.243 --> 08:52.098
like, ‘tapasya’ was also there a little
bit, that we saw.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.599
And I mean, it is really, I’ve never heard
such a thing before.

08:55.800 --> 09:02.296
So, it’s a very unique style of creating
like this.

09:02.497 --> 09:06.055
And as long as you are creating newer
and newer things,

09:06.256 --> 09:17.297
without compromising with the, say,
our system of raga type.

09:17.498 --> 09:19.223
Means, you see, it should be in raag -

09:19.424 --> 09:24.017
“Ra”: “ra” comes from “energy”, “ga”
means “which moves”, you see.

09:24.218 --> 09:32.470
And also, the Divine Mother’s protection
is called as Raganchal.

09:32.671 --> 09:40.616
Means, you see, the energy which moves
in such a subtle and a beautiful manner

09:40.817 --> 09:43.960
that it gives you a protection.

09:44.161 --> 09:50.545
And in that protection, your dimensions
touch the Heavens. It’s like that.

09:50.746 --> 09:57.148
And this is created, this Raganchal,
is created by our music.

09:57.349 --> 10:09.280
The lilt and the rhythm, these are all
factors which are so balanced

10:09.481 --> 10:16.589
that unless and until you have a balanced
personality, you cannot understand it.

10:16.790 --> 10:23.374
Here, our eyes are towards the sky,
we are looking at the stars walking.

10:23.575 --> 10:29.563
And here, our feet are on the Mother Earth
in such a beautiful manner.

10:29.764 --> 10:35.244
If you hear this music, then you will know
what it is. To me it’s heavenly.

10:35.445 --> 10:41.194
And I’m very thankful to you, Debu,
so very much thankful, my child.

10:41.395 --> 10:43.628
Debu Chaudhuri: You’re welcome.
Shri Mataji: And – really, and you fill me…

10:43.829 --> 10:47.923
Debu Chaudhuri: My, my, my… it’s my honour.

10:48.124 --> 10:50.063
Shri Mataji: Saying all this is too much,
really.

10:50.264 --> 10:51.873
Debu Chaudhuri: You shouldn’t say
thank you to me.

10:52.074 --> 10:58.649
Shri Mataji: You see, it’s a - if my love
can really create all this,

10:58.850 --> 11:05.114
I’m thankful to this love that has done
all this good work for all of you.

11:05.315 --> 11:08.199
May God bless you.
