1
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:12,524
Now, second is about food.

2
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:18,080
But that’s the first seeking human
beings had as animals.

3
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:21,772
No attention on food.

4
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:27,971
Whether you have salt or not, whether
you have this or that

5
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,058
- no attention on food.

6
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:39,136
Actually, you should not remember
what you ate this morning.

7
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:43,795
But we think as to what we are going
to eat tomorrow.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,954
We consume food not for running this body
but for sort of a

9
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:58,853
more satisfaction of tongue pleasures.

10
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:05,333
Once you start understanding that pleasure
is a sign of gross attention

11
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:11,918
- any kind of pleasure is a very

12
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:20,397
gross sensationalization - sensations.
Very gross it is.

13
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:26,261
But when I say, "No pleasures," means, doesn't
mean that you should become serious people

14
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:34,404
and people of, sort of, 
as if somebody is dead in your family!

15
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:41,510
But you should be like Shiva.
So detached.

16
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,910
He came on a bull, which was running
very fast, to get married.

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,146
He was sitting on a bull with His two feet
like this, you see,

18
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:52,866
and the bull is running fast and He is
holding the bull.

19
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,772
The feet like this!

20
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,401
And He’s coming for His wedding.

21
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:07,343
And with Him are coming people
with one eye,

22
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:12,261
without noses, all kinds of funny people
coming with Him.

23
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:17,879
And His wife feeling quite embarrassed
at the nonsensical

24
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:22,412
things people are talking about Shiva.

25
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:28,117
He is not bothered what’s His reputation
would be, this thing.

26
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:33,581
But that doesn't mean that you become
hippies. You see this is the problem is:

27
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,998
that once you start thinking like that,
you become hippies.

28
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:45,789
So attachment to anything is ugliness.

29
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:49,934
Is ugliness, is nonsense.

30
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:55,070
But you can dress up whatever way
you like,

31
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,881
or even if you are in the most ordinary
dress,

32
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:03,122
you will look the most magnificent person.

33
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,935
But it's not that if you, if you say that,
"All right, so under these circumstances,

34
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:13,941
let us go about on a one sheet wrapped
around".

35
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:18,256
The beauty that has evolved within you
through Spirit,

36
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:22,078
gives you that power that you can wear
whatever you feel like -

37
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,372
makes no difference to your beauty,
your beauty is there all the time.

38
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:30,836
But have you achieved that state?

39
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:38,873
And that state only you achieve when
your Spirit enters into your brain.

40
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:44,214
With ego-oriented people is more difficult,
and that’s why they cannot enjoy things.

41
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:48,369
At the slightest pretext, they topple
down.

42
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:55,632
And Spirit, which is the source of joy,
just doesn't come in,

43
00:03:55,712 --> 00:04:03,329
doesn't show. The joy is beauty.
The joy itself is beauty.

44
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:10,345
But that is a state one has to achieve.

45
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:14,924
Attachments come by various methods.

46
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:21,869
If you go little ahead with it, then you
have attachments of your family,

47
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:24,969
“What will happen to my child? What will
happen to my husband?

48
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:30,830
What will happen to my mother, to my
wife?", this, that nonsense.

49
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:40,038
Who is your father and who is your mother?
Who is your husband and who is your wife?

50
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:43,886
For Shiva, He doesn't know all these
things.

51
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:50,752
To Him, He and His Power are inseparable
things.

52
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:56,546
So He stands as singular personality.

53
00:04:57,286 --> 00:05:05,096
There is no dual... duality. When there is
duality, then only you say, “my wife.”

54
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:13,618
You go on saying, “my nose, my ears,
my hands,

55
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:18,856
my, my, my, my.” Go, go, go deep down.

56
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:24,021
Till you say “my”, there is some duality.

57
00:05:27,387 --> 00:05:34,157
But when I say, "I, the nose", then
there is no duality.

58
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:39,934
Shiva the Shakti, Shakti the Shiva.
There’s no duality.

59
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:46,180
But we live throughout on our duality,
and because of that,

60
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,112
there is an attachment. If there is no
duality, what is the attachment, you see?

61
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:57,106
If you are the light and you are the lamp,
then where is the duality?

62
00:05:57,186 --> 00:06:03,012
If you are the moon and you are the
moonlight, then where is the duality?

63
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:06,338
If you are the sun and you are
the sunlight,

64
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:13,058
you are the word and you are the meaning,
then where is the duality?

65
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:19,392
That's only possible when your Spirit
comes into your brain,

66
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:26,856
and you become part and parcel of Virat
Itself. Virat is the brain, as I told you.

67
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:37,566
Then everything that you do - when you
show your temper,

68
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:41,209
when you show your affection, when you
show your compassion, anything -

69
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:47,121
is the Spirit that is expressing, because
brain has lost its identity.

70
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,869
The so-called limited brain, it has
become the unlimited Spirit.

71
00:06:52,976 --> 00:07:01,729
So the Spirit is like the ocean,
which has the light in it.

72
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:11,025
And when this ocean pours into
the little cup of our brain,

73
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:18,667
the cup loses its identity, and everything
becomes spiritual. Everything.

74
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:23,605
You can make everything spiritual,
everything. You touch anything, is spiritual:

75
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:27,510
this sand becomes spiritual, 
the land becomes spiritual,

76
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,839
atmosphere becomes spiritual,
celestial bodies become spiritual.

77
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,804
Everything becomes spiritual.

78
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:44,439
So is the ocean that is the Spirit,
while your brain is limited.

79
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:52,178
So the detachment from your limited brain
has to be brought in.

80
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:57,744
All limitations of brain should be broken,
so that when this ocean

81
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:07,540
fills that brain, it should break
that little cup,

82
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:12,421
and every bit of that cup should become
colourful.

83
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:19,192
The whole atmosphere, everything,
whatever you locate, should be colourful.

84
00:08:19,272 --> 00:08:22,532
Colour of the Spirit is the light
of the Spirit;

85
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:30,254
and this light of the Spirit acts, works,
thinks, coordinates, does everything.

86
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:38,549
This is the reason today I decide
to bring Shiva Tattwa to the brain.

87
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:44,506
The first procedure is to take your brain
towards the Shiva Tattwa by telling it,

88
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:49,219
"See, where are you going, Mr. Brain?

89
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:53,176
You're putting attention to this,
you're putting attention to that,

90
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:56,786
getting involved - now detach, become
the brain yourself.

91
00:08:56,866 --> 00:09:00,859
Only the brain. Detach, Detach".

92
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:06,411
And then, take this detached brain,
completely filled with the colour

93
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:10,953
of the Spirit. It will automatically
happen.

94
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:20,339
As long as you'll have these limitations
to your attention, it will not happen.

95
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:30,340
So one has to really, deliberately
do this tapasya. Every individual.

96
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:35,243
I'm with you;

97
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:41,758
so you don't need any puja that way.

98
00:09:41,838 --> 00:09:51,335
But that state has to be achieved, and for
achieving that state, you need the puja.

99
00:09:54,019 --> 00:10:01,370
I hope, so many of you'll become
the Shiva Tattwas in My lifetime.

100
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:09,270
But don't think I'm asking you to suffer.

101
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,167
There is no suffering in this kind
of an ascent.

102
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:19,504
If you understand that this is the complete
joyous state,

103
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:22,823
that is the time when you become
Nirananda.

104
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:27,471
That's the joy named in the Sahasrara,

105
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:33,398
the name of the joy is Nirananda, and
you know your Mother's name is Nira.

106
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:37,242
So you become Nirananda.
