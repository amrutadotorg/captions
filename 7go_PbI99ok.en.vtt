Sahaj Marriages 1995-1228,
Ganapatipule (India)

00:54:02.971 --> 00:54:11.412
It's very great to see that [the] number
of marriages are increasing,

00:54:11.613 --> 00:54:19.536
and you people have very happily accepted
the choice you have made.

00:54:19.753 --> 00:54:24.047
(has to be transcribed)

01:04:21.284 --> 01:04:27.015
So enjoy every moment now, all right?

02:00:25.497 --> 02:00:30.589
You are all ready to get married

02:00:30.810 --> 02:00:36.404
and I bless you from My heart.

02:00:38.050 --> 02:00:43.506
Now, the duty of a wife I need not tell
you, you know it very well.

02:00:43.707 --> 02:00:52.112
I've told many a times that she is
responsible to build the society of Sahaj.

02:00:52.708 --> 02:00:57.209
And as a result, she has [a] very great
responsibility.

02:00:57.410 --> 02:01:04.743
She has to look after the whole family,
the relations of [the] husband,

02:01:04.944 --> 02:01:16.941
and should go up to the great expectations
of the family members also.

02:01:17.142 --> 02:01:20.923
This can be done if you have really love
for people.

02:01:21.124 --> 02:01:25.394
If you have love, you wlll have tolerance
and you’ll be able

02:01:25.595 --> 02:01:31.050
to bring more people in Sahaja Yoga who
are related to you and to your husband

02:01:31.251 --> 02:01:38.982
by showing a very good household that
you have created.

02:01:43.577 --> 02:01:48.715
Towards the husband you have to be
very dedicated

02:01:48.916 --> 02:01:55.795
and don’t tell him about your past.
Past is finished and start afresh.

02:01:55.996 --> 02:02:01.132
It’s a very dangerous thing to say anything
about your past to your husband.

02:02:01.333 --> 02:02:11.029
So, you have your expectations, so he too
has his own expectations about you.

02:02:11.230 --> 02:02:15.479
Expectations should not be there
in Sahaja Yoga.

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:22.284
But gradually, if you understand the value
of your marriage and you respect it,

02:02:22.485 --> 02:02:26.586
then you will not go after superficial
things.

02:02:26.787 --> 02:02:36.449
You’ll not ask him to buy this, buy that
for you on a material level.

02:02:36.719 --> 02:02:43.361
But also on the mental level you should
not try to judge him,

02:02:43.570 --> 02:02:47.175
but as you are spiritual, he is also
spiritual.

02:02:47.376 --> 02:02:50.541
So, you should see his vibrations.

02:02:50.742 --> 02:02:57.413
Don’t tell him but try to correct it slowly
and steadily.

02:02:57.614 --> 02:03:05.461
It’s easy to complain about married life,
very easy, and it’s [a] very common thing.

02:03:05.662 --> 02:03:10.049
If there are two ladies who are
dissatisfied with their married life,

02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:18.999
can create a big number of people who
will be complaining about marriages.

02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:26.150
So, one has to be very watchful and
careful not to indulge into gossips

02:03:26.351 --> 02:03:32.807
and talking about some things which has
no meaning in Sahaja Yoga.

02:03:33.008 --> 02:03:37.959
Going to the higher life, we have to see
that, as we are spiritual people

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:41.933
we have to keep our spirituality growing
and growing

02:03:42.134 --> 02:03:45.928
so that great souls who want to be born
on this earth

02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:49.133
will take birth in your families.

02:03:49.334 --> 02:03:52.633
But that doesn’t mean, if you just get
attached to your own child,

02:03:52.834 --> 02:03:56.905
then others' children are not to be loved.

02:03:57.106 --> 02:04:02.537
Love doesn’t limit you, so you have to love
others' children also.

02:04:02.738 --> 02:04:05.890
The guests who come in your house,
you must look after.

02:04:06.091 --> 02:04:08.791
It is your duty to look after the guests.

02:04:08.992 --> 02:04:15.700
They are Sahaja Yogis, you have no business
to insult them or to trouble them.

02:04:15.901 --> 02:04:22.360
Your successful married life is going
to help so many people in this world.

02:04:22.561 --> 02:04:27.698
We have to show that Sahaja Yoga marriages
are extremely successful,

02:04:27.899 --> 02:04:31.917
peaceful and full of joy.

02:04:32.118 --> 02:04:36.407
If you want to find faults, you see,
there [is] no end to it.

02:04:36.608 --> 02:04:41.709
But it’s better to see your own faults
and correct yourself.

02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:50.819
Of course, if there is any problem which is
not soluble, which is absolutely difficult,

02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:56.369
then you can let Me know and I’ll try
to solve it if possible.

02:04:56.570 --> 02:05:02.309
Otherwise, you can depart. But it’s a very
last, extreme case.

02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:06.916
It’s the wife who makes the family,
she makes the marriage very good.

02:05:07.117 --> 02:05:11.683
So, it is for you to decide. Now, even now,
there is time,

02:05:11.884 --> 02:05:14.976
if you don’t want to marry, you don’t like
your husbands

02:05:15.177 --> 02:05:19.254
or in any way you think he is not
all right, you can decide now.

02:05:19.455 --> 02:05:23.393
There is time still for you to decide.

02:05:23.594 --> 02:05:27.843
We have to prove that our marriages,
Indian marriages,

02:05:28.044 --> 02:05:33.332
are not Indian: they are universal
marriages,

02:05:33.533 --> 02:05:40.689
and they are to be treated with that great
sense of responsibility.

02:05:41.913 --> 02:05:48.157
Once you understand your responsibility,
I’m sure you will know what is to be done.

02:05:48.358 --> 02:05:54.640
Firstly, you should never argue with your
husband, as far as possible.

02:05:54.841 --> 02:06:02.553
You should not shout at him; you should
not be disrespectful for him before others.

02:06:02.754 --> 02:06:07.059
And relationship between you and your
husband is a secret;

02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:13.204
it should not be discussed
on the cross-roads, you see.

02:06:13.405 --> 02:06:18.075
Let people see for themselves how happy
you are.

02:06:18.276 --> 02:06:20.820
But there is no need to be artificially
happy.

02:06:21.021 --> 02:06:23.492
There is no need to be artificially
suffering.

02:06:23.693 --> 02:06:26.769
There is no suffering that is allowed
in Sahaja Yoga,

02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:29.729
so if you think something is wrong...
[cut in the video].

02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:33.170
… is done, it is sinful. One should never
do like that;

02:06:33.370 --> 02:06:38.214
you are married in Sahaja Yoga not
to separate your husband from collectivity.

02:06:38.415 --> 02:06:45.443
There’s more enjoyment, more sharing
and no pressure

02:06:45.644 --> 02:06:48.797
if you all enjoy the collectivity.

02:06:48.998 --> 02:06:55.732
I know you are all very wise and good girls
and you will look after your family life

02:06:55.933 --> 02:07:01.071
and your social life and also look after
your husband.

02:07:01.272 --> 02:07:08.704
But you should also look after other people
and try to understand your problems:

02:07:08.905 --> 02:07:13.392
what problems you have, you had. And then
try to solve them

02:07:13.593 --> 02:07:18.169
so that those who come to your house
or those who are in contact with you

02:07:18.370 --> 02:07:23.410
will be specially blessed by your Gruha
Lakshmi quality.

02:07:23.611 --> 02:07:27.759
In a collective way you must meditate.
You must meditate at home

02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:34.755
and you must go to every meditation centre
whenever it is necessary.

02:07:34.956 --> 02:07:38.750
I’ve seen the women in Sahaja Yoga are
rather poor for spirituality,

02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:43.727
it’s very surprising. I am Myself a woman
and I can’t understand

02:07:43.928 --> 02:07:48.834
that they are so busy, you see, doing
all other things but not meditation.

02:07:49.035 --> 02:07:53.490
So, you have to become gems in Sahaja Yoga.
In spirituality you have to rise.

02:07:53.691 --> 02:07:56.001
For that you must meditate at home

02:07:56.202 --> 02:08:03.108
and also go to all the collective
programmes you have.

02:08:03.309 --> 02:08:06.967
This will help you a lot, help you,
your children;

02:08:07.168 --> 02:08:09.117
they will become very good children,

02:08:09.318 --> 02:08:17.069
and their whole standard of life will be
very much higher and spiritual.

02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:21.941
We have to create these great families.
That’s why I was insisting

02:08:22.142 --> 02:08:25.773
that we should have marriages here.
But by this, if we have

02:08:25.974 --> 02:08:30.481
all the other kind of useless marriages,
it’s better not to have.

02:08:30.682 --> 02:08:34.478
So, I request you to take up
the responsibility of a wife

02:08:34.679 --> 02:08:40.436
and look after the whole family, look after
the whole family of Sahaja Yogis.

02:08:40.637 --> 02:08:46.220
And apart from that, you have to think
what you can contribute to Sahaja Yoga.

02:08:46.421 --> 02:08:49.887
We have some very great women who have
done a lot,

02:08:50.088 --> 02:08:52.750
who are married women, done a lot
for Sahaja Yoga.

02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:59.718
In the same way, you should take up upon
yourself to do Sahaja Yoga work

02:08:59.919 --> 02:09:03.357
and Sahaja Yoga expansion.

02:09:03.558 --> 02:09:08.791
I hope you understand how important
you are in Sahaja Yoga.

02:09:08.992 --> 02:09:15.139
After all, this husband is more busy
outside

02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:20.596
and maybe he might little bit neglect you.
But that doesn’t mean that he neglects;

02:09:20.797 --> 02:09:24.474
you must understand that he has to work
hard and this and that.

02:09:24.675 --> 02:09:28.550
Also, there's the demand on his time,
demand on his money

02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:32.435
should be minimum, minimum that is
possible.

02:09:32.636 --> 02:09:37.178
But if [the] husband is absolutely careless
about you, and doesn’t bother about you

02:09:37.379 --> 02:09:40.082
or he dominates you or troubles you,
tortures you;

02:09:40.283 --> 02:09:45.353
in any way if you are unhappy, you are
open, absolutely open to write to Me

02:09:45.554 --> 02:09:47.275
about all that is happening,

02:09:47.476 --> 02:09:53.610
because I’ll try to correct him and I’ll
try to see what is the problem inside.

02:09:54.485 --> 02:09:59.114
The last thing one has to know [is] that
a woman has to be extremely moral.

02:09:59.323 --> 02:10:03.753
She has to be extremely moral. If she
becomes immoral,

02:10:03.954 --> 02:10:07.448
the husband will become immoral,
the children will become immoral.

02:10:07.649 --> 02:10:12.394
So, you have to stick onto your morality,
be proud of it and you can do it

02:10:12.595 --> 02:10:16.058
because God has given you a special
quality.

02:10:16.259 --> 02:10:20.891
So, it is your duty to keep great morality
in the family

02:10:21.092 --> 02:10:32.077
and to live like good citizens of your
country, citizens of Sahaja Yoga family.

02:10:32.278 --> 02:10:38.235
I bless you all with My heart again
and please accept what I’ve said.

02:10:38.436 --> 02:10:43.493
If you don’t want, even now, not to marry,
you can decide that;

02:10:43.694 --> 02:10:48.379
if possible, I will try to remove this out.

02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:51.333
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
