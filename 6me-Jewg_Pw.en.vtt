00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.580
﻿So today we have come here to Spain,

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:16.056
and there are so many
other Spanish Sahaja Yogis here,

00:00:30.277 --> 00:00:36.771
and you all have met them. By that,
they are very much strengthened in Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:47.360
that they feel that
they have brothers and sisters all over the world.

00:00:52.732 --> 00:00:56.732
Because in Spain there are very few Sahaja Yogis

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.618
and they feel quite lost because they are so few.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.553
But by your coming here,

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:23.460
it is a kind of a one hand helping another hand.

00:01:33.378 --> 00:01:39.748
Now Spain is developing materially,

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:49.640
and it is . . .

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:53.681
this time they have to be careful:

00:01:58.665 --> 00:02:06.280
They need not go all the
way to the overdeveloped state

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.730
and then suffer,

00:02:18.998 --> 00:02:21.998
and that suffering should not

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:28.640
become a kind of a punishment to
them like in many affluent countries.

00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:45.000
Because as materialism grows,

00:02:46.896 --> 00:02:50.010
it tries to overpower human beings.

00:02:56.995 --> 00:03:00.840
But if after realization,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.000
the materialism starts growing,
you master the matter.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.370
Then matter doesn’t sit on your head,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
because with realization you have discretion.

00:03:32.484 --> 00:03:36.118
And actually, materialism is,

00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:40.874
to be understood through
Lakshmi Tattwa, Lakshmi principal.

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.379
If you develop the wisdom in Sahaj Yoga,

00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:06.440
then you understand how
far to go with materialism.

00:04:12.374 --> 00:04:16.374
Matter is for you, you are not for the matter.

00:04:21.145 --> 00:04:25.240
Now I’ll tell you, gradually
how matter sits on our head.

00:04:31.182 --> 00:04:33.767
Before realization,

00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:40.640
first we start using the matter for our comfort.

00:04:46.004 --> 00:04:49.223
Through science, we develop ways and methods

00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:54.016
by which we develop a,

00:04:55.735 --> 00:05:00.208
life which gives you more comfort.

00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:14.280
In the beginning, it is all right that we
get sufficient food, a proper house to live in;

00:05:23.377 --> 00:05:28.220
but by that time we have already
become the slave of the matter.

00:05:34.696 --> 00:05:37.696
But matter is a dead thing.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.430
We just change the forms of matter –

00:05:46.517 --> 00:05:49.017
from dead to dead –

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.750
but we cannot do any living work.

00:05:57.636 --> 00:06:01.040
Now, this matter starts giving us habits,

00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:08.873
then we cannot get out of those habits,

00:06:12.018 --> 00:06:15.800
and gradually we start becoming slave of matter.

00:06:19.882 --> 00:06:22.694
It does not go that far.

00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:28.960
Now, if you have too many machineries,

00:06:32.174 --> 00:06:36.520
you produce things out of proportion.

00:06:42.392 --> 00:06:45.290
Like you have so many cars.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.240
In Paris, everybody is on the road only.

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:57.920
As soon as you are on the road,
you are on the road all the time.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.275
Better to be in the house.

00:07:06.216 --> 00:07:09.320
And you spend hours together.

00:07:13.168 --> 00:07:16.168
Then you start producing other things.

00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:24.360
Like, supposing they are producing clothes:

00:07:28.497 --> 00:07:31.145
the factories have to run –

00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:37.428
you cannot stop the factory.

00:07:39.075 --> 00:07:43.633
So then they start producing things such a lot,

00:07:43.833 --> 00:07:46.512
they don’t know how to sell it.

00:07:50.884 --> 00:07:54.600
Then they say that,
“All right, let us have fashions.”

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:03.400
Then these manufacturers float fashion houses.

00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:11.185
Now the fashion starts.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.160
With that, everybody
changes their clothes every year.

00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:22.120
They have to be according to the fashion,

00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:26.850
such a lot of money is wasted,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.019
but we also lose our individuality.

00:08:37.703 --> 00:08:43.120
In America, they play another trick,
also here I think – must be everywhere.

00:08:47.846 --> 00:08:52.371
Every year they produce a new type of handles,

00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:57.400
new type of tiles, new type of bathrooms.

00:09:02.787 --> 00:09:08.959
If you go to an American house,
better ask about the bathroom,

00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:17.535
otherwise when you enter in, maybe,

00:09:17.735 --> 00:09:22.431
you may be just drenched with
water with some showers falling on you.

00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:32.120
Or you may sit in the tub, and you may
press it and the whole tub might come like that.

00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:41.725
Their beds are also funny; you may press
on some button and the whole bed may come up.

00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:52.558
They have beds where they just
can fold on this part, or that part –

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:58.960
it is terrible, I mean if you press some buttons,
you might be going into acrobats all the time.

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:08.168
There is no need to do all that.

00:10:10.334 --> 00:10:14.960
But when you have out-of-proportion
machineries, then you have to do it,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:26.197
but that is how you become
slaves of these entrepreneurs.

00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:35.281
But in Sahaja Yoga, when you come in,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.480
you know how to do living work.

00:10:45.257 --> 00:10:49.454
Like in the affluent countries,

00:10:49.654 --> 00:10:53.720
they use seeds which are hybrid.

00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:01.724
Hybrid.

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:12.106
These hybrid seeds are of no nourishment to us,

00:11:12.307 --> 00:11:15.120
they are no good for our brains, they confuse us.

00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:28.200
Especially the hybrid animals,
their milk confuses us.

00:11:34.892 --> 00:11:38.320
Hybrid animals themselves are very confused.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.685
But in Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:45.886 --> 00:11:49.629
you take the ordinary seeds

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:56.695
and you vibrate them.

00:11:57.806 --> 00:12:01.274
If you vibrate them, then what happens,

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:09.475
that you start getting seeds
which are even better than hybrid.

00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:22.720
I tried an experiment with a sunflower.

00:12:27.395 --> 00:12:31.720
So, I developed a sunflower about 2 kilos weight,

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:38.520
about one foot diameter,

00:12:42.813 --> 00:12:47.560
and such big, big seeds that you can’t
make them out to be sunflower seeds.

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:58.440
So the collective was so amazed at it,

00:13:01.765 --> 00:13:06.720
and they felt that this
kind of seed will solve all our oil problem.

00:13:11.521 --> 00:13:14.623
Same thing happens with the animals.

00:13:16.876 --> 00:13:21.040
You take an ordinary cow, Indian ordinary cow,

00:13:25.778 --> 00:13:28.960
and you give her vibrated water to drink,

00:13:32.168 --> 00:13:38.080
and she gives
about the same milk as an Australian cow.

00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:49.400
But the Australian cow’s milk
can make you confused and mad

00:13:56.302 --> 00:14:01.400
because we have seen that the Australian cows,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.731
when they are in India, they don’t know
where they stand, they just run amok,

00:14:16.057 --> 00:14:18.892
so what must be their milk?

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:27.480
But an Indian cow, if she gets
realization through this vibrated water,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.480
she gives milk which is very good for the brain.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:48.958
So that is how we improve the
quality of our animals by Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:56.852 --> 00:15:00.229
Now regarding matter, we have to understand

00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:04.320
that matter is only good for giving it to others,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.480
but if it is given by a realized soul,

00:15:19.579 --> 00:15:22.079
it has tremendous effects.

00:15:25.979 --> 00:15:30.400
Before Gregoire wanted to write
his book, I gave him a fountain pen,

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:43.600
and he said, “I never
wrote a book,” and he started writing so well.

00:15:50.752 --> 00:15:54.440
Same with Rustom; he became a scholar.

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:02.880
So, Sahaja Yoga gives you

00:16:14.086 --> 00:16:17.250
an additional power

00:16:23.064 --> 00:16:28.288
by which you can neutralize
the bad effects of materialism.

00:16:34.478 --> 00:16:41.040
Now, say, supposing in India, in England,

00:16:41.545 --> 00:16:44.920
you have to offer drinks to people.

00:16:51.007 --> 00:16:54.320
So there are ten types of
glasses you have to have.

00:17:00.348 --> 00:17:02.996
Only one is sufficient

00:17:03.948 --> 00:17:07.760
to drink anything;
why to have ten? It’s a headache.

00:17:13.124 --> 00:17:17.582
Now if you have to use spoons and
forks, then you have all elaborations,

00:17:17.782 --> 00:17:21.480
and you can have a ten-place setting.

00:17:28.289 --> 00:17:31.920
But if you can use your
hands, they are very clean—

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.749
need not have so many elaborations.

00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:45.755
But these elaborations we
have not because we want them,

00:17:45.955 --> 00:17:50.280
but because of these
entrepreneurs – they force on us.

00:17:58.409 --> 00:18:01.658
But there is a deeper influence:

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:08.115
how people control you through matter.

00:18:12.218 --> 00:18:16.280
Now, supposing they go to somebody’s house,

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:26.629
and they find a kind of a spoon missing –
because there could be a spoon for avocado,

00:18:26.829 --> 00:18:29.720
say, a special spoon for avocado.

00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:38.435
Now if that spoon is not there, they will say,

00:18:38.635 --> 00:18:42.993
“Oh, these people have no sense,”

00:18:48.692 --> 00:18:53.040
and they will ask:
“Have you got a spoon for avocado?”

00:18:59.232 --> 00:19:03.048
So it is very shameless and it is very arrogant,

00:19:06.651 --> 00:19:09.486
to insult another person.

00:19:11.928 --> 00:19:17.016
A housewife, supposing you are a guest,

00:19:17.216 --> 00:19:21.200
she will be more worried about
her carpet than about her guests.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.920
And this kind of a thing can go too
far, and a person can become very dry.

00:19:41.016 --> 00:19:45.584
Such people are very disgusting

00:19:48.573 --> 00:19:53.283
and insulting type, an insulting.

00:19:57.535 --> 00:20:01.850
There is another way they
control you through matter,

00:20:05.957 --> 00:20:10.908
that they will say that

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:16.563
now you have to say, for a husband,

00:20:16.763 --> 00:20:21.160
“You must get me this,
otherwise I will be very angry.”

00:20:27.874 --> 00:20:32.560
If the husband breaks one
cup, the wife will be on his head,

00:20:39.592 --> 00:20:42.840
as if the cup is more important than the husband.

00:20:46.173 --> 00:20:50.487
She can get another husband,
she can also get another cup.

00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:59.520
See, the whole human dignity is reduced to matter,

00:21:05.275 --> 00:21:08.480
and this kind of controlling goes on.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.186
Children also control parents.

00:21:17.473 --> 00:21:23.360
They see on the television some
sort of a toy, and they ask the parents.

00:21:29.278 --> 00:21:33.121
Now if the parents don’t give
the toy, they will not eat their food.

00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:42.200
They’ll cry and weep and trouble the parents.

00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:48.920
So then the parents: “All right,
get them the toy, let them have it.”

00:21:51.869 --> 00:21:55.869
And the child plays with
the toy, not with the parents.

00:22:00.383 --> 00:22:05.706
Now two friends will meet, and they’ll
say, “We must go and see a film together.”

00:22:09.062 --> 00:22:13.320
They don’t talk to each other,
there’s no rapport, there’s no friendship.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.240
They must have something in between them.

00:22:23.097 --> 00:22:26.910
There is no direct rapport between
the children, between the friends,

00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:29.753
between husband and wife.

00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:39.360
Matter is to beautify your life,

00:22:42.317 --> 00:22:45.012
not to make it ugly

00:22:47.473 --> 00:22:50.600
and create problems between each other.

00:22:54.486 --> 00:22:57.636
Now the French will not like the English

00:22:57.837 --> 00:23:02.880
because they use their fork
and knives in a different way.

00:23:10.775 --> 00:23:14.041
And the English think no end of themselves

00:23:14.242 --> 00:23:17.275
because they know the English language.

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:29.360
All this kind of nonsensical feelings
come in through this kind of materialism,

00:23:36.083 --> 00:23:38.880
and we are no more collective,

00:23:40.759 --> 00:23:43.720
and the collectivity gets lost.

00:23:45.494 --> 00:23:51.053
But then we find out wrong
methods to get into collectivity.

00:23:57.821 --> 00:24:00.569
Like, we take to alcoholism,

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:06.285
because after alcohol we feel abandoned
and we can laugh and enjoy together.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:18.400
So, otherwise, if not, we go for holiday.

00:24:21.811 --> 00:24:24.680
All the women must show off their body

00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:29.920
to attract the attention of men.

00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:37.520
Men must show off their bodies
to attract the attention of women,

00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:43.891
but no one knows, no one

00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:50.976
– it’s a joyless pursuit.

00:24:54.403 --> 00:24:59.000
And the way they quarrel among
themselves for all these small, small things,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.871
they are really joy-killers.

00:25:09.014 --> 00:25:13.480
As a result of all these
things, we have lost the art,

00:25:14.765 --> 00:25:17.624
we have lost the art,

00:25:21.671 --> 00:25:26.765
we have lost the deftness, the deftness;

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:34.861
and now wherever you go, what you find ugly things

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:41.687
like the airport of Charles de Gaulle

00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:54.670
— it looks like a factory, and I don’t
know how you feel in that place.

00:25:58.733 --> 00:26:02.120
There is no cosiness in the household;

00:26:07.195 --> 00:26:11.040
the house is so bare and so insipid,

00:26:13.481 --> 00:26:16.527
and the people are so dry and stupid.

00:26:18.857 --> 00:26:23.116
There’s no joy in the family, so also
the children run away from the houses

00:26:23.316 --> 00:26:28.385
at the age of eighteen,
or sixteen, whatever may be the case.

00:26:34.158 --> 00:26:38.320
So instead of human beings,
we start creating robots, you see,

00:26:42.387 --> 00:26:45.000
controlled by entrepreneurs.

00:26:47.629 --> 00:26:52.076
This is the situation.
That’s why you play into the hands

00:26:52.276 --> 00:26:57.800
of all kinds of things like
psychologists, like Freud.

00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:08.880
Any new idea comes in, they jump at it,

00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:18.120
and that’s how they suffer – the
result is they have got AIDS now.

00:27:23.452 --> 00:27:26.600
There’s no logic in their heads.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:33.721
They don’t understand
that this is just exploitation.

00:27:36.461 --> 00:27:40.920
After Sahaja Yoga, you do
understand this is exploitation.

00:27:45.627 --> 00:27:49.040
Now they have plastics and nylons,

00:27:52.185 --> 00:27:57.960
and they don’t know what to do
with the plastic, how to get rid of it.

00:28:01.823 --> 00:28:06.360
Then they have acid rains, acid rains

00:28:10.177 --> 00:28:16.760
and the trees are affected by that.

00:28:24.018 --> 00:28:29.920
Now in Switzerland—which is
such a corrupt country, I should say,

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.920
it is taking the money, corrupt
money, from every country

00:28:41.078 --> 00:28:44.390
—who are absolute materialists

00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:50.080
are suffering from this acid rain.

00:28:54.604 --> 00:28:57.480
Most of their trees are destroyed

00:29:00.404 --> 00:29:07.036
and they have avalanches. All these
big, big mountains that they have,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:12.753
the ice starts flowing downward
because nobody can hold it,

00:29:18.897 --> 00:29:21.490
and now there are floods.

00:29:24.446 --> 00:29:28.079
The nature starts acting.

00:29:32.684 --> 00:29:38.680
So, whether they progress
outward in this wrong direction,

00:29:39.316 --> 00:29:45.960
or they try things inwards like Freudian methods

00:29:46.475 --> 00:29:49.120
– both are dangerous

00:30:01.296 --> 00:30:03.841
and are destructive,

00:30:05.048 --> 00:30:07.558
and in this destruction,

00:30:07.759 --> 00:30:12.634
who are lost are the people who are innocent.

00:30:19.634 --> 00:30:24.040
So, one has to develop that wisdom within oneself,

00:30:27.423 --> 00:30:33.120
that we are human beings here,
part and parcel of one whole,

00:30:40.804 --> 00:30:46.800
and only the human beings can get
Self-Realization and can feel that oneness.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.320
And such a personality is a satisfied personality.

00:31:02.786 --> 00:31:06.200
They do not try to exploit other countries,

00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:11.240
other people;

00:31:11.588 --> 00:31:14.088
they live satisfied with themselves.

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:20.920
They enjoy their compassion and their generosity.

00:31:23.713 --> 00:31:26.720
They open their houses to everyone,

00:31:29.146 --> 00:31:32.440
they open their hearts to everyone.

00:31:34.255 --> 00:31:38.535
They make their houses beautiful
for others, not for themselves.

00:31:43.879 --> 00:31:47.880
We were first in London in a country house,

00:31:50.311 --> 00:31:53.040
and there were six other houses;

00:31:55.311 --> 00:31:58.330
there were quite rich people living there.

00:32:01.142 --> 00:32:05.097
Every Saturday, Sunday, the
poor husband had to mow the lawn,

00:32:05.297 --> 00:32:10.320
and the wife would stand
up, telling him, “Do it better,”

00:32:18.207 --> 00:32:24.040
and used to polish all the brass, you see.

00:32:29.005 --> 00:32:31.505
Same with his wife.

00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:39.040
And not even a rat would enter that house.

00:32:42.365 --> 00:32:46.040
And they were surprised that in our house

00:32:51.286 --> 00:32:54.080
there were so many people coming.

00:32:56.061 --> 00:33:01.880
And they came and saw our house and
were surprised that our house was so beautiful

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.040
and so neat and clean.

00:33:12.427 --> 00:33:16.760
I told them that if you
really have a beautiful house,

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.600
even children don’t want to disturb it;

00:33:26.408 --> 00:33:29.560
they treat the house like a temple.

00:33:31.962 --> 00:33:38.440
But if you do not make the house
beautiful and acceptable to others,

00:33:43.795 --> 00:33:49.133
then you are only busy
cleaning for yourself all the brass,

00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:54.320
all the crystal, all the
glass, everything yourself.

00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:07.280
And what is the purpose?

00:34:08.299 --> 00:34:12.000
Then Monday you are
again tired, sitting very tired,

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:20.560
but if you had kept the doors open
to others, they would have enjoyed.

00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:28.251
Then it had some purpose.

00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:34.000
So purposeless life is absolutely joyless.

00:34:39.254 --> 00:34:45.600
That is the problem, is that people
get exhausted for nonsensical things.

00:34:53.245 --> 00:34:58.400
If one spoon is lost,
they will just die ten times.

00:35:04.279 --> 00:35:08.999
Thank God, in India, we are not
such materialists—yet, we might.

00:35:12.302 --> 00:35:15.800
We might become but can't say.

00:35:16.062 --> 00:35:21.520
but we have now a short circuit: we are
coming to Sahaja Yoga before we are developing.

00:35:28.805 --> 00:35:32.875
Now the culture is also very
different and is an ancient culture.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:43.013
That should be the culture of
Sahaja Yogis – will be that culture.

00:35:50.666 --> 00:35:56.080
Like, now, if somebody spills any coffee say,

00:35:56.655 --> 00:36:00.868
nobody will say anything—“Oh it’s all right,
it’s all right, no, no, no it doesn’t matter”

00:36:01.068 --> 00:36:03.720
—even if it’s a Persian carpet.

00:36:11.279 --> 00:36:14.960
Until the guest is in the
house, you will not wipe it.

00:36:19.419 --> 00:36:22.577
Even if children break
something, we don’t punish them,

00:36:22.777 --> 00:36:27.280
that: “You have broken this and it’s
very wrong, you have broken that.”

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.920
Nothing of the kind. “It’s all
right, you be careful” – that’s all.

00:36:36.698 --> 00:36:38.960
We don’t scold them for that,

00:36:42.432 --> 00:36:46.680
but we tell them that, “You
be careful, you might get hurt.”

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.150
No importance is given to things.

00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:58.800
Also, in language, we cannot
say to somebody: “I hate you.”

00:37:03.906 --> 00:37:06.560
That’s not allowed.

00:37:07.072 --> 00:37:10.000
Or “I don’t like you,”

00:37:11.473 --> 00:37:13.973
or “I believe in this.”

00:37:15.319 --> 00:37:17.819
They will say: “Who are you?

00:37:19.378 --> 00:37:21.880
What do you think of yourself?”

00:37:22.705 --> 00:37:25.480
The parents will immediately correct,

00:37:29.749 --> 00:37:33.765
and that is the correcting point
which helps throughout the life.

00:37:33.966 --> 00:37:38.600
You don’t say harsh things like:
“I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

00:37:47.026 --> 00:37:49.893
We have to appreciate everything:

00:37:53.115 --> 00:37:55.760
learn to appreciate other human beings,

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.670
to enjoy other people,

00:38:03.907 --> 00:38:06.407
to see to their good points.

00:38:08.584 --> 00:38:14.160
If you see only their bad points, you will
get all their bad points. Where is your attention?

00:38:20.485 --> 00:38:26.160
Instead of getting too many plastics,
you have one little nice thing with you.

00:38:32.422 --> 00:38:35.240
That is something joy-giving.

00:38:38.713 --> 00:38:41.360
Keep your houses open to others.

00:38:44.474 --> 00:38:47.800
Don’t get worried how your door is

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.835
– if somebody touches the door it
might spoil its polish or something like that.

00:38:59.016 --> 00:39:03.453
Enjoy looking after others,
having concern for them.

00:39:08.217 --> 00:39:13.800
They always say, “Mother, You look so
young despite Your age and You work so hard.”

00:39:20.093 --> 00:39:24.414
It is because I love everyone
much more than I care for Myself

00:39:30.082 --> 00:39:33.320
because I have so much concern for everyone.

00:39:35.785 --> 00:39:38.285
That keeps Me very happy.

00:39:40.195 --> 00:39:44.080
If I could give something to
others, that makes Me very happy.

00:39:48.358 --> 00:39:53.240
If I can cook for everyone, that’s very good.

00:39:57.846 --> 00:40:03.017
Only, I think, two years back, I went to

00:40:05.218 --> 00:40:07.595
– that’s about three years back

00:40:07.795 --> 00:40:13.101
– I went to Australia and cooked for
five hundred people in two places

00:40:18.947 --> 00:40:24.880
and enjoyed really seeing them enjoy My food.

00:40:27.978 --> 00:40:30.560
It was such a joy-giving thing.

00:40:32.798 --> 00:40:36.280
The greatest joy is in giving others.

00:40:39.366 --> 00:40:42.172
As soon as this attitude changes,

00:40:42.372 --> 00:40:47.402
you’ll be amazed the
materialism will be at your feet

00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:58.956
because in Sahaja Yoga it works that way.

00:41:02.253 --> 00:41:05.280
I’ll give you an example.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.263
Once I was going for a Guru Puja,

00:41:09.463 --> 00:41:14.854
and I wanted to take some
presents for all the leaders.

00:41:21.684 --> 00:41:28.045
In London, I don’t go out shopping, but I went
out, and I was exhausted. I couldn’t get anything,

00:41:33.776 --> 00:41:39.240
and I came in the evening very
tired and there was nothing I could find,

00:41:43.955 --> 00:41:50.160
and I thought that, I better now open My
storeroom and try to find out something there.

00:41:55.766 --> 00:42:02.000
And at that time, a Sahaja Yogi just said, “Mother
there’s some boy who wants to sell his paintings.”

00:42:09.582 --> 00:42:12.680
I just came rushing down,

00:42:15.044 --> 00:42:18.800
and he had beautiful paintings with him

00:42:20.875 --> 00:42:24.760
at a very reasonable price that I could afford,

00:42:28.335 --> 00:42:31.400
and they were exactly the number I wanted.

00:42:34.943 --> 00:42:41.080
So I bought them, and you know in one of the
Guru pujas I gave beautiful paintings to everyone.

00:42:48.412 --> 00:42:51.840
This time I had no time to buy any presents

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.320
for the leaders; I was going to France and here.

00:43:03.597 --> 00:43:07.400
I thought, I must have
something and now what to do?

00:43:12.115 --> 00:43:18.880
I have to take something for
Jose Antonio and also for Patrick.

00:43:23.223 --> 00:43:25.920
So, our plane was delayed,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.000
and I got beautiful
fountain pens for both of them.

00:43:37.825 --> 00:43:41.418
I was so very happy I could buy them there.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.550
It’s so nice, you see, to buy for others.

00:43:49.617 --> 00:43:52.840
I find it difficult to buy anything for Myself.

00:43:57.095 --> 00:44:03.840
It is so many times I have seen how
suddenly you get the things that you want,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.520
as the matter is at your feet.

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:19.662
I had bought some chocolates for the children

00:44:19.863 --> 00:44:26.400
for the puja in – not puja, but visit to Paris,

00:44:31.427 --> 00:44:36.160
and when they came in the
evening for music, we forgot about it.

00:44:41.875 --> 00:44:44.840
But at the airport we suddenly found them,

00:44:48.234 --> 00:44:53.360
so I gave all that to small
children and to big children also,

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.720
and we had a nice time at the airport.

00:45:02.576 --> 00:45:07.880
All these small, small things give
so much of joy, such an ocean of joy!

00:45:12.681 --> 00:45:15.410
You just try these things.

00:45:19.215 --> 00:45:22.360
In the beginning of Sahaj Yoga,

00:45:23.136 --> 00:45:28.805
I had gone for a program to meet
the Sahaja Yogis at Gavin’s place,

00:45:36.254 --> 00:45:38.386
At Gavin's place.

00:45:40.341 --> 00:45:44.358
and his wife was no good for
– she was cooking and all that,

00:45:44.558 --> 00:45:47.411
she was schizophrenic type,

00:45:52.177 --> 00:45:56.080
but Gavin said, “Mother, will you
please have Your dinner with us?”

00:46:00.397 --> 00:46:03.643
So I thought, he has cooked only for Me,

00:46:07.024 --> 00:46:10.720
so I allowed everybody to go away,

00:46:13.881 --> 00:46:16.480
and he was in the kitchen.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.643
He came out and said, “Mother, where are they?”

00:46:26.286 --> 00:46:29.080
I said, “Why? They have gone away.”

00:46:31.569 --> 00:46:35.120
He said, “See, Mother,
I have cooked for all of them,

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.820
and why did they go away?”

00:46:40.255 --> 00:46:46.733
You see, his sweetness filled my heart with joy;

00:46:52.511 --> 00:46:56.443
I felt what a sweet man he is.

00:46:59.603 --> 00:47:04.206
He’s from Scotland, and they say
that Scottish people are very miserly,

00:47:04.415 --> 00:47:08.200
but I found Gavin to be a very generous person.

00:47:15.493 --> 00:47:19.516
Like that, I like when the
Sahaja Yogis talk good of others,

00:47:19.716 --> 00:47:23.843
try to help them, and try
to be nice to each other.

00:47:24.043 --> 00:47:26.960
That is the most joy-giving thing.

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:38.299
All these things will cut out
the domination of matter upon us.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.920
We should not care for the matter.

00:47:48.291 --> 00:47:53.502
Of course, one should care for
something that is given to you with love.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:04.160
One day Gregoire had
given Me two little, little horses.

00:48:08.532 --> 00:48:11.640
Then I came home, I saw they were missing,

00:48:15.277 --> 00:48:19.800
and I went round the whole house seeing them:
“Where are they?” I said, “Where are they gone?”

00:48:22.273 --> 00:48:25.462
So I had My servants,
My domestics; they were surprised,

00:48:25.662 --> 00:48:30.360
that: “There are so many things in the house,
why is She worried about these two little horses?”

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.733
So, My husband came back in the evening.

00:48:40.933 --> 00:48:45.160
I said, “Have you seen those two little
horses that Gregoire had given Me?”

00:48:51.201 --> 00:48:57.359
“Yes, yes,” he said. “I have kept them properly
in my cupboard because children were there,

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.145
they would have broken and
You would have felt bad about them.”

00:49:06.523 --> 00:49:11.360
I had so much silver, so many
expensive things—he didn’t bother about that,

00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:19.640
because it had an expression of love in that,

00:49:23.683 --> 00:49:28.355
which is much more than all the
gold and all the silver put together.

00:49:34.235 --> 00:49:39.400
This is what we have to understand,
that love is more important than anything else.

00:49:44.084 --> 00:49:47.360
You must compete in loving each other more,

00:49:51.693 --> 00:49:55.600
compete in being kind to each other,

00:49:59.831 --> 00:50:03.472
and compete in being humbler to each other,

00:50:07.039 --> 00:50:12.400
compete in doing something for others,

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:21.000
and in saying very sweet things to others.

00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:30.240
Try to think of doing something very sweet.

00:50:34.876 --> 00:50:39.573
Like once I went to buy a
sari for Myself and then I found

00:50:39.774 --> 00:50:42.086
– you see, for Myself I am quite miserly;

00:50:42.287 --> 00:50:46.312
I thought it was rather
expensive and I didn’t buy it.

00:50:58.369 --> 00:51:02.051
And another Sahaja Yogi was there,

00:51:02.251 --> 00:51:06.458
with Me, I didn’t know, but he bought that sari,

00:51:12.127 --> 00:51:15.760
and the next day he brought it to Me as a present.

00:51:19.663 --> 00:51:22.360
You don’t know the joy I felt

00:51:24.255 --> 00:51:27.720
because I know I’m very miserly about Myself,

00:51:33.481 --> 00:51:37.800
and then that sari was so
much appreciated by everyone.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.680
Maybe it had that love.

00:51:48.234 --> 00:51:53.840
This is what it is: we
have to feel the power of love,

00:51:58.688 --> 00:52:02.120
then everything vibrates, the matter vibrates,

00:52:05.913 --> 00:52:10.155
and you can feel the vibrations from a distance.

00:52:14.579 --> 00:52:18.667
If you come and open My cupboard

00:52:18.868 --> 00:52:23.158
and try to arrange My saris,
you will be all filled with vibrations.

00:52:35.744 --> 00:52:38.920
Anything that you touch will have vibrations.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:48.720
So, it is important that we should
learn to love and improve our vibrations

00:52:54.599 --> 00:52:58.320
so that we can spread love all over

00:53:02.152 --> 00:53:08.080
and remove the people from
the shackles of materialism.

00:53:14.942 --> 00:53:21.080
I wanted to talk to people in Spain
about this, and for all the other people,

00:53:21.551 --> 00:53:26.418
I would say that they should come back

00:53:26.863 --> 00:53:29.766
because they have gone too far into it,

00:53:40.461 --> 00:53:43.040
because matter complicates you.

00:53:45.615 --> 00:53:48.400
It reacts and makes you think more.

00:53:51.701 --> 00:53:54.951
It doesn’t allow your
attention to be steady.

00:53:57.535 --> 00:54:01.800
If you see anything beautiful,
you just look at it without thinking,

00:54:06.891 --> 00:54:13.906
then you will realize
what beauty lies in the matter.

00:54:20.287 --> 00:54:23.840
In the Zen system of meditation,

00:54:24.164 --> 00:54:30.520
Vidhitama, the one who was
the founder of Zen system, tried it.

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:41.217
I think I’ve talked about it in some other lecture.

00:54:47.389 --> 00:54:53.560
With all My love to you, I
would say that try to love each other.

00:55:00.266 --> 00:55:05.425
And you have seen that, in India
when you travel, it’s not so comfortable

00:55:10.221 --> 00:55:14.512
and we cannot give that
comfort in the small places we go to,

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:22.640
but still, you all enjoy it so much.

00:55:26.987 --> 00:55:30.279
You don’t want comfort,
you want the comfort of love.

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:37.178
You enjoy each other’s company so much

00:55:39.248 --> 00:55:46.160
and that overflowing love of your
host country that is India, Indians.

00:55:52.422 --> 00:55:55.800
That is the sign of good Sahaja Yogis.

00:56:01.469 --> 00:56:04.360
Because there is a big purpose in our lives

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:11.090
– greatest of all.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:17.880
What Abraham Lincoln did,
or what Mahatma Gandhi did,

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.920
your work is much greater and subtler,

00:56:31.392 --> 00:56:33.960
because you can do living work.

00:56:36.642 --> 00:56:39.600
So, we don’t have to become sanyasis,

00:56:41.299 --> 00:56:43.799
we don’t have to give up anything,

00:56:45.866 --> 00:56:49.080
but we have to change our attitude.

00:56:51.951 --> 00:56:54.951
We have to develop that detachment.

00:56:57.415 --> 00:57:00.107
May God bless you all.
