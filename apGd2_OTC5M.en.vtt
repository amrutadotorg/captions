WEBVTT

23:56.830 --> 24:01.230
I’m sorry I had to speak in Hindi language,

24:01.260 --> 24:10.360
because most of the people who are here
are understanding Hindi only.

24:11.010 --> 24:16.970
When I am abroad, all the time
I am speaking English,

24:16.990 --> 24:19.960
nothing else but English language,

24:19.980 --> 24:25.780
and then I want to have some change
for a while.

24:25.810 --> 24:34.640
Regarding today’s great advent
of Shri Jesus Christ,

24:34.670 --> 24:39.740
I told them that He came on this world

24:40.530 --> 24:46.440
with a very great mission, I would say
one of the greatest missions,

24:46.460 --> 24:53.420
because He wanted to open the Agnya
Chakra

24:53.440 --> 24:59.010
which was so constricted, and could not
be done before.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.680
For that He had to sacrifice His life.

25:02.710 --> 25:11.120
By that sacrifice only, the great Agnya
could be opened.

25:11.760 --> 25:19.320
He was aware of it. He knew that it has
to happen,

25:19.350 --> 25:27.990
that He has to somehow accept this
sacrifice.

25:28.010 --> 25:32.150
As it is, He was a divine personality,

25:32.190 --> 25:38.910
He had no problem in doing so. But He
thought that

25:38.940 --> 25:50.070
could be some other way there, by which
you can open this Agnya Chakra.

25:50.100 --> 25:58.270
But He had to sacrifice His life, and
in that sacrifice He has shown

25:58.300 --> 26:07.260
that if you have to rise above this
mundane, superficial life,

26:07.280 --> 26:15.380
you have to in a way sacrifice.
Sacrifice what?

26:15.400 --> 26:22.620
Sacrifice all your six enemies. But
with the Kundalini awakening

26:22.640 --> 26:27.610
all these six enemies completely get
detached.

26:27.640 --> 26:36.350
Depends on how your Kundalini has risen.
If she has risen in a perfect manner,

26:36.370 --> 26:39.600
then I have seen people at the first shot

26:39.620 --> 26:44.560
they just become completely self-realized
people.

26:44.580 --> 26:47.940
Of course there are very few, but there
have been;

26:47.960 --> 26:54.430
while I see most of you have little
problems,

26:54.450 --> 27:00.550
and for most of you it is the problem
of the Agnya Chakra.

27:00.580 --> 27:05.170
How do we get the Agnya Chakra working
so much is this,

27:05.210 --> 27:13.190
that we think as a reaction, as a reaction

27:13.870 --> 27:19.100
to anything outside, we react to
everything.

27:19.120 --> 27:23.330
While I see here all these lamps, I can
react by saying,

27:23.360 --> 27:27.660
“From where did they get all these?
How much it must have cost?

27:27.680 --> 27:34.470
Where are they kept all the year round?”
- All kinds of things. I can react.

27:34.500 --> 27:43.870
This reaction comes from our conditionings,
or from our ego.

27:43.890 --> 27:49.870
Egoistical people are extremely sensitive.
If you give them, say,

27:49.890 --> 27:54.710
something that they think is not very
dignified, they can feel hurt.

27:54.740 --> 27:58.880
They can feel hurt for anything, because
they have a consciousness

27:58.900 --> 28:07.090
that they are something special, something
higher people, and one should behave

28:07.110 --> 28:12.080
with them when they are dealing with
anyone.

28:12.100 --> 28:15.990
And that’s how they get absolutely
disturbed

28:16.020 --> 28:21.740
if they find anybody in any way degrading
them.

28:22.350 --> 28:25.070
This comes from ego.

28:25.100 --> 28:31.140
Ego is a part and parcel of this Agnya
movement,

28:31.170 --> 28:34.560
and the second one is your conditioning.

28:34.580 --> 28:42.120
Now you have a conditioning: say you are
an Indian, now the conditioning is

28:42.150 --> 28:49.060
that a person who comes to meet you
should touch your feet, supposing,

28:49.080 --> 28:50.930
that’s your relationship.

28:50.950 --> 28:56.540
And the person doesn’t touch your feet,
then you are angry.

28:56.560 --> 29:00.750
Anything like that which is your
conditioning,

29:00.780 --> 29:05.230
gives you an idea that you are been
insulted

29:05.260 --> 29:12.280
or in any way you have not been
respected, then you feel bad.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.380
The other reactions of ego are like this,

29:15.400 --> 29:21.110
as I said: I see those lamps and I can say,
“Why not I have it?”

29:21.130 --> 29:24.520
Or if I have them, “Why will I give it
to anyone?”

29:24.540 --> 29:29.680
Ego reactions are there, or conditioning
reactions are there.

29:29.700 --> 29:33.510
These two were to be finished, and that
was done

29:33.530 --> 29:40.240
by the sacrifice of the life of Christ.
Christ Himself was a divine person,

29:40.270 --> 29:48.460
and a divine person is like the sea because
it remains at the zero point,

29:48.490 --> 29:53.850
at the lowest point; it does all work
from that point.

29:53.890 --> 30:02.330
It will make clouds, it will make rain,
and when all the rivers are in spate

30:02.360 --> 30:09.270
they’ll run into the sea, because the sea
remains at the lower point.

30:09.300 --> 30:16.870
So humility is the, one of the criteria
of a Sahaja yoga.

30:16.900 --> 30:22.400
A person who doesn’t have humility
cannot be called sahaja yogi.

30:22.430 --> 30:26.180
I have seen even sahaja yogis get very
angry,

30:26.210 --> 30:30.510
sometimes start shouting and getting angry
and misbehaving.

30:30.540 --> 30:35.700
That’s the sign that he is not yet a sahaja
yogi, he has to still mature.

30:35.730 --> 30:46.410
So this humility of a person will give you
more stationary, I would say,

30:46.430 --> 30:56.020
more permanent state by which you will
not react,

30:56.040 --> 31:00.820
you will not react. You look at anything,
you react.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.450
But then you don’t react, you just watch,

31:03.480 --> 31:08.720
and that is how the new state of witness
state comes into you.

31:08.740 --> 31:13.380
When you become the witness you are
just watching,

31:13.410 --> 31:22.470
just watching; not reacting, not thinking
about it, but you are in the present,

31:22.500 --> 31:28.990
and in the present you just watch, watch
and really enjoy it.

31:29.020 --> 31:37.450
The enjoyment of all the creation is not
within your mind when you are thinking.

31:37.480 --> 31:45.500
And when you are not thinking, the whole
enjoyment of the beauty of all this creation

31:45.520 --> 31:51.270
reflects in you, and gives you tremendous
joy and peace.

31:51.290 --> 31:56.920
So one has to learn that we should not
react.

31:56.940 --> 32:02.510
The today’s problem is, all human beings
are very good at reacting.

32:02.530 --> 32:06.900
Reaction is a basic principle of today’s
life.

32:06.920 --> 32:12.910
You see any newspaper, you see any book,
you meet anyone,

32:12.930 --> 32:18.030
what I find that they are experts
on reacting. They react,

32:18.050 --> 32:28.250
and by reaction what happens, they never
achieve any essence of the thing.

32:28.280 --> 32:34.740
Essence is only through witness state
that you can achieve.

32:34.770 --> 32:42.000
This is what we have to learn from
the crucifixion of Christ,

32:42.020 --> 32:49.830
from His birth, that He was born in a very
humble family,

32:50.070 --> 33:00.150
very poor family, in very adverse
conditions.

33:00.170 --> 33:06.940
The reason was to show that all these
outward things

33:06.960 --> 33:13.170
and all these outward glories do not
make you great.

33:13.190 --> 33:18.500
The greatness is within, and when
that greatness is there

33:18.520 --> 33:25.440
then you don’t care for anything, because
you are so much enriched within yourself

33:25.460 --> 33:32.200
that you don’t bother about other things,
you don’t think about these things,

33:32.230 --> 33:37.320
and you live in your own majestic life.

33:37.350 --> 33:43.400
This is what we see in His life, He was
a very majestic person.

33:43.430 --> 33:48.760
Otherwise if you meet somebody
who is a poor man, say,

33:48.780 --> 33:56.820
and who has felt the poverty, he’ll talk
to you with a beggarish style.

33:56.850 --> 34:02.410
If there’s somebody who is born in a rich
family, he will talk to you

34:02.430 --> 34:11.010
in a very, I should say, outward, outwardly
showing-off nature.

34:11.030 --> 34:18.060
But a person who is a divine person,
all these things don’t touch.

34:18.080 --> 34:24.830
For him riches or not riches, positions
or no power

34:24.850 --> 34:29.340
is all just the same; and when that
happens,

34:29.360 --> 34:35.000
then you should consider that you have
become sahaja yogis.

34:35.180 --> 34:41.010
I’ve seen people who come to Ganapatipule
- now they are very much changed.

34:41.040 --> 34:46.070
Otherwise in the beginning they used
to say, “We don’t have water,

34:46.100 --> 34:53.580
we don’t have this facility, it’s very cold
or hot” - whatever it is.

34:53.600 --> 34:59.030
They were all the time talking as if they
are on a holiday.

34:59.060 --> 35:02.730
It is something very different.

35:02.750 --> 35:08.200
You are here to develop your witness state.

35:08.220 --> 35:12.370
Did you see the sky, how beautiful it was,

35:12.390 --> 35:17.520
how orange, blue, all kinds of colors
were there.

35:17.540 --> 35:26.480
The color it takes automatically,
and is enjoying it. It is not bothered

35:26.500 --> 35:32.100
that it should remain forever, that this
will go away when there is darkness.

35:32.130 --> 35:37.220
Just watching, the sky is just watching.

35:37.250 --> 35:45.870
Whatever comes its way, it takes it. So
it’s so beautiful and it’s so joy-giving.

35:45.900 --> 35:57.510
So the another thing is that when you
are in that state of spirituality,

35:57.540 --> 36:03.240
then you are joy-giving, you are
peace-giving,

36:03.260 --> 36:08.580
you are compassionate, and you love
each other.

36:08.610 --> 36:14.200
All these problems of the ego just
disappear.

36:14.230 --> 36:18.630
Ego is your greatest enemy, I think,

36:18.650 --> 36:28.460
and it is the one that really hinders
all the wealth and beauty of your life.

36:28.480 --> 36:37.540
So if you could just see this ego, how it
works, just you’ll be enjoying it.

36:37.570 --> 36:41.780
It’s a drama it plays - all right,
let’s have it!

36:41.810 --> 36:46.330
You can see the drama and then suddenly
you will be amazed

36:46.360 --> 36:50.200
that you are not in it, you are
watching it.

36:50.220 --> 36:59.040
When you are detached from your ego,
you can see how it tries to entice you.

36:59.470 --> 37:05.520
These are the problems of today, and
that’s why we need Jesus very much.

37:05.540 --> 37:11.180
The problem of today is that people
don’t understand

37:11.200 --> 37:16.950
that how much harm they are doing
to themselves, to others,

37:16.980 --> 37:22.410
and to the whole world by becoming
egoistical.

37:22.430 --> 37:27.390
If they could understand, I tell you,
they would give up.

37:27.410 --> 37:35.150
But the problem is they enjoy their hatred
they enjoy that kind of meanness

37:35.170 --> 37:41.340
or I would say, very low-level living.
While you are all sahaja yogis,

37:41.360 --> 37:48.010
and what you have to do is to understand,
“Why this ego is coming in my head?

37:48.040 --> 37:50.630
What have I done? Who am I?”

37:50.660 --> 37:56.540
Once you go on asking such questions
this ego will disappear.

37:56.570 --> 38:02.520
And it’s a big problem for Me also to deal
with people who have ego,

38:02.550 --> 38:07.500
because I can’t tell them “You have got
ego.” If I tell them, they’ll all run away.

38:07.530 --> 38:12.060
If I tell them, “All right, you are very
good, you are very nice,”

38:12.080 --> 38:18.330
then ego will be bloated. Then they’ll say,
“Oh, Mother told us I’m very nice.”

38:18.360 --> 38:24.730
It’s very problematic. I don’t know how
to deal with the ego of human beings.

38:24.750 --> 38:28.970
I know they have, but I don’t know how
to deal with it.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.790
I think it’s only you can deal with it, if
you will understand what’s wrong with you.

38:34.820 --> 38:41.100
That’s a very good way of solving your
problem, and My problem also.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.580
My vision is too great, I think,
for one life.

38:44.600 --> 38:49.250
I want a global realization, I want people
all over the world

38:49.270 --> 38:55.360
to have realization. It’s very
remarkable how ....

39:10.520 --> 39:26.250
In Sahaj culture we have a proper training
for getting rid of ego.

39:26.280 --> 39:34.400
You can yourself introspect yourself.

39:34.870 --> 39:42.290
You can yourself see why you behave
like this.

39:42.320 --> 39:48.880
The introspection that sahaja yogis can
do cannot be done by other people,

39:48.910 --> 39:53.970
because they can enter into themselves,
they can see for themselves,

39:53.990 --> 40:01.560
they can watch others. And with that
they can just try to see

40:01.580 --> 40:07.340
what is this Mr Ego doing within
your head.

40:07.550 --> 40:12.980
Of course, we know that the mantra
of Christ is the best

40:13.000 --> 40:19.750
for removing all egoistical problems,
and that helps a lot.

40:19.770 --> 40:24.710
But also when you are doing this mantra,
you should be yourself

40:24.730 --> 40:31.720
in a very humble state. “What am I,
after all, who am I?

40:31.740 --> 40:38.680
Look at so many stars, look at so many
beautiful things, and who am I?

40:38.700 --> 40:43.390
What have I done? Why should I be
so egoistical?

40:43.420 --> 40:46.480
Why should I think I’m something great?”

40:46.510 --> 40:52.410
And also other people pamper you, because
they want to take advantage of you.

40:52.440 --> 40:56.780
So they’ll pamper you, they’ll say “This is
very great, you are very great”;

40:56.800 --> 41:01.270
and you just get enamored, get lost.

41:01.300 --> 41:08.920
You are like thrown into the torrential
rain

41:08.940 --> 41:17.120
and you flood out into big, I think, like
a big stream of egoistical people.

41:17.150 --> 41:22.140
And if you see around today in these
modern times,

41:22.170 --> 41:28.800
everybody is quite conscious of their ego,
very conscious,

41:28.830 --> 41:33.250
and the way they are coming up
in the newspapers

41:33.270 --> 41:38.650
or the way they are in some magazines,
I’m quite amazed.

41:38.670 --> 41:43.700
I would feel shy to be there, because
it’s so much

41:43.730 --> 41:52.150
of expression of your ego, nothing else.
All kinds of things they start,

41:52.180 --> 41:55.750
they have competitions of ego,
lots of competitions.

41:55.780 --> 42:02.060
Like they have a beauty competition, then
they have another competition

42:02.090 --> 42:08.840
for Mister, you can say India, Mister this
thing, that.

42:08.870 --> 42:14.500
All these things actually give the person
ego,

42:14.520 --> 42:18.910
and others also run after such
competitions.

42:18.940 --> 42:22.280
They think, “Why am I not? I should be
like that.”

42:22.310 --> 42:27.240
So it’s very deadening and absolutely
blinds your mind,

42:27.270 --> 42:32.960
that you think this is the way one has
to be very successful.

42:32.990 --> 42:38.670
This success lasts for how long?
It perishes in no time.

42:38.700 --> 42:44.170
But success in Sahaja Yoga is what will
last forever,

42:44.200 --> 42:48.630
and everybody will remember it.

42:48.650 --> 42:55.220
The one who has this kind of a humble
nature

42:55.240 --> 42:59.530
will be remembered for generations.

42:59.560 --> 43:08.150
I’ve never seen a statue of a person
who has been egoistical.

43:08.180 --> 43:11.990
On the contrary, if there was some
they used to criticize,

43:12.020 --> 43:17.340
“He was a very egoistical man.”
And nowadays it’s impossible,

43:17.360 --> 43:20.730
anybody who has ego, I don’t think
anybody

43:20.750 --> 43:24.520
is going to sing any songs about
such a person

43:24.550 --> 43:28.450
or going to raise any statues in their
name.

43:28.470 --> 43:34.380
So in the heart of hearts we like humble
people,

43:34.410 --> 43:40.770
and if we want others to like us, we should
be also very humble.

43:40.790 --> 43:45.030
Not artificially, but really,
by understanding

43:45.050 --> 43:47.740
that: “What are we? Why should we
proud,

43:47.760 --> 43:53.870
why should we try to overpower others
and trouble others?”.

43:53.900 --> 43:58.260
If you understand that, you have done
full justification

43:58.280 --> 44:02.730
to the incarnation of Jesus Christ
the great.

44:02.750 --> 44:08.220
And there are so many qualities He has
shown. But the, for us the best is

44:08.250 --> 44:16.750
His passing through the ego sacrificing
His life is the greatest message,

44:16.780 --> 44:19.740
and for that we have to understand.

44:19.770 --> 44:24.780
But those who call themselves are
the most egoistical. I was surprised

44:24.800 --> 44:29.210
that England, English people are
extremely egoistical.

44:29.240 --> 44:34.600
Or otherwise other countries also I’ve seen
in the West, they are very egoistical.

44:34.620 --> 44:38.190
They’ve no humility at all, compared
to Indians,

44:38.210 --> 44:43.860
they are very, very egoistical people.
Why? Because they are following Christ,

44:43.890 --> 44:48.200
can you imagine! Is this the way
we follow Christ?

44:48.220 --> 44:53.090
Those who call themselves Christians
and those who call themselves

44:53.120 --> 44:57.280
very great admirers of Christ should
show in their life

44:57.310 --> 45:03.540
that humility, that compassion, that love.
It is not so.

45:03.560 --> 45:07.890
So specially for people who are from
Western countries,

45:07.910 --> 45:10.940
you must try to learn Sahaj culture.

45:10.960 --> 45:15.610
In the Sahaj culture, how do we talk,
how do we live,

45:15.630 --> 45:22.360
how do we contact, is something very
different. And then once you start

45:22.390 --> 45:28.810
Sahaj culture in your life, you’ll be
amazed, others will be amazed

45:28.830 --> 45:33.250
how you are having a rapport
with each other,

45:33.280 --> 45:38.480
how you are looking after everything
so well.

45:38.510 --> 45:42.900
This is the best way to live in this world
as sahaja yogis,

45:42.930 --> 45:47.460
where there is no ego, there is
no conditioning, nothing.

45:47.490 --> 45:55.750
You are just absolutely free from all
these horrible attributes.

45:55.780 --> 46:03.010
And then you will be amazed how people
will trust you, how they will like you.

46:03.450 --> 46:08.400
I wish you all a very Happy Christmas.

46:15.980 --> 46:20.620
And also remember the message of Christ
and His life.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.650
May God bless you.
