00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:10.836
Today we have assembled in the area of Vishuddhi.

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:26.861
In the Gita, Shri Krishna has described

00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:29.966
the area as Kshetra,

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:40.617
and the one who knows the area is called as Kshetragna.

00:00:40.818 --> 00:00:43.720
Gna, yesterday as I told you, gna or gya, means:

00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:48.627
"The one to know on your central nervous system".

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:57.401
So the one who is the knower of that area is the Kshetragna.

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:07.268
Today we are going to know about the Hamsa Chakra.

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:22.328
That is the area of, between the two eyebrows,

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:25.933
[SOUNDS LIKE 'RUKUTIS'], they have called it.

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:42.855
This one is placed at the base of the brain,

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:50.919
which is called as Mooldar,

00:01:53.809 --> 00:02:04.457
and this part is the complete controller

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:06.687
of the whole of the base of the brain,

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:10.888
again I say, base of the brain.

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:16.776
And that is a part of the Visshuddhi still,

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:26.565
which is an extremely important center

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:31.519
as far as the human awareness is concerned,

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:43.897
because these two nadis, Ida and Pingala,

00:02:45.613 --> 00:03:01.048
before entering into Agnya and giving, crossing each other,

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:17.048
part of them crosses over this Chakra of Hamsa.

00:03:21.807 --> 00:03:34.881
So when the ego and superego develop in our brain

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:41.191
and cover our limbic area,

00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:44.563
from both the sides the strands

00:03:44.764 --> 00:03:56.633
which are coming out of the Visshuddhi sit on them.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:04:11.185
So they also control these two institutions from outside.

00:04:11.386 --> 00:04:14.586
For example, it crosses like this,

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:24.371
goes up like that from Hamsa, and then some strands.

00:04:24.572 --> 00:04:29.149
Then the others go up again and cross like this,

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.564
and form ego and superego.

00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:42.167
So from the back side, on top of them,

00:04:42.368 --> 00:04:46.280
these two strands go and sit.

00:04:49.638 --> 00:04:56.826
You all know that Hamsa Chakra gives you discretion,

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:59.308
but still we do not understand,

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.011
what do we mean by discretion?

00:05:10.305 --> 00:05:14.206
The first and the foremost important center within us

00:05:14.407 --> 00:05:17.434
is the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:05:23.012 --> 00:05:28.550
If we do not have the proper

00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:33.052
discretion about Mooladhara Chakra,

00:05:35.584 --> 00:05:43.499
we get into wilderness, I should say,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.814
or we open the doors of hell for ourselves.

00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:58.837
As you know, that only the Ida Nadi

00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:03.720
starts from the Mooladhara.

00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:13.979
That means, it's the desire,

00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:22.619
power of desire within us, starts from Mooladhara.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:31.982
But it's not the mental, which is the Pingala Nadi,

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:37.643
which starts from Mooladhara. It starts higher.

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:49.024
So to have a complete understanding about..

00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:51.815
The child is crying, please take away the child.

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:56.228
Yesterday, again the same thing happened, this is indiscreet.

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:59.633
Continuing with the child all the time, yesterday was the same thing.

00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:03.371
Immediately you should take out the child.

00:07:03.572 --> 00:07:06.887
In the meeting, if the child is crying, immediately take out the child.

00:07:07.088 --> 00:07:12.548
There is something wrong with the child, immediately take out the child.

00:07:14.564 --> 00:07:19.794
Again it's indiscreetion.

00:07:22.117 --> 00:07:27.424
So one thing one has to know, that

00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:30.833
Mooladhara Chakra cannot be controlled

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:34.240
by our mental activity.

00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:45.582
But if you shift it to the mental activity

00:07:45.783 --> 00:07:55.680
then the control over Mooladhara is completely lost.

00:07:55.881 --> 00:08:00.484
Apart from whatever has happened in the West,

00:08:02.143 --> 00:08:05.738
Mooladhara Chakra is all gone

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:10.454
into the mental activity of human beings.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.935
It is so much discussed, talked.

00:08:16.136 --> 00:08:21.164
It is so much described, written down,

00:08:21.365 --> 00:08:28.878
so much read, so much put into our heads,

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:34.600
that it has become a mental activity.

00:08:34.801 --> 00:08:38.148
So, Mooladhara doesn't act

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:42.084
spontaneously as it has to act.

00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:47.274
That's why there are problems

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:54.222
that people cannot produce children.

00:08:54.423 --> 00:08:58.825
So many become impotent very early

00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:12.274
because it is used not by the power of desire,

00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:17.197
but by mental activity - a shift.

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:22.954
Now you see the light here, is burning there

00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:30.216
because there is oil and there is a wick, it is burning.

00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:34.417
But instead of this oil, you put just water.

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:38.153
Will it burn? It won't.

00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:47.742
Because water is not going to nourish this light.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.510
So, the more mental activity you have,

00:09:57.504 --> 00:10:05.504
your Mooladhara gets spoilt and it becomes uncontrollable.

00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:13.295
But if it is left to your desire,

00:10:15.733 --> 00:10:19.177
so it becomes spontaneous.

00:10:28.502 --> 00:10:32.621
This is a fundamental principle that is missing

00:10:32.822 --> 00:10:36.822
in the Western thinking, I think

00:10:37.052 --> 00:10:39.795
that whatever is spontaneous,

00:10:39.996 --> 00:10:44.048
they leave it to the mental activity.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.666
Wherever the mental activity is to be used,

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:55.812
you should use mental activity and wherever

00:10:56.013 --> 00:10:59.931
your desire and emotions are to be used,

00:11:00.132 --> 00:11:05.727
you must use your desire power.

00:11:11.577 --> 00:11:17.654
Also, it is spontaneous,

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:18.855
though it should not be an obsession.

00:11:21.876 --> 00:11:28.220
Any obsession cannot be spontaneous.

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:35.776
It's just, at a moment, you have the desire. That's all.

00:11:35.977 --> 00:11:39.935
But all the time if there sits in your mind,

00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:46.826
that means you are using water to have the fire.

00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:55.149
Same about the Swadisthana Chakra.

00:11:57.324 --> 00:12:02.561
Swadisthana is for creativity. Anything you can create.

00:12:02.762 --> 00:12:04.196
You can create a sari.

00:12:04.397 --> 00:12:07.124
You can create a beautiful design, pattern.

00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:11.648
You can create a beautiful art of anything,

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:17.515
but as soon as you put it on a mental level, it's finished.

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:28.027
Also in the West, too much discussion is about the art.

00:12:28.228 --> 00:12:30.053
This is not art, that is not art.

00:12:30.254 --> 00:12:32.815
This should not be like this, that should not be like this.

00:12:33.055 --> 00:12:35.704
I mean, it's creativity, spontaneous.

00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:38.460
Whatever the artist wants to produce,

00:12:38.661 --> 00:12:45.912
let him produce, and who are you to judge and criticize?

00:12:46.113 --> 00:12:47.547
You cannot appreciate anything

00:12:47.748 --> 00:12:51.462
unless and until it is brought to the mental level.

00:12:52.359 --> 00:12:57.462
So now, we have critics,

00:12:58.818 --> 00:13:01.413
and the artists are not spontaneous,

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:03.064
they're afraid; they only think:

00:13:03.265 --> 00:13:06.050
"What will the critics say?"

00:13:07.598 --> 00:13:10.693
Even when I'm writing the book,

00:13:10.894 --> 00:13:13.399
when I give it to some Sahaja Yogis to read, they say:

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.862
"Mother, if You write it like this, then they'll say like this."

00:13:17.063 --> 00:13:20.603
I said: "Let them say, who cares?"

00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:27.368
So then, critics should criticize

00:13:28.964 --> 00:13:31.144
and say: "This is not all right. This is not an art

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:33.652
because this is such, this is such".

00:13:33.853 --> 00:13:37.855
So the artists are finishing, art is finishing.

00:13:38.056 --> 00:13:40.720
Now what is left are critics.

00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:43.093
So now they don't know what to do with their profession,

00:13:43.294 --> 00:13:45.077
so they are criticizing each other.

00:13:45.278 --> 00:13:49.597
So we have only critics criticizing each other.

00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:53.551
But there's no art now. What to criticize?

00:13:56.439 --> 00:14:02.044
And art has to be now made into money.

00:14:02.245 --> 00:14:05.917
So the critics must certify.

00:14:06.118 --> 00:14:11.909
It's so man-oriented, the whole programming of these critics is,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.886
that it is never an art. You know, they draw one line

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:16.939
and say: "Now this is art, all right".

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.526
If the critics say that it's art you had better accept,

00:14:19.735 --> 00:14:23.706
it is an art. Now, what is so artistic about a line?

00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:30.489
Then again mental: "It's a lonely person standing there" this, that.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:35.247
It should be spontaneous! Why to describe an art?

00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:42.568
So the mental level is so alert

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:46.183
and is all the time trying to see things

00:14:46.384 --> 00:14:49.725
according to certain norms.

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:53.525
All these norms are created about something

00:14:53.726 --> 00:15:06.007
so spontaneous like sex, like art.

00:15:06.208 --> 00:15:11.620
All bathroom culture is decided by the brain.

00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:19.815
Nothing is spontaneous. It's such a joke, I tell you!

00:15:23.017 --> 00:15:29.428
So people become artificial. Art becomes artificial.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.261
Your Mooladhara becomes artificial.

00:15:37.462 --> 00:15:41.168
Because it's all now man-made.

00:15:45.184 --> 00:15:48.707
All the spontaneity is lost.

00:15:50.025 --> 00:15:54.765
If you see any art from any country, just watch.

00:15:54.966 --> 00:15:59.839
Why must you react to it? Just watch, as Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:03.128
You should just watch

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:06.860
and the whole thing will start flowing through.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.287
Now this Greek tragedy of romanticism,

00:16:14.488 --> 00:16:18.470
then the romance of Romeo and Juliet,

00:16:18.671 --> 00:16:23.226
all is imaginary, is all mental.

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:27.478
There's no spontaneity in it.

00:16:30.002 --> 00:16:35.407
And then you accept, accept only relationships

00:16:35.608 --> 00:16:38.931
when there is artificiality

00:16:39.132 --> 00:16:41.945
even between husband and wife.

00:16:42.146 --> 00:16:46.304
Like the husband must bring a flower every day to the wife,

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:51.933
show her a flower, as if she's a priest or something.

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:56.275
And the wife must - I don't know

00:16:56.476 --> 00:16:59.610
what they do all artificialities.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.990
And then he must say "Thank you" ten times to her,

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:11.254
and she must say "Sorry" to him a hundred times.

00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:14.704
I mean they're husband and wife,

00:17:14.905 --> 00:17:18.236
left and right side of a chariot!

00:17:21.413 --> 00:17:25.888
And then the men expect this should happen.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.269
Women expect this should happen.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:33.787
Men expect the women should be like men,

00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:39.681
and women expect women, men should be like women.

00:17:41.723 --> 00:17:46.347
Men are very particular about time, women are not.

00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:48.736
So women must be very particular about time,

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:51.710
otherwise they think she is the worst person

00:17:51.911 --> 00:17:55.109
they have ever known.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.720
The woman is, say, more particular about her kitchen

00:17:59.921 --> 00:18:02.919
or maybe about her dress.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.787
So the man would get angry with her

00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:13.192
because she takes too much time to get ready.

00:18:13.393 --> 00:18:18.234
It's mutually so indiscreet

00:18:18.435 --> 00:18:23.244
that the relationship becomes absolutely absurd.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.560
There should be understanding that she is the left side

00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:32.139
and you are the right side,

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:38.377
and both of you have to act according to your nature.

00:18:38.578 --> 00:18:41.202
On the contrary,

00:18:41.403 --> 00:18:44.821
you want to make somebody look so funny,

00:18:45.022 --> 00:18:47.664
because imagine a man becoming a woman

00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:52.679
and a woman becoming a man. You see it's a joke,

00:18:52.896 --> 00:18:55.285
but that's what has happened.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:00.729
Whatever the men are supposed to do they cannot do

00:19:00.968 --> 00:19:04.632
and whatever women are supposed to do they cannot do.

00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:07.823
Whatever the children are supposed to do they do not do.

00:19:08.024 --> 00:19:13.174
For example, children in the West will go on asking: "Why?"

00:19:14.786 --> 00:19:17.196
Who are they to ask "Why?" What is their growth?

00:19:17.397 --> 00:19:21.037
What is their intelligence? What is their maturity?

00:19:21.238 --> 00:19:26.910
They cannot be treated like a judge sitting in the court.

00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:29.023
They are children!

00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:36.152
But when they come to Sahaja Yoga

00:19:38.267 --> 00:19:40.134
they lose their discretion.

00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:43.899
First, before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:50.385
the husband and wife quarrel all the time.

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:57.756
Half steps are in the courts and half outside.

00:19:58.574 --> 00:20:01.699
After Sahaja Yoga they cling to each other,

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.270
so much like glued together, it's impossible.

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:08.103
So much so that for the wife's sake

00:20:08.304 --> 00:20:10.216
they will leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:14.126 --> 00:20:18.126
They'll ruin each other like that. They're glued together.

00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:23.354
Before Sahaja Yoga they neglect their children, don't bother.

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:27.013
After Sahaja Yoga they're glued to their children.

00:20:27.214 --> 00:20:29.735
Then nobody can say a word against the child.

00:20:29.936 --> 00:20:33.602
The child can go and hit anyone, you cannot say anything.

00:20:36.579 --> 00:20:39.441
They'll ruin the child.

00:20:39.642 --> 00:20:43.664
So the discretion is lost completely in relationships,

00:20:43.865 --> 00:20:47.494
whether it is sex, whether it is creativity,

00:20:47.695 --> 00:20:52.228
whether it is family, anything.

00:20:59.443 --> 00:21:02.109
That's the part of the Hamsa Chakra.

00:21:03.276 --> 00:21:06.435
Then we come to the Nabhi Chakra.

00:21:09.074 --> 00:21:12.686
In Nabhi Chakra also we do not understand

00:21:12.887 --> 00:21:18.220
that eating is not such an important thing.

00:21:22.129 --> 00:21:26.398
Doesn't matter if you don't eat your food today,

00:21:26.599 --> 00:21:28.400
what does it matter?

00:21:32.289 --> 00:21:34.656
It's very important, you know!

00:21:34.857 --> 00:21:38.698
In Pune we had a Puja,

00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:44.481
and we had Western children sitting there in the Puja,

00:21:44.682 --> 00:21:47.092
and there were Indian children also.

00:21:47.293 --> 00:21:51.346
As usual Puja is always late,

00:21:51.547 --> 00:21:55.417
but it was in the evening, Sankrant Puja.

00:21:55.618 --> 00:21:58.996
So the children, Western children, got up at eight o'clock,

00:21:59.197 --> 00:22:00.719
whether it was Puja or anything,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.941
and all marched out for their dinner.

00:22:05.142 --> 00:22:08.687
It looked very bad. Indians couldn't understand,

00:22:08.888 --> 00:22:10.784
how can that be?

00:22:15.006 --> 00:22:18.465
But they had to have their dinner at eight.

00:22:21.347 --> 00:22:23.619
Supposing they don't eat their food at eight o'clock,

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.970
what will happen, will they die?

00:22:31.128 --> 00:22:35.964
So in a way, we restrict children also

00:22:37.702 --> 00:22:40.614
by our own conditionings,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:50.523
and also we allow them to behave in a manner

00:22:50.732 --> 00:22:58.675
that they, as if they are very grown up, matured people.

00:22:58.876 --> 00:23:01.436
We are so enamored by our children,

00:23:01.637 --> 00:23:03.404
as if to get children is something great.

00:23:03.605 --> 00:23:06.510
Anybody can have children, what's so great about it?

00:23:11.105 --> 00:23:14.792
You have to look after your children. It's all right.

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:18.006
But it doesn't mean that you should all the time

00:23:18.207 --> 00:23:20.883
dote upon them, think about them,

00:23:21.084 --> 00:23:25.814
worry about them, and nobody else.

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:38.522
So, if you have to enter into the limbic area

00:23:38.723 --> 00:23:41.780
which is the Virata's place, which is the,

00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:44.875
I would say, from Visshuddhi to Hamsa

00:23:45.076 --> 00:23:53.173
and then to your limbic area, into the Virata,

00:23:55.006 --> 00:23:59.868
then your interest must expand.

00:24:00.069 --> 00:24:02.106
So the other discretion should be that:

00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:04.660
"Am I only thinking of my child?

00:24:04.861 --> 00:24:08.715
Am I only thinking of my wife?

00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:10.525
Am I only thinking about them,

00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:14.838
or I am worried about others' children also?

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:18.329
I'm thinking about others' children?"

00:24:22.098 --> 00:24:26.119
I just tell you this because it's such a

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.986
funny type of a concern we have,

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:38.323
and you destroy your children also, by

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.366
this kind of a indiscreet concern.

00:24:49.859 --> 00:24:56.628
Like we had a school in India,

00:24:59.586 --> 00:25:05.354
and the children stayed in Pune. I had My Puja.

00:25:05.555 --> 00:25:06.981
I told them: "Don't bring children",

00:25:07.182 --> 00:25:09.648
because I knew these children are Western children,

00:25:09.849 --> 00:25:13.629
not easy, they can't bear anything.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.575
But the children insisted,

00:25:15.776 --> 00:25:19.512
and the teachers had to bring them.

00:25:19.713 --> 00:25:22.581
So the Puja was over as usual, very late,

00:25:22.782 --> 00:25:25.835
about I think eleven o'clock in the night,

00:25:26.036 --> 00:25:28.088
and there was no transport,

00:25:28.289 --> 00:25:30.454
and that's why I said: "Don't bring them."

00:25:30.655 --> 00:25:33.411
So they had to get some sort of a truck,

00:25:33.612 --> 00:25:35.752
because these days we were not getting petrol,

00:25:35.953 --> 00:25:38.697
we had been having a very bad time.

00:25:38.898 --> 00:25:43.681
So they had to go on the truck.

00:25:43.882 --> 00:25:46.832
It reached there by about two o'clock.

00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:52.990
Some of the fathers were staying in My house.

00:25:53.199 --> 00:25:56.873
Next day they said: "Mother, our right heart is catching."

00:25:57.088 --> 00:25:58.998
I said: "What is that?"

00:25:59.199 --> 00:26:00.673
"Such cruelty!"

00:26:00.874 --> 00:26:02.958
I said: "What cruelty?"

00:26:03.159 --> 00:26:08.577
"The children reached at two o'clock in the school." So what?

00:26:08.778 --> 00:26:13.458
Right heart is catching!

00:26:13.659 --> 00:26:16.928
What attachments!

00:26:26.148 --> 00:26:29.924
Your children, if they reach at two o'clock,

00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:32.713
what does it matter?

00:26:32.914 --> 00:26:36.779
Why are you so much concerned about it?

00:26:37.113 --> 00:26:39.602
They are realized souls,

00:26:39.803 --> 00:26:43.968
there is God who is looking after them.

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:50.295
Why are you so much worried about them?

00:26:52.913 --> 00:26:54.618
Leave them alone.

00:26:56.896 --> 00:27:00.933
They send them to India School.

00:27:01.134 --> 00:27:04.346
Then the mothers are sitting there.

00:27:04.547 --> 00:27:08.698
Teachers don't like it. No-one likes it.

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:13.208
They have just gone there, mothers.

00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:17.824
No school allows such nonsense.

00:27:18.025 --> 00:27:20.046
But in Sahaja Yoga they think they have a right.

00:27:20.247 --> 00:27:22.681
What right have they got? Have they paid for the school,

00:27:22.882 --> 00:27:24.705
have they done anything for the school?

00:27:24.906 --> 00:27:29.434
What right have they got to go and sit in the school?

00:27:34.274 --> 00:27:36.549
So the discretion should be, we

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.565
have to bring up our children according to Sahaj culture.

00:27:40.766 --> 00:27:50.240
The first of the principles of Sahaja Yoga is fortitude.

00:27:50.441 --> 00:27:59.361
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such dainty darlings.

00:28:03.591 --> 00:28:08.130
You have to be soldiers of Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:14.400
Your children have to be the soldiers of Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:14.601 --> 00:28:20.948
not the dainty darlings. It's not meant for them.

00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:22.432
Though they are born realized,

00:28:22.633 --> 00:28:26.355
you are ruining them by making them dainty darlings.

00:28:29.684 --> 00:28:36.806
You have to rough it out. You have to make them sturdy.

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:44.521
You have to give them self-respect.

00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:58.324
You have to give them dignity and a fortitude, forbearance.

00:29:05.293 --> 00:29:12.005
So this left Nabhi, right Nabhi,

00:29:12.206 --> 00:29:15.928
specially the left Nabhi, is a very big problem,

00:29:20.877 --> 00:29:27.048
where the woman has to be a Gruha Lakshmi

00:29:27.249 --> 00:29:34.084
and husband has not to be a Romeo, but a husband.

00:29:37.577 --> 00:29:42.770
He has to see how his wife behaves.

00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:46.073
Correct her - that is his job, his duty.

00:29:46.274 --> 00:29:49.099
He should not shirk it.

00:29:57.585 --> 00:30:00.757
Gruha Lakshmi is the woman who should know that

00:30:00.958 --> 00:30:03.492
she has the great responsibility

00:30:03.693 --> 00:30:09.357
of creating a very great society of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:12.094
She's not an ordinary woman.

00:30:12.295 --> 00:30:17.683
How many women got their realization before?

00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:21.642
But in Sahaja Yoga if you find the ladies,

00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:27.229
you hardly find very few who are really alert.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:33.971
Most of them are in trance condition.

00:30:34.172 --> 00:30:36.203
They don't know anything.

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:44.314
They don't know anything. They don't know much of cooking,

00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:48.520
you ask them anything, they don't know anything.

00:30:48.721 --> 00:30:52.832
You talk to them, you feel as if

00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:58.122
they have taken some sort of a drug.

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:01.963
Nothing goes into their heads.

00:31:02.164 --> 00:31:07.862
Sometimes one feels, it's better I do it Myself, impossible.

00:31:11.734 --> 00:31:14.859
The alertness is gone,

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.600
because alertness that comes

00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:22.380
through your right side is wasted on nonsensical things.

00:31:24.476 --> 00:31:30.069
Attention is wasted on nonsensical things, that's why

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:35.132
the housewives have lost that discretion

00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:37.854
to know that they have to be

00:31:38.055 --> 00:31:43.174
extremely alert and sensible and wise.

00:31:50.727 --> 00:31:54.684
They should know each and everything.

00:31:57.234 --> 00:32:00.848
It's not so. They just live in the air,

00:32:01.049 --> 00:32:02.723
somewhere hanging, you know.

00:32:02.924 --> 00:32:04.609
You don't know what to say to them,

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.850
how to ask for anything.

00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:12.217
How to explain anything to them is an impossible situation.

00:32:19.775 --> 00:32:24.372
So that alertness has to be there

00:32:24.573 --> 00:32:29.754
in a housewife. It's extremely important.

00:32:31.432 --> 00:32:34.842
So we have Fatima at a young age.

00:32:35.043 --> 00:32:37.596
She had these two sweet children

00:32:37.797 --> 00:32:41.171
who died in the war in Kabula.

00:32:41.372 --> 00:32:43.486
What a brave woman,

00:32:43.687 --> 00:32:48.734
the way she established the Shia system.

00:32:51.098 --> 00:32:55.342
Her husband also died,

00:32:55.543 --> 00:32:58.920
and she did all that on her own.

00:32:59.121 --> 00:33:05.587
Living behind the purdah, living behind the walls,

00:33:05.788 --> 00:33:08.508
she managed everything.

00:33:08.709 --> 00:33:13.119
We have had many such queens in our country.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.848
There was a seventeen-year-old widow,

00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:20.245
who was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji;

00:33:20.446 --> 00:33:24.305
she fought with Aurangzeb and defeated him,

00:33:24.506 --> 00:33:32.767
in our country: Tara Bai. So many of them we had.

00:33:32.968 --> 00:33:38.442
But if you do not have the alertness,

00:33:38.643 --> 00:33:41.537
then you cannot be a Gruha Lakshmi,

00:33:41.738 --> 00:33:49.031
you cannot be a good mother, you cannot be a good wife.

00:33:52.457 --> 00:33:55.504
There's no slavery in it.

00:33:57.737 --> 00:34:04.356
They don't know even what pleases their husbands,

00:34:07.177 --> 00:34:14.178
how to create peace in the family, what to say,

00:34:14.379 --> 00:34:23.653
when to say beautiful things and when to be strict.

00:34:23.854 --> 00:34:28.193
All this discretion is not there.

00:34:28.394 --> 00:34:34.536
Either they are shrews or they are slaves.

00:34:43.508 --> 00:34:49.025
So, Sahaja Yoga is meant for women who are alert,

00:34:49.226 --> 00:34:56.765
who are wise, who know everything about life.

00:34:56.966 --> 00:35:00.609
Even they don't know, where are the chakras on the feet.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:09.140
Look at your Mother. She's a woman. She knows so much.

00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:13.997
They don't know anything as to how

00:35:14.198 --> 00:35:19.211
Kundalini passes through these centers,

00:35:19.412 --> 00:35:23.148
what it does, what She is capable of.

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:25.832
But the Kundalini itself is the feminine Power.

00:35:26.055 --> 00:35:35.397
She knows each and everything about you, about your child.

00:35:37.624 --> 00:35:40.699
Many mothers don't know if the child is taking drugs,

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.429
or is behaving which way.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:51.304
Except for spoiling or beating, there's nothing in between.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:36:01.758
With discretion, the mothers

00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:09.995
can make these special children into something.

00:36:10.202 --> 00:36:14.001
That is My vision about them.

00:36:14.202 --> 00:36:16.292
But with their indiscretion

00:36:16.493 --> 00:36:19.826
they can ruin these children completely.

00:36:25.355 --> 00:36:36.961
This is so important, that our Hamsa should be all right,

00:36:37.162 --> 00:36:44.455
that we should be able to create a beautiful home,

00:36:44.656 --> 00:36:48.534
a peaceful home - not only for our family,

00:36:48.735 --> 00:36:52.687
but for all the other Sahaja Yogis who come to our house.

00:36:56.152 --> 00:37:00.723
 I don't know how it has come into the

00:37:03.513 --> 00:37:05.612
brains of Indian women,

00:37:05.813 --> 00:37:07.812
I don't know how,

00:37:08.013 --> 00:37:11.393
but if you have to please them you have to just say:

00:37:11.594 --> 00:37:17.563
"Sister-in-law, will you cook this for me tomorrow?"

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.826
Or if you say: "I am coming for dinner or lunch",

00:37:23.027 --> 00:37:26.294
that's the best. They are very much pleased.

00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:29.405
"Oh!" Just they're thinking:

00:37:29.606 --> 00:37:32.937
"Oh, what am I going to cook, what does he like?"

00:37:33.138 --> 00:37:38.770
They know about each and every person, what he likes.

00:37:38.971 --> 00:37:41.939
It's not slavishness.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:48.129
If you want to please someone it's not slavishness.

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.928
The whole nature is there to please us.

00:37:52.129 --> 00:37:55.644
Is it the slavish thing to do?

00:38:03.182 --> 00:38:12.885
But the another side of a woman is she's a Raja Lakshmi,

00:38:13.086 --> 00:38:17.865
and the man who is the king.

00:38:18.066 --> 00:38:24.994
The discretion at that point is: are you dignified or not?

00:38:27.046 --> 00:38:29.204
We went to Japan once,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:36.662
and they were treating us with great respect,

00:38:36.863 --> 00:38:38.662
even in a village.

00:38:38.863 --> 00:38:41.542
First we entered a shop because it was raining,

00:38:41.743 --> 00:38:44.391
so the villagers actually bowed to us.

00:38:44.592 --> 00:38:46.447
We didn't understand what's happening.

00:38:46.648 --> 00:38:49.968
And they, they gave us presents.

00:38:50.169 --> 00:38:53.624
So we asked ultimately, then, the interpreter:

00:38:53.825 --> 00:38:59.551
"Why are they so humble before us?"

00:38:59.752 --> 00:39:02.995
They said: "Because you belong to royal family."

00:39:03.196 --> 00:39:05.368
I said: "No, we don't belong to royal family."

00:39:05.569 --> 00:39:08.517
How would they know? No."

00:39:08.718 --> 00:39:14.030
Because your hair are neat,

00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:18.909
your daughters' hair are neat and shiny.

00:39:19.148 --> 00:39:23.217
And you don't go to hairdressers." that was it!

00:39:23.418 --> 00:39:32.007
"Is this a sign, is this a sign of royal family?"

00:39:32.208 --> 00:39:36.942
Yes, that's how the royal family is.

00:39:37.143 --> 00:39:43.692
They don't put their head into the hands of somebody else."

00:39:43.893 --> 00:39:49.631
We were amazed. Imagine the Japanese thinking like that!

00:39:54.484 --> 00:39:57.381
So the discretion is

00:39:59.508 --> 00:40:04.418
that you have to be like a queen

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:08.352
and the husband has to be like a king.

00:40:08.553 --> 00:40:12.873
But not like the king who killed his seven wives,

00:40:13.074 --> 00:40:16.291
but like a king who respects his wife.

00:40:19.948 --> 00:40:21.958
If you cannot respect your wife,

00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:25.388
you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:32.046
Respect is different from being romantically in love.

00:40:32.247 --> 00:40:35.247
I think that you don't respect.

00:40:40.656 --> 00:40:46.342
To respect your wife is a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:46.543 --> 00:40:51.294
For this, I would say the Indians are not so good,

00:40:51.495 --> 00:40:54.977
but also I know some of the Western people

00:40:55.178 --> 00:40:57.360
are also quite funny.

00:41:00.183 --> 00:41:06.825
Your dignity is reduced if you cannot respect your wife.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:12.391
Indians, especially in the North India, not in the South,

00:41:12.592 --> 00:41:16.163
they lack this, to respect their wives.

00:41:21.661 --> 00:41:36.192
Also, they lack the discretion that a wife,

00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:38.581
if she is not respected,

00:41:38.782 --> 00:41:42.613
the children will not be respectful to her

00:41:42.814 --> 00:41:46.086
and she is in charge of the children.

00:41:50.757 --> 00:41:54.382
But the most indiscreet thing about Nabhi

00:41:54.583 --> 00:42:00.071
is that you don't listen to your Guru.

00:42:03.159 --> 00:42:07.778
Hundred times you tell something to Sahaja Yogis,

00:42:07.979 --> 00:42:11.272
but still they will not listen to Me.

00:42:15.191 --> 00:42:22.046
Still, they will do as the fashion tells them

00:42:22.247 --> 00:42:25.247
or the norms that they have.

00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:38.176
Listening to your Guru, as they say, as if

00:42:38.377 --> 00:42:42.345
it's to obey the God Almighty.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:59.417
Whatever is said is to be accepted as a great blessing,

00:42:59.618 --> 00:43:06.924
as a great correction and is to be followed,

00:43:07.125 --> 00:43:10.488
not to be just left out as it is.

00:43:15.021 --> 00:43:19.407
As you know, your Mother is your Guru

00:43:19.608 --> 00:43:27.108
and She's your Mother. Also She's Mahamaya.

00:43:29.248 --> 00:43:35.776
Also She's Adi Shakti. And She's so gentle

00:43:35.977 --> 00:43:38.977
and She's so kind.

00:43:39.406 --> 00:43:44.077
She says some things to you to correct you.

00:43:47.093 --> 00:43:50.565
So many lectures I've given,

00:43:50.766 --> 00:43:55.916
of telling you what is important.

00:44:00.573 --> 00:44:06.965
But you should open your heart and surrender it

00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:10.841
fully to your Guru, then only you'll mature,

00:44:11.042 --> 00:44:14.526
otherwise there is no way out, I'm sorry to say.

00:44:15.751 --> 00:44:19.145
I do not like anybody surrendering to Me

00:44:19.346 --> 00:44:21.951
or touching My Feet or falling at Me.

00:44:22.152 --> 00:44:24.856
I, I, I don't understand that. I mean,

00:44:25.057 --> 00:44:29.530
I'm not conscious of it, not aware of it.

00:44:29.731 --> 00:44:33.990
It makes no difference to Me. Even when you sing My Jai,

00:44:34.191 --> 00:44:38.668
I think that you are singing some Mataji Nirmala Devi's Jai,

00:44:38.869 --> 00:44:40.335
in the third person,

00:44:40.536 --> 00:44:45.374
and sometimes I'm afraid I might say "Jai" with you.

00:44:45.575 --> 00:44:48.221
When you are singing "Swagata Agat"

00:44:48.422 --> 00:44:50.911
I always think there's some Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:44:51.112 --> 00:44:54.771
"Swagat" song they are singing somebody else.

00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:03.421
But for your goodness, for your ascent

00:45:03.622 --> 00:45:06.161
for which you have come here:

00:45:06.362 --> 00:45:10.443
you have not come here just to waste your time,

00:45:10.644 --> 00:45:15.959
but to ascend, and for that it is important

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:22.766
that whatever I am saying, you have to obey implicitly.

00:45:22.967 --> 00:45:28.141
But I never say a thing which will be uncomfortable for you.

00:45:28.681 --> 00:45:31.938
I never say: "You don't take your food"

00:45:32.139 --> 00:45:36.623
or "Don't drink water" - nothing of the kind.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:46.240
But, out of laziness, people just don't do many things;

00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:53.817
or, if not laziness, then just they do not know how

00:45:54.018 --> 00:46:04.894
important it is. Or else they feel nervous.

00:46:07.853 --> 00:46:17.381
So the discretion is that Guru is Parabrahma

00:46:17.632 --> 00:46:19.997
any guru, Satguru.

00:46:20.198 --> 00:46:24.899
But what about the Parabrahma Itself, which is your Guru?

00:46:26.966 --> 00:46:31.475
I do not say things as hearty as the gurus used to do it.

00:46:31.676 --> 00:46:36.038
I mean, if you read about them you'll be shocked.

00:46:36.239 --> 00:46:40.119
But whatever I say, every word, you must note,

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.984
is for your benevolence

00:46:42.185 --> 00:46:45.270
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:46:45.471 --> 00:46:49.748
And, by not obeying Me in that,

00:46:49.949 --> 00:46:53.791
you are not only spoiling your own chances,

00:46:53.992 --> 00:46:58.468
but the chances of the whole world.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.662
So you understand how important it is

00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:14.047
 if you are the disciple, if you are blessed by your Guru.

00:47:14.248 --> 00:47:17.674
All these things are written about them,

00:47:17.875 --> 00:47:21.420
but I say not only that you are My disciples,

00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:28.285
but you have got your realization, you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:47:29.928 --> 00:47:34.447
You got all the powers. You know each and everything.

00:47:34.648 --> 00:47:38.243
You are so special people.

00:47:38.726 --> 00:47:44.585
For such people there should not be any difference of opinion,

00:47:44.786 --> 00:47:49.144
because you know the same thing all the time,

00:47:50.338 --> 00:47:52.831
so there cannot be any fight,

00:47:53.032 --> 00:47:55.942
there cannot be any quarrel,

00:47:56.143 --> 00:48:00.088
there cannot be any argument.

00:48:00.289 --> 00:48:08.098
But the discretion should be that our Guru is a Mother.

00:48:08.299 --> 00:48:12.632
She's very mild. She's very gentle.

00:48:13.164 --> 00:48:16.957
She's very kind. I know that.

00:48:17.158 --> 00:48:20.714
One day, My brother told Me,

00:48:20.915 --> 00:48:24.046
that: "What sort of a Guru You are?

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:29.240
When my guru was teaching me tabla,

00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:34.248
he used to break the tampura on my head,

00:48:34.449 --> 00:48:43.310
and even one percussion I would make wrong,

00:48:43.511 --> 00:48:46.709
he would bring his hammer:

00:48:46.987 --> 00:48:50.947
'And now I'm going to break your nails!'

00:48:53.713 --> 00:48:56.702
I said: "There's no need to do all this.

00:48:56.903 --> 00:49:00.623
Not necessary in Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:00.824 --> 00:49:04.157
because they are self-disciplined."

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:07.596
So there has to be the self-disciplination,

00:49:07.797 --> 00:49:11.951
as you can so call it, on the Hamsa Chakra,

00:49:12.152 --> 00:49:17.072
which is the one which knows what is right, what is wrong,

00:49:17.273 --> 00:49:21.189
through which we work it out; whatever is the right

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:26.124
that's all we do. Otherwise we don't do whatever is wrong.

00:49:31.084 --> 00:49:34.541
Then comes the Heart Chakra.

00:49:36.297 --> 00:49:39.846
We talk of love. We talk of this. We talk of that.

00:49:40.047 --> 00:49:42.671
I mean, so much of talk of love in the West,

00:49:42.872 --> 00:49:47.355
which is never in India.

00:49:47.556 --> 00:49:52.716
But there isn't any love.

00:49:52.917 --> 00:50:02.516
It is such a love for money, love for possessions,

00:50:03.494 --> 00:50:09.874
but there is no pure love, Nirvaj. There's no love like that.

00:50:15.453 --> 00:50:23.543
So the discretion between your family

00:50:23.744 --> 00:50:29.944
and others' family is to be seen. Very clearly,

00:50:30.145 --> 00:50:34.658
you will know that you are doing something wrong.

00:50:34.859 --> 00:50:40.374
This is more in India than here, abroad.

00:50:40.575 --> 00:50:47.420
That there is no discretion, about the Family

00:50:47.621 --> 00:50:51.027
like people are coming to see me

00:50:51.228 --> 00:50:54.835
so a foreign couple will stay back.

00:50:55.036 --> 00:50:58.228
One by one they'll come. All right, couples are all right.

00:50:58.429 --> 00:51:00.737
But they'll not bring their uncles, aunties,

00:51:00.938 --> 00:51:03.807
their aunties' parents, their parents, and then

00:51:04.008 --> 00:51:05.513
the grandparents and all that.

00:51:05.801 --> 00:51:11.771
Together they will come in one line.

00:51:14.567 --> 00:51:18.470
They will always be grouped together.

00:51:18.671 --> 00:51:22.578
All of them will be on My head. I have seen.

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:26.873
There's no discretion there,

00:51:27.074 --> 00:51:29.960
that we are individuals as far as Mother is concerned.

00:51:30.161 --> 00:51:32.196
She is our Mother. She's our Guru

00:51:32.435 --> 00:51:34.853
and we have to face Her individually,

00:51:35.054 --> 00:51:38.662
not to take all this paraphernalia with us:

00:51:38.873 --> 00:51:45.720
all our relations, my brothers or my sisters or my this and that.

00:51:48.084 --> 00:51:50.890
So the discretion as far as the guru is concerned,

00:51:51.091 --> 00:51:57.153
 is an extremely important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:04.047 --> 00:52:09.687
It is.. You want Me to explain to you how

00:52:09.945 --> 00:52:19.775
the gravity acts through Nabhi. No doubt.

00:52:19.976 --> 00:52:27.465
But through your Heart Chakra, if you gravitate at people,

00:52:27.666 --> 00:52:30.710
or sort of what you call, the charisma of a person

00:52:30.911 --> 00:52:36.248
or some sort of a nonsense, or the charmingness of a person,

00:52:36.449 --> 00:52:39.145
that means you're attracted towards something

00:52:39.346 --> 00:52:42.854
that is extremely superficial and not

00:52:43.055 --> 00:52:47.552
at something which has gravity in it.

00:52:50.639 --> 00:52:56.200
So, the discretion at the Heart

00:52:56.401 --> 00:53:02.882
is to have a relationship which is so detached

00:53:03.083 --> 00:53:11.194
that you nourish everything, every part of your family.

00:53:11.395 --> 00:53:12.845
Now somebody's attached to the husband,

00:53:13.046 --> 00:53:14.535
somebody's attached to children,

00:53:14.736 --> 00:53:17.432
somebody's attached to the dogs,

00:53:17.633 --> 00:53:23.424
somebody's attached to the, only to the plants.

00:53:23.625 --> 00:53:27.663
 It's very indiscreet.

00:53:27.864 --> 00:53:31.584
You should be attached to everything the same, same way.

00:53:31.785 --> 00:53:34.171
 I would say that you should be so detached

00:53:34.372 --> 00:53:40.465
that you are attached to everyone equally.

00:53:40.666 --> 00:53:47.402
Detachment doesn't mean that you wear dresses scantily.

00:53:47.603 --> 00:53:54.037
It doesn't mean that. It's a wrong idea.

00:53:54.238 --> 00:54:02.521
Detachment means that you watch everything,

00:54:02.722 --> 00:54:07.751
and you do not get involved with anyone.

00:54:07.952 --> 00:54:16.282
You are out of it, and you are seeing everything,

00:54:16.483 --> 00:54:20.483
watching it, you're a witness.

00:54:23.483 --> 00:54:29.950
This sort of love if you have for anyone,

00:54:31.431 --> 00:54:40.723
you will be blessed by that personality very much more.

00:54:48.614 --> 00:54:50.991
So now the discretion of the Vishuddhi

00:54:51.192 --> 00:54:54.603
is another very important thing.

00:54:54.804 --> 00:54:59.464
The other day somebody came, and his right hand was frozen.

00:54:59.665 --> 00:55:02.019
I asked him: "What do you do?" He says:

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:13.693
"I am working as a secretary." That lady. So I said:

00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:18.383
"What do you do?" She said: "I type. I type a lot."

00:55:18.584 --> 00:55:20.979
I said: "You take to Sahaja Yoga,

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:30.050
and before typing you just say 'Namaskar' to that

00:55:30.259 --> 00:55:32.385
work that you have to do, just like that,

00:55:32.586 --> 00:55:35.853
and then you start doing the work,

00:55:36.054 --> 00:55:40.276
as if you are not doing it.

00:55:40.484 --> 00:55:41.506
You are just doing it, typing,

00:55:41.707 --> 00:55:44.419
you are just typing, that's all. You are not doing it,

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.022
you are not doing anything

00:55:47.223 --> 00:55:49.990
Some people say, "Mother, You travel so much." I never travel.

00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:53.887
 I'm sitting or I'm walking. Where do I travel?

00:55:54.088 --> 00:55:57.189
It's the plane that travels, I'm just sitting in the plane.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:06.744
I never travel like a Superman. I'm sitting very nicely.

00:56:06.945 --> 00:56:10.998
Where do I travel? If I start thinking: "I travel very much,

00:56:11.199 --> 00:56:15.668
I do this work, I do that work",

00:56:15.869 --> 00:56:17.535
somebody would say: "Mother, you do so much work."

00:56:17.736 --> 00:56:19.527
 I mean I don't do anything. I tell you, really,

00:56:19.728 --> 00:56:24.790
I don't do anything. Now I'm speaking. All right.

00:56:24.991 --> 00:56:27.607
So, just I'm speaking, that's all;

00:56:27.808 --> 00:56:29.639
and this speech also I'm not doing it.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:33.790
It's just coming out, like a radio.

00:56:33.991 --> 00:56:39.219
Would you say that the radio is doing any work?

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.205
It's just a radio.

00:56:42.406 --> 00:56:45.763
Actually, I don't do anything whatsoever.

00:56:45.964 --> 00:56:51.953
So when I'm not doing anything, why should I feel tired?

00:56:52.154 --> 00:56:58.372
Why should I wear out? So this feeling of:

00:56:58.573 --> 00:57:01.650
"I am doing this and I am doing that",

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:10.397
is responsible for creating your problems of ego within you.

00:57:10.598 --> 00:57:13.405
So, to use the discretion over this ego,

00:57:13.606 --> 00:57:15.905
to put it down in its proper place,

00:57:16.106 --> 00:57:20.416
are these strands of Ida and Pingala

00:57:20.617 --> 00:57:24.550
sitting on top of them, to bring it down.

00:57:30.942 --> 00:57:38.273
And it's like a brake and an accelerator.

00:57:38.474 --> 00:57:43.416
So, if somebody has too much of ego

00:57:43.617 --> 00:57:52.137
then the discretion, see, is missing from that person.

00:57:52.338 --> 00:57:54.121
He does something, thinks: "I have done this,

00:57:54.322 --> 00:57:58.938
I have done that"; as they say, Humpty Dumpty sort.

00:57:59.139 --> 00:58:05.224
And then he suddenly finds that's finished.

00:58:05.425 --> 00:58:11.097
"I was very stupid to have such a, such an ego."

00:58:11.298 --> 00:58:14.032
So, what does he say? "All right, Mother, You do help me.

00:58:14.233 --> 00:58:20.191
You work it out." Finished. It's done.

00:58:20.392 --> 00:58:26.019
Of course I don't do anything, nor you do anything.

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:32.051
If you just say, "Mother, please do this for me", it's done.

00:58:32.252 --> 00:58:34.245
If you say, "Mother, come in my head",

00:58:34.446 --> 00:58:36.324
I come in your head;

00:58:36.525 --> 00:58:39.261
"Come in my eyes", I come in your eyes.

00:58:39.462 --> 00:58:43.089
Say what you like, I don't do anything at all.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:48.708
Neither you do anything. It just works!

00:58:48.909 --> 00:58:51.480
Somebody else is doing - all right?

00:58:51.681 --> 00:58:56.214
Need not bother about that. Somebody's doing it,

00:58:56.415 --> 00:58:58.825
but as long as I am not doing it, I am relaxed and

00:58:59.026 --> 00:59:03.158
I am not worried. I am not upset.

00:59:03.359 --> 00:59:06.991
So Visshuddhi is a very, very important center,

00:59:07.192 --> 00:59:11.320
and for you Americans, especially, American Sahaja Yogis,

00:59:11.521 --> 00:59:14.280
you have to know that to be in the Visshuddhi

00:59:14.481 --> 00:59:17.719
means you're "in charge".

00:59:21.042 --> 00:59:24.983
Not doing anything, but in charge.

00:59:28.972 --> 00:59:31.001
Like these two hands are there,

00:59:31.202 --> 00:59:34.072
and you should know that it's the Visshuddhi Chakra

00:59:34.273 --> 00:59:37.088
which controls the two most important chakras,

00:59:37.289 --> 00:59:41.723
are Lalita Chakra and Shri Chakra. Just think about it.

00:59:41.924 --> 00:59:45.535
How important is Visshuddhi?

00:59:45.736 --> 00:59:50.196
How important is America? Just think of it.

00:59:54.480 --> 01:00:03.828
But nobody's aware of it. America means Las Vegas,

01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:06.165
then all these horrible beaches

01:00:06.366 --> 01:00:09.133
horrible, horrible, horrible!

01:00:09.341 --> 01:00:14.195
Nobody knows what is America is,

01:00:14.396 --> 01:00:16.784
what does it mean to be in America,

01:00:16.985 --> 01:00:21.520
what's our responsibility.

01:00:21.721 --> 01:00:28.570
All this comes to you when you allow your

01:00:28.771 --> 01:00:32.271
Kundalini to be up there,

01:00:32.472 --> 01:00:34.596
so you're absolutely detached,

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:38.093
you're connected with the mains, like this one,

01:00:38.294 --> 01:00:40.704
and the whole work is done by the mains.

01:00:40.905 --> 01:00:44.222
You don't have to do anything.

01:00:45.231 --> 01:00:52.493
So when you are detached of doing anything,

01:00:52.694 --> 01:00:56.723
of appreciating anything or debasing anything,

01:00:56.924 --> 01:01:02.330
or judging anything, when you are not at all

01:01:02.531 --> 01:01:05.298
doing all this nonsense,

01:01:05.499 --> 01:01:07.877
that means you are absolutely detached

01:01:08.078 --> 01:01:11.673
in the real sense of the word.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:18.579
So this works up to the Agnya Chakra.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:26.343
We can say that all these

01:01:26.544 --> 01:01:32.248
discretionary powers are within you,

01:01:32.449 --> 01:01:36.089
they are built in, they are spontaneous,

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:40.526
and you have to just allow them to grow,

01:01:40.727 --> 01:01:49.497
by meditating, by watching yourself every minute,

01:01:49.698 --> 01:02:00.021
every second, whether are you enjoying yourself or not?

01:02:00.222 --> 01:02:07.980
So the whole of discretion rests on one point:

01:02:11.338 --> 01:02:19.622
how far you are enjoying Sahaja Yoga. What a nice thing!

01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:25.777
Like yesterday, I was meeting every sort of a person,

01:02:25.978 --> 01:02:29.658
and some, some of them felt I was exerting too much Myself.

01:02:29.859 --> 01:02:33.452
No, no, no, no, not at all! I was enjoying all of them.

01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:37.474
Sahaja Yoga is a very big joker - very big joker.

01:02:37.675 --> 01:02:42.355
Say a person comes up to you, you talk to that person.

01:02:42.556 --> 01:02:45.929
It's a drama behind every individual

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:49.404
and you discover what a drama this individual was.

01:02:49.605 --> 01:02:53.352
No need to go to any theatre or any film!

01:02:56.357 --> 01:03:01.422
Every personality is a drama. Very enjoyable

01:03:01.623 --> 01:03:04.207
if you just want to see the drama

01:03:04.408 --> 01:03:08.731
and if you just know that, oh, you have to watch the drama!

01:03:08.932 --> 01:03:12.019
You have to see it.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:16.551
Only painful part is, that as a guru,

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:19.281
I have to tell them this is not good, that is not good.

01:03:19.482 --> 01:03:22.261
That's the only painful thing.

01:03:22.462 --> 01:03:28.117
I wish I could have avoided it somehow, but it's not possible.

01:03:28.318 --> 01:03:32.930
Because from the darkness to the sunlight you have to come out,

01:03:33.131 --> 01:03:35.954
and you're holding My hand so I have to tell you

01:03:36.155 --> 01:03:40.922
that be careful, it's a very, very small road

01:03:41.123 --> 01:03:46.464
and both the sides you can fall off into Ida and Pingala.

01:03:46.665 --> 01:03:54.816
So hold My hand tightly, we have to go further. Further. Further

01:03:55.017 --> 01:03:58.680
Don't look this side, that side. That's all.

01:03:58.881 --> 01:04:04.259
And this is what it is when you have discretion

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.694
to put your hand into the hands of your Guru.

01:04:08.895 --> 01:04:13.519
Then you don't do anything. You just watch everyone,

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.372
see everyone and only thing you do is to enjoy.

01:04:17.573 --> 01:04:20.261
Whether you do it or not is not the point,

01:04:20.462 --> 01:04:24.221
but you are in the state of enjoyment,

01:04:24.422 --> 01:04:27.994
completely in the state of enjoyment.

01:04:28.195 --> 01:04:31.867
And that is the state we have to achieve,

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:37.840
and should become that state as our own being.

01:04:47.146 --> 01:04:54.123
Up to Hamsa Chakra you have come

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:58.383
and the Kundalini is now ready to open,

01:04:58.584 --> 01:05:02.364
very much better, because She knows

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:14.570
that you are in a state, She knows you now.

01:05:14.771 --> 01:05:17.411
She knows you very well,

01:05:17.612 --> 01:05:22.632
and the Kundalini knows that you can now

01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:26.224
pass through Agnya.

01:05:26.496 --> 01:05:29.430
Your attention can pass through Agnya

01:05:29.631 --> 01:05:33.183
because you have discretion.

01:05:33.384 --> 01:05:37.215
You've cleared out yourself of all these loads and things,

01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:42.876
and you can now pass through this Agnya.

01:05:46.805 --> 01:05:49.755
So before realization, those people who have had

01:05:49.956 --> 01:05:53.057
discretion are the best people to rise.

01:05:53.258 --> 01:05:55.969
They're solid people.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:06:01.114
Or, those who are weak again and again fall and rise,

01:06:01.315 --> 01:06:07.027
fall and rise, fall and rise. They catch again and again.

01:06:07.228 --> 01:06:11.274
So the discretion, at that time,

01:06:11.475 --> 01:06:16.136
is to know that you are here for your ascent

01:06:16.337 --> 01:06:18.699
and for nothing else.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.699
And that has to work spontaneously

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:38.049
only by just finding out Joy and Joy-giving things.

01:06:38.834 --> 01:06:46.834
It is not so difficult if you allow the spontaneity to work it,

01:06:47.035 --> 01:06:52.040
but they told Me that: "Mother, we have to do this,

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:54.897
we have to do that. What to do? This and that."

01:06:55.098 --> 01:07:03.018
Just leave it at that point. Just leave it,

01:07:03.327 --> 01:07:10.055
and everything will work out. You are not doing anything.

01:07:10.256 --> 01:07:11.822
You are not really doing anything.

01:07:12.023 --> 01:07:14.965
It's this all-pervading Power, which is so efficient,

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:18.776
is doing everything for you.

01:07:20.706 --> 01:07:21.807
There is one point which

01:07:22.008 --> 01:07:26.444
I wanted to tell you about the Ashram life.

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:33.820
We have ashrams and ashrams and ashrams everywhere.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:53.314
Ashram is a small world.

01:07:53.515 --> 01:08:02.027
It is a symbol of an ideal world of the enlightened people.

01:08:02.228 --> 01:08:07.686
It's not that only those who are having no house:

01:08:07.887 --> 01:08:10.313
"All right, you have no house? Come along!

01:08:10.514 --> 01:08:14.974
Because you can pay the rent!"

01:08:15.355 --> 01:08:20.616
It's meant for people who are of that quality.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:27.086
So now in the ashram one has to realize

01:08:27.287 --> 01:08:32.564
that you are under complete observation.

01:08:35.123 --> 01:08:41.533
So you have to be alert. Somebody's watching you.

01:08:41.734 --> 01:08:45.051
Now you have come in the camera.

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:49.122
You are now in the ashram.

01:08:53.242 --> 01:08:57.260
So let's start from the very beginning, as I said,

01:08:57.461 --> 01:09:02.595
 in an ashram, as far as the Mooladhara is concerned.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.776
That part I think most of you have worked out,

01:09:07.991 --> 01:09:13.147
that you should keep an extremely clean atmosphere.

01:09:13.348 --> 01:09:22.182
But I have seen some mad people, even in the ashram,

01:09:25.262 --> 01:09:29.110
start behaving in a manner

01:09:29.311 --> 01:09:33.763
that doesn't show that they are Ashramites.

01:09:36.134 --> 01:09:40.695
Their behavior is so funny towards sex sometimes

01:09:40.896 --> 01:09:45.713
that I just don't understand.

01:09:45.914 --> 01:09:49.619
The relationship between the husband and wife also:

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:56.881
either they fight with their fists or their legs or feet,

01:09:57.082 --> 01:10:01.282
or otherwise they're absolutely docile

01:10:01.558 --> 01:10:04.359
and given up each other.

01:10:08.619 --> 01:10:15.550
It is such a misunderstanding we have,

01:10:17.487 --> 01:10:22.842
without Hamsa Chakra being enlightened,

01:10:23.043 --> 01:10:33.402
that we take to things which were so dangerous for us,

01:10:33.603 --> 01:10:38.388
for our society a long time back, just for granted,

01:10:40.801 --> 01:10:43.393
and we start doing the same thing.

01:10:43.594 --> 01:10:45.528
If not to go down to that level,

01:10:45.729 --> 01:10:47.822
but we try to keep company with such people,

01:10:48.023 --> 01:10:51.457
we try to so-called "help" them, whatever we try to do

01:10:51.658 --> 01:10:54.505
for them all the time.

01:10:54.706 --> 01:10:57.872
We are so indiscreet

01:10:59.703 --> 01:11:05.002
that whatever we try to do for others, anything:

01:11:05.203 --> 01:11:11.823
either there is some sort of a passion

01:11:12.024 --> 01:11:19.553
or a obsession or some sort of a gain or whatever it is,

01:11:19.754 --> 01:11:23.795
then it is indiscreet, absolutely indiscreet.

01:11:23.996 --> 01:11:27.798
Because you don't do anything, it just flows,

01:11:27.999 --> 01:11:30.742
goes to everyone.

01:11:30.943 --> 01:11:33.504
So, in the ashram the life should be very pure.

01:11:33.705 --> 01:11:36.668
Relationship should, should be very pure,

01:11:36.869 --> 01:11:39.623
there should be respect of the elders.

01:11:39.824 --> 01:11:41.752
Those who cannot respect their elders

01:11:41.953 --> 01:11:44.919
will have a right Visshuddhi problem, always.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.529
They must know how to respect their elders,

01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:55.047
and a proper respect of the representative of your Guru.

01:12:01.436 --> 01:12:07.726
The other chakras are to be seen in the same manner.

01:12:07.927 --> 01:12:15.998
In an ashram try to have things which are spontaneous.

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:20.793
Not to have something artificial

01:12:20.994 --> 01:12:24.277
or some things your Guru won't like.

01:12:24.478 --> 01:12:29.541
Like, I don't want to see there some sort of funny

01:12:29.742 --> 01:12:36.818
paintings or some sort of, of funny, suggestive,

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:40.913
stupid kind of an emblem.

01:12:41.114 --> 01:12:47.388
In a household that is Sahaj it should be felt by anybody

01:12:47.589 --> 01:12:51.182
who comes in, feel: "Oh, this is an ashram!"

01:12:51.383 --> 01:12:55.160
clean, neat, tidy.

01:12:55.558 --> 01:13:03.515
And also, ashram should be a place of peace

01:13:03.716 --> 01:13:07.856
and happiness and joy.

01:13:08.057 --> 01:13:11.390
If somebody comes to that ashram he should feel:

01:13:11.591 --> 01:13:14.310
"What a place I have found!

01:13:17.505 --> 01:13:23.119
What a nice place it is! I wish I could also come here."

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:29.177
It's only your discretion that works it out,

01:13:29.378 --> 01:13:34.004
that whatever you create, whatever you do is for the best.

01:13:34.434 --> 01:13:37.651
Now what do I do? You bring some water to Me,

01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:40.652
I just put My hand. I do not vibrate.

01:13:40.853 --> 01:13:44.160
I do not do anything to vibrate, or just put My hand.

01:13:44.361 --> 01:13:45.837
Finished, it's vibrated.

01:13:46.038 --> 01:13:48.647
Now why should I take any credit for it?

01:13:48.848 --> 01:13:51.992
Just vibrated. Finished!

01:13:52.193 --> 01:13:55.325
Do I do anything? Anything else have you seen?

01:13:55.526 --> 01:13:59.899
Nothing. Just put My hand. Finished! It's vibrated.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.636
In the same way,

01:14:03.843 --> 01:14:06.245
when you are doing something you just think that:

01:14:06.446 --> 01:14:10.097
I'm not doing anything. It's just this hand put there.

01:14:10.298 --> 01:14:13.837
If there is some red on my hand the water will become red.

01:14:14.038 --> 01:14:16.216
So what did I do? Nothing! Nothing.

01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:17.988
Now there are vibrations in my hand.

01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:24.323
You have put it in the water, it has been vibrated. So what?

01:14:33.894 --> 01:14:40.604
Now in the ashram I have seen people are not alert at all.

01:14:40.805 --> 01:14:43.707
Now there's a telephone call comes in.

01:14:43.908 --> 01:14:46.935
It gets lost, or there's no communication.

01:14:47.136 --> 01:14:49.570
One person doesn't tell another person

01:14:49.771 --> 01:14:52.189
what is the telephone that has come.

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:56.078
But even in the household we have to be careful and alert.

01:14:56.279 --> 01:14:59.030
Like you put a paper there

01:14:59.231 --> 01:15:01.070
or some sort of a notebook

01:15:01.271 --> 01:15:04.244
where you should write down today, whose telephones came.

01:15:04.445 --> 01:15:07.577
Write it in, one after another.

01:15:07.778 --> 01:15:12.132
So when a person sees a telephone call has come,

01:15:12.333 --> 01:15:13.895
that person can telephone back.

01:15:14.096 --> 01:15:16.800
It's one of the examples I'm just giving you,

01:15:17.001 --> 01:15:21.223
how you have to be alert about that.

01:15:21.424 --> 01:15:26.001
Now if you are cooking

01:15:26.202 --> 01:15:29.644
you should know how many people are going to eat.

01:15:29.845 --> 01:15:34.341
There are going to be, say, ten people,

01:15:34.542 --> 01:15:37.754
then the food will be cooked only for two.

01:15:37.955 --> 01:15:43.746
But if there are two persons,

01:15:43.947 --> 01:15:49.090
then the food will be cooked for ten people!

01:15:49.291 --> 01:15:53.780
And then the food is thrown out, because after all..

01:15:53.981 --> 01:15:57.537
But this is absolutely absurd!

01:15:58.404 --> 01:16:04.704
I must tell you a story of Mahatma Gandhi.

01:16:04.905 --> 01:16:07.300
I was in his ashram. I was quite young at the time,

01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:11.173
but that is on My.. very much recorded.

01:16:11.374 --> 01:16:17.751
So he wanted everybody to stay for dinner - lunch.

01:16:17.952 --> 01:16:20.005
They said: But we are going there. It's all right,

01:16:20.206 --> 01:16:21.213
you can have your lunch with me;

01:16:21.435 --> 01:16:22.457
and they were having a conference.

01:16:22.658 --> 01:16:26.436
All the big johnnies were sitting there.

01:16:26.637 --> 01:16:32.263
So he got up, and he had the keys in his

01:16:32.464 --> 01:16:36.025
janeva as they wear, it is said: it is that sacred thread.

01:16:36.226 --> 01:16:42.282
Came out, with his key he opened the storeroom and got

01:16:42.483 --> 01:16:47.631
everything taken out, according to the allotment of every person;

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:54.457
 like one person would get only one "chataque",

01:16:54.658 --> 01:16:59.470
ounce, for each person. So he stood there.

01:16:59.671 --> 01:17:04.871
It was all measured, brought out, for cooking.

01:17:05.092 --> 01:17:08.777
So all these people were there. "Molanar sahib" said:

01:17:08.978 --> 01:17:11.618
We didn't know, Sir, that you had to do it yourself,

01:17:11.819 --> 01:17:15.841
to stand there with the keys, to take out everything.

01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:19.062
We - you have wasted so much your time for us.

01:17:19.263 --> 01:17:21.840
He said: What, wasted?

01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:26.292
Yes, for this you had to stand there, and take out the food.

01:17:26.493 --> 01:17:32.866
He said: Do you know, this is the blood of my countrymen.

01:17:38.539 --> 01:17:42.854
There are so many people starving in this world,

01:17:43.055 --> 01:17:49.456
and if you throw food like that, I assure you,

01:17:49.657 --> 01:17:53.970
one day you will be starving.

01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:58.923
You cannot insult food like that, but you have to be alert.

01:17:59.124 --> 01:18:01.225
You go to an ashram, I've seen in Australia,

01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:05.106
everywhere it's on, you just go and ask them, all right:

01:18:05.307 --> 01:18:09.458
Have you got ghee with you?

01:18:09.659 --> 01:18:10.683
No.

01:18:12.017 --> 01:18:14.659
Then what oil you have?

01:18:15.730 --> 01:18:19.244
They said: "What oil?" Only going on like this.

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:23.779
What is this? Where you have, what oil you have got?

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.804
No-one knows what oil they have got.

01:18:27.005 --> 01:18:30.100
They don't know. They don't read what oils they have got.

01:18:30.299 --> 01:18:33.114
So somebody brings an oil bottle.

01:18:33.315 --> 01:18:36.005
I read it: "Castor oil."

01:18:39.204 --> 01:18:43.765
"Castor oil?" "Yes, what else?"

01:18:43.966 --> 01:18:47.733
I said: "Do you know for what castor oil is used?"

01:18:47.934 --> 01:18:53.386
"No, Mother." "Do you cook in this oil?" "I don't know."

01:18:57.214 --> 01:19:00.714
From where are you coming? Lunatic asylum, or what?

01:19:04.182 --> 01:19:09.727
There is no alertness, is the point.

01:19:09.928 --> 01:19:15.171
So, you have to get up at four o'clock, four-thirty.

01:19:15.372 --> 01:19:18.661
I don't say you have to do it,

01:19:18.862 --> 01:19:20.605
but discipline yourself because

01:19:20.806 --> 01:19:23.049
that's the time you get the alertness,

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:33.331
the first shooting of the rays of the sun gives you that.

01:19:34.432 --> 01:19:37.421
You'll always see Me early in the morning awake.

01:19:37.622 --> 01:19:43.077
Not that I need that, but for your sake I get up.

01:19:44.474 --> 01:19:49.041
You can sleep later on, but that time you just get up.

01:19:51.255 --> 01:19:58.750
First rays - sun comes much later, the rays come first.

01:19:58.951 --> 01:20:03.359
That gives you alertness. Then you have your bath,

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:07.090
do your Pujas. You are ready.

01:20:07.291 --> 01:20:12.527
By six o'clock you are ready and alert.

01:20:12.728 --> 01:20:16.892
But the alertness should be about everything.

01:20:17.093 --> 01:20:24.062
Now supposing I ask: "Where did you buy this?"

01:20:24.263 --> 01:20:27.962
This should never be answered for anything.

01:20:28.163 --> 01:20:32.168
"Where do you get this made?"

01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:35.995
I know everything, if you ask Me.

01:20:36.203 --> 01:20:38.019
I may not know about this but I will find out

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:42.632
from where did you get it and I will know.

01:20:47.462 --> 01:20:51.376
Alertness about things, what we have,

01:20:51.577 --> 01:20:55.749
what is in the ashram, are we keeping it clean or not,

01:20:55.950 --> 01:21:01.856
or we're lousy people, absolutely lousy,

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:06.646
don't know anything. Is a big fashion to say:

01:21:06.847 --> 01:21:14.491
"I don't know." I'm not asking absurd question like:

01:21:14.692 --> 01:21:17.904
"How many hair do you have in your head?",

01:21:18.105 --> 01:21:22.338
or "How many stars there are?" A simple thing if I say:

01:21:22.539 --> 01:21:26.057
"How many cups you have got?"

01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:32.350
Same with the men I have seen.

01:21:32.564 --> 01:21:35.057
It's not with the women, but men, also,

01:21:35.258 --> 01:21:38.912
do not have that alertness that they should have.

01:21:39.113 --> 01:21:43.394
There's no communication among themselves.

01:21:44.382 --> 01:21:47.610
They have more alertness because they are right-sided,

01:21:47.811 --> 01:21:54.078
but they have no alertness about the feelings of others.

01:21:54.279 --> 01:21:57.678
Like, there's a husband who is very rude to his wife,

01:21:57.879 --> 01:22:00.800
always insults her.

01:22:01.001 --> 01:22:04.164
The alertness of the man should be in the ashram,

01:22:04.365 --> 01:22:08.727
is to shave off his head and also shave off his moustaches,

01:22:08.928 --> 01:22:15.681
and ask him just to go about with the pyjama.

01:22:15.882 --> 01:22:17.610
Or even then he misbehaves,

01:22:17.811 --> 01:22:21.811
then get a donkey and make him sit on that.

01:22:22.953 --> 01:22:26.612
Even then if he misbehaves, then tell him:

01:22:26.813 --> 01:22:31.874
"No water available for you, do what you like."

01:22:32.075 --> 01:22:39.343
Such punishment should be given to a man who misbehaves,

01:22:39.544 --> 01:22:43.403
who has no emotional feelings towards his wife,

01:22:43.604 --> 01:22:47.441
who ill-treats. Or somebody who is very romantic,

01:22:47.642 --> 01:22:50.205
also you should make fun of that person.

01:22:50.406 --> 01:22:54.674
This is the alertness of men, is very important to see.

01:22:54.875 --> 01:22:58.531
Also they should be alert as to how the money is spent.

01:22:58.732 --> 01:23:02.219
You know very well how they have made money

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:06.163
out of Me in San Diego ashram.

01:23:06.364 --> 01:23:10.078
Nobody bothered even to find out, what's happening to this.

01:23:10.279 --> 01:23:12.593
They're paying their rent - finished!

01:23:12.794 --> 01:23:16.220
Where are they spending? What are they doing about it?

01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:18.077
Nobody knows about it.

01:23:18.278 --> 01:23:19.958
I asked them: "Did you find out

01:23:20.159 --> 01:23:21.577
where they were sending money?

01:23:21.778 --> 01:23:24.743
Did they send Me the money, My rents, things?" Nothing!

01:23:24.944 --> 01:23:29.628
"We don't know, Mother. We didn't see. We didn't bother."

01:23:29.829 --> 01:23:32.604
There should be alertness as to how much money is going where,

01:23:32.805 --> 01:23:37.024
where it is spent, how much you have got, this thing.

01:23:39.438 --> 01:23:44.004
You go to an ashram, you ask them:

01:23:44.205 --> 01:23:49.773
"Now, how much money you have got?"

01:23:49.974 --> 01:23:56.194
In short, you don't know how much money you have got.

01:23:56.395 --> 01:23:59.422
"No, Mother, You know we went to that place,

01:23:59.623 --> 01:24:04.295
and then we bought twenty tins of fish,

01:24:04.496 --> 01:24:06.430
so all money was exhausted." "But why?

01:24:06.631 --> 01:24:10.236
Why did you buy twenty tins of fish?"

01:24:10.437 --> 01:24:12.827
"Because the women said: 'You'd better buy twenty fish.'"

01:24:13.028 --> 01:24:14.442
"How many there are to eat?"

01:24:14.627 --> 01:24:16.922
Like that, they have no idea, no alertness,

01:24:17.123 --> 01:24:20.282
nothing, it's all a mess.

01:24:25.608 --> 01:24:29.608
What time people get up, what time they sleep,

01:24:29.791 --> 01:24:33.807
what time, what they do; there is no alertness about it,

01:24:34.008 --> 01:24:38.053
because in Sahaja Yoga you are your own guru.

01:24:38.254 --> 01:24:45.568
Everybody's guru. A Great Guru they are!

01:24:49.402 --> 01:24:52.321
You are your own guru, no doubt,

01:24:52.522 --> 01:24:56.396
but you must have that self-discipline.

01:24:57.446 --> 01:25:00.078
To be a guru you have to be

01:25:00.279 --> 01:25:05.192
self-disciplined and a determination,

01:25:05.393 --> 01:25:11.386
complete determination to rise higher,

01:25:11.587 --> 01:25:16.092
to ascend by whatever means it is possible,

01:25:16.293 --> 01:25:19.452
whatever is needed for your ascent.

01:25:19.723 --> 01:25:27.264
That's, is a sign of a person who will be a guru.

01:25:31.403 --> 01:25:37.484
There's no communication. There's a communication gap.

01:25:37.685 --> 01:25:40.510
There's no understanding of each other.

01:25:40.701 --> 01:25:43.516
There are problems. There's no emotional

01:25:43.717 --> 01:25:49.260
attachment to anyone. That's not an ashram.

01:25:52.057 --> 01:25:53.937
Another story I can tell you,

01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:55.998
because I have been in Gandhiji's ashram.

01:25:56.199 --> 01:25:59.498
Of course our ashram was nowhere like his.

01:25:59.699 --> 01:26:03.237
His ashram was.. You had to get up at four o'clock,

01:26:03.438 --> 01:26:06.244
take your bath with cold water,

01:26:06.445 --> 01:26:08.800
and go for the 'PRATHANA',

01:26:09.001 --> 01:26:12.548
and you would see all the snakes going round you.

01:26:12.749 --> 01:26:14.508
And when you are doing your 'PRATHANA' there,

01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:17.231
all the snakes, somebody might be sitting before you,

01:26:17.432 --> 01:26:22.937
doing like that, with you. But most snakes never bit anyone.

01:26:23.138 --> 01:26:25.352
You are not supposed to say anything.

01:26:25.553 --> 01:26:27.733
And best, this gentleman used to walk so fast,

01:26:27.934 --> 01:26:31.741
this Gandhiji, you see he was hardly he had any weight.

01:26:31.942 --> 01:26:33.564
So he used to just jump.

01:26:33.765 --> 01:26:35.638
That's how I learnt how to walk fast with him,

01:26:35.839 --> 01:26:39.273
because you had to walk, really run with him.

01:26:39.481 --> 01:26:47.179
And then, the food was all boiled, without any salt.

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.949
You could use salt if you wanted to,

01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:52.965
and then he would put some oil,

01:26:53.166 --> 01:26:55.859
which you may not like so much. If you wanted,

01:26:56.060 --> 01:27:00.002
you could have oil on top of that.

01:27:00.203 --> 01:27:02.684
He said: "You must make your tongue all right.

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:07.310
Why should your tongue ask for a particular type of a food?"

01:27:07.511 --> 01:27:09.422
He was worse than Zen, I tell you!

01:27:09.623 --> 01:27:13.788
Even Zen tried that very much with his disciples.

01:27:13.989 --> 01:27:17.641
He used to make things which were bitter,

01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:22.074
like quinine raised to power a-hundred-and-eight.

01:27:22.275 --> 01:27:25.713
Then to compensate it, the sweet was sugar,

01:27:25.914 --> 01:27:30.221
raised to power a-hundred-and-eight,

01:27:30.422 --> 01:27:33.503
so that your tongue is all right.

01:27:33.704 --> 01:27:36.868
So the training of the tongue,

01:27:37.069 --> 01:27:40.566
then [INAUDIBLE] what you speak.

01:27:40.767 --> 01:27:47.537
What do you say, are you just chatting?

01:27:47.738 --> 01:27:50.870
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:27:51.071 --> 01:27:55.426
Every word you say is a mantra.

01:28:00.101 --> 01:28:04.987
These ashrams are much higher and greater than

01:28:05.188 --> 01:28:11.362
all the ashrams of the world - even Gandhiji's ashram.

01:28:12.887 --> 01:28:20.965
Do you know that you are the instruments of God Almighty,

01:28:21.166 --> 01:28:26.615
and when you speak, every word of yours is a mantra?

01:28:26.816 --> 01:28:31.504
Whatever is your desire is the command.

01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:39.564
Unless and until you realize this, the alertness about it,

01:28:39.765 --> 01:28:44.772
our ashrams are just like orphanages.

01:28:48.674 --> 01:28:54.115
People like a leader to be sweet, sweetie-pie,

01:28:54.316 --> 01:28:58.512
so that they can eat very well. The leader.

01:28:58.713 --> 01:29:08.333
Or somebody overly strict comes in. He's another Hitler.

01:29:08.534 --> 01:29:17.231
There's no discretion that you have to be strict,

01:29:17.432 --> 01:29:26.432
at the same time you have to be loving, caring, protecting.

01:29:29.694 --> 01:29:36.098
Many things can be said in humor.

01:29:36.299 --> 01:29:41.332
That doesn't give such a sting to people.

01:29:41.533 --> 01:29:46.713
But a Sahaja Yogi should think,

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:55.135
highly honored that Mother is saying something to him,

01:29:55.336 --> 01:29:57.619
that you have to do this or do that,

01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:01.373
that She's so much bothered about you, about your family,

01:30:01.574 --> 01:30:07.597
about your children, about your ashram.

01:30:10.741 --> 01:30:16.572
So that alertness should be also in the

01:30:16.773 --> 01:30:23.348
minds of the men of the ashram: how to behave,

01:30:23.549 --> 01:30:29.850
how to talk, what to say.

01:30:30.517 --> 01:30:36.821
You are the mouthpieces of God Almighty.

01:30:37.022 --> 01:30:42.148
How can you waste your time chatting?

01:30:47.472 --> 01:30:55.755
So it is to be realized how to behave,

01:30:55.956 --> 01:31:02.358
for a person who is the mouthpiece of God.

01:31:02.559 --> 01:31:10.191
You represent Him, actually. How you should dress up,

01:31:10.392 --> 01:31:17.034
how you should walk, how you should sit, how you should eat.

01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:27.840
I was surprised that people are drinking beer in the ashram.

01:31:28.041 --> 01:31:30.419
I mean, it is non-alcoholic.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:36.245
But it's beer, made of molasses.

01:31:36.446 --> 01:31:40.793
But, anyway, it is beer.

01:31:40.994 --> 01:31:43.586
How can you drink that molasses business?

01:31:43.787 --> 01:31:46.915
Have you ever been near any sugar factory?

01:31:47.116 --> 01:31:53.172
The smell of the molasses! You are consuming that!

01:31:58.491 --> 01:32:06.099
So whatever you are eating, whatever you are spending,

01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:07.708
whatever you are talking,

01:32:07.909 --> 01:32:11.604
I mean whatever is the extroversion, whatever is outside,

01:32:11.805 --> 01:32:14.440
must express your inside.

01:32:19.324 --> 01:32:23.828
So you have to develop your Hamsa Chakra.

01:32:28.174 --> 01:32:32.015
Self-disciplining and introspection:

01:32:32.216 --> 01:32:35.793
"Why do I do such a thing, I am a Sahaja Yogi?"

01:32:35.994 --> 01:32:38.209
Ask this question every morning,

01:32:38.410 --> 01:32:41.796
and in the evening please note it down:

01:32:41.997 --> 01:32:45.395
"What did I do for Sahaja Yoga?"

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:59.016
We have fun. We have music. We have everything,

01:32:59.217 --> 01:33:06.238
but everything should be done in a dignified manner.

01:33:06.439 --> 01:33:10.631
Even dancing, I was saying, learn some rhythms.

01:33:10.832 --> 01:33:16.367
Otherwise somebody's doing the trot and another is galloping.

01:33:18.773 --> 01:33:23.437
That too like horses - looks so odd.

01:33:23.638 --> 01:33:26.064
There should be gentleness. There should be

01:33:26.265 --> 01:33:32.580
understanding of the rhythm and rhythmic patterns.

01:33:32.781 --> 01:33:37.336
Learn more, how would you dance?

01:33:37.537 --> 01:33:42.384
Practise it. It's all right, in the house.

01:33:42.648 --> 01:33:48.548
How the ladies should dance, how should they walk

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:53.770
because your whole expression

01:33:53.971 --> 01:34:01.399
is the expression of God Almighty.

01:34:04.524 --> 01:34:12.757
So how you should be among yourselves,

01:34:12.958 --> 01:34:19.567
how you should talk, when you should get up,

01:34:19.768 --> 01:34:25.478
when you should sleep.

01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:30.026
Everything will change if you really become

01:34:30.227 --> 01:34:37.957
aware of the fact that you are representing God Almighty,

01:34:38.158 --> 01:34:42.458
who is the Source of discretion.

01:34:46.448 --> 01:34:51.318
In discretion so many things you will learn.

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:59.098
The first is the tolerance. "It's all right.

01:34:59.299 --> 01:35:02.590
We'll work it out. It will work out."

01:35:02.791 --> 01:35:10.545
You will learn what is love, which is detached.

01:35:10.746 --> 01:35:14.849
You will learn what is humor,

01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:20.113
which tickles but does not hurt.

01:35:26.064 --> 01:35:31.328
You will learn also what to say in your lectures,

01:35:31.529 --> 01:35:38.018
what to listen to. And of all things,

01:35:38.219 --> 01:35:47.581
you will know how to fulfil the visions of God Almighty.

01:35:49.986 --> 01:35:54.558
Now today, I had to tell all these things, of course,

01:35:54.759 --> 01:35:58.320
is a part of Visshuddhi.

01:35:58.521 --> 01:36:03.044
But the other part of the Visshuddhi is that

01:36:03.245 --> 01:36:07.461
you are part and parcel of the whole,

01:36:07.662 --> 01:36:10.683
of the Virat and you become the oceans.

01:36:10.884 --> 01:36:18.751
So you have to be like oceans. Oceans in every way.

01:36:18.952 --> 01:36:26.617
That's how you will realize that this ocean of yours

01:36:26.818 --> 01:36:34.010
has no limits; not only the ocean,

01:36:34.211 --> 01:36:39.621
but the beauty of the ocean and the creativity of the ocean.

01:36:39.822 --> 01:36:45.335
Everything is within you which you have to utilize,

01:36:45.536 --> 01:36:51.636
which you have to develop, to manifest.

01:36:53.975 --> 01:36:58.077
Because if you are part and parcel of Virat,

01:36:58.278 --> 01:37:05.806
that you are the Virat, then how discreet you should be.

01:37:11.849 --> 01:37:23.654
I hope all of you will know that

01:37:23.855 --> 01:37:33.018
your behavior has to be of a level, not superficial,

01:37:33.219 --> 01:37:42.421
not cheapish, not greedy, of course not lusty;

01:37:45.202 --> 01:37:52.656
but dignified, saintly, royal, magnificent,

01:37:52.857 --> 01:37:57.723
beautiful and joy-giving.

01:37:57.924 --> 01:38:00.411
May God bless you all.
