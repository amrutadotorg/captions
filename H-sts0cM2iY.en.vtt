00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.947
We all can change and inform each other

00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:15.185
and improve and educate ourselves.

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.441
All this education can come to us,

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:19.257
if we
really love ourselves,

00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:21.445
and care for our evolution.

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:23.833
We don’t have to bother about it much,

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:25.880
if we really care for it.

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.112
Gradually, all these things will work out

00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:32.369
and the balance can be established.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.203
Those people who talk too much,

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.701
should not
talk so much.

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:41.737
What I feel that when you talk too much, when you stop, you just stop.

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:45.435
It is in between: when it is necessary
you must talk,

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:49.317
when it is not necessary you should not talk.

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:52.345
So that kind of personality gradually

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:54.762
you can develop with Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:54.843 --> 00:00:58.669
that you will develop that wisdom

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.203
how far to go, how far not to go.

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:05.468
Not to go is the quality of Shiva.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.016
He doesn’t do anything, He is just sitting down there

00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:11.450
and watching the whole joke.

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:17.262
He doesn’t do anything, but still,

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:18.751
He’s the one who has to watch:

00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:24.393
if He doesn’t watch, then the whole show is over.

00:01:25.488 --> 00:01:28.748
If you understand that in not doing anything,

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:31.702
how much He’s doing!

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:35.611
See the contrast: He’s doing nothing as such.

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:39.840
But He’s making everybody dance, to please Him.

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:44.648
In the same way, in one shot you have both the natures:

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:50.678
as Sahaja Yogis you can achieve that kind of a balanced personality.

00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:57.698
It is for your good, for your evolution, for your development.

00:01:57.908 --> 00:02:02.013
So today, all of you have a great chance of evolving

00:02:02.214 --> 00:02:05.662
individually within yourself the Shiva tattwa,

00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:12.740
which ultimately permeates into the whole.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.966
Kabira has said it in a beautiful couplet,

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:18.619
I don’t know if you people have understood,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.266
which is: “Man mamta ko Thir kar launga”.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:29.910
"The compassion of my heart I will vibrate, I will bring it out;

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:36.632
the compassion of my heart I will vibrate, I’ll bring it out;

00:02:36.827 --> 00:02:39.062
“Aur paancho tattwa milaunga”,

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:42.348
and put it into the five elements."

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.917
See Kabira, do you follow him how great he is?

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.241
People talk of Kabir Das, see, he says that,

00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:52.705
“Take it out of the heart and put it into all the five elements.”

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:55.726
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:55.927 --> 00:03:00.771
If you understand that, then you don’t have to understand anything else.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:04.771
You have got it in your heart, become the capitalist in your heart,

00:03:04.972 --> 00:03:07.805
and become a communist outside.

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:13.049
If you can achieve this balance properly, you have done it.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.448
And we can do it, we all of us put together 
we will do it, we can achieve it;

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.320
and we can show to the world that everyone can achieve it.

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:29.481
All ordinary human beings so-called 
will, can become extraordinary.
