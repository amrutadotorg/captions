WEBVTT

00:07.960 --> 00:11.947
We all can change and inform each other

00:12.027 --> 00:15.185
and improve and educate ourselves.

00:15.266 --> 00:17.441
All this education can come to us,

00:17.521 --> 00:19.257
if we
really love ourselves,

00:19.338 --> 00:21.445
and care for our evolution.

00:21.526 --> 00:23.833
We don’t have to bother about it much,

00:23.913 --> 00:25.880
if we really care for it.

00:25.961 --> 00:28.112
Gradually, all these things will work out

00:28.192 --> 00:32.369
and the balance can be established.

00:32.450 --> 00:35.203
Those people who talk too much,

00:35.289 --> 00:37.701
should not
talk so much.

00:37.783 --> 00:41.737
What I feel that when you talk too much, when you stop, you just stop.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.435
It is in between: when it is necessary
you must talk,

00:45.636 --> 00:49.317
when it is not necessary you should not talk.

00:49.518 --> 00:52.345
So that kind of personality gradually

00:52.425 --> 00:54.762
you can develop with Sahaja Yoga,

00:54.843 --> 00:58.669
that you will develop that wisdom

00:58.749 --> 01:02.203
how far to go, how far not to go.

01:02.404 --> 01:05.468
Not to go is the quality of Shiva.

01:05.549 --> 01:09.016
He doesn’t do anything, He is just sitting down there

01:09.096 --> 01:11.450
and watching the whole joke.

01:11.531 --> 01:17.262
He doesn’t do anything, but still,

01:17.342 --> 01:18.751
He’s the one who has to watch:

01:18.952 --> 01:24.393
if He doesn’t watch, then the whole show is over.

01:25.488 --> 01:28.748
If you understand that in not doing anything,

01:28.835 --> 01:31.702
how much He’s doing!

01:32.402 --> 01:35.611
See the contrast: He’s doing nothing as such.

01:35.812 --> 01:39.840
But He’s making everybody dance, to please Him.

01:40.713 --> 01:44.648
In the same way, in one shot you have both the natures:

01:44.849 --> 01:50.678
as Sahaja Yogis you can achieve that kind of a balanced personality.

01:50.907 --> 01:57.698
It is for your good, for your evolution, for your development.

01:57.908 --> 02:02.013
So today, all of you have a great chance of evolving

02:02.214 --> 02:05.662
individually within yourself the Shiva tattwa,

02:05.863 --> 02:12.740
which ultimately permeates into the whole.

02:13.629 --> 02:15.966
Kabira has said it in a beautiful couplet,

02:16.046 --> 02:18.619
I don’t know if you people have understood,

02:18.820 --> 02:23.266
which is: “Man mamta ko Thir kar launga”.

02:23.467 --> 02:29.910
"The compassion of my heart I will vibrate, I will bring it out;

02:30.117 --> 02:36.632
the compassion of my heart I will vibrate, I’ll bring it out;

02:36.827 --> 02:39.062
“Aur paancho tattwa milaunga”,

02:39.142 --> 02:42.348
and put it into the five elements."

02:42.429 --> 02:44.917
See Kabira, do you follow him how great he is?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.241
People talk of Kabir Das, see, he says that,

02:47.442 --> 02:52.705
“Take it out of the heart and put it into all the five elements.”

02:52.921 --> 02:55.726
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

02:55.927 --> 03:00.771
If you understand that, then you don’t have to understand anything else.

03:00.972 --> 03:04.771
You have got it in your heart, become the capitalist in your heart,

03:04.972 --> 03:07.805
and become a communist outside.

03:08.041 --> 03:13.049
If you can achieve this balance properly, you have done it.

03:13.250 --> 03:19.448
And we can do it, we all of us put together
we will do it, we can achieve it;

03:19.529 --> 03:23.320
and we can show to the world that everyone can achieve it.

03:23.401 --> 03:29.481
All ordinary human beings so-called
will, can become extraordinary.
