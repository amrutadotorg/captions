00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:26.918
Welcome to you all.

00:02:44.084 --> 00:02:50.403
It has been little bit delayed but just
now they have informed Me that

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:55.422
the plane is delayed even much more, so I
thought it’s better to have the puja now,

00:02:55.623 --> 00:02:58.095
though the English had told us that
they would like

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.811
to attend from the very beginning.

00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:05.745
They always get many more pujas,
that may be the reason.

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:24.947
So now we have all arrived here and we
are going to start this pilgrimage

00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:33.215
of travelling together.

00:03:35.874 --> 00:03:47.654
The journey is of a very subtle nature

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:55.796
and, if we realize why we are here,
we’ll understand

00:03:55.997 --> 00:04:05.698
that all this Creation is watching you all

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:12.545
and it’s trying to help you that you
should ascend

00:04:12.746 --> 00:04:19.936
and that you feel your depth and thus
enjoy your Self.

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:27.031
The travel may not be very comfortable.

00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:35.398
The roads are

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:47.480
so very filled with speed-breakers

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:53.169
and all kinds of obstructions.

00:04:53.716 --> 00:04:59.310
Is a journey like of our ascent I felt,

00:05:00.322 --> 00:05:06.013
that our speed has to be brought down.

00:05:07.138 --> 00:05:14.276
In the West we have become very speedy,
no doubt,

00:05:14.477 --> 00:05:22.748
and to bring down this speed we have to use

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:37.724
meditative process that we feel our peace
within ourselves.

00:05:41.962 --> 00:05:48.276
Also the thoughts are bombarding our minds

00:05:49.803 --> 00:05:56.577
and we react very fast

00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:05.333
to others and to these thoughts.

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:12.117
So one has to be aware,

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:20.881
one has to be knowing what is happening
within yourself,

00:06:24.044 --> 00:06:29.016
that the thoughts are bombarding you,

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:34.450
you are trying to ascend

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:43.787
and you find it very difficult to get rid
of the thoughts.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.825
The thought process can start

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:58.850
by your conditioning or by your ego –
only two problems.

00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:11.563
And you are the one who is under
the challenge.

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:21.143
So you have got these simple people
in the village

00:07:23.187 --> 00:07:31.668
who start watching everything but
they do not react.

00:07:32.625 --> 00:07:39.612
If you do not react then your thoughts
will give up.

00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:51.576
So the first thing should be to watch
yourself that you are not reacting,

00:07:54.118 --> 00:08:01.528
but you are experiencing and enjoying
the silence,

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:09.028
the subtleties, the beauty, the glory

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:15.765
of your being as well as whatever is
around you.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:23.305
You don’t have to force yourself to break
this habit,

00:08:26.213 --> 00:08:30.638
but just to be on the watch-out.

00:08:33.258 --> 00:08:39.417
It’s not necessary to talk too much
about it also,

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:46.743
nor it is necessary

00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:55.729
to think about anything.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:02.268
Because supposing you see a tree –
so it’s a tree only.

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:06.039
What are we going to think about it?

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.673
And whatever we may think about it,
it’s going to be the tree!

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:20.084
So there’s no harm in appearing little bit
stupid – doesn’t matter.

00:09:20.285 --> 00:09:27.020
But this is the basic thing, is, that when
we start analyzing,

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:32.427
we are breaking our own nerves,

00:09:32.824 --> 00:09:40.863
and poisoning our own mind and brain.

00:09:43.526 --> 00:09:52.597
So to watch something without analysis,
without thinking about it, is reality.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.040
If you can achieve that point where
you watch everything

00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:04.975
without reacting, you are in reality,

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:21.197
and then only the penetration into
the subtleties of your surroundings,

00:10:21.398 --> 00:10:26.379
of your relationships, your friendships

00:10:28.992 --> 00:10:35.596
the whole universe, dawns upon you.

00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:42.927
That’s why I’ve said that in this
pilgrimage

00:10:43.128 --> 00:10:51.188
the first thing we have to remember [is]
that we have to be aware ourselves.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:56.091
But when you are only thinking about
others,

00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:59.975
how others have to behave: “They should
do like this!” -

00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:07.265
that leave it to your leaders to break
their heads, that’s not your job.

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:13.006
It’s a headache for them I know, but they
have to do it, it’s all right.

00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:18.665
But why do you want to break your heads
for nothing at all?

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:24.584
So to judge others, to think of others,

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:30.702
what they are doing, what’s wrong
with them,

00:11:32.245 --> 00:11:42.388
about anything whatsoever you may think
is wrong – is not going to be corrected.

00:11:43.442 --> 00:11:48.484
Like I know some people who are specially
bureaucrats,

00:11:48.685 --> 00:11:52.949
they are travelling, supposing, by the car.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:12:00.656
Then they will say, “I think, you see,
this road should have gone this way”,

00:12:00.857 --> 00:12:05.778
or “I think it would have been nice if this
house was facing the other way” –

00:12:05.979 --> 00:12:13.242
but it’s not, you see? It is not going
to face [that way].

00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:21.153
It is going to be the way it is, so what is
the use of wasting your brain,

00:12:21.354 --> 00:12:30.742
your mind, your thought, in suggesting
something which doesn’t work out,

00:12:30.943 --> 00:12:34.591
and never going to work out either.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.863
So when we start like, “I think

00:12:40.604 --> 00:12:46.785
these trees should have been little
taller” – but they are not!

00:12:49.194 --> 00:12:51.759
“I think

00:12:56.397 --> 00:13:04.257
that the crows should stop their noise” –
they will not.

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:13.211
So just accept it. Acceptance is the way

00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:20.380
we are going to enjoy. But acceptance
doesn’t mean tolerance,

00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:26.787
because tolerance means you have
to work very hard

00:13:26.988 --> 00:13:30.942
to accept that the trees are of the same
height –

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:34.168
they can’t grow – it’s too much for you.

00:13:34.369 --> 00:13:40.549
When you say, “I have to tolerate it,
you see, because my mind doesn’t accept.”

00:13:46.637 --> 00:13:53.134
So acceptance as it is whatever you see,
acceptance.

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:57.463
And that is how people grow I have seen,
those who start accepting.

00:13:57.664 --> 00:14:05.074
That’s the sign. That’s the sign of their
strength and their depth.

00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:12.360
Like the propensity of this Mother Earth,
She is what She is.

00:14:16.954 --> 00:14:21.863
And She bears whatever is there.

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:33.452
If you put a heavy thing on Her, She’ll put
equal and opposite force and bear it.

00:14:33.653 --> 00:14:39.576
She doesn’t say, “I’m tolerating it,
I am exerting any pressure”.

00:14:39.777 --> 00:14:43.202
But She is just accepting.

00:14:46.446 --> 00:14:52.600
So the witnessing and awareness develops

00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:58.195
when we start just accepting things
as they are.

00:14:59.203 --> 00:15:03.264
“I think” doesn’t work out.

00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:11.978
“I think it would have been better like
this” doesn’t work out.

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:19.369
Then second problem is “I like”.

00:15:21.611 --> 00:15:28.751
Now, “I like to eat a cake” - but there is
no cake, what to do?

00:15:31.114 --> 00:15:36.044
Now, whatever is there, enjoy it as a cake.

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:44.965
But if you go on thinking like that –
“I like whatever is not here” –

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:49.787
you can never be happy, as simple as that.

00:15:49.988 --> 00:15:57.661
You have to say, “I like whatever is there.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:04.850
I enjoy whatever is there”. Then that’s
the reality.

00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:12.759
Whatever doesn’t exist, if you like it,

00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:18.932
so what can anybody do about it?

00:16:22.623 --> 00:16:29.146
It works out in so many ways, in so many
facets in life,

00:16:29.347 --> 00:16:37.871
that advantage is taken by people because
we become so vulnerable

00:16:38.072 --> 00:16:43.472
to our likes and dislikes that
the entrepreneurs take over

00:16:43.673 --> 00:16:50.313
and they create likes and dislikes
in our heads, and put ideas every day.

00:16:50.514 --> 00:16:53.601
I’ve seen it now, how they do it,

00:16:53.772 --> 00:16:57.948
through television, through newspapers,
through this, that.

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:02.312
So then you say, “Now, I like this”.

00:17:03.609 --> 00:17:07.508
But from where this liking has come

00:17:07.717 --> 00:17:12.876
is the conditioning which is put
into your head.

00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:22.080
So you are a slave of that conditioning.

00:17:25.392 --> 00:17:34.580
“I only like roses and I don’t like
any other flower”.

00:17:34.781 --> 00:17:42.601
But why? Why you don’t like any
other flower?

00:17:47.336 --> 00:17:55.814
And for such things whatever we have
we miss the joy.

00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:06.992
So the second part should be that,
“Enjoy everything.”

00:18:10.553 --> 00:18:13.793
“Why am I here?

00:18:17.748 --> 00:18:27.411
It’s not a very comfortable place
by any chance, so why am I here?”

00:18:31.262 --> 00:18:35.483
To enjoy each other.

00:18:38.172 --> 00:18:41.812
To enjoy your own being.

00:18:42.013 --> 00:18:50.420
The more divergence you have outside,
appealing to your ego and conditioning,

00:18:50.684 --> 00:18:55.367
the more your mind is busy with that,

00:18:58.448 --> 00:19:06.444
then you cannot enjoy anything.

00:19:09.484 --> 00:19:14.397
So come to the other conditioning which
is very subtle

00:19:16.082 --> 00:19:22.317
that, “I’m an Englishman”, or
“I’m an American”,

00:19:22.518 --> 00:19:33.569
or maybe even “I’m from Derbyshire”,
and then “I’m from another shire”,

00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:38.998
and then “better form a group”.

00:19:41.827 --> 00:19:45.418
The grouping starts.

00:19:46.188 --> 00:19:53.474
In a subtle way it is a kind
of an insecurity.

00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:02.301
So we start clubbing.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.360
Animals do that very often, they have
to do it

00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:12.126
because their sense of insecurity
is quite a lot.

00:20:12.327 --> 00:20:17.046
And then human beings also do it -

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:22.805
but not the saints, not the angels.

00:20:23.178 --> 00:20:28.423
They don’t form [groups] because they have
no nationality.

00:20:29.769 --> 00:20:33.889
Nationality is also a conditioning.

00:20:36.433 --> 00:20:42.273
They don’t belong to any one place,
to any one country.

00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:47.785
So now those who have come by plane,
had to come,

00:20:47.986 --> 00:20:54.197
because from every country there’s
one plane by which they come,

00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:02.345
must know one thing – that now we have
landed,

00:21:02.586 --> 00:21:10.651
and we are all Sahaj Yogis here,
and forget your countries.

00:21:11.509 --> 00:21:19.116
Forget them and mix up with other people.

00:21:19.317 --> 00:21:25.362
Please do not form groups. There is no need
at all to form groups.

00:21:25.563 --> 00:21:33.383
So I would request you that in the buses,
because it starts from the airport

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:39.454
you start forming groups and it continues
till the end you go back.

00:21:39.655 --> 00:21:47.036
I think it would be a nice idea to break
that, and let people sit

00:21:47.237 --> 00:21:55.559
together of different countries and
different nationalities.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.286
And talk to each other, try to know
about each other,

00:22:00.487 --> 00:22:03.226
try to find out about each other.

00:22:03.427 --> 00:22:09.810
Not just what you know from the newspaper,

00:22:10.011 --> 00:22:15.714
but the different problems of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:15.915 --> 00:22:19.630
what are the problems of Sahaja Yoga
in a particular country,

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:23.908
what happens in a particular country.

00:22:25.853 --> 00:22:34.370
The worst of all is the conditioning
of reading also.

00:22:41.728 --> 00:22:47.218
Reading without light is useless,

00:22:47.726 --> 00:22:52.616
and some people still have a habit

00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:58.905
of remembering something they have read

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.936
and a kind of a show-off as they say.

00:23:07.306 --> 00:23:15.835
Is better to listen to others.
Let others talk.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:24.989
In Sahaja Yoga on what subject
you’ll discuss?

00:23:25.284 --> 00:23:30.476
I don’t know, how can you discuss
on anything?

00:23:30.677 --> 00:23:37.979
Now you see this one as a green thing.

00:23:39.275 --> 00:23:42.623
Now, what can you discuss on this?

00:23:42.824 --> 00:23:48.344
You will say, “All right, it’s green, but…
there is so”.

00:23:48.545 --> 00:23:53.717
Then another one says, “No, this is green,
but…”.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:59.255
One may go on like that, madly.

00:23:59.913 --> 00:24:04.296
There is no need to discuss in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:04.497 --> 00:24:07.698
I just don’t know what are we going
to discuss. You know everything,

00:24:07.899 --> 00:24:11.798
you know how Kundalini rises, you know
how chakras are cleared out,

00:24:11.999 --> 00:24:16.102
you know how you get realization,
you all know who’s, who catches,

00:24:16.303 --> 00:24:21.871
what, and you know that how it affects.

00:24:22.072 --> 00:24:28.537
Now, if that is the fact, if that is
the truth, that is what it is,

00:24:28.738 --> 00:24:32.646
what are we going to discuss about it?

00:24:33.512 --> 00:24:36.896
Discussions are over now.

00:24:37.741 --> 00:24:44.685
You are gnostics, you are knowledgeable
people. You have the knowledge.

00:24:44.985 --> 00:24:49.767
But the knowledge that you have is shared
by everyone of you.

00:24:49.968 --> 00:24:55.170
At the most, you can talk about
your experiences,

00:24:55.371 --> 00:25:04.450
you can talk about your relationships,
how you have enjoyed.

00:25:05.286 --> 00:25:09.500
But there is nothing to discuss
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:09.701 --> 00:25:14.135
I’ve heard about people who are discussing.

00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:19.625
I just don’t know how can there be
a discussion about Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:23.210
I would be very happy to know, if you can
tell Me,

00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:27.260
how we can discuss about Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:32.379 --> 00:25:37.921
So we have to remember that whatever
we talk, we should talk

00:25:38.122 --> 00:25:45.079
about our experiences, about our enjoyments,
our happiness, everything.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:53.891
And not to discuss it and analyze it,
because that would kill the joy completely.

00:25:55.702 --> 00:25:59.173
There’s no joy in it.

00:25:59.374 --> 00:26:03.930
Discussion is just trying to show that
you know better than the other,

00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:10.569
or you can give another opinion. In Sahaja
Yoga there is no another opinion.

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:18.171
If somebody has a Nabhi, he has a Nabhi,
what another opinion you can have?

00:26:20.985 --> 00:26:30.080
So then we finish with different kinds
of arguments and discussions and things.

00:26:30.281 --> 00:26:36.696
Maybe somebody goes off the track, maybe.

00:26:36.923 --> 00:26:42.658
But you all know he is going off the track,
so what’s the use of discussing it?

00:26:43.376 --> 00:26:46.744
You all know what he is talking is off
the track, so it’s all right.

00:26:46.945 --> 00:26:50.456
You come to the conclusion, “Yeah, we know,
we know, we know”.

00:26:50.657 --> 00:26:56.643
But to discuss it out, there is no need.

00:26:56.844 --> 00:27:02.944
Once you know and it is in your awareness,
the Paramchaitanya will take care of it

00:27:03.145 --> 00:27:06.986
and you won’t have to bother at all

00:27:07.187 --> 00:27:12.375
how to correct, how to mend it, what to do.

00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:20.733
That’s not your work. You just leave it
to Paramchaitanya and it will work out.

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:27.819
So here we have come because this country
has been very much blessed

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:35.766
by so many saints and yogis, and you can
see it in the people how they are.

00:27:36.783 --> 00:27:41.668
And that’s why, despite all poverty,
despite all kinds of discomforts,

00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:51.104
and despite the fact that they have not
known any Western great things,

00:27:51.305 --> 00:27:55.397
they are not bothered.

00:27:57.362 --> 00:28:02.838
I went to Russia, of course Russia was
great and so many got realization.

00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:09.712
And I was really surprised how these people
have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:28:11.202 --> 00:28:18.781
and accepted it. But one part was
very funny,

00:28:18.982 --> 00:28:23.693
which was I would say, like the villagers
of this country.

00:28:23.894 --> 00:28:30.692
Those who are still not so matured would
not come to Sahaja Yoga as such,

00:28:30.913 --> 00:28:36.775
but the difference of their character
was really remarkable,

00:28:36.976 --> 00:28:41.527
because - you are going by a taxi.

00:28:41.781 --> 00:28:47.985
So the taxi fellow says, “Have you got
a Marlboro cigarette with you?”.

00:28:49.424 --> 00:28:51.949
I said, “What is that? I have never
known of it”.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:58.058
“No, if you have one then we’ll take you
free, or we’ll charge you very little”.

00:28:58.259 --> 00:29:01.571
But an Indian will never say such a thing,
he doesn’t know all these things,

00:29:01.772 --> 00:29:04.575
he’s not bothered.

00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:08.822
But if an Indian taxi fellow is going,
he’ll say,

00:29:09.023 --> 00:29:13.440
“Have you got a photograph of Mataji
with you?”.

00:29:18.526 --> 00:29:21.358
That’s a big difference!

00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:34.182
In every aspect I have seen that this
another -

00:29:34.383 --> 00:29:39.163
like there are villagers here, people who
are not Sahaja Yogis,

00:29:39.364 --> 00:29:43.193
but they respect, they respect the saint.

00:29:43.394 --> 00:29:47.786
To them saint is more important than
anything else.

00:29:49.312 --> 00:29:54.388
Nobody will ask you for anything – never!

00:29:54.673 --> 00:29:58.972
Even if you want to give them, they will
not accept.

00:30:01.062 --> 00:30:05.271
They may cheat you, some people who
are selling things,

00:30:05.472 --> 00:30:09.432
but they will never ask from you that,
“You give me this, you give me that”,

00:30:09.633 --> 00:30:12.390
that’s not done.

00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:19.199
So the, basically I think there is a
difference which we should understand,

00:30:19.571 --> 00:30:29.321
that materialism works much faster
in the West than in India, much faster.

00:30:30.845 --> 00:30:37.933
And one has to be careful on that point.
I’m bringing you down to that point now -

00:30:39.055 --> 00:30:45.926
that, are we getting lost into materialism?

00:30:49.489 --> 00:30:51.887
Of course you know I’m a great shopper,

00:30:52.088 --> 00:30:56.863
I have to go on shopping, shopping,
shopping, shopping.

00:30:57.064 --> 00:31:02.690
And I shop for all of you, and I have been
shopping, no doubt.

00:31:03.756 --> 00:31:10.205
But the difference between My shopping
and the shopping of so many is this –

00:31:10.406 --> 00:31:14.067
that if I’m shopping I am going there

00:31:14.268 --> 00:31:18.348
because I know I’ll get things much
cheaper, much better.

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:23.767
All the good things will be there available
because I’m there – I’m sure of that;

00:31:23.968 --> 00:31:29.481
and all the best qualities will be
available very easily,

00:31:30.404 --> 00:31:37.490
and that I will be able to get things

00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:43.248
for people, because I’ll remember all
of them for whom I have to buy.

00:31:43.782 --> 00:31:47.047
It always happens like that.

00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:54.299
When I go out for shopping, even if I have
to face four hundred people,

00:31:54.500 --> 00:32:01.021
I get the things there all right.
That’s why I have to go.

00:32:03.717 --> 00:32:08.996
All right, if you have to go then you have
to think, “What we are going to buy?”.

00:32:09.197 --> 00:32:14.603
I have seen invariably Sahaja Yogis
will buy

00:32:14.804 --> 00:32:18.730
things for non-Sahaja Yogis, always,
mostly.

00:32:18.931 --> 00:32:24.149
“I’m buying for my mother, my sister
who is against Sahaja Yoga”.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:29.065
Why should you buy for somebody who is
against Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:29.266 --> 00:32:34.724
Even if they might be your nearest
relations,

00:32:35.969 --> 00:32:39.411
do you think they deserve it?

00:32:41.804 --> 00:32:47.713
So then we have to know that we are
one body,

00:32:47.914 --> 00:32:51.240
and as this hand must look after
the other hand,

00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:55.649
when we go out shopping or do anything,
we should always think

00:32:55.850 --> 00:33:00.908
what we are going to buy for other
Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.166
Of course, I have told you that, unless
and until somebody is your sister

00:33:04.367 --> 00:33:08.917
by rakhi or anything, you need not give
presents.

00:33:10.175 --> 00:33:15.139
But women can buy for women, men can
buy for men.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:19.111
Just understand one small thing –

00:33:19.312 --> 00:33:23.337
that the matter is for expression
of our love, that’s all.

00:33:23.538 --> 00:33:28.829
It has no other meaning. I don’t find
any meaning into it.

00:33:32.574 --> 00:33:35.933
So instead of buying for… when we,
people travel from here

00:33:36.134 --> 00:33:41.680
they go as traders, I’ve seen. Of course
you come as traders also –

00:33:41.881 --> 00:33:48.530
but that’s something Dharmic. But when
you go from here you go as traders,

00:33:48.731 --> 00:33:52.092
and for whom are you buying?

00:33:53.879 --> 00:34:00.433
Your relationships are no more with
anybody else but Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:00.634 --> 00:34:04.247
and only Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:07.872 --> 00:34:11.596
Whether they are Indians,

00:34:12.973 --> 00:34:20.297
English, Chinese, Swiss, French, Spanish,

00:34:21.077 --> 00:34:33.483
Germans, anything they may think to be,
they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:33.684 --> 00:34:40.586
and they are born in the land which
we call as the Kingdom of God.

00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:43.772
So please be careful on this point.

00:34:43.973 --> 00:34:49.349
Today being the first day I wanted to
explain to you everything in such a manner

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.409
that you remember that we are
on a pilgrimage,

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:58.102
and all of us should be able to grow
our awareness.

00:34:58.303 --> 00:35:03.284
If you cannot grow your awareness
it is useless.

00:35:07.226 --> 00:35:11.887
Once you start thinking like that,
you’ll be surprised

00:35:12.088 --> 00:35:16.520
how much you will gain and how much
you’ll achieve.

00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:25.466
There are no do’s and don’ts
in Sahaja Yoga, really,

00:35:25.667 --> 00:35:31.192
and I don’t think we have much disciplining
either, of any kind.

00:35:31.393 --> 00:35:36.327
But it is Sahaja Yoga which somehow
or other disciplines you,

00:35:36.528 --> 00:35:40.314
I don’t have to tell you anything.
It’s like the fire,

00:35:40.515 --> 00:35:45.502
if you put your hand into the fire it will
burn you, whether you like it or not.

00:35:45.703 --> 00:35:51.471
In the same way, if you do anything asahaj,
you will have to pay for it.

00:35:51.672 --> 00:35:55.277
So you know definitely that you don’t
want to lose your vibrations,

00:35:55.478 --> 00:35:59.024
you don’t want to become unhappy.

00:35:59.225 --> 00:36:03.671
But this time with a very deeper
understanding and reverence

00:36:03.872 --> 00:36:09.982
to your Self and to your ascent,

00:36:10.183 --> 00:36:23.686
you have to take a very joyful,
serious attitude.

00:36:24.203 --> 00:36:30.759
I’m sure this time you all are going
to just enjoy your Self.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.801
May God bless you.
