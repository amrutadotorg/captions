WEBVTT

02:23.358 --> 02:26.918
Welcome to you all.

02:44.084 --> 02:50.403
It has been little bit delayed but just
now they have informed Me that

02:50.604 --> 02:55.422
the plane is delayed even much more, so I
thought it’s better to have the puja now,

02:55.623 --> 02:58.095
though the English had told us that
they would like

02:58.296 --> 03:00.811
to attend from the very beginning.

03:01.012 --> 03:05.745
They always get many more pujas,
that may be the reason.

03:16.736 --> 03:24.947
So now we have all arrived here and we
are going to start this pilgrimage

03:26.241 --> 03:33.215
of travelling together.

03:35.874 --> 03:47.654
The journey is of a very subtle nature

03:48.327 --> 03:55.796
and, if we realize why we are here,
we’ll understand

03:55.997 --> 04:05.698
that all this Creation is watching you all

04:06.413 --> 04:12.545
and it’s trying to help you that you
should ascend

04:12.746 --> 04:19.936
and that you feel your depth and thus
enjoy your Self.

04:22.074 --> 04:27.031
The travel may not be very comfortable.

04:27.253 --> 04:35.398
The roads are

04:39.239 --> 04:47.480
so very filled with speed-breakers

04:47.829 --> 04:53.169
and all kinds of obstructions.

04:53.716 --> 04:59.310
Is a journey like of our ascent I felt,

05:00.322 --> 05:06.013
that our speed has to be brought down.

05:07.138 --> 05:14.276
In the West we have become very speedy,
no doubt,

05:14.477 --> 05:22.748
and to bring down this speed we have to use

05:26.875 --> 05:37.724
meditative process that we feel our peace
within ourselves.

05:41.962 --> 05:48.276
Also the thoughts are bombarding our minds

05:49.803 --> 05:56.577
and we react very fast

06:00.731 --> 06:05.333
to others and to these thoughts.

06:07.693 --> 06:12.117
So one has to be aware,

06:13.779 --> 06:20.881
one has to be knowing what is happening
within yourself,

06:24.044 --> 06:29.016
that the thoughts are bombarding you,

06:29.466 --> 06:34.450
you are trying to ascend

06:35.795 --> 06:43.787
and you find it very difficult to get rid
of the thoughts.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.825
The thought process can start

06:52.712 --> 06:58.850
by your conditioning or by your ego –
only two problems.

07:05.993 --> 07:11.563
And you are the one who is under
the challenge.

07:16.449 --> 07:21.143
So you have got these simple people
in the village

07:23.187 --> 07:31.668
who start watching everything but
they do not react.

07:32.625 --> 07:39.612
If you do not react then your thoughts
will give up.

07:41.572 --> 07:51.576
So the first thing should be to watch
yourself that you are not reacting,

07:54.118 --> 08:01.528
but you are experiencing and enjoying
the silence,

08:02.450 --> 08:09.028
the subtleties, the beauty, the glory

08:09.229 --> 08:15.765
of your being as well as whatever is
around you.

08:18.139 --> 08:23.305
You don’t have to force yourself to break
this habit,

08:26.213 --> 08:30.638
but just to be on the watch-out.

08:33.258 --> 08:39.417
It’s not necessary to talk too much
about it also,

08:43.139 --> 08:46.743
nor it is necessary

08:51.201 --> 08:55.729
to think about anything.

08:55.930 --> 09:02.268
Because supposing you see a tree –
so it’s a tree only.

09:02.469 --> 09:06.039
What are we going to think about it?

09:06.240 --> 09:11.673
And whatever we may think about it,
it’s going to be the tree!

09:14.488 --> 09:20.084
So there’s no harm in appearing little bit
stupid – doesn’t matter.

09:20.285 --> 09:27.020
But this is the basic thing, is, that when
we start analyzing,

09:27.221 --> 09:32.427
we are breaking our own nerves,

09:32.824 --> 09:40.863
and poisoning our own mind and brain.

09:43.526 --> 09:52.597
So to watch something without analysis,
without thinking about it, is reality.

09:55.610 --> 10:00.040
If you can achieve that point where
you watch everything

10:00.241 --> 10:04.975
without reacting, you are in reality,

10:10.077 --> 10:21.197
and then only the penetration into
the subtleties of your surroundings,

10:21.398 --> 10:26.379
of your relationships, your friendships

10:28.992 --> 10:35.596
the whole universe, dawns upon you.

10:38.743 --> 10:42.927
That’s why I’ve said that in this
pilgrimage

10:43.128 --> 10:51.188
the first thing we have to remember [is]
that we have to be aware ourselves.

10:51.389 --> 10:56.091
But when you are only thinking about
others,

10:56.292 --> 10:59.975
how others have to behave: “They should
do like this!” -

11:00.176 --> 11:07.265
that leave it to your leaders to break
their heads, that’s not your job.

11:07.868 --> 11:13.006
It’s a headache for them I know, but they
have to do it, it’s all right.

11:13.207 --> 11:18.665
But why do you want to break your heads
for nothing at all?

11:20.596 --> 11:24.584
So to judge others, to think of others,

11:24.785 --> 11:30.702
what they are doing, what’s wrong
with them,

11:32.245 --> 11:42.388
about anything whatsoever you may think
is wrong – is not going to be corrected.

11:43.442 --> 11:48.484
Like I know some people who are specially
bureaucrats,

11:48.685 --> 11:52.949
they are travelling, supposing, by the car.

11:53.150 --> 12:00.656
Then they will say, “I think, you see,
this road should have gone this way”,

12:00.857 --> 12:05.778
or “I think it would have been nice if this
house was facing the other way” –

12:05.979 --> 12:13.242
but it’s not, you see? It is not going
to face [that way].

12:13.655 --> 12:21.153
It is going to be the way it is, so what is
the use of wasting your brain,

12:21.354 --> 12:30.742
your mind, your thought, in suggesting
something which doesn’t work out,

12:30.943 --> 12:34.591
and never going to work out either.

12:35.780 --> 12:39.863
So when we start like, “I think

12:40.604 --> 12:46.785
these trees should have been little
taller” – but they are not!

12:49.194 --> 12:51.759
“I think

12:56.397 --> 13:04.257
that the crows should stop their noise” –
they will not.

13:06.579 --> 13:13.211
So just accept it. Acceptance is the way

13:14.267 --> 13:20.380
we are going to enjoy. But acceptance
doesn’t mean tolerance,

13:20.581 --> 13:26.787
because tolerance means you have
to work very hard

13:26.988 --> 13:30.942
to accept that the trees are of the same
height –

13:31.143 --> 13:34.168
they can’t grow – it’s too much for you.

13:34.369 --> 13:40.549
When you say, “I have to tolerate it,
you see, because my mind doesn’t accept.”

13:46.637 --> 13:53.134
So acceptance as it is whatever you see,
acceptance.

13:53.539 --> 13:57.463
And that is how people grow I have seen,
those who start accepting.

13:57.664 --> 14:05.074
That’s the sign. That’s the sign of their
strength and their depth.

14:05.275 --> 14:12.360
Like the propensity of this Mother Earth,
She is what She is.

14:16.954 --> 14:21.863
And She bears whatever is there.

14:25.099 --> 14:33.452
If you put a heavy thing on Her, She’ll put
equal and opposite force and bear it.

14:33.653 --> 14:39.576
She doesn’t say, “I’m tolerating it,
I am exerting any pressure”.

14:39.777 --> 14:43.202
But She is just accepting.

14:46.446 --> 14:52.600
So the witnessing and awareness develops

14:52.801 --> 14:58.195
when we start just accepting things
as they are.

14:59.203 --> 15:03.264
“I think” doesn’t work out.

15:06.511 --> 15:11.978
“I think it would have been better like
this” doesn’t work out.

15:15.122 --> 15:19.369
Then second problem is “I like”.

15:21.611 --> 15:28.751
Now, “I like to eat a cake” - but there is
no cake, what to do?

15:31.114 --> 15:36.044
Now, whatever is there, enjoy it as a cake.

15:37.536 --> 15:44.965
But if you go on thinking like that –
“I like whatever is not here” –

15:45.195 --> 15:49.787
you can never be happy, as simple as that.

15:49.988 --> 15:57.661
You have to say, “I like whatever is there.

15:58.700 --> 16:04.850
I enjoy whatever is there”. Then that’s
the reality.

16:05.051 --> 16:12.759
Whatever doesn’t exist, if you like it,

16:15.258 --> 16:18.932
so what can anybody do about it?

16:22.623 --> 16:29.146
It works out in so many ways, in so many
facets in life,

16:29.347 --> 16:37.871
that advantage is taken by people because
we become so vulnerable

16:38.072 --> 16:43.472
to our likes and dislikes that
the entrepreneurs take over

16:43.673 --> 16:50.313
and they create likes and dislikes
in our heads, and put ideas every day.

16:50.514 --> 16:53.601
I’ve seen it now, how they do it,

16:53.772 --> 16:57.948
through television, through newspapers,
through this, that.

16:58.149 --> 17:02.312
So then you say, “Now, I like this”.

17:03.609 --> 17:07.508
But from where this liking has come

17:07.717 --> 17:12.876
is the conditioning which is put
into your head.

17:16.351 --> 17:22.080
So you are a slave of that conditioning.

17:25.392 --> 17:34.580
“I only like roses and I don’t like
any other flower”.

17:34.781 --> 17:42.601
But why? Why you don’t like any
other flower?

17:47.336 --> 17:55.814
And for such things whatever we have
we miss the joy.

17:58.911 --> 18:06.992
So the second part should be that,
“Enjoy everything.”

18:10.553 --> 18:13.793
“Why am I here?

18:17.748 --> 18:27.411
It’s not a very comfortable place
by any chance, so why am I here?”

18:31.262 --> 18:35.483
To enjoy each other.

18:38.172 --> 18:41.812
To enjoy your own being.

18:42.013 --> 18:50.420
The more divergence you have outside,
appealing to your ego and conditioning,

18:50.684 --> 18:55.367
the more your mind is busy with that,

18:58.448 --> 19:06.444
then you cannot enjoy anything.

19:09.484 --> 19:14.397
So come to the other conditioning which
is very subtle

19:16.082 --> 19:22.317
that, “I’m an Englishman”, or
“I’m an American”,

19:22.518 --> 19:33.569
or maybe even “I’m from Derbyshire”,
and then “I’m from another shire”,

19:34.951 --> 19:38.998
and then “better form a group”.

19:41.827 --> 19:45.418
The grouping starts.

19:46.188 --> 19:53.474
In a subtle way it is a kind
of an insecurity.

19:58.881 --> 20:02.301
So we start clubbing.

20:03.350 --> 20:07.360
Animals do that very often, they have
to do it

20:07.561 --> 20:12.126
because their sense of insecurity
is quite a lot.

20:12.327 --> 20:17.046
And then human beings also do it -

20:17.490 --> 20:22.805
but not the saints, not the angels.

20:23.178 --> 20:28.423
They don’t form [groups] because they have
no nationality.

20:29.769 --> 20:33.889
Nationality is also a conditioning.

20:36.433 --> 20:42.273
They don’t belong to any one place,
to any one country.

20:43.206 --> 20:47.785
So now those who have come by plane,
had to come,

20:47.986 --> 20:54.197
because from every country there’s
one plane by which they come,

20:54.900 --> 21:02.345
must know one thing – that now we have
landed,

21:02.586 --> 21:10.651
and we are all Sahaj Yogis here,
and forget your countries.

21:11.509 --> 21:19.116
Forget them and mix up with other people.

21:19.317 --> 21:25.362
Please do not form groups. There is no need
at all to form groups.

21:25.563 --> 21:33.383
So I would request you that in the buses,
because it starts from the airport

21:33.584 --> 21:39.454
you start forming groups and it continues
till the end you go back.

21:39.655 --> 21:47.036
I think it would be a nice idea to break
that, and let people sit

21:47.237 --> 21:55.559
together of different countries and
different nationalities.

21:55.760 --> 22:00.286
And talk to each other, try to know
about each other,

22:00.487 --> 22:03.226
try to find out about each other.

22:03.427 --> 22:09.810
Not just what you know from the newspaper,

22:10.011 --> 22:15.714
but the different problems of Sahaja Yoga,

22:15.915 --> 22:19.630
what are the problems of Sahaja Yoga
in a particular country,

22:19.839 --> 22:23.908
what happens in a particular country.

22:25.853 --> 22:34.370
The worst of all is the conditioning
of reading also.

22:41.728 --> 22:47.218
Reading without light is useless,

22:47.726 --> 22:52.616
and some people still have a habit

22:52.939 --> 22:58.905
of remembering something they have read

22:59.770 --> 23:04.936
and a kind of a show-off as they say.

23:07.306 --> 23:15.835
Is better to listen to others.
Let others talk.

23:16.480 --> 23:24.989
In Sahaja Yoga on what subject
you’ll discuss?

23:25.284 --> 23:30.476
I don’t know, how can you discuss
on anything?

23:30.677 --> 23:37.979
Now you see this one as a green thing.

23:39.275 --> 23:42.623
Now, what can you discuss on this?

23:42.824 --> 23:48.344
You will say, “All right, it’s green, but…
there is so”.

23:48.545 --> 23:53.717
Then another one says, “No, this is green,
but…”.

23:55.110 --> 23:59.255
One may go on like that, madly.

23:59.913 --> 24:04.296
There is no need to discuss in Sahaja Yoga.

24:04.497 --> 24:07.698
I just don’t know what are we going
to discuss. You know everything,

24:07.899 --> 24:11.798
you know how Kundalini rises, you know
how chakras are cleared out,

24:11.999 --> 24:16.102
you know how you get realization,
you all know who’s, who catches,

24:16.303 --> 24:21.871
what, and you know that how it affects.

24:22.072 --> 24:28.537
Now, if that is the fact, if that is
the truth, that is what it is,

24:28.738 --> 24:32.646
what are we going to discuss about it?

24:33.512 --> 24:36.896
Discussions are over now.

24:37.741 --> 24:44.685
You are gnostics, you are knowledgeable
people. You have the knowledge.

24:44.985 --> 24:49.767
But the knowledge that you have is shared
by everyone of you.

24:49.968 --> 24:55.170
At the most, you can talk about
your experiences,

24:55.371 --> 25:04.450
you can talk about your relationships,
how you have enjoyed.

25:05.286 --> 25:09.500
But there is nothing to discuss
in Sahaja Yoga.

25:09.701 --> 25:14.135
I’ve heard about people who are discussing.

25:14.629 --> 25:19.625
I just don’t know how can there be
a discussion about Sahaja Yoga.

25:20.109 --> 25:23.210
I would be very happy to know, if you can
tell Me,

25:23.411 --> 25:27.260
how we can discuss about Sahaja Yoga.

25:32.379 --> 25:37.921
So we have to remember that whatever
we talk, we should talk

25:38.122 --> 25:45.079
about our experiences, about our enjoyments,
our happiness, everything.

25:45.280 --> 25:53.891
And not to discuss it and analyze it,
because that would kill the joy completely.

25:55.702 --> 25:59.173
There’s no joy in it.

25:59.374 --> 26:03.930
Discussion is just trying to show that
you know better than the other,

26:04.131 --> 26:10.569
or you can give another opinion. In Sahaja
Yoga there is no another opinion.

26:11.069 --> 26:18.171
If somebody has a Nabhi, he has a Nabhi,
what another opinion you can have?

26:20.985 --> 26:30.080
So then we finish with different kinds
of arguments and discussions and things.

26:30.281 --> 26:36.696
Maybe somebody goes off the track, maybe.

26:36.923 --> 26:42.658
But you all know he is going off the track,
so what’s the use of discussing it?

26:43.376 --> 26:46.744
You all know what he is talking is off
the track, so it’s all right.

26:46.945 --> 26:50.456
You come to the conclusion, “Yeah, we know,
we know, we know”.

26:50.657 --> 26:56.643
But to discuss it out, there is no need.

26:56.844 --> 27:02.944
Once you know and it is in your awareness,
the Paramchaitanya will take care of it

27:03.145 --> 27:06.986
and you won’t have to bother at all

27:07.187 --> 27:12.375
how to correct, how to mend it, what to do.

27:13.417 --> 27:20.733
That’s not your work. You just leave it
to Paramchaitanya and it will work out.

27:23.041 --> 27:27.819
So here we have come because this country
has been very much blessed

27:28.020 --> 27:35.766
by so many saints and yogis, and you can
see it in the people how they are.

27:36.783 --> 27:41.668
And that’s why, despite all poverty,
despite all kinds of discomforts,

27:41.869 --> 27:51.104
and despite the fact that they have not
known any Western great things,

27:51.305 --> 27:55.397
they are not bothered.

27:57.362 --> 28:02.838
I went to Russia, of course Russia was
great and so many got realization.

28:03.039 --> 28:09.712
And I was really surprised how these people
have come to Sahaja Yoga

28:11.202 --> 28:18.781
and accepted it. But one part was
very funny,

28:18.982 --> 28:23.693
which was I would say, like the villagers
of this country.

28:23.894 --> 28:30.692
Those who are still not so matured would
not come to Sahaja Yoga as such,

28:30.913 --> 28:36.775
but the difference of their character
was really remarkable,

28:36.976 --> 28:41.527
because - you are going by a taxi.

28:41.781 --> 28:47.985
So the taxi fellow says, “Have you got
a Marlboro cigarette with you?”.

28:49.424 --> 28:51.949
I said, “What is that? I have never
known of it”.

28:52.150 --> 28:58.058
“No, if you have one then we’ll take you
free, or we’ll charge you very little”.

28:58.259 --> 29:01.571
But an Indian will never say such a thing,
he doesn’t know all these things,

29:01.772 --> 29:04.575
he’s not bothered.

29:05.019 --> 29:08.822
But if an Indian taxi fellow is going,
he’ll say,

29:09.023 --> 29:13.440
“Have you got a photograph of Mataji
with you?”.

29:18.526 --> 29:21.358
That’s a big difference!

29:30.061 --> 29:34.182
In every aspect I have seen that this
another -

29:34.383 --> 29:39.163
like there are villagers here, people who
are not Sahaja Yogis,

29:39.364 --> 29:43.193
but they respect, they respect the saint.

29:43.394 --> 29:47.786
To them saint is more important than
anything else.

29:49.312 --> 29:54.388
Nobody will ask you for anything – never!

29:54.673 --> 29:58.972
Even if you want to give them, they will
not accept.

30:01.062 --> 30:05.271
They may cheat you, some people who
are selling things,

30:05.472 --> 30:09.432
but they will never ask from you that,
“You give me this, you give me that”,

30:09.633 --> 30:12.390
that’s not done.

30:12.859 --> 30:19.199
So the, basically I think there is a
difference which we should understand,

30:19.571 --> 30:29.321
that materialism works much faster
in the West than in India, much faster.

30:30.845 --> 30:37.933
And one has to be careful on that point.
I’m bringing you down to that point now -

30:39.055 --> 30:45.926
that, are we getting lost into materialism?

30:49.489 --> 30:51.887
Of course you know I’m a great shopper,

30:52.088 --> 30:56.863
I have to go on shopping, shopping,
shopping, shopping.

30:57.064 --> 31:02.690
And I shop for all of you, and I have been
shopping, no doubt.

31:03.756 --> 31:10.205
But the difference between My shopping
and the shopping of so many is this –

31:10.406 --> 31:14.067
that if I’m shopping I am going there

31:14.268 --> 31:18.348
because I know I’ll get things much
cheaper, much better.

31:18.549 --> 31:23.767
All the good things will be there available
because I’m there – I’m sure of that;

31:23.968 --> 31:29.481
and all the best qualities will be
available very easily,

31:30.404 --> 31:37.490
and that I will be able to get things

31:37.691 --> 31:43.248
for people, because I’ll remember all
of them for whom I have to buy.

31:43.782 --> 31:47.047
It always happens like that.

31:48.479 --> 31:54.299
When I go out for shopping, even if I have
to face four hundred people,

31:54.500 --> 32:01.021
I get the things there all right.
That’s why I have to go.

32:03.717 --> 32:08.996
All right, if you have to go then you have
to think, “What we are going to buy?”.

32:09.197 --> 32:14.603
I have seen invariably Sahaja Yogis
will buy

32:14.804 --> 32:18.730
things for non-Sahaja Yogis, always,
mostly.

32:18.931 --> 32:24.149
“I’m buying for my mother, my sister
who is against Sahaja Yoga”.

32:24.350 --> 32:29.065
Why should you buy for somebody who is
against Sahaja Yoga?

32:29.266 --> 32:34.724
Even if they might be your nearest
relations,

32:35.969 --> 32:39.411
do you think they deserve it?

32:41.804 --> 32:47.713
So then we have to know that we are
one body,

32:47.914 --> 32:51.240
and as this hand must look after
the other hand,

32:51.441 --> 32:55.649
when we go out shopping or do anything,
we should always think

32:55.850 --> 33:00.908
what we are going to buy for other
Sahaja Yogis.

33:01.130 --> 33:04.166
Of course, I have told you that, unless
and until somebody is your sister

33:04.367 --> 33:08.917
by rakhi or anything, you need not give
presents.

33:10.175 --> 33:15.139
But women can buy for women, men can
buy for men.

33:15.340 --> 33:19.111
Just understand one small thing –

33:19.312 --> 33:23.337
that the matter is for expression
of our love, that’s all.

33:23.538 --> 33:28.829
It has no other meaning. I don’t find
any meaning into it.

33:32.574 --> 33:35.933
So instead of buying for… when we,
people travel from here

33:36.134 --> 33:41.680
they go as traders, I’ve seen. Of course
you come as traders also –

33:41.881 --> 33:48.530
but that’s something Dharmic. But when
you go from here you go as traders,

33:48.731 --> 33:52.092
and for whom are you buying?

33:53.879 --> 34:00.433
Your relationships are no more with
anybody else but Sahaja Yogis,

34:00.634 --> 34:04.247
and only Sahaja Yogis.

34:07.872 --> 34:11.596
Whether they are Indians,

34:12.973 --> 34:20.297
English, Chinese, Swiss, French, Spanish,

34:21.077 --> 34:33.483
Germans, anything they may think to be,
they are Sahaja Yogis,

34:33.684 --> 34:40.586
and they are born in the land which
we call as the Kingdom of God.

34:40.787 --> 34:43.772
So please be careful on this point.

34:43.973 --> 34:49.349
Today being the first day I wanted to
explain to you everything in such a manner

34:49.550 --> 34:52.409
that you remember that we are
on a pilgrimage,

34:52.610 --> 34:58.102
and all of us should be able to grow
our awareness.

34:58.303 --> 35:03.284
If you cannot grow your awareness
it is useless.

35:07.226 --> 35:11.887
Once you start thinking like that,
you’ll be surprised

35:12.088 --> 35:16.520
how much you will gain and how much
you’ll achieve.

35:20.089 --> 35:25.466
There are no do’s and don’ts
in Sahaja Yoga, really,

35:25.667 --> 35:31.192
and I don’t think we have much disciplining
either, of any kind.

35:31.393 --> 35:36.327
But it is Sahaja Yoga which somehow
or other disciplines you,

35:36.528 --> 35:40.314
I don’t have to tell you anything.
It’s like the fire,

35:40.515 --> 35:45.502
if you put your hand into the fire it will
burn you, whether you like it or not.

35:45.703 --> 35:51.471
In the same way, if you do anything asahaj,
you will have to pay for it.

35:51.672 --> 35:55.277
So you know definitely that you don’t
want to lose your vibrations,

35:55.478 --> 35:59.024
you don’t want to become unhappy.

35:59.225 --> 36:03.671
But this time with a very deeper
understanding and reverence

36:03.872 --> 36:09.982
to your Self and to your ascent,

36:10.183 --> 36:23.686
you have to take a very joyful,
serious attitude.

36:24.203 --> 36:30.759
I’m sure this time you all are going
to just enjoy your Self.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.801
May God bless you.
