00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:22.019
Welcome back

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.979
I guess Indian gurus have been involved over recent years in the West, when the Beatles introduced us to the Maharishi.

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:33.149
The orange people blindly followed the bad one, but they have been others far more credible and far more respectful.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.779
My next guest is a Bombay lady

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:36.979
Who's following is growing around the world.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:43.679
She says that you have the power to deal positively with every problem from common to cancer.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.879
All you have to do is now have a tap... , tapping that power.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.279
Please welcome the lady acclaimed as India's greatest living Saint,

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:59.319
the Mother of Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji.
Welcome.

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.379
I know it's ...Welcome to Australia, I know it's very difficult for you, for anyone to sum up one's religion,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.279
but is it possible to say what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:13.079
Sahaja- "saha" means "with"," ja" is "born with you".

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.279
This is born with you. Within us is the power

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:20.779
which can give us the status of a Spirit.

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.509
We are not yet the Spirit.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.279
We are at a human level .

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:32.279
And in the evolutionary process we have to now have the breakthrough to become the Spirit.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.369
That's very essential and is absolutely

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.279
eventually the all possible natural thing that has to happen.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:47.479
It should happen to all of us and the time has come for you to get to that position where you become the Spirit.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.479
All the religions have talked about it and told about it, but people have gone wrong in believing that

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:59.479
artificially if you say that you are baptized

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.779
or you have become a Brahmin or you have become a pire that you have become the Spirit.

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.379
It's not that.
It's a happening that has to take place within ourselves

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:15.679
Which is a living process, absolutely a living process of living Divine force within ourselves.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.479
How does this.. we have heard of lots of yogas,

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.489
How does this differ from other any yoga?

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.579
Other yoga's were practiced mostly after getting Realization.

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:33.679
But as it has come from some half-baked people,

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:39.079
it is in a very funny way that people follow it as if they have to take all the medicines together.

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
And they don't know any discrimination about it.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.279
Unless and until you make this force rise within you, you will not know

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.279
what type of attention is needed

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.579
and what type of physical exercise is needed.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.079
Indiscriminately people do physical exercises getting into trouble.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.079
Now you are speaking of the force. Is it possible to say where this force emanate from?

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.279
This force is a residual power in our triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.729
Sacrum

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:15.079
Now the sacrum is a word that comes from Greece

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.659
and that means Greek people knew this was a sacred bone.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.849
It rises from there, passes through our six centers

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:31.479
piercing through our fontanel bone area and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.279
-That's what Christians refer to it?
- Yes. I mean, Holy Ghost.

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.079
What is the Holy Ghost? Nobody can explain,

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.079
but Holy Ghost is very simple to understand. This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.079
Holy Ghost is the desire of God.

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:50.279
God Himself watches the working of the desire.

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:56.279
And the desire is that we all should become the Spirit.

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:03.479
And this desire is reflected in our triangular bone, in three and a half coils. When it..

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.579
-Is this the central nervous system?
-No. It is in the triangular bone.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.579
It's this force. This is the forth force within us. You see,

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.679
we have sympathetic nervous system, left and right

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:17.879
and we have got autonomous, that is an autonomous nervous system and parasympathetic

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.879
and we have also central nervous system.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.979
Now this is the system which is not yet working.

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.279
It is still in the triangular bone.

00:04:25.359 --> 00:04:30.279
When it rises it gives you you a new dimension of the Spirit.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:34.679
Means the light of the Spirit comes in our attention.

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:38.919
In that case what happens. It's very simple to understand that

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:44.379
at human level we are not in the absolute state,

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.279
not in the absolute state. That's why there is a chaos.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.579
Supposing I'm holding a snake in my hands, you see, and there's no light.

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:53.779
Somebody tells me that there's a snake. I will not throw it away.

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.779
I would not like to listen to anybody's advice about it.

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.779
But if there's a light, I'll throw it away.

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:04.379
In the same way when you become the Spirit, the light of the Spirit guides you.

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.679
You become your own master, you become your own guru. You don't have to have any guru for that.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.779
This piercing of the fontanel bone by the Kundalini

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.079
gives you the power of the Spirit.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:20.979
But.. you will demonstrate us or at least will give you a chance to demonstrate

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.079
But you're talking about a physical power of the Spirit that comes out of the top of your head?

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:26.779
-No, it's an energy.
-An energy, alright.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.579
It's an energy, which comes out of your fontanel bone area, here,

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:35.879
area, touching the Spirit,
but the Spirit actually resides in the heart.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.579
But the main seat of the heart is here in the fontanel bone area.

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:43.089
And it pierces through, when it pierces through

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.979
actually it should pierce, it is not just I say I baptize you, It's not like that.

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.779
It has to pierce through that

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.779
and you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on top of your head.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.679
-Is it there now?
-Yes it is there.

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:57.779
-Can I feel it?
- I don’t know if you’ll feel it or not,

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.779
because you have to have that sensitivity.

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:07.779
Now, it is all around, also that All-pervading Power is there, which makes everything vibrate.

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:12.979
But this energy can be felt only when you have got that Realization.

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.979
Then what happens that all your centers on your fingertips become sensitive.

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:24.419
And you can feel this is written in the Quran that your hands will speak when you get to your Resurrection.

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:25.479
- Yes.
- This is a Resurrection.

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.879
But Mataji, you must know, you must realize, I mentioned about Maharishi, about the bad ones,

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.879
you must live with the sceptics and the doubters because...

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:37.879
-Of course, of course, I’m living with them all the time.
-Because they come before you.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:44.779
Now firstly you see, the great mistake we commit, as far as going to gurus or to anything that is religious,

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.379
is that you cannot pay for God.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:50.279
You see it's a living process of a living God.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.359
Now supposing you want to sprout a seed.

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:55.079
How much money do you pay to the Mother Earth?

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.779
It's a very simple thing, but people don't understand.

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:00.879
They think that they can purchase everything.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.079
You cannot purchase God.

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:07.379
A simple method if you apply to all of them they will all run away.

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:14.779
Yes, now again. I read that the Spirit, this power you speak of, can deal with ...common

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.479
I'm into the content, but can deal with cancer, with AIDS,
-Yes, yes.

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:24.019
I've had some Australians talk about their children being heroin addicts and and

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:28.679
Yes, of course, of course, it can, it does. Because see I'll show you now.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:34.079
This is the centre, you can say this is the medulla oblongata

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.969
or we can say this is through which the central canal is passing.

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:40.679
Now, the centre is inside here.

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:45.179
Now when we are in the imbalance, say we go too much towards the left side

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:49.679
means we become too emotional or do all kinds of wrong nonsensical conditionings,

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:55.179
then or if you go too much to the right in ego and all that, you see, then we break.

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:58.279
Once we break this what happens that

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:03.779
the center becomes constricted and the energy becomes constricted.

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:08.779
Slowly it breaks the relationship with the head, with the whole

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.279
and it becomes malignant. When it becomes malignant

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:17.279
it starts overpowering other cells and that's how cancer is settled.

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.579
Now when the Kundalini rises what she does

00:08:19.579 --> 00:08:23.629
she enlightens this centre here, first of all, she brings it back to normal

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:29.079
and then she goes up there, pierces through by which she does one great thing

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:34.079
is to make you in contact with the All-pervading Power.

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:37.279
And once that power starts flowing through you, you don't have to worry.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.249
You become absolutely peaceful, all your troubles are over.

00:08:40.249 --> 00:08:43.879
Actually, most of the troubles can be over once you are the Spirit.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:46.409
All right. It's very difficult to understand and

00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:51.279
Understand ..[...] as I'm doing now. You have offered to give a demonstration with our audience?

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.869
-Yes, I think I'll try but it's a very short time.
-Would you like?

00:08:53.869 --> 00:08:57.679
And they are all in a hurry I think to catch the buses or something.

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:59.079
No. no, they've got time to try.

00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:00.779
All right. Let's see.

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:04.779
Now, you just put your hands towards me, just like this.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:12.779
And put your right hand on your heart.

00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:20.179
and say with full faith in yourself that you are the Spirit.

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:23.379
That's in your heart you have to say. "Mother, I am the Spirit".

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:27.079
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji.

00:09:27.079 --> 00:09:29.799
"I am the Spirit". Please say three times

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:34.279
with full confidence in yourself.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:47.779
Now put the right hand towards me and see on top of your head

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:51.779
if you are getting a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:57.479
Yes, yes, here. On top of ... some people get it that high.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:02.779
Watch me without thinking. Watch me without thinking.

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:05.859
Put your right hand towards me, right, right hand towards me,

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:10.379
right hand towards me and left hand on top of your head.

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:14.979
Right hand I am saying, right hand towards me you are doing all wrong.

00:10:14.979 --> 00:10:18.969
Now see. Is it all right?

00:10:18.969 --> 00:10:22.779
-Are you getting the cool breeze in your head?
-Say yes, if you are.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:29.779
Yes, yes, yes. I can see your eyes are.. Eyes will start glistening, you see, there will be a light in your eyes.

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:36.779
Now, are you thinking now? Just watch me without thinking. Let's see, can you do that?

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:42.479
Watch me without thinking. Can you do that?

00:10:48.599 --> 00:10:50.599
You can.

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:54.879
You cannot do that otherwise. You see, so you have gone beyond thought.

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:58.279
Now just feel it. Are you feeling it in the hand also? Just let's see.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:01.179
Put your hands up if you've felt some way.

00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:03.579
Put up all your hands. All of those who have felt it.

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:07.279
Put both the hands. I would like to see both the hands.

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.279
Let me show them, Madame.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:11.419
Yes, so many of them who have got it.

00:11:11.419 --> 00:11:14.879
-Now we have some of your followers here ...
-Yes, who else?

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:17.279
-up, up here we had.
-All right, let's see.

00:11:17.779 --> 00:11:21.059
Those who have felt in the head just put your hands up.

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:30.259
Surprising, the audience seems to be..

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:35.739
Yesterday we had 1500 people out there and about 500 people upstairs.

00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:38.379
-And most of them got Realisation.
-Yes.

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:41.779
Now, in fact, we should have said in the past when you've done it in Britain and

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:44.579
you've actually through radio and television you've told people

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:48.279
-at home to do the same.
-No, it’s Hong Kong. I did it in Hong Kong. Not in a..

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:52.849
In Hong Kong people are very sensitive. There are very sensitive people in Hong Kong.

00:11:52.849 --> 00:11:57.579
Perhaps they are in trouble now, because they have to go away and all that. May be that is it.

00:11:57.579 --> 00:12:00.779
People who are in need are more sensitive, are they?

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:03.779
I’d think so, because then they hanker after God.

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:09.079
You see, otherwise they think. “We are alright, what to care for God, you see, who is God after all?”

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:11.579
So it happens. But it should happen to so many.

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:13.779
I'm surprised they haven't got.

00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:17.079
Let's see again how many have got it. Let's see.

00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:19.189
Put your hands up. Let's see. Just see.

00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.689
They're reluctant even to put the hand to see, you see?

00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:25.079
Now just see it on your head.

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:29.379
I've been distracted actually. I'm not a fair test for this because I've been watching things happening in this studio.

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:31.909
Yes, that's it and they are...

00:12:31.909 --> 00:12:34.279
Are you feeling it?

00:12:34.309 --> 00:12:37.279
No? None of you?

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:38.449
I think there’s something wrong.

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:42.379
I can feel the breezes coming from them, I can feel it.

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:45.679
Some of them are do feeling it. You see those, who are really feeling it,

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:49.579
do not feel ashamed and just say "Yes, we are feeling it. That's the best.

00:12:49.579 --> 00:12:53.879
Can you raise your hands now, let's see?

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:58.279
These are all my disciples I think.

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:03.279
-Surprising. Otherwise Australians are very good.
-Are they? We were receptive, were we?

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:08.279
They are the best people. They are very innocent  and they get their realization very fast.

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:11.279
They stick on to it, and they have done wonders. They have done wonders.

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:17.079
I should make the point that I saw one of your advertisements in one of the papers today and  I think your..

00:13:17.169 --> 00:13:21.769
there is a meeting tonight at the State Theatre in Sydney, but there is no fee charge.

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:22.779
Of course not.

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:24.779
-You’re not charging?
-No, no, not at all,

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:27.279
-You are not rounding up money?
-No.

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:29.179
No, I should make. Alright, we thank you for your time.

00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:31.079
You're staying another week or so in Australia?
-Yes.

00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:35.779
You’ve been to other states, and you are now doing in Sydney?
-Yes. I’ll be going to Melbourne.

00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:38.279
-Sydney, Melbourne and New Zealand.
-And to New Zealand also.

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:40.779
