00:21.129 --> 00:22.019
Welcome back

00:22.019 --> 00:27.979
I guess Indian gurus have been involved over recent years in the West, when the Beatles introduced us to the Maharishi.

00:27.979 --> 00:33.149
The orange people blindly followed the bad one, but they have been others far more credible and far more respectful.

00:33.149 --> 00:34.779
My next guest is a Bombay lady

00:34.979 --> 00:36.979
Who's following is growing around the world.

00:36.979 --> 00:43.679
She says that you have the power to deal positively with every problem from common to cancer.

00:43.679 --> 00:46.879
All you have to do is now have a tap... , tapping that power.

00:46.969 --> 00:51.279
Please welcome the lady acclaimed as India's greatest living Saint,

00:51.279 --> 00:59.319
the Mother of Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji.
Welcome.

00:59.319 --> 01:04.379
I know it's ...Welcome to Australia, I know it's very difficult for you, for anyone to sum up one's religion,

01:04.379 --> 01:08.279
but is it possible to say what is Sahaja Yoga?

01:08.279 --> 01:13.079
Sahaja- "saha" means "with"," ja" is "born with you".

01:13.079 --> 01:16.279
This is born with you. Within us is the power

01:16.779 --> 01:20.779
which can give us the status of a Spirit.

01:20.779 --> 01:22.509
We are not yet the Spirit.

01:22.509 --> 01:25.279
We are at a human level .

01:25.279 --> 01:32.279
And in the evolutionary process we have to now have the breakthrough to become the Spirit.

01:32.279 --> 01:34.369
That's very essential and is absolutely

01:34.369 --> 01:40.279
eventually the all possible natural thing that has to happen.

01:40.359 --> 01:47.479
It should happen to all of us and the time has come for you to get to that position where you become the Spirit.

01:47.479 --> 01:54.479
All the religions have talked about it and told about it, but people have gone wrong in believing that

01:54.489 --> 01:59.479
artificially if you say that you are baptized

01:59.479 --> 02:04.779
or you have become a Brahmin or you have become a pire that you have become the Spirit.

02:04.779 --> 02:08.379
It's not that.
It's a happening that has to take place within ourselves

02:08.409 --> 02:15.679
Which is a living process, absolutely a living process of living Divine force within ourselves.

02:15.699 --> 02:19.479
How does this.. we have heard of lots of yogas,

02:19.569 --> 02:23.489
How does this differ from other any yoga?

02:23.489 --> 02:28.579
Other yoga's were practiced mostly after getting Realization.

02:28.619 --> 02:33.679
But as it has come from some half-baked people,

02:33.689 --> 02:39.079
it is in a very funny way that people follow it as if they have to take all the medicines together.

02:39.079 --> 02:42.079
And they don't know any discrimination about it.

02:42.129 --> 02:47.279
Unless and until you make this force rise within you, you will not know

02:47.279 --> 02:51.279
what type of attention is needed

02:51.379 --> 02:54.579
and what type of physical exercise is needed.

02:54.639 --> 02:58.079
Indiscriminately people do physical exercises getting into trouble.

02:58.079 --> 03:03.079
Now you are speaking of the force. Is it possible to say where this force emanate from?

03:03.079 --> 03:09.279
This force is a residual power in our triangular bone called as sacrum.

03:09.979 --> 03:11.729
Sacrum

03:11.729 --> 03:15.079
Now the sacrum is a word that comes from Greece

03:15.079 --> 03:19.659
and that means Greek people knew this was a sacred bone.

03:19.659 --> 03:23.849
It rises from there, passes through our six centers

03:23.849 --> 03:31.479
piercing through our fontanel bone area and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

03:31.479 --> 03:35.279
-That's what Christians refer to it?
- Yes. I mean, Holy Ghost.

03:35.279 --> 03:38.079
What is the Holy Ghost? Nobody can explain,

03:38.079 --> 03:43.079
but Holy Ghost is very simple to understand. This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

03:43.089 --> 03:46.079
Holy Ghost is the desire of God.

03:46.149 --> 03:50.279
God Himself watches the working of the desire.

03:50.279 --> 03:56.279
And the desire is that we all should become the Spirit.

03:56.279 --> 04:03.479
And this desire is reflected in our triangular bone, in three and a half coils. When it..

04:03.479 --> 04:07.579
-Is this the central nervous system?
-No. It is in the triangular bone.

04:07.579 --> 04:10.579
It's this force. This is the forth force within us. You see,

04:10.579 --> 04:13.679
we have sympathetic nervous system, left and right

04:13.679 --> 04:17.879
and we have got autonomous, that is an autonomous nervous system and parasympathetic

04:17.879 --> 04:19.879
and we have also central nervous system.

04:19.879 --> 04:22.979
Now this is the system which is not yet working.

04:22.979 --> 04:25.279
It is still in the triangular bone.

04:25.359 --> 04:30.279
When it rises it gives you you a new dimension of the Spirit.

04:30.279 --> 04:34.679
Means the light of the Spirit comes in our attention.

04:34.679 --> 04:38.919
In that case what happens. It's very simple to understand that

04:39.279 --> 04:44.379
at human level we are not in the absolute state,

04:44.379 --> 04:47.279
not in the absolute state. That's why there is a chaos.

04:47.279 --> 04:50.579
Supposing I'm holding a snake in my hands, you see, and there's no light.

04:50.579 --> 04:53.779
Somebody tells me that there's a snake. I will not throw it away.

04:53.779 --> 04:56.779
I would not like to listen to anybody's advice about it.

04:56.779 --> 04:58.779
But if there's a light, I'll throw it away.

04:58.779 --> 05:04.379
In the same way when you become the Spirit, the light of the Spirit guides you.

05:04.389 --> 05:09.679
You become your own master, you become your own guru. You don't have to have any guru for that.

05:09.759 --> 05:14.779
This piercing of the fontanel bone by the Kundalini

05:14.779 --> 05:17.079
gives you the power of the Spirit.

05:17.079 --> 05:20.979
But.. you will demonstrate us or at least will give you a chance to demonstrate

05:20.979 --> 05:25.079
But you're talking about a physical power of the Spirit that comes out of the top of your head?

05:25.079 --> 05:26.779
-No, it's an energy.
-An energy, alright.

05:26.779 --> 05:31.579
It's an energy, which comes out of your fontanel bone area, here,

05:31.579 --> 05:35.879
area, touching the Spirit,
but the Spirit actually resides in the heart.

05:35.919 --> 05:40.579
But the main seat of the heart is here in the fontanel bone area.

05:40.579 --> 05:43.089
And it pierces through, when it pierces through

05:43.089 --> 05:46.979
actually it should pierce, it is not just I say I baptize you, It's not like that.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.779
It has to pierce through that

05:48.779 --> 05:52.779
and you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on top of your head.

05:52.779 --> 05:54.679
-Is it there now?
-Yes it is there.

05:54.679 --> 05:57.779
-Can I feel it?
- I don’t know if you’ll feel it or not,

05:57.779 --> 05:59.779
because you have to have that sensitivity.

05:59.779 --> 06:07.779
Now, it is all around, also that All-pervading Power is there, which makes everything vibrate.

06:07.779 --> 06:12.979
But this energy can be felt only when you have got that Realization.

06:12.979 --> 06:17.979
Then what happens that all your centers on your fingertips become sensitive.

06:17.979 --> 06:24.419
And you can feel this is written in the Quran that your hands will speak when you get to your Resurrection.

06:24.419 --> 06:25.479
- Yes.
- This is a Resurrection.

06:25.479 --> 06:29.879
But Mataji, you must know, you must realize, I mentioned about Maharishi, about the bad ones,

06:29.879 --> 06:32.879
you must live with the sceptics and the doubters because...

06:32.879 --> 06:37.879
-Of course, of course, I’m living with them all the time.
-Because they come before you.

06:37.879 --> 06:44.779
Now firstly you see, the great mistake we commit, as far as going to gurus or to anything that is religious,

06:44.779 --> 06:47.379
is that you cannot pay for God.

06:47.379 --> 06:50.279
You see it's a living process of a living God.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.359
Now supposing you want to sprout a seed.

06:52.359 --> 06:55.079
How much money do you pay to the Mother Earth?

06:55.089 --> 06:57.779
It's a very simple thing, but people don't understand.

06:57.779 --> 07:00.879
They think that they can purchase everything.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.079
You cannot purchase God.

07:03.079 --> 07:07.379
A simple method if you apply to all of them they will all run away.

07:07.499 --> 07:14.779
Yes, now again. I read that the Spirit, this power you speak of, can deal with ...common

07:14.779 --> 07:18.479
I'm into the content, but can deal with cancer, with AIDS,
-Yes, yes.

07:18.479 --> 07:24.019
I've had some Australians talk about their children being heroin addicts and and

07:24.019 --> 07:28.679
Yes, of course, of course, it can, it does. Because see I'll show you now.

07:29.079 --> 07:34.079
This is the centre, you can say this is the medulla oblongata

07:34.079 --> 07:37.969
or we can say this is through which the central canal is passing.

07:37.969 --> 07:40.679
Now, the centre is inside here.

07:40.679 --> 07:45.179
Now when we are in the imbalance, say we go too much towards the left side

07:45.179 --> 07:49.679
means we become too emotional or do all kinds of wrong nonsensical conditionings,

07:49.879 --> 07:55.179
then or if you go too much to the right in ego and all that, you see, then we break.

07:55.179 --> 07:58.279
Once we break this what happens that

07:58.279 --> 08:03.779
the center becomes constricted and the energy becomes constricted.

08:03.779 --> 08:08.779
Slowly it breaks the relationship with the head, with the whole

08:08.779 --> 08:11.279
and it becomes malignant. When it becomes malignant

08:11.279 --> 08:17.279
it starts overpowering other cells and that's how cancer is settled.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.579
Now when the Kundalini rises what she does

08:19.579 --> 08:23.629
she enlightens this centre here, first of all, she brings it back to normal

08:23.639 --> 08:29.079
and then she goes up there, pierces through by which she does one great thing

08:29.079 --> 08:34.079
is to make you in contact with the All-pervading Power.

08:34.079 --> 08:37.279
And once that power starts flowing through you, you don't have to worry.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.249
You become absolutely peaceful, all your troubles are over.

08:40.249 --> 08:43.879
Actually, most of the troubles can be over once you are the Spirit.

08:43.879 --> 08:46.409
All right. It's very difficult to understand and

08:46.409 --> 08:51.279
Understand ..[...] as I'm doing now. You have offered to give a demonstration with our audience?

08:51.279 --> 08:53.869
-Yes, I think I'll try but it's a very short time.
-Would you like?

08:53.869 --> 08:57.679
And they are all in a hurry I think to catch the buses or something.

08:57.679 --> 08:59.079
No. no, they've got time to try.

08:59.079 --> 09:00.779
All right. Let's see.

09:00.779 --> 09:04.779
Now, you just put your hands towards me, just like this.

09:08.779 --> 09:12.779
And put your right hand on your heart.

09:15.159 --> 09:20.179
and say with full faith in yourself that you are the Spirit.

09:20.179 --> 09:23.379
That's in your heart you have to say. "Mother, I am the Spirit".

09:23.379 --> 09:27.079
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji.

09:27.079 --> 09:29.799
"I am the Spirit". Please say three times

09:29.799 --> 09:34.279
with full confidence in yourself.

09:43.299 --> 09:47.779
Now put the right hand towards me and see on top of your head

09:47.779 --> 09:51.779
if you are getting a cool breeze coming out of your head.

09:51.829 --> 09:57.479
Yes, yes, here. On top of ... some people get it that high.

10:00.159 --> 10:02.779
Watch me without thinking. Watch me without thinking.

10:02.779 --> 10:05.859
Put your right hand towards me, right, right hand towards me,

10:05.859 --> 10:10.379
right hand towards me and left hand on top of your head.

10:10.379 --> 10:14.979
Right hand I am saying, right hand towards me you are doing all wrong.

10:14.979 --> 10:18.969
Now see. Is it all right?

10:18.969 --> 10:22.779
-Are you getting the cool breeze in your head?
-Say yes, if you are.

10:22.779 --> 10:29.779
Yes, yes, yes. I can see your eyes are.. Eyes will start glistening, you see, there will be a light in your eyes.

10:30.889 --> 10:36.779
Now, are you thinking now? Just watch me without thinking. Let's see, can you do that?

10:36.779 --> 10:42.479
Watch me without thinking. Can you do that?

10:48.599 --> 10:50.599
You can.

10:50.719 --> 10:54.879
You cannot do that otherwise. You see, so you have gone beyond thought.

10:54.879 --> 10:58.279
Now just feel it. Are you feeling it in the hand also? Just let's see.

10:58.279 --> 11:01.179
Put your hands up if you've felt some way.

11:01.219 --> 11:03.579
Put up all your hands. All of those who have felt it.

11:03.879 --> 11:07.279
Put both the hands. I would like to see both the hands.

11:07.279 --> 11:08.279
Let me show them, Madame.

11:08.279 --> 11:11.419
Yes, so many of them who have got it.

11:11.419 --> 11:14.879
-Now we have some of your followers here ...
-Yes, who else?

11:14.879 --> 11:17.279
-up, up here we had.
-All right, let's see.

11:17.779 --> 11:21.059
Those who have felt in the head just put your hands up.

11:27.279 --> 11:30.259
Surprising, the audience seems to be..

11:30.259 --> 11:35.739
Yesterday we had 1500 people out there and about 500 people upstairs.

11:36.049 --> 11:38.379
-And most of them got Realisation.
-Yes.

11:38.379 --> 11:41.779
Now, in fact, we should have said in the past when you've done it in Britain and

11:41.779 --> 11:44.579
you've actually through radio and television you've told people

11:44.579 --> 11:48.279
-at home to do the same.
-No, it’s Hong Kong. I did it in Hong Kong. Not in a..

11:48.279 --> 11:52.849
In Hong Kong people are very sensitive. There are very sensitive people in Hong Kong.

11:52.849 --> 11:57.579
Perhaps they are in trouble now, because they have to go away and all that. May be that is it.

11:57.579 --> 12:00.779
People who are in need are more sensitive, are they?

12:00.779 --> 12:03.779
I’d think so, because then they hanker after God.

12:03.779 --> 12:09.079
You see, otherwise they think. “We are alright, what to care for God, you see, who is God after all?”

12:09.079 --> 12:11.579
So it happens. But it should happen to so many.

12:11.579 --> 12:13.779
I'm surprised they haven't got.

12:13.779 --> 12:17.079
Let's see again how many have got it. Let's see.

12:17.079 --> 12:19.189
Put your hands up. Let's see. Just see.

12:19.189 --> 12:19.689
They're reluctant even to put the hand to see, you see?

12:23.079 --> 12:25.079
Now just see it on your head.

12:25.079 --> 12:29.379
I've been distracted actually. I'm not a fair test for this because I've been watching things happening in this studio.

12:29.379 --> 12:31.909
Yes, that's it and they are...

12:31.909 --> 12:34.279
Are you feeling it?

12:34.309 --> 12:37.279
No? None of you?

12:37.279 --> 12:38.449
I think there’s something wrong.

12:38.449 --> 12:42.379
I can feel the breezes coming from them, I can feel it.

12:42.379 --> 12:45.679
Some of them are do feeling it. You see those, who are really feeling it,

12:45.679 --> 12:49.579
do not feel ashamed and just say "Yes, we are feeling it. That's the best.

12:49.579 --> 12:53.879
Can you raise your hands now, let's see?

12:54.609 --> 12:58.279
These are all my disciples I think.

12:58.279 --> 13:03.279
-Surprising. Otherwise Australians are very good.
-Are they? We were receptive, were we?

13:03.299 --> 13:08.279
They are the best people. They are very innocent  and they get their realization very fast.

13:08.279 --> 13:11.279
They stick on to it, and they have done wonders. They have done wonders.

13:11.279 --> 13:17.079
I should make the point that I saw one of your advertisements in one of the papers today and  I think your..

13:17.169 --> 13:21.769
there is a meeting tonight at the State Theatre in Sydney, but there is no fee charge.

13:21.769 --> 13:22.779
Of course not.

13:22.779 --> 13:24.779
-You’re not charging?
-No, no, not at all,

13:24.779 --> 13:27.279
-You are not rounding up money?
-No.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.179
No, I should make. Alright, we thank you for your time.

13:29.179 --> 13:31.079
You're staying another week or so in Australia?
-Yes.

13:31.079 --> 13:35.779
You’ve been to other states, and you are now doing in Sydney?
-Yes. I’ll be going to Melbourne.

13:36.079 --> 13:38.279
-Sydney, Melbourne and New Zealand.
-And to New Zealand also.

13:38.279 --> 13:40.779
Alright, we thank you. I'm sure if you'd like to see Mataji,
-Thank you very much.

13:40.779 --> 13:44.069
you could check your regular newspapers and find where she's meeting people.

13:44.069 --> 13:46.169
Thank you very much today. Please thank Her Mataji.
