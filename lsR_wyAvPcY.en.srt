1
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:15,260
So today is the day when we have to introspect.

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,704
So should we go into meditation, all of us?

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:21,376
Please close your eyes.

4
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:26,087
All of you close your eyes.

5
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:31,742
Now we all will do the meditation the way we have been doing

6
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:37,133
in the halls wherever we had public programs.

7
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:40,188
So the first you have to put your hand on your heart.

8
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:44,518
We'll work on the left hand side, and the left hand towards me.

9
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:50,696
Now, first of all, you put your hand on your heart.

10
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:55,580
In the heart resides Shiva, is the Spirit.

11
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,835
So, you have to thank your Spirit

12
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:08,275
that it has brought light to your attention,

13
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:13,070
because you're a saint and the light that has come in your heart

14
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,856
has to enlighten the whole world.

15
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:20,722
So, please, now in your heart, you pray that,

16
00:01:20,802 --> 00:01:31,255
"Let this light of my love of the Divine spread to the whole world."

17
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:36,520
With all sincerity and understanding

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,709
that you are connected with the Divine

19
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:41,428
and whatever you desire will happen

20
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:45,479
with full confidence in yourself.

21
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:54,757
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

22
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:56,352
on the left hand side,

23
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:59,725
on the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side.

24
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:07,712
And now here is the center of your dharma.

25
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,604
Here you have to pray that,

26
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:14,826
"Let Vishwa Nirmal Dharma spread in the whole world.

27
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,677
Let people see the light

28
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:22,820
through our dharmic life; through our righteousness.

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,530
Let people see them and accept the Vishwa Nirmal Dharm

30
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:36,717
by which they get enlightenment and a benevolent higher life

31
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:41,129
and a desire to ascend."

32
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:49,810
Now take your right hand

33
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,084
in the lower portion of your abdomen of the stomach

34
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:56,563
on the left hand side. Press it.

35
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:02,447
Now this is the center of pure knowledge.

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,961
Here you have to say as Sahaja Yogis

37
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:14,725
that "Our Mother has given us

38
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:20,705
the full idea how the Divine works.

39
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:25,968
She has given us all the mantras and all the pure knowledge

40
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:31,218
that we could bear and understand.

41
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:40,606
Let me fully be knowledgeable about that, all of us."

42
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,786
I have seen if the man is a leader,

43
00:03:42,866 --> 00:03:45,146
the wife doesn't know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

44
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,967
If the woman knows about Sahaja Yoga,

45
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:48,709
the husband doesn't know anything.

46
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:57,922
"Let me be proficient and an expert in this knowledge

47
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:13,336
so that I can give realization to people,

48
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:22,628
make them understand what is Divine Law, what is Kundalini,

49
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:26,019
and what are the chakras.

50
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,685
Let my attention be more on Sahaja Yoga

51
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:34,162
than all these mundane things."

52
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,150
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen.

53
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:44,185
Close your eyes. Now here on the left hand side, press it.

54
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:50,557
Now here, "Mother has given me the Spirit

55
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:54,445
and I have my own guru

56
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:56,844
which is the Spirit.

57
00:04:56,924 --> 00:05:00,982
I am master of my own.

58
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:05,698
Let there be no abandonment.

59
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:09,020
Let there be dignity in my character.

60
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,403
Let there be generosity in my behavior.

61
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:19,262
Let there be compassion and love for other Sahaja Yogis.

62
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:23,610
Let me not show off,

63
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,630
but have a deep,

64
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:30,008
deep knowledge about God's love

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,289
and His doings so that when people come to me,

66
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:40,211
I should be able to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

67
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:43,481
and give them this great knowledge

68
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:47,550
with humility and love."

69
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,335
Now raise your right hand on your heart.

70
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:00,753
Here you have to thank God

71
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:04,868
that you have felt the ocean of joy

72
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:10,974
and you have felt the ocean of forgiveness

73
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:15,732
and the capacity to forgive as our Mother has

74
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:19,289
which we have seen is so tremendous.

75
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:23,478
Let my heart expand

76
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:27,955
and encompass the whole universe.

77
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:36,073
And my love should resound the name of God."

78
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:40,448
The heart, every moment,

79
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:47,047
should express the beauty of God's love.

80
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:54,095
Take your now right hand in the Vishuddhi

81
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:56,663
that is on the left Vishuddhi,

82
00:06:56,743 --> 00:07:03,091
between the neck and the shoulder in the corner.

83
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:10,710
"I will not indulge into the falsehood of guilt,

84
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,664
because I know it is falsehood.

85
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:18,718
I will not escape my faults, but face them

86
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:22,197
and eradicate them.

87
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:27,201
I will not try to find faults with others,

88
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,272
but in my own knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

89
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:33,393
let me remove their faults."

90
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:39,696
We have so many ways; secretly we can remove the faults of others.

91
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,702
"Let my collectivity

92
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:53,031
become so great that the whole Sahaja Yoga race

93
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:55,969
is my own family,

94
00:07:56,049 --> 00:08:02,678
my own children, my home, my everything.

95
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:05,420
Let me get that feeling

96
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,840
completely, innately built within myself

97
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,176
that I am a part and a parcel of the whole,

98
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:15,702
because we all have one Mother.

99
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:19,242
And let my concern go to the whole world,

100
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:22,658
to know what are their problems

101
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:27,015
and how can, through my true desire power

102
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,263
solve that.

103
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:34,313
Let me feel the problems of the world in my heart,

104
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:43,811
and innately to remove all of them

105
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:49,553
from the basis of which they are,

106
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:55,439
from the basis from which they are generated.

107
00:08:55,534 --> 00:09:00,024
Let me go to the principles of all these problems

108
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,280
and try to remove them through my Sahaja Yoga powers,

109
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,466
through my saintly powers."

110
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:12,630
Now put your right hand on your forehead, across.

111
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,562
Now here you have to say, first of all

112
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:22,154
"I have to forgive all those who have not come in Sahaja Yoga,

113
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:26,188
those who are on the periphery, who come and go,

114
00:09:26,268 --> 00:09:28,511
who jump in and jump out.

115
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,492
But, first of all and foremost,

116
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,375
I have to forgive all the Sahaja Yogis,

117
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:38,778
because they are all better than me.

118
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:41,933
I'm the one, who tries to find faults with them,

119
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:47,122
but I am at the lowest ebb and I have to forgive them

120
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:51,813
because I must know that I still have to go very further.

121
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:55,369
I'm still much less. I have to improve myself."

122
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,961
This humility has to come within us,

123
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,119
so you have to say here

124
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,266
"Let the humility in my heart

125
00:10:03,346 --> 00:10:07,597
in a true sense, not hypocritical,

126
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:15,094
work out this feeling of forgiveness,

127
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:25,080
so that I bow to reality, to God, and to Sahaja Yoga."

128
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,189
Now you have to put back your hand on the backside of your head

129
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,631
and push back your head here.

130
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,858
And you have to say here,

131
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:38,454
"O Mother, whatever wrong we have done to You so far,

132
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:41,040
whatever wrong goes in our minds,

133
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,953
and whatever smallness we have shown to You,

134
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,883
whatever way we have troubled You and challenged You,

135
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,818
please forgive us". You have to ask for forgiveness.

136
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:52,113
In your intelligence you should know what I am.

137
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,837
I don't have to tell you again and again.

138
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,929
Now at Sahasrara you have to thank Me.

139
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,976
At Sahasrara, put your hand,

140
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:05,160
move it seven times, and thank Me seven times,

141
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:08,584
"Mother thank You very much for the realization.

142
00:11:08,664 --> 00:11:11,563
And Mother, thank You very much formaking us

143
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:13,651
understand how great we are.

144
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,191
And thank You very much

145
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,649
for bringing all the blessings of the Divine.

146
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:21,291
And thank You very much for raising us higher,

147
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:24,315
much higher, than from where we were.

148
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:27,729
And also thank You very much for sustaining us

149
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:32,269
and for helping us to improve ourselves and correct ourselves.

150
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:35,349
And thank You very much ultimately that Mother,

151
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,057
You have come on this earth, taken Your birth,

152
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:43,032
and working so hard for us, for all of us."

153
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:49,675
Press it hard and move it hard.

154
00:12:18,957 --> 00:12:22,048
Now take down your hands.

155
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:25,564
Heads are all very hot.

156
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:29,525
So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan.

157
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:34,486
In the Bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right.

158
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:39,153
One, nicely, understanding what you are, what are your auras.

159
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:42,082
Now again, second one.

160
00:12:44,782 --> 00:12:47,536
Now the third one.

161
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,421
Now the fourth one.

162
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,486
Now the fifth.

163
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,076
Now the sixth one.

164
00:13:07,343 --> 00:13:10,554
And now the seventh.

165
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:13,043
Now raise your Kundalini.

166
00:13:13,123 --> 00:13:16,303
Raise your Kundalini, slowly, very slowly.

167
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:19,193
Raise it, first time you have to do it very slowly.

168
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:22,985
Now push back your heads, and give it a knot,

169
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:24,680
one knot.

170
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,791
Second one, let's do it, very slowly

171
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:31,246
and knowing what you are, you're a saint.

172
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:34,662
Do it, properly, properly, do it properly, not in a haste.

173
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:36,933
Take it to your head, push back your head

174
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:42,224
and give it two knots there, one and two.

175
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:43,657
Now let's do the other one.

176
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:47,443
Again the third one we have to give three knots.

177
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:53,827
Very slowly do it, very slowly. Now do it properly.

178
00:13:53,907 --> 00:14:01,072
Now push back your head, now give it the third one, three times.

179
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:08,746
