00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.417
When we talk of materialism,

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:18.792
we are acting against our Mother Earth.

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:26.549
Instead of learning from Her subtler qualities,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.509
we are trying to exploit Her, to dig her out,

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.958
to use Her for our selfish motives.

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:39.791
What does She do to us?

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.375
She creates these beautiful fruits for you to eat.

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:48.250
She creates beautiful trees for you to make furniture,

00:00:48.707 --> 00:00:50.625
to make nice houses.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:55.667
She gives you green grass to soothe your nerves.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:03.874
She carries so many rivers and so many huge big oceans

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:07.083
on Her being.

00:01:07.164 --> 00:01:11.164
She’s always larger than the largest of oceans.

00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:15.208
Such a great thing as She is,

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:20.999
what do we do to Her is to exploit Her fully,

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:24.125
indiscriminately.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.833
Then the reactions are set in.

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:29.749
The beautiful cycle of nature is broken

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.458
by our aggressive attitude,

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.667
and absolutely indiscreet.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.583
Then this Mother Earth doesn’t do anything as such

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:46.041
Herself, not much;

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.708
but then the ether starts acting,

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:55.708
and you have problems, what we call as acid rains,

00:01:56.208 --> 00:02:00.708
plastic, all kinds of problems that come out of this

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.997
indiscreet creation.

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.999
When we started making machinery,

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:10.441
without any balance

00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:14.625
we started producing machinery,

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:18.667
just like mad.

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:24.333
As a result of that, now we have become slaves of machines.

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:27.387
We can’t do anything with our own hands.

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:31.874
Because of machines, people have become unemployed.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.178
As I’ve said many a times that machines are for us,

00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.500
we are not for the machines.

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:41.275
But today the situation is very different.

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:44.417
We are entirely into the hands of machines –

00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:48.083
again the same indiscreet behavior,

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:52.166
again the same imbalances.

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:56.291
Mother Earth teaches us balance.

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:58.583
If She was not in a balance,

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.208
we would have been all finished.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.707
She teaches us gravity.

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:10.625
She teaches us how to be attractive to another person

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.791
without the other person knowing about it,

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:18.125
feeling about it.

00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:25.749
Without enslaving, without mesmerizing,

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:33.874
without obliging, to attract and to give

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:36.958
without expectations.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:40.417
Without any expectations She gives us;

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:42.542
whether we respect Her not,

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.625
whether we’ll treat Her not,

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.041
we give Her.

00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:51.619
Possessiveness is not the quality of Mother Earth,

00:03:52.037 --> 00:03:54.495
She doesn’t possess anyone.

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:57.619
For example, if you are an Indian

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.495
you can come to England, you can go anywhere,

00:04:00.703 --> 00:04:02.120
you can live anywhere.

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.454
She doesn’t possess anyone as such;

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:09.454
we only the human beings have made this world into

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:11.786
different countries, different places –

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.620
all our own ideas of stupidity.

00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.661
There’s only one world,

00:04:19.037 --> 00:04:21.661
there’s only one world God has created.

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:23.245
He has not created …

00:04:23.703 --> 00:04:27.953
It’s rather awkward here. Allright now better.

00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:49.953
She has not created all these nations.

00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:53.245
Only there are ravines

00:04:54.162 --> 00:04:58.953
through which big rivers flow.

00:04:59.318 --> 00:05:02.734
Sometimes, wherever She has raised Herself,

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:05.995
there are mountains.

00:05:06.132 --> 00:05:10.381
These are Her different dulations and different varieties,

00:05:10.924 --> 00:05:12.841
just to create beauty.

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.956
Supposing the whole world was like a bald-headed

00:05:17.037 --> 00:05:20.830
gentleman, what would have happened to us?

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:25.952
First of all, we all would have slipped out, I think!

00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:30.028
Or else, what would have happened

00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:34.643
if it was nothing but just all over the forest,

00:05:35.276 --> 00:05:38.151
or all over only the mountains,

00:05:38.372 --> 00:05:41.165
or all over just the rivers?

00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:50.120
To create the beauty She has used all these things

00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:57.366
to make us happy, to give us joy, to entertain us.

00:05:57.911 --> 00:06:01.412
She created all this beautiful stage for us.

00:06:01.681 --> 00:06:03.348
And what do we do?

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:06.137
We have divided Her into parts,

00:06:06.828 --> 00:06:09.537
that this is my country,

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:14.745
this is your country, this is their country.

00:06:15.493 --> 00:06:20.951
When we die, what is our country?

00:06:22.805 --> 00:06:24.390
We are all dead bodies,

00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:28.162
whether you are buried in a church or in the open,

00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:30.327
you are all in the Mother Earth.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.113
What is our country is that we are the Mother Earth.

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:40.468
So we have to understand that this body is made

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:43.175
out of that Mother Earth to which it has to go,

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:47.870
and we are stupid to feel that we belong to this country or to that country.

00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:52.700
Of course, this is the greatest miracle of the maya,

00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:54.162
that people know this

00:06:54.243 --> 00:06:56.827
but still they do not want to believe it.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.537
There are so many truths they know:

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:02.181
they are sure, they know about it,

00:07:02.262 --> 00:07:04.263
but they don’t want to believe it.

00:07:04.765 --> 00:07:07.640
Or they believe it, but they don’t want to accept it.

00:07:07.972 --> 00:07:12.124
And even if they accept it, they don’t want to know about it.

00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:17.307
It’s a funny human miracle that they know

00:07:17.388 --> 00:07:19.861
that nothing belongs to us.

00:07:19.957 --> 00:07:23.146
When we come on this Earth our hands are like this;

00:07:23.227 --> 00:07:26.185
when we go, everything is like this.
