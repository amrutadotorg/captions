1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,701
So these two conditionings,

2
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:19,501
which actually are on the brain,

3
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:24,200
these two conditions freeze the heart

4
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:31,868
and also make the domain of heart as zero

5
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:36,634
and then the brain starts asserting itself.

6
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:43,934
That is how we do not know how to be kind to others,

7
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,400
how to be nice, how to be helpful,

8
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:51,767
how to be gentle and how to be reassuring,

9
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,701
protecting others.

10
00:00:56,634 --> 00:01:03,734
All this we have inherited already.

11
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:07,701
We have already got a stone heart when we come to Sahaja Yoga

12
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:12,133
and we have a brain either full of ego or superego.

13
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:14,901
So now, with your Kundalini rising,

14
00:01:14,968 --> 00:01:18,767
you can clear out your head, first of all.

15
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:24,000
So, the sincerity will come when the Kundalini will move

16
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,734
and touch your Brahmarandra,

17
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:31,334
which is the seat of your heart and will expand.

18
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,000
Then the heart just comes back like a king,

19
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:38,434
returns back and starts dominating the brain.

20
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,067
And when the heart comes back,

21
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:44,300
you immediately find those people with whom we were angry,

22
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:46,934
we would not talk, we had nothing to do,

23
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:48,634
suddenly, we become friendly with them.

24
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,667
There's no problem.

25
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:55,534
In many ways, people have harmed you.

26
00:01:55,567 --> 00:02:00,701
All that harming and everything just disappears.

27
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:04,801
And you start becoming so nice and beautiful.

28
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,334
What has happened that Kundalini has touched

29
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:11,300
your Brahmarandra, where is the seat of heart.

30
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:14,838
And as soon as that opens out, your heart also opens

31
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,100
and it gets awakened.

32
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:20,801
It thinks 'Oh, what? I have allowed this brain to rule me?

33
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:24,601
How dare it rules me!' It just jumps on it.

34
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:27,234
And we have seen people:

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,934
suddenly, they're so much transformed that it's remarkable.

36
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:35,367
There - one gentleman in America, he said that

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,100
'Mother, after Realization I was so much changed

38
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:44,300
that I've become a very mild person

39
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:47,601
and I never used to wish my uncle or anyone.'

40
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,868
So he met him in some sort of a fete and then he said,

41
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,400
'Hello, uncle!'

42
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:54,200
The uncle started looking at him.

43
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:58,400
'Are you all right?' He would never say that.

44
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:02,434
Then he went and saw: 'Are you all right, uncle? Are you keeping all right?

45
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,400
Can I do something for you?' Very nice things he said.

46
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:09,968
Uncle said, 'What have you been doing? Are you drunk or what?

47
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:14,534
How can you speak so sweetly to me? I can't believe it.'

48
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,734
That's what happens.

49
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:19,234
And that's why we have to understand

50
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:23,167
that all these things can be easily dropped out

51
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,167
because we have acquired them.

52
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:28,501
They can be finished off because we have acquired them.

53
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:33,334
They need not be all our lives, our relations.

54
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:36,100
So, ego and superego, both can be

55
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:41,100
blasted off once your heart is awakened.

56
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:44,901
So, when we are dealing with people,

57
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,968
we have to break the ice also

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,934
by communicating with others in a very decent manner.

59
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:54,734
Like telling yourself,

60
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,334
'No, I don't believe that this man is so bad.

61
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,567
Let me look after him, he may be all right.

62
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:02,734
You see, I don't think he's so bad.'

63
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:06,734
So, to accept somebody as bad is very easy for human beings

64
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,400
and once they start accepting such a thing,

65
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:11,868
then they build up a kind of a fortress in which they live

66
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:15,167
and they think they are the best people

67
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,868
and nobody else are good.

68
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:22,200
And thus, the whole community, the whole society,

69
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:28,200
the whole humanity gets bitten by these ideas.

70
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:36,400
And Sahaja Yoga is the only way which is going to cure it.

71
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:42,234
Sahaja Yoga is the only way which is going to finish this.

72
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:49,501
And that part is to be played by you people,

73
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:53,167
to understand that sincerity can only come

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,934
if you raise your Kundalini again and again

75
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:59,667
and open your Brahmarandra.

76
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:02,701
Then your heart will rise.

77
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:08,234
It will become a very awakened personality

78
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,567
and it will take charge of your brain,

79
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,567
which is all the time thinking, thinking, thinking, like mad.

80
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:18,100
And once that happens, then you will realize that

81
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:22,501
now you have jumped into doubtless awareness.

82
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:28,834
So, the relationship between the two has to be fully understood.

83
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:31,501
At first, the domination of the heart

84
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:35,934
or, we can say, the kinghood of heart is challenged,

85
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,801
is put down, brought to zero.

86
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:44,200
And then this brain becomes the king, and it starts ruling us.

87
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:53,701
'I think...', 'I feel...' means the brain, the ego.

88
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,901
If you could give up

89
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:01,033
'I think...', 'I want...',

90
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:05,534
everything will be all right. You should say:

91
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:10,467
I want... is not the point. This body wants it.'

92
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,133
You separate yourself.

93
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,367
Gradually you start separating yourself

94
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:18,734
from all such situations by never saying 'I want...'

95
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:23,334
You should say, 'This body...', 'This hand...', 'This head...'

96
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,334
You start separating.

97
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,100
And once you have separated,

98
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:33,100
all these barriers of ego and superego will disappear.

99
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:39,100
But, as it is, also it's very easy to get rid of these two.

100
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,834
It's very easy to get rid of these two.

101
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,267
Only by raising your Kundalini

102
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,067
and breaking your Brahmarandra.

103
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,968
This is the greatest achievement that you have got,

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,901
that you can break your Brahmarandra,

105
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:56,434
make your Kundalini get connected

106
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:57,968
with the All-pervading Power.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,267
That's why I always say you must meditate

108
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,234
and you must be in thoughtless awareness,

109
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:03,667
then it works out.

110
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,901
Like, from the river Ganges,

111
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:13,634
if you have to fetch the water,

112
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,801
you must have proper pitchers

113
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:18,601
which are deep enough to receive the water.

114
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:21,968
But if you take a stone, what can you bring out of it?

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,300
But the Ganges flows. It is what it is.

116
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:28,167
It has its own capacities in it.

117
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,601
It doesn't change because you people have taken stones.

118
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:34,767
So now you have to understand

119
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:38,200
that raise your Kundalini as many times as you can.

120
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:41,534
Try to put attention to your Kundalini all the time.

121
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,534
See where is the problem is. Get it cleared out, absolutely cleared out.

122
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:47,434
Find out where is the problem is

123
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,167
and raise your Kundalini

124
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:53,534
many a times and see that you are flowing all right

125
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,667
on your fontanel bone area,

126
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,267
so that your heart expands.

127
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,734
It's a mechanical process in a way, you can say.

128
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:04,100
But even that you people don't do.

129
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,767
If you had done that, your heart would have increased.

130
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:12,868
And you yourself will say, 'Mother, my heart has become large like Asia.'

131
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:15,200
And then you see the miracle of the heart,

132
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:19,267
how it emits vibrations by which

133
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,501
you become such compassionate,

134
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:26,934
such dynamic, beautiful people and so sincere to Sahaja Yog.

135
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:31,968
I would request you to open your heart today for this puja.

136
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,167
You have been very jubilant and happy.

137
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,567
And must be your heart must have opened

138
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:39,734
because I've seen that Sahaja Yogis have a very large heart for Me,

139
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:43,167
but for themselves they don't have.

140
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,167
They'll do everything for Me,

141
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:48,100
but nothing for themselves.

142
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:52,434
They'll work morning till evening to decorate the hall, to do everything.

143
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:55,834
They must have sent all these flowers to Me from I don't know where.

144
00:08:55,868 --> 00:09:00,934
But if I tell them 'You meditate for yourself', that they will not do.

145
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:05,267
Or 'You achieve this for yourself', that they will not do.

146
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,634
This is the situation.

147
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:13,567
So, instead of wasting all your energy for decorating all these things,

148
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:16,434
you should decorate yourself within yourself.

149
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:19,901
With sincerity, with nice thoughts about yourself

150
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:24,067
that you are capable, absolutely capable people

151
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:29,701
and you can use your imagination,

152
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,234
your intelligence, rationality,

153
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,868
whatever you think you have,

154
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:39,434
to find the way, to find the way, again I say,

155
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:43,601
to keep your heart large.

156
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,200
And this is the message for today's birthday all over the world

157
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:53,767
because I felt that the whole world

158
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,534
was today like a big heart pulsating.

159
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:01,501
I received the last phone and came here.

160
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:11,334
From all over the phones coming, flowers are showering,

161
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:14,667
the beautiful nice things they are saying. Everything is there.

162
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:18,667
When I am just drenched into it,

163
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,033
just drenched, it was too much for Me.

164
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,434
Such sweet, sweet things

165
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:26,334
from the children, such things from the ladies,

166
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:29,601
some very, very nice from the men

167
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:32,734
and it was amazing how these people

168
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:37,834
are bubbling with enjoyment that today is My birthday.

169
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,367
In the same way,

170
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,501
please consider that every day is your birthday,

171
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:48,767
that you have to raise your Kundalini all the time

172
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:53,334
and keep the standard of your Kundalini higher and higher.

173
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,067
The more you open out,

174
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,834
the more threads of Kundalini will come up

175
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:02,601
and the more your heart will open out

176
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:06,267
and it will be awakened, it will become more powerful.

177
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,734
And with an open, big heart and a powerful heart,

178
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,400
you can dominate your brain,

179
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:15,167
which is giving you all these funny ideas.

180
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:18,701
I hope this will happen this year

181
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:23,300
here and people will try to make it a point

182
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:26,234
that we have a large heart.

183
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:28,601
Large heart doesn't mean stupidity,

184
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,000
doesn't mean that.

185
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:36,968
Large heart means the heart in which you can put Me in.

186
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:42,534
It's quite a big person, Myself,

187
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,834
so you have to have a very large heart

188
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:47,300
that I could reside into your heart.

189
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:49,367
That is the large heart

190
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,701
and that's what you all should have.

191
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:56,234
If that happens, then everything will work out very well.

192
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,834
So, the surrendering part of it:

193
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:01,567
you must know how to surrender

194
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:05,501
and you must know how to keep whatever is not surrendered,

195
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:09,601
because you surrender yourself

196
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:16,767
in such a manner that you expand your heart absolutely.

197
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,434
Put Me down there

198
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,567
and then keep your flowers

199
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:25,200
with you to be given to Me at a time

200
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:32,534
when you are in complete control of yourself.

201
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,667
So you have your emotions,

202
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:38,167
your feelings like flowers,

203
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,133
that you have to keep to yourself,

204
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:44,667
which are the part of the same ocean of your heart.

205
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:48,701
And, once you are ready,

206
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,133
everything is done,

207
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,567
if the whole house is ready,

208
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,868
now bring the flowers, the emotions,

209
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:01,400
the nice things, the beautiful things and nourish them.

210
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:03,033
One must learn, I think,

211
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:06,234
there should be some books about

212
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:09,334
how to say nice things to others.

213
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,467
We should try to find some books like that

214
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:16,534
or should write some books how nice things could be said,

215
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,901
how we can take care of others,

216
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:24,968
how we can make another feel our love,

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,834
the expression of love,

218
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:30,934
and that work, such a book will really help people to understand

219
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:32,934
that this is nice to say.

220
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:35,868
And once you say something nice to other,

221
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:40,767
that niceness comes back, as I have told you,

222
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,767
like the ripples that touch the shores come back

223
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,634
and then you feel very happy.

224
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:50,901
Go on saying things which are nice,

225
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:53,634
which are pleasing,

226
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,634
will be very much appreciated.

227
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,667
But if you say it with sincerity, not just to tease someone

228
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:01,067
or to say something,

229
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,000
just to be so superficially good,

230
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:06,067
like 'Thank you, thank you, thank you,'

231
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:09,601
but something from your heart, as they say,

232
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,667
then you will be surprised

233
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:15,133
that the heart of the another person will open

234
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,467
and from that heart will flow

235
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:21,701
those beautiful flowers of emotions towards you.

236
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:25,300
So, on one side, you have to expand your heart

237
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:30,067
and on another side, you have to reserve or preserve

238
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,100
all the beautiful, nice, delicate feelings within yourself,

239
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,033
absorbed from everywhere

240
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,734
and then to pour them out at the right point.

241
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,968
That's the art.

242
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:45,667
Like these flowers were in the garden first to begin with,

243
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,000
preserved, preserved.

244
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,167
At the right time they were brought in.

245
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,300
So they feel more glorified

246
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,767
that they are used at the right time.

247
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:58,100
This is the way we have to be with ourselves in our heart

248
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:01,934
because human beings are very delicate,

249
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,033
very beautiful things

250
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,968
and to beautify them you have to say beautiful things.

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,234
This tongue is not for saying harsh things,

252
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,400
for making fun of others,

253
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:17,868
for teasing others, but is for saying something,

254
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,968
such a beautiful thing

255
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:25,100
that the another person also imbibes that beauty.

256
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:29,267
I've seen some nice things people have said

257
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:32,667
and that lingers in My mind. And I said,

258
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:36,601
'When will I have chance to say these things to others?'

259
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:40,534
So, think about it, that 'Now this is a very nice sentence',

260
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,701
'This was a very sweet thing they said.

261
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,100
All right. So now, where should I use this?'

262
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,100
As I go to the shops,

263
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,801
I see something: 'Ah, that's good.

264
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:54,133
That will be good for particular person. Let's buy that.'

265
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,534
In the same way,

266
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,400
if you find these nice feelings

267
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:02,400
and nice emotions and nice things said,

268
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,300
then what do you do?

269
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,367
You collect them, all these things,

270
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,300
keep them and use them at the right time,

271
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:11,634
at the right place.

272
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:16,033
This is what is the wisdom of Shri Ganesha.

273
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:20,868
Innocent people are the most sincere people,

274
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,801
innocent people.

275
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,767
Those who are clever and cunning

276
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:29,033
cannot be sincere because they enjoy their cunningness,

277
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:33,167
they enjoy their so-called 'brilliance'.

278
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,968
They can never be.

279
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:41,667
Those people who are simple,

280
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,934
who are loving,

281
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:48,601
who care for love more than anything else,

282
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:56,133
can only say very nice things sincerely.

283
00:16:56,167 --> 00:17:01,367
Today I wanted to say many things to you,

284
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:11,200
how I feel about this birthday in Australia,

285
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:14,534
but I told you the words fail.

286
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,901
Because - see, Australia is such a far-off country.

287
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:21,367
To come here with so many people sitting

288
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,868
and singing 'Agata Swagata'.

289
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:28,901
It is unbelievable, unbelievable,

290
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,300
because I have not given you any money,

291
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,100
you have not given Me any money,

292
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:36,934
you are not bound to say anything like that.

293
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,300
But not only that you are doing it,

294
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:43,834
but you are enjoying it.

295
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:48,100
It's something great. You're enjoying it and that's what it is:

296
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,367
that when your heart is large,

297
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,300
then whatever you do for others, you enjoy.

298
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:55,267
You enjoy doing good things.

299
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,234
You enjoy saying nice things.

300
00:17:57,267 --> 00:18:02,133
So we should have choicest flowers of beautiful sayings,

301
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:06,467
we should have choicest emotions

302
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:09,267
which we should be able to express to each other.

303
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,667
Now start on that from today,

304
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,901
I have to say: you start on this,

305
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:18,968
that from 1990 we are all the time going to speak something

306
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:22,033
beautiful to each other all the time

307
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,534
and just keep your ears open,

308
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:28,234
keep your eyes open and wherever you get a chance,

309
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,567
wherever you hear something like that,

310
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:34,267
keep it in your mind and use it back.

311
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,000
Today I am so enamored

312
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,667
and it is too much for Me, really,

313
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:42,968
to believe even that

314
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:46,801
there are so many Sahaja Yogis in Australia,

315
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,834
which is so far away.

316
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:50,434
So try to develop your sincerity

317
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:54,100
Raise your Kundalini as many times as you can.

318
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,534
Keep it there. Keep it on Sahasrara

319
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:01,734
and see that your heart opens. That's the best way.

320
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,501
They've been all asking Me 'How to open our heart?'

321
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:08,501
I said, 'Take the key.' Now, I don't know how to tell them.

322
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:12,701
'Open your heart' means just raise your Kundalini,

323
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:17,367
keep to the Brahmarandra and see that the Brahmarandra opens.
