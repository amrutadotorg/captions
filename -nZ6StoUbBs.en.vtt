00:02.000 --> 00:06.892
1995-1225 Christmas Puja Talk, Ganapatipule, India,

24:28.096 --> 24:34.988
It is a great day when Christ came on this earth.

24:37.096 --> 24:45.988
And you know about how He was specially created

24:46.096 --> 24:57.988
to come down as a human being to work out the salvation of the people.

25:09.096 --> 25:16.988
It is said that He came to India, in Kashmir,

25:17.096 --> 25:22.988
and He met there the King Shalivahana.

25:26.096 --> 25:38.988
It’s all in Sanskrit; I’ve read that the conversation took place between Christ and King Shalivahana,

25:39.096 --> 25:43.988
who was a great devotee of the Mother.

25:45.096 --> 25:49.988
And he asked Him, “What is Your name?” In Sanskrit it’s all written.

25:52.096 --> 25:57.988
So He said, “I come from a country where people believe in filth,

25:58.096 --> 26:01.988
and I think this is My own country.”

26:02.096 --> 26:07.988
So Shalivahana said, “You are such a great person, who has come on this earth,

26:11.096 --> 26:16.988
so You should go back to those countries to save them

26:17.096 --> 26:26.988
and to tell them about the pure principle of life.”

26:27.096 --> 26:30.988
In Sanskrit it was written Nirmala Tattwa.

26:34.096 --> 26:44.988
And Christ went back, and after three and a half years only He was crucified.

26:54.096 --> 27:00.988
These were special days, I call them the days of tapasya.

27:03.096 --> 27:06.988
Same time Buddha and Mahavira were born,

27:07.096 --> 27:15.988
at the same level of the Virata’s forehead.

27:16.096 --> 27:35.988
As you know that according to Vedas, there are seven awarenesses we can go through,

27:36.096 --> 27:42.988
or the subtle qualities we have within ourselves.

27:43.096 --> 27:51.988
The first one was the Bhu. Bhu is Ganesha was created.

27:52.096 --> 28:01.988
Second is Bhurvah, meaning antariksha, means “all that is created around us.”

28:06.096 --> 28:10.988
The third one is Swaha at Nabhi Chakra.

28:11.096 --> 28:14.988
Swaha is the one where you consume everything.

28:15.096 --> 28:20.988
Is in modern times, you see, people go on consuming everything.

28:21.096 --> 28:24.988
All kinds of books they will read; they’ll go to all kinds of things,

28:25.096 --> 28:26.988
and if you tell them, “Why do you do it?”

28:27.096 --> 28:29.988
“What’s wrong?”

28:30.096 --> 28:31.988
“Why do you dress up like this?”

28:32.096 --> 28:33.988
“What’s wrong?”

28:34.096 --> 28:38.988
This just consumption of everything goes on.

28:41.096 --> 28:45.988
But then at that time also there is

28:46.096 --> 28:50.988
another great thing within us is called as Swadha,

28:51.096 --> 29:01.988
where we sustain the dharma within us. Swadha.

29:02.096 --> 29:04.988
Dharma of everything.

29:05.096 --> 29:10.988
See, those people who say there should be no blind faith and this and that,

29:11.096 --> 29:14.988
it’s not blind, but it’s an inner urge.

29:15.096 --> 29:19.988
Why we love our parents? Because there’s a dharma within us.

29:20.096 --> 29:23.988
Why do we live, we live in our country?

29:24.096 --> 29:25.988
Because there’s a dharma within us.

29:26.096 --> 29:30.988
All these dharmas are there. Why a wife loves her husband?

29:31.096 --> 29:33.988
Because there is dharma.

29:34.096 --> 29:36.988
Why the husband loves the wife? Because there is dharma.

29:37.096 --> 29:41.988
When this dharma is within you - we'll not call it religion

29:42.096 --> 29:48.988
because it can mean something else – this one is sustained, dharaiti.

29:49.096 --> 29:54.988
Once it is sustained within ourselves, it becomes Swadha.

29:55.096 --> 29:57.988
That’s our capacity; that’s our quality.

29:58.096 --> 30:03.988
We can call it an innate understanding.

30:04.096 --> 30:07.988
Some of them are even in the animals,

30:08.096 --> 30:13.988
like attachment to parents, attachment to their masters.

30:19.096 --> 30:27.988
Then comes the higher awareness where your Manah - now it's not mind.

30:28.096 --> 30:30.988
There’s very confusion; there’s a big confusion. Mind,

30:31.096 --> 30:34.988
you see, English language is really quite confusing.

30:35.096 --> 30:39.988
Manah means “by which we have emotions.”

30:40.096 --> 30:46.988
Now recently I read that they are now talking about, not only of IQ

30:47.096 --> 30:50.988
but EQ, means emotional coefficience.

30:52.096 --> 30:57.988
That means a person who has only intelligence is not all right,

30:58.096 --> 31:02.988
he must also have the balance of emotions. They are coming to it now.

31:03.096 --> 31:06.988
But first they only used to praise people who have IQ.

31:07.096 --> 31:12.988
That’s not the situation. So now it is different,

31:13.096 --> 31:21.988
perhaps they are realizing that through intelligence how people have created chaos, violence,

31:22.096 --> 31:28.988
all kinds of destruction on this earth.

31:29.096 --> 31:33.988
So now they are talking about a higher capacity within us

31:34.096 --> 31:38.988
called as EQ, which capacity is emotional.

31:39.096 --> 31:49.988
This emotional capacity comes to you as an inner urge,

31:50.096 --> 31:57.988
as an inner capability which you cannot avoid.

31:58.096 --> 32:05.988
A person may be anything in life, but if he has no love,

32:06.096 --> 32:15.988
if he hasn’t got any emotional feelings, then he is not complete.

32:16.096 --> 32:22.988
Now these emotional things also could be very limited, no doubt.

32:23.096 --> 32:28.988
There could be something that get attached to somebody, or something can happen,

32:29.096 --> 32:34.988
as also the IQ, where we get attached to some idea.

32:35.096 --> 32:41.988
Like Hitler had some idea, and he believed that it was the truth, and he has to do it.

32:42.096 --> 32:46.988
So when you get attached to one idea like that,

32:47.096 --> 32:58.988
you can just do things which are not at all helpful, supportive or nourishing to reality.

33:01.096 --> 33:08.988
All these things have happened: wars, destruction, also,

33:09.096 --> 33:15.988
as you see nowadays, the people are trying to secretly destroy others.

33:16.096 --> 33:23.988
All these are coming as the anti-feeling

33:24.096 --> 33:33.988
where the Manah has developed a domination of the intelligence,

33:35.096 --> 33:41.988
where emotions are dominated by intelligence and rationality.

33:47.096 --> 33:51.988
So there is another awareness within us, another capability within us,

33:52.096 --> 33:56.988
another urge within us, innately built is the Janah.

33:57.096 --> 34:00.988
Janah means the people, the communication.

34:03.096 --> 34:10.988
You cannot live alone; you see a man who goes to jail, he’s quite happy,

34:11.096 --> 34:16.988
he’s quite comfortable, he doesn’t have to do any work, everything is done for him

34:17.096 --> 34:23.988
if he has a good class, he lives very well, much better than he would live outside.

34:24.096 --> 34:33.988
But the only thing is, he cannot meet other people, he cannot communicate.

34:34.096 --> 34:39.988
And when this capacity of communication which is within us - I mean,

34:40.096 --> 34:47.988
which is a part and parcel of human existence - is taken away,

34:48.096 --> 34:54.988
a person in the jail feels absolutely frustrated and unhappy.

35:00.096 --> 35:07.988
He doesn’t mind laboring, doing all kinds of menial work,

35:08.096 --> 35:17.988
as long as he’s not in the jail, cut out of the communications with others.

35:20.096 --> 35:25.988
So this communication is also an inner urge within us.

35:26.096 --> 35:32.988
In that also people sometimes go too far and neglect other dharmas.

35:33.096 --> 35:34.988
They are more bothered about communication

35:35.096 --> 35:37.988
than about other dharmas which are very important.

35:38.096 --> 35:42.988
So there is no balance in a person.

35:46.096 --> 35:56.988
Then comes the sixth awareness within us, which is a very interesting thing.

35:57.096 --> 36:02.988
One was where we take to conditionings.

36:04.096 --> 36:10.988
Say, if I am an Indian, then I am very proud of Indians;

36:11.096 --> 36:16.988
I can never see anything wrong with them, or I may see everything wrong with them,

36:17.096 --> 36:19.988
it can be both ways.

36:20.096 --> 36:22.988
How you have been conditioned is the point,

36:23.096 --> 36:30.988
and this conditioning comes to us through our sixth center of Agnya.

36:32.096 --> 36:35.988
And the another thing that we develop

36:36.096 --> 36:42.988
when somebody tries to condition us or to control us,

36:43.096 --> 36:50.988
we try to get out of it, or sometimes we try to dominate.

36:51.096 --> 36:57.988
This dominating capacity is also within us innately built.

37:00.096 --> 37:07.988
Both things are innately built within us that we go on getting ourselves conditioned.

37:11.096 --> 37:17.988
For example I would say that in very stupid, silly manner, people get conditioned,

37:18.096 --> 37:22.988
is impossible to get them out of it.

37:23.096 --> 37:33.988
It always comes out of self-centeredness that a person has no value for understanding.

37:36.096 --> 37:41.988
Like now somebody comes to your house, he’s a vegetarian,

37:42.096 --> 37:44.988
all right. Now he stays with you.

37:45.096 --> 37:50.988
So, "I’m a vegetarian, you must get new utensils to cook the food

37:51.096 --> 37:56.988
because I can’t have food in the utensils where the meat is cooked.”

37:57.096 --> 38:04.988
All right. Then, “You must get your servant in a proper manner,

38:05.096 --> 38:14.988
so send him to some place where you can get the well water.”

38:15.096 --> 38:21.988
The servant must be absolutely drenched - this is typical Indian old style -

38:22.096 --> 38:30.988
and should go and draw the water from the well, and “bring me it for drinking and cooking,”

38:31.096 --> 38:34.988
while the servant dies of pneumonia, doesn’t matter.

38:35.096 --> 38:39.988
All such stupid conditionings we have,

38:40.096 --> 38:45.988
but it's not only that in the East you find all these conditionings - the West is even worse.

38:46.096 --> 38:50.988
For example, they have clubbing.

38:51.096 --> 39:00.988
Now, there are clubs where people wear particular type of clothes;

39:01.096 --> 39:07.988
it’s a club. Now, if they wear something else then everybody will laugh at them.

39:08.096 --> 39:15.988
Or how to use the spoon and fork is very important in the West, how they use spoon and fork.

39:16.096 --> 39:19.988
Specially English have this nonsensical conditioning.

39:20.096 --> 39:24.988
If somebody uses the fork and spoon in a wrong way then, finished!

39:25.096 --> 39:29.988
He is nowhere; he is not sophisticated.

39:30.096 --> 39:38.988
The ideas of sophistication and all that comes through conditioning of ages,

39:39.096 --> 39:44.988
because maybe they were primitive to begin with, they had no clothes,

39:45.096 --> 39:47.988
proper clothes to wear,

39:48.096 --> 39:54.988
might be they were covering themselves with some leaves or something,

39:55.096 --> 40:00.988
I mean, only hundreds of years back.

40:01.096 --> 40:06.988
So now they have jumped to the other side, very particular about their dress,

40:07.096 --> 40:12.988
very particular about fork and spoon.

40:13.096 --> 40:19.988
And they just can’t bear something that is different.

40:20.096 --> 40:24.988
“I don’t like that,” is very common there, “I don’t like. I don’t like.”

40:26.096 --> 40:28.988
Now, they came to India, “We don’t like.”

40:29.096 --> 40:31.988
“What you don’t like?”

40:32.096 --> 40:33.988
“We don’t like the way Indians dress up.”

40:34.096 --> 40:36.988
“All right, you dress up the way you like,

40:37.096 --> 40:39.988
let Indians dress up the like they like.

40:40.096 --> 40:45.988
Now why do you think that your dress in England will suit here in India,

40:46.096 --> 40:50.988
which is such a hot, hot, hot country?”

40:51.096 --> 40:55.988
But no, “This is how we are.” It’s quite funny the way they have,

40:56.096 --> 41:07.988
and this conditioning goes on into such a deep manner that nobody sees the stupidity behind it.

41:08.096 --> 41:13.988
For example, if the Queen has invited you, you must wear a tailcoat,

41:14.096 --> 41:17.988
and now it's very expensive to have a tailcoat.

41:18.096 --> 41:21.988
Now, they have to go to a particular shop to borrow it.

41:22.096 --> 41:25.988
Sometimes they're loose, and sometimes they're tight.

41:26.096 --> 41:30.988
I have seen people coming to these parties, Queen’s parties,

41:31.096 --> 41:35.988
I could never recognize them because somebody looked like Charlie Chaplin,

41:36.096 --> 41:40.988
or somebody looked like Laurel, or somebody like Hardy.

41:41.096 --> 41:43.988
I couldn’t make out who are these people.

41:44.096 --> 41:46.988
Then I was told, “He's that such and such ambassador.”

41:47.096 --> 41:49.988
“Oh my God, I know him very well, what has happened to him?”

41:50.096 --> 41:51.988
They cannot walk straight,

41:52.096 --> 41:59.988
their gait changes because of the clothes which are so tight sometimes, and sometimes so loose.

42:00.096 --> 42:01.988
But you have to wear.

42:02.096 --> 42:08.988
All these formal ideas come to us as a kind of a part and parcel of you,

42:09.096 --> 42:12.988
because you accept all these conditionings.

42:13.096 --> 42:18.988
So the other side it goes to, that we abandon all this,

42:19.096 --> 42:21.988
we don’t want all, we're anti-culture.

42:23.096 --> 42:26.988
So I met one gentleman who was wearing a pant which had lots of holes in it.

42:27.096 --> 42:31.988
Imagine in the cold of London to wear a pant like that.

42:32.096 --> 42:37.988
So I said, “Why do you want to wear a pant which has holes?”

42:38.096 --> 42:39.988
He said, “This is a holy pant."

42:40.096 --> 42:42.988
“Holey?

42:43.096 --> 42:47.988
My goodness, it will give you varicose veins, it's horrible.”

42:48.096 --> 42:49.988
“What’s wrong?

42:50.096 --> 42:55.988
We are anti-culture people so we are taking now to holey pants.”

42:56.096 --> 42:59.988
I mean, such stupid people are not only who are uneducated,

43:00.096 --> 43:06.988
but very well educated people, highly-placed people, are so conditioned,

43:07.096 --> 43:12.988
and this conditioning has caused so much damage to human beings.

43:13.096 --> 43:19.988
For example, to accept Freud had become just a complete religion in the West.

43:20.096 --> 43:26.988
Freud became Christ at that level, though he was a Jew.

43:27.096 --> 43:31.988
And he dominated the Western culture so much

43:32.096 --> 43:36.988
that I just couldn’t understand the impact of this stupid man

43:37.096 --> 43:40.988
who would have been thrown in the sea if he had come to India.

43:41.096 --> 43:45.988
But the conditioning part is: "Everything is written is law,"

43:46.096 --> 43:49.988
and they accepted this man so much

43:50.096 --> 43:56.988
that the culture of the West became absolutely self-destructive throughout.

43:57.096 --> 44:02.988
No respect, no morality, nothing was lofty,

44:03.096 --> 44:07.988
all value systems shattered

44:08.096 --> 44:13.988
because they accepted this kind of nonsense because it was written.

44:14.096 --> 44:17.988
Even today I hear, “In such and such book, such is written;

44:18.096 --> 44:22.988
in that book such and such thing is written.” This is terrible condition.

44:23.096 --> 44:27.988
For example, it’s written in the Bible that Jews crucified Christ.

44:28.096 --> 44:33.988
Nonsense! Just use your brains. How can Jews crucify Christ?

44:34.096 --> 44:35.988
They were in the multitude.

44:36.096 --> 44:41.988
In any country have you heard that a person can be crucified

44:42.096 --> 44:43.988
with the general opinion of the people?

44:44.096 --> 44:47.988
It’s the government, the Roman government did that.

44:48.096 --> 44:51.988
But to put the blame on the Jews was a very good idea

44:52.096 --> 44:54.988
of a very cunning man called as Mr. Paul,

44:55.096 --> 44:59.988
and people accepted that because it suited them to hate the Jews.

45:00.096 --> 45:03.988
Then the Jews started creating people like Freud.

45:04.096 --> 45:07.988
So all such conditionings also have reactions,

45:08.096 --> 45:11.988
and these conditionings then build up, and once they build up,

45:12.096 --> 45:17.988
their reactions also build up and you have a country full of all kinds of chaos,

45:18.096 --> 45:22.988
fear, violence and destruction.

45:26.096 --> 45:31.988
The conditioning is more also with the idea of possession:

45:32.096 --> 45:33.988
“This is my land.

45:34.096 --> 45:38.988
This possession is mine. That is this, that.”

45:39.096 --> 45:41.988
Like this it goes up to a point where people

45:42.096 --> 45:46.988
who believed in the formless God also fight for the land.

45:47.096 --> 45:50.988
Why should they? They believe in the formless God,

45:51.096 --> 45:53.988
so why should they fight for the land?

45:54.096 --> 45:55.988
But they’ll go on fighting for the land,

45:56.096 --> 46:05.988
and this fighting for the land can go to any extent of very cruel things

46:06.096 --> 46:11.988
that whole country can work out.

46:12.096 --> 46:22.988
Conditionings are of every kind, if you see, are blinding your eyes.

46:23.096 --> 46:25.988
For example they believe in Koran.

46:26.096 --> 46:29.988
Simple thing is, Koran was never written by Mohammed Sahib.

46:30.096 --> 46:33.988
He never knew how to read and write.

46:35.096 --> 46:36.988
It’s a fact.

46:37.096 --> 46:39.988
For forty years it was not written.

46:40.096 --> 46:43.988
There was a fellow called Mua’wiya or something like that,

46:44.096 --> 46:47.988
who killed Hazrat Ali, his sons.

46:48.096 --> 46:53.988
He was the second Calipha; the first one died very early.

46:54.096 --> 46:58.988
Then he killed the third one also.

46:59.096 --> 47:03.988
Then he killed the fourth one, just to become himself the Calipha,

47:04.096 --> 47:08.988
and the liver of this fourth Calipha was eaten

47:09.096 --> 47:14.988
by the mother of this horrible fellow who hated women.

47:15.096 --> 47:19.988
So he puts it down in the Koran, all the things against women,

47:20.096 --> 47:22.988
and people accept it because it’s in the Koran.

47:23.096 --> 47:26.988
Somebody has made fun of Koran and written what's wrong,

47:27.096 --> 47:29.988
and it’s so stupidities, and all that.

47:30.096 --> 47:33.988
So I asked him, "What is the use of writing this book, what is the use?"

47:34.096 --> 47:36.988
He said he never thought of the use.

47:37.096 --> 47:41.988
“Then why did you write? It must have some use. It’s a useless book.”

47:42.096 --> 47:49.988
I said, "It is only useful that, by reading this, all the people who are not Muslims,

47:50.096 --> 48:00.988
will laugh at Islam, and those who are Muslims will say, 'Well, this is our book,

48:01.096 --> 48:05.988
whatever it says we believe in it, we are conditioned like that.'

48:06.096 --> 48:07.988
So you don’t solve the problem."

48:08.096 --> 48:09.988
So he said, “Then what should I do?”

48:10.096 --> 48:12.988
I said, "You write another book, saying

48:13.096 --> 48:16.988
This is all stupidity I've written of Koran,

48:17.096 --> 48:20.988
because I know it was not written by Mohammed Sahib.'

48:21.096 --> 48:24.988
Don’t write anything Mohammed Sahib, against Him.

48:25.096 --> 48:29.988
He is the One who is the incarnation of Dattatreya. It’s a fact.

48:30.096 --> 48:36.988
So you write that He never wrote it, so all these people have done all these things."

48:37.096 --> 48:41.988
This conditioning can be removed

48:42.096 --> 48:44.988
if you know what sort of life Christ led.

48:45.096 --> 48:46.988
Very important.

48:49.096 --> 48:52.988
First of all He was born in a manger.

48:53.096 --> 48:59.988
To be born in a manger means in a poor circumstance.

49:00.096 --> 49:03.988
That means He showed there’s no need to have money

49:04.096 --> 49:09.988
or there’s no need to have a huge, big properties

49:10.096 --> 49:14.988
or anything to be impressive on people.

49:15.096 --> 49:24.988
Those were the days where people respected the tapasvis, the ones who were doing tapasya.

49:25.096 --> 49:27.988
That was the time to do tapasya.

49:28.096 --> 49:32.988
So He came on this earth and lived like a tapasvi.

49:36.096 --> 49:44.988
On the contrary, the Christians are the most self-indulgent people you could think of.

49:45.096 --> 49:48.988
You go to any Christian nation, you will be amazed

49:49.096 --> 49:56.988
how they are just slaves of money and their watches.

49:57.096 --> 50:03.988
How they are living is very shocking to see they are following Christ.

50:04.096 --> 50:06.988
“Yes, we follow Christ.”

50:07.096 --> 50:09.988
Then follow means what?

50:10.096 --> 50:12.988
He’s there and you are standing backwards moving.

50:13.096 --> 50:15.988
Is that the following?

50:16.096 --> 50:21.988
If you see the Catholic Church, or even Protestants, you’ll be shocked.

50:22.096 --> 50:26.988
How are they following Christ? I can’t understand, until now I never understood,

50:27.096 --> 50:30.988
because Catholic is nothing but money-oriented.

50:31.096 --> 50:34.988
The only thing they have picked up from Christ that He went to a wedding

50:35.096 --> 50:43.988
and created wine out of water and distributed.

50:44.096 --> 50:51.988
Now this wine is just the juice of the grapes.

50:52.096 --> 50:55.988
It’s also called wine in the Hebrew language.

50:56.096 --> 50:59.988
Thank God I have read Bible in Hebrew translated directly.

51:00.096 --> 51:03.988
So it's called draksharas.

51:04.096 --> 51:10.988
Because instantly, you cannot create alcohol.

51:11.096 --> 51:17.988
It has to rot, rot, rot, and the more it rots, the more good it is, they say.

51:18.096 --> 51:22.988
They write it down, this is twenty-five years old, so is the price is much.

51:23.096 --> 51:26.988
But if it is three hundred year old the price is exorbitant.

51:27.096 --> 51:33.988
So it has to rot and smell like hell, then only it’s a good alcohol. It’s a fact.

51:34.096 --> 51:38.988
How could Christ create that instant, that moment, alcohol?

51:39.096 --> 51:42.988
But now what I find is this, that if somebody dies

51:43.096 --> 51:45.988
they will take champagne to celebrate what?

51:46.096 --> 51:52.988
Good riddance of bad rubbish? Or when somebody is born they will do it.

51:53.096 --> 51:56.988
But on Christmas day especially, after coming from church,

51:57.096 --> 52:01.988
don’t go to any Christian’s house.

52:02.096 --> 52:05.988
Even the Indian Christians have started following the Western people,

52:06.096 --> 52:09.988
because Indian Christians believe that Christ was born in England.

52:13.096 --> 52:16.988
All such ideas have come from where?

52:17.096 --> 52:23.988
Is because the English and the Portuguese and the French brought Christianity to us.

52:24.096 --> 52:27.988
Now, by any chance, are they Christians?

52:28.096 --> 52:32.988
What business they had to bring Christianity to this place?

52:35.096 --> 52:38.988
They took Christianity to all the places, specially Spanish.

52:39.096 --> 52:43.988
Spanish, Portuguese went round the whole world

52:44.096 --> 52:46.988
to spread Christianity and today is the mess

52:47.096 --> 52:52.988
that you see in those people. They are nothing but drunkards.

52:53.096 --> 53:01.988
Yesterday I was going back, and the sea was full of happiness and joy,

53:02.096 --> 53:06.988
and the water had reached a very high level. It happens with Me.

53:07.096 --> 53:10.988
But what I found, there were four, five Christians coming, singing carols,

53:11.096 --> 53:20.988
and just completely drunk, and I was thinking they’ll be drowned in this water very soon.

53:21.096 --> 53:25.988
This was the great boon of Christianity on human beings,

53:26.096 --> 53:29.988
that you can drink as much as you like.

53:33.096 --> 53:37.988
Now this drinking has come, I should say, from where? God alone knows,

53:38.096 --> 53:42.988
but it has come also from the Christians.

53:43.096 --> 53:45.988
And the Muslims also drink, no doubt,

53:46.096 --> 53:48.988
but they hide and drink.

53:49.096 --> 53:53.988
They don’t openly drink and don’t call it's a religious duty that you should drink.

53:54.096 --> 53:56.988
Imagine in the church when they give communication,

53:57.096 --> 54:01.988
they give you some sort of a dirty smelling wine.

54:02.096 --> 54:04.988
After that, how can you have communication?

54:05.096 --> 54:08.988
Once you are drunk you are finished.

54:09.096 --> 54:11.988
But all these things happen.

54:12.096 --> 54:14.988
So today we are talking about Christ.

54:15.096 --> 54:22.988
He is sitting in a position of Agnya Chakra,

54:23.096 --> 54:27.988
controlling pineal and pituitary.

54:28.096 --> 54:32.988
By that He controls our conditioning.

54:33.096 --> 54:39.988
If we follow Him then we cannot be conditioned by anything,

54:40.096 --> 54:42.988
because He talked of Spirit only.

54:43.096 --> 54:49.988
Spirit cannot be conditioned - conditioned by anything.

54:50.096 --> 54:56.988
Whatever is good that will be accepted, good, congenial to the Spirit.

55:01.096 --> 55:05.988
It’s a different attitude of a person who is spiritual.

55:06.096 --> 55:10.988
Like we had people here,

55:11.096 --> 55:15.988
I know they are not very comfortable.

55:16.096 --> 55:19.988
Some of them are put into these tents here and there,

55:20.096 --> 55:29.988
but they are enjoying because they are enjoying the spiritual atmosphere.

55:30.096 --> 55:34.988
They don’t care where they sleep, where they live, what they have.

55:35.096 --> 55:39.988
This is all because you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

55:40.096 --> 55:42.988
But those who have not, so much worried,

55:43.096 --> 55:49.988
“This is not good, I want this way, that way.” All material happiness they seek,

55:50.096 --> 55:54.988
trouble everybody, criticize everybody, get angry with everybody.

55:55.096 --> 55:59.988
But actually they haven’t got spiritual joy,

56:00.096 --> 56:07.988
and they can never be really in joy unless and until they become fully spiritual.

56:08.096 --> 56:13.988
Christ has openly said that “You have to know yourself.”

56:14.096 --> 56:16.988
Same in Koran, Mohammed Sahib has said,

56:17.096 --> 56:20.988
“Unless and until you know yourself, you will not know God.”

56:21.096 --> 56:27.988
There are lots of truths in Koran, I find, left over by this Mua’wiya

56:28.096 --> 56:30.988
and also in the Bible.

56:31.096 --> 56:36.988
Also in the Jews, I find their Torah and all that has lots of truth,

56:37.096 --> 56:40.988
but is covered by all this kind of thinking,

56:41.096 --> 56:46.988
rationality and adjustments they have done for their own use.

56:50.096 --> 56:56.988
Actually we have to understand that Christ never started any exclusive religion, never.

56:57.096 --> 57:03.988
None of them. Specially Mohammed Sahib has talked about Abraham;

57:04.096 --> 57:10.988
He’s talked about Moses; He’s talked about Christ and His Mother, much more than in the Bible,

57:11.096 --> 57:12.988
respected Her.

57:13.096 --> 57:19.988
And He said, “There have been more than one lakh walis (means realized souls) before.”

57:20.096 --> 57:26.988
But still Muslims are some sort of a unique people

57:27.096 --> 57:30.988
because they call themselves Muslims. Whether they drink, doesn’t matter;

57:31.096 --> 57:33.988
whether they womanize, doesn’t matter;

57:34.096 --> 57:35.988
they kill people, doesn’t matter.

57:36.096 --> 57:39.988
They are running after few things which are forbidden to them,

57:40.096 --> 57:41.988
but still they are Muslims.

57:42.096 --> 57:43.988
Same with the Christians.

57:44.096 --> 57:54.988
Difficult to find a man who is a real Christian, who follows Christ, before realization.

57:55.096 --> 57:57.988
After realization, of course, we are different,

57:58.096 --> 58:00.988
but for that you have to cross this Agnya.

58:01.096 --> 58:08.988
Agnya also is there which has to control your ego.

58:09.096 --> 58:13.988
Christ in His lifetime showed how ego works.

58:14.096 --> 58:21.988
His own crucifixion itself shows how Christ,

58:22.096 --> 58:26.988
such a great incarnation of purity, was crucified;

58:27.096 --> 58:31.988
shows what people are like,

58:32.096 --> 58:37.988
what they did to Him, how He was troubled

58:38.096 --> 58:40.988
and tortured by these stupid people

58:41.096 --> 58:45.988
and then how He was crucified by the government.

58:48.096 --> 58:52.988
In the beginning there were many Sahaja Yogis, I should say, they were called as Gnostics.

58:53.096 --> 59:00.988
"Gna” in Sanskrit means knowledge, who had the knowledge about self.

59:01.096 --> 59:06.988
Christ has said, “Thou shalt.” He has said that “Know thyself.”

59:07.096 --> 59:10.988
"You have to knock at the door,” meaning

59:11.096 --> 59:13.988
you must have Shuddha Iccha, otherwise it won’t work out.

59:14.096 --> 59:19.988
Nobody can force you. He controls the ego.

59:22.096 --> 59:26.988
He’s the One who gives you the balance,

59:27.096 --> 59:30.988
but if you go to the West you know they are nothing

59:31.096 --> 59:35.988
but some sort of a stupid donkey-like ego.

59:38.096 --> 59:45.988
The way they talk, the way they behave towards each other, it’s a big eye opener.

59:46.096 --> 59:49.988
They are developed. How are they developed? God knows.

59:50.096 --> 59:54.988
Oh, they are very advanced, sophisticated, this, that.

59:57.096 --> 01:00:03.988
With this Agnya catching. Christ has said in His Lord’s Prayer:

01:00:04.096 --> 01:00:12.988
“Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us.”

01:00:13.096 --> 01:00:17.988
What a big thing to say, but one thing I have seen in the West,

01:00:18.096 --> 01:00:19.988
people don’t know how to forgive.

01:00:20.096 --> 01:00:23.988
They are full of hatred

01:00:26.096 --> 01:00:33.988
and they cannot ask forgiveness because they are full of terrible ego.

01:00:34.096 --> 01:00:38.988
Though they will feel guilty, but they will never ask for forgiveness.

01:00:39.096 --> 01:00:44.988
They’ll never say that “Oh God, forgive me for what I have done. ”

01:00:45.096 --> 01:00:47.988
This is so common now.

01:00:48.096 --> 01:00:51.988
For example the Nazis, they killed so many people

01:00:52.096 --> 01:00:57.988
and still you find these Neo-Nazis coming up, even in Italy.

01:01:02.096 --> 01:01:05.988
They are not ashamed as to what they have done.

01:01:06.096 --> 01:01:12.988
This happens because there is no really connection with Christ.

01:01:13.096 --> 01:01:16.988
Firstly, if you have connection with Christ,

01:01:17.096 --> 01:01:21.988
your ego has to be finished, absolutely.

01:01:22.096 --> 01:01:28.988
And this ego which comes to you from various sources is a myth. Is a myth.

01:01:32.096 --> 01:01:37.988
With this ego people try to befool others and show off.

01:01:38.096 --> 01:01:42.988
Like there’s a story of Shahpesh- I don’t know if you have read about him.

01:01:43.096 --> 01:01:46.988
He came to a king and told him that “I’m a great architect,

01:01:47.096 --> 01:01:49.988
and I’ll build a big palace for you, ”and this and that.

01:01:50.096 --> 01:01:52.988
The way he posed, the king believed him.

01:01:53.096 --> 01:01:56.988
He said, “All right. Go ahead, I’ll send you so much money. ”

01:01:57.096 --> 01:02:03.988
Now with this whole attitude and the way he was describing himself,

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:07.988
with his all his gestures full of such ego

01:02:08.096 --> 01:02:14.988
that this king also got completely lost. He gave him lots of money.

01:02:15.096 --> 01:02:20.988
And in six months' time he came back, said, “I’ve built your palace, come and have a look.”

01:02:21.096 --> 01:02:26.988
So he went there, he saw it was just the same land, there was no palace, nothing.

01:02:27.096 --> 01:02:29.988
So the king thought something gone wrong with him or what?

01:02:30.096 --> 01:02:35.988
He was again looking and looking, and what does he find? He finds there was no palace, nothing.

01:02:36.096 --> 01:02:40.988
Immediately he realized that his ego has befooled him.

01:02:41.096 --> 01:02:46.988
So the king was very clever that way, he realized it.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:52.988
So he started saying, “See this is the main road by which we’ll go, and there’s the palace.

01:02:53.096 --> 01:02:55.988
Now the door opens. ”Nothing there.

01:02:56.096 --> 01:02:59.988
It's all just a story. “And now here is your throne,

01:03:00.096 --> 01:03:01.988
and please be seated on it.”

01:03:02.096 --> 01:03:04.988
He said, “First you sit.”

01:03:05.096 --> 01:03:14.988
He made this Shahpesh to sit on a throne which never existed. Now imagine, it was very painful.

01:03:15.096 --> 01:03:19.988
He said, “You see, I want to see you sitting there, I like it.”

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.988
For one hour he made him sit.

01:03:22.096 --> 01:03:27.988
For two hours he made him sit. Ultimately Shahpesh fell at his feet and he said,

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:34.988
“Sir, I’m sorry, there is no palace, there is no throne, nothing of the kind,”

01:03:35.096 --> 01:03:38.988
but the king had lost all his money so he imprisoned him,

01:03:39.096 --> 01:03:41.988
he was beaten up and did all kinds of things.

01:03:42.096 --> 01:03:47.988
So this is the end of false ideas about oneself.

01:03:48.096 --> 01:03:54.988
This ego can take you to such a heights of stupidity.

01:03:58.096 --> 01:04:04.988
And the culture where it is pampered is the worst culture.

01:04:05.096 --> 01:04:07.988
I’ve seen advertisements where they say,

01:04:08.096 --> 01:04:14.988
"You must smoke this particular cigarette because it expresses your ego."

01:04:17.096 --> 01:04:28.988
But according to Indian culture, to express your ego is absolutely something very stupid.

01:04:29.096 --> 01:04:34.988
People laugh at such a person, the one who tries to show his ego.

01:04:35.096 --> 01:04:39.988
In Marathi language, if somebody is trying to show off,

01:04:40.096 --> 01:04:45.988
then they say he is climbing on a small, little shrub of channa.

01:04:48.096 --> 01:04:54.988
It’s the whole system is such so nobody can develop any ego.

01:04:55.096 --> 01:04:58.988
If they develop, then they are corrected.

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:03.988
Specially in Maharashtra, it’s very difficult to develop any ego.

01:05:04.096 --> 01:05:09.988
As soon as you start talking big about yourself, immediately you are punctured.

01:05:12.096 --> 01:05:23.988
But in the north, of course, a little bit allowed I think, and people do talk big.

01:05:24.096 --> 01:05:26.988
We have great politicians who talk very big,

01:05:27.096 --> 01:05:32.988
“I’m going to do this; I’m going to do that. We’re going to have this project, that project, this, that.”

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:36.988
One thing: Christ never said such a thing, never He talked.

01:05:37.096 --> 01:05:46.988
What, if you see His sermons, is so deep and so enlightening.

01:05:47.096 --> 01:05:50.988
Despite the effort of this gentleman Mister Paul,

01:05:51.096 --> 01:05:54.988
you see Christ talking to people,

01:05:55.096 --> 01:06:03.988
giving them different ways of explanation: what happens after realization,

01:06:04.096 --> 01:06:07.988
how a seed is sprouted, and how it can get spoilt.

01:06:08.096 --> 01:06:12.988
And very beautifully He explained to people.

01:06:13.096 --> 01:06:16.988
I think it didn't have much effect at that time.

01:06:17.096 --> 01:06:37.988
0

01:06:38.096 --> 01:06:41.988
His life was so charming and so beautiful.

01:06:44.096 --> 01:06:49.988
Like a shooting star, He came on this earth,

01:06:50.096 --> 01:06:58.988
but He left such a remarkable impression on people.

01:06:59.096 --> 01:07:01.988
His crucifixion was a part of the game

01:07:02.096 --> 01:07:07.988
because He had to make the way in the Agnya Chakra,

01:07:08.096 --> 01:07:11.988
to cross the Agnya Chakra He was crucified;

01:07:12.096 --> 01:07:16.988
but His message is not crucifixion.

01:07:17.096 --> 01:07:20.988
People wear the cross and I feel very hurt about it.

01:07:21.096 --> 01:07:25.988
He crucified Himself, but that’s not the message,

01:07:26.096 --> 01:07:33.988
that’s not you should celebrate that He crucified. There are people who celebrate it.

01:07:34.096 --> 01:07:37.988
You have to celebrate His resurrection,

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:44.988
resurrection because human beings are to be resurrected.

01:07:45.096 --> 01:07:47.988
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified

01:07:48.096 --> 01:07:52.988
and is resurrected because of one crucifixion of Christ.

01:07:53.096 --> 01:07:56.988
That was enough. That was sufficient.

01:07:57.096 --> 01:08:01.988
You can’t carry the cross on your shoulder; don’t have to.

01:08:02.096 --> 01:08:04.988
He has carried for you, He’s done everything for you.

01:08:05.096 --> 01:08:08.988
He said also that He died for all the sinners, is a fact. If

01:08:09.096 --> 01:08:14.988
He had not done that, it would have been difficult to open your Agnyas,

01:08:15.096 --> 01:08:18.988
because two problems, I told you, this conditioning and ego.

01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:24.988
His crucifixion has helped

01:08:25.096 --> 01:08:33.988
the loosening of these two horrible capacities of human being.

01:08:37.096 --> 01:08:48.988
His life is to be understood in a very, very deep sense.

01:08:51.096 --> 01:08:53.988
But if you are like a journalist, you can say,

01:08:54.096 --> 01:09:01.988
“Why did He crucify Himself? If He was God why did He get crucified?”

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.988
Now the question is why He got crucified,

01:09:06.096 --> 01:09:10.988
is how to tell these journalists who don’t know anything about chakras.

01:09:11.096 --> 01:09:19.988
Because it was the era or the time of tapasya, of sacrifice, and so

01:09:20.096 --> 01:09:31.988
then all these three persons - Buddha, Mahavira and Christ - went into complete renunciation.

01:09:35.096 --> 01:09:40.988
They led a life of a great tapasvis.

01:09:41.096 --> 01:09:46.988
They did it for us, not for themselves. They didn’t need it.

01:09:47.096 --> 01:09:53.988
They didn’t want it; but they had do it to cleanse us,

01:09:54.096 --> 01:10:04.988
to give us a proper Medha as they call it this Ekadesha Rudras,

01:10:05.096 --> 01:10:07.988
you see, to be cleared out;

01:10:08.096 --> 01:10:14.988
and they have sacrificed their lives, they have sacrificed all the pleasures of life.

01:10:15.096 --> 01:10:20.988
For them it was not a sacrifice, it is just a kind of a life they wanted to have.

01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:28.988
For such people there’s no question of sacrifice, but is a question of doing something

01:10:29.096 --> 01:10:35.988
that would help to open the chakras of the people in the future.

01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:38.988
Without them we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

01:10:39.096 --> 01:10:48.988
It was essential for these people to cleanse for us these three chakras,

01:10:49.096 --> 01:10:53.988
part of the one Chakra of Christ.

01:10:56.096 --> 01:11:06.988
All this they have worked out, and that's why today Sahaja Yoga is so beautifully created,

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:13.988
so beautifully spreading, is working out. We have to thank them very much.

01:11:14.096 --> 01:11:16.988
Of course all other incarnations also have helped,

01:11:17.096 --> 01:11:22.988
you can see, Vishuddhi, then also heart, and all these - right heart, left heart -

01:11:23.096 --> 01:11:27.988
all these angels as they are called in the Bible,

01:11:28.096 --> 01:11:30.988
have helped us to cross over.

01:11:31.096 --> 01:11:35.988
All these incarnations are responsible in our evolutionary process

01:11:36.096 --> 01:11:39.988
to create these ladders for us to move.

01:11:42.096 --> 01:11:49.988
So, ultimately you reach the state of Tapah

01:11:50.096 --> 01:11:56.988
on the sixth center and then in the state of truth, Satya.

01:11:57.096 --> 01:12:02.988
Then the truth comes to you through Sahaja Yoga, in the brain,

01:12:03.096 --> 01:12:07.988
in the limbic area when the Kundalini enters, She puts light there,

01:12:08.096 --> 01:12:12.988
She creates enlightened personalities

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:18.988
and then She joins this all-pervading power of divine love,

01:12:19.096 --> 01:12:27.988
and with this divine love you are completely changed and transformed.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:38.988
So their contribution to the ascent of human beings has been great,

01:12:39.096 --> 01:12:41.988
and that of Christ has been the greatest.

01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:47.988
And when we say we have to follow Christ,

01:12:48.096 --> 01:12:53.988
we should try to see how much detachment we have.

01:12:56.096 --> 01:13:00.988
They say His brothers and sisters, or somebody came to see Him.

01:13:01.096 --> 01:13:05.988
They say He had brothers. So He said, “Who are My brothers?

01:13:06.096 --> 01:13:09.988
These are My brothers, these are My relations.”

01:13:10.096 --> 01:13:15.988
Gyaneshwara said the same thing, that "They will become your relations

01:13:16.096 --> 01:13:21.988
[Marathi, sounds like SO ERIKO, TE CHEEZ SO ERIKO TE]. They will be your relations,

01:13:22.096 --> 01:13:27.988
they'll be your brothers and sisters, and not those who are not enlightened.

01:13:28.096 --> 01:13:30.988
They are not your relations because they don’t understand you.

01:13:31.096 --> 01:13:38.988
They don’t have entry into the Kingdom of God,

01:13:39.096 --> 01:13:51.988
so they are not your relations." In His lifetime, He led a life of a person who was very simple.

01:13:52.096 --> 01:13:54.988
Didn’t bother about clothes or anything.

01:13:55.096 --> 01:13:58.988
All the conditioning of the worldly things were not His,

01:13:59.096 --> 01:14:05.988
but He was not shameless type of a person who would accept any kind of a nudity and this and that.

01:14:06.096 --> 01:14:11.988
Even about Mahavira there’s a big misconcept.

01:14:12.096 --> 01:14:20.988
He was once praying in a garden where there were lots of bushes, we call them kunjas,

01:14:21.096 --> 01:14:27.988
and in the bush His cloth, which was only one cloth He was putting on, was caught up.

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:30.988
So He cut half of it and was covering Himself.

01:14:31.096 --> 01:14:38.988
Shri Krishna went to test Him, and He said that “I have nothing, I am just nude,

01:14:39.096 --> 01:14:45.988
so why don’t you give Me your cloth? Because, after all, You are a king.”

01:14:46.096 --> 01:14:55.988
So He took out his cloth and gave it to Shri Krishna, and got some leaves to cover Himself

01:14:56.096 --> 01:14:59.988
and He was in His own garden, and went into His own palace.

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:07.988
Now, if you see the Jains, they make everything so horrible and insult Him all the time.

01:15:08.096 --> 01:15:15.988
Most of the people who follow all these great incarnations really all the time insult them.

01:15:18.096 --> 01:15:22.988
They don’t follow, they insult, and by their behavior, you see,

01:15:23.096 --> 01:15:27.988
we form such a bad opinion of all these people.

01:15:29.096 --> 01:15:32.988
I met one gentleman in Chicago. It was very cold.

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:36.988
He was the head of the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

01:15:37.096 --> 01:15:42.988
He was wearing a dhoti which was so thin, and he was shaking before Me.

01:15:43.096 --> 01:15:46.988
I said, “What’s the matter?”

01:15:47.096 --> 01:15:48.988
He said, “I’m feeling very cold.”

01:15:49.096 --> 01:15:50.988
I said, “Why are you wearing this dhoti?”

01:15:51.096 --> 01:15:55.988
He said, “My guru has told me if you wear a dhoti you will go to heaven.”

01:15:56.096 --> 01:16:01.988
I said, “Really? In India eighty percent people wear nothing but dhotis,

01:16:02.096 --> 01:16:04.988
are they all going to go to heaven? And many must have gone already,

01:16:05.096 --> 01:16:08.988
so where will you be?” Didn’t like it.

01:16:09.096 --> 01:16:14.988
Then I said, "Why you shaved your hair and put this …”we call it shindi, or in Hindi, bhodi.

01:16:15.096 --> 01:16:19.988
I don’t know what you call - pig’s tail here, pig’s tail?

01:16:20.096 --> 01:16:22.988
So he says, “It is because my guru told me

01:16:23.096 --> 01:16:28.988
that I must shave my head and have this kind of a thing.” So I think perhaps,

01:16:29.096 --> 01:16:34.988
maybe he will be tied to some rope and pulled in the heaven or something,

01:16:37.096 --> 01:16:48.988
I said. Kabira has said - Kabira was one of them who has tried to slash out all your conditioning.

01:16:49.096 --> 01:16:53.988
He said, “By shaving your head, if you are going to go to heaven,

01:16:57.096 --> 01:17:05.988
so what about the lamb which is shaved twice a year?

01:17:06.096 --> 01:17:09.988
He’ll be there earlier than you.”

01:17:10.096 --> 01:17:11.988
It’s a fact, it's so, such stupid things.

01:17:12.096 --> 01:17:17.988
And there are Jain sadhus who will remain absolutely nude and will pull their hair.

01:17:18.096 --> 01:17:25.988
Now by law they are allowed to go nude on the street, you know, insulting everyone.

01:17:26.096 --> 01:17:30.988
All such stupid things are happening in the name of religion -

01:17:31.096 --> 01:17:34.988
that, too, of Buddha, Mahavira, and Christ.

01:17:37.096 --> 01:17:44.988
They are the Ones who are trying to pull us away from rationality,

01:17:45.096 --> 01:17:47.988
because you have to cross this.

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:57.988
All your limitations are because of this thinking, conditioning.

01:17:58.096 --> 01:18:04.988
We have to go beyond because by thinking, what do we do?

01:18:05.096 --> 01:18:09.988
We move in a linear way and then there’s no truth in it,

01:18:10.096 --> 01:18:15.988
so the whole thing comes back, boomerangs, and you are finished.

01:18:16.096 --> 01:18:20.988
We have to go beyond this mind; must understand this point is.

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:26.988
Christ has done this so that we can go beyond our mind.

01:18:28.096 --> 01:18:30.988
If you don’t know how to go beyond mind,

01:18:31.096 --> 01:18:33.988
better sit down for your meditation, work it out.

01:18:34.096 --> 01:18:36.988
With this mind all kinds of things will come.

01:18:37.096 --> 01:18:43.988
Temper will come, intrigue will come, jealousies will come,

01:18:44.096 --> 01:18:54.988
all the six enemies that we have will come to us through this mind –

01:18:55.096 --> 01:19:00.988
means thinking, rationality. Everything can be rationalized.

01:19:01.096 --> 01:19:04.988
“Why did you murder your wife?”

01:19:05.096 --> 01:19:07.988
"Because I hated her. She was this, she was that, she was that.”

01:19:08.096 --> 01:19:10.988
But you cannot murder her.

01:19:11.096 --> 01:19:14.988
“Why did you murder your husband?” “Because of this, because of that.”

01:19:15.096 --> 01:19:22.988
Because of this mind we start doing things which are absolutely wrong, which are sinful,

01:19:23.096 --> 01:19:25.988
and then we try to rationalize it.

01:19:26.096 --> 01:19:31.988
Go against Agnya, go against reality,

01:19:32.096 --> 01:19:37.988
and then use your conditioning, use your, we can call,

01:19:38.096 --> 01:19:46.988
the ego to explain it, why you did it.

01:19:47.096 --> 01:19:51.988
All the time when we are doing like that we can never go beyond mind.

01:19:52.096 --> 01:19:57.988
We are so self-satisfied about ourselves. We think no end of ourselves.

01:19:58.096 --> 01:20:06.988
Now, how are we to get out of it?

01:20:07.096 --> 01:20:09.988
Introspection.

01:20:10.096 --> 01:20:13.988
But it’s very difficult because people are afraid of themselves.

01:20:14.096 --> 01:20:18.988
They don’t want to introspect, because once they start introspecting they

01:20:19.096 --> 01:20:25.988
will know how sinful they have been, how wrong things they have been doing.

01:20:26.096 --> 01:20:31.988
And then they’ll hate themselves. So they don’t want to introspect.

01:20:32.096 --> 01:20:38.988
But it’s very important that we should introspect.

01:20:39.096 --> 01:20:50.988
That introspection is very helpful for you to overcome these two hurdles of your Agnya Chakra.

01:20:53.096 --> 01:20:57.988
I’ve told you many a times: don’t argue with anybody

01:20:58.096 --> 01:21:02.988
because the other fellow, he is asking for argument is the one has lots of ego,

01:21:03.096 --> 01:21:07.988
and that ego is acting on you.

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:16.988
So action/reaction starts, and we develop a habit of reacting to everything.

01:21:17.096 --> 01:21:21.988
Specially in the West, I have seen they react to everything, everything.

01:21:22.096 --> 01:21:25.988
For example, now, this thing is spread out here, now they have nothing to do.

01:21:26.096 --> 01:21:29.988
“But they could have had better, why is it so thin?”

01:21:30.096 --> 01:21:33.988
Well you pay for it now, you do it.

01:21:34.096 --> 01:21:36.988
They are walking across, they meet someone. "See, see this man.

01:21:37.096 --> 01:21:40.988
What sort of a person he is?”

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:44.988
If there’s a beggar, then they’ll start criticizing.

01:21:45.096 --> 01:21:48.988
They'll criticize the government; they’ll criticize everyone.

01:21:49.096 --> 01:21:50.988
What about yourself?

01:21:51.096 --> 01:21:55.988
Instead of that why don’t you start doing something about it?

01:21:56.096 --> 01:22:01.988
If you can’t help it, if you are not going to do anything about it, why react?

01:22:02.096 --> 01:22:05.988
And this is the worst habit we have developed is to react,

01:22:06.096 --> 01:22:08.988
and we think we have every right to react.

01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:17.988
You have, but this right is self-destructive.

01:22:18.096 --> 01:22:22.988
To react on everything is not proper.

01:22:23.096 --> 01:22:27.988
You have no authority to react. It is to that extent.

01:22:28.096 --> 01:22:32.988
You have to just witness, witness the whole thing.

01:22:33.096 --> 01:22:35.988
Once you start witnessing,

01:22:36.096 --> 01:22:42.988
you’ll be amazed that you will start seeing the play, play of the maya,

01:22:43.096 --> 01:22:47.988
as they call it, and you will see where you stand with it.

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:52.988
Witnessing should be developed. All the time, witness.

01:22:53.096 --> 01:22:55.988
Am I witnessing?

01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:58.988
Many people say that I have very good memory

01:22:59.096 --> 01:23:03.988
because I am all the time witnessing.

01:23:04.096 --> 01:23:08.988
Everything is recorded within Me like a picture.

01:23:09.096 --> 01:23:13.988
And then, when I have to say something, I have to correct something,

01:23:14.096 --> 01:23:18.988
all that I have witnessed comes to help Me.

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:26.988
First of all, we should not react, react to anything.

01:23:27.096 --> 01:23:31.988
Some people are attached, say, to money.

01:23:32.096 --> 01:23:34.988
They’ll react, they’ll not give any money,

01:23:35.096 --> 01:23:37.988
they’ll keep all the money with themselves.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:41.988
In Sahaja Yoga also it happens.

01:23:42.096 --> 01:23:45.988
I’ve seen people who are very, very miserly about money.

01:23:46.096 --> 01:23:49.988
Another ones are who try to please others,

01:23:50.096 --> 01:23:53.988
then they’ll waste their money on lavish things for nothing at all.

01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:56.988
There’s no need to waste.

01:23:59.096 --> 01:24:07.988
Reaction can come through anything. Seeing something you can react

01:24:08.096 --> 01:24:12.988
and you become so engrossed with it that you don’t realize

01:24:13.096 --> 01:24:18.988
that you are wasting all your brain energy on nonsensical things.

01:24:19.096 --> 01:24:27.988
This reaction comes when you have lost complete sense of judgment.

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:35.988
You don’t know what you are losing, what you are gaining by this kind of reaction.

01:24:36.096 --> 01:24:44.988
And this reaction is going to destroy your inner being completely,

01:24:45.096 --> 01:24:48.988
because all the time you are here and you are there, and you’re there, and you are there,

01:24:49.096 --> 01:24:51.988
and you are nowhere here.

01:24:54.096 --> 01:25:00.988
If you are a very criticizing type of a person, try to stop it completely. Criticize yourself,

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:05.988
direct that energy towards yourself. "Who am I to criticize others?

01:25:06.096 --> 01:25:09.988
Who am I to react to anything?

01:25:10.096 --> 01:25:19.988
”Put a challenge to yourself, and you will see that your ego will subside.

01:25:24.096 --> 01:25:26.988
One day somebody came and told Me that

01:25:27.096 --> 01:25:31.988
“Mother I feel so angry, I feel like beating everyone.”

01:25:32.096 --> 01:25:37.988
I said, “All right, do one thing. Take a chappel and hit on your head. Finished.

01:25:38.096 --> 01:25:44.988
That’s the only way you can get rid of this habit that you want to beat others.”

01:25:45.096 --> 01:25:50.988
Didn’t like it much, but I think by that he is improved.

01:25:52.096 --> 01:26:00.988
Now, conditioning also should be seen. “Am I a conditioned person?

01:26:01.096 --> 01:26:05.988
If my conditioning is there, then is it a good conditioning or a bad conditioning?

01:26:06.096 --> 01:26:08.988
“At least you should have good conditioning.

01:26:09.096 --> 01:26:10.988
But even that, to an extreme if you go,

01:26:11.096 --> 01:26:15.988
you can create a problem for yourself and for others.

01:26:16.096 --> 01:26:21.988
Most of these rituals and things started as a good conditioning.

01:26:22.096 --> 01:26:31.988
Then it became like a trap, and they could not get out of it.

01:26:32.096 --> 01:26:36.988
It’s a part and parcel of it, one has to accept.

01:26:37.096 --> 01:26:39.988
Then what should we do?

01:26:40.096 --> 01:26:48.988
We should not react. Just see the drama and you’ll be surprised,

01:26:50.096 --> 01:26:56.988
without paying anything, without going to any theatre, every moment you can see the drama going on before you,

01:26:57.096 --> 01:27:03.988
which is so enjoyable, whether it is absurd, whether it is ridiculous,

01:27:04.096 --> 01:27:12.988
whether it is a sort of a - as you see in the films, you see, beating somebody and all that,

01:27:13.096 --> 01:27:19.988
you just see it and you do not react.

01:27:20.096 --> 01:27:27.988
Anything that you think is very perverse, ugly, immoral - don’t see, finished, gone.

01:27:30.096 --> 01:27:35.988
So don’t tax your mind, because in the mind that we call it, so-called mind,

01:27:36.096 --> 01:27:47.988
it's actually the Agnya Chakra in the center of your optic chiasma.

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:51.988
Just imagine. What a central place it has!

01:27:52.096 --> 01:27:56.988
And any disturbance to your Agnya, what it can do to your brain

01:27:57.096 --> 01:28:02.988
which is nothing but a lump of fat.

01:28:05.096 --> 01:28:07.988
So how this Agnya can affect you,

01:28:08.096 --> 01:28:15.988
and how it works and creates perverted images, that is to be really seen.

01:28:16.096 --> 01:28:24.988
Conditionings, also you have seen, people are mentally so upset and so degenerated.

01:28:27.096 --> 01:28:33.988
But the pure nature of Christ is innocence, you know that. He's Shri Ganesha.

01:28:34.096 --> 01:28:38.988
Shri Ganesha is an eternal Child.

01:28:39.096 --> 01:28:44.988
Christ is also complete innocence because He doesn’t react,

01:28:48.096 --> 01:28:52.988
because He is not conditioned.

01:28:53.096 --> 01:28:56.988
Children are not conditioned so much as we are.

01:28:59.096 --> 01:29:01.988
If you talk to children, if you speak to them,

01:29:02.096 --> 01:29:08.988
you’ll be amazed how innocent they are and how innocently they talk.

01:29:09.096 --> 01:29:16.988
Once My granddaughter asked Me, “What do You think of the poor children of the tiger?”

01:29:17.096 --> 01:29:18.988
I said, “Why?”

01:29:19.096 --> 01:29:27.988
“You know their father tells them that ‘You eat human beings,’ and what can they do?

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:32.988
They have to eat human beings after all.” You see, so innocent.

01:29:33.096 --> 01:29:37.988
So I told her that they are under a complete control of God.

01:29:38.096 --> 01:29:42.988
Whatever they are doing, they are not going to be held responsible.

01:29:43.096 --> 01:29:45.988
It’s only for human beings

01:29:55.096 --> 01:29:58.988
that God has given this freedom.

01:29:59.096 --> 01:30:05.988
It’s only human beings who can react in this manner.

01:30:06.096 --> 01:30:09.988
So for animals it is, they are pashus,

01:30:10.096 --> 01:30:15.988
means they are completely under the control of the God Almighty.

01:30:16.096 --> 01:30:20.988
So they are swabhavas, everything, a serpent will be a serpent,

01:30:21.096 --> 01:30:26.988
and a tiger will be a tiger, and they will say a lion will be a lion.

01:30:27.096 --> 01:30:31.988
But human being can be a serpent, at the same time could be a scorpion,

01:30:32.096 --> 01:30:34.988
could be a lion, could be anything,

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:41.988
you know suddenly you find a small little bug-like man coming up like a lion roaring at you,

01:30:42.096 --> 01:30:46.988
and you say, “From where does this come, this cannon?”

01:30:47.096 --> 01:30:50.988
It is so. You don’t know which way they will come,

01:30:51.096 --> 01:30:56.988
and which way the camel will sit. You can’t say.

01:30:57.096 --> 01:31:04.988
So this reaction of human beings comes

01:31:05.096 --> 01:31:09.988
because he is not in connection with the Divine.

01:31:10.096 --> 01:31:14.988
When he is in the connection with the Divine,

01:31:15.096 --> 01:31:19.988
he sees the drama, and he leaves everything to Divine.

01:31:20.096 --> 01:31:22.988
He can solve all his problem by just one bandhan.

01:31:27.096 --> 01:31:33.988
He can solve all the problems just by a bandhan.

01:31:34.096 --> 01:31:39.988
But he should be in full connection with the Divine.

01:31:40.096 --> 01:31:47.988
It works, it works. It does work. This is not the time when Christ came on this earth.

01:31:48.096 --> 01:31:58.988
This is the time where this Paramchaitanya has gone into action – activated,

01:31:59.096 --> 01:32:00.988
is working out everything.

01:32:01.096 --> 01:32:07.988
Now they asked Me about this Shri Ganesha, whether Shri Ganesha drank milk or not.

01:32:08.096 --> 01:32:09.988
I said, “Anything possible.”

01:32:10.096 --> 01:32:14.988
These days this Paramachaitanya is doing such things, unbelievable things,

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:21.988
which we cannot understand, everything is a chamatkar. So it’s possible.

01:32:23.096 --> 01:32:27.988
Ganeshas, I’ve never heard of Ganesha liking milk so much,

01:32:28.096 --> 01:32:33.988
but maybe for the little rat He might be taking. Can’t say.

01:32:34.096 --> 01:32:35.988
“But why did Shiva drink?”

01:32:36.096 --> 01:32:39.988
I said, “Let it be, let Shiva wants to drink, let Him have milk.”

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:42.988
Actually we have too much milk production,

01:32:43.096 --> 01:32:44.988
so They must be wanting to consume some.

01:32:45.096 --> 01:32:49.988
But it’s just a way at looking at things that, you see,

01:32:50.096 --> 01:32:53.988
when everything is done by this Paramchaitanya.

01:32:54.096 --> 01:32:55.988
They are doing such wonderful things,

01:32:56.096 --> 01:32:58.988
I mean, I never asked Them to do anything.

01:32:59.096 --> 01:33:01.988
But now, for example, in Brisbane when I was there,

01:33:02.096 --> 01:33:08.988
I was sleeping in the ashram, and a rainbow appeared.

01:33:09.096 --> 01:33:11.988
Of course I like paintings very much, of Raphael specially,

01:33:12.096 --> 01:33:16.988
because he has drawn the Mother’s face,

01:33:17.096 --> 01:33:19.988
and the Child’s face so exactly,

01:33:20.096 --> 01:33:23.988
expressing the feeling of mother and the child.

01:33:24.096 --> 01:33:28.988
And imagine, that picture appears in the sky,

01:33:29.096 --> 01:33:31.988
and I didn’t tell them to show that Raphael.

01:33:32.096 --> 01:33:35.988
When I was sleeping I was not even going to look at it.

01:33:36.096 --> 01:33:42.988
But at this time, the halo that was on the back side of Mary comes upon the head.

01:33:43.096 --> 01:33:48.988
Means Raphael himself did it, or, I don’t know. How can I explain?

01:33:49.096 --> 01:33:52.988
This Paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of things,

01:33:53.096 --> 01:33:58.988
and it does all this just to convince you about Sahaja Yoga.

01:34:01.096 --> 01:34:05.988
Because even now there are many who are supposed to be very rational, intelligent,

01:34:06.096 --> 01:34:11.988
educated, who don’t want to accept.

01:34:12.096 --> 01:34:16.988
After all, if there is a divine power, if there is something like  that and is active,

01:34:17.096 --> 01:34:19.988
how can you challenge it?

01:34:20.096 --> 01:34:21.988
How can you say no to it?

01:34:24.096 --> 01:34:34.988
Because the powers are unlimited, it has gone into every atom and every molecule.

01:34:38.096 --> 01:34:42.988
It doesn’t do tricks, like moving this from there to there,

01:34:43.096 --> 01:34:50.988
but what it does is to do something which is absolutely impossible.

01:34:51.096 --> 01:34:53.988
It is doing.

01:34:55.096 --> 01:35:04.988
So for us to believe in this activated Paramchaitanya

01:35:05.096 --> 01:35:06.988
is the only solution.

01:35:07.096 --> 01:35:09.988
So you leave it in the ocean of bliss,

01:35:10.096 --> 01:35:13.988
and let this great power handle all these situations.

01:35:14.096 --> 01:35:17.988
Don’t react yourself.

01:35:18.096 --> 01:35:23.988
Which is so efficient, so quick, so fast, moves all over, understands everything,

01:35:24.096 --> 01:35:28.988
and it loves you and respects you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

01:35:33.096 --> 01:35:39.988
This is what it is today: we should know at the time when we are celebrating Christmas

01:35:40.096 --> 01:35:48.988
that what we are celebrating is really our own ascent, our own achievements,

01:35:49.096 --> 01:35:56.988
our own lofty heights which we have achieved and which we have to achieve.

01:35:57.096 --> 01:36:01.988
We should have only aspirations as far as our spiritual side is concerned.

01:36:02.096 --> 01:36:06.988
All aspirations should be left to this Paramchaitanya,

01:36:07.096 --> 01:36:08.988
“You look after that.”

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:10.988
And the more you become,

01:36:11.096 --> 01:36:22.988
the more you develop this non-reacting attitude through your proper Agnya.

01:36:23.096 --> 01:36:30.988
Not anger, not silence, but a very pleasant temperament.

01:36:31.096 --> 01:36:34.988
That means people think that I have told you not to speak. No, no, you must speak.

01:36:35.096 --> 01:36:38.988
You must talk to people, you must laugh, you must enjoy;

01:36:39.096 --> 01:36:44.988
but all this should be full of joyous feelings.

01:36:45.096 --> 01:36:54.988
That’s what they say that Christmas is for a very joyous atmosphere.

01:36:55.096 --> 01:36:58.988
So they can’t do that way so they drink. I mean, after all,

01:36:59.096 --> 01:37:02.988
you must give them benefit of doubt also that why do they drink?

01:37:03.096 --> 01:37:07.988
They think by drinking they will become joyous.

01:37:10.096 --> 01:37:15.988
Now our understanding about ourselves has to be very clear-cut.

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:20.988
Specially, people don’t meditate.

01:37:21.096 --> 01:37:24.988
They just don’t meditate. They don’t want to grow.

01:37:25.096 --> 01:37:29.988
They are Sahaja Yogis but they don’t meditate. It’s very surprising,

01:37:30.096 --> 01:37:35.988
I can make out who meditates, who does not, because there is no depth.

01:37:36.096 --> 01:37:42.988
They want to have this, they want to have that, is all right, but what about meditation?

01:37:43.096 --> 01:37:49.988
If you don’t meditate, your Agnya will be completely covered with thoughts,

01:37:50.096 --> 01:37:55.988
and you’ll be lost. So you have to meditate.

01:37:56.096 --> 01:37:59.988
If you don’t meditate, I also suffer.

01:38:00.096 --> 01:38:04.988
If you have no aspirations in Sahaja Yoga it's better to leave,

01:38:05.096 --> 01:38:10.988
because you are like seeds which are sprouted and which will be wasted.

01:38:11.096 --> 01:38:18.988
Some people are here because they want some sort of a platform, some publicity.

01:38:19.096 --> 01:38:23.988
Some are here who want money, to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:38:24.096 --> 01:38:27.988
There are some who want to have a kind of a communication,

01:38:28.096 --> 01:38:32.988
to go round the whole world without paying a single pai.

01:38:33.096 --> 01:38:40.988
All such people are of no use to themselves.

01:38:41.096 --> 01:38:47.988
Now here you have the complete wealth.

01:38:49.096 --> 01:38:57.988
All that celestial wealth is before you, and you are not going to accept it,

01:38:58.096 --> 01:39:02.988
you are not going to drown into it. What should we say?

01:39:03.096 --> 01:39:04.988
It’s not very sensible to do.

01:39:05.096 --> 01:39:09.988
As I said, you don’t have to crucify yourself, you don’t have to give up anything,

01:39:10.096 --> 01:39:15.988
you don’t have to live like Christ had to live or be born in the manger.

01:39:16.096 --> 01:39:21.988
All that’s done for you already. Now come along.

01:39:22.096 --> 01:39:30.988
But if you are coming in the darbar of the Divine, then be worth it.

01:39:31.096 --> 01:39:31.988
You should be worth it.

01:39:32.096 --> 01:39:35.988
And you’ll be surprised, all your problems will be solved.

01:39:36.096 --> 01:39:43.988
Your self-respect will be maintained. So many things have happened like that,

01:39:44.096 --> 01:39:48.988
but if you have no self-respect, you don’t respect your Realization,

01:39:49.096 --> 01:39:55.988
you are not deeply involved as to your own ascent and the help to others,

01:39:56.096 --> 01:39:57.988
it will not work out.

01:39:58.096 --> 01:40:01.988
I’m here to tell you all these things which Christ could not tell.

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:07.988
I had to fulfil what  He wanted to say.

01:40:08.096 --> 01:40:12.988
All those things I am saying to you. It has already worked,

01:40:13.096 --> 01:40:14.988
you all have got Realization,

01:40:15.096 --> 01:40:18.988
but develop respect for yourself as Sahaja yogis.

01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:22.988
Don’t have funny ideas about yourself.

01:40:23.096 --> 01:40:26.988
Just know you are a Sahaja yogi and a Sahaja yogini.

01:40:27.096 --> 01:40:35.988
That’s what is needed for a person if he is today celebrating the birth of Christ.

01:40:36.096 --> 01:40:45.988
He came on this Earth who was actually Christ, full of innocence,

01:40:46.096 --> 01:40:55.988
who was the One who came as the embodiment of Shri Ganesha.

01:40:56.096 --> 01:41:02.988
I have given the proof of it to you, how the carbon atom looks like,

01:41:03.096 --> 01:41:08.988
and by which I have proved that Christ is the Alpha and Omega,

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:14.988
while He is made out of Omkara and Swastika.

01:41:15.096 --> 01:41:19.988
All this we have experimented. We have found it. It’s there.

01:41:20.096 --> 01:41:27.988
With all this, what is the greatest achievement is to respect your innocence.

01:41:28.096 --> 01:41:29.988
Respect your innocence.

01:41:30.096 --> 01:41:35.988
This is what is to be asked for today: be innocent,

01:41:36.096 --> 01:41:40.988
and God looks after all the innocent people.

01:41:41.096 --> 01:41:46.988
Don’t worry, don’t have to worry. I’ve seen children falling for seven storeys,

01:41:47.096 --> 01:41:48.988
nothing happens to them.

01:41:49.096 --> 01:41:53.988
They are perfectly all right. How? Who looks after them? Angels.

01:41:54.096 --> 01:41:57.988
You have seen photographs of angels around you.

01:41:58.096 --> 01:42:03.988
So try to be simple, innocent, not reactive,

01:42:04.096 --> 01:42:12.988
and keep quiet and peaceful because here we are talking about the global transformation

01:42:13.096 --> 01:42:15.988
where people will find their peace in their heart

01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:25.988
and will establish a new world of peace, joy and spirituality.

01:42:26.096 --> 01:42:28.988
May God bless you all!
