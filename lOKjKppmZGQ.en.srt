00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:10,960
GURU PUJA
Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,040
1st August, 1999

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:25,730
Since we have come to Cabella, it is the ten
years completed.

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:39,469
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,
we have been able to progress in Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:48,149
Now, today we are going to have a Guru Puja.

6
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:58,180
As I have said, you all are gurus and you
want to worship Me as your Guru.

7
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,239
It is all right.

8
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:18,500
But the main thing one should understand,
that you have become guru, no doubt, because

9
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,280
you have the knowledge, you have the absolute
knowledge.

10
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,720
And so we can say you have become gurus, no
doubt.

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:43,580
But one has to understand that you have reached
a state where you can raise the Kundalini,

12
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,290
you can give Realization to others.

13
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:53,730
Also you know what is the absolute knowledge.

14
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:09,179
To know the absolute knowledge is very important,
and to assimilate is even much more important.

15
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,300
Though we know the absolute knowledge, we
cannot assimilate it that well.

16
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,410
That means we cannot go deep into it.

17
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,500
What is the reason for that?

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:38,209
We have to realize that we have all come out
of the heritage that was the animal kingdom.

19
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,659
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

20
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:58,079
So there are so many things of the animal
heritage that linger in us: the aggressiveness,

21
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:12,010
the domination, peevishness, fear, grabbing.

22
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:21,874
All these are our inheritance, and they are
within us lingering.

23
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:29,299
We want to grab things of others’ - not
you people, of course not, but people who

24
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,349
are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

25
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:48,389
They first used to grab lands, then they started
grabbing people, making them slaves.

26
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:57,749
Then they were not satisfied with that, so
they were grabbing kingdoms, jewelry and all

27
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:00,540
these things.

28
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,620
So just to grab.

29
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,870
They have no legal right, still they would
grab.

30
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:22,780
It seems, it seems very funny, it seems very
inhuman, but it is there because of our inheritance.

31
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,440
Now there are so many other things, like jealousy.

32
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,530
Among animals there is very little of that,
they don't have jealousies so much as we have;

33
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:47,340
while we have inherited this jealousy by our
own reactions and thinking.

34
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:55,040
People get jealous and they want to put down
others.

35
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:04,060
If they cannot achieve any height, they want
to bring down the heights of others.

36
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:10,921
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings, they think whatever is done in the

37
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:14,260
name of jealousy is all right.

38
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:21,540
They become very conscious that “We are
lower than another person.

39
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:31,400
We lack in some talents than another person,”
and they try to overpower that person, because

40
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,460
of the force of jealousy behind them.

41
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:48,250
Now the trouble is, though we are human beings,
we have inherited so many animal qualities,

42
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:56,500
like we are ferocious, we are angry and we
get upset, as animals do.

43
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:06,920
But additional to that, human beings can react
because of their thinking.

44
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,420
They think.

45
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:19,000
They can think, and by thinking, all these
inherited properties become perverted.

46
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,490
Like a person wants to put down another person.

47
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:32,520
Then he doesn’t behave like an animal, in
a straightforward way, but he will find out

48
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:40,530
a device, a method, he’ll think it over
how to do it.

49
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:54,810
The main problem with human beings is that
they still have inherited very violent temper.

50
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:01,550
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

51
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:08,120
When you see something which you don't like,
which is against your will, it may be something

52
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,630
like that, immediately you flare up.

53
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:21,629
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor, they
had put a sugar candy.

54
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:31,240
To sugar candy they were putting the matchbox,
you see, they were using a match into it,

55
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,240
matchstick.

56
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,610
It would not take the fire.

57
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,330
They tried and tried, it would not.

58
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,260
So I said, "Let Me see what is that."

59
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,280
So that was a sugar candy.

60
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,370
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

61
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,530
So the quality of the person is known in the
same way.

62
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:58,600
If with the slightest provocation, if he gets
into temper and gets annoyed, then his quality

63
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,770
is not very good as a guru.

64
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:15,610
As a guru we should not flare up, we should
not get angry, we should not try to oppress

65
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,610
others.

66
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,450
"But what can we do, then?"

67
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,720
people will ask.

68
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,940
We have another method, what we call is love.

69
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,990
Love.

70
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:41,340
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person, so what happens

71
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:50,860
that it doesn’t give you any anger, and
the another person, you don't make him angry

72
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
also.

73
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,910
Anger begets anger.

74
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:02,860
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort because he is afraid of you,

75
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,110
it may be that; but in his heart he will keep
a revenge in his mind that “One day I will

76
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,110
show him.

77
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,330
Why should he get angry with me?”

78
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:21,120
So in Sahaja Yoga, please remember that love
is the only way we can solve the problem.

79
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,990
Now if something goes wrong, say, in the ashram,
if you get angry with that person, what will

80
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,010
happen?

81
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,890
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

82
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,160
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he may realize
that it was a wrong thing to do.

83
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:47,680
But if he’s a bad Sahaja Yogi, not yet fully
equipped to understand, then what he will

84
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
do?

85
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:56,850
He will just feel that “This man has insulted
me.

86
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:06,760
He has deliberately put me down and all that,
and I should try to take a revenge.”

87
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:14,490
Among animals this activity is very limited.

88
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't think they believe in revenge, except
for a few animals.

89
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,740
They say that if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite, it will come back on you,

90
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,620
that's what is said.

91
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,760
And this one is something, one quality of
the snake.

92
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:47,310
But as we have passed through all these different
categories, we might be having some of the

93
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:54,920
qualities of some of these animals within
us, we may be even snakes anywhere.

94
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:02,650
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you, you’ll remember it all your life.

95
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:08,680
“He has hurt me, so I’ll put him right
one day, I’ll take a revenge!”

96
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,060
If there’s a snake within us.

97
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:18,920
But now if there's a tiger within you, so
you’ll become very ferocious, at the smallest

98
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,000
thing you'll get angry, lose temper.

99
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:36,660
Now, this is not a very good situation, that
we are still at the level of animals and our

100
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,330
inheritance is still working in us.

101
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,400
So we have to keep a watch.

102
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:53,610
We have to be good gurus, and for a good guru,
you have to have a very peaceful, compassionate,

103
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,630
loving temperament.

104
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:18,050
After all, one has to understand that people
have this inheritance, and some people have

105
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,649
more, or some people have this, or some people
have that.

106
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:32,560
For that, if you get angry with that person,
it’s not going to help him or help you.

107
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,580
But if you are loving and compassionate and
you explain that person what is the problem

108
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,950
is and what you want to do, I tell you it
will improve, he’ll definitely improve and

109
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,270
he’ll feel your love.

110
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:57,030
Of course sometimes, sometimes it’s necessary
to also forgive such a person.

111
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,160
Such a person is to be forgiven, absolutely.

112
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,370
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs, all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

113
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,860
and he goes on still with the same, doesn't
mean that.

114
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,680
“Forgiven” means “forgotten.”

115
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,370
Such and such person has been misbehaving,
so just forget, forget it, completely forget

116
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,370
it.

117
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,813
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja Yogi
guru.

118
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:35,630
I must say others gurus were not like that,
they were absolutely, I would say, extremely

119
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:42,709
hot-tempered, and they used to lose temper
on people.

120
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:50,240
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them.

121
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,279
And with this kindness You cannot create good
people.

122
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,390
I’ve had enough of it,” he said.

123
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:05,690
“I had made two people into gurus, and one
of them got lost in the money.”

124
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,310
“All right, what happened to the second?”

125
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,440
“And second one got lost in the women.”

126
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,760
So I said, ”Now it's all right.

127
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,590
If they are lost, they are lost, but if you
can revive them with your love, affection

128
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,690
and kindness, better get around them.”

129
00:14:27,690 --> 00:15:52,310
So the one who was lost… [interruption]

130
00:15:52,310 --> 00:16:15,850
So as a guru, you must conclude that they
are still lingering with their inheritance.

131
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,870
But the second problem is much worse, because
human beings can think.

132
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:29,430
Of course animals also think, but it is always
conditioning.

133
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,790
Whatever conditioning they have, accordingly
they behave.

134
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:41,089
But they don't have ego, that kind as human
beings have developed.

135
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:46,600
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

136
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:55,649
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that “We have done so much,

137
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:03,450
we have worked so hard to achieve this state,
and why should we give Realizations to others?”

138
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:13,059
Or if they have got Realization, then, “What
have they done?

139
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:15,079
Why should they get Realization?”

140
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:23,679
It’s become a comparison between their own
state and how they have achieved it, and how

141
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,809
others have to achieve it.

142
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:36,910
So they make all kinds of different torturing,
troubling maneuvres.

143
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:53,030
For example, they may make the disciple stand
on his head, give his family up, do this,

144
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,310
do that.

145
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,750
They’ll beat them, they can beat also.

146
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:07,430
They will make him stay in the water for a
long time, make him stand under, on one feet.

147
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:22,200
Like this they punish, and the worst comes
to worst, they may beat with sticks or with

148
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
stones.

149
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,410
They’re like that.

150
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,730
They don't want to talk, they don't want to
understand what the another person has to

151
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:40,900
say, or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

152
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,850
All this anger and all these things might
have been all right before, but after the

153
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,110
advent of Sahaja Yoga you must know it is
not necessary.

154
00:18:51,110 --> 00:19:01,640
It is not at all necessary to give any physical
punishment to your disciples.

155
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,850
Now also the mental punishment to your disciple
should not be given.

156
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:15,380
Like people start saying all kinds of things
to their disciple; like saying they, I am

157
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:22,900
saying, say there is a leader, and the leader
finds something wrong with the disciple, then

158
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,470
he goes on saying, “Now you are like this,
your father was like this, your grandfather

159
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,600
was like this, your great- grandfather was
like this, and you are also like this.”

160
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,380
Or some sort of thing that will hurt him.

161
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,900
By hurting a person, you are not going to
help.

162
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:46,070
Supposing while walking you are hurt, you
can't walk.

163
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:54,320
In your spiritual ascent also if you are hurt,
you cannot go ahead.

164
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,620
So not to hurt people is very important.

165
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:06,090
Once you go on hurting others, then you are
not a good guru, you are not a one who is

166
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:12,510
really being kind and understanding of the
disciple.

167
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:20,900
In Sahaja Yoga it's a different thing altogether,
because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga

168
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:28,910
without doing any kind of penance, any kind
of a guilty consciousness, confessions, anything.

169
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,910
Nothing!

170
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:37,669
As you are, you got your Realization.

171
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:42,390
Nobody had to stand on their heads, give up
their husbands, wives, their families, this

172
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,820
thing - nothing of the kind.

173
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:51,309
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,
whatever conditions you are, you are given

174
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:56,230
Realization - it’s a fact.

175
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,970
You don't have to pay for it, you don't have
to exert yourself, don't have to do anything.

176
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,610
Just you get it, sitting down wherever you
are.

177
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:17,310
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you that you have a power of love,

178
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,160
of compassion.

179
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,350
Out of your love you have given Realization.

180
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,290
We never realize that.

181
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:29,460
Supposing we are anxious to give Realization
to people, we want to go to the villages,

182
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,210
work there and give them Realization.

183
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,210
Why?

184
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,490
Why do we do it?

185
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:43,020
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything, but just out of the love that

186
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:47,900
is within your heart that you feel, “Why
am I enjoying everything?

187
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,679
Why others are not enjoying?”

188
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:59,420
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realization.

189
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:05,049
Now you have become a greater human being,
and you feel concern.

190
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:10,600
Others are getting ruined, they are going
on the wrong path, they are doing wrong things;

191
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:20,110
and that makes you feel very, very upset,
and you want to help them.

192
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:27,250
And this understanding once you have, then
you will know how to deal with the person

193
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:33,980
with whom you have to behave like a guru.

194
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,820
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

195
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:47,690
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they have committed, but that too in a, such

196
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:59,750
a soft manner that a person doesn’t get
any shock out of that.

197
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:10,491
All this thing of attachments also: now somebody
has too much attachment, say, for the family,

198
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:16,450
for the wife, for the children or someone.

199
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:23,730
And once they come to Sahaj Yoga, still they
have same amount of attachment.

200
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,100
All right, doesn’t matter.

201
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:34,720
But how far they will go with that attachment,
how long it will continue is the point.

202
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,380
You should be detached.

203
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:45,400
If I say, you cannot be; it's a state, it's
a state of mind when you are detached.

204
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:52,340
But when it comes to doing something for them,
you will go all out to help them.

205
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,929
But you are not a attached person.

206
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:01,620
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

207
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:09,370
Attached person is always worried about the
other person, goes on thinking about the other

208
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:15,820
person, cannot think of Sahaja Yoga, only
think of the people with whom he is attached.

209
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:23,530
Then he is very sensitive, you can't say anything
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise

210
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,070
he jumps.

211
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,880
Attachment is also with the name that he has.

212
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:39,320
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing, or some big position, then what

213
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,010
does he do?

214
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:50,440
You can't challenge him any way, you cannot
by any words you can challenge him, because

215
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
he’s so identified with that.

216
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,920
He thinks he’s a big person who has achieved
such a lot of positions in life.

217
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:12,950
He’s so much attached that he wants also
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

218
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:25,870
Now which is the way you can solve that problem?

219
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:36,350
Supposing somebody is very much attached to
his wife, say for example, then you should

220
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:42,700
not discuss and argue with that person, not
at all, because he’s still coming up slowly,

221
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,570
slowly up to this stage.

222
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:53,240
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

223
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,970
So what do you have to do?

224
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:01,230
If he’s attached to his wife, let it be.

225
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:10,280
But the Divine will work it out, and he will
realize that what he has been thinking, doing

226
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,860
and taking decisions is all wrong.

227
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:21,309
And once he discovered it himself, then he
will get detached.

228
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:27,770
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out, it will never work out.

229
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:36,830
So you must understand that as human beings,
whatever we were, also as Sahaja Yogis, we

230
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,080
have problems.

231
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:47,410
And these should be slowly, slowly should
be dissolved; not by argument, not by saying

232
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,370
things, but by love and compassion.

233
00:26:51,370 --> 00:27:02,490
If you have love for a person, you will be
amazed, ninety-nine percent people value love.

234
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:09,120
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

235
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:17,320
First is his inheritance, second is, he thinks,
and thirdly that he values love.

236
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:26,669
Anybody who loves, the another person values
that love, because he thinks that “This

237
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:35,590
particular person is loving me; not my wealth,
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he is

238
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,000
loving me.”

239
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:49,230
And this idea of love, this is something that
will get him completely detached from that

240
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,230
person, easily.

241
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,230
How?

242
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:59,430
Now it looks very funny that if you like somebody,
if you love somebody, and then you should

243
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,240
get detached.

244
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,539
It’s only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

245
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:19,320
In Sahaja Yoga your state of mind is such
that you are absolutely detached and absolutely

246
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,220
attached.

247
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,130
How?

248
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:38,289
For example now, say I have My daughter, so
I’m detached, I never telephone to her,

249
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:45,260
I am never bothered about her; because in
Sahaja Yoga, you know how is that person.

250
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,110
If the vibrations are right, why should you
telephone?

251
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,970
Why should you talk to her?

252
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,730
Why should you ask for anything?

253
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,730
No need.

254
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,080
Only on vibrations you'll know how the person
is.

255
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,669
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

256
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:09,480
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing or are indicating something serious

257
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:19,720
about that person, what you will do, you'll
put full attention to that, full attention.

258
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,890
You put attention, but not attachment.

259
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,450
So the attachment doesn’t solve the problem.

260
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,080
What solves the problem is attention.

261
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:40,910
But when you are not detached, then your attention
is attached attention.

262
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:50,510
It's an attention that is not available to
everyone, an attention that gets stuck, absolutely

263
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:55,890
stuck into that person with whom you are identified.

264
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,669
Try to understand.

265
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:06,500
So to be identified with someone is not actually,
what we can say, paying attention to that

266
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,900
person.

267
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,180
And then your attention will work.

268
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:19,130
If you are of that level, whenever you put
attention to that particular person who needs

269
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,549
your attention, it will work.

270
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:27,590
But if you are all the time wasting your attention
on a person because you’re attached to that

271
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:35,020
person, your attention will be tired, it won't
work out.

272
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:44,059
It's a big, I should say, a paradox, that
if you are attached to someone, then your

273
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:47,340
attention doesn’t work.

274
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,720
And if you are not attached to that person…

275
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,350
You do everything else: now you have to give
lecture, all right, I’m giving lecture;

276
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,210
then I have to do some cooking, I'll do cooking;
this, that, that and that.

277
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,620
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person, all the time you want to have

278
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,200
connection with that person - it’s not necessary.

279
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,559
That person is all right.

280
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,840
What is there to be so much worried about
that person?

281
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,170
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things, you have to raise

282
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,050
Kundalini of so many.

283
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:26,419
Now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, it's not a very good thing.

284
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:35,470
By that kind of attachment your attention
also becomes useless, absolutely useless.

285
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,039
So let the attention be free.

286
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:46,610
Attention should not be bound by your attachments.

287
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:57,230
Attention should be absolutely free, so it
works automatically, automatically, and you

288
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:04,929
will be amazed, even if you do not pay attention,
the attention will work it.

289
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:13,330
It is such a big thing to have this spiritual
attention, which is nothing but love.

290
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,242
It will just act.

291
00:32:15,242 --> 00:32:18,770
You'll be amazed how it acts.

292
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:27,040
It's another world I am talking about, not
this mundane world but something higher, where

293
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:34,020
your attention works, and works so beautifully
that you are amazed how it has worked.

294
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,910
But you should not bound it by your attachments.

295
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:44,450
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere, only the people who are attached to

296
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:49,060
you, or you are attached to those persons.

297
00:32:49,060 --> 00:33:02,860
That's why identification is not the way a
guru should work it out.

298
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:11,029
Now there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

299
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:17,970
He thinks this is he is the best, and he should
be encouraged and he should be given all the

300
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,380
possible help.

301
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,779
But that’s not going to help.

302
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:28,820
But on the contrary, he should say, “This
is already a good fellow.

303
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,740
He has risen already very high, he has gone
very deep.”

304
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:38,950
So pay attention to those who are not so good,
and talk to them about it that “You have

305
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,350
to come up,” in a very sweet manner.

306
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:51,490
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there, or who are still struggling.

307
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:55,450
You have to understand them.

308
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,830
You have to notice, what are they doing?

309
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:08,540
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

310
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:14,330
What is the problem, why the Divine is not
flowing through them?

311
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:21,320
And you'll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention, is because

312
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,619
it is focused on someone all the time.

313
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:31,150
They feel that this is their responsibility,
that it should be focused.

314
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:39,120
It's just to give, it's an explanation, it's
just a explanation to say that “You see,

315
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,089
naturally I have to be worried about this,
and worried about that.”

316
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:47,490
It's just an explanation.

317
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:56,599
But if you really don't fix your attention
to one person or ten persons only, then your

318
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:02,200
attention looks after the whole world.

319
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:14,320
It receives all the information, and also
it gives all the information what is to be

320
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,180
done to correct the situation.

321
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:28,800
So one has to rise into that state where you
do not get angry, annoyed, upset - no, not

322
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,290
at all.

323
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:41,330
What happens to you, that you see a situation,
and in that you are not involved.

324
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:47,620
You see the situation and you are away from
it.

325
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,900
Then you can solve that problem better.

326
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,560
But if you are part and parcel of that problem,
then you cannot solve.

327
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:11,720
It's like this I was telling, that those who
are fighting, say, cannot solve the problem,

328
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:19,470
but a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

329
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:31,730
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that if you are identified, if you are involved

330
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:42,730
with one person or with one kind of a thing,
then you are lost.

331
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:52,230
So our attention has to be always free and
can be applied widely, wherever needed.

332
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,360
That is the state one has to reach.

333
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:01,330
If you reach that state of mind, it's not
I am saying you can do anything about it,

334
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,210
it’s just a state of mind.

335
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,349
Now, how do we do that?

336
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:12,930
Only through introspection.

337
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:23,800
Through introspection you will understand
that you need help to solve your problems.

338
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:34,190
Firstly the problem is how to face yourself,
because you are a little bit shy or maybe

339
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,620
nervous about it.

340
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:48,830
As the time comes, you'd be amazed that this
nervousness has no meaning at all.

341
00:37:48,830 --> 00:38:02,680
When you try to be deliberate about it, then
it won't work out; but if you are Sahaja,

342
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,070
it will work out.

343
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:11,950
So we come to the second point, apart from
the attention, that we should leave everything

344
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,589
into the hands of Paramchaitanya.

345
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:19,200
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

346
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,180
“This is the problem?

347
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,040
Let Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

348
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,540
We are not bothered.”

349
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,220
So a detachment comes in.

350
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:37,410
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve, so you are not in it, you are away

351
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,410
from it.

352
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:47,380
Very, very simple things are there, that if
you understand that we suffer, because everybody

353
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,640
feels responsible for us.

354
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,930
Everybody thinks they are responsible, they
have to do this responsibility for us, somebody

355
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,960
says this responsibility he has to do.

356
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:08,780
All these things are worrying them, and that
is the reason today we have a very complex

357
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,770
society.

358
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:18,900
They are suffering from all kinds of diseases
in which only thinking is responsible.

359
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:26,030
By this thinking all the time, thinking about
one person, thinking about one problem, you

360
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,000
reach nowhere.

361
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,349
At that moment, what you have to do is to
leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

362
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:48,730
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage, It will solve the problem.

363
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,430
Now I will tell you one thing, an experience.

364
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,730
This time I was in America.

365
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,550
I wanted to have a puja there.

366
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,610
So I said, "All right, let them come for the
puja.

367
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,630
It's nice if they want to come."

368
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,770
Then they told Me that "Mother, we want to
bring presents for You for the puja.

369
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,460
So how can we bring the presents?"

370
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,829
I said, "It's very simple.

371
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,630
Don't bring!"

372
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,690
But they wouldn't listen to that.

373
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:25,460
They said, "We'll have to bring, and the Customs
will trouble us and do this and do that."

374
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:34,270
So there was only one building ahead was,
there was another building where they were

375
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,750
having a liquidation sale.

376
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,460
I said, "This is something nice!

377
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,780
One can have a look at it."

378
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:50,200
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable, very, very expensive things

379
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,390
for throw-away prices.

380
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,770
I was amazed how it is there.

381
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,460
So I told them, "I can purchase all these
things.

382
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,420
I'll pay you, but you bring all these things
to Canajoharie."

383
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,839
They agreed, “All right, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

384
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,990
And they brought all the things all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

385
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:19,300
We had no problem of Customs or anything;
I paid them there.

386
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:38,859
How, you see, things can be improved by understanding
what is the most important thing: is to love.

387
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:44,110
But love is truth, and truth is love.

388
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:55,690
If you have love for somebody, genuine love,
then anything you want to do with that person

389
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:03,470
will be absolutely obvious, because it will
be truthful.

390
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:08,971
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut, because it

391
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:12,700
is absolutely truthful.

392
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:19,530
So when you are dealing with somebody also,
you should be extremely truthful.

393
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:29,500
Of course, you need not say things that will
hurt him, but you must use such ways and methods

394
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:39,420
that will not in any way hurt the other person,
which will have an effect on that person.

395
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:45,640
So this kind of a gurus we need now very much
in Sahaja Yoga, because by Sahaja Yoga has

396
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,860
spread a lot.

397
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:55,040
So first of all, our temper has to be brought
into proper shape.

398
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,940
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru has no business to lose temper at

399
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,170
all, on any point whatsoever.

400
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:18,170
If they can really do that much, it will save
our, I mean, so much of worry, so much of

401
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:22,270
problem, so much of mess we create.

402
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:26,310
All this can be solved very easily.

403
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:34,530
But first we must have pure love in our heart,
not love out of some gain or out of some sort

404
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:42,170
of reward, but pure love if we have, then
we can work it out very easily, anything that

405
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,520
you want to do.

406
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:51,460
This is a very lengthy thing which can go
on forever.

407
00:43:51,460 --> 00:44:00,310
Because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties and why they are gurus,

408
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:07,430
it’s very important, very important position
that they are gurus.

409
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:17,579
And they should use that position for exhibiting
tremendous understanding of their disciple,

410
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:24,390
and also their purpose should be clear-cut.

411
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:32,260
People should not doubt him, should not think,
why he is doing such and such things?

412
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:40,550
It should not be a mystery, it should be absolutely
clear-cut.

413
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:49,920
All these things I am telling you today, because
today we have completed ten, our ten years

414
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,560
of stay in Cabella.

415
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,790
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me.

416
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:03,510
They have brought lots of people to Sahaja
Yoga, I tell you, very lots of people.

417
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:08,210
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it and said, "Where are You going

418
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,700
to live?" and all that.

419
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:19,660
But here only it has worked, and that should
be accepted as a very good indication that

420
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:29,859
Sahaja Yoga does miraculous things, miraculous.

421
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:36,020
But the foremost thing is, you must know vibrations.

422
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,020
If you don't know about vibrations, then you
can't do it.

423
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,660
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me, “Mother, very lonely

424
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,470
place, there are mafias around.

425
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,470
Only six, seven houses there.

426
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:48,470
Where are You going?

427
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,740
What is this?”

428
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,450
They all warned Me.

429
00:45:51,450 --> 00:46:00,200
So I came here, and immediately I told the
Mayor, “I am going to buy it, and tomorrow

430
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,270
I'll pay you the money.”

431
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:08,359
He was surprised: how can I do that?

432
00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:11,400
I said, "Don't worry!

433
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,690
Perfectly all right."

434
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,270
On vibrations it was.

435
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:24,670
On vibrations I decided that this is a wonderful
place.

436
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,810
And vibrations helped Me so much that time,
though everybody discouraged Me and everybody

437
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,650
gave Me a very big picture, horrible one.

438
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:38,230
But still, where is the mafia now?

439
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,040
Gone, finished.

440
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:54,890
Now, to know about a thing, you have to meditate
and improve your vision, which should be clear-cut.

441
00:46:54,890 --> 00:47:04,200
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting your particular ideas about

442
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:10,820
a particular thing, but it should be a vision
which should be clear-cut.

443
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:22,750
With Sahaja Yoga, one has to know the protection
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

444
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:30,770
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

445
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:37,690
I am sure you will get yourself this experience.

446
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:46,760
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga like this
you just get meditative, you just get meditative,

447
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:54,260
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that - just meditative.

448
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:59,980
And this meditative temperament or whatever
is the state, emits vibrations.

449
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:09,470
It emits and creates path for you, for your
work, for your life, for everything.

450
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:14,270
You don't have to struggle with anyone, you
don't have to fight with anyone, you don't

451
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,710
have to argue with anyone.

452
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:26,450
Just try to meditate, and achieve a state
which I’m describing to you, where you get

453
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:37,670
completely surrounded by love and affection.

454
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:47,010
May God bless you all.

455
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:56,369
There's one thing is important to understand,
that you should not go to extremes of everything,

456
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:59,160
which is also a human quality.

457
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:05,720
For example, if they are rational, they go
on rationalizing everything, “I can't do

458
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,640
this, I can't do that.”

459
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,940
Something like that goes on.

460
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:17,010
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional, and they become so emotional

461
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:23,400
that they start doing wrong things in the
name of emotionality.

462
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,520
You have to overcome these two things.

463
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,170
If you have not overcome that, what's the
use?

464
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:32,730
What’s the use of calling yourself Sahaja
Yogis?

465
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,849
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

466
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:39,640
Going to the extremes must be avoided.

467
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,589
Keep a watch upon yourself.

468
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:47,260
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out; you might develop cancer, may

469
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,730
develop horrible diseases on one side.

470
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:57,640
And on the other side you might become a very
rational person, and no Sahaja Yoga will enter

471
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,820
your head.

472
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:05,410
So you have to keep the balance all the time.

473
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:12,200
And with that balance, like somebody is a
Sahaja Yogini and she has done something very

474
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,260
wrong, then you should not become emotionally
attached, “Oh, Mother, what is it?

475
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,300
And we should forgive her.”

476
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,300
No!

477
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:30,010
You tell her that “You must improve your
vibrations, and must come to a balance.

478
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:35,260
And once you are in balance, then I will consider
your case.

479
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:40,710
Then I will say it is so or not.”

480
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:48,170
But if she has no balance, she goes into rationality,
she goes into emotional thing, and this emotional

481
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:54,670
business can take you to any nonsensical thing,
as it is a psychological case.

482
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:59,760
And one can go into very, very wrong things
that they are doing, out of this emotional

483
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:09,210
thing, you see, like even singing songs that
are neurotic or anything, you see.

484
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,710
All this emotional thing can take you anywhere.

485
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,859
So to be emotional is not needed.

486
00:51:14,859 --> 00:51:17,660
You must love.

487
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:23,829
And left side is what you can call another
extreme.

488
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:30,210
One side is, is this emotional, another is
rational.

489
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:35,020
In rationality you can start justifying anything,
like Hitler did.

490
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,210
He said, “No, this was right, I was doing
was right.”

491
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,940
He took something into his head and now, “This
is right.”

492
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,080
This is rationality.

493
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:50,210
So both things are to be properly balanced,
and you should see that whatever you are doing

494
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:57,589
are giving you a proper result.

495
00:51:57,589 --> 00:52:01,420
So thank you very much again and again.

496
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:09,400
May God bless you.

497
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:17,390
May God bless you.
