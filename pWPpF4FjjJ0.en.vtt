1997-1004 EP Navaratri Puja P2,
Cabella

01:28:55.112 --> 01:29:00.333
“Litany for the doom of Materasura”

01:29:01.136 --> 01:29:07.745
This is the world that feeds the Swiss
Banks’ Octopus.

01:29:07.996 --> 01:29:14.269
This is the world where too much
is not enough.

01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:19.466
This is the world where negativity
is a plus.

01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:27.390
This is the world where the saints
say: “Enough”.

01:29:43.549 --> 01:29:48.411
1. This is a world where 1.3 billion
people

01:29:48.612 --> 01:29:52.630
live on an income of less
than $1 a day

01:29:52.831 --> 01:29:57.676
and where the planet does not have
enough natural resources

01:29:57.877 --> 01:30:02.669
to sustain, at a worldwide scale,
the consumption pattern

01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:06.606
of Malaysia, leave alone America.

01:30:06.807 --> 01:30:08.620
PLEASE SHRI DURGA,

01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:13.445
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:30:13.646 --> 01:30:18.279
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:26.028
Shri Durga Namoh Namaha.

01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:29.748
2. This is a world where ten per cent
of world trade

01:30:29.949 --> 01:30:35.130
is generated by drugs and narco-traffics,
or US$100 billion

01:30:35.331 --> 01:30:39.287
represents the amount that yearly
poisons mankind,

01:30:39.488 --> 01:30:42.451
while money laundering in Switzerland
and elsewhere

01:30:42.659 --> 01:30:45.083
has become a most prosperous
activity,

01:30:45.284 --> 01:30:48.911
reaching all levels of society.

01:30:49.112 --> 01:30:52.271
PLEASE SHRI RAKTABIJA VINASHINI,

01:30:52.472 --> 01:30:56.656
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:30:56.857 --> 01:31:01.776
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:31:01.977 --> 01:31:11.568
Shri Raktabija Vinashini
Namoh Namaha.

01:31:11.769 --> 01:31:15.636
3. This is a world where Wall Street
sucks the wealth

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:19.253
from the working middle class
to bestow it upon the rich

01:31:19.454 --> 01:31:23.691
and where Walt Disney makes you
forget all about it.

01:31:23.892 --> 01:31:26.472
PLEASE SHRI KATYAYANI,

01:31:26.673 --> 01:31:30.860
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:31:31.061 --> 01:31:35.798
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:31:35.999 --> 01:31:45.587
Shri Katyayani Namoh Namaha.

01:31:45.788 --> 01:31:51.525
4. This is a world where an Egyptian
eats at MacDonalds in Cairo

01:31:51.726 --> 01:31:57.177
and a Chinese at Pizza Hut in Beijing,
because modern consumerism

01:31:57.378 --> 01:32:02.092
expresses the lowest common
denominator of world culture

01:32:02.293 --> 01:32:07.865
and erases the meaning of national
values and traditions.

01:32:08.066 --> 01:32:10.895
PLEASE SHRI SHAKAMBARI,

01:32:11.096 --> 01:32:15.208
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:32:15.409 --> 01:32:19.864
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:32:20.065 --> 01:32:27.694
Shri Shakambari Namoh Namaha.

01:32:27.895 --> 01:32:32.104
5. The new multinational entities are
experimenting with new forms

01:32:32.305 --> 01:32:37.153
of dictatorship, setting their production
sites in the developing world,

01:32:37.354 --> 01:32:40.591
reducing to slavery a subdued
working class

01:32:40.792 --> 01:32:45.145
and exploiting children on the altar
of productivity gains.

01:32:45.346 --> 01:32:47.473
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHAKARI,

01:32:47.674 --> 01:32:51.731
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:32:51.932 --> 01:32:56.286
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:32:56.487 --> 01:33:04.341
Shri Rakshakari Namoh Namaha.

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:09.708
6. The globalization of production and
services allow a few global players

01:33:09.939 --> 01:33:13.762
to befool us and impose the rules
of their game

01:33:13.963 --> 01:33:17.200
to the mass of unsuspecting
consumers.

01:33:17.401 --> 01:33:19.364
PLEASE SHRI BHIMADEVI,

01:33:19.565 --> 01:33:23.450
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:33:23.651 --> 01:33:27.959
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:37.475
Shri Bhimadevi Namoh Namaha.

01:33:37.676 --> 01:33:42.131
7. Vast restructuration endeavours
are progressively leading

01:33:42.332 --> 01:33:46.485
to the eradication of small and
medium-sized enterprises

01:33:46.686 --> 01:33:53.095
for the benefit of gigantic corporations
operating on a worldwide scale.

01:33:53.296 --> 01:33:54.859
PLEASE SHRI CHANDIKA,

01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:59.862
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:34:00.063 --> 01:34:04.749
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:12.904
Shri Chandika Namoh Namaha.

01:34:13.105 --> 01:34:18.345
8. The gradual concentration of liquid
wealth in the hands of the super rich

01:34:18.546 --> 01:34:23.288
is marginalizing national sovereignty
and its elected officials,

01:34:23.489 --> 01:34:28.134
and is imposing a titanic dimension
to the ruler-ship of money.

01:34:28.335 --> 01:34:30.122
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHASAGNI,

01:34:30.323 --> 01:34:33.947
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:34:34.148 --> 01:34:39.041
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:34:39.242 --> 01:34:47.399
Shri Rakshasagni Namoh Namaha.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.759
9. Greed raised to the power 108

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.374
means the pauperization of the world’s
middle class

01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:58.612
and outrageous wealth for
the remaining 10%.

01:34:58.813 --> 01:35:01.450
PLEASE SHRI DAITYENDRA MARDINI,

01:35:01.651 --> 01:35:06.040
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:35:06.241 --> 01:35:10.664
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:35:10.865 --> 01:35:21.794
Shri Daityendra Mardini Namoh Namaha.

01:35:21.995 --> 01:35:26.864
10. The systematic elimination
of alternative economic solutions,

01:35:27.072 --> 01:35:33.025
unequal trade and financial manipulations
are challenging

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:37.614
the equitable distribution of wealth
among the population of the world.

01:35:37.815 --> 01:35:39.601
PLEASE SHRI VAJRINI,

01:35:39.802 --> 01:35:43.091
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:35:43.292 --> 01:35:48.324
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:35:48.525 --> 01:35:55.633
Shri Vajrini Namoh Namaha.

01:35:55.834 --> 01:36:00.359
11. The deregulation of the financial
markets has opened wide the gates

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:06.020
of Jurassic Park for the large financial
predators to roam about

01:36:06.221 --> 01:36:11.221
and thousands of billions of dollars are
created from nothing by speculators

01:36:11.422 --> 01:36:14.776
to feed their unlimited thirst for money
and power.

01:36:14.977 --> 01:36:17.271
PLEASE SHRI UGRACHANDESHWARI,

01:36:17.472 --> 01:36:21.966
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:36:22.167 --> 01:36:26.376
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:36:26.577 --> 01:36:35.901
Shri Ugrachandeshwari Namoh Namaha.

01:36:36.102 --> 01:36:40.859
12. The Swiss financial centre works
as a haven for rich tax-dodgers

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:44.919
from developing countries, and diverts
needed capital

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.145
from national investment programmes,
industrial infrastructures

01:36:49.346 --> 01:36:55.770
and social expenditure to inflate the stock
exchange of the developed countries.

01:36:55.971 --> 01:36:58.353
PLEASE SHRI UGRAPRABHA,

01:36:58.554 --> 01:37:02.595
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:37:02.796 --> 01:37:07.361
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:37:07.562 --> 01:37:16.807
Shri Ugraprabha Namoh Namaha.

01:37:17.008 --> 01:37:22.027
13. The trend of today’s mega mergers
is to marginalize the State,

01:37:22.228 --> 01:37:26.731
bypass national legislation, manipulate
the market,

01:37:26.932 --> 01:37:31.323
control the economy and, for all
practical purposes,

01:37:31.524 --> 01:37:36.742
finish off the social foundations
of real democracy.

01:37:36.943 --> 01:37:38.769
PLEASE SHRI MAHAKALI,

01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:43.655
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:37:43.856 --> 01:37:48.701
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:37:48.902 --> 01:37:58.030
Shri Mahakali Namoh Namaha.

01:37:58.231 --> 01:38:01.900
14. The lure and mirage of such a radical
concentration of wealth

01:38:02.101 --> 01:38:06.603
and power threatens to neutralize
all seeking of the Spirit,

01:38:06.804 --> 01:38:10.640
and the deafening roar of the triumph
of asuric materialism

01:38:10.841 --> 01:38:13.913
destroys the hope of millions
of seekers.

01:38:14.114 --> 01:38:15.859
PLEASE SHRI MAHAMAYA,

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:20.356
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:38:20.557 --> 01:38:25.298
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:38:25.499 --> 01:38:33.990
Shri Mahamaya Namoh Namaha.

01:38:34.191 --> 01:38:38.699
15. The alliance of mafia, secretive
bankers and corrupt managers

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:44.070
has infiltrated the world economy and
is threatening the ethics of collectivity

01:38:44.271 --> 01:38:50.686
which provides the foundation for the value
system of our entire civilization.

01:38:50.887 --> 01:38:52.953
PLEASE SHRI VIRATANGANA,

01:38:53.154 --> 01:38:57.871
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:38:58.072 --> 01:39:02.544
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:39:02.745 --> 01:39:12.657
Shri Viratangana Namoh Namaha.

01:39:12.858 --> 01:39:18.191
16. The enormous increase of financial
assets has siphoned cash money

01:39:18.392 --> 01:39:23.149
out of the real economy and channeled it
into the financial markets,

01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:26.547
building up a planetary gambling
casino

01:39:26.748 --> 01:39:30.846
where arbitrary currency speculation
can mount

01:39:31.047 --> 01:39:38.220
huge attacks against any country which
tries to follow socially-minded policies.

01:39:38.421 --> 01:39:40.929
PLEASE SHRI KHADGAPALINI,

01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:45.380
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:39:45.581 --> 01:39:49.802
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:39:50.003 --> 01:39:58.150
Shri Khadgapalini Namoh Namaha.

01:39:58.351 --> 01:40:04.223
17. The etheric sophistication of financial
electronic circuits has created

01:40:04.424 --> 01:40:10.658
a virtual world where the immateriality
of money has become the sole reality.

01:40:10.859 --> 01:40:12.466
PLEASE SHRI VISHNUMAYA,

01:40:12.667 --> 01:40:17.233
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:40:17.434 --> 01:40:21.674
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:40:21.875 --> 01:40:30.070
Shri Vishnumaya Namoh Namaha.

01:40:30.271 --> 01:40:33.254
18. The progressive domination
of technology

01:40:33.455 --> 01:40:37.276
is sucking the blood of the farmer,
the artist and the potter,

01:40:37.484 --> 01:40:43.215
turning the man who works with his hands
into a permanently handicapped person.

01:40:43.416 --> 01:40:46.243
PLEASE SHRI DEVA KARYA SAMUDYATA,

01:40:46.444 --> 01:40:50.580
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:40:50.781 --> 01:40:55.220
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:40:55.421 --> 01:41:05.230
Shri Deva Karya Samudyata Namoh Namaha.

01:41:05.431 --> 01:41:10.528
19. The information highway leads
to the maya web of a virtual world

01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:15.469
where human attention is scattered,
desire is confused,

01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:21.141
truth is atomized and the soul
is thereby reduced to slavery.

01:41:21.342 --> 01:41:23.088
PLEASE SHRI RADHA,

01:41:23.289 --> 01:41:27.855
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:41:28.056 --> 01:41:32.291
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:41:32.492 --> 01:41:40.412
Shri Radha Namoh Namaha.

01:41:40.613 --> 01:41:44.392
20. Modern communication can become
a domestic [may that mean “demonic”] tool

01:41:44.593 --> 01:41:49.111
in the hands of a few media moguls
and opinion-making tycoons

01:41:49.312 --> 01:41:56.435
which are spreading their hedonistic
world views of power, money and sex.

01:41:56.636 --> 01:41:58.756
PLEASE SHRI SHUKRATMIKA,

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:03.410
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:42:03.611 --> 01:42:08.050
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:42:08.251 --> 01:42:16.306
Shri Shukratmika Namoh Namaha.

01:42:16.507 --> 01:42:21.381
21. The Mlechas of Satan have infiltrated
the Internet global village

01:42:21.582 --> 01:42:25.351
to pour pornographic dirt and filth
within the nest

01:42:25.552 --> 01:42:31.354
of the family and to spread hell’s shadows
in the minds of helpless people.

01:42:31.555 --> 01:42:33.585
PLEASE SHRI NIRMALA KUMARI,

01:42:33.786 --> 01:42:38.201
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:42:38.409 --> 01:42:43.342
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:42:43.543 --> 01:42:54.029
Shri Nirmala Kumari Namoh Namaha.

01:42:54.230 --> 01:42:59.242
Hail, salutations to the great Devi!
Aum, Amen.

01:42:59.443 --> 01:43:03.494
May there be Auspiciousness,
Joy and Peace.

01:43:03.695 --> 01:43:06.735
May Thy Divine grace penetrate
the waters

01:43:06.936 --> 01:43:10.749
flowing from our mountains to the four
corners of Europe

01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:16.126
and spread the pure vibrations
of the Aquarian Age.

01:43:16.327 --> 01:43:20.043
Salutations to Thee Shri Mataji
Nirmala Devi Ji,

01:43:20.244 --> 01:43:24.067
the Resplendent One, O formidable
Avatar!

01:43:24.268 --> 01:43:28.666
We bow to Thee, most pleasing
yet most frightful,

01:43:28.867 --> 01:43:34.824
who has been approached by the Trimurtis
for the sake of protecting the universe.

01:43:35.025 --> 01:43:38.204
Today, in this festival of Navaratri,

01:43:38.405 --> 01:43:41.890
we chant the litany of Thy children
in Switzerland

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:44.474
for the defeat of the foes
of the Spirit,

01:43:44.675 --> 01:43:52.540
and we offer to Thy glittering teeth
the new asuric forms of materialism.

01:43:52.741 --> 01:43:55.023
PLEASE SHRI RAKTADANTIKA,

01:43:55.224 --> 01:44:01.663
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT
MATERIALISM CREATED.

01:44:01.864 --> 01:44:09.751
Om Twameva Sakshat

01:44:09.952 --> 01:44:16.608
Shri Kalki Sakshat

01:44:16.809 --> 01:44:24.808
Shri Sahastrara Swamini

01:44:25.009 --> 01:44:37.650
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

01:44:37.859 --> 01:44:52.150
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha.

01:44:59.844 --> 01:45:10.229
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

01:45:11.819 --> 01:45:20.478
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

01:45:20.679 --> 01:45:29.760
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

01:45:29.961 --> 01:45:36.495
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

01:45:37.116 --> 01:45:43.456
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

01:45:46.192 --> 01:45:53.243
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

01:45:53.444 --> 01:45:56.874
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

01:45:57.075 --> 01:46:06.462
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

01:46:07.442 --> 01:46:11.782
And for that I have a plan.

01:46:11.983 --> 01:46:18.785
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

01:46:18.986 --> 01:46:24.935
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

01:46:25.136 --> 01:46:31.942
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

01:46:32.143 --> 01:46:36.899
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:40.899
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

01:46:41.122 --> 01:46:49.288
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

01:46:49.575 --> 01:46:57.385
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

01:46:58.027 --> 01:47:06.924
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

01:47:07.125 --> 01:47:12.516
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

01:47:12.717 --> 01:47:16.660
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

01:47:16.861 --> 01:47:24.815
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

01:47:25.016 --> 01:47:28.630
But not only in England, same in Paris:

01:47:28.831 --> 01:47:33.842
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

01:47:34.043 --> 01:47:38.419
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

01:47:39.102 --> 01:47:43.248
This madness is on and on and on.

01:47:43.449 --> 01:47:49.929
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:54.785
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

01:47:55.648 --> 01:48:00.323
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

01:48:00.524 --> 01:48:08.346
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

01:48:08.547 --> 01:48:14.919
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.620
of these useless things?

01:48:17.796 --> 01:48:21.222
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

01:48:21.423 --> 01:48:28.487
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

01:48:28.688 --> 01:48:32.897
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

01:48:33.097 --> 01:48:38.038
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

01:48:38.239 --> 01:48:45.706
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

01:48:45.907 --> 01:48:48.515
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

01:48:48.716 --> 01:48:52.432
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

01:48:52.633 --> 01:49:00.606
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

01:49:00.807 --> 01:49:07.194
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

01:49:07.395 --> 01:49:13.607
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:24.173
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

01:49:24.352 --> 01:49:32.315
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

01:49:32.516 --> 01:49:35.756
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

01:49:35.957 --> 01:49:40.077
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

01:49:40.278 --> 01:49:45.591
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

01:49:45.792 --> 01:49:48.528
So, it is against you.

01:49:48.729 --> 01:49:57.903
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

01:49:58.104 --> 01:50:03.697
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

01:50:03.898 --> 01:50:07.558
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

01:50:07.759 --> 01:50:18.295
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:22.590
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

01:50:22.791 --> 01:50:27.531
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

01:50:27.732 --> 01:50:31.882
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

01:50:32.083 --> 01:50:39.935
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

01:50:41.129 --> 01:50:46.766
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

01:50:46.967 --> 01:50:51.677
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

01:50:51.955 --> 01:51:01.423
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

01:51:01.624 --> 01:51:05.095
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

01:51:05.296 --> 01:51:10.458
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

01:51:10.637 --> 01:51:16.461
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

01:51:16.661 --> 01:51:22.257
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

01:51:22.458 --> 01:51:27.590
Because wisdom itself shows

01:51:27.791 --> 01:51:33.855
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:39.389
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:43.566
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

01:51:43.767 --> 01:51:49.680
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

01:51:49.881 --> 01:51:58.914
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

01:51:59.115 --> 01:52:02.965
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

01:52:03.166 --> 01:52:07.730
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

01:52:07.931 --> 01:52:11.871
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

01:52:12.072 --> 01:52:17.660
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

01:52:17.861 --> 01:52:21.884
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

01:52:22.085 --> 01:52:27.835
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

01:52:28.036 --> 01:52:31.665
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

01:52:31.866 --> 01:52:37.253
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

01:52:37.454 --> 01:52:42.151
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

01:52:42.352 --> 01:52:48.452
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

01:52:48.653 --> 01:52:54.740
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

01:52:54.941 --> 01:53:00.477
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

01:53:00.678 --> 01:53:06.436
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:14.181
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

01:53:14.382 --> 01:53:19.615
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

01:53:19.816 --> 01:53:22.401
Evening time the car used to come,

01:53:22.602 --> 01:53:28.986
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

01:53:29.187 --> 01:53:35.044
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

01:53:35.245 --> 01:53:42.337
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

01:53:42.538 --> 01:53:46.568
At the most you can see some lamppost.

01:53:46.769 --> 01:53:52.550
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:59.614
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:07.434
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

01:54:07.617 --> 01:54:12.696
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

01:54:12.897 --> 01:54:16.966
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

01:54:17.167 --> 01:54:23.479
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

01:54:24.373 --> 01:54:30.017
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

01:54:30.218 --> 01:54:34.684
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

01:54:34.885 --> 01:54:39.686
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

01:54:40.531 --> 01:54:45.164
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

01:54:45.365 --> 01:54:51.811
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

01:54:52.552 --> 01:55:01.112
Now see what has happened in, say,

01:55:01.313 --> 01:55:07.609
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

01:55:07.819 --> 01:55:12.601
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

01:55:12.802 --> 01:55:15.855
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

01:55:16.056 --> 01:55:20.913
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

01:55:21.635 --> 01:55:26.396
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

01:55:26.597 --> 01:55:34.871
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

01:55:35.072 --> 01:55:40.876
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

01:55:41.077 --> 01:55:45.282
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

01:55:45.483 --> 01:55:51.153
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:56.922
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

01:55:57.099 --> 01:55:59.834
And it’s all working out everywhere.

01:56:00.035 --> 01:56:05.343
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

01:56:05.544 --> 01:56:12.611
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

01:56:14.044 --> 01:56:17.353
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

01:56:17.554 --> 01:56:23.242
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

01:56:23.403 --> 01:56:25.994
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

01:56:26.171 --> 01:56:29.949
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

01:56:30.150 --> 01:56:34.676
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

01:56:34.877 --> 01:56:39.577
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

01:56:42.925 --> 01:56:47.790
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

01:56:47.991 --> 01:56:50.841
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

01:56:51.042 --> 01:56:56.856
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

01:56:57.057 --> 01:57:03.465
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

01:57:03.666 --> 01:57:08.185
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

01:57:08.386 --> 01:57:15.245
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

01:57:15.446 --> 01:57:25.568
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

01:57:25.769 --> 01:57:31.280
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

01:57:31.481 --> 01:57:33.827
So many have lost their money there,

01:57:34.004 --> 01:57:36.559
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:40.980
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

01:57:41.181 --> 01:57:50.025
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

01:57:50.922 --> 01:58:01.934
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

01:58:03.694 --> 01:58:09.362
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

01:58:09.703 --> 01:58:14.985
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

01:58:15.186 --> 01:58:22.248
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

01:58:22.454 --> 01:58:28.468
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

01:58:28.669 --> 01:58:33.754
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

01:58:33.955 --> 01:58:43.340
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

01:58:43.541 --> 01:58:46.491
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

01:58:46.692 --> 01:58:51.085
because I spent money on My family things
also.

01:58:51.286 --> 01:58:58.297
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.382
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

01:59:02.583 --> 01:59:09.216
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

01:59:09.417 --> 01:59:16.535
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

01:59:16.736 --> 01:59:20.363
Joy is much more in giving to others.

01:59:20.564 --> 01:59:28.852
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

01:59:29.053 --> 01:59:34.768
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

01:59:34.969 --> 01:59:42.736
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

01:59:42.937 --> 01:59:55.384
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

01:59:55.585 --> 02:00:00.407
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

02:00:00.608 --> 02:00:04.816
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

02:00:05.017 --> 02:00:09.600
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

02:00:09.801 --> 02:00:13.706
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

02:00:13.907 --> 02:00:19.262
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

02:00:19.463 --> 02:00:21.863
At least, there should be some embroidery,

02:00:22.064 --> 02:00:26.468
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

02:00:26.674 --> 02:00:31.066
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

02:00:31.267 --> 02:00:34.027
they are injurious to our health.

02:00:34.228 --> 02:00:39.367
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

02:00:39.568 --> 02:00:44.375
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

02:00:44.576 --> 02:00:50.121
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

02:00:50.322 --> 02:00:53.505
how many of you know?

02:00:58.093 --> 02:01:06.408
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

02:01:06.609 --> 02:01:10.698
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

02:01:10.899 --> 02:01:17.778
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

02:01:17.979 --> 02:01:21.062
From where does this sari comes?

02:01:21.263 --> 02:01:27.044
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

02:01:27.245 --> 02:01:31.311
But even western men also have the same
problem.

02:01:31.512 --> 02:01:35.570
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

02:01:35.766 --> 02:01:40.047
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

02:01:40.248 --> 02:01:43.494
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

02:01:43.695 --> 02:01:47.869
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:54.265
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

02:01:55.929 --> 02:02:02.014
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

02:02:03.907 --> 02:02:11.201
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

02:02:11.402 --> 02:02:17.324
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

02:02:17.525 --> 02:02:21.250
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

02:02:21.451 --> 02:02:25.181
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

02:02:25.382 --> 02:02:30.637
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

02:02:30.838 --> 02:02:38.105
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

02:02:38.306 --> 02:02:45.016
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

02:02:45.217 --> 02:02:52.084
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

02:02:52.285 --> 02:02:55.356
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

02:02:55.517 --> 02:02:59.368
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

02:02:59.569 --> 02:03:06.086
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

02:03:06.287 --> 02:03:11.314
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

02:03:11.515 --> 02:03:16.658
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

02:03:16.859 --> 02:03:23.692
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

02:03:23.893 --> 02:03:30.174
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

02:03:30.375 --> 02:03:35.682
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

02:03:35.883 --> 02:03:38.561
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

02:03:38.762 --> 02:03:42.824
this is red but it has green to match it.

02:03:43.025 --> 02:03:46.523
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

02:03:46.724 --> 02:03:51.754
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

02:03:51.955 --> 02:03:56.342
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

02:03:56.543 --> 02:04:00.329
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

02:04:01.773 --> 02:04:04.040
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

02:04:04.241 --> 02:04:07.254
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

02:04:07.455 --> 02:04:11.373
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

02:04:11.574 --> 02:04:15.684
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

02:04:15.885 --> 02:04:21.045
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

02:04:21.246 --> 02:04:24.864
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

02:04:25.065 --> 02:04:28.341
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

02:04:28.555 --> 02:04:33.905
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

02:04:34.106 --> 02:04:40.768
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

02:04:40.969 --> 02:04:47.902
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

02:04:48.103 --> 02:04:51.506
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

02:04:51.707 --> 02:04:55.123
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

02:04:55.324 --> 02:04:59.392
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

02:04:59.593 --> 02:05:03.774
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

02:05:03.975 --> 02:05:09.093
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

02:05:09.294 --> 02:05:14.517
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

02:05:14.718 --> 02:05:18.763
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

02:05:18.964 --> 02:05:22.722
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

02:05:22.923 --> 02:05:26.736
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

02:05:26.937 --> 02:05:29.715
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

02:05:29.916 --> 02:05:32.791
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:39.136
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

02:05:39.337 --> 02:05:43.817
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

02:05:44.018 --> 02:05:49.935
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

02:05:50.136 --> 02:05:52.953
I sold one of My ornaments

02:05:53.154 --> 02:05:57.849
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

02:05:58.049 --> 02:06:02.358
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

02:06:02.559 --> 02:06:13.303
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

02:06:13.930 --> 02:06:19.413
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

02:06:19.627 --> 02:06:25.069
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

02:06:26.357 --> 02:06:34.492
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

02:06:36.799 --> 02:06:40.013
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
but I am missing him

02:06:40.214 --> 02:06:45.518
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

02:06:45.719 --> 02:06:48.198
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

02:06:48.399 --> 02:06:54.022
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

02:06:54.223 --> 02:07:00.200
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

02:07:00.401 --> 02:07:04.912
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

02:07:05.113 --> 02:07:11.364
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

02:07:13.765 --> 02:07:17.437
These small, small things can give you
great joy

02:07:17.638 --> 02:07:23.518
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

02:07:23.719 --> 02:07:28.301
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

02:07:28.502 --> 02:07:30.783
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

02:07:30.984 --> 02:07:35.101
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

02:07:35.302 --> 02:07:39.444
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

02:07:39.645 --> 02:07:42.919
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:50.303
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

02:07:50.504 --> 02:07:54.233
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

02:07:54.434 --> 02:07:57.137
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

02:07:57.338 --> 02:08:02.009
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

02:08:02.210 --> 02:08:06.939
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:12.492
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

02:08:12.693 --> 02:08:16.854
I don’t even have time to see them.

02:08:17.761 --> 02:08:24.410
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

02:08:24.632 --> 02:08:28.337
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

02:08:28.538 --> 02:08:32.519
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

02:08:32.728 --> 02:08:37.105
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

02:08:37.306 --> 02:08:43.407
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

02:08:43.608 --> 02:08:48.281
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

02:08:48.482 --> 02:08:55.680
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

02:08:56.571 --> 02:09:00.328
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

02:09:00.529 --> 02:09:08.472
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

02:09:08.862 --> 02:09:14.375
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

02:09:14.576 --> 02:09:22.240
being absolutely beyond any problem.

02:09:22.543 --> 02:09:28.126
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

02:09:28.327 --> 02:09:34.133
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

02:09:34.334 --> 02:09:38.041
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

02:09:38.242 --> 02:09:42.963
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

02:09:43.164 --> 02:09:49.419
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

02:09:50.537 --> 02:09:55.364
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

02:09:55.565 --> 02:09:59.767
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

02:09:59.968 --> 02:10:03.106
Only the designers they make the money.

02:10:03.306 --> 02:10:08.170
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

02:10:09.721 --> 02:10:17.593
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

02:10:18.841 --> 02:10:21.447
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

02:10:21.648 --> 02:10:26.741
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

02:10:26.942 --> 02:10:32.172
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

02:10:33.252 --> 02:10:40.268
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

02:10:41.715 --> 02:10:45.726
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

02:10:45.927 --> 02:10:49.918
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

02:10:50.119 --> 02:10:55.109
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

02:10:55.317 --> 02:10:59.079
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:05.504
So, I went to one shop in America

02:11:05.705 --> 02:11:08.689
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

02:11:08.890 --> 02:11:13.467
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

02:11:13.668 --> 02:11:20.204
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:24.918
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:35.075
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

02:11:35.276 --> 02:11:43.784
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

02:11:43.985 --> 02:11:48.642
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

02:11:48.843 --> 02:11:53.472
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

02:11:54.107 --> 02:11:58.527
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

02:11:59.113 --> 02:12:02.259
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:06.225
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

02:12:06.511 --> 02:12:10.506
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

02:12:10.707 --> 02:12:14.652
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

02:12:15.319 --> 02:12:19.481
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

02:12:19.682 --> 02:12:23.202
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

02:12:23.403 --> 02:12:27.768
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

02:12:27.969 --> 02:12:34.132
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

02:12:34.333 --> 02:12:39.003
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

02:12:39.204 --> 02:12:44.276
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

02:12:44.477 --> 02:12:48.964
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

02:12:49.165 --> 02:12:51.885
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

02:12:52.094 --> 02:13:00.748
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

02:13:03.181 --> 02:13:08.979
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

02:13:09.203 --> 02:13:12.437
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

02:13:12.638 --> 02:13:16.583
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

02:13:16.784 --> 02:13:21.197
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

02:13:21.398 --> 02:13:28.236
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

02:13:28.437 --> 02:13:34.666
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

02:13:35.432 --> 02:13:40.837
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

02:13:41.038 --> 02:13:50.592
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

02:13:50.793 --> 02:13:55.358
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

02:13:55.559 --> 02:14:00.272
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

02:14:00.473 --> 02:14:04.444
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

02:14:04.658 --> 02:14:07.401
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

02:14:07.569 --> 02:14:10.690
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

02:14:10.891 --> 02:14:14.671
if they can get the same dinner set.

02:14:14.872 --> 02:14:19.294
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

02:14:19.495 --> 02:14:29.056
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

02:14:29.257 --> 02:14:33.108
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

02:14:33.309 --> 02:14:37.344
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

02:14:37.545 --> 02:14:41.330
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

02:14:41.531 --> 02:14:48.926
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:51.915
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

02:14:52.145 --> 02:14:54.948
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

02:14:55.149 --> 02:15:02.112
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

02:15:02.313 --> 02:15:08.234
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

02:15:08.956 --> 02:15:14.502
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

02:15:15.119 --> 02:15:21.223
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

02:15:23.550 --> 02:15:26.911
Just there you get it.

02:15:27.865 --> 02:15:33.345
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

02:15:33.555 --> 02:15:38.027
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

02:15:38.228 --> 02:15:41.744
if you don’t have greed about it.

02:15:41.951 --> 02:15:47.733
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

02:15:47.934 --> 02:15:54.439
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

02:15:54.640 --> 02:16:00.597
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

02:16:00.798 --> 02:16:06.891
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

02:16:07.550 --> 02:16:14.805
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

02:16:15.177 --> 02:16:18.646
And then the thing also gets lost.

02:16:18.847 --> 02:16:26.094
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

02:16:26.432 --> 02:16:31.457
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

02:16:32.710 --> 02:16:36.421
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

02:16:36.622 --> 02:16:42.594
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

02:16:42.795 --> 02:16:48.394
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

02:16:48.595 --> 02:16:53.694
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

02:16:56.175 --> 02:17:05.541
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

02:17:11.603 --> 02:17:17.266
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

02:17:18.731 --> 02:17:24.583
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

02:17:24.784 --> 02:17:29.404
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

02:17:29.605 --> 02:17:36.407
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

02:17:38.049 --> 02:17:43.374
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

02:17:44.258 --> 02:17:46.847
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

02:17:47.048 --> 02:17:50.946
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

02:17:54.252 --> 02:17:58.747
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

02:18:04.927 --> 02:18:08.273
They are mostly from Russia.

02:18:09.985 --> 02:18:18.726
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

02:18:18.927 --> 02:18:23.971
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

02:18:24.172 --> 02:18:29.595
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

02:18:29.796 --> 02:18:33.679
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:39.028
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

02:18:39.606 --> 02:18:43.734
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

02:18:43.935 --> 02:18:49.250
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

02:18:49.451 --> 02:18:53.385
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

02:18:53.586 --> 02:18:57.823
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

02:18:58.031 --> 02:19:03.266
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

02:19:04.442 --> 02:19:10.594
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

02:19:10.795 --> 02:19:15.828
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

02:19:16.029 --> 02:19:18.925
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

02:19:19.126 --> 02:19:22.775
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

02:19:22.976 --> 02:19:28.285
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

02:19:28.486 --> 02:19:34.096
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

02:19:34.297 --> 02:19:41.102
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

02:19:41.303 --> 02:19:47.307
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

02:19:48.101 --> 02:19:52.694
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

02:19:52.895 --> 02:19:58.708
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:03.960
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

02:20:04.161 --> 02:20:08.131
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

02:20:08.332 --> 02:20:13.985
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

02:20:15.722 --> 02:20:25.561
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

02:20:25.762 --> 02:20:30.647
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

02:20:30.848 --> 02:20:37.946
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

02:20:39.277 --> 02:20:44.604
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

02:20:44.805 --> 02:20:50.835
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

02:20:51.477 --> 02:20:56.527
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

02:20:56.728 --> 02:21:02.733
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

02:21:02.934 --> 02:21:08.070
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

02:21:08.271 --> 02:21:12.959
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:17.597
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

02:21:17.798 --> 02:21:23.578
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

02:21:23.779 --> 02:21:29.192
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

02:21:29.393 --> 02:21:36.430
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:44.921
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

02:21:49.739 --> 02:21:57.294
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

02:21:57.495 --> 02:22:01.829
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

02:22:02.774 --> 02:22:07.913
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

02:22:08.114 --> 02:22:11.362
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

02:22:11.563 --> 02:22:14.742
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

02:22:14.943 --> 02:22:21.047
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

02:22:21.248 --> 02:22:24.368
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

02:22:24.569 --> 02:22:28.201
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

02:22:28.402 --> 02:22:32.148
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

02:22:32.349 --> 02:22:40.397
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

02:22:40.598 --> 02:22:45.005
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

02:22:45.206 --> 02:22:52.667
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

02:22:52.868 --> 02:22:57.824
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

02:22:58.025 --> 02:23:00.711
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

02:23:00.925 --> 02:23:04.857
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

02:23:05.058 --> 02:23:08.865
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

02:23:09.066 --> 02:23:11.531
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

02:23:11.732 --> 02:23:18.216
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

02:23:18.417 --> 02:23:25.550
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

02:23:25.751 --> 02:23:32.753
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

02:23:32.954 --> 02:23:36.379
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:41.370
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

02:23:41.532 --> 02:23:45.620
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

02:23:45.821 --> 02:23:51.649
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

02:23:51.850 --> 02:23:57.305
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

02:23:57.530 --> 02:24:01.234
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

02:24:01.435 --> 02:24:07.569
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

02:24:07.770 --> 02:24:12.825
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

02:24:13.026 --> 02:24:17.315
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

02:24:17.516 --> 02:24:21.760
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

02:24:21.961 --> 02:24:29.419
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

02:24:29.620 --> 02:24:33.390
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

02:24:33.591 --> 02:24:38.304
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

02:24:38.505 --> 02:24:41.248
that we have got the Spirit within us.

02:24:41.449 --> 02:24:46.979
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:50.670
You are people who are all realized souls.

02:24:50.871 --> 02:24:55.740
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

02:24:55.941 --> 02:25:00.312
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

02:25:00.513 --> 02:25:08.129
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

02:25:08.330 --> 02:25:12.236
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

02:25:12.436 --> 02:25:19.427
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

02:25:19.628 --> 02:25:24.291
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

02:25:24.492 --> 02:25:29.575
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

02:25:29.776 --> 02:25:32.980
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

02:25:33.181 --> 02:25:40.218
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

02:25:41.224 --> 02:25:44.829
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:47.070
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

02:25:47.271 --> 02:25:51.761
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

02:25:51.962 --> 02:25:58.109
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

02:25:58.310 --> 02:26:05.319
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

02:26:05.652 --> 02:26:11.831
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

02:26:12.032 --> 02:26:17.027
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

02:26:17.228 --> 02:26:23.360
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

02:26:23.561 --> 02:26:27.990
it is absolutely a hell for man.

02:26:29.316 --> 02:26:35.237
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

02:26:35.438 --> 02:26:41.427
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

02:26:41.628 --> 02:26:46.499
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

02:26:46.644 --> 02:26:49.985
What pleases the husband?

02:26:51.497 --> 02:26:54.884
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

02:26:55.085 --> 02:27:00.779
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:05.843
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

02:27:06.044 --> 02:27:09.704
First of all find out what he likes.

02:27:11.432 --> 02:27:14.399
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.465
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

02:27:17.666 --> 02:27:22.208
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

02:27:22.409 --> 02:27:27.904
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

02:27:28.105 --> 02:27:33.776
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

02:27:33.977 --> 02:27:37.332
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

02:27:37.533 --> 02:27:40.961
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

02:27:41.162 --> 02:27:48.044
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

02:27:48.245 --> 02:27:51.734
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

02:27:51.911 --> 02:27:56.022
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

02:27:56.223 --> 02:28:00.797
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

02:28:00.998 --> 02:28:04.430
because women are responsible
for the society.

02:28:04.631 --> 02:28:10.909
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:15.725
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

02:28:15.926 --> 02:28:21.401
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

02:28:21.602 --> 02:28:26.021
But your job is to make the society.

02:28:26.222 --> 02:28:30.781
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

02:28:30.982 --> 02:28:35.365
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

02:28:35.566 --> 02:28:40.998
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

02:28:41.199 --> 02:28:43.802
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

02:28:44.003 --> 02:28:52.862
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

02:28:53.719 --> 02:28:59.415
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

02:29:01.125 --> 02:29:07.524
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

02:29:07.725 --> 02:29:13.312
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

02:29:13.513 --> 02:29:16.488
But there was one gentleman, good one,

02:29:16.689 --> 02:29:20.659
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:24.710
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

02:29:24.911 --> 02:29:31.806
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:35.543
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

02:29:35.744 --> 02:29:38.568
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

02:29:38.769 --> 02:29:45.596
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

02:29:45.797 --> 02:29:49.994
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

02:29:50.195 --> 02:29:55.568
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

02:29:55.769 --> 02:30:00.275
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

02:30:00.476 --> 02:30:05.074
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

02:30:05.275 --> 02:30:10.028
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

02:30:10.229 --> 02:30:14.154
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

02:30:14.355 --> 02:30:18.220
Immediately this competition.

02:30:23.655 --> 02:30:26.756
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

02:30:26.957 --> 02:30:29.922
even in London he was helping him a lot.

02:30:30.123 --> 02:30:36.074
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

02:30:36.275 --> 02:30:40.776
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

02:30:42.583 --> 02:30:46.479
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:50.160
Otherwise for small, small things,

02:30:50.361 --> 02:30:54.944
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

02:30:55.145 --> 02:31:01.577
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

02:31:03.022 --> 02:31:07.799
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.741
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

02:31:12.942 --> 02:31:18.482
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

02:31:18.683 --> 02:31:24.318
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

02:31:24.519 --> 02:31:26.890
[Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

02:31:27.091 --> 02:31:31.666
she was married to somebody in USA.

02:31:31.867 --> 02:31:39.221
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

02:31:39.422 --> 02:31:42.899
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

02:31:43.100 --> 02:31:50.165
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

02:31:50.366 --> 02:31:56.697
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

02:31:56.898 --> 02:32:02.337
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

02:32:02.538 --> 02:32:07.923
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

02:32:08.124 --> 02:32:11.835
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

02:32:12.036 --> 02:32:17.110
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

02:32:17.311 --> 02:32:20.877
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

02:32:21.061 --> 02:32:27.595
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

02:32:27.796 --> 02:32:31.735
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

02:32:32.668 --> 02:32:42.301
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

02:32:42.502 --> 02:32:45.430
Why has he married?

02:32:45.631 --> 02:32:52.616
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

02:32:56.215 --> 02:32:58.607
It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

02:32:58.808 --> 02:33:03.776
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

02:33:03.977 --> 02:33:07.227
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

02:33:07.428 --> 02:33:12.339
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

02:33:12.540 --> 02:33:16.831
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

02:33:17.313 --> 02:33:22.857
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

02:33:23.024 --> 02:33:28.095
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

02:33:28.296 --> 02:33:31.440
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

02:33:31.641 --> 02:33:35.574
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

02:33:35.775 --> 02:33:42.161
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

02:33:42.362 --> 02:33:47.785
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

02:33:47.986 --> 02:33:52.281
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

02:33:53.442 --> 02:33:58.790
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

02:33:58.967 --> 02:34:02.950
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

02:34:03.151 --> 02:34:10.484
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

02:34:12.623 --> 02:34:16.613
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

02:34:16.814 --> 02:34:19.486
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

02:34:19.687 --> 02:34:22.504
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

02:34:22.705 --> 02:34:28.041
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:36.209
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

02:34:36.410 --> 02:34:41.270
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

02:34:45.481 --> 02:34:48.619
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:52.567
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

02:34:52.768 --> 02:34:57.064
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

02:34:57.265 --> 02:35:02.498
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

02:35:04.136 --> 02:35:07.529
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

02:35:07.730 --> 02:35:11.211
try to understand why she does it.

02:35:11.412 --> 02:35:16.216
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

02:35:16.417 --> 02:35:22.004
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

02:35:22.205 --> 02:35:27.117
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

02:35:27.318 --> 02:35:32.798
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

02:35:32.999 --> 02:35:38.978
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

02:35:39.179 --> 02:35:43.431
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

02:35:43.632 --> 02:35:47.590
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

02:35:47.791 --> 02:35:52.245
and he is not there and this and that.”

02:35:52.561 --> 02:35:55.902
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

02:35:56.103 --> 02:36:01.508
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

02:36:01.709 --> 02:36:05.737
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

02:36:05.938 --> 02:36:08.728
I can’t understand the logic.

02:36:08.929 --> 02:36:13.426
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

02:36:13.627 --> 02:36:19.138
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

02:36:19.804 --> 02:36:28.408
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

02:36:28.609 --> 02:36:34.758
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

02:36:36.365 --> 02:36:38.951
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

02:36:39.152 --> 02:36:43.967
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

02:36:44.168 --> 02:36:49.516
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

02:36:49.717 --> 02:36:54.261
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

02:36:54.462 --> 02:36:59.726
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

02:36:59.927 --> 02:37:04.090
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

02:37:04.291 --> 02:37:07.546
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

02:37:08.197 --> 02:37:14.200
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

02:37:14.401 --> 02:37:18.031
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

02:37:18.232 --> 02:37:23.301
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

02:37:23.486 --> 02:37:27.270
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

02:37:27.471 --> 02:37:30.078
So, with such an ignorance of things,

02:37:30.279 --> 02:37:35.194
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

02:37:36.714 --> 02:37:44.051
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

02:37:44.252 --> 02:37:48.832
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:57.268
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

02:37:57.531 --> 02:38:00.380
He buys always very expensive things.

02:38:00.581 --> 02:38:04.816
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

02:38:05.017 --> 02:38:10.068
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

02:38:10.269 --> 02:38:15.651
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

02:38:15.852 --> 02:38:20.794
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

02:38:20.995 --> 02:38:26.099
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:32.063
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

02:38:32.264 --> 02:38:36.414
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

02:38:36.591 --> 02:38:40.233
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

02:38:40.434 --> 02:38:44.156
but he likes to give that only – all right.

02:38:44.357 --> 02:38:49.012
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

02:38:49.213 --> 02:38:53.166
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

02:38:53.367 --> 02:38:58.987
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

02:38:59.188 --> 02:39:04.020
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

02:39:04.221 --> 02:39:10.888
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

02:39:11.089 --> 02:39:17.626
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

02:39:17.827 --> 02:39:20.760
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

02:39:20.961 --> 02:39:25.630
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

02:39:25.831 --> 02:39:29.405
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

02:39:29.606 --> 02:39:33.515
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

02:39:33.716 --> 02:39:36.767
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

02:39:36.968 --> 02:39:40.339
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

02:39:40.540 --> 02:39:46.321
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

02:39:46.522 --> 02:39:51.693
[Hindi aside]

02:39:51.903 --> 02:39:55.133
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

02:39:55.347 --> 02:39:59.269
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

02:39:59.470 --> 02:40:03.361
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

02:40:03.562 --> 02:40:07.883
I was walking like a giant, you know.

02:40:14.112 --> 02:40:18.435
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

02:40:18.636 --> 02:40:22.671
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

02:40:22.872 --> 02:40:25.948
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

02:40:26.149 --> 02:40:30.380
I sat in one place glued down into that.

02:40:30.581 --> 02:40:35.840
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

02:40:36.041 --> 02:40:41.552
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

02:40:41.753 --> 02:40:45.140
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

02:40:45.341 --> 02:40:49.274
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

02:40:49.475 --> 02:40:55.370
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

02:40:56.124 --> 02:40:58.648
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

02:40:58.813 --> 02:41:03.694
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

02:41:03.895 --> 02:41:06.578
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

02:41:06.779 --> 02:41:13.107
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

02:41:13.331 --> 02:41:19.860
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

02:41:20.061 --> 02:41:24.934
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

02:41:25.135 --> 02:41:28.374
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

02:41:28.575 --> 02:41:31.672
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

02:41:31.872 --> 02:41:37.364
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

02:41:37.565 --> 02:41:40.510
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

02:41:40.711 --> 02:41:44.198
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

02:41:44.399 --> 02:41:49.355
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

02:41:52.351 --> 02:41:54.543
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

02:41:54.744 --> 02:41:57.488
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

02:41:57.689 --> 02:42:02.804
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

02:42:03.005 --> 02:42:05.704
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

02:42:05.905 --> 02:42:11.856
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

02:42:12.057 --> 02:42:16.742
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

02:42:16.943 --> 02:42:22.580
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

02:42:22.766 --> 02:42:24.378
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

02:42:24.579 --> 02:42:27.668
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

02:42:27.869 --> 02:42:31.639
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:36.046
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

02:42:36.247 --> 02:42:40.824
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

02:42:41.025 --> 02:42:45.955
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

02:42:48.109 --> 02:42:52.384
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

02:42:52.569 --> 02:42:58.517
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

02:42:58.718 --> 02:43:02.653
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

02:43:02.854 --> 02:43:08.841
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

02:43:09.042 --> 02:43:11.427
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

02:43:11.628 --> 02:43:16.308
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

02:43:16.483 --> 02:43:20.673
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

02:43:20.873 --> 02:43:23.778
You are not going to beat (them).

02:43:24.856 --> 02:43:30.095
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

02:43:30.296 --> 02:43:33.223
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

02:43:33.424 --> 02:43:37.197
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

02:43:37.398 --> 02:43:41.207
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

02:43:41.408 --> 02:43:45.066
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

02:43:45.267 --> 02:43:49.990
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

02:43:50.191 --> 02:43:57.208
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

02:43:57.409 --> 02:44:01.883
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

02:44:02.091 --> 02:44:10.333
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

02:44:10.534 --> 02:44:15.914
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

02:44:16.115 --> 02:44:22.537
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

02:44:22.744 --> 02:44:26.227
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

02:44:26.428 --> 02:44:28.994
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

02:44:29.195 --> 02:44:34.268
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:37.012
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

02:44:37.213 --> 02:44:42.417
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

02:44:42.618 --> 02:44:49.228
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:52.250
In India no woman will do that.

02:44:52.451 --> 02:44:56.810
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:08.438
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

02:45:08.639 --> 02:45:11.871
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

02:45:12.072 --> 02:45:16.261
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

02:45:16.462 --> 02:45:19.360
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

02:45:19.561 --> 02:45:25.846
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

02:45:26.047 --> 02:45:29.438
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

02:45:29.639 --> 02:45:32.459
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

02:45:32.660 --> 02:45:36.520
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

02:45:36.721 --> 02:45:40.531
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

02:45:40.732 --> 02:45:47.877
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

02:45:48.078 --> 02:45:52.131
But this Western women never understand.

02:45:52.332 --> 02:45:58.346
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

02:45:58.546 --> 02:46:03.997
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

02:46:04.198 --> 02:46:07.709
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:12.021
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

02:46:12.222 --> 02:46:16.876
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

02:46:17.077 --> 02:46:22.277
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

02:46:22.478 --> 02:46:30.858
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

02:46:31.059 --> 02:46:38.492
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

02:46:38.693 --> 02:46:41.906
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

02:46:42.107 --> 02:46:47.914
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

02:46:48.115 --> 02:46:50.768
This is very Western, I must say.

02:46:50.969 --> 02:46:57.808
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

02:46:58.086 --> 02:47:03.705
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

02:47:03.906 --> 02:47:07.677
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

02:47:07.878 --> 02:47:11.957
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

02:47:12.158 --> 02:47:15.690
This is not the way a woman should look.

02:47:15.891 --> 02:47:20.601
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

02:47:20.802 --> 02:47:27.028
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

02:47:27.229 --> 02:47:34.742
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

02:47:34.943 --> 02:47:39.572
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

02:47:39.773 --> 02:47:43.893
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

02:47:44.094 --> 02:47:47.138
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

02:47:47.339 --> 02:47:57.542
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

02:47:57.743 --> 02:48:05.348
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

02:48:09.751 --> 02:48:14.954
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

02:48:15.139 --> 02:48:17.566
Who are you to like or not like?

02:48:17.767 --> 02:48:22.704
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

02:48:22.905 --> 02:48:29.095
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

02:48:29.304 --> 02:48:37.099
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:41.885
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

02:48:42.086 --> 02:48:46.595
and should have very, very large hearts.

02:48:50.195 --> 02:48:58.806
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

02:48:59.007 --> 02:49:02.211
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

02:49:02.412 --> 02:49:08.226
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

02:49:10.743 --> 02:49:15.924
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

02:49:16.125 --> 02:49:23.138
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

02:49:23.339 --> 02:49:28.195
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

02:49:28.396 --> 02:49:31.502
very, very good reports about them.

02:49:31.703 --> 02:49:36.606
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

02:49:36.807 --> 02:49:39.966
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

02:49:40.167 --> 02:49:46.138
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

02:49:46.339 --> 02:49:53.937
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

02:49:54.138 --> 02:49:56.989
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

02:49:57.190 --> 02:50:00.755
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

02:50:01.323 --> 02:50:04.038
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

02:50:04.239 --> 02:50:07.925
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

02:50:08.126 --> 02:50:12.917
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

02:50:13.118 --> 02:50:16.865
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

02:50:17.066 --> 02:50:21.335
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

02:50:21.536 --> 02:50:24.766
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

02:50:24.967 --> 02:50:29.367
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

02:50:29.599 --> 02:50:35.880
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

02:50:36.050 --> 02:50:39.194
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

02:50:39.395 --> 02:50:44.900
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

02:50:45.101 --> 02:50:47.621
thanks to Swiss influence.

02:50:47.822 --> 02:50:52.796
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

02:50:53.003 --> 02:50:58.480
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

02:50:58.681 --> 02:51:03.263
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

02:51:08.501 --> 02:51:12.516
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

02:51:12.717 --> 02:51:18.042
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

02:51:18.243 --> 02:51:25.144
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

02:51:26.460 --> 02:51:29.622
This is the book. You all should buy it.

02:51:29.823 --> 02:51:33.237
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

02:51:33.438 --> 02:51:36.756
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

02:51:59.176 --> 02:52:02.442
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

02:52:02.643 --> 02:52:06.223
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

02:52:06.424 --> 02:52:11.273
So, you will understand about Indian music.

02:52:11.474 --> 02:52:17.672
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

02:52:18.106 --> 02:52:24.987
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

02:52:25.188 --> 02:52:31.439
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:36.376
who were singing western song, was alright.

02:52:36.577 --> 02:52:41.711
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

02:52:41.912 --> 02:52:45.154
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

02:52:45.355 --> 02:52:48.952
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

02:52:49.153 --> 02:52:53.221
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

02:52:53.422 --> 02:52:56.869
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

02:52:57.070 --> 02:53:01.310
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

02:53:01.511 --> 02:53:05.620
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

02:53:05.797 --> 02:53:11.318
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

02:53:11.519 --> 02:53:19.381
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

02:53:19.582 --> 02:53:23.218
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

02:53:23.419 --> 02:53:29.818
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

02:53:30.019 --> 02:53:34.188
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:36.947
They are having all this horrible music
there.

02:53:37.148 --> 02:53:42.568
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

02:53:42.769 --> 02:53:46.954
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

02:53:47.135 --> 02:53:54.277
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

02:53:54.445 --> 02:53:58.784
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

02:53:58.985 --> 02:54:02.884
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

02:54:03.085 --> 02:54:05.715
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

02:54:05.916 --> 02:54:10.873
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

02:54:11.073 --> 02:54:15.854
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

02:54:16.079 --> 02:54:19.514
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:24.209
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

02:54:24.410 --> 02:54:34.086
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

02:54:34.287 --> 02:54:40.731
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

02:54:40.932 --> 02:54:51.760
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

02:54:51.961 --> 02:54:56.507
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

02:54:56.708 --> 02:55:02.694
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

02:55:02.894 --> 02:55:04.835
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

02:55:05.036 --> 02:55:08.945
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

02:55:09.146 --> 02:55:13.319
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:16.964
you will see how different it will be.

02:55:19.101 --> 02:55:22.685
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

02:55:22.886 --> 02:55:25.530
which you should have, and which you should
understand

02:55:25.731 --> 02:55:34.966
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

02:55:35.167 --> 02:55:41.464
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

02:55:41.665 --> 02:55:46.902
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

02:55:47.063 --> 02:55:53.106
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

02:55:54.555 --> 02:55:58.184
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

02:55:58.385 --> 02:56:02.367
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

02:56:02.568 --> 02:56:07.962
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

02:56:08.163 --> 02:56:10.911
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

02:56:11.112 --> 02:56:14.804
Then you can expand it as you like.

02:56:15.005 --> 02:56:21.129
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

02:56:21.330 --> 02:56:25.594
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

02:56:25.795 --> 02:56:32.073
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

02:56:32.361 --> 02:56:38.925
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

02:56:39.457 --> 02:56:41.796
Accha.

02:56:41.997 --> 02:56:46.764
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

02:56:46.965 --> 02:56:53.338
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

02:56:53.539 --> 02:57:03.260
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

02:57:03.687 --> 02:57:11.823
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

02:57:15.861 --> 02:57:20.764
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

02:57:20.965 --> 02:57:28.054
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

02:57:28.255 --> 02:57:36.504
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

02:57:36.705 --> 02:57:43.441
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

02:57:43.642 --> 02:57:51.962
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

02:57:52.163 --> 02:58:00.229
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

02:58:00.430 --> 02:58:05.337
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

02:58:05.512 --> 02:58:09.628
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

02:58:09.829 --> 02:58:16.453
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

02:58:16.654 --> 02:58:22.010
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

02:58:22.383 --> 02:58:29.182
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

02:58:29.383 --> 02:58:36.959
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:43.665
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

02:58:43.866 --> 02:58:49.655
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

02:58:49.856 --> 02:58:53.162
Because when you try to do something wrong

02:58:53.363 --> 02:58:57.459
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

02:59:00.141 --> 02:59:04.428
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

02:59:04.629 --> 02:59:10.513
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

02:59:10.714 --> 02:59:16.578
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

02:59:16.779 --> 02:59:20.435
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

02:59:20.636 --> 02:59:25.497
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

02:59:25.698 --> 02:59:29.882
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

02:59:30.083 --> 02:59:35.021
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

02:59:35.222 --> 02:59:38.662
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

02:59:38.863 --> 02:59:42.350
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

02:59:42.551 --> 02:59:48.116
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

02:59:49.890 --> 02:59:55.964
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

02:59:56.165 --> 03:00:00.509
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

03:00:00.709 --> 03:00:04.416
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

03:00:04.617 --> 03:00:09.700
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

03:00:09.901 --> 03:00:14.484
than father, mother, even Mataji.

03:00:15.785 --> 03:00:20.714
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

03:00:21.654 --> 03:00:23.927
So, thank you very much.
