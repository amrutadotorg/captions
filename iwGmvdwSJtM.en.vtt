00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.880
With Sahaja Yoga,
you can do many many things,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.280
but you must know what you can do.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:28.000
For that, Krishna is a
very good example.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.560
He started Sahaj culture.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.400
Culture, I’m saying.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:43.760
He didn’t give Realization to anyone,
but he gave the idea of Sahaj culture.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.080
Now, what’s the meaning of the
Sahaj culture?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:54.240
It’s culture, is something that is,
you are groomed,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.840
you are brought up in a very
natural manner,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.960
that you develop a culture.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:16.080
It’s more like a child-like,
simple innocent behaviour.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:27.240
It is Shri Krishna’s introduction
of idea of pure joy, ‘Nirmal Ananda’,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.120
which came as a great relief
to Indian people

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:47.360
because they were following
Shri Ramachandra.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.120
I asked somebody, “What about your
bathing, why didn’t you take bath?”

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.120
He said, “These days it is
out of fashion to take bath.”

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880
[Laughter]

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.640
Everything seems to be out of fashion,
whatever is in fashion is horrid.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.200
“It’s very fashionable,” is another thing
people say, “it’s very fashionable,”

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.440
and whatever is fashionable
looks so ugly to Me.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.240
Now if you have to take
to the Sahaj culture,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.480
you have to know that we have to have
a discipline in our life.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.800
We have to have education,
we have to have a place,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.440
we have to have a position
in the society.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.160
Because we are not sitting
in the Himalayas,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:39.840
somewhere lost in the Himalayas
sitting there and just doing our tapasya.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.240
Tapasya is here where you live.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.920
Otherwise if you say that, “All right,
we have to go to Himalayas

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.840
and there we have to do Tapasya
in the cold winds.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.040
Oh, that’s very good.”

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.880
Because that looks like something,
you see, you’ll have –

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.720
might have a name,
or something like that.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.520
But tapasya is here,
the detachment has to be worked out here.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.440
You get involved into all these things,
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.800
the amount of involvement you have
in the things which existed

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.200
in gross form,
they have become subtler

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.920
and you are still bound by them,
there’s no freedom.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.200
And that’s why when you see
something absurd happening,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.000
you see something funny happening
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.480
it’s just the symptom of that thing
becoming subtler within us

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.840
and is expressing itself.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.280
Like sometimes you may not see fire
but it exists

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.360
and suddenly you find a blast.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.360
So, transformation of course
means evolution,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.040
it also means that whatever basis
you had, you have to evolve out of it.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.920
Like a flower blossoming
and then becoming the fruit,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.760
but it has to drop out many things.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.313
And then with the nature one has to see
– such a unison.

00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:44.371
In the nature if you see,
it sucks the water.

00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:46.880
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:56.240
Then it becomes a cloud
and then the cloud waits,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.640
because the leaves drop out.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.760
In the winter time, they nourish the tree
with their nitrogen;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.640
when the time is ready,
then these clouds pour down

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.280
and again nourish this.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.640
Such a complete balance
is in the nature.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.640
If it was not, I tell you they would,
we would have said,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:32.080
“all bald-headed lands here.”

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.800
On the contrary, everybody was
harsh on him.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.000
They were passing remarks at him,
doing things like that.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.560
Because we have to have compassion.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.160
Now Mother has said,
“We have to have compassion,”

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.640
well now where do we have
our compassion?

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.600
On the walls?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.240
Where do we use our compassion?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.440
Where do we use our compassion?

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.040
So “Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced,”
doesn’t mean that you sit down

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.880
with my photograph all the time,
doesn’t mean that.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:12.000
It means you practice compassion;
you practice that.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.160
Then you have to practice love.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.200
Now how do you practice love
with others?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.080
If you love someone, what do you do?

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.240
You try to please that person.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.760
Small things can make people very happy.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.840
I know, you all try to please me
very much.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.360
You’ll give me presents.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.840
You’ll find out things
which are good for me.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.040
You’ll go out of the way
buy sweet flowers for me,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.960
beautiful things you do to please me.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.520
I am over-pleased,
I must tell you.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.800
But I am more pleased,
much more pleased

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.400
if you understand collectivity
and try to please each other.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.280
Such a person pleases me the most,
that the attention is more

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.000
on pleasing each other.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.560
As soon as you decide
you have to please others,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.760
your tongue will become different.
It will become a sweet thing.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.200
The tongue which was like
a pair of scissors

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.520
becomes such a beautiful thing of honey.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.080
Then you talk little
but you really pour honey

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.280
on another person,
and another person really enjoys it.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.600
So now to practice love:
where do you practice?

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.960
Ask yourself a question,
“Where do I practice love?

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.640
What do I love?”

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.800
We love our house, we love
our photographs, our decorations,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.960
everything, “But do I practice
this love on my wife,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:57.920
or on my husband,
or on other Sahaja yogis?”

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.640
In our Sahaj culture,
we have to practice compassion

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:12.240
and love, and thirdly
we have to practice patience.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.400
I know some children are maybe
little more mischievous,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.960
some are less mischievous.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.520
Maybe some people are very talkative,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.960
sometimes really they give me
also headache;

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.120
they go on talking, talking,
talking, talking, so much!

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.360
Sometimes I think it’s good
because it’s a rest for my mouth –

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.520
one way of looking at it.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.920
Another way of looking at it is –
just switch off your mind,

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.480
let him talk,
take it out whatever he wants to do.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.360
Once he is finished with it
and fagged out

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.880
then he won’t bother you much
and also he’ll feel satisfied

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.640
that somebody has listened
to his prattles.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.680
So, patience is needed
and patience is needed

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.320
in such a way that others
should see your patience.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.320
Yesterday for example,
I was sitting for about

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.760
I think three hours
shaking hands with all sorts of people

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.720
and all types of problems,
and the person who came last,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:27.440
he said, “Looking at your patience,
I developed my own patience.”

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.640
And love gives you patience.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.520
This love nourishes you.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.400
I’m telling you, it’s absolutely
down-to-earth method:

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.200
here I’ve not mentioned
that you trust God,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.200
I’m just saying trust yourself.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:52.000
[It’s] absolutely down-to-earth
because we are talking about your brain.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.040
Now we have been saying that
we have to forgive everyone,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.440
but we don’t practice that.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.840
Small, small things
like mad people remember.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.160
I mean only I have heard
that a snake has this capacity

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.640
to remember if somebody has hurt him.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.640
But here I find human beings
have no less capacity.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.800
Whatever has happened
thirteen years back,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.920
fifteen years back, they all remember
each and every thing:

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.360
whatever has hurt them.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.280
But how they have hurt others
they don’t remember!

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.040
How they have been nasty to others
they don’t remember.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.640
Because this is a human mind
which has got the ego,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.480
it can go on hurting others,
it doesn’t feel anything,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.160
and the superego which goes on
receiving all the hurts

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.880
and always complaining about it.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:57.440
There must be 25-30% of people
who may not be on this line.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.000
Like I have seen I was travelling
by the taxi the driver asked me

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.200
if I had Marlborough cigarettes
or another fellow asked me

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.000
something like that.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.080
But they are very few people.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:18.240
And such people have to still evolve
to your level.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.560
But when there is vacuum
all kinds of things are sucked in.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:32.720
I feel there are many things
from the West are sucked in also

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:40.720
like drugs like this mad music
AIDs and other diseases

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:47.520
but the worst is the Freud’s ideas
of free love which are very much

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.240
malignant.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.680
I think the communist government
did not want to be bothered

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.760
about your morality at all.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:02.080
They wanted to enjoy their power
so they said do what you like,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.160
we don’t care as long as you
allow us to have the power.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.440
So this free love business
has gone too far also in Russia

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.880
and in Ukraine.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:21.520
But those who are on the Mahalakshmi
Principle have to know one thing

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:29.440
that morality is the basis
of your ascent.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.240
That is the strength of Shri Ganesha.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:46.000
If this strength is not manifested
one will never go up to a point

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.600
which is desired.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.800
So in our sahaj culture,
we have to understand

00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:01.200
that morality is extremely important
for Mahalakshmi principle.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:11.760
Because of the western culture just
coming into this vacuum is very dangerous

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.160
I have to tell you, again and again,
be careful.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:26.320
Many people who came to Sahaja yoga
not only in Russia have fallen off

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.680
because of their immoral attachments.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:37.280
But in a very sahaj manner,
you can be moral.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:43.280
You do not have to force yourself
or compel yourself

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:51.280
but spontaneously you will manifest
morality in your lifestyle.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.320
In India we have some immoral people
no doubt

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:05.280
but it is not their lifestyle
so some people may be immoral ?

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:13.760
They are[Inaudible] but they are not
the whole of the society.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.280
Moreover, the responsibility is more
on women who respect their chastity.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:27.200
If a woman is moral
then the children become moral

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:34.320
and the husband also comes to morality
but if the woman is immoral

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.600
then the whole society is finished.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.240
So the responsibility of keeping
the social balance in society

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.040
is entirely of women.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:57.200
It means you have to be alert as to see
that you do not deviate from the path

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:05.200
of balance of Mahalakshmi
into something that is destroying.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:15.520
All the prophets have created a sense
of balance, righteousness, of dharma.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:24.080
The reason is that they were
in the Void in the Bhavasagara.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:31.040
Moreover the more rigid is the religion,
like Catholic or Islamic,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.640
then people tend to be immoral because
they are suppressed

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:46.640
so they want to take out their oppression
in this way that they just go amok.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:56.360
So we should also understand
that the sense of morality is given to us

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.760
it’s already innately placed within us.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.600
Even if you see small girls
or small boys

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.680
they have a great sense of shame.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.840
This innate sense keeps the children
innocent and they do not like

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.600
things which are repulsive
or destructive spontaneously.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.200
But as you grow suddenly
this Mahalakshmi principle starts

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:35.120
moving away from the central path.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.480
And so deeply, when I walked out
of the room, they all came after Me.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.840
That you don’t see in western countries,
that kind of a thing.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.240
All of them walked after Me,
ran after Me,

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.520
they wanted to give their addresses
and they wanted Me to go to their country

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.840
and this and that.
I said: “All right, I’ll come!”

00:16:53.840 --> 00:17:00.480
We took their addresses,
even from Romania, everywhere.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.560
And they went back.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.960
And within 8 days
one could trigger out the thing.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:15.840
It worked, because they were so deep,
because they were so much equipped

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.080
to trigger the happening.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.720
That’s how they triggered their country
and how they worked it out.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.360
So, if we live on a superficial level
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.520
then we cannot do much for ourselves
nor for the country

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.080
and it’s just a wasteful life,
neither here nor there.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.880
Is like a seed, which is sprouted
and has not grown into the tree.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.440
So first of all we have to learn
that we have to become very deep people,

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.760
very deep, you must teach our depth.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.040
I’ve heard that people come to Pujas
and things

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.760
and their main interest is in food.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.120
As soon as the Puja is over
you just rush for food.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.320
How can you?

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.040
After Puja you get into a mood,
after meditation you get into a mood

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.480
of meditating nature
and you just sit down

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.520
and you can’t get up,
because you were fallen into the well

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.360
and sort of thing happens.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.320
How can you just get up and walk
for cakes or things.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.600
We though can’t think about.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.400
So then judge yourself, how you are,
how far you are.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.480
You have to work out your vibrations
because you are going to create

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:36.440
that beautiful vision in this country,
for your children, for yourself

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.760
and for the whole country,
ultimately for the whole world.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.400
But if you do not taordke it up
seriously, just by the way,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.680
Sahaja Yoga is just by the way,
it doesn’t work out.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.680
It has to be way of life.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.880
And in everything that you do
it has to be a Sahaj culture.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.920
And in Sahaj culture so many things
are to be understood

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.520
that this is natural, this is real
and we have to accept the way it is.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.600
So many things are happening the West,
which I think are just destructive,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.160
absolutely destructive to the society.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.360
The society is not at all looked after,
here.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:32.240
The highest personality can sacrifice
anything and can give up anything,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:40.400
but they cannot give up the feeling
they have for innocence.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.560
It’s very remarkable.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:51.600
We don’t realise how much there is
this ocean of protection and love

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.200
for the innocent.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:06.080
What attracts the greatest strength
is when we see an innocent person,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.520
innocent children, are under attack.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.480
That’s the beauty of human beings.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.960
Of course there are many human beings
who can be cruel,

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.760
who are, I would say,
I call them devils – maybe, maybe.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:31.760
But when it comes to children,
and to innocent people,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:38.960
everyone feels his responsibility.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.760
It’s difficult for normal human beings
to be innocent

00:20:45.760 --> 00:21:00.400
because they have a kind of an
understanding that they are something great,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:06.080
that they understand everything,
that they can analyse everything,

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.320
and they could be crooks,
they could be aggressive,

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:15.760
they could be troublesome,
they could be anything –

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.440
and they can give explanation for that,
doesn’t matter –

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:26.240
but still, on the whole,
they can never be respected

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:33.440
and they can never be honoured
for the thing they are doing.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:42.080
For us, the Sahaja Yogi, the Sahaj
culture is to respect your innocence.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:48.480
You might feel a little bit cheated,
you might feel a little bit dominated,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:56.320
you might feel a little bit disgraced,
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.280
Because with them lies the power
of Shri Ganesha.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:07.760
They should not feel dejected
if they are being used,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:15.520
insulted, tortured, dominated,
it’s alright.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:21.600
They should not try to destroy
the innocence of other people,

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.800
of anyone.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.360
Automatically it will work.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:36.160
You will be amazed that
when innocence is challenged,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:42.800
all the goodness of the world comes
to the rescue of that.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:50.560
An example of this is the recent war,
so-called war, of America.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.840
Where innocent people –
they had done nothing wrong –

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:01.600
have been tortured, have been killed.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:12.120
At that time, all over the world,
it’s a big support for them.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:20.000
Every country, whether it believes
in those people or not,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:30.240
is anxious to look after (for) those
who have done this crime.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.760
They may not be belonging
to the same religion,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.040
they may not be belonging
to the same country,

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.320
they may not be belonging
to the same crimes,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:48.080
but at this moment, who does not
take the side of the innocence

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:54.880
will be singled out and will be destroyed
– no doubt about it.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:03.600
Once and for all they will learn a lesson
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:13.600
So you see,it’s a kind of a great
collectivity of housewives

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.360
that has to work out.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:21.360
They have common problems,
they have to face their children,

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.720
they have to look after the household,
everything –

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:30.000
I mean there are so many common problems
with the housewives.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.360
And the housewife also knows
all little, little things.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.120
You see, men at least in India
don’t know much

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.880
because they live in the air, I think.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.280
So the women have more sense
in this respect,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.080
for small, small things
they are quite aware.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.360
It’s very interesting sometimes,
the men commit mistakes

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.440
of such a great humor.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.800
Because they do not deal with
day-to-day life,

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:13.760
with all the problems of daily life.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.840
On one side the woman, housewife,
has to deal with the daily life.

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:26.080
On the other side she has to look
after her family, her children.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:32.000
Also, poor thing, she is responsible
for the society.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.960
She has to maintain the society.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:41.120
In a country where women are sensible
and are matured,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.040
you will be amazed that they become
extremely good families,

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.680
good societies and good children.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:56.080
That’s why I must say, India is
a very good country of very good society.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:03.280
This is come out of the housewives,
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.680
who have done all the work
that is important

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.160
as far as the culture is concerned.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:19.600
This kind of thing is very much in India
and with that, what you find

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:27.120
that the people respect,
respect the housewives.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.080
So respecting the housewife is
the most important thing

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.280
in our Sahaj culture.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:41.760
But that doesn’t mean that the women
should try to dominate

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.320
and trouble and fight with the husbands.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:55.840
But it means a very important position
in the society, of a housewife.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:02.720
She is treated as a something a,
like a devi only.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.760
But she too has to be a devi.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:12.000
If you treat her like a doormat,
then children will never respect her.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.280
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,
the children won’t respect the mother

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.240
and there will be no impact
of the mother on the children.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:31.520
As a result the children get wayward,
and in the societies or in the countries

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:37.520
where the mother is not respected,
you will find the children become

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:46.880
extremely dominating, hot-tempered
and horribly uncollective.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:56.640
One should not try to look younger
and just all the time

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:03.600
make your life miserable by trying
to keep your husband attached to you

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:09.120
because by that you will lose your powers,
your Shakti,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.800
but if your husband is a man of character
then you must respect him

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:19.280
and support him in every way
and tolerate him as far as possible.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:24.000
Yesterday I saw many ladies
have cut their hair,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.640
please do not play into the hands
of these entrepreneurs,

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.480
they know how to befool you.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.800
I have seen horrible things happening
because these entrepreneurs

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:44.880
try to entice by advertisement.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:50.880
Recently in Paris they said
we should have six inches of skirts

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:58.400
and nowhere we could get long skirts.
Imagine in all these cold countries

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.240
so many got varicose veins.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:10.000
They start styles for hair, for body,
for faces, they start all kinds of nonsense

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.160
but Sahaja Yoginis should understand
what are they up to,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.920
you should not fall into their traps
at all.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.160
So you are the Goddess of the family,
you have the Shakti

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.640
and you have to be very careful.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.440
Moreover you are Sahaja Yoginis
so you shouldn’t allow your Sahasrara

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.360
to be touched by anyone
and your power comes from your chastity.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.360
Thousands of women in India
committed suicide

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.440
because they didn’t want any man
to touch their body.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.800
Now you are in Sahaj culture
and in Sahaj culture

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.480
we have to behave in a very dignified
mature manner.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:00.480
When you are small girls
you are also Goddesses,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.760
that time you are innocent,
then you get married,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:12.080
it’s a very big thing that you are
a married woman is very auspicious.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:19.520
Then after marriage you have children,
is even greater honour for you

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.160
because you are mothers.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:32.480
We are not actresses, we are mothers
and you should be proud of being a mother

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.800
and you should be proud of your children.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:44.560
Then you become grandmothers,
I think this is a very great achievement

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.480
and you should feel very proud
of your age

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.960
that you are a grandmother.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:58.080
If you will go on struggling
for looking young you’ll look very old.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.440
You see your Mother is seventy years
of age and I don’t look my age,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.760
that’s what they say.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:12.000
I have never bothered about my looks,
I have no time,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.360
I have so many children
and I am very proud of my age also.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:25.520
With age you grow, you mature,
you are wiser,

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.680
then you have all the assets
of your personality.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:36.720
If you really respect your age
people will come to you for advice, help,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.800
and then you can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.600
There are so many complications
with these entrepreneurs

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.560
the way they try to exploit women.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:54.897
May God Bless you all.
