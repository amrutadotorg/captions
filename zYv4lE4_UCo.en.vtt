1998-0418 Evening Program At Easter Puja,
Istanbul, Turkey

00:00:05.804 --> 00:16:45.804
From 2:07:52

02:07:52.672 --> 02:07:59.255
I never expected such a beautiful pandal
you have raised  that

02:07:59.305 --> 02:08:02.039
the way you have organized the

02:08:02.085 --> 02:08:05.748
stage as if you are all experts
on stage arrangements.

02:08:05.773 --> 02:08:09.996
I can’t understand
how beautiful it was all done.

02:08:10.036 --> 02:08:15.247
Now I don’t know what to say about
all the programs that you have arranged.

02:08:15.306 --> 02:08:17.555
One better than the other

02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:21.754
and it shows such a capacity you have

02:08:21.779 --> 02:08:28.387
or you have developed to organize such beautiful

02:08:28.412 --> 02:08:32.915
entertaining continuous programs.

02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:36.156
I used to do the same when I was young.

02:08:36.181 --> 02:08:38.516
I used to arrange many programs

02:08:38.541 --> 02:08:42.215
and I know the difficulties and hurdles we had.

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:45.559
Because the people
who did that were not Sahaja Yogis.

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:48.610
You are all Sahaja Yogis so you are also combining

02:08:48.614 --> 02:08:51.622
and you are helping each other so beautifully.

02:08:51.647 --> 02:08:55.809
There is so much of harmony, no problem of any kind.

02:08:55.983 --> 02:09:02.390
This is something to be seen
and to be felt the way it has been done.

02:09:02.652 --> 02:09:05.830
I was really surprised the way

02:09:05.855 --> 02:09:08.229
they had the Turkish dance also.

02:09:08.254 --> 02:09:10.613
These people are beautiful dancers

02:09:10.638 --> 02:09:13.171
and they can be paid very heavily.

02:09:13.196 --> 02:09:15.356
If somehow I could introduce them

02:09:15.381 --> 02:09:17.783
to some sarama  people from India.

02:09:17.819 --> 02:09:22.482
They used this kind of dance very much
and but it is very difficult.

02:09:22.507 --> 02:09:25.278
I don’t know if you understand
there is the myth patterns

02:09:25.303 --> 02:09:30.567
of those people who danced here
and who are so fast.

02:09:31.904 --> 02:09:34.578
My husband used to always tell me that

02:09:34.626 --> 02:09:37.581
Turkish people are the most capable people.

02:09:37.606 --> 02:09:40.617
If they take to anything they do it very well.

02:09:40.642 --> 02:09:46.259
And I can see that in three years time
this whole of Istanbul has changed.

02:09:46.284 --> 02:09:49.794
So many new buildings have come up, is so different

02:09:49.819 --> 02:09:55.121
that you can’t make out it the same road
or the same place you are in.

02:09:55.862 --> 02:09:57.917
So we have to learn from them

02:09:57.942 --> 02:10:00.825
is to be capable is one

02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:03.463
and to have a speed very important.

02:10:03.488 --> 02:10:07.178
Though I don’t like the speed
that comes and goes like.

02:10:07.203 --> 02:10:10.879
If you have to go to the airport
suddenly you get speedy.

02:10:10.904 --> 02:10:15.266
But the speed in the sense
that when you are doing something

02:10:15.291 --> 02:10:18.009
you must have that balance within yourselves

02:10:18.034 --> 02:10:23.880
and you must do with a kind of a divine spirit

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:27.296
with that you will achieve so many things.

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.000
As you have seen today

02:10:29.034 --> 02:10:33.094
how these people are singing the qawwali

02:10:33.118 --> 02:10:39.378
or a little girl sang so well Ganesha Stuti and others also.

02:10:39.403 --> 02:10:42.588
So well done that is unbelievable.

02:10:42.613 --> 02:10:45.927
For Romanian girls to do this nath

02:10:45.952 --> 02:10:48.801
paratnatyam is something, I can’t understand.

02:10:48.826 --> 02:10:52.361
But Romania I think is a Gandharva.

02:10:52.386 --> 02:10:56.838
What you call the [UNCLEAR] musicians place.

02:10:56.863 --> 02:10:59.026
You get all kind of musicians there

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:03.211
and suddenly you find so many beautiful dancers there.

02:11:03.236 --> 02:11:06.517
Who are doing Kathak and also

02:11:06.542 --> 02:11:09.033
this very difficult dance Paratnatyam

02:11:09.058 --> 02:11:11.671
and also I have seen doing Kathakali

02:11:11.696 --> 02:11:14.542
It is very surprising how they have picked up

02:11:14.567 --> 02:11:18.031
like a Kuchipudi dance which is a very fast number.

02:11:18.056 --> 02:11:21.818
And they are so good.
I mean as if the rhythm is built in their body

02:11:21.843 --> 02:11:24.243
the way they do it. I am surprised.

02:11:24.275 --> 02:11:30.223
They are very beautiful also [UNCLEAR] musicians there.

02:11:30.264 --> 02:11:34.115
And you see them how they are picked this qawwali

02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:39.030
which is such a difficult thing to sing
with all the alaps and things.

02:11:39.055 --> 02:11:42.773
But they have managed it somehow very beautifully.

02:11:42.798 --> 02:11:45.269
If somebody listens to it from outside

02:11:45.294 --> 02:11:49.493
they will think that somebody like Nusrat Ali sing.

02:11:49.677 --> 02:11:53.744
It is very beautifully done
and my all congratulations to them.

02:11:53.769 --> 02:11:58.884
Apart from that, I must say
that Indian music is very difficult

02:11:58.909 --> 02:12:02.398
and people learn for ages to master it.

02:12:02.423 --> 02:12:05.252
But how in Sahaja Yoga you have done so well,

02:12:05.277 --> 02:12:11.517
for example, Selim playing the sarod
like an instrument so well.

02:12:11.542 --> 02:12:13.869
Well you know I asked Hamzad Ali.

02:12:13.894 --> 02:12:17.253
He said ten years he was just practising.

02:12:17.278 --> 02:12:21.693
So what is this happen to you all that
you are doing so well?

02:12:21.718 --> 02:12:26.278
Especially I find in Babamama  School

02:12:26.303 --> 02:12:29.214
that he has started. He himself is amazed

02:12:29.239 --> 02:12:35.393
because in three days three months they can sing

02:12:35.418 --> 02:12:38.633
a melody like Malcolm’s

02:12:38.658 --> 02:12:43.911
for which people have to work
for years together and they just go on.

02:12:43.936 --> 02:12:46.774
So from where this knowledge has come to them.

02:12:46.799 --> 02:12:51.251
Is it from the previous life
or is it your spirit God knows.

02:12:51.276 --> 02:12:54.899
Because he says even Sahaja Yogis who are Indians

02:12:54.924 --> 02:12:59.442
who are realized souls can’t do
the way these westerners are doing.

02:12:59.467 --> 02:13:03.837
Means this something really
the whole music thing [UNCLEAR]

02:13:03.862 --> 02:13:07.888
towards the west now
I think the way people have taken.

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:10.349
It was very very beautifully done,

02:13:10.374 --> 02:13:12.335
extremely entertaining for me.

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:14.486
I didn’t know how the time past.

02:13:14.511 --> 02:13:18.888
It was such an endeavour on your part to do this.

02:13:18.913 --> 02:13:22.637
Beautifully this all pandal is done so well.

02:13:22.662 --> 02:13:27.092
I mean I never expected in Turkey
all this thing could happen.

02:13:27.119 --> 02:13:30.019
We have only one person Nese

02:13:30.044 --> 02:13:35.285
she is a young lady and
how she has organized in this very gratitude.

02:13:35.437 --> 02:13:37.897
Also gratitude  very creditable to

02:13:37.932 --> 02:13:40.010
to Greek people to come here,

02:13:40.035 --> 02:13:43.846
and take such part and help them.

02:13:43.871 --> 02:13:50.356
You see this is a very nice idea
to have Greeks and Turkish to be together.

02:13:50.381 --> 02:13:54.342
Because they are having a fight
otherwise you see for the petrol.

02:13:54.367 --> 02:13:56.164
For the petrol, I think.

02:13:56.189 --> 02:13:59.937
And this can finish with Sahaja Yoga.

02:13:59.962 --> 02:14:06.198
that this fight between Turkey
and Greece will end very soon.

02:14:06.585 --> 02:14:10.501
Another thing which is very remarkable is

02:14:10.526 --> 02:14:16.537
the way you pronounce also Indian words
so well. l am surprised.

02:14:16.562 --> 02:14:20.501
Because not easy to pronounce them so easily.

02:14:20.526 --> 02:14:27.189
And to accept the accent so clearly.

02:14:27.214 --> 02:14:30.684
It is very very remarkable I must say.

02:14:30.709 --> 02:14:36.507
Of course, I mean not that
Indian music is the last word.

02:14:36.569 --> 02:14:41.873
It is not that always that is the only one
that is the highest.

02:14:41.898 --> 02:14:45.035
For example, I have also heard Austrians

02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:52.327
back playing very beautiful orchestra
from Vivaldi and Mozart and all that.

02:14:52.352 --> 02:14:54.398
So it is something happens to you.

02:14:54.423 --> 02:15:01.468
I think within that you start acquiring
this talent of music

02:15:01.493 --> 02:15:08.453
and acquiring the talent of playing the music,
understanding the music so well.

02:15:08.922 --> 02:15:11.146
Is not possible.

02:15:11.448 --> 02:15:16.984
So this is if this is the blessing of Sahaja Yoga
half of the work is done.

02:15:17.019 --> 02:15:23.372
Because through this musical notes only the vibrations flow.

02:15:23.397 --> 02:15:29.236
When the music is played I find
so much vibration goes out automatically.

02:15:29.261 --> 02:15:33.595
Of course, it has to be in tune.
It has to be in rhythm

02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:40.640
but otherwise, there is no other way out
to spread the vibrations.

02:15:40.775 --> 02:15:44.928
So music plays a very important role in Sahaja Yoga.

02:15:44.953 --> 02:15:47.995
And even if you don’t understand it doesn’t matter.

02:15:48.021 --> 02:15:53.197
Because vibrations flow and
you get the blessings of the vibrations.

02:15:53.222 --> 02:15:55.089
Music is very important.

02:15:55.114 --> 02:15:58.803
But no one guarantee no-nonsense must beautiful.

02:15:58.828 --> 02:16:10.580
If you do it in a proper dignified manner any dance
or any even a drama is very very successful.

02:16:10.765 --> 02:16:13.655
Regarding our drama I was, it is an eyeopener

02:16:13.703 --> 02:16:18.324
and it is a very bold venture on your part
to put Ayatollah there.

02:16:18.358 --> 02:16:20.091
I mean it was too much.

02:16:23.032 --> 02:16:25.408
I don’t know what to say
because they are all ignorant.

02:16:25.433 --> 02:16:28.373
You have to forgive them.
They are very ignorant

02:16:28.381 --> 02:16:32.137
and because Quran was written after forty years,

02:16:32.185 --> 02:16:36.595
after the death of Mohammed Sahab.

02:16:36.645 --> 02:16:41.672
You see there has to be some ambiguity
means it is ambiguous.

02:16:41.712 --> 02:16:44.756
But if you really read through the words,

02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:49.545
through the lines than you will find.
It is all Sahaja Yoga written.

02:16:49.606 --> 02:16:51.806
Absolutely Sahaja Yoga  written there.

02:16:51.838 --> 02:16:54.631
But that is what inside you should have

02:16:54.656 --> 02:16:57.656
is to  go through the Quran with that inside.

02:16:57.681 --> 02:17:00.503
Because we are bringing no credit to go.

02:17:00.517 --> 02:17:05.991
Mohammed Sahib no credit to Quran,
no credit to Islam.

02:17:06.067 --> 02:17:11.919
So this is what is happening and
if we have to save the Muslims,

02:17:11.956 --> 02:17:15.501
we have to tell them whatever is the truth.

02:17:15.526 --> 02:17:17.838
And it that truth, they can rise.

02:17:17.863 --> 02:17:20.130
It is true about Christians also.

02:17:20.156 --> 02:17:24.978
It is true about all religions
that whatever is written

02:17:25.042 --> 02:17:27.525
is ambiguous perhaps for all of them.

02:17:27.566 --> 02:17:29.496
Because it is in poetry

02:17:29.521 --> 02:17:32.794
and so the people don’t understand what is in it.

02:17:32.834 --> 02:17:35.301
They don’t understand the meaning of.

02:17:35.433 --> 02:17:39.482
For example, we have a very great poet Kabir.
You know him very well.

02:17:39.504 --> 02:17:42.141
Kabir sang a song saying

02:17:42.166 --> 02:17:45.188
Sainya nikas gaye, mai na ladi

02:17:45.213 --> 02:17:47.318
so sainya means what

02:17:47.353 --> 02:17:52.130
sainya means according to
our Lucknow people it means lover.

02:17:52.137 --> 02:17:54.362
What has he got to do with the lover?

02:17:54.402 --> 02:17:56.888
See Kabir has nothing to do with the lover.

02:17:56.928 --> 02:17:59.208
But said that sainya nikas gaye

02:17:59.233 --> 02:18:01.529
So they used to think this about the lover.

02:18:01.561 --> 02:18:04.444
But when I told them sainya means life.

02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:06.969
They were all shocked. I said it is.

02:18:07.009 --> 02:18:08.877
What has he got to do with the lover?

02:18:08.902 --> 02:18:13.229
It is life when it went away I didn’t fight it.

02:18:13.334 --> 02:18:22.518
Is the whole symbolic expression of Kabir
is never understood by people

02:18:22.621 --> 02:18:26.073
like he has,

02:18:26.192 --> 02:18:31.067
he has said to Kundalini called is "surati".

02:18:31.282 --> 02:18:33.750
Surati, surati chadhe kamaan

02:18:33.806 --> 02:18:39.628
So what people understood
that he is talking about tobacco.

02:18:40.050 --> 02:18:42.970
They made surati as tobacco.

02:18:43.029 --> 02:18:45.640
Tobacco’s name is surati in Bihar.

02:18:45.706 --> 02:18:47.366
So you can imagine

02:18:47.444 --> 02:18:50.645
what Kabir must be thinking in the ...[UNCLEAR]

02:18:50.670 --> 02:18:53.497
from where did I write for these stupid people.

02:18:53.522 --> 02:18:55.705
But it is ignorance.

02:18:55.740 --> 02:18:58.287
When the eyes are not open,

02:18:58.312 --> 02:19:01.785
you don’t understand what is it.

02:19:01.810 --> 02:19:09.139
You see a snake in a rope.

02:19:10.312 --> 02:19:15.523
The only thing I feel is that it was not written in

02:19:15.587 --> 02:19:20.428
absolute prose dry prose, people have misunderstood.

02:19:20.453 --> 02:19:24.202
Same about Nanaksa

02:19:24.251 --> 02:19:28.676
He has written such a beautiful
very beautiful thing

02:19:28.764 --> 02:19:33.099
and that whole guru Granth Sahab  is nothing but the poems

02:19:33.124 --> 02:19:36.882
of all the realized souls.

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:39.717
But in that he has written, again and again,

02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:43.505
don’t only read the words.
But read the meaning within the words.

02:19:43.530 --> 02:19:46.874
But they just go on reading
one after another you know.

02:19:46.908 --> 02:19:50.830
One comes put the [UNCLEAR] finger there
and [UNCLEAR, stars]

02:19:50.941 --> 02:19:53.589
If that is the way you are going to read Quran

02:19:53.613 --> 02:19:58.410
or Bible or this Nanaksa but any one of these books

02:19:58.435 --> 02:20:00.857
you are going to land up in

02:20:00.893 --> 02:20:03.796
where [UNCLEAR, oasis] of stupidity.

02:20:03.844 --> 02:20:05.855
That is what was happening to people

02:20:05.864 --> 02:20:08.318
that’s why they are misled, they are fighting.

02:20:08.343 --> 02:20:12.850
Why should people who believe in God,
why should they fight?

02:20:12.875 --> 02:20:15.110
What is the purpose of that?

02:20:15.161 --> 02:20:19.717
So this is what has happened
and now it is your duty as Sahaja Yogis.

02:20:19.742 --> 02:20:23.754
Because you have got the light is your duty
to explain to them

02:20:23.794 --> 02:20:26.820
that this is what we have been doing wrong.

02:20:26.867 --> 02:20:31.565
And we all miss out if we don’t take to Sahaja Yoga.
We all miss out.

02:20:31.605 --> 02:20:36.427
So the best thing is to have patient,

02:20:36.452 --> 02:20:40.058
have love and compassion for people for the blind.

02:20:40.083 --> 02:20:45.549
And then explain to them very sweetly
what you have followed.

02:20:45.969 --> 02:20:49.536
You are the people who have been
called as imams.

02:20:49.576 --> 02:20:52.732
You are imams you are no less than imam.

02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:56.210
Imams also didn’t know so much about kundalini

02:20:56.238 --> 02:20:59.571
or about the ascent and all that.

02:20:59.573 --> 02:21:03.511
Except for Mohammad Sahib himself
has described mirage.

02:21:03.536 --> 02:21:05.865
That too in a such a symbolic manner.

02:21:05.914 --> 02:21:08.652
That anybody who reads it will think

02:21:08.676 --> 02:21:11.297
that will sit on a white horse

02:21:11.322 --> 02:21:14.487
and go towards the sky.
It is not like that.

02:21:14.997 --> 02:21:16.998
You see they are symbolic people.

02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:19.518
That’s why I always avoid symbols.

02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:25.158
Because I know human beings will not understand symbols.

02:21:25.183 --> 02:21:29.536
This is the way they express to
make it beautiful also

02:21:29.553 --> 02:21:32.626
people are so angry for

02:21:32.668 --> 02:21:35.073
listening to anything that is truthful.

02:21:35.113 --> 02:21:38.290
That they wanted to put it in a very sweet manner

02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:41.062
and this way.
Everybody has done that.

02:21:41.891 --> 02:21:43.766
Gyaneshwara such a powerful man.

02:21:43.798 --> 02:21:44.758
[UNCLEAR, He took].

02:21:44.782 --> 02:21:46.433
They all use symbols.

02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:49.725
And because of the symbols, people are confused

02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:52.456
and some people have taken advantage of that.

02:21:52.481 --> 02:21:55.706
So what we have to now tell them,

02:21:55.731 --> 02:21:58.790
that this is a symbol of what.

02:21:58.815 --> 02:22:02.673
Explain to them.
This is symbolic meaning what.

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:05.598
And then I am sure I am very sure,

02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:10.070
they will take to the right path
and follow the right path.

02:22:10.112 --> 02:22:14.772
All the Sufis also write poetry.
This gentleman also writes poetry.

02:22:14.844 --> 02:22:16.936
All of them write poetry you see.

02:22:16.954 --> 02:22:20.010
The poetry is very beautiful to enjoy like flowers.

02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:24.434
But if it goes into the head of the people
then it is of use.

02:22:24.452 --> 02:22:26.922
It doesn’t, doesn’t.

02:22:27.032 --> 02:22:32.267
So you have to talk just like your mother
is a very [UNCLEAR, prozac]

02:22:32.301 --> 02:22:36.477
straight forward way and explain to people.

02:22:36.533 --> 02:22:40.956
But among yourself, you can use music poetry everything.

02:22:41.044 --> 02:22:44.341
I am very thankful to you for this beautiful program

02:22:44.350 --> 02:22:52.530
you have given now such a variety
and of such an expression of art.

02:22:52.652 --> 02:22:56.742
I don’t know what to say.
I never expected all this

02:22:56.752 --> 02:22:59.540
and in Turkey, I never expected at least.

02:22:59.565 --> 02:23:03.454
So much work has been done in Turkey I didn’t know.

02:23:03.505 --> 02:23:09.425
This is all thanks to Nese I think or to Selim

02:23:09.450 --> 02:23:12.674
and all these people have done so much,

02:23:12.706 --> 02:23:16.676
so much to create so many Sahaja Yogis here.

02:23:17.358 --> 02:23:21.450
I am happy people have come all the way from

02:23:21.491 --> 02:23:28.632
Kiev and also from Romania and from all over to celebrate

02:23:28.991 --> 02:23:35.779
this great occasion of I should say

02:23:35.845 --> 02:23:38.347
they call the resurrection of Christ.

02:23:38.411 --> 02:23:41.595
Whatever it is shown that you respect

02:23:41.654 --> 02:23:45.616
all the religions equally and understand beauty.

02:23:45.696 --> 02:23:48.627
This is the biggest achievement I tell you today

02:23:48.652 --> 02:23:52.986
in the turmoil of people fighting each other.

02:23:54.142 --> 02:23:56.143
So May God Bless You.

02:23:56.200 --> 02:24:01.043
Thank you very much.
Thank you ever so much.

02:24:01.261 --> 02:24:04.668
I hope tomorrow they are going to have a havan.

02:24:04.684 --> 02:24:08.932
And after that in the “what time is the puja?

02:24:10.128 --> 02:24:12.366
Havan?

02:24:12.995 --> 02:24:14.772
one o’clock ?

02:24:18.796 --> 02:24:22.447
we can have havan later…”

02:24:23.107 --> 02:24:26.271
We can have puja at about 7 o’clock they said

02:24:26.296 --> 02:24:31.615
and havan in the morning whenever you decide.

02:24:33.367 --> 02:24:36.122
10 o’clock, 10 o’clock you can do havan.

02:24:36.141 --> 02:24:40.418
And all the negatives, negativity it is
have to be burn.

02:24:40.557 --> 02:24:45.526
So think of them who are the negatives
and who are troubling you.

02:24:45.551 --> 02:24:50.271
We have to burn them off.
We will be alright.

02:24:50.321 --> 02:24:51.761
May God Bless You.

02:24:53.811 --> 02:25:00.816
I am especially thankful to our guest
and his wife for being with us.

02:25:00.841 --> 02:25:02.223
So very kind of you.

02:25:02.248 --> 02:25:05.081
You know we Sahaja Yogis no sense of time.

02:25:05.137 --> 02:25:06.692
We are beyond time

02:25:06.725 --> 02:25:10.950
And you want sitting till tomorrow morning
if I don’t move from here.

02:25:11.133 --> 02:25:15.797
So now this is a special,

02:25:16.163 --> 02:25:20.723
2:30 is too much I think.
Thank you very much
