00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.400
Before we start,

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.288
celebrating the birth of Christ,

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.775
we have to little bit review

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:17.864
what we have done after His Birth,

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:23.963
so that we understand where do we stand in relation to Him.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.902
I have just asked all the.......

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:28.960
He was the Son of a Virgin,

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:42.780
so that even the slightest blot on His name should not be created.

00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:54.368
Because He was to do the greatest job

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:59.698
of creating for us Agnya awareness

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:05.914
which would help us to suck in all our sins,

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:09.885
all our conditionings and all our ego.

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:21.736
And this great personality was created for such a great work within ourselves.

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:31.146
But, unfortunately,

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:36.456
we have spoilt both these institutions within us

00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:42.408
to such an extent that it is the most difficult task to give realisation to Christians.

00:01:44.628 --> 00:01:48.947
On the one side we have too much conditioning,

00:01:50.757 --> 00:01:52.888
as you know

00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:59.447
through Catholicism and other ideas about Christianity

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:04.787
we created a horrible conditioning in our superego,

00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:11.068
which is just like a solid rock, I think, sometimes.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.860
And those who have been in Catholic churches are still, get stuck up with it

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.722
and when they are facing me, I find their eyes are blinking

00:02:22.722 --> 00:02:25.419
and the Agnya is not straight.

00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:34.020
You have to give up all that conditioning completely if you have to really get to Sahaj Yoga.

00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:45.031
To that extent we went that we tried to create institutions.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.639
Of course, we collected money, no doubt about it, lot of money,

00:02:51.728 --> 00:03:01.348
all kinds of drama, of a papal order and of archbishop order and all these archbishops and of tomfoolery.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:07.400
All kinds of nonsensical donkey people were created, absolutely.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.818
They have nothing to do with Christ, they have nothing to do with God, they have no idea of Divine Life.

00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:21.056
And to them prohibiting people from doing something was only religion.

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:29.425
And this has taken the West into such darkness

00:03:29.502 --> 00:03:33.895
that Sahaja Yoga has to be worked out

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:39.746
in a very great speed and in a very expansive way,

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:49.359
otherwise you cannot get over these horrible ideas of archbishops, and the bishops and the popes.

00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:57.901
The other side is the ego part.

00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:02.229
Then people like Mr. Freud came in

00:04:03.872 --> 00:04:10.794
and they put absolutely anti-God ideas into people, absolutely anti-God

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:14.794
is against the Mother, against the Son.

00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:18.052
Absolutely, it is absurd.

00:04:19.545 --> 00:04:26.682
These anti-God devilish ideas penetrated and people started saying, What is wrong?

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:31.387
This is all conditioning, we should remove all conditioning!

00:04:31.377 --> 00:04:36.567
So they became ego-oriented, which is the other side which Christ has to work out.

00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:43.086
So I mean, after Christ has been established in the West,

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:49.367
they have seen to it that they create all hurdles, that are possible under the sun,

00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:52.706
for the Agnya Chakra to open out.

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:59.853
Despite that, I find that all Sahaja Yogis, who are from the West

00:04:59.853 --> 00:05:03.000
are still attached to Christianity and not to Christ.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.949
There is a lingering Christianity still within you

00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:13.379
and that Christianity has to drop out.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.858
While Indians are very good at dropping out all nonsensical ideas,

00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:21.093
because we have had lots of challenges in this country for everything:

00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:25.682
for the conditioning we have had challenges

00:05:26.752 --> 00:05:29.560
for the ego oriented we have had challenges.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.793
So people are used to this kind of a giving-up.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:42.223
But in the West, we still are very much attached to that nonsense of Christianity.

00:05:42.247 --> 00:05:45.156
It has nothing to do with Christ, believe me!

00:05:45.237 --> 00:05:49.615
And this fanaticism which is lingering still in your minds

00:05:49.685 --> 00:05:53.995
must be given-up otherwise you do not do any justice to Christ.

00:05:54.855 --> 00:06:00.062
That by no chance means that you take to another religion like Hinduism

00:06:00.132 --> 00:06:04.040
or any nonsensical Jainism, or anything.

00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:10.204
The essence, the tattwa, of Christianity is Christ,

00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:16.821
and it is so thickly clouded by all these nonsensical things

00:06:16.824 --> 00:06:22.908
that you really have to drop out this word Christianity from your vocabulary completely,

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:26.838
and from your mind, otherwise you can never go to that principle.

00:06:28.298 --> 00:06:30.473
It is a fact, take it from me.

00:06:30.574 --> 00:06:41.692
And even now the attention of all the people is on what Christ said, or Mother Mary has said it,

00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:45.257
and which has come through these horrible people to us.

00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:56.341
So to learn about other Deities and other Great Incarnations, you neutralise this.

00:06:56.372 --> 00:07:01.865
You must try to neutralise this too much attention by learning about other Deities,

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:07.709
say Shri Ganesha. If you talk about Shri Ganesha, he is the essence of Christ.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.747
You understand that.

00:07:09.737 --> 00:07:16.704
Ganesha is the essence of Christ, and Christ is the manifestation of Shri Ganesha's powers.

00:07:16.725 --> 00:07:21.257
So, if you go to the essence...  most things, that's better.

00:07:22.826 --> 00:07:31.204
Then, of course, Christ is there but we must see him as he is

00:07:31.225 --> 00:07:35.158
which very few people have seen before,

00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:40.137
But now in Sahaja Yoga you should see Him as He was.

00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:43.086
He was the Holiest of Holy, first of all

00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:45.870
you accept that position.

00:07:45.877 --> 00:07:50.725
Then this Freud nonsense has nothing to do for those who call themselves Christians:

00:07:50.754 --> 00:07:56.975
five days they do all nonsensical of Freud and sixth day they talk of Christianity,

00:07:56.997 --> 00:07:59.547
and seventh day they go to Church.

00:07:59.536 --> 00:08:02.536
How can they go? I mean, how can they call themselves Christians?

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:07.697
By what standard? Just tell me! I mean, just think of it!

00:08:07.747 --> 00:08:11.843
And the Indians have asked them to get out because they won't understand what it is.

00:08:11.843 --> 00:08:15.334
It's so nonsensical, it's filth.

00:08:15.374 --> 00:08:21.122
The Holiest of Holy, we have brought Him down to such a low level by our nonsensical ideas.

00:08:24.293 --> 00:08:32.673
So one has to understand that these conditionings of Catholicism

00:08:32.682 --> 00:08:36.836
made us so repulsive

00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:45.004
to ourselves that we took to the other side which is even worse, much worse than the conditioning itself.

00:08:46.802 --> 00:08:49.850
And you come in contact with these people morning till evening.

00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:55.975
Either they are Freudians or they are so-called Christians

00:08:57.586 --> 00:09:01.940
even after realisation! But you must know you are special people.

00:09:03.907 --> 00:09:08.956
You are above them. You've risen above them. Christ is awakened.

00:09:12.182 --> 00:09:14.485
So, to do justice to Christ,

00:09:15.663 --> 00:09:20.725
you must get over all your conditionings, to begin with, of Christianity, if you have any.

00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:26.642
Or if you have been freudian get rid of that horrible fellow, absolutely.

00:09:26.653 --> 00:09:30.763
He was anti-Christ! Sick, sick, sick!

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:39.163
We have nothing to do with Freud's ideas, even this much.

00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:42.658
Believe me!

00:09:42.673 --> 00:09:46.798
We are not to justify him at any point for anything.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.552
He took full advantage of the repulsion people developed out of the conditionings.

00:09:55.432 --> 00:09:58.344
And then he built up all these stories,

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:01.974
because he was himself a very low level man

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.652
not to be counted as a human being from any standard.

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:10.355
You see, Christ came for human beings, but not for these low level people.

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:12.995
Even the lepers were better than him, I think.

00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:15.695
Horrible it is!

00:10:15.716 --> 00:10:21.024
Even to think about the whole thing makes me nauseated.

00:10:22.176 --> 00:10:23.663
It's very unholy.

00:10:25.576 --> 00:10:37.024
So, for all practical purposes, we have to understand that we have nothing to do with Mr. Freud.

00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:45.114
He is filth, he is dirt, he is absolutely a low level man.

00:10:45.134 --> 00:10:48.874
We have nothing to learn from him nor from his ideas.

00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:56.224
Now, the other side of it is the conditioning of the churches.

00:10:56.254 --> 00:10:59.754
There are still many Sahaja yogis still confused with it.

00:11:01.793 --> 00:11:08.504
Of course, if you have to save the Christians, so-called, you have to take them out of the conditioning.

00:11:10.057 --> 00:11:17.273
Luckily, we have someone who is writing a thesis about these things,

00:11:17.283 --> 00:11:24.922
how these things are dangerous to society.

00:11:26.124 --> 00:11:35.711
But still nobody realises this is anti-Christ activity to condition you is a anti-Christ activity.

00:11:35.706 --> 00:11:45.389
Christ came on this Earth where Moses has laid down the dharma

00:11:46.749 --> 00:11:49.613
after him, so many years later.

00:11:49.623 --> 00:11:55.750
He thought people would be in balance and He has to give the message of his resurrection and ascent.

00:11:55.773 --> 00:11:58.259
That's how He came on Earth.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.681
But then they created even worse things than the shariat.

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:04.951
Shariat is in the Bible.

00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:09.567
All these laws are in the Bible where they say that: anybody who does this should be killed,

00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:13.798
anybody who does like that should be beheaded. It's all in the Bible.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:17.721
You see whatever these Muslims are doing is all in the Bible,

00:12:17.745 --> 00:12:19.797
it's coming from Bible.

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:26.254
So, to neutralise all that, Mr. Freud started another style.

00:12:27.427 --> 00:12:34.392
For us Divine laws are binding because we know that's the only way one can rise.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.581
It is not compulsory,

00:12:39.903 --> 00:12:44.692
but voluntary acceptance that we have to rise,

00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:46.773
that we have to be alright.

00:12:46.763 --> 00:12:51.812
There are no conditionings in Sahaja Yoga but this is how we improve,

00:12:51.841 --> 00:12:59.061
this is how we go further, so we accept the situation, and we move forward with it.

00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:04.315
That's why realisation should give you that strength

00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:12.375
to fight anti-Christ activities within your mind.

00:13:15.384 --> 00:13:18.225
You have to face yourself, is the point I am saying.

00:13:19.322 --> 00:13:22.312
Not only that you have to face yourself,

00:13:22.322 --> 00:13:26.451
but you have to face the so-called society that is around you

00:13:28.971 --> 00:13:35.721
and see for yourself that these conditionings

00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:45.985
and these anti-Christ activities, into which you have indulged,

00:13:46.008 --> 00:13:52.148
are completely detrimental to your growth and to your ascent.

00:13:52.764 --> 00:13:55.778
And as you are special people

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:58.065
who have got realisation

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:06.865
you have to argue it out with yourself and reach proper conclusions. No use arguing out with others.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:12.548
As you know, with the conditioning, people get quiet,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.220
they don't talk, but the conditioning is growing inside.

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:22.105
With the ego people talk too much

00:14:22.197 --> 00:14:27.758
and they aggress others with their talking and the ego is growing too much.

00:14:28.427 --> 00:14:31.243
So one has to be in the witness state.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.019
That means wherever you have to talk, you have to talk

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.038
and wherever you have to keep quiet, you have to keep quiet.

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:40.836
This is at the Vishuddhi level.

00:14:40.908 --> 00:14:43.076
At the Agnya level,

00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:50.528
you have to detest all that is ugly,

00:14:50.538 --> 00:14:53.677
all that is unholy, all that is filth.

00:14:55.368 --> 00:15:00.806
Because now a new sensitivity has developed within you,

00:15:00.841 --> 00:15:05.860
a new sensitivity to holiness, to auspiciousness.

00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:10.211
Try to improve this auspiciousness within you.

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:19.288
I find people get very easily attached to negative people,

00:15:19.288 --> 00:15:22.908
they get identified with negative people.

00:15:22.898 --> 00:15:24.719
It's very common.

00:15:24.719 --> 00:15:30.139
And they think that they have been sympathetic. It is a sympathy they are working in.

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:38.879
It could be your sister, could be your brother, mother, or could be your wife, your child.

00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:40.307
It can be anyone.

00:15:40.388 --> 00:15:42.734
But by getting attached to such people,

00:15:42.783 --> 00:15:47.875
you are really harming that person because that person will go down to hell,

00:15:47.884 --> 00:15:51.144
and you will also go down to hell.

00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:53.874
So if you want to do any good to the person,

00:15:53.951 --> 00:16:01.471
best thing is not to be attached to that person and tell that person that these are anti-Christ activities.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.903
And get attached to that group which is positive, which is doing auspicious work,

00:16:07.932 --> 00:16:09.995
which is doing Holy work.

00:16:10.043 --> 00:16:14.566
And understand that the strength lies in getting attached to that group,

00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:20.975
than getting attached to one, some singled-out, negative personality.

00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:26.201
Now, every one of you has had some experience of this.

00:16:27.892 --> 00:16:33.542
I'll give you an example of Warren's wife, she's not here, neither he is here.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.442
But it's nice to understand what happened, in her case.

00:16:37.533 --> 00:16:41.432
He was very attached to her. He married her. He asked me.

00:16:41.524 --> 00:16:46.254
I was really shocked that he's so insensitive. Why can't he see her?

00:16:46.335 --> 00:16:49.062
Why can't he understand her? But I did not know what to say now.

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:51.086
I said, if I say, "Don't marry,"

00:16:51.254 --> 00:16:57.091
he will think that Mother is trying to force him down or something. I did know what to say but I was really shocked

00:16:57.076 --> 00:16:59.990
and for about two minutes, I didn't say anything.

00:17:02.149 --> 00:17:05.391
And she also played her cards very well.

00:17:06.423 --> 00:17:08.971
And I said, "Alright, you can marry.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:14.317
You'll get happiness. If you think you can get happiness, that's all.

00:17:14.355 --> 00:17:18.067
I didn't say "joy." "If you think you can get happiness, marry her."

00:17:18.144 --> 00:17:20.516
Now she got married to him.

00:17:21.144 --> 00:17:24.467
Then he said she must come with him to England.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:30.307
He brought her. He tried to avoid. I told him "Warren be careful."

00:17:31.478 --> 00:17:34.721
Then they lost their passports.

00:17:34.738 --> 00:17:37.555
He found his passport, she did not.

00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:42.326
But he got after my life, he said, "Please ask Mr. Shrivastava somehow get her passport.

00:17:42.425 --> 00:17:46.625
Passport should be there." I said, "Alright." Then they made her passport.

00:17:48.728 --> 00:17:52.008
Then she came with him. Still she was continuing.

00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:55.925
I told that, "Please send away this lady. I don't want her to be with me.

00:17:55.998 --> 00:17:58.576
It's a headache. All the 24 hours she is with me.

00:17:58.653 --> 00:18:04.326
I must have some time without these horrible bhoots around me. Please get rid of her, she is bad."

00:18:04.346 --> 00:18:06.190
But he couldn't understand it.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.076
Still he was siding with her.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:17.605
Then one day it happened that she attacked my heart.

00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:21.692
The heart got into a big fist.

00:18:21.692 --> 00:18:26.901
I said, "Now you put hand on my heart and see it." It was throbbing like anything.

00:18:27.076 --> 00:18:31.865
He couldn't put his hand, couldn't even bring it near it. I said, "Now please ask her to get down."

00:18:31.932 --> 00:18:33.903
Then she got down and it stopped.

00:18:35.346 --> 00:18:40.173
Then he realised this is the thing. But still he did not give her up,

00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:43.990
he did not give her up. I went to Los Angeles, everywhere she followed me.

00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:47.451
The sympathy, you see.

00:18:47.538 --> 00:18:51.519
She could have gone away, she was quite a robust lady, no problem.

00:18:51.662 --> 00:18:56.086
But in Los Angeles, then she started showing her teeth to him, gradually.

00:18:57.421 --> 00:19:04.701
And then, ultimately, he got into trouble. He started getting the pains.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:10.413
But as soon as I left Los Angeles, she got her epilepsy.

00:19:10.394 --> 00:19:14.678
And he realised how dangerous it was to carry her all the time with me.

00:19:14.682 --> 00:19:19.442
Now he can't send her away because she has epilepsy, so he took her back.

00:19:19.528 --> 00:19:25.442
She tried to disrupt all the ashram by telling them her sympathy story,

00:19:25.528 --> 00:19:32.961
"Oh, you know, my husband, he wants to leave me," this, that, nonsense - and all of them fell for it.

00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:38.000
Now, she's a bhoot, and a bhoot, and a bhoot and the bhoot started increasing.

00:19:38.114 --> 00:19:44.673
One more bhoot added, sympathy you give them, one more bhoot added, once you give her sympathy. One more bhoot added.

00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:53.556
And she was creating problems, "This is not good, he is not good, he is against me. This family is against me. That is against me."

00:19:56.701 --> 00:20:01.471
Then he got heart attack, Terrence got heart attack - that's it.

00:20:02.932 --> 00:20:08.134
So then he sent her away. Now you do not repeat all that nonsense.

00:20:09.423 --> 00:20:16.980
Negativity is not to be tolerated, nor to be carried on with.

00:20:17.652 --> 00:20:20.902
Discretion is the better part of valour.

00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:25.875
One need not be afraid, but discretion is better part of valour.

00:20:25.853 --> 00:20:29.836
Alright? If you have negativity, better get rid of it.

00:20:29.863 --> 00:20:36.747
If somebody is so negative, better have nothing to do with that person, whatever may be the relationship. Just have nothing to do with them.

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:44.055
Because no use going down. If you are a seeker, you are a responsible seeker and a Sahaja yogi, one has to be careful.

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:49.046
This is on a Christmas day, I have to say, because there only the fight starts

00:20:49.045 --> 00:20:56.969
at the Agnya Chakra. Because if you shift from the principle of Christ you start giving argument in support of the negativity

00:20:57.067 --> 00:21:01.903
always - in the opposite direction. Alright?

00:21:01.903 --> 00:21:06.384
And you have all the arguments which works against Christ.

00:21:06.442 --> 00:21:17.528
The same Agnya Chakra, when it goes funny, you start seeing things very reasonable which are absolutely false and wrong.

00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:22.980
So we have to be alert.

00:21:23.009 --> 00:21:25.288
We have to be with Christ.

00:21:25.355 --> 00:21:28.240
Now, they will say, also, about getting vibrations, Mother, alright.

00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:35.162
I am also very much there. It's true, we saw the vibrations.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.422
Nothing doing!

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:45.296
I feel embarrassed. Sometimes I do not tell

00:21:45.384 --> 00:21:46.476
I feel embarrassed.

00:21:47.451 --> 00:21:52.670
And people also try to manoeuvre me by playing tricks on me,

00:21:52.653 --> 00:21:57.038
so that I am rather worried, sometimes, how to tell people.

00:21:57.082 --> 00:22:03.124
Because I have seen ego-oriented people are extremely sensitive.

00:22:03.163 --> 00:22:08.295
Now they are not arrogant, that's one thing is there, but they are extremely sensitive.

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:15.028
And if you tell them anything they will not accept. Like yesterday, I lashed all the Poona people, they said, "It was for our good."

00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:19.409
Nobody said that, "Mother why did you say such and such thing?"

00:22:19.479 --> 00:22:22.518
No, Not one word. Everybody said, "It was for our good."

00:22:22.576 --> 00:22:29.201
But in the West if you lash them, then you will be lashed. Nobody is going to take it that way.

00:22:29.248 --> 00:22:36.374
So I have to tell you one thing to have your ego problems settled,

00:22:36.394 --> 00:22:41.509
first of all, see that you are not playing to your ego.

00:22:43.874 --> 00:22:48.778
And also, see your conditioning which are now bhoots,

00:22:48.778 --> 00:22:55.269
all these conditionings have become bhoots in you. All the Church bhoots have got into your heads.

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:56.586
They are all there.

00:22:56.634 --> 00:23:02.730
So you must see that these bhoots are not there, because we have to be holy

00:23:02.804 --> 00:23:07.442
we have to be clean, we have to be resurrected.

00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:11.797
We are resurrected people, Christ has resurrected us.

00:23:11.894 --> 00:23:16.144
But you have to think how much he has to work for us.

00:23:16.258 --> 00:23:21.634
The more you try to be in unison with negativity,

00:23:23.748 --> 00:23:28.817
we harm Him more, we torture Him more, we trouble Him more.

00:23:28.902 --> 00:23:35.132
The One who was born in the manger in the most difficult circumstances,

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:43.401
where everybody requires comfort,

00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:52.028
who was from the very beginning, went through hazardous life till His death,

00:23:52.067 --> 00:23:57.919
His birth itself, you can see, was in a cowshed.

00:23:59.557 --> 00:24:01.939
None of you are born in a cowshed.

00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:08.836
And while the Christians are so particular about comforts,

00:24:08.894 --> 00:24:12.932
most surprising is, while Christ was born in a cowshed.

00:24:15.497 --> 00:24:20.027
In a very, very cold night Christ was born.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:28.594
Nothing much to cover: sparkling, beauty it was.

00:24:29.932 --> 00:24:36.086
Now we have to keep Him, within ourselves, comfortable.

00:24:38.336 --> 00:24:46.326
We are not going to give Him that manger in our Agnya Chakra.

00:24:47.317 --> 00:24:53.769
Manger of thoughts and a crown of thoughts

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.220
that we are not going to give Him.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:05.750
We are going to make Him comfortable by not accepting negativity as a sympathy.

00:25:05.778 --> 00:25:23.519
You have to be kind towards your auspiciousness and holiness so that Christ enjoys His stay there in your Agnya,

00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:34.919
that we do not torture Him by our useless ideas,

00:25:34.921 --> 00:25:47.816
uncomfortable behaviours, inauspicious appearances and unholy acceptance of wrong ideas.

00:25:48.903 --> 00:25:51.490
Try to respect Him.

00:25:51.505 --> 00:25:58.653
There He stands, try to make Him very comfortable.

00:26:00.865 --> 00:26:06.288
I wish I could do that but He resides in everybody's Agnya Chakra.

00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:12.458
If He was only in my Agnya I would have given Him the greatest comfort.

00:26:12.586 --> 00:26:16.719
But He wants to be manifested in everybody's Agnya.

00:26:17.807 --> 00:26:21.439
So I have to request you, as a Mother, to look after Him.

00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:26.064
Give Him a nice cradle,

00:26:26.044 --> 00:26:29.324
give Him a comfortable time,

00:26:29.344 --> 00:26:33.478
because He's born to give you your resurrection.

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:41.633
He's taken up such a great responsibility to suck all your conditioning and to suck all your ego,

00:26:41.692 --> 00:26:48.067
but that does not mean that you put stones on top of Him.

00:26:48.093 --> 00:26:54.375
It's like, sometimes I find the conditioning of some of the people in the West is so great

00:26:54.403 --> 00:26:59.343
that a big mountain is falling on this Little Child.

00:26:59.324 --> 00:27:04.353
And sometimes I find a bad breath,

00:27:04.423 --> 00:27:12.545
horrible breath of ego, which stinks, blowing like a big wind towards Him, horrible stink.

00:27:12.595 --> 00:27:19.150
It's coming out of this terrible type of a ego

00:27:19.163 --> 00:27:29.019
absolutely not the way to treat the King of Kings who is born within you.

00:27:29.076 --> 00:27:36.443
You are so respected that Christ is born within your Agnya,

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:41.298
but you must respect your Agnya Chakra.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.586
Your attention should be in the centre

00:27:46.605 --> 00:27:56.740
so there's no wobbliness. Imagine put a child, like they say, "a child is put on the winds."

00:28:00.842 --> 00:28:09.076
So this Agnya Chakra is to be kept very clean, healthy and holy.

00:28:09.823 --> 00:28:13.393
The attention should be holy.

00:28:14.423 --> 00:28:21.374
The attention outside is still not very holy, should be detached attention.

00:28:21.394 --> 00:28:28.825
If you start seeing through your Agnya it should project a power of holiness,

00:28:29.884 --> 00:28:36.757
so that anybody who looks at your eyes, should know that serenity is flowing from these eyes

00:28:36.846 --> 00:28:40.326
and not lust and greed and aggression.

00:28:41.875 --> 00:28:49.019
All this we can achieve because we've got Christ within our Agnya.

00:28:49.096 --> 00:28:51.960
Accept him there.

00:28:52.009 --> 00:28:55.259
He's born - let him grow.

00:28:55.314 --> 00:29:04.423
I am sure Sahaja Yogis will understand the importance of the Agnya Chakra.

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:10.528
In the East, no problem because to them He is only Ganesha.

00:29:11.421 --> 00:29:18.230
Ganesha is a child and they know for definite the childhood has no contaminations, no problems, nothing.

00:29:19.788 --> 00:29:23.765
So they are still children as far as sin is concerned.

00:29:23.865 --> 00:29:29.615
There is a story: one pastor went to a village, and gave a big lecture to them,

00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:31.625
and the villagers had to thank.

00:29:31.652 --> 00:29:36.253
So he got up and said, "Thank you very much for telling us all about it.

00:29:36.263 --> 00:29:43.057
We did not know what was sin and thank God you have told us that there is sin!"

00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:49.259
So this awareness is not in their heads, they don't understand it.

00:29:49.403 --> 00:29:54.131
You will be surprised, you can't outdo Indians. They won't understand what it means, you know.

00:29:54.171 --> 00:29:59.587
They may say it's Freud, this, that, but they don't understand, it is so anti-God.

00:29:59.596 --> 00:30:02.429
Actually I did not know till the other day,

00:30:02.499 --> 00:30:06.105
when Rustom told me, with great hesitation, what it means, really.

00:30:07.711 --> 00:30:12.144
So that is what it is and we have to understand this.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:17.875
Today is the great day of holiness. Let us celebrate the birth of Christ in our Agnya Chakra.

00:30:17.881 --> 00:30:27.594
And let us sing praise of Him so that He, in His pure essence, in His holy body, He should be there.

00:30:27.604 --> 00:30:32.153
Not Christianity and neither Freudian nonsense!

00:30:32.173 --> 00:30:35.951
Christianity is equally bad as Freud.

00:30:36.038 --> 00:30:37.903
There is no difference, I find.

00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:40.951
Whether you kill the child with the mountains falling on him or

00:30:41.028 --> 00:30:48.402
with a horrible stinky, dirty-smelling breeze blowing on him,

00:30:48.451 --> 00:30:53.534
it's just the same. So please get rid of both ideas - absolutely.

00:30:53.624 --> 00:31:02.413
And in purity you respect Him. Absolutely in purity, because He is purity.

00:31:02.442 --> 00:31:08.294
Now you may say that, "Mother if He is purity..." There are some stupid people who ask me.

00:31:08.364 --> 00:31:11.759
"If He's purity, then how can we make Him impure?"

00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:17.153
But, I mean, if you do not respect Him, why will He be there? He will disappear.

00:31:17.153 --> 00:31:22.295
He likes purity. He will disappear from there! It is not good for you.

00:31:23.913 --> 00:31:30.394
So better create a cradle, a beautiful cradle, of love,

00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:35.675
of honesty, as His Mother prepared for Him,

00:31:35.768 --> 00:31:41.163
with all sweetness and kindness and assurance

00:31:41.278 --> 00:31:48.470
that you will nurture the beauty and the auspiciousness of Christ.

00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:51.103
May God bless you all.

00:31:55.083 --> 00:32:04.710
You can sing. After food we will have a bonfire here and then we can sing a nice, some carols,

00:32:04.728 --> 00:32:10.846
till twelve o'clock and then our great friend

00:32:11.998 --> 00:32:14.961
who is here, Mehrotra,

00:32:14.951 --> 00:32:19.220
he has decided to give you some cakes and tea,

00:32:19.211 --> 00:32:24.471
We'll have some cakes and tea and then you can sleep off.

00:32:24.498 --> 00:32:31.104
And tomorrow morning, as I told you, is the celebration of His birth, in a full way

00:32:31.134 --> 00:32:37.651
by all the people. Not only by you but by Indians and other people who are here.

00:32:39.211 --> 00:32:41.951
You all have to celebrate. It's a very great thing.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.586
And unless and until you show the signs of holiness and auspiciousness

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:54.384
Indians are not going to be impressed by Him, I can tell you this much, not going to be impressed.

00:32:54.461 --> 00:32:58.199
They can't understand these pastors coming here

00:32:58.201 --> 00:33:03.807
and these padres telling them about Christ.

00:33:03.817 --> 00:33:06.769
They just cannot believe it. How can He be like that?

00:33:06.836 --> 00:33:11.567
There's another interesting story, make the whole thing very...

00:33:13.151 --> 00:33:17.019
Once there was a fellow from a village:

00:33:17.048 --> 00:33:20.961
so his name was Bura, means a blondie

00:33:21.048 --> 00:33:24.672
and he came and they said, "You become a Christian,"

00:33:24.682 --> 00:33:27.182
So he said, "Oh, I'll become a Christian."

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:30.554
He made him a Christian. He said, "We have to change the name."

00:33:30.604 --> 00:33:36.173
He said, "But my name is Blondie." He said, "Alright, we'll give you another name." He called him Alexander.

00:33:38.365 --> 00:33:42.942
So his name was Mr. Blondie Alexander, Bura Alexander.

00:33:44.527 --> 00:33:49.509
Now this Bura Alexander used to come to Allahabad

00:33:49.574 --> 00:33:53.490
where always he would go and have his bath in the river Ganges.

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:55.884
So the pastor said, "Now you can't do it.

00:33:55.884 --> 00:33:59.938
Now you are a Christian you can't go and have a bath in the river Ganges."

00:33:59.942 --> 00:34:01.188
He said, "Why?

00:34:02.548 --> 00:34:08.318
I have become a sahib, I have become an Englishman now but I have not given up my religion."

00:34:11.322 --> 00:34:14.311
In his own language he said, "I have not given up my religion.

00:34:14.342 --> 00:34:19.751
It's alright, I know the river Ganges is my Mother and She has got vibrations.

00:34:19.822 --> 00:34:21.574
I am not going to give up that.

00:34:21.603 --> 00:34:26.634
Of course, I have become a sahib now. I have become an Englishman."

00:34:26.652 --> 00:34:30.273
So that's the idea they had about Christianity.

00:34:39.974 --> 00:34:46.188
Any questions you have, you can ask me and then the food is ready, you better go and have your food.

00:34:46.835 --> 00:34:50.197
When you become thoughtless and we.... We don't see clearly

00:34:50.268 --> 00:34:53.706
is that good or..? Because when you are in very nice

00:34:53.715 --> 00:34:57.534
it is difficult for us to see clearly.

00:34:57.538 --> 00:35:00.414
unclear

00:35:00.427 --> 00:35:01.873
You don't see what?

00:35:01.905 --> 00:35:03.213
Visually you mean?

00:35:14.168 --> 00:35:18.188
He says when he is in thoughtless awareness he cannot see clearly anymore.

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:20.128
Really?

00:35:21.362 --> 00:35:25.172
I think you must be seeing more than what you seen normally!

00:35:26.172 --> 00:35:32.434
Alexander is correct. When you are thoughtlessly aware your eyes, you see the pupils, are dilated.

00:35:32.445 --> 00:35:36.951
It's correct. But you take it higher, the Kundalini, slightly higher. Push it up.

00:35:36.985 --> 00:35:41.849
Alright? If Kundalini is staying at thoughtless awareness means just dilated, you see

00:35:41.969 --> 00:35:45.639
and the eyes can become black, but there's no sparkle.

00:35:45.699 --> 00:35:48.951
But when it comes out then you find a sparkle in the eyes

00:35:48.989 --> 00:35:52.224
there is a difference in the eyes, if you see.

00:35:52.244 --> 00:36:01.514
The eyes get dilated, the pupils get dilated, when the Agnya Chakra is being just penetrated,

00:36:01.614 --> 00:36:05.554
and still here it is, then you can't see clearly. Correct.

00:36:07.364 --> 00:36:10.494
But at thoughtless awareness is all this part.

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:15.128
So if you push it, little up, higher - you know how to push Kundalini with your attention

00:36:15.199 --> 00:36:20.422
or you watch here, or you think of Me.

00:36:20.429 --> 00:36:22.773
Kundalini will go up.

00:36:22.777 --> 00:36:23.958
Alright?

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.532
So thoughtless awareness is just the beginning.

00:36:26.492 --> 00:36:32.952
And it's a great area, up to this point, up to Shri Krishna point, where you become the witness.

00:36:33.032 --> 00:36:37.492
From the witness point, when you become here, then there is a sparkle in your eyes,

00:36:38.882 --> 00:36:40.981
your eyes sparkle.

00:36:41.001 --> 00:36:45.442
And the sparkle in the eyes is a sign that Kundalini is flowing well.

00:36:45.512 --> 00:36:48.739
That time you see more than you see normally.

00:36:48.838 --> 00:36:53.525
I mean the stars start looking bigger, everything starts looking much clearer. Alright?

00:36:56.867 --> 00:36:58.561
Better now.

00:36:58.592 --> 00:37:02.097
It's correct, dilatation of the pupil takes place.

00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:06.688
Some people really at that time have opened their eyes and they said, "Oh we have become blind."

00:37:06.697 --> 00:37:12.525
That's true. It happens. It's correct. Alright, now what else? It's a good question.

00:37:17.487 --> 00:37:22.007
Mother, is there any relation between the numbers 888 and Christ?

00:37:23.259 --> 00:37:24.931
Three eights,

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:28.853
888, there could be.

00:37:28.864 --> 00:37:29.884
There could be.

00:37:29.902 --> 00:37:33.068
But what is the relationship you have found out?

00:37:33.072 --> 00:37:36.844
Many years ago I was looking at the Hebrew Kabbalah

00:37:36.853 --> 00:37:41.083
and they had a system of different numbers that they combine.

00:37:41.083 --> 00:37:42.534
Kabbalah!

00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:45.847
That is. That they must be having 888 is alright.

00:37:45.844 --> 00:37:51.364
Because, you see, their chakras don't move in 6 form.

00:37:51.436 --> 00:37:57.811
That is that they should move, but they move in 888 because you see,

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:01.760
the 8 we don't have any chakra, so they are on the sides.

00:38:01.842 --> 00:38:05.221
They are on the Left Side, Kabbalah is on the left hand side,

00:38:05.322 --> 00:38:08.623
so they work it out on 8 -  means from outside.

00:38:08.722 --> 00:38:14.813
7, 3, 4

00:38:14.893 --> 00:38:16.956
are in the centre.

00:38:16.963 --> 00:38:20.293
Now at the 6 point,

00:38:20.313 --> 00:38:25.179
if you have 666, means absolutely both the Swadishthana

00:38:25.181 --> 00:38:28.199
on both the sides you occupy.

00:38:28.215 --> 00:38:33.195
And also in the centre, so you hit all these three, that's why this number is not good.

00:38:33.255 --> 00:38:48.371
And 888, you go onto Left Swadishthana more and use your Mooladhara,

00:38:49.125 --> 00:38:51.375
it works out with Mooladhara.

00:38:52.445 --> 00:38:58.025
It's a funny one, because 4 into 2 is 8, alright?

00:38:58.074 --> 00:39:05.980
And 4 into 2 comes where your 4 is Mooladhara. Alright?

00:39:06.025 --> 00:39:12.282
Instead of going to Swadishthana, you just combine Agnya and Mooladhara,

00:39:12.313 --> 00:39:14.773
in such a way that you go outside.

00:39:15.603 --> 00:39:16.952
Alright?

00:39:16.947 --> 00:39:19.541
Say you put your Agnya, is two,

00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:24.387
From 2 you move this side.

00:39:25.014 --> 00:39:27.054
Alright? That's all.

00:39:28.317 --> 00:39:31.021
Kabbalah is a very dangerous thing, one should never try.

00:39:31.072 --> 00:39:35.210
Then you start seeing things, future and all that, isn't it?

00:39:36.472 --> 00:39:42.902
That's not a good thing at all. So, for us, the number is 7, 3,

00:39:42.922 --> 00:39:46.012
is the best number, 7 and 3 number.

00:41:02.822 --> 00:41:05.887
What else?

00:41:05.898 --> 00:41:08.782
I would like to pick up on Alexander's question.

00:41:08.853 --> 00:41:36.105
A yogi asks a question about  his eyesight. Does it have anything to do with Agnya?

00:41:37.253 --> 00:41:43.237
Yes, yes of course. I mean, Agnya is very important and best way is to take your Kundalini up.

00:41:44.467 --> 00:41:47.635
Don't roam about in Agnya - it's very dangerous.

00:41:47.657 --> 00:41:51.804
You can be thrown, as he said, on the 4, 4, 4 side,

00:41:51.893 --> 00:41:58.693
or you can go this side 6, 6, 6, 6. It works out 6, 6, 6, 6 this side and 4, 4, 4, 4 this side.

00:41:58.793 --> 00:42:03.393
It's dangerous. Never go. You see Agnya you should be very careful.

00:42:03.431 --> 00:42:08.065
You should never roam about in Agnya because it's thrown out, the attention is thrown out,

00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:08.994
projected.

00:42:09.023 --> 00:42:13.034
You start seeing things all problematic, very problematic.

00:42:17.333 --> 00:42:20.172
Try to take your Kundalini out all the time.

00:42:20.253 --> 00:42:23.543
See that it's coming out. Put your attention there.

00:42:23.612 --> 00:42:28.387
And the best is, now, is to put your attention to me, because I am at Sahasrara.

00:42:30.306 --> 00:42:35.876
And don't allow your Kundalini to remain in Agnya part it's dangerous,

00:42:38.806 --> 00:42:39.717
no doubt.

00:42:43.835 --> 00:42:49.737
You have become subtler and you can start moving left and right if you want to, and if you try to.

00:42:51.806 --> 00:42:54.458
Any other question?

00:43:04.717 --> 00:43:20.356
I don't understand one thing: that is the connection of images like are described in certain books and our thoughtless state.

00:43:20.344 --> 00:43:26.068
Alright, I'll tell you. If you start closing your eyes, say you are sleepy,

00:43:26.088 --> 00:43:32.010
and you start seeing images at that time. That means you are going on to the Left Side

00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:37.094
there are dead bodies, you start seeing their faces, this, that. You are going to the Left Side.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:44.864
Now supposing you start seeing lights and stars and this and that - all sorts of things,

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.670
I mean, more the colours, we should say - you are moving on the right hand side.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.911
So try to avoid it. Say, "I don't want it," you should say.

00:43:51.918 --> 00:43:59.228
And you try to put your Agnya - if it is left, you put it to the right side or if it is right - just by pushing it.

00:43:59.248 --> 00:44:02.757
Like this and like that.

00:44:02.777 --> 00:44:10.101
But what happens that, after some time, when you have achieved a certain state of higher consciousness

00:44:10.161 --> 00:44:13.751
then, if you want, you can penetrate into these areas,

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:19.302
you can see all these things. But then you something, different type of things you see, for example,

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:25.835
you might see from my Sahasrara - huge, big these valayas coming out,

00:44:25.905 --> 00:44:29.215
or something like that. That's a different point altogether.

00:44:32.364 --> 00:44:38.300
And also sometimes you might see a little flame

00:44:38.315 --> 00:44:42.110
that's a good sign, that means somebody's guiding you.

00:44:42.099 --> 00:44:43.900
But you have to be careful

00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:48.271
not to indulge into these things because there is a guidance for you

00:44:48.286 --> 00:44:55.800
and you are all followed by great Deities, no doubt, but you should not try to sort of hanker after that.

00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:59.739
If they are there, let it be, because you see your Agnya is very important.

00:44:59.777 --> 00:45:03.134
You should not allow your Agnya to be attracted by these things.

00:45:03.168 --> 00:45:09.833
You might just find a flame, like that. Sometime you might just find a little dot: shining dot.

00:45:09.842 --> 00:45:15.262
They are all actually angels who are with you and try to assure you.

00:45:15.322 --> 00:45:17.081
But that's not important.

00:45:17.092 --> 00:45:23.032
What is important is, on your way, you should go further and do not go this side or that side.

00:45:25.362 --> 00:45:32.005
But if you are seeing every day those images then try to push it back, or this way, whichever way it is

00:45:32.074 --> 00:45:38.070
and try to finish them, so that you go further. That means you are sticking on to the same point,

00:45:38.114 --> 00:45:41.650
or you are moving in the other direction on the sides.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:46.041
Because direction should be further and further and further.

00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:55.329
What else?

00:46:00.041 --> 00:46:04.896
How should we protect our subconscious as we cannot be conscious about it?

00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:07.405
You need not. I mean,

00:46:08.914 --> 00:46:12.333
you don't have to worry!

00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:16.119
You just keep to the conscious. Alright?

00:46:16.688 --> 00:46:22.021
You don't protect anything, actually you don't do anything, if you see Alexander what do you do?

00:46:24.722 --> 00:46:26.391
We are just enjoying!

00:46:26.402 --> 00:46:27.501
Yes, just enjoy.

00:46:27.512 --> 00:46:30.282
That's the best part. Just enjoy!

00:46:31.215 --> 00:46:34.326
Just I want you to enjoy.

00:46:35.106 --> 00:46:38.916
Don't create problems for yourself that's all, and just enjoy. Alright?

00:46:38.925 --> 00:46:41.565
Just don't create problems for yourself.

00:46:43.023 --> 00:46:46.434
Don't be ambitious. Don't be aggressive.

00:46:46.443 --> 00:46:51.813
And don't be, I mean that's rarely so, but submissive too much to others.

00:46:51.884 --> 00:46:57.202
That's rarely so. But be submissive to Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:57.231 --> 00:47:00.851
Be surrendered to Sahaj Yoga.

00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:09.436
I would like to know who are the people from Perth. Can you get up?

00:47:09.467 --> 00:47:11.126
People from Perth?

00:47:15.197 --> 00:47:17.233
So, give me your names.

00:47:17.304 --> 00:47:18.023

00:47:18.373 --> 00:47:19.704
Robin Reid

00:47:19.713 --> 00:47:20.733
What's yours?

00:47:25.152 --> 00:47:26.483

Now, who else is there?

00:47:28.284 --> 00:47:30.376
Sit down. Sit down all of you.

00:47:31.465 --> 00:47:33.485
I can't see you. Come forward. Please.

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:39.065
Michael Reid

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:46.014
Mother there's a family, mother, father and two sons.

00:47:46.114 --> 00:47:46.954

00:47:46.972 --> 00:47:51.297
Mother's here, father was Robin and the two boys.

00:47:51.293 --> 00:47:53.954
Mother and father, where is he?

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:56.068
Father and

00:47:56.077 --> 00:47:58.847
two boys. There's one here, the other boy... Is Tim here?

00:47:58.938 --> 00:48:00.268
Ah nice.

00:48:00.327 --> 00:48:01.898
Come forward, I can't see

00:48:02.768 --> 00:48:05.485
So what's your name? What's the mother's name?

00:48:05.505 --> 00:48:07.233
Jo. Alright.

00:48:07.266 --> 00:48:09.536
So this is what I wanted to know.

00:48:09.635 --> 00:48:12.155
Please be seated.

00:48:14.134 --> 00:48:18.583
Who are the Sahaja Yogis who are seeing me for the first time in India?

00:48:27.773 --> 00:48:28.972
In India?

00:48:29.063 --> 00:48:29.992
In India.

00:48:34.371 --> 00:48:37.469
I mean, I don't mean that.

00:48:39.277 --> 00:48:45.739
I mean for the first time, because after coming to India, because you've seen me before. Alright.

00:48:46.179 --> 00:48:51.414
So, apart from Perth, now let's see.  What's your name?

00:48:51.443 --> 00:48:53.369
Julie

00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:54.760
From where are you?

00:48:55.146 --> 00:48:56.166
From Sydney?

00:48:57.605 --> 00:48:59.885
Loudly.

Robert Webber from Adelaide.

Good.

Guillaume

00:49:27.568 --> 00:49:28.177
Guy

00:49:31.998 --> 00:49:34.155
It's G U Y

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:36.744
It's pronounced ghee like ghee.

00:49:36.775 --> 00:49:37.594
Guy, alright.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:39.360

00:49:48.112 --> 00:49:48.742
Sydney.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.079
Sydney! Sit down, please.

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:55.076
So, who's that? Come forward.  I can't see.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.480
In the light. Yes please.

00:50:01.382 --> 00:50:02.141
Gillian

00:50:02.581 --> 00:50:04.958
Gillian Walker from Sydney.

00:50:05.009 --> 00:50:05.539
Alright.

00:50:05.592 --> 00:50:07.052
John Williams from Sydney

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.152
Good

00:50:11.612 --> 00:50:15.427
So now, I will be going to Sydney

00:50:20.045 --> 00:50:21.635
He's from Mexico.

00:50:21.849 --> 00:50:23.204
From Australia really.

00:50:23.554 --> 00:50:26.902
He is, yes. What's his name?

00:50:28.012 --> 00:50:29.632
Martin Moliere

00:50:31.181 --> 00:50:33.380
May God bless you. From Sydney?

00:50:33.378 --> 00:50:40.639
There are two boys, Martin and Peter who just stood up, both of whom originally came from Mexico and they've been in Australia for about 10 years.

00:50:43.672 --> 00:50:50.652
So now, we have... we have met now here

00:50:50.795 --> 00:50:56.768
I am going now this time to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide.  What else?

00:50:56.869 --> 00:51:01.434
We're going to Perth on the 1st and then to Adelaide about the 4th

00:51:01.445 --> 00:51:09.193
then to Melbourne on the 11th and then to Sydney about the 15th.

00:51:09.264 --> 00:51:18.139
then you are returning on the 23rd, 22nd, 23rd after Your birthday which will be celebrated on the 21st in Sydney.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.818
If we may Mother?

00:51:30.152 --> 00:51:32.882
Very successful with the doctors.

00:51:32.898 --> 00:51:34.237
Rustom has been Mother.

00:51:34.262 --> 00:51:35.702
What happened Rustom?

00:51:39.166 --> 00:51:40.775
Only 3?

00:51:41.922 --> 00:51:45.751
3 or 4 but one of them could feel

00:51:45.782 --> 00:51:50.496
and as there were some patients and as I was treating they could feel the chakras moving.

00:51:50.606 --> 00:51:56.807
So that convinced them.  And as we said mantras we could feel the cool vibrations flowing.

00:51:56.818 --> 00:51:59.539
But this Dr Ahuja is a good lady.

00:51:59.581 --> 00:52:08.581
The other chap is a Sardarji. His name is Sampurna Singh.  He felt it too and the other could feel a little bit.

00:52:08.608 --> 00:52:12.538
He's coming tomorrow, because he wants to find out more.

00:52:12.628 --> 00:52:18.969
But tomorrow, I don't know what time we'll have a chance to talk to them, because, we are all going for a picnic tomorrow.

00:52:21.063 --> 00:52:22.452
Vaneshwara

00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:29.302
there's a river there, you can go and enjoy yourself and then you have to climb up.

00:52:30.302 --> 00:52:33.143
Very close by, I think you have seen the place there.

00:52:33.998 --> 00:52:39.646
And maybe that we might get a place in that garden, now for our ashram.

00:52:39.659 --> 00:52:40.559
Maybe.

00:52:44.876 --> 00:52:50.054
We're thinking of having a camp there.

00:52:51.094 --> 00:52:53.577
But this time we came rather early.

00:52:53.583 --> 00:52:59.447
but next time we might have a camp in that Vaneswara area. When we come back.

00:53:00.492 --> 00:53:02.342
It's a very serene place

00:53:02.413 --> 00:53:04.143
Very serene

00:53:07.574 --> 00:53:13.259
So day after tomorrow is the Puja and I was thinking that... for the Puja Saree though?

00:53:13.264 --> 00:53:19.833
You people want to pay for it.  Australians,  but you should take money from all of them.

00:53:19.853 --> 00:53:22.367
Mother we have done that. We've taken it from all.  That's been done.

00:53:22.373 --> 00:53:24.985
Not only from...  You've done it. Alright.

00:53:24.983 --> 00:53:26.817
and have you paid it.

00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:28.494
Nicholas has already collected it

00:53:28.527 --> 00:53:33.342
Whom are  you supposed to pay?

00:53:33.353 --> 00:53:36.800
Whom are you supposed to pay that money?

00:53:36.889 --> 00:53:42.360
The money comes... Nicholas is collecting it. He's holding all the money, from all the Centres,

00:53:42.369 --> 00:53:48.304
both the Collective money and the individual Centre's money and then he is going to settle up in London.

00:53:48.414 --> 00:53:52.335
No, no, no, no. Oh I see. Oh I see.

00:53:52.322 --> 00:53:53.463
Alright.

00:53:55.155 --> 00:53:56.355
With Rajesh.

00:53:57.293 --> 00:54:00.512
Rustom and Nicholas have that one in hand.

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:02.222
Alright.

00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:18.597
I would like to know where do we have Centres, which are not yet been given any presents

00:54:18.708 --> 00:54:20.677
and who are newly started.

00:54:21.692 --> 00:54:23.791
Raise your hands.

00:54:30.052 --> 00:54:36.155
No, no, no, not for me. I have to buy presents for the new Centres.

00:54:37.155 --> 00:54:38.425
For the new Centres.

00:54:39.847 --> 00:54:46.487
You see for the other things, see the one you have brought for Me.  That's my personal thing.

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:49.873
For which we are going to settle. That's a different thing.

00:54:49.922 --> 00:54:55.208
But this is what presents I have to give to Centres for the Puja

00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:59.585
which I have already given to some people isn't it to Sydney people

00:55:00.987 --> 00:55:04.858
and have I given to Melbourne people anything so far?

00:55:05.608 --> 00:55:11.525
So raise your hands.  All of you whom I have not given to the Centres one for every Collective.

00:55:11.501 --> 00:55:13.333
Say Melbourne

00:55:13.382 --> 00:55:16.496
Adelaide and Perth. Three.

00:55:16.501 --> 00:55:20.186
Three. In Europe?

00:55:21.688 --> 00:55:23.326
He's saying Dublin Mother.

00:55:23.326 --> 00:55:24.114
Dublin.

00:55:24.126 --> 00:55:26.235
Dublin in Ireland he said.

00:55:26.246 --> 00:55:28.815
Alright Dublin, now four

00:55:30.878 --> 00:55:32.847
Toronto, five

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.619
Six. What else?

00:55:39.755 --> 00:55:40.905

That is different. Alright. Six. More? Number 6

Rouen and Poitiere Mother.

00:55:57.568 --> 00:56:00.978
Two cities in France, Rouen and Poitiere

00:56:01.574 --> 00:56:02.766
Are there Centres?

00:56:02.786 --> 00:56:10.815
Poitiere is Laurent's mother and Rouen we have started a very nice Centre

00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:14.661
So now nine.

00:56:14.731 --> 00:56:15.840
What's more?

00:56:15.849 --> 00:56:17.179
Belgium Mother.

00:56:17.201 --> 00:56:19.530
Belgium. Ten.

Los Angelos?

00:56:44.503 --> 00:56:45.672
That we have done.

00:56:49.402 --> 00:56:50.952
New York we have done.

00:56:54.016 --> 00:57:00.376
Again raise the hands. Those who have suggested just now, one each. Come along raise the hands, one each.

00:57:01.786 --> 00:57:04.996
No, no, one each. One hand.

00:57:05.362 --> 00:57:07.467
Yes! Alright two!

00:57:10.659 --> 00:57:13.257
One, from where?

00:57:13.775 --> 00:57:18.715
For England you leave just now... England will have. England you forget. Just now I'm saying.

00:57:18.755 --> 00:57:22.679
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:57:23.179 --> 00:57:24.960
Seven, eight, nine.

00:57:25.757 --> 00:57:29.840
Ten. I counted you?

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:32.268
Did I count you?

00:57:33.193 --> 00:57:34.922
That's Englebert from Austria.

00:57:34.987 --> 00:57:38.166
Just count again.  Again raise your hands.

00:57:47.954 --> 00:57:51.103
What was the tenth one?  There was a tenth. Ah Dublin.

00:57:57.425 --> 00:58:01.833
It is eleven. No, no, no, no.

00:58:01.842 --> 00:58:04.152
He had his two hands up

00:58:04.143 --> 00:58:06.603
No, no! One.

00:58:08.793 --> 00:58:11.222
Keep it eleven. You see eleven is a good number.

00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:13.021
But twelve....

00:58:14.942 --> 00:58:16.632
I have to...

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.570
Lausanne

00:58:19.371 --> 00:58:20.221
Lausanne?

00:58:21.976 --> 00:58:23.706
Yes Lausanne.

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:24.731
It's 11.

00:58:33.061 --> 00:58:37.322
Germany... you see little bit shaky things you better not:

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:41.523
because I have to get something for all these Centres, so let's keep it eleven.

00:58:41.612 --> 00:58:44.083
Now, raise hands of eleven people.

00:58:49.757 --> 00:58:54.893
You see it should be done in a place where you are really definite. Alright?

00:58:55.583 --> 00:58:56.882
Alright.

00:58:57.791 --> 00:58:59.681
You keep it at eleven.

00:59:05.101 --> 00:59:08.621
Where you are definite. Just put it down.

00:59:08.692 --> 00:59:13.846
For English people, we have another way of doing things.

00:59:13.851 --> 00:59:16.181
Now in England how many?

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:18.460
In England?

00:59:20.121 --> 00:59:21.202
John?

00:59:22.476 --> 00:59:25.726
Do you include Derby and places like this Mother?

00:59:27.347 --> 00:59:32.478
Alright. Derby. Scotland is included?

00:59:33.708 --> 00:59:36.936
Alright, raise your hands the English.

00:59:36.945 --> 00:59:39.170
Where you don't have.

00:59:39.239 --> 00:59:40.989
I sent for Derby.

00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:43.489
Alright I've sent for Derby.

00:59:43.496 --> 00:59:47.063
Scotland I have sent already. Alright.

00:59:47.063 --> 00:59:50.362
No, no, no, John I didn't give you anything?

00:59:51.222 --> 00:59:53.648
No, one. From which part?

00:59:53.643 --> 00:59:54.652
Reading.

00:59:54.659 --> 00:59:56.813
One Reading, one

00:59:58.099 --> 00:59:59.208
London he is saying!

00:59:59.273 --> 01:00:00.902
London?

01:00:06.318 --> 01:00:08.547
Who is that?

01:00:09.485 --> 01:00:10.704
He's hiding Mother.

01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:16.204
Nick

01:00:21.864 --> 01:00:29.268
You are the luckiest among of all of them, I may say. Alright, I know what you mean, but that's separate.

01:00:29.449 --> 01:00:30.719
One

01:00:36.692 --> 01:00:41.572
Alright, one, two, three

01:00:41.612 --> 01:00:44.251
Which one is that?

01:00:44.978 --> 01:00:48.713
I've given. Birmingham, Derbyshire.

01:00:50.983 --> 01:00:52.277
Alright.

01:00:53.248 --> 01:00:56.614
So, London...

01:00:59.204 --> 01:01:01.637
I have to think and scratch my head,

01:01:01.806 --> 01:01:06.827
to find what to give to London, because I've given this Mataji to you.

01:01:07.567 --> 01:01:11.929
Now you go and have your food. I have to go out to have my dinner.

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.389
I don't know what will I eat, whatever it is.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.320
Where are my chappals?

01:01:17.972 --> 01:01:37.094
Re-assembled after dinner.  No sound for about 3 minutes.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:57.994
Very beautiful, I must say.

01:03:58.992 --> 01:04:05.260
Little cutting has been little bit, but you can rub it off later on, because in a hurry they have done the whole job.

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:11.411
So this is to wish you Happy Christmas.

01:04:28.126 --> 01:04:30.668
They've done a good job isn't it?

01:04:30.688 --> 01:04:35.449
We never expected. In a factory.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.150
Some are smaller, some are bigger.

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:44.601
It doesn't matter. Whatever comes your way.

01:04:48.681 --> 01:04:52.782
Ladies should take smaller and men should take bigger. That's all.

01:04:58.992 --> 01:05:03.402
Better idea. If you want. It makes no difference.

01:05:36.931 --> 01:05:39.132
This are together.

01:05:42.862 --> 01:05:44.295
All of them?

01:06:04.893 --> 01:06:09.284
You first have for yourself.

01:06:09.304 --> 01:06:11.175
You keep one for yourself.

01:06:11.199 --> 01:06:12.760
One for her.

01:07:25.713 --> 01:07:28.668
Now everybody has got it?

01:07:30.027 --> 01:07:31.757
Who doesn't have?

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.983
No, there are some more coming.

01:07:46.902 --> 01:07:51.512
There are a few sick people Mother.

01:07:51.514 --> 01:07:53.353
How many are sick?

01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:54.864
About four or five.

01:08:02.342 --> 01:08:05.541
Now just go and see how many sick there are,

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:07.335
then let me know.

01:08:17.354 --> 01:08:18.264
Come here!

01:08:26.515 --> 01:08:30.046
These are five for sick people.  See if you have more sick people.

01:08:41.042 --> 01:08:44.091
Now for your Centres which I told you.

01:08:44.113 --> 01:08:45.631
Each.

01:08:45.712 --> 01:08:48.841
You have... one by one. Let's have it.

01:08:51.176 --> 01:08:56.140
Eleven Centres, let's have one by one.

01:08:56.992 --> 01:09:00.341
Where are they? One Centre.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.149
Melbourne

01:09:03.662 --> 01:09:05.153
Vienna.

01:09:08.761 --> 01:09:10.063
Alright.

01:09:11.908 --> 01:09:12.840
Adelaide.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:19.198
Perth

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.029
Melbourne

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:28.488
They're heavy.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.390
Ireland.

01:09:43.313 --> 01:09:44.564
Alright, what is it?

01:09:44.636 --> 01:09:50.792
Rouen Mother, Rouen, or do you want to give it to Lille. Lille is advancing.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:51.761
Rouen.

01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:59.712
No, it's there, where Joan of Arc has been burned by the English.

01:10:07.082 --> 01:10:09.273
Alright, whatever you say.

01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:16.752
One more.

01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:20.242
Belgium

01:10:25.368 --> 01:10:26.551
Who else?

01:10:39.367 --> 01:10:40.796
Which other?

01:10:42.024 --> 01:10:43.287
Sicily.

01:10:45.939 --> 01:10:50.243
Now what happened to one more. We had eleven.

01:10:56.113 --> 01:10:58.002
Where is Patrick?

01:10:59.319 --> 01:11:01.100
He rasied both his hands.

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:05.078
Where has he gone?

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:08.779
Alright.

01:11:15.327 --> 01:11:17.019
Singapore.

01:11:19.618 --> 01:11:24.033
Worried about Singapore. There is no Centre in Singapore.

01:11:24.054 --> 01:11:25.134
Yet. Alright?

01:11:26.502 --> 01:11:31.180
Come along Patrick. So which one?

01:11:31.175 --> 01:11:32.475
It is for which?

01:11:32.484 --> 01:11:33.743
Toronto?

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:36.393
Alright, for Toronto.

01:11:36.394 --> 01:11:41.091
But we should have one for Malaysia, it would be good idea.

01:11:41.078 --> 01:11:44.100
Come along. Where is he?

01:11:57.832 --> 01:12:00.930
Have you got a plate?

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.261
Have you got a plate?

01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:07.591
So now,

01:12:14.603 --> 01:12:16.645
Give me one more plate.

01:12:16.747 --> 01:12:19.827
For whom?

01:12:21.657 --> 01:12:22.697
We sent them inside.

01:12:28.421 --> 01:12:30.720
May God bless you.

01:12:36.256 --> 01:12:39.323
So you may sing the song.

01:12:47.965 --> 01:12:52.211
Let's have the carols first. Let's have the carols

01:12:58.364 --> 01:13:00.835
It's good? Very beautiful.

01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:10.020
Mother we've prepared a couple of other songs for You before the carols.

01:13:10.046 --> 01:13:14.238
Alright, let's have it, Let's have the songs.

01:13:14.309 --> 01:13:19.185
Give me that, give me to read.

01:13:20.368 --> 01:13:26.307
Oh, you know the words of this one Mother, the song from the Heart.

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:37.881
Give him to read also. Let him see.

01:13:44.363 --> 01:13:47.465
So I know the song I think, so now let's have it.

01:13:47.572 --> 01:13:49.942
Oh I see!

01:16:14.626 --> 01:16:17.822
May God bless you. Beautiful!

01:16:38.899 --> 01:16:42.961
Give one to the Indians also, they should see.

01:20:04.337 --> 01:20:14.362
Beautiful.

01:20:14.381 --> 01:20:16.032
Very beautiful.

01:20:16.389 --> 01:20:21.765
that was such a big area, so many names.

01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:28.984
Thanks Mother, by the time we get to the end of the Indian Tour, we'll get it right.

01:20:35.283 --> 01:20:38.604
Alright, thank you very much.

01:20:40.444 --> 01:20:41.832
Beautiful

01:20:43.435 --> 01:20:49.577
Not only that it's composed so well, rendered so well. Beautiful.

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:56.149
May God bless you.

01:23:32.533 --> 01:23:33.792
Beautiful.

01:23:35.233 --> 01:23:38.375
Composition is beautiful, who's done the composition?

01:23:39.944 --> 01:23:43.404
Ahh, great! Thank you very much.

01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:44.801
May God bless you.

01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:03.689
People might find it a little bit faster then the normally given singing it with the piano

01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:14.157
but when people sing it without the piano, it tends to be slower, but this is, I think, about the tempo that it was intended to be sung.

01:24:28.859 --> 01:24:31.582
William Blake composed here.

01:26:54.372 --> 01:26:59.314
Great promise. Thank you very much, again.

01:26:59.935 --> 01:27:02.042
May God bless you.

01:27:11.264 --> 01:27:14.097
So now, what is next?

01:27:17.569 --> 01:27:25.951
We can have a few bhajans. Let's sing some bhajans and then we'll have carols,

01:27:27.643 --> 01:27:31.631
because he was born at twelve. So it's His time.

01:28:26.246 --> 01:28:32.149
Who's the leader?  Ah, sing some Marathi songs. They'll be happy.

01:28:33.018 --> 01:28:35.788
Let's see, we'll have to sing later on.

01:37:41.497 --> 01:37:42.997
May God bless you.

01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:45.127
Great. One better than the other.

01:42:46.951 --> 01:42:49.189
May God bless you.

01:42:58.229 --> 01:43:05.310
We wanted to make some fire for you to celebrate Christmas.

01:43:05.327 --> 01:43:07.746
Where would you like to do it?

01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:09.707
That side?

01:43:11.689 --> 01:43:14.399
Two doors down Mother.

01:43:17.386 --> 01:43:18.827
Two doors down.

01:43:24.759 --> 01:43:27.469
A well known False Guru had an ashram close by

01:43:30.073 --> 01:43:31.715
John, that's already done.

01:44:00.326 --> 01:44:05.527
Now where shall we have it? That side or this side?

01:44:07.912 --> 01:44:11.493
On my right? Already done?

01:44:15.345 --> 01:44:21.020
So let's start singing the carols now, because the light has been lit.

01:44:21.805 --> 01:44:22.777
Where?

01:44:24.707 --> 01:44:25.564
Pick one.

01:44:54.536 --> 01:44:57.073
Where is the host?

01:45:12.404 --> 01:45:14.684
I can't follow your American.

01:45:19.094 --> 01:45:21.724
Come here, I didn't hear you.

01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:09.820
Mahrotra

01:46:09.841 --> 01:46:12.770
Let him come, otherwise we will not start.

01:46:19.231 --> 01:46:20.641
So we'll sing the song.

01:46:57.838 --> 01:47:02.136
So we'll sing some carols 'til he comes here, then we'll cut the cake.

01:47:05.256 --> 01:47:10.237
First of all let's sing the carols until he comes for the cake. He has to cut the cake.

01:47:25.922 --> 01:47:30.564
Now you sing soon, because twelve o'clock, they'll have a big show.

01:47:31.984 --> 01:47:32.984
Let's start.

01:51:34.528 --> 01:51:36.645
Beautiful!

01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:49.051
Think of the cake it's twelve o'clock and then we will be singing all these things around the fire.

01:51:49.072 --> 01:51:51.576
Alright. It's going to be twelve.

01:51:51.586 --> 01:51:54.805
So Mr and Mrs Mahrotra should cut it.

01:51:54.813 --> 01:51:59.948
Come along. This is their day. Come along

01:52:06.779 --> 01:52:08.988
This is from Mataji. Alright.

01:52:15.175 --> 01:52:18.664
So then we have to sing a song to him. Alright? To Mahrotra.

01:53:05.083 --> 01:53:09.713
This is for Mr Mahrotra and Mr Jolly. Alright.

01:53:14.056 --> 01:53:30.938
Now we can have the rest of the carols. Plus they have got a lot of these green for celebrations, of... so better finish it fast.

01:53:32.537 --> 01:53:34.507
And then we are going to have the real ones.

01:53:34.507 --> 01:53:38.783
Alright, so go ahead fast.

01:53:41.479 --> 01:53:44.090
How many there are?

01:53:45.509 --> 01:53:47.780
Alright let's have it.

01:55:56.739 --> 01:55:58.411
Wonderful!

01:55:58.479 --> 01:56:03.819
Great, let's have another one now.

01:58:19.323 --> 01:58:21.122
My voice is........

01:58:21.143 --> 01:58:22.472
not singing.

01:58:23.603 --> 01:58:26.233
Alright, let's have another one.

02:01:25.533 --> 02:01:26.252
I did it.

02:01:27.974 --> 02:01:31.594
That's so good

02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:39.118
You see my voice has gone off, but still I'm trying.

02:01:59.854 --> 02:02:01.867
Now I'll sing a little.

02:03:52.337 --> 02:03:56.720
Nice. Beautiful, this one is a very beautiful one, isn't it?

02:03:56.831 --> 02:04:01.661
Giving you the serenity of the time.

02:05:54.345 --> 02:05:57.666
Very beautiful, very tender

02:05:57.667 --> 02:05:59.586
movement is beautiful.

02:06:04.944 --> 02:06:08.247
You've got all of them?

02:06:13.042 --> 02:06:14.662
How many?

02:06:14.685 --> 02:06:16.533
Now let's have it.

02:09:56.984 --> 02:10:00.055
Let's see that. Celebrate your Christmas.

02:10:06.044 --> 02:10:13.000
Now you all can burn, all of you there's for all those who want to venture. Not me!

02:10:13.706 --> 02:10:19.679
What's that? It's from far off. The kings have brought the presents.

02:10:30.930 --> 02:10:32.649
Is this from England?

02:10:34.043 --> 02:10:39.993
England the Heart, alright. Thank you very much.

02:10:52.077 --> 02:10:55.854
Mr Hari, has brought all these crackers for you.

02:11:02.162 --> 02:11:04.533
Beautiful thing.

02:11:04.993 --> 02:11:10.582
Now the crackers are not yet started. These are just... What do you call them?

02:11:11.372 --> 02:11:12.622
Fireworks.

02:11:12.761 --> 02:11:17.652
Only general name is fireworks, but particular is what?

02:11:19.721 --> 02:11:20.662
Roman Candle?

02:11:20.671 --> 02:11:28.051
No this called as the "Anaar.' It's a tree of pomegranate.

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:53.747
On behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis, who are Shri Mataji's children and saints,

02:11:53.779 --> 02:11:56.988
I'd like to thank and congratulate Shri Mataji

02:11:56.987 --> 02:12:02.197
for the moment when as Mary Maha Lakshmi, She unfurled the Heavens

02:12:02.203 --> 02:12:05.653
and through Her Immaculate Womb gave birth to the Omkar

02:12:05.747 --> 02:12:07.854
The Word of God.

02:12:09.225 --> 02:12:12.283
Thank you very much.

02:12:19.909 --> 02:12:22.279
Wah, wah, wah!

02:12:25.122 --> 02:12:29.712
The package is all ruined because one package was lost in the aeroplane

02:12:33.453 --> 02:12:35.122
Thank you very much.

02:12:38.067 --> 02:12:40.479
There's now going to be one, many more.

02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:45.581
Nice for English to laugh. Come along.

02:12:46.279 --> 02:12:48.828
You go now and do huge one.

02:12:48.831 --> 02:12:51.349
Malcolm and these never laugh.

02:12:54.734 --> 02:12:56.966
We're going to have much bigger ones.

02:12:56.957 --> 02:13:01.256
Come along, Malcolm come along. You must learn how to burn.

02:13:01.256 --> 02:13:03.618
English should try doing this,

02:13:03.698 --> 02:13:06.154
they never talk.

02:13:40.465 --> 02:13:42.725
Go and try.

02:13:42.715 --> 02:13:44.073
You must learn how to do it.

02:14:10.443 --> 02:14:13.273
Come along, try some Natalie.

02:14:15.284 --> 02:14:17.528
You can watch it.

02:14:18.778 --> 02:14:20.398
You can pull?

02:14:23.417 --> 02:14:24.408
Be careful.

02:14:26.215 --> 02:14:28.604
Take some more. Robert take it.

02:14:30.515 --> 02:14:32.975
Come along boys, alright?. All the boys

02:14:35.076 --> 02:14:36.583
All the boys.

02:14:36.564 --> 02:14:38.850
Try your luck.

02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:56.462
In this area no bhoots are going to remain anymore.

02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:23.661
From Melissa. It's from Melissa.

02:15:26.161 --> 02:15:28.091
From Melissa?

02:15:28.930 --> 02:15:31.001
Alright put her name down.

02:15:31.122 --> 02:15:33.162
Put it down her name.

02:15:55.567 --> 02:15:58.989
Write it down. Your name has been written down?

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.569
Alright. Thank you very much.

02:16:04.695 --> 02:16:06.195
You have not got it as yet?

02:16:06.197 --> 02:16:09.188
You haven't got one? Please have it.

02:16:26.667 --> 02:16:29.176
Such a big one!  Too much.

02:17:23.813 --> 02:17:26.040
No bhoots are going to remain in this area.

02:17:26.163 --> 02:17:29.474
All Rajneesh bhoots are going to run away.

02:17:36.779 --> 02:17:38.761
Keep away!

02:17:56.956 --> 02:18:00.236
It's a translation of the  Bhagavad Gita in Italian.

02:18:00.236 --> 02:18:00.949
You did it?

02:18:00.959 --> 02:18:01.680
Yes Mother.

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:03.119
Oh great!

02:18:04.279 --> 02:18:09.761
Great. I think this you must keep it in my room.  Keep it with you.

02:18:24.689 --> 02:18:26.139
A very big one.

02:18:33.084 --> 02:18:34.820
Such a laughing bunch.

02:18:43.861 --> 02:18:46.191
Don't keep too near.

02:18:51.259 --> 02:18:54.495
That's great thing they have in India, isn't it, to celebrate.

02:18:55.736 --> 02:18:58.619
This is the place... country where you can really celebrate things.

02:18:58.709 --> 02:19:00.835
Look at this beautiful thing.

02:19:01.636 --> 02:19:04.286
What nice things.

02:19:10.193 --> 02:19:12.245
Are you happy now?

02:19:16.465 --> 02:19:18.584
I hope you are comfortable, both of you.

02:19:18.623 --> 02:19:21.453
This is not such a comfortable place.

02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:25.379
Such a big one actually.

02:19:25.430 --> 02:19:26.826
Terrific people.

02:19:32.335 --> 02:19:36.699
In this area no bhoots are going to remain any more.

02:19:38.638 --> 02:19:40.341
Already he's not been.

02:19:40.352 --> 02:19:42.174
You see he's finished.

02:19:42.171 --> 02:19:43.692
Yes what's this?

02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:46.021
From where?

02:19:46.049 --> 02:19:47.360
From Vienna.

02:19:47.430 --> 02:19:48.760
Thank you.

02:19:50.588 --> 02:19:51.843
So beautiful!

02:19:54.445 --> 02:19:56.825
Keep away from fire.

02:19:58.476 --> 02:20:00.183
Keep away from fire.

02:20:01.766 --> 02:20:02.906
Don't throw.

02:20:05.987 --> 02:20:09.519
There's something on near the fire and it will burst out suddenly.

02:20:14.608 --> 02:20:16.788
Use a barge pole.

02:20:19.358 --> 02:20:20.688
There are so many more.

02:20:22.132 --> 02:20:23.346
Take all this.

02:20:26.563 --> 02:20:29.183
Just take this.

02:20:41.391 --> 02:20:43.421
Just take that. It's tremendous.

02:20:43.474 --> 02:20:45.611
From your Brighton Sahaja Yogis

02:20:45.611 --> 02:20:46.652
What is it?

02:20:46.709 --> 02:20:48.143
I don't know.

02:21:08.958 --> 02:21:10.236
Tremendous!

02:21:11.988 --> 02:21:15.331
So many he brought. So sweet of him.

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:17.581
You burnt yourself?

02:21:19.246 --> 02:21:21.147
Come here.

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:35.263
There are so many more. Take all these.

02:21:39.081 --> 02:21:42.574
You burnt yourself. Be careful.

02:21:42.654 --> 02:21:44.984
Mother everyone will start burning.

02:21:46.941 --> 02:21:47.842
Everybody's what?

02:21:47.952 --> 02:21:51.612
Everyone will start to burn themselves when they know that you will...

02:22:02.056 --> 02:22:03.834
There's so many are there too.

02:22:08.875 --> 02:22:10.795
They are called as Tartadi.

02:22:10.896 --> 02:22:15.459
You see all of them have names in India. It's very popular thing.

02:22:53.970 --> 02:22:55.772
Sahasrara

02:23:25.952 --> 02:23:29.129
There is hot tea for all of you.

02:23:30.262 --> 02:23:32.932
You can go and have your hot tea.

02:25:35.521 --> 02:25:37.308
Very good.

02:25:53.958 --> 02:25:56.179
Be careful!

02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:12.831
Beautiful!

02:27:03.994 --> 02:27:07.384
That's a common thing. So many must be there. Find these.

02:27:11.664 --> 02:27:14.938
All of you can do as the girls are doing.

02:27:17.828 --> 02:27:20.609
Just try. There will be many.

02:27:21.889 --> 02:27:25.519
They have brought, but I don't know by what.

02:27:27.254 --> 02:27:30.023
There, there Phuljhadi. These are.

02:27:32.103 --> 02:27:34.873
Below that, just see what this is.

02:27:42.835 --> 02:27:45.546
Here they are.

02:27:45.667 --> 02:27:49.038
These are something else. Let me see.

02:27:53.556 --> 02:27:54.756
Chukhas

02:27:55.447 --> 02:27:59.018
These are chukhas, these go up.

02:28:04.676 --> 02:28:06.496
Ah this is nice.

02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:14.066
Ahh these are the ones. These are atom bombs.

02:28:15.495 --> 02:28:18.227
Very big one. Very big.

02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:23.046
One by one, not to be thrown together.

02:28:30.170 --> 02:28:32.040
These are also...

02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:33.440
These are also the same.

02:28:35.370 --> 02:28:37.139
There are so many more.

02:28:38.132 --> 02:28:40.231
This is the same.

02:28:40.961 --> 02:28:43.268
It's the same. Yes. See that.

02:29:08.593 --> 02:29:11.995
This one is to be watched from close quarters.

02:29:12.095 --> 02:29:15.296
The one is to be watched from very close quarters.

02:29:17.308 --> 02:29:19.827
You all have to have your tea there.

02:29:19.923 --> 02:29:22.433
But are there more like these?

02:30:32.197 --> 02:30:38.836
You can bend it and you can move it over, bent like a chakra.

02:30:40.916 --> 02:30:44.308
You bend on the side and then you can move it like a chakra.

02:30:46.593 --> 02:30:47.823
Like me!

02:30:47.913 --> 02:30:51.102
You must bend it at the end.

02:31:13.536 --> 02:31:20.495
Nylon. Be careful with nylon saris. Nylon saris be careful that's all.

02:31:27.816 --> 02:31:29.927
This one is something interesting.

02:31:29.927 --> 02:31:30.836
Burnt?

02:31:30.927 --> 02:31:31.888
No!

02:31:34.332 --> 02:31:35.935
I know his tricks.

02:31:36.611 --> 02:31:39.584
Alright bring that plate here. Gregoire, bring that plate.

02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:43.093
This plate!

02:31:50.558 --> 02:31:53.977
Matchstick you bring. No, No, you bring that.

02:31:56.093 --> 02:31:58.189
And you put it to this one.

02:32:02.689 --> 02:32:03.959
Is there a matchstick?

02:32:15.004 --> 02:32:16.352
Put the matchstick here.

02:32:20.549 --> 02:32:23.111
See this one Gregoire is interesting,

02:32:23.252 --> 02:32:26.342
You don't get all these in your country?

02:32:26.549 --> 02:32:28.611
I've never seen any.

02:32:28.653 --> 02:32:31.093
Next time you come we will do. We'll organise something.

02:32:31.153 --> 02:32:32.174
Alright.

02:32:38.147 --> 02:32:40.718
Alright you burn one of those.

02:32:40.761 --> 02:32:44.218
You burn one of those. What do you call them?

02:32:45.629 --> 02:32:46.299
Sparklers

02:32:47.209 --> 02:32:49.752
You call them. We call them Phuljhadi.

02:33:04.850 --> 02:33:08.590
If one starts burning it is sufficient.

02:33:09.775 --> 02:33:11.566
Now you just touch it.

02:33:11.566 --> 02:33:12.996
Now see!

02:33:23.583 --> 02:33:25.054
Touch others.

02:33:30.969 --> 02:33:32.039
Touch others.

02:33:36.759 --> 02:33:38.365
You must touch.

02:33:39.748 --> 02:33:40.459
Hot part.

02:33:43.171 --> 02:33:45.050
Now, done, done, done.

02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:46.451
That's it?

02:33:52.877 --> 02:33:53.888
Now the other.

02:33:56.174 --> 02:33:58.745
Here now on other side.

02:34:03.933 --> 02:34:06.430
I hope this thing goes away.

02:34:11.290 --> 02:34:13.290
It's interesting isn't it?

02:34:16.227 --> 02:34:17.780
It's called as snake.

02:34:22.075 --> 02:34:25.799
Very strange they are. There are stranger things available.

02:34:36.058 --> 02:34:39.183
Another one. There's one still left now.

02:34:51.441 --> 02:34:52.885
One more I think.

02:34:56.895 --> 02:35:01.700
There are so many now in this one. You can burn it on the ground. Go!

02:35:07.129 --> 02:35:08.653
Go and burn it.

02:35:09.191 --> 02:35:12.290
It's very interesting. Show it to everyone. Go.

02:35:12.833 --> 02:35:15.299
They are all the snakes.

02:35:17.773 --> 02:35:20.450
If you want to eat snake you can have.

02:35:21.254 --> 02:35:24.644
Mother I have got one swollen finger.

02:35:46.393 --> 02:35:47.813
It was great fun.

02:35:51.027 --> 02:35:54.287
Go and have your tea. Tea's served over in the stalls there.

02:35:54.897 --> 02:35:57.677
All can go and have some tea there.

02:36:11.415 --> 02:36:15.316
It was very enjoyable, a real Christmas.

02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:17.438
So Happy Christmas to you.

02:36:19.487 --> 02:36:22.337
Thank you very much.

02:36:41.533 --> 02:36:46.913
Such cold hands. I thought what's crawling up my feet

02:36:48.047 --> 02:36:52.940
It's Sahaja Yogi's hands. Great.

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:56.931
How was that? Good. Wonderful!

02:36:58.763 --> 02:37:01.647
What's the matter? What are you wearing?

02:37:01.658 --> 02:37:04.058
I've got a fever Mother.

02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:15.190
Good.

02:37:58.836 --> 02:38:01.457
Alright. You're alright now.

02:38:08.816 --> 02:38:10.788
You want some medicines?

02:38:13.344 --> 02:38:15.236
I'll give you some tonight.

02:38:22.733 --> 02:38:24.450
Wonderful it was.

02:38:48.913 --> 02:38:53.781
So, Derek, what do you say of this?

02:38:53.852 --> 02:38:58.143
So sweet of Hari to bring all these things down here, for you to celebrate.

02:38:58.173 --> 02:39:04.710
Now we've done with everything.  Are you sure there isn't... nothing here?

02:39:16.252 --> 02:39:19.788
This one you have to put it in the room, all this.

02:39:24.379 --> 02:39:29.987
In this country, nobody is going to say anything, "Why are you making noise?" Or anything.

02:39:29.994 --> 02:39:33.638
Nothing, you can do what you like.

02:39:49.913 --> 02:39:52.932
Did you see the snake?

02:40:03.412 --> 02:40:05.388
See the snake coming out.

02:40:14.147 --> 02:40:17.076
Here we have very large one. Very big, huge.

02:40:22.108 --> 02:40:30.102
They used to get it from, I think Japan. Now they have started making their own.

02:41:03.281 --> 02:41:08.772
Just a... see making you happy.

02:41:22.592 --> 02:41:24.379
It was a good idea.

02:41:33.903 --> 02:41:35.710
Don't go near it.

02:41:36.191 --> 02:41:40.674
Don't go near it. Throw it from distance.

02:41:45.933 --> 02:41:47.807
Beautiful!

02:42:04.188 --> 02:42:07.773
Now those who would like to...

02:42:07.870 --> 02:42:13.722
just... Oh God! Still working.

02:42:35.833 --> 02:42:37.683
Finished now?

02:42:49.879 --> 02:42:56.268
So it was a good idea, everybody liked it this saree?

02:42:56.279 --> 02:43:02.486
The designer, they did verify it.  Handmade, done by hand.

02:43:28.393 --> 02:43:32.157
Now this is the one who has given us, let's sing one for him.

02:44:23.545 --> 02:44:26.075
So nice of She to have arranged it.

02:44:28.271 --> 02:44:32.262
He! He's the one who has arranged all these things you see,

02:44:32.281 --> 02:44:37.167
for killing all the rakshasas of this place.

02:44:46.930 --> 02:44:49.209
He's enjoying it very much here.

02:44:51.858 --> 02:44:53.486
He did. He's enjoying it.

02:44:58.398 --> 02:45:02.260
So good morning to all of you.

02:45:03.671 --> 02:45:18.126
You better all sleep. Tomorrow morning you have to go. If you want to have a little bit of that, then have a little fomentation if you want.

02:45:18.138 --> 02:45:22.236
And then you can sleep off.

02:45:47.558 --> 02:45:49.549
Is the fire worrying you?

02:45:49.549 --> 02:45:54.025
No, no I'm just thinking that, once it is over...

02:45:54.016 --> 02:45:55.808
The lawn?

02:45:56.198 --> 02:46:02.790
Lawn doesn't mind anything, but once it is over then.

02:46:03.709 --> 02:46:10.379
It's alright. There's no danger to anyone. You can tell the caterer that you are leaving the fire like that.

02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:14.391
That he can look after.

02:46:20.180 --> 02:46:23.490
Some of you have to carry these things.

02:46:30.727 --> 02:46:32.332
Thank you very much all of you.
