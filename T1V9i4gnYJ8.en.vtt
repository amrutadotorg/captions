00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.441
Interviewer: Good evening, it is very
strong feeling that so many times

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:09.524
we are in another country although we are
in this country.

00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:14.006
Tonight we have the opportunity of really
make a long travel.

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:18.696
A long travel in wisdom, in distance,
in space,

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:22.750
in our hearts, in truth. This is all
the elements

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.905
that are concentrated in the presence
of a Holy Mother

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:30.992
that we have invited here, and we are very
grateful that we have You…

00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:35.148
… all the way from one of the oldest
civilizations.

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:40.459
You know, we are very proud that we are
members of a very old civilization…

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.953
And very rarely we realize how other old
civilizations

00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:48.605
shine in other places on the world. So we
do welcome You here

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:52.468
along with the truth You carry for us.

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:56.898
We would like to ask You about this truth,

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.583
and the way You see in this same world,

00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:04.685
this other country which is every country
which is our heart.

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:09.374
We have to know one thing, what is
the truth is.

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:13.245
The truth is actually we are not this body,
mind,

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:19.223
intellect, emotions, ego, but we are
the Spirit.

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:23.675
And in our evolutionary process we have
reached the stage

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:28.627
of human awareness, and beyond this there’s
a little breakthrough

00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:34.272
by which we have to become the Spirit.
That’s very simple

00:01:34.473 --> 00:01:39.288
and can be done very easily for people who
are seeking the truth.

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:42.302
How would you describe the system of your
thought,

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:46.861
the system that you approach to our hearts
and our minds?

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:52.366
Yes. You’ll be amazed to know that
in Greece people called a bone Sacrum,

00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:56.460
which is the triangular bone, and that
means they knew

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.913
there was something sacred about that bone.

00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:05.366
Now this bone has got within itself
a residual power

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:11.881
which is for our connection to this
all-pervading divine power.

00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:16.475
All the scriptures have talked about
all-pervading divine love and everything,

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:21.913
but we have never felt it before.
It’s a surprising thing

00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:24.464
that we take all living things for granted,

00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:27.909
for our heart beats, we don’t know how
it beats.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.327
Then you see the flowers grow, we don’t
know how it grows.

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:38.646
But if you understand that there is some
power which is doing all this living work

00:02:38.847 --> 00:02:43.463
then the time has come for us to know it,
to feel it,

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:47.215
to understand it, and also to use it.

00:02:47.536 --> 00:02:50.283
How do You think that people have arrived

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:53.593
in so many conclusions that they call
religions,

00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:56.739
and what is the connection between this way
of approaching

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.675
ourselves to the truth which is one,

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:04.045
and Your old tradition in Your country
which I assume is India?

00:03:04.245 --> 00:03:09.700
No, in all the religions and scriptures
is written that you have to transform,

00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:13.710
you have to be born again. Every religion
has said that.

00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:16.768
This is not only that any particular
religion has said it.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:20.741
Every religion, even Islam has said you
have to be a Wali.

00:03:20.942 --> 00:03:23.481
Even Christianity has said you are to be
born again.

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:26.475
I mean there’s no religion which has not
said that,

00:03:26.675 --> 00:03:29.262
but it is not just a certificate.

00:03:29.462 --> 00:03:32.085
You cannot take just a certificate
“I am born again”.

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:37.952
It is something that actualizes by which
you develop a new state,

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:42.928
a new state of your mind, state of your
being by which

00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:48.739
you become the Spirit - and there are
powers of the Spirit which you manifest.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.671
It’s not just talking and giving sermons
and lectures,

00:03:51.872 --> 00:03:56.244
but it is something that’s an actualization,
is a living process.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:04:01.190
I think we Greeks belong to the ... what
we call the East part

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.248
of philosophy, of religions. This is
a system which is mostly esoteric,

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:10.989
this is a very Greek word which is seeking
inside.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.473
I think this is quite relevant and close
to the very ancient Indian tradition.

00:04:15.674 --> 00:04:18.862
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. Interviewer:
Now how close do You think these,

00:04:19.062 --> 00:04:23.191
these very old religious systems are,
I am talking about

00:04:23.391 --> 00:04:27.943
the Pagan, our own ancestors
[Shri Mataji: “Yes”] before Christianity,

00:04:28.112 --> 00:04:34.799
even the Jewish or all the other, Hindu,
Buddhist and the rest You know.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.478
Yeah. You see, specially in Greece you had
the ancient system

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:43.917
of worshipping the Goddess Athena. Now
in Sanskrit Atha means the primordial,

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:48.085
so to us She is the Primordial Mother,
that we call in our language

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:51.097
as Adi Shakti, you see, is the Primordial
Mother.

00:04:51.297 --> 00:04:56.522
And She has, you must have seen a snake
in Her shield and also in Her hand

00:04:56.723 --> 00:05:02.639
that is the symbol of this power within
you, which lies dormant

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.661
in your, in your triangular bone called
as sacrum.

00:05:07.862 --> 00:05:11.182
So the Greeks knew about it, no doubt,
because otherwise

00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:14.600
they would not have called Her Athena and
She must have been...

00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:20.505
in our scriptures She is described very
well, not only that

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:26.584
but Greece is called as Manipur Dwipe,
means the navel of the universe.

00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:31.491
Yes. And certainly it was a surprise for me
to see

00:05:31.692 --> 00:05:34.684
that You come here to preach our own
ancient Gods.

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:40.012
Now, what are You telling us about Athena,
is that the serpents,

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:44.178
serpents with Greek gods are very familiar
creatures…

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.991
… have to do with medicine and others.

00:05:47.192 --> 00:05:51.296
Now what is the message of Athena coming
from You again nowadays?

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:59.178
Athena is the one that, She is the one who
was trying to push Her spear

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.210
into the fontanel bone of Zeus.

00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.038
Now that’s exactly what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:10.122
We think - not we believe, and that we have
proved also -

00:06:10.322 --> 00:06:16.358
that this power which we call as Kundalini,
because it is like a serpent

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:20.809
going into coils, because it’s an energy
that moves like a serpent.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:23.942
You see, more symbolic it is, not
the serpent actually.

00:06:24.143 --> 00:06:28.989
So this is the power which is the reflection
of Athena within us

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:34.483
and when she rises she goes and hits here
and opens out your fontanel bone.

00:06:34.684 --> 00:06:39.014
That’s actualization of the baptism,
as described in Christianity;

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:44.928
by that then you are connected with that
subtle energy which is all-pervading.

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.897
For the first time you start feeling that
cool breeze in your hand

00:06:50.098 --> 00:06:52.577
which is described is the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost.

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:55.660
The Holy Ghost is the same as Athena, but
I think Christians

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.155
could not connect it with that. She is
the same.

00:06:59.356 --> 00:07:03.897
We see that all these sanctities along
history come

00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:07.056
and repeat themselves and transfigurate
themselves

00:07:07.256 --> 00:07:09.147
according to the tradition of peoples.
Shri Mataji: Of course.

00:07:09.347 --> 00:07:12.177
Now You have referred to Yoga and of course

00:07:12.377 --> 00:07:15.577
in this part of the world we are more
or less familiar.

00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:18.685
Now for those who are less, I would like
You to found

00:07:18.885 --> 00:07:22.533
what we are talking now in this Yoga and
give us some ideas

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:26.661
about the wide spectrum of what You would
call Yoga.

00:07:26.862 --> 00:07:30.458
You see, Yoga is when you unite,

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:36.678
is the union between your Self with
the divine is Yoga,

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:40.513
That’s the real spiritual yoga. All other
yogas,

00:07:40.713 --> 00:07:43.494
like physical yoga and all that, is a wee
part

00:07:43.694 --> 00:07:46.963
of what one Patanjali wrote. Is a very wee
part

00:07:47.163 --> 00:07:50.147
that to cleanse your body and all that is
there.

00:07:50.348 --> 00:07:54.690
But there is no need now to do all that.

00:07:54.891 --> 00:08:00.733
First in the modern times what if I have
done any work is this:

00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:03.850
that people used to get self realization,
alright,

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.590
but one Master had only one disciple.
Gradually it started

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.256
in a way that they started talking about it.
From the, I think, 12th century

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:17.722
it became more open. But it has been there
for years together.

00:08:17.922 --> 00:08:21.233
Now when they started talking about it,
they couldn’t give

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.833
en mass realization. They could only give
to one person.

00:08:25.034 --> 00:08:28.175
So the only thing that I have done is
to work out

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:31.542
the permutations and combinations of human
nature

00:08:31.742 --> 00:08:36.428
by which I have understood how to give
en mass realization.

00:08:36.629 --> 00:08:41.052
And that’s the only achievement of modern
Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:41.252 --> 00:08:44.927
Sahaja Yoga is an ancient system in India,
also must have been here

00:08:45.127 --> 00:08:52.241
because the way the sacrum bone is there
and she is having all those things.

00:08:52.442 --> 00:08:57.516
But the practice of that may not have been
so open, might have been secretive

00:08:57.716 --> 00:09:00.852
in those days, when they were giving
realization to people.

00:09:01.052 --> 00:09:04.014
And it’s the ancient times, thousands
of years back, so.

00:09:04.215 --> 00:09:08.100
But in India we have still maintained all
those traditions and things,

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.374
and we still respect and worship the Mother
Goddess. Athena we respect.

00:09:13.549 --> 00:09:15.747
She is called as Adi Shakti, name is
different,

00:09:15.948 --> 00:09:18.788
and She is the Holy Ghost according to us.

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:23.389
Now this works out, is in everyone.
It’s your own power within you

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.088
and it works out and it rises and pierces
through your fontanel bone area.

00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:32.833
It does, it actualizes the experience which
is described

00:09:33.034 --> 00:09:37.176
and that’s what one has to feel, otherwise
it is just talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:09:37.377 --> 00:09:39.866
Any religion has become nothing but talk,

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:42.649
so you see, people are now fed up. They
think what is this

00:09:42.849 --> 00:09:46.405
promising, claiming, nothing happens to us,
we are just the same,

00:09:46.605 --> 00:09:49.670
our forefathers were such and we are just
the same.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.594
But now the time has come. It’s a new age
as I say

00:09:52.794 --> 00:09:57.306
to achieve that state, a new state, where
you become.

00:09:57.506 --> 00:10:03.958
Firstly you become thoughtlessly aware,
means you live in the present.

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:08.491
Thoughts come to you from the past and
from the future.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:12.531
You are dancing on the cusp of the thoughts.
But when this happens,

00:10:12.731 --> 00:10:15.616
the thoughts are separated and in between
the thoughts,

00:10:15.817 --> 00:10:19.960
there’s a space which we call as
the present, which is reality.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.171
Present is the reality because the past
is finished

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:26.475
and the future doesn’t exist so you live
in the present.

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:30.071
When you live in the present, you start
growing spiritually.

00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:35.444
And that’s what happens to you first, that
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:38.626
The second thing happens to you that you
start feeling

00:10:38.826 --> 00:10:42.421
that cool breeze on your hands. Now it’s
medically you know

00:10:42.622 --> 00:10:47.301
that these are the endings
of the sympathetic nervous system.

00:10:47.502 --> 00:10:50.681
So what happens that when, when you get
your realization,

00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:53.143
you start feeling this cool breeze all
along

00:10:53.343 --> 00:10:56.905
and you start feeling those things on your
finger tips.

00:10:57.105 --> 00:11:00.803
Now supposing if you have a problem
in anyone of these centers,

00:11:01.004 --> 00:11:04.202
there are seven centers, five, six and
seven.

00:11:04.403 --> 00:11:05.850
Immediately you feel it on your finger.

00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:08.900
You don’t have to go to doctor for
diagnosis, immediately you know.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.710
Now if you know how to cure it, then
physically you can be cured,

00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:19.850
mentally you can be cured, also all our
human problems

00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:23.553
or I should say all the world’s problems
are because of human beings.

00:11:23.754 --> 00:11:26.497
And all our human problems are because
of our centers

00:11:26.697 --> 00:11:30.009
which are within us. So when this power
rises,

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:33.952
She nourishes them, She integrates them
and corrects them

00:11:34.153 --> 00:11:38.233
so we get physical, mental, emotional
problems solved.

00:11:38.434 --> 00:11:42.569
And then you feel your own peace within
yourself.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.497
But the second thing that you achieve
is a new awareness

00:11:46.698 --> 00:11:51.393
which we call as collective consciousness.

00:11:53.183 --> 00:11:59.296
That is where you can feel not only your
own centers

00:11:59.497 --> 00:12:03.522
but also the centers of others. Now, when
you grow spiritually

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:07.553
then sitting down here you can feel
the centers of anyone,

00:12:07.754 --> 00:12:11.379
sitting down here you can correct
the centers of other people,

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.323
but you have to grow. But in the beginning

00:12:15.523 --> 00:12:22.241
you start feeling the Joy of your being,

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:28.139
because in your heart resides the Spirit.
And Spirit is the source of joy.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.866
It is the source of absolute truth. So you
know also absolute truth.

00:12:33.067 --> 00:12:35.803
Because on your fingertips you can ask
any question

00:12:36.004 --> 00:12:39.538
say, they might say, “Was Christ the son
of God?"

00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:42.835
Alright? Ask the questions - immediately
you start getting

00:12:43.036 --> 00:12:49.303
tremendous vibrations. Surprisingly Athena
is also called as Pallas,

00:12:49.504 --> 00:12:53.361
Pallas means vibrations, means She gives
vibrations, you see.

00:12:53.562 --> 00:12:57.147
So these vibrations will tell you
the absolute truth.

00:12:57.348 --> 00:13:00.108
Because we live in relative world, that’s
why we are fighting.

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:04.139
Once we are in the absolute, there is
no fight, no problems.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:10.188
Now, this once happens you become
collectively conscious,

00:13:10.388 --> 00:13:13.276
then who is the other? Everybody is within
your body.

00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:18.020
You can feel everyone within yourself so
you become a universal personality.

00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:22.098
This is the character of your Spirit,
because Spirit is the reflection

00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:25.757
of God Almighty within you, which is
in everyone.

00:13:25.957 --> 00:13:29.549
But it is just a witness till you are
a realized soul.

00:13:29.749 --> 00:13:33.044
But once you become a realized soul then
it starts manifesting.

00:13:33.244 --> 00:13:38.845
It manifests and you can also raise
the Kundalini of others.

00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:43.185
You can give realization to others.
It’s like if you enlighten one candle,

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:48.309
that candle can enlighten another candle.
So that’s how it spreads.

00:13:48.598 --> 00:13:51.558
It is very interesting. And while You
are talking

00:13:51.758 --> 00:13:56.233
I am writing down certain things that come
in contrast

00:13:56.434 --> 00:13:59.526
to what we are used to in this so-called
western world.

00:13:59.726 --> 00:14:04.936
I am wondering this split between body and
mind that we suffer.

00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:09.685
That is something that you do not suffer of.
It is wonderful how

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:16.226
people in the Far East and of course
their Spirit is not schizophrenic.

00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:19.660
How do You explain, and how can people

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.774
come back together with their own either
body or mind,

00:14:23.974 --> 00:14:27.987
because now in this part of the world,
there is people who live

00:14:28.187 --> 00:14:31.809
for their bodies or who live for their
minds.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.879
They are ignorant. That’s why they are
in darkness, you see.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.378
They think body is very important but
I know people

00:14:37.578 --> 00:14:39.305
who have very good bodies also come to me,
saying

00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:41.879
“Mother, give us peace”, you see, “give us
joy”.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.548
So nobody seems to be satisfied. So, they
are ignorant…

00:14:45.748 --> 00:14:47.872
Interviewer: It’s the other part which is
missing. Shri Mataji: Yes. But with this

00:14:48.073 --> 00:14:52.233
the whole thing gets integrated: your body,
mind, your liver,

00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:57.809
your ego, everything - and the ego just
disappears. You become egoless.

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:02.077
You don’t think you are doing anything. You
think it’s happening, it’s just happening.

00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:07.504
There is another idea that this sort
of a deep research

00:15:07.705 --> 00:15:12.907
brings you into the state of absolute and
maybe this absolute is a monistic idea,

00:15:13.107 --> 00:15:17.023
you feel by yourself or the whole world
is yourself.

00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:21.438
Now listening to You I get the impression
that it is exactly the opposite,

00:15:21.638 --> 00:15:25.733
that you communicate with everybody so
it’s more of a communal approach

00:15:25.933 --> 00:15:30.202
than something which is lonely. And it is –
it is a miracle how

00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:35.372
by coming into yourself you reach out
everybody else.

00:15:35.573 --> 00:15:38.051
Now I think You would agree with me that
it is wrong

00:15:38.252 --> 00:15:41.478
to think of Orient as something mystic,

00:15:41.678 --> 00:15:46.465
as something which is cut off the world.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, it’s universal.

00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:51.087
Now we have 56 nations we are working with
this Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:51.287 --> 00:15:54.824
Specially in Russia surprisingly we have
thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:55.036 --> 00:15:57.017
Interviewer: Very recently?
Shri Mataji: Yes, very recently,

00:15:57.217 --> 00:16:01.374
about three years. Within three years we’ve
got thousands and thousands of them.

00:16:01.575 --> 00:16:06.478
You see, I think in the democratic
countries we had too much time to waste.

00:16:06.678 --> 00:16:11.616
Like you see choices, this, that, all kinds
of problems for nothing at all.

00:16:11.817 --> 00:16:15.645
While they were limited and they had
given up all this nonsense.

00:16:15.846 --> 00:16:18.315
They thought now, whatever is available
is available, like,

00:16:18.515 --> 00:16:21.666
you see there is no solution, So give
it up.

00:16:21.866 --> 00:16:25.059
And that’s how they are very introspective
I think. So Russia has –

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.499
Russia and also Eastern Block people are
in thousands,

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.184
who got realization. Also of course India
they know it,

00:16:32.385 --> 00:16:35.347
so we have in thousands also, I must admit
that;

00:16:35.534 --> 00:16:41.874
but so many countries like Austria, Italy
specially

00:16:42.075 --> 00:16:45.210
is now so fed up with all that’s going on
in Italy,

00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:48.465
that now they have taken to Sahaja Yoga
very strongly,

00:16:48.666 --> 00:16:53.063
and all kinds of people are coming. So
it is something that has to happen,

00:16:53.288 --> 00:16:57.819
was to happen, is already predicted, and
it’s taking place.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:04.629
And tell me - we are referring to countries
with a very strong tradition in religion,

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:10.554
say Italy is a very strong Catholic country,
Russia has an orthodox past.

00:17:10.754 --> 00:17:14.464
How about the very different systems like
Africa, or like

00:17:14.664 --> 00:17:18.163
the United States of America? That,
You know, this is the new world

00:17:18.364 --> 00:17:22.415
in terms of a sharp difference in the way
of thinking and approaching the world.

00:17:22.615 --> 00:17:26.548
How is Your message delivered there?
Shri Mataji: You see, actually

00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:31.467
all these incarnations whether it was
Christ, or Rama, Krishna, Mohammed,

00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:34.591
any one of them... Interviewer: You call
them incarnations of…

00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:40.176
All of them were incarnations, you see -
they were born on the same tree of life,

00:17:40.377 --> 00:17:45.536
of spirituality. All of them, like
beautiful flowers at different times.

00:17:45.736 --> 00:17:47.895
But people plucked the flowers, you see,

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:50.778
and now they are fighting with the dead
flowers.

00:17:50.978 --> 00:17:56.932
So you see that there is though religion
within it’s just outside, you see.

00:17:57.132 --> 00:18:01.665
We’ll go to church, we can do anything,
we can go to a mosque

00:18:01.865 --> 00:18:04.152
we can do anything, we go to temple, do
anything.

00:18:04.352 --> 00:18:07.192
I mean, there’s nothing inside the religion,

00:18:07.393 --> 00:18:11.278
but with this the inside religion is
awakened, and you become righteous,

00:18:11.479 --> 00:18:13.834
really you become an angel, I tell you.

00:18:14.035 --> 00:18:18.666
So tell me, you become an angel, but you
still live in this world…

00:18:18.866 --> 00:18:22.284
…and You know there is some things that
we have - we are used

00:18:22.484 --> 00:18:26.390
in referring when we talk about religions.
And I am wondering

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.938
whether we can refer to this way
of approaching of truth

00:18:30.138 --> 00:18:32.925
and viewing the world as we already know

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:37.176
and I’m trying to refer to certain fixed
ideas.

00:18:37.376 --> 00:18:44.445
Religions have ethics, and they have codes
of living, codes of how you behave,

00:18:44.645 --> 00:18:48.020
how you make love, what is a sin, what is
not a sin.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.378
Now what is Your approach on all these
things?

00:18:50.578 --> 00:18:53.562
See, My approach is such that by all, see,
they have failed completely.

00:18:53.762 --> 00:18:57.921
Nobody does that. Really, it’s a fact,
we should face it.

00:18:58.122 --> 00:19:02.583
Actually when it is within you, then you
become your own master,

00:19:02.783 --> 00:19:05.645
you yourself know, like, I would say
an example:

00:19:05.846 --> 00:19:09.747
supposing I’m holding a snake and there’s
darkness, I can’t see him.

00:19:09.965 --> 00:19:12.489
Now you tell me it’s a snake. I will not
accept, I’ll say

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.140
“No, no, it’s not a snake, I’m holding
a rope, supposing”.

00:19:16.307 --> 00:19:19.100
But if there is little light I’ll
immediately leave it.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.793
You don’t have to tell me anything.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:24.752
In the same way then, when you are
enlightened you see for yourself.

00:19:24.952 --> 00:19:29.661
We have seen people overnight giving up –
overnight giving up drugs.

00:19:29.862 --> 00:19:31.976
Overnight. Once they get realization

00:19:32.176 --> 00:19:34.879
just I don’t have to tell them. They
themselves do it

00:19:35.079 --> 00:19:38.196
because they have their own light, their
own power.

00:19:38.396 --> 00:19:42.113
What is a sinner or a failing person,
for Your way of approach?

00:19:42.313 --> 00:19:44.310
You see it is our ego which tells us that
this is sin,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.536
this is not a sin...
Interviewer: It is our ego.

00:19:46.737 --> 00:19:49.498
And also conditionings, you see. Both
things are there

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.838
that they say this is a sin. For some
Muslim

00:19:52.038 --> 00:19:54.372
this is a sin, for a Hindu this is a sin.

00:19:54.573 --> 00:19:57.474
How can there be different types of sin?

00:19:57.674 --> 00:20:04.012
Sin could be - has to be universal, isn’t
it after all, if it is a sin.

00:20:04.213 --> 00:20:08.069
So when you get your realization, you
realize

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:11.824
that you are now above everything else

00:20:12.024 --> 00:20:14.811
and you just don’t do anything wrong, just
you don’t do it.

00:20:15.012 --> 00:20:17.741
You don’t like it, you just don’t do it.

00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:20.282
But, You see, we have created a world that

00:20:20.482 --> 00:20:23.914
we have constructed this wrong, I mean,
say

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:27.379
you are a Muslim and you have a right
in marrying two, four women

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.739
and in our system this is not accepted.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:34.715
Now, how can you know – how can You know
whether this is correct or not?

00:20:34.916 --> 00:20:39.668
Now see, at that time, when Mohammed
Sahib was there, you see He was attacked,

00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:43.194
it was a tribe and tribes were attacked
all the time.

00:20:43.395 --> 00:20:47.786
And all the young people died and I mean,
there were very few men left

00:20:47.987 --> 00:20:50.957
and He didn’t want prostitution. So He
thought

00:20:51.157 --> 00:20:59.189
is best is - now the - let men can marry
women who are now without marriages.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:02.242
So He believed in the marriage and He said,
“You should marry”.

00:21:02.442 --> 00:21:05.345
Now there were some young girls also, they
couldn’t get husbands

00:21:05.545 --> 00:21:08.806
He said “Still you should marry”, otherwise
they would have become prostitutes.

00:21:09.006 --> 00:21:11.810
So to get rid of that thing he said
“Alright”.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.366
It is what we call in Sanskrit
“samayachar”:

00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:17.009
according to the time the incarnations act.

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:22.936
For example at this time of mine my work
is to give realization, that’s all.

00:21:23.137 --> 00:21:27.733
My, My only job is to give realization
to people, so I have to do that.

00:21:27.934 --> 00:21:32.010
So this is the time – every – like
in a growth of a tree, you see,

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.602
first there are roots, and then there are
shoots and then gradually

00:21:35.802 --> 00:21:39.358
it grows and it comes to a point when
it becomes, say the flowers.

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:42.836
So I call it a blossom time, because
so many flowers

00:21:43.036 --> 00:21:45.569
are becoming fruits. So the time has come.

00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:49.828
Is a time which is ripen for this new age
to come in.

00:21:50.028 --> 00:21:53.576
And without that we cannot solve the problem
of our world.

00:21:53.776 --> 00:21:58.097
I think it is a very pragmatic and very
human way of approaching life,

00:21:58.298 --> 00:22:01.522
and You are right; but let me, let me
insist on that.

00:22:01.723 --> 00:22:06.186
I have, you know, in front of me
a Holy Mother

00:22:06.387 --> 00:22:10.378
with the signs of the way, say, men treat
women,

00:22:10.578 --> 00:22:14.421
you have a very obvious sign that you are
married.

00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:18.538
I’m wondering, does this way of approaching
the world affect the relations

00:22:18.739 --> 00:22:21.402
between men and women? What is the opinion
of...

00:22:21.602 --> 00:22:23.852
No, marriage is very important.
Interviewer: Marriage is very important.

00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:25.856
For us, you see, marriage is very
important.

00:22:26.056 --> 00:22:29.714
This year we had 86 international marriages.
Eighty-six.

00:22:29.914 --> 00:22:31.987
Interviewer: What do You mean international?
Mixed, ok.

00:22:32.187 --> 00:22:34.904
International, between different countries.
I mean, one Greek lady

00:22:35.104 --> 00:22:37.551
was married to a French man, see?
Interviewer: I see.

00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:40.927
Shri Mataji: So – and their children are
realized souls, most of them are,

00:22:41.127 --> 00:22:44.017
very surprising, they are very beautiful
children they get.

00:22:44.217 --> 00:22:49.616
But out of these marriages we – we should
say one percent or two percent

00:22:49.817 --> 00:22:54.514
there’s problem still. But otherwise they
are all very successful marriages,

00:22:54.715 --> 00:22:59.811
beautiful marriages and they enjoy it.
That’s a part of life, one has to marry,

00:23:00.012 --> 00:23:05.491
all this nonsense of not marrying and doing
all these things I don’t believe in it,

00:23:05.692 --> 00:23:09.421
because it’s a natural thing, whatever
is natural has to be there.

00:23:09.622 --> 00:23:14.349
And do You think that, say, the way that
people get married

00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:16.868
in the Jewish tradition is different than

00:23:17.068 --> 00:23:19.034
the way they married in the Methodist
tradition

00:23:19.234 --> 00:23:23.522
- now would You then accept all these
methods that people have,

00:23:23.723 --> 00:23:26.889
or they are used to, or they are born in?

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.069
Shri Mataji: Of what? Interviewer: Or how
people get married,

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.325
according to Your lifestyle?

00:23:32.526 --> 00:23:35.556
You see, in our lifestyle, what we do now,

00:23:35.756 --> 00:23:38.421
supposing somebody wants to marry somebody,
it’s alright.

00:23:38.622 --> 00:23:40.974
If they come and tell me: “Mother, I want
to marry somebody” it’s alright,

00:23:41.174 --> 00:23:44.598
but we see the vibrations and things. And
also I mean there should not be

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:48.317
too much disparity and all that, but as we
say “alright”.

00:23:48.517 --> 00:23:53.094
But supposing they want that we should
select for them, say it is so.

00:23:53.294 --> 00:23:57.387
Then, what we do, one month they are
together in one tour we have.

00:23:57.587 --> 00:24:02.155
In that we, we see their vibrations, we see
their aptitudes,

00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:05.139
we have forms to say what is your aptitude,

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.057
would you like to go to another country,
what country you like,

00:24:08.257 --> 00:24:10.800
what’s your height is, what’s your
education,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.164
and what’s, where have you been before
for seeking, and all that -

00:24:15.364 --> 00:24:19.055
so we get all the complete bio data of that
person.

00:24:19.255 --> 00:24:23.147
And then we suggest that such and such
a person will be alright.

00:24:23.348 --> 00:24:27.366
In one month they see the person, if he/she
suits or not –

00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:30.967
if they don’t they inform, then they can
have another choice,

00:24:31.168 --> 00:24:33.710
whichever way they like. But it is not
at random.

00:24:33.911 --> 00:24:37.272
We little bit guide them because they
should also know

00:24:37.473 --> 00:24:40.452
the background of the person, what sort
of a person he is -

00:24:40.653 --> 00:24:45.858
just you don’t fall in love like that, so
again you get into trouble.

00:24:46.059 --> 00:24:52.858
And I mean, it has worked very well,
because it’s such an understanding

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:56.405
that they are marrying a person whom they
know very well,

00:24:56.606 --> 00:24:59.772
and also they are marrying a person who
will –

00:24:59.973 --> 00:25:04.796
who has got these angelic qualities, you
see, so they do not fail.

00:25:04.997 --> 00:25:08.187
And when they actually realize that after
all this training,

00:25:08.387 --> 00:25:10.909
and after all this hard time you give them
- for their good,

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:14.427
for their sake of their happiness,
certainly -

00:25:14.627 --> 00:25:17.990
that they suit each other, how do they get
married:

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.505
according to their own traditions or
according to a Hindu tradition?

00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:22.548
No, we have what is a Sahaja Yoga style
of marriage.

00:25:22.748 --> 00:25:25.325
Interviewer: There is a mystery as we call it.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no mystery at all,

00:25:25.525 --> 00:25:30.491
there is no mystery in Sahaja Yoga. We talk
about all the centers,

00:25:30.692 --> 00:25:34.840
take the name of all the centers, and all
the deities on the centers,

00:25:35.041 --> 00:25:39.642
and then we say “Now by these centers you
have to be married”;

00:25:39.842 --> 00:25:43.941
and that’s how they have to promise that
they will look after their centers,

00:25:44.141 --> 00:25:47.092
they’ll look after their life in a way

00:25:47.293 --> 00:25:49.936
that should be righteous and that’s how
they get married.

00:25:50.137 --> 00:25:55.085
We have open system. There is no mystery
in Sahaja Yoga. No mystery.

00:25:55.286 --> 00:25:59.397
You see it is very, is very tempting the way
that You approach the world

00:25:59.598 --> 00:26:05.796
because it gives you no doubt that there
is no… nothing in darkness.

00:26:05.997 --> 00:26:09.270
Now, let me take another phenomenon which
is very old but very modern.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.210
We talk about love and people matching with
each other.

00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:15.262
There is two men that want to get, to live
together

00:26:15.463 --> 00:26:18.899
and we call them homosexuals, what is your,
the way You approach that?

00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:21.210
I think it’s rather unnatural.

00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:24.015
Also I have seen people who had this kind
of problems,

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:29.233
they came to Me, they were possessed. A man
was possessed by a woman

00:26:29.434 --> 00:26:34.518
so he wanted to have a man, you see, but
once the possession went away

00:26:34.718 --> 00:26:37.733
he became very normal. Men are very easy -

00:26:37.934 --> 00:26:40.723
they take to married life very easily.

00:26:40.924 --> 00:26:45.903
Women I think if they are homosexuals then
it takes some time to get alright,

00:26:46.103 --> 00:26:49.671
I don’t know. Maybe emotionally they feel
disturbed or whatever it is!

00:26:49.872 --> 00:26:52.874
But men are absolutely alright.

00:26:53.074 --> 00:26:55.792
How would You describe normal and natural?

00:26:55.992 --> 00:27:00.092
Normal person is that a man wants to marry
a woman, is normal.

00:27:00.293 --> 00:27:02.622
In India we cannot even conceive this,

00:27:02.823 --> 00:27:05.726
I’ve never known before this kind of have
happens, you see.

00:27:05.926 --> 00:27:08.446
Do You think it hasn’t happened or we don’t
know of it?

00:27:08.646 --> 00:27:11.894
No, no, we… Maybe in India they might be
doing something.

00:27:12.094 --> 00:27:15.561
But we had never known anyone like that,

00:27:15.762 --> 00:27:18.653
when I was in the medical studies also,
I never knew that such things.

00:27:18.854 --> 00:27:22.004
I am sure that now that You come, You go
around the world and...

00:27:22.204 --> 00:27:26.366
Now of course after coming to the West then
we’ve discovered all this...

00:27:26.567 --> 00:27:29.279
Of course it doesn’t happen only among men,
it happens among women as well.

00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:33.067
Yeah – but I think you see, maybe there may
be some reasons,

00:27:33.267 --> 00:27:37.066
also I met one gentleman who was a guard
of the Queen

00:27:37.266 --> 00:27:41.245
and he became homosexual because his wife
was very nasty,

00:27:41.445 --> 00:27:43.611
and she tortured him very much. So…

00:27:43.811 --> 00:27:46.354
So You think there is always an explanation,
something bad happening.

00:27:46.554 --> 00:27:49.378
Yes, so he thought that it’s better to have
a man, you see,

00:27:49.578 --> 00:27:52.566
no problems, no quarrelling. That’s how
he became,

00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:56.863
but when he came to Sahaja Yoga and he got
completely transformed

00:27:57.063 --> 00:28:00.888
he got a nice wife, now he is having
children, he is very happy.

00:28:01.088 --> 00:28:05.272
So I think it is abnormal conditions and
problems

00:28:05.473 --> 00:28:08.572
that people take to this sometimes.

00:28:08.772 --> 00:28:13.499
There are many reasons for that but it can
be corrected if they want to.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:18.191
If they don’t want you cannot force it. You
cannot force Self realization on anyone.

00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:21.499
But you can accept them as people who try
and to achieve purity…

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.244
Yes, if they want to… But once they come
to Sahaja Yoga they change automatically.

00:28:25.444 --> 00:28:28.232
Can they remain unchanged on these aspects?

00:28:28.432 --> 00:28:30.987
So far we didn’t have anyone like that.

00:28:31.187 --> 00:28:33.020
I see. Now tell me about confession.

00:28:33.221 --> 00:28:37.458
It is, it is something that we are familiar
in Christianity.

00:28:37.658 --> 00:28:40.553
There is someone like, automatically when
you hear

00:28:40.753 --> 00:28:45.710
about a Holy Mother for instance there
comes a time that there is some hierarchy.

00:28:45.911 --> 00:28:49.097
Now how is the hierarchy between mortals
in...

00:28:49.297 --> 00:28:52.942
No, we don’t have anything like that. You
see, when they come to Sahaja Yoga

00:28:53.142 --> 00:28:57.960
mostly the Christians, Catholics and all
that, they send Me such thick letters

00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:00.598
describing what all wrong they have done,
this, that -

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:04.002
I don’t ever read it, I just burn it off.
It’s not important.

00:29:04.202 --> 00:29:06.663
Interviewer: You should return them, see.
Shri Mataji: You see, yes, it’s no good.

00:29:06.864 --> 00:29:10.191
Because you see past is past, finished now.
Forget it.

00:29:10.391 --> 00:29:13.616
Why – it’s over. Interviewer: But how can
they not repeat them,

00:29:13.816 --> 00:29:16.916
if, You know, if they are not aware that
this is wrong

00:29:17.116 --> 00:29:19.921
or there is something that they should pay
attention…

00:29:20.122 --> 00:29:24.803
You see, what happens that it’s all a game
of the ego and conditioning.

00:29:25.004 --> 00:29:27.482
The ego goes on telling: “You did this
wrong, you did that wrong”,

00:29:27.682 --> 00:29:30.139
they feel guilty all the time. There’s no
need

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.320
to feel guilty or anything. It just works
out,

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.483
you see, you are human beings. After all
only human beings can commit mistakes,

00:29:37.684 --> 00:29:41.919
you are not gods, what is there to be so
much angry with yourself for that?

00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:46.147
Just you should know that you can become
the Spirit which is a pure thing.

00:29:46.347 --> 00:29:51.904
Like we say that in the pond, you see, when
you are in the pond there can be worms

00:29:52.104 --> 00:29:55.450
and all sorts of things, but when you become
the lotus

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.382
you are fragrant, you are above it, nothing
can spoil you.

00:29:59.582 --> 00:30:03.030
In the same way you get that life, eternal
life. So…

00:30:03.231 --> 00:30:06.147
But it’s true, but who tells you whether
you are right or wrong?

00:30:06.348 --> 00:30:08.506
Shri Mataji: You yourself.
Interviewer: But...

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:11.161
You see, I don’t have to tell you because
you feel it yourself

00:30:11.361 --> 00:30:13.548
that goodness within you, you feel it
yourself.

00:30:13.748 --> 00:30:15.986
Interviewer: You mean that when you are
right you feel it…

00:30:16.186 --> 00:30:18.728
Shri Mataji: You feel it. Interviewer: Even
when you are wrong you feel it.

00:30:18.928 --> 00:30:22.741
Shri Mataji: Not normally, you see, right
and wrong is a different concept.

00:30:22.942 --> 00:30:28.301
It is like this that you feel, when you get
this thing you feel

00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:32.483
within yourself that you know the absolute,
because you can use it.

00:30:32.683 --> 00:30:35.598
Say now, supposing somebody is suffering
from a cancer,

00:30:35.798 --> 00:30:38.105
now you put your hands to that person,
ask –

00:30:38.305 --> 00:30:40.874
now what happens you know the chakras
which are catching.

00:30:41.075 --> 00:30:43.155
Immediately you know the person has cancer.
He may not know,

00:30:43.356 --> 00:30:45.616
doctors may not know, but you know.

00:30:45.817 --> 00:30:51.217
Then you ask the question about yourself:
“What’s… Is it alright?”.

00:30:51.418 --> 00:30:55.075
You can ask, because you are now one with
the absolute truth.

00:30:55.276 --> 00:30:58.741
So there is no question of anybody telling
you about it, you just know.

00:30:58.942 --> 00:31:01.764
Like people will come and tell Me: ‘Mother,
see, this Agnya chakra is catching”.

00:31:01.965 --> 00:31:06.678
Is the, is the centre of Christ. That means
that person is suffering from ego.

00:31:06.879 --> 00:31:09.055
But we never say “I am suffering from ego”
normally.

00:31:09.255 --> 00:31:12.435
Interviewer: Especially from ego we don’t.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no one says that.

00:31:12.635 --> 00:31:15.056
So now when, what happens that when you

00:31:15.256 --> 00:31:17.014
come and tell Me that “my Agnya is
catching”

00:31:17.214 --> 00:31:21.085
means that you have ego, alright, this,
it can be corrected...

00:31:21.285 --> 00:31:22.749
Interviewer: It can be corrected.
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:28.694
Now we are dealing with treating
the consciousness and health.

00:31:28.895 --> 00:31:31.153
Now what is a miracle to You?
Shri Mataji: What is a?

00:31:31.353 --> 00:31:34.100
What is a miracle? Does it mean anything
or is just...

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.131
Shri Mataji: I don’t think it’s a miracle.
Interviewer: … one thing among others.

00:31:36.331 --> 00:31:40.186
I mean, it’s a way to absolute…
Shri Mataji: Yes,

00:31:40.387 --> 00:31:42.640
it is, it is your position in your
evolution.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.361
You see, like first they say we were
chimpanzees.

00:31:45.561 --> 00:31:47.722
Alright, take this case, chimpanzees.

00:31:47.922 --> 00:31:51.663
Now, some chimpanzees became some other
human beings, other human beings,

00:31:51.864 --> 00:31:56.311
that all those human beings have no more.
Now we are there,

00:31:56.511 --> 00:31:59.428
so there is a big gap between us and
the chimpanzees.

00:31:59.628 --> 00:32:06.208
Like us who are realized souls and human
beings there is a gap.

00:32:06.408 --> 00:32:12.803
Now how many human beings will become
the spiritual beings, you can’t say.

00:32:13.004 --> 00:32:17.423
They should. According to John it is only
144 thousand,

00:32:17.623 --> 00:32:19.344
but I think we have already crossed
the limit.

00:32:19.544 --> 00:32:22.321
Interviewer: According to John…
Shri Mataji: John the – John,

00:32:22.521 --> 00:32:25.663
the disciple of Christ. Interviewer: Oh
I see, so You quote the apostles, I see.

00:32:25.863 --> 00:32:27.129
Shri Mataji: The Revelation, yes.
Interviewer: I see.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:31.455
So. But maybe his counting was wrong,
because we have already crossed

00:32:31.655 --> 00:32:34.264
the limit. I think. Whatever it is,

00:32:34.465 --> 00:32:41.569
so now when you become the spiritual being
then these people are left behind.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.460
Now see how we are destroying ourselves
otherwise.

00:32:45.661 --> 00:32:51.155
See this AIDS business... You go to America
and you are shocked:

00:32:51.356 --> 00:32:53.727
people are so nervous, they have
schizophrenia,

00:32:53.927 --> 00:32:58.553
they have this disease, that disease, and
all kinds of destructive things -

00:32:58.753 --> 00:33:01.394
now listening to this horrible music they
go deaf,

00:33:01.594 --> 00:33:05.507
and then they lose their hair, and all kinds
of things are happening.

00:33:05.708 --> 00:33:09.201
But always they take to something
destructive. Everything,

00:33:09.401 --> 00:33:14.913
like a man sees somebody going in the pub
and coming out and falling down.

00:33:15.114 --> 00:33:17.932
Another one goes, pays to fall down Again,
I mean –

00:33:18.132 --> 00:33:20.842
you see, he can’t see that this is
destructive.

00:33:21.043 --> 00:33:24.977
But after realization you see what is
destructive, what is constructive.

00:33:25.177 --> 00:33:28.294
So a person who is realized starts rising
much higher

00:33:28.494 --> 00:33:32.932
than the person who is not realized. And
there is a big gap, I find, there is -

00:33:33.132 --> 00:33:37.046
but it can be crossed like that, in one
month’s time he can change.

00:33:37.247 --> 00:33:39.524
Interviewer: In one month’s time.
Shri Mataji: You see, he becomes an expert.

00:33:39.724 --> 00:33:42.461
That’s very quick process. Now tell me:
in all religions

00:33:42.661 --> 00:33:47.288
there is different stages, grades as you
grow up.

00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:50.160
Now, is there any education for small
children?

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.175
How do they – how they are introduced
in this system of Yoga?

00:33:54.375 --> 00:33:56.323
Shri Mataji: Who?
Interviewer: Young children.

00:33:56.523 --> 00:33:59.840
You see, young children, if they are born
realized, they immediately know Me.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.273
Interviewer: So they can be - they can do
that at what age?

00:34:03.473 --> 00:34:05.613
Shri Mataji: You see, even very little
babies. Interviewer: Really!

00:34:05.813 --> 00:34:10.334
They see Me, they start smiling and just
talking to Me, it’s very sweet.

00:34:10.534 --> 00:34:12.957
And on the whole children are very good
for realization

00:34:13.157 --> 00:34:16.842
because they are pure souls, they are
innocent. They are the best.

00:34:17.043 --> 00:34:22.993
I mean, normally you see, we nowadays
of course we are getting very much worried

00:34:23.193 --> 00:34:26.998
about children, because they are getting
spoilt, and this and that,

00:34:27.198 --> 00:34:31.399
but when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they
become excellent children.

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:35.355
Now we have a school also in India now,
on the Himalayas,

00:34:35.555 --> 00:34:40.436
we have a beautiful school for children
and everybody says they are so matured,

00:34:40.637 --> 00:34:44.070
so wise, so sensible, so respectful.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.907
It’s really worth seeing them the way they
behave and so on.

00:34:48.107 --> 00:34:52.256
Because, you see, their Spirit starts
manifesting.

00:34:52.456 --> 00:34:58.038
Now would You describe a certain practice
of prayers

00:34:58.239 --> 00:35:02.130
or anything else that is a must for some
of your disciples?

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.225
You see there is – there is no prescribed
thing as such

00:35:05.426 --> 00:35:10.554
but according to your centers. Now if some
centre is in jeopardy

00:35:10.754 --> 00:35:15.358
or there is a problem with any centre then
you should know how to cure it

00:35:15.558 --> 00:35:18.710
and correct it. And there are few things
you have to do

00:35:18.911 --> 00:35:21.497
by which you can correct it. It’s very
simple.

00:35:21.697 --> 00:35:23.458
Interviewer: It is.
Shri Mataji: Yes, extremely.

00:35:23.659 --> 00:35:28.632
Well, I’m sure that there is plenty of time
for You to meet with people

00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:32.664
around the world as You travel non-stop.
Now tell me about...

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:37.892
But see, but at the most three-four days
I am at home, and then I travel.

00:35:38.092 --> 00:35:39.379
Interviewer: You travel. Shri Mataji: Yes.
Interviewer: How…

00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:42.341
With India I’m there for about two months
with My family.

00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:45.237
They also come down here sometimes,
you know.

00:35:45.437 --> 00:35:51.007
Now how did this all started? I mean, now
You are something of an apostle.

00:35:51.207 --> 00:35:54.385
I mean, how did it all - what is
the inspiration for You to do all this?

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:58.856
Are You - do You consider Yourself as the
founder of this way of approaching truth?

00:35:59.056 --> 00:36:02.914
That’s what we say, but you see, actually
Sahaja Yoga is an ancient system.

00:36:03.114 --> 00:36:06.764
As I told you it was only for one person
they used to use.

00:36:06.965 --> 00:36:11.787
But what you say if I am the founder
of this en masse movement, I am.

00:36:11.987 --> 00:36:15.098
Interviewer: You are. Shri Mataji: But
it is, it is all there already,

00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:18.155
it was there, all these things were there,

00:36:18.356 --> 00:36:22.462
only thing if I have worked anything is
the permutations and combinations

00:36:22.662 --> 00:36:28.215
as I said about human beings, why is it
that they cannot get en masse realization.

00:36:28.415 --> 00:36:32.730
Any discovery, whatever it is, if it cannot
be used by masses is useless.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.616
And I worked it out and it’s done through
Me.

00:36:35.817 --> 00:36:39.919
Interviewer: It is a system that approaches
people. Now how do You,

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:44.413
tell us, tell us about Your life now. You
are really someone who preaches

00:36:44.614 --> 00:36:49.085
a new message around the world. How is it
accepted?

00:36:49.286 --> 00:36:55.046
Very much. Because this is a time, special
time, modern times,

00:36:55.247 --> 00:36:59.264
it’s called as Kali Yuga in India.
It’s the worst times, you see.

00:36:59.465 --> 00:37:02.561
And all kinds of sins will be done, all
kinds of things.

00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:06.678
They describe horrible things for this -
but at the same time

00:37:06.879 --> 00:37:13.475
there will be a category of people who are
seekers of truth. And so many of them.

00:37:13.676 --> 00:37:18.725
It’s already prophesized - William Blake
in England, you see,

00:37:18.926 --> 00:37:26.014
he has written about it that there will be
men of God who will be born in those days

00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:32.241
and they will have the capacity to become
divine

00:37:32.442 --> 00:37:36.444
and make others. He has clearly described
it.

00:37:36.644 --> 00:37:40.850
So him, in another part of the world, with
his own education,

00:37:41.051 --> 00:37:44.663
reached with his means what You reached
in other ways.

00:37:44.864 --> 00:37:48.043
Do You have relationships, or do You meet

00:37:48.243 --> 00:37:52.569
with people who are leading figures
of other religions?

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.608
Shri Mataji: Rather difficult.
Interviewer: Why?

00:37:54.809 --> 00:38:00.178
Because, you see, they have set ideas.
And most of the religions are

00:38:00.379 --> 00:38:03.620
either power-oriented or money-oriented,
they are not Spirit-oriented.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.619
Interviewer: I see. Well, that is very
serious.

00:38:05.819 --> 00:38:09.338
This is a big problem you know. If they
were Spirit-oriented,

00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:11.803
I would have loved to meet them and talk
to them,

00:38:12.004 --> 00:38:14.482
but they are not. You see, this is a big
problem.

00:38:14.682 --> 00:38:18.749
And would You say, would You consider
the people that follow You

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.788
and live with You as a church, in the…?
Shri Mataji: Same thing with the…

00:38:21.988 --> 00:38:24.280
I was born in a Christian family Myself.
Interviewer: I see.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.456
Well then, do You think it is as easy
for a Christian

00:38:27.656 --> 00:38:32.358
as for anybody else to reach out and find
this way?

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:37.477
Christians abroad are alright because they
seem that they have started now

00:38:37.677 --> 00:38:40.601
thinking that they have to have something
more than the church, you see,

00:38:40.801 --> 00:38:45.257
church is not sufficient. Like they are now
closing down all the churches everywhere,

00:38:45.458 --> 00:38:47.725
so there’s something has to be found out.

00:38:47.926 --> 00:38:51.163
But Christians in some places like India
are -

00:38:51.363 --> 00:38:55.230
are not like that, they are not seeking.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:39:00.835
They think that, that the Christians abroad
are saintly people, you see?

00:39:01.036 --> 00:39:05.225
Also some of them believe that Christ was
born in England! Can You believe that?

00:39:05.426 --> 00:39:09.389
Well I am sure that if Christ appears like
a British gentleman,

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:13.139
because the system we have made out of Him
is not Palestinian at all,

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.475
and you realize that there is a twist
anyway...

00:39:15.676 --> 00:39:20.405
It is ignorance, complete ignorance about
even Christ is there.

00:39:20.606 --> 00:39:25.417
But after Sahaja Yoga you realize who He
was, what was His greatness.

00:39:25.617 --> 00:39:30.012
And really I mean you know what important
work He has done.

00:39:30.212 --> 00:39:33.366
Without Him I could not have managed Sahaja
Yoga.

00:39:33.567 --> 00:39:35.460
So all of them are very necessary

00:39:35.661 --> 00:39:41.483
and He is the last gate we have to open
and that’s what He’s done.

00:39:41.684 --> 00:39:44.230
But how contradictory we are.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.389
Like we say that He suffered for our sins,

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:51.583
still why should we suffer now anymore?
It’s very contradictory

00:39:51.784 --> 00:39:54.725
that we should suffer for Christ. Why?

00:39:54.926 --> 00:39:58.872
No father likes you to suffer. Why will
he like you to suffer?

00:39:59.073 --> 00:40:04.215
So this sufferings and all this is not
necessary.

00:40:04.416 --> 00:40:08.596
Can you tell us how this group of people
who live in the way

00:40:08.796 --> 00:40:13.061
You explained to us in Greece what do
they do? How do they live?

00:40:13.261 --> 00:40:14.973
I mean, people would like to know.
Shri Mataji: That in Greece?

00:40:15.174 --> 00:40:17.783
Oh, they are very dynamics, dynamic people.

00:40:17.983 --> 00:40:22.796
They have doing very well in life, most
of them are

00:40:22.997 --> 00:40:27.897
very much improved in health and in every
way, their married life has improved -

00:40:28.098 --> 00:40:32.275
of course in one or two cases the, some
of the very orthodox people have tried

00:40:32.475 --> 00:40:38.483
to trouble them. But most of them are very
happy, doing very well.

00:40:38.684 --> 00:40:45.466
Well, you seem to think that we are viewing
a very healthy if not wealthy group.

00:40:45.666 --> 00:40:50.757
Do you address poor people, miserable
people, people that are desperate as well?

00:40:50.958 --> 00:40:57.608
You see, poor people are – it’s more on
the middle, middle class work is better.

00:40:57.809 --> 00:41:02.502
Because poor don’t have any money just now,
they want to have food,

00:41:02.702 --> 00:41:07.440
so they don’t think of Spirit so much. But
if you once have

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:13.348
this spiritual awakening, from the middle
group then they go to the poor

00:41:13.549 --> 00:41:18.233
and they can help, because there is free
health services, there is -

00:41:18.433 --> 00:41:22.795
also these vibrations give you tremendous
amount of energy

00:41:22.995 --> 00:41:27.620
to grow more food; you see, the crops
improve, the cattle improves,

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.366
so that’s how you help your farmers, so
that’s how it works out.

00:41:31.567 --> 00:41:35.397
But the rich are difficult, because as
Christ as said…

00:41:35.598 --> 00:41:38.022
Interviewer: They have, they have it all.
They are self-sustained.

00:41:38.223 --> 00:41:41.700
… they think, they think we’re alright.
But money has problems,

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:47.239
lots of problems, and so they also come.
Even politicians come,

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.810
but I must say that they are rather slow
people -

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.400
bureaucrats, politicians, are rather slow.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.858
Interviewer: They are the slow ones. They
keep the world not spinning enough.

00:41:58.059 --> 00:42:02.753
Now, how modern do You think that Your
message could be for young people

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:11.225
who are, you know, dealing with loud music,
and speed, and violence, and new ideas…?

00:42:11.426 --> 00:42:16.004
You see this is meta-modern, I’m talking
of meta-modern era,

00:42:16.204 --> 00:42:23.446
where people will not have any violence
because it’s compassion and love.

00:42:23.646 --> 00:42:27.897
You’ll feel the love for another person.
There’s no question of violence.

00:42:28.098 --> 00:42:32.553
And in this meta-modern era

00:42:32.754 --> 00:42:37.770
there will be no racialism, no fanaticism,
no fundamentalism,

00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:43.754
all ”isms” will drop out. Because “isms”
are just conditionings and ignorance.

00:42:43.955 --> 00:42:47.235
Interviewer: “Isms” are schisms.
Shri Mataji: Isms - they are isms.

00:42:47.435 --> 00:42:52.575
Sahaja Yoga is no ism. It is being, it is
reality.

00:42:52.776 --> 00:42:56.240
So you do not have these problems at all.
After this

00:42:56.458 --> 00:43:01.135
we have people from all over the world –
I’ve never seen them quarrelling, fighting

00:43:01.335 --> 00:43:04.364
- of course they pull each other’s leg
sometimes, they are very humorous

00:43:04.565 --> 00:43:07.604
and they enjoy life, just enjoy.

00:43:07.804 --> 00:43:10.575
We are not bothered as to what their jobs
are or things,

00:43:10.776 --> 00:43:15.287
but they are telling Me that they are
getting so many results out of this -

00:43:15.487 --> 00:43:19.613
here only they told Me the some
of the photographers got 1st prizes

00:43:19.813 --> 00:43:27.551
for their photography, some musicians got
very high, high salaries

00:43:27.752 --> 00:43:32.106
and things like that, you see. So it shows
that once you are in balance and in peace,

00:43:32.306 --> 00:43:37.536
you can achieve much more than when you
are disturbed.

00:43:37.736 --> 00:43:40.685
You see, You come into a country that has
the idea

00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:44.587
of a very homogeneous total population,

00:43:44.787 --> 00:43:47.865
that all belong to one ethnic group, and
they have one race,

00:43:48.065 --> 00:43:51.819
and have one religion. And this is very
useful for us in this country

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:56.438
to realize that it is not so, that there is
people who think in different way,

00:43:56.638 --> 00:44:00.279
who approach the same truth and the same
life in a very different way.

00:44:00.479 --> 00:44:03.536
Now, what will be Your message when You
will meet them tomorrow

00:44:03.737 --> 00:44:06.910
apart from all that you have told us about?

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.519
Shri Mataji: For the people here?
Interviewer: Yes.

00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:13.008
You see, actually this is - they have
to know their heritage.

00:44:13.208 --> 00:44:18.067
This is their heritage I am talking about.
You see, they cannot learn anything

00:44:18.267 --> 00:44:21.013
from these Eastern – (She corrects Herself)
Western people.

00:44:21.213 --> 00:44:24.708
You have to teach them, you can, because
your heritage is here

00:44:24.909 --> 00:44:27.598
and you are so traditionally bound people.

00:44:27.799 --> 00:44:30.981
But somehow it is lost, I don’t know why
it is lost.

00:44:31.182 --> 00:44:34.351
If you can come back to it, and the whole
world can learn from you,

00:44:34.552 --> 00:44:37.484
no doubt about it. So it is so important.

00:44:37.684 --> 00:44:41.994
And it is such a great discovery. Once you
discover what you are,

00:44:42.194 --> 00:44:46.548
you know how, how glorified you are, how
great you are

00:44:46.748 --> 00:44:50.147
and the whole self-esteem and everything
comes within you,

00:44:50.348 --> 00:44:58.219
and you become very eminent, dignified and
a very beautiful person.

00:44:58.583 --> 00:45:03.173
You see, we've been listening to a wise
voice that reminds us of our past,

00:45:03.373 --> 00:45:07.911
of our traditions, of the traditions
of this country, of another country;

00:45:08.111 --> 00:45:12.954
and reminds us how different we can be
in seeking the one and only truth

00:45:13.154 --> 00:45:16.809
in very many different ways. Good night.

00:45:18.723 --> 00:45:21.421
Interviewer: Thank You.
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.
