00:02.179 --> 00:05.441
Interviewer: Good evening, it is very
strong feeling that so many times

00:05.641 --> 00:09.524
we are in another country although we are
in this country.

00:09.724 --> 00:14.006
Tonight we have the opportunity of really
make a long travel.

00:14.206 --> 00:18.696
A long travel in wisdom, in distance,
in space,

00:18.896 --> 00:22.750
in our hearts, in truth. This is all
the elements

00:22.950 --> 00:26.905
that are concentrated in the presence
of a Holy Mother

00:27.105 --> 00:30.992
that we have invited here, and we are very
grateful that we have You…

00:31.192 --> 00:35.148
… all the way from one of the oldest
civilizations.

00:35.348 --> 00:40.459
You know, we are very proud that we are
members of a very old civilization…

00:40.659 --> 00:43.953
And very rarely we realize how other old
civilizations

00:44.153 --> 00:48.605
shine in other places on the world. So we
do welcome You here

00:48.805 --> 00:52.468
along with the truth You carry for us.

00:52.911 --> 00:56.898
We would like to ask You about this truth,

00:57.098 --> 00:59.583
and the way You see in this same world,

00:59.823 --> 01:04.685
this other country which is every country
which is our heart.

01:05.864 --> 01:09.374
We have to know one thing, what is
the truth is.

01:09.575 --> 01:13.245
The truth is actually we are not this body,
mind,

01:13.445 --> 01:19.223
intellect, emotions, ego, but we are
the Spirit.

01:19.424 --> 01:23.675
And in our evolutionary process we have
reached the stage

01:23.875 --> 01:28.627
of human awareness, and beyond this there’s
a little breakthrough

01:28.827 --> 01:34.272
by which we have to become the Spirit.
That’s very simple

01:34.473 --> 01:39.288
and can be done very easily for people who
are seeking the truth.

01:39.489 --> 01:42.302
How would you describe the system of your
thought,

01:42.502 --> 01:46.861
the system that you approach to our hearts
and our minds?

01:47.061 --> 01:52.366
Yes. You’ll be amazed to know that
in Greece people called a bone Sacrum,

01:52.566 --> 01:56.460
which is the triangular bone, and that
means they knew

01:56.660 --> 01:59.913
there was something sacred about that bone.

02:00.113 --> 02:05.366
Now this bone has got within itself
a residual power

02:05.567 --> 02:11.881
which is for our connection to this
all-pervading divine power.

02:12.081 --> 02:16.475
All the scriptures have talked about
all-pervading divine love and everything,

02:16.676 --> 02:21.913
but we have never felt it before.
It’s a surprising thing

02:22.114 --> 02:24.464
that we take all living things for granted,

02:24.664 --> 02:27.909
for our heart beats, we don’t know how
it beats.

02:28.109 --> 02:31.327
Then you see the flowers grow, we don’t
know how it grows.

02:31.528 --> 02:38.646
But if you understand that there is some
power which is doing all this living work

02:38.847 --> 02:43.463
then the time has come for us to know it,
to feel it,

02:43.663 --> 02:47.215
to understand it, and also to use it.

02:47.536 --> 02:50.283
How do You think that people have arrived

02:50.483 --> 02:53.593
in so many conclusions that they call
religions,

02:53.793 --> 02:56.739
and what is the connection between this way
of approaching

02:56.939 --> 02:59.675
ourselves to the truth which is one,

02:59.876 --> 03:04.045
and Your old tradition in Your country
which I assume is India?

03:04.245 --> 03:09.700
No, in all the religions and scriptures
is written that you have to transform,

03:09.901 --> 03:13.710
you have to be born again. Every religion
has said that.

03:13.911 --> 03:16.768
This is not only that any particular
religion has said it.

03:16.968 --> 03:20.741
Every religion, even Islam has said you
have to be a Wali.

03:20.942 --> 03:23.481
Even Christianity has said you are to be
born again.

03:23.682 --> 03:26.475
I mean there’s no religion which has not
said that,

03:26.675 --> 03:29.262
but it is not just a certificate.

03:29.462 --> 03:32.085
You cannot take just a certificate
“I am born again”.

03:32.286 --> 03:37.952
It is something that actualizes by which
you develop a new state,

03:38.153 --> 03:42.928
a new state of your mind, state of your
being by which

03:43.128 --> 03:48.739
you become the Spirit - and there are
powers of the Spirit which you manifest.

03:48.940 --> 03:51.671
It’s not just talking and giving sermons
and lectures,

03:51.872 --> 03:56.244
but it is something that’s an actualization,
is a living process.

03:56.444 --> 04:01.190
I think we Greeks belong to the ... what
we call the East part

04:01.390 --> 04:07.248
of philosophy, of religions. This is
a system which is mostly esoteric,

04:07.448 --> 04:10.989
this is a very Greek word which is seeking
inside.

04:11.190 --> 04:15.473
I think this is quite relevant and close
to the very ancient Indian tradition.

04:15.674 --> 04:18.862
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. Interviewer:
Now how close do You think these,

04:19.062 --> 04:23.191
these very old religious systems are,
I am talking about

04:23.391 --> 04:27.943
the Pagan, our own ancestors
[Shri Mataji: “Yes”] before Christianity,

04:28.112 --> 04:34.799
even the Jewish or all the other, Hindu,
Buddhist and the rest You know.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.478
Yeah. You see, specially in Greece you had
the ancient system

04:38.678 --> 04:43.917
of worshipping the Goddess Athena. Now
in Sanskrit Atha means the primordial,

04:44.117 --> 04:48.085
so to us She is the Primordial Mother,
that we call in our language

04:48.286 --> 04:51.097
as Adi Shakti, you see, is the Primordial
Mother.

04:51.297 --> 04:56.522
And She has, you must have seen a snake
in Her shield and also in Her hand

04:56.723 --> 05:02.639
that is the symbol of this power within
you, which lies dormant

05:02.840 --> 05:07.661
in your, in your triangular bone called
as sacrum.

05:07.862 --> 05:11.182
So the Greeks knew about it, no doubt,
because otherwise

05:11.382 --> 05:14.600
they would not have called Her Athena and
She must have been...

05:14.801 --> 05:20.505
in our scriptures She is described very
well, not only that

05:20.705 --> 05:26.584
but Greece is called as Manipur Dwipe,
means the navel of the universe.

05:26.784 --> 05:31.491
Yes. And certainly it was a surprise for me
to see

05:31.692 --> 05:34.684
that You come here to preach our own
ancient Gods.

05:34.884 --> 05:40.012
Now, what are You telling us about Athena,
is that the serpents,

05:40.212 --> 05:44.178
serpents with Greek gods are very familiar
creatures…

05:44.379 --> 05:46.991
… have to do with medicine and others.

05:47.192 --> 05:51.296
Now what is the message of Athena coming
from You again nowadays?

05:51.518 --> 05:59.178
Athena is the one that, She is the one who
was trying to push Her spear

05:59.379 --> 06:03.210
into the fontanel bone of Zeus.

06:03.411 --> 06:06.038
Now that’s exactly what Sahaja Yoga is.

06:06.239 --> 06:10.122
We think - not we believe, and that we have
proved also -

06:10.322 --> 06:16.358
that this power which we call as Kundalini,
because it is like a serpent

06:16.559 --> 06:20.809
going into coils, because it’s an energy
that moves like a serpent.

06:21.009 --> 06:23.942
You see, more symbolic it is, not
the serpent actually.

06:24.143 --> 06:28.989
So this is the power which is the reflection
of Athena within us

06:29.159 --> 06:34.483
and when she rises she goes and hits here
and opens out your fontanel bone.

06:34.684 --> 06:39.014
That’s actualization of the baptism,
as described in Christianity;

06:39.215 --> 06:44.928
by that then you are connected with that
subtle energy which is all-pervading.

06:45.129 --> 06:49.897
For the first time you start feeling that
cool breeze in your hand

06:50.098 --> 06:52.577
which is described is the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost.

06:52.778 --> 06:55.660
The Holy Ghost is the same as Athena, but
I think Christians

06:55.860 --> 06:59.155
could not connect it with that. She is
the same.

06:59.356 --> 07:03.897
We see that all these sanctities along
history come

07:04.098 --> 07:07.056
and repeat themselves and transfigurate
themselves

07:07.256 --> 07:09.147
according to the tradition of peoples.
Shri Mataji: Of course.

07:09.347 --> 07:12.177
Now You have referred to Yoga and of course

07:12.377 --> 07:15.577
in this part of the world we are more
or less familiar.

07:15.778 --> 07:18.685
Now for those who are less, I would like
You to found

07:18.885 --> 07:22.533
what we are talking now in this Yoga and
give us some ideas

07:22.733 --> 07:26.661
about the wide spectrum of what You would
call Yoga.

07:26.862 --> 07:30.458
You see, Yoga is when you unite,

07:30.659 --> 07:36.678
is the union between your Self with
the divine is Yoga,

07:36.879 --> 07:40.513
That’s the real spiritual yoga. All other
yogas,

07:40.713 --> 07:43.494
like physical yoga and all that, is a wee
part

07:43.694 --> 07:46.963
of what one Patanjali wrote. Is a very wee
part

07:47.163 --> 07:50.147
that to cleanse your body and all that is
there.

07:50.348 --> 07:54.690
But there is no need now to do all that.

07:54.891 --> 08:00.733
First in the modern times what if I have
done any work is this:

08:00.934 --> 08:03.850
that people used to get self realization,
alright,

08:04.050 --> 08:08.590
but one Master had only one disciple.
Gradually it started

08:08.790 --> 08:13.256
in a way that they started talking about it.
From the, I think, 12th century

08:13.456 --> 08:17.722
it became more open. But it has been there
for years together.

08:17.922 --> 08:21.233
Now when they started talking about it,
they couldn’t give

08:21.434 --> 08:24.833
en mass realization. They could only give
to one person.

08:25.034 --> 08:28.175
So the only thing that I have done is
to work out

08:28.375 --> 08:31.542
the permutations and combinations of human
nature

08:31.742 --> 08:36.428
by which I have understood how to give
en mass realization.

08:36.629 --> 08:41.052
And that’s the only achievement of modern
Sahaja Yoga.

08:41.252 --> 08:44.927
Sahaja Yoga is an ancient system in India,
also must have been here

08:45.127 --> 08:52.241
because the way the sacrum bone is there
and she is having all those things.

08:52.442 --> 08:57.516
But the practice of that may not have been
so open, might have been secretive

08:57.716 --> 09:00.852
in those days, when they were giving
realization to people.

09:01.052 --> 09:04.014
And it’s the ancient times, thousands
of years back, so.

09:04.215 --> 09:08.100
But in India we have still maintained all
those traditions and things,

09:08.300 --> 09:13.374
and we still respect and worship the Mother
Goddess. Athena we respect.

09:13.549 --> 09:15.747
She is called as Adi Shakti, name is
different,

09:15.948 --> 09:18.788
and She is the Holy Ghost according to us.

09:18.989 --> 09:23.389
Now this works out, is in everyone.
It’s your own power within you

09:23.590 --> 09:28.088
and it works out and it rises and pierces
through your fontanel bone area.

09:28.288 --> 09:32.833
It does, it actualizes the experience which
is described

09:33.034 --> 09:37.176
and that’s what one has to feel, otherwise
it is just talk, talk, talk, talk.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.866
Any religion has become nothing but talk,

09:40.067 --> 09:42.649
so you see, people are now fed up. They
think what is this

09:42.849 --> 09:46.405
promising, claiming, nothing happens to us,
we are just the same,

09:46.605 --> 09:49.670
our forefathers were such and we are just
the same.

09:49.870 --> 09:52.594
But now the time has come. It’s a new age
as I say

09:52.794 --> 09:57.306
to achieve that state, a new state, where
you become.

09:57.506 --> 10:03.958
Firstly you become thoughtlessly aware,
means you live in the present.

10:04.159 --> 10:08.491
Thoughts come to you from the past and
from the future.

10:08.691 --> 10:12.531
You are dancing on the cusp of the thoughts.
But when this happens,

10:12.731 --> 10:15.616
the thoughts are separated and in between
the thoughts,

10:15.817 --> 10:19.960
there’s a space which we call as
the present, which is reality.

10:20.161 --> 10:23.171
Present is the reality because the past
is finished

10:23.372 --> 10:26.475
and the future doesn’t exist so you live
in the present.

10:26.676 --> 10:30.071
When you live in the present, you start
growing spiritually.

10:30.271 --> 10:35.444
And that’s what happens to you first, that
you become thoughtlessly aware.

10:35.645 --> 10:38.626
The second thing happens to you that you
start feeling

10:38.826 --> 10:42.421
that cool breeze on your hands. Now it’s
medically you know

10:42.622 --> 10:47.301
that these are the endings
of the sympathetic nervous system.

10:47.502 --> 10:50.681
So what happens that when, when you get
your realization,

10:50.882 --> 10:53.143
you start feeling this cool breeze all
along

10:53.343 --> 10:56.905
and you start feeling those things on your
finger tips.

10:57.105 --> 11:00.803
Now supposing if you have a problem
in anyone of these centers,

11:01.004 --> 11:04.202
there are seven centers, five, six and
seven.

11:04.403 --> 11:05.850
Immediately you feel it on your finger.

11:06.051 --> 11:08.900
You don’t have to go to doctor for
diagnosis, immediately you know.

11:09.100 --> 11:13.710
Now if you know how to cure it, then
physically you can be cured,

11:13.911 --> 11:19.850
mentally you can be cured, also all our
human problems

11:20.051 --> 11:23.553
or I should say all the world’s problems
are because of human beings.

11:23.754 --> 11:26.497
And all our human problems are because
of our centers

11:26.697 --> 11:30.009
which are within us. So when this power
rises,

11:30.209 --> 11:33.952
She nourishes them, She integrates them
and corrects them

11:34.153 --> 11:38.233
so we get physical, mental, emotional
problems solved.

11:38.434 --> 11:42.569
And then you feel your own peace within
yourself.

11:42.770 --> 11:46.497
But the second thing that you achieve
is a new awareness

11:46.698 --> 11:51.393
which we call as collective consciousness.

11:53.183 --> 11:59.296
That is where you can feel not only your
own centers

11:59.497 --> 12:03.522
but also the centers of others. Now, when
you grow spiritually

12:03.723 --> 12:07.553
then sitting down here you can feel
the centers of anyone,

12:07.754 --> 12:11.379
sitting down here you can correct
the centers of other people,

12:11.580 --> 12:15.323
but you have to grow. But in the beginning

12:15.523 --> 12:22.241
you start feeling the Joy of your being,

12:22.442 --> 12:28.139
because in your heart resides the Spirit.
And Spirit is the source of joy.

12:28.340 --> 12:32.866
It is the source of absolute truth. So you
know also absolute truth.

12:33.067 --> 12:35.803
Because on your fingertips you can ask
any question

12:36.004 --> 12:39.538
say, they might say, “Was Christ the son
of God?"

12:39.739 --> 12:42.835
Alright? Ask the questions - immediately
you start getting

12:43.036 --> 12:49.303
tremendous vibrations. Surprisingly Athena
is also called as Pallas,

12:49.504 --> 12:53.361
Pallas means vibrations, means She gives
vibrations, you see.

12:53.562 --> 12:57.147
So these vibrations will tell you
the absolute truth.

12:57.348 --> 13:00.108
Because we live in relative world, that’s
why we are fighting.

13:00.309 --> 13:04.139
Once we are in the absolute, there is
no fight, no problems.

13:04.340 --> 13:10.188
Now, this once happens you become
collectively conscious,

13:10.388 --> 13:13.276
then who is the other? Everybody is within
your body.

13:13.476 --> 13:18.020
You can feel everyone within yourself so
you become a universal personality.

13:18.221 --> 13:22.098
This is the character of your Spirit,
because Spirit is the reflection

13:22.299 --> 13:25.757
of God Almighty within you, which is
in everyone.

13:25.957 --> 13:29.549
But it is just a witness till you are
a realized soul.

13:29.749 --> 13:33.044
But once you become a realized soul then
it starts manifesting.

13:33.244 --> 13:38.845
It manifests and you can also raise
the Kundalini of others.

13:39.045 --> 13:43.185
You can give realization to others.
It’s like if you enlighten one candle,

13:43.385 --> 13:48.309
that candle can enlighten another candle.
So that’s how it spreads.

13:48.598 --> 13:51.558
It is very interesting. And while You
are talking

13:51.758 --> 13:56.233
I am writing down certain things that come
in contrast

13:56.434 --> 13:59.526
to what we are used to in this so-called
western world.

13:59.726 --> 14:04.936
I am wondering this split between body and
mind that we suffer.

14:05.137 --> 14:09.685
That is something that you do not suffer of.
It is wonderful how

14:09.885 --> 14:16.226
people in the Far East and of course
their Spirit is not schizophrenic.

14:16.426 --> 14:19.660
How do You explain, and how can people

14:19.860 --> 14:23.774
come back together with their own either
body or mind,

14:23.974 --> 14:27.987
because now in this part of the world,
there is people who live

14:28.187 --> 14:31.809
for their bodies or who live for their
minds.

14:32.010 --> 14:34.879
They are ignorant. That’s why they are
in darkness, you see.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.378
They think body is very important but
I know people

14:37.578 --> 14:39.305
who have very good bodies also come to me,
saying

14:39.505 --> 14:41.879
“Mother, give us peace”, you see, “give us
joy”.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.548
So nobody seems to be satisfied. So, they
are ignorant…

14:45.748 --> 14:47.872
Interviewer: It’s the other part which is
missing. Shri Mataji: Yes. But with this

14:48.073 --> 14:52.233
the whole thing gets integrated: your body,
mind, your liver,

14:52.433 --> 14:57.809
your ego, everything - and the ego just
disappears. You become egoless.

14:58.009 --> 15:02.077
You don’t think you are doing anything. You
think it’s happening, it’s just happening.

15:02.278 --> 15:07.504
There is another idea that this sort
of a deep research

15:07.705 --> 15:12.907
brings you into the state of absolute and
maybe this absolute is a monistic idea,

15:13.107 --> 15:17.023
you feel by yourself or the whole world
is yourself.

15:17.205 --> 15:21.438
Now listening to You I get the impression
that it is exactly the opposite,

15:21.638 --> 15:25.733
that you communicate with everybody so
it’s more of a communal approach

15:25.933 --> 15:30.202
than something which is lonely. And it is –
it is a miracle how

15:30.403 --> 15:35.372
by coming into yourself you reach out
everybody else.

15:35.573 --> 15:38.051
Now I think You would agree with me that
it is wrong

15:38.252 --> 15:41.478
to think of Orient as something mystic,

15:41.678 --> 15:46.465
as something which is cut off the world.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, it’s universal.

15:46.666 --> 15:51.087
Now we have 56 nations we are working with
this Sahaja Yoga.

15:51.287 --> 15:54.824
Specially in Russia surprisingly we have
thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis.

15:55.036 --> 15:57.017
Interviewer: Very recently?
Shri Mataji: Yes, very recently,

15:57.217 --> 16:01.374
about three years. Within three years we’ve
got thousands and thousands of them.

16:01.575 --> 16:06.478
You see, I think in the democratic
countries we had too much time to waste.

16:06.678 --> 16:11.616
Like you see choices, this, that, all kinds
of problems for nothing at all.

16:11.817 --> 16:15.645
While they were limited and they had
given up all this nonsense.

16:15.846 --> 16:18.315
They thought now, whatever is available
is available, like,

16:18.515 --> 16:21.666
you see there is no solution, So give
it up.

16:21.866 --> 16:25.059
And that’s how they are very introspective
I think. So Russia has –

16:25.260 --> 16:28.499
Russia and also Eastern Block people are
in thousands,

16:28.700 --> 16:32.184
who got realization. Also of course India
they know it,

16:32.385 --> 16:35.347
so we have in thousands also, I must admit
that;

16:35.534 --> 16:41.874
but so many countries like Austria, Italy
specially

16:42.075 --> 16:45.210
is now so fed up with all that’s going on
in Italy,

16:45.411 --> 16:48.465
that now they have taken to Sahaja Yoga
very strongly,

16:48.666 --> 16:53.063
and all kinds of people are coming. So
it is something that has to happen,

16:53.288 --> 16:57.819
was to happen, is already predicted, and
it’s taking place.

16:58.020 --> 17:04.629
And tell me - we are referring to countries
with a very strong tradition in religion,

17:04.829 --> 17:10.554
say Italy is a very strong Catholic country,
Russia has an orthodox past.

17:10.754 --> 17:14.464
How about the very different systems like
Africa, or like

17:14.664 --> 17:18.163
the United States of America? That,
You know, this is the new world

17:18.364 --> 17:22.415
in terms of a sharp difference in the way
of thinking and approaching the world.

17:22.615 --> 17:26.548
How is Your message delivered there?
Shri Mataji: You see, actually

17:26.748 --> 17:31.467
all these incarnations whether it was
Christ, or Rama, Krishna, Mohammed,

17:31.667 --> 17:34.591
any one of them... Interviewer: You call
them incarnations of…

17:34.791 --> 17:40.176
All of them were incarnations, you see -
they were born on the same tree of life,

17:40.377 --> 17:45.536
of spirituality. All of them, like
beautiful flowers at different times.

17:45.736 --> 17:47.895
But people plucked the flowers, you see,

17:48.096 --> 17:50.778
and now they are fighting with the dead
flowers.

17:50.978 --> 17:56.932
So you see that there is though religion
within it’s just outside, you see.

17:57.132 --> 18:01.665
We’ll go to church, we can do anything,
we can go to a mosque

18:01.865 --> 18:04.152
we can do anything, we go to temple, do
anything.

18:04.352 --> 18:07.192
I mean, there’s nothing inside the religion,

18:07.393 --> 18:11.278
but with this the inside religion is
awakened, and you become righteous,

18:11.479 --> 18:13.834
really you become an angel, I tell you.

18:14.035 --> 18:18.666
So tell me, you become an angel, but you
still live in this world…

18:18.866 --> 18:22.284
…and You know there is some things that
we have - we are used

18:22.484 --> 18:26.390
in referring when we talk about religions.
And I am wondering

18:26.590 --> 18:29.938
whether we can refer to this way
of approaching of truth

18:30.138 --> 18:32.925
and viewing the world as we already know

18:33.125 --> 18:37.176
and I’m trying to refer to certain fixed
ideas.

18:37.376 --> 18:44.445
Religions have ethics, and they have codes
of living, codes of how you behave,

18:44.645 --> 18:48.020
how you make love, what is a sin, what is
not a sin.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.378
Now what is Your approach on all these
things?

18:50.578 --> 18:53.562
See, My approach is such that by all, see,
they have failed completely.

18:53.762 --> 18:57.921
Nobody does that. Really, it’s a fact,
we should face it.

18:58.122 --> 19:02.583
Actually when it is within you, then you
become your own master,

19:02.783 --> 19:05.645
you yourself know, like, I would say
an example:

19:05.846 --> 19:09.747
supposing I’m holding a snake and there’s
darkness, I can’t see him.

19:09.965 --> 19:12.489
Now you tell me it’s a snake. I will not
accept, I’ll say

19:12.690 --> 19:16.140
“No, no, it’s not a snake, I’m holding
a rope, supposing”.

19:16.307 --> 19:19.100
But if there is little light I’ll
immediately leave it.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.793
You don’t have to tell me anything.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.752
In the same way then, when you are
enlightened you see for yourself.

19:24.952 --> 19:29.661
We have seen people overnight giving up –
overnight giving up drugs.

19:29.862 --> 19:31.976
Overnight. Once they get realization

19:32.176 --> 19:34.879
just I don’t have to tell them. They
themselves do it

19:35.079 --> 19:38.196
because they have their own light, their
own power.

19:38.396 --> 19:42.113
What is a sinner or a failing person,
for Your way of approach?

19:42.313 --> 19:44.310
You see it is our ego which tells us that
this is sin,

19:44.510 --> 19:46.536
this is not a sin...
Interviewer: It is our ego.

19:46.737 --> 19:49.498
And also conditionings, you see. Both
things are there

19:49.710 --> 19:51.838
that they say this is a sin. For some
Muslim

19:52.038 --> 19:54.372
this is a sin, for a Hindu this is a sin.

19:54.573 --> 19:57.474
How can there be different types of sin?

19:57.674 --> 20:04.012
Sin could be - has to be universal, isn’t
it after all, if it is a sin.

20:04.213 --> 20:08.069
So when you get your realization, you
realize

20:08.269 --> 20:11.824
that you are now above everything else

20:12.024 --> 20:14.811
and you just don’t do anything wrong, just
you don’t do it.

20:15.012 --> 20:17.741
You don’t like it, you just don’t do it.

20:17.941 --> 20:20.282
But, You see, we have created a world that

20:20.482 --> 20:23.914
we have constructed this wrong, I mean,
say

20:24.114 --> 20:27.379
you are a Muslim and you have a right
in marrying two, four women

20:27.580 --> 20:30.739
and in our system this is not accepted.

20:30.940 --> 20:34.715
Now, how can you know – how can You know
whether this is correct or not?

20:34.916 --> 20:39.668
Now see, at that time, when Mohammed
Sahib was there, you see He was attacked,

20:39.869 --> 20:43.194
it was a tribe and tribes were attacked
all the time.

20:43.395 --> 20:47.786
And all the young people died and I mean,
there were very few men left

20:47.987 --> 20:50.957
and He didn’t want prostitution. So He
thought

20:51.157 --> 20:59.189
is best is - now the - let men can marry
women who are now without marriages.

20:59.390 --> 21:02.242
So He believed in the marriage and He said,
“You should marry”.

21:02.442 --> 21:05.345
Now there were some young girls also, they
couldn’t get husbands

21:05.545 --> 21:08.806
He said “Still you should marry”, otherwise
they would have become prostitutes.

21:09.006 --> 21:11.810
So to get rid of that thing he said
“Alright”.

21:12.010 --> 21:14.366
It is what we call in Sanskrit
“samayachar”:

21:14.567 --> 21:17.009
according to the time the incarnations act.

21:17.209 --> 21:22.936
For example at this time of mine my work
is to give realization, that’s all.

21:23.137 --> 21:27.733
My, My only job is to give realization
to people, so I have to do that.

21:27.934 --> 21:32.010
So this is the time – every – like
in a growth of a tree, you see,

21:32.210 --> 21:35.602
first there are roots, and then there are
shoots and then gradually

21:35.802 --> 21:39.358
it grows and it comes to a point when
it becomes, say the flowers.

21:39.559 --> 21:42.836
So I call it a blossom time, because
so many flowers

21:43.036 --> 21:45.569
are becoming fruits. So the time has come.

21:45.769 --> 21:49.828
Is a time which is ripen for this new age
to come in.

21:50.028 --> 21:53.576
And without that we cannot solve the problem
of our world.

21:53.776 --> 21:58.097
I think it is a very pragmatic and very
human way of approaching life,

21:58.298 --> 22:01.522
and You are right; but let me, let me
insist on that.

22:01.723 --> 22:06.186
I have, you know, in front of me
a Holy Mother

22:06.387 --> 22:10.378
with the signs of the way, say, men treat
women,

22:10.578 --> 22:14.421
you have a very obvious sign that you are
married.

22:14.621 --> 22:18.538
I’m wondering, does this way of approaching
the world affect the relations

22:18.739 --> 22:21.402
between men and women? What is the opinion
of...

22:21.602 --> 22:23.852
No, marriage is very important.
Interviewer: Marriage is very important.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.856
For us, you see, marriage is very
important.

22:26.056 --> 22:29.714
This year we had 86 international marriages.
Eighty-six.

22:29.914 --> 22:31.987
Interviewer: What do You mean international?
Mixed, ok.

22:32.187 --> 22:34.904
International, between different countries.
I mean, one Greek lady

22:35.104 --> 22:37.551
was married to a French man, see?
Interviewer: I see.

22:37.751 --> 22:40.927
Shri Mataji: So – and their children are
realized souls, most of them are,

22:41.127 --> 22:44.017
very surprising, they are very beautiful
children they get.

22:44.217 --> 22:49.616
But out of these marriages we – we should
say one percent or two percent

22:49.817 --> 22:54.514
there’s problem still. But otherwise they
are all very successful marriages,

22:54.715 --> 22:59.811
beautiful marriages and they enjoy it.
That’s a part of life, one has to marry,

23:00.012 --> 23:05.491
all this nonsense of not marrying and doing
all these things I don’t believe in it,

23:05.692 --> 23:09.421
because it’s a natural thing, whatever
is natural has to be there.

23:09.622 --> 23:14.349
And do You think that, say, the way that
people get married

23:14.549 --> 23:16.868
in the Jewish tradition is different than

23:17.068 --> 23:19.034
the way they married in the Methodist
tradition

23:19.234 --> 23:23.522
- now would You then accept all these
methods that people have,

23:23.723 --> 23:26.889
or they are used to, or they are born in?

23:27.090 --> 23:30.069
Shri Mataji: Of what? Interviewer: Or how
people get married,

23:30.270 --> 23:32.325
according to Your lifestyle?

23:32.526 --> 23:35.556
You see, in our lifestyle, what we do now,

23:35.756 --> 23:38.421
supposing somebody wants to marry somebody,
it’s alright.

23:38.622 --> 23:40.974
If they come and tell me: “Mother, I want
to marry somebody” it’s alright,

23:41.174 --> 23:44.598
but we see the vibrations and things. And
also I mean there should not be

23:44.799 --> 23:48.317
too much disparity and all that, but as we
say “alright”.

23:48.517 --> 23:53.094
But supposing they want that we should
select for them, say it is so.

23:53.294 --> 23:57.387
Then, what we do, one month they are
together in one tour we have.

23:57.587 --> 24:02.155
In that we, we see their vibrations, we see
their aptitudes,

24:02.356 --> 24:05.139
we have forms to say what is your aptitude,

24:05.340 --> 24:08.057
would you like to go to another country,
what country you like,

24:08.257 --> 24:10.800
what’s your height is, what’s your
education,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.164
and what’s, where have you been before
for seeking, and all that -

24:15.364 --> 24:19.055
so we get all the complete bio data of that
person.

24:19.255 --> 24:23.147
And then we suggest that such and such
a person will be alright.

24:23.348 --> 24:27.366
In one month they see the person, if he/she
suits or not –

24:27.567 --> 24:30.967
if they don’t they inform, then they can
have another choice,

24:31.168 --> 24:33.710
whichever way they like. But it is not
at random.

24:33.911 --> 24:37.272
We little bit guide them because they
should also know

24:37.473 --> 24:40.452
the background of the person, what sort
of a person he is -

24:40.653 --> 24:45.858
just you don’t fall in love like that, so
again you get into trouble.

24:46.059 --> 24:52.858
And I mean, it has worked very well,
because it’s such an understanding

24:53.058 --> 24:56.405
that they are marrying a person whom they
know very well,

24:56.606 --> 24:59.772
and also they are marrying a person who
will –

24:59.973 --> 25:04.796
who has got these angelic qualities, you
see, so they do not fail.

25:04.997 --> 25:08.187
And when they actually realize that after
all this training,

25:08.387 --> 25:10.909
and after all this hard time you give them
- for their good,

25:11.109 --> 25:14.427
for their sake of their happiness,
certainly -

25:14.627 --> 25:17.990
that they suit each other, how do they get
married:

25:18.190 --> 25:20.505
according to their own traditions or
according to a Hindu tradition?

25:20.705 --> 25:22.548
No, we have what is a Sahaja Yoga style
of marriage.

25:22.748 --> 25:25.325
Interviewer: There is a mystery as we call it.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no mystery at all,

25:25.525 --> 25:30.491
there is no mystery in Sahaja Yoga. We talk
about all the centers,

25:30.692 --> 25:34.840
take the name of all the centers, and all
the deities on the centers,

25:35.041 --> 25:39.642
and then we say “Now by these centers you
have to be married”;

25:39.842 --> 25:43.941
and that’s how they have to promise that
they will look after their centers,

25:44.141 --> 25:47.092
they’ll look after their life in a way

25:47.293 --> 25:49.936
that should be righteous and that’s how
they get married.

25:50.137 --> 25:55.085
We have open system. There is no mystery
in Sahaja Yoga. No mystery.

25:55.286 --> 25:59.397
You see it is very, is very tempting the way
that You approach the world

25:59.598 --> 26:05.796
because it gives you no doubt that there
is no… nothing in darkness.

26:05.997 --> 26:09.270
Now, let me take another phenomenon which
is very old but very modern.

26:09.470 --> 26:12.210
We talk about love and people matching with
each other.

26:12.411 --> 26:15.262
There is two men that want to get, to live
together

26:15.463 --> 26:18.899
and we call them homosexuals, what is your,
the way You approach that?

26:19.099 --> 26:21.210
I think it’s rather unnatural.

26:21.411 --> 26:24.015
Also I have seen people who had this kind
of problems,

26:24.215 --> 26:29.233
they came to Me, they were possessed. A man
was possessed by a woman

26:29.434 --> 26:34.518
so he wanted to have a man, you see, but
once the possession went away

26:34.718 --> 26:37.733
he became very normal. Men are very easy -

26:37.934 --> 26:40.723
they take to married life very easily.

26:40.924 --> 26:45.903
Women I think if they are homosexuals then
it takes some time to get alright,

26:46.103 --> 26:49.671
I don’t know. Maybe emotionally they feel
disturbed or whatever it is!

26:49.872 --> 26:52.874
But men are absolutely alright.

26:53.074 --> 26:55.792
How would You describe normal and natural?

26:55.992 --> 27:00.092
Normal person is that a man wants to marry
a woman, is normal.

27:00.293 --> 27:02.622
In India we cannot even conceive this,

27:02.823 --> 27:05.726
I’ve never known before this kind of have
happens, you see.

27:05.926 --> 27:08.446
Do You think it hasn’t happened or we don’t
know of it?

27:08.646 --> 27:11.894
No, no, we… Maybe in India they might be
doing something.

27:12.094 --> 27:15.561
But we had never known anyone like that,

27:15.762 --> 27:18.653
when I was in the medical studies also,
I never knew that such things.

27:18.854 --> 27:22.004
I am sure that now that You come, You go
around the world and...

27:22.204 --> 27:26.366
Now of course after coming to the West then
we’ve discovered all this...

27:26.567 --> 27:29.279
Of course it doesn’t happen only among men,
it happens among women as well.

27:29.479 --> 27:33.067
Yeah – but I think you see, maybe there may
be some reasons,

27:33.267 --> 27:37.066
also I met one gentleman who was a guard
of the Queen

27:37.266 --> 27:41.245
and he became homosexual because his wife
was very nasty,

27:41.445 --> 27:43.611
and she tortured him very much. So…

27:43.811 --> 27:46.354
So You think there is always an explanation,
something bad happening.

27:46.554 --> 27:49.378
Yes, so he thought that it’s better to have
a man, you see,

27:49.578 --> 27:52.566
no problems, no quarrelling. That’s how
he became,

27:52.766 --> 27:56.863
but when he came to Sahaja Yoga and he got
completely transformed

27:57.063 --> 28:00.888
he got a nice wife, now he is having
children, he is very happy.

28:01.088 --> 28:05.272
So I think it is abnormal conditions and
problems

28:05.473 --> 28:08.572
that people take to this sometimes.

28:08.772 --> 28:13.499
There are many reasons for that but it can
be corrected if they want to.

28:13.700 --> 28:18.191
If they don’t want you cannot force it. You
cannot force Self realization on anyone.

28:18.391 --> 28:21.499
But you can accept them as people who try
and to achieve purity…

28:21.700 --> 28:25.244
Yes, if they want to… But once they come
to Sahaja Yoga they change automatically.

28:25.444 --> 28:28.232
Can they remain unchanged on these aspects?

28:28.432 --> 28:30.987
So far we didn’t have anyone like that.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.020
I see. Now tell me about confession.

28:33.221 --> 28:37.458
It is, it is something that we are familiar
in Christianity.

28:37.658 --> 28:40.553
There is someone like, automatically when
you hear

28:40.753 --> 28:45.710
about a Holy Mother for instance there
comes a time that there is some hierarchy.

28:45.911 --> 28:49.097
Now how is the hierarchy between mortals
in...

28:49.297 --> 28:52.942
No, we don’t have anything like that. You
see, when they come to Sahaja Yoga

28:53.142 --> 28:57.960
mostly the Christians, Catholics and all
that, they send Me such thick letters

28:58.161 --> 29:00.598
describing what all wrong they have done,
this, that -

29:00.799 --> 29:04.002
I don’t ever read it, I just burn it off.
It’s not important.

29:04.202 --> 29:06.663
Interviewer: You should return them, see.
Shri Mataji: You see, yes, it’s no good.

29:06.864 --> 29:10.191
Because you see past is past, finished now.
Forget it.

29:10.391 --> 29:13.616
Why – it’s over. Interviewer: But how can
they not repeat them,

29:13.816 --> 29:16.916
if, You know, if they are not aware that
this is wrong

29:17.116 --> 29:19.921
or there is something that they should pay
attention…

29:20.122 --> 29:24.803
You see, what happens that it’s all a game
of the ego and conditioning.

29:25.004 --> 29:27.482
The ego goes on telling: “You did this
wrong, you did that wrong”,

29:27.682 --> 29:30.139
they feel guilty all the time. There’s no
need

29:30.340 --> 29:33.320
to feel guilty or anything. It just works
out,

29:33.520 --> 29:37.483
you see, you are human beings. After all
only human beings can commit mistakes,

29:37.684 --> 29:41.919
you are not gods, what is there to be so
much angry with yourself for that?

29:42.119 --> 29:46.147
Just you should know that you can become
the Spirit which is a pure thing.

29:46.347 --> 29:51.904
Like we say that in the pond, you see, when
you are in the pond there can be worms

29:52.104 --> 29:55.450
and all sorts of things, but when you become
the lotus

29:55.650 --> 29:59.382
you are fragrant, you are above it, nothing
can spoil you.

29:59.582 --> 30:03.030
In the same way you get that life, eternal
life. So…

30:03.231 --> 30:06.147
But it’s true, but who tells you whether
you are right or wrong?

30:06.348 --> 30:08.506
Shri Mataji: You yourself.
Interviewer: But...

30:08.706 --> 30:11.161
You see, I don’t have to tell you because
you feel it yourself

30:11.361 --> 30:13.548
that goodness within you, you feel it
yourself.

30:13.748 --> 30:15.986
Interviewer: You mean that when you are
right you feel it…

30:16.186 --> 30:18.728
Shri Mataji: You feel it. Interviewer: Even
when you are wrong you feel it.

30:18.928 --> 30:22.741
Shri Mataji: Not normally, you see, right
and wrong is a different concept.

30:22.942 --> 30:28.301
It is like this that you feel, when you get
this thing you feel

30:28.501 --> 30:32.483
within yourself that you know the absolute,
because you can use it.

30:32.683 --> 30:35.598
Say now, supposing somebody is suffering
from a cancer,

30:35.798 --> 30:38.105
now you put your hands to that person,
ask –

30:38.305 --> 30:40.874
now what happens you know the chakras
which are catching.

30:41.075 --> 30:43.155
Immediately you know the person has cancer.
He may not know,

30:43.356 --> 30:45.616
doctors may not know, but you know.

30:45.817 --> 30:51.217
Then you ask the question about yourself:
“What’s… Is it alright?”.

30:51.418 --> 30:55.075
You can ask, because you are now one with
the absolute truth.

30:55.276 --> 30:58.741
So there is no question of anybody telling
you about it, you just know.

30:58.942 --> 31:01.764
Like people will come and tell Me: ‘Mother,
see, this Agnya chakra is catching”.

31:01.965 --> 31:06.678
Is the, is the centre of Christ. That means
that person is suffering from ego.

31:06.879 --> 31:09.055
But we never say “I am suffering from ego”
normally.

31:09.255 --> 31:12.435
Interviewer: Especially from ego we don’t.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no one says that.

31:12.635 --> 31:15.056
So now when, what happens that when you

31:15.256 --> 31:17.014
come and tell Me that “my Agnya is
catching”

31:17.214 --> 31:21.085
means that you have ego, alright, this,
it can be corrected...

31:21.285 --> 31:22.749
Interviewer: It can be corrected.
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course.

31:22.950 --> 31:28.694
Now we are dealing with treating
the consciousness and health.

31:28.895 --> 31:31.153
Now what is a miracle to You?
Shri Mataji: What is a?

31:31.353 --> 31:34.100
What is a miracle? Does it mean anything
or is just...

31:34.300 --> 31:36.131
Shri Mataji: I don’t think it’s a miracle.
Interviewer: … one thing among others.

31:36.331 --> 31:40.186
I mean, it’s a way to absolute…
Shri Mataji: Yes,

31:40.387 --> 31:42.640
it is, it is your position in your
evolution.

31:42.840 --> 31:45.361
You see, like first they say we were
chimpanzees.

31:45.561 --> 31:47.722
Alright, take this case, chimpanzees.

31:47.922 --> 31:51.663
Now, some chimpanzees became some other
human beings, other human beings,

31:51.864 --> 31:56.311
that all those human beings have no more.
Now we are there,

31:56.511 --> 31:59.428
so there is a big gap between us and
the chimpanzees.

31:59.628 --> 32:06.208
Like us who are realized souls and human
beings there is a gap.

32:06.408 --> 32:12.803
Now how many human beings will become
the spiritual beings, you can’t say.

32:13.004 --> 32:17.423
They should. According to John it is only
144 thousand,

32:17.623 --> 32:19.344
but I think we have already crossed
the limit.

32:19.544 --> 32:22.321
Interviewer: According to John…
Shri Mataji: John the – John,

32:22.521 --> 32:25.663
the disciple of Christ. Interviewer: Oh
I see, so You quote the apostles, I see.

32:25.863 --> 32:27.129
Shri Mataji: The Revelation, yes.
Interviewer: I see.

32:27.330 --> 32:31.455
So. But maybe his counting was wrong,
because we have already crossed

32:31.655 --> 32:34.264
the limit. I think. Whatever it is,

32:34.465 --> 32:41.569
so now when you become the spiritual being
then these people are left behind.

32:41.770 --> 32:45.460
Now see how we are destroying ourselves
otherwise.

32:45.661 --> 32:51.155
See this AIDS business... You go to America
and you are shocked:

32:51.356 --> 32:53.727
people are so nervous, they have
schizophrenia,

32:53.927 --> 32:58.553
they have this disease, that disease, and
all kinds of destructive things -

32:58.753 --> 33:01.394
now listening to this horrible music they
go deaf,

33:01.594 --> 33:05.507
and then they lose their hair, and all kinds
of things are happening.

33:05.708 --> 33:09.201
But always they take to something
destructive. Everything,

33:09.401 --> 33:14.913
like a man sees somebody going in the pub
and coming out and falling down.

33:15.114 --> 33:17.932
Another one goes, pays to fall down Again,
I mean –

33:18.132 --> 33:20.842
you see, he can’t see that this is
destructive.

33:21.043 --> 33:24.977
But after realization you see what is
destructive, what is constructive.

33:25.177 --> 33:28.294
So a person who is realized starts rising
much higher

33:28.494 --> 33:32.932
than the person who is not realized. And
there is a big gap, I find, there is -

33:33.132 --> 33:37.046
but it can be crossed like that, in one
month’s time he can change.

33:37.247 --> 33:39.524
Interviewer: In one month’s time.
Shri Mataji: You see, he becomes an expert.

33:39.724 --> 33:42.461
That’s very quick process. Now tell me:
in all religions

33:42.661 --> 33:47.288
there is different stages, grades as you
grow up.

33:47.489 --> 33:50.160
Now, is there any education for small
children?

33:50.360 --> 33:54.175
How do they – how they are introduced
in this system of Yoga?

33:54.375 --> 33:56.323
Shri Mataji: Who?
Interviewer: Young children.

33:56.523 --> 33:59.840
You see, young children, if they are born
realized, they immediately know Me.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.273
Interviewer: So they can be - they can do
that at what age?

34:03.473 --> 34:05.613
Shri Mataji: You see, even very little
babies. Interviewer: Really!

34:05.813 --> 34:10.334
They see Me, they start smiling and just
talking to Me, it’s very sweet.

34:10.534 --> 34:12.957
And on the whole children are very good
for realization

34:13.157 --> 34:16.842
because they are pure souls, they are
innocent. They are the best.

34:17.043 --> 34:22.993
I mean, normally you see, we nowadays
of course we are getting very much worried

34:23.193 --> 34:26.998
about children, because they are getting
spoilt, and this and that,

34:27.198 --> 34:31.399
but when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they
become excellent children.

34:31.599 --> 34:35.355
Now we have a school also in India now,
on the Himalayas,

34:35.555 --> 34:40.436
we have a beautiful school for children
and everybody says they are so matured,

34:40.637 --> 34:44.070
so wise, so sensible, so respectful.

34:44.270 --> 34:47.907
It’s really worth seeing them the way they
behave and so on.

34:48.107 --> 34:52.256
Because, you see, their Spirit starts
manifesting.

34:52.456 --> 34:58.038
Now would You describe a certain practice
of prayers

34:58.239 --> 35:02.130
or anything else that is a must for some
of your disciples?

35:02.330 --> 35:05.225
You see there is – there is no prescribed
thing as such

35:05.426 --> 35:10.554
but according to your centers. Now if some
centre is in jeopardy

35:10.754 --> 35:15.358
or there is a problem with any centre then
you should know how to cure it

35:15.558 --> 35:18.710
and correct it. And there are few things
you have to do

35:18.911 --> 35:21.497
by which you can correct it. It’s very
simple.

35:21.697 --> 35:23.458
Interviewer: It is.
Shri Mataji: Yes, extremely.

35:23.659 --> 35:28.632
Well, I’m sure that there is plenty of time
for You to meet with people

35:28.833 --> 35:32.664
around the world as You travel non-stop.
Now tell me about...

35:32.864 --> 35:37.892
But see, but at the most three-four days
I am at home, and then I travel.

35:38.092 --> 35:39.379
Interviewer: You travel. Shri Mataji: Yes.
Interviewer: How…

35:39.579 --> 35:42.341
With India I’m there for about two months
with My family.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.237
They also come down here sometimes,
you know.

35:45.437 --> 35:51.007
Now how did this all started? I mean, now
You are something of an apostle.

35:51.207 --> 35:54.385
I mean, how did it all - what is
the inspiration for You to do all this?

35:54.585 --> 35:58.856
Are You - do You consider Yourself as the
founder of this way of approaching truth?

35:59.056 --> 36:02.914
That’s what we say, but you see, actually
Sahaja Yoga is an ancient system.

36:03.114 --> 36:06.764
As I told you it was only for one person
they used to use.

36:06.965 --> 36:11.787
But what you say if I am the founder
of this en masse movement, I am.

36:11.987 --> 36:15.098
Interviewer: You are. Shri Mataji: But
it is, it is all there already,

36:15.299 --> 36:18.155
it was there, all these things were there,

36:18.356 --> 36:22.462
only thing if I have worked anything is
the permutations and combinations

36:22.662 --> 36:28.215
as I said about human beings, why is it
that they cannot get en masse realization.

36:28.415 --> 36:32.730
Any discovery, whatever it is, if it cannot
be used by masses is useless.

36:32.930 --> 36:35.616
And I worked it out and it’s done through
Me.

36:35.817 --> 36:39.919
Interviewer: It is a system that approaches
people. Now how do You,

36:40.119 --> 36:44.413
tell us, tell us about Your life now. You
are really someone who preaches

36:44.614 --> 36:49.085
a new message around the world. How is it
accepted?

36:49.286 --> 36:55.046
Very much. Because this is a time, special
time, modern times,

36:55.247 --> 36:59.264
it’s called as Kali Yuga in India.
It’s the worst times, you see.

36:59.465 --> 37:02.561
And all kinds of sins will be done, all
kinds of things.

37:02.762 --> 37:06.678
They describe horrible things for this -
but at the same time

37:06.879 --> 37:13.475
there will be a category of people who are
seekers of truth. And so many of them.

37:13.676 --> 37:18.725
It’s already prophesized - William Blake
in England, you see,

37:18.926 --> 37:26.014
he has written about it that there will be
men of God who will be born in those days

37:26.215 --> 37:32.241
and they will have the capacity to become
divine

37:32.442 --> 37:36.444
and make others. He has clearly described
it.

37:36.644 --> 37:40.850
So him, in another part of the world, with
his own education,

37:41.051 --> 37:44.663
reached with his means what You reached
in other ways.

37:44.864 --> 37:48.043
Do You have relationships, or do You meet

37:48.243 --> 37:52.569
with people who are leading figures
of other religions?

37:52.770 --> 37:54.608
Shri Mataji: Rather difficult.
Interviewer: Why?

37:54.809 --> 38:00.178
Because, you see, they have set ideas.
And most of the religions are

38:00.379 --> 38:03.620
either power-oriented or money-oriented,
they are not Spirit-oriented.

38:03.820 --> 38:05.619
Interviewer: I see. Well, that is very
serious.

38:05.819 --> 38:09.338
This is a big problem you know. If they
were Spirit-oriented,

38:09.538 --> 38:11.803
I would have loved to meet them and talk
to them,

38:12.004 --> 38:14.482
but they are not. You see, this is a big
problem.

38:14.682 --> 38:18.749
And would You say, would You consider
the people that follow You

38:18.950 --> 38:21.788
and live with You as a church, in the…?
Shri Mataji: Same thing with the…

38:21.988 --> 38:24.280
I was born in a Christian family Myself.
Interviewer: I see.

38:24.480 --> 38:27.456
Well then, do You think it is as easy
for a Christian

38:27.656 --> 38:32.358
as for anybody else to reach out and find
this way?

38:32.559 --> 38:37.477
Christians abroad are alright because they
seem that they have started now

38:37.677 --> 38:40.601
thinking that they have to have something
more than the church, you see,

38:40.801 --> 38:45.257
church is not sufficient. Like they are now
closing down all the churches everywhere,

38:45.458 --> 38:47.725
so there’s something has to be found out.

38:47.926 --> 38:51.163
But Christians in some places like India
are -

38:51.363 --> 38:55.230
are not like that, they are not seeking.

38:55.430 --> 39:00.835
They think that, that the Christians abroad
are saintly people, you see?

39:01.036 --> 39:05.225
Also some of them believe that Christ was
born in England! Can You believe that?

39:05.426 --> 39:09.389
Well I am sure that if Christ appears like
a British gentleman,

39:09.590 --> 39:13.139
because the system we have made out of Him
is not Palestinian at all,

39:13.340 --> 39:15.475
and you realize that there is a twist
anyway...

39:15.676 --> 39:20.405
It is ignorance, complete ignorance about
even Christ is there.

39:20.606 --> 39:25.417
But after Sahaja Yoga you realize who He
was, what was His greatness.

39:25.617 --> 39:30.012
And really I mean you know what important
work He has done.

39:30.212 --> 39:33.366
Without Him I could not have managed Sahaja
Yoga.

39:33.567 --> 39:35.460
So all of them are very necessary

39:35.661 --> 39:41.483
and He is the last gate we have to open
and that’s what He’s done.

39:41.684 --> 39:44.230
But how contradictory we are.

39:44.430 --> 39:47.389
Like we say that He suffered for our sins,

39:47.590 --> 39:51.583
still why should we suffer now anymore?
It’s very contradictory

39:51.784 --> 39:54.725
that we should suffer for Christ. Why?

39:54.926 --> 39:58.872
No father likes you to suffer. Why will
he like you to suffer?

39:59.073 --> 40:04.215
So this sufferings and all this is not
necessary.

40:04.416 --> 40:08.596
Can you tell us how this group of people
who live in the way

40:08.796 --> 40:13.061
You explained to us in Greece what do
they do? How do they live?

40:13.261 --> 40:14.973
I mean, people would like to know.
Shri Mataji: That in Greece?

40:15.174 --> 40:17.783
Oh, they are very dynamics, dynamic people.

40:17.983 --> 40:22.796
They have doing very well in life, most
of them are

40:22.997 --> 40:27.897
very much improved in health and in every
way, their married life has improved -

40:28.098 --> 40:32.275
of course in one or two cases the, some
of the very orthodox people have tried

40:32.475 --> 40:38.483
to trouble them. But most of them are very
happy, doing very well.

40:38.684 --> 40:45.466
Well, you seem to think that we are viewing
a very healthy if not wealthy group.

40:45.666 --> 40:50.757
Do you address poor people, miserable
people, people that are desperate as well?

40:50.958 --> 40:57.608
You see, poor people are – it’s more on
the middle, middle class work is better.

40:57.809 --> 41:02.502
Because poor don’t have any money just now,
they want to have food,

41:02.702 --> 41:07.440
so they don’t think of Spirit so much. But
if you once have

41:07.640 --> 41:13.348
this spiritual awakening, from the middle
group then they go to the poor

41:13.549 --> 41:18.233
and they can help, because there is free
health services, there is -

41:18.433 --> 41:22.795
also these vibrations give you tremendous
amount of energy

41:22.995 --> 41:27.620
to grow more food; you see, the crops
improve, the cattle improves,

41:27.820 --> 41:31.366
so that’s how you help your farmers, so
that’s how it works out.

41:31.567 --> 41:35.397
But the rich are difficult, because as
Christ as said…

41:35.598 --> 41:38.022
Interviewer: They have, they have it all.
They are self-sustained.

41:38.223 --> 41:41.700
… they think, they think we’re alright.
But money has problems,

41:41.900 --> 41:47.239
lots of problems, and so they also come.
Even politicians come,

41:47.440 --> 41:51.810
but I must say that they are rather slow
people -

41:52.030 --> 41:54.400
bureaucrats, politicians, are rather slow.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.858
Interviewer: They are the slow ones. They
keep the world not spinning enough.

41:58.059 --> 42:02.753
Now, how modern do You think that Your
message could be for young people

42:02.953 --> 42:11.225
who are, you know, dealing with loud music,
and speed, and violence, and new ideas…?

42:11.426 --> 42:16.004
You see this is meta-modern, I’m talking
of meta-modern era,

42:16.204 --> 42:23.446
where people will not have any violence
because it’s compassion and love.

42:23.646 --> 42:27.897
You’ll feel the love for another person.
There’s no question of violence.

42:28.098 --> 42:32.553
And in this meta-modern era

42:32.754 --> 42:37.770
there will be no racialism, no fanaticism,
no fundamentalism,

42:37.971 --> 42:43.754
all ”isms” will drop out. Because “isms”
are just conditionings and ignorance.

42:43.955 --> 42:47.235
Interviewer: “Isms” are schisms.
Shri Mataji: Isms - they are isms.

42:47.435 --> 42:52.575
Sahaja Yoga is no ism. It is being, it is
reality.

42:52.776 --> 42:56.240
So you do not have these problems at all.
After this

42:56.458 --> 43:01.135
we have people from all over the world –
I’ve never seen them quarrelling, fighting

43:01.335 --> 43:04.364
- of course they pull each other’s leg
sometimes, they are very humorous

43:04.565 --> 43:07.604
and they enjoy life, just enjoy.

43:07.804 --> 43:10.575
We are not bothered as to what their jobs
are or things,

43:10.776 --> 43:15.287
but they are telling Me that they are
getting so many results out of this -

43:15.487 --> 43:19.613
here only they told Me the some
of the photographers got 1st prizes

43:19.813 --> 43:27.551
for their photography, some musicians got
very high, high salaries

43:27.752 --> 43:32.106
and things like that, you see. So it shows
that once you are in balance and in peace,

43:32.306 --> 43:37.536
you can achieve much more than when you
are disturbed.

43:37.736 --> 43:40.685
You see, You come into a country that has
the idea

43:40.885 --> 43:44.587
of a very homogeneous total population,

43:44.787 --> 43:47.865
that all belong to one ethnic group, and
they have one race,

43:48.065 --> 43:51.819
and have one religion. And this is very
useful for us in this country

43:52.020 --> 43:56.438
to realize that it is not so, that there is
people who think in different way,

43:56.638 --> 44:00.279
who approach the same truth and the same
life in a very different way.

44:00.479 --> 44:03.536
Now, what will be Your message when You
will meet them tomorrow

44:03.737 --> 44:06.910
apart from all that you have told us about?

44:07.110 --> 44:08.519
Shri Mataji: For the people here?
Interviewer: Yes.

44:08.719 --> 44:13.008
You see, actually this is - they have
to know their heritage.

44:13.208 --> 44:18.067
This is their heritage I am talking about.
You see, they cannot learn anything

44:18.267 --> 44:21.013
from these Eastern – (She corrects Herself)
Western people.

44:21.213 --> 44:24.708
You have to teach them, you can, because
your heritage is here

44:24.909 --> 44:27.598
and you are so traditionally bound people.

44:27.799 --> 44:30.981
But somehow it is lost, I don’t know why
it is lost.

44:31.182 --> 44:34.351
If you can come back to it, and the whole
world can learn from you,

44:34.552 --> 44:37.484
no doubt about it. So it is so important.

44:37.684 --> 44:41.994
And it is such a great discovery. Once you
discover what you are,

44:42.194 --> 44:46.548
you know how, how glorified you are, how
great you are

44:46.748 --> 44:50.147
and the whole self-esteem and everything
comes within you,

44:50.348 --> 44:58.219
and you become very eminent, dignified and
a very beautiful person.

44:58.583 --> 45:03.173
You see, we've been listening to a wise
voice that reminds us of our past,

45:03.373 --> 45:07.911
of our traditions, of the traditions
of this country, of another country;

45:08.111 --> 45:12.954
and reminds us how different we can be
in seeking the one and only truth

45:13.154 --> 45:16.809
in very many different ways. Good night.

45:18.723 --> 45:21.421
Interviewer: Thank You.
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.
