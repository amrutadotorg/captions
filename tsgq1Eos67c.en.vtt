00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:57.824
- Today

00:05:59.056 --> 00:06:00.646
in this

00:06:00.646 --> 00:06:02.246
blessed place

00:06:02.246 --> 00:06:03.359
of Mahaganesha

00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:05.546
we have all assembled

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.209
to go deep into our own beings,

00:06:11.494 --> 00:06:12.819
To enjoy our own glory.

00:06:14.906 --> 00:06:16.036
One has to remember

00:06:18.196 --> 00:06:20.366
that the very first thing

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:22.826
God created on this earth

00:06:22.826 --> 00:06:24.546
was Shri Ganesha

00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:26.873
because he could emit

00:06:27.956 --> 00:06:28.789
holiness.

00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:39.046
He exists as Chaitanya

00:06:40.488 --> 00:06:44.146
and this Chaitanya exists
in the atoms and molecules,

00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:45.456
As you know very well,

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:50.229
As vibrations symmetric and isometric.

00:06:52.226 --> 00:06:53.426
These vibrations

00:06:57.686 --> 00:06:59.906
later on start expressing themselves

00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:04.096
in the plant kingdom

00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:06.819
as life force.

00:07:08.515 --> 00:07:11.927
And you see how they are

00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:13.529
kept under a bondage.

00:07:15.739 --> 00:07:17.126
A tree that is

00:07:18.206 --> 00:07:21.696
a mango tree will grow
up to a certain point.

00:07:28.533 --> 00:07:31.979
A coconut tree will grow
up to a certain point.

00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:36.186
It's all under control.

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:41.526
And then it is expressed in the animals

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.186
where it binds them.

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:47.229
That's why they're called
pashus, inside their bondage.

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:54.386
But in the human beings, it is expressed as

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:57.279
auspiciousness

00:07:58.531 --> 00:08:01.618
and ultimately as the epitome,

00:08:01.618 --> 00:08:02.618
as holiness.

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:06.042
Holiness

00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:10.023
is to be understood

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:15.923
in its essence as
well as in this context.

00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:25.081
Holiness is an innate
quality of personality.

00:08:27.756 --> 00:08:29.589
Where a person rejects

00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:32.549
all that is unholy,

00:08:35.026 --> 00:08:36.699
All that is inauspicious.

00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:43.906
The ego doesn't play any part.

00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:46.706
Up to the animal stage,

00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:48.666
ego doesn't exist.

00:08:48.666 --> 00:08:50.469
But in the human stage

00:08:52.106 --> 00:08:53.816
you are given freedom to choose

00:08:58.386 --> 00:09:01.406
whether you want holiness

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:02.239
or not.

00:09:03.505 --> 00:09:05.469
But in the ego of man,

00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:09.329
he might say

00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:10.411
"what's wrong?"

00:09:14.712 --> 00:09:16.981
And he may fight

00:09:19.346 --> 00:09:21.678
All the rules and
regulations of the Divine

00:09:21.678 --> 00:09:24.269
And take to unholy behavior.

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:28.656
But then he goes amok.

00:09:32.976 --> 00:09:35.513
Then we can see the results

00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:37.639
in this short time.

00:09:40.076 --> 00:09:40.909
The results

00:09:42.926 --> 00:09:44.189
of this defiance.

00:09:51.016 --> 00:09:52.166
In the West, especially,

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:55.292
they're finding it impossible

00:09:55.292 --> 00:09:56.559
to retreat back.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.986
To begin with

00:10:00.226 --> 00:10:01.199
people laugh at such people.

00:10:03.743 --> 00:10:05.373
They make fun of them.

00:10:08.876 --> 00:10:12.189
but holiness is the power within us.

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:17.796
As you have heard

00:10:17.796 --> 00:10:20.596
that Rajput ladies

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:23.596
used to sacrifice their bodies so that

00:10:27.106 --> 00:10:30.606
nobody tries to destroy their holiness,

00:10:30.606 --> 00:10:31.439
Their chastity,

00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:36.310
because they realise the power that lies

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:37.608
behind this chastity.

00:10:45.626 --> 00:10:47.606
This sense of chastity

00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:55.923
has helped so many women in this country

00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:00.776
to lead a very dynamic

00:11:01.906 --> 00:11:02.789
and holy life.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.757
It is said that without holiness

00:11:12.146 --> 00:11:14.716
you cannot work out

00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:15.899
anything.

00:11:20.236 --> 00:11:23.226
Even, I've heard that

00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:24.059
in India

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.426
people believe

00:11:25.426 --> 00:11:28.626
that if you have to do wrestling,

00:11:28.626 --> 00:11:30.589
the wrestler has to be a holy person.

00:11:33.136 --> 00:11:36.538
If he's an unholy person, ultimately

00:11:36.538 --> 00:11:38.288
he will fail in life.

00:11:39.974 --> 00:11:43.216
Even those who play other games

00:11:43.216 --> 00:11:46.626
have to be holy like Hanumana,

00:11:46.626 --> 00:11:48.436
otherwise, they cannot

00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:51.656
continue with their games

00:11:51.656 --> 00:11:54.442
and they might develop
some sort of problems

00:11:54.442 --> 00:11:55.942
within themselves.

00:11:59.056 --> 00:12:01.516
The warriors who went on the wars

00:12:02.876 --> 00:12:03.709
and fought

00:12:06.066 --> 00:12:08.706
Other people had to lead a very holy life

00:12:10.306 --> 00:12:12.326
otherwise they would suffer.

00:12:12.326 --> 00:12:15.106
As you have seen people
coming back from Vietnam

00:12:15.106 --> 00:12:16.176
have become mad people.

00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:22.736
In every walk of life

00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:25.189
holiness was the most important part,

00:12:26.566 --> 00:12:28.306
Most important subject

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:31.689
that was to be looked after.

00:12:35.044 --> 00:12:38.209
No reaction took place to
people who fought with Shivaji.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:45.159
But when I see the reaction of
war in some other countries,

00:12:46.106 --> 00:12:47.469
I'm quite surprised.

00:12:49.486 --> 00:12:50.319
The reason is

00:12:51.386 --> 00:12:52.956
while fighting the war

00:12:52.956 --> 00:12:55.306
they fell into a trap of their ego

00:12:56.103 --> 00:12:59.481
and did not care for their chastity.

00:13:01.263 --> 00:13:03.836
Chastity is not only meant for women.

00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:05.129
That's a very wrong idea.

00:13:06.906 --> 00:13:09.286
It's very much more for men.

00:13:09.286 --> 00:13:11.796
Those who lead a chaste life

00:13:11.796 --> 00:13:14.666
are the people who are glorious.

00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:19.666
Tejas Punja, as we call it.

00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:26.846
For Sahaja Yogis, the most important thing

00:13:26.846 --> 00:13:30.106
is to lead a very holy life.

00:13:30.106 --> 00:13:32.969
Everything else, is mundane.

00:13:38.326 --> 00:13:39.686
Christ,

00:13:39.686 --> 00:13:42.146
who came on this earth

00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:42.979
As I told you,

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:45.866
was the incarnation of the same

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:47.689
Holiness as Shri Ganesha.

00:13:49.275 --> 00:13:51.975
He had gone to this extent to say

00:13:52.046 --> 00:13:55.369
That thou shall not
have adulterous eyes.

00:13:56.526 --> 00:13:59.676
Even your eyes should be holy

00:14:01.871 --> 00:14:02.744
and innocent.

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:08.156
Innocence gives you that holiness.

00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:09.246
As the children are

00:14:10.686 --> 00:14:11.920
holy people,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.316
because

00:14:13.316 --> 00:14:14.409
they are so innocent.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:22.051
There are so many things to
be learned from children.

00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:23.826
In their simplicity,

00:14:23.826 --> 00:14:25.069
In their innocence,

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:30.419
They do not indulge into
things which are unholy.

00:14:32.176 --> 00:14:35.255
Holiness is not only concerned

00:14:38.472 --> 00:14:40.513
with your married life.

00:14:41.726 --> 00:14:45.839
Also, it's concerned
with your political life,

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:47.489
With your economic life,

00:14:50.286 --> 00:14:51.486
With your national life.

00:14:57.726 --> 00:15:00.096
Chastity is the only keynote

00:15:00.976 --> 00:15:02.086
for improving

00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:04.456
all the problems,

00:15:04.456 --> 00:15:07.083
all the problematic

00:15:09.504 --> 00:15:10.646
questions

00:15:11.432 --> 00:15:13.810
or else solving them completely.

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:20.629
There's only one danger
among chaste people also,

00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:23.776
that they might become extremely

00:15:25.036 --> 00:15:26.556
dry

00:15:26.556 --> 00:15:27.859
or could become

00:15:31.546 --> 00:15:33.716
very hot tempered.

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:35.499
Sometimes also ego-oriented.

00:15:37.056 --> 00:15:39.026
But just the opposite of Shri Ganesha,

00:15:39.026 --> 00:15:40.226
who is on the left side.

00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:43.826
Shri Ganesha's holiness

00:15:43.826 --> 00:15:46.936
is that of a child, eternal childhood.

00:15:46.936 --> 00:15:47.859
It's so sweet.

00:15:49.997 --> 00:15:52.106
The whole movement of his body

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.313
is so delicate

00:15:54.196 --> 00:15:55.029
and so sweet.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.213
Yet,

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.270
so charming.

00:16:10.513 --> 00:16:12.252
He eats

00:16:12.252 --> 00:16:13.524
a Modaka

00:16:13.524 --> 00:16:14.612
which is a

00:16:14.612 --> 00:16:16.562
sweet which is

00:16:16.562 --> 00:16:17.975
very simple to make

00:16:17.975 --> 00:16:18.892
and very tasty.

00:16:22.018 --> 00:16:23.018
To show that

00:16:24.136 --> 00:16:25.315
we should have

00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:26.508
sweet

00:16:26.508 --> 00:16:28.138
temperament

00:16:28.163 --> 00:16:28.996
Sweet nature.

00:16:34.116 --> 00:16:36.796
So the idea that people
who are very chaste

00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:40.586
are very rough, hot tempered

00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:43.376
is absolutely wrong.

00:16:44.646 --> 00:16:46.126
Especially for ladies.

00:16:46.126 --> 00:16:47.339
It's very important

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:49.299
that

00:16:50.226 --> 00:16:51.936
if they have to

00:16:51.936 --> 00:16:53.336
understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:53.336 --> 00:16:55.479
they must know that Shri Ganesha

00:16:56.626 --> 00:16:57.766
works on the left side

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.066
and not on the right side.

00:17:03.075 --> 00:17:05.646
This is a very big mistake

00:17:05.646 --> 00:17:08.419
when we start using
him on the right side.

00:17:09.456 --> 00:17:12.039
To express all our wisdom,

00:17:14.346 --> 00:17:15.889
All our love.

00:17:16.882 --> 00:17:17.882
Through holiness.

00:17:22.296 --> 00:17:24.846
There's no end to what I have to say about

00:17:24.846 --> 00:17:25.819
this great quality.

00:17:26.706 --> 00:17:29.729
Which all should imbibe,
respect and worship.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.409
Only thing,

00:17:34.556 --> 00:17:35.669
when you meditate,

00:17:37.936 --> 00:17:40.716
just believe

00:17:40.716 --> 00:17:43.596
that your auspiciousness

00:17:43.596 --> 00:17:44.456
and holiness

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.516
needs to be imbibed on your nerves

00:17:49.516 --> 00:17:51.139
on your central nervous system,

00:17:52.716 --> 00:17:55.825
because that is the epitome of Chaitanya.

00:17:56.606 --> 00:17:58.656
The Chaitanya that is flowing all around

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:00.586
if it is

00:18:02.186 --> 00:18:04.126
in the form of holiness

00:18:06.346 --> 00:18:09.056
even one glance of yours

00:18:10.183 --> 00:18:13.895
can bring beautiful fruits.

00:18:14.748 --> 00:18:16.998
Can bring peace and solace.

00:18:19.566 --> 00:18:20.399
So this

00:18:21.664 --> 00:18:22.497
innocence

00:18:25.423 --> 00:18:26.506
and holiness

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.130
Is the one which is peace-giving,

00:18:32.046 --> 00:18:34.626
Which reduces frictions, tensions,

00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:39.051
because you enjoy

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:40.119
your

00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:41.879
chastity.

00:18:43.026 --> 00:18:45.896
Because you enjoy

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:46.729
your glory.

00:18:49.229 --> 00:18:50.569
Please aspire

00:18:52.646 --> 00:18:54.519
To be the epitome of holiness.

00:18:56.151 --> 00:18:57.651
May God bless you all

00:18:59.027 --> 00:19:01.246
(places her hands together in prayer)
