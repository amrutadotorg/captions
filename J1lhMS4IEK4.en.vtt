00:00:02.756 --> 00:00:07.812
It’s such a pleasure to come to this great country

00:00:08.538 --> 00:00:11.462
where there are so many seekers.

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:16.555
So many seekers are born in these modern times.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.760
There were never born so many, any time before.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.421
For example at the time of Christ,

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:33.792
He had to gather crowds of people but they had no seeking;

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:41.364
they just listened to Him because they felt it was something new.

00:00:42.322 --> 00:00:49.349
Today, the time has come where many seekers have taken their birth

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:54.525
all over the world and they are seeking.

00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:04.696
This is a fact one has to accept, there’s no hypocrisy about it.

00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:10.751
Some people don’t understand that the seeking is there

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:14.246
and that whatever they’re doing, right or wrong,

00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:19.443
actually they are seeking within themselves.

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.864
Today, in the beginning, I will give you a broadline

00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:30.982
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:36.641
the one that means: A spontaneous happening within us,

00:01:36.818 --> 00:01:41.095
of union with God. It’s easy to talk about it,

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:45.626
any one can talk about it. First, when I went to America,

00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:49.513
people said, you must get a patent on your lectures, Mother.

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:53.986
I just smiled at them. I said, what’s the matter?

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:59.142
They said, they might use your words
and use the same things for their own purpose

00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:04.958
and may be that they all do a lot of harm to you, I said, no,

00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:08.044
it’s nice, let them talk about

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:13.337
because that’s what has to happen, people have to know about it,

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.533
what is there to take a patent for it. We don’t take patent

00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:23.806
for the light of the sun, and the beauty of the stars.

00:02:24.588 --> 00:02:26.388
That’s meant for everyone.

00:02:27.088 --> 00:02:31.833
The main thing is that these lecturing

00:02:32.556 --> 00:02:41.068
and all such ventures are of no use at all unless and until

00:02:41.556 --> 00:02:47.982
the happening takes place. It should happen to you.

00:02:48.295 --> 00:02:54.603
It’s an actualization, it is the Becoming which is important.

00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:58.099
It’s not reading about it;

00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:04.481
It's a living force within us
which has made us a human being from ameba

00:03:04.735 --> 00:03:12.391
and it’s a living force which is
going to make us a higher personality:

00:03:14.345 --> 00:03:20.669
A prophet. As William Blake has very clearly said,

00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:25.102
that men of God will become prophets

00:03:25.806 --> 00:03:30.626
and the day will come when
these prophets will have special capacity

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.309
to transform other people as prophets;

00:03:36.485 --> 00:03:42.364
that time has come today.
William Blake could see hundred years back

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.086
the working of Sahaja Yoga and today you can see the actualization.

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:01.352
Before you today they have placed the diagram of our being.

00:04:06.137 --> 00:04:11.367
It’s a very complicated stuff;

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:18.125
they are trying to make it a simple
diagram for you though it looks still complicated.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.446
For example when you are sitting in this room

00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:25.797
supposing there was no light,

00:04:26.442 --> 00:04:31.975
one has to just tell you that,
just push the button and all the lights will be on.

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:37.102
But behind this happening

00:04:37.415 --> 00:04:40.555
there is a big mistery about electricity,

00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:45.629
and a big mechanism and a great organization that does it.

00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:48.503
It’s not just the pushing of a button.

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:55.176
Now my situation is such that I can push the button, alright

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.187
but people want to know the history and all the headache about it;

00:05:00.665 --> 00:05:03.731
so I have to explain to you what is it about.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.721
Here you see the subtle force, the subtle being within us.

00:05:14.518 --> 00:05:26.100
This is a human being which has evolved to this stage of awareness

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:30.900
and that he has to become that dynamic awareness.

00:05:33.518 --> 00:05:39.251
If you try to make any instrument,
say for example you try to make this microphone;

00:05:40.334 --> 00:05:43.734
people would definitely ask, what is the purpose ?

00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:49.123
Until it is connected to the mains it has no purpose at all.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.998
In the same way you are created to be beautiful human beings

00:05:55.213 --> 00:05:57.830
and you are to be connected to the mains,

00:05:58.084 --> 00:06:01.151
otherwise you do not find your absolute value.

00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:05.580
Now the Kundalini about which many people have talked.

00:06:05.737 --> 00:06:08.939
I mean they have written books after books, and I was shocked

00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:14.496
for they do not know anything about it,
and how could they write such big books;

00:06:14.858 --> 00:06:17.458
from where did they get the knowledge?

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:23.060
This Kundalini is a very simple thing.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:31.752
It is the pure desire within us,

00:06:32.748 --> 00:06:43.400
that one has to become one with the Spirit, is the pure desire.

00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:48.162
So that through the Spirit, we know God.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:57.400
This pure desire, this power of
pure desire exists within us as Kundalini.

00:06:58.455 --> 00:07:04.607
The whole being manifested, but still it is sleeping.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.177
It’s completely there, after

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.773
creating the whole being as a human being -still it is sleeping,

00:07:13.963 --> 00:07:17.439
because that power of desire,

00:07:17.693 --> 00:07:22.537
has not got the chance to manifest itself.

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:30.541
Now for this desire of power, people think that you can excite it

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:37.299
or something. Some people have started enterprises

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:42.494
of Kundalini Yoga, of Kundalini awakening;

00:07:43.022 --> 00:07:46.693
it is not a commercial stuff, it is not !

00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:49.853
It’s a living process.

00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:56.260
You cannot commercialize it. You cannot pay for it.

00:07:56.787 --> 00:08:00.986
We have got brains, we are human beings,

00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:06.533
we must understand that we cannot pay for the Divine Love.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.529
On the contrary, you insult it, if you talk of money.

00:08:12.646 --> 00:08:15.180
God does not understand money, it’s your myth,

00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:18.185
human beings have created it; He does not know what money is.

00:08:23.283 --> 00:08:30.900
You cannot pay for it! You cannot put in any effort for it.

00:08:34.436 --> 00:08:44.529
For becoming a fruit, a flower
does not put in any effort or pay any money.

00:08:44.998 --> 00:08:49.724
How much money did you pay to become a human being from a monkey?

00:08:50.506 --> 00:08:54.431
What effort did you put in to do that ?

00:08:54.588 --> 00:09:02.068
It is spontaneous. Like a seed which sprouts through its primule

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:06.092
and the same primule becomes the root and the shoot

00:09:06.638 --> 00:09:16.556
and a little cell at the tip of the root
works out all the digging by itself, spontaneously.

00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:21.786
Only living things can be spontaneous

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.841
And then the shoot rises by itself, becomes the leaves

00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:33.251
and becomes the flowers and then the fruit:

00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:40.481
The whole map of its being is microscopically placed in that seed.

00:09:40.715 --> 00:09:50.832
In the same way within us is placed the primule,
the germinating force, called as Kundalini.

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.793
And this force which exists within us

00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:59.781
in three and a half coils (there’s a big mathematics about it,

00:10:00.113 --> 00:10:05.796
which I think I cannot discuss it today,
but sometime we’ll discuss it).

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:13.609
Now it is very important to see the position of Kundalini:

00:10:13.883 --> 00:10:16.349
It is placed in the triangular bone,

00:10:16.969 --> 00:10:19.910
this bone is called sacrum;

00:10:20.614 --> 00:10:24.559
the sacrum word comes from the Greek language.

00:10:25.223 --> 00:10:29.520
Greeks must have known this that this is the sacred bone,

00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:32.876
so they called it sacrum, it’s most surprising.

00:10:33.016 --> 00:10:35.816
When they came to Australia, some Greeks,

00:10:35.946 --> 00:10:39.279
they must have felt the vibrations of your river,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.512
so they called it Parramatta.

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:44.207
Have you ever thought of what does that mean?

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:50.680
It means the Holy Ghost.
‘Para’ is beyond, supreme, ‘Mata’ is the Mother.

00:10:53.474 --> 00:10:57.848
Some realized soul must have felt the vibrations of this river

00:10:57.985 --> 00:11:01.832
and they must have named it. In the same way they must have felt

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:05.641
that this bone is something special,

00:11:05.993 --> 00:11:11.520
and this is the last bone that gets burnt up,
when the body is completely

00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:15.290
burnt under electrical pressure.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.024
Now this force resides in this bone,

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:26.066
and you can see with your own eyes; today in the University

00:11:26.242 --> 00:11:33.097
many students saw it: the pulsation of the Kundalini in the bone.

00:11:34.406 --> 00:11:37.374
Now can you do that, any one of you, by jumping

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:43.254
or by shouting or by screaming or by chanting or by paying.

00:11:44.602 --> 00:11:47.473
Whatever you can do cannot be Divine.

00:11:47.805 --> 00:11:53.410
Divine has to be something that is beyond human endeavor.

00:11:55.012 --> 00:12:00.461
You can jump, you can shout, you can do this, you can do that,

00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:07.371
but you cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

00:12:09.637 --> 00:12:15.945
And this miracle you see every day, billions and billions of these,

00:12:16.102 --> 00:12:17.976
we take it for granted.

00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:22.488
We have taken our human awareness also for granted,
it’s a good thing,

00:12:22.606 --> 00:12:26.406
otherwise we start thinking about it, we go into another

00:12:27.183 --> 00:12:30.797
tension mounting upon our heads.

00:12:31.344 --> 00:12:36.422
Now this force lies above the first centre.

00:12:37.848 --> 00:12:42.804
The first centre is the center called as Mooladhara Chakra.

00:12:42.981 --> 00:12:48.468
Now this is a very big confusion,

00:12:48.645 --> 00:12:51.311
one of the biggest in the modern times.

00:12:51.535 --> 00:12:57.238
As it is, modern times are known to be full of confusions only.

00:12:57.688 --> 00:13:01.183
Only in confusions we have to find the truth,

00:13:01.515 --> 00:13:05.982
unless and until there is confusion, there cannot be that seeking.

00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:08.664
And this confusion has reached such a stage,

00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:12.271
that we are confused even about Kundalini.

00:13:12.408 --> 00:13:16.542
And there are people who have worked hard to confuse us also.

00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:23.127
This important point,

00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:27.570
that the first centre within us which is the centre of innocence

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:33.830
is placed below the Kundalini,
is extremely important to understand.

00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:39.920
And that ... Kundalini resides in the
triangular bone which is Mooladhara.

00:13:40.448 --> 00:13:46.189
So the centre of this power lies below the Kundalini.

00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:52.088
This is a very important point which I am going to tell you today.

00:13:53.612 --> 00:13:58.130
The last centre within us, the seventh centre within us,

00:13:58.384 --> 00:14:01.001
manifests the pelvic plexus,

00:14:01.212 --> 00:14:03.551
I don't know if you are doktors here,

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:05.889
but I tell you the pelvic plexus

00:14:06.286 --> 00:14:10.993
that the exclusion within our body.

00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:14.430
All that is excluded

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:19.835
is manifested through this the subtle centre within us,

00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:24.109
which is below the sacrum bone, is a subtle centre.

00:14:24.528 --> 00:14:29.256
It looks after the prostrate gland.

00:14:29.413 --> 00:14:31.889
Now this is the centre of innocence,

00:14:32.085 --> 00:14:36.018
innocence is the first thing God has created on this earth;

00:14:36.772 --> 00:14:42.045
is holiness, is beauty of God, is love.

00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:48.842
And this innocence resides within us below the Kundalini

00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:56.165
and in my next lecture in the same hall
I will be speaking in details about it,

00:14:56.459 --> 00:15:00.658
how it manifests other aspects in our life.

00:15:01.947 --> 00:15:04.347
But why this is an important point,

00:15:04.587 --> 00:15:10.873
that it is placed lower than the Kundalini-because it says

00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:20.126
that our excretion is done by pelvic plexus which is manifested

00:15:20.303 --> 00:15:25.185
by this particular centre called as Mooladhara Chakra,

00:15:25.557 --> 00:15:29.111
has nothing to do with Kundalini.

00:15:30.185 --> 00:15:32.852
It is very important to know this fact,

00:15:33.018 --> 00:15:36.675
that sex has nothing to do with Kundalini.

00:15:36.968 --> 00:15:42.944
If sexual manifestation is going to take you to God,

00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:47.320
animals would be much faster in their evolution than you are.

00:15:47.672 --> 00:15:50.272
We have nothing to learn from animals.

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.312
We are human beings.

00:15:53.664 --> 00:15:57.531
Those who want to learn from animals will become animals.

00:15:57.766 --> 00:16:00.899
Are we to become the frogs and earthworms now,

00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:04.047
or we have to become a superior personality?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.800
A personality who is completely in command,

00:16:10.246 --> 00:16:16.712
who is the master. Or are we to be slaves of our problems ?

00:16:17.533 --> 00:16:26.458
How can we become masters of ourselves
if we give in to our own being,

00:16:27.982 --> 00:16:31.747
to things that destroy us.

00:16:32.255 --> 00:16:35.922
So one has to understand this point very very clearly,

00:16:36.435 --> 00:16:39.302
that sex has nothing to do with Kundalini.

00:16:41.747 --> 00:16:45.946
It cannot 1 Before us is placed Christ.

00:16:46.376 --> 00:16:50.175
I’m surprised that people who have known Christ,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:56.210
how can they accept such an absurd thing, like by doing sex

00:16:56.367 --> 00:16:59.167
in a perverted manner you will reach God.

00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:02.870
Are we now going to become just sex points?

00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:06.549
Have we no self-esteem left in ourselves,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.520
to understand that we are much more
than a sex point, a mere sex point.

00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:17.733
This is the best way of ruining people.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.401
This is the best way of enticing people,

00:17:21.558 --> 00:17:26.479
but I tell you, you are seekers, out and out you are seekers!

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.464
You must not listen until you have found out your spirit.

00:17:30.601 --> 00:17:35.134
You are not going to be satisfied with all these nonsensical ideas.

00:17:36.108 --> 00:17:40.581
You will come back, I know,
one day all of you will have to come back.

00:17:40.777 --> 00:17:43.243
But that time you will be so ruined,

00:17:43.374 --> 00:17:45.774
that I may not be able to help you.

00:17:47.886 --> 00:17:50.753
It’s a very clear-cut thing to understand,

00:17:51.128 --> 00:17:56.238
that sex has nothing to do with Kundalini awakening.

00:17:56.765 --> 00:17:59.636
She is your pure Mother,

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.130
She is the Mother who is individually with you.

00:18:05.163 --> 00:18:08.678
Forget your concepts, and forget your identifications.

00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:12.078
Please try to understand. She is your Mother,

00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:15.984
waiting for ages to give you your real birth.

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.661
She is the Holy Ghost within you.

00:18:18.816 --> 00:18:21.726
She has to give you your realization,

00:18:21.883 --> 00:18:26.042
and She’s just waiting and waiting to do it.

00:18:26.395 --> 00:18:29.871
I have seen some people, who have a Kundalini,

00:18:30.184 --> 00:18:36.648
which just, like a wounded
serpent is bending Her head all sides and just

00:18:36.844 --> 00:18:41.277
breaking Her body;

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:44.946
I have seen people with holes in the Kundalini;

00:18:45.754 --> 00:18:49.543
how much we have harmed ourselves by foolish ideas,

00:18:49.738 --> 00:18:54.034
by listening to those people
who are just trying to make money out of us,

00:18:54.192 --> 00:18:58.800
and befool us. There are some destroying forces
that have come on this earth.

00:18:58.977 --> 00:19:01.789
Not some, but many and they are very speedy.

00:19:01.945 --> 00:19:03.929
It’s very easy to destroy something,

00:19:04.148 --> 00:19:06.449
but to construct is such a difficult thing

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:10.347
and to construct something, living is even more difficult

00:19:10.613 --> 00:19:16.917
Just we are enamored because we think it’s easy.

00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:18.480
There are people

00:19:18.714 --> 00:19:22.781
who think that if you enroll yourself as somebody’s disciple

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.553
you’ll be saved. How can you be saved?

00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:28.601
You have to grow yourself.

00:19:29.144 --> 00:19:30.746
You have to become.

00:19:31.176 --> 00:19:35.242
You must know what powers have you got from any one of them.

00:19:35.589 --> 00:19:41.057
Those who say that you should have sexual freedom,

00:19:41.468 --> 00:19:45.256
O! The animals have all that, what is so special

00:19:45.432 --> 00:19:50.197
about getting a sexual freedom. I can’t understand.

00:19:50.354 --> 00:19:53.986
I mean in India you know how much people are producing children

00:19:54.182 --> 00:19:56.916
without going to any one of these gurus.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.339
On the contrary these gurus make you impotent

00:20:03.633 --> 00:20:07.124
and they teach you about the sex

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.417
so that you feel as if the sexual act is
a very big thing to be achieved;

00:20:12.574 --> 00:20:14.601
it’s such a simple thing to do

00:20:14.972 --> 00:20:19.640
and for people who are impotent it is a great thing,

00:20:19.933 --> 00:20:24.089
no doubt, but for people who are normal and natural

00:20:24.382 --> 00:20:28.049
it’s so simple, just like going to the bathroom.

00:20:29.797 --> 00:20:33.737
Why make such an ado about things which are so simple.

00:20:34.949 --> 00:20:40.398
This has gone too far now. They have also suggested that,

00:20:40.652 --> 00:20:43.952
you can raise the Kundalini by sex.

00:20:44.261 --> 00:20:46.097
It’s like the Mother

00:20:46.194 --> 00:20:49.530
being connected to the child in a very dirty manner.

00:20:49.734 --> 00:20:52.421
People might say the Freud talked about it.

00:20:52.617 --> 00:20:56.288
Freud was another half-baked fellow, I must say.

00:20:56.816 --> 00:21:00.663
Absolutely half-baked without any wisdom about him.

00:21:01.074 --> 00:21:04.116
He must have had some problems like that himself,

00:21:04.254 --> 00:21:07.320
he was an abnormal personality to begin with.

00:21:07.613 --> 00:21:10.346
Apart from that all these, psychologists

00:21:10.523 --> 00:21:14.585
meet only abnormal people. Do they meet ever a normal personality?

00:21:14.781 --> 00:21:17.848
Who will go to a psychologist who is normal ?

00:21:18.062 --> 00:21:20.062
Always mad people go to them.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.230
And these psychologists catch from the mad, and become mad.

00:21:26.744 --> 00:21:31.739
And then they start teaching
you something which is really maddening.

00:21:32.482 --> 00:21:36.749
Now he was so half-baked that he just saw one side of our life.

00:21:37.599 --> 00:21:41.666
He didn’t know that there was another side and another side.

00:21:42.072 --> 00:21:45.329
And for him sex became so important,

00:21:48.318 --> 00:21:55.192
he could see perversions and things
and we are really flabbergasted at that.

00:21:55.427 --> 00:21:58.961
Those who are simple people, say in Indian villages,

00:21:59.177 --> 00:22:02.126
if you tell them like this
they’ll say what’s wrong with the fellow ?

00:22:02.361 --> 00:22:04.294
He must go to lunatic asylum.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.329
Now we have to see what have we achieved

00:22:11.228 --> 00:22:14.059
so far as a human being?

00:22:14.587 --> 00:22:18.521
What are we as a human being and what we have to achieve?

00:22:19.939 --> 00:22:25.539
If you see in this diagram
(of course you should not take me for granted either).

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:29.732
Today as in the T.V. they asked me a question,

00:22:29.901 --> 00:22:33.412
that, do you mind if we doubt,
I said no, on the contrary, I’m very happy,

00:22:33.511 --> 00:22:35.911
it shows that you are so very free,

00:22:36.127 --> 00:22:37.690
You have to ask me questions,

00:22:37.808 --> 00:22:41.010
but when it comes to these fake gurus, you just go headlong.

00:22:41.167 --> 00:22:45.434
You are so mesmerized you do not even think what you are doing!

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.934
And you don’t even see what others have achieved.

00:22:49.077 --> 00:22:51.479
You see some people jumping on the street,

00:22:51.675 --> 00:22:53.569
you also join them.

00:22:54.136 --> 00:22:58.002
You don’t want to find out what power they have achieved,

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.260
what is their situation, are they better off than us or not

00:23:02.475 --> 00:23:05.229
if they have been cured of their troubles or not.

00:23:05.425 --> 00:23:09.958
On the contrary if you find them you’ll find that they’re recluses.

00:23:10.933 --> 00:23:15.622
They’re even afraid sometimes, I’ve seen, of vegetables.

00:23:15.974 --> 00:23:20.680
If you show them a garlic, they’ll be frightened.

00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:23.626
Some of the gurus have this problem also.

00:23:23.748 --> 00:23:26.638
They are told that you should not take any garlic,

00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:29.509
so, if you show them a garlic, they’ll start jumping.

00:23:30.036 --> 00:23:31.247
What is this?

00:23:31.521 --> 00:23:35.329
Are we going to be frightened of garlic ?

00:23:36.774 --> 00:23:40.719
Are we going to be that kind of

00:23:40.877 --> 00:23:44.535
a horrible human beings who are frightened of this and that.

00:23:44.679 --> 00:23:49.577
Now, within us lies on the left hand side, if you see,

00:23:49.773 --> 00:23:53.506
is the power of desire which comes more from the right.

00:23:55.046 --> 00:23:58.835
In Sanskrit it is called as Itcha Shakti.

00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:05.983
This is the psyche about which Mr. Freud has talked,

00:24:06.218 --> 00:24:12.109
part of it. You see he’s a blind man
leading everyone into doom, like him.

00:24:12.793 --> 00:24:17.734
Now this one is our past, is our conditioning,

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:23.300
is the one that is our subconscious mind

00:24:23.769 --> 00:24:27.050
and we have a subconscious mind no doubt.

00:24:27.343 --> 00:24:31.134
But that’s not everything that we have, we have many other things.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:35.684
Now this subconscious mind within us has an area beyond it

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.908
as the collective subconscious

00:24:38.165 --> 00:24:42.099
and that’s a dangerous area when you enter into that area,

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:45.528
you contract diseases like cancer.

00:24:47.851 --> 00:24:52.051
You know that in Sahaja Yoga, we have definitely cured cancer.

00:24:52.306 --> 00:24:57.484
And I was amazed that those people who have got cancer

00:24:57.601 --> 00:25:04.120
and who came to me have got cured,
were all affected more by the left side than the right side.

00:25:06.093 --> 00:25:10.560
And that you can find out yourself once you get your enlightenment

00:25:10.762 --> 00:25:17.617
and you become a realized soul.
On the right band side there is another power,

00:25:18.594 --> 00:25:24.052
which is called as the power of action.

00:25:24.267 --> 00:25:28.201
You desire something, and you have to act is Kriya Shakti.

00:25:30.732 --> 00:25:40.259
This is the future. Beyond the future lies the supraconscious area,

00:25:40.377 --> 00:25:42.349
or the collective supraconscious.

00:25:42.545 --> 00:25:46.450
People have talked about it
without telling you where is it within us.

00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:49.532
They have talked about Christ. Where is Christ within us?

00:25:49.689 --> 00:25:52.560
They have talked about Krishna, where is Krishna within us?

00:25:52.697 --> 00:25:57.364
What is the proof that He exists
at that particular centre within us?

00:25:58.942 --> 00:26:00.777
In the centre lies

00:26:01.052 --> 00:26:04.606
another power by which we have become human beings.

00:26:04.725 --> 00:26:07.533
The evolutionary power, the sustenance power,

00:26:07.651 --> 00:26:14.018
the Religo, the religion,
not the religion that we see but THE religion.

00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:23.608
Carbon has four valencies,
gold has a quality that it is untarnishable,

00:26:23.921 --> 00:26:28.254
in the same way a human being has got ten sustenances within it.

00:26:28.361 --> 00:26:33.435
And this sustenance which sustains it,
which says he’s a human being,

00:26:33.615 --> 00:26:36.150
is the quality of a human being.

00:26:38.884 --> 00:26:43.317
So, we have three powers within us, in Sahaja Yoga language

00:26:43.474 --> 00:26:46.408
we call it differently, to make it simpler.

00:26:50.037 --> 00:26:52.966
These three powers exist within us.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.954
But the central power is a little cut off ,
if you see, there’s a gap.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.560
This central power by which we evolve,

00:27:02.573 --> 00:27:05.373
has not yet been connected with the mains

00:27:07.266 --> 00:27:09.607
You are aware as human beings

00:27:09.763 --> 00:27:13.552
but we are not connected to the mains

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.384
and the cord is the Kundalini.

00:27:16.814 --> 00:27:22.224
In our heart resides the spirit. In our heart it resides.

00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:28.220
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:27:28.454 --> 00:27:31.774
Unless and until you have got your self-realization,

00:27:31.872 --> 00:27:34.806
unless and until you are connected with it,

00:27:35.329 --> 00:27:38.704
every religion, everything that you do

00:27:38.822 --> 00:27:43.079
has no meaning, it’s like telephoning
a person without any connection.

00:27:43.298 --> 00:27:49.797
You spoil it. So you have to get connected.

00:27:50.364 --> 00:27:53.781
As today they asked me another question,
which was interesting, about Hatha Yoga.

00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:58.371
I said nobody’s doing Hatha Yoga, they are doing some exercises

00:27:58.528 --> 00:28:02.551
most indiscriminately. Because attention is on the body,

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:07.381
and that’s why they’re just doing something without understanding

00:28:07.878 --> 00:28:10.478
why certain exercises have to be done.

00:28:11.765 --> 00:28:14.631
Actually the real Hatha Yoga of Patanjali,

00:28:14.889 --> 00:28:16.993
you have to have Ishwara Pranidhan;

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.807
that means first your God must be established!

00:28:19.943 --> 00:28:21.877
First you must be connected.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:26.600
Let the Kundalini rise and then know what chakras are catching,

00:28:26.776 --> 00:28:28.576
what exercises are needed?

00:28:28.719 --> 00:28:32.928
What mantra is needed? We have a great

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.768
organizations in this country,
and everywhere else where they give a mantra,

00:28:38.983 --> 00:28:45.815
Now just think of it ! There are six centres;

00:28:46.386 --> 00:28:50.092
these are the basic centres, there are many more,

00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:53.803
I don’t want to tell you the number, otherwise you’ll be surprised.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:59.780
But six main centres and two on the left and the right are

00:29:00.347 --> 00:29:06.985
sun and the moon. And at the bottom is the seventh one.

00:29:07.474 --> 00:29:10.074
So you can see there are nine centres,

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.760
basically we have to know
and there are nine deities on these nine centres.

00:29:17.474 --> 00:29:20.007
How can you give somebody one mantra?

00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:24.388
Supposing you have to pass through six gates

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.467
and you have only one pass,

00:29:26.947 --> 00:29:29.622
of the fifth one and you are at the first gate,

00:29:29.759 --> 00:29:31.559
how will you pass through?

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.110
These people have no idea

00:29:35.345 --> 00:29:38.802
And they have given such horrible mantras I was shocked,

00:29:38.958 --> 00:29:43.392
If you tell Indians they’ll be surprised. One of them means

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:48.577
‘tinga’ means (thumb). Can you
imagine this could be a mantra, like this.

00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:51.443
it’s such a ridiculous thing to say.

00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:54.802
Horrible things like ‘inga binga dinga’,

00:29:55.116 --> 00:29:58.201
these are no mantras, this is nonsense!

00:29:59.393 --> 00:30:01.639
And it’s a mafia going on.

00:30:01.795 --> 00:30:05.955
They come and tell you in your ears,
you see you are not to tell it to anybody,

00:30:06.151 --> 00:30:10.525
I was most surprised that at the end it was the ‘fallopian tubes’.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.532
I said what? Fallopian tubes how can that be a mantra.

00:30:16.466 --> 00:30:22.618
And we take it We take it, we pay for it ; people had paid £3,000

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:29.138
and they are given to eat for one week for £3,000,

00:30:30.427 --> 00:30:37.575
the boiled soup of the boiled potatoes.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.556
Just that water, for 5 days!

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.668
and one day the rind and one day the potatoes,

00:30:47.001 --> 00:30:51.571
to make them weak so that they could become completely

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.903
out of their minds and then they can be mesmerized very well.

00:30:59.169 --> 00:31:01.836
Be careful about these horrible people!

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.013
They know that you are seekers, and ardently you are seeking.

00:31:07.214 --> 00:31:09.214
They know that you have money

00:31:09.365 --> 00:31:12.724
and they want to play upon your ego by saying that you can pay,

00:31:12.842 --> 00:31:15.830
you must pay, how much money have you got?

00:31:16.045 --> 00:31:18.979
These are all parasites, of the worst type!

00:31:19.776 --> 00:31:22.109
These are all parasites, remember,

00:31:22.335 --> 00:31:24.619
and the day will come when you recognize them,

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.916
when you’ll be falling on the streets
with epilepsy and all kinds of diseases

00:31:29.034 --> 00:31:32.061
and then you’ll be coming to me. There are already so many people

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.827
who are coming to me in that condition.

00:31:36.545 --> 00:31:38.279
I have to warn you again and again,

00:31:38.478 --> 00:31:40.369
be careful and understand

00:31:40.522 --> 00:31:43.722
that these people give no knowledge whatsoever,

00:31:43.846 --> 00:31:47.615
they are just mesmerizing you, just mesmerizing you,

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.560
not only because they want to make money

00:31:50.698 --> 00:31:55.131
but they are bent upon destroying the Kingdom of God.

00:31:55.424 --> 00:31:57.958
They are bent upon destroying you all

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.347
because they are satanic people

00:32:01.069 --> 00:32:04.335
and they want to establish the kingdom of Satan.

00:32:06.284 --> 00:32:11.687
For us, it is easy to take to these things, it’s very easy to fall,

00:32:11.824 --> 00:32:17.136
as I told you. But to rise is difficult.
It’s not so difficult also,

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.620
spontaneity is so simple, if you know the job you can do it.

00:32:22.758 --> 00:32:25.585
If there’s a beautiful garden

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.195
you can easily find out that there must be
a gardener behind it who has done the job.

00:32:30.317 --> 00:32:32.916
If somebody knows the job he can do it.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:41.243
Now this central path is the path through which one has to rise.

00:32:41.966 --> 00:32:49.727
The Kundalini rises through a very thin line of Brahmanadi.
It's called  Brahmanadi.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.673
In the beginning only a hair like thing rises,

00:32:55.084 --> 00:32:59.357
it pierces through; in some people,
of course, in a big way it rises also.

00:33:00.275 --> 00:33:06.505
And then it pierces this
fontanel bone area which is a real baptism, real.

00:33:06.954 --> 00:33:10.391
Today only, people felt the cool breeze coming out of their heads.

00:33:10.541 --> 00:33:13.741
Can you do that by jumping, or by paying money?

00:33:14.005 --> 00:33:15.958
They felt the cool breeze in the hand.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.576
It’s written in the Bible, even in the Bible very clearly,

00:33:20.733 --> 00:33:25.849
that it’s the cool breeze,
cool breeze is the sign of the Holy Ghost.

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:29.342
You start feeling the cool breeze in your hands

00:33:29.502 --> 00:33:32.056
and you start feeling the cool breeze on your head.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:36.310
This is the actualization. Of course, you people don’t read

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.347
other books which are very good, like Adi Shankaracharya,

00:33:40.494 --> 00:33:43.204
People don’t even like the mention of his name

00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:49.630
who has really and clearly said
that it is the cool breeze; the chaitanya

00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:52.904
is to be felt like cool breeze in the hands.

00:33:54.826 --> 00:34:00.724
They do not want that you should know the truth.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:05.196
And this is the truth that when you get your realization,

00:34:05.351 --> 00:34:08.886
you have to feel the cool breeze in your hands yourself.

00:34:09.043 --> 00:34:12.709
You have to judge yourself. I’m not going to tell you,

00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:15.976
it is you who has to see, it is you who has to feel,

00:34:16.118 --> 00:34:20.917
and then you have to grow and you have to know all and everything,

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:25.195
all the secrets of Divine Science.

00:34:25.762 --> 00:34:28.921
You become the master then, you are the guru.

00:34:29.137 --> 00:34:34.470
You are the Spirit, and you should get it,
it’s your own which is given to you.

00:34:35.484 --> 00:34:37.706
I have nothing to do about it,

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.909
I’m just a catalyst. I should say,

00:34:40.164 --> 00:34:44.011
you can do it yourself,
once you get realization you can give realization.

00:34:44.187 --> 00:34:47.820
Actually Warren came to me, and Terence,

00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:54.538
and they had been really lynched by all these gurus,
and they were so unhappy.

00:34:54.793 --> 00:34:58.109
Just before leaving for India he telephoned to me

00:34:58.226 --> 00:35:00.488
from Australia telephone to me:

00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:04.238
"Mother, we have got your telephone, can we come and see you?"

00:35:04.453 --> 00:35:08.124
and I knew they were seekers. So first, I caught hold of them.

00:35:08.281 --> 00:35:11.441
You see, I don’t work much in the cities,

00:35:11.578 --> 00:35:15.660
I work in the villages because
villagers are easier to get realization;

00:35:15.796 --> 00:35:18.335
the other day we were in a village called Kadus,

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:20.920
where six thousand people got realization,

00:35:21.076 --> 00:35:24.142
it was announced in the paper. So,

00:35:24.338 --> 00:35:27.364
in the cities these gurus work out because they want money

00:35:27.482 --> 00:35:30.373
and the purse, you see, it’s there in the cities.

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.787
I work in the villages. Poor things had to go to the

00:35:33.944 --> 00:35:36.185
villages where they don’t even have proper bathrooms,

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.291
you have to go to the rivers to have your bath and things

00:35:39.448 --> 00:35:42.981
and it was very spartan for comfortable Australians.

00:35:43.724 --> 00:35:45.658
But they managed it somehow.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.573
And they got their realization and when they got it,

00:35:49.721 --> 00:35:52.881
when they came back here they have given realization

00:35:53.017 --> 00:35:56.215
in the first shot to 300 people.

00:35:56.626 --> 00:36:01.020
And now they know such a lot about Kundalini,

00:36:01.548 --> 00:36:05.141
about awakening, about enlightenment.

00:36:05.689 --> 00:36:08.089
It’s all logical after realization,

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.747
before that it is blind rationality,

00:36:11.294 --> 00:36:13.627
which doesn’t understand anything,

00:36:14.419 --> 00:36:20.548
This Kundalini is there, your own, Sahaja.

00:36:20.763 --> 00:36:25.470
‘Saha’ means with, ‘ja’ means born;
it’s born with you, it’s within you!

00:36:25.665 --> 00:36:32.579
It has to only rise with authority, with a person who knows

00:36:33.185 --> 00:36:36.452
how to do it, One should not feel hurt about it,

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:40.334
because I’m doing it, you better do it, I’ll be very happy.

00:36:40.725 --> 00:36:45.139
You see, I’m a very happily married woman, you know,
I don’t need anything.

00:36:45.296 --> 00:36:49.944
My husband has permitted me to
go about doing this because he knows nobody can do it.

00:36:50.725 --> 00:36:55.259
I’ll be very happy if you can do it, really I would like to retire.

00:36:56.429 --> 00:37:00.705
Moreover why should you feel bad if I do it?

00:37:01.038 --> 00:37:05.160
After all there are so many things
I can’t do. I can’t drive, I can’t type,

00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:08.109
I don’t know even how to open your tins,

00:37:08.598 --> 00:37:10.668
I’m so hopelessly bad.

00:37:11.527 --> 00:37:16.527
So what is there to feel bad about it
if I know how to raise the Kundalini

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.465
and when it is your right to know yourself

00:37:20.621 --> 00:37:26.051
and to get it within yourself
so that you achieve your real baptism,

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.560
your real force, and once you have achieved it,

00:37:32.809 --> 00:37:37.542
first thing that happens is
that you become a different personality.

00:37:38.239 --> 00:37:39.753
You become something so different.

00:37:39.929 --> 00:37:44.362
The other day a gentleman, old man,

00:37:44.811 --> 00:37:47.292
who met me in Singapore long time back,

00:37:47.429 --> 00:37:50.496
he told me that : ‘Mother, after realization,

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.382
actually I’ve not even touched it fully,

00:37:53.523 --> 00:37:56.117
but one thing happened to me I just gave up gambling,

00:37:56.254 --> 00:37:58.831
smoking and drinking, just like that.

00:37:59.066 --> 00:38:03.324
What happened to me? I said,
when you have found out the real, you give up.

00:38:03.461 --> 00:38:07.972
When you have found the real diamond,
of course, you give up the artificial ones.

00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:10.576
Because you are bored stiff, because

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.867
you find life so boring, human beings so boring, life so boring,

00:38:15.101 --> 00:38:20.061
so uninteresting, full of tensions,
full of cruelty, full of problems,

00:38:20.218 --> 00:38:21.897
you want to take to these things.

00:38:22.053 --> 00:38:24.807
But once you’ve found out your absolute,

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.006
your sense of security is absolutely established.

00:38:28.358 --> 00:38:32.491
And the joy and happiness, the bliss that is promised to you,

00:38:33.084 --> 00:38:38.064
starts pouring down into you. You feel so relaxed.

00:38:38.573 --> 00:38:41.639
Apart from that, so many things happen to you

00:38:42.147 --> 00:38:45.721
that it is hard to tell you in this one lecture.

00:38:45.955 --> 00:38:49.089
I’m going to have many other lectures for you.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:53.447
Now first thing that happens is that physically you get fit,

00:38:53.584 --> 00:38:57.900
It’s not that I’m going to go to
the hospital to find out who are physically unfit

00:38:58.037 --> 00:39:01.884
and start an enterprise. Alright, pay so much money

00:39:02.158 --> 00:39:04.400
to cure this disease and all that. No,

00:39:04.674 --> 00:39:08.752
I do not know how many people I’ve cured,
really I do not know, believe me.

00:39:08.908 --> 00:39:11.603
And I do not know how many of my disciples have cured.

00:39:11.759 --> 00:39:17.159
It’s like the sun shining, it does not
know how many leaves have become green.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.076
You do not keep notes of people whom you love,

00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:26.066
and whom you feed… Do you write down how many morsels

00:39:26.225 --> 00:39:28.115
you have fed the person, do you?

00:39:28.319 --> 00:39:32.685
This is love. Why do you need the proof ?

00:39:32.822 --> 00:39:35.927
Why do you need, you are not paying me anything?

00:39:36.084 --> 00:39:38.884
Do you want to have any proof of the sun?

00:39:39.286 --> 00:39:44.620
You are not giving me anything!
I’m not selling anything! There’s no shop on!

00:39:44.854 --> 00:39:49.619
You have to get this gift. You have to get it.

00:39:49.971 --> 00:39:54.904
So why do you want to judge me?
If you don’t get it, better try for it.

00:39:55.439 --> 00:39:59.619
What are you going to gain by knowing about me,
it’s not easy to know about me.

00:39:59.893 --> 00:40:03.159
It’s very very difficult. I’m such a camouflage.

00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:09.892
It’s a very difficult thing to know.
Better thing is, you know yourself, then you’ll learn.

00:40:10.068 --> 00:40:12.675
Unless and until you know yourself, you won’t know me,

00:40:12.793 --> 00:40:15.819
so no use asking me questions which are rather embarrassing,

00:40:15.937 --> 00:40:20.337
I won’t be able to tell you; because I’ve become very clever now.

00:40:20.507 --> 00:40:23.107
Krishna, just told one person, Arjuna.

00:40:31.648 --> 00:40:34.271
He said, give up everything and follow me.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:39.032
He said that after Yoga you’ll get the Kshema, means, well-being.

00:40:39.174 --> 00:40:42.492
Not before you get a well-being, after that

00:40:42.593 --> 00:40:45.730
because when the Kundalini rises as I will tell you later on.

00:40:45.997 --> 00:40:47.882
If the centers are enlighten

00:40:48.007 --> 00:40:50.740
as a result of that you get the well-being,

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:55.803
physically, mentally, emotionally,
materially, socially, in every way.

00:40:56.005 --> 00:40:59.633
And spiritually (unclear)

00:40:59.907 --> 00:41:03.344
He said after Yoga it will happen! not before that.

00:41:03.832 --> 00:41:07.832
And that’s what is going to happen to you, when you get it.

00:41:07.973 --> 00:41:10.903
If you don’t get it today, don’t get disappointed.

00:41:11.036 --> 00:41:13.283
I work for days in and days out

00:41:13.395 --> 00:41:16.464
and some people have been really very difficult

00:41:16.619 --> 00:41:18.377
in that great England,

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.812
the Jerusalem, according to William Blake,

00:41:23.418 --> 00:41:25.484
I have to work very very hard.

00:41:25.742 --> 00:41:30.097
I’ve worked on only six people for four years, can you believe it?

00:41:30.273 --> 00:41:33.139
Very difficult nuts to be cracked, you see.

00:41:34.042 --> 00:41:37.909
But once they were cracked it has blown up like anything.

00:41:38.535 --> 00:41:42.135
And now we have thousands of people who are realized.

00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:45.069
Of course. I do not keep any records of them,

00:41:45.206 --> 00:41:47.539
there is no organization, nothing,

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.413
You know them through your vibrations

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.487
by which you know that they are realized or not.

00:41:53.741 --> 00:41:55.772
Because you become collectively conscious,

00:41:55.929 --> 00:41:59.385
you become; again and again I say, it’s the becoming.

00:41:59.542 --> 00:42:03.799
You start feeling others and you start feeling yourself.

00:42:04.268 --> 00:42:07.334
it is important, vital,

00:42:07.628 --> 00:42:10.777
absolutely the thing for you to do.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.430
You have to get it, if not today then tomorrow.

00:42:14.723 --> 00:42:17.323
Why not do it today, it’s a good idea.

00:42:17.457 --> 00:42:20.719
But after getting it one has to know that,

00:42:20.851 --> 00:42:23.518
as Christ has described, some seed fell...

00:42:27.976 --> 00:42:31.960
but after getting it one has to know

00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:35.872
that as Christ has described some seed fell on the rock,

00:42:36.659 --> 00:42:41.271
in the same way it happens, you have to look after it,

00:42:41.436 --> 00:42:45.323
you have to make it grow, you have to master it,

00:42:45.499 --> 00:42:48.299
and you have to become the guru yourself.

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:49.987
And as I told you this morning,

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.080
you better go and ask ail these gurus to pay back the money.

00:42:56.807 --> 00:43:02.603
This is best way we can understand that it is beyond rationality.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.373
I’m talking about the unlimited; our rationality is limited,

00:43:06.568 --> 00:43:09.829
our brains are limited. But many ,things can be understood.

00:43:09.948 --> 00:43:14.127
So many people reached the conclusion
that it is the Kundalini awakening,

00:43:14.245 --> 00:43:17.310
is the one which is going to give us self-realization.

00:43:17.467 --> 00:43:20.279
Through their limited brain only, they reached it.

00:43:20.436 --> 00:43:22.838
They also reached so many conclusions,

00:43:22.995 --> 00:43:28.599
that like persons like Jung, the disciple of Mr. Freud the great,

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:32.364
was such a sensible man that he said you must get your realization,

00:43:32.482 --> 00:43:34.572
you must get your self-realization,

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.010
and he prepared the ground for Sahaja Yoga, for he said,

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.510
when you get your self-realization,

00:43:40.627 --> 00:43:44.561
you will become collectively conscious. He talked about it.

00:43:45.061 --> 00:43:46.794
So, one has to understand

00:43:47.893 --> 00:43:51.760
that this is not only what I’m saying, this has been said

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.507
by all the great saints, by all the incarnations,
by all the great prophets.

00:43:58.016 --> 00:44:00.949
Mohammad said, you have to become the Peer.

00:44:01.707 --> 00:44:05.174
But you know what they’re doing about religion now.

00:44:05.379 --> 00:44:08.112
I do not want to fall into controversies

00:44:08.328 --> 00:44:13.125
but you can yourself judge,
what have they done out, of these incarnations.

00:44:13.258 --> 00:44:17.645
You give anything to human beings
they know how to make a mess out of it.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.696
You give them the best thing,

00:44:19.783 --> 00:44:22.654
the highest, they know how to spoil it.

00:44:23.173 --> 00:44:28.539
Like, I would say that Hindus were told,

00:44:29.223 --> 00:44:32.504
that Atma, the spirit resides in everybody.

00:44:34.711 --> 00:44:40.433
They had no business to start the different caste system,

00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:46.686
which depends on the birth. Actually Jati (caste) means a person

00:44:46.804 --> 00:44:50.319
born with certain aptitudes. For example you are Brahmins,

00:44:50.417 --> 00:44:51.608
because you are Seekers,

00:44:51.725 --> 00:44:54.088
you are seeking the Brahma, so you are Brahmins.

00:44:54.206 --> 00:44:59.323
Those who are seeking the power say, we seek in elections

00:44:59.753 --> 00:45:04.303
are Kshatryas. Like that, these are the

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:09.034
aptitudes of personalities which determine a person’s birth.

00:45:09.285 --> 00:45:12.820
Actually the one who has written Gita himself, was Vyasa,

00:45:12.918 --> 00:45:14.652
was an illegitimate child

00:45:15.399 --> 00:45:20.164
of a fisherwoman and how could he say that you are born

00:45:21.434 --> 00:45:22.834
in a Brahmin family.

00:45:24.618 --> 00:45:30.691
It’s a capacity, a category.
You are in the category of those Seekers.

00:45:30.887 --> 00:45:33.974
You are the ones who are going to get realization,

00:45:34.092 --> 00:45:38.625
that’s why you are the Brahmins, and this category can be anywhere.

00:45:38.955 --> 00:45:42.155
It can be in Islamic world, it can be in China,

00:45:42.529 --> 00:45:47.263
and it can be in Russia,
it can be in England, and it is in Australia.

00:45:48.584 --> 00:45:52.784
I have, through my husband’s job, been to all these countries.

00:45:53.076 --> 00:45:56.743
I was amazed. I’ve given realization even to Russians,

00:45:56.945 --> 00:45:59.278
they’re very good for realization.

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:02.491
But they’ll take time to understand it to that extent.

00:46:02.629 --> 00:46:04.894
Because you are really free people;

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:11.124
you are the people who are free, democratic, can have more

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:17.036
open mind, to understand Sahaja Yoga,
to achieve it to much greater heights.

00:46:17.804 --> 00:46:22.005
But still I would like to say that
freedom doesn’t mean abandonment.

00:46:22.103 --> 00:46:27.118
It doesn’t mean that. Say in a plane if all the parts of the plane

00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:31.688
want to have freedom, what will happen to the plane, ultimately?

00:46:31.825 --> 00:46:34.692
We are part and parcel of one whole being.

00:46:35.165 --> 00:46:40.184
One primordial Being, the macrocosm, and we are cells.

00:46:40.322 --> 00:46:44.559
We have to relate ourselves to the whole and so we have to find out

00:46:44.658 --> 00:46:50.458
our relationship, the coordination between different cells,

00:46:50.743 --> 00:46:53.680
the love, the love between.

00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:58.519
Last of all I would like to say it is the Divine Love of God,

00:46:59.085 --> 00:47:03.316
is the grace of God which has made you a human being

00:47:03.462 --> 00:47:07.581
and it is His grace which is going to
make you a supreme human being.

00:47:07.797 --> 00:47:11.597
Because He wants to have that power to flow through you,

00:47:11.742 --> 00:47:15.824
to make you a hollow personality; like the flute of Shri Krishna,

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:21.077
so that you might feel His power and you maneuver it.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.401
And you enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:47:23.524 --> 00:47:26.407
because He is the father who loves you,

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.108
loves more than any father can love.

00:47:29.417 --> 00:47:34.863
He’s the Ocean of Love. He forgives all your so-called guilts;

00:47:35.097 --> 00:47:39.296
what guilts can we have, what sins can we commit,

00:47:39.433 --> 00:47:43.867
only you are like little birds who sometimes feel guilty

00:47:43.984 --> 00:47:47.245
for bringing a little straw from outside in the house.

00:47:47.441 --> 00:47:49.433
He is a loving Father,

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.703
He is a Father who is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

00:47:53.594 --> 00:47:56.421
He cleanses us completely,

00:47:56.578 --> 00:48:03.257
and He grants His beauty to us, and you become His own children,

00:48:03.473 --> 00:48:06.656
who have been granted all His powers,

00:48:06.969 --> 00:48:09.800
in their own beauty and its glory,

00:48:09.976 --> 00:48:11.577
May God bless you!

00:48:14.369 --> 00:48:16.710
May I have some water please.

00:48:17.659 --> 00:48:23.969
Now, there is a way sometimes people want to ask some questions

00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:31.194
and they very anxious to ask some questions
sometimes you see they ask also useless questions.

00:48:31.852 --> 00:48:33.928
Vasting the time.

00:48:34.318 --> 00:48:39.099
Now, if you're hungry actually you should ask for realization

00:48:39.314 --> 00:48:44.060
and see that it works. Sometimes
these questions can divert your attention.

00:48:44.197 --> 00:48:47.615
Is better to have your realization first,

00:48:47.752 --> 00:48:49.352
and then ask questions.

00:48:49.607 --> 00:48:52.207
But the first lecture of introduction,

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.820
I think is better that you ask Me a few questions,

00:48:56.385 --> 00:49:00.779
it's better without any fear I am you Mother (unclear)

00:49:01.443 --> 00:49:03.377
you have to ask questions.

00:49:03.865 --> 00:49:06.932
There is somebody putting a guilty hand there.

00:49:07.432 --> 00:49:10.986
You have to ask loudly. I can't here you.

00:49:11.255 --> 00:49:14.256
Are there any dangers... (unclear)

00:49:14.625 --> 00:49:16.187
Not at all.

00:49:16.756 --> 00:49:19.367
That's a very good thing. Not at all.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.727
Not at all, she is your Mother.

00:49:22.006 --> 00:49:25.068
You see, the mother takes all
the weapon upon herself

00:49:25.283 --> 00:49:27.561
when she give guard. This is the Earthly mother,

00:49:27.779 --> 00:49:30.946
the heavenly mother. No dangers of any kind.

00:49:31.065 --> 00:49:33.215
But these people are not authorized.

00:49:33.334 --> 00:49:35.965
It's like somebody from the village comes and he doesn't

00:49:36.045 --> 00:49:40.012
know the electricity and puts his hands to plugs and said "I got a shok".

00:49:40.192 --> 00:49:41.592
Naturally you will.

00:49:43.684 --> 00:49:45.484
The one who knows the job,

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.574
knows also how to raise the Kundalini.

00:49:47.694 --> 00:49:51.694
She is your Mother, there is no danger at all. Not at all.

00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:57.277
Attendee: Do the gurus....unclear.

00:49:57.555 --> 00:50:00.531
Yes, of course, I mean that's what I'm going to make you.

00:50:00.689 --> 00:50:04.023
Your'e going to awaken others Kundalini no doubt!

00:50:04.142 --> 00:50:06.629
Yes, yes, houndred times.

00:50:07.025 --> 00:50:10.359
Attendee: How

00:50:10.796 --> 00:50:12.663
Because you have to become.

00:50:13.474 --> 00:50:16.669
First you have to become,
it is very simple which I'll tell you later,

00:50:16.788 --> 00:50:18.388
all right, how to do it.

00:50:19.414 --> 00:50:30.831
A: unclear

00:50:31.397 --> 00:50:33.502
It's for Me to judge.

00:50:33.899 --> 00:50:35.366
It's for Me to judge.

00:50:36.042 --> 00:50:38.879
I don't find any will persons much.

00:50:39.097 --> 00:50:42.657
There are people who are misguided, who have lost their way.

00:50:42.781 --> 00:50:46.202
Very few evil people in this world, very few.

00:50:46.332 --> 00:50:48.532
Actually seekers are not at all,

00:50:48.802 --> 00:50:52.234
poor things they are play in to the hands of evil forces.

00:50:52.453 --> 00:50:53.653
I've been ruoled,

00:50:54.497 --> 00:50:57.897
sometimes I feel to see the way they are exploited.

00:50:58.314 --> 00:51:00.239
But they are not bad.

00:51:00.438 --> 00:51:03.394
They are not bad people at all. They are seekers,

00:51:03.513 --> 00:51:06.370
absolutely beatiful things.

00:51:07.737 --> 00:51:13.572
Do not think that you are evil, never think that way. It hurts me.

00:51:17.303 --> 00:51:23.455
Yogi: Are we going to raise Kundalini tonight?
SM: Just now!

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:39.651
Yogi: He is asking wheter
the Chaitanya is the last Avatar of Krishna.

00:51:41.774 --> 00:51:52.329
Chaitanya means, the All Pervading Divine Power of God,

00:51:52.607 --> 00:51:57.805
which is Love Divine love. It means Chaitanya - is all Pranava.

00:51:58.057 --> 00:52:07.171
It has many names it has.
In Sanskrit it is called as the Bred, Ruh.

00:52:07.745 --> 00:52:13.895
And in the Bible is called Breath the Holy Ghost.

00:52:14.493 --> 00:52:18.847
It's bible, is the power by which is the whole universe is ruled.

00:52:19.086 --> 00:52:24.859
By which everything that is continious takes place.

00:52:25.879 --> 00:52:30.053
These three powers are the three aspects of the same.

00:52:30.078 --> 00:52:33.803
But when you get your realization, you get the integrated force.

00:52:33.828 --> 00:52:38.577
Actually when we consider,

00:52:38.903 --> 00:52:42.255
analysing a person we are really dividing him.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:46.291
For example you have mayt a doktor
for one eye and another for the other.

00:52:46.316 --> 00:52:49.358
But Chaitanya integrates you completely.

00:52:49.383 --> 00:52:55.349
And the whole power is the divitly power
of our prana, which is the right-sided

00:52:55.374 --> 00:53:02.110
of our manasa which is the left-sided
and of our dharma which is the centre.

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:03.688
All these are integrated.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:27.711
A: not clear

00:53:28.058 --> 00:53:32.016
Complain is correct. Is correct complained.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.707
What's your age now?

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.694
A: 30
SM: Only thirty?

00:53:37.508 --> 00:53:41.308
About then years back, when you were hardly twenty years

00:53:41.456 --> 00:53:45.123
I have proclaimed it. But nowbody wanted to belive Me.

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:49.089
Is the human beings who are to be blaimed for that.

00:53:49.254 --> 00:53:54.321
Who chrossified Christ?
Why did not recognize? I'm to ask many questions.

00:53:56.419 --> 00:53:58.219
Why did not recognize Him?

00:53:58.562 --> 00:54:00.895
Why did you not recognize Krishna?

00:54:01.062 --> 00:54:03.196
Why did you not recognize Rama?

00:54:03.324 --> 00:54:06.697
Why did you not recognize any saintly personality?

00:54:06.835 --> 00:54:10.702
But this fake horrible things. Why did you recognize them?

00:54:12.686 --> 00:54:16.908
I talked about all of them, very openly whitout any fear.

00:54:17.146 --> 00:54:20.015
Then years back I went to America

00:54:20.155 --> 00:54:26.603
and everything. But see, where is americans gone now?
Gone mad... They're gone mad.
