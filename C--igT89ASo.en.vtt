00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:55.592
Today is a great day because we are celebrating

00:06:55.841 --> 00:07:00.759
the birth of Jesus Christ.

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:12.675
He was such a great spiritual personality,

00:07:14.883 --> 00:07:20.634
who had to suffer on the cross.

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:27.342
This is what many people don't understand,

00:07:28.592 --> 00:07:34.300
that why a man of his calibre, of his standing,

00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:37.759
of his spirituality,

00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:43.717
should have to go through so many ordeals in life.

00:07:49.008 --> 00:07:53.217
It is very easy to understand

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.883
that he was born in a circumstances

00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:01.509
which was against him,

00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:06.592
which were against divine force.

00:08:08.217 --> 00:08:18.091
So to overcome that people tried to destroy Jesus Christ.

00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:26.717
And he did not feel the pain,

00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:31.800
he didn't feel the absurdity of those people.

00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:38.008
On the contrary he went through all that ordeal

00:08:39.091 --> 00:08:43.217
with such courage and such dignity.

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:51.509
So for us, what is there to see is

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.300
that if you are divine

00:08:57.592 --> 00:09:01.091
and if you have powers of divinity,

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:08.509
then you should have courage,

00:09:09.634 --> 00:09:13.634
and with that courage you can face all kinds of ordeals.

00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:21.133
On the whole, whenever you are on this earth

00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:25.634
there are problems of different types.

00:09:26.717 --> 00:09:29.717
You may belong to royal families,

00:09:30.008 --> 00:09:33.217
or may be a poor person,

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:39.717
there are always problems facing you.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.300
But Christ has shown by his life

00:09:47.717 --> 00:09:50.300
that though he had to suffer so much,

00:09:51.634 --> 00:09:55.008
he was so patient and courageous.

00:09:57.008 --> 00:10:00.925
His life has given us an example,

00:10:01.217 --> 00:10:06.342
what we should be, how we should behave

00:10:07.008 --> 00:10:13.217
when we are facing problems because of ignorance of people.

00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:23.425
But today is a happy day because it is his birth date

00:10:23.717 --> 00:10:26.925
and we are all celebrating

00:10:27.217 --> 00:10:31.425
because he has shown us a new path of spirituality

00:10:32.342 --> 00:10:34.717
in which one has to suffer,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:41.217
because of the ignorance of many who are there,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.050
he suffered so much.

00:10:44.342 --> 00:10:46.634
But today it's not so bad,

00:10:46.925 --> 00:10:53.550
people understand spirituality and divinity.

00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:57.425
And you are so many together now.

00:11:01.925 --> 00:11:09.050
In these sufferings Christ never cried or wept.

00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:16.925
He went through it in a very resolute manner.

00:11:18.925 --> 00:11:21.925
So what we have to learn from his life is

00:11:22.258 --> 00:11:24.717
that we should not be afraid.

00:11:25.342 --> 00:11:29.841
Whatever might be happening to us,

00:11:30.133 --> 00:11:32.342
we should not be afraid.

00:11:32.634 --> 00:11:34.925
But times have changed

00:11:35.258 --> 00:11:38.425
and people don't torture anyone

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:41.425
because of your spirituality.

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:45.759
It's not there, it's finished.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:51.759
Christ wiped out all that from human minds,

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.050
and people respect you for being spiritual.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:01.759
This is the message of Christ's life,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.634
and we all should be very happy

00:12:07.966 --> 00:12:14.550
that he has shown us this path of ignorance.

00:12:19.133 --> 00:12:23.342
The message of Sahaja Yoga is the same:

00:12:25.258 --> 00:12:29.467
that you take your realisation,

00:12:30.759 --> 00:12:33.050
you take to spiritual life,

00:12:33.342 --> 00:12:36.050
and everything will work out

00:12:36.342 --> 00:12:39.966
because all the divine forces are with you.

00:12:41.258 --> 00:12:43.966
They are working out everything for you

00:12:44.258 --> 00:12:49.258
and you are so many who can say that you have witnessed it.

00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:55.258
So this kind of life that Christ had,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.175
you don't have to go through, he has done for us.

00:13:00.467 --> 00:13:07.550
Your life will be very, very safe and peaceful and joyous.

00:13:08.258 --> 00:13:11.759
That is without my telling you,

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.342
you must have experience.

00:13:16.675 --> 00:13:19.759
These days there are also very cruel people,

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.966
very absurd and extremely aggressive,

00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:30.467
but still, no-one can harm you.

00:13:30.883 --> 00:13:33.467
Life has become very different.

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:39.550
And we thank Christ that he has gone through all that

00:13:39.883 --> 00:13:44.258
to save us from those ordeals.

00:13:52.394 --> 00:13:57.893
Today is the birthday of Christ and

00:13:58.258 --> 00:14:03.175
we are all celebrating His birthday with great joy.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:11.175
And we also know  that Jesus Christ took a lot of efforts,

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:15.675
and we do not have such efforts as much as He has done.

00:14:15.883 --> 00:14:18.175
But how much Jesus Christ has suffered...We know this.

00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:20.966
But we do not have this kind of efforts,

00:14:21.258 --> 00:14:26.091
because the whole human community has changed.

00:14:26.383 --> 00:14:31.383
And in this changed human community,

00:14:31.675 --> 00:14:37.883
spiritual life is very, very important.

00:14:38.383 --> 00:14:45.091
From this spiritual life  many obstacles have been removed,

00:14:45.383 --> 00:14:49.966
from this we can solve our physical problems,

00:14:54.258 --> 00:14:57.966
we can solve our mental problems,

00:14:58.258 --> 00:15:02.966
we can solve household problems,

00:15:03.258 --> 00:15:05.383
we can solve the problems of the whole world.

00:15:05.675 --> 00:15:10.759
In this way the life of the whole mankind

00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:13.966
can be changed into a spiritual life.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.383
This is very important for us to know,

00:15:18.675 --> 00:15:21.966
that on the  one hand there was Jesus Christ

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.675
who had gained a lot in spirituality,

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:30.883
and on the other hand we have

00:15:31.175 --> 00:15:36.091
gained a small part of spirituality

00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:39.592
- and because of us the world is becoming silent.

00:15:39.883 --> 00:15:46.966
Many problems are getting solved

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.008
and mankind has understood

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.008
that it's very important to take to spiritual life.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.675
This kind of changes are because of you people,

00:15:59.008 --> 00:16:01.509
I alone cannot do anything.

00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:06.300
I am in the same situation as Jesus.

00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:12.175
To what extent can I act?

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:16.175
Now there are many people.

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:21.300
Now we can see

00:16:22.175 --> 00:16:30.675
how the whole world has changed.

00:16:31.008 --> 00:16:35.383
Because of you, problems are getting solved,

00:16:36.383 --> 00:16:42.883
many changes have come,

00:16:43.217 --> 00:16:49.883
Many changes are coming,

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:56.383
not only for one person,

00:16:57.717 --> 00:17:02.383
for thousands, for the whole world,

00:17:03.091 --> 00:17:05.717
in the whole community changes are coming.

00:17:06.008 --> 00:17:12.091
These things you are all doing, which is very important.

00:17:17.883 --> 00:17:23.091
Now to speak in Marathi, the life of Christ was very sad.

00:17:23.383 --> 00:17:35.091
But he did all this kind of things with love,

00:17:35.425 --> 00:17:40.425
because He was a very great soul

00:17:40.717 --> 00:17:51.091
- such a kind of person does not feel any kind of sadness.

00:17:51.425 --> 00:17:55.592
In this way we have taken to spiritual life,

00:17:55.925 --> 00:18:00.425
and now we have to give the spiritual life to everyone.

00:18:00.717 --> 00:18:05.592
People are watching our lives and  they are stunned  by seeing

00:18:05.925 --> 00:18:07.592
how happy we are.

00:18:08.217 --> 00:18:11.592
And when they understand that

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.091
these things are happening in Sahaja Yoga

00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:16.509
they also enter Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.509
This is a very good thing

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.509
and also you have got this blessing.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.800
And you have to keep this blessing very carefully.

00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:28.133
You have to work on it, and the most important

00:18:28.425 --> 00:18:34.217
thing is that you have to give this thing to everyone.

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:38.800
You all are getting this kind of blessing

00:18:39.133 --> 00:18:43.634
- now let also other people have this kind of joy,

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:49.008
and so all the Sahaja Yogis have to try

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.634
to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone.

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:59.133
In the whole world Sahaja yoga has spread but it is very little.

00:18:59.425 --> 00:19:01.133
It should be spread much more.

00:19:01.425 --> 00:19:07.342
Jesus Christ had only twelve devotees,

00:19:07.634 --> 00:19:13.008
and these twelve devotees had spread Christianity

00:19:13.342 --> 00:19:18.133
- but there are many mistakes made.

00:19:18.425 --> 00:19:21.509
In this way you have to bear in mind that

00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:27.509
when we spread Sahaja Yoga we should not make any mistake.

00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:34.925
We should spread it in a very simple way. It is not so difficult.

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:36.717
In this thing,

00:19:37.217 --> 00:19:43.925
Parameshwara has given you the Shakti

00:19:44.217 --> 00:19:47.925
and the brains, use it. I have full faith in you,

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:50.925
that you can make many Sahaja Yogis

00:19:51.217 --> 00:19:54.634
and you should try to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone

00:19:54.925 --> 00:19:59.841
and only think day and night who to give Sahaja Yoga to.

00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:04.342
I am blessing you for this,

00:20:04.634 --> 00:20:06.550
so this is a very big responsibility on you.

00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:09.342
Since you took to Sahaja Yoga, you had this responsibility,

00:20:09.634 --> 00:20:11.925
that from today you have to bear in mind

00:20:12.258 --> 00:20:15.550
that you have to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:17.550
and should not keep this thing just within us.

00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:21.425
May God bless you
