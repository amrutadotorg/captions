00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:39.481
With today’s vibrations, you can see, when
you are prepared for a puja, how much you get.

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:46.371
Today you can feel it.

00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:54.350
So the Divine is very anxious to act, only
thing you have to prepare yourself.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.361
And all these preparations are going to help
you tremendously.

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:10.651
As we are now Sahaja Yogis we have to know
that we have become something different from

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:12.391
what we were.

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:18.551
We are Yogis, we are higher people than others.

00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:28.631
And as such we have to understand one thing
that we are not like other human beings who

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:32.931
say something and do something, who can live
with hypocrisy.

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:42.191
That’s why all the problems have arisen
out of all the religions.

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:48.270
A person who says he’s a Christian he’s
absolutely anti-Christ; who says who is Islamic,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:59.810
he’s absolutely anti-Mohammed; who says
who is a Hindu is absolutely anti Shri Krishna.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:08.611
This is the main reason why all the religions
have failed so far because human beings talk

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:13.751
big of ideals.

00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:19.230
They all say that we have this ideal, that
ideal, but they are not those ideals, they

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.230
cannot live with those ideals.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.901
The ideals are not in their lives, they’re
outside.

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:34.751
But they go about saying that these are our
ideals, they become fanatics but they are

00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.311
not the ideals.

00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:46.401
By Sahaja Yoga now you have the method, you
have the possibility, that you can become

00:03:46.401 --> 00:03:47.461
the ideals.

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:56.321
The ideal has to first to be understood through
your brains, in the West specially.

00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:03.391
What are the ideals we have become or we have
to become, what we can achieve, this idea

00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:05.021
you must have.

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:19.801
And secondly you must have a capacity to deepen
your

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:25.931
meditative power so that these ideals go and
settle in your heart as a part and parcel

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:31.511
of your being, that you can’t live without
these ideals.

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:35.592
We can take an example say of Christ.

00:04:35.592 --> 00:04:43.181
For Christ He and His ideals were the same,
there’s no difference between them.

00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:47.931
He did not talk of one thing, did another
thing and executed the third.

00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:55.271
This will be the difference between the Sahaja
Yogis and non Sahaja Yogis, that whatever

00:04:55.271 --> 00:05:02.441
are your ideals have to be expressed in your
life every moment because you are that.

00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:08.481
If you are gold, then gold is gold all the
time.

00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:16.241
It is not gold sometimes, then sometimes iron
and sometimes mud, it is gold all the time.

00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:25.241
Only human beings are like that, that sometimes
they can be snakes, lions and could be foxes

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.491
also.

00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:37.351
But as Sahaja Yogis you become pure human
beings and this is what we have to know.

00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:43.291
It is not difficult to strive for it, it’s
not difficult, because now you have the power

00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:48.991
to deepen your roots to your heart.

00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:57.741
So the brain must be used to understand clearly
what are the ideals of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:05.991
What are the things that a Sahaja Yogi should
do, how he should behave in life, what methods

00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:12.231
he should follow.

00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:23.180
And then he has to bring it to his heart through
meditative processes, through surrendering.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.551
How I give you second birth you know very
well.

00:06:26.551 --> 00:06:31.391
I conceive you in My heart, otherwise I cannot
do it.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:38.941
Because My heart is so pure, it cleanses you;
by compassion My love cleanses you and then

00:06:38.941 --> 00:06:50.661
I can take you out of My Sahastrara, otherwise
how will I do that?

00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:59.081
And when that is happened you have become
a new personality.

00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:06.881
So you are very different from all others
because a Spirit has given birth to your Spirit.

00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:14.211
You have been cleansed by the Spirit.

00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:21.641
So you cannot live like that, like all other
human beings are living.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:30.211
All the clashes, all the problems of human
beings are because they are not what they

00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:41.591
talk, ideals are out, out of their life.

00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:47.711
That is how a Sahaja Yogi will show himself
off compared to anybody else.

00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:52.851
Take an example say of Abraham Lincoln, all
right?

00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:58.781
Abraham Lincoln believed that everybody must
have freedom and the government should be

00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:01.861
for the public, for the people.

00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:07.391
Whatever He talked He practised it.

00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:15.781
Whatever He believed in He worked it out and
gave His life for it, that’s why He’s

00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:17.221
a great man.

00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:22.001
Think of Mahatma Gandhi, they were not like
Christ – incarnations.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:30.341
Think of any great man, think of Shivaji Maharaj,
any one of the saints – they were human

00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:31.341
beings.

00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:38.051
But once they knew this is the principle on
which we have to live, they become one with

00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.501
the principles, they do not compromise.

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:52.631
So what Sahaja Yogi has to be that we should
understand.

00:08:52.631 --> 00:09:00.831
A Sahaja Yogi is a person who has got Realization
through the Kundalini, and Kundalini is the

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:08.951
motherhood in you, is the caring, nourishing
power within you.

00:09:08.951 --> 00:09:13.641
But mother will never compromise with the
son; if he wants to kill somebody she’ll

00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:14.641
say: “No.

00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.041
” I mean a real mother.

00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:20.451
She will even shoot that son who tries to
do wrong things.

00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:32.170
In the same way if you become the mother of
yourself, then you have to look after yourself,

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:39.391
in the same manner that you nourish yourself
and all others also, you have to nourish them,

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:46.601
care for them, and do not compromise with
wrong doings, unrighteousness things, absurd

00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:47.601
things.

00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:57.061
Now when I tell you this it is not necessary
for you to feel guilty.

00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:02.580
We have to look upward.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:13.681
Those who are standing even on a lower staircase,
if they are looking upward they are all right,

00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:24.371
but those who are standing at a higher steps,
and looking downward, will go down.

00:10:24.371 --> 00:10:26.880
So look forward.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.951
What we have to do in our day-to-day life
in simple relationships even husband, wife,

00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:39.371
children, parents – are you becoming silent
within yourself?

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:48.061
Are you nourishing it, with your silence,
with your compassion, or you are supporting

00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:54.101
something that is absolutely anti-God?

00:10:54.101 --> 00:11:01.181
If you become the ideals, the power of ideals
itself, will make you so dynamic that you

00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:07.901
don’t need to consult anybody, you become
the ideal.

00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:12.831
They are like torches.

00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:18.401
Your ideals itself will be enlightened.

00:11:18.401 --> 00:11:22.671
So the first attitude should be: “How do
we deepen ourselves?”

00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:24.651
That should be first attitude.

00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:32.061
Now say a husband, wife are quarrelling morning
till evening they cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:33.631
Absurdities.

00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:39.751
If they are quarrelling they are not Sahaja
Yogis, take it for granted.

00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:44.471
Now what you have to do if two persons are
quarrelling, the one who is a Sahaja Yogi

00:11:44.471 --> 00:11:48.661
will leave that wife: “I have nothing to
do with wife, I have no wife nothing.

00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:51.211
” Keep out, detach completely from within.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.031
Just don’t talk to that wife.

00:11:53.031 --> 00:11:57.971
Don’t discuss, don’t bother about it,
just detach.

00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:13.070
If the son is like that just detach, up to
a point but no quarrelling, no argument nothing.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:21.331
Complete silence, a silent protest, must be
developed.

00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:24.211
But in that silence you should not be a cowardly
person.

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:32.291
So many people are cowards, and that cowardliness,
they think is their silent process.

00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:47.451
A person who is really powerful will not deter,
will not be aggressive but will not also take

00:12:47.451 --> 00:12:50.041
aggression.

00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:56.161
So in your meditations you have to sit down.

00:12:56.161 --> 00:13:00.070
Now what do you say in meditation?

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.761
Try to see all the chakras.

00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:07.371
What chakras are catching, face it yourself.

00:13:07.371 --> 00:13:11.061
These might be from your past life.

00:13:11.061 --> 00:13:14.951
Some chakras are weak.

00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:20.801
Try to make them all right, try to strengthen
them.

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:26.681
Because ideals have to be worked out the instrument
has to be all right.

00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:36.791
If the instrument is a crazy one how will
you do?

00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:42.541
So first of all you must develop your instrument
properly, it should be balanced, powerful,

00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:44.931
not cowardly.

00:13:44.931 --> 00:13:49.671
People should feel your power.

00:13:49.671 --> 00:13:57.201
Of course the power is of love, but love doesn’t
mean that you compromise with all the nonsensical

00:13:57.201 --> 00:13:58.201
things.

00:13:58.201 --> 00:14:03.510
There should be no compromise at all.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:12.611
It’s a very self-certifying state.

00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:18.951
We cannot say when it is so, we just cannot
say.

00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:24.961
Itself the state will certify that I’m all
right now, I have reached that state.

00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:34.161
We cannot say after five hours, three minutes,
two seconds you’ll become that.

00:14:34.161 --> 00:14:43.411
You just mature and you see that maturity
within you.

00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:49.581
Once you understand that unless and until
you become your ideals you are not a Sahaja

00:14:49.581 --> 00:14:50.781
Yogi.

00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:54.380
Everybody can call themselves Sahaja Yogis,
there’s not inauguration, we don’t have

00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:07.531
any sort of a – inauguration of a university
where people can come and get their degrees

00:15:07.531 --> 00:15:11.441
and diplomas: “All right you are certified
twice born.

00:15:11.441 --> 00:15:18.281
” There are some who are several times twice
born.

00:15:18.281 --> 00:15:22.601
They are twice born today, tomorrow they are
not, then again they come twice born and again

00:15:22.601 --> 00:15:23.601
twice born.

00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:30.701
Some of them can be one hundred and eight
times twice born in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:33.731
And even then they are not certified.

00:15:33.731 --> 00:15:36.611
So you have to give yourself a certificate.

00:15:36.611 --> 00:15:42.831
There’s no university to do that.

00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:47.500
You have to understand yourself, what are
your problems, why you are behaving like this?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.951
You treat yourself as a child.

00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:54.190
When it is needed you have to rebuke yourself.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.531
When you have to glorify, you should glorify
yourself.

00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:00.451
So now you separate.

00:16:00.451 --> 00:16:05.871
You become the mother, the Spirit is the mother,
and you, whatever you are which has to grow,

00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:08.241
is the child.

00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:19.671
Mother is the ideal, she is the inspiration,
she is the power, and the child is the recipient.

00:16:19.671 --> 00:16:24.921
If the child is an obstinate fellow then you
can’t do anything about it.

00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:27.461
Also find out – you might be one of them.

00:16:27.461 --> 00:16:28.791
I know who are they like that.

00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:34.871
There are many and you can find them out in
no time.

00:16:34.871 --> 00:16:44.581
Obstinate fellows, if they live with ten people
suddenly we hear reports of their existence.

00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:51.581
They are quite eloquent even if they are not
talking a word people can tell you: “I had

00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:55.931
a fight with such and such.

00:16:55.931 --> 00:17:01.631
That person said such and such a thing to
me, that person was so cruel to me, that person

00:17:01.631 --> 00:17:03.361
demanded this.

00:17:03.361 --> 00:17:05.951
” You know which person it is, where.

00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:10.361
You see as a diamond can be made out thorns
can be made out, also anytime you go near

00:17:10.361 --> 00:17:15.791
the thorn, anyone without exception, it will
bite everyone.

00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:18.781
It is not going to spare, it’s a thorn.

00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:22.201
So a thorn has to be a thorn.

00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:31.841
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to be
a flower and a strong flower and an eternal

00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:36.351
flower, that always grows, does not fade out.

00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:44.781
Always growing, never fades, such a flower
you have to be, then you will be surprised

00:17:44.781 --> 00:18:03.581
that you do not get into a trip of ego, neither
you go into a complete collapse of super-ego.

00:18:03.581 --> 00:18:10.144
So much you know that any one of you can be
called as a scholar I can tell you.

00:18:10.144 --> 00:18:16.561
I mean so many times people have asked Me:
“Are they all scholars that You have – Your

00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:17.561
Disciples?”

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:26.870
You know so much, much more than any Saint
ever knew I can assure you.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.921
But you know only in the brain, outside.

00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:31.491
It’s all bla bla bla.

00:18:31.491 --> 00:18:39.011
It comes to the brain, you use it to show
off to others, and finished.

00:18:39.011 --> 00:18:45.420
It doesn’t even settle down there, then
how will it go to the heart?

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:51.690
So everybody is talking big, they can impress
people.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:58.341
I mean if some journalists come here they’ll
be so impressed by the Sahaja Yogis, so many

00:18:58.341 --> 00:19:05.101
wise men in England sitting down here.

00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:14.981
But you laugh at yourself; you have known
all this because I’ve been speaking too

00:19:14.981 --> 00:19:15.981
much.

00:19:15.981 --> 00:19:20.150
Also the Spirit is shining.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:31.721
Let your Spirit shine in such a way that people
know this is a man who is completely integrated:

00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:41.461
the Spirit, the talk, the behavior, the life
itself is completely integrated and this is

00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:42.461
what is Sahastrara.

00:19:42.461 --> 00:19:50.881
So if there is no integration you have not
achieved your Sahastrara.

00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:58.341
There will be no need to pull your ears.

00:19:58.341 --> 00:20:09.621
A day should come when you all will raise
your heads with great pride and glory because

00:20:09.621 --> 00:20:15.461
your ideals will shine like ornaments.

00:20:15.461 --> 00:20:21.961
I want to see those days when all those who
claim to be Sahaja Yogis become that.

00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:26.121
That’s the most important thing, all other
things are useless.

00:20:26.121 --> 00:20:32.981
Getting an ashram, getting this, doing this,
doing that – forget it.

00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:45.131
What you have to manage is this child which
has to grow, who is still naughty sometimes,

00:20:45.131 --> 00:20:46.131
tries to misbehave.

00:20:46.131 --> 00:20:47.361
Now put it right.

00:20:47.361 --> 00:20:49.571
You give it a name.

00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:55.441
You call yourself a Sahaja Yogi and that child
as Mr.

00:20:55.441 --> 00:20:56.441
X, Mr.

00:20:56.441 --> 00:21:02.141
Y whatever your name has been and always try
to tell: “Now will you behave yourself.

00:21:02.141 --> 00:21:07.541
” Get up in the morning, have your bath,
sit down for meditation.

00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:11.871
“I feel lazy,” the child says, “I can’t.

00:21:11.871 --> 00:21:17.071
” Then you accept the child, then the child
will become the mother and you will be losing

00:21:17.071 --> 00:21:18.491
your powers – excuses.

00:21:18.491 --> 00:21:28.811
The child knows, very intelligent, it’s
a very clever child, extremely intelligent,

00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:31.121
knows how to deceive you.

00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:38.650
But the child also knows innately what it
needs.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:45.351
If it comes to know that the mother in you
has developed that personality, then it accepts

00:21:45.351 --> 00:21:46.351
mother’s personality.

00:21:46.351 --> 00:21:52.801
But if the child knows the mother herself
is weak then he starts taking advantage of

00:21:52.801 --> 00:21:54.671
the mother.

00:21:54.671 --> 00:22:07.301
So you have to not fight yourself but to tame
and this is very easy.

00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:11.681
You’ll start enjoying it, looking at yourself:
“Oh Mr.

00:22:11.681 --> 00:22:13.150
so and so.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.721
” Then you won’t be angry.

00:22:14.721 --> 00:22:21.431
“I know how to handle you, you’re hiding
behind there, all right, giving excuses.

00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:35.341
” And the child grows big, so big that mother
sees that and is amazed.

00:22:35.341 --> 00:22:44.371
Like in Shri Krishna’s childhood, the Mother
was Yeshoda and the child was Shri Krishna.

00:22:44.371 --> 00:22:45.991
It’s very symbolic.

00:22:45.991 --> 00:22:55.681
And He used to play very naughty tricks and
She said: “You went and ate that mud from

00:22:55.681 --> 00:22:56.681
there.

00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:57.681
I know you have eaten.

00:22:57.681 --> 00:23:02.631
” He said: “How can I eat, how can I,
I can’t even go out of the house.

00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:04.301
I’m sitting down here.

00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:05.611
Where is the mud?

00:23:05.611 --> 00:23:07.571
How can I eat?”

00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:15.651
“You did eat, I know you have eaten, so
better show me your mouth.

00:23:15.651 --> 00:23:24.271
” He says: “Really?” and then the mouth
opens and the complete Vishwa Swarup, complete

00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:32.091
vision of the whole Vishwa She sees and the
Mother falls at His Feet.

00:23:32.091 --> 00:23:35.811
That’s what it should be.

00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:44.371
This mother has to fall at the feet of the
child that has grown.

00:23:44.371 --> 00:23:49.861
Very symbolic.

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:56.900
That is how you have to grow, into that Vishwa
Swarup.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:04.660
Into that Collective Being, into that Virata.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:11.341
Arjuna and Shri Krishna is another very good
symbolic thing.

00:24:11.341 --> 00:24:18.171
Arjuna was a friend who used to take liberties
with Shri Krishna.

00:24:18.171 --> 00:24:28.051
Shri Krishna tried to tell him about Gita,
all these things.

00:24:28.051 --> 00:24:33.641
But still Shri Krishna could not convince
him of that.

00:24:33.641 --> 00:24:38.371
All these were just outside “bla bla bla’s”;
as Mother’s talks are.

00:24:38.371 --> 00:24:44.030
Mother’s talks are very entertaining you
know very humorous, nice to hear them, instead

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.631
of listening to any music better to hear Mother’s
talks.

00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:52.841
And then the people think if they are listening
to Mother they have become Mother already.

00:24:52.841 --> 00:25:04.111
That’s it happened to Arjuna also but still
he found out that there’s something lacking

00:25:04.111 --> 00:25:07.191
in him, that he has not become the ideal.

00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:13.271
Still his attention is not there as it should
have been.

00:25:13.271 --> 00:25:20.100
So he asked Shri Krishna: “I think I’ll
see your great image.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.111
” Krishna said: “All right are you prepared?”

00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:26.711
He said “Yes, I am prepared.

00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:32.721
” And then He became the Virata, the vision
of the Virata and when he saw it, he said:

00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:35.581
“Stop it, it is too much for me.

00:25:35.581 --> 00:25:36.581
”

00:25:36.581 --> 00:25:43.071
That’s what should happen to your friend
who is this child.

00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:48.181
That it should become that Virata and when
you see that, should be amazed at yourself:

00:25:48.181 --> 00:25:50.861
“Oh God, I have grown like this.

00:25:50.861 --> 00:25:56.221
” Just like Yeshoda falling at the feet
of the little child, you have to fall at the

00:25:56.221 --> 00:26:00.311
feet of the child that is within you.

00:26:00.311 --> 00:26:04.281
I am sure this will happen now.

00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:08.301
So remember that no argument, no explanation.

00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:10.321
Mother is forgiving.

00:26:10.321 --> 00:26:14.871
She’ll forgive you everything, you know
that.

00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:23.821
Anything you do I’ll forgive you, even if
you murder Me I’ll forgive you, but you

00:26:23.821 --> 00:26:27.270
won’t be able to forgive yourself.

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:33.481
So allow that child to grow, grow fully.

00:26:33.481 --> 00:26:41.181
Shri Mataji : Who-why all the children’
are crying like this?

00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:45.201
Shri Mataji : Why is it crying?

00:26:45.201 --> 00:26:46.921
Which child is that?

00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:48.211
Sahaja Yogi : Aarti.

00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:49.501
Shri Mataji : Hum.

00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:51.221
Aarti has a problem.

00:26:51.221 --> 00:26:57.601
Take Aarti out, you must clear her, She has
had problems for so many days.

00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:00.441
You must clear that child.

00:27:00.441 --> 00:27:05.801
Take her out for a while.

00:27:05.801 --> 00:27:16.741
Still screaming, better take her out.

00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:22.861
You must look after them and find out what’s
wrong with your children if they are crying.

00:27:22.861 --> 00:27:25.631
I know what are the children still not all
right.

00:27:25.631 --> 00:27:27.831
Just don’t pamper their ego.

00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:28.951
Work it out.

00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:30.030
Clear them out.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.030
It’s important.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.540
Don’t want to be bhootish.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.311
All their lives they’ll be bhootish like
this.

00:27:35.311 --> 00:27:37.911
I’ve seen many children who are like this.

00:27:37.911 --> 00:27:41.631
They see Me, they cry, weep, shout.

00:27:41.631 --> 00:27:45.791
It’s not a sign of a healthy child.

00:27:45.791 --> 00:27:49.951
Rajesh’s son would not even look at Me,
used to scream and shout.

00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:53.780
Now look at him how nice he’s become.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:59.401
So any child who is like that you don’t
say that, don’t avoid the topic.

00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:01.211
Look after that child, put him right.

00:28:01.211 --> 00:28:04.540
You have to see that the child is all right.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:11.551
As you have to put your child all right also
put the child which is really your son and

00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:15.421
do not live with that kind of a misunderstanding.

00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:21.161
If a child cries like that there’s something
wrong with the child.

00:28:21.161 --> 00:28:26.881
They are singled out.

00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:33.851
If you find your attention is going here and
there, if you are not attentive in the program

00:28:33.851 --> 00:28:36.111
something wrong with you also.

00:28:36.111 --> 00:28:42.091
If you go off to sleep something very seriously
wrong with you.

00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:46.201
At that time if you are thinking of other
things then something wrong with you.

00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:51.001
You get headaches, something wrong with you.

00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:59.231
Judge yourself, clear out, you must clear
out, that’s very important.

00:28:59.231 --> 00:29:05.621
If you are still getting into tempers, irritation,
anger, there’s no balance that has come

00:29:05.621 --> 00:29:08.771
in you, something wrong with you.

00:29:08.771 --> 00:29:14.261
If you know how to control your anger, then
it’s all right.

00:29:14.261 --> 00:29:19.501
You’ll find out everywhere how negativity
works in small things.

00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:25.231
Everybody’s improving but it’s rather
slow.

00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:30.351
It can be very fast if you meditate, that’s
very important.

00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:34.021
You have to know how to make your chakras
all right.

00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:36.371
Your mantras are to be siddhis.

00:29:36.371 --> 00:29:42.461
Mantras are to be such that they should not
be mechanical, just saying something mechanically.

00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:45.881
You should say it from your heart.

00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:50.160
Again, if you do not say mantras through your
heart, mantra is not siddha – means you

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.191
may go on saying hundred times, it will have
no effect.

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:57.801
Siddha mantra is that, that you say that,
it has an effect, it works.

00:29:57.801 --> 00:30:04.301
If it does not work then your mantra has no
meaning.

00:30:04.301 --> 00:30:16.790
So the development has to be within and without
and you have to certify yourself.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.131
Nobody else going to certify you.

00:30:19.131 --> 00:30:22.780
If you want to give yourself a false certificate
go ahead.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:25.741
If you want to cheat yourself go ahead.

00:30:25.741 --> 00:30:28.331
It’s not going to help anyone.

00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:34.751
But if you want to really have the joy and
the bliss of the grace of Heavenly Father,

00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:37.471
then come out of it.

00:30:37.471 --> 00:30:44.481
Many misidentifications that are there have
to be given up to enjoy that beauty.

00:30:44.481 --> 00:30:50.400
It’s such a great day today to meet you
all.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:56.721
Today is a day we celebrate in India where
relationship between brothers and sisters

00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:58.520
has to be established.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.871
They’re very pure.

00:30:59.871 --> 00:31:06.301
Brothers and sisters relationship is without
any lust or greed.

00:31:06.301 --> 00:31:15.101
It’s pure relationship where the sister
prays for the protection of the brother and

00:31:15.101 --> 00:31:29.451
brother prays for the self-sufficiency of
the kshema – well-being of the sister.

00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:38.871
So this time you have to think of your other
Sahaja Yoginis and Sahaja Yogis who are like

00:31:38.871 --> 00:31:41.390
your brothers and sisters.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.371
You have to think like that.

00:31:44.371 --> 00:31:46.021
Purify your hearts.

00:31:46.021 --> 00:31:50.701
It’s something funny in these countries
you know that there’s no such relationship

00:31:50.701 --> 00:31:52.101
exists.

00:31:52.101 --> 00:32:00.351
Purify your mind today on that point, that
everybody else is my brother or sister.

00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:03.931
If you are married it’s all right.

00:32:03.931 --> 00:32:09.400
But look at everyone, try to look at everyone
as a brother, and a sister.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.851
Both relationships don’t exist.

00:32:10.851 --> 00:32:16.520
This is a funny country where there is no
relationship which is pure.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.831
It’s such a filth I tell you.

00:32:19.831 --> 00:32:32.001
If you read them you can’t believe it, such
perversion.

00:32:32.001 --> 00:32:37.241
Specially innocent people like children are
attacked.

00:32:37.241 --> 00:32:41.040
Think of them as virgins.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.260
Be careful.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.071
And the young girls should know that they
are virgins.

00:32:48.071 --> 00:32:57.071
If they go about with boys and they are Sahaja
Yogis, they’re not.

00:32:57.071 --> 00:33:05.071
Sahaja Yoginis have to be chaste women, powerful,
chastity is their power and men too.

00:33:05.071 --> 00:33:13.040
After Sahaja Yoga men should become conscious
of their chastity, that is their power too.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:20.061
You see this was nomadic times when the men
used to go for hunting and women used to cook

00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:21.061
in the house.

00:33:21.061 --> 00:33:29.471
Men were supposed to have five women – they
were nomadic people, then they became sophisticated.

00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:35.821
Then the monogamy started which reached a
certain point.

00:33:35.821 --> 00:33:39.030
Then again this kind of an abandoned life
started.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.030
This is nomadic life.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.211
Now women also have become nomadic.

00:33:42.211 --> 00:33:47.411
Men and women are all nomadic and primitive.

00:33:47.411 --> 00:33:52.481
After sophistication they have become primitive,
this is the problem is.

00:33:52.481 --> 00:34:02.691
But now you have to become higher beings where
there are pure relationships.

00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:08.861
Any relationships, supposing there was something
in between Me and this instrument, we cannot

00:34:08.861 --> 00:34:10.251
use it.

00:34:10.251 --> 00:34:14.790
Any connection can be cut off if there is
something in between.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:22.481
To have the best connection is to have pure
relationships and it should be discretionary.

00:34:22.481 --> 00:34:28.071
Mother is a mother, father is a father, sister
is a sister, brother is a brother, all these

00:34:28.071 --> 00:34:32.760
are different, various types of relationships
should be understood.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.701
Women must understand they are women and men
must understand they are men.

00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:41.611
Also relationship to yourself is very important.

00:34:41.611 --> 00:34:48.390
Women should not try to be men – we cannot,
and men should not try to be women.

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:49.540
Is wrong.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.301
Because basically they are different people.

00:34:53.301 --> 00:34:56.251
They are born differently.

00:34:56.251 --> 00:34:57.801
What is the difference?

00:34:57.801 --> 00:35:01.280
A man is more meticulous, he knows more about
machines, details about it.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.241
A woman will see the pattern.

00:35:03.241 --> 00:35:10.481
Woman will listen to the tune more, man will
be seeing to the instruments.

00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:13.601
That’s the nature God has created you.

00:35:13.601 --> 00:35:18.901
After all somebody has to see this and somebody
has to see that, both are beautiful.

00:35:18.901 --> 00:35:25.790
Nobody is higher or lower, but enjoy yourself
as being a woman, enjoy yourself as being

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.811
a man.

00:35:26.811 --> 00:35:31.111
But man does not mean that you aggress women
thinking stupidly that you are higher than

00:35:31.111 --> 00:35:35.120
woman in evolution.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:41.090
Or women dominating men thinking that by dominating
them they can put them right.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:43.140
They have never put them right by that.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.450
They have gone absolutely cabbages, men have
become cabbages.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.290
Wherever women dominate, men become cabbages.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.130
They have not put them right.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:36:03.220
So both the qualities must be nourished and
developed and the relationship between man

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:11.490
and woman should be of pure love.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:16.200
Once you start purifying yourself these things
will automatically work out and you’ll respect

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200
each other.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.550
Actually you are all yogis.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:24.980
I have to respect you and you have to respect
each other.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.050
On the contrary I find there is no respect.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:31.050
You are all great saints.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.480
Yes, you are.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.340
Respect, respect each other.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:40.940
You’re not to talk harshly to anyone, to
trouble anyone.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.540
Try to do as much as possible for others.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.190
This is the way we have to change.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:56.201
This has no brand, of any culture, is the
culture of God we are talking about, is the

00:36:56.201 --> 00:36:58.700
culture of His Kingdom.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:07.450
Where we give others, enjoy giving, doing
for others, loving others, caring for others

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:09.330
– without any return.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.481
If you little bit help yourself the Divine
is very anxious.

00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:17.080
You have seen today that the vibrations are
so much that really I am finding it difficult

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.530
even to talk to you, sucking, it’s going
on.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:27.121
Just a little thing you did yesterday, or
this morning.

00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:35.611
Tremendous vibrations, and you’ll be thrown
into that, you’ll blossom into something.

00:37:35.611 --> 00:37:39.480
Just pay attention to yourself and first and
foremost respect yourself because you are

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480
a yogi.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:49.490
You cannot be indignified, you cannot be stupid,
you cannot be high handed, you cannot be dishonest.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:58.371
You have to be a sweet, matured personality
because you are a yogi.

00:37:58.371 --> 00:38:03.861
I mean you should call yourself Yogi X, Y,
Z.

00:38:03.861 --> 00:38:12.621
Should, you are – but calling Yogi and fighting
and pulling each other’s hair, then I would

00:38:12.621 --> 00:38:20.240
say it’s better not call.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.320
Try to get rid of your problems which are
very simple.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.850
If you cannot, then tell Me.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:39.771
I will tell you how to get rid of them.

00:38:39.771 --> 00:38:43.040
Face them out.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:48.501
May God bless you all!

00:38:48.501 --> 00:38:58.311
Now today we’ll not have any havan, that
we have decided because in the Diwali there

00:38:58.311 --> 00:39:05.540
is no need to have any havan but we’ll have
just the puja.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:10.381
Now today is the puja – as you know there
are five days they celebrate Diwali.

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:19.330
The first day is the thirteenth day where
it is the gruhalaksmi’s day, that is the

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:25.540
day when the gruhalaksmi is worshipped.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:35.300
But a gruhalakshmi has to be worthy of the
worship, and then some utensil is given to

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:38.500
the gruhalakshmi.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:43.350
Some sort of a utensil is to be given to the
gruhalakshmi as a present.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:50.710
That is the day Lakshmi was born, Lakshmi
was born out of the Mother Earth.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:59.220
Out of the, we should say, Mother Earth but
She came out of the sea after the churning,

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.010
so that is the birth of the Lakshmi.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:13.471
She’s the giver of wealth, wealth which
is material as well as spiritual.

00:40:13.471 --> 00:40:18.530
A wife who says that: “All right you save
all the money,” teaches the children to

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:25.100
be selfish and teaches the husband to be selfish,
to save all the money in the bank and not

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.441
to be charitable is not a Lakshmi.

00:40:28.441 --> 00:40:32.830
She’s the One who teaches you how to be
charitable, how to give to others.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:41.121
A woman who is very particular about her money
and bank balances is not a Lakshmi at all.

00:40:41.121 --> 00:40:42.121
She has to spend.

00:40:42.121 --> 00:40:43.221
She’s there to spend.

00:40:43.221 --> 00:40:46.700
Man has to preserve his money but the woman
has to spend.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:58.771
He has to earn for she has to spend, but rightly,
spend it rightly, not only for herself but

00:40:58.771 --> 00:41:02.431
for the family, but for the husband.

00:41:02.431 --> 00:41:11.111
She thinks: “What should I buy for my husband,
for my children, for other Sahaja Yogis, for

00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:13.510
other people?” – all her job.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:19.810
The husband earns and gives it to her and
she does that.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.281
It’s a very sweet distribution I think.

00:41:23.281 --> 00:41:27.661
So that’s the day of the Gruhalakshmi when
She’s born.

00:41:27.661 --> 00:41:33.180
She must have these qualities, if she’s
a miserly, calculating type of a woman she

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.070
is not a woman at all to begin with.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:45.681
If she’s worried about her own clothes and
her own comforts and her own things then she’s

00:41:45.681 --> 00:41:47.501
not a Gruhalakshmi.

00:41:47.501 --> 00:41:52.611
She makes others work and sits down herself
and orders about – she’s not a Gruhalakshmi

00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:54.760
at all.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:42:01.500
She has to work for others, she has to do
for others, she has to look after.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.381
That’s the thirteenth day.

00:42:03.381 --> 00:42:07.560
Then the fourteenth day is the day when Narakasura
was killed.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:18.040
You know Narakasura has taken his birth and
he’s to be killed – the Sahaja Yogis are

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.940
going to kill him.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.761
You have to come up to a point and definitely
he can be killed.

00:42:24.761 --> 00:42:28.421
When Kartikeya is awakened within you he can
be killed.

00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:35.250
But for that you have to be just like gold,
untarnishable.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.810
You need strong people to do that.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:48.760
A sword that can kill him has to come out
of your metals, then Narakasura can be killed.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.450
He is one of the worst possible asura.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:54.711
That is the fourteenth day.

00:42:54.711 --> 00:43:05.500
When he was killed the gate of hell was opened
and all those who were his disciples or his

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.070
followers or satanic people were put.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:18.151
That’s the only day you can sleep late,
and a good news for you.

00:43:18.151 --> 00:43:31.450
Then the fifteenth day, is the darkest night
which we had, darkest night, that is the night

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:36.431
when you put the lights on because it is the
darkest night the negative forces can walk

00:43:36.431 --> 00:43:38.080
in.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:43.600
So the lights are put because Lakshmi can
come in.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:52.651
You’ll be surprised how Lakshmiji is, that
if a bottle of wine enters from one end She

00:43:52.651 --> 00:43:54.190
disappears from another.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:44:00.361
If there’s a lady, she’s bhootish in the
family, they can never have the enjoyment

00:44:00.361 --> 00:44:03.600
of Lakshmi.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.871
The Lakshmiji runs away from them.

00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:07.311
They may have money but they cannot enjoy.

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:12.350
The Lakshmiji will run away.

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:18.011
Such a person will be so inauspicious I tell
you.

00:44:18.011 --> 00:44:25.651
Supposing you want to, say, buy something
and such a bhootish person telephones to you-

00:44:25.651 --> 00:44:27.050
cannot get it, finished.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:33.820
First of all your ears will be finished with
the poison and then whatever work you are

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.480
doing you’ll never be successful.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:43.600
Now this country is so full of such bhootish
women – alakshmis, that I don’t know how

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.911
will they become all right.

00:44:46.911 --> 00:44:53.530
The women have to decide to get rid of their
bhoots and not to carry on with them.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:59.470
They must meditate, they must try, if they
feel sleepy they must go and have a bath,

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:07.431
go twice, thrice, sometimes burning yourself
a little bit, doesn’t matter.

00:45:07.431 --> 00:45:12.810
See to it that you don’t feel sleepy and
dreamy.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.901
If you are dreamy by nature then you are bhootish.

00:45:16.901 --> 00:45:26.500
That’s the responsibility of women to keep
the Lakshmi intact.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:31.990
So that’s the Lakshmi Day when we say that
Lakshmi Puja takes place because that is the

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:40.700
day you invite the Lakshmi to come in, the
Rajalakshmi, the Lakshmi by which you become

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:52.980
the king of the family, or the royal benevolence
you can call it, the regal feeling in the

00:45:52.980 --> 00:46:00.310
family – that is the day.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:07.490
Then comes the day, next to that is the first
of the month in…

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:13.590
That is the calendar, My forefathers, because
you’re all My children you have to use the

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:18.790
same calendar, Shalivahanas calendar and that
is the first day of the Shalivahanas calendar.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.621
And what do they do in the morning time to
celebrate it?

00:46:22.621 --> 00:46:35.180
They take one of these jars, Aquarius and
put a shawl with it and that is put as a flag,

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:38.770
representing the Aquarius and the shawl of
the Mother.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:43.131
That’s why they are called as Shalivahana
– the ones who carry the shawls of the Mother,

00:46:43.131 --> 00:46:45.881
the “carriers of the shawls of the Mother”.

00:46:45.881 --> 00:46:49.391
That’s how they put it up.

00:46:49.391 --> 00:46:53.600
The shawl on top of the Aquarius.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:47:03.990
This should be actually the flag of the Sahaja
Yogis that you make it the Aquarius or we

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:14.680
can say the jar [- what do you call that pitcher?

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.990
Or not pitcher but this lota business what
do you call that – there’s nothing used

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.990
like that here.

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:28.760
That one is kumbha – we can call in kumbha
and the shawl is there so they put it up.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.871
That’s why they] (FV note: The section between
square brackets was not found on either my

00:47:29.871 --> 00:47:30.871
audio tape or mp3 file, and hence could not
be verified.

00:47:30.871 --> 00:47:35.631
) call as Gudi Padwa, Padwa means first day
of the moon is Padwa, and Gudi means “this”.

00:47:35.631 --> 00:47:46.320
So they put it up and that is how they say
that today is the New Year day for the Shalivahanas.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:59.720
Shawl is the covering of your Mother which
gives it warmth and also it covers Her modesty.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:06.931
Shawl is a sign of regality and modesty and
chastity.

00:48:06.931 --> 00:48:08.460
So you stand for that of your Mother.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:18.881
You protect it like Ganesha does.

00:48:18.881 --> 00:48:25.611
Only on one point He gets angry, if anybody
says or does anything against the Mother,

00:48:25.611 --> 00:48:29.010
then He comes down.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:34.930
That’s why Christ has said: “Anything
against Me I’ll tolerate, but anything against

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.780
the Holy Ghost, will not be forgiven.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:47.661
” That’s the Son talking about the Mother,
that’s what happens.

00:48:47.661 --> 00:48:51.070
So today is the second day.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:49:03.750
Second day is the Bija – is the they call
it the Bhav-bija is the day when the brother

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:14.780
and the sister, who are the seeds of one tree
have that pure exchange of affection.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:20.690
The sister does the aarti of the brother,
gives him a tika and then brother gives her

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.631
something as a token of his love, as a present.

00:49:24.631 --> 00:49:29.891
In Bombay we started that and they have made
sisters and brothers.

00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:33.780
I wish you also could find out somebody as
a nice brother.

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:44.680
But I found that these relationships have
been so beautifully managed in India that

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:53.480
if they could be managed here, it will be
a great day of really ecstasy for Me, because

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:59.651
that means you have overcome this devil of
immorality.

00:49:59.651 --> 00:50:07.980
The purity, removing the lust and greed from
your mind completely and bestowing that affection

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:12.651
for someone who is your sister.

00:50:12.651 --> 00:50:17.391
Very common in India, everybody has a sister
there; all the Sahaja Yogis have a sister

00:50:17.391 --> 00:50:20.990
and they look after their sister that way.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:28.450
Is a very sweet feeling and a sister is treated
– like Raulbai is a sister of Dumas you

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:35.911
can imagine, and her sister is treated with
the same grace as the own sister is to be

00:50:35.911 --> 00:50:39.361
treated with all the relationships and everything.

00:50:39.361 --> 00:50:42.670
So this is the fifth day is Dwija.

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:47.891
So from thirteenth to the fifth day they celebrate
Diwali.

00:50:47.891 --> 00:50:51.260
For us Diwali has a very great significance.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:51:00.881
That is, from one light many lights are awakened
and they are put in a line, so they are called

00:51:00.881 --> 00:51:04.790
as Diwali – means ‘the lights put in a
line’.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:13.131
So when you hold My Hands together all of
us – through that the energy passes and

00:51:13.131 --> 00:51:27.500
the enlightened rasa is established, and the
whole world has to become that beautiful reign

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:43.540
of your Mother where nothing but the bliss
of your Father and His enjoyment when He sees

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:50.050
His Own Creation dancing in that Ocean of
Bliss.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:52.201
May God bless you.
