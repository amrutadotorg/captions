00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.590
… that the source of joy is within your
Self.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:15.160
Unless and until you seek your Self you cannot
seek God.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.029
They have all talked about the second birth.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:36.960
What we call the baptism is also the same
where you have to be born again.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.690
Is not just a formal one that is done by unauthorized
people.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:59.830
Even the word “Musalman”, Mohammed Sahib
has again and again talked of a rebirth.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.190
You have to find your Self.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.190
How do we find our Selves is the problem.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.190
Is there something like “Self”?

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:21.070
Is there really something like “God” or
it’s all a myth?

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:36.120
Is there any fact in following the religious
holy life that you get your salvation?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:43.820
So far, we have had no proof of it.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.850
Naturally, in this scientific world today
you have to give the proof of everything to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.720
convince people so that they seek them Selves.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:08.970
But the science tells us that we were evolved
from a little amoeba to a human being.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.290
Why?

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.310
Why God took so much trouble?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.220
If you don’t believe in God you can say
nature.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.470
Why nature worked so hard to create a human
being out of a small little amoeba?

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.550
Supposing we assemble some screws, and we
try to work out something, a passer-by would

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.550
ask, “Why?

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.020
What are you going to make out of this instrument?

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:45.060
What are you doing?”

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:55.840
There must be some reason why we have become
human beings after so much of evolution.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.960
But science doesn’t think of “why."

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.090
It just tells you, “This is."

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.240
And whatever is not there, it says, “We
can’t explain."

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:19.879
The instrument, whatever it is, supposing
has to work on electrical energy or on any

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:29.560
energy whatsoever will come into force or
will start working out when it is connected

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.099
to the mains.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:43.510
Otherwise it is still in the making process
or you can say it is in transition.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.330
Human being as such is in transition.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.390
It has not found its own meaning.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:02.650
He does not know why he exists, what is the
purpose of his life.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.319
It’s a meaningless life.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.350
So, you have to be connected to the mains.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:18.061
That’s what everybody has been saying that
you have to be reborn, you have to become

00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:19.220
that.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.650
Now, those who talked of this were born on
the tenth storey.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.300
The rest of them are on this earth.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.820
When they talked it all went over their heads.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.330
You have to at least reach the first or second
storey to understand that there is something

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.560
beyond this human consciousness, this human
awareness.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.330
There’s something more to this awareness.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.730
There’s a more opening.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:02.640
There’s a greater dimension which one has
to achieve to understand your own meaning.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.910
About Kundalini all the scriptures, I must
say, have described, all the scriptures without

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.910
exception.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:28.030
Of course, in India there has been a very
deep meditation tendency thousands of years

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:43.480
back and some of the seers long time back
found out about Kundalini, and even in [Dhirenja

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.480
Sangita?]

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.480
Kundalini is described.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.670
That’s as old, I should say, about Vedas.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.280
We cannot say the origin of these books.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.680
Kundalini has been described in them.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.070
Kundalini has been again and again described
and also abused and misused and misrepresented.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:06.330
All sorts of things have been done about Kundalini.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:19.440
In the Bible Kundalini has been described
in such a manner that it is not called as

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.830
Kundalini, but they call it as “Tree of
Fire,” “Tongues of Flames."

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.690
Many such adjectives, descriptions are used,
but they have not used the word Kundalini

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.400
itself because it is not written in Sanskrit
language.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.639
So, there must be some mechanism within us
by which we are reborn, no doubt.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.960
There has to be some mechanism.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:58.759
If I’m speaking through this mike to you,
there must be some mechanism which is doing

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.000
the job.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.370
In every seed there is a premule, the mechanism
which germinates and creates a big tree out

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.440
of it.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:21.700
In the same way we have a mechanism placed
within us.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.949
But this is a very subtle thing while human
beings are absolutely gross.

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:35.460
In this Kali Yuga, modern times, they are
even worse, extremely gross and they cannot

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.830
think of something subtle.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:45.350
If I tell you there is an energy which thinks,
organizes, loves, you cannot think of such

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.350
an energy.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.229
But how do we organize?

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:49.520
How do we think?

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.520
How do we love?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.930
From where do we get that energy?

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.949
Why shouldn’t we think about it?

00:07:54.949 --> 00:08:02.530
But as I said that modern man doesn’t think
of “how,” he takes it for granted.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:09.410
So, today I want to tell you about this mechanism
that exists within you.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.210
It should not be just a mental feat with you.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.210
No!

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:22.000
It should not be the so-called knowledge of
Kundalini from outside but it’s a happening

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.650
where the Kundalini rises and you get that
whatever is promised in all the scriptures.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:40.560
Today the time has come to prove the existence
of the Divine Power of God all around us.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.490
We have been going and praying to God.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.679
Does He listen to us?

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:46.679
Are we connected to Him?

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:55.199
We do namaz, we spread our hands towards God
Almighty, are we connected with Him or we

00:08:55.199 --> 00:08:58.339
are just doing a mechanical thing?

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:00.839
Even so many people are doing Hatha Yoga.

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:05.759
They think they are doing it in the name of
God.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:08.449
Is it a correct method?

00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:11.689
Can we do anything about it?

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:20.120
If it is a living process, if it is an evolutionary
process, we must think we have done nothing

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.240
for our own evolution so far.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:31.600
From amoeba to this stage we have come without
doing anything about it.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:39.759
We have taken our human life for granted.

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:42.489
So what can we do about it?

00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:50.730
If it is a living process, it has to be spontaneous,
it has to work by itself, like a seed which

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.800
is planted germinates by itself.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.480
At the most a gardener can pour little water.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:08.569
I can pour the water of My love on your seed
– at the most but the seed has to germinate

00:10:08.569 --> 00:10:10.410
by itself spontaneously.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.529
It is a living process and not the mechanical
process.

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:18.749
Perhaps we never realize what is a living
process because we take it for granted.

00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:24.860
You see so many flowers turning into fruits
but we never think how it happens.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.499
We have no idea of spontaneity.

00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:31.319
We think by doing something we are being spontaneous.

00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:40.350
So one has to be effortless because Kundalini
is born with you.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.360
‘Sahaja’: ‘born with you’.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.610
‘Saha’ means ‘with’.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.869
Born with you.

00:10:47.869 --> 00:10:50.129
‘Ja’ means ‘born’.

00:10:50.129 --> 00:11:03.959
So awakening is a happening which happens
to you when somebody who is awakened, like

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:15.949
an enlightened light or a candle, comes near
other lights which are not yet enlightened

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:18.990
and enlightens it spontaneously.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.690
Now you cannot argue it out, you cannot.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:32.360
You cannot rationalize it because rationality
is a limited thing.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.360
You have to go to something that is unlimited.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.420
How can you do it with a limited mind?

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:44.709
This is beyond mind you have to rise.

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:50.959
If you argue it out, you are going to be away
from it.

00:11:50.959 --> 00:12:02.049
But in science we have found out many things
which indicate, which actually prepares the

00:12:02.049 --> 00:12:11.790
stage for Sahaja Yoga, which prepares us to
know that there’s something beyond.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:23.529
We have accepted in the medical science that
we have autonomous nervous system which works

00:12:23.529 --> 00:12:24.699
by itself.

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:28.790
We call it ‘auto’: souayam [somatic-?],
chyme.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.120
Who is this “auto”?

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.649
Who is this “one”?

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:40.379
The one who beats your heart, the one who
digests your food?

00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:48.059
When we said that it is done by a system,
you just give it a name.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.989
But how do you explain?

00:12:49.989 --> 00:12:52.369
You cannot do it.

00:12:52.369 --> 00:12:58.939
You may be able to increase the rate of your
heart beat but you cannot decrease it.

00:12:58.939 --> 00:13:02.410
It happens spontaneously, automatically.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.879
How does it happen?

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:10.089
By giving it a name you do not explain.

00:13:10.089 --> 00:13:22.439
In psychology people have found out that there
is something like a universal Unconscious.

00:13:22.439 --> 00:13:30.519
There is that “sarvavyapi achetan” [all-pervasive
action] which gives symbolic suggestions in

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:34.009
the dreams which are universally the same.

00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:38.019
They’ve accepted this.

00:13:38.019 --> 00:13:47.600
They have proved it by experiments that there
is a universal unconscious, so many of them.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:55.259
I shouldn’t say all of them because, you
see, after all there will be always a controversy

00:13:55.259 --> 00:13:58.999
till you reach the truth.

00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:02.120
Human mind must have something to eat.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:09.800
But they have, they talk of it.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:19.269
Scientists cannot explain many things.

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:23.329
There is another thing which science cannot
explain is why certain things act differently

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.889
in a human body.

00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:31.290
For example there are two chemicals known
as adrenaline and acetylcholine.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.129
They have certain chemical reaction.

00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:37.720
But in the body they react differently.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:44.199
They cannot explain, they just say the mood
of action of these chemicals in the human

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:47.769
body cannot be explained.

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:50.480
Finished.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:59.949
In the human body or in any body as such whichever
is living, any foreign matter is thrown out.

00:14:59.949 --> 00:15:11.839
But when a mother conceives a child in the
womb it is not thrown out, but it is nurtured

00:15:11.839 --> 00:15:13.350
and looked after.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.869
Who does that?

00:15:14.869 --> 00:15:21.509
Who understands that this is not a foreign
matter, but is a future child?

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:28.649
Is there somebody thinking inside your uterus
or something that is controlling, who takes

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:30.169
the decision?

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:40.459
There must be someone or for [you], at least
minimum of a human level who thinks for you?

00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:53.519
So already there are questions for scientists
to ask and they all can be answered.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:16:07.490
Because the knowledge of science is analytical,
is in different corners, it gives you part-knowledge.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:15.920
Now Kundalini can be seen, you can see it.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.089
The pulsation of the Kundalini you can see
at least.

00:16:18.089 --> 00:16:19.089
Many doctors have seen it now.

00:16:19.089 --> 00:16:21.449
In Delhi of course we don’t have any doctors
so far.

00:16:21.449 --> 00:16:23.749
I don’t know if among you there are any
doctors.

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:29.339
But you can see with your own eyes the pulsation
of the Kundalini very clearly.

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:38.149
If you have a stethoscope you can even feel
it, the rising of the anahata, means the throbbing.

00:16:38.149 --> 00:16:42.019
It can be done.

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:55.689
But how long are we going to sit asking for
proof of a Kundalini?

00:16:55.689 --> 00:16:57.720
Let us now see.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:05.010
As I told you this morning you must accept
this as the hypothesis.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:11.429
Modern times are the worst times for one reason
that you have to explain everything which

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:16.339
is a very simple thing as far as religion
is concerned.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:22.970
As far as other things are concerned you don’t
have to explain, people just accept.

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:28.179
For example, if you have to put on this light
I have to just tell you that you go and switch

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:29.179
on.

00:17:29.179 --> 00:17:32.830
That’s all, nobody argues.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.870
But today in the morning I told somebody to
put his hands towards Me like this, he started

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.000
arguing on this point only, “Why should
I do it?”

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.100
Now I said, “I have to tell you the whole
thing, why it is to be done?”

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:45.269
Is a simple gesture he could not do.

00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:51.200
And he has come here for the Kundalini rising,
you know, with all the rights on Me.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.510
You can’t even put your hands towards Me?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:58.660
Arguments have brought you nowhere.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.750
You must understand.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.450
This talking “bla, bla” has led you nowhere.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.259
What have you achieved in that?

00:18:08.259 --> 00:18:12.389
You think you have done this job, built this
building you’ve done.

00:18:12.389 --> 00:18:16.179
It’s all dead, all dead things, dead converted
into another dead.

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:22.760
What living work have you done so far?

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.759
What have you done so far that you can call
as living?

00:18:27.759 --> 00:18:38.980
You cannot do even a seed sprout!

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:46.100
The One who does millions and millions of
such things, billions and billions of these

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:55.390
seeds sprouted, when we have to know Him,
at least let us have the humility to know

00:18:55.390 --> 00:19:03.330
that through your rationality and so-called
intellect you are not going to know Him.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.700
A little drop wants to know the whole of the
ocean!

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:13.320
How can you explain to an ant the human civilization
and the human problems, and how can you explain

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:23.159
to a human being the working of the subtle,
divine forces.

00:19:23.159 --> 00:19:27.210
God has been challenged by man.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.970
See the greatness!

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:46.920
That’s why in all the scriptures it is written,
“Humble down yourself in your heart."

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:52.480
That doesn’t mean that you give up your
intellect, doesn’t mean at all, but you

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.000
must have the balance of your heart also.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:08.470
So, with all these apologetic words and introduction,
I am now telling you about the Kundalini,

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.929
where It exists, because now don’t start
from the very beginning doubting.

00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:16.539
Please keep your mind open.

00:20:16.539 --> 00:20:22.250
Later on when you get your realization through
Sahaja Yoga, when you practice it … Now

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.029
we have many here who have got it.

00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:31.360
And they have seen the working of the Kundalini
and have confirmed what I’ve been saying

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.360
about it.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.600
But to you it will be quite shocking.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:45.630
I know it will be because you cannot believe
that such a thing can be inside us.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:51.669
Of course the mechanism has been simplified
because this is just a, I should say, a primary

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:53.820
class, the first standard.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:59.460
So, it has not been that complicated as it
is.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.080
I’ll try to make it simpler and simpler.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:08.200
But you must know that it is a subtle thing
which you have not seen yourself, you’ve

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.220
not felt it, you’ve not known it so far.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:22.880
It’s something out of the blue for you and
in this so called scientifically enlightened

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:31.279
world it may sound quite foolish to you that
I’m saying these things.

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:34.510
But it is like this.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.909
Do not be fanatic about things.

00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:40.399
Even there are scientists who are real fanatics.

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:50.600
Science is another obsession which has really
killed their foresight.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.340
Can you see from here?

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.020
Now, this is the picture.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.809
As they say man is made in the image of God.

00:22:00.809 --> 00:22:07.110
We can say now, let us see, ‘Liver’s Tone’
means ‘the Object of which you are the reflection’.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:18.580
So we’ll start from the top.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:32.419
When the child is in the womb of the mother,
the energy which you do not know, the energy

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:42.789
that is all pervading called as Chaitanya,
is the divine power of love of God which is

00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:43.789
all around us.

00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:47.490
This sounds quite poetic only to people; [for]
many people is just a poetry.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.320
But it is not, it’s a fact.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.000
Because we have never tried this power before,
we only know the power of hatred.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:04.760
So this power of divine love of God which
is all pervading, which is all around us,

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.740
descends within us.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:18.261
Yes, it does in the human beings also, when
the child is in the womb of the mother.

00:23:18.261 --> 00:23:29.880
The brain of the man is evolved in such a
manner that it gets a shape of a prism, of

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:39.240
a prism which has got three sides and a base.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:55.159
When this energy enters into the brain, then
it passes into all the surfaces of the brain,

00:23:55.159 --> 00:24:02.549
and some passes through the center on top
here.

00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:15.360
You can say not the center but the apex as
shown here.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:23.789
At the back it passes through the brain straight
into the medulla oblongata that is in the

00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:36.330
spinal chord and forms your central nervous
system, as you call it as C.N.S.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:47.429
On the other side of the brain, left side
of the brain, it comes down this way but when

00:24:47.429 --> 00:24:55.299
it has to pass through the brain it goes into
the fraction because of different densities

00:24:55.299 --> 00:25:01.720
and then passes into the medulla oblongata
loosing some of its resultant on the side

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:08.639
into the spinal chord through the medulla
oblongata.

00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:17.220
Another one which falls on the right hand
side goes to the left hand side through the

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.220
refraction.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:24.530
Again it looses some of its outside as a resultant,
is divided into two, one going down, and one

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:34.309
this way and goes down in the medulla oblongata.

00:25:34.309 --> 00:25:47.409
The one which falls on the apex of the brain
passes through the center, and part of it,

00:25:47.409 --> 00:25:54.590
quite a part of it, escapes into the triangular
bone as Kundalini.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:26:01.679
This is the arrangement made when you are
born by God.

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:03.690
I call it God because it is so.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:07.190
Of course, if there is God or not that we’ll
see later on.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:12.120
That proof I have to give you but not just
now.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:21.990
This happens in a very subtle manner because
as I told you, is a subtle energy but is expressed

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:31.590
in the gross way in our being as three autonomous
nervous systems.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.670
The central one is known as the parasympathetic
nervous system, is expressed as the parasympathetic

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.670
nervous system.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:44.990
There
are two sympathetic nervous systems, left

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.450
and right.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:54.240
But in the subtle form – which Kabira has
described, Kabira has described very clearly

00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:06.330
– in the subtle form the channels that are
carrying those subtle energies are: in the

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:15.460
center the channel is called as Sushumna Nadi,
on the right hand side one channel it is called

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:23.259
as the Pingala Nadi and the left hand side
one is called as the Ida Nadi.

00:27:23.259 --> 00:27:33.549
These are the subtle things which are existing
inside the medulla oblongata, not outside.

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:36.360
So, you see, when the doctor opens the medulla
oblongata the person dies.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.639
How can you see?

00:27:37.639 --> 00:27:41.169
How can you see a subtle form of energy through
your eyes?

00:27:41.169 --> 00:27:47.619
You cannot see even your electricity through
your eyes unless and until there is a lamp

00:27:47.619 --> 00:27:51.320
which is enlightened.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:57.909
So, you cannot see those energies which are
at work inside in a subtle form but you can

00:27:57.909 --> 00:28:02.899
see the expression of it in the gross form
outside.

00:28:02.899 --> 00:28:27.419
Now these three energies are like the breath
which flows through a flute.

00:28:27.419 --> 00:28:33.610
The breath that flows through a flute passes
through seven holes.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:39.929
In the same way there are seven chakras, basically,
main.

00:28:39.929 --> 00:28:45.620
When we say seven holes, actually there are
more.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.159
Basically I am saying.

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:50.639
I will tell you about the other ones later
on.

00:28:50.639 --> 00:28:57.110
Just now I am telling you the, absolutely,
as I told you in the primary, first standard

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.110
class.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.830
I am telling you the basic things.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:07.879
So these chakras, the centers that are placed
within our being which are there, existing

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:16.350
there and acting there, and which are in a
subtle form are expressed outside as plexuses

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.179
which doctors know.

00:29:18.179 --> 00:29:22.100
Is there any doctor in this room?

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.220
All right.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:28.980
They are expressed as plexus and doctors know
about the plexuses because they can see the

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.259
plexuses outside.

00:29:31.259 --> 00:29:34.499
But what are the centers that are controlled
them?

00:29:34.499 --> 00:29:39.409
I do not know if the medical science has gone
that far to accept that there are centers

00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:43.860
inside the medulla oblongata which is controlling
these centers.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.710
I don’t know.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:51.580
I have done medicine for the same reason because
I had to talk to these doctors and scientists

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.580
later on.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.580
So, I’ve done it.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.950
But at that time it was not so.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:00.640
Even in My nomenclature, you see, I’ll be
using those old terminologies which I learned

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.570
in My young age, and if there’s any difference
you shouldn’t mind because it, you people

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:10.700
are changing your nomenclature every now and
then.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:23.559
So, these subtle centers that are placed inside
the medulla oblongata act on the gross plexuses

00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:25.360
that are outside.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:33.059
Doctors will accept that much, I know.

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:39.186
They won’t have an objection to that but
little further they will not go.

00:30:39.186 --> 00:30:40.186
They cannot.

00:30:40.186 --> 00:30:43.919
They should not as doctors but as Sahaja Yogis
they will.

00:30:43.919 --> 00:30:50.929
Once you have the experience and once you
have found out, then why will you say, “No."

00:30:50.929 --> 00:30:56.830
But one thing we must know that if there is
no microscope how can you see something that

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.960
is in a cell??

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.619
With these eyes you may not be able to see
something.

00:31:03.619 --> 00:31:08.679
But supposing you get those eyes which are
microscopic, and if you tell others, they

00:31:08.679 --> 00:31:11.840
are not going to believe because they must
also get the microscopic eyes.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:24.929
This is a little problem of Sahaja Yoga that
it has to happen to you, that you could see

00:31:24.929 --> 00:31:28.139
all these things what I’m talking about.

00:31:28.139 --> 00:31:33.669
Now, let us see what are these centers.

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:35.580
Now when I describe them you need not get
a fright.

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.580
You need not accept.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.740
Again and again I’m trying to describe that.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.710
You see, with children, it is very difficult.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:43.850
You have to take them this way, that way.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.419
God knows where their mind will just slip
out.

00:31:46.419 --> 00:31:49.500
You see they will find out some loophole somewhere
and just disappear.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.110
So, I have to take your attention properly,
so that you get the sap that you are here

00:31:54.110 --> 00:32:03.309
for, that you get what you have within yourself,
you get your own powers so that you know your

00:32:03.309 --> 00:32:04.309
Self.

00:32:04.309 --> 00:32:08.950
So, I have to, you see, “child” to you
and look after you and manage you very well,

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.749
so that there is no problem.

00:32:11.749 --> 00:32:19.559
Don’t allow your attention to just capture
you, your mind to take you away, you see,

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:22.940
because your mind will be playing tricks with
you.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.340
So be careful.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:31.470
Of course, you should not also get brainwashed
by what I’m saying.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:41.580
You can judge Me very well whether whatever
I’m saying is correct or not.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.580
Now, the lowest chakra.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.379
This chakra, this center which is a subtle,
again I’m saying, it is a subtle center,

00:32:47.379 --> 00:32:59.509
is not a gross center, is a subtle center
placed outside the human body and the subtle

00:32:59.509 --> 00:33:02.379
is not localized at a point.

00:33:02.379 --> 00:33:13.990
You see, it’s an energy outside the spinal
chord in the prostrate gland, and is known.

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:20.549
And now somebody might say that if the prostrate
gland is removed then it exists still but

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:21.549
it has…

00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:24.230
Supposing there’s a chair I’m sitting
on it, I say, ”She’s sitting on the chair."

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:27.399
Now the chair is removed, I’m not removed.

00:33:27.399 --> 00:33:34.409
Or if the, they say that men have prostrate
glands, so what about the women.

00:33:34.409 --> 00:33:36.249
You see, like that the questions can come
up.

00:33:36.249 --> 00:33:38.340
So I’m saying it’s a living subtle center.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.649
So you don’t worry about their chairs.

00:33:41.649 --> 00:33:47.549
I’m just giving you a little location which
may not be the same for everyone.

00:33:47.549 --> 00:34:03.460
And it acts on the pelvic plexus which we
call as Mooladhara Chakra in the Sanskrit

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:07.340
language, because that time there was no English
language.

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.629
That doesn’t mean that I’m preaching anything
Hinduism or anything like that.

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:12.940
All the saints, I will tell you.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.210
I will also tell you about Christ where He
exists.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.490
I’ll also tell you about Mohammed Sahib
where He exists, about all of them.

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.480
So it is no question of one religion or anything.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:28.389
But these are different things which came
in the evolutionary process of man, and all

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:35.280
the evolution that took place in every human
being is within himself, is recorded, and

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.440
he’s standing on that.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:43.589
For example as you come up to first storey
you should know that the whole first storey

00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:47.690
is there, second storey, it exists, third
storey, it exists.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:52.270
In the same way all these storeys that you
have climbed in your own evolutionary process

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.780
are on these seven steps which I’m telling
you.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:35:02.099
So, the first step is that of Mooladhara Chakra
which is controlled by a deity, is a symbol.

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:18.320
Same from the universal unconscious I’m
telling is a symbol, and this symbol is that

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.100
of Shri Ganesha.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.660
This is going to shock everyone.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.890
They are very few, they will have a photograph
of Shri Ganesha, no doubt, but we’ll believe

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:34.079
that this is a living symbol that exists within
us on this point.

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:35.970
It does.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.010
What is the proof and everything I will tell
you.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:42.859
But first now, just now you see for yourself.

00:35:42.859 --> 00:35:44.829
Is Shri Ganesha.

00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:51.220
And then if I tell you the same Shri Ganesha
which is a symbol here has incarnated on this

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:56.069
earth as Jesus Christ.

00:35:56.069 --> 00:36:06.870
He is the symbol of eternal childhood, of
holiness.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:24.600
And as you know that this center controls
the sex also, this symbol suggests that in

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:35.930
religion you must have innocence of Shri Ganesh.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:41.760
Those who say that sex can be sublimated,
tantrikas who use sex for sublimation are

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.720
the greatest sinners on this earth.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.310
Sex has to be sanctified and holy.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:37:00.210
If you do not have a sanctified and holy sex
you cannot get your realization, I’m sorry.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:06.500
Those who talk of liberation at sex must realize
this: they are ruining their Kundalini completely

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.730
because Kundalini is like a mother, Gauri
who is sitting inside them.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:18.650
And for Indians it is very easy to understand
that you cannot have sex with your mother.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:28.540
Those who talk of exciting sex for Realization
are the greatest sinners because this is the

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.000
greatest sin.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:46.000
And those who excite their own ideas about
sex by accepting all these licentious and

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.780
permissive things about their sex which is
the holiest of holy are killing their tabernacle.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.660
They are completely finishing off themselves.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.150
There is no saving for such people.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.730
Is going to be very, very hard for them.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:09.000
One has to work very hard for these people.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.980
And if you come to My London center they will
tell you what happens, how difficult it is.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:22.390
One shudders to see how we have played foolishly
with ourselves by experimentations.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:26.270
Will you experiment yourself with these electrical
appliances?

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:31.990
Let me see anybody who puts their hands into
the oven to experiment!

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:37.150
Without holiness you cannot talk of God.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:43.410
Take it from Me.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.410
You may not like it.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.410
No.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:46.490
Many won’t like it.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:51.809
Because their guru must sit down here and
say, “Yes, yes, you must do."

00:38:51.809 --> 00:38:54.140
You need a guru also for such a thing, imagine.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:00.010
Human beings as they are they keep a guru
who says, “This is the greatest dharmic

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.140
thing you must do."

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.140
Imagine.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:11.950
Tomorrow you have to face God remember, even
if you do not get your Realization.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.359
Those who try these tricks are punished in
this life time.

00:39:16.359 --> 00:39:22.339
They don’t have to take course to any other
life or after death.

00:39:22.339 --> 00:39:30.770
In this life time, you have to have a sanctified
holy married life.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:38.270
Marriage institutions according to human beings
it is made by human beings.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.470
It is not.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:43.940
It is made by God.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:48.290
I’m not here to please you.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:53.300
I have to tell you the fact and the truth
of life.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:40:01.760
One has to lead a very holy life.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.579
That is the essential part.

00:40:04.579 --> 00:40:12.200
And I’m very sorry for one thing that Christ
who was the incarnation of that holiness,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:19.700
who is worshipped in those countries is being
insulted completely by those people.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:28.339
He was a celibate person throughout and today
they are making a picture on the sex life

00:40:28.339 --> 00:40:29.339
of Christ.

00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:30.900
In India is not possible.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.290
Thank God, here it is not possible.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:36.349
They dare not talk like this, shamelessly
and vulgarly.

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:40.770
There is no shame about it in those people.

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.690
They have forgotten God.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:53.990
And that’s why when I talk of Shri Ganesha,
you must know that you have to be like a child

00:40:53.990 --> 00:41:01.170
when you want to have the blessings of Kundalini
because She’s your mother and She’s all

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.530
the time following you.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:07.039
She’s born again and again within you and
She’s watching you and She’s recording

00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:09.920
all that you have been doing.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.730
And who is doing the recording?

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:25.190
In the heart you find there is the flicker
of Spirit, of Atma which is the reflection

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.560
of God Almighty.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:35.200
That is the Spirit which records because it
witnesses.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.340
It’s a “sakshi”, it’s a witness whatever
you are doing in life.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:46.660
And is all recorded in the Kundalini, and
at the time of Kundalini awakening She shows.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.910
Many people ask Me, “Mother, how do you
know?”

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:54.190
Because the Kundalini is My part, She tells
Me all that.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:58.660
And I know about their problems because She
tells Me.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:05.250
It’s all recorded like a tape recorder you
have got the cassette, the spindle, it is

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:09.240
there.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:22.220
And the Kundalini is in the form of Gauri
who is a virgin just married to Shiva.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:30.339
It’s a symbolic expression, is a poetic
expression that She’s sitting and having

00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:35.900
Her bath before meeting Her Lord.

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:44.039
And Shiva is in the heart the Atma.

00:42:44.039 --> 00:42:50.349
And Ganesha She creates out of Her vibrations.

00:42:50.349 --> 00:43:01.020
On Her own being She takes out the mala as
they call it, the dirt, and makes a Ganesha.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:15.520
Ganesha is created by Mother, as Christ was
created by Mother Herself.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:26.840
And She places Him behind the bathroom, you
can say, to safeguard Her lajja, you can say

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.950
‘Her chastity’.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:35.280
So, He looks after Her protocol.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:41.970
Nobody can enter through that side, it is
prohibited.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:53.190
Who can rise to the status of Shri Ganesha
who is beyond all contamination, who is holiness

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.190
personified?

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:58.740
He’s like a lotus born out of the mud.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:08.400
We worship Ganesha in the house and we do
all kinds of things with ourselves.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:18.789
We are not bothered about holiness, about
keeping our dignity.

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:22.829
How can He be pleased here?

00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:29.420
But Ganesha doesn’t come in the Kundalini
rising because Kundalini is placed higher.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.849
Already She is placed higher in all of us.

00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:33.680
We are already sublimated.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.289
So, He’s the only one who sanctions.

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:43.210
He’s in charge.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:55.210
Then you find a very white round center which
is called as the Nabhi Chakra.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:59.890
Those who understand Hindi or Marathi or Sanskrit
know what is Nabhi.

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:06.540
Is the navel, you can call it the navel Chakra.

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:13.200
Then the Nabhi Chakra is also called as Manipur
Chakra in the Sanskrit language.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.119
But for our practical purposes name does not
matter.

00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:19.430
Is the Nabhi Chakra we can say, everybody
understand what is a nabhi.

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:30.349
But it is not here in the nabhi, it is at
the back, in the medulla oblongata it is placed.

00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:43.060
Now, this Nabhi Chakra or the Manipur Chakra
is the center which controls the solar plexus

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.460
in the human beings.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:53.569
This is the center, is the center of dharma,
of religion.

00:45:53.569 --> 00:45:59.420
When I talk of religion, everybody will say,
“Oh, Mataji believes in religion."

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:03.390
Now, you must understand what is the word
‘dharma’ means.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:10.630
‘Dharma’ means ‘Dharayati sa dharma’,
‘your sustenance’.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:14.770
Carbon has four valances.

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:23.119
Every element has got a different property
that is the dharma of every element.

00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:31.609
Every animal has got a certain quality, that
is the dharma of an animal.

00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:39.069
Human beings also have some sustaining qualities.

00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:40.069
They are human beings.

00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:47.060
Otherwise they are pischachas or rakshasas
or devils or satanic or they are sub-human.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:53.800
To be a human being minimum of minimum you
must have those ten qualities, ten dharmas

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.800
within yourself.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.140
If you do not have, you are not a human being.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.300
You become satanic.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.900
You become sub-human.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.339
Your awareness goes down, it’s lowered.

00:47:06.339 --> 00:47:11.220
These are above the ten commandments I should
say, above because there are certain things

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:15.079
which are not mentioned in them clearly, in
the Bible.

00:47:15.079 --> 00:47:23.630
These are the ten basic qualities in a human
being one should have, and if you do not have

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:24.890
then there are problems.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:29.920
For example, we should not shock people – means
drinking.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:34.359
People say, “What’s wrong in drinking,
Mataji?”

00:47:34.359 --> 00:47:38.799
Simple thing, it goes against your awareness.

00:47:38.799 --> 00:47:43.859
See these drinks and all these alcohols they
are not created for drinking at all.

00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:47.779
They were created by God no doubt, but for
polishing.

00:47:47.779 --> 00:47:51.359
You see if you want to polish a diamond, you
have to use gin.

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:54.130
Gin is not meant for drinking, for human consumption.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:55.250
It is not meant.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:48:00.839
This is human brain, you know, is such a wonderful
thing that it is using gin for their stomach

00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:02.589
which spoils their liver, gives them cancer.

00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:10.240
And you blame God for all these calamities
of the world.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:16.040
Smoking, now of course, many are saying smoking
causes cancer.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.700
Thank God.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.220
What is tobacco meant for?

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.869
Is for insecticide, it’s an insecticide.

00:48:22.869 --> 00:48:26.369
I’m telling the truth.

00:48:26.369 --> 00:48:34.109
But ‘you’ use it for intoxication or what
you call, I don’t know.

00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:45.430
Now when all the gurus, even Moses, they told
about this.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.390
All the gurus have told.

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:49.890
Incarnations have not but gurus have.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.079
I mean the real ones.

00:48:51.079 --> 00:48:53.940
I’m not saying these fake ones that are
these days, modern days are just making a

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.880
business proposition of everything.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:05.859
I’m not talking about them but the real
ones, who are all born in this void – the

00:49:05.859 --> 00:49:10.520
void described by the Zen system of religion
– all the ten gurus.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:24.400
We can say the same there again the ten gurus
are incarnated, they tell us about the dharma.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:36.089
The center Nabhi Chakra is governed by the
deity called as Vishnu and His power is Lakshmi.

00:49:36.089 --> 00:49:46.660
Now, if your Nabhi Chakra is caught whatever
you may try you cannot get the blessings of

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.780
Lakshmi.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:48.910
You cannot get.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:53.690
And even if you have lakshmi it will disappear.

00:49:53.690 --> 00:50:00.640
It’s a fact which can be proved.

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:09.540
This Nabhi Chakra is controlled by a deity,
Vishnu, which is the sustaining aspect of

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.910
God.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:18.980
Vishnu gives the different dharmas to us.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:24.240
That’s how He has evolved us from amoeba
to human beings.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:29.720
He Himself has incarnated as a leader many
a times.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:38.390
We call it Dashavatara and He has led us through
these incarnations.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:49.400
And His power is Lakshmi, is the Goddess of
welfare they say, or you can call it is wealth.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.400
It is not.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.140
It’s a very subtle thing, very subtle.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:51:03.109
That’s a symbol one should understand because
is concerned with us.

00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:11.770
Lakshmi has got a womanly figure, a mother’s
figure.

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.849
She doesn’t have an actresses figure, you
see.

00:51:14.849 --> 00:51:20.810
They show of actresses and this beauty what
you call ‘beauty contests’, are not good

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.470
vibrations at all.

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:23.970
They do not emit any vibrations.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:30.190
On the contrary they emit very dirty vibrations,
I must say, very vulgar, very filthy.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.230
Lakshmi is a mother.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:36.559
She doesn’t use Her body for provocating
expressions.

00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:37.559
No.

00:51:37.559 --> 00:51:38.559
She’s a mother.

00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:48.560
So, a lakshmipathi, a man who is supposed
to be adorned by a lakshmi, a rich man, should

00:51:48.560 --> 00:52:04.710
have the personality of a mother, a one who
is lajjasheela as we call it, who is chaste,

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:16.160
who respects the chastity, who is loving,
generous, affectionate like a mother.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.799
Mother tolerates all the nonsense of the people,
of the children.

00:52:20.799 --> 00:52:30.840
Then in Her two hands She has two beautiful
pink colored lotuses, two flowers of lotuses.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:37.110
The lotus expresses the Shri.

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:38.470
‘Shri’ means ‘the grace’.

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:42.890
If I say ‘beauty’, immediately your eyes
will go to those beauty contests.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.349
I do not mean they are not beautiful.

00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:48.819
‘Beautiful’ is not a word which these
days means ‘provocating’.

00:52:48.819 --> 00:52:49.819
No.

00:52:49.819 --> 00:53:02.250
Beauty means the complete personality that
emits vibrations, which is a form or is the

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:10.930
same as joy and ananda, that we call ananda,
joy and also consciousness.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:14.339
That is a very complicated thing.

00:53:14.339 --> 00:53:23.240
So, I would just say that is the form that
emits the vibrations of joy.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:31.410
In Her hands are two lotus flowers which are
pink.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:37.920
Means such a person has to be a warm person,
has to be a cozy personality, and his house

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.609
should be as cozy.

00:53:39.609 --> 00:53:43.359
It should not be all polished and varnished.

00:53:43.359 --> 00:53:47.660
And if somebody comes in the house, he drops
anything, flowers there, the woman starts

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:48.960
getting angry or the man says, “Oh, you
have dirtied my house.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.910
Will you please clean it."

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:53.950
Such a house is not a home.

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.630
It has to be a home for all the people.

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:59.690
Such a man is lakshmipathi.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:02.559
Otherwise morning till evening the fighting
going on between husband and wife, “You

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:03.559
didn’t keep the house clean.

00:54:03.559 --> 00:54:05.089
You must clean this and you must sweep that."

00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:09.680
As if the cleanliness has become the main
part of human life.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.829
I can understand a basic cleanliness should
be there.

00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:15.581
For Indians we should not tell this because
they lack that completely.

00:54:15.581 --> 00:54:18.490
They are the other extreme, “Raste me chalet
chalet jaha deko thook dhena ka."

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:20.990
Of course.

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:26.490
But another extreme also is not good that
all the time the divorces are taking place

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:33.950
because of cleanliness so fussy that you can’t
live together.

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:37.780
You develop a sort of a mania or sort of … You
become abnormal people.

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:41.460
You suffer from the sickness of cleanliness
morning till evening.

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.269
Afraid, “This is to be done, otherwise it
will be dirty."

00:54:44.269 --> 00:54:47.819
You think ten steps forward march that the
place should not be dirty.

00:54:47.819 --> 00:54:50.810
Of course it should not be dirty, is a simple
thing.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:55.730
But it should not be that much worked out
that the home becomes a hospital.

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.510
Home is a home.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.180
Children must feel it’s a home.

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.849
Let them play, let them spoil.

00:55:02.849 --> 00:55:06.430
In London you’ll be surprised my husband’s
secretary told Me that, “My children were

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:07.710
coming, that aren’t You worried?”

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:08.710
I said, “Why?”

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:10.970
She said, “Your house will be all spoiled."

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:11.970
I said, “What?

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:16.440
My children are coming, My grand-children
are coming, I’m looking forward for everything

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.609
that I can do for them.

00:55:17.609 --> 00:55:20.260
How did it come into your head that My house
will be spoiled?”

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.260
It can be cleaned.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:26.510
You have so many ways of cleaning the house.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.369
So the house should be cozy and comfortable.

00:55:28.369 --> 00:55:36.070
And such a person who is rich is not a lakshmipathi.

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:51.010
But a lakshmipathi is a rich person, he receives
people with a big heart.

00:55:51.010 --> 00:56:00.650
So the coziness of the lotus should be in
that lakshmi.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:10.400
In another hand, in the two other hands, one
hand has this symbol like this, another is

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.279
like this.

00:56:12.279 --> 00:56:16.839
This suggests that such a man must do “dhan”
[altruism].

00:56:16.839 --> 00:56:21.510
Now, in English I don’t know what is the
word for ‘dhana’ because nothing is that

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:22.510
dignified.

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.079
‘Dhan’ means ‘giving alms’.

00:56:24.079 --> 00:56:26.970
But it is not dignified word.

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:35.980
Gavin, what word will you say for ‘dhan’,
tell Me in English?

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:43.410
‘Charity’ is also little bit, you see,
‘to be charitable’ means you see, you

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:48.550
are higher than the person whom you charity.

00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:52.190
‘Offering’ if you say then it’s a different
meaning in.

00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:56.450
But, I would say ‘dhan’ means ‘by which
sharing is expressed’, ‘sharing’.

00:56:56.450 --> 00:57:00.640
‘Generosity’, you think it’s nearest.

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.780
All right.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:03.849
‘Generosity’.

00:57:03.849 --> 00:57:08.819
But ‘generosity’, you can say at the most
‘generosity’.

00:57:08.819 --> 00:57:12.920
But ‘giving your generosity’ you can say.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:26.279
And by this is ashraya, means there should
be people depending on such a person.

00:57:26.279 --> 00:57:35.980
So, you have to be an enlightened person,
so that people should depend on you.

00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:39.619
A rich man has to be a dignified person.

00:57:39.619 --> 00:57:41.170
But normally it is not.

00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:47.800
A rich man first of all he will start dressing
up like a teenager.

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.670
He might be the age of sixty years.

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:52.880
You find many like that.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:58.849
Immediately all his dignity is fallen off,
as soon as [he becomes?].

00:57:58.849 --> 00:58:02.329
Then he must go to races, he must take to
drinks, he must be found on the street, some

00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:08.059
policeman must… and it must appear in the
paper.

00:58:08.059 --> 00:58:15.170
Now, I’ve seen some also horrid things about
women who are rich.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:18.369
I must say that this happened in England.

00:58:18.369 --> 00:58:19.369
But it’s funny, for you people it will be
funny, but it’s common there.

00:58:19.369 --> 00:58:26.730
A ninety year old woman, rich woman, ninety
year old rich woman having a love affair with

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:29.079
a nineteen year old boy.

00:58:29.079 --> 00:58:31.260
She’s a rich woman, you see.

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.750
I mean, I do not know what to call this stupidity.

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:40.200
They aren’t rich in India, God save.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:44.640
No enlightenment of any kind they have.

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:53.850
If they had there would have been no problems
at all.

00:58:53.850 --> 00:59:01.882
So, this is a symbol of Lakshmi at this stage.

00:59:01.882 --> 00:59:07.500
The sustaining power is the Lakshmi.

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:11.040
The sustenance, what should be the dharma
and all that.

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.730
Now I find if I discuss it will be too much.

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:17.849
But I told you for example drinking goes against
the dharma of life.

00:59:17.849 --> 00:59:27.030
It goes against the dharma of man because
it goes against the awareness of man.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:31.750
If you loose your awareness how are you going
to rise to a higher awareness?

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:39.220
Now, people know by drinking these things
happen but they will say, “What does it

00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:43.210
matter, Mataji, if we drink a little bit for
our society?”

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:48.400
And what does it matter if I take a little
poison?

00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.369
You’ll get used to it.

00:59:50.369 --> 00:59:53.200
Gradually you’ll start taking poison.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:59.790
There are so many people, in this country
specially, if they take a little of tobacco

00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:03.960
they feel giddy and fall on the ground, this
tobacco.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.640
There must be some in you also.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.109
They cannot even look at tobacco.

01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:08.109
There must be some.

01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:14.920
But there are some who can take tons, tons
inside their being.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.529
How is it?

01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:19.579
Both are human beings.

01:00:19.579 --> 01:00:27.119
So, by little and little, those countries
who have accepted this as a social thing have

01:00:27.119 --> 01:00:28.119
done the greatest harm to themselves.

01:00:28.119 --> 01:00:32.740
Because in the beginning they were taking
only little, little.

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.349
That was I should say about 100 years back,
you can say about 200 years back.

01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:38.859
But today if you go and see them, they are
alcoholic.

01:00:38.859 --> 01:00:41.000
They can’t live without.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:56.599
So the pioneers were the little ones and the
sufferers are those now who are fed up with

01:00:56.599 --> 01:00:57.599
alcohols.

01:00:57.599 --> 01:01:01.300
Because they think it doesn’t mean intoxicate,
so they have taken to drugs also.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:06.710
And they think it is another experiment.

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:13.910
So you have more police force, you do all
kinds of things to control it.

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.220
It’s not possible.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:21.480
Mohamed Sahib has clearly said, “No intoxications.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.059
Nothing, nothing at all."

01:01:25.059 --> 01:01:29.539
Nanak has said the same.

01:01:29.539 --> 01:01:32.470
They are both the same people you’ll be
surprised.

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:37.180
Same people born at different times, same
people teaching the same thing.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:42.880
Nanak said the same thing, “No smoking,
nothing."

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.359
But today there are no Sikhs.

01:01:46.359 --> 01:01:50.349
In the morning they were, Sikhs are fighting
in London that, “We should not wear the

01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:51.349
helmet."

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:52.349
Imagine.

01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:53.349
Where is it written?

01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:58.329
In which book Nanak Sahib has written this,
“I would like to see, that helmet."

01:01:58.329 --> 01:02:01.720
On the contrary He said, “Vesh ka kya payda
ka”, “What is the use of changing your

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:02.720
dress?”

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.861
And they are fighting on this point.

01:02:04.861 --> 01:02:10.670
But the way the Sikhs drink in London, I mean
the British are ashamed.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:22.609
I mean they think they are no good compared
to Sikhs, the way they can consume.

01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:24.220
And they are fighting in the name of religion.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:31.410
Is a fact I’m telling you that the helmet
they cannot wear because they must have a

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:37.220
right and freedom to crack their heads on
a scooter.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.220
What is this?

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:48.160
And there is a big procession every, I think
every Sunday they take it out “against protecting."

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.470
My head off to all these people.

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:52.900
That is what they have done out of Nanak Sahib.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:57.589
And the Muslims, think of them, they have
written poetry on drinking.

01:02:57.589 --> 01:03:06.359
Now, if I say you don’t have to drink, they
will think this lady is talking some of about

01:03:06.359 --> 01:03:07.460
ten thousand years back.

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:14.960
But is a fact I’m telling you, it is not
meant for human consumption at all, none of

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960
these.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.839
Now they might say that Christ was drinking
wine.

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:23.920
Now, ‘wine’ never means ‘alcohol’.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:28.160
I mean grape juice which is fresh, which is
unfermented is different.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:36.519
But the fermented, even molasses, anything
you can ferment, it becomes an alcohol, which

01:03:36.519 --> 01:03:37.519
is satanic.

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:44.240
Is a process only to be used for polishing
things.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:53.029
You are drinking the polish and all your intestines
all are polished off nicely.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:56.920
And your liver is ruined.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.289
And then you come to Mataji, “Mataji, our
liver is ruined.

01:03:59.289 --> 01:04:00.289
Now what to do?

01:04:00.289 --> 01:04:02.190
How to cure it?”

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:05.799
Now, if I tell you, “Don’t drink.

01:04:05.799 --> 01:04:06.810
It’s very bad."

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.880
But these days there are gurus like that you
know, they say, “You drink.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.309
Do whatever you like.

01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:14.890
Only thing, give your purse please behind
me.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:17.070
You can do whatever thing, can even smuggle”,
you see.

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:19.450
There was a guru who was teaching smuggling,
actually smuggling to people.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:22.960
And all the Sehasas [Sikhs] were caught in
Jakarta when they were smuggling.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.799
They lost billions and billions of dollars
there.

01:04:25.799 --> 01:04:28.650
And when I went to Singapore they came to
Me, “This has happened."

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:31.100
I said, “Now where is your guru?”

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.859
“She has gone to Switzerland."

01:04:32.859 --> 01:04:33.859
I said, “Very nice."

01:04:33.859 --> 01:04:34.859
He said, “You do whatever you like.

01:04:34.859 --> 01:04:35.859
Bring the purse here, that’s all.

01:04:35.859 --> 01:04:37.779
If you cannot look after your wife and children
leave them here also.

01:04:37.779 --> 01:04:43.390
You sacrifice everything in the name of God
and give everything to me, very nicely.

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:44.619
You sacrifice."

01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:47.559
They are many who will support it.

01:04:47.559 --> 01:04:50.420
They are not gurus.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.970
If I tell you they are rakshasas, they are
demons.

01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:56.720
Otherwise nobody can do like this.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.460
These are demonic things.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.420
They are not afraid of anything.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:04.640
They have no conscience.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.890
Those who have no conscience are devils, are
devils.

01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:13.760
They are not afraid of God and they are doing
everything in the name of God.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.010
Tomorrow they have to face God.

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:16.010
No doubt.

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:17.630
But you will have to also face.

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:24.450
And when God will ask you, “What have you
been doing?,” then you’ll find that you

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:25.450
have no answer.

01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:28.130
You’ll say, “I have kept a guru there.

01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:29.790
I was paying money to him.

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:30.790
I was looking after him.

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:31.790
He did this much."

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:32.790
He says, “What about your Kundalini?

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:33.880
What about your awakening?

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.880
What about your Realization?”

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.760
You say, “That I don’t know.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:39.940
I have kept one guru, you see, and I was paying
him."

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.190
He said, “All right, where the guru has
gone, you also go there."

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:48.569
And you’ll find the guru settled down very
nicely among the worms in the hell, in the

01:05:48.569 --> 01:05:50.170
deepest forest of hell.

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:53.460
Take it from Me.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:57.279
There is no need even for these people to
die.

01:05:57.279 --> 01:06:00.779
They will face it in this life time.

01:06:00.779 --> 01:06:02.970
All such people have faced.

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:06.160
You have seen what has been the condition
of gurus.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:13.470
So this is the center part of void which has
to look after.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:18.140
And another center that you find there is
the center known as Swadishthan Chakra which

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:24.869
creates, which is a creative power within
us.

01:06:24.869 --> 01:06:32.769
By this center we think, we plan, and also
our bodies cater to.

01:06:32.769 --> 01:06:38.990
Now, other day only I discovered that doctors
do not know what is the reason for diabetes.

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:40.329
I’m surprised.

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:42.180
I’ll tell them.

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.180
You can verify.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.839
It’s very easy.

01:06:44.839 --> 01:06:48.660
This is the center which does two things:
it thinks, plans.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:52.480
You know in Delhi everybody’s Swadishtan
Chakra is caught.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
Why?

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.809
Because too much of planning is going on here.

01:06:55.809 --> 01:06:58.040
Everybody’s planning like mad.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:04.160
But there has to be certain balance between
your thinking and between your emotions.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.690
You must have also a little balance.

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:09.670
I don’t know whether doctors think of the
balance of the emotions with this.

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:11.140
They do not.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.140
So the diabetes is caused because of this
imbalance.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:20.279
You are all the time using this center for
too much thinking, too much planning.

01:07:20.279 --> 01:07:31.380
But the same center looks after the upper
part of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and also

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:36.519
the uterus, and also the thinking.

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:43.380
So if you are thinking too much you are using
the energy on one side, and there is no way

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.450
of filling the petrol back.

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:49.279
Then what happens that your spleen suffers.

01:07:49.279 --> 01:07:57.710
It doesn’t get the energy, and you get the
disease known as diabetes which is only known

01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:00.640
to the people who think too much.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.359
Is not known to the poor people.

01:08:02.359 --> 01:08:03.740
They eat such a lot of sugar.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.160
They don’t have to stop sugar.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:10.270
They eat such a lot of carbohydrates and such
a lot of sugar, especially sugar but they

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:14.329
do not get diabetes because they do not think
too much.

01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:17.549
Now thinking has become like a disease with
people.

01:08:17.549 --> 01:08:19.640
They cannot stop it also.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.900
It goes like a horn in their head I tell you.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.340
All the time thinking, thinking, thinking,
they go mad and they say, “How to stop it?”

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:32.440
It can only be stopped when the Kundalini
rises above this: you go beyond thought.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:41.890
And the thinking creates within us on the
left-hand side of the brain through the Pingala

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:47.750
Nadi, through the right side channel, it creates
the ego.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:54.200
Is the ego.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.530
All thinking is done through ego.

01:08:57.530 --> 01:09:02.390
Those which are developed countries have worked
out their developing through their ego.

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:10.820
So, the ego developed so much in that country
that they got fed up of it.

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.640
So what has happened?

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.820
As a reaction the other side of it started
growing.

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:27.220
The younger people there started taking to
drugs, taking to sedatives, which created

01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:29.490
in them the superego.

01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:32.350
The ego gave … Douglas is laughing.

01:09:32.350 --> 01:09:33.980
Is a fact.

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.290
He knows.

01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:43.840
He’s done it and he has crossed it, and
he has overcome it and he has won it.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.220
So he’s laughing.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:50.380
And the superego has risen now to push back
the ego.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:54.360
For a Westerner always they say, “Oh.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.060
I’m so bad.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.770
I’m no good.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:00.040
I’m good for nothing."

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.250
Is not humility, is the superego.

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:06.520
Is the superego that is acting.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:11.080
While in India the ego is rising.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:15.080
Be careful.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.290
You have to be in balance with ego and superego.

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:18.330
If it is in the center then only I can raise
the Kundalini.

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:24.410
If there is an imbalance, I have to remove
the imbalance.

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:30.750
And it is removed.

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:39.910
The center known as the Swadishthan Chakra,
which also controls the aortic plexus outside,

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:48.870
is governed by a deity which we know very
well, is Brahmadeva and His power is Saraswati.

01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:52.700
He has incarnated only once on this earth
and you’ll be surprised if I tell you who

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.310
was that – is Hazrat Ali.

01:10:54.310 --> 01:11:00.040
He was the son-in-law of Mohammed Sahib.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:09.380
Mohammed Sahib is the incarnation of the primordial
master or the Adi Guru who incarnated in the

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:10.850
Void, in the Bhavasagara.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.220
And He’s the same as Nanak.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.050
But if I tell this to Muslims, they’ll kill
Me, or the Sikhs will kill Me.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:18.050
One of the two.

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:20.250
I don’t know who will come first.

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:33.230
I don’t think this time they are going to
crucify but they are not going to like it.

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:34.420
They are the same people.

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:37.660
There are ten of them born like that.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.110
They are the same people born again and again.

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:50.300
And they are the people, if you accept them,
in only one incarnation.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.810
They are not going to accept it.

01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:56.060
You have to accept them in all their incarnations.

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.800
I’ll give an example.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:04.570
There was a doctor who was suffering from
the cancer of stomach, Muslim.

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:16.630
He met Me in London and when I told him that,
“You have to worship Dattatreya”, he got

01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:17.850
a shock of his life.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:21.750
He said, “You mean to say I must give up
my religion?”

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:24.030
I said, “Your religion is in imbalance.

01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:27.170
He was the same as Mohammed Sahib.

01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:29.560
Actually Dattatreya incarnated as Mohammed
Sahib."

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.950
He said, “I cannot do that.

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:33.360
I only believe in Mohammed Sahib."

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.020
I said, “All right, I cannot cure your cancer
because cancer is because of imbalance.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.150
It’s too much activity on one side."

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:41.680
Over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system
causes cancer.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.510
You write it down today and you can verify
it.

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:48.020
And that’s why when people say I’ve cured
cancer, I have.

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.020
No doubt.

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:53.500
Not only Me but even this doctor who is here
he has cured cancer.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:57.380
Cancer is only curable through the balance
of Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.310
Otherwise it’s not possible.

01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:00.310
Take it from Me.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:08.560
So the imbalance of this man, he would not
listen but cancer is a great thing that way.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.660
He had to come back, “All right Mother,
I accept."

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.170
I said, “All right.

01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:15.621
Now will you pray to Dattatreya?”

01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:19.040
A Muslim has to become a Hindu and a Hindu
has to become a Muslim.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:28.460
A Sikh has to become a Muslim and a Muslim
has to become a Sikh.

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:34.860
How can you divide God into so many ways?

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:39.940
This division is like the atom being split.

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:41.290
You are splitting.

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:46.250
You are finding all ways and methods of splitting
each other.

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:56.170
And what you are gathering is the volcanic
force of destruction within yourself.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:14:05.140
So, the so-called drunkards who call themselves
Muslims and the so-called drunkards the Sikhs

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:11.260
must know that they are very far away from
the gurus whom they worship as their leader.

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:18.050
And as Christ said, “You’ll be calling
Me ‘Christ, Christ’ and I won’t recognize

01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:21.100
who you are”, it’s going to be that.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:31.170
For cancer you have to have balance of understanding
the complete integrated form of God which

01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:41.010
has come on this earth, incarnated as different
flowers on the same one tree of life, which

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.660
has been at different levels.

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:49.470
Like in a tree you have sometimes, first you
have leaves, then you have the flowers, then

01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:51.390
you have the fruits.

01:14:51.390 --> 01:15:01.490
But these are the flowers of the same tree,
have been taken away by different people,

01:15:01.490 --> 01:15:06.410
just to create problem of dead flowers.

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:10.750
They are living on the same living tree of
life.

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:20.530
So, I have told you already about one chakra
that is Mooladhara Chakra, the Mooladhara

01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:21.890
where the Kundalini resides.

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:26.430
Then about the Nabhi Chakra from where it
rises to Swadishtana Chakra which moves round

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:28.800
and round and creates the Bhavasagra.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:36.200
I’ve also told you about the Spirit, the
flicker of light that exists in the Heart,

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:41.260
which is looked after by Shiva.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:47.600
The flicker of light which is the Sakshi,
which is the Witness, it is like a flicker

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.560
that you find in a gas light.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.210
Now the gas itself is not enlightened.

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:58.520
The gas itself is the energy but is not enlightened.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.010
The flicker is enlightened.

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:05.160
When the gas passes over to the flicker it
also gets enlightened.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.410
That is what is Sahaja Yoga is.

01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:11.160
That is what is the Kundalini awakening when
it touches that flicker.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:18.140
But the flicker has got the seat on top of
the head here, which is known as the seat

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.140
of the Sadashiva.

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:26.920
And this is the form or aspect of God which
is existence is.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.380
God Shiva is existence.

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:35.480
And this is the first form which emerges into
all these forms, like the seed emerges into

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:41.420
the whole tree and becomes the seed, and ultimately
at the dissolution point also, it becomes

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:42.420
Shiva.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:44.800
That is why it is known as Shiva, means the
permanent form.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.770
It doesn’t go into any formations.

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.400
It doesn’t incarnate.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.660
It is a witness which watches.

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:57.660
That’s the aspect of God.

01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:00.830
So, you have got three aspects of God.

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:08.160
The first one which is the Shiva, which is
the existence, the second one which is the

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:17.310
creator, which is Brahmadeva and the third
one which is Vishnu, which is the sustenance,

01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:26.710
which evolves, which gives evolutionary movement,
which incarnates, which has incarnated ten

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:28.100
times.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:39.520
Now the chakra above that, you see, in the
center, which we call as Sacred Heart, is

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:49.850
in the center, is known as the cardiac center,
you can say “Hridaya Chakra."

01:17:49.850 --> 01:18:00.470
You all know what is Hridaya, Hridaya Chakra,
is placed here, behind, in the medulla oblongata,

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:04.310
but outside also is the cardiac plexus.

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:15.140
Now this center, the cardiac center, is governed
by the deity Jagadamba, the Mother of the

01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.140
Universe.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:33.160
Parvati, wife of Shiva, the power of Shiva
takes Her place here, to help these struggling

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:39.600
evolutionary human beings who are trying to
evolve themselves, to protect them from the

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.370
satanic, from the demonic forces.

01:18:45.370 --> 01:18:49.980
She’s known as Lalita.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.380
She’s known by many names.

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:55.260
They say She has been incarnated 108 times.

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:57.580
She has been incarnated many a times.

01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:06.100
She has incarnated as an Amsha [from Amshavatarana,
partial incarnation] also, as a part of Her

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.240
has also being incarnated.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:12.050
She is the essence of raksha, is the protection.

01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:23.880
A person who suffers from insecurity gets
this throbbing here, he gets disturbed.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:32.900
People who suffer from fear have this problem
here.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.770
She gives us the protection.

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.050
She’s the protector.

01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:47.310
And She’s the Mother of this world, Jagadamba.

01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:55.330
On the right-hand side of the heart exists,
left-hand side I’ve already told you, right-hand

01:19:55.330 --> 01:20:04.320
side exist the symbol of Shri Rama, and His
power is Sita.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:15.700
Shri Rama at an evolutionary stage, came as
a leader on this earth, as an incarnation

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:20.000
of Vishnu, 8th incarnation.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:38.350
And He tried to show the political leadership
of a divine nature.

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:43.760
He incarnated on this earth twelve thousand
years back.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.890
And at that time in the whole awareness of
human beings the idea of a leader, as a political

01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:50.870
leader, was born.

01:20:50.870 --> 01:21:04.390
He’s responsible for creating the political
awakening within us, twelve thousand years

01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:07.480
back, in the human awareness.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:13.680
His power was Sita, His wife, who was a very
simple woman.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:17.270
But She was the form of Adi Shakti.

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:23.400
We know She was because at that time the people
were very sensitive, they could see that.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.900
These days people are not.

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:28.630
They cannot make out a Ravana from Sita.

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:35.020
See that is what is the condition of our sensitivity.

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:42.950
This is the central force, is known as the
force of Mahalakshmi.

01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:49.290
So, the Lakshmi is born as Sita for the first
time as a human being.

01:21:49.290 --> 01:22:16.510
On the left-hand side force is known as the
force

01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:18.540
of Mahakali.

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:37.490
[Shri Mataji talks to an Indian lady]

01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:47.210
So, the left-hand side power is known as Mahakali’s
power, and the right-hand side known as the

01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:48.750
Mahasaraswati’s power.

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:53.190
Now, the central power is for evolution.

01:22:53.190 --> 01:23:00.590
The central power, or you can say the central
ascending column is meant for the evolution

01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:01.870
of man.

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:06.760
So you are born all of us in the Bhavasagara
state.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:13.620
Now you have to ascend from one to another,
to another, to another.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:19.750
The higher one than that is as I told you,
on the right-hand side is that of Shri Rama

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:24.570
and His power is Sita.

01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:34.660
The complete form of Vishnu came to human
beings six thousand years back as Shri Krishna.

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:39.940
That is at this chakra known as Vishuddhi
Chakra.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:44.880
Shri Krishna is the complete form.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.900
Why we say the complete?

01:23:47.900 --> 01:24:03.710
Because for Him the whole play, the whole
leela was to be just seen, this whole creation

01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:07.020
was nothing but just a play created.

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:13.220
He had reached that state, and He talked of
it.

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:20.400
He said, “Nainam Chianti shastrani, nainam
dahati pavaka”, “You cannot be killed

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:23.890
by any instrument or by anything."

01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:25.850
And He did samhara.

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:32.240
His greatest quality was that He killed a
many demons on this earth.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.930
Now those who talk of non-violence will say,
“Oh, He was a violent man."

01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:54.320
There is a divine method which has to be employed
to kill those demons.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.450
That was needed and He did kill.

01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:03.130
He was the incarnation of a diplomat.

01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:04.330
What is a diplomat?

01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:14.080
Diplomat is a person who is a sakshi, who
is a witness who plays the divine diplomacy.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:19.780
He played the divine diplomacy, and you are
still in that diplomacy when you read Gita,

01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.340
very much.

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:26.160
I’ll tell you in two sentences how to understand
His diplomacy in Gita, very necessary.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:38.610
He said in the very beginning, at the very
outset that you seek in within yourself.

01:25:38.610 --> 01:25:41.410
He told Arjuna, “You seek in within yourself.

01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:42.740
You have to become a sakshi."

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:50.330
Arjuna being a mediocre, asked Him a question
that, “You are saying that, ‘You must

01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:53.990
seek in within yourself, you should become
a sakshi, a witness’ and here you are telling

01:25:53.990 --> 01:26:02.350
me to go on the war, to kill people, kill
my own brothers, kill my own relation!”

01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:03.910
What He wanted to say that it’s all a play.

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:07.560
But it only becomes a play when you become
that witness, when you are Realized.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.350
That’s what He told him.

01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:14.810
But Arjuna was a mediocre in this respect.

01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:22.520
So He being a Father, He understood.

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:28.040
Like a father who comes out of his hut and
see his son beating the cart, so he tells

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:33.590
him, “You bring the horse in front of the
cart then only the cart will going to move

01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:34.590
on."

01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:36.980
But the child, the son, doesn’t want to
listen to his father.

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:39.550
He says, “No, I am going to beat the cart."

01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:43.890
So, He plays the diplomacy, the Father.

01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:44.890
The Mother does not.

01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:45.890
Mother tells you the fact.

01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:49.980
So, He played the diplomacy there, divine
diplomacy.

01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:57.680
He says, “All right you go on beating but
keep your attention on the horse and you will

01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:58.680
go forward."

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.520
That’s an absurd, absurd thing.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.720
It cannot happen, you know.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.530
He told something absurd.

01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:12.550
So, He says, “All right, do your karmas
but put it at the feet of the Lord."

01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:13.560
You cannot do it.

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.560
It cannot be done.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:18.250
This is something an impossibility because
there is the ego in you.

01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:21.930
If you do any work and if you think, “Oh,
I’m putting everything at the feet of the

01:27:21.930 --> 01:27:23.600
Lord,” you are just deceiving yourself.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.970
This is His diplomacy He played it here.

01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:25.970
You cannot.

01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:31.170
Those who believe in such a thing should know
that it’s a deception.

01:27:31.170 --> 01:27:34.370
It can only happen when you become a hollow
personality.

01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:37.770
For these people now, those who are Realized,
you will see them saying, “It’s going,

01:27:37.770 --> 01:27:38.770
it’s coming."

01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:42.420
They do not say that, “I’m giving, I’m
doing."

01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:46.820
You have to become a hollow thing like this
which just stands and sees and passes through

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:47.820
it.

01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:49.460
The Divine has to flow through you.

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:53.420
And about bhakti, about the devotion, dedication,
is another diplomacy.

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:58.160
You see, His words, you see, nobody sees I’m
surprised.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.300
They have written five hundred books on Gita.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.442
Nobody has seen this simple point that He
has played a diplomacy with you because you

01:28:04.442 --> 01:28:09.820
do not know that you are not beyond ego yet.

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.090
You have to go beyond it to be there.

01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:12.700
(End Part 1)

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:19.180
So, He says about bhakti also, “Pushpam,
palam toyam”, “Whatever you give Me, flower,

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:24.820
this, I will accept but while giving,” – you
know, see the diplomacy, one word He plays

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.420
– “in devotion you must do Ananya Bhakti."

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.240
See the word ‘ananya’.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:34.990
‘Ananya’ means ‘when you are not the
other, when you are united, when you are one

01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.990
with it’.

01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:37.260
When you become one?

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.630
When you are realized!

01:28:38.630 --> 01:28:43.420
Everybody will say, “Oh, yes, yes you must
do bhakti, take Krishna’s name, ‘Hare

01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.360
Rama, Hare Krishna’, develop a cancer of
the throat."

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:47.940
Yes, they do, all of them, I tell you.

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.520
So many have come to Me for treatment and
I said, “Now what am I to tell them?”

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.230
Because “Hare Rama, Hare Krishna”, you’ll
get to God?

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:58.560
Very easy method, you know.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:12.690
You go on jumping on the Oxford Street, you
dance, wear a dhoti which is falling off,

01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:13.690
you get to God?

01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:14.690
(Mother is laughing.)

01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:15.690
What a stupid idea.

01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:16.690
But there are many.

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:17.690
They are now begging in [Gantura?].

01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:18.690
I went there.

01:29:18.690 --> 01:29:19.690
They’ve settled down nicely, “Hare Rama,
Hare Krishna.

01:29:19.690 --> 01:29:20.690
Everybody, they came to Me, “Are You an
Indian?”

01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:21.690
“Yes,” I said, “by chance I am."

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:22.690
“Will you buy this book?

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:23.690
Only give me five annas."

01:29:23.690 --> 01:29:24.690
It’s all right.

01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:25.690
I will not mind five annas.

01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:27.700
I said, “Thank you very much."

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:28.980
And they are near God?

01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:37.190
Begging like poor people, they have no shame,
in the name of God.

01:29:37.190 --> 01:29:45.260
Taking His name and begging!

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:53.800
‘You have to do Ananya Bhakti’ means you
have to be a Realized soul.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:59.500
Now how do you know a person is a Realized
bhakti or not?

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:00.500
Very easy.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:07.290
A person who speaks of separation, like Surdas,
he was not a Realized soul.

01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:12.160
Those who talk of their tortures, “Oh, God,
when are You going to meet me?”

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.390
they are not realized souls.

01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:20.570
But those like Kabir and Nanak, like Christ.

01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:23.160
Christ was an incarnation.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:30.380
But those who talk and sing the praise of
meeting are the people who are realized.

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:35.550
I mean a person who has met God why should
he talk of separation?

01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:36.740
Very simple thing.

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:45.000
But we like the songs of the people who talk
of their – you see, I don’t know what

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.430
you call that – who killed himself, who
started calling himself, “Oh Lord, Oh Lord

01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:53.040
when are you going to meet me?”, broke his
neck there, he broke his head there.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:59.500
What is the need to do all this?

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:03.000
They are fasting.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.690
Why are you fasting?

01:31:05.690 --> 01:31:07.010
I don’t understand.

01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:08.950
Why do you want to make your body weak?

01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:13.920
In this body, the Lord is going to come, and
this body is fasting?

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:22.660
If fasting people have to get God, at least
thirty percent people of this country should

01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.460
get it automatically.

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.450
They are made to fast.

01:31:27.450 --> 01:31:31.050
Some Yogi: [Hindi]
Shri Mataji: Hum?

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:32.050
Dakare?

01:31:32.050 --> 01:31:34.050
Sahaja Yogis: About women?

01:31:34.050 --> 01:31:35.840
Shri Mataji: Women?

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:37.640
“Santoshi Ma” fast?

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:41.070
Any fast, you know, they’ve gone to such
an absurd limit.

01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:43.920
And these Brahmins I will put them responsible.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:49.440
They have given all wrong ideas, absolutely
just opposition.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.440
How?

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:59.001
On a Sankashti, the day when Shri Ganesh is
born in the family, see, imagine, that day

01:31:59.001 --> 01:32:00.390
you must fast!

01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:04.030
Imagine the argument behind it.

01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:05.030
That day!

01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:06.030
You see, supposing somebody is born in your
family.

01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:08.880
I mean you celebrate it, you are so happy.

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:11.800
[Us din kush raho, shok rehana chayiye?]

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.960
Supposing I come to your house and you are
fasting.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:17.290
I run away the next moment.

01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:21.910
[Shir Mataji is laughing]
You see, if you write, “Today we are fasting,”

01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:24.950
nobody’s going to come to your house.

01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:31.960
If you have to share in fasting, you can do,
like “karva chauth”, they share in fasting.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.540
You should fast on only one day, definitely
you must.

01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:34.890
That is Naraka Chaturdeshi.

01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:37.150
That day they will eat.

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:43.720
Because that day Narakasura was killed and
he was put in the “Naraka”, means the

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.720
Hell.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:45.770
He was put down there.

01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:50.590
And the gates of the Hell were opened for
him, and all such people are put on that day

01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:52.030
into the Hell.

01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:56.190
So, that day you should not get up early in
the morning, sleep in your bed.

01:32:56.190 --> 01:33:01.470
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear about calendar]
Shri Mataji: See, with the calendar I don’t

01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:02.800
know who has made.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.480
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear]
Shri Mataji: You see, but we must use our

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:06.480
brains.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.480
What is Naraka Chaturdeshi meant?

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.250
Actually, these must be some rakshasas, must
be some devils who must have created these

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:10.250
calendars for us, some of them.

01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:11.250
That you must fast.

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:13.070
I don’t know who has written such a nonsensical
thing!

01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:18.320
The day when the gates of the Narakas are
opened that day, they will get up at four’o

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.250
clock, take their baths and nicely eat.

01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:29.940
All the rakshasas will be going with the food
inside the stomach, in the Nabhi Chakra.

01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:34.170
The picture has come of- the picture has appeared
of some Santoshi Ma [since 1960, so-called

01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:36.520
goddess worshiped by fasting]: everybody fasting
on Friday.

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:40.840
Then the absurd ideas about “eating food
that makes a difference”.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.389
Also, this has been introduced.

01:33:43.389 --> 01:33:50.140
In Gita also I’m sure there are so many
things which have been brought which are wrong.

01:33:50.140 --> 01:34:02.990
To say that you are born a Brahmin and that
it’s post-natal or pre-natal as they call

01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:04.290
it, prenatal.

01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:05.890
And how can that be?

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:07.040
You just think it over.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.040
Use your brains.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:10.300
I would say you use your brains.

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:20.570
Vyasa, the author of Gita, author of Gita,
Vyasa, whose son was he, do you know?

01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:26.980
He was a son of a fisher woman, illegitimate
son.

01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:31.200
You know all of you, of Parashurmuni.

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:40.220
And he’s going to write that you have to
be born as a brahmin?

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:47.550
Those who think that by being born as brahmins
you become brahmins, I must say are sadly

01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:48.550
mistaken.

01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:58.300
Brahmin means a person who is reborn, who
is a Realized soul, who has known the Brahma.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:03.810
It describes a tendency of a person who is
seeking God, is the brahmin cast [unclear],

01:35:03.810 --> 01:35:05.220
is a tendency.

01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:07.750
How can Vyasa write like this, you just tell
me?

01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:09.110
How can Vyasa write like this?

01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:15.360
Now, this is being put on to his head, just
pinned on to him.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.690
Like the tantrikas.

01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:18.920
Oh, God.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.340
They are the worst of all.

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:25.380
They have spoiled all our scriptures, they’ve
spoiled all our shilpa shastras, they have

01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:26.380
spoiled everything dearly.

01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:30.140
The greatest demons that could be born in
this country were the tantrikas.

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:33.380
They have ruined all the beauties of our scriptures.

01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:36.270
Even our aswameda yagna they connected with
sex.

01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:42.270
I mean there’s a limit to things!

01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:49.790
And that’s why when the people go to Konarak
they think, “Oh, Konarak!

01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:53.260
Most enchanting place in the whole country.

01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:54.730
Nothing more better than that."

01:35:54.730 --> 01:35:55.730
They think, “This Khajuraho!”

01:35:55.730 --> 01:36:01.290
Actually that’s the only aspect which has
spoiled all the beauty of that place.

01:36:01.290 --> 01:36:07.860
If they didn’t have that it would have been
much better.

01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:14.050
Konarak, of course, the architect himself
was a tantrika.

01:36:14.050 --> 01:36:18.590
So, I cannot say anything about such a horrid
fellow he was.

01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:27.210
But here the poor architects were given prizes
by these licentious and permissive kings to

01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:39.840
produce the new styles and new types of these
horrible erotic pictures.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:48.500
There was a competition held and it entered
into our shilpa shastras, into our sculptures.

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:49.860
It has gone up to the South.

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:51.800
And you’ll be amazed in the South there’s
a temple where they have shown a bad relationship

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.010
between Gauri and Ganesha.

01:36:54.010 --> 01:36:55.390
Can you believe it?

01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:59.700
And are we to accept it because it was done
by some foolish ancestors of ours?

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.890
And everybody says, “Why?

01:37:01.890 --> 01:37:03.530
It’s all right.

01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:08.200
In your country also, you see, you have these
things.

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.450
We have seen it, very nice."

01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:17.360
And they have written books on kama shastra,
koka shastra, this, that.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.590
What is the shastra needed for this thing?

01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:21.740
I don’t understand.

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:25.200
Do the animals read any shastras for creating
children?

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:34.420
For a simple thing like that why do you have
to read and make so much deliberations?

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:37.020
Are you gone mad?

01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:40.870
All these artificial things I don’t understand.

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:52.090
For a natural thing, which everyone knows,
why should they go into such things?

01:37:52.090 --> 01:38:03.220
And the result, I’m sorry to say, is seventy
per cent impotency today in America.

01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:10.520
Because all artificiality, the spontaneity
is lost, the sanctity is lost.

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:18.430
All kinds of diseases, every third person
is diseased, every third person.

01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:19.840
You also are following them.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.970
After all the sahabs have gone, but now we
are all becoming all sahabs.

01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:30.520
The sahabs have come from England wearing
our kurta pyjamas and our sahabs are wearing

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:31.580
ties.

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:34.740
(Mother is laughing.)

01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:46.070
Because, you see, somebody told Me that we
used to think,” Where are our lords lost."

01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:51.270
They are in India, “Unse kuch sikne ka nahin
hai.

01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:52.820
Aap jaan lejeye.

01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:55.940
Unse kuch jan-ne ka nahin hai."

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:58.540
Of course dress doesn’t matter.

01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:02.900
Whatever you wear it makes no difference.

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:15.110
But main thing is that to know yourself, to
be yourself.

01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:25.430
Is a very, very subtle happening for this
God has placed all these chakras within us.

01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:30.370
So, the outside does not matter so much, no
doubt.

01:39:30.370 --> 01:39:39.050
But in a way it does, in the sense that when
there is a deeper light, you have to have

01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:44.610
the earthen pot all right, you have to have
the proper amount of oil in it, you have to

01:39:44.610 --> 01:39:48.710
have a wick properly put up, and then only
you can enlighten.

01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:52.380
If these three things are not all right, then
I cannot enlighten you.

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:57.060
So these three things are also important.

01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:02.760
So, your dharma has to be all right.

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:08.060
Of course, I’m not saying that if you are
drinking you cannot get realization.

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:09.060
You can.

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:15.310
And you can also get the power to get over
your habits in no time, because once you get

01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:20.160
realized, you get intoxicated by your Self
only, by your own powers.

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:27.240
You can feel in your hand the power flowing
like vibrations, cool vibrations.

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:32.890
If you use them then you will know that you
can cure people with these.

01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:34.880
After some time you can give awakening of
the Kundalini.

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:38.300
When you will raise your hand the Kundalini
will move in another person.

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:39.300
There are many now.

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:40.670
You have got Subramanyam here.

01:40:40.670 --> 01:40:42.000
He has cured.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.290
Gavin, he’s a government servant just like
you, he has given awakening to so many people,

01:40:47.290 --> 01:40:50.740
he has given realization to so many people.

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:52.900
You can also do it.

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:58.110
The power exists within you which becomes
intelligible or conscious in your central

01:40:58.110 --> 01:41:01.360
nervous system also, and you can feel it flowing.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.550
You can work it out.

01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:09.140
Now, you will know why people have described
in the Kundalini awakening this thing happens,

01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:10.140
that thing happens.

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:13.620
If you go from the wrong side, it is going
to happen.

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.460
You have to be an authorized person.

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:22.300
Tomorrow you put your hand in an electrical
appliance and you said, “There is so many

01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:23.300
problem."

01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:24.300
You should not do it.

01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:27.680
Only the engineer can do it, the authorized
person can do it.

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.410
This is all unauthorized.

01:41:29.410 --> 01:41:36.150
The first and foremost thing is that such
a person has to be a realized person, and

01:41:36.150 --> 01:41:42.970
not only realized, but has to be a holy person.

01:41:42.970 --> 01:41:50.420
Three, four air hostesses are friends of such
and such person, and he is giving Kundalini

01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:51.420
awakening.

01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:57.650
He’s eloped with his wife, he is smuggling
that side, he is smuggling gold from London,

01:41:57.650 --> 01:42:02.450
he’s bringing down by air, and he is giving
Kundalini rising.

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:06.420
There should be some sense in what people
talk.

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:14.760
This is a very holy happening, has to happen
in the holiest way.

01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:21.950
Now, there is another chakra here, where is
My, this red spot is.

01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:23.634
We all put it here but we do not know why
we put it there.

01:42:23.634 --> 01:42:31.210
This is the center which is placed where the
crossing of the optic nerves takes place.

01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:36.360
You can call it the optic thalamus at that
point, at that point it is placed.

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:43.910
And this center controls the pituitary and
pineal glands, which control, pituitary controls

01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:46.650
the ego and the pineal controls the superego.

01:42:46.650 --> 01:42:52.400
For a doctor he knows about the pineal and
the pituitary but he does not go further than

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.510
that to know that it controls your ego and
superego.

01:42:54.510 --> 01:42:57.050
Even if he knows, he does not know how to
control.

01:42:57.050 --> 01:43:01.760
Now, with Sahaja Yoga, you can see that they
are two balloons in your head.

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:03.440
You can see them.

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:11.110
It starts from the Vishuddhi Chakra here,
petal, where Shri Krishna reigns, whose power

01:43:11.110 --> 01:43:12.320
is Radha.

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:18.100
And they rise in our head and move like this.

01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:28.620
There are two balloons which cover up our
head completely about the age of 12 years

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.520
or so, completely.

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:34.920
Calcification is complete at that time though
to feeling it is earlier.

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.700
And that’s how you develop a separate personality.

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:38.700
You are Mr.

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.120
so and so, he’s Mr.

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:41.120
so and so.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:42.120
Is the articulation.

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:48.100
Iit is like a shell of a egg you are made.

01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:52.920
You are made like that because you have to
grow inside, inside the shell of your own

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:53.920
being.

01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.480
You are a separate…

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.350
(Apart)
You are a shell.

01:43:57.350 --> 01:44:02.220
You are a shell, he is a shell.

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:07.840
And you are given the warmth kept there developed.

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:18.550
In the end the egg is broken here, and through
it comes out a new personality, a new person

01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:25.280
within which is a very different person from
the one which was before.

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.740
This is Sahaja Yoga.

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:40.760
So, that center which is here placed at the
crossing point of the optic nerves is known

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:46.940
as the Agnya Chakra, and the deity placed
there is Mahavishnu.

01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:58.490
I don’t know how far people have read about
Devi or Devi Mahatmya or Markandeya or even

01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:59.510
Adi Shankaracharya.

01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:06.060
Now, Mahavishnu is a creation of Radhaji,
is the son of Radha.

01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:15.520
She had created Him out of Shri Ganesha’s
essence and in a special way.

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:22.450
And this child was created in the Vaikuntha
stage, in the heaven we can say, and He incarnated

01:45:22.450 --> 01:45:25.740
on this earth as Jesus Christ.

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:31.130
Lord Jesus Christ was not a human being.

01:45:31.130 --> 01:45:35.440
He took a form but His body was completely
chaitanya.

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:44.720
He’s a complete, His body also was completely
divine, specially created by His Mother who

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.960
was Mary.

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:49.670
But actually She was Radha Herself.

01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:54.840
Sita be-came Radha and then She became Christ’s
Mother.

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.340
She is Adi Shakti.

01:45:57.340 --> 01:46:02.790
Mary is not an ordinary woman, She is Radha
Herself.

01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:10.130
And if you read about Mahavishnu’s birth
you will know that exactly the same is Christ.

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:14.430
The name is Mahavishnu and here it is Christ.

01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:17.150
Now, Jesus Christ see.

01:46:17.150 --> 01:46:27.000
Jesus, Jesu or Yeshu, this is the name of
Yeshoda, was given by Radha to Her son.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.170
We say Jesu or Yeshu.

01:46:30.170 --> 01:46:33.350
And ‘Christ’ is His surname.

01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:36.500
Krishna’s name came from the word ‘krishi’.

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:40.950
‘Krishi’ means ‘agriculture’, is the
man who has sown the seed.

01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:49.310
Krishna came and He has sown the seed of that
awareness by which you can become the sakshi

01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:54.310
of this play, the witness of this play.

01:46:54.310 --> 01:47:01.210
And Christ’s name is ‘krist’, is the
same as Krishna’s name.

01:47:01.210 --> 01:47:05.240
When He talks of His father, He talks of Shri
Krishna.

01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:07.400
Shri Krishna was His father.

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.810
Then He describes Him, all the time of His
father, it is Shri Krishna.

01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:17.560
And in the Vaikuntha state it is described
very clearly how Shri Krishna Himself came

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:23.900
to bless Him and told Him that, “You will
be placed even higher than Me because Your

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:28.880
body will be made out of chaitanya."

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:33.330
What is the English word for ‘chaitanya’?

01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:34.520
Of consciousness?

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.510
But consciousness cannot be chaitanya.

01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:38.700
Divine awareness.

01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:40.440
Of the divine awareness, you can say.

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.910
The divine awareness itself, the divine vibrations
are shown in us.

01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:47.090
In the same way, He’s made out of that like
Shri Ganesha is.

01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:52.130
Now if He’s so or not, because most of you
are Indians here, you might challenge it.

01:47:52.130 --> 01:47:53.130
You may.

01:47:53.130 --> 01:48:05.740
I can prove it to you because is the same
swastika.

01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:17.190
The ayurdas or the weapons of Shri Ganesha
have become “avyakt”, are not expressed,

01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:25.340
because He used one weapon for all of them,
is of forgiveness.

01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:29.760
And that is the greatest weapon of all, and
that’s why at this stage when the Kundalini

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:33.690
goes, you have to take His name or you have
to forgive people.

01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:38.480
Forgiveness is the greatest weapon that God
has given us.

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.830
Now, it is for you to verify whether I say
is correct or not.

01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:50.190
But crucifixion is not the message.

01:48:50.190 --> 01:49:04.260
Crucifixion is the explanation of what Krishna
preached that the chaitanya, the divine awareness

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:09.420
does not vanish, does not.

01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:14.390
It is akshaya, it does not get killed.

01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:16.700
You cannot control it.

01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:23.680
And this was to be proved in His life through
His resurrection.

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:26.920
The resurrection is the message of Christ.

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:31.395
But as in India you have done all the mess
of all these incarnations, they have done

01:49:31.395 --> 01:49:37.640
the mess of Christ in two ways.

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:40.940
One, by not respecting the celibacy of life.

01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:42.990
He was a celibate person.

01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:44.820
He was a holy person.

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:47.480
Of course He respected the marriage institution
because He attended the marriage.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:55.970
You have crucified Him again.

01:49:55.970 --> 01:50:10.730
And secondly which is His power of forgiveness,
complete power of forgiveness.

01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:15.650
But they had empires.

01:50:15.650 --> 01:50:26.280
They now want to have the economic controlling
power and all kinds of these things they are

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:32.460
doing under the name of political, I don’t
know what they call it.

01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:43.270
They have to be Christians, all that was against
Him is now done today.

01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:46.360
As we Indians have done all that what was
against Hinduism.

01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:53.780
When Shankaracharya himself has told, “Na
Yogena Sankena”, still we are having Hatha

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.780
Yoga.

01:50:54.780 --> 01:50:55.970
Now we are going to have Hatha Yoga in the
college.

01:50:55.970 --> 01:51:01.700
Patanjal Shastra, himself Patanjali has said
not to have Hatha Yoga for the married people,

01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:02.850
for the householders.

01:51:02.850 --> 01:51:07.190
It is meant for very few who go to the jungles,
stay with their gurus.

01:51:07.190 --> 01:51:11.290
Every tikalpa, every person is having here
Hatha Yoga.

01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:14.910
Now, this boy today he was suffering because
of Hatha Yoga.

01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:16.550
Of course, I’ve stopped it.

01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:17.550
But still.

01:51:17.550 --> 01:51:18.980
You’ll have heart troubles, you’ll have
everything.

01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:22.180
Now you teach your students here in the … And
let them to have sex also.

01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:26.530
In the West very nice, Hatha Yoga is very
good because everybody wants to become an

01:51:26.530 --> 01:51:27.530
actress.

01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:32.730
Hatha Yoga is not meant for us, for the householders.

01:51:32.730 --> 01:51:35.950
It is meant for these standing-on-the-heads
type.

01:51:35.950 --> 01:51:40.090
Let them go and break their necks there.

01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:41.700
One will get after thousands of years.

01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:44.590
It has been said by many, those who are realized.

01:51:44.590 --> 01:51:45.920
Now, I know them.

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:48.490
They are sitting on the hills.

01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:52.000
They have told My disciples also that, “We
have taken thousands of years to get this

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.750
and Mataji is just giving you like that."

01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:57.810
It is!

01:51:57.810 --> 01:52:08.090
In the same way so called Christians have
done all that was necessary to kill the image

01:52:08.090 --> 01:52:09.920
of Christ.

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:18.610
It’s rather surprising but I think the opposites
are attracted.

01:52:18.610 --> 01:52:24.840
The drunkards will become the disciples of
Mohamed Sahib, all the licentious will become

01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:32.290
the disciples of Christ and all the, that
we call in Sanskrit ‘Dravidic Pranay Pranayn’,

01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:33.800
will become the Hindus.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.540
That’s how it is.

01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:37.090
Just the opposite.

01:52:37.090 --> 01:52:49.640
The last is the center of Sahasrara with one
thousand petals, is the limbic area which

01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:55.040
is surrounded by one thousand petals of [inaudible].

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:58.470
In the Bible it is said, “I will appear
before you like tongues of flames."

01:52:58.470 --> 01:53:02.840
It is like tongues of flames, living tongues
of blue flames and white flames and crystal

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.470
flames, and they are very silent flames.

01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:08.710
You can see that.

01:53:08.710 --> 01:53:13.590
Some of you have seen it.

01:53:13.590 --> 01:53:16.080
And they are like the – they act on our
nerves.

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:18.570
Now the doctors will argue that there are
982 nerves.

01:53:18.570 --> 01:53:23.300
Yes, there was argument on that also, 982
nerves, and eight motor nerves and these nerves,

01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:25.910
and all of them do not become one thousand.

01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:27.460
I mean that’s not the thing.

01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:29.360
I’ve not counted them.

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:32.480
One thousand they are, no doubt.

01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:45.820
So, these one thousand petals are the one
thousand hands, imagine, in your brain.

01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:56.860
And this is the Kingdom of God inside which
is the limbic area.

01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:03.330
When ‘you’ cross this door of Agnya, you
enter into that and this is ruled by the Adi

01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:09.070
Shakti, by the Primordial Mother, and She
opens it out.

01:54:09.070 --> 01:54:14.490
She does it, it is Her job.

01:54:14.490 --> 01:54:23.420
At the end of it, is the gate or the hole
known as the Brahmarandra on top here which

01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:30.800
presses the ego and the superego on both the
sides and takes your attention into that all

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:38.610
pervading Power which is all pervading.

01:54:38.610 --> 01:54:43.890
When the Kundalini crosses the Agnya, you
become thoughtlessly aware.

01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:50.920
Thoughtlessly aware means you are aware but
there is no thought, you become silent.

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:56.650
When It crosses the Brahmarandra then the
vibrations start flowing through you and you

01:54:56.650 --> 01:54:57.650
get cool vibrations.

01:54:57.650 --> 01:55:00.420
This morning about five, six people got it.

01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:03.490
Of course, we have many here who are Realized
people.

01:55:03.490 --> 01:55:09.380
All these people who have come from the West
are Realized people.

01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:11.560
And they have experimented and they know all
about it.

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:15.250
And there are many others who have come from
Bombay and those from Delhi also, we have

01:55:15.250 --> 01:55:19.290
many who are Realized, who have those vibrations
flowing through them.

01:55:19.290 --> 01:55:22.130
It happens.

01:55:22.130 --> 01:55:23.890
It has to happen to you all.

01:55:23.890 --> 01:55:27.730
You all should get it.

01:55:27.730 --> 01:55:28.730
Then what happens?

01:55:28.730 --> 01:55:31.400
By that you become collectively conscious.

01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.690
I said, “You become."

01:55:32.690 --> 01:55:34.610
I did not say that, “You have to become."

01:55:34.610 --> 01:55:35.610
You become.

01:55:35.610 --> 01:55:36.880
You get that awareness.

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:40.630
Immediately you start feeling the vibrations
of other people.

01:55:40.630 --> 01:55:42.970
That little girl, Pragnya, who came here,
she’s a born Realized.

01:55:42.970 --> 01:55:45.400
There are many children who are born Realized.

01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:50.920
My two grand-children in Bombay, they are
grand-daughters, and they are both Self-realized.

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:53.550
The younger one is hardly ten months and she
knows all about Kundalini.

01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:55.980
You ask her, “What is caught?”

01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:57.090
You see, you can feel it on the fingers.

01:55:57.090 --> 01:56:01.400
Now, there’s a book which one of My disciples
has written – I should say My son or My

01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:03.050
child has written – it’s in Marathi.

01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:04.050
So far Hindi?

01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:05.160
[Mai nahin huya aaj tak-?].

01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.740
No, nothing has been done in Hindi.

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:08.770
English also they have published one of My
lectures.

01:56:08.770 --> 01:56:13.650
But, in this Marathi book we have given the
indications on what things you can feel the

01:56:13.650 --> 01:56:14.650
chakras.

01:56:14.650 --> 01:56:20.850
You can feel the centers which are caught
in your fingers here and you can see.

01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:26.130
And that’s how as a by-product you cure
people, that’s how the diagnosis comes through

01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:28.700
and you can feel it.

01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:34.040
It’s tomorrow morning we are going to have
meditation starting exactly at 8.30.

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:37.900
I would request you tonight to go sleep off.

01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:43.380
Early in the morning clean yourself and come
here at 8.30 so that we finish the session

01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:45.300
for you to go to your work.

01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:50.860
8.30 early in the morning you have to come
here, and then the Kundalini rising and everything

01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:51.920
can be done.

01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:55.010
Because people are more interested in the
lecture, what am I to do?

01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:59.690
So, I’m not doing any awakening today because
it’s already very late for you.

01:56:59.690 --> 01:57:05.960
Now if some of you want to have it, I can
work it out.

01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:09.590
(Short dialogue with Sahaja Yogis.)

01:57:09.590 --> 01:57:26.440
Word ‘Realization’ means ‘when you separate
your Self from your gross awareness and become

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:27.440
the subtle being’, is the realization.

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:30.090
That’s the beginning.

01:57:30.090 --> 01:57:35.650
In that first stage, I’m going to tell you
tomorrow evening all about it, how in different

01:57:35.650 --> 01:57:37.430
three stages it works out.

01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:42.270
The first stage is of nirvichar where you
become thoughtlessly aware and collectively

01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:43.990
conscious through your vibrations.

01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:52.160
Then in the second stage you become nirvikalpa
in which you start giving realization to others.

01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:59.570
And the third stage is a complete Self-realization
where you become completely the master of

01:57:59.570 --> 01:58:04.980
Kundalini of others and your own, and you
can work it out and also sitting down here

01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:13.590
you can feel the Kundalini of all the people
all over the world, and also you can control

01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:23.260
many elements and events.
