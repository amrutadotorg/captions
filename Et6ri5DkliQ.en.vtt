00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.407
Now the left side is the centre of the family life,

00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:14.607
the Gruhalaxshmi, the Goddess of the family,

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:16.874
the household you see.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:21.674
A person who runs after money
too much, forgets his family.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.655
He has no time for his family.

00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:27.707
The husband and wife may meet somewhere on the airport

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:31.740
or may just wave at each other
sometimes you see, crossing each other,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.307
or the children suffer the most.

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:37.574
And in that case the women
also then take up with the men,

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:42.640
they compete what's wrong, they start copying men,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.807
and in so doing so, when they compete with each other,

00:00:46.887 --> 00:00:51.007
then what happens, that this family life gets disturbed.

00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:54.206
The woman of the household is dissatisfied,

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.907
her ego is not satisfied.

00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:59.373
In olden times the man used to go in the jungle,

00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:01.907
and get all the wood cut, bring it home,

00:01:01.987 --> 00:01:04.240
and give it to the wife and wife used to cook.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.094
There was no problem because there was barter system.

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:09.173
He could see her working in the household.

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:12.273
Now the husband earns the money and the woman spends.

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:16.707
I mean that also requires some
work, isn't it to spend the money.

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:21.041
But to man it looks like, that I'm the
earning member and she's the spender.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.574
So she said all right, I will also earn.

00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:28.041
But in this too much of competition,
too much of competition like this,

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:31.240
between the two, what happens, the family suffers,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.073
the children suffer and such a
person will have problem with the wife,

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:37.740
the wife will have problem with the husband

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.240
and you can always feel that center
on this finger, if that finger is catching,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.507
that means there's something
wrong with your family relationship,

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:51.041
that you have to adjust yourself, or he has to adjust.

00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:53.574
It's an important thing.

00:01:53.654 --> 00:01:58.273
Because you are like the flowers
which have to produce a fruit.

00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:00.041
That's what nature wants.

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:03.774
Nature wants that you are there to produce the,

00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:07.574
fruit, that is your children.

00:02:07.654 --> 00:02:11.073
That's why you are men and women. That's the basics.

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:17.134
Now this Gruhalaxshmi's centre is on the left-hand side,

00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:20.959
and the another is Raja Laxshmi
centre is on the right-hand side.

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.794
Now this center gives us the power to rule over people

00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:27.460
and we become very,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.794
in extremes you see we can become very arrogant

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:33.859
and we can become very very, sort of authoritative

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.226
and we might, sort of end up with a funeral

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:42.794
with ten thousand people
behind us, all bought from market

00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:46.493
and put there behind you without
any feelings, that's all finished.

00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:53.026
With such a man finished they'll say, oh
thank God he died, he was a horrible terror for us.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:56.427
So, that kind of a life can come with Raja Laxshmi.

00:02:56.507 --> 00:03:00.694
But in the center is the Laxshmi.

00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:04.493
Laxshmi is the Goddess, is the power within us,

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:08.727
by which we balance, lead a very balanced life,

00:03:08.807 --> 00:03:11.193
by which we are satisfied.

00:03:11.273 --> 00:03:13.760
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Laxshmi

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.360
also one should understand this power is a Lady,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.959
is a Mother and She stands on a lotus.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.959
Now these are all symbols which suggest that,

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:29.694
these symbols are carved
out with such deep significance.

00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:34.794
She stands on a lotus. Means
imagine, who can stand on a lotus?

00:03:34.874 --> 00:03:37.926
And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman

00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:39.660
and She stands on a lotus.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.060
It means that, that She is never
putting pressure on anyone.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.026
A rich man comes in, he must honk his car, loudly,

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:53.226
because he's rich so he thinks he must honk it higher,

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:57.360
and a rich man must go in a big limousine

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.360
or some sort of a thing to show off that he's very rich.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.247
If he comes to any program, or any he
must sit in front, he should have the front seat,

00:04:05.327 --> 00:04:10.026
and he makes him known everywhere
everybody must feel the weight of the rich man.

00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:12.593
He can run away with ten wives,

00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:17.527
of somebody and, he can have a big boat for himself,

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:19.493
and he can get any number of women there

00:04:19.573 --> 00:04:23.460
and he can spoil any families
he likes because he's rich.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.160
This kind of thing comes in in people

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.593
but Laxshmi the One who has, stands on the lotus,

00:04:30.673 --> 00:04:34.760
is the beauty and the glory of the riches,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.694
that God has given that person.

00:04:37.774 --> 00:04:42.393
Then, it has got two red, pink flowers in the hand,

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:44.794
that are lotus flowers again.

00:04:44.874 --> 00:04:51.160
Now the lotus is regarded
as a very holy flower in India,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.893
because it is so receptive

00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:58.527
to everything that is crude and funny. First of all

00:04:58.607 --> 00:05:01.327
it is born in the mud.

00:05:01.407 --> 00:05:03.126
Just think of it,

00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:07.627
in the mud, in the filth, where
the horrible smell is coming out,

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:09.660
the lotus is born.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.727
And the one lotus gives the fragrance,

00:05:12.807 --> 00:05:15.126
the beautiful fragrance to the whole atmosphere,

00:05:15.206 --> 00:05:18.060
and kills all that's filth and everything,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.427
and covers the whole pond with its big big leaves

00:05:21.507 --> 00:05:24.993
so that it looks a beautiful pond.

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:27.660
That's what is the lotus for.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.126
But this lotus is a pink lotus, means pink,

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:34.493
you know is the sign of love.

00:05:34.573 --> 00:05:36.126
Pink is the sign of love.

00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:38.926
So such a person has to have tremendous love

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:41.560
and that softness of the lotus.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.393
Now the inside of the lotus is very soft and nice and a,

00:05:45.473 --> 00:05:50.627
I don't know what do you call
that, the bee, the black bee,

00:05:50.707 --> 00:05:54.939
a very big one which has got horrible,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.460
no, the black bee, it's like that,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.060
which has got angular legs and things like that,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.126
horrible, you cannot touch it.

00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:08.660
That one, can find its place in the lotus.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.593
When it goes to the lotus, the lotus opens its petals

00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:13.393
and takes it inside

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.794
and makes it, sleep on the corona

00:06:16.874 --> 00:06:18.959
that it has, very soft one on the bed,

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.627
and covers it nicely and gives it a nice,

00:06:22.707 --> 00:06:25.160
you see, swinging feeling,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.026
that it feels it is in the lap of the mother

00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:29.460
and it sleeps off.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.660
Even such a animal, it gives a place to live.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.560
Now the man who is a laxshmipati

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.794
the one who is blessed with Laxshmi,

00:06:37.874 --> 00:06:40.760
has to have a temperament like that.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.226
Anybody who comes to his house, anyone,

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:47.427
should be very readily accepted.

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.226
I've seen people like that, I've seen in my lifetime,

00:06:50.306 --> 00:06:52.760
should be accepted and they should be very gratified

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.893
to have such people in the
house and should feel that oh God,

00:06:57.973 --> 00:07:00.560
what a blessing it is that we have a guest in the house.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.460
But in modern times, we find out devices and methods,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:11.440
how to avoid guests, guests are equal to pests.

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:15.826
I was in London, we were living on Surrey Hills

00:07:15.906 --> 00:07:18.093
and we had bungalows, separate bungalows,

00:07:18.173 --> 00:07:21.295
quite good bungalows I should
say, there were seven bungalows.

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:24.801
And poor husbands were taken to
tasks for mowing the lawns and everything

00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:29.959
and the wife used to tell them now come
along do it properly and the polishing of the, brass

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:32.593
whatever was there and everything was done very well.

00:07:32.673 --> 00:07:37.226
But I didn't see even a rat
enter those houses, even a rat,

00:07:37.306 --> 00:07:38.893
I mean leave alone human beings.

00:07:38.973 --> 00:07:40.794
Nothing entered those houses,

00:07:40.874 --> 00:07:44.427
only these two persons used to come out and go in.

00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:47.627
And I don't know they might be having some yearly,

00:07:47.707 --> 00:07:49.859
some sort of a get-together, maybe.

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:54.327
But nobody, while My house
was naturally, I am like this,

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.993
so it was open all the time,

00:07:56.073 --> 00:07:58.727
people would come in and go out and this and that

00:07:58.807 --> 00:08:00.959
and I was just enjoying their company.

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:03.626
And one day they asked Me,
what's the matter in Your house,

00:08:03.706 --> 00:08:05.727
all the time people are coming and going

00:08:05.807 --> 00:08:08.360
and used to wonder what is it going on inside.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.327
I said nothing, just they come,
have tea and go, that's all,

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:14.627
just some talk together, some rapport of love.

00:08:14.707 --> 00:08:16.993
But what is this, all the doors are closed,

00:08:17.073 --> 00:08:19.859
that way I must say Sydney people are very open hearted,

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:24.893
and they are, they like to be together, there
is a togetherness in them. But with all this,

00:08:24.973 --> 00:08:29.060
if you cannot have togetherness,

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.193
to enjoy your wealth with others,
then what's the use of all the wealth.

00:08:33.273 --> 00:08:37.226
If you have wealth, you'll go for
horse-racing, that's also your own enjoyment.

00:08:37.306 --> 00:08:40.812
If you have wealth you will do 
something else which is so individualistic.

00:08:40.893 --> 00:08:45.126
You cannot enjoy your wealth
unless and until you share it.

00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:48.460
As I told you the other day that I am,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.859
a capitalist in the sense I have
all the powers within Myself.

00:08:52.939 --> 00:08:55.627
But, I cannot live without sharing it,

00:08:55.707 --> 00:08:58.993
so I am the greatest communist,
because I just cannot enjoy,

00:08:59.073 --> 00:09:01.313
that's why I had to come all the way to Australia

00:09:01.393 --> 00:09:04.527
and today My husband was so
insistent that I should come back soon,

00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:07.126
I said: 'No, I have to meet all the Australians still,

00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:08.393
and then I'll come.'

00:09:08.473 --> 00:09:11.826
So unless and until you
share this love after realization,

00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:13.393
you do not enjoy.

00:09:13.473 --> 00:09:17.593
All isms drop out, because you
become combination of both extremes

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:21.206
and you just start enjoying yourself.
