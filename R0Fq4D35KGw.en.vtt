00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.410
It is the vital energy, which has

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.280
one electromagnetic energy that you have.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.540
What we call as a “Prana”

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.860
It is the energy from 5 elements.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.580
It has the energy by which we are today human beings from amoeba

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.640
and it has the energy which creates desires within us.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.100
It has the energy that can cure us

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.260
and redeems us

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.280
and the energy that can give us powers so we can do living work.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:37.400
Sahaja yoga is with that energy which is in totality complete consciousness,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:02:00.720
and it is a special time today. You can say in modern times, and there are so many people who are trying to think beyond,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.120
we can say it is meta modernism,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.040
no, no, meta modernism

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:37.880
and that is something which shows the wisdom of people who understand that we have to go beyond

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.160
and they are not satisfied with what they are but they have to go beyond

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:16.840
and there are so many who feel that their awareness is to be expanded.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:38.400
In this short time as much as possible I am trying to give you a general picture about Sahaja yoga.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.720
“Saha” means “with”, and “ja” is born,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.400
so it is born with you to have this union with that all-pervading power, Sahaja you have.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.840
It works on all living beings

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.760
and also on energies.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:41.880
For example, you can improve your agriculture in Sahaja yoga 10 times more,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.400
you can improve your ecological problem through Sahaja yoga,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:16.860
you can make your animals much more healthier through Sahaja yoga

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.860
and you yourself become so dynamic

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.280
and so compassionate

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:57.600
that a scientist becomes a person who works only with all the understanding of limitations of science

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.060
and helps to create a new world.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:22.560
I must say all the scientific discoveries have helped Sahaja yoga greatly.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.600
Supposing there were no aeroplanes I did not have come to see you

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.360
if there were no microphones I could not have talked to you

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.060
and these microphones also carry vibrations.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.740
Even on television one can give realization to people.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:19.400
So all these discoveries you have made has been of such a great help to Sahaja yoga.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.600
We have developed the watches to save time,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.960
we save our time to waste it mostly,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:59.680
and after self-realization, we use it for our spiritual ascent and spiritual growth, growth through meditation.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:23.400
So I am very much thankful to you all scientists for making these devices which have made it possible to spread Sahajayoga all over the world.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:41.400
The knowledge of Sahaja yoga is very deep,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.100
our civilization has grown like a big tree,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.240
but knowledge of Sahaja yoga is the knowledge of the roots

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:13.600
and if you do not have the knowledge of the roots this great development will be one day under a shock.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:31.220
So it is important for us to know the knowledge of the roots if we have to survive

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.900
and to enjoy the blessings of science.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:58.040
I am sorry in this short time I cannot say much but I will be very happy to answer your questions if you have any.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:41.840
As a scientist, you have to understand everything whatever you do,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.640
if somebody cures you and cannot explain how

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.120
then you should not accept as a scientist.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.240
but I know that what happens.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:16.600
This is something which is not dealt with by scientists so far,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.660
only in the scriptures they have talked about the soul,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:44.300
now soul, whatever I am telling you, again, you should accept it as a hypothesis.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:03.740
Now soul is a composition of 5 elements, the causal of 5 elements

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:16.940
which is placed on the back side of our...it’s an energy form, it’s an energy form

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:25.840
and is placed on the backside of our spinal cord in 7 loops…

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:46.500
after self-realization you can even see the all-pervading power like small commas shining like light,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:05.860
also you see a kind of loops circular things

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:18.860
and the Sahaja yogis ask Me: what is this?

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.560
I told them these are dead souls.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.440
Now for example we talk of psychosomatic diseases,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:49.980
also doctors have reached a certain point of understanding that most of the psychosomatic diseases

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:59.600
are caused by something that comes from our collective subconscious.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:25.440
For example, cancer they say is triggered by a protein 53 and 58. It’s a name they've got.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:53.180
And they say that it comes from the area which is built within us since our creation,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:10.780
now, this area which is built within us is the area which we call as collective subconsciousness,

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:38.780
so all the plants which have gone out of the circulation of evolution or who have gone out of the circulation are all existing in that area of collective subconscious,

00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:13.720
so when a person who practices what we call as black magic or mesmerism also uses the dead souls

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.820
which are around to captivate you.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.640
And people do mesmerize without knowing what effects it will have on human beings.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:53.500
Now what happens that if you put any such spirit, it can be without the knowledge

00:16:53.500 --> 00:17:04.400
of the person who is doing it automatically. It becomes like a [ ] and then the spirit gets out to your system,

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:29.500
now recently they have found out in the science, scientific research that we have all got receptors

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:39.100
and in the receptors these seven loops that I am telling you about are reflected exactly the same way

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.740
I have seen..if you have seen the picture in the same that you see.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:12.100
And when there are on these loops if there is any effect then what you call as dopamine is created.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:25.280
Dopamine is a kind of a chemical which gives you epilepsy, it can give you madness can give you all mental problems also other virus and cancer, psychosomatic.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:51.220
So I, I didn’t know that I would talk to scientists otherwise I would have brought these papers which I have got from America.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:10.820
So we had about 10 people yesterday, who came from the same gentleman and were suffering from many diseases.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:29.440
Some had their hands stuck like that they couldn’t walk, some children suddenly stopped talking,

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:35.080
some got their eyes completely scooped in, some got the brain paralysis.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:20:02.280
So what happens that you can put one of their or many of these dead spirits on your back on the soul,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.300
and they take over

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:28.840
and when they take over when they try to assert their personality,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:43.420
so for the time being one may feel elated because there are so many personalities acting for a while,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.800
but after sometime that person becomes exhausted and they recluse...

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:12.980
This is followed by many false gurus in India, we know about it very well because just

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.840
this black magic is too much in India.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:37.540
But mainly what one has to know, I would say that as a Mother I would say what did you get out of it?

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.620
Only temporary curing is not the aim of life,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:06.460
but you have to be empowered and you have to have full knowledge as to what you are going to be.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.600
In Sahaja yoga you know all about the centres and it can be good to you.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.700
You can even see with your naked eyes the pulsation of the kundalini,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.320
this power which connects you to the mains.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.900
You can see also sometimes the rising of the kundalini

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.880
you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, the actualisation of it,

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.980
and you can feel the all-pervading power.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:21.320
You may be a doctor may not be a doctor but you can give diagnose to others what centres are in trouble.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.960
There are three channels

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.860
which look after the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system,

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.280
and you can control them,

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.020
you can control your parasympathetic nervous system,

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.340
you can raise the kundalini of others,

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.240
you can cure others,

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:16.440
yourself you feel extremely peaceful, joyous and happy,

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:28.980
because you develop a new dimension of collective consciousness which Jung has written.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.580
So you become complete knowledgeable like a laboratory you know everything,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:53.500
it is not just "ah, it is happening. I don’t know how happening" - nothing of that kind...everything can be explained,

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.320
everything becomes logical,

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:12.600
so anything that just cures you is not sufficient,

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.340
in India this art is very well developed

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:35.080
but we know about it so much that we now don’t go to any false people,

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.180
so now they are exported all to America,

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.440
They are very gullible

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.820
Americans are very gullible people,

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.540
and these people have only interest in money they are money makers.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.800
Now it’s a living process,

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.300
how can you pay for a living process,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.520
how much do we pay to Mother Earth for sprouting a seed?

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.820
These people have all their interest in money,

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:41.500
and not in giving you the powers

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.940
and the knowledge

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.460
because they haven’t got it.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.300
So first of all you must see

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.540
what are the disciples like?

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.280
What do they do?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.740
What sort age they are? What sort of body they have?

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.360
How do they talk?

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.540
What is their health?

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.180
Do they know about all this?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.620
Can they explain it?

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.120
How is their own life?

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.120
You can find out.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.640
They have to be honest

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.880
and they have to be compassionate,

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.620
so be careful,

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:14.240
so many will come once you have lots of money, there will be a market,

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.280
so before anything happen, be careful.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.180
I am a Mother and you have asked me the question I have to tell you the Truth.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:43.600
Eighteen years back I have told this Truth but they would not listen to Me,

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:56.040
In America I told them about AIDS, I told them about UPI disease is going to come,

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.960
I told them about so many diseases they would not listen and now they are down with it.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.940
So what can you do if they don’t want to listen to you, you can’t help it.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:26.000
If they are bent upon their destruction then what can you do? They have all the freedom.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:41.480
Or somebody asked me how to go to hell, all types of questions they ask,

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.100
I said take two running jumps and you are there.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.620
So it is like this,

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.900
For getting your realization you have to first ask for it, I have to respect your freedom

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:15.300
and it’s not a guarantee that you will get it at first shot.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.660
But if you are earnest it will work out

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:41.240
and then once you are fully connected, no problems of any kind.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.060
I found Russians to be very wise people,

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:03.320
and I feel that a day will come when Russians will be most powerful people spiritually.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:15.940
The country is not powerful by weapons but by the powerful peoples.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:50.780
I have to .. his question is still not answered.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:06.480
After realization, we become very sensible and satisfied people,

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.260
and we develop a balance

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:23.620
then we realize that the machines are for us and we are not for machines

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.060
so we produce as much as we want,

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:45.860
and whatever is necessary we produce through machines or we produce through our hands.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.820
So a balance is.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:02.660
As a result of that, the pollution goes down.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:15.640
Now in Spain there are five motor factories,

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:36.660
now on the road you will find in car only one person is sitting, in every car,

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:52.300
because so many cars are produced every day, cars are cheap so they buy a car and an ego is saying: now I've got a car!

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:16.380
The father must have one car, mother must have one car, the child must have one car, the grandmother must have one car

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.860
and they never meet each other,

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.620
no rapport, no relationship,

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:38.480
they live with their cars with their pretty girls and with a suitcase.

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:50.380
So, after realization we become collective,

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.920
there may be three cars but everybody would like to go together in one car,

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.060
they want to live collectively

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.300
because they enjoy each other.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.140
Now Sahaja yoga is working in forty nations,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.700
and they want to live in Indian villages,

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.840
And light it with a spark. I mean you cannot do anything there,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:50.400
but they enjoy it having their baths in the flowing rivers and living in the nature absolutely very happy and comfortable.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:07.860
They wear few clothes of cotton or pure silk or cotton whatever they can afford, not too many things they don’t have in their house

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.180
like plastics,

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.520
mountains and mountains

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.300
and they don’t know how to destroy it,

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.440
and Sahaja yogis don’t drink,

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.600
so only one glass is sufficient for one man,

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:50.080
for drinking we have to have one..., another one, another one, another one,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.660
and too many choices because of ego.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.560
In the morning the mother will ask what will you have?

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.660
One child will say this, another this another that,

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.540
and if that is not in the fridge the child will start shouting,

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.940
Formally the mother used to cook for everyone the same thing

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.460
and everybody had to eat that and enjoy it,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:51.040
because we have lost our collective enjoyment, we have become like this.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.860
Now these entrepreneurs are also making fool of us,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.060
first they will start that you should wear very tight pants,

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.600
so you develop varicose veins,

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.940
so they will say alright make pants with holes in it

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.240
so everybody starts wearing them,

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.220
they go on changing fashions because their machines have to run,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:08.560
and we have no personality, we all want to be fashionable, what is the need?

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.100
So we have piles of clothes,

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:30.880
you go to an English home, as soon as you enter all pile will fall on you first of all.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:42.200
So, this matter is only for one purpose,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.280
is for expressing your love,

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.920
like today we had a birthday,

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.680
so we gave him a tea set,

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.480
and I got some necklaces for all of you,

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.260
and I enjoy very much giving them,

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.940
that’s the only advantage of matter,

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.660
otherwise possessions are headaches.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:42.320
So, how ecological problems has come by? Because of greed and lust.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:58.820
After Sahaja yoga, you get everything beautiful and enjoy everything,

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:17.880
because you feel that this has become a holy water now, everything becomes holy, auspicious,

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:30.200
only thing which are auspicious, which emit vibrations Sahaja yogis will have it,

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.320
all auspicious things are benevolent

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.980
so the ecological problem is solved.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:41.340
So first question is that some diseases can be cured through Sahaja yoga  - as raising the kundalini.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:05.960
Yesterday there was a lady with multiple sclerosis. And she could not stand on her..

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:20.240
and we raised her kundalini, she had problems on her centres,

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:27.980
we corrected the centres raised her kundalini, gave her realization and she got alright,

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:46.260
and then she still [ ] that she was sick so she was holding onto the chair

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:53.200
I said now you get up and walk, and she then started walking so fast, everybody saw.

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.720
Most of them get cured,

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.700
but some of them do not.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.680
Now, first of all, you have to get your self-realization,

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.520
then you have to come to our collective program

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.660
and then you have to master Sahaja yoga

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.660
when you start do it, then you can cure others.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.760
But Sahaja yoga is not for curing,

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.120
it is for self-realization

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:09.120
and when you get your self-realization as a bioproduct

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:21.820
then you can become alright because when the kundalini rises She passes through these centres and nourishes them.

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:57.700
Shri Mataji, if there were some psychological research done relating to influence Sahaja Yoga on people?

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:09.140
Is it possible to see the findings of this research? And may I get Your blessing to conduct such research in center of Sahaja Yoga in Moscow?

00:47:54.500 --> 00:48:03.880
...here accepted for research but if you want to do it otherwise you can do it by using Sahaja yoga methods

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:19.100
to cure people who are suffering from psychosomatic diseases or depressions or anything by treating them and then noting down their improvements.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:03.520
We have here a saint scientist doctor from England, he is here and he can tell you about it.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:09.540
And we are all experimenting with many things. Is he here doctor Wells?

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:22.560
Alright, you come and see he is now running seven hospitals, London.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:43.660
Now we have many doctors here and I think we should meet them who have come from abroad...we should call them.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:59.140
aap aaiye( you please come), We have doctor Talwar? ..Dr. Talwar?

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.540
Dr Talwar from Delhi.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.080
Now we have Dr Ramzad Ali,

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.680
He is from the U.K.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:26.360
And he is a great student of medicines actually.

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.540
He has done a lot of studies.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.160
Then we have Dr Neelam,

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.420
from India.

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.500
Then we have Dr Sarah,

00:50:54.140 --> 00:51:00.480
then we have got a diplomat from UN, Gregoire.

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.320
Then in Russia, we have got Dr Bogdan.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.320
Today is his Birthday.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.380
He has sacrificed his job

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.480
in India and he is now here,

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.300
working it out for Russia.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:58.260
We hope to see some sense of scientists also for you from America.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.540
They’ll explain many more things to you,

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:12.060
also we will send you some papers that they have written.

00:52:49.060 --> 00:53:08.100
And second - is Sahaja Yoga is universal science, which includes Hatha, Raja and other yogas or it is some new principle?

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:50.160
I should say I was born with this knowledge.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:07.160
The second question is about all other yogas.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:22.660
Now Hatha yoga is meaning “Ha” and “Tha” meaning the sun and the moon both lines, both energies,

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:36.000
but in modern times the Hatha yoga they are practising is only of one side,

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:51.080
moreover the one who started hatha yoga was known as Patanjali,

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:07.580
so thousands of years back he’s written a book so big as that so thick,

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:22.360
in that he has written that there are Ashtangas, there are eightfold of yoga, eight aspects, spiritual paths,

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:36.000
out of that yama niyama is the one which is just a wee bit,

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:43.960
yama niyama, is control and the laws

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:02.540
and out of that very wee bit are the exercises,

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.860
now we also use those exercises,

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:21.620
but later on throughout he has talked about Sahaja yoga,

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:31.680
first you get thoughtless awareness and then doubtless awareness.

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:44.420
In those days they used to only have one or two disciples,

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:54.420
and they cleansed their all centers and then raise their kundalini,

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.560
and it could take years together.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:21.640
But now in the Sahaja yoga today,

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:31.100
I have evolved a method by which first you raise the Kundalini somehow,

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:44.380
and in that little light, give them little light they see what’s the problem with that

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.720
and just tell them how to correct

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.280
so they can correct their own problems.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:06.660
In those days people have no time

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.000
and people are very obstinate also

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:22.340
so now supposing there’s darkness and you are holding the snake in your hand

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:36.580
and I say now there is a snake in your hand, you won’t listen to Me, you won’t throw it away till it bites you.

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.940
You will say it’s a rope,

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:51.020
so the best thing is to put little light,

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.640
so you see the snake and throw it away yourself.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.420
This is today’s Sahaja yoga

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:13.460
but it’s the same what he achieved after so many years you can achieve it yourself in a very short time,

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:30.840
and also as we have developed speed I think kundalini has also developed speed.

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:50.440
We call it this as jet times and the kundalini is also a jet kundalini, we call it as a jet, Jet Times, jet. How do you translate this

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:11.000
I am myself surprised, it works en masse.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.500
Yesterday there were 10,000 people,

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:28.060
and I think 95% of people got realization 95.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:51.380
But we do tell you exercises when the kundalini rises, then we tell you if there is any physical problem what exercises to be done, it’s all scientific.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:16.100
But this way these days the way people do hath yoga, they just take all the medicine from the medicine box without knowing what is to be taken without discretion.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.400
Now another is Raja yoga.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:41.160
I went down to California and I saw some doctors whom I knew have cut their tongue.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:02:00.500
and they told me that they had to cut it to do a thing called “khechari” to take back the tongue

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.760
to raise the kundalini.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:18.760
So now when the kundalini rises it is like the ignition of a car,

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:34.720
and when the car is ignited all the machinery works by itself, you don’t have to do anything.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:48.680
So what they do is to put back the tongue thinking by doing that the kundalini will rise,

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:05.820
and poor things now can’t speak can’t eat very difficult,

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:17.380
so it is like moving the wheels without starting the car, will it move?

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.160
It’s all artificial,

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.620
nobody gets realization in that

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.700
because it’s a living process,

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:42.800
now there’s integral yoga,

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.280
that is all mental.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.820
Talking about yoga how can you get your realization?

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:05.080
Supposing if you talk to the Mother Earth will she give us flowers?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.720
Talk..talk..talk..talk..talk..that’s all.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.640
People get fed up with that talks, books after books like this so many.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.340
So far I have not written any book for the same reason,

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.960
then we have another one you call that one? It is transcendental meditation,

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.020
that is the worst I tell you

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:08.460
We had four people from transcendental,

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:20.040
the man was the director of a flying foundation in Scotland,

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.460
to get a mantra

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.400
and the mantras were told in secret

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:48.700
and the mantras were rare, funny ones “Inga, Pinga, Thinga”,

01:05:53.820 --> 01:06:00.500
it has no meaning, it is not Sanskrit, it has no meaning but it has funny meaning also

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:11.580
Inga means the scorpion’s bite

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:23.080
and Pinga means when you get possessed you go round and round like that, that is Pinga

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:34.560
and Thinga means when you show like this to someone,

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.460
300 pounds for that,

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.960
and 6000 pounds for flying halfway.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:03.800
What a stupidity, what is the need to fly halfway you already have traffic jams,

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:24.460
then they were given to drink the water which boiled which boiled potatoes for six days

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:36.780
then the rings of potato rings,

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:47.060
and the last day was given the potatoes to eat.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:08:00.420
But this director, his wife, his daughter and a deputy director all got epilepsy,

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.160
so they came here.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.540
Luckily my husband has gone on a tour so they stayed in my house

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.400
and with my treatment they got cured.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:44.860
They had lost all their money, this man was a diamond merchant, he had lost all his money his wife was a granddaughter of a Duke, she has lost everything.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.160
What is this lady…please tell her to sit down

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:06.040
and a granddaughter who was the granddaughter of a Duke and this man became bankrupt.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:27.120
So and the director and the deputy director became bankrupts

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:33.520
and he is now gone to South Africa and writing a book.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:41.960
The name of the book is “How we were befooled”.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:56.800
This t.m. and now they begin Ayurveda.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:13.080
They are marketing it now marketing it,

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:21.500
there is no need for them to market anybody can take to Ayurveda,

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:36.680
but for Ayurveda, you cannot do it here, you have to go to India because the herbs that are used for curing you cannot grow here.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:57.380
So, just that just trying to I don’t know what are they up to, I just don’t know, they can’t bring Ayurveda here.

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.820
India, Indian medicine,

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:29.100
I mean it is a common sense everybody knows in India that you can’t do Ayurveda anywhere else but in India.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:42.800
I think they will now give some sort of this to you in the name of Ayurveda and they will buy it.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.940
or they give may be some water which has boiled the potatoes.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:09.960
One should know all these things. There’s another one who gives diabetes, supposing.

01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:24.260
only to people who are very big cheats in India

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:36.060
the horrible people who .. they are cheats.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:50.300
If he is so good why doesn’t he solves our problem financial problem in India?

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.140
Why doesn’t he solves some  of our financial problem?

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:05.060
All these people who doing it get heart trouble.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.340
I am telling you everything frankly,

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.600
they will never talk against each other.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:25.960
Christ has said that the house of Satan will never speak against itself.

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:44.020
But they will speak against Me they do!

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.060
They make like that.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.980
They may speak against Me and tell you that I must be a dark force or something, they might,

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:25.240
because it is their business, they will be using money when I am here.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.135
Alright, Thank you very much.
