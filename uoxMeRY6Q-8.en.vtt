00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:49.983
This is a great day for all of us to rejoice

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:58.317
and to enjoy this Resurrection of Christ.

00:00:58.317 --> 00:01:21.317
The Resurrection of Christ took place to open our Agnya center

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.691
because it was a very subtle center as you know, very complicated

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:32.942
with the ideas people had from their conditioning

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:47.983
and from their ego, were so much clogging the Agnya Chakra that Kundalini

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:55.441
could have been impossible to pass through. So

00:01:55.441 --> 00:02:05.608
all the play of Resurrection took place, and as Christ was nothing but chaitanya,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:18.858
He was Resurrected from death so-called. In this death of Christ,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:27.275
we have to also understand that we have achieved our Resurrection.

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:32.025
We have achieved a Resurrection,

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:44.150
also whatever was supposed to be the past has died, is finished now.

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:56.691
So, this repentance that we have, the conditionings we have

00:02:56.733 --> 00:03:01.399
are dead. But still it is very surprising

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.691
that among the Christian nations, the ego did not subside

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:16.441
as it should have been, perhaps may be that Christ was never worshipped in the right way.

00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:28.359
The ego in the west was absolutely, so dominating that nobody could see

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.650
what they are doing, and how far they are going.

00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:42.234
Unnecessarily they are repenting about something that is far fetched.

00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:55.359
But repentance was meant for our ego. It's very shocking sometimes, when you see

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:01.275
how the Christian nations invaded other countries, completely annihilated,

00:04:01.317 --> 00:04:06.942
completely finished and destroyed races after races. They were Christians,

00:04:06.983 --> 00:04:11.566
followers of Christ, taking Bible in their hand,

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:18.067
can you imagine? Such a horrible things these so-called Christians have done

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:25.942
in the name of Christ. Why is it we have to understand

00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:31.109
this ego worked so much in the western countries

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:34.775
or in the countries where they followed Christianity.

00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:37.275
Anywhere if they're Christians

00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:41.025
they are extremely aggressive, extremely violent

00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:44.400
and they think that the whole world belongs to them.

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:48.025
Even Hitler believed in the Catholic religion.

00:04:48.025 --> 00:04:54.067
Sort of this great sacrifice of Christ

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:57.399
never taught them any lesson,

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:02.067
as if it was all obliterated from their memory,

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:04.900
as if it has no meaning to them

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.817
it conveyed nothing to them,

00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:10.525
and they became so violent. Not only that

00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:13.359
but they thought they have a right to rule the whole world,

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:18.942
plunder everyone destroy everyone. Why? Because they were Christians.

00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:22.691
What a contrast it is to the life of Christ

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:30.067
Who resurrected out of the so-called death.

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:39.566
But the ego still remained, not only but it blew up, blew up

00:05:39.608 --> 00:05:43.733
to such an extent that today we see the Christians

00:05:43.775 --> 00:05:49.234
have lost their sense of maryadas completely.

00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:53.817
The way the Christian churches are behaving. Shocking.

00:05:53.858 --> 00:06:03.900
There is no morality of any kind left in them. They have no respect for law,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:12.234
no respect for God, no respect also for the chastity,

00:06:12.275 --> 00:06:19.150
which was the main point of Christ, main guna of Christ.

00:06:19.192 --> 00:06:25.400
This shocked Me when I was a child,

00:06:25.441 --> 00:06:33.775
and I saw, I was born in a Christian family, and I found the Christians in India

00:06:33.775 --> 00:06:39.399
the most dogmatic, most dominating people.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:46.525
It surprised Me. How have they taken Christ for granted?

00:06:46.525 --> 00:06:51.942
And why are they using His name to dominate others?

00:06:51.942 --> 00:06:54.399
Unfortunately at that time

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.192
we had British ruling us. British also

00:06:58.234 --> 00:07:03.900
maneuvered the whole thing in such a manner that the Indians

00:07:03.942 --> 00:07:09.608
believed that Christ was born in England.

00:07:09.608 --> 00:07:14.483
They used to dress up like English, they called themselves sahibs.

00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:18.109
They used to behave in a very arrogant manner,

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:25.067
and they had places in the government. They joined hands with government.

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:28.441
Had no loyalties to Indians.

00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:31.317
Even when My father was arrested

00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:34.234
they threw us out of the Christian community.

00:07:34.275 --> 00:07:38.691
They threw Me out of the school when I was just a six seven year-old girl

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:41.733
because My father was a Congressman.

00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:50.608
So this side of Christianity so far

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:57.817
nobody has seen I personally think, that all the Christian nations

00:07:57.858 --> 00:08:04.817
have been extremely cruel, extremely dominating, and they are today

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:10.608
at the helm of affairs. This subtle ego

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:24.399
has now, which was once the property of some monarchs, but has now in democratic

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:30.691
countries have become very much available to all the ordinary people

00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:35.691
and all these countries we find are full of destruction.

00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:44.317
It's not only that the European did like this, but even Americans

00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:47.983
are extremely dominating, extremely egotistical,

00:08:47.983 --> 00:08:51.399
to such an extent that they are idiotic.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:57.650
Imagine they follow Christ, Who was wisdom,

00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:02.775
the source of wisdom and His disciples should be

00:09:02.775 --> 00:09:06.817
so stupid and idiotic cannot be explained.

00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:15.817
Why it happens like that? So we have to see to the history of religion

00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:24.983
that is Christianity. There was as you know, Peter.

00:09:24.983 --> 00:09:31.109
Peter was a very egotistical fellow, and once Christ

00:09:31.109 --> 00:09:34.817
said that, "You are a satan." Said clearly.

00:09:34.858 --> 00:09:46.359
And also said that, "You'll deny Me, three times." That's the time this Paul came up,

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:52.525
and he thought it's a very good chance to get hold

00:09:52.566 --> 00:10:01.067
of somebody who is a weak person, who is satanic, who is in a way

00:10:01.109 --> 00:10:05.359
anti- Christ and he found Peter.

00:10:05.359 --> 00:10:17.650
He being a great bureaucrat wooed him, managed him, and took him into his own confidence

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:30.441
and told him that, "You join hands with me, so I will make you the main person."

00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:39.109
And then he told, all the other disciples that,

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.691
"You are not so educated. I'm a great educated man,

00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:47.067
and I know what to write what not to write,

00:10:47.067 --> 00:10:50.566
so we shouldn't write all the things that you have written,

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:55.817
we should edit it." He edited the Bible this sinister fellow Paul.

00:10:55.858 --> 00:10:59.817
He edited the Bible. The whole work of Christ

00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:07.441
went into the hands of this devil. He started editing it, and when he edited if you read him

00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:12.566
you'll be surprised it's full of ego. His organizing

00:11:12.608 --> 00:11:18.441
is full of ego whatever he writes, absolutely. But he cut down many things

00:11:18.483 --> 00:11:20.608
which should have been there.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.109
Christ must have mentioned about Kundalini I'm sure.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.067
But not a word about all these things, he avoided it,

00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:33.067
though that you are to be born again and all these things Christ said,

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:36.234
Matthews insisted. But he fought with Matthews,

00:11:36.275 --> 00:11:39.192
and he couldn't accept the Immaculate Conception.

00:11:39.234 --> 00:11:45.399
He had no idea about the Truth,

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:50.942
about the reality, about the miracles that exist with Divinity.

00:11:50.942 --> 00:11:54.275
So he denied, but still

00:11:54.317 --> 00:11:59.067
Matthews stuck onto his own Gospel. But John ran away.

00:11:59.067 --> 00:12:04.983
He started his own style which we call people as Gnostics,

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:11.691
and the other disciples out of the went away. So,

00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:22.234
he edited Luke's Gospel and Matthew's Gospel and with great struggle

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:25.608
they could retain certain original things in that way.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:33.733
So this devil entered into the arena of such a great religion as Christianity,

00:12:33.733 --> 00:12:41.067
and the whole thing became absurd. And that's how Bible,

00:12:41.109 --> 00:12:49.858
which they use now as authority has such words

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.399
that people start thinking no end of themselves.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:13:05.192
The first one suggesting that if you, if you become

00:13:05.234 --> 00:13:18.608
the members of a church, you are chosen.

00:13:18.608 --> 00:13:23.983
But first of all he saw, that it should be written

00:13:24.025 --> 00:13:27.275
that Peter will start this church

00:13:27.275 --> 00:13:30.608
and he will have the key, that's what Christ has said.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.608
And put him on a rock and he will start the church.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.441
Impossible. They put Me in the place of Christ.

00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:45.900
Will I ask the wickedest man to do such a thing?

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:51.192
Will I appoint one person to look after the whole thing?

00:13:51.234 --> 00:14:00.067
This part of the Bible is absolutely blasphemy, and that's how

00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:06.234
once he put it there, Peter got into his own ego,

00:14:06.234 --> 00:14:09.691
thinking no end of himself. It was just maneuvering,

00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:21.441
and managing everything. This was all done with his bureaucratic brains but Peter played into it

00:14:21.483 --> 00:14:26.858
because he was a very weak disciple of Christ. As you know

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.067
in Sahaja Yoga also we have really twelve types of Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:31.109 --> 00:14:41.775
And some of them are very weak. They are weak because they have too much ego.

00:14:41.775 --> 00:14:47.900
They cannot carry on with anyone. They shout at people.

00:14:47.942 --> 00:14:51.608
They disturb others, they think no end of themselves,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:57.234
they are always aggressive, they cannot be collective.

00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:00.900
They never show any love for each other.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:13.359
So this type of Sahaja Yogis are there which are, one by one are showing their colors

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:20.359
but some of them are learning, and are understanding

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:24.441
that this is something is wrong should not be.

00:15:24.483 --> 00:15:29.317
Christ had hardly three and a half years to work out all this,

00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:32.733
but I didn't know that out of these twelve,

00:15:32.775 --> 00:15:40.234
one would be such a sinister fellow that, of course one got Him caught also,

00:15:40.275 --> 00:15:43.400
but this Peter could be such a horrible fellow

00:15:43.441 --> 00:15:52.109
that for his own glory, for his own self-interest,

00:15:52.109 --> 00:16:03.733
he would put such words in the Bible, and have a great authority.

00:16:03.775 --> 00:16:11.234
It has happened also with Mohammed Sahib. Firstly,

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:19.317
that Mohammed Sahib has said that there will be a Resurrection time.

00:16:19.359 --> 00:16:24.733
That means He talked of the future. So

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:27.400
how can it be that He was the last?

00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:31.192
If He was last then how are you going to have the Resurrection?

00:16:31.234 --> 00:16:42.817
But the Seal of Prophet, doesn't mean that it's sealed now,

00:16:42.858 --> 00:16:47.566
no Prophet can come down. It means Seal, means

00:16:47.608 --> 00:16:49.942
a kind of a brand you can call it,

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:55.817
and He was Adi Guru so He called Himself, "I am the Seal."

00:16:55.858 --> 00:17:02.109
He didn't say that, "I have sealed," but crooked people

00:17:02.109 --> 00:17:07.691
take advantage of these little, little words and start using them

00:17:07.733 --> 00:17:12.150
for their own purposes because they are very self-centered.

00:17:12.192 --> 00:17:16.775
So another type of Sahaja Yogis are extremely self-centered.

00:17:16.817 --> 00:17:24.942
Some of them are quite self-centered in the sense that they know their own wives,

00:17:24.983 --> 00:17:30.150
their children and their house and this and that. To them it is very important

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:38.650
to be busy with their children. You'll be amazed

00:17:38.691 --> 00:17:42.650
some people came to Bombay with their children

00:17:42.691 --> 00:17:46.067
didn't come for the puja in Delhi.

00:17:46.109 --> 00:17:50.109
What sort of Sahaja Yogis they are?

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:56.483
So this kind of Sahaja Yogis exist that they are more worried

00:17:56.525 --> 00:18:04.275
about their children than about Sahaja Yoga, more about their own emancipation,

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:06.359
worried about their family, their household.

00:18:06.399 --> 00:18:10.150
Some women are quite good at it.

00:18:10.192 --> 00:18:13.275
They try to remove their husbands from the ashrams.

00:18:13.317 --> 00:18:18.650
They try to find out excuses how to get out of the collectivity.

00:18:18.691 --> 00:18:23.942
We are judged all the time and you

00:18:23.983 --> 00:18:25.983
judge yourself, clearly.

00:18:26.025 --> 00:18:29.025
Now do not think of others when I'm saying this

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:33.983
but put it to yourself. You must know that Christ was crucified.

00:18:33.983 --> 00:18:42.858
And who crucified them? They were not crucified by Jews, is a wrong idea.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.566
How can all the Jews who were just like slaves,

00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:54.733
could crucify Christ? It was the Roman Empire that time wanted to crucify Him

00:18:54.775 --> 00:18:57.942
because they thought He's becoming very powerful.

00:18:57.942 --> 00:19:11.900
And when they tried to crucify, they didn't even think

00:19:11.942 --> 00:19:24.942
that Christ is crucified because Jews wanted it.

00:19:24.942 --> 00:19:31.650
The blame was put on them just to avoid the blame

00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:34.900
from the people who were rulers, and the rulers

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.483
can always do such a thing

00:19:37.525 --> 00:19:50.399
is to make crucifixion of anyone and putting the blame on anyone.

00:19:50.399 --> 00:19:57.566
So the Christians, the early Christians were mostly Jews.

00:19:57.608 --> 00:20:01.525
Christ Himself was a Jew,

00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:09.192
so to say that Jews crucified Christ, how can it be?

00:20:09.192 --> 00:20:15.608
So the blame was put on the Jews, and then Christians thought

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.234
that they have every right to hate the Jews

00:20:18.234 --> 00:20:22.775
because Christ was crucified by Jews.

00:20:22.775 --> 00:20:29.817
This is another idea which has worked out through Mr. Paul

00:20:29.858 --> 00:20:33.025
because he didn't want to take any blame

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:42.858
on the Roman administration. So Pilate washes his hands, and  he washes his hands,

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.608
they're very significant, he washes his hands.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:51.025
So he's doing it not with his authority but he's doing it

00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:54.608
with the authorities of the Jew.This drama was played.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.483
And then all the Christians were busy hating the Jews

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:05.150
and thinking that they have crucified Christ,

00:21:05.192 --> 00:21:11.441
I mean, those are thousands of years when it had happened.

00:21:11.483 --> 00:21:17.150
And in thousand of years, somebody crucified somebody,

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:20.441
for that they are hated. I mean in that way

00:21:20.483 --> 00:21:24.067
all the white race must be hated.

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:29.150
For generations together, if that is the criteria

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:36.192
because they have not only crucified One Man. Millions and millions they have crucified.

00:21:36.234 --> 00:21:40.733
Are we going to blame their children and their children?

00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:46.650
So this is third type of Sahaja Yogis we have,

00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:51.150
who try to blame somebody else all the time

00:21:51.192 --> 00:21:57.275
not themselves. Such people

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:59.317
when they start blaming others

00:21:59.317 --> 00:22:03.608
can never improve. They should introspect.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.858
But introspection is missing very much

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.275
in the western countries except in Russia,

00:22:09.317 --> 00:22:13.150
because there is no way out. Is nowhere written

00:22:13.192 --> 00:22:17.317
that you introspect yourself. Only thing

00:22:17.359 --> 00:22:22.192
if you go to church and confess it to some deaf and dumb priest

00:22:22.234 --> 00:22:26.067
you are saved. So nobody introspects.

00:22:26.109 --> 00:22:32.399
Let us face it ourselves, do we introspect or not?

00:22:32.399 --> 00:22:36.025
Or we are that kind of people, Sahaja Yogis

00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:43.400
who are not so much self-centered, but are self-opinionated

00:22:43.441 --> 00:22:46.150
and self-glorified,

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:52.858
who do not want to find out what's wrong with them.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:23:08.275
Now we have another kind fourth kind, which is very interesting to see

00:23:08.275 --> 00:23:16.483
that they are worshipping Mataji in the house

00:23:16.525 --> 00:23:19.483
but they can't come to collective.

00:23:19.525 --> 00:23:23.525
No they can't, because it's little far away. But

00:23:23.566 --> 00:23:30.983
if they have to go to meet their son they will go miles together.

00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:37.067
If they have to do something for their family they'll do it.

00:23:37.109 --> 00:23:43.483
Not only that but supposing they have to do some business, they will travel.

00:23:43.483 --> 00:23:50.691
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is asked to give up their jobs,

00:23:50.733 --> 00:23:55.399
to give up their lives, lifestyles nothing of the kind,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.317
but priority is to be seen.

00:23:58.359 --> 00:24:03.067
They are very busy with their work, with earnings,

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:11.525
with whatever they are doing, and they are just after earning a name working very hard,

00:24:11.525 --> 00:24:15.900
doing artistic work maybe creative work,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:21.983
they are very busy, they have no time for themselves, no time for God.

00:24:22.025 --> 00:24:29.150
This kind of people also: 'Oh we worship Mother,

00:24:29.192 --> 00:24:36.942
before our creative work we bow to Mother, take help from Her,

00:24:36.983 --> 00:24:46.234
and we want all the protection from Her for our work, for our creativity'.

00:24:46.275 --> 00:24:52.691
And there are some Sahaja Yogis who still think

00:24:52.733 --> 00:24:56.650
that money is very important, still think. It is not.

00:24:56.691 --> 00:25:01.983
In Sahaja Yoga we get money whenever we want.

00:25:02.025 --> 00:25:06.483
Some of them, "I'm starting a business

00:25:06.525 --> 00:25:12.025
because .001% I want to give to Sahaja Yoga."

00:25:12.025 --> 00:25:18.192
And if you say, "Why are you giving?"

00:25:18.234 --> 00:25:26.817
"It's all Yours Mother .001%. It's all Yours. After all what are we doing, it's all Yours."

00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:34.317
This kind of attitude comes when you think that money is very important.

00:25:34.359 --> 00:25:43.359
Money is very important for such people who cannot see God beyond this,

00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:48.275
who cannot see subtler advantage of this money.

00:25:48.317 --> 00:25:52.400
They calculate every pi, meticulously,

00:25:52.441 --> 00:25:58.025
they don't want that their hard-earned money

00:25:58.025 --> 00:26:05.150
should be wasted about their Spirituality.

00:26:05.192 --> 00:26:12.566
Or we have people who won't buy a book of Sahaja Yoga. Wouldn't buy a tape

00:26:12.566 --> 00:26:18.441
they'll copy it, saving you know, save pounds or save dollars.

00:26:18.441 --> 00:26:23.399
They wouldn't buy something that is needed.

00:26:23.399 --> 00:26:30.817
They wouldn't buy a Photograph, but they would like to ask somebody

00:26:30.858 --> 00:26:34.317
to make a Photograph out of it and we can have that.

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:37.399
It's not that it is necessary to spend,

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.525
but the attitude of mind. If you can save some money

00:26:41.525 --> 00:26:45.733
very good, if you can save some time, very good,

00:26:45.733 --> 00:26:48.858
but that this time that is saved,

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.150
is for Sahaja Yoga they seldom understand.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:57.858
If you read any, I was reading the Buddhist religion

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.317
and I was amazed, there are so many don'ts,

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:05.483
that if I put even one to Sahaja Yogis

00:27:05.525 --> 00:27:07.858
you'll all run away.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.983
First is you cannot make any profit, no profit.

00:27:12.025 --> 00:27:19.858
You cannot buy any land. You can only eat your food once a day,

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:26.942
you have to be vegetarian absolutely. You cannot kill anyone.

00:27:26.942 --> 00:27:30.317
I mean you may kill human beings

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:32.317
that's not written.

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:34.109
But you cannot kill any animal,

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.775
you cannot kill any fish, you cannot kill even a mosquito.

00:27:37.817 --> 00:27:46.067
So this kind of religion is there

00:27:46.067 --> 00:27:50.525
which is they say Buddha talked about, I don't think so Buddha could have said.

00:27:50.525 --> 00:27:55.900
So all these people the followers of all these great Incarnations,

00:27:55.942 --> 00:27:59.942
have done so much wrong to the people

00:27:59.942 --> 00:28:04.650
who brought beautiful religions to us, and that's why

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:10.234
we are absolutely deviated from the path of Truth.

00:28:10.275 --> 00:28:16.067
So those who really are honest and want to adhere

00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:21.858
to the path of Truth, have to all the time introspect

00:28:21.858 --> 00:28:26.566
and find out within yourself, how far we are on the Truth.

00:28:26.566 --> 00:28:42.150
So now we have another kind of Sahaja Yogis also, who are, more sort of, I should say like enjoy festivals you see,

00:28:42.192 --> 00:28:50.650
clubbing together, because we have a feeling of belonging, we should belong to something.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:55.733
We should belong to this group or to that group or to that group.

00:28:55.775 --> 00:29:02.691
Either you go to Christianity or to the Jews or to the Islam

00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:07.150
and other to some politics. Say for in England they'll ask you question,

00:29:07.192 --> 00:29:09.067
"What is your politics?"

00:29:09.109 --> 00:29:13.399
Asked Me what is My politics. I couldn't understand this question.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.525
Everybody must have a brand of a politics.

00:29:16.525 --> 00:29:18.441
I said, "What do you mean by that?"

00:29:18.441 --> 00:29:20.359
Said, "Are you a communist?"

00:29:20.359 --> 00:29:23.691
"No, no I'm not." "Are you a conservative?" "No, no."

00:29:23.733 --> 00:29:26.275
"Are you a socialist?" "I'm not." "Then what are you?"

00:29:26.317 --> 00:29:28.483
"I am a human being."

00:29:28.525 --> 00:29:32.234
They couldn't understand I am just a human being,

00:29:32.275 --> 00:29:35.983
without any politics on My head. So,

00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:44.817
the idea of belonging, I must belong to this cult or to this sect

00:29:44.858 --> 00:29:56.275
or to this so-called religions. Then you start getting involved into all kinds of conditionings,

00:29:56.317 --> 00:30:02.150
all kinds of rules and regulations and things and you start binding yourself

00:30:02.192 --> 00:30:04.441
and you're very happy, very happy.

00:30:04.483 --> 00:30:07.566
You ask some sects,

00:30:07.608 --> 00:30:10.399
"Why are you clean-shaven?"

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:18.275
"Oh in our religion we are supposed to have a clean-shave head." "What is this?"

00:30:18.275 --> 00:30:24.608
Or something like that, stupid. Like you must have beard, or you must have moustaches,

00:30:24.608 --> 00:30:30.858
some sort of a clannishness,

00:30:30.858 --> 00:30:38.691
not understanding that reality is full of varieties.

00:30:38.691 --> 00:30:47.817
There has to be variety. That is how it is aesthetics and saundariya.

00:30:47.858 --> 00:30:51.942
If you do not have variety,

00:30:51.983 --> 00:30:55.483
how can you be a personality?

00:30:55.525 --> 00:31:02.942
How can be a person who is bound by this nonsensical outside ideas,

00:31:02.983 --> 00:31:07.566
be a person who has a personality?

00:31:07.608 --> 00:31:10.858
If religion cannot give you a personality

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.234
is better to do away with such a thing.

00:31:14.234 --> 00:31:21.691
It gives you an inner personality, and also an outer personality.

00:31:21.733 --> 00:31:27.817
And this personality when you start enjoying,

00:31:27.858 --> 00:31:32.109
then only one would say you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:31:32.109 --> 00:31:35.650
where you are not told

00:31:35.691 --> 00:31:40.317
not to steal, not to hit someone,

00:31:40.317 --> 00:31:48.733
not to be aggressive with anyone, not to be egoistical, never said like that.

00:31:48.775 --> 00:31:56.025
But a personality that watches, oneself.

00:31:56.025 --> 00:32:00.399
But normally people watch others not themselves.

00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:07.317
This is also another problem of the west that you watch others,

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:13.317
never watch yourself. But all this goes on and on and on,

00:32:13.317 --> 00:32:22.399
till we really become slaves of our own ideas

00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:25.441
about a personality and we start projecting

00:32:25.483 --> 00:32:28.067
that personality through our ego

00:32:28.067 --> 00:32:33.150
and try to show that we are something very special.

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:39.441
Just the opposite is Sahaja Yoga try to understand this very clearly.

00:32:39.483 --> 00:32:46.109
We are all a personality, you are all persons, you are all Saints

00:32:46.109 --> 00:32:50.650
and are to be respected as Saints. We need not have

00:32:50.691 --> 00:32:57.067
the same type of personality. Everybody must have to...

00:32:57.109 --> 00:33:05.359
I mean it has to be, different types of styles of talking, styles of delivering things,

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:15.317
styles of expression of Divine Love. So

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:20.942
we do not form a kind of a regimental people,

00:33:20.983 --> 00:33:24.858
because we are free. We are absolutely free,

00:33:24.858 --> 00:33:31.983
because we have the light. We know how far, we have to go,

00:33:31.983 --> 00:33:35.525
what is the right way, which way to go.

00:33:35.566 --> 00:33:42.733
Immediately you know what is correct,

00:33:42.775 --> 00:33:48.067
if that light is there nicely burning within yourself,

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:51.275
you don't have to ask Me, ask anyone.

00:33:51.275 --> 00:34:06.525
When such people come up, understanding that Sahaja Yoga

00:34:06.566 --> 00:34:16.775
is complete freedom. But, this complete freedom is there because you have the light.

00:34:16.817 --> 00:34:28.483
Without the light the freedom is nonsense, it has no meaning. You hurt everyone,

00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:33.109
you trouble everyone, torture everyone, but with the light,

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:39.775
firstly great thing happened to us that religions

00:34:39.775 --> 00:34:49.817
which are preached by these great Prophets and Incarnations

00:34:49.858 --> 00:34:53.441
just become part and parcel of ourselves.

00:34:53.483 --> 00:34:57.109
Here it is, the Japanese will say we are Buddhists

00:34:57.109 --> 00:35:04.691
and kill as many people as they like. Or the Christians as I said,

00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:09.858
are just the opposite of what they are. So then

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:14.650
you really became a real Christian and a real Muslim and a real Hindu.

00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:17.817
And then you realize all religions

00:35:17.817 --> 00:35:21.275
are really like a part of the Ocean

00:35:21.317 --> 00:35:27.317
and you no more identify yourself with any particular one

00:35:27.317 --> 00:35:29.858
but you just jump in the ocean of religion

00:35:29.858 --> 00:35:37.234
and you are, in a way the real religious personality.

00:35:37.234 --> 00:35:41.109
I don't have to tell you

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:47.608
about your morality, you just see watch how you have dropped out,

00:35:47.608 --> 00:35:55.525
so many of these wrong things which you were doing. So many used to write to Me also,

00:35:55.566 --> 00:35:58.400
but I never read them,

00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:04.525
so I used to just burn off everything. I don't want to know about it.

00:36:04.566 --> 00:36:13.150
We are a free person. In that freedom, you see

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:18.109
that you have imbibed all these religions.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:23.817
Before Realization no-one no-one, can be religious.

00:36:23.858 --> 00:36:31.733
They can profess, they can have a brand, they may say something

00:36:31.775 --> 00:36:34.317
but is all outside, not only that

00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:39.900
but they are just the opposite of the religion they are professing. Just the opposite.

00:36:39.942 --> 00:36:55.983
And they deviate, not only that, pollute the basis of religion.

00:36:55.983 --> 00:37:01.650
And the basis of religion is the Ascent.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:07.359
If the religion cannot give you the balance to Ascent

00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:12.275
it's better to have no religion. Atheists are better

00:37:12.275 --> 00:37:15.025
like Russians, who have no religion,

00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:17.566
who are only worried about their Ascent.

00:37:17.566 --> 00:37:21.858
That's why maybe that Christ and Mahavira didn't want to talk about God.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:30.109
So then we have people who have the light, and they worry

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:37.525
about their own light and they want that this light should be there all the time burning,

00:37:37.525 --> 00:37:43.234
and this light not only should enlighten them,

00:37:43.234 --> 00:37:48.359
but enlighten others, and they work for it.

00:37:48.359 --> 00:37:50.775
They take up responsibility in a way.

00:37:50.775 --> 00:37:56.025
They do not sit in a jungle meditating.

00:37:56.025 --> 00:38:05.399
No, you have to work, you have to work, in this world. You have to work it out,

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.359
Sahaja Yoga for others.

00:38:08.399 --> 00:38:11.733
You have to give them, this beautiful feeling

00:38:11.733 --> 00:38:17.399
of oneness with the Divine. You have to enjoy all that.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.858
Sahaja Yoga is not only for your enjoyment,

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:25.359
like some drunkards sitting and drinking together.

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:40.109
It is to fill up your cups to be given to others, to many others who are there.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:46.400
So they take up this responsibility, and the basis is

00:38:46.441 --> 00:38:50.234
the truth that they know about.

00:38:50.234 --> 00:38:58.858
They do not think that they are like a liability of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:04.775
They do not come to Me for small, small things,

00:39:04.817 --> 00:39:08.942
"How can I grow the hair of my father's baldness?"

00:39:08.942 --> 00:39:16.109
Sort of nonsensical question. They even write to Me such nonsensical things. I'm amazed

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:20.192
what do they think Sahaja Yoga is meant to be a beauty parlor or what?

00:39:20.234 --> 00:39:25.650
Their vision is very different. The vision is

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:41.317
of that great universe, the great universe that has to be enlightened. They are

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:45.399
part and parcel of that. And this universal religion

00:39:45.399 --> 00:39:51.067
is to be brought into the lives of people through Realization,

00:39:51.067 --> 00:39:54.483
through awakening of Kundalini. They work very hard,

00:39:54.525 --> 00:40:00.192
they spare no efforts to see

00:40:00.234 --> 00:40:05.608
that people receive Realization. But here also

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:14.317
a little of this ego, subtly is there. That I am doing this,

00:40:14.359 --> 00:40:19.483
I am doing that. So many people ask Me,

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:22.441
"Mother You travel so much, You do so much,

00:40:22.441 --> 00:40:29.025
how is it You manage at this age so well?"

00:40:29.067 --> 00:40:31.275
First of all I don't know what is My age is,

00:40:31.275 --> 00:40:33.942
I don't care. And secondly

00:40:33.942 --> 00:40:38.817
I don't do anything. If I'm not doing anything how can I be tired?

00:40:38.817 --> 00:40:43.317
I'm not doing anything whatsoever. It's all working out

00:40:43.317 --> 00:40:47.483
I just watch and see and enjoy. So they also think,

00:40:47.525 --> 00:40:49.817
"We are doing this work we are doing that work."

00:40:49.858 --> 00:40:55.150
And become very conscious of it.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:41:01.441
Then again this Mr. Ego, which is subtly still there flickering, flame becomes a big one.

00:41:01.441 --> 00:41:05.691
It's an anti-Christ activity, absolutely.

00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:14.441
So the construction of the mind starts you see, this one is not working, that one is this, this is,

00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:17.608
they start criticizing others.

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:21.817
Still watching others not themselves.

00:41:21.817 --> 00:41:30.983
Then there are Sahaja Yogis who do not feel that way.

00:41:31.025 --> 00:41:34.900
They realize that Paramchaitanya is working everything,

00:41:34.942 --> 00:41:40.067
and working through them. They are the instrument,

00:41:40.067 --> 00:41:49.608
and sometimes of course, if it fails they start doubting.

00:41:49.608 --> 00:41:53.942
"Then how is it Mother this thing has happened like this?

00:41:53.942 --> 00:41:59.150
If it is so, then how is it Gorbachev had to leave?"

00:41:59.192 --> 00:42:04.067
I have to explain why Gorbachev

00:42:04.067 --> 00:42:06.067
had to leave politics, imagine.

00:42:06.067 --> 00:42:09.192
That's My responsibility.

00:42:09.192 --> 00:42:11.317
Of course we can ask God any questions.

00:42:11.359 --> 00:42:14.942
That's human beings think they have a right

00:42:14.983 --> 00:42:18.983
to ask any question to God, to curse Him, to say whatever they feel like to God

00:42:19.025 --> 00:42:23.566
as if He is a Person who has taken your liability.

00:42:23.608 --> 00:42:29.566
So this still lingers on a little bit

00:42:29.566 --> 00:42:35.109
when even they are quite surrendered about it still,

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.983
there are certain doubts, in the minds.

00:42:38.025 --> 00:42:47.441
But then there are people who do not doubt anything.

00:42:47.483 --> 00:42:57.983
They understand there is Paramchaitanya which is helping.

00:42:57.983 --> 00:43:05.192
They know that behind all these miracles there is Paramchaitanya.

00:43:05.192 --> 00:43:16.650
Above all of them, are the ones start realizing

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:27.317
that we have got powers definitely, and that we are connected with the Divine.

00:43:27.317 --> 00:43:36.775
We have powers. Of course sometimes they also doubt, if we really have powers I mean.

00:43:36.775 --> 00:43:40.317
I have known some people they said, I said, "Why don't you help there?"

00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:42.900
"Because I'm afraid my ego will come up."

00:43:42.942 --> 00:43:46.650
"Why don't you do this?" "Because my ego will come up."

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:50.817
They are frightened of their ego so this ego follows very subtly,

00:43:50.858 --> 00:44:04.399
and better not risk it, not too much you see, it's too much. Let us go little slowly,

00:44:04.399 --> 00:44:10.817
not to sort of believe that I have powers.

00:44:10.817 --> 00:44:21.650
But there are people, who know they have been blessed

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:29.775
with powers, and these powers can be discovered

00:44:29.775 --> 00:44:32.234
more and more within yourself.

00:44:32.275 --> 00:44:36.942
They have faith in themselves, they have faith in Sahaja Yoga,

00:44:36.983 --> 00:44:47.691
and they have complete faith in Me and in this Paramchaitanya. And they work out, very simple people.

00:44:47.733 --> 00:44:52.483
Extremely simple people they are, very simple-hearted

00:44:52.525 --> 00:44:55.399
innocent people. I've seen in the villages

00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.900
I've seen many also here, there are many sitting of that kind.

00:45:00.942 --> 00:45:06.317
So this is the twelve types of Sahaja Yogis I have described

00:45:06.317 --> 00:45:21.942
but, there's one that is the one, which is fully empowered, also.

00:45:21.942 --> 00:45:25.483
They discover their own powers.

00:45:25.525 --> 00:45:34.109
In that introspection they see and they are sure about it

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:39.067
no doubts. That is the state of nirvikalpa.

00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:46.775
They have no doubts about themselves, to have faith in Me, to worship Me,

00:45:46.817 --> 00:45:54.067
to receive something from Me.

00:45:54.109 --> 00:46:00.525
But know that I have made you also something great,

00:46:00.566 --> 00:46:04.483
and that you have to develop your powers also.

00:46:04.525 --> 00:46:10.234
Don't only depend on the powers that I have.

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:21.399
Just do not try to extract powers, which are from your Mother,

00:46:21.399 --> 00:46:26.566
but try to rise onto the same levels.

00:46:26.608 --> 00:46:34.234
You can. I wouldn't say how many will, but try.

00:46:34.275 --> 00:46:44.399
And for that first and foremost thing, first and most important thing is complete humility.

00:46:44.399 --> 00:46:49.650
Of course, you are surrendered to Me so you are humble.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.317
Mohammed Sahib talked of surrender.

00:46:52.317 --> 00:46:56.525
I say surrender yourself to your Self.

00:46:56.525 --> 00:47:00.483
If your Self is the Spirit,

00:47:00.483 --> 00:47:04.691
why not surrender your Self to your Self.

00:47:04.691 --> 00:47:11.691
But make that Self shine. Just become one with that light.

00:47:11.733 --> 00:47:21.025
Whole life should be a light, light of love,

00:47:21.025 --> 00:47:31.441
light of Divinity, light of beauty. So you have to work out through introspection,

00:47:31.483 --> 00:47:35.275
you have got all these powers within yourself.

00:47:35.275 --> 00:47:42.192
So many powers you have. Of course depending on Mother

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:47.234
is nice thing but now you grow, you have to grow.

00:47:47.234 --> 00:47:56.608
You have to grow and take up the responsibility without feeling responsible.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.359
The personality should be such.

00:48:00.399 --> 00:48:09.275
I hope we have to go ahead, of all the other disciples.

00:48:09.317 --> 00:48:20.650
Unless and until we do that, can we, possibly I don't know, we might drown Sahaja Yoga

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:24.441
into another ocean of nonsense.

00:48:24.483 --> 00:48:30.399
So we have to also to develop our personalities,

00:48:30.399 --> 00:48:35.067
through our introspection, through our understandings,

00:48:35.067 --> 00:48:40.942
through our proofs of reality.

00:48:40.983 --> 00:48:47.399
I'm sorry today I have to tell about these things

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.025
but I had no other chance to talk to you about it except for today

00:48:52.067 --> 00:48:54.150
that how the disciples of Christ

00:48:54.192 --> 00:49:00.359
were deceived by this Peter and Paul company

00:49:00.359 --> 00:49:06.608
and I sometimes think of human beings how they are and how clever

00:49:06.608 --> 00:49:13.275
and cunning they are and how they can try, to bring down Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:13.275 --> 00:49:15.775
which is so important today.

00:49:15.817 --> 00:49:22.858
Today is the day of our Resurrection. We have to pass

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:30.400
through these twelve stages to reach the higher state,

00:49:30.441 --> 00:49:36.067
and they call it the fourteenth stage is the highest,

00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:44.109
where you are just an instrument, absolutely insensitive

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:51.983
about what you are, playing into the hands of Paramchaitanya.

00:49:51.983 --> 00:50:02.317
Is a very good auspicious day today. This is what Christ has done.

00:50:02.317 --> 00:50:07.399
He accepted His crucifixion because He had to play that role.

00:50:07.399 --> 00:50:16.441
And, it was a terrible thing. But when He was carrying the Cross,

00:50:16.483 --> 00:50:20.359
they were worried about Him, then He said,

00:50:20.399 --> 00:50:25.150
"Don't worry about Me, you'd better worry about yourself."

00:50:25.192 --> 00:50:29.441
Despite all this mutilation in the Bible,

00:50:29.483 --> 00:50:33.691
lots of truths have been there still.

00:50:33.733 --> 00:50:44.525
So we are not to hate anyone because they have crucified Christ that's what they say,

00:50:44.525 --> 00:50:49.775
but hate that kind of an authority if it comes to us

00:50:49.817 --> 00:50:53.400
we should not try to crucify others.

00:50:53.441 --> 00:51:01.399
But the subtle ego that works, starts in a very funny manner,

00:51:01.399 --> 00:51:04.942
and in the collectivity it starts showing up.

00:51:04.983 --> 00:51:07.650
Try to reduce it, try to reduce.

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:19.858
And you'll be amazed, as soon as this 'I'ness is finished,

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:24.150
all the powers will start coming up.

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:34.900
It's like a flute which has got hollowness within it, if there's any obstruction,

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:45.691
it cannot play. So all these ideas we have,

00:51:45.733 --> 00:51:53.317
all these conditionings we had, the worst of all this so-called ego that,

00:51:53.317 --> 00:51:57.192
"I am doing that," should go away,

00:51:57.234 --> 00:52:05.025
because you can never enjoy if you think that way. You cannot enjoy your work,

00:52:05.025 --> 00:52:11.858
and you really cannot jump into the Ocean of Joy

00:52:11.858 --> 00:52:15.317
as long as in you that, "I am doing it."

00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:30.025
So also there are certain questions about the school they have been asking,

00:52:30.067 --> 00:52:42.483
but I've already told that it's a very big task to run a school

00:52:42.483 --> 00:52:46.483
and we have found out that the western children

00:52:46.483 --> 00:52:52.608
have got a very poor immune system, very poor.

00:52:52.608 --> 00:52:58.150
Maybe they were given antibiotics or they have been given such food, tinned food maybe

00:52:58.192 --> 00:53:07.483
or maybe some sort of a protected things. I don't know why or maybe they have seen lots of these ghost stories

00:53:07.525 --> 00:53:14.483
or maybe the films or something that their immune system is very, very weak,

00:53:14.525 --> 00:53:17.525
with the slightest thing they catch.

00:53:17.566 --> 00:53:23.234
If something is wrong with another person they catch it.

00:53:23.234 --> 00:53:25.942
This is a new discovery we had.

00:53:25.983 --> 00:53:28.691
Also I think with the heat

00:53:28.733 --> 00:53:31.275
their brains start boiling because already

00:53:31.317 --> 00:53:35.733
they are on the ego trips. So we have decided

00:53:35.733 --> 00:53:46.858
to take them down now from Vashi to Dharmashala. Dharamshala you'll be surprised that Yogi

00:53:46.858 --> 00:53:53.983
has donated ten acres of land. Also I have donated some land.

00:53:54.025 --> 00:53:58.608
Also lot of money has been donated by Indians

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:02.525
and we are going to develop a school. You don't worry on that,

00:54:02.566 --> 00:54:08.817
what sort of a school we are going to have, what we are going to do there, you have to leave things to us.

00:54:08.858 --> 00:54:14.359
This is one thing. Accordingly because they were going to have the school

00:54:14.399 --> 00:54:17.608
in December it was not decided, it was discovered

00:54:17.608 --> 00:54:21.399
when the month April started, the children started getting sick.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:26.359
With little dust they would start coughing, coughing, coughing,

00:54:26.399 --> 00:54:33.067
allergies, all kinds. Then we decided that let them be

00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:43.983
in a cooler place, so they will be in Dharamshala and let them be there.

00:54:43.983 --> 00:54:49.067
Now for all the parents they have to know one thing,

00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:53.650
if they want their children to come up properly

00:54:53.650 --> 00:55:01.900
they have to leave them to the school to manage. You are not going to interfere with that.

00:55:01.942 --> 00:55:12.109
Of course because according to the first plan there would have been three months holidays

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:16.566
in the summer time and they would have been in Dharamshala,

00:55:16.608 --> 00:55:21.817
but now as they are taking up the same course there's no holiday

00:55:21.817 --> 00:55:26.359
for them and their school has started. So please

00:55:26.359 --> 00:55:30.150
don't go to Dharamshala. Immediately parents are rushing.

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:37.109
Please cancel your tickets.

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:44.234
Only you can meet your children in Sheri where they'll be there for three and a half months.

00:55:44.275 --> 00:55:47.067
You come and stay there

00:55:47.067 --> 00:55:52.317
during wintertime, that's the only time you should meet your children.

00:55:52.317 --> 00:55:58.525
Apart from health their education is very poor.

00:55:58.525 --> 00:56:04.817
So many of them even at the age of eight years don't know how to write properly.

00:56:04.858 --> 00:56:10.900
Absolutely they are completely neglected, pampered children.

00:56:10.942 --> 00:56:16.399
So let the school look after them. They don't want to study,

00:56:16.399 --> 00:56:20.399
they have no sense of future. They have no sense

00:56:20.441 --> 00:56:28.817
as to why are they on this earth. So let them handle.

00:56:28.817 --> 00:56:34.733
Please, some parents might not have gone for sometime maybe,

00:56:34.775 --> 00:56:36.900
but that doesn't mean as soon as you get money

00:56:36.942 --> 00:56:39.317
or a provision you rush there.

00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:44.192
Try to understand that you shouldn't disturb discipline the school

00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:50.775
and the discipline of the children. Because if there's one parent coming

00:56:50.817 --> 00:56:54.983
or two parents coming, all the children start feeling bad

00:56:55.025 --> 00:56:58.234
and their attention is spoiled. So

00:56:58.275 --> 00:57:05.650
the first thing we have to imbibe today the wisdom of Christ. Wisdom.

00:57:05.691 --> 00:57:09.942
Wisdom should tell you that leave the children.

00:57:09.983 --> 00:57:15.150
We are trying our level best

00:57:15.192 --> 00:57:17.608
to do the best for them.

00:57:17.608 --> 00:57:30.109
We are not yet asking you for any help. So far, we are working it out. It's very surprising

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:34.817
how these children are very intelligent, and they grasp things very well,

00:57:34.817 --> 00:57:39.359
but they just don't want to sit down anywhere. All the time they want to be out.

00:57:39.359 --> 00:57:44.525
They don't want to study. So we have to find out ways and methods

00:57:44.566 --> 00:57:49.650
by which they have self-esteem that they think

00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:51.817
they have to do something in life.

00:57:51.858 --> 00:57:59.067
The parents first of all are in the west known to be very negligent about their children

00:57:59.067 --> 00:58:02.234
they even kill their children and all that. But in Sahaja Yoga

00:58:02.275 --> 00:58:05.234
they just get attached like a glue.

00:58:05.275 --> 00:58:09.691
From one side they are left and they become glued to the whole family is glued,

00:58:09.691 --> 00:58:15.900
they can't get over it. And this kind of love

00:58:15.942 --> 00:58:18.942
is the death of love.

00:58:18.983 --> 00:58:27.650
So, please try to understand that these are the children of Sahaja Yoga,

00:58:27.691 --> 00:58:33.608
and they are looked after. Everything is going to be worked out very well for them.

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:41.317
And have the wisdom to enjoy, this development of your children.

00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:47.067
If you have any problems about it,

00:58:47.067 --> 00:58:52.441
you shouldn't trouble the people there.

00:58:52.441 --> 00:58:58.441
All your attention is on your child, is a very wrong thing.

00:58:58.483 --> 00:59:01.399
I think that person is not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:05.525
Because you do not think that God is responsible for them.

00:59:05.566 --> 00:59:08.275
You think you are responsible

00:59:08.275 --> 00:59:11.025
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi at all by any chance.

00:59:11.067 --> 00:59:15.317
You love your own children but you don't love other children.

00:59:15.359 --> 00:59:18.566
You're not bothered about their problems their situations.

00:59:18.566 --> 00:59:21.608
Supposing one father mother go there,

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:25.900
then all the rest of the children are going to feel bad.

00:59:25.942 --> 00:59:27.942
Then why should you go?

00:59:27.942 --> 00:59:34.317
Then also sending presents, some people start sending presents, tinned fruit.

00:59:34.359 --> 00:59:36.983
Now anybody sends tinned fruit

00:59:36.983 --> 00:59:43.900
we are going to throw it in the sea. Chocolates. There's no need to send anything like that.

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:48.192
If you have to send something then send something that is good for them

00:59:48.234 --> 00:59:51.275
for the whole school. Otherwise just don't send.

00:59:51.275 --> 00:59:55.775
Only for your child please don't send. You are Sahaja Yogis,

00:59:55.775 --> 00:59:59.025
you are not like other people. You are special people.

00:59:59.067 --> 01:00:03.441
So if you have to send something, send for all the children

01:00:03.441 --> 01:00:06.525
but not chocolates or not things

01:00:06.566 --> 01:00:08.733
that will spoil their immune system

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:11.817
as it is already in a very bad shape.

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.525
Tinned fruit you should never send.

01:00:14.566 --> 01:00:17.525
Any kind of tinned food they're going to throw them out.

01:00:17.566 --> 01:00:22.650
And it's gone so bad, that we had

01:00:22.691 --> 01:00:24.900
to import tinned food for these children to eat.

01:00:24.942 --> 01:00:27.359
"I don't like it. I won't have it."

01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:34.441
So if you really want your children to be strong,

01:00:34.441 --> 01:00:38.942
healthy, wise, sensible Sahaja Yogis then you

01:00:38.983 --> 01:00:43.067
must have wisdom yourself, to be parents.

01:00:43.067 --> 01:00:47.608
These are all Realized Souls born to you. Special blessings.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:55.733
So be kind to them, be nice to them. The harshness

01:00:55.733 --> 01:01:02.566
is not the only, the harshness of showing anger to the children

01:01:02.566 --> 01:01:06.317
but also of showing too much love,

01:01:06.317 --> 01:01:11.942
also is a kind of harshness because it hurts other children,

01:01:11.983 --> 01:01:15.608
also it hurts your child.

01:01:15.608 --> 01:01:17.733
Because that child starts thinking,

01:01:17.733 --> 01:01:20.817
"Oh I'm something very special. I need not study.

01:01:20.858 --> 01:01:26.817
I need not do anything." So there should be a balanced attitude towards the children.

01:01:26.858 --> 01:01:31.608
That's what somebody told Me that you already are booked to go to Dharamshala.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:40.399
I'm sorry, please don't go. They are doing well, they are looked after.

01:01:40.399 --> 01:01:51.858
There's all possibility of their coming down with such beautiful personalities

01:01:51.858 --> 01:01:54.150
that you'll be proud of them.

01:01:54.192 --> 01:02:03.525
Try to understand. Try to realize that whatever effort

01:02:03.525 --> 01:02:08.399
Sahaja Yoga is putting for them should be fully materialized.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:18.025
I hope none of you are sort of, going to disturb them.

01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:22.275
And when you write letters always in the letter you must write,

01:02:22.317 --> 01:02:25.192
"I want you to study very well,

01:02:25.192 --> 01:02:28.525
I want you to come up very well. You are a good Sahaja Yogi."

01:02:28.566 --> 01:02:31.400
Like this instead of that, "I love you very much, I miss you,

01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:35.234
I'm crying morning till evening for you."

01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:42.025
It's not the way. This is Greek tragedy.

01:02:42.067 --> 01:02:46.733
So we have to be encouraging them

01:02:46.775 --> 01:02:51.359
and that you want to see your children to be like this.

01:02:51.399 --> 01:02:54.399
Give them some self-esteem, some vision of their own,

01:02:54.399 --> 01:02:59.775
and you'll see that this will be very encouraging and the teachers will feel very happy.

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:03.650
Because some of the letters when the teachers also read they start crying.

01:03:03.691 --> 01:03:12.525
There's no need to say all these things to your children.

01:03:12.566 --> 01:03:19.942
I mean you are grown-up people. And one child brought a letter,

01:03:19.942 --> 01:03:22.650
"Oh my father and mother both are crying.

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:28.942
What am I to do?" I mean he became the grandfather.

01:03:28.983 --> 01:03:36.359
With all these happenings one has to learn

01:03:36.399 --> 01:03:42.192
that, we are changing the whole world,

01:03:42.234 --> 01:03:44.359
we are changing ourselves

01:03:44.399 --> 01:03:48.275
and our children are going to come up to help us.

01:03:48.317 --> 01:03:50.566
Of course all the children cannot go

01:03:50.608 --> 01:03:55.109
because they think that it's an expensive school or whatever it is.

01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:59.192
We can reduce the fees later on not now.

01:03:59.234 --> 01:04:06.192
Because so many things are to be done for them. There's so much compulsion of teachers, compulsion of this.

01:04:06.234 --> 01:04:15.399
But, if you see that once these children are brought up all right

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.942
it's an experiment,

01:04:16.983 --> 01:04:20.566
then we might be able to start some schools here

01:04:20.608 --> 01:04:28.900
somewhere in a proper way, where children could be educated, properly.

01:04:28.942 --> 01:04:33.858
But here the expense will be much more, that's it.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:40.942
In Rome ashram you have to spend more than you have to spend.

01:04:40.983 --> 01:04:46.399
They can't help it. So expense-wise it will be the same.

01:04:46.399 --> 01:04:50.067
So you have to be reasonable about it,

01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:57.275
and if possible we should try to have some school somewhere.

01:04:57.317 --> 01:05:00.150
I don't know which country will take the responsibility.

01:05:00.192 --> 01:05:04.817
Maybe in Russia would be good idea. Cheaper.

01:05:04.858 --> 01:05:10.525
Let there be food first of all, then they can think about it.

01:05:10.525 --> 01:05:14.399
So it's an experiment

01:05:14.399 --> 01:05:17.650
and you should all try to help, all the school people.

01:05:17.691 --> 01:05:22.691
Now is there any other problem that I have to discuss with you better tell Me.

01:05:22.733 --> 01:05:37.399
So today we are talking about our Resurrection

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.691
through these fourteen planes that are within us.

01:05:41.733 --> 01:05:52.067
One after another. And then we burst through, all these and come up

01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:57.275
as beautiful lotuses. That's what is Easter for,

01:05:57.275 --> 01:06:01.400
is suggestive of eggs being offered

01:06:01.441 --> 01:06:04.400
and these eggs are offered

01:06:04.441 --> 01:06:10.234
so that these eggs can became the birds.

01:06:10.234 --> 01:06:14.691
Thank you.

01:06:14.733 --> 01:06:17.983
May God bless you.
