1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,960
It is so wonderful for your Mother

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,600
to see so many beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,120
on this day of Sahasrara.

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,120
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,960
As you have now good  families, good ashrams, good jobs,

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,960
everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

7
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

8
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,680
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,360
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

10
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,680
may dim out, or may be defective.

11
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,640
So, all the chakras that are within us are to be looked after.

12
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:03,800
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

13
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,120
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

14
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,760
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

15
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,480
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha

16
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,600
and establish Him through your thought,

17
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,680
because now your thought is divine,

18
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,720
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

19
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,800
Here now, you have to know

20
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,720
that in the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

21
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,520
I could not have talked of these things to you,

22
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,840
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

23
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,120
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

24
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,720
Chakra is the Pradesha, is the country,

25
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,960
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

26
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,320
And that's the country.

27
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,920
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

28
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,440
put your feelings towards Him,

29
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:25,360
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

30
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,520
And then to manifest compassion,

31
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,160
you have to ask nothing but one thing, that

32
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,640
"O God of Innocence,

33
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,520
give innocence to all the people of the world."

34
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,400
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

35
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,040
otherwise it is unauthorized asking,

36
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,720
or you can say, you have no right to ask.

37
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,960
So to understand innocence

38
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,880
you should try to understand yourself,

39
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,360
how your mind is working.

40
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,480
When you, say, look at anyone,

41
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,720
do you feel that you should possess that person?

42
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,080
Do you feel unduly attracted,

43
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,160
or something base feeling comes into your mind?

44
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,520
For an innocent person,

45
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,320
when he sees a beautiful person, or a woman,

46
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,720
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

47
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,600
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless

48
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,040
there’s no thought.

49
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,200
So if there is no thought,

50
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,440
there's no question of having any expression of possessiveness

51
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,880
or any kind of a baser feeling.

52
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha,

53
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,760
also unauthorized a little bit, that

54
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,520
"Please make me innocent,

55
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,080
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon, that

56
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:31,560
wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

57
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,840
So that I emit innocence:

58
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,560
when people look at me,

59
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,720
they feel I am innocent."

60
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,160
This is compassion,

61
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,880
the compassion to ask Him

62
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,960
to give you the power of compassion itself.

63
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:36,640
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

64
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,600
the light starts moving horizontally;

65
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,560
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

66
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,080
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

67
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,280
You don't become stupid or childish, but you become child-like.

68
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:33,480
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

69
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,480
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

70
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,160
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

71
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,760
because he puts up a show, it's a deliberation

72
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,600
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified, to impress others.

73
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,640
A child doesn’t put up the show of innocence,

74
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,040
of dignity or anything,

75
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,960
because the child is not aware of deliberations.

76
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,400
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

77
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,360
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

78
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,480
expressing itself on horizontal level,

79
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,520
that you become discreet.

80
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,520
But that is a power, I’m again saying,

81
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,040
the power of discretion you develop.

82
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,040
Now one must understand the difference

83
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,120
between the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

84
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,640
So “the power” means it acts.

85
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,920
For example, you may not speak,

86
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,760
but if you are standing somewhere the discretion itself will act

87
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,400
in the situation.

88
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,880
Like a Sahaja yogi,

89
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,520
supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

90
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,400
is going in a train, and the train has an accident,

91
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,800
mostly it will not have, but has, nobody will die.

92
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,760
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

93
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,600
that acts by itself.

94
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,480
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

95
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,280
but you just become the vehicle, a beautiful clean vehicle

96
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,040
of that discretion.

97
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,800
Then you should believe,

98
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,880
now you are spreading horizontally.
