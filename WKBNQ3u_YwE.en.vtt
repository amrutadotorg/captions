00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.973
Dr Rustom: Atah ṣaḍaṅganyāsa.

00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:10.262
Now we purify the six parts of the body.

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:13.435
Shri Mataji: Yes, we have to
clear the six parts of our body.

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.273
Dr Rustom: First, the heart.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:17.010
Shri Mataji: To the heart.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.080
Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha hitayaya namah

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.839
Dr Rustom: Next the top of the head.

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.598
Shri Mataji: That is, we bow to our heart.

00:00:24.678 --> 00:00:29.395
Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha shirse swaha

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:31.170
Shri Mataji: Sahasrara.

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.685
Dr Rustom: Then the Back Agnya.

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:38.485
OM bhur bhuva swaha shikayaya vashat

00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:41.638
Shri Mataji: ‘Vashat’ is like
this. [Shri Mataji claps her hands]

00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:45.651
That means you bring two
fingers, bring it round and hit it hard,

00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:48.239
on the Sahasrara [on the palm of the hand].

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.170
That is taking out the baddha, you see.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.486
From here, take it out and put
it on the Sahasrara, hit it hard.

00:00:55.566 --> 00:01:00.272
And this is the ‘Samhara Shakti’
of Shri Krishna [destructive power].

00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:04.373
Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha kavacha aham

00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:08.180
Shri Mataji: Kavach. Kavach is bandhan.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.737
Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha netrayaa vashat

00:01:13.817 --> 00:01:17.302
Shri Mataji: You see, eyes are
cleansed; must have clean eyes.

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:23.496
Again, with the clean eyes you again go
back at the Agnya, at the Back and take it down.

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:30.616
Dr Rustom: OM bhur bhuva swaha astra vaphat.

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:35.703
Shri Mataji: Astra. Astra are the
weapons that you have got. Astra vaphat!

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:39.291
[Shri Mataji claps]. Means all
the baddhas should run away.

00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:44.336
Dr Rustom: Now the bandhan: ‘Iti dig bandhan’.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.098
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:49.761
Shri Mataji: Kavach – Kavach is
the cover, Kavach is the cover.

00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:51.048
Dr Rustom: Shield like.

00:01:51.128 --> 00:01:55.204
Shri Mataji: Shield, shield, shield, Kavach.
Kavach is shield, sorry. Kavach is shield!

00:01:55.284 --> 00:02:01.254
[Hindi] And this is bandhan, sorry.

00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:06.658
Dr Rustom: Rigvedah,
yejurvedah, sam-vedah yatharvana

00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:10.947
angeshcha sahitah sarve kalasham tu samashritah

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:21.419
Atra gayatri savitri shanti pushti kare tatha
ayantu deva pujarthan durita kshayakarakaha.
