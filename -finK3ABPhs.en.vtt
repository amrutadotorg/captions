WEBVTT

02:33.283 --> 02:36.523
Welcome to all of you.

02:52.243 --> 02:57.203
This great country is also passing through a crisis.

02:57.403 --> 03:01.483
Nowadays I feel there are so many things that are happening

03:01.683 --> 03:04.803
which you could never dream before.

03:05.003 --> 03:07.963
And at this time you all have arrived

03:08.163 --> 03:12.763
bringing peace and joy to all of them.

03:13.123 --> 03:17.603
So I thank you for that.

03:28.483 --> 03:34.483
The strife and the strain which is on human beings is

03:34.883 --> 03:42.843
perhaps because they are not yet worthy of God's blessings.

03:43.243 --> 03:47.363
Still, as God has created them,

03:48.083 --> 03:51.803
He tries to do His utmost

03:52.083 --> 03:55.163
to see that human beings are kept comfortably

03:55.363 --> 03:58.443
alright on this Mother Earth.

03:58.723 --> 04:02.323
He creates all kinds of beautiful things as you see

04:02.643 --> 04:06.363
and the whole cosmos is in unison

04:06.763 --> 04:11.243
and working out something very great today.

04:11.683 --> 04:15.283
This new revolution that has started,

04:15.843 --> 04:18.963
very, very silently,

04:19.323 --> 04:22.363
today is taking it's shape

04:22.563 --> 04:28.763
and is providing a new future for all of us.

04:29.043 --> 04:33.243
You see those big, big trees, that are on top of your head

04:33.603 --> 04:39.403
and as long as you are sitting here no fruit will fall upon you.

04:39.683 --> 04:41.963
It's not because I am here

04:42.163 --> 04:44.923
but because this Mother Earth knows

04:45.123 --> 04:47.763
that there are such great saints sitting here

04:47.963 --> 04:51.683
and She is not going to disturb.

04:57.403 --> 05:00.803
This place was called as Shrigaav I was told,

05:01.123 --> 05:06.523
means the village of the Goddess.

05:06.883 --> 05:10.723
And this fruit is called as Shriphal,

05:10.923 --> 05:13.683
meaning the fruit of the Goddess.

05:13.963 --> 05:20.323
But actually if you see, a coconut is something like our Sahasrara

05:21.363 --> 05:28.483
and is very auspicious because it can absorb lot of vibrations,

05:29.803 --> 05:32.923
as if it has got its realization.

05:33.123 --> 05:36.003
As you people can absorb My vibrations,

05:36.203 --> 05:41.203
this fruit can absorb also My vibrations,

05:41.923 --> 05:46.203
in the greatest amount.

05:46.483 --> 05:50.403
So we are here today

05:50.603 --> 05:54.283
in a very big way

05:58.883 --> 06:05.123
to advertise the coming of the New Age.

06:06.803 --> 06:11.163
The coming of

06:11.763 --> 06:17.162
the Golden Era, people have talked about.

06:17.603 --> 06:21.043
Here we are to say

06:21.283 --> 06:27.083
what is reality, what is truth, what is joy.

06:27.683 --> 06:33.323
Here we are to manifest that and also

06:37.723 --> 06:43.523
to create a commotion or a movement

06:44.163 --> 06:51.123
in the cosmos so that this new awareness

06:52.083 --> 06:57.323
is established in the cosmos

06:57.683 --> 07:00.963
which will enlighten this country

07:01.163 --> 07:03.963
and the people of this country.

07:04.403 --> 07:09.763
Also you will pick up the threads of this movement within yourself

07:09.963 --> 07:14.923
which is a very subtle movement going on.

07:16.323 --> 07:21.363
At this moment we are in a strife of an intellectual

07:21.563 --> 07:25.363
who tried to describe

07:25.803 --> 07:30.803
Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, in a slurring manner.

07:31.523 --> 07:38.123
And this is the time I want to bring your attention

07:38.563 --> 07:46.523
that if this intellectual strife to use the intelligence

07:46.763 --> 07:53.003
to bring down all the ideals which enlighten our path,

07:53.283 --> 07:57.723
which gives us the guideline and an aspiration,

07:58.203 --> 08:05.243
then our lives become absolutely mundane, useless, joyless.

08:07.643 --> 08:12.292
It's very easy to condemn an ideal life,

08:13.123 --> 08:17.283
but to attain that life is very difficult.

08:18.283 --> 08:21.683
And some people, because they cannot attain it,

08:21.883 --> 08:28.563
try to condemn it so that they feel that they are no less,

08:28.843 --> 08:32.643
no way less than those great lives.

08:35.363 --> 08:40.163
All these ideals are created, these images are created,

08:40.363 --> 08:46.203
everywhere in the world by the Divine power

08:47.843 --> 08:51.643
and people look at them

08:51.843 --> 08:59.123
and think that these great lives are beautiful,

08:59.443 --> 09:05.843
though they have suffered a lot, but there is so much of

09:06.403 --> 09:11.323
deeper understanding

09:11.683 --> 09:18.483
and deeper balancing and a deeper love.

09:21.203 --> 09:28.243
These ideals are very important for human societies

09:28.523 --> 09:32.163
otherwise they will be absolutely living in a relatively

09:32.403 --> 09:38.403
and they will have no absolute measure

09:38.883 --> 09:42.843
to find out what is right and what is wrong.

09:44.923 --> 09:48.123
In Sahaja Yoga we are here first of all

09:48.323 --> 09:50.763
to get connected with God Almighty,

09:50.963 --> 09:55.083
with His power, the All-Pervading Power of Chaitanya.

09:55.523 --> 10:00.763
By that we become our own master,

10:01.083 --> 10:06.563
in the sense that we get our own guidelines.

10:06.843 --> 10:10.003
If some Sahaja Yogi has not achieved that much

10:10.243 --> 10:13.043
then is a serious thing.

10:13.243 --> 10:16.043
At least a Sahaja Yogi should be able to see,

10:16.243 --> 10:22.003
at the minimum of minimum, what is wrong with that person.

10:26.323 --> 10:32.763
To cleanse yourself and to put yourself right is of course,

10:33.363 --> 10:40.083
is a very important duty of every Sahaja Yogi.

10:40.483 --> 10:43.043
But these things are not to be taken

10:43.243 --> 10:46.562
as condemnation of yourself by any chance.

10:46.763 --> 10:50.563
And you should not be identified with those problems that you have

10:50.763 --> 10:57.079
but try to face them and cure them.

10:58.563 --> 11:00.683
Many a times I have heard Sahaja Yogis saying

11:00.883 --> 11:03.283
that Indians are very simple people

11:03.483 --> 11:05.523
they are not complicated, Mother,

11:05.803 --> 11:11.563
so they can achieve their ascent much faster.

11:12.083 --> 11:19.843
But it's not that. It is very different for all of you, very much.

11:20.363 --> 11:23.563
And despite all the complications, and all kinds of brain washing,

11:23.763 --> 11:27.203
and all kinds of book reading and all kinds of so-called seeking,

11:27.403 --> 11:30.603
and all that nonsense one has gone through,

11:30.803 --> 11:33.483
you have come out of it,

11:33.883 --> 11:36.843
you have washed yourself completely

11:37.163 --> 11:44.283
and today you are there united together to face

11:44.563 --> 11:47.243
all that is absurd,

11:47.443 --> 11:51.123
all that is false, all that is wrong.

11:51.923 --> 11:57.683
It has to be a very formidable army for us

11:58.043 --> 12:02.403
because if you see around, even in this country,

12:02.603 --> 12:04.643
you call it not complicated,

12:04.843 --> 12:08.563
there are many who are all the time to complicate others

12:08.803 --> 12:15.443
and to destroy all their ideals, destroy all their visions

12:15.683 --> 12:20.963
and brainwash them.

12:21.563 --> 12:26.083
So you have to be very alert yourself

12:26.283 --> 12:29.443
and you have to be very conscious,

12:29.643 --> 12:36.643
that it is you who is going to build up this great image

12:36.883 --> 12:41.683
of ideal people,

12:41.963 --> 12:48.523
not one ideal life but ideal people in all collectivities.

12:49.203 --> 12:53.723
Now on your way to our tour,

12:53.923 --> 13:00.963
you are now on the threshold of entering into a new dimension,

13:01.603 --> 13:04.523
it is a subtler dimension,

13:05.003 --> 13:10.018
and this subtler dimension is within ourselves.

13:10.643 --> 13:17.203
And there lies your own being as your Spirit.

13:17.923 --> 13:21.323
It sees you as separate,

13:21.723 --> 13:25.803
your Self is separate from yourself.

13:26.083 --> 13:31.923
All these identifications have to be dropped out,

13:32.403 --> 13:35.723
all kinds of misidentifications.

13:36.163 --> 13:41.643
I was reading one of the marriages lists and all that,

13:41.843 --> 13:45.163
somebody says that they will marry Indians,

13:45.363 --> 13:47.683
some say we will not marry Indians,

13:47.883 --> 13:50.043
some say, we will not change the country,

13:50.243 --> 13:54.163
some say they will change the country.

13:58.203 --> 14:03.203
Even after Sahaja Yoga (...)

14:03.523 --> 14:07.723
if we stick on to one country as our own

14:09.003 --> 14:13.523
then I must say that we have to give up those limitations.

14:13.803 --> 14:20.003
The time has come. Of course you have the choice.

14:20.963 --> 14:24.363
Nobody is going to force you to do anything

14:24.563 --> 14:29.403
but it also expresses your personality

14:30.243 --> 14:37.243
that you still are lingering on to these small, small limitations.

14:39.243 --> 14:43.043
As I have told you many a times

14:43.403 --> 14:46.483
God created only one world.

14:46.763 --> 14:51.563
Of course He created varieties just to create beauty.

14:52.083 --> 14:55.803
But how blind we are

14:56.203 --> 15:00.923
that we think we are different people,

15:01.203 --> 15:05.843
we are of different countries, of different races,

15:06.203 --> 15:12.123
of different castes, communities, cities -

15:12.403 --> 15:19.163
then little, little rows, then houses.

15:19.603 --> 15:26.843
I would say we become from human beings to rats and rats to worms

15:27.083 --> 15:32.283
and then I don't know what is the situation later .

15:33.203 --> 15:37.883
Let's open our heart, let's become great,

15:38.323 --> 15:41.323
we have to be like lions,

15:41.643 --> 15:47.483
not to be small and creepy people like worms.

15:47.803 --> 15:51.243
There are many worms everywhere in the world.

15:51.483 --> 15:56.283
We are specially chosen people to be something great.

15:56.723 --> 16:01.723
So open your heart. That's the main problem.

16:02.043 --> 16:05.123
This ego covers the heart

16:05.363 --> 16:10.843
and makes you feel that, “Now I am an Indian, I am a Christian,

16:11.043 --> 16:15.003
I am this thing, I am that thing.”

16:15.523 --> 16:23.403
Now if I say to someone that you are not to go to temple,

16:24.683 --> 16:27.403
then I must be

16:27.683 --> 16:33.123
a very cruel person to say that not to go to a temple.

16:35.923 --> 16:42.003
But they go to a temple and come back with such a big

16:43.763 --> 16:47.283
entity on their heads.

16:48.163 --> 16:50.883
Then they go to churches.

16:51.163 --> 16:53.363
The other day I had a very bad experience of a lady

16:53.563 --> 16:58.243
who went to a church in France

16:58.443 --> 17:01.523
and she has become

17:01.763 --> 17:05.643
something like a minister, maybe something like a pope.

17:06.603 --> 17:11.003
I mean something very funny you know, nothing normal.

17:11.763 --> 17:15.563
I couldn't discover it, when I asked she said, “I went to a church.”

17:15.763 --> 17:20.403
“Why?”
“Because they arranged a marriage there." “Why?”

17:20.723 --> 17:23.003
“Oh, they wanted to have a big social event

17:23.203 --> 17:24.963
so they wanted to have a marriage.”

17:25.163 --> 17:28.403
But you could just have a registered marriage, finish it off.

17:28.643 --> 17:33.683
Why do you want to go to a church, where all dead bodies are buried?

17:35.603 --> 17:39.843
To get back some of them on your heads?

17:40.763 --> 17:42.883
So we have to be prepared to

17:43.123 --> 17:47.883
give up all the shackles of nonsense from our heads.

17:48.643 --> 17:53.563
All kinds of things there are, so much of conditionings

17:54.083 --> 17:57.003
come down even to the colour scheme,

17:57.283 --> 18:00.683
then it's all conditioning.

18:01.403 --> 18:04.643
This is too much, not good!

18:05.003 --> 18:06.723
All funny, funny ideas

18:06.923 --> 18:10.243
and anything funny and nonsensical that comes up,

18:10.483 --> 18:13.283
such funny brains picks it up.

18:13.483 --> 18:18.323
The other day I was telling a lady about her food,

18:18.683 --> 18:23.243
that a new idea has come that you should not eat any salt and sugar,

18:23.523 --> 18:26.243
I mean just imagine!

18:26.483 --> 18:30.363
Salt is so important for our breathing.

18:30.763 --> 18:32.643
If you ask any doctor, I mean,

18:32.843 --> 18:35.883
I don't know what's happening to the doctors!

18:36.283 --> 18:40.763
And sugar is so important for our combustion.

18:41.043 --> 18:45.763
But anybody says anything you people just jump at it

18:46.003 --> 18:50.043
and you people just try to be

18:51.443 --> 18:54.803
impressed by all these ideas,

18:57.163 --> 19:00.763
and start torturing yourself.

19:01.443 --> 19:06.283
Last but not the least I feel now,

19:06.723 --> 19:10.523
I've seen the program on Gnostic,

19:10.763 --> 19:13.723
Gnostic  g-n-o.

19:14.003 --> 19:17.883
And I was thinking, it comes from where g-n-o?

19:18.163 --> 19:22.723
In Sanskrit language 'gnya', 'gnya' we call it.

19:23.003 --> 19:29.363
We call it gnya or gya, anyway, that means 'to know'.

19:29.803 --> 19:32.363
Gnostics means the one who knew.

19:32.563 --> 19:36.683
When St. Thomas came to India, He came via Egypt

19:36.883 --> 19:39.523
and He wrote all about it, what is to know.

19:39.763 --> 19:42.923
And He said, it's a personal experience of everyone,

19:43.123 --> 19:46.243
just He described all Sahaja Yoga there.

19:46.443 --> 19:51.083
And also He said, why should God make you suffer?

19:51.283 --> 19:54.283
He is the most loving and affectionate father,

19:54.483 --> 19:58.323
blasting all ideas of Christianity.

19:59.483 --> 20:03.443
Also so many Hindus believe like that, Muslims believe like that,

20:03.643 --> 20:06.643
that you must suffer.

20:07.603 --> 20:14.643
So now somehow or other the exposure of the truth is also coming up,

20:15.523 --> 20:20.003
and also there is a kind of a turmoil going on,

20:20.283 --> 20:27.243
a kind, I would say a tremendous dynamic effects

20:27.763 --> 20:30.363
are seen on human mind today,

20:30.563 --> 20:34.763
that it starts thinking: 'What is this?'

20:36.523 --> 20:39.403
And you are the answer.

20:39.883 --> 20:44.883
You are the one who is going to convince them.

20:46.403 --> 20:50.363
As somebody was saying that, “Mother, why not we make every year

20:50.563 --> 20:54.803
as a great year of propagation of Sahaja Yoga,

20:55.043 --> 20:58.083
propaganda of Sahaja Yoga, (Hindi word)?”

20:58.803 --> 21:01.803
I said, alright. You want to make a year,

21:02.003 --> 21:04.003
by that if something happens, let us have.

21:04.283 --> 21:06.763
But like our five-year plan in India

21:06.963 --> 21:09.523
I don't want to do all the documentation

21:09.723 --> 21:14.363
and write files and files and files, nothing comes out.

21:16.083 --> 21:19.763
But today if you decide that

21:19.963 --> 21:23.563
we are the ones who have to manifest this greatness on this Earth.

21:23.803 --> 21:26.003
We are the ones who have to do all this.

21:26.203 --> 21:30.123
How can we be weak people? How can we be possessed people?

21:30.323 --> 21:32.403
How can we be fussy people?

21:32.603 --> 21:37.803
How can we be the people who are not saints?

21:41.603 --> 21:44.723
We have to come out of all our pettiness, all our conditionings

21:45.043 --> 21:47.123
and of all the things of our ego,

21:47.363 --> 21:53.083
but not to fight it but through meditation, through witness state.

21:53.323 --> 21:57.123
You have to be the witness now you are travelling.

21:57.323 --> 22:00.323
When you are travelling, normally the witness state

22:00.523 --> 22:03.323
is how to criticize something.

22:03.603 --> 22:06.483
They never see the good points, they'll say, “Oh, look at that,

22:06.683 --> 22:08.723
this colour should not have been used,

22:08.923 --> 22:11.243
that's not good, that's not good.”

22:11.483 --> 22:15.283
What is good is to be seen,

22:15.683 --> 22:20.363
what is good in you, how much good you can have

22:20.683 --> 22:25.203
and what is good in other people.

22:25.483 --> 22:31.123
This time I am telling you that on your way, on your tour,

22:31.483 --> 22:34.763
I hope you will all enjoy it very much more

22:35.163 --> 22:39.283
and you’ll feel the manifestation of your Spirit,

22:39.523 --> 22:42.843
all around you, within you

22:43.123 --> 22:45.763
and in other people.

22:45.963 --> 22:48.883
May God bless you.

22:49.882 --> 22:52.154
Now I was aware of it all

22:52.502 --> 22:53.498
That

22:53.522 --> 22:54.998
One very big

22:55.506 --> 22:57.506
Revolution is happening

22:57.926 --> 22:59.624
And that's about it to London

22:59.799 --> 23:01.079
I had very big lecture in London

23:01.975 --> 23:03.489
That revolution slowly

23:03.902 --> 23:05.729
It was happening
in a good manner

23:06.474 --> 23:08.914
But today she is
coming to your aid

23:10.414 --> 23:14.227
She stands in your head
and you are her opponent

23:15.869 --> 23:16.969
If anyone

23:17.941 --> 23:18.993
Became a Hindu

23:19.017 --> 23:21.564
So he takes the saffron
flag and goes to rent it

23:23.246 --> 23:24.264
If anyone

23:27.819 --> 23:29.621
Buddha became

23:29.811 --> 23:34.263
Know the Buddha

23:36.302 --> 23:39.337
The Buddha who received the light

23:40.083 --> 23:43.652
But the one who considers us
Buddha takes on another flag

23:45.120 --> 23:46.823
But in Sahajayoga

23:47.394 --> 23:49.394
He does not go out
with any flags.

23:51.410 --> 23:52.893
It has its own focus.

23:54.972 --> 23:59.374
Now our first focus in India
is, 'My wife is not okay.

24:01.048 --> 24:03.048
My son has no job.

24:04.144 --> 24:07.812
My son has no job.

24:09.414 --> 24:10.731
and

24:12.239 --> 24:15.295
After we left, our eyes were,

24:18.524 --> 24:21.642
You start looking around,

24:21.667 --> 24:23.667
So those eyes can see

24:24.706 --> 24:27.666
That is what we have
been doing till date

24:28.214 --> 24:29.210
How much it

24:31.368 --> 24:33.070
How poorly it is made.

24:33.998 --> 24:35.437
What a sight!

24:36.215 --> 24:37.823
where is our focous

24:38.918 --> 24:42.206
how can be so
comfortebal in such away

24:43.904 --> 24:44.520
Are you

24:44.972 --> 24:48.228
Yes, who wants to spread the
shadow all over the world

24:48.942 --> 24:52.288
And for all the world to enjoy,

24:53.264 --> 24:56.871
What kind of lights do they use!

24:59.513 --> 25:02.418
Just like the big light
houses on the sea,

25:02.925 --> 25:06.859
how can we do so
easily without you ?

25:08.415 --> 25:11.070
But there is also so little of it

25:12.212 --> 25:15.145
And sometimes I am very surprised
to see that insignificance.

25:17.485 --> 25:19.817
As I said to you
today, I tell you,

25:20.667 --> 25:23.911
That, for the sake of
marriage, girls or boys said,

25:24.172 --> 25:26.927
I want a girl only

25:27.418 --> 25:29.418
Only Maratha's
son should be seen

25:31.021 --> 25:34.014
then what will happen
when he freez ?

25:37.236 --> 25:40.070
Yours! Then, 'Mataji,
this is what happened and that's it

25:40.127 --> 25:41.221
Back to another cry

25:44.903 --> 25:47.759
Then our hope is Mataji
we cannot leave fast

25:48.655 --> 25:49.788
Then Die without food

25:51.629 --> 25:53.075
Why should you tell me

25:54.059 --> 25:59.376
I believe it is best to
be comfortable in a meal.

25:59.423 --> 26:00.782
what is fasting ?

26:01.369 --> 26:04.619
There is a snake, or a
scorpion, that rode on a limb

26:07.691 --> 26:10.237
Such trivial ones

26:10.808 --> 26:12.808
And extremely compressed

26:13.634 --> 26:16.221
Today people of our
country can make

26:16.221 --> 26:19.307
progress evenin
sahajayoga due to tendency

26:19.680 --> 26:23.099
These people say, you are a saint.
Because you are so naive

26:23.124 --> 26:27.980
Such is their opinion. There will be.
You mean I have no disagreement.

26:29.043 --> 26:31.930
But Sahayogi is simply
naive and does not work.

26:34.731 --> 26:38.803
First, we need wisdom and
understanding that we have today

26:39.152 --> 26:40.663
Standing on the edge

26:45.044 --> 26:47.044
These petty ideas.

26:47.330 --> 26:50.303
If we want to get married,
we will do it in our

26:50.328 --> 26:53.239
we are sahajayogi By the way,
we are comfortable with sahajayogi

26:53.532 --> 26:55.688
Will work The word 'walk'
is too much for you.

26:55.974 --> 26:58.083
ok anything will work .
so which are you ?

26:58.108 --> 27:00.128
which king you are,says
everything will work out!

27:01.620 --> 27:04.521
But the word 'walk'
should go smoothly.

27:05.505 --> 27:06.619
What is going on ?

27:08.864 --> 27:12.340
Instead of saying
'okay' or 'okay,'

27:13.134 --> 27:15.134
isn't this all shivaji maharaj ?

27:18.911 --> 27:20.982
Let us take a look at
these things and see

27:20.982 --> 27:23.753
That we have come to Sahajayoga

27:23.754 --> 27:25.855
It's not just for selfish reasons

27:26.514 --> 27:29.485
That is what we came
to find ourselves

27:29.782 --> 27:31.945
For what the mothers
have given to the mother

27:31.970 --> 27:34.085
That we should open
our hands to others

27:36.609 --> 27:39.685
And we should see that
people should enjoy it

27:40.756 --> 27:42.243
They should be given love

27:43.362 --> 27:45.661
But people with
narrow-mindedness

27:45.962 --> 27:51.059
How to cure, then go into the pain
of fun in the room, Mataji Maja

27:51.302 --> 27:52.461
Pain in hand

27:53.016 --> 27:53.937
Will happen

27:55.286 --> 27:57.085
I got a job

27:57.195 --> 27:58.807
The hour went by

27:59.362 --> 28:00.548
Will happen

28:02.484 --> 28:05.838
Do you deserve to be under
the umbrella of your mother?

28:07.402 --> 28:08.237
Think about it

28:08.959 --> 28:10.959
Those fine ideas

28:11.411 --> 28:16.221
And apart from the contractions,
today I believe you are in the desert

28:17.967 --> 28:20.455
If you are wondering whether
fresh baked vegetables

28:20.480 --> 28:22.919
have been cooked in the
house, then it will be hard

28:25.847 --> 28:27.847
That's your wackiness

28:28.965 --> 28:32.024
Increased views and hours
are mind-blowingly great

28:33.984 --> 28:36.538
You belong to this
religion of that religion

28:36.657 --> 28:38.308
We are not of any religion

28:40.093 --> 28:41.355
Religion is ours

28:47.410 --> 28:49.147
We belong to no one's religion

28:49.433 --> 28:52.459
We are yogis what religion
do we mother to religion

28:52.515 --> 28:55.397
With a bit of it those
who are practicing this

28:55.738 --> 28:57.534
Let the days of
snake-eating come now

28:58.240 --> 29:00.634
Diagnostics Let
Your Kids Have Fun

29:03.396 --> 29:05.396
Many styling your

29:05.760 --> 29:08.093
Cut out the bad ideas.

29:11.394 --> 29:14.583
Unless you eliminate
those petty ideas

29:15.503 --> 29:16.458
by then

29:18.172 --> 29:22.718
If a kite is tie with
stone, it cannot fly

29:24.194 --> 29:25.327
Your flight

29:26.818 --> 29:27.613
Could not happen

29:29.009 --> 29:30.006
Just like our lives

29:30.609 --> 29:31.800
We are done

29:32.934 --> 29:33.899
In all

29:34.755 --> 29:36.084
In terms of content

29:36.973 --> 29:38.174
Sahajayoga  stands.

29:40.428 --> 29:42.060
And your All

29:42.679 --> 29:44.679
The kingdom of God is brought.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.742
But it should be
worth sitting there.

29:48.931 --> 29:50.653
Thoughts should be independent

29:51.161 --> 29:54.983
Thinking that I got into
this clan I thought something

29:55.165 --> 29:57.165
Maratha of 96 clan

29:57.355 --> 29:58.901
Or I become brahmin

30:00.814 --> 30:02.814
Content is all over us

30:04.934 --> 30:05.863
liar again.

30:06.092 --> 30:07.045
With credit

30:08.640 --> 30:10.640
Ashamed of sahajayogi

30:12.584 --> 30:14.037
I am sahajayogi

30:14.473 --> 30:15.769
I'm free.

30:16.538 --> 30:19.764
I'm on the alert.
You told me something

30:20.386 --> 30:21.788
And I'm not gonna do it

30:22.542 --> 30:24.542
I stand at liberty

30:24.915 --> 30:26.915
I have autocorrect enabled

30:27.208 --> 30:28.821
You don't teach me anything

30:33.471 --> 30:35.630
Get away from all relations

30:36.558 --> 30:40.745
You will not be able to come up
like lotus until you swallow it all

30:41.324 --> 30:44.957
Until then your anything
No use and no fun

30:50.139 --> 30:52.139
Now, if we have a
campaign like this

30:55.647 --> 31:00.552
In Pune, Come at Savarkar Statue

31:02.560 --> 31:03.724
so what you do there ?

31:06.842 --> 31:08.403
So there were
thousands of people

31:09.768 --> 31:11.113
Unpleasantness

31:11.620 --> 31:12.648
If you want to teach

31:12.648 --> 31:14.898
Thousands of people will leave

31:15.107 --> 31:16.499
Run away

31:17.166 --> 31:18.747
Because there is Unpleasantness

31:21.072 --> 31:23.072
But in the court of love

31:23.865 --> 31:25.865
Get rid of it all.

31:26.159 --> 31:31.036
It is not ready.
All of this wears off in the dirt

31:35.487 --> 31:37.487
By breaking into this paradigm

31:39.051 --> 31:41.051
Stand in Sahajayoga

31:41.883 --> 31:43.395
It should not weak

31:44.633 --> 31:46.270
It should be strong

31:47.357 --> 31:48.352
This is new

31:48.852 --> 31:50.852
Such people should
be raised today

31:51.566 --> 31:55.533
thousands of mahatma gandhi
Thousands of lenin were raised

31:58.972 --> 32:01.657
thousands of like Abraham Lincoln
were raise like People should say

32:03.022 --> 32:04.606
But there is no difference

32:05.812 --> 32:08.482
That is what the nose,
the mouth and the feet are like

32:09.505 --> 32:11.505
Just look at how far the
soul has reached the light

32:14.227 --> 32:18.374
And we are saints,
we are saints.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.405
All this is a disorder

32:22.849 --> 32:24.849
It's a stigma for us

32:25.515 --> 32:30.669
We will break it down,religion and
all and forget about everything

32:31.946 --> 32:34.055
Unless you decide to

32:34.468 --> 32:36.468
You will not benefit at
all in the sahajayoga

32:37.062 --> 32:39.062
And for us too, it's Trouble

32:42.855 --> 32:44.289
Let's get bigger

32:45.360 --> 32:47.360
The sea went anywhere

32:47.764 --> 32:49.119
That nobody is in the mind

32:49.563 --> 32:52.274
That is our sea of Alibaug

32:54.052 --> 32:55.650
or is a Mumbai sea

32:56.705 --> 32:58.311
The ocean is ocean

32:58.668 --> 33:00.267
Such a saint is a saint

33:01.504 --> 33:03.198
Which is a sign of saint and

33:03.832 --> 33:06.749
The main symptom of this
is that apprehension

33:07.203 --> 33:08.616
Artificial

33:09.648 --> 33:12.898
Beyond the artificial
small shrines

33:13.835 --> 33:15.035
Their vision is relaxed

33:15.685 --> 33:17.036
Very endearing

33:19.988 --> 33:24.916
At that time as a call for
cooperation, the whole world refuses

33:25.717 --> 33:27.379
The key is how we
become what you are

33:29.426 --> 33:31.426
We are gonna do
whatever you want

33:32.235 --> 33:34.727
We are this we are that

33:35.647 --> 33:37.136
Who are you lets see

33:38.318 --> 33:40.318
So what do we do

33:42.548 --> 33:45.230
Just get rid of this
illusion of stupidity

33:46.397 --> 33:48.397
You can remove
this with kundalini

33:48.849 --> 33:51.817
Today they are cheearing
me for Adi Shakti ,so do it

33:53.126 --> 33:55.647
What happen with it but
what is the benefit.

33:58.805 --> 34:00.152
If ours

34:00.731 --> 34:01.806
In cheers

34:02.876 --> 34:04.330
You forget all

34:05.028 --> 34:07.028
Are under our mother's feet

34:07.861 --> 34:10.030
And this universe is made by her

34:11.220 --> 34:15.599
We are special sahajayogi
from that world

34:16.234 --> 34:17.838
If you think about it

34:19.012 --> 34:21.012
Then your own
perception will change

34:21.615 --> 34:22.796
And about self

34:23.279 --> 34:25.029
Whichever is wrong ideas

34:25.386 --> 34:26.745
they fix it

34:27.094 --> 34:28.301
Among themselves

34:28.960 --> 34:29.724
love

34:31.176 --> 34:34.465
Not only that, but huge power

34:35.719 --> 34:37.485
One is living among themselves

34:37.826 --> 34:38.567
Be aware of that

34:39.400 --> 34:41.400
And we with a great power

34:41.646 --> 34:43.040
Come together

34:43.405 --> 34:44.677
And with this power

34:45.121 --> 34:47.121
You will notice that
We are about to be saved

34:50.435 --> 34:53.690
Today some hindi language
known people who has come so

34:53.909 --> 34:59.914
I always told to Marathi people
That you try to learn Hindi

34:59.914 --> 35:02.902
Because its your
national language but

35:02.902 --> 35:04.405
Will have to say to
Hindi people also

35:04.406 --> 35:07.412
Is it good to learn
a little Marathi

35:07.412 --> 35:13.160
Although I think that The Marathi
language is a bit too powerful

35:13.160 --> 35:18.157
And its depth can not come in
any language okey leave Sanskrit

35:18.181 --> 35:21.662
After this any
Colloquial language has

35:21.662 --> 35:28.280
For Kundalini Marathi language
is very smooth and very

35:31.535 --> 35:32.872
In use

35:33.159 --> 35:36.475
However, the place of
Hindi language is very high

35:36.500 --> 35:39.658
and ever Marathi people
should know Hindi language

35:39.658 --> 35:41.789
Similarly, you people also
have a Marathi Language

35:41.813 --> 35:43.661
learning should not be difficult

35:43.662 --> 35:47.658
What am I talking about today

35:47.658 --> 35:50.408
That of the big revolution
We stand on the post

35:50.408 --> 35:56.406
Right now in front of us
It is a big request that

35:57.099 --> 36:01.349
We are sahajayogi
Have earned yoga

36:01.662 --> 36:08.406
we are not like that Which
are full of dirty thoughts

36:08.406 --> 36:11.108
Who do not love each other

36:11.132 --> 36:15.356
and one Have violent
tendencies towards each other

36:15.408 --> 36:19.905
We are yogis We gonna
join all over the world

36:19.905 --> 36:24.160
We are especially representative

36:24.160 --> 36:29.719
And we are saints and the
characteristics of saints

36:29.719 --> 36:32.972
Its in us Must seen

36:33.159 --> 36:36.459
When it show everyone

36:36.459 --> 36:39.456
It will be understood that
Sahaja Yoga is a special thing

36:39.932 --> 36:42.408
Otherwise people will think
that your sahajayogi then what?

36:42.408 --> 36:45.163
Your habits are the same
Your ways are the same

36:45.163 --> 36:49.659
You fight likewise The
group bet is the same in you

36:49.659 --> 36:52.161
All your values
Like that of others

36:52.161 --> 36:55.161
So what about Sahaja Yoga?

36:55.161 --> 36:59.660
In Sahaja Yoga we have
externally Received nothing

36:59.660 --> 37:04.158
But the strong power
inside We live in

37:04.562 --> 37:10.059
And all our world
have this power today

37:10.059 --> 37:14.061
See that The power is
inhabited by all of us.

37:14.061 --> 37:20.556
It is roaming inside us Her
beautiful environment inside

37:20.556 --> 37:23.039
Made up and mutual
love and we know

37:23.386 --> 37:30.635
Not so much, every
moment, Power feeds us

37:30.635 --> 37:33.782
Binds us to each other

37:33.893 --> 37:38.028
This power is the formula of
the whole world that we got

37:38.028 --> 37:43.526
And when we found it We
do such useless things

37:43.526 --> 37:49.030
Of course Ready to destroy life

37:49.235 --> 37:54.734
We have to evaluate ourselves Will
have to know what is our value

37:54.734 --> 37:58.490
And what did we
understand our life

38:00.492 --> 38:02.239
I see that

38:02.239 --> 38:05.236
To quarrel is a human nature

38:05.236 --> 38:07.735
Whatever happens to
him They start fighting

38:07.735 --> 38:10.986
Like this with dog
cat I am not even seen

38:11.488 --> 38:13.987
If anything happens It
becomes a matter of quarrel

38:13.987 --> 38:19.238
Even if love is something
Sahaja Yoga is only for love

38:20.487 --> 38:24.327
Movement just love movement

38:24.351 --> 38:27.081
And you are sitting
in the same movement

38:27.489 --> 38:35.239
A very beautiful and very sweet
This is the environment I travel to

38:36.721 --> 38:41.467
But it can happen when
your subtlety Be so deep

38:41.842 --> 38:48.091
That we can see that we are
representative of divine

38:48.711 --> 38:52.708
Divine doing this job
from us What a great thing

38:52.837 --> 38:55.339
To achieve this unique thing

38:55.339 --> 39:01.337
You need to be aware of yourself
Be and be your own personality

39:01.337 --> 39:05.057
Give her such a
huge strain Tease

39:05.057 --> 39:09.086
Today is the first day
When everyone has come

39:09.086 --> 39:13.587
See how well everyone is sitting It is
a matter of great pride for a mother.

39:13.587 --> 39:16.587
That all my children here
are gathered from the world

39:18.840 --> 39:24.836
But every time I want
that you become aware

39:24.836 --> 39:28.088
You have to know that Mother
is doing very big revolution

39:42.774 --> 39:44.330
You guys

39:45.409 --> 39:47.409
Watch you wake up

39:47.845 --> 39:49.845
That our mother

39:49.900 --> 39:51.290
That is a very big achievement

39:51.964 --> 39:53.964
Which will wipe out all the universe

39:55.075 --> 39:57.607
This is a very big achievement

39:58.305 --> 40:00.305
Is doing and you

40:00.598 --> 40:02.199
We are in limbo.

40:03.951 --> 40:09.036
May god bless you
