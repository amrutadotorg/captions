00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:36.523
Welcome to all of you.

00:02:52.243 --> 00:02:57.203
This great country is also passing through a crisis.

00:02:57.403 --> 00:03:01.483
Nowadays I feel there are so many things that are happening

00:03:01.683 --> 00:03:04.803
which you could never dream before.

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:07.963
And at this time you all have arrived

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:12.763
bringing peace and joy to all of them.

00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:17.603
So I thank you for that.

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:34.483
The strife and the strain which is on human beings is

00:03:34.883 --> 00:03:42.843
perhaps because they are not yet worthy of God's blessings.

00:03:43.243 --> 00:03:47.363
Still, as God has created them,

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:51.803
He tries to do His utmost

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:55.163
to see that human beings are kept comfortably

00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:58.443
alright on this Mother Earth.

00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:02.323
He creates all kinds of beautiful things as you see

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:06.363
and the whole cosmos is in unison

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:11.243
and working out something very great today.

00:04:11.683 --> 00:04:15.283
This new revolution that has started,

00:04:15.843 --> 00:04:18.963
very, very silently,

00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:22.363
today is taking it's shape

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:28.763
and is providing a new future for all of us.

00:04:29.043 --> 00:04:33.243
You see those big, big trees, that are on top of your head

00:04:33.603 --> 00:04:39.403
and as long as you are sitting here no fruit will fall upon you.

00:04:39.683 --> 00:04:41.963
It's not because I am here

00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:44.923
but because this Mother Earth knows

00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:47.763
that there are such great saints sitting here

00:04:47.963 --> 00:04:51.683
and She is not going to disturb.

00:04:57.403 --> 00:05:00.803
This place was called as Shrigaav I was told,

00:05:01.123 --> 00:05:06.523
means the village of the Goddess.

00:05:06.883 --> 00:05:10.723
And this fruit is called as Shriphal,

00:05:10.923 --> 00:05:13.683
meaning the fruit of the Goddess.

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:20.323
But actually if you see, a coconut is something like our Sahasrara

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:28.483
and is very auspicious because it can absorb lot of vibrations,

00:05:29.803 --> 00:05:32.923
as if it has got its realization.

00:05:33.123 --> 00:05:36.003
As you people can absorb My vibrations,

00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:41.203
this fruit can absorb also My vibrations,

00:05:41.923 --> 00:05:46.203
in the greatest amount.

00:05:46.483 --> 00:05:50.403
So we are here today

00:05:50.603 --> 00:05:54.283
in a very big way

00:05:58.883 --> 00:06:05.123
to advertise the coming of the New Age.

00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:11.163
The coming of

00:06:11.763 --> 00:06:17.162
the Golden Era, people have talked about.

00:06:17.603 --> 00:06:21.043
Here we are to say

00:06:21.283 --> 00:06:27.083
what is reality, what is truth, what is joy.

00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:33.323
Here we are to manifest that and also

00:06:37.723 --> 00:06:43.523
to create a commotion or a movement

00:06:44.163 --> 00:06:51.123
in the cosmos so that this new awareness

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:57.323
is established in the cosmos

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.963
which will enlighten this country

00:07:01.163 --> 00:07:03.963
and the people of this country.

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:09.763
Also you will pick up the threads of this movement within yourself

00:07:09.963 --> 00:07:14.923
which is a very subtle movement going on.

00:07:16.323 --> 00:07:21.363
At this moment we are in a strife of an intellectual

00:07:21.563 --> 00:07:25.363
who tried to describe

00:07:25.803 --> 00:07:30.803
Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, in a slurring manner.

00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:38.123
And this is the time I want to bring your attention

00:07:38.563 --> 00:07:46.523
that if this intellectual strife to use the intelligence

00:07:46.763 --> 00:07:53.003
to bring down all the ideals which enlighten our path,

00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:57.723
which gives us the guideline and an aspiration,

00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:05.243
then our lives become absolutely mundane, useless, joyless.

00:08:07.643 --> 00:08:12.292
It's very easy to condemn an ideal life,

00:08:13.123 --> 00:08:17.283
but to attain that life is very difficult.

00:08:18.283 --> 00:08:21.683
And some people, because they cannot attain it,

00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:28.563
try to condemn it so that they feel that they are no less,

00:08:28.843 --> 00:08:32.643
no way less than those great lives.

00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:40.163
All these ideals are created, these images are created,

00:08:40.363 --> 00:08:46.203
everywhere in the world by the Divine power

00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:51.643
and people look at them

00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:59.123
and think that these great lives are beautiful,

00:08:59.443 --> 00:09:05.843
though they have suffered a lot, but there is so much of

00:09:06.403 --> 00:09:11.323
deeper understanding

00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:18.483
and deeper balancing and a deeper love.

00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:28.243
These ideals are very important for human societies

00:09:28.523 --> 00:09:32.163
otherwise they will be absolutely living in a relatively

00:09:32.403 --> 00:09:38.403
and they will have no absolute measure

00:09:38.883 --> 00:09:42.843
to find out what is right and what is wrong.

00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:48.123
In Sahaja Yoga we are here first of all

00:09:48.323 --> 00:09:50.763
to get connected with God Almighty,

00:09:50.963 --> 00:09:55.083
with His power, the All-Pervading Power of Chaitanya.

00:09:55.523 --> 00:10:00.763
By that we become our own master,

00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:06.563
in the sense that we get our own guidelines.

00:10:06.843 --> 00:10:10.003
If some Sahaja Yogi has not achieved that much

00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:13.043
then is a serious thing.

00:10:13.243 --> 00:10:16.043
At least a Sahaja Yogi should be able to see,

00:10:16.243 --> 00:10:22.003
at the minimum of minimum, what is wrong with that person.

00:10:26.323 --> 00:10:32.763
To cleanse yourself and to put yourself right is of course,

00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:40.083
is a very important duty of every Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:40.483 --> 00:10:43.043
But these things are not to be taken

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:46.562
as condemnation of yourself by any chance.

00:10:46.763 --> 00:10:50.563
And you should not be identified with those problems that you have

00:10:50.763 --> 00:10:57.079
but try to face them and cure them.

00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:00.683
Many a times I have heard Sahaja Yogis saying

00:11:00.883 --> 00:11:03.283
that Indians are very simple people

00:11:03.483 --> 00:11:05.523
they are not complicated, Mother,

00:11:05.803 --> 00:11:11.563
so they can achieve their ascent much faster.

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:19.843
But it's not that. It is very different for all of you, very much.

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:23.563
And despite all the complications, and all kinds of brain washing,

00:11:23.763 --> 00:11:27.203
and all kinds of book reading and all kinds of so-called seeking,

00:11:27.403 --> 00:11:30.603
and all that nonsense one has gone through,

00:11:30.803 --> 00:11:33.483
you have come out of it,

00:11:33.883 --> 00:11:36.843
you have washed yourself completely

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:44.283
and today you are there united together to face

00:11:44.563 --> 00:11:47.243
all that is absurd,

00:11:47.443 --> 00:11:51.123
all that is false, all that is wrong.

00:11:51.923 --> 00:11:57.683
It has to be a very formidable army for us

00:11:58.043 --> 00:12:02.403
because if you see around, even in this country,

00:12:02.603 --> 00:12:04.643
you call it not complicated,

00:12:04.843 --> 00:12:08.563
there are many who are all the time to complicate others

00:12:08.803 --> 00:12:15.443
and to destroy all their ideals, destroy all their visions

00:12:15.683 --> 00:12:20.963
and brainwash them.

00:12:21.563 --> 00:12:26.083
So you have to be very alert yourself

00:12:26.283 --> 00:12:29.443
and you have to be very conscious,

00:12:29.643 --> 00:12:36.643
that it is you who is going to build up this great image

00:12:36.883 --> 00:12:41.683
of ideal people,

00:12:41.963 --> 00:12:48.523
not one ideal life but ideal people in all collectivities.

00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:53.723
Now on your way to our tour,

00:12:53.923 --> 00:13:00.963
you are now on the threshold of entering into a new dimension,

00:13:01.603 --> 00:13:04.523
it is a subtler dimension,

00:13:05.003 --> 00:13:10.018
and this subtler dimension is within ourselves.

00:13:10.643 --> 00:13:17.203
And there lies your own being as your Spirit.

00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:21.323
It sees you as separate,

00:13:21.723 --> 00:13:25.803
your Self is separate from yourself.

00:13:26.083 --> 00:13:31.923
All these identifications have to be dropped out,

00:13:32.403 --> 00:13:35.723
all kinds of misidentifications.

00:13:36.163 --> 00:13:41.643
I was reading one of the marriages lists and all that,

00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:45.163
somebody says that they will marry Indians,

00:13:45.363 --> 00:13:47.683
some say we will not marry Indians,

00:13:47.883 --> 00:13:50.043
some say, we will not change the country,

00:13:50.243 --> 00:13:54.163
some say they will change the country.

00:13:58.203 --> 00:14:03.203
Even after Sahaja Yoga (...)

00:14:03.523 --> 00:14:07.723
if we stick on to one country as our own

00:14:09.003 --> 00:14:13.523
then I must say that we have to give up those limitations.

00:14:13.803 --> 00:14:20.003
The time has come. Of course you have the choice.

00:14:20.963 --> 00:14:24.363
Nobody is going to force you to do anything

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:29.403
but it also expresses your personality

00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:37.243
that you still are lingering on to these small, small limitations.

00:14:39.243 --> 00:14:43.043
As I have told you many a times

00:14:43.403 --> 00:14:46.483
God created only one world.

00:14:46.763 --> 00:14:51.563
Of course He created varieties just to create beauty.

00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:55.803
But how blind we are

00:14:56.203 --> 00:15:00.923
that we think we are different people,

00:15:01.203 --> 00:15:05.843
we are of different countries, of different races,

00:15:06.203 --> 00:15:12.123
of different castes, communities, cities -

00:15:12.403 --> 00:15:19.163
then little, little rows, then houses.

00:15:19.603 --> 00:15:26.843
I would say we become from human beings to rats and rats to worms

00:15:27.083 --> 00:15:32.283
and then I don't know what is the situation later .

00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:37.883
Let's open our heart, let's become great,

00:15:38.323 --> 00:15:41.323
we have to be like lions,

00:15:41.643 --> 00:15:47.483
not to be small and creepy people like worms.

00:15:47.803 --> 00:15:51.243
There are many worms everywhere in the world.

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:56.283
We are specially chosen people to be something great.

00:15:56.723 --> 00:16:01.723
So open your heart. That's the main problem.

00:16:02.043 --> 00:16:05.123
This ego covers the heart

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:10.843
and makes you feel that, “Now I am an Indian, I am a Christian,

00:16:11.043 --> 00:16:15.003
I am this thing, I am that thing.”

00:16:15.523 --> 00:16:23.403
Now if I say to someone that you are not to go to temple,

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:27.403
then I must be

00:16:27.683 --> 00:16:33.123
a very cruel person to say that not to go to a temple.

00:16:35.923 --> 00:16:42.003
But they go to a temple and come back with such a big

00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:47.283
entity on their heads.

00:16:48.163 --> 00:16:50.883
Then they go to churches.

00:16:51.163 --> 00:16:53.363
The other day I had a very bad experience of a lady

00:16:53.563 --> 00:16:58.243
who went to a church in France

00:16:58.443 --> 00:17:01.523
and she has become

00:17:01.763 --> 00:17:05.643
something like a minister, maybe something like a pope.

00:17:06.603 --> 00:17:11.003
I mean something very funny you know, nothing normal.

00:17:11.763 --> 00:17:15.563
I couldn't discover it, when I asked she said, “I went to a church.”

00:17:15.763 --> 00:17:20.403
“Why?”
“Because they arranged a marriage there." “Why?”

00:17:20.723 --> 00:17:23.003
“Oh, they wanted to have a big social event

00:17:23.203 --> 00:17:24.963
so they wanted to have a marriage.”

00:17:25.163 --> 00:17:28.403
But you could just have a registered marriage, finish it off.

00:17:28.643 --> 00:17:33.683
Why do you want to go to a church, where all dead bodies are buried?

00:17:35.603 --> 00:17:39.843
To get back some of them on your heads?

00:17:40.763 --> 00:17:42.883
So we have to be prepared to

00:17:43.123 --> 00:17:47.883
give up all the shackles of nonsense from our heads.

00:17:48.643 --> 00:17:53.563
All kinds of things there are, so much of conditionings

00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:57.003
come down even to the colour scheme,

00:17:57.283 --> 00:18:00.683
then it's all conditioning.

00:18:01.403 --> 00:18:04.643
This is too much, not good!

00:18:05.003 --> 00:18:06.723
All funny, funny ideas

00:18:06.923 --> 00:18:10.243
and anything funny and nonsensical that comes up,

00:18:10.483 --> 00:18:13.283
such funny brains picks it up.

00:18:13.483 --> 00:18:18.323
The other day I was telling a lady about her food,

00:18:18.683 --> 00:18:23.243
that a new idea has come that you should not eat any salt and sugar,

00:18:23.523 --> 00:18:26.243
I mean just imagine!

00:18:26.483 --> 00:18:30.363
Salt is so important for our breathing.

00:18:30.763 --> 00:18:32.643
If you ask any doctor, I mean,

00:18:32.843 --> 00:18:35.883
I don't know what's happening to the doctors!

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:40.763
And sugar is so important for our combustion.

00:18:41.043 --> 00:18:45.763
But anybody says anything you people just jump at it

00:18:46.003 --> 00:18:50.043
and you people just try to be

00:18:51.443 --> 00:18:54.803
impressed by all these ideas,

00:18:57.163 --> 00:19:00.763
and start torturing yourself.

00:19:01.443 --> 00:19:06.283
Last but not the least I feel now,

00:19:06.723 --> 00:19:10.523
I've seen the program on Gnostic,

00:19:10.763 --> 00:19:13.723
Gnostic  g-n-o.

00:19:14.003 --> 00:19:17.883
And I was thinking, it comes from where g-n-o?

00:19:18.163 --> 00:19:22.723
In Sanskrit language 'gnya', 'gnya' we call it.

00:19:23.003 --> 00:19:29.363
We call it gnya or gya, anyway, that means 'to know'.

00:19:29.803 --> 00:19:32.363
Gnostics means the one who knew.

00:19:32.563 --> 00:19:36.683
When St. Thomas came to India, He came via Egypt

00:19:36.883 --> 00:19:39.523
and He wrote all about it, what is to know.

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:42.923
And He said, it's a personal experience of everyone,

00:19:43.123 --> 00:19:46.243
just He described all Sahaja Yoga there.

00:19:46.443 --> 00:19:51.083
And also He said, why should God make you suffer?

00:19:51.283 --> 00:19:54.283
He is the most loving and affectionate father,

00:19:54.483 --> 00:19:58.323
blasting all ideas of Christianity.

00:19:59.483 --> 00:20:03.443
Also so many Hindus believe like that, Muslims believe like that,

00:20:03.643 --> 00:20:06.643
that you must suffer.

00:20:07.603 --> 00:20:14.643
So now somehow or other the exposure of the truth is also coming up,

00:20:15.523 --> 00:20:20.003
and also there is a kind of a turmoil going on,

00:20:20.283 --> 00:20:27.243
a kind, I would say a tremendous dynamic effects

00:20:27.763 --> 00:20:30.363
are seen on human mind today,

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:34.763
that it starts thinking: 'What is this?'

00:20:36.523 --> 00:20:39.403
And you are the answer.

00:20:39.883 --> 00:20:44.883
You are the one who is going to convince them.

00:20:46.403 --> 00:20:50.363
As somebody was saying that, “Mother, why not we make every year

00:20:50.563 --> 00:20:54.803
as a great year of propagation of Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:55.043 --> 00:20:58.083
propaganda of Sahaja Yoga, (Hindi word)?”

00:20:58.803 --> 00:21:01.803
I said, alright. You want to make a year,

00:21:02.003 --> 00:21:04.003
by that if something happens, let us have.

00:21:04.283 --> 00:21:06.763
But like our five-year plan in India

00:21:06.963 --> 00:21:09.523
I don't want to do all the documentation

00:21:09.723 --> 00:21:14.363
and write files and files and files, nothing comes out.

00:21:16.083 --> 00:21:19.763
But today if you decide that

00:21:19.963 --> 00:21:23.563
we are the ones who have to manifest this greatness on this Earth.

00:21:23.803 --> 00:21:26.003
We are the ones who have to do all this.

00:21:26.203 --> 00:21:30.123
How can we be weak people? How can we be possessed people?

00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:32.403
How can we be fussy people?

00:21:32.603 --> 00:21:37.803
How can we be the people who are not saints?

00:21:41.603 --> 00:21:44.723
We have to come out of all our pettiness, all our conditionings

00:21:45.043 --> 00:21:47.123
and of all the things of our ego,

00:21:47.363 --> 00:21:53.083
but not to fight it but through meditation, through witness state.

00:21:53.323 --> 00:21:57.123
You have to be the witness now you are travelling.

00:21:57.323 --> 00:22:00.323
When you are travelling, normally the witness state

00:22:00.523 --> 00:22:03.323
is how to criticize something.

00:22:03.603 --> 00:22:06.483
They never see the good points, they'll say, “Oh, look at that,

00:22:06.683 --> 00:22:08.723
this colour should not have been used,

00:22:08.923 --> 00:22:11.243
that's not good, that's not good.”

00:22:11.483 --> 00:22:15.283
What is good is to be seen,

00:22:15.683 --> 00:22:20.363
what is good in you, how much good you can have

00:22:20.683 --> 00:22:25.203
and what is good in other people.

00:22:25.483 --> 00:22:31.123
This time I am telling you that on your way, on your tour,

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:34.763
I hope you will all enjoy it very much more

00:22:35.163 --> 00:22:39.283
and you’ll feel the manifestation of your Spirit,

00:22:39.523 --> 00:22:42.843
all around you, within you

00:22:43.123 --> 00:22:45.763
and in other people.

00:22:45.963 --> 00:22:48.883
May God bless you.

00:22:49.882 --> 00:22:52.154
Now I was aware of it all

00:22:52.502 --> 00:22:53.498
That

00:22:53.522 --> 00:22:54.998
One very big

00:22:55.506 --> 00:22:57.506
Revolution is happening

00:22:57.926 --> 00:22:59.624
And that's about it to London

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:01.079
I had very big lecture in London

00:23:01.975 --> 00:23:03.489
That revolution slowly

00:23:03.902 --> 00:23:05.729
It was happening
in a good manner

00:23:06.474 --> 00:23:08.914
But today she is
coming to your aid

00:23:10.414 --> 00:23:14.227
She stands in your head
and you are her opponent

00:23:15.869 --> 00:23:16.969
If anyone

00:23:17.941 --> 00:23:18.993
Became a Hindu

00:23:19.017 --> 00:23:21.564
So he takes the saffron
flag and goes to rent it

00:23:23.246 --> 00:23:24.264
If anyone

00:23:27.819 --> 00:23:29.621
Buddha became

00:23:29.811 --> 00:23:34.263
Know the Buddha

00:23:36.302 --> 00:23:39.337
The Buddha who received the light

00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:43.652
But the one who considers us
Buddha takes on another flag

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.823
But in Sahajayoga

00:23:47.394 --> 00:23:49.394
He does not go out
with any flags.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.893
It has its own focus.

00:23:54.972 --> 00:23:59.374
Now our first focus in India
is, 'My wife is not okay.

00:24:01.048 --> 00:24:03.048
My son has no job.

00:24:04.144 --> 00:24:07.812
My son has no job.

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:10.731
and

00:24:12.239 --> 00:24:15.295
After we left, our eyes were,

00:24:18.524 --> 00:24:21.642
You start looking around,

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.667
So those eyes can see

00:24:24.706 --> 00:24:27.666
That is what we have
been doing till date

00:24:28.214 --> 00:24:29.210
How much it

00:24:31.368 --> 00:24:33.070
How poorly it is made.

00:24:33.998 --> 00:24:35.437
What a sight!

00:24:36.215 --> 00:24:37.823
where is our focous

00:24:38.918 --> 00:24:42.206
how can be so
comfortebal in such away

00:24:43.904 --> 00:24:44.520
Are you

00:24:44.972 --> 00:24:48.228
Yes, who wants to spread the
shadow all over the world

00:24:48.942 --> 00:24:52.288
And for all the world to enjoy,

00:24:53.264 --> 00:24:56.871
What kind of lights do they use!

00:24:59.513 --> 00:25:02.418
Just like the big light
houses on the sea,

00:25:02.925 --> 00:25:06.859
how can we do so
easily without you ?

00:25:08.415 --> 00:25:11.070
But there is also so little of it

00:25:12.212 --> 00:25:15.145
And sometimes I am very surprised
to see that insignificance.

00:25:17.485 --> 00:25:19.817
As I said to you
today, I tell you,

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:23.911
That, for the sake of
marriage, girls or boys said,

00:25:24.172 --> 00:25:26.927
I want a girl only

00:25:27.418 --> 00:25:29.418
Only Maratha's
son should be seen

00:25:31.021 --> 00:25:34.014
then what will happen
when he freez ?

00:25:37.236 --> 00:25:40.070
Yours! Then, 'Mataji,
this is what happened and that's it

00:25:40.127 --> 00:25:41.221
Back to another cry

00:25:44.903 --> 00:25:47.759
Then our hope is Mataji
we cannot leave fast

00:25:48.655 --> 00:25:49.788
Then Die without food

00:25:51.629 --> 00:25:53.075
Why should you tell me

00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:59.376
I believe it is best to
be comfortable in a meal.

00:25:59.423 --> 00:26:00.782
what is fasting ?

00:26:01.369 --> 00:26:04.619
There is a snake, or a
scorpion, that rode on a limb

00:26:07.691 --> 00:26:10.237
Such trivial ones

00:26:10.808 --> 00:26:12.808
And extremely compressed

00:26:13.634 --> 00:26:16.221
Today people of our
country can make

00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:19.307
progress evenin
sahajayoga due to tendency

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.099
These people say, you are a saint.
Because you are so naive

00:26:23.124 --> 00:26:27.980
Such is their opinion. There will be.
You mean I have no disagreement.

00:26:29.043 --> 00:26:31.930
But Sahayogi is simply
naive and does not work.

00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:38.803
First, we need wisdom and
understanding that we have today

00:26:39.152 --> 00:26:40.663
Standing on the edge

00:26:45.044 --> 00:26:47.044
These petty ideas.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.303
If we want to get married,
we will do it in our

00:26:50.328 --> 00:26:53.239
we are sahajayogi By the way,
we are comfortable with sahajayogi

00:26:53.532 --> 00:26:55.688
Will work The word 'walk'
is too much for you.

00:26:55.974 --> 00:26:58.083
ok anything will work .
so which are you ?

00:26:58.108 --> 00:27:00.128
which king you are,says
everything will work out!

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.521
But the word 'walk'
should go smoothly.

00:27:05.505 --> 00:27:06.619
What is going on ?

00:27:08.864 --> 00:27:12.340
Instead of saying
'okay' or 'okay,'

00:27:13.134 --> 00:27:15.134
isn't this all shivaji maharaj ?

00:27:18.911 --> 00:27:20.982
Let us take a look at
these things and see

00:27:20.982 --> 00:27:23.753
That we have come to Sahajayoga

00:27:23.754 --> 00:27:25.855
It's not just for selfish reasons

00:27:26.514 --> 00:27:29.485
That is what we came
to find ourselves

00:27:29.782 --> 00:27:31.945
For what the mothers
have given to the mother

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.085
That we should open
our hands to others

00:27:36.609 --> 00:27:39.685
And we should see that
people should enjoy it

00:27:40.756 --> 00:27:42.243
They should be given love

00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:45.661
But people with
narrow-mindedness

00:27:45.962 --> 00:27:51.059
How to cure, then go into the pain
of fun in the room, Mataji Maja

00:27:51.302 --> 00:27:52.461
Pain in hand

00:27:53.016 --> 00:27:53.937
Will happen

00:27:55.286 --> 00:27:57.085
I got a job

00:27:57.195 --> 00:27:58.807
The hour went by

00:27:59.362 --> 00:28:00.548
Will happen

00:28:02.484 --> 00:28:05.838
Do you deserve to be under
the umbrella of your mother?

00:28:07.402 --> 00:28:08.237
Think about it

00:28:08.959 --> 00:28:10.959
Those fine ideas

00:28:11.411 --> 00:28:16.221
And apart from the contractions,
today I believe you are in the desert

00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:20.455
If you are wondering whether
fresh baked vegetables

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.919
have been cooked in the
house, then it will be hard

00:28:25.847 --> 00:28:27.847
That's your wackiness

00:28:28.965 --> 00:28:32.024
Increased views and hours
are mind-blowingly great

00:28:33.984 --> 00:28:36.538
You belong to this
religion of that religion

00:28:36.657 --> 00:28:38.308
We are not of any religion

00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:41.355
Religion is ours

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.147
We belong to no one's religion

00:28:49.433 --> 00:28:52.459
We are yogis what religion
do we mother to religion

00:28:52.515 --> 00:28:55.397
With a bit of it those
who are practicing this

00:28:55.738 --> 00:28:57.534
Let the days of
snake-eating come now

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.634
Diagnostics Let
Your Kids Have Fun

00:29:03.396 --> 00:29:05.396
Many styling your

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.093
Cut out the bad ideas.

00:29:11.394 --> 00:29:14.583
Unless you eliminate
those petty ideas

00:29:15.503 --> 00:29:16.458
by then

00:29:18.172 --> 00:29:22.718
If a kite is tie with
stone, it cannot fly

00:29:24.194 --> 00:29:25.327
Your flight

00:29:26.818 --> 00:29:27.613
Could not happen

00:29:29.009 --> 00:29:30.006
Just like our lives

00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:31.800
We are done

00:29:32.934 --> 00:29:33.899
In all

00:29:34.755 --> 00:29:36.084
In terms of content

00:29:36.973 --> 00:29:38.174
Sahajayoga  stands.

00:29:40.428 --> 00:29:42.060
And your All

00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:44.679
The kingdom of God is brought.

00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:47.742
But it should be
worth sitting there.

00:29:48.931 --> 00:29:50.653
Thoughts should be independent

00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:54.983
Thinking that I got into
this clan I thought something

00:29:55.165 --> 00:29:57.165
Maratha of 96 clan

00:29:57.355 --> 00:29:58.901
Or I become brahmin

00:30:00.814 --> 00:30:02.814
Content is all over us

00:30:04.934 --> 00:30:05.863
liar again.

00:30:06.092 --> 00:30:07.045
With credit

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.640
Ashamed of sahajayogi

00:30:12.584 --> 00:30:14.037
I am sahajayogi

00:30:14.473 --> 00:30:15.769
I'm free.

00:30:16.538 --> 00:30:19.764
I'm on the alert.
You told me something

00:30:20.386 --> 00:30:21.788
And I'm not gonna do it

00:30:22.542 --> 00:30:24.542
I stand at liberty

00:30:24.915 --> 00:30:26.915
I have autocorrect enabled

00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.821
You don't teach me anything

00:30:33.471 --> 00:30:35.630
Get away from all relations

00:30:36.558 --> 00:30:40.745
You will not be able to come up
like lotus until you swallow it all

00:30:41.324 --> 00:30:44.957
Until then your anything
No use and no fun

00:30:50.139 --> 00:30:52.139
Now, if we have a
campaign like this

00:30:55.647 --> 00:31:00.552
In Pune, Come at Savarkar Statue

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.724
so what you do there ?

00:31:06.842 --> 00:31:08.403
So there were
thousands of people

00:31:09.768 --> 00:31:11.113
Unpleasantness

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.648
If you want to teach

00:31:12.648 --> 00:31:14.898
Thousands of people will leave

00:31:15.107 --> 00:31:16.499
Run away

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:18.747
Because there is Unpleasantness

00:31:21.072 --> 00:31:23.072
But in the court of love

00:31:23.865 --> 00:31:25.865
Get rid of it all.

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:31.036
It is not ready.
All of this wears off in the dirt

00:31:35.487 --> 00:31:37.487
By breaking into this paradigm

00:31:39.051 --> 00:31:41.051
Stand in Sahajayoga

00:31:41.883 --> 00:31:43.395
It should not weak

00:31:44.633 --> 00:31:46.270
It should be strong

00:31:47.357 --> 00:31:48.352
This is new

00:31:48.852 --> 00:31:50.852
Such people should
be raised today

00:31:51.566 --> 00:31:55.533
thousands of mahatma gandhi
Thousands of lenin were raised

00:31:58.972 --> 00:32:01.657
thousands of like Abraham Lincoln
were raise like People should say

00:32:03.022 --> 00:32:04.606
But there is no difference

00:32:05.812 --> 00:32:08.482
That is what the nose,
the mouth and the feet are like

00:32:09.505 --> 00:32:11.505
Just look at how far the
soul has reached the light

00:32:14.227 --> 00:32:18.374
And we are saints,
we are saints.

00:32:19.405 --> 00:32:21.405
All this is a disorder

00:32:22.849 --> 00:32:24.849
It's a stigma for us

00:32:25.515 --> 00:32:30.669
We will break it down,religion and
all and forget about everything

00:32:31.946 --> 00:32:34.055
Unless you decide to

00:32:34.468 --> 00:32:36.468
You will not benefit at
all in the sahajayoga

00:32:37.062 --> 00:32:39.062
And for us too, it's Trouble

00:32:42.855 --> 00:32:44.289
Let's get bigger

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.360
The sea went anywhere

00:32:47.764 --> 00:32:49.119
That nobody is in the mind

00:32:49.563 --> 00:32:52.274
That is our sea of Alibaug

00:32:54.052 --> 00:32:55.650
or is a Mumbai sea

00:32:56.705 --> 00:32:58.311
The ocean is ocean

00:32:58.668 --> 00:33:00.267
Such a saint is a saint

00:33:01.504 --> 00:33:03.198
Which is a sign of saint and

00:33:03.832 --> 00:33:06.749
The main symptom of this
is that apprehension

00:33:07.203 --> 00:33:08.616
Artificial

00:33:09.648 --> 00:33:12.898
Beyond the artificial
small shrines

00:33:13.835 --> 00:33:15.035
Their vision is relaxed

00:33:15.685 --> 00:33:17.036
Very endearing

00:33:19.988 --> 00:33:24.916
At that time as a call for
cooperation, the whole world refuses

00:33:25.717 --> 00:33:27.379
The key is how we
become what you are

00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:31.426
We are gonna do
whatever you want

00:33:32.235 --> 00:33:34.727
We are this we are that

00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:37.136
Who are you lets see

00:33:38.318 --> 00:33:40.318
So what do we do

00:33:42.548 --> 00:33:45.230
Just get rid of this
illusion of stupidity

00:33:46.397 --> 00:33:48.397
You can remove
this with kundalini

00:33:48.849 --> 00:33:51.817
Today they are cheearing
me for Adi Shakti ,so do it

00:33:53.126 --> 00:33:55.647
What happen with it but
what is the benefit.

00:33:58.805 --> 00:34:00.152
If ours

00:34:00.731 --> 00:34:01.806
In cheers

00:34:02.876 --> 00:34:04.330
You forget all

00:34:05.028 --> 00:34:07.028
Are under our mother's feet

00:34:07.861 --> 00:34:10.030
And this universe is made by her

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:15.599
We are special sahajayogi
from that world

00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:17.838
If you think about it

00:34:19.012 --> 00:34:21.012
Then your own
perception will change

00:34:21.615 --> 00:34:22.796
And about self

00:34:23.279 --> 00:34:25.029
Whichever is wrong ideas

00:34:25.386 --> 00:34:26.745
they fix it

00:34:27.094 --> 00:34:28.301
Among themselves

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.724
love

00:34:31.176 --> 00:34:34.465
Not only that, but huge power

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.485
One is living among themselves

00:34:37.826 --> 00:34:38.567
Be aware of that

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.400
And we with a great power

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:43.040
Come together

00:34:43.405 --> 00:34:44.677
And with this power

00:34:45.121 --> 00:34:47.121
You will notice that
We are about to be saved

00:34:50.435 --> 00:34:53.690
Today some hindi language
known people who has come so

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:59.914
I always told to Marathi people
That you try to learn Hindi

00:34:59.914 --> 00:35:02.902
Because its your
national language but

00:35:02.902 --> 00:35:04.405
Will have to say to
Hindi people also

00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:07.412
Is it good to learn
a little Marathi

00:35:07.412 --> 00:35:13.160
Although I think that The Marathi
language is a bit too powerful

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.157
And its depth can not come in
any language okey leave Sanskrit

00:35:18.181 --> 00:35:21.662
After this any
Colloquial language has

00:35:21.662 --> 00:35:28.280
For Kundalini Marathi language
is very smooth and very

00:35:31.535 --> 00:35:32.872
In use

00:35:33.159 --> 00:35:36.475
However, the place of
Hindi language is very high

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.658
and ever Marathi people
should know Hindi language

00:35:39.658 --> 00:35:41.789
Similarly, you people also
have a Marathi Language

00:35:41.813 --> 00:35:43.661
learning should not be difficult

00:35:43.662 --> 00:35:47.658
What am I talking about today

00:35:47.658 --> 00:35:50.408
That of the big revolution
We stand on the post

00:35:50.408 --> 00:35:56.406
Right now in front of us
It is a big request that

00:35:57.099 --> 00:36:01.349
We are sahajayogi
Have earned yoga

00:36:01.662 --> 00:36:08.406
we are not like that Which
are full of dirty thoughts

00:36:08.406 --> 00:36:11.108
Who do not love each other

00:36:11.132 --> 00:36:15.356
and one Have violent
tendencies towards each other

00:36:15.408 --> 00:36:19.905
We are yogis We gonna
join all over the world

00:36:19.905 --> 00:36:24.160
We are especially representative

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.719
And we are saints and the
characteristics of saints

00:36:29.719 --> 00:36:32.972
Its in us Must seen

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:36.459
When it show everyone

00:36:36.459 --> 00:36:39.456
It will be understood that
Sahaja Yoga is a special thing

00:36:39.932 --> 00:36:42.408
Otherwise people will think
that your sahajayogi then what?

00:36:42.408 --> 00:36:45.163
Your habits are the same
Your ways are the same

00:36:45.163 --> 00:36:49.659
You fight likewise The
group bet is the same in you

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:52.161
All your values
Like that of others

00:36:52.161 --> 00:36:55.161
So what about Sahaja Yoga?

00:36:55.161 --> 00:36:59.660
In Sahaja Yoga we have
externally Received nothing

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:04.158
But the strong power
inside We live in

00:37:04.562 --> 00:37:10.059
And all our world
have this power today

00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:14.061
See that The power is
inhabited by all of us.

00:37:14.061 --> 00:37:20.556
It is roaming inside us Her
beautiful environment inside

00:37:20.556 --> 00:37:23.039
Made up and mutual
love and we know

00:37:23.386 --> 00:37:30.635
Not so much, every
moment, Power feeds us

00:37:30.635 --> 00:37:33.782
Binds us to each other

00:37:33.893 --> 00:37:38.028
This power is the formula of
the whole world that we got

00:37:38.028 --> 00:37:43.526
And when we found it We
do such useless things

00:37:43.526 --> 00:37:49.030
Of course Ready to destroy life

00:37:49.235 --> 00:37:54.734
We have to evaluate ourselves Will
have to know what is our value

00:37:54.734 --> 00:37:58.490
And what did we
understand our life

00:38:00.492 --> 00:38:02.239
I see that

00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:05.236
To quarrel is a human nature

00:38:05.236 --> 00:38:07.735
Whatever happens to
him They start fighting

00:38:07.735 --> 00:38:10.986
Like this with dog
cat I am not even seen

00:38:11.488 --> 00:38:13.987
If anything happens It
becomes a matter of quarrel

00:38:13.987 --> 00:38:19.238
Even if love is something
Sahaja Yoga is only for love

00:38:20.487 --> 00:38:24.327
Movement just love movement

00:38:24.351 --> 00:38:27.081
And you are sitting
in the same movement

00:38:27.489 --> 00:38:35.239
A very beautiful and very sweet
This is the environment I travel to

00:38:36.721 --> 00:38:41.467
But it can happen when
your subtlety Be so deep

00:38:41.842 --> 00:38:48.091
That we can see that we are
representative of divine

00:38:48.711 --> 00:38:52.708
Divine doing this job
from us What a great thing

00:38:52.837 --> 00:38:55.339
To achieve this unique thing

00:38:55.339 --> 00:39:01.337
You need to be aware of yourself
Be and be your own personality

00:39:01.337 --> 00:39:05.057
Give her such a
huge strain Tease

00:39:05.057 --> 00:39:09.086
Today is the first day
When everyone has come

00:39:09.086 --> 00:39:13.587
See how well everyone is sitting It is
a matter of great pride for a mother.

00:39:13.587 --> 00:39:16.587
That all my children here
are gathered from the world

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:24.836
But every time I want
that you become aware

00:39:24.836 --> 00:39:28.088
You have to know that Mother
is doing very big revolution

00:39:42.774 --> 00:39:44.330
You guys

00:39:45.409 --> 00:39:47.409
Watch you wake up

00:39:47.845 --> 00:39:49.845
That our mother

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.290
That is a very big achievement

00:39:51.964 --> 00:39:53.964
Which will wipe out all the universe

00:39:55.075 --> 00:39:57.607
This is a very big achievement

00:39:58.305 --> 00:40:00.305
Is doing and you

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:02.199
We are in limbo.

00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:09.036
May god bless you
