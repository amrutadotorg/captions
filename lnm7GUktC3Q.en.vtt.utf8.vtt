00:00:04.508 --> 00:00:12.231
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Ganesha
Puja.

00:00:21.884 --> 00:00:37.593
The first deity that was created by the Adi
Shakti was Shri Ganesh because it was necessary

00:00:37.593 --> 00:01:03.204
first to create the deity of principles - the
deity of principle in the sense that whatever

00:01:03.204 --> 00:01:19.844
is created, whatever is there as called "bhava,"
whatever has been so far created up to human

00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:21.174
level.

00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:40.125
Everything had to be through the implanted
mechanism of energy, otherwise nothing could

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:46.793
have been created.

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:57.534
If you go into the matter, say sulphur dioxide,
then sulphur and oxide - go on deep into it

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:07.334
till you reach the state when it is a molecule
- then you see these atoms of sulphur and

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:11.884
oxygen, they oscillate.

00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:18.284
They oscillate with a frequency.

00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:22.653
There are three types of frequencies they
use.

00:02:22.653 --> 00:02:34.124
Now imagine in the molecule, think of it,
in the molecule of a substance there is an

00:02:34.124 --> 00:02:39.114
energy which is acting.

00:02:39.114 --> 00:02:45.414
Now one may say that, "Why should be in matter
there is energy?"

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:58.234
One can ask a question: "Why there should
be energy in matter?"

00:02:58.234 --> 00:03:09.274
If there was no energy in the matter, how
can you have all chemical compounds?

00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:11.374
Who pushes them?

00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:16.164
Say, you have sodium chloride.

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:21.804
Sodium and chloride are attached to each other,
but if the chloride has to go to some other

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:28.534
atom, then who does that?

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:44.814
There has to be some energy which is absolutely
inbuilt into matter.

00:03:44.814 --> 00:03:59.334
Now, we may say that, "What about water?"

00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:02.174
You know water has energy.

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:04.054
That's how we have hydrostatics.

00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:20.924
Even coal, even stones, all of them have got
energy within themselves and it is all controlled

00:04:20.924 --> 00:04:23.874
by the principle of Shri Ganesha.

00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:35.314
So, though He's such a small, little, tiny,
little child, how great is His work and how

00:04:35.314 --> 00:04:37.004
much He has to work out.

00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:46.194
Now from matter, you move, say, to living
plants, then to animals, then to human beings

00:04:46.194 --> 00:04:48.024
and everywhere His energy works.

00:04:48.024 --> 00:04:58.454
At the level of matter, they might call it
electromagnetic, but potentially it is the

00:04:58.454 --> 00:05:04.474
energy of Shri Ganesh, which is electromagnetic
at that point.

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:09.574
Then it starts evolving, growing.

00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:27.834
That's how we have different stratas of energies
that we see in different growth of the evolution.

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:47.354
In the human being it exists, as you know,
as auspiciousness, as purity, mainly the innocence.

00:05:47.354 --> 00:05:56.994
So the power of innocence is such a guiding
factor.

00:05:56.994 --> 00:06:01.504
There's a difference between ignorance and
innocence.

00:06:01.504 --> 00:06:19.434
If you are innocent, then to you nothing is
important except for love.

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:30.054
For an innocent person who is not conditioned,
who is not egoistical, who is not so-called

00:06:30.054 --> 00:06:37.944
mature, it is the love that it understands.

00:06:37.944 --> 00:06:56.374
It doesn't care for any wealth, any power,
anything; but the love that it can feel, the

00:06:56.374 --> 00:07:02.004
pure love of a person.

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:15.024
Innocent person has no understanding of gaining
anything out of the love he receives or he

00:07:15.024 --> 00:07:19.824
gives, no sense at all.

00:07:19.824 --> 00:07:26.144
Innocence is the basis of all the dharmas.

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:39.804
If you have no innocence you cannot follow
dharma because if you are dharmic, it is maybe

00:07:39.804 --> 00:07:48.614
your mental attitude, maybe egoistical, maybe
because you are born in a religion, because

00:07:48.614 --> 00:07:51.044
somebody has told you about it.

00:07:51.044 --> 00:07:56.404
It's going to be very superficial.

00:07:56.404 --> 00:08:06.294
Unless and until it is embedded in the quality
of innocence, dharma has no meaning.

00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:10.104
In that state you are dharmic.

00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:19.744
You are beyond any thinking about it, of any
deductions about it, but you are dharmic.

00:08:19.744 --> 00:08:21.354
You cannot be adharmi.

00:08:21.354 --> 00:08:33.664
You cannot be - as if the manifestation of
innocence is morality.

00:08:33.664 --> 00:08:42.764
Once Shri Ganesha is awakened - I hope He
has been awakened in all of you - and if you

00:08:42.764 --> 00:08:55.254
respect Him, just respect Him, then automatically
you develop a sense of morality.

00:08:55.254 --> 00:08:57.724
I don't have to tell you.

00:08:57.724 --> 00:09:00.184
I don't have to explain to you.

00:09:00.184 --> 00:09:05.644
You just become moral.

00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:12.614
People who have seen you are quite amazed
and said that, "How is it that their eyes

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:19.414
are fixed, so innocent, without any lust and
greed?"

00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:31.474
Is the light of Shri Ganesha from the back
Agnya; front Agnya is Jesus Christ Who is

00:09:31.474 --> 00:09:39.644
the manifestation of Shri Ganesha.

00:09:39.644 --> 00:09:45.244
It is impossible for western mind to understand
that Jesus Christ was purity.

00:09:45.244 --> 00:09:53.054
They can't understand, and they have criticized
Him and said horrible things against.

00:09:53.054 --> 00:10:07.094
Somehow He's forgiving them, but one thing
about Shri Ganesh is that, that He worships

00:10:07.094 --> 00:10:09.424
His Mother.

00:10:09.424 --> 00:10:15.634
Motherhood is very important.

00:10:15.634 --> 00:10:30.574
Motherhood in the women, motherhood in the
father and also in the children has to be

00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:42.644
accepted as the mainstay of family life and
society.

00:10:42.644 --> 00:10:58.204
The ordinary life of a human being - very
simple, innocent, simple people - revolves

00:10:58.204 --> 00:11:02.154
around the mother.

00:11:02.154 --> 00:11:07.514
It revolves, but the mothers have to be mothers.

00:11:07.514 --> 00:11:24.004
As Shri Ganesha is so much surrendered to
His Mother and who is His Mother?

00:11:24.004 --> 00:11:25.794
Is Adi Shakti.

00:11:25.794 --> 00:11:34.074
He does not know anybody else, just knows
His Mother.

00:11:34.074 --> 00:11:45.514
This is extremely important in Sahaj Yoga.

00:11:45.514 --> 00:11:56.744
As we say, there is immoral human beings,
there are.

00:11:56.744 --> 00:12:13.384
They're doing immoral things because they're
committing sin against the Adi Shakti; committing

00:12:13.384 --> 00:12:20.024
sin against Ganesha.

00:12:20.024 --> 00:12:32.613
It may be forgiven, but committing sin against
the Adi Shakti, it encompasses a very big

00:12:32.613 --> 00:12:48.564
area where we start seeing how we are committing
the sin against the Adi Shakti which, ultimately,

00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:51.254
Shri Ganesha punishes - ultimately.

00:12:51.254 --> 00:13:04.854
Actually, the Adi Shakti doesn't punish anyone,
the deities only punish them.

00:13:04.854 --> 00:13:20.344
First and foremost thing that is to be understood,
that innocence should be respected, looked

00:13:20.344 --> 00:13:27.964
after, nourished and protected.

00:13:27.964 --> 00:13:33.983
That's why I'm very particular about the children.

00:13:33.983 --> 00:13:38.904
Children should not be exposed to the public.

00:13:38.904 --> 00:13:46.233
We should not try to make photographs out
of our children and expose them in the newspaper

00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:50.694
or give them for advertisement or anything
there.

00:13:50.694 --> 00:14:07.514
Is a very wrong idea to expose your children
to gain some money out of them in any way,

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:15.233
in the smallest way also, because we are selling
the innocence, the innocence which is invaluable,

00:14:15.233 --> 00:14:21.834
writ large on the children.

00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:28.363
Many children I know who have been advertised
and all that, specially in India, have died.

00:14:28.363 --> 00:14:39.054
Also we have to look after our children with
great care.

00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:43.764
But we go to two extremes, I have seen.

00:14:43.764 --> 00:14:45.914
Some people are only worried about their own
children.

00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:52.514
If anything happens to them, just get upset.

00:14:52.514 --> 00:14:56.904
That means you are respecting your child because
he's your child.

00:14:56.904 --> 00:15:03.284
But if you are respecting him because he carries
innocence with him, then you have to respect

00:15:03.284 --> 00:15:13.104
every child and understand every child - what
they talk, what they say, how they behave.

00:15:13.104 --> 00:15:16.304
Luckily, you all have got children now who
are born-realized.

00:15:16.304 --> 00:15:21.594
It's such a great thing, such a blessing.

00:15:21.594 --> 00:15:26.684
So on one side, we have to see how innocent
they are and how they talk.

00:15:26.684 --> 00:15:29.604
I'll give you an example.

00:15:29.604 --> 00:15:37.334
Bogdan - no, this Wolfgang was very serious
and his wife told Me that, "We were taking

00:15:37.334 --> 00:15:43.334
him to the hospital, so this doctor says,
'Why are you taking him to the hospital?

00:15:43.334 --> 00:15:45.954
There are no Sahaja Yogis there.

00:15:45.954 --> 00:15:49.854
How will they correct his chakras?'"

00:15:49.854 --> 00:15:52.413
Innocently said the correct thing and they
couldn't do.

00:15:52.413 --> 00:15:53.464
Doctors didn't do anything.

00:15:53.464 --> 00:15:56.714
I had to cure him.

00:15:56.714 --> 00:15:58.273
"Take him to Mother.

00:15:58.273 --> 00:16:01.283
Why are you taking him to the hospital?"

00:16:01.283 --> 00:16:08.934
They see the right point and say the right
thing because they're innocent and innocence

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:17.224
means they have pure attention - pure attention
for anything you need.

00:16:17.224 --> 00:16:26.784
Say, music, for art, for anything you have
to have pure attention and that comes through

00:16:26.784 --> 00:16:28.944
your innocence.

00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:35.724
Say a person who is an artist and who is very
money-oriented, say for example, a person

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:38.863
who is doing some paintings and all that.

00:16:38.863 --> 00:16:42.893
His art cannot become eternal art.

00:16:42.893 --> 00:16:43.893
Cannot.

00:16:43.893 --> 00:16:48.583
That's why we see in modern times whatever
art is created, it just comes and goes.

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:52.643
It has no eternal value.

00:16:52.643 --> 00:16:55.253
Same with the modern music that they're having.

00:16:55.253 --> 00:16:56.784
The same thing is happening.

00:16:56.784 --> 00:17:05.664
It comes and goes and no one knows where it
has disappeared.

00:17:05.664 --> 00:17:18.195
Behind it is money orientation, and that money
orientation results into a kind of a creation

00:17:18.195 --> 00:17:24.434
which is not perfect.

00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:33.434
All creations which were dedicated to God
in the olden times are being today very much

00:17:33.434 --> 00:17:36.184
respected and people pay a lot of money for
that.

00:17:36.184 --> 00:17:42.623
Maybe, at that time, the artists must have
suffered; but they understood, innocent artists

00:17:42.623 --> 00:17:53.944
understood, very much that if we have to express,
we must truthfully do it, not to please, not

00:17:53.944 --> 00:17:59.314
to please the people, not to please anyone,
but to please God.

00:17:59.314 --> 00:18:06.323
As you know that Michelangelo had a big fight
with this pope here because he couldn't tolerate

00:18:06.323 --> 00:18:09.524
nonsense that was coming from the pope.

00:18:09.524 --> 00:18:14.734
All the artists always have been fighting
- real artists.

00:18:14.734 --> 00:18:19.994
So this innocence also gives you a power of
self-understanding.

00:18:19.994 --> 00:18:25.864
You know where you stand.

00:18:25.864 --> 00:18:35.623
A person who is innocent knows very well that
he is standing on the pedestal of virtues.

00:18:35.623 --> 00:18:43.133
He should not give in to all kinds of nonsensical
things which are very popular, may be fashionable,

00:18:43.133 --> 00:18:44.133
may be accepted.

00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:48.503
For what?

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:52.983
For what are we going to sacrifice our innocence?

00:18:52.983 --> 00:18:57.444
What is our gain?

00:18:57.444 --> 00:19:03.444
May be some people are too brilliant and they
may try to show off with their brilliance

00:19:03.444 --> 00:19:10.133
for a short time, but they don't remain in
the eternal history.

00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:19.863
They go as egoistical people or as very dishonest
people.

00:19:19.863 --> 00:19:23.253
Nobody respects them.

00:19:23.253 --> 00:19:34.993
So there is a big attack on the innocence
of people.

00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:37.473
Big attack.

00:19:37.473 --> 00:19:38.944
First it comes from children.

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:45.233
As you see, this nonsense that is going on
which we hear about - I mean, I can't even

00:19:45.233 --> 00:19:48.064
understand why they do it.

00:19:48.064 --> 00:19:55.084
They do it on children, these funny attacks
of abuses.

00:19:55.084 --> 00:20:01.794
It's just because they want to kill the innocence.

00:20:01.794 --> 00:20:08.184
Perhaps those who do it have no innocence
in them, and they don't want the children

00:20:08.184 --> 00:20:11.304
to have any innocence left in them.

00:20:11.304 --> 00:20:15.473
Otherwise, in India is something we can't
understand.

00:20:15.473 --> 00:20:22.223
Really, we can't understand; but it is becoming
much more prevalent, much more fashionable

00:20:22.223 --> 00:20:34.304
now because there is definitely an attack
on innocence, not only on children, but even

00:20:34.304 --> 00:20:37.863
on people who are innocent.

00:20:37.863 --> 00:20:49.353
Because those who have deliberations in criminality,
in all kinds of sinful act will never, never

00:20:49.353 --> 00:20:51.493
try to protect innocence.

00:20:51.493 --> 00:20:56.924
Never, because juxtaposition is there.

00:20:56.924 --> 00:21:01.263
They are doing something which they think
is the best.

00:21:01.263 --> 00:21:05.693
I don't know if they think that way, but I
don't know what justifies their behavior like

00:21:05.693 --> 00:21:12.564
this is to attack the innocence of children.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:18.204
In so many ways, you'll find this innocence
is being attacked.

00:21:18.204 --> 00:21:25.954
If your children are doing well, if they are
studying well, somebody might try to catch

00:21:25.954 --> 00:21:28.674
hold of them.

00:21:28.674 --> 00:21:39.223
If some person they find is an innocent person,
they will try to put him into trouble.

00:21:39.223 --> 00:21:47.253
The innocence is sort of - is, itself, is
such a power that it challenges the hatred,

00:21:47.253 --> 00:21:53.343
the abusive nature of people.

00:21:53.343 --> 00:22:05.794
First of all, we should see that how our conditioning
takes over our innocence.

00:22:05.794 --> 00:22:07.304
It makes you extremely ritualistic.

00:22:07.304 --> 00:22:14.973
Even in Sahaja Yoga, I've seen, I've heard
also, that people are extremely, extremely

00:22:14.973 --> 00:22:31.304
ritualistic.

00:22:31.304 --> 00:22:38.434
Now the ritualism is like this: that you have
to say something three times, you say it three

00:22:38.434 --> 00:22:42.694
times, seven times like tied up people.

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:53.194
I've seen some Sahaja Yogis like that; and
some Sahaj Yogis, I think they must be bhootish,

00:22:53.194 --> 00:22:55.034
get frightened with Me.

00:22:55.034 --> 00:22:56.833
What is there to be frightened of Me?

00:22:56.833 --> 00:23:01.934
Because they're bhootish, they are getting
frightened.

00:23:01.934 --> 00:23:05.003
Otherwise, why should you?

00:23:05.003 --> 00:23:13.743
I love you all and you won't find more, a
greater, mild Guru than Myself.

00:23:13.743 --> 00:23:19.613
I don't think so, but they're afraid.

00:23:19.613 --> 00:23:21.973
Even if you look at them, they'll not smile.

00:23:21.973 --> 00:23:23.123
They'll be afraid.

00:23:23.123 --> 00:23:24.393
What wrong have you done?

00:23:24.393 --> 00:23:27.383
You have become Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:27.383 --> 00:23:31.143
They're so ritualistic in everything.

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:39.243
So one should understand a difference between
a protocol and ritualism.

00:23:39.243 --> 00:23:42.774
An innocent child knows the protocol.

00:23:42.774 --> 00:23:51.503
I remember there was a child who came to see
Me in Austria and I said, "Let's go upstairs."

00:23:51.503 --> 00:23:56.863
So it was a small, little staircase of wood.

00:23:56.863 --> 00:23:57.883
He said, "What?

00:23:57.883 --> 00:24:02.213
Is She going to go up without a red carpet?"

00:24:02.213 --> 00:24:07.184
This came into his head, you see.

00:24:07.184 --> 00:24:14.404
So for children, you see, innocent children,
the worship, everything is not ritualistic.

00:24:14.404 --> 00:24:15.483
It is heartfelt.

00:24:15.483 --> 00:24:28.363
You feel it from the heart: how to do the
worship, how to show your love.

00:24:28.363 --> 00:24:42.223
Is very sweet way an innocent person does
it; while a person who is very ritualistic,

00:24:42.223 --> 00:24:48.083
he may even beat another person because, "Why
did you do this?

00:24:48.083 --> 00:24:50.284
You should not have put camphor in it?

00:24:50.284 --> 00:24:52.003
Why did you put the camphor so?

00:24:52.003 --> 00:24:54.003
It's very wrong."

00:24:54.003 --> 00:24:56.013
There's nothing wrong.

00:24:56.013 --> 00:25:06.444
If you do it with your heart, with your open
heart, innocently, anything is all right.

00:25:06.444 --> 00:25:14.363
It is the open heart which is necessary, not
the closed heart - "Why did you do it?

00:25:14.363 --> 00:25:16.973
Why didn't you do it?

00:25:16.973 --> 00:25:18.434
Where did you sit?

00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:19.434
What happened?"

00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:20.434
Nothing.

00:25:20.434 --> 00:25:26.914
Now you are in the Kingdom of God and here
there are no such rules and regulations that

00:25:26.914 --> 00:25:30.174
you should be ritualistic.

00:25:30.174 --> 00:25:34.503
But everything has a double, has a double
style.

00:25:34.503 --> 00:25:40.373
Now I say you need not be ritualistic.

00:25:40.373 --> 00:25:41.654
Once I went into an ashram.

00:25:41.654 --> 00:25:44.934
I found everything was just like a pigsty.

00:25:44.934 --> 00:25:47.584
I said, "What's this?

00:25:47.584 --> 00:25:50.743
Is this an ashram or what is it?"

00:25:50.743 --> 00:25:59.044
So they said, "Mother, You told us that, "You
have to be innocent and you don't have to

00:25:59.044 --> 00:26:01.693
be ritualistic."

00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:05.154
So we thought, "Throw all the things wherever
you feel like.

00:26:05.154 --> 00:26:08.454
What is there to be ritualistic?"

00:26:08.454 --> 00:26:14.733
Is a very common thing with all the ashram
people, leaders tell Me that Sahaja Yogis

00:26:14.733 --> 00:26:20.363
have no sense at all of looking after the
cleanliness of the ashram.

00:26:20.363 --> 00:26:22.094
They're least bothered.

00:26:22.094 --> 00:26:28.284
If it is their house, they look after; but
if it is an ashram they do not.

00:26:28.284 --> 00:26:35.584
It's very surprising and I have seen, or I
have heard, that ashrams all of bhootish and

00:26:35.584 --> 00:26:41.184
false gurus are absolutely spick and span.

00:26:41.184 --> 00:26:43.994
Really.

00:26:43.994 --> 00:26:52.983
Is very surprising and, even here in Cabella,
people were telling Me that they're living

00:26:52.983 --> 00:26:54.953
like animals.

00:26:54.953 --> 00:27:01.853
I said, "Animals are innocent, you know."

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:07.323
You go into a jungle, now - I don't know,
we are going to take you this time into a

00:27:07.323 --> 00:27:13.804
jungle - you'll have no smell, no horrid things
to see, nothing.

00:27:13.804 --> 00:27:17.794
It's very clean, spick and span, all the time.

00:27:17.794 --> 00:27:24.253
But you put one human being, you will immediately
know that there has been a human being.

00:27:24.253 --> 00:27:27.893
They have their own systems of keeping things
clean.

00:27:27.893 --> 00:27:35.343
Even the tiger, who is an innocent thing - up
to animal stage you are innocent - he has

00:27:35.343 --> 00:27:38.853
his own styles.

00:27:38.853 --> 00:27:44.003
I don't know if you know about a tiger or
not, but a tiger will kill an animal because

00:27:44.003 --> 00:27:46.353
he has to eat, after all.

00:27:46.353 --> 00:27:47.513
He suppose to only eat animals.

00:27:47.513 --> 00:27:48.513
He doesn't eat grass.

00:27:48.513 --> 00:27:49.513
What to do?

00:27:49.513 --> 00:27:51.414
He's not a vegetarian.

00:27:51.414 --> 00:27:53.924
God has made him like that.

00:27:53.924 --> 00:27:56.654
So he accepts.

00:27:56.654 --> 00:28:01.093
Now he goes and kills the cow or anything.

00:28:01.093 --> 00:28:06.823
Then he leaves his kill there for the blood
to ooze out.

00:28:06.823 --> 00:28:16.093
Nobody will touch that, nobody, because he's
really the king, not out of fear, but of protocol.

00:28:16.093 --> 00:28:17.774
Then next day he goes.

00:28:17.774 --> 00:28:20.824
He eats, then his family eats and all that.

00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:23.083
Then finished for the whole month.

00:28:23.083 --> 00:28:25.313
They come out.

00:28:25.313 --> 00:28:30.313
Then the lower animals start going there.

00:28:30.313 --> 00:28:41.453
Like you have - don't know what you call them
... I miss in English.

00:28:41.453 --> 00:28:44.614
I don't know if they have - leopards, leopards.

00:28:44.614 --> 00:28:50.723
Leopards and all these animals come out and
they start eating.

00:28:50.723 --> 00:28:52.774
And then even lower and lower till the birds.

00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:56.943
Still the crow, they stay back.

00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:59.823
Last are crows.

00:28:59.823 --> 00:29:02.693
Can you imagine?

00:29:02.693 --> 00:29:07.493
Such a system, they have.

00:29:07.493 --> 00:29:17.613
They go all the way from Siberia to Australia.

00:29:17.613 --> 00:29:18.953
How do they manage?

00:29:18.953 --> 00:29:20.753
Think of it.

00:29:20.753 --> 00:29:24.654
What gives them direction is innocence.

00:29:24.654 --> 00:29:30.243
And the innocence is magnet.

00:29:30.243 --> 00:29:31.243
It's a magnet.

00:29:31.243 --> 00:29:33.193
It's actually, it's a magnet.

00:29:33.193 --> 00:29:38.774
In a human being you do not find a magnet
because it has now evolved so much, but it

00:29:38.774 --> 00:29:42.524
starts just like a magnet.

00:29:42.524 --> 00:29:46.344
So they know which is north, which is south,
east and west.

00:29:46.344 --> 00:29:51.503
Even a little bee, you find and put a mark
on it.

00:29:51.503 --> 00:29:57.534
It goes to the place from where it has come.

00:29:57.534 --> 00:30:02.554
How does it find its own way?

00:30:02.554 --> 00:30:09.564
Is the innocence, is like a magnet, acts like
a magnet.

00:30:09.564 --> 00:30:11.703
Even in the fishes.

00:30:11.703 --> 00:30:14.234
Just imagine how fishes have direction.

00:30:14.234 --> 00:30:19.873
We don't have - I mean, human beings can be
lost, I mean many a times I am lost with so

00:30:19.873 --> 00:30:27.083
many drivers I've had.

00:30:27.083 --> 00:30:39.243
So many times I've been lost, but animals
never.

00:30:39.243 --> 00:30:48.603
You know, if you take a dog and you don't
want the dog, you leave him about, say, fifty

00:30:48.603 --> 00:30:52.453
miles away, he'll come back.

00:30:52.453 --> 00:30:56.893
How does he find the way?

00:30:56.893 --> 00:31:07.563
So their qualities which are built-in within
them, through their innocence, are actually

00:31:07.563 --> 00:31:16.483
the qualities of electromagnetic force and
also pranava; that is when electromagnetic

00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:25.563
force is charged with Ganesha's Principle.

00:31:25.563 --> 00:31:27.444
That's why they're so systematic.

00:31:27.444 --> 00:31:29.203
They are so clean.

00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:38.544
They are so sensible, but they're not ritualistic.

00:31:38.544 --> 00:31:42.943
They're not ritualistic.

00:31:42.943 --> 00:31:46.914
Whatever God has given them, they have accepted.

00:31:46.914 --> 00:31:49.393
They're bound by that.

00:31:49.393 --> 00:31:55.084
They're bound and they live with that boundary.

00:31:55.084 --> 00:32:02.133
Even if you go up to the stage of animals
which live with human beings, they, too, are

00:32:02.133 --> 00:32:03.954
very affectionate.

00:32:03.954 --> 00:32:06.303
They just want love.

00:32:06.303 --> 00:32:07.544
Nothing else.

00:32:07.544 --> 00:32:14.513
See, one day if you do not care for your dog,
he'll just not eat his food, not eat his food.

00:32:14.513 --> 00:32:18.324
He wouldn't care for the food.

00:32:18.324 --> 00:32:28.113
It is so remarkable, even I have seen among
children how they just want love.

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:32.914
They don't accept anything else but love;
but as soon as they start growing up, you

00:32:32.914 --> 00:32:40.304
see, specially in a materialistic world, then
the whole materialism comes in.

00:32:40.304 --> 00:32:49.693
So the second way we kill our children's innocence
is putting materialistic ideas into their

00:32:49.693 --> 00:32:50.693
heads.

00:32:50.693 --> 00:32:57.074
Of course, the media is there which is selling
now-a-days a teddy bear which has a birthday.

00:32:57.074 --> 00:32:59.614
Teddy bear has a birthday.

00:32:59.614 --> 00:33:01.763
Can you imagine?

00:33:01.763 --> 00:33:05.294
So everybody's buying teddy bear with a birthday.

00:33:05.294 --> 00:33:11.354
Because the parents don't want to be in the
company of children, so they get some sort

00:33:11.354 --> 00:33:16.204
of a toys - this, that, one or two is all
right - and put them with the toys, with the

00:33:16.204 --> 00:33:17.204
television on.

00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:21.284
"Now, sit down."

00:33:21.284 --> 00:33:25.274
Children start becoming naturally materialistic.

00:33:25.274 --> 00:33:39.264
They start asking for things, and for
demands of such kind that sometimes one is

00:33:39.264 --> 00:33:40.913
surprised.

00:33:40.913 --> 00:33:47.173
You take a western child to the market and
you've had it.

00:33:47.173 --> 00:33:51.193
But you take Indian children, they'll never
take anything.

00:33:51.193 --> 00:33:53.173
Really, it's so difficult to make them.

00:33:53.173 --> 00:33:56.314
At least, I have seen My own grandchildren
and other.

00:33:56.314 --> 00:34:00.623
You take them, it's a headache to buy even
another pair of shoes for them.

00:34:00.623 --> 00:34:01.913
"No, but we have one.

00:34:01.913 --> 00:34:04.383
Why do you want to buy another?"

00:34:04.383 --> 00:34:05.953
"...That will give way."

00:34:05.953 --> 00:34:07.373
"No, we can come here."

00:34:07.373 --> 00:34:08.373
"How."

00:34:08.373 --> 00:34:10.614
"We can come in the car or else we can walk."

00:34:10.614 --> 00:34:12.234
"But you'll have no shoes.

00:34:12.234 --> 00:34:13.234
Nothing."

00:34:13.234 --> 00:34:14.234
"One is all right.

00:34:14.234 --> 00:34:15.644
Why to have two?"

00:34:15.644 --> 00:34:22.504
You give them money, they'll buy one small
little thing and come.

00:34:22.504 --> 00:34:33.933
You see, it is the whole tradition of materialism
which has brought this innocence to a stop.

00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:38.504
Then a child starts growing in the same materialistic
way.

00:34:38.504 --> 00:34:46.173
He starts judging people like, "How many cars
you have?"

00:34:46.173 --> 00:34:53.465
You see, they're so stupidly materialistic
that I went to Boston and the television people

00:34:53.465 --> 00:34:55.964
asked Me, "How many Rolls Royces You have?"

00:34:55.964 --> 00:34:57.933
I said, "I don't have any."

00:34:57.933 --> 00:34:59.334
They said, "We are not interested.

00:34:59.334 --> 00:35:03.254
You are not in the business."

00:35:03.254 --> 00:35:11.124
This is what is now the mind of people in
the West who have grown up.

00:35:11.124 --> 00:35:15.633
But even the children, today they want this,
tomorrow they want that.

00:35:15.633 --> 00:35:27.434
All the time there's a competition for materialistic
things, asking for this, asking for that.

00:35:27.434 --> 00:35:37.693
Just imagine what a race will be there after
some years when there'll be just people who'll

00:35:37.693 --> 00:35:41.244
be only worried about collecting things and
buying things.

00:35:41.244 --> 00:35:46.544
I mean, buyers and sellers, nothing else.

00:35:46.544 --> 00:35:56.264
So you have to be very careful with your children
that you do not pamper them, do not get too

00:35:56.264 --> 00:36:01.264
much worried about them, do not keep them
on materialistic level.

00:36:01.264 --> 00:36:02.264
Find out.

00:36:02.264 --> 00:36:06.433
If they are going on a materialistic level,
bring them down.

00:36:06.433 --> 00:36:15.123
It's very simple to do that and one has to
work it out because we have to save our children

00:36:15.123 --> 00:36:16.594
and their innocence.

00:36:16.594 --> 00:36:27.764
Now for the other Sahaja Yogis who are grown
up and who are very mature, they are very

00:36:27.764 --> 00:36:29.044
innocent, I must say.

00:36:29.044 --> 00:36:30.133
I must admit that.

00:36:30.133 --> 00:36:34.164
They're very innocent compared to the society
that is around.

00:36:34.164 --> 00:36:35.404
No doubt.

00:36:35.404 --> 00:36:43.044
One has to really admire the way they have
become so innocent, the way they're understanding

00:36:43.044 --> 00:36:46.404
this divine music and all.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:49.764
That's really creditable.

00:36:49.764 --> 00:36:59.393
But still, this innocence, if it is not spread,
if this innocence doesn't work out, then it

00:36:59.393 --> 00:37:03.153
will rust, will not grow.

00:37:03.153 --> 00:37:07.034
Your I.Q. will be less than the others, I
can tell you this much.

00:37:07.034 --> 00:37:11.134
They are growing in materialism all right.

00:37:11.134 --> 00:37:18.643
Their I.Q. is growing in materialisms, but
your I.Q. will not grow unless and until you

00:37:18.643 --> 00:37:22.034
spread this innocence around.

00:37:22.034 --> 00:37:26.603
Now you know how to do it.

00:37:26.603 --> 00:37:31.633
It is the power of Kundalini with the help
of Shri Ganesh.

00:37:31.633 --> 00:37:33.274
He helps you at every chakra.

00:37:33.274 --> 00:37:39.814
I have written that He's the Vice Chancellor
of every university, where He has to stamp.

00:37:39.814 --> 00:37:48.693
He's at every point, but you have to understand
that this has to spread.

00:37:48.693 --> 00:37:50.104
It has to become collective.

00:37:50.104 --> 00:37:55.244
It has to flow.

00:37:55.244 --> 00:38:03.693
So to become that, what should we do ourselves?

00:38:03.693 --> 00:38:11.204
That we should try to organize programs.

00:38:11.204 --> 00:38:16.944
While people will be enamored by your innocence,
no doubt.

00:38:16.944 --> 00:38:20.374
They'll be surprised how are you so innocent.

00:38:20.374 --> 00:38:24.314
How can you be so nice in these modern times?

00:38:24.314 --> 00:38:26.614
No doubt about it.

00:38:26.614 --> 00:38:33.384
But, in that doing, that so, try to be innocent
yourself.

00:38:33.384 --> 00:38:34.384
Should not be cunning.

00:38:34.384 --> 00:38:36.014
You should not be smart.

00:38:36.014 --> 00:38:42.673
You should not try to show that you are very
brilliant or anything; because the ego might,

00:38:42.673 --> 00:38:47.504
in between, come and try to put ideas into
your head.

00:38:47.504 --> 00:38:54.683
It's better to show that you're innocent and
to be innocent inside.

00:38:54.683 --> 00:39:04.574
The whole inner being can be really charged
with the energy of Shri Ganesh, no doubt,

00:39:04.574 --> 00:39:07.784
and the outer life becomes innocent.

00:39:07.784 --> 00:39:10.203
Becomes innocent.

00:39:10.203 --> 00:39:14.064
I mean, I don't know banking.

00:39:14.064 --> 00:39:15.064
I don't know money.

00:39:15.064 --> 00:39:22.933
I am quite bad at everything - all right,
at worldly things, but I'm not cunning.

00:39:22.933 --> 00:39:32.784
I'm not, sort of, smart, as you can see; but
still things are working out because of the

00:39:32.784 --> 00:39:36.524
inner power that one has.

00:39:36.524 --> 00:39:42.384
So depend on your inner power and manifest
it outside.

00:39:42.384 --> 00:39:49.844
Inner being, which is Ganesha, is the same
in all of us.

00:39:49.844 --> 00:39:53.433
The whole system is the same in all of us.

00:39:53.433 --> 00:39:55.914
Chakras are the same in all of us.

00:39:55.914 --> 00:40:08.114
Only thing, we have to keep our innocence
absolutely free of all this worldly nonsense

00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:11.953
like a fashion, this, that.

00:40:11.953 --> 00:40:18.554
Immediately, you'll find that your being will
manifest.

00:40:18.554 --> 00:40:20.874
Being will manifest.

00:40:20.874 --> 00:40:24.054
Now just think of simple thing like that.

00:40:24.054 --> 00:40:33.103
I am an Indian, I mean, and nobody knows Me;
but whenever I have My lecture, I have at

00:40:33.103 --> 00:40:34.923
least five to six thousand people.

00:40:34.923 --> 00:40:35.923
How?

00:40:35.923 --> 00:40:40.064
How do they come to My lecture like that?

00:40:40.064 --> 00:40:42.284
Anywhere in the whole world.

00:40:42.284 --> 00:40:43.284
Minimum.

00:40:43.284 --> 00:40:45.853
Sometimes you're much more.

00:40:45.853 --> 00:40:50.974
What's so special?

00:40:50.974 --> 00:40:58.363
So when handling the people, we are Sahaja
Yogis, we are saints, we have to talk to them

00:40:58.363 --> 00:40:59.853
like saints.

00:40:59.853 --> 00:41:11.514
We have to behave like saints, and they should
in no way feel that we are cunning or we are

00:41:11.514 --> 00:41:15.163
interested in something else.

00:41:15.163 --> 00:41:24.673
So, once you start doing that, flowing your
innocence, you know, all the Gods and Goddesses

00:41:24.673 --> 00:41:26.074
will help.

00:41:26.074 --> 00:41:37.133
Your creativity will be thousand times more
than normal.

00:41:37.133 --> 00:41:39.724
Everybody has to think how we are going to
spread it.

00:41:39.724 --> 00:41:44.214
Like I was happy to know that in America,
of all the places, they have got hold of these

00:41:44.214 --> 00:41:47.703
senators - very good idea.

00:41:47.703 --> 00:41:51.994
Let us see if it works out.

00:41:51.994 --> 00:42:03.044
So we have to find out all the ways and methods
and all the styles which will behoove a saint,

00:42:03.044 --> 00:42:09.464
not a politician or - these days, of course,
all the sports people are heroes.

00:42:09.464 --> 00:42:14.813
I mean, if you want to become a hero, you
become a sportsman.

00:42:14.813 --> 00:42:22.873
Not like that, but like a saint; and saintliness
is respected, whatever may be the situation,

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:28.874
whatever may be the situation, whosoever may
be facing you.

00:42:28.874 --> 00:42:35.544
Recently when I was in Kiev, the leaders wife
told Me that, "Mother, we had that old car

00:42:35.544 --> 00:42:40.913
of Yours, which we sold and we got so much
money that we could buy a new car.

00:42:40.913 --> 00:42:45.824
Then we went to the factory to buy the new
car."

00:42:45.824 --> 00:42:47.824
And they bought it.

00:42:47.824 --> 00:42:50.294
So outside the factory there's a mafia.

00:42:50.294 --> 00:42:55.913
Nowadays I think the Sicilians have reached
there.

00:42:55.913 --> 00:43:03.144
So the mafia was standing outside and they
said, "You have to pay so much money to us."

00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:04.304
In thousands.

00:43:04.304 --> 00:43:06.434
So they said, "We have no money."

00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:07.564
"Why?

00:43:07.564 --> 00:43:09.424
What do you do?"

00:43:09.424 --> 00:43:10.494
This was his wife.

00:43:10.494 --> 00:43:13.224
She said, "We meditate."

00:43:13.224 --> 00:43:14.224
"Really.

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:15.224
So you have no money."

00:43:15.224 --> 00:43:16.224
"No."

00:43:16.224 --> 00:43:17.224
"What about those children?"

00:43:17.224 --> 00:43:18.224
"They also meditate."

00:43:18.224 --> 00:43:20.393
She's so innocently she was talking to them.

00:43:20.393 --> 00:43:24.074
They said that, "We saw their faces melting
down."

00:43:24.074 --> 00:43:27.284
They said, "All right.

00:43:27.284 --> 00:43:28.284
Go."

00:43:28.284 --> 00:43:33.074
They forgot that they were suppose to get
money out of them.

00:43:33.074 --> 00:43:37.614
Or they take the car, they confiscate the
car or take the money.

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:38.814
They said, "All right.

00:43:38.814 --> 00:43:39.814
Go."

00:43:39.814 --> 00:43:40.814
They told Me this story.

00:43:40.814 --> 00:43:43.853
So your simplicity always helps.

00:43:43.853 --> 00:43:51.373
Your innocence always helps you, and it has
such an impact, such an impact.

00:43:51.373 --> 00:44:01.324
I tell you that a personality, what we call
in Sanskrit is a "vigraha."

00:44:01.324 --> 00:44:06.234
Vigraha means a personality which has a coefficience.

00:44:06.234 --> 00:44:18.143
The person who is innocent has such a great
coefficience that he can charm anybody.

00:44:18.143 --> 00:44:26.594
But, first and foremost thing that we have
to be innocent, not to so much worry about

00:44:26.594 --> 00:44:40.834
money, not to count everything, not to worry
about food; but this is not to be done with

00:44:40.834 --> 00:44:42.344
deliberations, but innocence.

00:44:42.344 --> 00:44:47.154
Where you sleep, what you do is not important
to a saint.

00:44:47.154 --> 00:44:58.134
It lives the way one has to live because his
nourishing point is innocence, and he doesn't

00:44:58.134 --> 00:44:59.494
get angry.

00:44:59.494 --> 00:45:01.764
He doesn't shout at people.

00:45:01.764 --> 00:45:02.764
Nothing.

00:45:02.764 --> 00:45:07.386
Of course, at bhoots it may be that he has
to shout like Christ did; 

00:45:07.586 --> 00:45:15.171
but otherwise, he is very peaceful, joyous, happy, humorous person.

00:45:15.371 --> 00:45:18.199
so today, at this puja, 

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:26.114
I would bless you with all the qualities of Shri Ganesha, except forHis anger. 

00:45:26.157 --> 00:45:28.271
May God bless you
