03:13.160 --> 03:17.021
This is the first time we are having a puja in Brisbane,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
and I'm happy so many have come here

03:21.080 --> 03:23.320
from various places.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.920
You know that by puja you,

03:29.040 --> 03:32.920
you excite the Chakras within Me

03:34.200 --> 03:38.080
and you get lots of vibrations,

03:40.080 --> 03:42.160
and you achieve,

03:42.480 --> 03:45.800
suddenly, a height in your awareness.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.960
You do achieve that, but

03:52.320 --> 03:54.840
after some time they say that:

03:54.960 --> 03:57.400
Mother, again we come down.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.480
Also, they were saying that:

04:00.800 --> 04:03.680
"When we go to India we are all right,

04:03.760 --> 04:06.760
and when we come back, again we come down."

04:09.160 --> 04:11.000
Luckily, now we have an Ashram,

04:11.080 --> 04:12.680
which is a very good thing.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.880
To have an ashram itself is a, I must say,

04:15.960 --> 04:17.600
is a very, very

04:19.480 --> 04:21.000
positive thing because

04:21.080 --> 04:23.800
that is how Ganesha is established here.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.920
So Ashram is here for a collective living,

04:35.760 --> 04:39.800
but collective living of spirituality.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.640
It's not just living here, but it is of spirituality.

04:45.800 --> 04:50.640
And we have to know certain things about

04:51.120 --> 04:53.080
the discipline that we have to keep,

04:53.160 --> 04:55.600
is very important.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.920
It's not just a house where are... some people

04:58.080 --> 05:00.440
have gathered together to live together,

05:00.520 --> 05:04.480
but it has to have a discipline.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.080
Then only you'll be helped

05:10.160 --> 05:12.600
because if you do not come

05:12.680 --> 05:15.080
to the Ashram with this idea

05:15.160 --> 05:18.240
that you are going there to ascend yourself,

05:20.240 --> 05:21.880
it will make no difference

05:21.960 --> 05:23.000
whether you stay in the house

05:23.080 --> 05:25.080
or you go in the Ashram.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.960
So there are two types of meditation,

05:35.160 --> 05:36.680
two types,

05:37.240 --> 05:40.680
where one is the meditation where -

05:41.640 --> 05:43.880
we can call it the antarmana -

05:43.960 --> 05:46.480
that we meditate inside ourselves,

05:47.960 --> 05:51.240
to see for ourselves what's wrong with us,

05:52.080 --> 05:53.880
and how we have to correct,

05:53.960 --> 05:55.560
what we have to do about it.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.120
And another is bahirmana,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.560
is outside,

06:01.880 --> 06:04.880
how we have to live outside.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.240
You have to have a discipline,

06:07.320 --> 06:09.960
which is not imposed on you

06:10.280 --> 06:12.560
but, very happily,

06:12.720 --> 06:14.520
which you have

06:17.080 --> 06:18.840
accepted

06:19.480 --> 06:21.520
and have imbibed.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.720
For any art, say in India, I don't know here, but

06:28.960 --> 06:34.840
you have to put yourself into a rigorous training

06:34.920 --> 06:37.920
to achieve any height.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.360
You cannot haphazardly move about it.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.880
You cannot take just easily everything.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.920
In Sahaja Yoga there is no tapascharya,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.560
there is no penance for you.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.360
It's all blessings.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.040
But one should not get lost with those blessings,

06:58.360 --> 07:01.440
if you have to really get into yourself

07:01.720 --> 07:04.040
in its full depth.

07:06.600 --> 07:12.000
So, for the antarmana it is important

07:12.080 --> 07:14.960
that you all should meditate,

07:15.040 --> 07:18.520
morning and evening, every day.

07:18.759 --> 07:22.679
Is all right even if you do not brush your teeth,

07:24.160 --> 07:27.920
but you must meditate is an important thing.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.880
That is the reason I find that in the West

07:32.000 --> 07:33.880
people go on catching,

07:33.960 --> 07:35.920
again cleaning, again catching.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.600
Every time I come... find somebody is suffering

07:39.680 --> 07:42.080
from either... for some sort of a conditioning,

07:42.160 --> 07:44.520
or say, some sort of a baddha,

07:44.600 --> 07:48.040
or sometimes it's ego or something.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.000
It comes and goes.

07:50.080 --> 07:56.440
It is not something that is detached permanently.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.160
As we have to take our bath every day,

08:01.240 --> 08:04.200
we have to wash ourselves every day,

08:04.280 --> 08:07.920
in the same way we have to wash ourselves within.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.960
So meditation is the antarmana

08:13.400 --> 08:15.440
tapaha, as you can call it.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.680
But it's not such a Tapaha even.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.880
You don't have to go to Himalayas and sit there.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.520
You have to just do this meditation

08:26.120 --> 08:28.200
early in the morning.

08:28.600 --> 08:32.200
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

08:33.160 --> 08:36.680
I would say the best that is working out

08:36.760 --> 08:39.960
is in Germany and in Austria, these two;

08:41.480 --> 08:43.760
and also England, but not to that extent.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.200
I would say these two are working out the best;

08:47.280 --> 08:50.760
and thirdly, in Rome.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.920
They too have ashrams of the same kind,

08:56.440 --> 09:01.000
but for them it is very important to achieve

09:01.320 --> 09:03.400
the heights of Sahaja Yoga.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.720
Absolutely. Nothing is more important.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.920
Invariably, in all these ashrams

09:09.000 --> 09:10.760
I've seen people get up at four o'clock.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.160
I also get up every day at four.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.000
Then I may sleep later on,

09:15.080 --> 09:17.320
but at four o'clock I am up.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.440
They take their baths,

09:19.600 --> 09:22.160
get ready for the pujas,

09:23.160 --> 09:25.080
and then sit down and do about

09:25.240 --> 09:28.800
five, ten minutes puja of the photograph,

09:29.720 --> 09:31.640
and then meditate.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.280
Then they go and have some breakfast or something.

09:39.200 --> 09:44.720
Then when they come home from work,

09:46.240 --> 09:50.280
also they sit down together to meditate,

09:50.360 --> 09:52.760
that's the collective part of it,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
or discuss whatever is to be done, what,

09:55.080 --> 09:57.760
how are we to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.560
They just talk about Sahaja Yoga,

10:01.080 --> 10:03.120
or they decide what should be done,

10:03.200 --> 10:04.960
what is the best way

10:05.040 --> 10:07.960
to solve the problems of Sahaja Yoga.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.080
And then in the night, before sleeping,

10:13.160 --> 10:16.080
invariably all of them,  all of them,

10:16.160 --> 10:18.760
one and all, even children before sleeping,

10:19.440 --> 10:22.320
soak their feet in the water,

10:22.400 --> 10:24.960
sit for meditation, and sleep.

10:25.880 --> 10:30.280
That's why I find Austria has come up so well,

10:31.160 --> 10:33.720
and Germans.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.960
You know, Germans are like that.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.680
If something gets into their heads,

10:38.960 --> 10:41.880
for them that's the most important thing;

10:41.960 --> 10:43.920
then they do not sort of fickle out.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
There's no...

10:45.080 --> 10:47.960
they don't have any compromises on those points.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.680
And they make their body work hard.

10:50.840 --> 10:53.680
Now, what is the Tapa in this thing here

10:54.160 --> 10:55.520
- the penance?

10:55.600 --> 10:59.960
That our body is used to some sort of a life.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.000
India also, we are all like that in India

11:02.080 --> 11:04.240
- everybody will get up in the morning,

11:04.320 --> 11:06.200
and they will sit for puja,

11:06.280 --> 11:07.880
or they will sit for meditation.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.160
I mean, that goes without saying,

11:09.240 --> 11:11.320
you don't have to tell them.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.840
Because that's the traditional thing to do in India:

11:14.920 --> 11:17.240
always when they get up, have their bath,

11:17.320 --> 11:19.680
they always do some puja,

11:20.400 --> 11:21.800
all of them.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.880
If they're Christians, also, they'll sit down and pray.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.360
Muslims, they'll do namaaz.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.080
That's a kind of a practice,

11:32.320 --> 11:35.640
and the breeding of the family.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.400
Here I find that the parents

11:38.480 --> 11:40.080
do not take the responsibility

11:40.160 --> 11:43.480
to pass on any information to children

11:43.560 --> 11:45.560
about disciplining themselves,

11:45.640 --> 11:48.200
because children are also extremely aggressive.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.160
They don't want to know about it.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.880
So the parents also dare not tell them

11:56.960 --> 11:59.120
that: "It is good for you, please do it this way;

11:59.200 --> 12:01.760
it is better that you meditate."

12:04.440 --> 12:06.720
They're afraid that they may lose their children

12:06.800 --> 12:08.280
if they tell them like this.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.000
Or, "You pray", or "You get up at this time".

12:11.080 --> 12:14.000
You dare not tell them that you get up at this time.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.720
This is the greatest crime in the West,

12:16.800 --> 12:17.880
if you tell them that:

12:17.960 --> 12:20.640
"You have to get up at four o'clock" - abbah.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.560
It's like the worst punishment.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.480
But once you start getting up in the morning,

12:29.560 --> 12:32.920
you'll get the habit, and then you'll sleep early.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.880
Then you can sleep early.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.880
Getting up in the morning, really,

12:41.960 --> 12:44.200
will help you for the whole day.

12:44.280 --> 12:47.760
So start this kind of a practice.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.760
You must meditate every day,

12:50.840 --> 12:53.760
and this is the reason why I find people,

12:54.240 --> 12:56.360
whenever I come, they're again caught up,

12:56.440 --> 12:57.440
something gone wrong.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.040
This is wrong, that is wrong;

12:59.120 --> 13:02.480
they're caught up here and there. Why should you?

13:02.840 --> 13:05.560
Day by day, you must rise.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.480
Day by day, you should be at a much higher state,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.920
and this new breeding has to come within us,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.080
that we are Sahaja Yogis.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.400
And we are not here only,

13:19.480 --> 13:25.760
just to have good food and to have a nice time

13:25.880 --> 13:29.680
or nice meetings, but we are here

13:29.800 --> 13:35.840
to become those unique personalities,

13:35.920 --> 13:39.760
which are required to raise the humanity

13:39.840 --> 13:41.960
to a higher state.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.920
So you have to be, now, responsible for yourself.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.360
You have to look after yourself

13:50.480 --> 13:52.400
and you have to tell yourself:

13:52.560 --> 13:54.720
"Mr. So-and-so, Mrs. So-and-so,

13:54.800 --> 13:56.800
please now behave yourself."

13:58.160 --> 14:00.840
Otherwise, Sahaja Yoga is lost to you.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.560
It's not going to help you much.

14:05.080 --> 14:10.000
We might increase in quantity,

14:10.080 --> 14:12.800
but quality-wise we'll be missing;

14:13.320 --> 14:17.000
and one attack of negativity can finish

14:17.080 --> 14:20.160
such a quantity that we think is too much

14:20.240 --> 14:22.520
- it has happened once.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.800
So now, all of you must develop

14:28.400 --> 14:33.240
that dedication to yourself,

14:35.320 --> 14:39.000
to find out what's your problem,

14:39.880 --> 14:42.720
and how you have to correct it.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.880
If it is done every day, I can assure you,

14:47.960 --> 14:51.080
you will have no problem of any kind.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.160
Your thoughts will stop,

14:55.640 --> 14:58.360
your problems will be solved,

15:00.480 --> 15:03.000
and you'll have no catches at all,

15:03.080 --> 15:04.920
because you have washed them off.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.240
But if you leave them on your being,

15:07.320 --> 15:10.920
then they grow, and they become big.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.960
So there should be no lethargy,

15:15.040 --> 15:17.720
as far as meditation is concerned,

15:17.800 --> 15:21.600
but joyfully you'll start doing, after some time.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.800
You won't be happy if you have not done it.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.360
But in the beginning you'll have to goad yourself,

15:27.440 --> 15:29.200
and tell yourself

15:29.280 --> 15:34.680
that this body has to be cleaned;

15:34.760 --> 15:37.320
but more than that body,

15:37.520 --> 15:40.600
this mind and intellect, both of them,

15:40.720 --> 15:43.200
are to be corrected.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.760
To be an instrument of God,

15:46.840 --> 15:48.880
you have to be perfect,

15:49.160 --> 15:51.160
perfect personality,

15:51.240 --> 15:53.920
otherwise we may not be able to communicate

15:54.000 --> 15:57.720
the message of Sahaja Yoga in the proper way.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.880
Many people say that:

16:00.960 --> 16:03.680
"We are surrendered to Mother,

16:03.960 --> 16:05.920
and we are surrendered to Her,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.080
and as surrendering we'll get everything."

16:10.400 --> 16:12.840
But what are you surrendering?

16:12.920 --> 16:15.280
Is that a clean heart,

16:15.360 --> 16:19.920
or a heart full of all kinds of wrong things?

16:24.160 --> 16:26.320
Or is that the intelligence,

16:26.400 --> 16:30.120
which is a very superior type of clean intelligence?

16:30.200 --> 16:33.960
Or else, are you coming out

16:34.040 --> 16:36.840
with all your arrogance?

16:40.440 --> 16:44.920
So though there is the Ganges of Sahaja Yoga flowing,

16:46.320 --> 16:51.080
still you have to have the depth of a pitcher.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.960
A stone cannot fetch any water.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.160
Same with children.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
Of course, as they'll be going to India,

17:01.400 --> 17:04.040
I am sure they'll form proper routines,

17:04.200 --> 17:08.920
and they'll form proper meditation methods.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.640
It is obvious that we have never had

17:15.720 --> 17:19.680
the sense of Divinity in the West.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.320
Whatever we had, whatever we got

17:22.400 --> 17:25.000
from the church or from any

17:25.600 --> 17:28.120
synagogue or something like that,

17:28.400 --> 17:30.960
which was only Sunday to Sunday, Sunday to Sunday;

17:31.160 --> 17:34.200
for a Muslim it is Friday to Friday, Friday to Friday,

17:35.240 --> 17:37.000
finished.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.920
But that has led them nowhere.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.160
So we have to do something about it.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.280
Problems will be solved in no time.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.200
You don't have to sit down and contemplate

17:51.280 --> 17:53.240
and worry: how will you solve your problem?

17:53.320 --> 17:55.240
It will be solved.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.080
But what cannot be solved

17:57.160 --> 18:00.240
is the habits you have developed,

18:00.320 --> 18:03.560
habits of lethargy.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.840
I can understand in London

18:06.960 --> 18:09.600
if the people are lethargic, but they are not.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.000
They have become extremely,

18:12.080 --> 18:15.960
extremely hardworking,

18:16.600 --> 18:18.280
active,

18:18.360 --> 18:20.640
and also dedicated.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.440
How they have achieved it?

18:25.000 --> 18:29.720
Only by knowing that this dedication brings forth

18:30.400 --> 18:33.080
all the cleansing, and all the powers.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.280
Now, supposing this instrument is not clean.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.400
You won't be able to even hear Me,

18:39.480 --> 18:41.280
it is useless.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.840
So our instrument has to be perfect

18:47.960 --> 18:51.880
to manifest Sahaja Yoga.

18:51.960 --> 18:56.400
If it is not, all the defects can have double effects;

18:56.480 --> 19:00.080
like, first it will affect you,

19:00.680 --> 19:06.200
you can never feel the full advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

19:06.320 --> 19:09.600
and secondly it will affect the people who will meet you,

19:09.680 --> 19:11.360
and gradually they'll find out

19:11.440 --> 19:14.160
there's something wrong with you.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.920
"Some sort of a subdued madness",

19:18.000 --> 19:20.360
they'll say, "this Sahaja Yoga is,

19:20.440 --> 19:23.880
because I don't find anything great about this man.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.120
He's halfway here and halfway there."

19:30.560 --> 19:34.720
Once you start getting deeper into your being,

19:34.800 --> 19:38.320
you'll be amazed that you can develop

19:38.400 --> 19:40.760
such capacities

19:42.000 --> 19:46.880
that you will be amazed at yourself.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.240
Of course there are blessings, there are miracles,

19:52.320 --> 19:55.560
but think of your own capacities.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.280
What are your capacities?

20:04.400 --> 20:08.160
How far are you able to do

20:08.320 --> 20:12.200
something about curing people?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.720
We have few people in Bombay,

20:16.800 --> 20:19.400
and very few people in Pune also.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.880
But they are available for curing.

20:23.240 --> 20:27.800
Some of them are going to villages.

20:27.960 --> 20:32.360
Now they have asked Me to give them a jeep,

20:32.640 --> 20:36.080
so they could take a music party to the villages

20:36.240 --> 20:38.720
and sing there,

20:40.880 --> 20:43.200
and achieve

20:44.360 --> 20:47.440
a greater number of Sahaja Yogis.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.640
But when they come back, immediately,

20:50.720 --> 20:53.520
whether they come in the daytime or in the night,

20:53.600 --> 20:56.000
immediately they wash their feet

20:56.080 --> 20:58.080
before the photograph.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.160
Also to protect yourself,

21:02.240 --> 21:04.880
you have to give yourself a bandhan,

21:04.960 --> 21:05.880
all the time.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.000
It is not you should say: "Now, I'm all right."

21:08.080 --> 21:10.080
You should not say that: "I am perfect."

21:10.160 --> 21:12.080
You should not say: "Now I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

21:12.160 --> 21:13.880
Never, never think like that.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.080
The moment you start thinking you are perfect,

21:16.160 --> 21:18.080
you are finished.

21:20.560 --> 21:24.360
So before going out, you must give a proper bandhan.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.760
Also before sleeping you must give a proper bandhan.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.960
Put your attention to your Sahasrara and then sleep.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.920
It's very amazing how things work out.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.080
Immediately you will know a person

21:41.160 --> 21:44.880
is meditating or not, immediately.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.120
It's like he is a person who

21:48.280 --> 21:51.280
has given a bath to the child.

21:54.320 --> 21:57.000
Though he has given a bath to the child,

21:57.080 --> 21:58.440
still he has not taken a bath.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.160
You can make it out, the difference between the two.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.000
In the same way, those who have been meditating

22:06.080 --> 22:08.320
every day, morning and evening,

22:08.400 --> 22:09.920
not much time needed.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.480
You see, we waste all our time

22:11.560 --> 22:13.240
in something nonsensical.

22:16.560 --> 22:22.560
When there is complete understanding of yourself,

22:22.760 --> 22:26.640
and complete understanding of these vibrations,

22:28.160 --> 22:33.840
then only you can handle them properly.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.720
All this knowledge is for you.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.880
Is absolutely free as you know,

22:39.960 --> 22:43.160
and all this mastery can be yours.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.000
So do not just get satisfied:

22:45.080 --> 22:48.560
"All right, today's Sunday, we'll go to the church,

22:50.240 --> 22:53.880
take the hymn book, let us sing this hymn number

22:53.960 --> 22:56.960
such-and-such, again sit down, get up, sit down."

22:58.800 --> 23:01.760
Come back home just the same.

23:03.520 --> 23:09.240
So today I have really thought of telling all of you

23:09.320 --> 23:13.640
that you have to develop the depth within yourself.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.440
And if you cannot develop that depth,

23:20.520 --> 23:23.920
then you are still a mediocre.

23:25.800 --> 23:31.360
Actually all these great secrets about the Goddess

23:31.440 --> 23:35.640
or Her powers, were not told to anyone like that.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.240
Never.

23:38.320 --> 23:44.240
Only when they had completed their oneness

23:45.600 --> 23:50.520
- I would say the full idea, full understanding

23:50.960 --> 23:53.880
between the oneness of God

23:53.960 --> 23:57.000
and your relationship with that,

23:57.960 --> 24:00.320
absolutely –

24:01.440 --> 24:05.560
nobody would do anything before that.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.520
Now the days are, of Sahaja Yoga, are so simple

24:11.680 --> 24:14.000
that as soon as you get Realization,

24:14.080 --> 24:16.960
you can start giving Realization to others.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.120
Immediately.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.080
Just under your hand you will see

24:21.160 --> 24:22.720
the Kundalini will move.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.280
You put your hand on somebody's head,

24:24.360 --> 24:27.240
and you'll find that person gets realization.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.280
It's a fact.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.680
It just works that way.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.720
But that means, for many:

24:36.800 --> 24:38.680
"Oh, there's nothing to be done.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.120
After all, is all done by Mother,

24:40.200 --> 24:42.520
we have just achieved something."

24:44.960 --> 24:48.160
You can always understand that

24:48.240 --> 24:51.880
Mother can only work out a very good instrument,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.480
and not a weak instrument.

24:55.760 --> 25:02.720
So now, we have some very great Sahaja Yogis

25:03.000 --> 25:05.840
who have gone very deep into it.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.840
Invariably, whenever I asked,

25:08.920 --> 25:11.000
they say: "Mother, every day we worship.

25:11.080 --> 25:14.640
We worship morning and evening, every way, day.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.000
We either wash our feet

25:17.080 --> 25:18.880
and sit down before Your photograph

25:18.960 --> 25:20.800
and worship Your photograph,

25:20.880 --> 25:23.400
or else in the morning time also

25:23.480 --> 25:26.080
we do something like that."

25:26.160 --> 25:30.440
And amazingly, you can make them out immediately.

25:32.200 --> 25:36.160
There may be six hundred people at the airport,

25:38.680 --> 25:40.600
but immediately I know

25:40.680 --> 25:44.040
who has been meditating every day.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.320
Now, it is for us.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.400
We have been doing Sahaja Yoga for the last,

25:55.480 --> 25:57.920
now, more than twenty years,

25:58.400 --> 26:00.920
and now we are entering into twenty-first year,

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
we can say; but I'm ready, you see, it is like that,

26:04.080 --> 26:08.960
because now it was 1970, and now it is 1990,

26:09.480 --> 26:13.520
so it is all this thing, plus ninety-one.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.880
So much time we have had.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.120
Of course, I would say,

26:20.200 --> 26:23.040
you didn't get your Realization at that time;

26:23.120 --> 26:27.240
but whatever time you got the Realization,

26:28.760 --> 26:32.080
I did not judge how far you were in it.

26:32.160 --> 26:35.000
I said: "First let them have their Realization."

26:35.080 --> 26:37.640
They got their Realization.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.720
So once they got their Realization, you see,

26:41.160 --> 26:44.640
people who have really

26:47.240 --> 26:50.080
felt the responsibility,

26:50.160 --> 26:52.320
from the very first day they got to it,

26:52.400 --> 26:53.640
from the very first day.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.160
I didn't have to tell them.

26:56.240 --> 27:00.418
I'm not talking about Indians, I'm talking about others.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.600
And they have done, they have shown

27:04.680 --> 27:07.720
tremendous improvement, tremendous.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.080
We have been sending you Indian boys from there,

27:12.160 --> 27:13.880
Indian girls from there,

27:13.960 --> 27:16.600
just for you to know that

27:16.680 --> 27:20.840
they can also help you in Sahaja Yoga.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.640
Definitely can help you.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.520
You have to have a proper type of a person,

27:26.800 --> 27:30.640
and you'll be amazed at the way they are,

27:30.720 --> 27:33.840
that they can impart everything,

27:34.160 --> 27:38.760
and they are least bothered about their ego.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.720
There's no ego at all.

27:44.520 --> 27:48.880
So you are not achieving all this for your ego.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.760
You are achieving it because

27:53.480 --> 27:55.840
you are a seeker,

27:55.920 --> 27:58.560
and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.360
So it is to be understood that it's not

28:01.440 --> 28:04.800
something like a advantage in money wise,

28:04.880 --> 28:06.880
or something that I have to have a power,

28:06.960 --> 28:08.000
this, that;

28:08.080 --> 28:10.080
because if you do not meditate,

28:10.160 --> 28:12.920
your attention will go to such things.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.360
Immediately you'll start thinking:

28:15.440 --> 28:17.760
Can I become the leader?

28:17.840 --> 28:22.000
All right, if not: "Should I debase the leader?

28:22.080 --> 28:24.000
How can I insult him?

28:24.080 --> 28:27.360
How can I fight for that? How can I do that?

28:27.440 --> 28:29.480
How can I work it out this way?"

28:29.560 --> 28:31.480
You try to insult also.

28:31.560 --> 28:35.360
If not possible, you might use violence sometimes,

28:35.440 --> 28:37.280
anger,

28:38.960 --> 28:41.720
because you are not yet, I should say,

28:41.800 --> 28:43.800
that much evolve, evolved,

28:43.880 --> 28:46.880
so much mature, so much wiser.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.160
So now, what you have to do

28:49.240 --> 28:52.160
is to... at the very

28:52.240 --> 28:54.880
first shot when you get up in the morning,

28:54.960 --> 28:57.000
you first say that: "Let me see,

28:57.080 --> 29:00.040
what is my responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi?"

29:02.960 --> 29:06.080
After some time you will start enjoying it,

29:06.160 --> 29:10.320
because it will give you such tremendous powers,

29:10.400 --> 29:13.636
such tremendous experience.

29:15.480 --> 29:20.680
Now then, you just sit down with very humble mind,

29:20.760 --> 29:24.000
and first of all say: "Mother, if I have any ego, please take away.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.880
Mother, if I have any conditioning,

29:25.960 --> 29:27.080
please take away; because

29:27.160 --> 29:28.640
I'm a seeker out and out,

29:28.720 --> 29:30.000
I don't want all these things."

29:30.080 --> 29:31.920
But if you do not meditate,

29:32.000 --> 29:35.920
then this Mr. Ego will secretly crawl upon you,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.080
and you may try to become the leader,

29:38.160 --> 29:40.713
or some sort of an assertion you'll do,

29:40.793 --> 29:46.360
some sort of a stupid ego actions,

29:46.440 --> 29:48.720
which we have many in Sahaja Yoga.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.320
If you write them down,

29:50.400 --> 29:54.116
you will not know how to stop laughing.

29:56.581 --> 30:01.040
So to warn yourself, I would say that

30:01.120 --> 30:05.144
the only way to protect yourself is to do

30:05.224 --> 30:07.640
the meditation in the morning and evening,

30:07.720 --> 30:12.120
and also to keep yourself in complete bandhan.

30:17.720 --> 30:21.840
Yours is a very important role

30:21.920 --> 30:25.440
and a very important time,

30:25.520 --> 30:28.784
extremely important.

30:28.864 --> 30:31.120
You have no idea,

30:31.200 --> 30:35.120
that in the history of spirituality

30:35.200 --> 30:39.990
no one could do so much as you can do.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.640
So, if you really

30:47.560 --> 30:50.800
do the Antarmana,

30:50.880 --> 30:54.520
if you really see inside yourself,

30:54.600 --> 30:58.689
while meditating you see yourself, your chakras and all that,

30:58.769 --> 31:01.721
and then you find out this introspection:

31:01.801 --> 31:03.697
Why am I like this?

31:03.777 --> 31:06.057
Just separate from yourself, see for yourself:

31:06.160 --> 31:09.817
"Why am I like this? Why I did like this?

31:09.897 --> 31:13.986
Why do I think like this? Who am I?"

31:16.167 --> 31:18.920
These questions when answered,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.914
you will know all your worth, your value.

31:28.570 --> 31:32.236
I do not know how much I should stress,

31:32.316 --> 31:35.006
how much more is needed to stress

31:35.086 --> 31:39.206
the importance of meditation, every day.

31:40.539 --> 31:41.913
Like these advertisements you see,

31:41.993 --> 31:45.006
every day they just go on bombarding

31:45.086 --> 31:47.070
on your head, and:

31:47.150 --> 31:51.757
Buy this, buy that, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.812
It acts.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.880
In the same way, you have to every day

31:57.960 --> 32:00.160
bombard yourself: "Now, meditation.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.880
Get to meditation. Get to meditation."

32:02.960 --> 32:05.843
Then you'll be surprised

32:05.962 --> 32:09.213
that when you'll go out, you'll see something beautiful;

32:09.293 --> 32:11.857
immediately you'll get into thoughtless awareness.

32:11.937 --> 32:14.083
Don't have to do.

32:14.650 --> 32:17.951
As soon as you'll meet a Sahaja Yogi, immediately into thoughtless;

32:18.031 --> 32:21.281
the other person, you both will go.

32:22.166 --> 32:26.148
Everything you start enjoying in a very different manner.

32:26.327 --> 32:29.080
And such beautiful feelings come in,

32:29.160 --> 32:33.469
such beautiful security is built up

32:35.835 --> 32:38.570
that you are surprised:

32:38.650 --> 32:40.911
"How I could be like that?

32:40.991 --> 32:45.356
How I could feel these securities just expressing

32:45.436 --> 32:48.998
themselves in such a beautiful manner?"

32:49.475 --> 32:55.324
Because if you are, say, washed and clean

32:55.404 --> 32:57.629
- simple thing, everyday life –

32:59.006 --> 33:01.920
then before touching any, everything you are careful

33:02.000 --> 33:04.800
that you don't again spoil them.

33:05.938 --> 33:10.475
If there's a sari, which is dirty, absolutely dirty,

33:10.555 --> 33:13.920
then if there are two spots or hundred spots,

33:14.000 --> 33:15.733
makes no difference.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.160
But when it is absolutely clean, then

33:18.240 --> 33:21.340
even the slightest spot you can get worried,

33:21.420 --> 33:23.761
because everybody will see that.

33:26.198 --> 33:27.975
In the same way,

33:28.055 --> 33:30.602
unless and until you cleanse yourself every day,

33:30.682 --> 33:33.649
you will not know what's wrong with you.

33:38.080 --> 33:42.840
I hope you'll pay full attention to what I've said here today,

33:42.920 --> 33:46.019
with full attention

33:47.509 --> 33:51.441
on your inner being

33:52.102 --> 33:54.562
projecting out,

33:56.278 --> 33:59.002
like a witness to yourself.

34:00.215 --> 34:03.007
Just see how you talk to others:

34:03.318 --> 34:05.418
"Why should I talk like that?

34:05.498 --> 34:08.012
What is the need to talk?"

34:08.500 --> 34:10.753
And then you'll start understanding

34:10.833 --> 34:12.697
that behind all this

34:12.777 --> 34:16.998
is some sort of a funny thing going on in my brain,

34:21.422 --> 34:24.532
and this brain has to be corrected

34:24.612 --> 34:26.388
- Very important.

34:26.627 --> 34:33.096
Now, at the end of the day we should find out:

34:33.176 --> 34:37.251
What good things I have done for Sahaja Yoga?

34:40.176 --> 34:45.025
Also, we can find out, "How I have been

34:45.126 --> 34:49.202
not up to the point in Sahaja Yoga?"

34:52.873 --> 34:55.576
If it could be done,

34:57.960 --> 35:01.739
you find out: "How far I have gone

35:03.159 --> 35:07.866
with these powers to spread Sahaja Yoga?

35:08.406 --> 35:11.459
How far I can go?"

35:11.579 --> 35:14.252
It's really remarkable because,

35:14.332 --> 35:19.544
as I told you, in Austria we have some boys

35:19.896 --> 35:23.878
who are all the time researching about Sahaja Yoga.

35:25.071 --> 35:27.880
They have read the book of Adi Shankaracharya,

35:27.960 --> 35:30.767
which I have not yet read.

35:31.762 --> 35:33.682
They have read all kinds of things,

35:33.801 --> 35:36.755
just to find out how far they are,

35:36.849 --> 35:38.370
and as a result

35:38.450 --> 35:42.516
they themselves went on developing

35:42.652 --> 35:46.450
very, very deep into their beings;

35:46.586 --> 35:49.554
but the way, you see,

35:49.634 --> 35:54.140
you go on developing deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,

35:54.240 --> 35:57.810
and you'll be amazed the deeper you go,

35:57.890 --> 36:01.627
you won't show off, you won't show off.

36:01.707 --> 36:03.866
You'll just emit.

36:03.960 --> 36:07.847
Like, one gentleman once came to My house

36:09.714 --> 36:14.071
and they said, "Mother, some cooler has come inside.

36:14.246 --> 36:17.840
It looks some cooler has come inside. Ya, ya, there's a cooler coming."

36:17.920 --> 36:21.573
He didn't say anything, didn't do anything.

36:22.240 --> 36:23.920
Just walking inside the house:

36:24.000 --> 36:26.923
Some cooler has come.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.000
You just felt, you know;

36:30.080 --> 36:32.721
like in the forest if you go,

36:32.801 --> 36:37.458
and you find complete silence, even the birds are not twittering,

36:37.538 --> 36:40.141
then know there's a tiger sitting there.

36:40.221 --> 36:44.698
Tiger doesn't do anything; it's just sleeping maybe, poor thing.

36:44.778 --> 36:48.406
But the whole place is awed by his presence, you see.

36:48.539 --> 36:52.316
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi, anywhere, will stand out.

36:52.396 --> 36:54.080
Look at these saints, they didn't know

36:54.160 --> 36:56.080
how to raise even the Kundalini,

36:56.175 --> 36:59.026
but they were very pure people.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.920
They never raised anybody's Kundalini.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.880
They never gave Realization to anyone.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.880
They were extremely pure people.

37:05.960 --> 37:09.380
There was no impurity left in them.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.745
And so, how much they could produce:

37:12.825 --> 37:15.745
what poetry, what work,

37:15.825 --> 37:21.008
what spiritual, spiritual ideas,

37:21.088 --> 37:24.691
what sayings; I mean, tremendous –

37:24.771 --> 37:28.511
such depth in whatever they did,

37:28.793 --> 37:31.115
such effectiveness.

37:31.286 --> 37:34.062
Now, we are here to gain our spirituality,

37:34.142 --> 37:35.904
not to gain money,

37:35.984 --> 37:40.429
not to gain positions,

37:40.509 --> 37:44.602
powers - nothing. We are here to gain our spirituality,

37:44.682 --> 37:48.710
and in that spirituality, it's all there.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.731
All the satisfaction,

37:55.320 --> 37:56.960
everything is there.

37:57.079 --> 38:00.506
It will have an effect on the children.

38:02.904 --> 38:06.904
It will have an effect on the surroundings,

38:07.000 --> 38:11.240
in every way, and the personality.

38:14.176 --> 38:17.509
So it's not a question also individuals doing that,

38:17.596 --> 38:21.081
but collectively doing it.

38:23.110 --> 38:26.541
The collective should look a beautiful thing.

38:26.621 --> 38:30.541
So you should have, I would say, in an ashram,

38:30.666 --> 38:33.656
a collective meditation.

38:35.484 --> 38:38.080
In Austria they do it early in the morning,

38:38.160 --> 38:41.279
four o'clock, collectively.

38:41.642 --> 38:43.080
So they know how many are there,

38:43.160 --> 38:45.786
and how many are missing, this, that.

38:45.866 --> 38:48.889
But I said: "Don't point out. Let's see."

38:48.969 --> 38:51.356
When those who have been doing meditation like that

38:51.436 --> 38:54.894
rise so high, others start following them.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.410
So don't think about others: what time he got up.

38:59.490 --> 39:01.737
It's I; I have to look after myself.

39:01.817 --> 39:06.126
It's very selfish: Swarth.

39:06.206 --> 39:08.569
You have to know the meaning of Swa

39:08.649 --> 39:10.277
- that is selfishness –

39:10.357 --> 39:13.880
and when you know that meaning, then you are not bothered

39:13.960 --> 39:17.880
whatsoever anybody might say, whatsoever anyone may try to do.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.920
Supposing your husband is funny:

39:20.000 --> 39:22.515
Oh, doesn't matter. He'll come round.

39:22.595 --> 39:26.070
Supposing your wife is funny: Doesn't matter, she'll come round.

39:26.150 --> 39:30.000
Is nothing important. To you, this is the most important thing to do,

39:30.080 --> 39:32.080
and all those who have thought like this

39:32.160 --> 39:34.134
and have acted like this,

39:34.214 --> 39:37.040
were above everything.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.251
Nothing can put them down.

39:40.382 --> 39:43.420
So, today is the first day of Brisbane.

39:43.500 --> 39:47.142
I bless you all, that you should have

39:47.222 --> 39:50.477
this full idea about yourself,

39:50.587 --> 39:52.612
why you are on this earth,

39:52.692 --> 39:56.149
and what great work you are supposed to do.

39:56.229 --> 39:58.380
Each one of you is capable.

39:58.460 --> 40:00.380
Each one of you can do it,

40:00.460 --> 40:02.664
but you... I would request you

40:02.744 --> 40:06.791
that you imbibe these qualities within you,

40:06.871 --> 40:08.380
which are already there.

40:08.460 --> 40:11.401
I mean, I wouldn't say "imbibe", but you manifest them,

40:11.481 --> 40:13.545
and once you start manifesting,

40:13.625 --> 40:16.621
see your temperament how it is.

40:16.743 --> 40:19.575
We'll look after your children; don't worry.

40:19.632 --> 40:21.627
May God bless you.
