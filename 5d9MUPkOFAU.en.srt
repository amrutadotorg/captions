1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,380
You have to know that you all have been seekers before

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,980
this is not the first time you have been seeking.

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,620
So already you have reached a certain state

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,740
where you feel and you are aware that something more

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,860
has to happen to you, you are already ready for that,

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,100
some of you have really taken birth in this time just for this.

7
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,300
So, because I’m not going to talk of your past,

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,260
past is over now, we have to think of the present.

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,100
One has to know that all of you, get Realization,

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,700
some people have certain problems,

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,220
on their different centers as I told you,

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,060
different types of problems people have.

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,100
Because of these problems, the Kundalini goes back

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:11,420
to its attention because Kundalini has to look after your problems.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,100
She’s your mother so she goes there, attends to that problem

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,300
and again she rises. But only thing you have to learn,

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,940
how to make her rise, how to cooperate with her,

18
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,820
how to understand your own problem and give additional help

19
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,500
to solve the problem.

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,100
Now you will be amazed that you just get rid of your

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,260
false identifications with yourself.

22
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,180
You become absolutely detached from that,

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,420
because you start talking in the language of chakras and centers.

24
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,980
You start saying that this center is bad, that center is bad,

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,460
this is not alright Mother, that’s wrong with me,

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,660
that is wrong with me, that’s all. You don’t say I’ve cancer,

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,540
you don’t say I’m mad, you don’t say I’m egoistical.

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,940
You just say : “Mother this center is not alright,

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,180
that center is not alright.”

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,340
Depending on the quality of your centers, the chakras,

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,820
as -they are, the ones who really are the channels

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,900
for the energy of God to flow in.

33
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,620
Regarding them, you have to be careful, how your chakras are.

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,020
Are you clean or not?

35
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,420
Some of you will find cool breeze flowing alright in the hand,

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,300
but may be, one chakra is catching.

37
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,540
On one chakra you will feel the heat, or you may feel the numbness,

38
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,900
you might feel also a kind of a

39
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,100
– we can say a kind of a tingling on certain fingers.

40
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,700
Now wherever there is tingling,

41
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,900
you must know there is a kind of a struggle going on

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,420
between those chakras and the Kundalini.

43
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,460
So you should just try to help your chakras, to awaken them

44
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,820
and also must know that every one of you

45
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,380
are part and parcel of the whole. You are awakened,

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,740
you are awakened to that part and so you have to be more careful.

47
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,180
Because if you suffer from some chakra, I can feel it.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,500
But if others, those who are not Realized,

49
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,580
I don’t feel it at all, I’m not bothered,

50
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,100
There can be any number of devils or anything,

51
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,540
doesn’t matter to me.

52
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,980
But if you people, who are Realized souls,

53
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,020
have a slight problem immediately I know

54
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,580
that you have this problem, my attention is diverted to that.

55
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,020
So you must understand that the attention is all the time there

56
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:45,620
to look after you, to give you a better guidance,

57
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,300
your Spirit is all the time working.

58
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,420
But you must learn how to take the guidance from your Spirit

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,860
that’s the main point; so nobody is lower or higher as he said.

60
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,180
I’ve seen some people who were declared as

61
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,380
drunkards, this, that, overnight, there are finished

62
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,140
[with that], they are perfect people, not only, but very good Sahaja Yogis.

63
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,820
So, you see, all these clouds have come on the sky of your being

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,020
in this life time, doesn’t matter, makes no difference,

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,100
but your past is great, that shows.

66
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,300
So you don’t have to worry as to how far you are where you are,

67
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,580
there’s no degree or anything to measure it.

68
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,980
They must be all aware already, otherwise you would not come to me,

69
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,580
first of all. And to get Realization itself, is very big.

70
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,100
Now there’s a very good seeker I know of, who came to me,

71
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,860
and he got his Realization but he did not feel it on his hand,

72
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,140
because he has a very bad Vishuddhi.

73
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,300
And with a bad Vishuddhi chakra,

74
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,660
you may not feel it in your hand, doesn’t matter,

75
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,220
but you’ll feel peaceful, you’ll feel joyful.

76
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,620
And you can feel it on top of your head, or others can feel it.

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,580
Gradually your fingers will start improving

78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,940
and they will give you better results.

79
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,580
For example, people who do hard work with their hands,

80
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,660
also their fingers can be numbed,

81
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,780
so we have to use certain methods, like looking after our hands.

82
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,940
This body now is a temple of God

83
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,100
so we have to look after it in a way, respectfully,

84
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,380
not for the way the – you see, the prostitutes,

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,780
when they want to sell their body they look after their body.

86
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,500
No, but respect, with respect to our body.

87
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,140
We have to look after ourselves in a way

88
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,740
that we should keep good health.

89
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,740
And to keep good health in Sahaja Yoga,

90
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,060
there are thousand and one things, which you have to know,

91
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,380
which is very easy to understand,

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,260
and which will be told to you for no price at all, nothing.

93
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,300
It is the Divine that is anxious that you should get it,

94
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,060
that you should settle down, that you should enjoy.

95
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,420
So you don’t have to be so anxious about it.

96
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,620
These anxieties must be given up, just try to understand your centers.

97
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,340
Now many of you who did feel the cool breeze.

98
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,300
But maybe, after some time, you may lose it, doesn’t matter.

99
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,580
You’ll go up and down, like that, doesn’t matter.

100
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,500
It does not mean that you’ve lost it, not at all.

101
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,420
Now supposing you try a method, a simple method,

102
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,540
that you first put your left hand towards my photograph

103
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,940
– just now you can try –

104
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,140
and right hand on the Mother Earth, let’s see.

105
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,500
Right hand on the Mother Earth,

106
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,260
that’s why I wanted to have it in the open,

107
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,500
but doesn’t matter now, this rain is good for you for the farmers,

108
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,340
let’s have it.

109
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,940
So now put your left hand like this,

110
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,220
and right hand – those who are sitting can put up like that

111
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,900
Like this. Back. Right hand like this, right. Not left, right.

112
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,780
[Yogi] …the ground. No like this.

113
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,700
Back. Yes, right hand.

114
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,420
Now what we are doing, the left hand side power,

115
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,580
is the emotional power.

116
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,900
Now if you have an emotional problem

117
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,140
– say, somebody has been taking drugs,

118
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,780
he’s a left sided person.

119
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,100
Some drugs are, LSD and all that right-sided,

120
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,460
but most of the drugs take you to the left side.

121
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,100
Gurus are left sided part.

122
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,340
Most of these problems are mental problems, are left sided problems.

123
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:21,980
But the problem of the intellectuals is right sided,

124
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,500
futuristic people is right sided.

125
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,180
People who are running the rat race are right sided,

126
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,900
you see, that kind of over activity, that kind of things.

127
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,180
On the contrary, those who have taken to drugs are left sided.

128
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,020
So first try with the left, let’s see.

129
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,340
Now put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

130
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,620
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

131
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,140
Now, put your left hand towards me.

132
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Gradually, you’ll find it will start flowing in you left hand.

133
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,300
Is it flowing?

134
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,900
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth,

135
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,820
because the Mother Earth takes away ;

136
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,980
you see, you are just earthing it, put it on it,

137
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,100
touching it, touch, touch it, you see, you are earthing yourself,

138
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,580
is a very simple thing.

139
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,940
Now left sided problems easily go to Mother Earth,

140
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,140
it’s true, but the best is to have a light.

141
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,900
Now, say, if you have a candle,

142
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,500
candle is the best, for left sided problems,

143
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,460
candle is the best thing to take it.

144
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,020
Because left sided problems, we can say, are cold problems,

145
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,820
or problems which arise from coldness.

146
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,180
You see, a person who becomes inactive.

147
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,980
Now see.

148
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,620
You just put your left hand towards me like this

149
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,380
and right hand towards a candle.

150
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,220
You ‘ll be amazed, sometimes,

151
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,940
the candle starts burning “tac”and drop like that

152
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,660
and sometimes it creates such black smoke that,

153
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,100
if it is next to a wall, you might find the all wall becoming black.

154
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,980
It’s very interesting to see how the candle reacts,

155
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,460
but you must have a photograph in front.

156
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,980
And there should be a candle in front of the photograph

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,300
and one candle like this to take it out.

158
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,020
Right, now, see better?

159
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,140
Alright?

160
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,940
You’ll feel it’s going down. You’ll feel from your head, you’ll feel,

161
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,260
you see, the pressure is going down.

162
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,100
Better now? Like this. Put the hand like that, back side,

163
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,220
not towards me, like that yes, yes. Now. Hum.

164
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,500
Now put left hand, if you ‘re sitting on the ground,

165
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,060
it’s better to put towards me, left hand.

166
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,620
It’s coming, it’s going, it’s working.

167
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,500
It’s like the energy, you see, that is coming through the photograph,

168
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,340
it’s pushing it down towards the light,

169
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,020
and the light burns it off : light gets awakened, by you.

170
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,820
It’s surprising but it does.

171
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,060
It’s better now? See. We work out, we feel it.

172
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,700
You will feel it yourself, there is nothing to certify.

173
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,220
You will feel yourself. Put your left hand towards me,

174
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,140
left hand towards me like this, yes.

175
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,980
You all will feel it yourself.

176
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,180
Now people who have been to gurus,

177
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,780
who have sort of schizophrenic attitude,

178
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,900
who are moody people, frantic, fits, they get all sorts of these,

179
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,100
to extreme to the least you see, who are emotional,

180
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,900
some women who cry too much, hysterics, all those things

181
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,340
can be controlled by this simple method

182
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
of putting left hand towards the photograph

183
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,700
and right hand towards a candle.

184
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,020
See, it’s working out?

185
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,620
You’ll feel the movement in your head you’ll feel. [Yogi] Yes.

186
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,020
Feeling it now. No?

187
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,020
[Yogi] So, it’s not there.

188
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,580
Now with the right hand up,

189
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,580
those who are running the rat race,

190
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,020
you see big people who think they must earn money and all,

191
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,540
they are running in the politics and

192
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,420
all that kind of a – another madness they have. You see,

193
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,420
that’s also a kind of madness, you see. [Shri Mataji laughs]

194
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,260
So for such people who are having a high blood pressure because of that,

195
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,540
they will have diabetes, they’ll have liver trouble.

196
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,540
Now even for any organ, you see, any organ you take, say heart,

197
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,380
in Sahaja Yoga we have for every organ, two types of nature.

198
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,980
One is the one that is lethargic and another that is overactive.

199
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,100
So supposing you are an overactive person,

200
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,140
then if you are an overactive person,

201
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,620
you are studying very hard

202
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,100
or thinking about the future or planning something,

203
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,940
then, you have a heart which is overactive.

204
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,300
Or you have an intestine which is overactive.

205
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,140
The liver is overactive, the whole system is overactive,

206
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,940
you’ll have high blood pressure

207
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,820
and all the problems of high blood pressure, constipation,

208
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,780
all these things go hand in hand in one personality.

209
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,060
Then, another personality could be a lethargic.

210
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,260
A person who has a lethargic heart,

211
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,100
may get a- has to get a bypass or something like that,

212
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,820
because the heart doesn’t pump.

213
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,700
You may have a lethargic intestine, such a person might

214
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,100
– whatever he eats you see, just goes to the bathroom,

215
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,620
sort of a thing or may be a lethargic liver.

216
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,940
When you have a lethargic liver then you might get allergies.

217
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,500
Allergies are caused by lethargic liver.

218
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,580
But, if you are an overactive person, if you are overactive,

219
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,660
then the same liver which was giving you these allergies,

220
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,580
will give you nausea, a feeling of a sickness,

221
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,140
migraine, and vomiting, emesis.

222
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,900
So there are two types of livers also.

223
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,620
We have two types of kidneys,

224
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,660
two types of, everything is two types.

225
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,900
So if you are a lethargic person, if you have a lethargic problem,

226
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,300
then what you have to do is to use the light.

227
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,540
For all the lethargic troubles, best is the light,

228
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,060
to use the light for lethargic troubles, this is left side.

229
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,700
And for the right sidedness, you can use the Mother Earth.

230
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,180
Mother Earth is the best or water and salt.

231
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,020
So water and salt is very good for people who are suffering

232
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,060
from an over-activity. Now how do you do it?

233
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,500
It’s good for both, but specially for them.

234
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,780
Like you have to put both the hands, first towards the photograph

235
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,340
both the feet in the water, with little salt.

236
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,140
Now if you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands,

237
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,100
equally the same, it’s alright, you don’t have to worry.

238
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,460
But supposing, one hand is more and one hand is less.

239
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,820
The hand that is less has to go before the photograph, always.

240
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,060
The hand that is less has to go towards the photograph

241
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,380
and another one has to go out.

242
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
And you’ll be amazed, the movement of the thing,

243
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,860
you will feel within yourself these balloons will be moving like that.

244
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,260
And you can feel it, that something is moving in your head,

245
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,260
you are getting relaxed. And gradually, you’ll become a master,

246
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,660
you will know how to handle this body,

247
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,700
absolutely, you‘ll become a master. And when you become master

248
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,300
– people have become masters in eight days, in eight days.

249
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,180
Once you become a master, then you can handle other bodies also

250
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,260
and help other people. It’s as simple as that.

251
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,100
So forget about the past, now the present,

252
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,740
we have to be in the present.

253
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,740
Is there any other question now?

254
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,060
[Yogi] … about mantras…

255
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,220
Mantras, yes. Now, we have got different centers,

256
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,540
and all these centers have got different deities.

257
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,020
As I told you, Lord Jesus Christ is here.,

258
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,660
Moses is here, Krishna is here. We have a chart of that.

259
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,540
We have books which will be given to you.

260
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,540
Now, we have to make, you see-

261
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,100
[Yogi] Excuse me. [Sahaja Yogi brings a big chart]

262
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,780
Yes this is the chart, you see, it’s beautifully done,

263
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,260
this one is very clear cut.

264
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,900
Now on different chakras, we have different deities

265
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,020
– come forward, you come forward and see, alright?

266
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,740
Alright, just let him see. You can pass it on.

267
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,540
[Yogi] May be there’s another chart.

268
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,900
Another chart, alright.

269
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,180
We have books, you see, why not give them books?

270
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,620
[Yogi] …They can have the other books

271
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,740
Open the books, you have got the chart in the books. Can you see?

272
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,180
Now gradually you see, we are trying to get a bigger place for you,

273
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,060
and we should really meet in a hall again. When are you going to –

274
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,420
Sahaja Yogi :… they can meet here first until we get a hall

275
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,340
Yes if you want, we might not be able to get but you can meet here.

276
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,220
You can always come and find out. Now, what is it?

277
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,940
There are books. Now, I’ll show.

278
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,660
These are small books just meant for the beginner, you see.

279
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,660
Now here, this is all given in short.

280
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,740
Now this is the chart you have to follow

281
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,780
– you can pass it on…

282
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,740
Give this to that gentleman also he wanted. Ah, you’ve got.

283
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,220
Gentleman : I got it here.

284
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,340
Oh I see. You also take.

285
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,780
Now. So the mantras are according to the chakra that is in problem.

286
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Supposing your Nabhi chakra is not alright. Alright?

287
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,140
And if you start saying the mantra of this one is no use.

288
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,980
So you must know what center is catching, from your fingers.

289
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,580
Now you can make out here, in this chart if you see

290
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,420
on this side, we have got written the numbers according to the centers.

291
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,820
On this side, if you see it clearly?

292
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,820
Now these are the numbers of the centers, alright?

293
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,300
So then, and also here it is written in this chart,

294
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,620
what are the different deities.

295
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,860
Now, all these deities should be first understood,

296
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,660
where are they, and when you have to say the mantras,

297
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,660
what you have to do is coil it into a proper Sahaja Yoga mantra

298
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,180
– so have you given that?

299
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,780
[Yogi] It’s not in these books..

300
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,100
But they will tell you.

301
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,580
The pattern has to be like this, which says,

302
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,580
whatever is the thing is, is woven into the complete

303
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,820
- I mean you are to be recommended, isn’t it? Somebody has to say.

304
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,100
So you have to say that

305
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,900
I am the one who has given you this knowledge.

306
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,540
So just you have to use that particular thing

307
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,380
which they will give you, the pattern, which is very simple.

308
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:26,900
And you have to use these names of these deities, different deities

309
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,980
according, and gradually you’ll be amazed it will work out.

310
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,260
But when you come here, they will tell you, it’s very simple,

311
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,980
it’s very simple. But you must know where the chakras are.

312
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,500
First of all, you must become sensitive.

313
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,420
So I would suggest that you must start using olive oil

314
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,900
for your fingers and for your toes, you see,

315
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,220
rub it nicely, make your fingers sensitive.

316
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,380
Because of various things, our hands have become gross, you see.

317
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,100
To feel it better, use some nice olive oil, massage it nicely.

318
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,580
And sometimes, if you wear the gloves in the night,

319
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,540
they can soften it also. You must soften, soft hands are better.

320
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,540
And the nails should not be very long, not very badly cut,

321
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,180
sort of things you see, and they are to be properly done.

322
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,420
So that when you use on others, they should not feel hurt

323
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,140
with your nails. But for yourself also,

324
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,260
you should not have very –right hand specially –

325
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,140
because you’ll have to use it like this here,

326
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,900
say, you have a Vishudhi chakra,

327
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,580
then you’ll have to use your Nabhi chakra like that

328
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,020
So what, actually, is the matter with you,

329
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,300
is to be first heard. So first you have to understand yourself,

330
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,220
what is your problem, what you are suffering from,

331
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,300
and then, how to correct.

332
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,180
If you could find out how to correct it and what is your problem,

333
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:53,580
then it is the easiest thing, is to coil a mantra to improve yourself.

334
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,660
Alright? It’s very simple.

335
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,940
Now you have met me only a day back, I should say,

336
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,900
but you’ll be amazed the knowledge

337
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,980
that you will have now about yourself, will be tremendous.

338
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,380
So first is SelfRealization, means you know yourself.

339
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,340
Once you know yourself, you start knowing others,

340
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,940
because we are all collectively conscious.

341
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,460
Those who are Realized souls become aware of others.

342
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,660
So first of all, if you want to see your own vibrations,

343
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,380
you have to put yourself into bandhan like this,

344
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,140
as I told you, like this.

345
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,820
Now, let’s do it.

346
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,740
Put your left hand towards me.

347
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,660
[Yogi] Like this towards Shri Mataji…

348
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,100
Now, these are your vibrations, whatever it is, now check,

349
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,420
see now. Which finger is burning? See, carefully.

350
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,700
Now this is left Nabbhi. Now which one is burning, be careful.

351
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,540
Pay attention.

352
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,420
Which one?

353
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,140
[Newcomer] [Inaudible]….

354
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,260
Which one?

355
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,420
May be he is constipated, is he? Does he get constipation?

356
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:43,380
Yes, it’s the liver, sign of liver, you see and also constipated.

357
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,620
So he is more a right sided person,

358
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,380
because right side is this thing.

359
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,700
So he has to put left to the right, like this. Alright?

360
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,900
[Newcomer] I’m just warm [?] and [?]..what could that mean?

361
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,380
You have a heart [problem]

362
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,860
[Newcomer] It’s allergy [?]

363
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,580
You put your right hand on your heart.

364
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,580
New Sahaja Yogini : [Inaudible]…. Rather warm.

365
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,420
Warm? Alright, doesn’t matter, and the other one?

366
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:15,180
Nothing. Alright. So put your left to the right. Left to the right.

367
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,460
[Yogi] You take it- when She says left to the right,

368
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,180
what you’re doing is not just this one,

369
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
put you are actually lifting the left side

370
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,820
And taking the grace from the right.

371
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,620
[Yogi] … because you’re balancing

372
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,340
And taking the grace, you see, on the right side,

373
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,620
because right side is showing nothing.

374
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,300
If the right side is showing nothing,

375
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,500
then what you are doing, you are lifting your left

376
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,020
which is slightly showing and you take up and bring it down,

377
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,260
with your right hand. Left to the right.

378
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,380
[Yogi] If you got problems on the right side,

379
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,940
you take from the left side, and over the top

380
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,740
and bring down the grace into the right side….

381
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,300
Then it’s the opposite, it’s as simple as that.

382
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,340
If she’s not- if you are not feeling at all on right hand,

383
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,900
then you have right hand problem.

384
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,420
You’re not feeling any vibrations, hum?

385
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,300
And left hand, you are feeling what?

386
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,460
[Yogi] Slightly warm on the left side….

387
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,260
So she has to go from right to left.

388
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,380
Just do it yourself now, get into balance

389
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,180
that’s the object of what Shri Mataji is saying.

390
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,820
[Yogini] Can we change hands?

391
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,460
Yes you can, you change hands.

392
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,860
[Yogi] Just to repeat it again, if you have abnormal sensations,

393
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,500
heat or something in your right hand, that means there is a damage

394
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,700
on that side, so you lift the left side

395
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,460
and you bring down the grace inti the right side.

396
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,500
Just do that if you got that problem.

397
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,060
Right to the left.

398
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,700
You take your right hand and put it like that.

399
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,180
[Yogi] If you got it in the other direction, you change hand as She said,

400
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,780
and you go the other way. It’s as simple as that.

401
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,980
Until it balances, until it works ou t. Keep doing until it works out.

402
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,580
Did you come to my program before?

403
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,200
No

404
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,300
That’s why. Just it has started, you see,

405
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,700
you have to get your Realization first of all, alright?

406
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,340
You come here. We’ll have to work it out, first of all,

407
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,860
as your Realization has not worked out, that’s why. It just started.

408
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,700
Hum? Let it work out. If the Realization works out,

409
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,380
then only you can feel it properly. That’s why.

410
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,140
Right side, not at all, so I was wondering why. Are you feeling ?

411
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,660
Good. Left hand what are you feeling?

412
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,940
Cool breeze, in the left hand and not on the right. Alright.

413
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,260
So what you do is to take left to the right

414
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,740
No, with the right hand.

415
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,340
[New Yogini] Oh, yes.

416
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:07,660
Gradually when you practice you will know. Better now? Good?

417
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,460
Good! He’s alright.

418
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,420
Are you alright? How are you feeling?

419
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,860
[Yogi] She’s asking you get heat on the left side or the left hand?

420
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,820
You can get it on left hand or left side, anywhere. Where are you getting?

421
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,180
Yes, you can get it on both the sides. Are you getting on right?

422
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,980
Then you put your left to the right.

423
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,740
No, no, no, left hand towards Me, and right hand like this,

424
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,460
Just raise it and bring it down like this. Don’t go back.

425
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Both the hands cool?

426
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,020
Look at Me. Left hand to Me, like this

427
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,740
and right hand you pick it up, come here and push it down.

428
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,340
She’s alright. You're alright.

429
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,300
What about you? Feeling cool breeze in both the hands?

430
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,900
The balance, yes. You start feeling the balance. That’s the best way.

431
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,580
You have a Vishuddhi that way. Doesn’t matter.

432
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,020
You put your left hand at the back of your chakra, here.

433
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,420
And put your right hand towards Me. Right hand.

434
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,860
What about you? Are you feeling?

435
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,740
Nothing? You never felt any cool breeze? Surprising.

436
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:39,020
You come from which state? UP!

437
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,420
[Hindi conversation]

438
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,420
New Sahaja Yogini : How long does that type of things ..?

439
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,580
Split of a second.

440
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,740
New Sahaja Yogini : How long will it last, balancing yourself?

441
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,140
[Yogi] How long will the balancing last you?

442
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,540
Last? I mean there is no timing for it.

443
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,500
It can last you for ever, but if you are a very wobbly type,

444
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,180
it may a little bit drop on, but you have to know how to do it, you see?

445
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,620
Now, we can say we are driving a car.

446
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,500
Now, how long will it last there?

447
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,860
As long as you keep it.

448
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,260
You are driving this car, alright?

449
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,860
Now, what is it? Are you feeling the balance now?

450
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,900
[New Yogini] I? Yes.

451
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,140
Good, then it’s good.

452
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,660
[Yogi] When it becomes imbalanced, that’s when you correct it.

453
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,140
[New Yogini] So, just trough the day, you just have to

454
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,700
No, no, no, no, no, no. Now, if you’re in balance,

455
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,580
there is nothing wrong, it’s alright, perfectly alright.

456
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,940
[Yogi] Can you get it when you haven’t had the Realization. You mean the balancing?

457
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,060
Have you got your Realization?

458
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,500
That is the first, that’s the first thing.

459
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,060
Otherwise you have not entered into the kingdom of God, isn’t it?

460
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,940
First thing is to have your Realization and then, now,

461
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,380
put your hands towards me.

462
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,660
[Yogi] Everybody should do that because

463
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,700
the more you put your hands to Mother,

464
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,580
the stronger the vibrations will flow.

465
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,100
Take this chance because it has to develop.

466
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,900
It might be a little uncomfortable, but just keep your hands to Mother.

467
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,020
You got the cool breeze in your hands, are you feeling?

468
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,780
Start, close your eyes.

469
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,020
What about you? No.

470
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,940
[Yogi] Those who haven’t their Realization, put their hands up please.

471
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,260
You come forward. I think best is

472
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,500
- and the rest of the people and Sahaja Yogis can see. Come along.

473
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,460
Now these people can be taught by Sahaja Yogis how to give Realization,

474
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,300
you are alright, three of you, go ahead. [People move]

475
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,420
And the Sahaja Yogis can meet them and talk to them.

476
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,340
Sit down, sit down.

477
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,580
Just like this. Put your hand.

478
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:46,060
Are you feeling? Do like that with your eyes, do a little bit.

479
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:52,420
Just press them, press your eyes hard, very hard- thrice.

480
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,300
Hard, press them hard, thrice.

481
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,060
Alright?

482
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:08,140
Not yet? It will come. It will work out.

483
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,500
Watch me, watch me here.

484
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:23,100
[Shri Mataji still holds a candle in front of Her face,

485
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,660
then in front of her right hand

486
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,380
and the new people are sent to another room

487
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,580
where Sahaja Yogis will work on them.]

488
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,100
Please take the baby out a little bit, because everybody tries to meditate.

489
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,380
Alright, just for a minute

490
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,460
Don’t feel guilty, none of you should feel guilty.

491
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,780
Everybody has certain problems still. You just go and say:

492
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,980
Mother I am not guilty. Close your eyes, just close your eyes.

493
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,980
There is nothing to feel guilty about anything whatsoever.

494
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,620
Whatever you have done is finished now.

495
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:21,420
You are entering into new awareness now. Into the kingdom of God.

496
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,420
Now you have become the spirit, and spirit cannot be guilty.

497
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,060
Forget about the people who have not come today with you. Anyone.

498
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,380
Just forget them. Just start to be yourself.

499
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:08,460
They can come later on and you can give them the full advantage.

500
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,340
Those who have got liver problem should take sugar

501
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,540
and they’ll tell you what is to be done.

502
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:54,740
If you have diabetes you can take salt.

503
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,700
And for other people who have arthritis and all that also,

504
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,020
I’ll ask you to bring some petrol or kerosene on,

505
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,780
if not you can come back again and take it from these.

506
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,500
Thank you very much. Enjoy your life.

507
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,100
May God bless you!
