244
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.210
All right.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:00.539
No one is dancing.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:03.500
I

253
00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:08.099

267
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.020
You can make a nice dress out of it.

Oh.

269
00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:45.640

298
00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:36.729

00:13:38.229 --> 00:13:38.260
You got one.

300
00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:41.460
All right.

301
00:13:41.469 --> 00:13:41.479
What

302
00:13:50.099 --> 00:13:50.559

303
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.239
All right.

304
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.340
So that

305
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.880
So now let's have the dance.

306
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:01.130
They're right,

307
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.520
so now where should we have it?

308
00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:05.280
This side?

309
00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:06.010
OK,

310
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.809
pick up your sauces and cups and

311
00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:10.409
clear a space here for the dance in front of another,

312
00:14:10.489 --> 00:14:11.599
in between these two,

313
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.010
in between these two poles.

314
00:14:13.849 --> 00:14:14.799
Just near the camera,

315
00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:16.650
build somewhere from there to the pole,

316
00:14:16.929 --> 00:14:19.909
clear a space and that whole circle there.

317
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.809
Yeah she's just feeling,

318
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:21.830
OK,

319
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:21.929
it's all the time on my head.

320
00:14:31.849 --> 00:14:33.440
You have it for a short time.

321
00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:39.080
Imagine I have it all the time on my head,

322
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:42.669
but I told them

323
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.289
you have to learn from me.

324
00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:47.369
I never complained

325
00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:52.739
though insite which you can imagine how terrible it is.

326
00:14:53.469 --> 00:14:53.479
Um,

327
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.429
let's,

328
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:55.469
let's.

329
00:14:58.729 --> 00:14:59.820
She's like that like that.

330
00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:09.179
I love the tea cups.

331
00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:13.010
Can you?

332
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.099
We have grown up.

333
00:15:26.309 --> 00:15:27.750
Some of you can sit this side,

334
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.049
yeah.

335
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.539
You sit here to watch from here.

336
00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:33.739
Keep

337
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.979
this open and move the wires out of the way.

338
00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:39.739
Sit on this,

339
00:15:39.859 --> 00:15:40.890
don't sit on.

340
00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:42.859
You can have something spread there,

341
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.280
I think.

342
00:15:48.989 --> 00:15:49.820
Over here,

343
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:50.700

Yeah well

345
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.960
Annan from Fiji has composed the song and he wants to sing it to you.

346
00:15:53.969 --> 00:15:53.989
All right,

347

348
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.049
All right.

00:16:20.809 --> 00:16:21.440
um,

353
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.729
perhaps you'd like to sit over there,

354
00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:25.330
sit over there with a with a mic.

355
00:16:26.239 --> 00:16:26.359

you're right.

362
00:16:28.289 --> 00:16:29.119
Come and do it here.

363
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:29.770
Sit,

364
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.880
sit over there facing the mic this way.

365
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:35.770
You

00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.580

371
00:16:55.619 --> 00:16:56.049

Yeah.

I did.

400
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.430
My face is looking like as if I've painted with 7 types of things on the.

401
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.180
Just look at that.

402
00:22:13.609 --> 00:22:14.609
I'm getting frightened.

403
00:22:20.329 --> 00:22:20.339
Hm.

404
00:22:23.439 --> 00:22:25.390
So now we have the dancing.

405
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.500
You if you people move a little bit this side,

406
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.890
the dancing girls can come easily come forward.

407
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:32.819
Well,

408
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.989
you sit in front of us.

409
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.199
Yeah,

410
00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:37.359
you can come and sit here,

411
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:37.959
right?

412
00:22:38.199 --> 00:22:38.920
You come and sit here,

413
00:22:39.119 --> 00:22:39.359
alright.

414
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.540
So the dancers to be in this area,

415
00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.339
not behind the.

416
00:22:59.569 --> 00:22:59.770
It

417
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.819
So the wires looped around the

418
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.979
I think you better close the sites because it's very cold,

419
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:16.560
I think,

420
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.060
for people that side.

421
00:23:19.339 --> 00:23:19.609
They may

422
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.329
closed outsides.

423
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.280
Keep it open for their entrance there.

424
00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:53.030
Oh

425
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.550
Uh,

426
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.130
that's it,

427
00:24:03.189 --> 00:24:03.630
see,

428
00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:04.430
that will,

429
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.979
that will not give such a.

430
00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.300
It's big,

431
00:24:07.329 --> 00:24:07.810
uh,

432
00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:08.209
yeah,

433
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:08.619
see,

434
00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:08.849
now

435
00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:10.089
when they are dancing,

436
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.770
if you put it,

437
00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:11.449
see this,

438
00:24:11.489 --> 00:24:12.439
put it in front.

439
00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:14.119
See the colours will change.

440
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260
No.

441
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:18.310
Beside,

442
00:24:18.459 --> 00:24:18.790
beside

443
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:20.869
Make it double.

444
00:24:23.239 --> 00:24:23.319
colour,

445
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.229
it won't be so much shining there.

446
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.640
Maybe double I think maybe.

447
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.250
Yes,

448
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:30.939
when the,

449
00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.849
when your face is showing that

450
00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.130
looks nice,

451
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:34.780
yes.

452
00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:37.260
Give one bear,

453
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.150
one there,

454
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:38.829
and one here,

455
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:39.420
you see.

456
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.579
Make it fourfold,

457
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.060
yes.

458
00:24:43.209 --> 00:24:44.069
So when they dance,

459
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:44.430
you see,

460
00:24:44.439 --> 00:24:45.739
the face will be showing

461
00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:46.660
reddish.

462
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:48.839
It won't be such a

463
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.050
thing on the face.

464
00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:51.989
Yes,

465
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.180
you may change it.

466
00:24:53.979 --> 00:24:55.069
Later on if you want,

467
00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:55.780
let them come.

468
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.069
Where is she?

469
00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.709
Velma?

470
00:25:00.569 --> 00:25:01.729
the spectacles.

471
00:25:02.869 --> 00:25:03.500
It's here.

472
00:25:03.829 --> 00:25:05.619
Somebody has my spectacles,

473
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:06.050
Mody

474
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.030
Mody has.

475
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.349
Almost.

476
00:25:18.239 --> 00:25:19.000
Much more soothing,

477
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.869
isn't it this way?

478
00:25:26.699 --> 00:25:27.109
Yeah.

479
00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:40.439
You

480
00:25:42.209 --> 00:25:43.819
Now it doesn't give such a light to me.

481
00:25:45.329 --> 00:25:45.689
Better.

482
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.569
What's happening?

483
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.130
Television are not working.

484
00:25:58.709 --> 00:25:58.780
Uh

485
00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:07.910
Oh,

486
00:26:07.989 --> 00:26:08.750
it's burning.

487
00:26:11.619 --> 00:26:12.260
Just throw it out.

488
00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:13.829
Just take it out.

489
00:26:15.849 --> 00:26:16.079
Leave it,

490
00:26:16.219 --> 00:26:16.579
leave it.

491
00:26:16.819 --> 00:26:17.260
Take it out,

492
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:17.880
that one also.

493
00:26:17.979 --> 00:26:19.250
I don't know what you did.

494
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.489
You should not touch.

495
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.300
You see,

496
00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:21.540
you,

497
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.829
you should not touch it.

498
00:26:23.459 --> 00:26:24.219
That's the problem.

499
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.619
You should not touch it,

500
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:28.000
you see.

501
00:26:29.099 --> 00:26:30.520
Keep it away from it,

502
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.530
so we

503
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.349
should be.

504
00:26:33.319 --> 00:26:34.150
Then it's

505
00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:35.510
just about that,

506
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:35.880
you see?

507
00:26:36.939 --> 00:26:37.310
Just,

508
00:26:38.359 --> 00:26:39.550
just hold it,

509
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.170
yes.

510
00:26:41.219 --> 00:26:41.949
On top of that,

511
00:26:41.979 --> 00:26:42.839
you could have done it,

512
00:26:42.939 --> 00:26:43.290
yeah.

513
00:26:45.609 --> 00:26:45.729
It is,

514
00:26:45.819 --> 00:26:46.010
ah,

515
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:46.459
hold it,

516
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:46.859
hold it,

517
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.729
just hold it.

518
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.300
When they dance,

519
00:26:49.339 --> 00:26:49.979
then hold it,

520
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.510
that's all.

521
00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:55.189
No,

522
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:55.339
no,

523
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:56.660
that's very open one.

524
00:26:56.709 --> 00:26:56.939
You see,

525
00:26:56.989 --> 00:26:57.750
that's very open.

526
00:26:57.829 --> 00:26:58.459
That's why

527
00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.089
it has no cover also,

528
00:27:00.349 --> 00:27:02.300
but you can hold it when they start dancing.

529
00:27:02.949 --> 00:27:03.829
Don't tie it up.

530
00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:13.699
Yeah

531
00:27:19.719 --> 00:27:21.069
Stand from front,

532
00:27:21.719 --> 00:27:22.479
not for the veneer,

533
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:22.719
yes,

534
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.510
that's better.

535
00:27:27.949 --> 00:27:28.550
Just hold it,

536
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.709
it's better for a while.

537
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.459
so

538
00:27:40.339 --> 00:27:41.119
The pictures

539
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:44.400
That's it.

540
00:27:46.849 --> 00:27:47.420
Give it a banda.

541
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.969
I wanted to have the picture of the children dancing this.

542
00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:58.339
Man works.

543
00:27:59.449 --> 00:27:59.650
Now,

544
00:27:59.849 --> 00:28:00.060
again,

545
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.199
it's all right.

546
00:28:08.959 --> 00:28:09.670
It's very nice.

547
00:28:09.709 --> 00:28:10.339
The colours are,

548
00:28:10.589 --> 00:28:10.979
see,

549
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:11.979
it's all red.

550
00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:14.569
Except for me,

551
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.689
everybody's looking red.

552
00:28:15.729 --> 00:28:17.020
I don't know what's the matter.

553
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.140
Tina,

554
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:24.969
everybody's looking at that.

555
00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:32.859
let them come.

556
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:35.800
Come along now.

557
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:38.790
All right,

558
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.989
the music has started.

559
00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:46.349
Oh,

560
00:28:46.439 --> 00:28:46.969
very well,

561
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:48.560
very good.

562
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:13.050
What

563
00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:13.729
what

564
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.040
where did the land.

565
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:00.969
Who has taught them?

566
00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:08.079
Really.

567
00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:13.640
That's a lint of it.

568
00:30:28.949 --> 00:30:28.959
Oh
