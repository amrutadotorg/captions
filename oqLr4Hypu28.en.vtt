00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:20.000
in one of my lectures

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:22.800
i have talked to you about the emotional

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.800
intelligence

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.279
that is what we should try to invite

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.239
emotional intelligence that means

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.800
the intelligence that is based on

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.800
emotions

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.280
unless and until we become emotionally

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.039
intelligent

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.440
our society cannot

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:52.719
emotional intelligence you care

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.840
and you enjoy caring

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.840
you do everything

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.800
for others with a great

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.600
emotional understanding not for one

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.040
child

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.240
not for one son but for everyone

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.000
you have to be emotionally intended

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.400
some children are born like this but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.960
some are to be made like that

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.960
that they should be emotionally internal

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.040
because if the mother and father

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.159
are money oriented very selfish

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.680
they won't allow their child

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.640
to give anything to others so such a

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.640
child will grow

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.600
into a very funny type of a person

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.759
and will never do anything for anybody

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.640
not even for his own country

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.720
why should he do it everything for

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.560
selfishness

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.840
then such people indulge into corruption

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.240
indulge into all kinds of things which

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.880
are

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.880
only selfish in attitude

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.800
now we are talking of collectivity

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.720
in collectivity we do for others

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.080
we enjoy doing for others we love giving

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.319
things to others

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.680
not for our yourself because your

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.480
children will also

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.599
become the same kind and they'll only

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.599
bother about themselves

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.680
this emotional intelligence has to be

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.120
brought in our life in our pattern

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.879
that we have are we emotionally

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.560
intelligent or we are just

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.959
intelligent or emotional

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.840
both things are wrong if you are just

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.879
intelligent you can become very dry

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.040
person

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.879
you may just have few friends maybe you

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.040
may not have

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.280
and you will always try to preserve

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.319
yourself away

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.400
from the collectivity

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.920
and if you are emotional you will be

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.920
attached only to one person

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.239
attached to one child maybe attached to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.080
one person

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.640
to someone even in the society

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.680
for no rhyme and reason why why are you

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.680
attached to one person

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.760
why are you bothered about one person

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.480
only

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.760
all such people fall into such terrible

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.400
praying

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.799
in the politics you have seen how people

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.000
try to help their own sons and our

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.000
daughters and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.760
this and that and we indians have

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.840
suffered a lot with this

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.840
kind of a emotional attachment

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.799
so according to

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:01.840
ethics emotional

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.840
intelligence is the highest quality

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.040
by which you give to others

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:16.720
you care for others for everybody

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.720
and you become very very collected

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.560
now exclusiveness is another fashion

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.800
that's very much that it's exclusive

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.400
because you don't want to be one of the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.440
multitudes you want to be

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:39.040
exclusive you should be

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:42.000
exclusive in emotional intelligence

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.479
not on other things that is the best

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.840
thing

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.199
you can have as i agree i am just a

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.280
woman

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:54.840
i'm just a mother but what i have

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.919
is really the emotional

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.039
intelligence ocean of it

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.919
and from that i know

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.919
about everyone

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.039
i understand about a book and all this

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.560
work has been done

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:16.800
because of that quality in my head

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:21.199
i am not attached to one person or to

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.639
one style whatever you say

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:27.440
i can understand because i am at a level

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.600
where i can understand everything that

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.360
you are doing

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.479
to achieve that you try to develop

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.600
emotional intelligence here the children

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.280
won't even

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.280
give a toy for somebody to play

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.759
even the mother is like that the father

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.080
is like that extremely selfish

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.120
and we must have our own say everything

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.000
should be our own

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.360
this has to go this has to go from

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.639
american

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.880
especially because they are the leading

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:08.720
nation in this kind of selfishness

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.199
what selfishness they have done i did

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.360
not count but you know that

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.639
you go and ask the people of canada

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.919
mexico

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:21.520
peru all this they will tell

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:25.600
being selfish they are not ashamed

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.600
they are exploiters they are not ashamed

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.520
nobody can even tell them because they

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.800
think they are very rich people

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.600
but all these riches will not give him

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.800
the joy

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:46.080
of life joy of life is only in

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.720
the emotional intelligence

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.840
if you don't have that it becomes very

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.560
dry

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.919
life becomes very hot unbearable

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.120
horrible

00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:00.479
and even the family

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.360
gets broken up if there is no emotional

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:06.800
intelligence in the family

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.800
i have known so many women who have

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.319
had three marriages five marriages i

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.199
don't know how they can do it

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:16.240
but they have done because this lack of

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:19.919
emotional interest

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.000
it is something that is a sense of

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:24.639
giving

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.840
it is not that you are sacrificing

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:28.560
anything no

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.000
that's also another idea that we have to

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.000
bear these nothing of the color

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.680
look at the life of christ he gave his

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.039
life

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:42.160
why what was the need for him to do that

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:44.639
behind it was the truth

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.800
when you have truth with you the light

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.599
of the truth the force of the truth the

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.800
strength of the

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:54.879
truth you become emotionally

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.759
intelligent you understand

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:58.080
that if you really love something then

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:01.840
you

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:05.039
have to undergo every kind

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.919
of trouble you have to tolerate a lot of

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:08.160
nausea

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:09.039
i know it's too much to say but i

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.199
thought that

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:16.879
for the special puja i should

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:21.199
say something about the sound

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:24.400
in our ashrams or in our programs

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:26.650
or wherever we are we should remember

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.400
this point that are we

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.599
[Music]

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:35.519
having that emotional intelligence when

00:08:31.599 --> 00:08:35.519
we are trying to talk about sahaja yoga

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.200
why do i need to be every place to tell

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.800
them

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.320
what is the need you can tell them

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.600
if you have that emotional intelligence

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.920
everybody will listen to you why not not

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.920
necessarily i should go everywhere

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.600
and talk to them how many countries can

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.480
i do

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.120
and the reaction to it's so beautiful

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.320
and so

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.880
nice it's very surprising like in a

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.000
country like benin country almost lives

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.160
there

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.600
all black people they all have become

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.320
sahaja yogis

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.320
nine thousand

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.360
how could i capture that just think of

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.959
that

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.560
nine thousand people summative then

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:26.480
also other countries have seen just

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.839
this is the power of emotional

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.680
intelligence

00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:34.800
that captures the heart of the people

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:38.880
you may have any amount of property

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.440
money everything people will abhor

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.040
all right so you may say what's wrong

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.839
what's wrong with this

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:53.040
that you are harming the greatest

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:53.040
thing is the human being

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:57.279
and the politicians they are horrible as

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.519
they say

00:09:57.279 --> 00:10:01.600
why because they have no emotional

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:05.040
intelligence

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.240
also as administrators

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.680
they are very much difficult

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.240
because they have no emotional

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.240
intelligence

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:20.959
all these people are devoid of that

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:23.600
great quality of emotional intelligence

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:24.399
if your country is very progressive i

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.399
must say

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.920
you must progress in emotional

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:30.959
intelligence

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.079
that way they are philosophized i know

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:35.360
americans are known to be

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:38.880
philanthropists but behind that

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.880
is they want to have power

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:47.120
they want to rule people with that money

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:49.120
it's not emotional uh intelligence is

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.120
they just want to rule

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:56.160
if they start some sort of a charity

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.360
that is just to have a big name on the

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.480
television

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.839
or to have a very big
