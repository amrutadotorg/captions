00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:03.357
Talk before award in Turkey at Diwali Puja

00:00:03.382 --> 00:00:06.397
After two minutes,

00:00:07.586 --> 00:00:10.419
professor Voronov is here

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:14.793
and he wants to give Me some special award

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.208
from St Petersburg University.

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:23.229
So, I will request you all to be sitted,

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.425
it will take hardly ten minues
for the whole thing.

00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:35.864
So, before that, I must say the

00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:39.865
weddings went off very well despite the fact

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:43.464
it’s Turkey and it’s very different

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:48.915
from India where you can get everything very easily.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.453
And you all are looking very happy.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.235
Keep this joy all the time

00:00:58.327 --> 00:01:01.955
and be kind and gentle with each other.

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.943
As I’ve said you have to soothe others.

00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:10.561
You have to take up the problems of each other

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.905
and don’t discuss your past,
don’t talk about your past.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.981
That’s one thing very wrong,

00:01:18.013 --> 00:01:22.142
that makes life unnecessarily miserable.

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:29.200
Past is over and, now,
the reality starts.

00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:34.687
Enjoy each other’s company,
try to find good points of

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:38.725
another person.

00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:42.259
If you want to find bad points

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.415
that’s not going to give you any joy,
it’s not going to help you.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:51.372
But if you start finding
the good points of another person,

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:55.561
that not only that you will be very happy,

00:01:55.577 --> 00:01:59.729
but also you’ll imbibe those good points.

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:04.625
Always try to see each other’s good points,

00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:08.653
never criticize each other for small things,

00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:12.060
for petty things.
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:15.128
We are saints, we are angels,

00:02:15.153 --> 00:02:19.607
we cannot be like ordinary
stupid people who fight

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:22.286
and create problems in their life.

00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:25.584
We are here to make each other happy

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:29.816
and to make everyone happy;

00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:32.361
all the Sahaja Yogis to be happy.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.689
The whole society of Sahaja Yoga

00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:37.938
should be of a very different type.

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:42.228
And there are so many children
who are Realized souls,

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:46.090
who are great saints,
seers, who want to be born

00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:51.864
and they’ll be only born to Sahaja Yogis who are

00:02:52.597 --> 00:02:58.037
Sahaj by temperament

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.805
and who are peaceful,

00:03:01.853 --> 00:03:05.514
who try to seek peace everywhere,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.868
and who are very large hearted.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:12.903
All such people will have very great children.

00:03:13.094 --> 00:03:16.976
May God bless you all.
