00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.140
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:13.233
brothers and sisters from Europe

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:17.883
and our brothers and sisters from the host countries,

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:22.713
We welcome you to our concert this evening.

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:25.413
I'll let my colleague, Alex Henshaw

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:29.353
tell you what we have for your entertainment

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:35.003
and hope that you all enjoy, very
much, what we have to present for you.

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.533
Thank you.

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:52.047
So with a packed programme tonight, we'll start

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:55.077
with a saxophone raga, Raag Jog

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:59.967
and this is with Nicholas Buff on the saxophone

00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:02.478
and Sandesh playing tabla.

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:25.118
We have another raga, this time a synthesiser raga,

00:23:25.136 --> 00:23:27.168
Bhageshwari

00:23:27.168 --> 00:23:30.512
and Dhananjay Dhumal is playing this,

00:23:30.512 --> 00:23:35.167
again accompanied by Sandesh on the tabla.

01:11:42.122 --> 01:11:47.677
So our next item we have a sitar raag.

01:11:47.687 --> 01:11:51.947
This is performed by Avaneendra Sheolika

01:11:51.981 --> 01:11:56.343
and again accompanied by Sandesh on tabla.

01:12:17.308 --> 01:12:20.603
Jai Shri Mataji,

01:12:20.609 --> 01:12:22.803
in today's concert, tonight's concert

01:12:22.823 --> 01:12:26.593
I've decided to play Raag Puriya Kalyan

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:36.159
I'll play Alaap, Jyot, Jala, the pure description of raga

01:12:36.166 --> 01:12:39.489
followed by free composition

01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:46.916
Vilambit, a slow one. It is set to Teen
Tal, a rhythmic cycle of sixteen beats.

01:12:46.926 --> 01:12:52.226
Followed by Mandela Jhap Taal,
a rhythmic cycle of ten beats.

01:12:52.241 --> 01:12:58.071
Then again a true Teen Tal, a fast
one. It is set to Teen Tal again.

01:12:58.104 --> 01:13:02.711
a rhythmic cycle of sixteen beats.
Raag Puriya Kalyan. Thank you.

02:21:03.827 --> 02:21:08.444
Just now we have heard all these four artists.

02:21:08.444 --> 02:21:13.187
The first one is an Australian.

02:21:14.937 --> 02:21:17.702
I only know his surname, but I don't know his name.

02:21:17.702 --> 02:21:19.342
What is his name?

02:21:19.342 --> 02:21:21.842
Nick Buff

02:21:21.842 --> 02:21:22.842
Nick?

02:21:22.842 --> 02:21:31.669
Right! So his name is Nick and I heard him before also.

02:21:31.687 --> 02:21:34.909
But this instrument that he played

02:21:34.949 --> 02:21:38.969
I've never heard anybody playing
classical Indian Music with that.

02:21:39.081 --> 02:21:41.581
I think it must be very difficult to play

02:21:41.581 --> 02:21:46.864
with that particular saxophone that you have seen,

02:21:46.903 --> 02:21:51.314
but how he is played it because
Indian Music is all melodious,

02:21:51.314 --> 02:21:54.513
and it cannot be played in parts and it's...

02:21:54.523 --> 02:21:57.103
I was amazed how he managed it

02:21:57.171 --> 02:22:02.840
and another thing which has really
enamoured me about him is this,

02:22:02.858 --> 02:22:10.500
that my father had a great desire to spread our Indian Classical Music all over the world.

02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:13.668
And he said if you spread this music

02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:22.738
then all kinds of music, which are
not music but are noises, will vanish.

02:22:22.753 --> 02:22:29.797
And so people should know this classical music, then they can play any other music they want.

02:22:29.797 --> 02:22:33.423
His ambition was like that,

02:22:33.442 --> 02:22:40.983
and I am so happy that Baba Mama
has started a beautiful academy,

02:22:41.013 --> 02:22:46.002
very beautiful land he has got in Nagpur.

02:22:45.999 --> 02:22:51.688
And from that academy, this
gentleman, Mr Nick has come up.

02:22:51.725 --> 02:22:54.535
And in such a short time,

02:22:54.555 --> 02:23:00.246
so remarkable, he is a genius, must be
something special that in such a short time

02:23:00.247 --> 02:23:05.977
to play a raag, like Jog, is very difficult.

02:23:05.992 --> 02:23:09.557
Only great musicians play that I have seen.

02:23:09.587 --> 02:23:12.087
I have heard Vilayat Khan Sahib

02:23:12.087 --> 02:23:17.344
and also I've heard our....

02:23:17.353 --> 02:23:20.484
his nephew as you have known him very well.

02:23:20.517 --> 02:23:27.618
So, all these difficult ragas, I thought
he'd play Yaman or something like that,

02:23:27.628 --> 02:23:31.558
but here he plays Jog and so well:

02:23:31.602 --> 02:23:35.043
like any other great musician.

02:23:35.084 --> 02:23:38.888
So actually my eyes were filled with tears,

02:23:38.933 --> 02:23:44.553
I don't know what to say that I never knew
this academy can produce such good artists

02:23:44.553 --> 02:23:47.053
and such good talent would be utilised.

02:23:47.066 --> 02:23:50.146
It's more creditable because he is not an Indian.

02:23:50.146 --> 02:23:55.866
And in such a short time, he has
picked up this difficult music.

02:23:55.878 --> 02:24:02.177
It's really, absolutely an impossible feat.

02:24:02.197 --> 02:24:07.127
And I have no words actually, to describe My joy,

02:24:07.137 --> 02:24:13.017
that one of the desires My father had, is fulfilled.

02:24:13.018 --> 02:24:18.918
Now once we establish this academy,
many people will go. I am sure to it

02:24:18.918 --> 02:24:24.444
and will learn this. In that, of
course, Guruji has helped a lot,

02:24:24.454 --> 02:24:28.904
Sandesh has helped a lot, Jane
has helped, everybody has helped.,

02:24:28.928 --> 02:24:32.774
but still, I must say is creditable to the talent.

02:24:32.808 --> 02:24:34.904
I never knew Australians were that talented.

02:24:34.904 --> 02:24:37.642
They are! You will see their talent now.

02:24:37.656 --> 02:24:42.172
They are quite talented. I think it
is Shri Ganesha's blessings on them,

02:24:42.159 --> 02:24:44.302
that they're so talented.

02:24:44.302 --> 02:24:50.812
But this playing Indian Music
you see, it's not an easy thing

02:24:50.811 --> 02:24:56.363
And it's remarkable, I don't know,
maybe My father's blessings are working

02:24:56.375 --> 02:24:59.673
or I don't know what's
happening to this academy, that

02:24:59.684 --> 02:25:09.936
such a brilliant and such a beautiful, melodious
rendering of this Jog Raga you have heard.

02:25:09.956 --> 02:25:21.827
I am very grateful to him for really reproducing
something, that is an impossible feat.

02:25:21.847 --> 02:25:39.681
The second person for whom a great love,
is as you know, is our little Dhananjay.

02:25:39.691 --> 02:25:48.231
He is such a young boy and he is also, I
think, is a born genius, something like that.

02:25:48.258 --> 02:25:53.541
These days lots of prodigies are born. I
think he is also a prodigy or something.

02:25:53.557 --> 02:26:02.739
See he plays so well. I mean to play this raga, in such a beautiful manner and this is a western instrument again.

02:26:02.748 --> 02:26:08.731
To play on this western instrument,
he really... if you know Vivaldi,

02:26:08.731 --> 02:26:13.791
if you have heard Vivaldi, many a
time it sounded like Vivaldi today.

02:26:13.806 --> 02:26:15.828
Do you think so?

02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:22.668
And this is something remarkable
again at this young age.

02:26:22.667 --> 02:26:28.585
I don't know what to say, but all My
blessings and I take the bad eye from them.

02:26:28.605 --> 02:26:32.295
Nobody should do anything wrong to these boys.

02:26:32.317 --> 02:26:36.155
He couldn't come. It's a big story. He couldn't come.

02:26:36.181 --> 02:26:40.713
They said, "You pay no income tax." At this
young age who can pay income tax in India?

02:26:40.727 --> 02:26:43.227
And moreover he's the son of a farmer.

02:26:43.227 --> 02:26:47.193
In India, farmers are not paying any income tax.

02:26:47.211 --> 02:26:53.368
So, the Italians thought, they are
not paying income tax, so how can they go?

02:26:53.382 --> 02:26:56.931
They might start working here or
something. I don't know what was the idea.

02:26:56.950 --> 02:27:05.388
but thank God, it came into My...
just into My own inspiration

02:27:05.405 --> 02:27:07.538
I felt I better tell Guido.

02:27:07.555 --> 02:27:09.658
And Guido knows somebody there, luckily.

02:27:09.658 --> 02:27:14.176
Now anybody who doesn't get visas, tell Guido.

02:27:17.496 --> 02:27:19.496
For Italy!

02:27:19.477 --> 02:27:22.827
Because they are very troublesome. They have
become very funny now all these Italians.

02:27:22.868 --> 02:27:26.297
I don't know, but they have become quite funny.

02:27:26.308 --> 02:27:31.017
And when they are coming only for 2 or 3
days, what is there to trouble them so much.

02:27:31.017 --> 02:27:37.417
So he went down and he...

02:27:37.437 --> 02:27:46.277
Guido had told somebody there, whom
he knows and they gave him the visa.

02:27:46.285 --> 02:27:48.285
So he came to the Customs

02:27:48.276 --> 02:27:51.095
and the Customs said, "Why are
you carrying this big instrument?"

02:27:51.129 --> 02:27:54.719
They thought he was coming here to sell it, you see.

02:27:54.709 --> 02:28:01.869
He said, "You see, I am going for a programme of
Shri Mataji." In India! He showed him the badge.

02:28:01.893 --> 02:28:05.539
The Customs know Me there very
well. They said. "All right. Go."

02:28:05.559 --> 02:28:08.115
But surprisingly here in...

02:28:13.185 --> 02:28:20.505
when he came here, the Airport Authority again,
objected to his carrying this instrument.

02:28:20.505 --> 02:28:24.745
Again he showed My badge and
they said, "All right, go!"

02:28:24.767 --> 02:28:32.157
So, I think now Sahaja Yoga is... everywhere
is acceptable, at least in Italy it is now.

02:28:32.184 --> 02:28:34.684
And it's a very great thing.

02:28:44.986 --> 02:28:49.179
There is something about Italians I've felt always,

02:28:49.194 --> 02:28:55.799
that they are very simple-hearted people, good people and also something like Indians.

02:28:55.843 --> 02:29:01.569
You see, their ways are different little bit, but they can cheat as much as Indians can cheat.

02:29:05.799 --> 02:29:11.959
But Indian cheating is different and
the Italian cheating is another style.

02:29:12.763 --> 02:29:20.560
But still, I must say they are very sensitive to
spirituality and they all have great love for Me.

02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:25.937
"Madre." All the time they say and they just... I tell you, I am surprised how they accept Me.

02:29:25.950 --> 02:29:28.997
This I can't expect from Germans,

02:29:29.010 --> 02:29:32.030
I can't expect this from English,

02:29:32.030 --> 02:29:34.530
from the France, of course no question.

02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:46.491
So the authorities also here are spiritual

02:29:46.504 --> 02:29:49.691
and surprisingly, when I was coming from Russia,

02:29:49.713 --> 02:29:56.956
in Moscow airport, we met
a very well known designer.

02:29:56.992 --> 02:29:58.956
They say he is the guru of designers

02:29:58.956 --> 02:30:01.456
and he just asked for his Realisation.

02:30:01.456 --> 02:30:06.204
Then another lady came, she is very well
known here, she also asked for Realisation.

02:30:06.199 --> 02:30:09.704
Then another gentleman, who was some
sort of a minister or something,

02:30:09.704 --> 02:30:13.959
he also asked for his Realisation. Can you imagine?

02:30:13.964 --> 02:30:18.984
In what country, people can
ask Realisation like this?

02:30:18.994 --> 02:30:23.024
And now they are trying to contact us.

02:30:23.042 --> 02:30:26.142
So we are very well placed here in Italy, I think

02:30:26.152 --> 02:30:34.422
and I feel quite safe with these people,
because they have respect for Mother.

02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:36.510
They have respect for children

02:30:36.554 --> 02:30:41.180
and that the Ganesh Puja should be
here is a very, very, good thing,

02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:46.675
because the respect for children is
as mush as in India, maybe more.

02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:50.495
In this country you don't
find funny things happening.

02:30:50.524 --> 02:30:56.235
So tomorrow again, we will
have a nice session of Puja,

02:30:56.225 --> 02:31:00.939
but Sandesh is the one, I would say,

02:31:00.939 --> 02:31:07.235
for whom I must thank him, because I was
thinking his hands would be paining now.

02:31:09.744 --> 02:31:13.998
We have known him very well and
every time he plays something new.

02:31:14.010 --> 02:31:20.860
He is working so hard and he
has achieved such excellence.

02:31:20.890 --> 02:31:24.600
Now about Avi, I don't know what to say,

02:31:24.615 --> 02:31:27.115
because he is nothing but creativity personified.

02:31:27.115 --> 02:31:28.852
I don't know...

02:31:28.872 --> 02:31:33.392
Baba Mama told me, "I don't know how he
creates things, how it comes to him."

02:31:33.391 --> 02:31:40.945
and such creation of this
raga, is not so easy you know.

02:31:40.961 --> 02:31:43.461
It just has so much expansion.

02:31:43.461 --> 02:31:51.726
But the way he changed every
time, a new sort of a composition.

02:31:51.716 --> 02:31:57.966
But they don't have anybody like Vivaldi
or 'Waldi' or anyone in front of them

02:31:57.963 --> 02:32:01.437
and the way he was really, I tell you...

02:32:01.470 --> 02:32:03.730
I don't know how to say,

02:32:03.730 --> 02:32:09.960
but I am so lucky that even in this country
I can hear and enjoy such nice music

02:32:09.969 --> 02:32:12.880
and that you all are enjoying such nice music,

02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:16.350
thanks to these four young people.

02:32:16.359 --> 02:32:22.918
Now, because it was Ganesha's
Day, we are celebrating here,

02:32:22.947 --> 02:32:26.208
I thought we should get all the
young people who are not yet married.

02:32:26.235 --> 02:32:30.240
But I am told here, Avi is getting married, so
next year he will not come for Ganesha Puja,

02:32:30.260 --> 02:32:32.760
but can come for another Puja.

02:32:34.402 --> 02:32:37.742
And Sandesh, I don't know why
he doesn't want to get married.

02:32:40.584 --> 02:32:43.853
So it was not to be done by married people,

02:32:43.898 --> 02:32:48.733
but Baba Mama sent somebody from
there to show what they have achieved

02:32:48.739 --> 02:32:52.315
And this Nick has married an Indian lady

02:32:52.326 --> 02:32:56.446
and that was really remarkable.

02:32:56.446 --> 02:33:00.366
So, we all should give them a big, big, big hand.

02:33:30.019 --> 02:33:36.459
Now I am sorry for this cold weather, suddenly
it has come, I think, with Russians I think.

02:33:38.999 --> 02:33:42.549
In Russia, I was dressed up
like an Eskimo all the time.

02:33:44.095 --> 02:33:53.972
And this is a very cold today, but I think daytime will be good tomorrow and also it might improve a little bit.

02:33:53.991 --> 02:34:00.473
There is one thing I have to explain,
because Michael Fogarty asked me a question

02:34:00.487 --> 02:34:07.003
that, "What is the tradition? Is the Classical
Music is first or the other thing is?"

02:34:07.003 --> 02:34:09.969
Actually, we have changed it a little bit here.

02:34:09.969 --> 02:34:21.729
Why? Because they come out with very good films and last time they showed us a very beautiful film from America,

02:34:21.739 --> 02:34:27.189
and all their programmes were very
good, but they needed darkness.

02:34:27.187 --> 02:34:32.059
So we started their programme
after 10 o'clock or 10.30,

02:34:32.059 --> 02:34:38.049
because then we said all right, the classical music
we can have even in the daytime doesn't matter,

02:34:38.082 --> 02:34:40.619
So we changed, but today is the other way round,

02:34:40.659 --> 02:34:46.209
somebody came to see me and I was delayed
also and it became dark very fast.

02:34:46.227 --> 02:34:52.779
So I don't know what to do now. You changed
according to the need and here it is.

02:34:52.785 --> 02:34:58.538
I hope you people do not mind the second shift.

02:35:01.417 --> 02:35:08.877
One thing about classical music
is, that it does settle you down

02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:17.233
and to me, it's nice to have
something classical first,

02:35:17.248 --> 02:35:19.748
not all, but a little bit at least.

02:35:19.748 --> 02:35:24.847
It helps, helps us to meditate
and to come to the proper mood,

02:35:24.847 --> 02:35:29.557
but today it was in this way and I
hope you all enjoyed it very much.

02:35:29.594 --> 02:35:32.094
So now the second shift is there.

02:35:32.094 --> 02:35:36.709
There's going to be an interval for
about 5-10 minutes and after that,

02:35:36.715 --> 02:35:45.083
we will start the second one and hero
is Alex, who is going to do the job.

05:24:31.296 --> 05:24:35.126
With all this jubilation,

05:24:35.123 --> 05:24:37.623
such joy in the atmosphere,

05:24:42.442 --> 05:24:47.398
from so many nations

05:24:47.421 --> 05:24:57.036
you see people dancing with joy, in the name of God.

05:24:57.037 --> 05:25:03.957
Shows the future all over, in the whole world,

05:25:03.960 --> 05:25:07.573
Sahaja Yoga is going to spread.

05:25:21.216 --> 05:25:30.873
As we are all together, here, in pure love, in pure joy

05:25:30.883 --> 05:25:36.477
is such a dream of mine coming true.

05:25:36.474 --> 05:25:43.399
And I am so overjoyed to see all these
nations who have joined together

05:25:46.084 --> 05:25:53.034
Today, I don't know how to say,

05:25:53.065 --> 05:26:07.076
their efforts have really created
blossoms and blossoms of beauty and joy.

05:26:09.074 --> 05:26:11.574
I bless you all with my heart

05:26:14.675 --> 05:26:23.912
Keep on! Keep on moving, having faith
in your Self, in your Self Realisation.

05:26:23.912 --> 05:26:26.232
That's how we are going to progress.

05:26:26.292 --> 05:26:32.432
Tomorrow is a great day. We are going
to celebrate Shri Ganesha's birth

05:26:32.441 --> 05:26:36.672
and I was thinking we'd better have it earlier because it's....

05:26:36.687 --> 05:26:40.524
I don't know why the evening has become so cold.

05:26:40.516 --> 05:26:47.016
I think it must be Shri Ganesha's cool
is flowing all over. I can't explain.

05:26:47.036 --> 05:26:51.172
But we could have it earlier, so that
you don't suffer from this cold

05:26:51.172 --> 05:26:59.688
during Puja time. It can be even worse, me sitting there emitting all the vibrations, I don't know what would happen.

05:26:59.704 --> 05:27:05.028
So I would request all of you
tomorrow enjoy the morning nicely

05:27:05.070 --> 05:27:12.665
and about 4 o'clock, about 1
o'clock we'll start the Puja.

05:27:12.685 --> 05:27:19.582
It's not a very long Puja, because only Shri Ganesha's Puja it is, so not going to run long.

05:27:21.642 --> 05:27:28.272
I think there's.. I don't know whom to thank because people have done so well; all of you.

05:27:28.282 --> 05:27:32.462
All of you, I never expected all that,

05:27:32.459 --> 05:27:35.395
so beautifully everything arranged, organised.

05:27:35.401 --> 05:27:41.435
We never felt, at least I never felt it was night

05:27:41.425 --> 05:27:44.026
and I'm sure you all enjoyed it.

05:27:44.036 --> 05:27:47.246
May God bless you. God bless
you. Thank you very much.

05:27:47.298 --> 05:27:49.798
All the best for Iran also, I am saying.
