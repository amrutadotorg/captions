00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.840
You want to ask a question which you like to ask.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.960
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.080
Sahaja yog [UNCLEAR]

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.920
- What is [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]
- What is.... Are you [UNCLEAR] Hare Krishna?

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.080
- because
- I'll talk about Krishna then we'll [UNCLEAR - SOLVE?] the question.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.420
- What's it? - You don't go out
- [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.280
- What's he saying?
- He wants to ask me a question, Mother because I was doing the program

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.500
- You should not be aggressive like that - alright?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.880
You can do it later on. What is being so aggressive because you have to call her?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.780
- [UNCLEAR]
- No, no why have you come here to call your things - you have come here to call

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.600
- [UNCLEAR]
- No, that thing is wrong [UNCLEAR - SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN?] - alright? Have some patience.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.720
You see, when you go to other gurus you don't ask any questions - nothing - you go headlong.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.020
You [UNCLEAR - STAND?] on your legs, do what they tell. There's no enquiry before them, not a question, nothing.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.920
Whatever they say, you obey them, pay them money - just obey them blindly.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.940
Whenever you come to Mother please don't try to get this - that's wrong.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.740
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR] that's true, I know.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:51.800
- Why do you want to call her? You have come to call [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.760
- What is he?
- He's probably a sahaja yogi.
- Annh?
- Sahaja yogi

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.160
- Haan
- Sahaja means [UNCLEAR]

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.680
- He teaches the people [UNCLEAR]
- I never heard there's a foreign

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.620
What are you doing [UNCLEAR]? Have you got your? He's [UNCLEAR] nothing wrong. He has his own ideas too.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.780
- [UNCLEAR]
- Alright, don't fight. You see, [UNCLEAR] have started spoiling everybody's mood

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.300
You take another hall and hire and give a lecture; That's a better idea

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.080
and [UNCLEAR] I'll be very happy if you can do that - alright? Alright, better do it.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.520
This is [UNCLEAR - HOW IT IS SOLVED?] by us. [LAUGHTER]

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.060
[UNCLEAR]

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.820
[ALL LAUGH]

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.160
[ALL LAUGH]

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.900
- He was [UNCLEAR - PUNK?]
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.720
- [UNCLEAR] You can [UNCLEAR]

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.260
Forget it, forget it. Let it be. Better sit down all of you. Now, I'll tell you.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.620
One had all types of experiences every next day.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:44.540
Sahaja yoga has an open door for everyone. All of you can come in.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.540
Some of you, actually, do not deserve even to come but you are allowed to come in.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.920
You do not want your Self-realization but you were here, I don't know for what.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.680
But it's alright - it's a Mother's house - you all could be here

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.440
but as a Mother, I have to tell you one thing - a very simple thing

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.120
that you must do all justice to yourself.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.640
In all [UNCLEAR - CLEARNESS?] to yourself, you better get your realization.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.920
If you do not get your realization, you'll have lots of problems but [UNCLEAR -SUFFER?] later on

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.360
which may come out as anything - physical, emotional, mental, spiritual

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.640
but last of all, they'll be sorted out, they'll be sent to Hell.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.140
So I have to request you, that be patient with yourself.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.120
As I love you, you have to love yourself.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.560
I see that beauty, that sparkling beautiful Spirit

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.840
which is clouded by your [UNCLEAR - MISJUDGMENT?] to fly.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.280
Enmity, problems but I see that

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.880
sparkling spark also.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.260
That's why, I'm extremely patient.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.500
You will know your beauty also if you are little patient with yourself

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.240
and try to understand how to be that [UNCLEAR - THAT'S ALL?]

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.580
that is your [UNCLEAR - JEWEL OR JOB?], you are lost - you have to find.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.420
That is very important for life; That is the evolutionary process of human-beings

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:09.440
and those who do not accept your Spirit - I do not want to say to frighten you but

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.920
only thing is, this is the Last Judgment - you won't have another chance,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.540
so please, try to get your realization established.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.700
If you keep, permit to My lecture, you'll have more knowledge about chakras and things like that.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:35.260
That is not going to help you neither help Me. I'm not here to show off any knowledge

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:43.480
or to sort of form any [UNCLEAR] or to start any cult or religion or anything like that.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:50.900
I'm here to give you what you have, just that is hidden from you,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.580
that you have not yet felt - that's what is your own right that is sahaja -

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.860
born with you, spontaneous, the living force of Kundalini which is the Holy Ghost

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.560
actually reflected within you, has to do it

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:17.680
and that's what is important, absolutely wise,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:24.640
absolutely logic but we are not yet so equipped

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.920
to understand our estimation. We have no self-estimation of any kind,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:39.380
we are not able to understand what we are. It's better to get your Self-realization

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:47.540
and to understand your own values. This is something so valuable

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.860
that no words can really prove it.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:07.320
Now today, we are yet to be with very interesting - [ASIDE - Is it alright, can you hear Me?] -

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:16.120
very interesting chakra, called as, heart chakra, which is called as Anahata chakra,

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.980
though it is not placed on the heart. It is placed

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:28.140
very much behind the sternum bone in the spinal cord. In your childhood

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:37.100
this center manifests. The power in the sternum bone

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.960
actually is antibodies. Now this center is governed

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.960
by the Goddess, who is called as, Jagdamba - meaning the Mother of the Universe,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:57.860
who gives us security in the life. She resides in this center

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:06.780
and manifests till the age of twelve years - Her warriors called as antibodies;

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.860
Doctors call it as antibodies. After twelve years these antibodies

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.660
go into circulation and empty the sternum bone

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:28.420
but whenever there is a problem of insecurity

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:36.360
the sternum bone starts going up and down and you start feeling genuinely ill.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:44.780
which is a very, very important, extremely important center within us.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.260
If you have less antibodies, then we can develop

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:59.640
lots of problems of insecurity even if we have imaginary

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:08.160
hallucinations or sometimes actual possessions, this center can go out

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.460
in a very funny way and you may develop diseases like Asthma [UNCLEAR]

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.700
but actually with this central one, the center -

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.180
there are three chakras you can see there, so the central one gives you the sense of insecurity

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.040
specially to women will cause cancer of the breast.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:39.360
Breast cancer is caused by insecurity among women. Mostly women

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.720
who are insecured do not say that they are insecured.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.700
Supposing the husband is a wayward person

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.920
and he is having relations with other women or she is suspicious about the relationship like that

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.420
then she may develop this trouble within her and

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:11.760
she may not tell the doctor, doctor would not know and breast cancer can be caused with [UNCLEAR]

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:17.180
First of all, the woman is the mother, mother of your child

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.940
and if her security as a mother is challenged, then she develops this

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:34.280
horrible disease called as breast cancer, which is very common these days among women.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.800
Men do not understand that women are very sensitive things.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:47.200
They are of course extremely evolved, they can bear much more than they can

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:53.920
seldom a woman gets a heart attack. They are quite [UNCLEAR]

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.320
but they can't bear the announcements to give them insecurities of this kind.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:08.260
Now you can understand a woman who is insecured like that. She may not say, she may not complain,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.220
she may not also show it

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:20.840
but the heart there is an insecurity developing which results in the creation of breast cancer.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.440
There are many breast diseases are developed by these and also

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.580
some of the lung diseases are also developed with this insecurity.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:37.160
In addition to that, those people who suffer from cold too much

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.920
and those who get exposed to pneumonia

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:51.560
or, you can say, even people who go to closed places like cinemas, those places

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:58.240
where there is not sufficient air for them to breathe, they develop

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:05.560
this trouble in this area very much and more on the

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:12.060
left side of this chakra which is called as the left Anahata.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.240
Now the left anahata is the Mother, is your mother.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.560
If there is a problem with your mother - supposing your mother has died very early in life -

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.300
you have had no motherhood in your childhood,

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.960
if there has been a problem with your mother, then this left side

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.640
chakra catches and it goes hand in hand with heart.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:44.180
So in this [UNCLEAR] if you get a catch, then you must nourish the left side

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.400
chakra which is catching, which can be heart or can be this left side chakra.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.040
So you can ask the question, "Will I know what is the problem with [UNCLEAR]?" If you ask the question, "Are you

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:05.300
suffering from any insecurity from your mother or about your mother,"

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.280
and if you find that there is some problem with the mother

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:18.860
[UNCLEAR]

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:25.120
See they are the losers, why should you worry? Now, if there is any destruction

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.840
of any such feelings of motherhood within you, then this chakra gets blocked

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:38.220
and you can develop diseases like tuberculosis or could be any such diseases

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:45.040
that has to do with your left hand and also it affects in a way the heart organ.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:54.420
On the right hand side is a very, very important chakra called as the chakra of the

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:02.260
Shri Ram. Now, Shri Rama was an Incarnation of this Vishnu, the One

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:09.060
who's on the Nabhi chakra, who came as the eighth Incarnation on this earth and -

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:16.060
I'm sorry not eighth, He was the seventh Incarnation and He - there're ten Incarnations

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:22.960
out of which he was the seventh - and he came on this earth and he didn't in any way profess or say

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:31.200
that he was the incarnation of Vishnu. He, that's why he moved from the central path to the right.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:39.020
He kept himself aware. Now this Shri Rama's center is very important

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:45.880
because Shri Rama was a perfect human-being 'Maryada Purshottam'.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:54.440
He deal with or we can say he created the boundaries with which a human-being should live

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.820
as a king, as a husband, as a father and that's why this is the center of the father.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:10.240
If you have failed as a father, if your son has [UNCLEAR - NOT GOOD VIEWS?]

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:19.120
for you or maybe, that your father has not been good to you

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:26.360
or if you have done some harm to your child, then this center catches.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:35.860
Now, there was a boy, who came to Me, quite young and always his center used to catch.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:42.700
I asked him how did his this center is catching, he said [UNCLEAR] because you have a good father

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:50.120
and everything is alright. Then he confessed to Me that, "Mother, I must confess to you

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:57.320
that I was having a relationship with the woman which he conceived and we

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.760
both decided to have an abortion," and that's why his this center was catching.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.600
Now the very age old asthamas could be with this.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:16.460
Very age old asthamas which people have we have, could be because their father might have died very early in age.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:25.420
Now such fathers who die very early, he get [UNCLEAR - CHILDREN ARE THEN INSECURE?], so they hover around the children.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.620
If you can tell your father that, "I'm alright,

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.720
don't worry about me, you take your birth," you'll be amazed your asthamas can be checked.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:43.060
We had a Governor of Kashmir, who was a friend of My husband, a very senior man, want to see Me;

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.280
In India people have a different style of behavior towards saints.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:56.400
We never behave [UNCLEAR] as you see here - never. Even the President of India would stand for a saint.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.260
And he was the governor and we were his guests.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.080
After all My husband was an officer much junior [UNCLEAR] but he walked in

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:13.720
to our guest house and he said, "Today I've come to see a saint and not Mrs. Srivastava,"

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:22.100
and he sat down. He said, "I've come to take Your blessings because I'm having asthma for twenty-five years."

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.340
I said, "Alright." Then I asked him about his father, "When did his father die?" He said, "About 25 years back.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:36.040
That time I was very young, not yet employed, my father was very much worried about me and he died."

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.920
I said, "Alright, will you tell your father that you take your birth again?"

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:49.220
[UNCLEAR]

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:56.020
and he said, "Alright," because he was suffering too much.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:04.000
Since that day he never got an attack from asthma - is a fact. It's quite simple to cure

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:11.940
anorexia - another disease that you have. [UNCLEAR] but when I tell you about this [UNCLEAR]

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.020
Anorexia is also caused by emotional disturbance.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.580
For example, a girl's father dies and she cannot [UNCLEAR]

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:30.680
and she feels for the father and the father also feels for her and this mutual feeling brings

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:38.460
the father, as a spirit, around her and then she cannot eat. You see, she feels extremely restless carrying on with that feeling.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:44.180
She just allows him, whatever she may try she cannot eat. In London, one doctor

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:52.240
once experimented on this and he said, "Alright, we'll do the last rites of your father." Just imagine, [UNCLEAR]

00:19:52.500 --> 00:20:00.260
He said, "Let's try," and she started weeping. In the same way, if you can tell your father that, "I'm alright."

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:07.300
When you tell him to do some work, they start crying because it is too much to say to your father

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:14.240
who was so close to you, suddenly dies. You may feel very emotional about it but one can try it out

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.660
and save it this sick center. Asthma, many times, can be cured by this

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:30.160
but there can be a combination of Asthma which I called, why I've never told you before - the granthi.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:35.860
When the two centers meet there are auras of every chakra

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:43.060
and when they meet a granthi is formed; Granthi means a knot. A knot is formed and when the knot is formed,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:50.680
when you take the name of a deity, you have to take the name in such a manner that you put those two deities together.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:57.780
Today I had a boy who had very bad bronchial asthma and they did not know what is the reason for it.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:04.240
When we just checked we found that Agnya, this chakra and the [UNCLEAR - LUNGS?] part,

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.660
when we put them together and gave it a bandhan, it got [UNCLEAR].

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:16.240
When we tried on both the chakras, it was better because if you treat one, the disease goes to another.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.740
I'm amazed that you brought your attention to another it transforms,

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:28.560
so it is better to attack both of them together - is the method which they keep, by which you can use after realization.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:36.440
All these tricks are to be learnt and these granthis can be completely opened out and you can really

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.900
cure the person of these, so called, physical problems which are really emotional.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:52.100
In a society where people do not understand how human-beings are sensitive, how they are delicate

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.560
how they are to be treated and that they are the most sacred things,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:05.940
people become extremely aggressive and their aggression can be very subtle, can be very untrue;

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.720
We have to be extremely beautiful but

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:19.260
can be very injurious and can be very, very, I would say, extremely

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:28.380
disturbing. So many aggressive characters of women and men have destroyed their children,

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:36.520
they have destroyed themselves. One has to understand that all such aggressions end up with the problems in the society.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.920
Insecurities lead to problems and problems.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:48.340
Like the wife has a insecurity to the husband. Now if husband has the insecurity of the woman

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:55.880
then what happens, they go into this funny relationships with men.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:02.940
When they find a woman also untrusted, so

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:10.740
dominating, then they try to have these funny relations just as you see.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.500
If they meet women who are kind to them

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:25.000
and do not try to dominate too much, they sometimes [UNCLEAR] in the name of security also, very much,

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:33.700
so the man can develop in his own way as a man and a woman can develop in his own way,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:41.240
in her own way as a woman but when they try to be [UNCLEAR] then the insecurities develop

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.760
and that's how we have so many complications which are psychological in nature.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:55.000
This was discussed by Freud, to begin with but as I said it was very half-baked.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.360
He could not see through that there is not only the psyche that we have

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:07.420
we have also the another side which is called as ego within us. So he said you better de-condition

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:14.840
yourself. There's no end to it and once you start de-conditioning yourself - many gurus are doing like this -

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.800
they say, "You must de-condition yourself." By de-conditioning yourself

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:24.880
you do not know that you really develop your ego which is no way to help you to

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.260
[UNCLEAR] or to [UNCLEAR] This ego will last

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.740
doesn't help us because it may give you success, it can give you lots of things -

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:41.620
it troubles others. Like Hitler never thought how he would torture the other men.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:49.260
And if you get a superego, then you get pain, you don't [UNCLEAR - LIKE?] say you want to [UNCLEAR - GIVE IT UP?]

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:54.700
but if you want a ego, you just enjoy [UNCLEAR]; Now what is that nicely?

00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:03.040
This 'I' with a [UNCLEAR]. Now when the realization takes place,

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.420
when the Kundalini rises, it rises in the center and the

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:18.460
power of Kundalini spreads on the sides. In the center is the power of the autonomous

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.800
and once you know that the Mother of the Universe is your mother also -

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:32.420
it's not the knowledge rationally but it happens within you - so you feel that security within you.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.660
All your promotional things [UNCLEAR] and you become

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:43.500
really stand as [UNCLEAR - SPEAKING TO?] yourself and you start feeling yourself

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:50.600
and staying with yourself.You feel your own worth and your own importance

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.560
as a human-being, as a sahaja yogi, as a realized soul.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:03.580
Then you check your own [UNCLEAR], you are not now fearless but fear of the unknown goes away.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.220
You become absolutely in the center - neither you aggress nor you take aggression.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.600
It's a very beautiful relationship that exists.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:22.120
By chance if somebody tries to aggress you, you can see the drama. If somebody tries to be extremely

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:29.580
humble with you, you see the drama. The whole thing comes to you as a drama, you're never disturbed with all these things

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:36.220
and you must know that these ups and downs are always there to create a variety.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.840
This center is the most important center from one point of view.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:50.540
That all our emotional problems come from this center and the way we treat the chakras,

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.420
the way you can handle each other

00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:00.380
- we are not at all aware that human-beings are even delicate,

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:06.500
that the delicateness flower like this

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.700
is extremely there.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:16.820
Whatever you try to do to a human-being, know he has a very deep root.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:25.680
These roots as a result of bearing up become big to horrible

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:35.000
weapons within us and when you come across somebody whom you can dominate and trouble, you start

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.380
hurting that person. You use hurting language hurting others.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:47.120
You cannot enjoy another person but when realization takes place,

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:54.520
you become so fruitful that you enjoy the security of another person.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:01.040
After realization, a person who is realized, never possesses because

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:09.240
a person who is realized has felt the freedom and has divided the freedom so he never tries to dominate another person.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.640
This is a very, very great disadvantage in sahaja yog

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:22.160
that people who are [UNCLEAR] are very nasty, they can be horrible, they are very troublesome

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:28.340
and sometimes they really ruin themselves but because those who are realized souls

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:36.580
cannot dominate them, they just watch and see who are dominating. If they could do it, immediately such a person will feel that

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.280
hundreds of slaps coming up from waves but

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:47.920
we face those who are real today, also so many of them, and watching you and are sitting down here. I also

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.580
see what's happening but they watch and see what others are doing, what harm they are doing

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.540
and how they are pulling, they just note it down. Of course, this is not so true,

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:09.780
that those which are bringing hurdles and inconvenience in the work of God

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:17.100
ultimately are taken away from the Grace of God. God is very forgiving, no doubt, He forgives

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:22.880
first mistake [UNCLEAR] but after some time He also punishes you.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:31.080
He punishes you so badly that you are amazed how He has [UNCLEAR] you.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.660
This center, to keep it clean and nice,

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:46.920
one thing you must know, that there is nothing to fear. God Almighty who has created you,

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.260
He's so powerful that there is nothing to fear.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:00.880
23rd Psalm which we read [UNCLEAR] what He says.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.820
I would say, that is the mantra for this center.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.620
There is nothing to fear in this world but actually what happens,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.280
that if we are egoistical, we are frightened because we know we are egoistical

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:25.300
and somebody is going to hurt us. It is most [UNCLEAR] that kind of a fear comes in

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.400
that we have done some harm so we are frightened that this is going to happen.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:37.120
Moreover, when you indulge into things like

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:44.060
[UNCLEAR]  or strong [UNCLEAR] as you call them [UNCLEAR] and drugs and things

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:49.460
they take you to superego. The superego takes you to Collective Subconscious

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:57.760
and you get attacked by the Collective Subconscious on and when you are attacked then

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:04.740
you get a very different personality which is [UNCLEAR], who doesn't want to say anything, which keeps quiet,

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:11.340
which runs away, [UNCLEAR] shouts and such people are very depressive.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.300
They become absolutely depressing, extremely depressed

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:23.340
and sometimes they lose their jobs, they cannot work, they cannot pay attention.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:28.080
These people have to then go to the right side

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:34.600
to give a balance [UNCLEAR] - it's to raise the right side of his being.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.680
To give them a balance we have to raise the right side, not the left side.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.100
And once you raise the right side, you must know you are raising Shri Ram.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:52.020
I do not know if you have read the life of Shri Ram, who was the [UNCLEAR] king

00:31:52.460 --> 00:32:00.400
and he sacrificed his own wife just to keep the public opinion alright.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:06.720
That was the greatest [UNCLEAR] thing but you have seen people

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.560
that for their own children they sacrifice the whole country.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.360
There are people who sacrificed their whole country for their wives

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:24.260
while he's the man who sacrificed his wife for the whole country and the whole story is so good to know

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:33.200
that the wife had to go and deliver the children in a ashram of a

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:39.260
very big saint known as Valmiki. Now these two children were born

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.840
and when Rama came to call her she went to and disappeared into the Mother Earth.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.200
After that it is said, these two children who were Luv and Kush

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.800
they went [UNCLEAR] two ends of a [UNCLEAR] because they were kids

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:07.560
They decided not to stay in India that can the Himalayas [UNCLEAR]

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:16.060
and they decided to disappear in the North. So Luv went towards the [UNCLEAR] side and Kush went

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:23.260
to the left side. The left side was China that's why the Russians are called as 'Slav' -

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:28.460
Luv becomes 'Slav' and Chinese are called as [UNCLEAR]

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:35.820
Better go and tell them that the descendants of two twin brothers who were children

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:41.240
of Sitaji and why should they fight among themselves. Chinese

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:46.580
and Russian people, they're Slavs and [UNCLEAR]

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:57.260
Rama's kingdom was the kingdom of great harmony

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.800
and great [UNCLEAR]. A king has to be a benevolent king.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:10.400
He has not to use his power to destroy or to make people insecure.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:19.820
If you make even one person insecured, it is sin and a king can make

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:26.040
thousands of people insecured by his terrorism or his absurd ideas about [UNCLEAR]

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:34.100
Rama's life was a message, was so ideal. Whatever problem he had, he used to call

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:40.840
his ministers and would talk to them, ask them what are the problems

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:46.620
and then he would tell them, "Alright, if you think these are the problems then,"

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:54.260
he would say that, "It is better to go to some saint and ask for their advice."

00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.920
And all his ministers had to go to some saint and ask their advice [UNCLEAR].

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:07.820
Saints have the same opinion, all of them, on any country because they are [UNCLEAR] vibrated awareness.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.140
In vibratory awareness there's only Absolute Truth and that's how

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:21.040
he saw to it that through these saints he could manage them to lead a life of complete harmony

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.600
and understanding. His own life He spent like a message

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:37.800
He would walk without shoes and he sacrificed everything that is meant for [UNCLEAR]

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:45.340
And in the end he wanted to have a real faith for [UNCLEAR]

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:52.900
of Ashwamedha yagya [UNCLEAR] is a [UNCLEAR] in which you put a horse

00:35:53.600 --> 00:36:00.440
and you follow the horse and wherever the horse goes, you fight the folks which are trying to capture it..

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:08.120
And those horses, whichever country they went, they were not captured,

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:16.600
were regarded as the part of the Kingdom of Shri Rama. So this horse went

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:24.200
to many countries and there at that time they had to do a great [UNCLEAR] worship

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:31.360
of the fire. While he had no wife alongside the day and he said,

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.420
"I will not have this, if I have to have my wife, I cannot have."

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:44.460
So the people said that, "If you can make a statue of your wife, we can have this

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:52.560
whole thing done and the puja can be performed." So he made a golden image of Sitaji

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.520
and tried the worshipping done.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:05.420
It is hard to get a husband of Rama's style; He's an ideal husband.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:12.680
Such a loving husband, He even in  separation, He never thought of any other woman

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:19.740
just of his wife. He enjoyed the separation of his wife and lead a

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:25.160
life of a sage. His wife too, so dedicated to him,

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:32.820
was so upset, She thinks that He's going to have this yagya, that He may get married again - She was jealous

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:40.220
but then she discovered that He made a beautiful image of Her.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:47.680
Sometimes, when they are women, they are jealous but jealousy is not such a bad thing.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:55.780
Jealousy is the controlling factor by which men or women can control the licentiouness

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.320
of each other. Jealousy is God's gift but it should not go too far.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:08.400
It should be open jealousy and it should be enjoyed. It is in lots of poems of Krishna

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:13.480
and Rama - you will hear the jealousy of their wives

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:19.020
and how once Radha was so jealous of the flute

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.260
that Krishna used to use, that She asked Him,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:31.400
"What do You mean by holding this flute all the time to Your lips? What is so special about her?"

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:37.440
So Krishna said, "Alright, if You are so jealous, go and ask Her. [UNCLEAR - ONLY?] ask the flute."

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:45.300
So she went to the flute and She said, "What is so special about this, how you are all the time

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:51.340
uh.. at the lips of My beloved?" She said, "See [UNCLEAR] this."

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.760
Something very simple and she smiled. She said, "What is your speciality, you have to tell?"

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:02.320
She said, "My speciality is that I have no speciality. I've become a hollow person.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:09.100
He flows through me and melody is created and people say that

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:16.560
'Is the flute that is playing.' It's Krishna who's playing, I just see the flow of that.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:23.080
That flow of that energy that you people use it, I see that and I smile at people

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:28.100
who say that [UNCLEAR]. I've become [UNCLEAR], I've become a hollow personality."

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.160
This is what one of the beautiful stories of jealousy is.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:38.580
So, I would not say that jealousy of the worst type, where you may [UNCLEAR] husband is

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:44.460
but a sweet jealousy is a very nice thing and a sweet teasing is also very nice thing.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:52.000
Actually in relationship, we have to develop very sweet uh.. connections with each other.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:40:00.440
Like a, today I was talking to somebody who's brother-in-law is very hot-tempered or something like that and all that.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:07.060
I said, "Very good idea. So you are the one who can take it down his temper because you are his brother -in-law."

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:13.300
Said, "How?" I said, "You should teach them sometimes and take his side and do all these tricks and you'll see how he'll manage."

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.420
That's a very good relationship but this training you do not have in the Western life

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:25.300
While we have quite a lot because we live in a joint family, so we know what is our relationship and how to do

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:33.000
and how to enjoy each other and how to make fun of these small, small things so we are always laughing and enjoying ourselves,

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:39.620
our relationships instead of just finding faults, "She came very late, she banged the door so loudly,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:45.460
she should have known to sleep on here, why didn't she do that," - all these [UNCLEAR]

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:53.060
This is how we all can live together if you see to the sweet things but if you go too much [UNCLEAR] meticulous things

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:58.800
and to all these nonsensical problems that you have, it is going to be a headache

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.840
What you need, these small, small things sponsor relationships.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:11.120
Now the Mother of the Universe is the one that

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:19.620
is [UNCLEAR - NAMED?] with one thousand names; She has one thousand names

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:27.560
and She has got two centers on to which She acts - on the right side is called as the Shri Chakra

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:34.960
on the left side is called as the Lalita Chakra and the book that has one thousand names is called as Lalita Sahastranama.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:41.520
All these thousand names, can imagine, how many powers She has - She has thousand hands

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:47.320
and with these thousand hands She looks after. So what is there to be afraid of?

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.600
When there is Yogmaya, who is so powerful and She has thousand powers

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:59.280
what is there to be afraid of and when She loves you so much? On one side She has the

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:06.220
light on the side of a child. Who can tell you walk so quietly,

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:13.960
so nicely without getting disturbed at all. I can see, that it is She who is going to be [UNCLEAR - WORKING?]

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:20.480
who act. Only thing, they must feel Her presence in your chakra and establish Her there.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:25.840
This is what is the central chakra is very important within us.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.260
[ASIDE - Should I (UNCLEAR)? Should we?]

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.020
While I'm not saying, there is one chakra more.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:47.000
First of all, before doing Vishuddhi, I've to tell you the imbalances of this chakra, first of all

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:53.540
and then you'll understand what is to be done. The imbalances that come

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:59.420
in this chakras, first of all, is when you are extremely emotional.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:08.280
Very emotional people there are. At the slightest they'll cry, they're very easily [UNCLEAR] out but whatever you may say, first thing you do is

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:15.180
to use your water power and upset everyone; You see, the children are upset, the husband is upset with your water power

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:22.980
and the once it starts, it doesn't stop. Emotional people, when they go too much with their emotional behaviour

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:28.500
they do not get epileptic so much as they get, what you call hysteric

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.840
and this hysteria spreads from one to another because people see

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.800
that those who are distressed are affected with their hysteria. Once they become hysteric, other people start thinking, "Oh, God,

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:48.600
just look at her!" She's hysteric so everybody going to her, is kind to her and that is how she also picks up

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:56.180
from another hysteric woman and starts being hysteric but actually, it is a possession that comes to you and you become hysteric.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.460
Now, this hysteria is to treated in a very simple way.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.600
First of all, she is to be told that, "We don't believe in hysteria, [UNCLEAR],

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:14.780
we are not bothered. You have your hysteria well it is not good for us." It is to be neglected. If you neglect such a person

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.300
will be much better or if she shouts or screams anything, you lock her up in the house

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:27.180
you go out and come back. You'll find, after some time she'll not have hysterias.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:33.880
But if it really due to some possession, then you have to give her a regular treatment of sahaja yoga

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:40.200
by which she can remove the possession. So that there are two types of hysterics

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.180
one is the real - when a person is really caught up and is

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:52.460
possessed and is feeling oppressed and the another kind is the one which is just a show

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:59.000
because people are there, who are insincere type and they try to show off.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:04.340
You see, like many you'll find. Now the gentleman here was just nothing but a show off.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.880
There was no need for him to be so upset, nobody said anything to him in particular, nothing was wrong,

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:15.040
he's not here to fight with Me - nothing - but he's just a show off. And this

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:22.620
kind of a quality comes in when you are a show off, so it's best is, to show to such a person that you do not care for the show off.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:29.020
Once you do that, you'll be amazed that it works out wonders and people

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:35.940
who are suffering from all these troubles get cured but there are people who are

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:43.360
really sick and hard to find some - a very simple method. That a person

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:51.180
who is suffering from this kind of a show off thing, if you put anything obnoxious near the nose of such a person

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.300
he just forgets, he can't bear it, you see. He forgets about his

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:02.820
uh.. tantrums. All these tantrums are just forgotten. So in India, is a very funny thing they do

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:07.360
is to rub your shoe and put it to the nose of the person

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:15.520
and can put anything else. Also sometimes they put a little onion which is not [UNCLEAR] to the nose of the person

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:20.660
and then the person just becomes quite normal. But if it is a real,

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:28.360
real hysteric, you see, then of course, you have to get it treated by sahaja yoga.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:35.300
I've known one lady was going to some guru who really raped her

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:42.980
and she didn't know she was raped but sort of in unconscious state and she was thinking that she was raped and all that

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:50.200
and she became pregnant and then she had to get her abortion and all that - horrible fellow he was!

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:57.860
He's still going very strong making lots of money and this woman since then became hysteric sort

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:05.320
and she used to get into terrible hysteria so much so that when her husband had to take her to Scotland then [UNCLEAR]

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.220
boarding house where he was looking after, she used to scream like mad

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:18.460
and she used to go into a tantrum where her neck would go on one side and her hands would go like that; It was terrible.

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:26.320
Worse that her epileptic mood would go on for 3-4 hours. Thank God she came to sahaja yoga and she got cured.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:33.880
- What are you doing?
- I'm drawing [UNCLEAR]

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:39.180
- Why don't you give an extraordinary affair? I'm here to make you extraordinary.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:44.740
[UNCLEAR]

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:52.920
Oh, it's alright but I think you better be extraordinary so I also can be

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:58.280
when I... alright? Alright, finish it soon and you better have it.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.580
Now, this one is

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:13.000
one of the hysterias, as I told you, on the left hand side and a right hand side, when a person is, say, in the power, he becomes the king

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.100
and he starts shouting out - he's not [UNCLEAR], he's a father.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.080
He has to behave like a father and a father has to sacrifice.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:30.580
He has to go on sacrificing for his children. He has to give love to his children.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:35.420
Now, a father will never have a [UNCLEAR - SALARY?] for car

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.420
and a beautiful house and the children starving.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:47.260
A, any king or any woman who does that, is not a father.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:56.560
If he is the father, then he is the benevolent king and such a king, we should all pray that we should have, within ourselves.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:05.860
Is important that we should have such a king who sacrifices everything for the sake of

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:12.800
his subjects and what a character!

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:20.920
A king, who has a licentious life, who kills seven wives and does all such nonsensical things

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.120
how can you, because unless and until you have a

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:35.060
have a character of your own, you have your own principles, unless and until you are an ideal king,

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:41.660
how can you rule people and what can you give them except for licentiousness and permissiveness.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:49.220
I was surprised that, now in England all of them are trying to follow this king who kills seven wives.

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:56.260
You see, either the wives are killing the husbands and the husbands are killing the wives and once I asked, "Why do you do like this?"

00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:02.480
"Our kings did it and now we are democratic, so we can also do it." - they have all become kings now.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:11.940
If you have to become a king, you have to be a king like Rama who loves his wife,

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:19.140
cared for [UNCLEAR], above all, His care for His people, His subjects;

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:26.340
Nothing was more important than the people whom He governed - that is what it is.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:33.820
But when this happens, you'll find the wives had escorted in most of the [UNCLEAR], like his son

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:40.260
they always gets caught up because they think, "Oh, we're great!" You see, their nose is up like that,

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:46.700
they go in a big car, they have no time to look at any one - they're supposed to be public servants

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:52.400
but they behave as if they are the owners of public properties and public.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:51:00.100
Specially in developing countries like India, they indulge into horrible things like bribery, corruption and all those things

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:06.380
and are least bothered about every corruption leads to [UNCLEAR] damage

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:12.820
because they do not believe, that God Almighty the Great, is our Father

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:18.060
and when our Father is there, so great, He's going to look after us.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:26.040
Why should we do all these injurious things to ourselves. One [UNCLEAR - MALADY?] can kill thousands of people.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:33.600
If a person takes a bribe while building a bridge, the bridge is weak

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:41.160
and when the car is passing over it, one, ten, hundred, thousand people can be killed.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:48.900
For taking a little money how much we do harm to others.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:56.500
Now, one side is the sin against the father - that not to believe

00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:01.560
that he looks after our yoga and  kshema, both, He's the one

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:08.420
who looks after all our material well-being. For that we should love [UNCLEAR] at least

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.760
that is all the developing countries [UNCLEAR - ITSELF?].

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:19.860
The countries who are developed, who have money, who do not have insecurities from money -

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:25.340
what they are doing? They are having the another side - is the sin against the mother.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:32.180
They are intruding the security of the family while making the wives

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:40.320
suffer of the insecurity or making the husband suffer of the insecurity,

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:47.360
making the children suffer of the insecurity; The whole places security is insecure.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:55.680
The women also have seen, when they're divorced, they start doing very dirty things, filthy.

00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.740
They become prostitutes - actually they are prostitutes. Yes, what is the difference

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:08.780
between the good woman and a prostitute is this much today, that one does it with willingness and the other says that she doesn't do with willingness.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:19.260
Whatever you may call it, it's a very wrong thing and for a woman, it's killing; It's absolutely killing

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:26.640
because woman's chastity keeps the whole earth moving. Her chastity is the most important thing.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:35.420
If a woman doesn't have a chastity, then I don't know what's going to happen to that earthly, that earth - it's horrible.

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:42.680
All kinds of [UNCLEAR] takes place, the Mother Earth is accidently rolling

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:47.500
with agony. She can't bear her daughters being slaughtered like this

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.140
for the sake of emotional blackmail or some sort of a thing like this.

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:59.260
Women must understand they owe a responsibility to the whole society.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:04.720
If men are responsible for economics and politics, women are responsible for social life.

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.840
They have to get, they have to stand

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:14.620
on their own feet and know that they are women and their chastity is the most precious thing.

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:23.140
Now, in a country like India, where [UNCLEAR] in poverty, but women's chastity is the fulfilment

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.940
extremely [UNCLEAR], I mean, you can't think of what you have even.

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:39.460
In the olden days, we had a Muslim queen. Her name was Noor Jahan. She was first an ordinary woman

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:44.200
and she went to the king's palace and met

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:51.540
Jahangir, who was a prince and she was a very beautiful and innocent girl and he fell in love with her and he wanted to marry her

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:57.560
but the king didn't like. He said, "No, she must be from a royal family."

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:04.320
He married her to one Shera Afghan of Bengal and sent her. This lady

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:11.000
became a devoted wife to her husband and lived very happily.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:19.420
But when Akbar died, this, this Salim her, I should say, her lover

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:26.000
became the king called as Jahangir and by mistake her

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:32.140
husband was killed by the armies of Jahangir and this upset her very much.

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.920
Then she was brought to Delhi and she went and told Jahangir

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.360
that she cannot have him."You have killed my husband, I'll never see your face, you cannot touch me."

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.020
He was the Emperor of India.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:53.580
This woman said, "You dare not touch me, I've nothing to..."  - see the character of the woman.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:01.100
And then he became very sick. He was also a very good husband and a lover, I should say.

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.580
Became very sick, he couldn't live without her and the mother was

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:11.260
a lady called as Jodhabai - she was a Hindu lady whom Akbar had married, so

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:19.980
Jodhabai, mother was very sorry for the son and when the doctor said that,

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.760
"This girl has to be brought today otherwise this fellow is going to die perhaps,"

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:34.400
so he said, "You must arrange somehow." So this queen, the mother queen, went as an ordinary maid-servant

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:40.060
to this girl and worked with her as a maid-servant.

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:49.180
So this girl was sick and she said, "What do you want?" She said, "Will you give me if I ask for it?" She said, "Yes, if I can give you, I will give you."

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:54.460
So he asked, she, this old lady asked her, "Will you marry my son?"

00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:01.480
She was willing to marry the son of a maid-servant but was not willing to marry this Emperor,

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.180
whom she had loved for some more time with the idea that she had killed the husband

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:12.820
and when, when she discovered that the son was nobody else but Jahangir

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:20.760
and she was married to him and she became a very brave queen, Noor Jahan; Noor Jahan means the light of the world.

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:28.640
Like that, we have had many, many stories in India because the character of a woman [UNCLEAR - SHINES?]

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:35.500
and such a power of [UNCLEAR] that even Krishna and Rama

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:40.460
and the greatest of greatest people were afraid of such women who had [UNCLEAR].

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:47.100
If you have to have real powers, then you should be really dedicated and very pure chaste women.

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:55.580
You'll be amazed, every word you say will become and you'll be such a powerful woman that nobody

00:57:55.860 --> 00:58:02.560
can even touch you. It's a tremendous power of which I'll give you one another example

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:06.500
how the women of India behave towards  their chastity.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:14.740
Uh.. we had a lady called Padmini, very beautiful queen and once uh..

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:20.700
a king, a emperor or something, he heard - not yet an emperor but he was trying to make [UNCLEAR - HIM ONE?] -

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:26.500
he heard about the beauty and he said that, "Oh, I must see this lady

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.880
otherwise if she does not agree, I will attack."

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:36.280
So all the people said, "No, we'll not allow our queen to be demonstrated like that."

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:43.220
So she said, "Alright, I don't want my country to be attacked, so it's alright, he can see me in a mirror, doesn't matter."

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:51.160
So she stood in a mirror and he saw her and then he again became very mad after her. He said, "No, I must have her as my wife."

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:58.020
And he came with all his army and surrounded their fort

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:03.720
and sent word that, "You must send the queen." But this was too much for Indian men

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:10.320
to send their queen to be killed. Imagine the seven queens killed in England, imagine!

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:17.140
What a story it is! Now they would not accept that so, they said, "Alright, we are sending the queen,"

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:24.960
and they got this palanquins and four people with the palanquin and inside there was one another

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:32.500
soldier sitting in with all the swords and all the guns and all that. Like that, they sent hundred palanquins saying that, "These are the maids

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:37.340
of the queen, that are going," and the king was in the first palanquin,

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:44.360
and they said, "We are going to fight these people. In case we die then we will know because that there will be no fire with us.

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.760
If there is a fire then we want that we should  know that we have died."

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:57.760
And then these people went to fight and each one of them was killed -

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:06.940
there was no fire. These women made a fire and climbed over it

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:14.360
and all of them burnt themselves. They would not allow their chastities to be touched by men.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:21.720
We may say, you so wish you were like that but today we have got that - they are so gracious

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:29.640
to have died for their chastity; It's such a great martyrdom for us to see how these women have killed themselves.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:36.780
There are many stories like this - even the wife of Ravana, who was killed by Rama, was like that

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:43.620
which I'll be telling you later on sometimes. That story is also very interesting but that is what it is

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.720
but we have lost all that, somehow we have lost it.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:55.620
I don't know how we have lost it but we have lost it - it's a very sad thing. Very sad

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:02.600
that we have lost such a precious thing that we have. With realization, you get it back.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:08.040
You get back your sense of decency, your sense of chastity.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:13.620
Like, if I'm on the street, people are kissing each other, hugging each other. I mean, these are

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:20.980
things to be done in the bedroom, not there, you see, it's so ugly to do it like this, embarrassing everyone.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:27.240
They'll be going on the escalator - that's the only time they can kiss  otherwise there's no other time; They must stick on to each other all the time.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:32.740
And if you ask them where are they going - they are going for a divorce case.[LAUGHTER]

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:42.100
And it's very indecent to be so much showing off your relationship with your husband - there's no need.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.540
You see, there's no need, all the time, to touch him and what's the need?

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.680
It looks so indecent; I don't understand that there is any need if there is love. There's more love

01:01:53.960 --> 01:02:00.280
then you never do that, actually. Uh.. you'll be amazed that Indian women when they see their husband,

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:07.060
they may not even raise their eyes and you make out why because she doesn't even raise her eye but she knows in her heart and heart

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:15.100
that her lover, her husband is so near. There's no need to say that; It's so beautiful, it is so much

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:22.280
loving that husband just looks at the girl and he knows that's my bride is there

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:28.040
and he just shakes his head and she also. It's so beautiful while this vulgar expression

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:34.960
and this time you have to think, it's ridiculous sometimes the way people go on. We are making ourselves very cheap.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:42.640
In our own estimation we should stand into great [UNCLEAR] of our shape and our understanding

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:50.720
that we are human-beings - even animals, some of them, are ashamed of these things and how can we go about with this kind of things.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:58.440
Very wrong ideas have come into us, like women must show their body - why? What is the need for women to show their body?

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:04.980
It's a very compulsion out of women, they must show their body - it's absurd, I mean, to us it's a priority

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:10.800
that the men, doesn't matter because they have nothing to hide so, why should

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:17.860
they every time they meet a man they need to button up his clothes and a woman will open her body. What is this?

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:25.960
I can't understand that a woman, in her modesty and her chastity, should know the value of her private

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:34.660
life and her privacy. She must respect. The way she behaved, the way, she's become shameless, absolutely shameless

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.400
and then [UNCLEAR] there was a big

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:44.880
movement that you shouldn't even wear under, undershirts for women or something like that

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:48.140
and they developed all these troubles of the breast cancer.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:55.320
They developed with that; Men should also wear undershirts not talk of the women but

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:01.260
men should wear just for the absorption of, what you can say the prespiration of but women

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:08.980
for their chastity also because they expose themselves and that's the chakra of shyness, is the chakra of modesty,

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:17.580
is the chakra of your chastity and you expose it? - that's not the way it should be. Only your child should be able to see that, nobody else is allowed.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:24.100
That's [UNCLEAR] you will be childless. You will see half of your spirit will go

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.700
if you dress up properly in a proper way, in modesty. Nobody [UNCLEAR - DOES THAT?]

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:36.480
The way you walk, the way you behave on the streets, I mean, there has to be a [UNCLEAR] - what else? You created this,

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:41.480
I tell you, the women created this, it's not that the man but the way women are dressed,

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.440
the way ugly they are - man feels excited, what can he do?

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:55.060
They have to behave themselves, they have to do in  such a way that they do not distract men so much.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.860
All the time trying to attract men is a [UNCLEAR] thing.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:05.420
Like one American woman was said that, "Indian women are...." I said that, "Alright, to one husband only.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:12.600
We are not bothered about other husbands. We are not all the time worried about figures, this, that to attract all the men of the world.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:19.920
Only one husband is Shri Ram is very...... distract our minds and they respect

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:27.000
[UNCLEAR] maybe husband as someone. Maybe a man [UNCLEAR] it's [UNCLEAR]

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:34.900
to play with the emotions of another man who is .... Whatever is ours we enjoy.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.940
..... enjoy somebody else's thing - why you do that?

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:45.100
By doing that, you create such a lot of insecurity in such a lot of people

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:52.300
and this is what they have to understand. Do not lay your hands on the other families, keep them off.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.620
It's worse than stealing all their families, everything together.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.200
Allow people to [UNCLEAR] and make marriages successful.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:07.300
I've seen people flirting about with [UNCLEAR] - shameful!

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:14.200
I've seen that and I feel so much shocked. What must be the curses of God for such people

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:19.540
who have no sympathy, no desire, no understanding

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.900
as to what the husband would be feeling of a whore?

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.680
All of us must know, this hurts us the most.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.440
This center hurts anyone the most.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:42.440
Nothing can be more hurting than this [UNCLEAR]. If you take our something, doesn't matter

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.000
but you deceive someone and in love everything is fair according to the modern science.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:55.500
You hurt anyone, you do anything, you'll be amazed - now I had a disciple who was 26 years of age

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:01.180
and he had a friend who was 24, mother was about 45, 46 maybe;

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:07.820
The friend went with this boy to his house and the lady went away with this 24 year old

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.100
What a problem it is! Nonsense!

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:20.940
And then the son came to Me and told Me, "Mother, this is what has happened, what should I do?" I said, " Go and [UNCLEAR]."

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:28.900
She was so shameless. She started telling Me, "How nice that boy is, he's so interesting, this, that."

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:32.280
I said, "Have you forgotten you have two daughters also."

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:38.680
She said, "No, not I've not forgotten that. I will [UNCLEAR - MEET THEM?]." I said, "Nobody should meet you."

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:48.680
Then she brought out all the case, everything, the house was sold - poor daughters are, they have no place to go to, they are in our ashram.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:56.820
The father has become mad sort of person and she doesn't mind she's [UNCLEAR] all of them and [UNCLEAR - STIGMA?]

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:01.280
and the boy feels so heated up, he's so angry

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:05.840
and this foolish woman thinks that she's such a bride!

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.420
How many people [UNCLEAR]. They destroy this life, destroy that life. What are we doing?

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:23.760
We're destroying ourselves. You can rationalize it, you can say it is alright

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:32.320
but it is murder, it is murder. Murder of not one one person but of many.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000
With this, I think, today I'll finish. Tomorrow I'll [UNCLEAR - BE OR DEAL?] with Krishna because the mood is different today.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:49.280
For Krishna you have to have very playful mood which we'll use. Tomorrow we'll have a nice time with Shri Krishna and Christ.

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:56.720
You'll be a master when I'll speak to you day after tomorrow and, I'm sure, you'll be able to do much better.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:05.040
I'm sorry, I had to say these things to you because in India people are [UNCLEAR] stealing, bribing, this, that nonsense

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:13.620
once they grow. We have got money now, now at least enjoy each other, do not destroy each other.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:19.360
You see, any husband you have got, just try not to [UNCLEAR] in this lifetime,

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.240
any woman you have got, try [UNCLEAR] in this lifetime - please.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:28.520
At least that type of a person won't be there next life - properly.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.340
So stop it. Why are you like? If you have married, it's alright,

01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:41.660
work it out, be comfortable with each other, be generous, be sweet,

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:50.740
look after each other. Do not destroy your lives. Your people suffer from such horrible

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:58.300
hallucinations and things, if you treat them like this. In America I met a child of eight years; Eight years child

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:06.760
and his mother told Me, "Mother, he has taken to drugs." I said, What! eight year old child has taken to drugs?"

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:14.480
She said, "Yes, he takes drugs," and that child I just took that child and hugged him

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.380
and loved him and kissed him. I said, "What have you been doing to yourself?"

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.960
He said, "All the time my father, mother - they are quarrelling, this is uh..

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:30.800
another father has come, he doesn't like me - he has more children, this, that. I don't like that father [UNCLEAR]

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:37.840
Then I kissed him and kissed him and kissed him. Then he [UNCLEAR] very happy and he started feeling My softness [UNCLEAR] -

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:45.300
then he started crying. He said, "Do You know Mother, my mother has never hugged me like this,

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:51.840
has never kissed me. She had no time because all the time she was trying to be with my father

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.300
and my father was trying to be with her. She had no love to kiss me like that."

01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:03.160
I asked her and she told Me, "Oh God, I will never forgive me if I touch a eight year old boy like this."

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:10.440
This is Mr. Paul [LAUGHTER]

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:16.280
I mean, even one a person, who is 65 year old in India

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:23.900
he doesn't mind getting into mother's bedroom, behaving like a little child, just taking her blessings

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:30.960
[UNCLEAR - I MEAN?] it's nothing regarded as, never even comes to our [UNCLEAR]

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:37.460
You see, My daughters are very big, about 35 years. She sees, when My husband is there, both of them will sleep

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:44.340
and say, "Daddy, now we are not liking to go out of this." Nobody feels anything. Even My son-in-law will be there - everybody.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:51.100
I mean, it's so clear, it's so [UNCLEAR]. Seems our brains have been ruling our hearts

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:58.580
Clear your hearts, clean your hearts. Don't listen to these horrible psychologists;

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:06.100
See, they are pathological cases. We are [UNCLEAR], don't listen to them, don't develop guilts for nothing at all.

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.220
Why are you so much obedient to them, I don't know.

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:20.860
Your Christ will be alive, you are the God man and one of the thing is love and wisdom.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.860
Isn't it? I think, this Freud never saw;

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:36.820
This is what it is. We have [UNCLEAR - BASED?] ugliness out of all that is [UNCLEAR]

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
We have created horror out of our security.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:51.640
You have created destruction out of all the constructed beautiful things. This is what you have done so

01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:58.780
from today, build up your hearts sometime, build up your mother and know

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:04.080
that we have to be beautiful, decent people. May God bless you!

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:15.440
Tomorrow I'm not in India but day after tomorrow,

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:23.380
I'll be free to have [UNCLEAR]. Thank you very much! Should we have meditation now?

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:32.200
[UNCLEAR] into meditation should [UNCLEAR]

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:41.920
For meditation, one has to know

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:45.360
that it is the Kundalini which clears you.

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:52.720
She's the one who clears you. Now the mantras

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:02.360
on the awakening of the deities helps you to expand the area of the chakras

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:09.400
which you can learn, later on, how to do but just now let us see.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:14.280
We can say, that there is no need to fear.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:22.040
There is no need to fear at all when the Mother, who is the Mother of the Universe

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:29.940
is looking after us. Just you say that and this center will open out and the Kundalini will rush through.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:37.920
Please put your both the hands towards Me, just like this. Stretch them a little, just stretch them.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.740
Close your eyes, close.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.360
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIKE]

01:14:54.360 --> 01:15:00.220
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIKE]

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:08.900
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIKE]

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:16.780
[SHREE MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIKE]

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.560
We have closed the air-conditioner.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.960
If you are getting the breeze, you should not think it's coming

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.760
now from Me and also from your head.

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:46.080
You can feel it coming out of your head. Put your right hand towards Me and feel it on your head.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.600
Now you can meditate.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.660
Now put both your hands towards Me and just for [UNCLEAR - FEW MINUTES?] close your eyes.

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:06.760
Close your eyes, please close your eyes.

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:20.660
Establish your chakra, establish your chakra of the heart

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:27.540
by paying attention there and say that, "Mother, I want to feel You."

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:35.060
I fear not, I don't fear

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.700
or say,

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.140
"I feel secured within myself."

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:58.120
Hmm, then it is better.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:03.240
Your left side is weaker - put your left hand towards Me

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:10.360
and right hand on the heart center, on the heart center, in the center.
