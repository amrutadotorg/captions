AI GENERATED!. Hi Daniel's taking us.

1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:00.870
So

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.109
just take something and then.

3
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.369
You take these sweets all right.

4
00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:13.369
Upcoming

5
00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.970
Guy,

6
00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:14.100
what's a Children just like sweets.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.469
I can see all the little.

8
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.780
the

9
00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.139
Great.

10
00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.860
OK

11
00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.650
OK.

12
00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.189
Yes,

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.610
you can put her back by 1 o'clock,

14
00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:49.220
is it easily

15
00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:51.659
so that

16
00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.779
she can arrive there by 3 o'clock.

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.720
She'll have something of her own

18
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.590
for

19
00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.580
lunch.

20
00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.419
Oh

21
00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:13.589
And even if you go late,

22
00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:14.500
it doesn't matter.

23
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.430
As long as she comes back at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock,

24
00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.500
will she be able to get back to your house?

25
00:01:22.629 --> 00:01:22.949
Yes she will.

26
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.900
A bad too.

27
00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.580
Thank you.

28
00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.690
But

29
00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:39.819
Is there a direct uh?

30
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.949
Like.

31
00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:45.059
For you to go direct.

32
00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:48.989
There are trains that are going by train.

33
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.500
Or by car.

34
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.199
I'm driving down by car.

35
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.019
So is there a direct route,

36
00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:57.110
or you have to go wire?

37
00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:59.970
I'll be going from Milton Keynes.

38
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.430
I think there is a direct road.

39
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.040
That's a direct route.

40
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.120
How much time do you take?

41
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.290
About 2 hours I think.

42
00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.589
From here

43
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.550
from here to Cambridge.

44
00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.830
I'm asking from here if you go to Cambridge,

45
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.550
she can meet you at the station.

46
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.380
We can arrange that in Cambridge in case if you find

47
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.389
that they're going to London and this is going to take too much time.

48
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.910
Because if you go to London now,

49
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.470
say,

50
00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:36.229
to London

51
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.770
and then to Cambridge,

52
00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.110
it will take 4 hours for you to drive.

53
00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.710
But supposing you go direct from here to Cambridge.

54
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.429
Then how much time will it take?

55
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.830
That's,

56
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.550
that's easy,

57
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.949
because I'm

58
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.389
driving away from here tonight because I have to work

59
00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.419
at a children's camp tonight and early tomorrow morning.

60
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.259
So then it takes me maybe an hour and a half from the place I'm at to go to Cambridge.

61
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.339
From here to Cambridge is only 1 hour and a half.

62
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.970
No,

63
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.440
from,

64
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.259
from Milton Keynes where I'm at a camp,

65
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.800
a children's camp,

66
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.630
then it's an hour and a half from there to Cambridge tomorrow morning.

67
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.279
Oh,

68
00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.839
I see.

69
00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.220
So it would be better if you go direct to Cambridge

70
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.080
and she meets you somewhere.

71
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.250
All right,

72
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.240
so we give

73
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.839
her your telephone number

74
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.690
and you can find her.

75
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.710
All right,

76
00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.619
you take her at Cambridge station

77
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.529
and take her around about

78
00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:31.919
and then send her away.

79
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.199
That's all.

80
00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.449
Is that all right?

81
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.759
That's better.

82
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.509
So we'll organise that.

83
00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.669
So that's better she should go directly by train,

84
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.940
take a return ticket,

85
00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:44.300
and come back.

86
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.830
The same price return ticket to a single ticket,

87
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.699
yes.

88
00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.899
piece

89
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.300
This is the sari Kapo I gave you.

90
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.320
I really.

91
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.750
There's little Machinra's Main Main,

92
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.960
let's have one by one.

93
00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.380
How are you?

94
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.639
Mother,

95
00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:17.100
will you excuse some people to go for?

96
00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:26.809
I just told them to go for lunch.

97
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.829
None of them will go.

98
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.299
I'm just talking to Masinda Nathan Company.

99
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.859
Alright.

100
00:04:44.109 --> 00:04:44.190
I'll see you slow.

101
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.239
I slow.

102
00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.660
There's got one more sweet.

103
00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:58.690
Alright,

104
00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.750
Main you can have.

105
00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:02.829
I'm.

106
00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:06.510
Main.

107
00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.630
Huh

108
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.209
Oh my

109
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.679
chin now.

110
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.399
Yeah

111
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.000
Oh

112
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.359
Oh.

113
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.730
Ah,

114
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.149
but

115
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.519
My king that.

116
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.489
Yeah

117
00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:33.579
That is my children.

118
00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:34.070
I bought,

119
00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.640
so it's too much now,

120
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.540
too much.

121
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.890
And now come.

122
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.989
She's that.

123
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.829
What.

124
00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:55.049
I

125
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.799
I,

126
00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:03.070
you know these things are plastic.

127
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.290
They're,

128
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:10.269
you see that it is broken.

129
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.309
You can see the white plaster is this?

130
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.609
Oh,

131
00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:18.290
just look at this camouflage.

132
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.040
I do it with the stone also the same way.

133
00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.850
They can do,

134
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.119
yes,

135
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.290
but plaster is easy.

136
00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.410
You just mould it and then just.

137
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.989
But in India you'll find.

138
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980
OK.

139
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.989
What's happening to you.

140
00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:51.059
I'm gonna

141
00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:53.040
Oh

142
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.399
I'm like

143
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.859
Matindena,

144
00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:01.010
how are you?

145
00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:02.559
Is he all right?

146
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.140
It was all right.

147
00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:05.470
It was better last week,

148
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.209
mother.

149
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:15.059
It seems to be better last week and was less good here you can see it kind of got cold,

150
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.730
I believe.

151
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.209
Yeah

152
00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:27.760
Yeah.

153
00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.929
be eating in the mouth.

154
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.989
How can you call that?

155
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.140
Oh

156
00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.660
Oh,

157
00:07:42.709 --> 00:07:43.480
It's one the most.

158
00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:44.880
You just take the car.

159
00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:50.549
Look at this spot.

160
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.850
Just see please.

161
00:07:57.679 --> 00:07:57.700
All right,

162
00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:58.190
take it.

163
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.470
Oh

164
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.899
All the children are here.

165
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.339
All the children are here.

166
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.799
The in the map.

167
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.420
What's that?

168
00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:18.839
Now,

169
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.489
Cathy's all right now.

170
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:26.779
She's all right.

171
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.019
Thank God she's all right.

172
00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:32.250
It's good.

173
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:34.058
OK.

174
00:08:34.859 --> 00:08:36.650
She can go back if she wants to.

175
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.450
I'd like to see her.

176
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.169
So now you'll go back to London.

177
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.489
You'll call her home,

178
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:43.520
you can

179
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:44.830
see.

180
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:46.369
Arti,

00:08:46.469 --> 00:08:47.140

182

How are you?

183
00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:51.309

00:09:00.989 --> 00:09:01.039

190
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:06.570
No,

191
00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:06.590

192
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.940
Ah.

236
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.109
His surname is Rahurikar

237
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.219
because he's from Rahui.

238
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.859

00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:21.369
He knows you.

261
00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.390
How do they understand vibration?

262
00:12:28.929 --> 00:12:28.940
Yeah

271
00:12:57.349 --> 00:12:59.900
Mommy's troubling you or daddy's troubling you?

272
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.130
Who is troubling you,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:01.450

OK

369
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:00.609
How about you know,

370
00:16:00.729 --> 00:16:01.049
better.

371
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:04.400
Mother,

372
00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:06.299
she was very ill about 2 months ago,

373
00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:09.510
quite feverish all over the very hot,

374
00:16:09.859 --> 00:16:13.510
and uh we should be those people that also have been bothering and she

375
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:13.650
was better after that and we were wondering what to do about it.

376
00:16:13.659 --> 00:16:13.700
Who are those people,

377
00:16:30.059 --> 00:16:30.140
those people that have been bothering.

378
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.229
This is the names you told me,

379
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:30.260
is it?

380
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:30.280
Yes,

381
00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:30.390
they're called something like the brothers.

382
00:16:30.419 --> 00:16:30.460
No,

383
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.010
you told me some names on the phone.

384
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:32.900
They are the same.

385
00:16:34.469 --> 00:16:36.289
What some people are trying to do all this.

386
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.750
They seem to have attacked.

387
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.080
They're still there.

388
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:43.859
I think,

389
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.690
I think,

390
00:16:44.729 --> 00:16:45.520
I think that

391
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.809
after we start burning the name and

392
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.090
you eating them every day,

393
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.750
their attack is more ferocious now so we're.

394
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:52.469
I saw that,

395
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.289
don't do it.

396
00:16:55.049 --> 00:16:55.349
Yes

397
00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:57.099
They,

398
00:16:58.119 --> 00:16:58.599
they are all right.

399
00:16:58.679 --> 00:16:59.640
They can fight it out.

400
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.039
They just do it.

401
00:17:02.599 --> 00:17:03.010
No,

402
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.590
no.

403
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:06.180
Oh yeah.

404
00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:13.198
Uh.

405
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.010
Really happy,

406
00:17:23.239 --> 00:17:23.449
huh?

407
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.699
What about you having a baby sometime?

408
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.560
Not yet,

409
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:35.890
Mother,

410
00:17:35.969 --> 00:17:36.719
but um,

411
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.250
I want to have one very soon.

412
00:17:40.209 --> 00:17:41.619
Your house is not yet settled.

413
00:17:43.689 --> 00:17:45.180
What happened to that house of yours?

414
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.609
The fellow was mad or what?

415
00:17:51.209 --> 00:17:51.290
Oh,

416
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:51.619
I see.

417
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.239
So then what are you still in the same house?

418
00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:54.290
Is it?

419
00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.609
So Alan was thinking of uh.

420
00:18:02.709 --> 00:18:03.849
arranging someplace,

421
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.469
Alan.

422
00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:08.469
You were saying that there would be a

423
00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:09.329
place together.

424
00:18:09.469 --> 00:18:10.630
What about you people?

425
00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:11.479
Who else?

426
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.040
Rosie and Rosie and me.

427
00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:15.760
What happened?

428
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:23.219
We're looking for Rosie is looking for one in Bristol Bristol

429
00:18:28.189 --> 00:18:29.079
on rent you would be,

430
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:29.790
it would be,

431
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.349
yes,

432
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.390
but um

433
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.189
landlords don't want

434
00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:35.869
people who are having children and um

435
00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:40.000
also there are a few of us who haven't got jobs and this doesn't help either.

436
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.569
How you can manage.

437
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:41.900
Uh,

438
00:18:41.979 --> 00:18:43.920
why not give them also the same thing

439
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.819
which you are doing for Bristol,

440
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.089
uh,

441
00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:49.189
for Brighton for Bristol,

442
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:49.849
the same thing,

443
00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:51.209
just see this kind of a thing.

444
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.050
It's a very good thing if you can work at Chris Jessie,

445
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:54.910
have a look at it.

446
00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:55.900
It's very interesting.

447
00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:58.040
And

448
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:02.699
that is how we got,

449
00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:02.729
I think.

450
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.410
So that you can use the Sergioga co op as a base.

451
00:19:06.589 --> 00:19:06.959
hello hello

452
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:10.089
hello.

453
00:19:14.459 --> 00:19:14.510
So your name is what?

454
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.349
Samuel Sam Samuel Mark.

455
00:19:16.199 --> 00:19:17.229
So what should we call it?

456
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.050
OK.

457
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.410
OK,

458
00:19:19.949 --> 00:19:20.760
what should we call it?

459
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.930
He's very strong,

460
00:19:24.939 --> 00:19:25.380
mother.

461
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.369
Like Samsung,

462
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:27.400
Sam.

463
00:19:31.589 --> 00:19:32.589
We have no Samsung.

464
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.550
First to call Simon a Samson,

465
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:35.160
many things I was,

466
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.630
but you should have another Indian name for him.

467
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:44.660
He was

468
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:46.699
honey.

469
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.109
Yeah

470
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.280
Oh

471
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:51.569
OK

472
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.189
OK.

473
00:19:57.569 --> 00:19:58.010
Yes

474
00:20:04.819 --> 00:20:04.829
Yeah.

475
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:15.119
So 11 month is the most powerful thing,

476
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.699
a month.

477
00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:20.510
I uh.

478
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.469
Oh

479
00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:31.239
So

480
00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:34.099
movement.

481
00:20:35.579 --> 00:20:35.939
I

482
00:20:47.609 --> 00:20:51.000
The greatest in Bhakti is the highest.

483
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.969
Hanumanta is the highest in Bhakti.

484
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.439
No greaterhata is there than

485
00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.979
Krishna has placed Ajuna.

486
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.189
Hanu Hanuman is the greatest because you see Ajuna is a human,

487
00:21:05.569 --> 00:21:07.939
but Hanumanta is Bhati is so great that

488
00:21:08.329 --> 00:21:08.979
he's a god.

489
00:21:11.369 --> 00:21:12.530
Gods have their own powers,

490
00:21:12.569 --> 00:21:13.579
despite that.

491
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:15.829
Devotion

492
00:21:16.479 --> 00:21:16.959
is great,

493
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.410
isn't it?

494
00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.050
The ones for gods to have this.

495
00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:21.560
Human beings than that.

496
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:24.530
What

497
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.920
Who's speaking I'm on.

498
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.619
Angel and Jay's son.

499
00:21:42.349 --> 00:21:42.979
Oh

500
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.489
Yeah

501
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.800
divorced the one who

502
00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:08.810
who sustains his good name right.

503
00:22:12.989 --> 00:22:13.469
Yeah

504
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.180
And you see,

505
00:22:15.219 --> 00:22:17.989
I named him William and this also he is named as William.

506
00:22:18.099 --> 00:22:18.969
Just look at that.

507
00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.910
I think now everybody is going to call 1 million.

508
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:24.680
Yes

509
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.790
And now

510
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:28.410
You got me.

511
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.349
This is Marina.

512
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.119
Her name is Marina Marina.

513
00:22:35.599 --> 00:22:35.680
No,

514
00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:35.920
no,

515
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.079
no,

516
00:22:36.199 --> 00:22:36.239
no,

517
00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:36.400
no,

518
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:36.660
no.

519
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.709
What happened?

520
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.079
What happened to you?

521
00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:42.930
What

522
00:22:51.489 --> 00:22:51.500
Yeah.

523
00:22:56.969 --> 00:22:57.280
That's.

524
00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:00.729
Why

525
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:04.670
Yeah.

526
00:23:07.349 --> 00:23:07.469
Oh.

527
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:11.469
No

528
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:13.099
Yeah

529
00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:16.300
Oh

530
00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:18.849
Where is she?

531
00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:32.449
None

532
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:36.660
Oh

533
00:23:48.109 --> 00:23:48.959
Same thing is it.

534
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.810
Does she keep all right.

535
00:23:58.369 --> 00:23:58.819
somebody else

536
00:24:03.849 --> 00:24:04.280
OK

537
00:24:05.739 --> 00:24:05.839
Why

538
00:24:07.829 --> 00:24:07.839
Mm

539
00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:14.829
Ah.

540
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.510
Why?

541
00:24:29.479 --> 00:24:30.329
Why to cry.

542
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.449
In it or what?

543
00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.040
You didn't go to any guru or anyone.

544
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.359
But I hope these horrible people are not working on him.

545
00:24:49.199 --> 00:24:49.209
Yeah

546
00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:54.170
Uh

547
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.619
To that

548
00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:00.760
Did you take,

549
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.239
did you,

550
00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:01.719
did you?

551
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.339
Meet them,

552
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.170
those people?

553
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:06.530
No,

554
00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.660
you never took children there with them.

555
00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:09.219
No,

556
00:25:09.339 --> 00:25:10.300
I think it was in Chile.

557
00:25:10.579 --> 00:25:11.280
I've never been to Chile

558
00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.239
they are back now here.

559
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.209
Not that they,

560
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.630
they operate on dead spirits and

561
00:25:18.839 --> 00:25:19.579
they can

562
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.959
if they think of somebody in anywhere in the world they

563
00:25:24.619 --> 00:25:25.640
they and this is what happened.

564
00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:28.829
But they know about the child's birth and all.

565
00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:32.839
They don't know nothing about Marin won't be able to know.

566
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.219
She's catching on the boy left,

567
00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.449
left Rajasthan.

568
00:25:36.489 --> 00:25:37.439
I don't know what.

569
00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.189
She's part of.

570
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.989
been living with them.

571
00:25:46.949 --> 00:25:47.439
Um,

572
00:25:47.569 --> 00:25:50.530
a little girl and she's catching very bad sort of stuff.

573
00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:52.329
Who,

574
00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.069
who is she?

575
00:25:59.079 --> 00:26:00.939
She's my brother's girlfriend's brother's girlfriend's daughter.

576
00:26:01.729 --> 00:26:01.780
She has a very bad.

577
00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:06.599
But what does she do?

578
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.589
This mother.

579
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.719
I think she's just a model,

580
00:26:14.599 --> 00:26:14.650
and that's it.

581
00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:17.630
Model that's fine.

582
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.199
You ask her to get out.

583
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.500
How is she in that house,

584
00:26:25.829 --> 00:26:27.260
we had to move from our house,

585
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.989
so we had to move to.

586
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:33.270
Oh,

587
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:33.300
I see.

588
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.390
But now you're no more there.

589
00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:40.900
feel like

590
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.579
Must be this modern business is dirty,

591
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.180
very bad.

592
00:26:44.229 --> 00:26:45.420
It's very auspicious.

593
00:26:45.589 --> 00:26:46.290
Hello,

594
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.869
hello,

595
00:26:46.989 --> 00:26:47.349
Mara.

596
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:48.469
Why did you cry?

597
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.910
That may be the reason there's a lingering effect last time also I remember.

598
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.079
Oh.

599
00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:02.969
One more

600
00:27:09.599 --> 00:27:10.839
Let's see if she gets it.

601
00:27:11.989 --> 00:27:12.650
Marina

602
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.060
That's it.

603
00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:24.020
Thank God you're out of it now.

604
00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:26.939
Horrible in

605
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.849
how they attack children.

606
00:27:32.989 --> 00:27:37.380
This is very inauspicious to go for modelling and selling your body like that,

607
00:27:37.459 --> 00:27:38.180
isn't it?

608
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.020
Models are nothing but just the very

609
00:27:41.579 --> 00:27:42.709
poor type of women.

610
00:27:44.189 --> 00:27:45.010
Why should you do it?

611
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.150
I just don't understand.

612
00:27:52.449 --> 00:27:54.500
I'm sure she'll be all right now once you

613
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.699
get out of that place.

614
00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.699
Oh.

615
00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:01.680
Look at this one.

616
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:03.790
It's a tiger.

617
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.709
Oh.

618
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:10.170
Come,

619
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:10.469
come,

620
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:10.750
come,

621
00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.030
come,

622
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:11.420
come.

623
00:28:12.969 --> 00:28:13.089
Go.

624
00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:14.619
Yeah.

625
00:28:23.069 --> 00:28:24.339
No boy.

626
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:27.800
See the smile is very,

627
00:28:29.719 --> 00:28:30.829
it's fallen off.

628
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.040
That's

629
00:28:39.939 --> 00:28:41.170
Everything to be vibrated.

630
00:28:42.229 --> 00:28:42.709
See that,

631
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.270
that's it,

632
00:28:43.349 --> 00:28:43.859
that's it.

633
00:28:46.189 --> 00:28:46.229
Now the movie that.

634
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.420
Remove the channel.

635
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:53.199
Remove everything that is,

636
00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:53.640
uh,

637
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.699
at 3 3 ft level.

638
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.310
No.

639
00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.150
you're gonna break.

640
00:29:03.849 --> 00:29:04.239
Uh

641
00:29:06.229 --> 00:29:06.250
Hoy,

642
00:29:07.939 --> 00:29:08.369
he's

643
00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.020
just finished some penicillin because he got

644
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:18.449
um croup,

645
00:29:18.459 --> 00:29:18.569
croup it's it's heart.

646
00:29:18.579 --> 00:29:19.050
It's breathing night,

647
00:29:19.229 --> 00:29:20.420
but he's much better now.

648
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:20.719
He,

649
00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.250
he had a bit of trouble breathing.

650
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.199
When I worried more he worried more,

651
00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:25.729
so I stopped worrying.

652
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:28.290
You see,

653
00:29:28.339 --> 00:29:28.949
if it is hot,

654
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.829
you should not suddenly expose children also as well.

655
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:42.030
I find that I don't know whether how hot he should be

656
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.489
and get overheated sometimes it's very difficult to know because in India,

657
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:43.510
but

658
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.880
40 days,

659
00:29:48.969 --> 00:29:51.849
so they never allow them to want to see the sun that.

660
00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:56.069
Hello,

661
00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:56.979
Marina.

662
00:29:57.349 --> 00:29:58.540
Are you all right now?

663
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:00.579
Are you better?

664
00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:04.449
You had a bad liver,

665
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:04.949
I think

666
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.500
it also would penicillin worsen it?

667
00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:11.000
How are you?

668
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.819
Is that my like.

669
00:30:16.359 --> 00:30:17.890
You are yourself a liver being.

670
00:30:18.569 --> 00:30:20.650
What else do you expect your child?

671
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.219
How is the speed?

672
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:26.310
Better now,

673
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.290
it rub it with some speed.

674
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.280
Oh my God,

675
00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.760
he's not bad.

676
00:30:40.489 --> 00:30:40.500
Oh.

677
00:30:42.689 --> 00:30:42.829
Oh.

678
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.489
Uh

679
00:30:45.709 --> 00:30:46.109
I could be.

680
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.510
Junior varsity.

681
00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:52.520
In

682
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.400
Watching the

683
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:01.150
You know that's your name.

684
00:31:04.959 --> 00:31:05.199
Uh

685
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:08.719
Hello,

686
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:09.050
hello,

687
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.410
hello.

688
00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:14.229
So full of life,

689
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.089
so full of life.

690
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.410
It's much better.

691
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.319
Hold on,

692
00:31:19.719 --> 00:31:19.920
hold on,

693
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:20.380
hold on,

694
00:31:20.599 --> 00:31:20.839
hold on.

695
00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:27.770
So

696
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.199
She's become very normal.

697
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.020
I think we'll have to get Susan also there.

698
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:57.020
Oh.

699
00:31:59.079 --> 00:31:59.089
Yeah.

700
00:32:01.099 --> 00:32:01.209
No,

701
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.069
I don't think so.

702
00:32:10.369 --> 00:32:10.719
She's not,

703
00:32:10.939 --> 00:32:12.290
not anymore.

704
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.339
He may not have brought up.

705
00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:18.619
He may not have brought up all his wind.

706
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.819
I fed him not long ago.

707
00:32:26.439 --> 00:32:26.449
Mm.

708
00:32:34.489 --> 00:32:35.050
Hey.

709
00:32:36.229 --> 00:32:36.599
Hey

710
00:32:39.489 --> 00:32:39.699
I

711
00:32:41.229 --> 00:32:42.030
It's slowly.

712
00:32:43.699 --> 00:32:44.229
It's the.

713
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:47.760
You're rolling now.

714
00:32:56.839 --> 00:32:57.810
He's going to put the right.

715
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.199
Hello

716
00:33:07.479 --> 00:33:08.449
She gets normal.

717
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.209
I see they have everything

718
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:11.869
stupid like stupid person,

719
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.119
she cries now she's stupid.

720
00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:16.859
What you need to cry for what

721
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.000
God has given you everything?

722
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:19.469
Did you cry,

723
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.329
you must thank God,

724
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:20.869
isn't it?

725
00:33:21.739 --> 00:33:23.060
God has blessed you with everything.

726
00:33:23.099 --> 00:33:23.890
Why should you,

727
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:24.619
uh,

728
00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.500
we are happy.

729
00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:29.699
Then be unhappy if you like it,

730
00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:30.930
let us have it.

731
00:33:38.109 --> 00:33:39.369
That's the main problem.

732
00:33:39.459 --> 00:33:41.310
You never understand what God has you.

733
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.410
Mhm

734
00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:45.989
Everyone unhappy,

735
00:33:46.069 --> 00:33:46.170
right,

736
00:33:46.229 --> 00:33:47.709
being unhappy you make everyone happy.

737
00:33:52.369 --> 00:33:52.380
Hm.

738
00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:20.040
I must tell you one news about the group.

739
00:34:20.918 --> 00:34:20.978
This one Jew in Australia.

740
00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:26.188
What's his name?

741
00:34:26.908 --> 00:34:27.658
What did you say?

742
00:34:27.748 --> 00:34:27.789
His name is Mr.

743
00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:27.839
Finish that.

744
00:34:35.217 --> 00:34:36.228
His name is also Rabbi.

745
00:34:36.309 --> 00:34:37.217
He's a rabbi.

746
00:34:39.168 --> 00:34:40.989
Do you have like that rabbi sketch?

747
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.239
The rabbi is the title,

748
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:44.820
isn't it?

749
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.340
means teacher actually.

750
00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.478
It can't be the name.

751
00:34:53.438 --> 00:34:53.449
No,

752
00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:53.899
no,

753
00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:54.020
no,

754
00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:55.050
that's the title,

755
00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:56.929
but I don't know his actual name.

756
00:34:58.459 --> 00:34:58.469
Uh,

757
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.120
I just thought maybe his name is.

758
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.260
Oh good.

759
00:35:08.489 --> 00:35:09.719
Are you better now.

760
00:35:12.429 --> 00:35:13.149
So

761
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:20.840
figure.

762
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:22.129
Yes,

763
00:35:24.469 --> 00:35:25.790
so these new people have gone away,

764
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.540
have they?

765
00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:29.060
Or they're going to come.

766
00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.310
I think some of them are,

767
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.479
some of them are having lunch.

768
00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.010
But it's gone.

769
00:35:39.399 --> 00:35:40.050
Dumb he's not.

770
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.889
Hold on

771
00:35:46.149 --> 00:35:47.570
You're going directly to Spain.

772
00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.889
From London or are you going back to Cambridge?

773
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:51.830
Director.

774
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:51.879
Tomorrow,

775
00:35:51.889 --> 00:35:51.899
tomorrow,

776
00:35:51.909 --> 00:35:51.919
tomorrow.

777
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:04.429
Mhm

778
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.070
Tomorrow evening,

779
00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:16.419
Uh,

780
00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:20.530
Doctor Singh was telling me this that way,

781
00:36:20.989 --> 00:36:22.750
but there's some writers were written.

782
00:36:23.929 --> 00:36:24.899
That has

783
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.620
a

784
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.810
powerful electronics,

785
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.590
a powerful electronic

786
00:36:31.179 --> 00:36:33.600
machine is there which makes everything indeed strong.

787
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.989
She said that some spiritual power is.

788
00:36:37.479 --> 00:36:38.719
Which is where you can make

789
00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:41.320
others spiritual or something.

790
00:36:42.379 --> 00:36:43.969
I don't know what what he said.

791
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.590
That writer and another one who was saying

792
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:47.810
was

793
00:36:48.219 --> 00:36:49.050
a

794
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.209
scientist

795
00:36:51.879 --> 00:36:52.969
who has talked about.

796
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:54.419
TH Green,

797
00:36:54.459 --> 00:36:54.699
you see,

798
00:36:54.709 --> 00:36:56.919
he was telling me that TH Green,

799
00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.090
uh,

800
00:36:58.139 --> 00:36:59.939
is the person who has done.

801
00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.939
Lot of research about you,

802
00:37:03.479 --> 00:37:05.489
but and he speaks just like a surgeon.

803
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.399
Have you read PhD in any one of you?

804
00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.129
So also ask him about this TH Green because

805
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.959
he did his uh

806
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:22.320
thesis on TH Green and uh no TH Green and uh Shankara.

807
00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.090
I

808
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.790
So you might be able to get information about that.

809
00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:31.909
That's one of the things you should let us know because

810
00:37:32.239 --> 00:37:33.709
somebody's doing now a thesis,

811
00:37:33.959 --> 00:37:36.159
is doing a thesis on yoga,

812
00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:37.330
so we can bring in all these things.

813
00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:40.000
Secondly,

814
00:37:40.479 --> 00:37:42.979
what has happened about those ceramics I said from here?

815
00:37:42.989 --> 00:37:43.030
What is it going?

816
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.129
They've got the permission.

817
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.899
They they've they've got to rented a shop in the best commercial district.

818
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.620
as well as the.

819
00:38:09.399 --> 00:38:09.520
Well,

820
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.189
first of all,

821
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.820
they've got the letter from the agent so they can proceed with customs clearance.

822
00:38:13.919 --> 00:38:15.919
They have not yet got customs clearance.

823
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:16.750
Secondly,

824
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.429
they've got

825
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.510
a property in the best business area of the city

826
00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:21.909
for a small shop,

827
00:38:22.239 --> 00:38:23.350
and thirdly they've got.

828
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:24.110
The

829
00:38:28.709 --> 00:38:31.760
centre somewhere they wanted to have it for the opening ceremony they told me.

830
00:38:32.219 --> 00:38:32.229
Well,

831
00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.850
it looks as though they looks as though they.

832
00:38:36.639 --> 00:38:36.760
See,

833
00:38:36.879 --> 00:38:38.870
first they should do the opening ceremony

834
00:38:39.679 --> 00:38:40.320
in the centre.

835
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.870
They wanted to invite people

836
00:38:42.439 --> 00:38:43.429
from everywhere

837
00:38:43.719 --> 00:38:46.790
and they were going to have an opening ceremony in that place.

838
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.030
Then they should go to this place,

839
00:38:49.239 --> 00:38:49.850
to the shop.

840
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.469
First of all,

841
00:38:50.479 --> 00:38:55.870
it is the start the centre they wanted to have some ceramics.

842
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.050
Isn't it?

843
00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:02.489
That was the idea to start in the in the place we went to visit.

844
00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.969
And then if they want they can start a shop,

845
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.270
but just now that is the best that you were going to.

846
00:39:09.439 --> 00:39:12.189
The idea was that they would open that they would have an exhibition of the

847
00:39:15.649 --> 00:39:17.129
ceramics you and they would invite all sorts of people

848
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:22.750
write to them this was the idea to invite

849
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:26.080
people for a new type of ceramics being created

850
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.399
and an exhibition of that.

851
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.919
And that they were saying we'll invite many people for that.

852
00:39:35.939 --> 00:39:38.850
But I was thinking if Don could talk to Mr.

853
00:39:38.879 --> 00:39:41.479
Singh and ask him who is the ambassador in Portugal,

854
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.449
I don't know who is he.

855
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.629
Indian ambassador,

856
00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.389
if he would oblige them by opening the centre,

857
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.659
by opening the ceramics because it's Indian ceramics,

858
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.560
we should not call them Indian,

859
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:57.239
but Indians died ceramics,

860
00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:57.989
that's it.

861
00:40:01.719 --> 00:40:04.219
We're saying that we've got training from Indian

862
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.449
people or something like that,

863
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:08.260
not far from here.

864
00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:09.969
All right,

865
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.850
so if just ask if somebody can inaugurate to see.

866
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.649
Because he has a very nice place for them,

867
00:40:19.429 --> 00:40:21.260
then the whole thing will come up to a level.

868
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:22.100
I

869
00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.879
What have they offered you as a job?

870
00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:30.439
translate

871
00:40:31.219 --> 00:40:31.229
I,

872
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:32.689
I'm filling in,

873
00:40:33.189 --> 00:40:35.370
filling in for his translator while he's on holiday.

874
00:40:42.149 --> 00:40:42.169
I think.

875
00:40:46.959 --> 00:40:48.389
It's for 2.5 months.

876
00:40:49.949 --> 00:40:50.000
To see for this later.

877
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:53.350
Uh,

878
00:40:53.459 --> 00:40:54.219
what about Gerard?

879
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.620
What's the situation for him?

880
00:40:55.729 --> 00:40:56.780
Did they say anything?

881
00:40:57.219 --> 00:40:58.540
What's your wife's position?

882
00:41:00.949 --> 00:41:02.020
Did you go and see her?

883
00:41:03.189 --> 00:41:03.979
What did she say?

884
00:41:04.949 --> 00:41:06.389
She's just waiting for the baby.

885
00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:08.709
She's just waiting for the baby.

886
00:41:10.459 --> 00:41:11.860
She hasn't said anything about science.

887
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:14.189
But now,

888
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:14.800
uh,

889
00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.010
baby is expected when.

890
00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.840
In October

891
00:41:18.689 --> 00:41:18.719
Mountain

892
00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:23.060
October.

893
00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.340
So about 2 months more.

894
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.030
By that time,

895
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:30.659
uh.

896
00:41:31.419 --> 00:41:32.780
You can find something for me?

897
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:34.600
Oh

898
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.330
So give him all the addresses,

899
00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:39.250
everything,

900
00:41:39.729 --> 00:41:40.520
and

901
00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.800
all the people who are there.

902
00:41:43.129 --> 00:41:44.479
You handle them carefully.

903
00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.280
And I'm sure you can do very well.

904
00:41:47.969 --> 00:41:49.209
How are your vibrations today?

905
00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:52.500
How are you?

906
00:41:53.909 --> 00:41:53.919
Oh

907
00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.090
I leave all English complications

908
00:42:00.659 --> 00:42:01.360
in England.

909
00:42:03.139 --> 00:42:04.370
English complications.

910
00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:05.159
This year

911
00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:07.090
is.

912
00:42:09.209 --> 00:42:09.659
Oh yeah

913
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:12.860
Hey

914
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.540
That are left now.

915
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:20.149
Are you feeling bad about it?

916
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:27.260
No,

917
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.419
you abundant.

918
00:42:27.429 --> 00:42:28.310
You abandon to Roxanne.

919
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.040
All of you be abundant to her.

920
00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.659
Put this 10.

921
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:42.709
And

922
00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:44.620
You've got him.

923
00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:51.310
The catches.

924
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:14.409
The Sudarshan who has come Sudarshan?

925
00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:15.189
He's

926
00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:21.350
he's come from Derbyshire I think.

927
00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:22.780
Giren.

928
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.979
She's come here

929
00:43:26.169 --> 00:43:27.600
from Oxford or from?

930
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:29.600
Is she here?

931
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:29.889
No,

932
00:43:29.929 --> 00:43:30.919
she hasn't come,

933
00:43:31.169 --> 00:43:32.350
but she's in Cambridge.

934
00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.520
So Derek said she could help to show.

935
00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:36.370
Hi,

936
00:43:36.689 --> 00:43:37.169
it's all right,

937
00:43:37.449 --> 00:43:38.520
she can go with you.

938
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800
I,

939
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:39.959
she's all right.

940
00:43:40.399 --> 00:43:40.870
Uh,

941
00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:42.590
because after she's a grown-up woman,

942
00:43:42.669 --> 00:43:44.510
what is there to be so frightened of anything?

943
00:43:44.669 --> 00:43:44.949
After all,

944
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:46.459
Derek is going to be with her,

945
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:47.629
and she's,

946
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.310
she's a married woman with two children.

947
00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:51.520
One daughter is in the matriculation class,

948
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:53.669
but she's also done a PhD in psychology,

949
00:43:53.719 --> 00:43:54.300
you see,

950
00:43:54.669 --> 00:43:55.120
just

951
00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:00.899
PAD in psychology has to be frightened of everybody else.

952
00:44:02.709 --> 00:44:04.780
Because they live in a pathological world,

953
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:05.949
they solve problems,

954
00:44:05.989 --> 00:44:06.939
pathologies,

955
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.030
they treat people as if they're all sick,

956
00:44:09.239 --> 00:44:09.699
you know.

957
00:44:12.709 --> 00:44:13.350
Today,

958
00:44:13.689 --> 00:44:16.260
Maureen was telling me she went and saw one book

959
00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:17.679
that in a sense,

960
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:18.360
a myth.

961
00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:19.290
Can you imagine?

962
00:44:21.879 --> 00:44:22.229
For them,

963
00:44:22.239 --> 00:44:22.729
in a sense,

964
00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:23.330
the myth.

965
00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.429
The other thing that is religion is an illusion of like opium.

966
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:32.479
What about psychology?

967
00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:34.750
That is the God's gift.

968
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:37.590
According to them,

969
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:37.699
God is an illusion.

970
00:44:37.709 --> 00:44:37.830
So how can it be God's gift?

971
00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:37.959
This must be devil's gift.

972
00:44:37.969 --> 00:44:37.979
Then

973
00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:49.419
if God is an illusion,

974
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.030
psychology must be devil's gift the way they are destroying everyone.

975
00:44:52.229 --> 00:44:53.360
They are destroying everyone.

976
00:44:53.939 --> 00:44:54.000
Mother,

977
00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:55.500
you do not know how they do it.

978
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:56.949
I'll explain to you.

979
00:45:03.419 --> 00:45:03.429
Yeah.

980
00:45:06.389 --> 00:45:08.290
He himself now he's convinced.

981
00:45:09.709 --> 00:45:10.810
Now what I'm saying,

982
00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:14.989
we'll have another book after your Jungian one about psychology.

983
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.709
You and Maureen put together,

984
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.149
bring them out in light.

985
00:45:19.189 --> 00:45:19.229
See,

986
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.860
the first thing they do is they hit the liver,

987
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:21.270
you see.

988
00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:23.949
First they let people have weak right sides anyhow.

989
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:25.189
They're all on the left,

990
00:45:25.429 --> 00:45:29.110
then they hit the liver with that every psychological drug hits the liver.

991
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.199
Everyone immediately is put,

992
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:37.709
so then the liver goes and then there's no I mean it's all these tranquillizers,

993
00:45:40.439 --> 00:45:42.580
these horrible and people have no chance.

994
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:47.219
If they still haven't recovered,

995
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:47.739
they shocked.

996
00:45:49.409 --> 00:45:49.419
Yeah.

997
00:45:55.199 --> 00:45:55.209
It.

998
00:46:01.129 --> 00:46:01.139
No.

999
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:06.379
They.

1000
00:46:07.679 --> 00:46:07.689
Yeah

1001
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:15.330
That.

1002
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:19.050
I don't think.

1003
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:22.370
Sorry.

1004
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:24.830
See.

1005
00:46:34.649 --> 00:46:34.830
A decoguya

1006
00:46:38.389 --> 00:46:38.889
you know machinakotatikara.

1007
00:46:40.429 --> 00:46:52.219
Awn phoned me up twice.

1008
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.350
How is she not very tired and she's got some information the rest and.

1009
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.560
feeding the baby and she's a bit unhappy.

1010
00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:03.090
Oh,

1011
00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:03.649

1012
00:47:03.729 --> 00:47:04.969
she's she's still carrying out.

1013
00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:05.689
She'll be all right.

1014
00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.399
Loga baby.

1015
00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:13.699

Huh

1021
00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:29.270
Give it to the mummy.

1022
00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.239
Good.

1023
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:35.870

00:47:55.889 --> 00:47:56.969
Well what bad is she,

My bad,

00:48:01.719 --> 00:48:01.729

1033
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:05.370
Oh.

1034
00:48:09.679 --> 00:48:10.080
Oh,

1035
00:48:14.129 --> 00:48:14.260
Wow.

1036
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:18.010
You

1037
00:48:22.179 --> 00:48:22.449
Yeah,

1038
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.360
yeah,

1039
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:23.570
OK.

1040
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:28.199
It's beautiful,

1041
00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:28.840
isn't it?

1042
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.679
I asked.

1043
00:48:31.429 --> 00:48:32.179
Er.

1044
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:45.129
What's on his head,

1045
00:48:45.139 --> 00:48:45.149
oh.

1046
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800
S

1047
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520
Yeah

1048
00:48:56.479 --> 00:48:58.030
didn't give me any trouble to you.

1049
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.149
Really nice.

1050
00:49:00.219 --> 00:49:01.219
He's very good all the time.

1051
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.860
He's very sweet,

1052
00:49:04.199 --> 00:49:04.540
sweet.

1053
00:49:06.139 --> 00:49:06.639
Hello.

1054
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:13.070
Hold the head,

1055
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:13.530
I think.

1056
00:49:13.979 --> 00:49:14.719
He must be held.

1057
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:17.219
Always put your hand under the head.

1058
00:49:17.429 --> 00:49:17.629
Yeah,

1059
00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:18.270
keep it.

1060
00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:24.889
Well Tina,

1061
00:49:25.419 --> 00:49:25.760
what Tina.

1062
00:49:30.219 --> 00:49:30.290
So should be the other food now

1063
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.060
for lunch.

1064
00:49:34.939 --> 00:49:35.810
They've come back.

1065
00:49:37.379 --> 00:49:38.090
They ring a bell.

1066
00:49:41.129 --> 00:49:41.989
What about lunch.

1067
00:49:44.739 --> 00:49:45.719
I can have with you.

1068
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:47.820
Yours is ready,

1069
00:49:48.239 --> 00:49:48.800
whenever you like.

1070
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.629
Yours is ready whenever you'd like.

1071
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.919
Mother said she'd have it with us.

1072
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.030
How are you?

1073
00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:54.070
Are you better?

1074
00:50:04.629 --> 00:50:04.669
To Pamila.

1075
00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:09.370
Now you know why your

1076
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:10.709
thing failed.

1077
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:25.570
Mother,

1078
00:50:25.649 --> 00:50:27.439
I just wanted to say thank you for,

1079
00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:27.760
uh,

1080
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:28.110
my,

1081
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:29.120
my family.

1082
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:30.479
I really

1083
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:31.560
feel loved.

1084
00:50:32.209 --> 00:50:32.889
It's nice.

1085
00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:33.959
You're so much better.

1086
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:35.250
You're going to come and see me,

1087
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:35.810
right?

1088
00:50:35.929 --> 00:50:36.479
Yes.

1089
00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:38.500
How are you?

1090
00:50:39.479 --> 00:50:39.500
All right.

1091
00:50:42.659 --> 00:50:43.590
What about these two?

1092
00:50:43.629 --> 00:50:44.899
Have they come or gone?

1093
00:50:47.669 --> 00:50:47.800
Well,

1094
00:50:47.959 --> 00:50:48.330
they're here,

1095
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.199
what are they?

1096
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:51.729
I'm sorry.

1097
00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:55.179
You see why I asked you to go because yesterday I was very heavy,

1098
00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:56.500
and I couldn't raise the kundalini.

1099
00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:57.439
I just couldn't even

1100
00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:58.260
talk.

1101
00:50:58.350 --> 00:50:58.610
You see,

1102
00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.649
the weight was too heavy on me,

1103
00:51:00.659 --> 00:51:01.209
you see.

1104
00:51:01.739 --> 00:51:04.250
So that's why I said for Puja better not have you

1105
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:06.379
because very intensive work it is,

1106
00:51:06.419 --> 00:51:06.689
you see,

1107
00:51:06.699 --> 00:51:08.229
and it cannot be managed.

1108
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:10.270
But for her and we'll manage.

1109
00:51:10.379 --> 00:51:10.850
All right,

1110
00:51:11.139 --> 00:51:12.479
gradually you must cleanse yourself,

1111
00:51:12.659 --> 00:51:13.449
become lighter

1112
00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.219
and no use arguing.

1113
00:51:15.229 --> 00:51:16.530
Who was the girl arguing?

1114
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:17.459
Where is she?

1115
00:51:21.899 --> 00:51:21.909
Yeah.

1116
00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.939
Somebody was arguing before the Puja.

1117
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:29.139
Where is she?

1118
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:30.689
Is that correct?

1119
00:51:33.729 --> 00:51:35.050
She must be having lunchchos.

1120
00:51:36.629 --> 00:51:37.439
I think she's from Bristol.

1121
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:43.570
I think one from where I

1122
00:51:46.719 --> 00:51:48.080
think it was a lady from Bath.

1123
00:51:49.179 --> 00:51:50.419
She's not here today.

1124
00:51:51.709 --> 00:51:52.669
That's the best.

1125
00:51:58.850 --> 00:51:59.530
nicely.

1126
00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:01.280
How are you enjoying now?

1127
00:52:01.629 --> 00:52:02.149
Quite happy.

1128
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:05.510
What about your house?

1129
00:52:07.929 --> 00:52:10.129
What they said they'd consider it.

1130
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:18.239
You should find out something like uh veggies,

1131
00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:22.260
but it will be then you can be here.

1132
00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.060
Let's see.

1133
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:24.360
What are they saying?

1134
00:52:24.959 --> 00:52:25.189
Well,

1135
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:25.560
they're,

1136
00:52:25.949 --> 00:52:26.149
you know,

1137
00:52:26.229 --> 00:52:28.550
there's a lot of people more desperate than us

1138
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:31.580
and to become homeless would be the only way

1139
00:52:38.379 --> 00:52:38.719
to get to homeless and then we have to go into bed

1140
00:52:38.719 --> 00:52:40.760
and breakfast to a bed and breakfast hotel so they can find

1141
00:52:44.199 --> 00:52:44.260
accommodation.

1142
00:52:44.389 --> 00:52:46.620
They don't consider them high on the priority list,

1143
00:52:46.669 --> 00:52:47.669
in other words.

1144
00:52:50.209 --> 00:52:52.000
That's why I try to go.

1145
00:52:53.669 --> 00:52:53.689
All right,

1146
00:52:53.699 --> 00:52:54.810
now I understand.

1147
00:52:55.209 --> 00:52:55.600
So

1148
00:52:55.889 --> 00:52:58.050
then I think you better do it in that case,

1149
00:52:58.129 --> 00:52:58.449
sir.

1150
00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:04.030
Oh

1151
00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:05.459
Oh

1152
00:53:07.389 --> 00:53:07.840
Oh you said you

1153
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:12.860
That my head is not.

1154
00:53:15.949 --> 00:53:17.330
I have to have a big woman.

1155
00:53:19.679 --> 00:53:19.919
Hello by Matane.

1156
00:53:27.489 --> 00:53:27.510
Mata.

1157
00:53:30.459 --> 00:53:30.469
Oh,

1158
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:32.290
thank you very much.

1159
00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:34.770
Is about.

1160
00:53:35.469 --> 00:53:35.530
But did you learn from I

1161
00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.229
I taught her how to make uh I know how to make her very simple.

1162
00:53:39.239 --> 00:53:39.300
You don't have to.

1163
