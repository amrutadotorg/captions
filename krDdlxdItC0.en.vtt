00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:09.989
Today's Puja of Vishnumaya,

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:12.738
who was the sister of Shri Krishna,

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.614
was not scheduled as such in an international

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.489
pujas that we do.

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:25.614
But they say for the love of God

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.156
when all the devotees assemble,

00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:37.489
God also has to break many rules,

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:44.364
and that's how this puja has been accepted to be done.

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:48.738
At least once it should be done, I think, was a good idea.

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:50.905
By your love

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.030
and your devotion it was desired,

00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:02.780
and so this puja is going to be performed.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:06.738
It's just spontaneous

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:10.864
that I happened to be in England at this time,

00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:13.738
because this puja if ever had happened,

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:15.614
would have happened in India.

00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:21.905
Because this is a puja of a deity,

00:01:23.573 --> 00:01:25.030
Vishnumaya,

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:31.780
the seed of which is not easy to plant

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:34.738
in the Western countries.

00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:42.573
Now the whole shakti programming has been done

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:48.573
in such a way that we have Mother as a Shakti first,

00:01:49.322 --> 00:01:50.780
the Primordial Mother.

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:54.197
Then we have three shaktis coming out of Her,

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:56.905
as you know - Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:01:57.656 --> 00:02:02.197
And then we have children from them:

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:05.989
brothers and sisters.

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:10.573
So before the power

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
of what we call the wife or the spouse was created,

00:02:14.698 --> 00:02:16.905
is the power of the sister is created.

00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:20.989
So, as you know that Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha were born

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.698
to these three Shaktis,

00:02:22.698 --> 00:02:25.030
and they all had sisters.

00:02:25.864 --> 00:02:28.364
And their sisters were married

00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:35.197
- like Vishnu's sister is Parvati

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:38.364
and She was married to Shiva.

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:41.364
Is very important to understand

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.197
that these three types of powers

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:49.698
always play on the chakras.

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:52.239
And if you understand these three powers,

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.656
how they play,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.364
then you will understand

00:02:55.656 --> 00:02:59.239
what is the importance of Vishnumaya is.

00:02:59.656 --> 00:03:04.656
Vishnumaya is the power of a sister in a family.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.489
So the female is the power,

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.114
and the male is the kinetic power

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.573
which asserts the powers

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.448
of these three powers which surround him.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.698
So when the male power comes in,

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.489
all these powers become

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:39.322
helpful acting associates with that power.

00:03:40.573 --> 00:03:44.239
Now Vishnumaya's power is very important to understand,

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.573
because Mother power is to protect your innocence,

00:03:47.573 --> 00:03:49.822
because that is the most important thing.

00:03:49.822 --> 00:03:53.114
To protect your innocence is the Mother's power.

00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:58.822
Now, Vishnumaya's power is to protect your chastity.

00:04:00.864 --> 00:04:04.406
You don't understand sometimes what is chastity

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:06.947
and what is innocence.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:11.698
Innocence is a power which is not acted upon.

00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:14.406
Like we have electricity in our house,

00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:19.322
the electricity exists like innocence exists within us;

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.822
but enactment of that is done through chastity.

00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:27.822
A person can say,

00:04:27.822 --> 00:04:31.239
"I did this very innocently" - no, he cannot.

00:04:31.698 --> 00:04:34.197
Because whatever you do if it is innocent,

00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:37.114
cannot be harmful to your character,

00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:41.698
to your innocence or to your righteousness.

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:43.780
So those people who say like this,

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.448
that "I did it innocently" are wrong,

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:50.739
because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity.

00:04:51.614 --> 00:04:55.573
So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity.

00:04:56.448 --> 00:04:59.905
You must have respect of your chastity.

00:05:00.905 --> 00:05:04.322
Chastity is the one which is Vishnumaya's power within us,

00:05:04.322 --> 00:05:07.156
Gauri's power, is the pure virgin.

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:08.864
She doesn't marry.

00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:12.739
As you know that Vishnumaya was created,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.905
just after Her birth She was killed by Kamsa.

00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:23.364
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us,

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.864
we have to know that chastity is the foundation

00:05:27.114 --> 00:05:28.739
of all dharmas.

00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:31.489
Unless and until you have sense of chastity

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.364
you cannot have dharma.

00:05:33.864 --> 00:05:36.905
Dharma is not possible because that's the foundation.

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:39.489
It will be a house of cards;

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.448
if you do not have the foundation of chastity

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:46.698
it will just collapse in no time.

00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:50.239
So is a very important thing is chastity

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:52.864
which has been challenged in the West throughout,

00:05:52.864 --> 00:05:55.114
and that's why I'm saying is difficult

00:05:55.114 --> 00:05:57.489
to sow the seed of chastity in this country.

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:58.989
And that it should happen,

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:02.322
there must be some divine plan I think,

00:06:02.322 --> 00:06:05.780
that it has happened that this great puja

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.989
should be performed here.

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:08.864
It's not a easy puja to do

00:06:08.864 --> 00:06:11.114
- is to be done by people who are innocent,

00:06:11.573 --> 00:06:14.573
done by people who have lead a very religious life;

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.364
those who have been very chaste,

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:18.322
have respected their chastity.

00:06:18.322 --> 00:06:19.780
But now as you are saints,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.072
before you everything is pure and good,

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:27.322
because now you have been leading a saintly life.

00:06:27.322 --> 00:06:31.364
That's why chastity has become awakened in you,

00:06:31.364 --> 00:06:35.114
and chastity works in you as Gauri, as your kundalini.

00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:40.656
So if you come to the essence of religious life,

00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:44.989
of righteous life, of Sahaja Yoga life, is chastity.

00:06:47.448 --> 00:06:48.989
You cannot diversify it.

00:06:49.864 --> 00:06:53.322
Now this chastity gives you the maryadas,

00:06:53.573 --> 00:06:54.905
means delimits you.

00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:02.114
(Why are you sitting here?

00:07:02.114 --> 00:07:04.114
Go further, it's better to be in front.

00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:05.989
This is - you are not doing the puja.

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:08.114
If you are doing the puja, then you sit here.

00:07:08.114 --> 00:07:09.905
Otherwise, better sit down.

00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:11.739
Better get My vibrations there,

00:07:11.739 --> 00:07:14.239
in front. Here, come along.)

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:22.738
So the chastity is the one that gives you maryadas,

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.614
gives you the limits.

00:07:24.947 --> 00:07:26.656
How does it give you the limits?

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:31.156
Like the, in the sky is the lightning.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.364
When the two clouds,

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:37.864
who are like Sahaja yogis we can say,

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:42.322
came out of the sea

00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:44.072
and pure water is

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:54.780
there in the, those clouds,

00:07:55.114 --> 00:07:57.738
and they have to be poured out;

00:07:58.989 --> 00:08:03.156
when they come closer together

00:08:03.864 --> 00:08:06.448
and cross their limits of their ego,

00:08:06.448 --> 00:08:10.614
or fight with each other or in any way clash,

00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:14.489
is, there is this chastity,

00:08:14.739 --> 00:08:17.030
this lightning that takes place.

00:08:17.448 --> 00:08:21.197
This lightning which says that

00:08:21.197 --> 00:08:24.489
"You are wrong. Why are you fighting among yourself?

00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:26.989
Why are you crossing each other's ego?"

00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:28.780
That's the sister's job.

00:08:29.114 --> 00:08:31.322
Yesterday we have had many sisters.

00:08:31.614 --> 00:08:34.239
Now the sister's job is not to take sides,

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.489
but to show that if you cross your limits

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:38.989
of your brotherliness,

00:08:39.322 --> 00:08:42.156
then there will be a lightning.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.905
Now this power of lightning

00:08:46.573 --> 00:08:49.989
is a part of the power of Shri Krishna

00:08:50.322 --> 00:08:52.573
which He took it out from Himself.

00:08:53.573 --> 00:08:56.489
That's why He became such a sweet,

00:08:58.364 --> 00:09:00.989
gentle incarnation.

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:02.239
He took it out.

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:04.030
He said, "Now you've become My sister,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:08.698
and every time they try to misbehave you better work it out.

00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:13.864
And that's how Shri Krishna became such a gentle and a very,

00:09:14.239 --> 00:09:17.448
as they call it, romantic incarnation;

00:09:18.448 --> 00:09:21.030
because He took out the sisterly part away

00:09:21.573 --> 00:09:22.780
and He worked it out.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.531
But She was always with Him

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:26.738
and She worked with Him;

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.822
because the sister in the family

00:09:29.114 --> 00:09:31.531
has to see that the brothers don't fight,

00:09:31.947 --> 00:09:33.614
they are all looked after well,

00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:36.406
that they are not challenged by others,

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:38.698
that she gives them the maryadas

00:09:38.698 --> 00:09:42.780
how far to go - how far to go.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.780
Now it's very important,

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.406
very, very important for all of us to understand

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:53.406
that Freud and all these nonsensical people

00:09:53.698 --> 00:10:00.406
brought forth the theories to challenge Vishnumaya,

00:10:01.947 --> 00:10:08.947
so that we should have all kinds of funny relationships,

00:10:08.947 --> 00:10:11.281
which is an impossibility,

00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:12.905
is a wrong thing.

00:10:13.156 --> 00:10:16.489
Now if there is any relationship like that

00:10:17.614 --> 00:10:21.156
between brothers and sisters,

00:10:21.614 --> 00:10:25.822
for seven generations the family suffers

00:10:26.072 --> 00:10:29.239
from terrible diseases - seven generations.

00:10:32.738 --> 00:10:36.531
But if there's another like Freud-style relationship,

00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:40.905
then fourteen generations the family has to suffer.

00:10:42.114 --> 00:10:46.489
So the limiting forces of Vishnumaya are such

00:10:46.738 --> 00:10:50.448
that your ego is controlled, your superego is controlled,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.114
your family is controlled.

00:10:53.448 --> 00:10:55.489
Everybody is under control,

00:10:55.738 --> 00:11:00.364
under the guidance of this pure power of Vishnumaya

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.489
which exists within all of us.

00:11:04.905 --> 00:11:06.989
And the saddest part is that

00:11:06.989 --> 00:11:08.698
in all the Western countries

00:11:08.698 --> 00:11:12.364
Vishnumaya is sick, absolutely sick.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.905
I mean, I have lost My hearing even,

00:11:15.156 --> 00:11:17.281
up to that point it has come,

00:11:17.698 --> 00:11:18.905
on the left-hand side,

00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:24.364
because the sense of chastity is completely lacking.

00:11:25.698 --> 00:11:27.698
We have to forget about the people now

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.822
who have no sense at all, but now we are Sahaja yogis.

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:35.114
So coming to the right point, we have to say that,

00:11:35.406 --> 00:11:39.489
that many people have still some lingering funny ideas,

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.822
like "I have a good friendship with that gentleman"

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:45.780
or "I'm very friendly with such and such gentleman"

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.030
and all that.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.947
It's not a maryada then.

00:11:49.738 --> 00:11:55.281
You cannot have friendship with - between men and women,

00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:58.989
you cannot, it's absolutely absurd.

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:01.239
In the West the whole culture is funny;

00:12:01.239 --> 00:12:03.114
because if you go to a dinner party

00:12:03.114 --> 00:12:04.989
you are supposed to sit with somebody's husband

00:12:05.281 --> 00:12:07.364
on both the sides - horrible!

00:12:08.114 --> 00:12:11.030
But in the East it's not done,

00:12:12.364 --> 00:12:15.364
because the Vishnumaya is against these things.

00:12:15.614 --> 00:12:19.156
She will see to it that husband and wife sit together.

00:12:21.364 --> 00:12:24.364
Now here, as you know, the chastity part

00:12:24.698 --> 00:12:25.905
is so much missing

00:12:25.905 --> 00:12:28.030
that our left Vishuddhis are catching.

00:12:28.406 --> 00:12:31.114
And when I talk about it, it catches more.

00:12:32.281 --> 00:12:33.905
Now when you say you are not guilty,

00:12:33.905 --> 00:12:36.905
you are actually admitting it to Vishnumaya,

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.156
to your own sister,

00:12:38.406 --> 00:12:41.698
saying that "I am not guilty."

00:12:41.698 --> 00:12:44.905
But She doesn't like you to have the guilt upon you.

00:12:44.905 --> 00:12:47.364
The wife may like you to have the guilt.

00:12:47.364 --> 00:12:49.406
She may like that you should have the guilt,

00:12:49.738 --> 00:12:52.030
because she thinks her power is challenged

00:12:52.281 --> 00:12:55.989
and that she has somebody who is her rival.

00:12:56.281 --> 00:12:59.905
But not, not Vishnumaya;

00:12:59.905 --> 00:13:02.698
the sister does not say that.

00:13:02.989 --> 00:13:06.780
But a brother and a sister are never friends.

00:13:07.822 --> 00:13:09.780
Now in a group we are sitting here.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.114
Like that, in any group a brother and a sister,

00:13:14.573 --> 00:13:17.780
they are, they know that they exist as brothers and sisters

00:13:18.156 --> 00:13:19.905
but they don't cling onto one person,

00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:21.364
they don't talk to one person,

00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:24.281
they don't get friendly with that sister.

00:13:24.822 --> 00:13:28.489
Like once we had a big fate with these Christians once,

00:13:28.738 --> 00:13:31.156
I remember, and I must be having at least

00:13:31.406 --> 00:13:35.489
thirty cousins and four, five brothers I had at that time.

00:13:36.614 --> 00:13:38.614
And we went to that function,

00:13:38.614 --> 00:13:40.239
and among Indian Christians

00:13:40.489 --> 00:13:44.614
we have Christians from all kinds of stratas.

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:49.114
So there were some vagabonds I think,

00:13:49.114 --> 00:13:51.573
they passed some remarks about us,

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.614
we sisters, you see.

00:13:54.738 --> 00:13:56.364
We didn't know we had so many cousins.

00:13:56.698 --> 00:13:59.780
They all shot out, you see, just like jack-in-the-box,

00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:04.114
and they all took over and started beating those boys.

00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:06.864
And then we realized so many cousins we have.

00:14:06.864 --> 00:14:08.364
Otherwise we never knew;

00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:10.780
they were somewhere, we were not talking to them much,

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.156
we were talking among ourselves, our friends,

00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:14.905
we girls were talking to each other.

00:14:14.905 --> 00:14:17.030
Suddenly we found we have so many cousins

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.738
and so many brothers. It was most surprising

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.156
that we should have so many cousins there

00:14:22.448 --> 00:14:23.239
we did not know.

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:26.030
Immediately they jumped on the protection

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:28.573
of the chastity of their sister,

00:14:28.573 --> 00:14:31.738
because she is the basis of their chastity.

00:14:33.114 --> 00:14:37.573
But normally you don't talk to your brother much,

00:14:38.114 --> 00:14:41.573
nor the brother talks to you so much,

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.156
you don't get friendly.

00:14:43.156 --> 00:14:46.489
But at the time of difficulties, at the time of maryadas,

00:14:46.738 --> 00:14:51.780
at the time of consulting about something

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.698
that is dear to the family, the sister comes in.

00:14:55.489 --> 00:14:57.322
Recently My own brother, younger brother,

00:14:57.322 --> 00:14:58.364
wrote a letter to Me

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.322
because there's a problem in the family.

00:15:00.573 --> 00:15:04.739
Now My mother is not there, and normally a sister is better

00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:09.573
because she is easily available to you than the mother.

00:15:09.573 --> 00:15:11.322
Mother is so busy with the whole family,

00:15:11.322 --> 00:15:12.905
the whole work, you know what she's doing.

00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:16.072
So the sisterly feeling is very important.

00:15:16.364 --> 00:15:20.698
Now just imagine that our left Vishuddhi is so bad.

00:15:26.656 --> 00:15:28.197
It is, of course,

00:15:28.448 --> 00:15:30.573
because we have never cared for our chastity,

00:15:30.864 --> 00:15:33.448
we have not respected our chastity.

00:15:33.947 --> 00:15:35.947
In India it is not so.

00:15:36.197 --> 00:15:40.739
Women and men all respect their chastity very much.

00:15:41.156 --> 00:15:43.864
And I've asked some foreign-going boys,

00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:46.531
they said that "Though we were doing all wrong things

00:15:46.531 --> 00:15:49.322
as they were doing, we all the time somehow knew

00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:51.156
that we were doing wrong."

00:15:51.156 --> 00:15:52.156
I said, "How is it?"

00:15:52.156 --> 00:15:55.072
He said, "There's something like a sister's relationship."

00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:01.822
But now I can say that Indian men are also becoming

00:16:01.822 --> 00:16:03.281
just like you people,

00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:06.573
and have lost their power to keep their chastity.

00:16:06.947 --> 00:16:09.406
The men must respect their chastity,

00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:14.281
because they think they do not owe anything to the chastity.

00:16:14.947 --> 00:16:21.406
And if the basis of your spiritual existence

00:16:21.822 --> 00:16:24.573
doesn't exist, you'll collapse in no time.

00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:27.989
For that I have many a times said that

00:16:27.989 --> 00:16:32.156
put your attention on the Mother Earth, the green.

00:16:32.531 --> 00:16:33.738
Green is the color,

00:16:33.738 --> 00:16:35.822
if you put your attention into that

00:16:36.072 --> 00:16:39.947
then you will be saved

00:16:40.406 --> 00:16:44.156
from these errors you are committing of adultery

00:16:44.156 --> 00:16:45.864
all the time,

00:16:46.656 --> 00:16:48.156
your looking at others' sisters,

00:16:48.406 --> 00:16:51.322
others' wives, others' daughters.

00:16:52.656 --> 00:16:53.822
So the relationship

00:16:53.822 --> 00:16:56.531
that is now being expressed, as you know,

00:16:56.531 --> 00:16:57.364
is of a daughter,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.738
of a sister and of a mother,

00:17:06.156 --> 00:17:09.822
which is a very, very pure relationship.

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:16.239
So much so that now, supposing you use your brains too much,

00:17:16.489 --> 00:17:19.573
then why does your heart catch - have you thought of that?

00:17:19.864 --> 00:17:24.739
Why does your heart catch when you use right side too much?

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.114
What is the reason for catching your heart?

00:17:33.448 --> 00:17:35.905
Must understand this, it's the same thing.

00:17:36.573 --> 00:17:42.489
The relationship of, say, Shiva is to Vishnu in two ways.

00:17:43.864 --> 00:17:49.780
Firstly Vishnu's wife - the sister, He has married.

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:52.698
All right?

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:56.489
Then who is the sister of Shiva?

00:17:57.739 --> 00:18:00.197
Shiva's sister is Saraswati.

00:18:00.614 --> 00:18:03.780
If you work too much on Saraswati, heart will catch.

00:18:04.364 --> 00:18:05.698
It has maryadas.

00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:12.322
This is how the intermarriages took place,

00:18:12.573 --> 00:18:14.573
by which the sister's relationship

00:18:14.864 --> 00:18:19.905
is worked out to keep your maryadas of your chakras.

00:18:21.239 --> 00:18:22.489
If you cross that,

00:18:22.739 --> 00:18:24.656
you suddenly get into the left or the right

00:18:24.656 --> 00:18:27.364
because you have crossed the maryadas of that.

00:18:28.738 --> 00:18:31.448
Now this sisterly relationship existed

00:18:31.738 --> 00:18:34.573
in other incarnations also;

00:18:34.573 --> 00:18:36.489
like Mohammed Sahib

00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:39.448
had a sisterly relationship

00:18:40.322 --> 00:18:47.114
with - actually what we have to say that

00:18:47.656 --> 00:18:50.364
His sister as such was Ali's wife,

00:18:50.364 --> 00:18:53.698
but She was born to Him as a daughter.

00:18:54.989 --> 00:18:59.656
So they can be born as the daughter or as the sister.

00:19:00.114 --> 00:19:03.197
She was born as Nanaka's sister, Nanaki.

00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:07.989
She was born as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib.

00:19:08.239 --> 00:19:14.072
So it could be a sister or could be

00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:19.364
the daughter of an incarnation.

00:19:19.698 --> 00:19:25.947
But daughter and sister are innocent, pure chastity.

00:19:27.448 --> 00:19:30.114
Now think of it, that those people

00:19:30.114 --> 00:19:36.698
who cannot understand the importance of chastity,

00:19:37.364 --> 00:19:42.114
how can they talk of any laws whatsoever?

00:19:44.989 --> 00:19:48.114
- because "laws" means maryadas,

00:19:49.448 --> 00:19:53.698
and it has the proper sense

00:19:54.698 --> 00:19:57.197
through the power of Vishnumaya.

00:19:58.448 --> 00:20:02.656
Now you might say that not to steal anybody else's thing

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:10.072
is also not proper, because it belongs to somebody else.

00:20:10.698 --> 00:20:12.698
But who will tell you?

00:20:13.114 --> 00:20:16.364
Who is the one that is going to tell you that this is wrong?

00:20:16.364 --> 00:20:18.614
Of course, there is police, but

00:20:18.822 --> 00:20:20.364
who has told?

00:20:20.698 --> 00:20:22.114
The lawmakers.

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:26.364
Which part of the unconscious has played is the Vishnumaya;

00:20:27.114 --> 00:20:30.738
because as soon as you steal something you feel guilty.

00:20:32.406 --> 00:20:35.364
In the law also this word "guilty" is used.

00:20:35.947 --> 00:20:40.531
And guilty comes from the left side, is Vishnumaya.

00:20:44.947 --> 00:20:49.030
So how important it is to have a sense of chastity.

00:20:49.738 --> 00:20:51.738
But we are very divided people,

00:20:51.738 --> 00:20:54.738
and those who have moral chastity

00:20:54.738 --> 00:20:57.114
may not have material chastity.

00:20:58.406 --> 00:21:00.780
Those who have got material chastity

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.281
may not have moral chastity.

00:21:05.239 --> 00:21:07.114
Moral chastity comes first,

00:21:07.114 --> 00:21:08.531
that's very important,

00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:09.905
because it is innate.

00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:18.489
And if your moral chastity is perfectly nourished,

00:21:19.239 --> 00:21:24.738
then automatically the material chastity comes in.

00:21:25.489 --> 00:21:27.281
But the effect is the same.

00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:31.822
Whether you do money cheating in Sahaja Yoga

00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:34.239
or whether you cheat morally,

00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:35.947
your left Vishuddhi will be caught,

00:21:36.239 --> 00:21:40.114
and the whole problem will start from left Vishuddhi.

00:21:40.573 --> 00:21:44.114
Now supposing somebody tries to cheat in Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:47.030
want to take away the money of Sahaja Yoga

00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:48.239
or something like that.

00:21:48.531 --> 00:21:51.738
Immediately his left Vishuddhi will be caught.

00:21:52.156 --> 00:21:54.738
As soon as the left Vishuddhi will be caught

00:21:55.364 --> 00:21:57.281
he will start behaving in a funny manner,

00:21:57.573 --> 00:21:58.947
the whole catch will be shown.

00:21:59.364 --> 00:22:01.322
If you become immoral also

00:22:01.322 --> 00:22:03.448
the left Vishuddhi will be caught.

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:07.864
Now the whole guilt part comes from there.

00:22:08.739 --> 00:22:12.531
Sin against the Mother could be also an insult,

00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:14.780
in any way answering back to Mother.

00:22:15.072 --> 00:22:18.698
Many people have a habit, I've seen, of saying,

00:22:19.197 --> 00:22:20.197
"No, Mother."

00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:23.322
"No" is never to be said,

00:22:23.739 --> 00:22:24.989
because if you say "no"

00:22:24.989 --> 00:22:27.364
that means you go to the left Vishuddhi.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.448
The Vishnumaya power will not tolerate your "no"

00:22:32.448 --> 00:22:33.739
for anything at all.

00:22:33.739 --> 00:22:37.114
Many people have a habit of saying this, "No, Mother."

00:22:38.072 --> 00:22:39.322
This is not to be done,

00:22:39.322 --> 00:22:43.448
because once you catch your left Vishuddhi

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.364
all your left chakras become weak,

00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:50.322
because the chastity which is the basis of all the chakras

00:22:51.114 --> 00:22:52.739
is weak.

00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:55.448
So how much important it is

00:22:55.739 --> 00:23:01.364
to understand the value of left Vishuddhi.

00:23:02.072 --> 00:23:03.573
All of us catch on left Vishuddhi,

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.739
and we do not think that it is such an important thing.

00:23:07.739 --> 00:23:09.364
But we say, "Oh, left Vishuddhi catching

00:23:09.364 --> 00:23:10.448
means I'm feeling guilty."

00:23:10.448 --> 00:23:13.531
We do not understand that "What have I done?

00:23:13.531 --> 00:23:16.698
I have crossed the limits, that's why is showing there.

00:23:18.322 --> 00:23:21.239
I've neglected some kind of a morality.

00:23:21.531 --> 00:23:24.780
I've gone on a wrong path against Mother

00:23:25.072 --> 00:23:28.656
and Father, that's why left Vishuddhi's catching."

00:23:28.656 --> 00:23:33.322
Left Vishuddhi is the indication of the mistakes,

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.322
of the wrongs, of the sins.

00:23:36.656 --> 00:23:38.947
We can't afford to have left Vishuddhi,

00:23:39.322 --> 00:23:42.239
Sahaja yogis cannot afford to have left Vishuddhi.

00:23:42.531 --> 00:23:45.072
To add to the trouble, they smoke,

00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:47.072
they take all kinds of things.

00:23:48.114 --> 00:23:52.989
In India they take what you call tamakhu,

00:23:53.322 --> 00:23:57.573
is a kind of a - what leaves are these? - tobacco leaves,

00:23:57.989 --> 00:24:02.448
and they think they have done no wrong.

00:24:02.698 --> 00:24:04.739
But left Vishuddhi catches.

00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:08.947
Left Vishuddhi, in a way, is the gateway

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:13.114
to all kinds of problems for yourself,

00:24:13.656 --> 00:24:17.448
so be careful not to feel guilty about anything.

00:24:18.738 --> 00:24:21.406
Moreover it's a very vicious - great vicious circle.

00:24:21.656 --> 00:24:24.364
For example, somebody has done something wrong.

00:24:25.489 --> 00:24:30.156
I have decided that I have to tell them on their face

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:32.531
whether they like it or not, this is wrong,

00:24:32.739 --> 00:24:34.656
as far as possible. Of course,

00:24:34.656 --> 00:24:38.156
I try to play sometimes tricks on them to understand,

00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:41.656
if they do not understand My telling them - up to a point.

00:24:42.072 --> 00:24:45.656
And then I tell them that "Now you better get out.

00:24:45.656 --> 00:24:47.822
I cannot have you in My body any more."

00:24:48.156 --> 00:24:49.822
So I throw them out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:49.822 --> 00:24:51.281
Once they're out of Sahaja Yoga at least

00:24:51.573 --> 00:24:52.905
My headache is over.

00:24:53.989 --> 00:24:55.905
Now what I have seen that

00:24:56.156 --> 00:25:01.239
when this negativity starts acting, people,

00:25:01.698 --> 00:25:05.156
instead of facing it, facing the mistakes that "I am wrong,

00:25:05.156 --> 00:25:07.698
I should not have done it, it's a wrong thing to do,"

00:25:07.989 --> 00:25:09.989
start giving explanations.

00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:11.738
Once you start giving explanation,

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:18.738
this left Vishuddhi starts becoming like a bloated big lump,

00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:22.156
and then there's no possibility of curing,

00:25:22.156 --> 00:25:24.281
no possibility of cleansing.

00:25:24.614 --> 00:25:26.322
So people start giving explanation,

00:25:26.614 --> 00:25:28.738
"Why I did it, why I did this."

00:25:28.947 --> 00:25:31.406
Once it is said is wrong, is wrong;

00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:32.738
to be accepted,

00:25:32.947 --> 00:25:34.738
"All right, next time I'm not going to do it,

00:25:34.947 --> 00:25:36.864
I'm very sorry." But "sorry"

00:25:36.864 --> 00:25:40.864
seems to be a very difficult word for at least

00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:42.864
Western Sahaja yogis

00:25:42.864 --> 00:25:45.322
and some of the Indian Sahaja yogis also,

00:25:45.322 --> 00:25:47.739
to say, "Sorry, I'm very sorry."

00:25:48.072 --> 00:25:51.030
Indians never feel guilty, is a good idea,

00:25:51.322 --> 00:25:56.322
but they never say sorry, so it's just the same.

00:26:00.656 --> 00:26:02.656
Now one has to understand

00:26:02.656 --> 00:26:04.989
that when you have committed a mistake,

00:26:05.239 --> 00:26:07.780
you are a human being: to error is human

00:26:08.072 --> 00:26:09.739
and to forgive, divine.

00:26:10.072 --> 00:26:12.239
But you must know that you have erred.

00:26:12.573 --> 00:26:16.072
If you go on giving explanations then one thing is definite,

00:26:16.072 --> 00:26:18.780
you do not understand that God knows everything.

00:26:21.072 --> 00:26:24.239
If He says you have done wrong, then it is a wrong.

00:26:25.698 --> 00:26:27.448
How can you challenge, how can you say,

00:26:27.698 --> 00:26:29.489
"This is the reason I did it. That's the reason"

00:26:29.489 --> 00:26:31.739
- it's the thing one must understand.

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:34.364
Because this is the power of electricity,

00:26:34.364 --> 00:26:36.489
you must understand, gives you a shock.

00:26:37.197 --> 00:26:39.030
It shocks you.

00:26:39.656 --> 00:26:42.656
And then you realize that "I have done a mistake."

00:26:42.656 --> 00:26:45.573
So don't create a shock for yourself.

00:26:46.239 --> 00:26:47.698
Do not behave in a manner

00:26:47.698 --> 00:26:50.698
that ultimately you end up with a shock.

00:26:51.197 --> 00:26:54.239
It's - of course, the Mother's power is so forgiving,

00:26:54.698 --> 00:26:57.739
Sadashiva's power is so forgiving that you are allowed,

00:26:57.739 --> 00:26:59.739
and allowed, and allowed

00:26:59.989 --> 00:27:03.656
to continue with what you are doing, for a while.

00:27:03.864 --> 00:27:06.322
But it's been told,

00:27:06.322 --> 00:27:08.698
is explained to you that this is wrong.

00:27:09.072 --> 00:27:13.322
But supposing you cross your limits absolutely,

00:27:13.573 --> 00:27:16.197
then suddenly the Vishnumaya appears

00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:18.531
and the whole thing gets exposed.

00:27:19.739 --> 00:27:21.989
In Sahaja Yoga you get exposed.

00:27:24.573 --> 00:27:29.656
So one must know that though this power is so helpful,

00:27:30.072 --> 00:27:37.989
so guiding, so improving and nourishing and protecting,

00:27:38.364 --> 00:27:40.989
still - up to a point.

00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:44.322
Otherwise it is She only who exposes you,

00:27:47.698 --> 00:27:52.072
because She can't bear any more this nonsense from you.

00:27:53.864 --> 00:27:55.322
So if you go on like that,

00:27:55.322 --> 00:27:57.448
She'll just see to it that She is exposed.

00:27:57.738 --> 00:27:59.072
You have seen people have been doing

00:27:59.072 --> 00:28:00.531
all kinds of filthy things.

00:28:00.531 --> 00:28:02.947
I have known many prime ministers

00:28:03.197 --> 00:28:05.947
and all these presidents and this and that,

00:28:05.947 --> 00:28:08.738
when they die - exposed.

00:28:14.197 --> 00:28:17.739
Nobody says that such and such person was a chaste person.

00:28:18.614 --> 00:28:22.656
Very few leaders of nations have got this certificate

00:28:22.947 --> 00:28:25.030
that they were very chaste people.

00:28:25.406 --> 00:28:28.738
Chastity is a very, very rare certificate they get.

00:28:28.947 --> 00:28:32.947
Because once you get a power in life

00:28:33.739 --> 00:28:36.197
then you think you have a free hand,

00:28:36.489 --> 00:28:38.947
you can be and you can do what you like.

00:28:39.197 --> 00:28:41.738
You can be a chaste person,

00:28:41.947 --> 00:28:44.656
you can be any way unchaste,

00:28:44.905 --> 00:28:46.156
you can do what you like.

00:28:46.531 --> 00:28:50.656
You become sort of overpowered with this idea that

00:28:50.656 --> 00:28:54.281
"I have got all the powers, now I am very well placed."

00:28:54.656 --> 00:29:00.156
And that becomes a complete delusion for you,

00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:03.072
and you forget that chastity is so important.

00:29:03.072 --> 00:29:06.156
So the higher a person is placed in life,

00:29:06.406 --> 00:29:08.322
the higher positions he occupies,

00:29:08.614 --> 00:29:17.822
the higher what you call the ego-pampering stuff he gets,

00:29:18.072 --> 00:29:22.281
the more he presses down on the left Vishuddhi.

00:29:22.738 --> 00:29:25.822
So such a person escapes into the left Vishuddhi,

00:29:26.072 --> 00:29:28.489
because in his heart of hearts,

00:29:28.489 --> 00:29:30.739
in his unconscious he feels guilty.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.738
And the whole thing goes as a guilt,

00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:37.156
guilt in the left Vishuddhi.

00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:40.739
And when it goes as a guilt in the left Vishuddhi

00:29:41.072 --> 00:29:42.738
then it's a difficult situation,

00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:44.364
because such a person,

00:29:44.739 --> 00:29:46.489
he becomes extremely sensitive.

00:29:46.738 --> 00:29:49.406
You say anything to that person, he feels more guilty.

00:29:49.905 --> 00:29:52.531
You try to cure his left Vishuddhi,

00:29:52.531 --> 00:29:54.822
then he becomes even worse.

00:29:55.281 --> 00:29:58.197
It's a very bad situation with left Vishuddhi people,

00:29:58.531 --> 00:30:01.947
and they are the people who have left Vishuddhi

00:30:02.197 --> 00:30:03.656
always give explanations.

00:30:04.698 --> 00:30:07.406
A person who has right Vishuddhi will be arrogant,

00:30:07.698 --> 00:30:10.905
but left Vishuddhi people have a very sly method

00:30:10.905 --> 00:30:15.114
of giving answers back and explanation for everything.

00:30:15.114 --> 00:30:16.239
Whatever You say, they will say,

00:30:16.239 --> 00:30:18.364
"No, Mother, this is this, this is this."

00:30:18.364 --> 00:30:21.989
This is one thing. Not only, it doesn't end there,

00:30:22.364 --> 00:30:24.030
it gives you sarcasm.

00:30:24.738 --> 00:30:28.239
That's why in the West people never talk straightforward,

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:29.822
it's always sarcastic.

00:30:30.406 --> 00:30:33.030
To talk straightforward means they think it's stupid,

00:30:33.573 --> 00:30:34.698
is unintelligent,

00:30:34.989 --> 00:30:38.364
if unless and until you talk in a very sarcastic manner

00:30:38.698 --> 00:30:41.573
which sometimes, you know, it's difficult to reach.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.030
That's how in a very crooked way they talk.

00:30:47.489 --> 00:30:52.281
And that crookery comes through this left Vishuddhi problem.

00:30:52.281 --> 00:30:54.239
If your left Vishuddhi is so bad,

00:30:54.489 --> 00:30:59.905
you cannot achieve anything that is sweet,

00:31:00.406 --> 00:31:01.822
that is beautiful,

00:31:03.364 --> 00:31:05.030
that's appreciative.

00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:09.573
Left Vishuddhi will never appreciate.

00:31:09.989 --> 00:31:11.573
Those who suffer from left Vishuddhi

00:31:11.573 --> 00:31:13.989
can never appreciate another person, can never.

00:31:14.698 --> 00:31:16.989
It will have its own say, it will think, "I'm the best"

00:31:17.239 --> 00:31:19.281
because it has to exist,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.239
that problem has to exist, so how?

00:31:22.239 --> 00:31:25.114
It's a kind of a perverted ego

00:31:25.489 --> 00:31:26.822
that doesn't want to accept

00:31:26.822 --> 00:31:28.448
that anybody can be better than me,

00:31:28.448 --> 00:31:30.156
that anybody I have to follow,

00:31:30.406 --> 00:31:33.156
that I have to take some lessons from another one.

00:31:33.489 --> 00:31:34.738
I've had many examples;

00:31:34.738 --> 00:31:36.698
I see specially people who are with Me,

00:31:36.698 --> 00:31:39.989
I find they get into left Vishuddhi very fast

00:31:40.698 --> 00:31:43.614
because they lack in protocol.

00:31:43.614 --> 00:31:45.614
Once they start lacking in protocol

00:31:45.614 --> 00:31:47.989
they go into left Vishuddhi.

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:50.573
So to be with Me is a blessing, no doubt,

00:31:50.822 --> 00:31:54.656
but also one has to be very, very careful

00:31:54.864 --> 00:31:57.406
that you do not cross the protocols.

00:31:57.739 --> 00:32:00.656
Do not try to come over-forward,

00:32:01.197 --> 00:32:02.947
just prancing.

00:32:03.489 --> 00:32:07.989
Some people have a habit of crossing the limits,

00:32:07.989 --> 00:32:09.698
and as soon as you cross the limits

00:32:09.698 --> 00:32:11.739
left Vishuddhi is created.

00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:15.114
There should be awe for your Mother,

00:32:15.364 --> 00:32:17.030
there should be respect for your Mother,

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.780
which is guarded by left Vishuddhi.

00:32:21.989 --> 00:32:26.239
Now this is a very hidden power of Shri Ganesha.

00:32:26.489 --> 00:32:29.573
What you call is the power of Ganesha

00:32:29.573 --> 00:32:35.156
is left Vishuddhi acting like chastity.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:44.489
Ganesha's power are all expressed through left Vishuddhi.

00:32:46.322 --> 00:32:49.197
So those who believe in Ganesha, in pure innocence,

00:32:49.197 --> 00:32:52.030
must know that in your everyday-to-day behavior,

00:32:52.322 --> 00:32:55.573
in everyday-to-day action,

00:32:56.322 --> 00:32:57.780
there should be chastity.

00:32:58.114 --> 00:33:02.614
Ganesha is expressed as flowers of chastity.

00:33:03.489 --> 00:33:07.364
And just see, in the divine law if there's no chastity,

00:33:07.364 --> 00:33:09.114
how do you delimit people,

00:33:09.114 --> 00:33:11.448
how do you make all right,

00:33:11.698 --> 00:33:13.614
how do you cleanse them,

00:33:13.905 --> 00:33:15.864
how do you make them evolve?

00:33:16.197 --> 00:33:20.656
Supposing a tree is growing and there's no limit in it,

00:33:20.864 --> 00:33:23.239
it just grows like a wild thing,

00:33:23.239 --> 00:33:24.573
it has no limits,

00:33:24.573 --> 00:33:26.114
then what will you get out of it?

00:33:26.114 --> 00:33:27.322
Nothing.

00:33:27.573 --> 00:33:31.114
So to make a person higher and higher,

00:33:31.114 --> 00:33:32.780
you have to limit it.

00:33:33.364 --> 00:33:35.905
My father used to give a very good example of this,

00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:39.197
that if you take some wheat, the wheat & .

00:33:39.656 --> 00:33:41.197
(You please now don't disturb.

00:33:41.197 --> 00:33:43.197
If you want to go out you can go out,

00:33:43.448 --> 00:33:47.030
but don't disturb the people, anybody moving about.)

00:33:49.573 --> 00:33:51.489
This is also another thing is, you see.

00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:54.489
All these things are nothing but

00:33:54.489 --> 00:33:56.780
the upheaval of the left Vishuddhi.

00:33:57.322 --> 00:34:02.281
See, all this show-off or disturbing

00:34:02.738 --> 00:34:05.281
or trying to be overpowering,

00:34:05.864 --> 00:34:08.822
or very forward person or bumptiousness,

00:34:08.822 --> 00:34:11.197
all these come from left Vishuddhi,

00:34:11.197 --> 00:34:13.573
because you want to overcome your left Vishuddhi

00:34:13.573 --> 00:34:15.114
so you do it.

00:34:16.072 --> 00:34:18.114
And then this is added to it.

00:34:18.406 --> 00:34:21.739
The more you try to overcome it, the more it is added to it.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.364
Now the father's story I must tell you,

00:34:25.364 --> 00:34:26.780
that he said that

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.905
you have got the wheat and if you spread it,

00:34:30.905 --> 00:34:33.448
it just fritters away like attention does.

00:34:34.822 --> 00:34:36.780
But if you put in a gunny bag,

00:34:37.364 --> 00:34:38.364
in a bag,

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.614
you can heap it up and it can achieve a height.

00:34:44.406 --> 00:34:45.614
In the same way,

00:34:45.822 --> 00:34:48.905
if you fritter away your attention without chastity,

00:34:49.156 --> 00:34:50.738
it spreads out;

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:54.573
it has no limits, it has no forms,

00:34:54.573 --> 00:34:55.989
it had no shape.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.656
But if you delimit it,

00:34:58.573 --> 00:35:02.780
then you become higher and higher and higher,

00:35:03.072 --> 00:35:07.364
and you can rise higher in your spiritual life.

00:35:07.864 --> 00:35:12.448
As you are the people who want to lead a very spiritual life,

00:35:12.698 --> 00:35:19.573
you must understand that left Vishuddhi is to be corrected.

00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:24.531
Now, how do you correct your left Vishuddhi?

00:35:25.448 --> 00:35:27.614
I get sometimes very tired with them,

00:35:27.614 --> 00:35:29.864
really to be - I get very,

00:35:30.156 --> 00:35:32.114
I just give them up.

00:35:32.738 --> 00:35:34.573
Because if they are catching

00:35:34.573 --> 00:35:36.030
and you tell them "You are catching"

00:35:36.322 --> 00:35:38.738
they become even worse. What a vicious circle it is.

00:35:39.114 --> 00:35:40.573
What is the cure for it?

00:35:40.656 --> 00:35:44.739
How to break the vicious circle? - is by facing it.

00:35:45.656 --> 00:35:47.864
Should say, "What, you are feeling guilty for what?

00:35:47.864 --> 00:35:49.739
You're doing the same mistake again and again,

00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:51.448
and still you're doing it."

00:35:51.448 --> 00:35:57.114
You should give all injections to yourself.

00:35:57.364 --> 00:36:00.448
But instead of that they start telling Me,

00:36:00.698 --> 00:36:03.739
"No, Mother. No, Mother. No, Mother."

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:06.905
You tell yourself, "No, myself.

00:36:07.947 --> 00:36:10.864
I have done this today, tomorrow I'm going to do it,

00:36:10.864 --> 00:36:12.239
day after tomorrow I'm going to do it.

00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:16.531
Stop it now, stop." And stop at this point.

00:36:17.114 --> 00:36:20.531
There you exert your Vishnumaya power.

00:36:20.989 --> 00:36:24.573
Vishnumaya power has to be neutralized,

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:29.322
if so, by your mistakes;

00:36:29.698 --> 00:36:34.739
but if it has to be brought back into its power,

00:36:34.989 --> 00:36:36.739
you must use Vishnumaya's power

00:36:36.739 --> 00:36:39.072
by giving yourself shocks.

00:36:42.197 --> 00:36:43.864
Then only you can do it.

00:36:43.864 --> 00:36:46.573
So on that point, on the Vishnumaya point

00:36:46.573 --> 00:36:48.739
I really fail you.

00:36:49.072 --> 00:36:50.947
You have to do it.

00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:56.322
And that's why I was thinking about this puja

00:36:56.573 --> 00:37:00.072
that when you people are doing this puja to Me,

00:37:00.698 --> 00:37:04.989
if I say anything it will create more Vishnumaya in you.

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:07.739
But that's the easiest way to manage things, you see -

00:37:07.739 --> 00:37:11.947
"I am feeling guilty" - you're finished.

00:37:12.281 --> 00:37:14.739
"I have taken the punishment, I called myself guilty."

00:37:15.072 --> 00:37:18.989
It's like in the court the jury says you are guilty

00:37:18.989 --> 00:37:22.406
- all right, accept it, "I am guilty," but no punishment,

00:37:23.739 --> 00:37:24.989
take no punishment.

00:37:25.531 --> 00:37:28.322
If you have done wrong, then punish yourself.

00:37:28.614 --> 00:37:30.322
Now there are two ways people punish.

00:37:30.738 --> 00:37:33.531
One is like some people punish them

00:37:33.531 --> 00:37:36.448
by saying that "I will not have my food."

00:37:36.448 --> 00:37:39.489
But those people who have a habit of not having food

00:37:39.489 --> 00:37:42.156
and this thing, can also become aggressive

00:37:42.156 --> 00:37:44.156
with that kind of a habit to trouble others

00:37:44.156 --> 00:37:48.489
by not eating food. I mean, human beings are very crooked.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.489
They know how to kill themselves

00:37:50.489 --> 00:37:52.197
with a crooked knife all the time.

00:37:52.614 --> 00:37:54.822
So that's not the way you can correct yourself.

00:37:55.947 --> 00:37:58.072
If you have to correct yourself,

00:37:58.489 --> 00:38:02.030
then you have to face yourself in a proper way.

00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:05.905
Supposing you have done something wrong,

00:38:06.531 --> 00:38:09.656
then you should do something that

00:38:09.656 --> 00:38:11.947
you would like to do normally,

00:38:13.281 --> 00:38:14.489
and punish yourself.

00:38:14.489 --> 00:38:16.364
You should, you should, I am sorry,

00:38:16.364 --> 00:38:18.281
you should not do something

00:38:18.281 --> 00:38:20.030
that you would like to do normally.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.030
Like correcting yourself;

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:28.406
somebody is, say, very fond of the gardens, of flowers.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.281
When you do some mistake

00:38:30.281 --> 00:38:33.072
you don't see flowers for some time,

00:38:35.156 --> 00:38:37.531
just close your eyes for flowers.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.780
Now there are some people, supposing,

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.072
who are fond of singing,

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.156
so if you do mistakes then just stop singing.

00:38:55.738 --> 00:38:57.698
That's how you have to shock.

00:38:58.614 --> 00:39:01.780
You must know Vishnumaya is a lightning,

00:39:02.156 --> 00:39:04.114
and the lecture has to be like that.

00:39:04.489 --> 00:39:07.738
It cannot be that soft one, as Shri Krishna was.

00:39:08.114 --> 00:39:10.489
It's a very powerful thing I'm telling you,

00:39:10.864 --> 00:39:17.614
and may God awaken that power within you of Vishnumaya.

00:39:17.905 --> 00:39:21.905
It's the most powerful thing that a human being can have,

00:39:22.239 --> 00:39:23.864
is the most auspicious thing;

00:39:23.864 --> 00:39:26.573
you become a holy personality.

00:39:29.448 --> 00:39:33.239
This is one of the ways of getting God's realization.

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:37.364
It was a nice question aptly asked,

00:39:37.614 --> 00:39:39.156
right time yesterday,

00:39:39.448 --> 00:39:42.322
is to establish your chastity

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.614
- not by giving bandhans,

00:39:44.614 --> 00:39:47.573
taking vibrations from Mother and then getting lost,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.698
not that way: you yourself correcting yourself

00:39:50.905 --> 00:39:52.573
morning till evening,

00:39:53.656 --> 00:39:56.698
and facing yourself and not feeling guilty,

00:39:58.364 --> 00:40:00.364
and learning new things.

00:40:00.905 --> 00:40:04.364
All the time is the sister who teaches you,

00:40:04.364 --> 00:40:07.614
all the time, how to be better and better and better,

00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:08.822
not the Mother;

00:40:09.114 --> 00:40:10.989
because Mother you can say, "No, Mother."

00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:14.364
To a sister if you say - electricity,

00:40:14.614 --> 00:40:15.780
all right?

00:40:16.322 --> 00:40:20.156
Try your fingers in the plug and you will know

00:40:21.156 --> 00:40:23.197
- no explanations!

00:40:31.072 --> 00:40:33.030
With this understanding,

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.406
today we are going to do the puja

00:40:35.406 --> 00:40:38.156
for the establishment of our chastity,

00:40:38.406 --> 00:40:43.406
chastity of our emotions and chastity of our mind.

00:40:44.156 --> 00:40:45.739
Now whatever you have done so far,

00:40:45.739 --> 00:40:47.489
forget it, forget the past.

00:40:47.738 --> 00:40:50.738
That is very important also to forget the past,

00:40:50.947 --> 00:40:52.905
because you see that's a very good way of explaining,

00:40:52.905 --> 00:40:55.406
"Because I had this, that's why it has happened.

00:40:55.406 --> 00:40:58.156
My mother was like this, that, and my father was like this

00:40:58.531 --> 00:41:01.489
"Mother, father, everybody you forget now,

00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:04.614
you belong to this family, which is a holy family.

00:41:05.156 --> 00:41:08.531
People who are saints

00:41:09.947 --> 00:41:13.322
sitting here, among them you are.

00:41:14.156 --> 00:41:17.822
And automatically these laws will start working,

00:41:17.822 --> 00:41:19.614
and I will not have to tell you

00:41:19.822 --> 00:41:21.531
whether you be friendly with that person

00:41:21.531 --> 00:41:24.072
or not friendly with that person.

00:41:26.614 --> 00:41:29.656
You see, interest in another sex

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:34.364
all the time is not a sign of chastity.

00:41:35.739 --> 00:41:40.030
I mean, it's horrid, absolutely ridiculous,

00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:42.072
you become stupid.

00:41:42.739 --> 00:41:45.614
Like some men know so much about what women use,

00:41:45.822 --> 00:41:47.738
perfumes, this, that. What's the use?

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:50.197
Are you slaves of women, or what?

00:41:50.738 --> 00:41:53.531
They become experts on this nonsensical thing.

00:41:55.322 --> 00:41:57.448
You are men, live like men.

00:41:59.531 --> 00:42:02.738
And women have to have that sense of chastity

00:42:02.738 --> 00:42:05.448
within themselves, because they're the powers.

00:42:06.322 --> 00:42:09.156
Why are you wanting to become like men?

00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:11.614
I mean, you are the powers behind them.

00:42:13.072 --> 00:42:15.864
And women must look after their chastity.

00:42:16.197 --> 00:42:18.030
For that I must say,

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:23.156
I must bow to Indian women for that,

00:42:24.614 --> 00:42:25.905
the way they are humble,

00:42:26.489 --> 00:42:28.030
the way they are chaste,

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.281
one has to learn - of course there are many

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:33.738
who are not also - but the humility that they have.

00:42:35.531 --> 00:42:40.738
There's only one category which should not have humility:

00:42:42.072 --> 00:42:45.822
that is the incarnations.

00:42:46.738 --> 00:42:50.489
I cannot have humility, sorry to say.

00:42:50.905 --> 00:42:52.822
There are certain qualities you can have

00:42:52.822 --> 00:42:54.698
and enjoy and cherish, I cannot have.

00:42:54.905 --> 00:43:00.698
I cannot humble down Myself, cannot do it, I'm sorry

00:43:03.114 --> 00:43:05.156
- I'm not supposed to do it.

00:43:05.947 --> 00:43:08.364
No incarnation was humble;

00:43:08.614 --> 00:43:10.030
they cannot,

00:43:11.364 --> 00:43:13.947
because they have no guilt.

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:24.156
I have put so many guilty people in My left Vishuddhi

00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:28.281
that My ears are getting blocked trying to clear them out.

00:43:28.531 --> 00:43:30.156
If you can clear out your guilt

00:43:30.406 --> 00:43:33.614
My ears will be opened out, My trouble will go away.

00:43:33.614 --> 00:43:35.030
So please, I request you

00:43:35.281 --> 00:43:37.406
to keep your left Vishuddhi all right.

00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:40.364
Don't feel guilty, be in the center.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.281
Be in the center, watch yourself and face yourself,

00:43:44.531 --> 00:43:46.406
shock yourself, correct yourself.

00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:49.614
Only such people will ascend.

00:43:51.239 --> 00:43:53.947
Another way is meditation.

00:43:54.281 --> 00:43:55.989
With your left hand towards the photograph,

00:43:55.989 --> 00:43:58.905
with the light there, right hand on the Mother Earth,

00:43:59.698 --> 00:44:00.780
you can work it out.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.322
Put the light over here,

00:44:02.322 --> 00:44:04.156
give a bandhan to your left Vishuddhi,

00:44:04.156 --> 00:44:05.114
you can work it out.

00:44:05.114 --> 00:44:08.780
But these become rituals if you do not do it from your heart.

00:44:09.114 --> 00:44:12.780
So first of all face it, mentally face it fully,

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.489
then do it with these things.

00:44:14.489 --> 00:44:16.614
Emotionally understand it also,

00:44:16.905 --> 00:44:21.156
that the emotions you have should have no guilt in it.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.156
So for all our practical purposes

00:44:25.448 --> 00:44:29.698
we are not to use all such words which shows our guilt

00:44:29.989 --> 00:44:31.156
- but humility.

00:44:31.614 --> 00:44:34.905
Humility is very different from a guilty person.

00:44:35.156 --> 00:44:38.989
Guilty person is the person who is under duress,

00:44:39.322 --> 00:44:43.364
under pressure, but a humble person is a free person.

00:44:44.322 --> 00:44:48.239
He is humble in his own freedom, in his own exuberance.

00:44:48.322 --> 00:44:50.614
Like the trees, when they are loaded with fruit

00:44:50.614 --> 00:44:54.531
they just bow to the Mother Earth.

00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:58.072
Like, if you go to the sea,

00:44:58.072 --> 00:45:02.448
you'll find that all the trees around the sea,

00:45:02.738 --> 00:45:05.406
specially the coconut trees,

00:45:05.406 --> 00:45:08.030
all bend towards the sea

00:45:08.947 --> 00:45:11.822
because the sea has given them that speciality.

00:45:11.822 --> 00:45:15.656
The water that is in the coconut comes from the sea.

00:45:15.656 --> 00:45:20.656
So all of them have that respect,

00:45:20.947 --> 00:45:23.656
that humility towards the sea.

00:45:23.947 --> 00:45:30.197
In the same way a person who is not guilty

00:45:30.738 --> 00:45:33.406
only will be really humble,

00:45:33.656 --> 00:45:35.406
because guilty people, as I told you,

00:45:35.656 --> 00:45:39.614
are aggressive by their sarcasm, by their nasty words,

00:45:39.614 --> 00:45:42.448
by their answering back, by their explanations.

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:49.531
But a humble person is a free person,

00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:51.656
free to be humble,

00:45:52.072 --> 00:45:55.072
free to be kindly,

00:45:55.531 --> 00:45:57.739
to be gentle, to be compassionate.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:02.531
And that sort of Sahaja yogis you have to be,

00:46:02.822 --> 00:46:04.489
so that when people meet you

00:46:04.489 --> 00:46:06.072
they're impressed by your humility.

00:46:06.322 --> 00:46:10.448
But humility doesn't have any subservience

00:46:10.822 --> 00:46:13.656
- innocence and humility.

00:46:15.281 --> 00:46:18.738
I, I lack that quality completely.

00:46:19.072 --> 00:46:20.531
I cannot be humble,

00:46:20.864 --> 00:46:23.030
and you should never try to humble Me down

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.072
because that is not to be done.

00:46:25.739 --> 00:46:31.239
But nobody can say in My behavior when they meet Me

00:46:31.239 --> 00:46:33.114
that I'm not humble.

00:46:33.489 --> 00:46:36.698
I act as a very humble person.

00:46:37.448 --> 00:46:41.364
I can act as a very humble person but to be very frank,

00:46:41.614 --> 00:46:45.489
I have no humility of any kind within Me, no humility.

00:46:45.739 --> 00:46:49.030
Compassion is very different from humility.

00:46:49.364 --> 00:46:52.239
Humility is a human quality,

00:46:52.573 --> 00:46:56.448
is a special quality only the bhaktas have.

00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:00.614
Only the bhaktas have, it's such a beautiful quality

00:47:01.239 --> 00:47:04.573
of taking the showers of bliss.

00:47:05.573 --> 00:47:08.698
The one who gives bliss cannot be humble

00:47:08.698 --> 00:47:10.780
because it cannot take anything.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:14.864
It's the only human beings who are humble,

00:47:15.114 --> 00:47:18.614
and who can take it and achieve it and receive it.

00:47:18.864 --> 00:47:24.905
And the person who cannot take is so lonely, so lonely.

00:47:25.448 --> 00:47:30.614
Such a person cannot get companionship with anyone,

00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:33.489
because it has to give, and give, and give.

00:47:33.489 --> 00:47:40.030
It's so lonely, and has to face everything oneself.

00:47:40.322 --> 00:47:44.030
Those who are humble can only become friendly

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:48.489
with each other, can share their problems with each other.

00:47:48.739 --> 00:47:52.780
I cannot, because you have no solutions.

00:47:53.489 --> 00:47:55.698
I have to solve My own problem.

00:47:55.989 --> 00:48:01.030
So the humility can only help you to articulate

00:48:01.322 --> 00:48:03.322
and to have rapport with your friends,

00:48:03.573 --> 00:48:06.239
everyone, share your difficulties.

00:48:06.573 --> 00:48:09.322
But again I have to warn you because it always happens,

00:48:09.614 --> 00:48:12.780
your humility should not be sympathetic.

00:48:14.364 --> 00:48:16.905
Humility is a detached person,

00:48:16.905 --> 00:48:19.114
it's a detached quality.

00:48:19.364 --> 00:48:22.239
It's not a quality that gets attached

00:48:22.239 --> 00:48:24.239
to one person or second person.

00:48:24.989 --> 00:48:27.156
It's a humble style of life

00:48:27.156 --> 00:48:29.448
where you are not arrogant unnecessarily,

00:48:29.698 --> 00:48:31.448
you don't shout at people.

00:48:31.739 --> 00:48:35.364
But in India we say the cow

00:48:35.698 --> 00:48:37.322
is a very humble animal.

00:48:37.573 --> 00:48:39.364
It gives its milk,

00:48:40.114 --> 00:48:42.072
it provides everything,

00:48:42.322 --> 00:48:44.239
it doesn't attack anyone.

00:48:46.072 --> 00:48:49.322
So humility is such a guard for you.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.531
Of course, sometimes people take advantage of humble people,

00:48:52.739 --> 00:48:53.364
doesn't matter.

00:48:53.364 --> 00:48:55.947
As long as you have not lost your humility,

00:48:56.197 --> 00:48:57.072
everything is all right.

00:48:57.406 --> 00:48:58.905
But people lose their humility.

00:48:58.905 --> 00:49:00.406
When people try to trouble them

00:49:00.406 --> 00:49:01.947
they become left-Vishuddhites

00:49:01.947 --> 00:49:05.156
and then they lose their humility,

00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:07.656
and that's one thing one should not lose;

00:49:08.156 --> 00:49:12.030
because if you have to keep connection with the Divine

00:49:12.364 --> 00:49:14.614
then you have to be humble.

00:49:14.947 --> 00:49:16.656
There's no other way.

00:49:17.156 --> 00:49:19.281
If you are not a humble person

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:21.614
you cannot keep the relationship.

00:49:21.947 --> 00:49:25.738
See, two qualities, like a plug and the socket.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:27.905
The plug has to be the plug,

00:49:28.156 --> 00:49:30.197
the socket has to be socket.

00:49:30.197 --> 00:49:32.197
In the same way if you have to

00:49:32.489 --> 00:49:35.072
get something out of the Divine,

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.905
you have to be humble people.

00:49:36.905 --> 00:49:39.947
Through arrogance you will not get anything,

00:49:40.364 --> 00:49:43.156
through aggression you'll not get anything,

00:49:43.738 --> 00:49:46.030
through anything .& Some people also feel that

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:49.406
"I love Mother," but that love is to be expressed

00:49:49.656 --> 00:49:51.656
through complete humility.

00:49:53.738 --> 00:49:55.614
That's the only way,

00:49:55.905 --> 00:49:59.822
that's the only channel through which you can approach Me,

00:50:00.072 --> 00:50:01.905
there's no way out.

00:50:03.489 --> 00:50:11.406
So we end up today on a very high stage.

00:50:12.656 --> 00:50:15.156
It's the beginning of God's realization.

00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:17.614
But you must speed up with Me.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:20.072
It's not easy to keep speed with Me,

00:50:20.531 --> 00:50:22.364
so you have to speed up with Me.

00:50:22.364 --> 00:50:24.489
If you have to go towards God's realization,

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:30.531
first establish your sense of chastity and humility.

00:50:34.656 --> 00:50:36.738
May God bless you.
