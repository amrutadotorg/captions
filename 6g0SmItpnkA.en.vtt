00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:25.323
One has to see how Shri Ganesha acts
within us.

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:34.974
It’s very important to recognise Him,
to understand Him and to imbibe,

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:41.663
otherwise, you will be wasting all His
energies staying in this place,

00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:47.924
living in this place, so close to Him.

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:55.414
And though He is the giver of wisdom,

00:00:55.615 --> 00:01:02.261
I wonder how many people understand
the word ‘wisdom’.

00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:08.180
Wisdom is the centre of gravity within us

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:14.519
which gives us the fulcrum on which
we rotate,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.870
by which we realise that we are inclined
to the left or to the right.

00:01:24.643 --> 00:01:33.787
This fulcrum we have to be aware of,

00:01:33.988 --> 00:01:38.619
because otherwise we will not know
how far we have gone.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.698
Not only [that], but you should know
that it is so much

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.826
the centre of gravity and our fulcrum
so close to it.

00:01:54.027 --> 00:02:00.503
Because if your centre of gravity and
fulcrum are separated,

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:07.341
there’s no integration. You can be ruined,
completely.

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:17.391
So wisdom means this integration between
your understanding

00:02:17.902 --> 00:02:24.483
and the understanding of Shri Ganesha
within you.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:31.171
Going to extremes has to be corrected
in you as well, you see,

00:02:31.372 --> 00:02:35.050
because if you get successful with your
this kind of planning,

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:37.967
then you’ll go on doing this kind
of artificial planning

00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:41.227
and not the planning of the Divine.

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:47.116
The Divine has its own plans and we have
to feel the plans of the Divine.

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:51.971
It works it out. You are just an instrument
to work it out.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.865
So if you try to do something of your own,
something too much,

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:06.302
then who is going to suggest you
the balance is Shri Ganesh.

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:10.773
And that balance, once it’s established
in you,

00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:17.277
you know how you should balance yourselves
and how there is no alternative

00:03:17.478 --> 00:03:23.306
for Sahaj Yog, no alternative; one must
know.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:27.187
Everything that is living has
no alternatives.

00:03:27.388 --> 00:03:35.896
For example, if a mango tree says that,
“I will create a pomegranate,” it cannot!

00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:41.624
There’s no alternative. Whatever is there,
it has to see and enjoy;

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:44.663
but not to force its way on it.

00:03:44.864 --> 00:03:48.301
This is one of the things we have to
understand

00:03:48.502 --> 00:03:52.357
to establish our wisdom.

00:03:53.353 --> 00:04:03.425
Because of our concept, our idea,
our anything,

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:11.878
even about God for example, about
our achievements itself,

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.965
can be absolutely wrong if we have
no wisdom.

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:25.984
But in nature, if you see, those who grow

00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:30.381
are never bothered about what shape
they are going to take, do they?

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:36.988
Does a tree measure itself up to know how
many dimensions it is going to grow?

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:43.610
It grows as much as it can, slowly,
steadily,

00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:48.914
in coordination with nature it is.

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:59.566
Like that, the wisdom is the one
that understands.

00:05:01.173 --> 00:05:04.749
It is an establishment and a state
of mind, you see.

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:11.147
We can reach the state of being, when
you become wisdom.

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:20.597
Such a wisdom outside is also expressed
so beautifully.

00:05:20.798 --> 00:05:27.263
Such a wisdom gives you a gentleman
and a gentlelady

00:05:30.952 --> 00:05:37.708
only in a personality which is settled
down.

00:05:38.198 --> 00:05:42.492
If you are frustrated with a certain
problem,

00:05:42.693 --> 00:05:46.185
if you are unhappy, if you are suppressed,

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:55.754
any extreme will not allow this flower
of wisdom to grow.

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:58.740
So even in frustration you have to look
back,

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.521
you have to stand back and see
for yourself,

00:06:01.722 --> 00:06:03.675
“Why am I to be so frustrated?”

00:06:03.876 --> 00:06:11.490
Count your blessings one by one, count
your blessings one by one.

00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:17.904
I’ll say again, count your blessings
one by one.

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:19.986
Once you start counting your blessings,

00:06:20.187 --> 00:06:26.490
you will find in such a short time, where
are you.

00:06:27.864 --> 00:06:31.101
Now the extreme projections of the mind
can take you to:

00:06:31.302 --> 00:06:37.501
“I’m not going to face!”; although you
would like to do it.

00:06:42.698 --> 00:06:51.492
But in wise projection, you can see this,
that you are what you have to be.

00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:54.736
You are saints.

00:06:55.826 --> 00:07:00.990
But in possessiveness let us take the wise
path – wisdom;

00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:06.897
logically, it has to be logical: what do we
possess in this world?

00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:16.621
Just think of one thing that we can
possess.

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:20.532
Except for your own Spirit, you don’t
possess anything.

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:26.090
Except for your evolutionary development,
you don’t possess anything.

00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:29.260
For example, now you are a saint you’ll be
born a saint always –

00:07:29.461 --> 00:07:33.990
this is what you possess. The rest
you don’t possess.

00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:40.078
It’s logical, logical. You need not to be
realised to understand what I am saying.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.939
So why should people here worry about
their possessions?

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.045
When you leave this worry, this is another
wisdom,

00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:58.696
this is a higher wisdom, which you are
developing within yourself.

00:07:58.897 --> 00:08:03.680
And if we leave our possessions, our
material problems are solved.

00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:05.785
This does not mean you throw them
in the sea,

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.639
but the attachment to that.

00:08:07.823 --> 00:08:14.717
Then it is solved, already solved within
yourself.

00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:20.526
So wisdom lies in seeing yourself also.

00:08:21.052 --> 00:08:23.825
See how wisdom is so important.

00:08:24.026 --> 00:08:29.298
Throughout if you find, in every chakra
resides pranava –

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:32.246
is the life of every chakra.

00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:38.155
Because it is the wisdom that tells you
whether you are in a chakra or not.

00:08:39.347 --> 00:08:43.242
So how wisdom is [so] important that you
even become a sakshi

00:08:43.443 --> 00:08:46.704
if you have wisdom, otherwise you cannot.
You become a witness only

00:08:46.905 --> 00:08:56.149
when you have that focal point adjusted
to your centre of gravity.

00:08:58.874 --> 00:09:02.100
That is wisdom.

00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:05.977
When people tell Me about somebody
who has harmed them,

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:11.011
they paint such a dark picture of the whole
thing,

00:09:11.212 --> 00:09:18.008
as if it was the another war that was
fought.

00:09:20.169 --> 00:09:21.837
Then you go and listen to another side,

00:09:22.038 --> 00:09:27.435
they paint another horrible picture
of this side.

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:33.117
Between these two pictures you stand.

00:09:33.318 --> 00:09:38.821
You find the one is reflecting the other,
the other is reflecting the other.

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:48.902
There is no end to it, it’s eternally going
on from this to that, that to this.

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:55.069
How do you end it up?

00:09:55.836 --> 00:10:04.312
Only by your wisdom, by understanding
it’s an illusion.

00:10:04.513 --> 00:10:08.722
The main thing is the mirror on which
it is reflected,

00:10:08.923 --> 00:10:15.260
is just an illusion that is appearing, and
we are worried about it.

00:10:15.461 --> 00:10:19.798
The whole illusion will drop out as soon
as you just see the mirror

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:24.012
and don’t worry about the reflections.

00:10:26.396 --> 00:10:31.927
They’ll come and go: it is for you just
to witness it, that’s all.

00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:36.751
It's not - the mirror is a mirror, which is
a solid thing,

00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:41.074
and all the reflections are illusions.

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:52.278
That's how we miss all the sweetness
of our own being.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:03.170
Wisdom lies in understanding that you
are the Spirit.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:09.058
You are not all these illusions, you are
the Spirit, you are the Spirit.

00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:12.683
So we have to only see to our evolving
force:

00:11:12.884 --> 00:11:15.712
are we nearer it or are we out of it?

00:11:15.921 --> 00:11:23.927
Are we moving with our evolving force
or getting ourselves

00:11:24.128 --> 00:11:32.631
crucified with all these artificial
misidentifications that says that,

00:11:32.832 --> 00:11:37.250
“You are this, you are that, you are...”?
You are nothing but a seeker.

00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:40.935
It's a category, I have told many- a-times,
that you are a seeker

00:11:41.136 --> 00:11:45.913
and you have to seek. Now, what do you
seek? Is your Spirit.

00:11:46.114 --> 00:11:50.249
And once you have found it, establish
yourself on that. That’s what you are!

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:56.721
And to know that you are that Spirit itself
is so satisfying;

00:11:56.922 --> 00:12:04.341
is itself emitting wisdom in you which is
so joy giving,

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:09.341
and is nothing but love. It’s love,
I tell you.

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:11.907
I mean, I cannot go beyond this.

00:12:12.108 --> 00:12:19.540
There’s no word in human language to say
what is love.

00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:27.137
To Me it is nothing but silence,
everything stops at that point.

00:12:27.338 --> 00:12:32.119
Just feel it within yourself; where
the wisdom becomes love,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:39.523
and love becomes wisdom, that’s
the real integration of life.

00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:45.362
Open your hearts, allow Shri Ganesha

00:12:45.563 --> 00:12:51.646
to be settled in that, that innocence
which enhances everything.

00:12:51.847 --> 00:12:55.691
Look at the little ones, how they came
forward to give Me flowers:

00:12:55.892 --> 00:13:01.140
every step, every movement was so joyous,

00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:05.843
was creating such a beautiful, delicate
ripple in My heart.

00:13:06.044 --> 00:13:10.492
And it’s written as history for Me,

00:13:10.693 --> 00:13:17.559
to see these little, little sweet, innocent
Ganeshas coming forward.

00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:22.330
And the wisdom becomes so powerful,

00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:27.048
that you know the source of love
as Ganesha in you.

00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:34.234
For Him, He did not know anybody else but
one: that which is the source of love.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.232
Never questioned, never argued:
no alternatives.

00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:51.369
No new ideas came to His mind,
just taking in.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:58.180
Working it out within yourself and
the whole thing just works out.

00:13:58.381 --> 00:14:02.400
The more you enter into it, you will
understand that you have really entered

00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:06.607
into the Kingdom of God where He looks
after everything.

00:14:06.808 --> 00:14:09.474
You want a house? All right, have it!
What do you want?

00:14:09.675 --> 00:14:13.587
You want that? All right, have it. You have
a problem? Have it.

00:14:13.788 --> 00:14:17.880
It’s all God’s, the whole thing. Who owns
it but God?

00:14:18.081 --> 00:14:22.378
He is the One who owns everything and He’s
the One who enjoys everything.

00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:26.079
And He wants you to enjoy everything.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:32.488
Only through the power of wisdom that
you can achieve Me.
