00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.266
In Delhi, Sahaja Yoga is growing with a very great force.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.133
And when something starts to grow,

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.699
it should be remembered

4
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:16.333
that,

5
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.733
while it is  spreading more,

6
00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.500
its most precious aspect,

7
00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:29.133
its quality,

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.120
should not go down.

9
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.599
If its quality falls,

10
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.266
then such spreading out will not gain anything.

11
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.400
That is why the quality of Sahaja Yogis

12
00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:48.612
should remain good.

13
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.533
Now,

14
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.360
an appeal has to be made to you about one thing.

15
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:00.900
That,

16
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.733
your mother

17
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.866
has given you three things that you were

18
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.666
asking from God Almighty – those have been granted.

19
00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.913
One of them is ‘Salokhya’

20
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.166
which is,

21
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:18.966
we can see

22
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.500
God Almighty.

23
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:23.666
‘Sanidhya’

24
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.200
– that we can

25
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.000
be with God Almighty.

26
00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:31.033
Companionship.

27
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:39.933
‘Samipya’, meaning we can be close to God Almighty.

28
00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:43.933
Three things you have attained.

29
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.482
And there are many other things happening by which

30
00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:50.500
you can understand that,

31
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:51.866
I am,

32
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.366
in reality, Bhagwati.

33
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:59.999
Now a photo came from France,

34
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.999
where you can see,

35
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:07.033
there is great light right over My Heart.

36
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.599
Standing at the seashore.

37
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.866
So,

38
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.200
many such things have happened.

39
00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.866
My photos have appeared over the clouds in the sky.

40
00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:23.333
In a variety of such ways, you can prove it.

41
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.200
But,

42
00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:28.466
I have given you one more thing that is greater than all.

43
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.799
Which is called ‘Tadatyma’.

44
00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:34.799
And this is the most difficult thing. For Me also

45
00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.600
and through which this work has taken place.

46
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.866
Tadatmya means I have taken you inside My Body.

47
00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.800
You all reside in My Being.

48
00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.966
Which is why, whenever you remember Me

49
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.200
then the work gets done, everyone benefits.

50
00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.066
The moment you remember Me,

51
00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.700
that information

52
00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.033
reaches all parts of My Being.

53
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.944
That this one is in need. Like, if a finger gets

54
00:03:10.944 --> 00:03:13.333
slightly hurt, there is an injury –

55
00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.033
the whole body rushes to help the hand.

56
00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.466
So all the

57
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.100
ganas,

58
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.966
devdoots (angels) of God,

59
00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.966
they all rush to protect you.

60
00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:30.633
That you receive happiness.

61
00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:35.699
That whatever you desire should be fulfilled.

62
00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:39.399
But if you develop any shortcoming,

63
00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.066
then I have to bear it.

64
00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:46.899
Earlier, I never had bad health.

65
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.366
But now My health is worsening

66
00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:51.930
because Sahaja Yoga is spreading.

67
00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:57.266
And when it spreads, it collects some rubbish with it.

68
00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:01.066
Like yesterday, My health was really bad.

69
00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.900
That is why I had spoken about dharma at length.

70
00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:08.533
It means that we have

71
00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:10.840
not yet understood Sahaja dharma.

72
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.933
We have come into Sahaja dharma.

73
00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:17.933
Now, what is Sahaja dharma?

74
00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.233
That we have attained a special thing

75
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.266
which is to understand chaitanya (vibrations).

76
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.100
We have vibrational awareness.

77
00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:30.366
We can perceive what chaitanya is.

78
00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:32.148
And what it is saying.

79
00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.366
But the majority of people,

80
00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:38.963
by people I mean Sahaja Yogis – whenever they embark

81
00:04:38.963 --> 00:04:39.600
on something,

82
00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:43.280
they do not know vibrations, they do not recognise

83
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.427
vibrations, they do not ask the vibrations, do not

84
00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:47.600
rely on vibrations.

85
00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.400
Meaning, do not depend on vibrations.

86
00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:54.900
They continue to stick to and go as per their old ways.

87
00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.866
And that is why their behaviour becomes asahaja (anti).

88
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.900
If each and every time

89
00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:04.935
you think that, we should go by the vibrations and go

90
00:05:04.935 --> 00:05:07.472
by the indications of the vibrations,

91
00:05:08.733 --> 00:05:10.880
then you will come into Sahaja dharma.

92
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.587
And when you all come to Sahaja Dharma, then My

93
00:05:13.587 --> 00:05:15.136
troubles will recede on their own.

94
00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:19.767
Because, as soon as you get into some trouble,

95
00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:22.399
immediately My chakras start moving with great force.

96
00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:24.566
And they move with such a great force

97
00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:26.733
that I get troubled.

98
00:05:31.366 --> 00:05:33.333
Although, I do not fall sick ever – but

99
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.600
My chakras move with force.

100
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.500
And it is futile.

101
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.633
Because you have no indication of it.

102
00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:42.360
You do not even know it sometimes.

103
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.466
You cannot even benefit from it.

104
00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:45.800
Because, with your mind,

105
00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:50.400
heart, intellect and in every way,

106
00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:54.297
you should think. You should be alert as to, ‘whether

107
00:05:54.297 --> 00:05:56.166
I am in Sahaja dharma or not’.

108
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.766
Now, in Sahaja dharma, a person

109
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.733
cannot compromise with anything.

110
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.133
Because ‘I am a Sahaja dharmi’.

111
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.233
You try

112
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.900
to compromise.

113
00:06:10.466 --> 00:06:12.766
You will face trouble and I will be troubled also.

114
00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:18.751
‘Now what can we do, Mother? This needs some

115
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:22.033
compromise’. So then, I have to bear it. What can I do?

116
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.666
In so many affairs, the Sahaja way is not understood.

117
00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:32.066
Like,

118
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.566
one gentleman said yesterday that

119
00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:37.720
to print Nirmala Yoga here.

120
00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:41.853
You please get this machine and that machine.

121
00:06:43.766 --> 00:06:45.800
So I said at first, ‘Alright. Get it’.

122
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.400
Because, not to displease anyone.

123
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.933
Because just

124
00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:54.066
saying no outright would have worsened the situation.

125
00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:58.133
But there is a gentleman I know, who is a printer

126
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.300
and he was asked to come today morning.

127
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.166
Because, as per the vibrations, it did not feel alright.

128
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.614
So I thought that telling them outright would hurt

129
00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:09.700
their feelings. But based on the vibrations it seemed

130
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.100
nothing was required. Alright. Called him.

131
00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:15.590
Talked to the printer and he said, ‘Every three

132
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.466
months you are coming out with a small newsletter.

133
00:07:19.464 --> 00:07:22.900
What is the necessity to spend so much money on it?’

134
00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:24.400
He laughed at it.

135
00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:28.519
He told him, ‘Even a person who writes books upon

136
00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:31.737
books will not invest so much, then why are you

137
00:07:31.737 --> 00:07:33.950
spending on such a small thing?’

138
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.873
I said I felt the same and so I thought I should ask

139
00:07:38.873 --> 00:07:41.993
you. He said, ‘My friend has a printing outfit and he

140
00:07:41.993 --> 00:07:44.941
will give you half price for whatever you need. He

141
00:07:44.941 --> 00:07:48.004
has one machine better than another. And if you want

142
00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:51.009
to print a small book, once in three months, and if

143
00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.014
you want to buy an entire printing house – what can

144
00:07:54.014 --> 00:07:56.500
be said about that?’ So this is not Sahaja.

145
00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:02.233
If I say it outright that, don’t do this,

146
00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:03.866
then there will be hurt feelings.

147
00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:06.033
And if I

148
00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:09.876
say it after some time, then they say

149
00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:12.933
somebody has poisoned Mother’s ears.

150
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.733
Someone said something.

151
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.966
This is very common.

152
00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:21.266
The one who can poison Me has not been born till now

153
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.333
(yogis laugh).

154
00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:30.233
No one can influence Me. I am innocent.

155
00:08:30.766 --> 00:08:32.100
But I am not so innocent

156
00:08:33.733 --> 00:08:35.989
that anyone can sway Me. Because the big difference

157
00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:38.288
between you and Me is that, within Me, there is only

158
00:08:38.288 --> 00:08:39.633
Sahaja dharma and nothing else.

159
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.199
I go only by Sahaja dharma.

160
00:08:44.833 --> 00:08:45.599
One gentleman –

161
00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:48.200
I do not remember if I told

162
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.340
you this the last time or not.

163
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.800
In Rahuri, some big,

164
00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:54.916
what we call the ‘Barabai karasthan’ [name of a

165
00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:56.668
secret alliance in Maharashtra history] came over.

166
00:08:56.668 --> 00:08:57.700
They started to explain to Me.

167
00:08:58.133 --> 00:08:59.833
That this person, who you think

168
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:01.833
so highly of, is into politics.

169
00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:04.228
And he is here for political reasons. And

170
00:09:04.228 --> 00:09:05.920
you better be careful about him.

171
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.800
And we have come to make You understand’.

172
00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:12.782
I said, ‘Alright. Anything else about him?’ ‘No

173
00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:15.340
Mother. He is a politician. He will try to influence

174
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.366
you. ‘Is that right? He will influence Me?

175
00:09:18.466 --> 00:09:19.266
Is that all you know?’

176
00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:19.966
Said, ‘Yes.

177
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.962
Do not listen to anything he says. He is highly

178
00:09:23.962 --> 00:09:26.066
political.’ I said, ‘Now, can I tell you?

179
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.590
This man’s wife is not his real wife. She is the wife

180
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.017
of some brahmin. He has eloped with her. Because the

181
00:09:34.017 --> 00:09:37.443
child that was born to her is not even his child. It

182
00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:40.934
is the brahmin’s child. And he eloped with her and is

183
00:09:40.934 --> 00:09:44.037
living with her.’ Told them a multitude of such

184
00:09:44.037 --> 00:09:46.300
things and their faces just changed

185
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.399
(yogis laugh).

186
00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:53.966
And they said, ‘Mother, you know all this about him?’

187
00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:57.520
I said, ‘Yes. I know all of this. Please remove it.

188
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.410
It's very cold.

189
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.933
Here, some…

190
00:10:01.866 --> 00:10:04.133
Yes, please put on the shawl.

191
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.780
Now, this is also an example of a sahaja thing. If

192
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.860
you keep a cushion there, anyone can climb over it

193
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.533
and then the whole thing will get pulled.

194
00:10:15.666 --> 00:10:17.902
Now on a hot day, if someone keeps silk down there,

195
00:10:17.902 --> 00:10:19.192
then it’s all gone for a toss.

196
00:10:21.366 --> 00:10:22.966
You all are sitting comfortably. And by seating

197
00:10:22.966 --> 00:10:24.433
Me on this silk. you are cooling Me

198
00:10:24.433 --> 00:10:25.899
[yogis laugh].

199
00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:33.233
You are comfortable and have seated Me on this silk.

200
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.191
It’s alright now. I am joking. No, no, I have no

201
00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:39.166
problem like that. I am just joking.

202
00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:42.199
No, no, I am fine.

203
00:10:44.433 --> 00:10:45.033
Now this

204
00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:46.066
is about Sahaja.

205
00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:50.093
It is about being Sahaja.

206
00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:53.099
Now, if someone does it the Sahaja way, then the work

207
00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:57.366
is so well integrated, so beautifully done that

208
00:10:57.366 --> 00:11:00.133
I immediately understand who has done it.

209
00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:05.000
Racing the horses of mind leads to a mess.

210
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:07.466
That’s one thing.

211
00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:11.033
Second, we feel that we are Sahaja Yogis,

212
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.066
so we can do anything that we want.

213
00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:15.300
No, that is not the case.

214
00:11:16.866 --> 00:11:18.133
You cannot do whatever you want.

215
00:11:19.866 --> 00:11:23.013
Now, in  My house, there are so many accountants.

216
00:11:23.013 --> 00:11:25.933
There are so many who have learnt accounting and

217
00:11:25.933 --> 00:11:28.299
I do not know a word of accounting.

218
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.133
And, in My house, there are so many lawyers that

219
00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:33.733
I do not know at all what human laws are.

220
00:11:34.533 --> 00:11:35.166
Never.

221
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.999
But the day before, Gagan brought over someone,

222
00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:44.299
and I said to him you have made this mistake here.

223
00:11:44.633 --> 00:11:46.147
He said, “Mother, I forgot to write it here” and I said

224
00:11:46.147 --> 00:11:46.966
that it was alright.

225
00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:48.766
Then he was astonished.

226
00:11:49.633 --> 00:11:50.499
How did I know?

227
00:11:50.766 --> 00:11:51.833
‘Mother, how do you know this?

228
00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:53.073
You do not know accounts.’

229
00:11:53.466 --> 00:11:53.966
Vibrations!

230
00:11:55.233 --> 00:11:56.900
Immediately My attention went there,

231
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.066
the vibrations were not right over there.

232
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.200
Because the one who is in Sahaja –

233
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.466
he keeps getting all the information

234
00:12:02.966 --> 00:12:04.199
from a humongous

235
00:12:05.233 --> 00:12:06.800
organisation.

236
00:12:07.099 --> 00:12:08.800
This is wrong; this is right; this is alright; this

237
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.166
is bad. This is nice, etc.

238
00:12:10.733 --> 00:12:11.366
Instantly.

239
00:12:11.933 --> 00:12:13.996
For Me, there is no need to think. My computer is

240
00:12:13.996 --> 00:12:16.100
such that it is instantaneous, at that very moment.

241
00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:20.659
Now, whether I show it or not, that is My astuteness

242
00:12:20.659 --> 00:12:21.529
[yogis laugh].

243
00:12:21.529 --> 00:12:23.533
But I know everything.

244
00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:30.621
And all of you come into Sahaja Yoga. Then you will

245
00:12:30.621 --> 00:12:32.666
benefit and I will also benefit.

246
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.500
In everything, one should be sahaja.

247
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.066
And to be sahaja,

248
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.033
we must remember that we have now been reborn.

249
00:12:46.833 --> 00:12:52.266
And that we have come into this like an infant.

250
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.416
There is still a lot to be learnt. And whatever is

251
00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:58.080
the Sahaja marg (path/road) by which Mother takes us,

252
00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.314
we will only follow that.

253
00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:03.433
We are making a lot of mistakes.

254
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.449
And mistakes will be made. If you do not make

255
00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:08.433
mistakes, then what is the point of My coming?

256
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.466
But we must admit that we are making mistakes.

257
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.933
And as much as possible, make use of vibrations.

258
00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:20.599
Like, there is now one gentleman.

259
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.833
He had a fight with his wife.

260
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:23.733
Suppose

261
00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:26.499
So I said, ‘Have you checked the vibrations?’

262
00:13:26.499 --> 00:13:27.400
He said no.

263
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.766
So I said, ‘Alright’.

264
00:13:30.433 --> 00:13:32.099
Suppose someone tells you

265
00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:40.500
Suppose

266
00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:42.733
someone tells you

267
00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:04.043
Suppose someone tells you that, ‘Sir, your wife is

268
00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.725
very bad’, and you accept; it means you accept

269
00:14:06.725 --> 00:14:09.521
hearsay. See your vibrations. Even if you accept

270
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:11.633
hearsay but be sound with vibrations.

271
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.633
Now suppose I tell you that

272
00:14:19.299 --> 00:14:21.466
I cannot come tomorrow.

273
00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:23.366
‘No, you have to come’.

274
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.600
Then the one who insisted will

275
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.566
himself not reach on time.

276
00:14:30.233 --> 00:14:31.933
There will be some problems in his house.

277
00:14:32.733 --> 00:14:36.733
Because I can see – forward, back, up, down – everything.

278
00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:40.433
So there should be no coercion.

279
00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:46.607
Like yesterday, I had not called anyone to My house.

280
00:14:46.607 --> 00:14:47.699
I said come over.

281
00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:50.333
But I did not say I would meet with anyone.

282
00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:51.233
Not with anyone.

283
00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:53.233
I had just one girl [to meet]

284
00:14:54.433 --> 00:14:57.300
but not anyone else. I said come over.

285
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.633
There may be some

286
00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:02.133
fuss about what I said.

287
00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:03.633
I had said to come over.

288
00:15:05.099 --> 00:15:06.266
But by no means, it meant

289
00:15:07.066 --> 00:15:08.366
that you would find Me or

290
00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:10.800
I would meet you or hug You. That I

291
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.533
would sit and chat with you. Who has this leisure?

292
00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:19.066
‘Come over’ means you may come and meditate there.

293
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.033
It does not mean anything else.

294
00:15:27.033 --> 00:15:29.843
‘Oh, we were sitting there waiting for You.’ But why

295
00:15:29.843 --> 00:15:32.866
did you keep waiting? They could have meditated and left.

296
00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:38.266
Even Warren got a fright from the Delhiwallas.

297
00:15:39.966 --> 00:15:41.433
He is running back to Maharashtra.

298
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.966
Better catch his tail or he will escape.

299
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.766
He has been telling Me from the start

300
00:15:48.766 --> 00:15:49.999
– I am saying this plainly

301
00:15:50.633 --> 00:15:51.866
– he is saying that, in Maharashtra,

302
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.533
ten thousand people will pass in front of You.

303
00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:57.433
Not one will touch Your Feet;

304
00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:01.399
only offer a flower at Your Feet.

305
00:16:04.966 --> 00:16:05.899
If they come to meet anytime

306
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.100
– say, someplace, sometimes it can happen

307
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:08.633
[Mother says], ‘Come over’

308
00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:11.766
so there, I have a small flat.

309
00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:15.133
All of them cannot sit inside.

310
00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:17.033
Then they remain seated on the

311
00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:18.099
lawn outside and return from there.

312
00:16:18.633 --> 00:16:20.199
But they will never say,

313
00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:23.245
‘You should arrange a meeting, you never let me meet,

314
00:16:23.245 --> 00:16:26.133
you have to arrange a meeting. I had come to meet Her.

315
00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:28.300
Why does Mataji not see us? Not like this.

316
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.199
Not like that.’

317
00:16:31.566 --> 00:16:33.699
Because, in sahaja feeling, we know that

318
00:16:34.166 --> 00:16:37.066
we have no right over Mother’s time.

319
00:16:38.199 --> 00:16:39.999
No one in this universe has the right.

320
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.933
That is correct.

321
00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:52.266
Now,  the first time I was in Delhi,

322
00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:56.533
I saw that some sindoor was kept in a plastic container.

323
00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:59.800
And they got a plastic mug from

324
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.233
some bathroom to wash My Feet.

325
00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:04.933
And a plastic

326
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.799
container for My feet.

327
00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:12.000
Now I, if you have seen My photo from that time,

328
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.266
I had a fright. ‘Oh God, I wonder what trouble

329
00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:15.536
they are going to get now’.

330
00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:17.233
Slowly, slowly

331
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.415
the sahaja protocol came into being that no,

332
00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:20.133
this is not the way;

333
00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:21.033
this is the way.

334
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.733
In the same way, now, with Sahaja

335
00:17:24.733 --> 00:17:26.333
gravity, it should be taken to heart.

336
00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:30.735
It was why, yesterday, [I] spoke about sahaja dharma,

337
00:17:30.735 --> 00:17:31.833
that you love Me,

338
00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:32.466
I know.

339
00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:33.700
Too much love.

340
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.266
And that you have faith in Me.

341
00:17:38.033 --> 00:17:39.110
That also I know.

342
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:40.366
You

343
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:45.433
feel like giving everything you have to Mother;

344
00:17:45.433 --> 00:17:46.533
that also I know.

345
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.962
I know it all.

346
00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:50.966
That you love Me very much.

347
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.633
But this devotion has to be brought into practice.

348
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And practice?

349
00:17:58.533 --> 00:17:59.171
What has Mother to do with it?

350
00:18:00.899 --> 00:18:02.766
You give something to Mother or not;

351
00:18:03.533 --> 00:18:04.934
it makes no difference to Mother.

352
00:18:07.366 --> 00:18:09.766
How much of a Sahaja Yogi are we becoming?

353
00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:12.666
How much of Sahaja dharma is growing within us?

354
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:14.979
How much of the Sahaja attitude do we adopt in life?

355
00:18:14.979 --> 00:18:15.466
That should be observed.

356
00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:19.646
In the Sahaja buddhi (intellect), first of all, there

357
00:18:19.646 --> 00:18:21.066
should be ‘nirapekshita’ (no expectation, detachment).

358
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.466
Nirapekshita means this –

359
00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:28.000
‘Sir, my house, my wife, my children.

360
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.733
My ashram.

361
00:18:30.466 --> 00:18:31.733
Or my centre.

362
00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:36.099
‘Mother, you must come to My centre.’

363
00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:37.433
Before that, ‘Come to my house’;

364
00:18:37.433 --> 00:18:38.733
this used to happen very frequently.

365
00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:41.734
Now tell Me, if I go on visiting everyone’s homes,

366
00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:43.099
then what remains of Me?

367
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.966
‘Alright, if not at home, please come to the centre.’

368
00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:50.766
Now going to the centre is also not so simple.

369
00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:54.666
‘Alright. If not the centre, can you at least come

370
00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:57.620
to the street corner over there?’

371
00:18:57.899 --> 00:19:00.899
[yogis laugh].

372
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:02.400
Why?

373
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.233
Because people see that,

374
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.133
means everyone comes to know that

375
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.760
– It is ‘I’. ‘I’ was the one who called Mataji and

376
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.899
She came over to the street corner.

377
00:19:12.899 --> 00:19:14.499
This is the subtle thing.

378
00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:19.226
The subtlety here is – ‘I’ told Mother, and Mother

379
00:19:19.226 --> 00:19:22.166
came. Mother believes ‘me’ and so you should all

380
00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:23.366
believes me as well.

381
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.999
That is its subtle thing.

382
00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:34.633
When this is understood –

383
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.396
that I am there for Mother, my house is for Mother,

384
00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:40.899
everything is for Mother only

385
00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:43.766
– then Mother may or may not come.

386
00:19:45.433 --> 00:19:47.846
Does anyone invite themselves into their own house?

387
00:19:47.846 --> 00:19:50.866
Like, I am inviting Myself into My home.

388
00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:53.520
‘Its Your home’ – then why do you invite Me?

389
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.266
And if all your money is Mine, then why do you give it?

390
00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:04.933
Speaking in

391
00:20:05.566 --> 00:20:07.199
everyday terms, if

392
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.291
I say I am going to gift My kada (bangle) to Myself,

393
00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:11.610
you will say how is that even possible?

394
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.978
Or if I invite Myself to My house [you will say],

395
00:20:16.978 --> 00:20:18.466
‘Did you fight with Your husband?’

396
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.303
In the same way, in expressing sahaja, one must not

397
00:20:25.303 --> 00:20:28.307
think that this is my house, these are my children.

398
00:20:28.307 --> 00:20:31.600
They are all Mother’s. So wherever Mother is, it is Hers.

399
00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:40.066
And then I put you into confusion;

400
00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:41.166
that is another problem.

401
00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:44.998
And then they say, ‘Mother, we don’t know what

402
00:20:44.998 --> 00:20:46.699
happened. We went there with so much affection.’

403
00:20:46.699 --> 00:20:48.466
Alright. But bring it into behaviour.

404
00:20:48.466 --> 00:20:49.966
That should be understood.

405
00:20:50.533 --> 00:20:54.199
In Sahaja Yoga, the first thing is nirapekshita.

406
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.266
The habit of being bound should start going away.

407
00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:00.633
For some it may be, ‘My wife;

408
00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:04.000
this [problem] of my wife should be made alright.’

409
00:21:04.633 --> 00:21:06.166
That should be detached immediately.

410
00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.833
One should be very attentive towards one’s own self.

411
00:21:11.066 --> 00:21:11.933
You may very well think,

412
00:21:13.766 --> 00:21:14.500
‘My son,

413
00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:17.066
he should go to Mother’.

414
00:21:17.766 --> 00:21:18.766
First, cut it out.

415
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.699
Your son will be completely alright.

416
00:21:21.499 --> 00:21:23.500
Detachment is the solution to everything;

417
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.100
you will be surprised.

418
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.960
Yesterday someone had come. She was saying, ‘Mother,

419
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.507
I had paralysis. I had this sickness, that sickness.’

420
00:21:35.507 --> 00:21:37.866
I could even remember her face. Had met only once.

421
00:21:38.633 --> 00:21:39.899
And she is now in first-class condition.

422
00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:43.099
She started saying, ‘I just used to sit with the photo.

423
00:21:43.866 --> 00:21:44.400
And

424
00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.633
my faith in that did the rest’.

425
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.800
What happens is that when you take the

426
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.300
photo and work hard with it,

427
00:21:51.666 --> 00:21:53.733
then you have to increase your faith.

428
00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:56.466
Because I am not in front [of you].

429
00:21:57.633 --> 00:22:00.564
You have to increase your faith, increase your depth.

430
00:22:00.564 --> 00:22:02.300
And when you reach the depth,

431
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.766
that is when you get results.

432
00:22:06.866 --> 00:22:09.133
That is why, those who have got their self-realisation

433
00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:11.233
using the photo, they are sometimes much more

434
00:22:11.233 --> 00:22:13.333
[in quality] than those who are right now in front of Me.

435
00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:15.499
It is quite surprising.

436
00:22:17.233 --> 00:22:18.733
Or sometimes I see if Modi has

437
00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:19.833
given Self-realisation to someone -

438
00:22:20.466 --> 00:22:22.800
they do a lot to serve Me compared to

439
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.266
those whom I gave Self-realisation directly.

440
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.173
Because he has already drilled into them – this is

441
00:22:28.173 --> 00:22:30.499
Mother, you should understand it. She is Mahamaya.

442
00:22:31.566 --> 00:22:33.300
Do not come under Her illusion.

443
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.866
Observe all protocols with Her.

444
00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:37.066
He explains it to them.

445
00:22:38.433 --> 00:22:40.566
But, if I give realisation to

446
00:22:40.566 --> 00:22:42.599
someone directly, they sit on My Head.

447
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.733
Then, ‘I had come.

448
00:22:45.733 --> 00:22:47.410
I had especially come to meet You.’ Who told you to

449
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.120
come especially? What kind of an especial person are

450
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.830
you? Why did you come?

451
00:22:54.266 --> 00:22:55.599
So this ‘I’ness

452
00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:57.833
has to reduce.

453
00:22:58.233 --> 00:22:59.500
‘Me’, ‘mine’.

454
00:23:00.033 --> 00:23:01.799
That should be finished.

455
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.166
Just like Kabirdas has said so beautifully,

456
00:23:06.533 --> 00:23:08.766
that when a goat roams about,

457
00:23:09.666 --> 00:23:10.499
alive,

458
00:23:10.833 --> 00:23:11.733
she keeps saying [bleats],

459
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.433
‘mein, mein, mein’, ‘mein’.

460
00:23:15.466 --> 00:23:17.398
All this which we say, what he meant was this ‘mein’,

461
00:23:17.398 --> 00:23:19.257
‘mein’ [‘me’ is pronounced ‘mein’ in Hindi] – means

462
00:23:19.257 --> 00:23:21.233
we are all goats. ‘Mein, mein, mein, mein’.

463
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.200
But when she loses her goat form,

464
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.666
meaning when the goat dies.

465
00:23:27.366 --> 00:23:30.247
Her intestines are pulled out, washed, and dried.

466
00:23:30.247 --> 00:23:32.898
When they go on the road, pulling the strings

467
00:23:32.898 --> 00:23:35.952
[intestines made into a one-string instrument], then

468
00:23:35.952 --> 00:23:37.899
it says, ‘tuhi, tuhi, tuhi’ (only you).

469
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.333
What a marvellous concept.

470
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.838
He was a ‘julahe’ (weaver) and how he could see God

471
00:23:43.838 --> 00:23:45.333
Almighty in all his things.

472
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.899
He would  say, ‘tuhi, tuhi, tuhi’.

473
00:23:49.333 --> 00:23:50.800
This idea will not enter our heads.

474
00:23:52.566 --> 00:23:55.202
So, when you become nirapeksha, then in everything

475
00:23:55.202 --> 00:23:57.837
you will see only Him, you will know only Him, you

476
00:23:57.837 --> 00:24:00.524
will understand only Him. And it will be surprising

477
00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:02.333
how, from all directions, it is all

478
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:04.899
coming together.

479
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.466
How this matter is coming together.

480
00:24:08.266 --> 00:24:10.766
Like, one girl arranged flowers for Me,

481
00:24:10.933 --> 00:24:11.866
on the ground.

482
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.674
She said, ‘Mother, look, I have made Ganeshji. I just

483
00:24:15.674 --> 00:24:17.833
arranged it, how did Ganeshji get formed?’

484
00:24:18.366 --> 00:24:20.433
He guided your heart, your hand in

485
00:24:20.433 --> 00:24:22.299
the way needed to make Ganeshji.

486
00:24:22.933 --> 00:24:25.399
Which is very dear to Me.

487
00:24:29.966 --> 00:24:32.400
Just that was made, the one that is

488
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.433
dearest [to Me], she made that.

489
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.378
Because she had a surrendered heart, it [flower

490
00:24:37.378 --> 00:24:38.999
arrangement] became Ganeshji all on its own.

491
00:24:39.466 --> 00:24:41.160
The moment I saw it, I was in tears.

492
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.166
‘How did you make My Shri Ganesh?’

493
00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:50.402
So we must keep the example of Shri Ganesh in front

494
00:24:50.402 --> 00:24:53.575
of us. Just like His devotion, so are His actions.

495
00:24:54.533 --> 00:24:56.533
One must follow the dharma of Shri Ganesha.

496
00:24:56.833 --> 00:24:58.800
For him, ‘tuhi, tuhi, tuhi’; besides

497
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.366
that nothing else matters.

498
00:25:05.966 --> 00:25:07.899
He is ready on one leg.

499
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.299
No need to say anything.

500
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.323
No need to even desire.

501
00:25:15.323 --> 00:25:17.440
Someone just says something and He is gone after it,

502
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.333
all the ganas running after Him and resolved it.

503
00:25:21.833 --> 00:25:24.154
And if you are useless, then He is also standing with

504
00:25:24.154 --> 00:25:26.346
the ‘parash’ (axe) in the other hand. Will fix it.

505
00:25:26.346 --> 00:25:27.999
Why did they go and say such a thing to Mother?

506
00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:33.978
Keeping [the ideal] of such Ganeshji in front of you,

507
00:25:33.978 --> 00:25:36.333
you should also get into Sahaja dharma.

508
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.100
By coming into Sahaja dharma,

509
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.666
you will experience such peace within.

510
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.867
Because with Sahaja dharma all the insecurity

511
00:25:45.867 --> 00:25:49.168
that is inside, insecurities – they just are

512
00:25:49.168 --> 00:25:53.057
finished. We are playing in the lap of God Almighty;

513
00:25:53.057 --> 00:25:56.652
what do we care? Insecurity or anything else. So

514
00:25:56.652 --> 00:25:58.966
there is security, complete security.

515
00:26:03.466 --> 00:26:07.033
In a Sahaja person, that is a different type of

516
00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:13.202
attitude and we have to accept that attitude.

517
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.535
Stubbornness goes away, speech changes, natures

518
00:26:17.535 --> 00:26:20.905
change. Diamonds have to be chiselled out. Sahaja

519
00:26:20.905 --> 00:26:24.544
Yogis are themselves diamonds – as the diamond of the

520
00:26:24.544 --> 00:26:28.184
Spirit within comes forward – the diamond’s different

521
00:26:28.184 --> 00:26:31.554
facets appear by themselves. And as I watch it, I

522
00:26:31.554 --> 00:26:35.126
keep feeling happier, ‘Splendid. How this diamond is

523
00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:35.733
shining.’

524
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.834
Be alert to oneself and remain in Sahaja expression

525
00:26:44.834 --> 00:26:48.437
and Sahaja dharma. I am Sahaja dharmi. One gentleman

526
00:26:48.437 --> 00:26:51.565
started saying, ‘Mother, I am Sahaja dharmi.’

527
00:26:51.565 --> 00:26:55.100
‘Alright? What do you do?’ ‘I worship you every day.

528
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.649
Offer flowers. Etc.’ Later found out that the police

529
00:26:59.649 --> 00:27:02.986
arrested him. [yogis laugh]. Great. What kind of

530
00:27:02.986 --> 00:27:06.119
Sahaja dharma were you following? Then came a

531
00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:09.729
message, ‘Tell Mother, that the police have arrested

532
00:27:09.729 --> 00:27:12.930
me.’ ‘So what did you do?’ All types of asahaj

533
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:16.540
things. Not one or two. Where could I go to save him?

534
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.033
And why save him?

535
00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:23.766
In the same way,

536
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.500
Sahaja Yogis think they are Sahaja Yogis.

537
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.910
But yoga has to be of two types – bhakti and karma.

538
00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.110
Unless and until there is a yoga of bhakti and karma,

539
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.014
you will not settle into Sahaja dharma. And only

540
00:27:38.014 --> 00:27:39.970
after settling into Sahaja dharma

541
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.496
will you be established into the guru tattva. The one

542
00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:47.733
who is not alright, how can they lecture others?

543
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:51.948
Specially in the matter of money, I see that

544
00:27:51.948 --> 00:27:56.046
Delhiwallas have a peculiar condition. Just do not

545
00:27:56.046 --> 00:28:00.063
stick to money and money will come and touch your

546
00:28:00.063 --> 00:28:04.241
feet, I tell you. This I tell you is the first key.

547
00:28:04.241 --> 00:28:08.259
Now I do not understand money. It is the truth, I

548
00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:12.115
tell you. When I have to go to the bank, I take

549
00:28:12.115 --> 00:28:15.410
someone with Me – Warren or someone else.

550
00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:19.670
Rajesh or someone. I will just sign, that’s all. But

551
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.951
you have to fill in the cheque. It’s true I tell you.

552
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:26.110
I still do not know how to write out a cheque. I do

553
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.933
not know why I go to the bank.

554
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.033
But, because there is nirapekshita in it.

555
00:28:37.566 --> 00:28:39.560
And who keeps track of the accounts and balances? Now

556
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.295
Mr Modi was saying, Mother, don’t know what is

557
00:28:41.295 --> 00:28:43.251
happening. The account is not balanced – there is an

558
00:28:43.251 --> 00:28:45.244
extra thirteen, fourteen thousand in it. I said, ‘Let

559
00:28:45.244 --> 00:28:46.499
it be. God has given it. Leave it.

560
00:28:51.533 --> 00:28:53.799
Now that God has provided the fourteen thousand

561
00:28:53.799 --> 00:28:56.255
extra, let it be. They will be required somewhere.’

562
00:28:56.255 --> 00:28:57.199
What is there in it?

563
00:29:02.733 --> 00:29:05.454
Nirapeksh. Nirapekshita means just that we have left

564
00:29:05.454 --> 00:29:08.073
everything to God Almighty. ‘Jaise rakhau taise hi

565
00:29:08.073 --> 00:29:10.999
rahu’ (The state you keep me in, I will abide). Leave it.

566
00:29:12.566 --> 00:29:17.606
In this Sahaja dharma one must be settled. You should

567
00:29:17.606 --> 00:29:22.366
leave money worries or any other worry. Just bring

568
00:29:22.366 --> 00:29:24.699
your actions into Sahaja.

569
00:29:26.766 --> 00:29:30.228
The man who says, ‘Mother, I am in great distress’;

570
00:29:30.228 --> 00:29:33.556
that man is not Sahaja. Cannot be Sahaja. ‘I have

571
00:29:33.556 --> 00:29:37.151
this trouble, I have that trouble.’ Day and night, ‘I

572
00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:40.679
have this trouble, I have that trouble. I don’t have

573
00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:44.274
a house. I have a house but don’t have a wife. I have

574
00:29:44.274 --> 00:29:47.736
a wife, but the children’….etc. Anytime you meet he

575
00:29:47.736 --> 00:29:51.131
has some problem. But that should not be the case.

576
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:54.726
The one who is Sahaja is, ‘How are you?’ ‘How are you

577
00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:58.254
meaning? I am swimming in the sea.’ ‘What sea?’ ‘The

578
00:29:58.254 --> 00:30:01.449
sea of bliss, what are you asking?’ That is the

579
00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:04.778
thing. Is it not? That is the law. Or the one who

580
00:30:04.778 --> 00:30:08.239
keeps complaining of troubles all the time – in the

581
00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:11.834
end, he will be trapped in such a problem that no one

582
00:30:11.834 --> 00:30:12.700
can help him.

583
00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:19.397
Specially, Indians have this practice that if someone

584
00:30:19.397 --> 00:30:22.312
asks, ‘How are you?’ ‘I am fine’. ‘How is

585
00:30:22.312 --> 00:30:25.920
everything?’, ‘Let my enemies be in a bad way, I am

586
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.251
well’. Although he may have cancer. He may have

587
00:30:29.251 --> 00:30:32.721
cancer but he will never say I have this trouble.

588
00:30:32.721 --> 00:30:35.566
This is our Hindustani, Bhartiya culture.

589
00:30:38.366 --> 00:30:41.576
‘Oh, I heard your child is not well’. ‘I have ten

590
00:30:41.576 --> 00:30:44.849
children, one or other may fall sick. What’s great

591
00:30:44.849 --> 00:30:47.738
about that?’ This is the Hindustani way. And

592
00:30:47.738 --> 00:30:51.140
‘problem’ is also a modern word. Earlier we knew the

593
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.414
word ‘problem’ when studying Geometry only. [yogis

594
00:30:54.414 --> 00:30:55.826
laugh] No, it is true.

595
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:10.259
Now, ‘I have this problem, I have that problem’ is a

596
00:31:10.259 --> 00:31:16.089
common thing. I am old now, but in our time no one

597
00:31:16.089 --> 00:31:18.833
used the word ‘problem’.

598
00:31:22.466 --> 00:31:26.163
That, ‘I have this problem’. We used the word

599
00:31:26.163 --> 00:31:30.020
‘problem’ in Geometry only. And when we learned

600
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.198
Geometry in Marathi, when everything was proved, it

601
00:31:34.198 --> 00:31:37.975
was ‘iti siddham’ (it is proved). Proved. That

602
00:31:37.975 --> 00:31:41.912
problem is solved. Or people would fail you. Now

603
00:31:41.912 --> 00:31:46.011
whomever you see, they have a problem. Sahaja Yogi

604
00:31:46.011 --> 00:31:48.020
can never have a problem.

605
00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.966
Because the One who is giving the problem

606
00:31:51.966 --> 00:31:54.300
is also the One who has to solve it.

607
00:31:56.033 --> 00:31:57.899
So how will you have a problem?

608
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.633
This word has to get out of Sahaja. Problem.

609
00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:08.333
Get rid of it completely.

610
00:32:10.633 --> 00:32:14.194
The English left it on our heads perhaps. But they

611
00:32:14.194 --> 00:32:17.616
also never said it. ‘Problem’. I have never; the

612
00:32:17.616 --> 00:32:21.666
English during our time never said, ‘I have some problem’.

613
00:32:24.833 --> 00:32:27.673
And on top of that, in Sahaja, it should never be

614
00:32:27.673 --> 00:32:30.399
that you come and tell Mother the problems with

615
00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:31.933
others. That is even lower.

616
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.651
If you have faith then all will be well. If someone

617
00:32:40.651 --> 00:32:43.643
comes to you, ‘My son is sick’; ‘Come along, let’s

618
00:32:43.643 --> 00:32:46.694
make use of the photograph. Come along’. Everything

619
00:32:46.694 --> 00:32:47.633
will be alright!

620
00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.645
But as soon as a man gets realisation, he first

621
00:32:54.645 --> 00:32:58.412
thinks, most surprisingly – ‘How many relatives of

622
00:32:58.412 --> 00:33:02.179
mine are sick?’ Heal all of them. Daily. A list is

623
00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:06.094
made. Daily. Heal all of them. Pay for their journey

624
00:33:06.094 --> 00:33:09.788
to come and meet. When Mother is coming to visit,

625
00:33:09.788 --> 00:33:13.407
then for Her reception, at least fifteen lepers,

626
00:33:13.407 --> 00:33:17.322
twenty lame, twenty-four sightless – all such should

627
00:33:17.322 --> 00:33:21.015
be standing there. Otherwise, Mother has not been

628
00:33:21.015 --> 00:33:24.433
honoured. Without the disabled being there.

629
00:33:24.433 --> 00:33:25.299
[yogis laugh]

630
00:33:32.566 --> 00:33:34.892
Then [I] have to ask, ‘Is there at least one

631
00:33:34.892 --> 00:33:37.476
able-bodied among you? Or is everyone like this?’

632
00:33:37.476 --> 00:33:38.199
[yogis laugh].

633
00:33:48.166 --> 00:33:52.471
So, in Sahaja, a person thinks that, ‘I have to give

634
00:33:52.471 --> 00:33:56.857
something for Mother. Please let there be a beautiful

635
00:33:56.857 --> 00:34:01.000
flower for Mother. A nice flower. How many flowers

636
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.305
can I present to Mother?’ Instead of that, they have

637
00:34:05.305 --> 00:34:09.609
put up a line of twenty-five people. This is not any

638
00:34:09.609 --> 00:34:13.996
kind of honour, gentlemen. Maybe that is why there is

639
00:34:13.996 --> 00:34:17.569
this tradition – when a guard of honour was

640
00:34:17.569 --> 00:34:21.631
presented, they held up very strong batons – they

641
00:34:21.631 --> 00:34:25.611
must have had it so that only able-bodied people

642
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:29.672
could do this. That is why they made the guard of

643
00:34:29.672 --> 00:34:33.733
honour. So that only able-bodied persons could be

644
00:34:33.733 --> 00:34:37.957
presented. But now, if we do it, then all the blows

645
00:34:37.957 --> 00:34:42.343
will rain on Me [yogis laugh]. So the organisation of

646
00:34:42.343 --> 00:34:46.648
Sahaja is ‘swastha’ (fit). It is a fit organisation.

647
00:34:46.648 --> 00:34:49.409
Beautiful. Exceedingly beautiful.

648
00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:55.297
In bloom. Joy giving. Incomparable. That is the

649
00:34:55.297 --> 00:34:59.964
Sahaja organisation. I look at all things minutely.

650
00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:04.451
And feel happy in My mind. Like, the way you have

651
00:35:04.451 --> 00:35:09.118
made arrangements on the stage. Each and everything

652
00:35:09.118 --> 00:35:13.696
you made, the elephant, fish that you made; I know

653
00:35:13.696 --> 00:35:18.273
even the colours of all of them. My love overflows

654
00:35:18.273 --> 00:35:22.850
towards the one who made them. But if you put up a

655
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:27.338
ghost(bhut) in front of Me, as soon as I arrive, then My

656
00:35:27.338 --> 00:35:31.915
face will be made, no matter how I try to avoid my

657
00:35:31.915 --> 00:35:36.492
expressions. That is what happens. So, in a sahaja

658
00:35:36.492 --> 00:35:41.159
attitude, whatever pleases Mother should be offered

659
00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:46.006
to Her. And what pleases Mother? Our ‘prasanna’ (full

660
00:35:46.006 --> 00:35:50.583
of joy) faces and all the things in the world that

661
00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:51.930
are joy-giving.

662
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:57.032
Means children and flowers. I get great joy from

663
00:35:57.032 --> 00:36:01.508
them. Children and flowers are those beautiful things

664
00:36:01.508 --> 00:36:05.985
that God Almighty has made, that are full of joy. The

665
00:36:05.985 --> 00:36:10.130
flower will wither tomorrow or maybe in two hours.

666
00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:14.719
But when it is in front of Me, it is joyful. And I

667
00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:18.582
have seen that when a flower is kept in My room, it

668
00:36:18.582 --> 00:36:22.520
grows automatically; its size increases. It feels so

669
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.938
much joy. In the same manner, you should also

670
00:36:25.938 --> 00:36:29.875
understand that when you come in front of Me in joy,

671
00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:33.813
then the boon of that very joy you will find in your

672
00:36:33.813 --> 00:36:37.900
well-being, in whatever ‘problems’ you have [laughter],

673
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:52.822
only that will solve it. The joy with which you face

674
00:36:52.822 --> 00:36:58.732
Me. Crying will never work. If you bear it and face

675
00:36:58.732 --> 00:37:04.868
Me with joy –  then, as soon as you stand in front of

676
00:37:04.868 --> 00:37:10.778
Me – it will work out just like that. So we have to

677
00:37:10.778 --> 00:37:16.573
take to Sahaja attitude; we have to take to Sahaja

678
00:37:16.573 --> 00:37:22.142
dharma. And to attain Sahaja joy, first one must

679
00:37:22.142 --> 00:37:23.733
remain in joy.

680
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.544
Earlier, there used to be a word ‘manhoosiyat’

681
00:37:31.544 --> 00:37:34.988
(wretchedness). Nowadays it is hard to hear it

682
00:37:34.988 --> 00:37:38.725
because it seems like all the wretched are roaming

683
00:37:38.725 --> 00:37:42.609
around. And if someone is not wretched then foreigners say

684
00:37:42.609 --> 00:37:46.420
he is not handsome. One gentleman was very wretched

685
00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.010
and people there used to appreciate him a lot. I

686
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.308
asked why and they started saying he is very

687
00:37:53.308 --> 00:37:57.192
handsome. I said, ‘This one, who is like a skeleton,

688
00:37:57.192 --> 00:38:01.002
is in such bad shape. His eyes sunk in. As if he is

689
00:38:01.002 --> 00:38:04.960
coming out of some graveyard.’ ‘He is very handsome.’

690
00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.489
Everything of theirs is wrong side up. [Because],

691
00:38:09.489 --> 00:38:12.224
their heads are on the wrong side. So everything is

692
00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:14.959
seen in the wrong way. I could not understand it in

693
00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:17.799
any way earlier. Now I am beginning to understand why

694
00:38:17.799 --> 00:38:19.220
they consider him handsome.

695
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.741
Women who are, what is called ‘chidimaar’ (slang –

696
00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:30.782
like a twig) in Hindi; they like them. Don’t know.

697
00:38:30.782 --> 00:38:34.823
One puff and they will go and fall somewhere. They

698
00:38:34.823 --> 00:38:39.102
started saying that this is beautiful. How? From what

699
00:38:39.102 --> 00:38:40.766
angle? [yogis laugh].

700
00:38:49.266 --> 00:38:54.046
There is a gentleman there, a Punjabi. Punjabis are

701
00:38:54.046 --> 00:38:58.825
not like that; it’s not so bad with them. Right? He

702
00:38:58.825 --> 00:39:03.421
married a woman there. He left his first wife. So

703
00:39:03.421 --> 00:39:08.384
when we saw his first wife – his [new] wife is such a

704
00:39:08.384 --> 00:39:13.164
‘khoosat’ (mean) woman – we felt, why did his first

705
00:39:13.164 --> 00:39:17.852
wife who is like a goddess? So he says to me that,

706
00:39:17.852 --> 00:39:22.447
‘She is much better looking than my wife.’ [yogis

707
00:39:22.447 --> 00:39:27.319
laugh]. So My son-in-law says that better change his

708
00:39:27.319 --> 00:39:29.433
glasses. [yogis laugh].

709
00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.189
So, people’s mindsets are going the other way and, if

710
00:39:45.189 --> 00:39:49.679
we follow the English, then I do not know who we will

711
00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:54.169
consider as beautiful. Sometimes there is someone who

712
00:39:54.169 --> 00:39:58.326
repels one at sight, yet people start calling the

713
00:39:58.326 --> 00:40:02.234
same person beautiful. Not able to understand,

714
00:40:02.234 --> 00:40:06.474
someone leaning at an obtuse angle [yogis laugh] –

715
00:40:06.474 --> 00:40:10.880
how do they see everything the wrong way? In Sahaja,

716
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.287
a man can see right through. In and out. The one who

717
00:40:15.287 --> 00:40:19.694
can see the beauty within; only he is a Sahaja Yogi.

718
00:40:19.694 --> 00:40:24.100
Not outer [beauty]. What’s there about outer? Now if

719
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.091
you want, you just pay some money. You put up a

720
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:32.581
‘Dalda’ (a popular vegetable oil brand) tin on top of

721
00:40:32.581 --> 00:40:36.904
your head if you like and tie your hair around it –

722
00:40:36.904 --> 00:40:40.729
you are now fashionable, modern. It is called

723
00:40:40.729 --> 00:40:44.720
bouffant or something like that. [yogis laugh].

724
00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.499
Nowadays Dalda tin has gone away. Out of fashion.

725
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.762
Or you show off like this, then you are very

726
00:40:57.762 --> 00:41:02.109
fashionable. How strange it is. And what should our

727
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:06.456
thoughts be, what we should think about others – we

728
00:41:06.456 --> 00:41:10.720
do not understand. The one who is beautiful inside

729
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.151
and the one who can recognise that is a Sahaja Yogi.

730
00:41:15.151 --> 00:41:19.665
Because they themselves are beautiful within. The one

731
00:41:19.665 --> 00:41:23.846
who has such beauty inside; only he can recognise

732
00:41:23.846 --> 00:41:28.360
such a person. It is not necessary that such a person

733
00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.624
is going around in a car or a bullock cart. Nor if

734
00:41:32.624 --> 00:41:36.470
they are on foot and their feet have blisters.

735
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:42.579
Even then it is felt that, let us massage their feet

736
00:41:42.579 --> 00:41:47.448
with some oil. So that they feel better. Such a love

737
00:41:47.448 --> 00:41:51.766
develops even for the feet of the one who has a

738
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.331
beautiful heart working within. Unless and until you

739
00:41:59.315 --> 00:42:04.638
are able to recognise such a heart, you are not in

740
00:42:04.638 --> 00:42:10.065
Sahaja dharma. In that, there is no expectation, no

741
00:42:10.065 --> 00:42:15.179
greed or lust.  Just the beauty of such a person

742
00:42:15.179 --> 00:42:20.293
feels like a radiance of our own beauty. It just

743
00:42:20.293 --> 00:42:25.721
appeals by a look, by thinking, ‘Wah re wah. What a

744
00:42:25.721 --> 00:42:28.833
human being.’ This is Sahaja.

745
00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:36.367
One can talk so much about Sahaja dharma. This is not an outer; it is a

746
00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:42.003
dharma attained through inner yoga. We can know it in

747
00:42:42.003 --> 00:42:47.326
many ways. Like, in Sahaja dharma, speaking ill of

748
00:42:47.326 --> 00:42:52.962
someone, criticising any religion is a sin. A sin. It

749
00:42:52.962 --> 00:42:55.050
is considered a sin.

750
00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.408
Criticising a realised soul is considered the

751
00:43:00.408 --> 00:43:04.375
greatest sin.  Not only that, but even considering

752
00:43:04.375 --> 00:43:07.020
any country’s saint or incarnation

753
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.866
as less than another’s is also considered a sin.

754
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.566
All are alike.

755
00:43:18.266 --> 00:43:23.392
Just like our one eye and the other, one hand and the

756
00:43:23.392 --> 00:43:28.423
other – we do not differentiate. In the same manner,

757
00:43:28.423 --> 00:43:31.366
we fully respect all religions.

758
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.933
There is no need to go in front of a mosque and start

759
00:43:35.933 --> 00:43:38.767
singing songs like some monkeys. As it is, you are no

760
00:43:38.767 --> 00:43:41.443
kind of melodious singers. Ordinary, decent people

761
00:43:41.443 --> 00:43:43.700
will get up from their sleep and run away.

762
00:43:46.933 --> 00:43:50.039
And those with mosques – just going about anywhere

763
00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:53.267
and constructing mosques. So that Ramachandrachaji’s

764
00:43:53.267 --> 00:43:56.312
bhoomi (Shri Rama’s kingdom, Ayodhya) – it is not

765
00:43:56.312 --> 00:43:59.052
possible to attain it. It will get destroyed

766
00:43:59.052 --> 00:44:01.914
tomorrow. Yes, even the mosque that is made is

767
00:44:01.914 --> 00:44:05.142
Ramachandraji’s. Who was Ramchandraji? He is the one

768
00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:08.248
you are remembering when you say, ‘Allah O Akbar’.

769
00:44:08.248 --> 00:44:11.415
Who else are you remembering? Even if Mohammad Saab

770
00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:14.277
did not say, I am saying it. He was Shri Rama.

771
00:44:14.277 --> 00:44:17.322
Whether you make a temple there or a mosque. Or a

772
00:44:17.322 --> 00:44:20.733
church. The prayers are being offered to Shri Rama only.

773
00:44:21.933 --> 00:44:23.799
Call Him Rama or call Him Rahim.

774
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:29.288
Then what is the quarrel about? Alright, there is a

775
00:44:29.288 --> 00:44:32.823
mosque. Alright, we will come to your mosque. And we

776
00:44:32.823 --> 00:44:36.358
will offer Namaz there. But not from the mullahs; we

777
00:44:36.358 --> 00:44:39.559
will offer it in our way. What will the quarrel

778
00:44:39.559 --> 00:44:42.694
remain about then? This is not a mandir-masjid

779
00:44:42.694 --> 00:44:46.296
quarrel. It is the quarrel between the mullah and the

780
00:44:46.296 --> 00:44:49.364
priest. Because it is a matter of the stomach

781
00:44:49.364 --> 00:44:52.565
[income]. Whether the masjidwallahs earn or the

782
00:44:52.565 --> 00:44:54.966
mandirwallahs earn; it is just that.

783
00:44:55.833 --> 00:45:00.035
In Sahaja dharma, because money has no importance –

784
00:45:00.035 --> 00:45:04.400
this quarrel is no more. This quarrel is just no more.

785
00:45:07.933 --> 00:45:12.780
In Sahaja, the greatest thing is, that we must

786
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:18.348
understand that we are the religion of the Spirit. We

787
00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:23.711
are Atma (the Spirit). Placed in the Spirit. We are

788
00:45:23.711 --> 00:45:29.176
of the caste of the Spirit. It is the one and only –

789
00:45:29.176 --> 00:45:34.642
to know, to attain, to give importance to – the sole

790
00:45:34.642 --> 00:45:39.901
means and the sole object. And the rest is futile.

791
00:45:39.901 --> 00:45:44.748
That is why, there is no question of fights or

792
00:45:44.748 --> 00:45:50.213
quarrels in Sahaja dharma. Because the Spirit is the

793
00:45:50.213 --> 00:45:51.966
same in everyone.

794
00:45:56.333 --> 00:46:01.778
And when I see love and friendship between all of

795
00:46:01.778 --> 00:46:06.679
you, I am filled with joy. Nowadays there is

796
00:46:06.679 --> 00:46:12.451
friendship between Dr. Warren and Dr. Talwar. Let it

797
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:18.223
endure. Because both of them are ‘roaring’ [probably

798
00:46:18.223 --> 00:46:23.887
vocal] people. It is decreasing; the ‘roaring’. But

799
00:46:23.887 --> 00:46:28.679
it is pleasing to see such a friendship has

800
00:46:28.679 --> 00:46:34.233
developed. How many friends you have, Venugopalan?

801
00:46:34.233 --> 00:46:35.933
Venugopalan: All are friends.

802
00:46:35.933 --> 00:46:40.672
Shri Mataji: All are. No, one – you tell Me. No, no.

803
00:46:40.672 --> 00:46:45.143
I don’t believe you. First start with one friend.

804
00:46:45.143 --> 00:46:49.971
Then two. Then with three. All means it is lost. ‘Let

805
00:46:49.971 --> 00:46:54.620
us see; there is one friend of mine.’ Start it like

806
00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:58.734
that. This is just a crowd then. All are your

807
00:46:58.734 --> 00:47:02.400
friends. Who is your friend, Subramanian?

808
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.333
Subramanian: You.

809
00:47:04.333 --> 00:47:09.799
Shri Mataji: No, no. Me? Forget about Me. I am just a

810
00:47:09.799 --> 00:47:15.366
bubble. Let us see. How many friends have you got here?

811
00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.240
Subramian: I have no enemies here.

812
00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:22.336
Shri Mataji: No, no enemies. Friends? Mr Verma, who

813
00:47:22.336 --> 00:47:24.800
is your friend? Name one friend.

814
00:47:26.499 --> 00:47:28.933
No, no you have to tell this [laughs].

815
00:47:33.699 --> 00:47:34.866
‘Everybody’ – that has no meaning.

816
00:47:35.033 --> 00:47:38.033
A Sahaja Yogi: I have got one – Yogi Mahajan.

817
00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:39.599
Shri Mataji: I don’t think so there.

818
00:47:44.633 --> 00:47:45.730
I wouldn’t say that.

819
00:47:50.233 --> 00:47:52.568
I wouldn’t say that. That is not friendship.

820
00:47:55.466 --> 00:47:58.224
So many foreigners have come. How many have you made

821
00:47:58.224 --> 00:48:00.721
friends with? They remain untouched [separate].

822
00:48:00.721 --> 00:48:03.427
Become friends with one and show. One friend first.

823
00:48:03.427 --> 00:48:03.999
Let us see.

824
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.831
But one thing I will say is that the foreigners are

825
00:48:07.831 --> 00:48:09.266
great friends among themselves.

826
00:48:11.266 --> 00:48:14.366
What is the criteria, let us see.

827
00:48:16.366 --> 00:48:19.033
The criteria of the friend is this –

828
00:48:21.766 --> 00:48:23.533
that even I

829
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.899
am challenged.

830
00:48:29.233 --> 00:48:33.166
In the sense, that I try to test you – suppose.

831
00:48:34.233 --> 00:48:37.792
I will tell you something against, say your friend

832
00:48:37.792 --> 00:48:38.700
Yogi Mahajan.

833
00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:43.156
And if you support that, then you are not his friend.

834
00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:45.466
Alright?

835
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.466
And that’s what I find.

836
00:48:50.566 --> 00:48:54.084
But supposing I tell something to Warren or to Doctor

837
00:48:54.084 --> 00:48:57.666
[Talwar]; they will support each other. Thick and thin.

838
00:49:01.633 --> 00:49:05.595
That sort of a friendship. I just test you. And I

839
00:49:05.595 --> 00:49:06.466
like people

840
00:49:07.566 --> 00:49:09.433
who support the Sahaja Yogis.

841
00:49:10.766 --> 00:49:14.233
Who come forward and say, ‘Mother, please forgive him.

842
00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:17.466
I know he did some mistake. But please forgive him’.

843
00:49:17.466 --> 00:49:18.933
I feel very happy.

844
00:49:26.966 --> 00:49:29.866
That’s how we correct each other. Through friendship.

845
00:49:34.633 --> 00:49:37.833
But most of you will say one thing, ‘My wife is my friend’.

846
00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.933
Or ‘my husband is my friend’.

847
00:49:46.233 --> 00:49:49.999
But there also I would like to say, I am not very sure.

848
00:49:49.999 --> 00:49:50.433
[laughs]

849
00:49:56.966 --> 00:49:58.433
Then what will happen?

850
00:50:01.033 --> 00:50:03.929
Imagine that all of you are cells in My body. And

851
00:50:03.929 --> 00:50:06.594
nobody is friendly. How am I to carry on this

852
00:50:06.594 --> 00:50:09.433
message? How am I to carry on this Body of Mine?

853
00:50:12.933 --> 00:50:14.266
So, in Sahaja dharma,

854
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.699
we are collective beings,

855
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:19.433
and

856
00:50:21.499 --> 00:50:24.133
we stand by each other.

857
00:50:26.266 --> 00:50:26.766
Even

858
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.020
if we face our Mother.

859
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:30.766
That’s friendship.

860
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.914
You have to support each other.

861
00:50:39.366 --> 00:50:40.566
Help each other.

862
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.833
‘Please forgive, Mother. He might have done a mistake.

863
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.800
Please help him, Mother’.

864
00:50:47.333 --> 00:50:49.433
That I love the most.

865
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.566
Doctor Chugh, who is your wife?

866
00:50:59.566 --> 00:51:00.966
Do you have any friend other than her

867
00:51:00.966 --> 00:51:01.841
or is she the only one?

868
00:51:03.633 --> 00:51:05.366
Are you two sitting together?

869
00:51:06.233 --> 00:51:07.433
She is over there, at least.

870
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.300
So make each of you make at least one friend.

871
00:51:16.966 --> 00:51:19.866
We have Rakhi Bandhan over here.

872
00:51:20.833 --> 00:51:22.700
But we should have ‘Bhai Bandhan’ (bond of brothers) also.

873
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.699
Organise one ‘Bhai Bandhan’.

874
00:51:27.166 --> 00:51:29.159
What is the objection to that? There is Rakhi

875
00:51:29.159 --> 00:51:31.066
Bandhan, now we will have Bhai Bandhan also.

876
00:51:32.266 --> 00:51:34.099
Venugopalan, you find out your friend.

877
00:51:34.566 --> 00:51:37.533
And now we will have Bhai Bandhan. Yogi Mahajan, you too.

878
00:51:38.366 --> 00:51:41.578
Rakhi bandhan is alright. That is for the safe

879
00:51:41.578 --> 00:51:42.466
married life.

880
00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:46.228
But what about Bhai Bandhan? So today we decide, that

881
00:51:46.228 --> 00:51:49.782
in Sahaja Yoga, we all will have a Bhai Bandhan to

882
00:51:49.782 --> 00:51:53.474
begin with. Then how many ‘bhais’ (friends/brothers)

883
00:51:53.474 --> 00:51:57.167
you have is not the point. Start with one. You don’t

884
00:51:57.167 --> 00:52:00.929
have eleven children all together, do you? So you can

885
00:52:00.929 --> 00:52:04.621
have one brother. Then another brother. I can’t have

886
00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.433
all the brothers together.

887
00:52:07.599 --> 00:52:09.495
So, if that has to happen, you must have

888
00:52:09.495 --> 00:52:13.190
one friend, to begin with. Then a second friend. Then

889
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:14.833
a third friend. Alright?

890
00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:18.275
So today, we have learned that in Sahaja dharma, that

891
00:52:18.275 --> 00:52:20.717
brotherhood should start with one and then extend out

892
00:52:20.717 --> 00:52:23.160
to everyone. So today, we have learned that in Sahaja

893
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.466
dharma, that brotherhood should start with one and

894
00:52:25.466 --> 00:52:26.733
then extend out to everyone.

895
00:52:31.033 --> 00:52:33.750
And as you ascend you will find that brotherhood will

896
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:36.417
increase. Those who have reached high, you will find

897
00:52:36.417 --> 00:52:38.700
that they have great friendships with one another.

898
00:52:40.599 --> 00:52:45.684
Like Gregoire is in Geneva, Warren is here, and James

899
00:52:45.684 --> 00:52:50.769
is in Australia. All of them will give their life for

900
00:52:50.769 --> 00:52:51.899
one another.

901
00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:53.599
That is right.

902
00:52:56.266 --> 00:52:59.352
These people have attained brotherhood more than us

903
00:52:59.352 --> 00:53:02.497
because they had not known it. Right at this moment,

904
00:53:02.497 --> 00:53:04.633
My brother has also come, see. Come.

905
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:09.099
So, this has to be known.

906
00:53:10.666 --> 00:53:13.499
That we should have one firm friend.

907
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.599
Among Sahaja Yogis.

908
00:53:20.433 --> 00:53:22.873
Alright, now let us have the puja. I was waiting for

909
00:53:22.873 --> 00:53:23.333
them only.

910
00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.033
Give me some water.

911
00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.566
Before we start the puja,

912
00:53:30.566 --> 00:53:32.399
Have you made the list?

913
00:53:32.966 --> 00:53:33.666
Is it made?

914
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.233
It’s not sisterhood, is it?[laughs].

915
00:53:41.766 --> 00:53:42.366
[yogis laugh].

916
00:53:45.499 --> 00:53:48.668
Else the list will be made of all sisters. It’s not

917
00:53:48.668 --> 00:53:49.399
that, is it?

918
00:53:57.066 --> 00:54:00.346
Now I am also feeling well. Because you are happy, so

919
00:54:00.346 --> 00:54:01.500
I am also happy.
