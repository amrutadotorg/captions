00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.240
Today it's such a pleasure to be here again,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.920
in Brighton;

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.880
and, slowly and steadily, I find

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.040
Sahaja Yoga is settling down in this place.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.640
When I first came to Brighton just to visit,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.880
I felt there must be many seekers in this place,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.600
who might have been lost

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.640
and always had a great hope

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.840
that one day they will be able to come to reality.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.120
Today specially is a very great day

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.320
because today is the birthday of Lord Buddha.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.600
And in the morning, I talked to Sahaja Yogis

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.560
about His great incarnation,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.520
and how He came on this earth

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.200
and He got His realization,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.600
and then how He tried to spread

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.800
the message of realizations to others.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.680
Many people believe and think

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.480
that Christ was an atheist … Buddha was an atheist,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.680
while Christ was a person, believer in God.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.600
And some people prefer Buddha to Jesus Christ.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.720
It's something very amazing is that …

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.000
that when the people are born

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.440
in the particular circumstances,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.320
they have to talk about things

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.720
which are very, very important at that point of time.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.600
At the time when Buddha came on this earth in India,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.160
we had too many ritualism of Brahmanism

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.360
and conditioning of the teachings

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.800
of those money-makers and commercializers

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.160
who wanted to make money in the name of God

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.800
and in the name of religion.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.320
So, to neutralize all that,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.040
He decided not to talk at all, at all about

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.080
God,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.840
about any particular religious ways,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.160
but He said that you keep to the middle path of life,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.160
eightfold middle path of life,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.280
and that you first get your Self-realization.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.480
To Him it was very important that one should get Self-realization.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And that's what

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.200
He wanted to give as a message

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.480
and divert the attention of the people

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.960
from the idea of God or incarnation —

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.440
for the time being —

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.720
because He wanted to show that Self-realization is very important

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.280
and that without Self-realization you cannot understand God

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480
or Divine Power.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.920
So He was not an atheist.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.080
He and Christ, I would say, were in a way contemporary,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.280
but Christ came later,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.280
and Buddha came about five hundred years before Christ.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.200
They are so much related to each other,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.840
so much close to each other,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.400
so much identified with each other,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.800
as if they are part and parcel of one being.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.600
That only you can understand when you get your Self-realization.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.000
Christ has said: “Those who are not against Me are with Me.”

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.400
Who are “those”, who are not against Him?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.040
Because we have no knowledge as to real the origin of Christ,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.640
from where He came, what was His origin,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.880
how He was created in the heaven,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.680
how He is the Son of God.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.640
Whatever we see today as a person who came on this earth

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.200
to teach us about His father, God Almighty,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.680
we just believe into that part,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.880
which is a very limited part of Christ,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.800
and Bible cannot contain that great personality.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.760
In the same way, Buddha has been dumped

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.920
into very small dimensions.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.840
Only two persons realized it; they got out of it.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.400
One of them was Viditama,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.920
who went away to Japan and started the Zen system of religion.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.240
But even today if you see the Zen,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.120
which was nothing but dhyana, the meditation,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.360
sahaja, spontaneous awakening —

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.760
is reduced to the same level as any other preaching.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.440
I met the head of the Zen system.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.640
He was very sick, and they brought him to Me

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.600
because he wanted to be cured.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.320
And I was amazed that, not that he was a realized soul,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.880
not at all a realized soul — but his Kundalini, which is the force

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.960
which is going to give him realization was all frozen.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.880
And he had no desire to become self-realized.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.360
I talked to him, I was amazed.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.400
And I said, “How is it,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.680
that according to Zen you have to be a kashyapa?”

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.560
Kashyapa means a person who is a realized soul.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.760
That's the name of the university, as I told you yesterday in Lewes,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.720
is the name of the university is kashyapa:

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.360
those who have no university,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.680
in the sense, those who have the university of God.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.360
So he said, “Oh, that's over now,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.160
God is not making anybody kashyapas now.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.800
Only from the sixth to the eighth century,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.040
in two hundred years, there were only twenty-six kashyapas,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.960
after that there were none. And I don't hope to be one.”

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.440
I said, “Why not?”

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.640
He said, “No, I have no hopes about it,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.680
I'm just now appointed as the head of Zen, so I'm there,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.840
but we don't get kashyapas these days at all.”

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.440
So with that he doomed all the hopes

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.280
of all the people to become Zen,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.440
to become person who knows,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.040
person who is a realized soul.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.440
This one was very shocking to Me

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.000
because Zen is something so great.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.560
There's so much expressive of Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.720
You cannot understand Zen unless and until you are a realized soul.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.240
Even Bible you can't understand, you can't understand Gita,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.080
you can't understand anything

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.080
unless and until you are a realized soul.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.280
The second person who really emerged out of it,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.000
all this ritualism and all that

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.480
that they had created out of Buddha's life,

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.400
was Lao Tze,

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.600
who preached about Tao.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.640
Tao is the all-pervading Divine Power.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.520
Power of love.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.800
When He talked about it, He explained about it,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.400
and He started another group of people,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.240
who were to be given realization.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.720
But that also today, I find, has become “Tao-ism”.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.400
Everything becomes “ism” — means “imprisoned”.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.160
It's not living, it's not there,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.640
it's just a thought of Tao people read.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.680
I have seen people … there's one gentleman in India

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.400
who has written a complete book on Tao.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.840
He's not even a realized soul.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.800
What is he writing? I was just wondering, with his blind eyes,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.600
what is he describing, what colors can he describe?

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.600
So you must know that you have to be self-realized first.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.280
Then see for yourself.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.440
Then you will know whether there is spirit or not,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.680
then you will know whether there are roots

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.800
to this tree that has grown outside,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.840
then you will know where there is God or not.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.960
Then you will know what these incarnations

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.280
have any meaning or not.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.800
Just before that just to sit down and criticize

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.440
is not a sensible thing.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.600
That's why Buddha … who occupies a very special place

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.440
within our being itself, He resides on this side.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.960
This is the place where our ego is attached,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.960
and He is the one who really controls our ego.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.360
So this Buddha

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.720
also is such a part and parcel,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.240
is to be understood only after you have got realization.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.240
Without that you are still incomplete.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.920
You are not that by which you will know.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.720
Like Krishna has said: “Atmanyevatmana tushtah” [BhG 2-55].

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.080
Through the atma, through the spirit only you are going to know God.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.520
Not through with this mental projection,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.840
with these eyes, with these senses but through the spirit.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.160
And where is the spirit within us?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.360
The spirit lies in our heart

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.160
and is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.800
It's called as a kshetragya,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.080
means “the one who knows the field of our action”.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.960
The one who sees what we are doing,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.440
who is the witness of what we are doing.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.840
But He is not in our attention.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.520
That gentleman wants to come, please come.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.680
He is not in our attention.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.760
And if He is not in our attention,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.480
we do not know how to connect

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.160
ourselves with Him to have a rapport with Him,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.000
to understand Him.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.600
That's why first this spirit has to be brought in our own attention.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.960
That's the most important thing,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.240
and because this is not with us,

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.640
we are still incomplete, we make mistakes.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.280
Because the absolute thing that is within us is the spirit,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.040
while we live on a relative world.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.360
Today somebody comes and says to  you all right.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.680
Just now, when we were coming, there was a gentleman

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.520
who handed over a card to Me,

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.000
about … something about Christ.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.640
He's telling Me about Christ, I really must laugh at it.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.200
But supposing tomorrow Christ comes and stands before you;

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.440
will you be able to recognize Him, or will you crucify Him again?

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.040
How will you recognize Him? How will you recognize Buddha?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:54.240
Have you got sensitivity to know who is Christ?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.320
It's very easy to, you see, to represent Christ,

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.280
it's very easy because they think

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.360
that, after all, you see, everybody has a right to do what they like.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.480
Even Hitler talked of God, can you imagine?

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.800
Hitler talked of God!

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.360
Everyone thinks he has got right to talk of God, to describe Him!

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.680
But first of all you must know

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.120
that no use deceiving ourselves,

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.520
we have to get our Self-realization.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.600
We have to know ourselves first of all.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.040
Now, Buddha's attitude towards His attainment was

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.560
that He was actually

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.320
touched by the miseries of the world.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:54.520
He saw a person who was sick. He saw a man who was dead.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.640
He saw an old man. All these things worked on His mind,

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.120
and He started thinking: “Why these miseries are there?”

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.880
So the whole search came

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.080
through the understanding for others.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.640
That takes too much time because you have to go on neutralizing:

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.920
“Not this, not this, not wife, not children, not family…”

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.680
You go on negating, negating, negating;

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.240
all your lives you go on, one after another. Doesn't work out.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.200
The other way is simpler — could be …

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.000
which of course by Buddha's attainment only

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.000
has been made even better …

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.000
all of them have done something for us within ourselves —

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.680
that first we look after ourselves,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.480
find out about ourselves.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.640
Are we realized souls?

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.840
Are we Buddhas?

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.960
Are we the people who know?

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.880
Let us be honest.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.720
Then we have to know.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.920
Now, what is the way to know is the point.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:22.040
Now, if I say that you will know — in your evolutionary process.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.280
As you have evolved to be a human being, you will be evolved

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.000
to be a realized soul.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.840
But there's a little difference as to what has happened so far

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.800
and what is going to happen later on.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.520
So far, we have been evolved

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.400
through a method which was beyond

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.080
our freedom.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.680
The nature worked it out, the nature within us,

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.160
the central force of evolution within us

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.880
has brought us to this position that from amoeba

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.320
today we are human beings.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.640
But at this stage, when we are human beings,

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:20.840
to go further, there's a special mechanism.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.840
Like, till to make this instrument,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.520
we had to use other instruments to make it.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.120
Now, once the instrument is just ready,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.320
we have to just plug this one to the mains, and it's done.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.120
As if you are made

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.960
to be ready

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.200
to be plugged to the all-pervading Power;

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:59.400
and by some special, spontaneous method

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.200
done by the living force within us,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.240
we have to be plugged to the mains.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.040
But the difference

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:19.240
between a human being and other animals

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:25.040
is this that human beings were given their freedom.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.960
At the stage of, say, Adam and Eve,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.640
if people would not have gone too far with their freedom,

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.920
it would have been much easier

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.920
to give realization to people at that time.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.600
But when freedom is given,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:52.120
then people misuse it. Or, they want to use it.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.840
They don't want to obey, because to obey means, they think,

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.160
there is no freedom.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.160
And that's how, when they started using their freedom,

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.640
they had to do things which were wrong,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.280
which were anti-life, which were anti-evolution,

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.360
without realizing what they were doing.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.360
When it reached the stage

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.200
when people found that was wrong, they gave it up.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.520
Then another thing they tried,

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.280
it was like an error being corrected.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.240
Then they corrected it.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.600
That's how human beings have been trying,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.040
experimenting with this, experimenting with that;

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.280
and then they come to a point where they say, “Given up now,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.160
it's too much.”

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.560
That's the best point, I think, as Buddha had reached;

00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.760
He was so tired, lying down under a banyan tree —

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.960
and He got His realization.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.880
So now I am here before you to tell you

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.720
what is the mechanism.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.120
You should not in any case accept Me fully, you should not.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.800
That would be wrong on My part and wrong on your part

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
because you're free, you are free, not to accept or to accept.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.080
But you have to keep yourself open

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.080
because this is a new category of knowledge

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.640
which I am telling you about.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.160
About the roots, about which you do not know.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.400
You know only about the tree,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.560
but I want to tell you about the roots.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.480
The best thing would be, first and foremost,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.520
to be able to enter into the roots.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.720
But you cannot!

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.000
As the human mind is,

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.560
it wants to know everything about everything first of all.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.480
But see, here,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.560
if you have to enter into this room

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.720
and there is no light, somebody tells you,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.000
“All right, press that button and you get all the lights.”

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.600
And you do it!

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.320
It's all built in there, it's just there.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.000
But if somebody starts telling, “All right, I'll tell you

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.880
there is something called electricity.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.680
Now, that was discovered such and such era,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.520
then there was this gentleman,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.400
who discovered this part of electricity,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:51.160
then we used the water power to generate the electricity,

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.440
and that's how there was a committee was formed” —

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.080
and the whole history about the Sussex electrical system.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.320
Then you'll say, “Now, we are fed up, now will you stop it!”

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.960
It's like that.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.560
So, if I have to tell you the whole history, it will be too much.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.160
Best thing would be to press the button, see the light, enjoy it,

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.200
and then you can know about it if you want to know.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.400
If you want to!

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.680
It is just like that. The knowledge of the roots

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.560
is greater than the knowledge of the tree.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.280
But unless and until you know how to become that subtle

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.480
to enter into the roots,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.760
whatever I talk is Greek and Latin,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.400
or, for you people, I would say, is like Sanskrit language.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.960
But still, I'll try to explain to you few things

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.240
that lie within ourselves.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.960
But by listening to that,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.320
I want to tell you, you cannot get your realization.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.720
Whatever I may talk for hours together,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.360
you will not get your realization.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.960
It's a happening that has to take place within you.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.280
Unless and until this happening takes place,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.920
you cannot get your realization.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.680
And it's a happening which is to be experienced by you, not by Me.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.280
It is to be felt by you,

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:35.680
and by this happening you have to feel your own powers,

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:40.120
your own glory, and your own purpose.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.480
So far, we do not know the purpose of human life,

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.280
why human beings were created from amoeba stage.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.280
But then you know what is the purpose of this life.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.200
I'm sure they must have told you something about Kundalini.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.400
Jason, did you tell them?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.840
Not much?

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.840
YOGI: Very little, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: Eh?

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.800
YOGI: Very little, Mother.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.920
SHRI MATAJI: What's he saying?
YOGI: That he [UNCLEAR] very little.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.040
SHRI MATAJI: All right.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.160
So now here I would like to tell you something about it,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.640
which you should take as a hypothesis just now

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.080
and try to understand. It's not very difficult, to begin with.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.760
And later on, as soon as you get your realization,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.960
it's the easiest thing to do.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.360
We have within ourselves seven centers,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.600
placed in our medulla oblongata and in the brain.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.080
The first one lies below the triangular bone,

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.320
which is called as sacrum,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.200
and it's called as the Mooladhara center,

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.840
which means “the support of the roots”.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.960
It is the support of the roots.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:08.160
And this center embodies our innocence.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.080
The second one … and of course it manifests outside in the gross,

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.120
the pelvic plexus.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.240
Now, the second one is the one that emerges from the third one,

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.800
which is called as the Nabhi Chakra, the third one;

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.400
and the one that emerges from that

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.680
is the second one, called as the Swadishthana.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.480
Now, the Swadishthana Chakra in the gross —

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.360
because these are subtle centers, in the medulla oblongata —

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:48.320
but outside, in the gross, it manifests

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.040
what we call the aortic plexus.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.360
If there are doctors here, they'll understand what I'm talking about.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.800
Now, if you go further,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
the Nabhi Chakra manifests outside what we call as the solar plexus.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.720
Above that is the center that we call as the Heart center,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.160
Anahata Chakra, cardiac center,

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.280
which manifests outside

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.520
the cardiac plexus.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.560
And it has got, again, the left and right side.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:29.480
Then we have the center at the root of our neck,

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.120
which is called as the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.640
and which manifests outside

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.800
the cervical plexus.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.520
Above that, here where you see the red mark on My head —

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.520
this is just the window of that center —

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.360
between the pituitary and the pineal body,

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.320
where the optic chiasma cross each other in the center,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:58.000
is a very important center called as Agnya Chakra,

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.280
which looks after our ego and our superego,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.160
which you can see there passing through that,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.520
crossing over like that.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.240
And on the top of that is the last seventh center,

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.320
called as the Sahasrara,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.800
meaning “one thousand petals center”.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And that's the center …

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.800
is just in the limbic area,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.600
and when you pierce through that in the fontanelle area,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
you feel the cool breeze of the Kundalini, or the Holy Ghost,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.200
coming out of your head.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.800
This has to happen.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.560
You cannot give false certificates.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.880
You have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.720
You have to feel the cool breeze in your hands;

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.600
that means you have to feel the all-pervading Power of God,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.400
of Love,

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.160
which is called as Brahma Shakti in Sanskrit language

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:11.000
and in the Bible is called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.680
For the first time you have to feel it

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.720
in your hands, in your central nervous system.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.880
Because the seat of your spirit is here,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.880
but the spirit resides in the heart.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.440
Once the seat is touched by the awakened Kundalini —

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.840
which is in the triangular bone, if you see —

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.640
then you start feeling

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.720
the first the cool breeze and then in the hand,

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.600
you start feeling the cool breeze flowing from you.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:52.280
Thus you manifest the power of your spirit.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.960
It's a happening that has to take place. It's a living happening.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.320
It's very easy to tell people, “All right, now you start jumping.”

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.120
You see, anybody can jump, what's so great in jumping?

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.400
Or if somebody says, “All right, take out your clothes.”

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.880
What's so great? Or, “Color your clothes in this way.”

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.800
Nothing so special, anybody can do it.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.440
But can you take out cool breeze out of your head?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.160
Your own head.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.320
And when you get it, you can do it to others.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.640
Even from the others' heads you can take it out.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.600
This is the way it has to happen, the time has come.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.560
This is a very special time, when so many seekers are born,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.360
so many of them, in millions and millions of them;

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.920
and so many are lost also,

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.200
because of various reasons, because of attack on them.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.120
From very childhood, a person who is a seeker is attacked.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.680
Ultimately, his ego can attack.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.440
He may have his own mental projections built in,

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.880
he may have horrible gurus, taking out money from him.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.720
And there'll be people … will be maneuvering them,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.960
there'll be people who'll be creating projection things

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.120
just to engulf them.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.160
But to an Indian, it is easy — if they are Indians, of course;

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.960
if they are uprooted people and all are westernized, then I can't say.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.280
But to a normal Indian, they know

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.840
it is the Kundalini awakening that gives you realization.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.480
I don't have to tell them that this is so.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.280
They know. They are not naive.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.360
But in the Bible also it is written

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:43.600
that “I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.440
and actually, when you see the Sahasrara,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.480
it looks likes beautiful flames in seven colors,

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.360
most harmless, silently;

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.800
like this flame

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.120
but very longish flames,

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.200
and silently burning and opening out,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.640
very cooling flames.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.240
Even this flame can give you cool breeze.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.080
It has happened with many;

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.800
and how it works out, that we have to see.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.760
It's fantastic! It's too much to believe.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.480
First of all, we have no faith in ourselves,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.560
we don't know how can we get realization so easily.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.960
People had to do this, people had to do that.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.200
But time has come.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.320
You have done everything in your previous lives.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.520
You have starved yourself,

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.240
you have roamed about,

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.960
you have done all the tapasyas, the penance,

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.360
and today is the time for you to get realization.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.400
And that's what it is.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.000
But why doubt it? You don't have to pay for it.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.200
Nothing is selling here, you know that. Nothing is selling.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.480
Actually, you cannot sell God. You cannot sell God!

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.640
Those who sell are committing sins.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.480
How can you sell love?

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.480
Love is not a saleable quality.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.880
Then the love of God, how can you sell?

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.160
But we are so attracted by commercializing and all that.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.760
Because everything is so commercialized.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.480
And so traditional now that, for people

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.240
who says that you cannot pay for your realization,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.920
they just can't understand how can it be.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.160
Get out of this, get out of it!

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.360
And just know that commercializing is a sin

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.000
if you try to do that in the realm of Divine.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.120
It's a sinful thing. Anybody who has done that is wrong.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.160
Christ had taken a big hunter and hit all those people

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.120
who were selling near that church. That's what it is.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.160
Today we find in all the churches, all the temples,

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.120
mosques and everywhere — are nothing but commercializing.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.960
But that doesn't mean that those people

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.800
who propounded those great ideals

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.800
to balance yourself

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.120
on your Void as we call it —

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:26.320
they gave you the Ten Commandments to balance yourself —

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.800
that they were wrong,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.560
that they did it just as a mental projection.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.760
It's a fact, you have to balance yourself!

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.320
All of them tried to balance you,

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.840
gave you a method of moderation.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.040
For what is this moderation?

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.160
Is for the ascent.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.120
If you do not have balance in life, you cannot move.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.720
Imagine a car going on two wheels on one side.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.640
Even if there's a bicycle, you have to balance it.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.760
You just can't ride a bicycle if you don't know how to balance it.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.360
So this balance was to be established, and that's why

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.720
they propounded all these great ideals for all of you.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.880
And all this is for your ascent

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.520
and not to be just settled down with that balance.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.680
You have to ascend, and that ascent

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.280
is now very simple and easy

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.440
because the time has come.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.560
As I told you yesterday, on the tree of life

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.800
there were very, very few flowers to begin with.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.160
But today, at the blossom time, there are so many seekers.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.240
A special category, the flowers as they call it.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.080
They are flowers, no doubt;

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.560
when they called them flowers, it was true they were flowers —

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.560
but they went into wrong direction.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.720
They were definitely flowers to become fruits.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.320
And they will, God willing,

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.920
all of them will have to become the fruits.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.120
May God bless you all!

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.000
I always ask people to ask Me questions,

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.240
but that doesn't mean that you should go on

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.520
taking time unnecessarily.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:37.880
And, also, mentally, I can just satisfy you up to a point

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.480
because the mind cannot cross the barriers.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.200
It has to be triggered into a space

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.880
of thoughtless awareness.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.400
And what you understand through your mind

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.200
is only the signboard,

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.240
which you can read; but you have to enter inside,

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.120
and for that, the ascent has to take place.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.320
That's important.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.000
The other day in the university there was only one person

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.880
who asked many questions.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.280
And he was the one who didn't ascend,

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.840
the rest of them all ascended.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.240
It's very sad. And we have to work on him, of course;

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.600
he is going to ascend because he wants to ascend.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.640
But the questions went on like that, and such a waste of time.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.800
Because you are earnest seekers and truthful seekers,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.280
please ask questions which will help everyone.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.480
We have to be kind to everyone.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.680
May God bless you!

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.840
If you have any questions, please ask Me.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.720
Yes?

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.240
SEEKER: [UNCLEAR], is it dangerous

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.480
to split a mental cord? [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.520
SHRI MATAJI: Now, can you tell Me what he's saying?

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.160
Just tell it. I'll see, I have to be able to answer.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.080
YOGI: Is it dangerous to split thoughts?

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.520
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, no! We are not splitting it.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.120
You are sadly mistaken. That's not the point.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:58.000
You see, a thought rises as a reaction to something, all right?

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.760
Rises and falls off, and then another thought rises and falls off.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.040
In between the thought, there's a little space,

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.440
which in Sanskrit called as vilamba.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.920
Now, the thought may come from the future, may come from the past,

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.960
but when it comes, it goes to the past, all right?

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.280
Now, what happens: that we see the rising of the thought

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.600
but not falling of the thought.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.600
And in between the thought, this vilamba is the present.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.640
Now, if I tell you, “Be in the present,” you cannot.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.480
But you just go on thinking, thinking, thinking like mad.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.640
On the cusps of the thought you are moving, just like mad.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.440
But there's a realm beyond the thought,

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:48.000
which is complete awareness and thoughtless awareness,

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.240
where there is no thought.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.440
And thought is a great joy killer.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.400
I'll tell you how. For example, you are seeing these flowers now.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.600
I am also seeing them.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.000
Now, I am seeing it thoughtlessly, you are seeing it with thought.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.880
So the thought arises: “From what shop She must have bought?

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.360
How much it must have cost?”

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.640
Because thought is not joy.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:18.520
But I am just looking at it, without thinking.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.040
The complete creation of this,

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.960
all the joy that is put into this,

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.480
all the joy that has been created by putting it

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.480
into this kind of a style, all that is silent

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.600
is just entering into My being

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.600
and giving Me that peace and the joy for which it was created.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.200
Is a barrier; actually, thought is always a barrier!

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.360
But when you go beyond thought, it doesn't mean

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.400
that you cannot think but you become a master.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.400
If you want you can think, if you don't want you cannot think.

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.000
But you are not driven by your thoughts. You see My point?

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:01.040
It's like the thought is riding you, now you ride the thoughts.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.560
SEEKER: Can you prevent the thinking?
SHRI MATAJI: Can you…?

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.320
SEEKER: Can you prevent the thinking I have in my head?

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.360
SHRI MATAJI: Yes! If you want, you can just sit silent,

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.600
in your silence enjoying it. If you want, you can think.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.960
But after that, whatever you think

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.080
has a special quality.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.440
Because that thought that comes to you after your realization

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.800
is guided, enlightened by your spirit.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.040
Say, a thought comes to you. For example, you are sitting here,

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.360
and you see something in the darkness,

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.880
and you think this is a serpent.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.720
For example, you might think; you see, thinking anything is possible.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.520
There's no control.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.960
So you think it is a serpent going, and you are frightened of it,

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.560
and you try to save yourself. But supposing there is light.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.080
Then the same thought tells you, “No, no, it's not,

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.320
it's just a rope lying there.”

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.800
With enlightenment, the same thought has a special quality.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Because you see it in all its dimensions and understand

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.000
what does that mean, what it is like,

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:14.040
what is the absolute value of particular thought is.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.280
And you just give up.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.080
Whatever is not right, you just give up; whatever is right, you accept.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.160
Because you see it clearly.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.360
So far, there is no discrimination.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.960
Now, a thought comes to a person

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.800
that “Let me go and murder someone.” This all comes from thought!

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.960
“Because I hate that person, I must murder that person.” All right?

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.040
It's all hatred working.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.520
Now, you may obey that thought, somewhere,

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.240
and you murder that person.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.080
And then, after the violence, the whole thing, the face changes,

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.840
and you become so nervous, and everything starts.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.560
First thought takes you down there to kill the person,

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.560
and the second thought comes [UNCLEAR]:

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.800
“Oh God, what have I done!”

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.640
Both are wrong.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.320
But if you are a realized soul, first of all you'll not hate anyone.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.840
There are ways of neutralizing the hatred in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.720
And neutralizing even the hatred of the person who hates you.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.960
Love's powers we have never known before.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.440
We only know the power of hatred, you see;

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.280
the way we are producing MX [MX missile], and this, and that —

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.280
is nothing, is based on hatred and filth.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.240
If these people get realization — I don't know if they'll ever get it —

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.560
they won't produce all these horrible things,

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.400
which is making everyone shudder.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.800
We have never used the power of love so far,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.080
but that you cannot do it unless and until you have felt it,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.280
after realization.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.720
SEEKER: Will you please tell us something of the technique?

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.920
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I will.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.480
As I said … that it's a spontaneous thing,

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.440
it's done as a living process, all right?

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.800
Now, say, if I say that …

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.120
what is the technique of sprouting a seed?

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.040
That's a living process.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.600
No technique, you just put it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.320
It's all built in.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.520
It's a divine technique,

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.480
by which it works out, first.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.600
But then you become the master of the technique yourself.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.280
Then you can do it!

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.000
Because you enter into a new realm where you have the divine power,

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.920
by which you can do it yourself, you can maneuver it.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.920
But how you get your realization? Is through the spontaneous process.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.400
And a very simple process, is like this: a candle

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.760
which is enlightened can enlighten another light.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.160
If the candle is there

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.280
and if the candle is in order.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.240
But this candle, if it's a realized soul …

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.000
that it can also correct —

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.280
through its techniques, which you have to learn —

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.840
through its technique, it can also correct

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:30.400
the other candle which is not yet enlightened,

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.000
and then can enlighten.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.640
It can do everything!

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:41.760
But the technique of that is to be understood very easily

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.760
because you become

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.400
a collectively conscious personality.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.840
You become, again I say, you become. You become another personality.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.000
Like an egg becomes a bird. That's how you become.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.280
Then the bird has to just learn how to fly.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.360
But how does a …

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.960
what is the technique for the egg to become the bird?

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:15.160
It's just to be put in the warmth of the mother hen.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.920
No technique, it's all built in. That's the divine technique.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.520
But then you learn the divine technique yourself, how to do it.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.560
All right? So then, once you are realized,

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.320
by very simple method —

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:34.240
which is our job first of all, the job of the realized souls,

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:38.840
like the enlightened light — once that is done for you,

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.120
then you have to do for others.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.920
Then you have to learn the technique.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.360
But unless and until you are enlightened,

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:52.200
you cannot do any technique, because there's no power flowing.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.720
To start this, you have to put it to the mains, isn't it?

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.200
Otherwise no use knowing the technique.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:03.160
If you don't know how to start the car, no use knowing how to drive.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.360
So let us first start it, and then you will learn the driving.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.440
Answered all right now?

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.800
SEEKER: Having started, how long does it take to become realized?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.600
SHRI MATAJI: No, you are realized at the start only. To begin with.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.600
It takes hardly any time. You get realization first, in the sense

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.560
that you become collectively conscious, you become empowered.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.000
But then … it takes hardly any time for some people,

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.880
only six, seven days they can become experts.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.360
That's all, that's sufficient.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.480
Some people take some time,

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:42.280
but depending on what obstructions you have in your centers.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.880
If your centers are obstructed, then it takes little more time.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.000
But if they are not, it doesn't take much time.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.640
You become automatically endowed with that technique.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.960
Now here we have at least fifty percent who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.560
We call them Sahaja Yogis once they become expert, before that not.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.280
At least fifty percent people sitting here are that.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.680
They're just like you, but there's a difference.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.000
If you see, their faces are glowing,

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.760
you won't find any pimples or anything on their faces;

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.640
very soft skin, young looking, fresh; eyes are sparkling.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.920
They are over here.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.680
And that's how you become.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.360
You become the masters of yourself. Because you become the spirit!

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.200
And spirit is the master because it guides you.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.000
All right? We'll work it out.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:44.240
That's a very good question! Why? Because you want it.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.400
That's a good question that really helps everyone.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.960
Should we have it now? All right.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.760
You have been requested to take out your shoes for a purpose,

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.120
there's nothing to insult you or in any way to trouble you

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.560
but to help you all. Because the Mother Earth, you see, helps you.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.840
We have to take the help from the Mother Earth,

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.440
so we put our feet on the Mother Earth.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.960
We must know this Mother Earth helps us the most,

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.480
so we have to put our feet on the Mother Earth,

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:29.680
without much pressure, little apart, not very close to each other.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.840
All right?

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.800
If possible, try to put the whole foot on the Mother Earth,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.560
and sit comfortably.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.960
Now, if there is anything tight, you can little bit loosen it.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.200
If it is too tight. I mean, you should never be uncomfortable,

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.120
because your attention goes …

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.160
if there is any uncomfortable feeling, it goes there.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.520
Also better to take out your spectacles and things

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.600
because it also helps your eyesight.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.960
It helps so many things, so better to take out your spectacles.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.920
Keep it safe somewhere, so your attention is not

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.800
sort of distracted by it.

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.520
It's a very, very simple method which we have to use.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.800
First of all, as I told you — here you can see also —

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.640
yesterday I told you that these centers

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.120
are represented in our fingertips.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.720
Muhammad Sahib has said: “At the time of resurrection,

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.080
your hands will speak.” Very clearly He said it.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.680
And now this what happens: that your fingers,

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.320
they have got sympathetic endings here —

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.280
that much, of course, the medical science also agrees —

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.880
but these actually are your centers here represented.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.280
So — five, six, and seven. Here also five, six, and seven.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.120
On the two sympathetic nervous systems, left and right,

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.760
as you see here.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.720
The gross is the left sympathetic nervous system,

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.760
but the subtle one is called as the Ida Nadi,

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:04.880
which is the one which caters to our desires.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:09.720
The another one, on the right-hand side,

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.960
is the one called as the Pingala Nadi,

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:17.160
which manifests the gross …

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.800
channel

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.920
which represents the right sympathetic nervous system,

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:30.840
which is responsible for the creativity; is the action.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:34.760
So one is for the desire — first we desire, and then we act —

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.880
so this is for the desire, for emotions,

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.960
and the right one is for the action.

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.080
So we use these hands gradually

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:49.480
according to the obstructions we have on our different centers.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:54.080
But first of all we have to put the hands just like this:

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:59.680
little bit open, very comfortably put on your lap;

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:02.120
and you have to close your eyes.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.400
That's very important, you have to close your eyes.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:13.360
Just opposite of mesmerism. Please close your eyes.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.120
Whatever has to happen will happen inside, not outside.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.880
If I say, “Pay attention to yourself inside,” it's impossible.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.920
But it will happen

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:28.440
when some happening takes place,

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.240
and your attention will be attracted inside;

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.560
and that happening is the awakening of the Kundalini.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.840
Please don't open your eyes. If our eyes are open,

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.880
the Kundalini doesn't rise beyond a certain point.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.640
Sometimes She doesn't want to rise at all.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.880
So just keep your eyes shut and put your hands, fingers open,

00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:01.360
little … not upward but downward a little bit.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:25.040
Now, there's a little bit you have to pay attention to:

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.200
don't have to open your eyes,

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:30.760
remember that the left side is the desire.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.360
And the desire is the pure desire

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.040
to become one with the Divine.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.400
This is the purest desire, and that is represented

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.480
by the Kundalini, by this force,

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.080
which is placed in the sacrum bone, or the sacred bone,

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.400
in the triangular bone as they call it.

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.840
Now, the desire has to be kept fixed;

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:02.440
that means the left hand should to be kept as it is.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.240
Now with the right hand we have to work out

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:11.320
the action of clearing our centers.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.360
First of all, please put your right hand on your heart,

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.640
on the left-hand side,

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.680
because in the heart resides your spirit.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.560
It's better to put it under the coat.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.560
And just say …

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.960
or, we should say, ask a question:

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.640
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.080
Ask the question to Me thrice,

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.440
in your heart, ask a question: “Am I the spirit?”

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.640
Thrice.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.960
This is an absolute question.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.760
You are! But at this stage you just ask the question.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.440
You are the spirit, no doubt!

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:16.480
But ask the question: “Mother, am I the spirit?”

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.280
Put both the legs properly on the ground,

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.960
separated from each other little bit.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.600
Now take down this hand

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:38.320
to the left side of your stomach — don't open your eyes —

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.920
left side, and press it little bit with your fingers.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.160
Here is the center

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:51.760
of your guide, your master.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:58.000
Because the spirit is the guide and the master,

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.120
and as you have asked Me the question

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.000
whether you are the spirit,

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.240
you better ask another question here,

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:10.160
saying that “Mother, am I my own master?

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:15.560
Am I my own guru? Am I my own guide?”

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.720
Sincerely ask this question please.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.120
Lower down on the stomach, on the left-hand side, lower down.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.160
Yes. And put the left hand towards Me.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.800
Left hand should be towards Me, which is a fixed point,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.600
which is the desire that you want to become.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:50.320
This question is to be asked ten times, because of Ten Commandments.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.520
Or, there are ten petals to this center.

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:19.080
Now again, raise your right hand to your heart position again,

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:22.200
with your left hand at the same point.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:27.480
Press it a little bit and, again, with full confidence,

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.520
please say for My sake, for your sake

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.760
that “Mother, I am the spirit.”

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.960
Just assert!

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.040
You have to say it twelve times.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.800
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:27.600
As the spirit is detached,

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.160
is blemishless,

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.080
it cannot commit any mistakes,

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.040
it cannot have any guilt.

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.680
So raise the same hand, right hand — left hand keeping the same way —

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:44.400
to the left-side base of the neck.

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.000
To the left-side base of the neck;

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.960
it's very important, specially for western people

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.240
because they always feel guilty, for nothing at all.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.240
You are not to feel guilty!

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:03.280
So, as you are the spirit, you have to say, “Mother,

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.640
I am not guilty.”

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:12.320
You have to say this sixteen times please. “Mother, I am not guilty.”

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.800
You are the spirit, and how can spirit be guilty?

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.400
Don't feel any guilt about anything whatever you have done,

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.080
the past is past. At this moment please say,

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:28.440
“Mother, I am not guilty, because I am the spirit.”

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.080
And what is your guilt after all,

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.080
compared to the forgiveness of God's love?

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.480
Because He's the ocean of forgiveness,

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:41.760
He's the ocean of compassion,

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:45.680
He's the ocean of love.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:53.760
Now raise the same hand. Put the left hand towards Me,

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:57.480
that is important; you must keep the left hand towards Me on the lap,

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.680
fixed.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:04.840
Say it sixteen times please.

00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.480
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Please say it with full confidence,

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:16.360
is very important, I tell you. Most of you catch on that center.

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:29.800
Now raise your right hand above

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.520
onto your forehead, across.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.720
Just put it there.

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:41.400
At this point, you have to forgive everyone.

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:44.240
Just forgive everyone!

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.600
Everyone you have to forgive. Put it across.

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.840
Some people say it's difficult.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.800
It's a myth that we do not forgive,

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.040
because what do we do when we don't forgive?

00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.600
So just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.800
Sincerely please say that “Mother, I really forgive everyone.”

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.760
You have to just say it twice.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:11.800
But it is to be said from your heart, then it will work out.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.040
Now put this hand, after saying that, on top of your head,

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.600
at the place where it was soft bone in your childhood,

00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:25.080
press it with your palm and just try to turn your head

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:28.080
in a clockwise manner, pressing it.

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:32.200
Just press it and turn it a little bit in the clockwise manner.

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.880
Press it with your palm, press it with your palm at the point

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.960
where it was soft when you were a child.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.680
At this point, I have to say, I am helpless;

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:50.280
if you do not want to have your realization,

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.360
I cannot force it through. Because, as I told you,

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:56.520
you have been given your freedom, which is respected.

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.840
So here you have to say, “Mother, I want my realization,

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.680
please give me realization.”

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.760
Unless and until you say that definitely,

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.440
I cannot cross the barrier of your freedom.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.320
So please say it clearly in your heart seven times:

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:18.240
“Mother, please give me my Self-realization.”

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.640
Seven times please.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.280
Say it from your heart. Say, it, from, your, heart.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.960
Very sincerely, that's important.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.480
Earnestly you have to say that.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.320
Now raise your hand and see if there is a cool breeze coming out;

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.400
or if there is a hot thing coming out:

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.440
maybe some people will get heat first.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.320
You can change over the hand and see from the other hand,

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.400
and put the right hand towards Me.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.320
You can see if there is a cool breeze coming in,

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.560
or a hot breeze coming in.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.400
Why don't you see?

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.720
It's there, it's there, it's there!

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.080
Put your hand like this, right hand … like this … when … yes …

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.000
also … and now you see. It's there? All right, gradually.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.840
Now you turn. Again see another hand.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.400
Just try with another hand, you see?

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.840
Again change over and see for yourself.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.480
This will help you to get a balance.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.400
If you are feeling in your head,

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.200
then see if you are feeling in your hands as well.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.080
Put your hands towards Me. See now if you are feeling in your hands.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.400
She's got it. You've got it, yes!

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.640
If you put up your hands like this — open your eyes —

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.480
just like this,

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.800
you start feeling it in your hands: a little cool breeze

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.600
or a movement downward. Start first feeling it.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.080
Are you? Good, good.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.520
Some of you have a center caught up there.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.400
All right?

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.680
Feeling it? Now bring it down and see for yourself

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.880
if you are feeling it in your hands.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.280
Mm, very relaxed.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.680
Are you? Good. What about you, sir?

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.160
Not yet? We will work out. (To a yogi) Just see…

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.720
Now, there are Sahaja Yogis here who are sitting,

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.840
who can help you also, those who have not felt it.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.960
It will work out, it is going to work out.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.560
It has worked in this lady: face is changed, looking so much younger.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.600
You too.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.720
What about you now? This gentleman, are you feeling now?

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.120
He's got just a Hamsa Chakra, this one.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.360
The one who came to Louise? Not yet?

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.200
It's all right, it will work out. Now, don't lose patience.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.600
You must have patience with yourself.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.000
Please close your eyes, just close your eyes.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.640
It's going to work out.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.480
There! Now just watch Me without thinking. Let's see can you do it.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.680
All right?

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.560
What about these people?

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.240
Aah, that's better!
