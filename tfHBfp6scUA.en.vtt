00:46.680 --> 00:52.240
Today it's such a pleasure to be here again,

00:52.440 --> 00:54.920
in Brighton;

00:55.120 --> 00:58.880
and, slowly and steadily, I find

00:59.080 --> 01:04.040
Sahaja Yoga is settling down in this place.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.640
When I first came to Brighton just to visit,

01:09.880 --> 01:15.880
I felt there must be many seekers in this place,

01:16.600 --> 01:19.600
who might have been lost

01:20.800 --> 01:25.640
and always had a great hope

01:25.840 --> 01:31.840
that one day they will be able to come to reality.

01:34.080 --> 01:39.120
Today specially is a very great day

01:39.320 --> 01:45.320
because today is the birthday of Lord Buddha.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.600
And in the morning, I talked to Sahaja Yogis

01:48.800 --> 01:51.560
about His great incarnation,

01:51.760 --> 01:54.520
and how He came on this earth

01:54.720 --> 01:58.200
and He got His realization,

01:58.400 --> 02:00.600
and then how He tried to spread

02:00.800 --> 02:04.800
the message of realizations to others.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.680
Many people believe and think

02:07.880 --> 02:12.480
that Christ was an atheist … Buddha was an atheist,

02:12.680 --> 02:18.680
while Christ was a person, believer in God.

02:19.600 --> 02:25.600
And some people prefer Buddha to Jesus Christ.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.720
It's something very amazing is that …

02:32.440 --> 02:35.000
that when the people are born

02:35.200 --> 02:38.440
in the particular circumstances,

02:38.640 --> 02:41.320
they have to talk about things

02:41.520 --> 02:46.720
which are very, very important at that point of time.

02:46.920 --> 02:52.600
At the time when Buddha came on this earth in India,

02:52.800 --> 02:57.160
we had too many ritualism of Brahmanism

02:57.360 --> 03:03.360
and conditioning of the teachings

03:03.840 --> 03:07.800
of those money-makers and commercializers

03:08.000 --> 03:13.160
who wanted to make money in the name of God

03:13.360 --> 03:16.800
and in the name of religion.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.320
So, to neutralize all that,

03:19.520 --> 03:25.040
He decided not to talk at all, at all about

03:27.080 --> 03:30.080
God,

03:30.440 --> 03:35.840
about any particular religious ways,

03:36.040 --> 03:40.160
but He said that you keep to the middle path of life,

03:40.360 --> 03:43.160
eightfold middle path of life,

03:43.360 --> 03:47.280
and that you first get your Self-realization.

03:47.480 --> 03:53.480
To Him it was very important that one should get Self-realization.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
And that's what

03:58.680 --> 04:02.200
He wanted to give as a message

04:02.800 --> 04:06.480
and divert the attention of the people

04:06.680 --> 04:10.960
from the idea of God or incarnation —

04:11.520 --> 04:13.440
for the time being —

04:13.640 --> 04:18.720
because He wanted to show that Self-realization is very important

04:18.920 --> 04:22.280
and that without Self-realization you cannot understand God

04:22.480 --> 04:25.480
or Divine Power.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.920
So He was not an atheist.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.080
He and Christ, I would say, were in a way contemporary,

04:40.280 --> 04:46.280
but Christ came later,

04:47.720 --> 04:52.280
and Buddha came about five hundred years before Christ.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.200
They are so much related to each other,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.840
so much close to each other,

04:58.040 --> 05:00.400
so much identified with each other,

05:00.600 --> 05:03.800
as if they are part and parcel of one being.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.600
That only you can understand when you get your Self-realization.

05:08.800 --> 05:13.000
Christ has said: “Those who are not against Me are with Me.”

05:13.200 --> 05:17.400
Who are “those”, who are not against Him?

05:19.000 --> 05:24.040
Because we have no knowledge as to real the origin of Christ,

05:24.240 --> 05:26.640
from where He came, what was His origin,

05:26.840 --> 05:28.880
how He was created in the heaven,

05:29.080 --> 05:32.680
how He is the Son of God.

05:32.880 --> 05:37.640
Whatever we see today as a person who came on this earth

05:37.840 --> 05:43.200
to teach us about His father, God Almighty,

05:44.440 --> 05:47.680
we just believe into that part,

05:47.880 --> 05:50.880
which is a very limited part of Christ,

05:51.080 --> 05:54.800
and Bible cannot contain that great personality.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.760
In the same way, Buddha has been dumped

05:58.960 --> 06:02.920
into very small dimensions.

06:03.480 --> 06:07.840
Only two persons realized it; they got out of it.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.400
One of them was Viditama,

06:10.600 --> 06:14.920
who went away to Japan and started the Zen system of religion.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.240
But even today if you see the Zen,

06:17.440 --> 06:20.120
which was nothing but dhyana, the meditation,

06:20.320 --> 06:24.360
sahaja, spontaneous awakening —

06:25.040 --> 06:30.760
is reduced to the same level as any other preaching.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.440
I met the head of the Zen system.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.640
He was very sick, and they brought him to Me

06:36.840 --> 06:38.600
because he wanted to be cured.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.320
And I was amazed that, not that he was a realized soul,

06:43.520 --> 06:48.880
not at all a realized soul — but his Kundalini, which is the force

06:49.080 --> 06:51.960
which is going to give him realization was all frozen.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.880
And he had no desire to become self-realized.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.360
I talked to him, I was amazed.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.400
And I said, “How is it,

07:00.600 --> 07:03.680
that according to Zen you have to be a kashyapa?”

07:03.880 --> 07:08.560
Kashyapa means a person who is a realized soul.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.760
That's the name of the university, as I told you yesterday in Lewes,

07:12.960 --> 07:14.720
is the name of the university is kashyapa:

07:14.920 --> 07:17.360
those who have no university,

07:17.560 --> 07:20.680
in the sense, those who have the university of God.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.360
So he said, “Oh, that's over now,

07:22.560 --> 07:25.160
God is not making anybody kashyapas now.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.800
Only from the sixth to the eighth century,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.040
in two hundred years, there were only twenty-six kashyapas,

07:31.240 --> 07:34.960
after that there were none. And I don't hope to be one.”

07:35.160 --> 07:36.440
I said, “Why not?”

07:36.640 --> 07:38.640
He said, “No, I have no hopes about it,

07:38.840 --> 07:42.680
I'm just now appointed as the head of Zen, so I'm there,

07:42.880 --> 07:45.840
but we don't get kashyapas these days at all.”

07:46.040 --> 07:48.440
So with that he doomed all the hopes

07:48.640 --> 07:51.280
of all the people to become Zen,

07:51.480 --> 07:54.440
to become person who knows,

07:54.640 --> 07:58.040
person who is a realized soul.

07:58.240 --> 08:03.440
This one was very shocking to Me

08:03.640 --> 08:08.000
because Zen is something so great.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.560
There's so much expressive of Sahaja Yoga.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.720
You cannot understand Zen unless and until you are a realized soul.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.240
Even Bible you can't understand, you can't understand Gita,

08:19.440 --> 08:21.080
you can't understand anything

08:21.280 --> 08:24.080
unless and until you are a realized soul.

08:24.280 --> 08:28.280
The second person who really emerged out of it,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.000
all this ritualism and all that

08:30.200 --> 08:33.480
that they had created out of Buddha's life,

08:33.680 --> 08:37.400
was Lao Tze,

08:37.640 --> 08:39.600
who preached about Tao.

08:39.800 --> 08:43.640
Tao is the all-pervading Divine Power.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.520
Power of love.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.800
When He talked about it, He explained about it,

08:51.000 --> 08:56.400
and He started another group of people,

08:56.600 --> 08:59.240
who were to be given realization.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.720
But that also today, I find, has become “Tao-ism”.

09:02.920 --> 09:06.400
Everything becomes “ism” — means “imprisoned”.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.160
It's not living, it's not there,

09:10.360 --> 09:12.640
it's just a thought of Tao people read.

09:12.840 --> 09:16.680
I have seen people … there's one gentleman in India

09:16.880 --> 09:19.400
who has written a complete book on Tao.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.840
He's not even a realized soul.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.800
What is he writing? I was just wondering, with his blind eyes,

09:25.000 --> 09:29.600
what is he describing, what colors can he describe?

09:29.880 --> 09:33.600
So you must know that you have to be self-realized first.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.280
Then see for yourself.

09:36.480 --> 09:42.440
Then you will know whether there is spirit or not,

09:42.640 --> 09:45.680
then you will know whether there are roots

09:45.880 --> 09:50.800
to this tree that has grown outside,

09:51.800 --> 09:55.840
then you will know where there is God or not.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.960
Then you will know what these incarnations

09:59.160 --> 10:01.280
have any meaning or not.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.800
Just before that just to sit down and criticize

10:05.000 --> 10:07.440
is not a sensible thing.

10:07.640 --> 10:12.600
That's why Buddha … who occupies a very special place

10:12.800 --> 10:16.440
within our being itself, He resides on this side.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.960
This is the place where our ego is attached,

10:20.160 --> 10:24.960
and He is the one who really controls our ego.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.360
So this Buddha

10:28.560 --> 10:32.720
also is such a part and parcel,

10:32.920 --> 10:37.240
is to be understood only after you have got realization.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.240
Without that you are still incomplete.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.920
You are not that by which you will know.

10:46.120 --> 10:50.720
Like Krishna has said: “Atmanyevatmana tushtah” [BhG 2-55].

10:50.920 --> 10:55.080
Through the atma, through the spirit only you are going to know God.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.520
Not through with this mental projection,

10:57.720 --> 11:00.840
with these eyes, with these senses but through the spirit.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.160
And where is the spirit within us?

11:04.800 --> 11:07.360
The spirit lies in our heart

11:07.560 --> 11:12.160
and is the reflection of God Almighty.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.800
It's called as a kshetragya,

11:16.000 --> 11:20.080
means “the one who knows the field of our action”.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.960
The one who sees what we are doing,

11:24.160 --> 11:28.440
who is the witness of what we are doing.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.840
But He is not in our attention.

11:33.240 --> 11:37.520
That gentleman wants to come, please come.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.680
He is not in our attention.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.760
And if He is not in our attention,

11:45.960 --> 11:49.480
we do not know how to connect

11:51.240 --> 11:54.160
ourselves with Him to have a rapport with Him,

11:54.360 --> 11:56.000
to understand Him.

11:56.200 --> 12:01.600
That's why first this spirit has to be brought in our own attention.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.960
That's the most important thing,

12:04.160 --> 12:08.240
and because this is not with us,

12:08.440 --> 12:12.640
we are still incomplete, we make mistakes.

12:12.840 --> 12:17.280
Because the absolute thing that is within us is the spirit,

12:17.480 --> 12:20.040
while we live on a relative world.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.360
Today somebody comes and says to  you all right.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.680
Just now, when we were coming, there was a gentleman

12:24.880 --> 12:28.520
who handed over a card to Me,

12:28.720 --> 12:31.000
about … something about Christ.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.640
He's telling Me about Christ, I really must laugh at it.

12:34.840 --> 12:39.200
But supposing tomorrow Christ comes and stands before you;

12:39.400 --> 12:44.440
will you be able to recognize Him, or will you crucify Him again?

12:44.840 --> 12:48.040
How will you recognize Him? How will you recognize Buddha?

12:48.240 --> 12:54.240
Have you got sensitivity to know who is Christ?

12:55.000 --> 12:58.320
It's very easy to, you see, to represent Christ,

12:58.520 --> 13:00.280
it's very easy because they think

13:00.480 --> 13:04.360
that, after all, you see, everybody has a right to do what they like.

13:04.560 --> 13:09.480
Even Hitler talked of God, can you imagine?

13:09.680 --> 13:11.800
Hitler talked of God!

13:12.000 --> 13:17.360
Everyone thinks he has got right to talk of God, to describe Him!

13:17.560 --> 13:20.680
But first of all you must know

13:20.880 --> 13:25.120
that no use deceiving ourselves,

13:25.320 --> 13:29.520
we have to get our Self-realization.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.600
We have to know ourselves first of all.

13:34.160 --> 13:38.040
Now, Buddha's attitude towards His attainment was

13:38.240 --> 13:41.560
that He was actually

13:45.640 --> 13:48.320
touched by the miseries of the world.

13:48.520 --> 13:54.520
He saw a person who was sick. He saw a man who was dead.

13:54.760 --> 13:58.640
He saw an old man. All these things worked on His mind,

13:58.840 --> 14:03.120
and He started thinking: “Why these miseries are there?”

14:03.320 --> 14:07.880
So the whole search came

14:08.080 --> 14:14.080
through the understanding for others.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.640
That takes too much time because you have to go on neutralizing:

14:18.840 --> 14:23.920
“Not this, not this, not wife, not children, not family…”

14:24.120 --> 14:26.680
You go on negating, negating, negating;

14:26.880 --> 14:32.240
all your lives you go on, one after another. Doesn't work out.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.200
The other way is simpler — could be …

14:35.400 --> 14:38.000
which of course by Buddha's attainment only

14:38.200 --> 14:40.000
has been made even better …

14:40.200 --> 14:44.000
all of them have done something for us within ourselves —

14:44.200 --> 14:48.680
that first we look after ourselves,

14:48.880 --> 14:51.480
find out about ourselves.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.640
Are we realized souls?

14:55.840 --> 14:58.840
Are we Buddhas?

14:59.160 --> 15:02.960
Are we the people who know?

15:04.440 --> 15:06.880
Let us be honest.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.720
Then we have to know.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.920
Now, what is the way to know is the point.

15:16.040 --> 15:22.040
Now, if I say that you will know — in your evolutionary process.

15:23.640 --> 15:27.280
As you have evolved to be a human being, you will be evolved

15:27.480 --> 15:30.000
to be a realized soul.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.840
But there's a little difference as to what has happened so far

15:35.040 --> 15:38.800
and what is going to happen later on.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.520
So far, we have been evolved

15:45.240 --> 15:50.400
through a method which was beyond

15:51.080 --> 15:54.080
our freedom.

15:54.920 --> 15:59.680
The nature worked it out, the nature within us,

16:00.400 --> 16:04.160
the central force of evolution within us

16:04.360 --> 16:07.880
has brought us to this position that from amoeba

16:08.080 --> 16:11.320
today we are human beings.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.640
But at this stage, when we are human beings,

16:14.840 --> 16:20.840
to go further, there's a special mechanism.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.840
Like, till to make this instrument,

16:26.040 --> 16:30.520
we had to use other instruments to make it.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.120
Now, once the instrument is just ready,

16:34.320 --> 16:40.320
we have to just plug this one to the mains, and it's done.

16:40.720 --> 16:44.120
As if you are made

16:44.960 --> 16:47.960
to be ready

16:48.200 --> 16:53.200
to be plugged to the all-pervading Power;

16:53.400 --> 16:59.400
and by some special, spontaneous method

17:00.120 --> 17:03.200
done by the living force within us,

17:03.400 --> 17:07.240
we have to be plugged to the mains.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.040
But the difference

17:13.240 --> 17:19.240
between a human being and other animals

17:19.640 --> 17:25.040
is this that human beings were given their freedom.

17:26.080 --> 17:30.960
At the stage of, say, Adam and Eve,

17:31.160 --> 17:36.640
if people would not have gone too far with their freedom,

17:36.880 --> 17:38.920
it would have been much easier

17:39.120 --> 17:42.920
to give realization to people at that time.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.600
But when freedom is given,

17:47.120 --> 17:52.120
then people misuse it. Or, they want to use it.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.840
They don't want to obey, because to obey means, they think,

17:56.040 --> 17:58.160
there is no freedom.

17:58.360 --> 18:02.160
And that's how, when they started using their freedom,

18:02.360 --> 18:06.640
they had to do things which were wrong,

18:06.840 --> 18:12.280
which were anti-life, which were anti-evolution,

18:13.360 --> 18:17.360
without realizing what they were doing.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.360
When it reached the stage

18:22.920 --> 18:27.200
when people found that was wrong, they gave it up.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.520
Then another thing they tried,

18:30.720 --> 18:34.280
it was like an error being corrected.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.240
Then they corrected it.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.600
That's how human beings have been trying,

18:38.800 --> 18:43.040
experimenting with this, experimenting with that;

18:44.280 --> 18:47.280
and then they come to a point where they say, “Given up now,

18:47.480 --> 18:50.160
it's too much.”

18:50.360 --> 18:54.560
That's the best point, I think, as Buddha had reached;

18:54.760 --> 19:00.760
He was so tired, lying down under a banyan tree —

19:01.760 --> 19:04.960
and He got His realization.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.880
So now I am here before you to tell you

19:10.080 --> 19:12.720
what is the mechanism.

19:12.920 --> 19:18.120
You should not in any case accept Me fully, you should not.

19:18.320 --> 19:22.800
That would be wrong on My part and wrong on your part

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
because you're free, you are free, not to accept or to accept.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.080
But you have to keep yourself open

19:30.280 --> 19:34.080
because this is a new category of knowledge

19:34.280 --> 19:37.640
which I am telling you about.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.160
About the roots, about which you do not know.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.400
You know only about the tree,

19:43.600 --> 19:46.560
but I want to tell you about the roots.

19:46.760 --> 19:51.480
The best thing would be, first and foremost,

19:52.280 --> 19:56.520
to be able to enter into the roots.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.720
But you cannot!

20:00.240 --> 20:03.000
As the human mind is,

20:03.200 --> 20:07.560
it wants to know everything about everything first of all.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.480
But see, here,

20:10.680 --> 20:14.560
if you have to enter into this room

20:16.440 --> 20:19.720
and there is no light, somebody tells you,

20:19.920 --> 20:23.000
“All right, press that button and you get all the lights.”

20:23.200 --> 20:25.600
And you do it!

20:25.800 --> 20:29.320
It's all built in there, it's just there.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.000
But if somebody starts telling, “All right, I'll tell you

20:33.200 --> 20:35.880
there is something called electricity.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.680
Now, that was discovered such and such era,

20:39.880 --> 20:41.520
then there was this gentleman,

20:41.720 --> 20:44.400
who discovered this part of electricity,

20:44.600 --> 20:51.160
then we used the water power to generate the electricity,

20:51.360 --> 20:53.440
and that's how there was a committee was formed” —

20:53.640 --> 20:58.080
and the whole history about the Sussex electrical system.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.320
Then you'll say, “Now, we are fed up, now will you stop it!”

21:02.520 --> 21:04.960
It's like that.

21:05.160 --> 21:09.560
So, if I have to tell you the whole history, it will be too much.

21:09.760 --> 21:14.160
Best thing would be to press the button, see the light, enjoy it,

21:14.360 --> 21:18.200
and then you can know about it if you want to know.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.400
If you want to!

21:22.480 --> 21:27.680
It is just like that. The knowledge of the roots

21:28.720 --> 21:33.560
is greater than the knowledge of the tree.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.280
But unless and until you know how to become that subtle

21:38.480 --> 21:41.480
to enter into the roots,

21:41.680 --> 21:44.760
whatever I talk is Greek and Latin,

21:44.960 --> 21:50.400
or, for you people, I would say, is like Sanskrit language.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.960
But still, I'll try to explain to you few things

21:57.160 --> 22:01.240
that lie within ourselves.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.960
But by listening to that,

22:04.160 --> 22:08.320
I want to tell you, you cannot get your realization.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.720
Whatever I may talk for hours together,

22:10.920 --> 22:13.360
you will not get your realization.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.960
It's a happening that has to take place within you.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.280
Unless and until this happening takes place,

22:19.480 --> 22:21.920
you cannot get your realization.

22:22.120 --> 22:27.680
And it's a happening which is to be experienced by you, not by Me.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.280
It is to be felt by you,

22:30.480 --> 22:35.680
and by this happening you have to feel your own powers,

22:35.880 --> 22:40.120
your own glory, and your own purpose.

22:40.320 --> 22:45.480
So far, we do not know the purpose of human life,

22:45.680 --> 22:49.280
why human beings were created from amoeba stage.

22:49.480 --> 22:54.280
But then you know what is the purpose of this life.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.200
I'm sure they must have told you something about Kundalini.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.400
Jason, did you tell them?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.840
Not much?

23:06.240 --> 23:07.840
YOGI: Very little, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: Eh?

23:08.040 --> 23:09.800
YOGI: Very little, Mother.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.920
SHRI MATAJI: What's he saying?
YOGI: That he [UNCLEAR] very little.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.040
SHRI MATAJI: All right.

23:15.240 --> 23:20.160
So now here I would like to tell you something about it,

23:20.400 --> 23:23.640
which you should take as a hypothesis just now

23:23.840 --> 23:28.080
and try to understand. It's not very difficult, to begin with.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.760
And later on, as soon as you get your realization,

23:30.960 --> 23:33.960
it's the easiest thing to do.

23:34.480 --> 23:38.360
We have within ourselves seven centers,

23:38.560 --> 23:43.600
placed in our medulla oblongata and in the brain.

23:43.800 --> 23:48.080
The first one lies below the triangular bone,

23:48.280 --> 23:50.320
which is called as sacrum,

23:50.520 --> 23:53.200
and it's called as the Mooladhara center,

23:53.400 --> 23:58.840
which means “the support of the roots”.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.960
It is the support of the roots.

24:02.160 --> 24:08.160
And this center embodies our innocence.

24:08.840 --> 24:14.080
The second one … and of course it manifests outside in the gross,

24:14.280 --> 24:17.120
the pelvic plexus.

24:17.320 --> 24:22.240
Now, the second one is the one that emerges from the third one,

24:22.440 --> 24:27.800
which is called as the Nabhi Chakra, the third one;

24:28.160 --> 24:32.400
and the one that emerges from that

24:32.600 --> 24:36.680
is the second one, called as the Swadishthana.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.480
Now, the Swadishthana Chakra in the gross —

24:39.680 --> 24:42.360
because these are subtle centers, in the medulla oblongata —

24:42.560 --> 24:48.320
but outside, in the gross, it manifests

24:48.520 --> 24:51.040
what we call the aortic plexus.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.360
If there are doctors here, they'll understand what I'm talking about.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.800
Now, if you go further,

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
the Nabhi Chakra manifests outside what we call as the solar plexus.

25:04.360 --> 25:09.720
Above that is the center that we call as the Heart center,

25:09.920 --> 25:13.160
Anahata Chakra, cardiac center,

25:13.360 --> 25:16.280
which manifests outside

25:16.480 --> 25:19.520
the cardiac plexus.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.560
And it has got, again, the left and right side.

25:23.840 --> 25:29.480
Then we have the center at the root of our neck,

25:29.680 --> 25:32.120
which is called as the Vishuddhi Chakra

25:32.320 --> 25:35.640
and which manifests outside

25:36.160 --> 25:39.800
the cervical plexus.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.520
Above that, here where you see the red mark on My head —

25:43.720 --> 25:46.520
this is just the window of that center —

25:46.720 --> 25:49.360
between the pituitary and the pineal body,

25:49.560 --> 25:53.320
where the optic chiasma cross each other in the center,

25:53.520 --> 25:58.000
is a very important center called as Agnya Chakra,

25:58.200 --> 26:02.280
which looks after our ego and our superego,

26:02.480 --> 26:05.160
which you can see there passing through that,

26:05.360 --> 26:07.520
crossing over like that.

26:07.720 --> 26:11.240
And on the top of that is the last seventh center,

26:11.440 --> 26:14.320
called as the Sahasrara,

26:14.520 --> 26:17.800
meaning “one thousand petals center”.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
And that's the center …

26:20.200 --> 26:23.800
is just in the limbic area,

26:24.000 --> 26:29.600
and when you pierce through that in the fontanelle area,

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
you feel the cool breeze of the Kundalini, or the Holy Ghost,

26:35.200 --> 26:38.200
coming out of your head.

26:38.440 --> 26:41.800
This has to happen.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.560
You cannot give false certificates.

26:45.760 --> 26:49.880
You have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

26:50.080 --> 26:53.720
You have to feel the cool breeze in your hands;

26:53.920 --> 26:59.600
that means you have to feel the all-pervading Power of God,

27:00.040 --> 27:01.400
of Love,

27:01.600 --> 27:05.160
which is called as Brahma Shakti in Sanskrit language

27:05.360 --> 27:11.000
and in the Bible is called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.680
For the first time you have to feel it

27:14.880 --> 27:19.720
in your hands, in your central nervous system.

27:19.920 --> 27:24.880
Because the seat of your spirit is here,

27:25.080 --> 27:28.880
but the spirit resides in the heart.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.440
Once the seat is touched by the awakened Kundalini —

27:32.640 --> 27:35.840
which is in the triangular bone, if you see —

27:36.040 --> 27:38.640
then you start feeling

27:38.840 --> 27:42.720
the first the cool breeze and then in the hand,

27:42.920 --> 27:46.600
you start feeling the cool breeze flowing from you.

27:46.800 --> 27:52.280
Thus you manifest the power of your spirit.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.960
It's a happening that has to take place. It's a living happening.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.320
It's very easy to tell people, “All right, now you start jumping.”

28:01.520 --> 28:04.120
You see, anybody can jump, what's so great in jumping?

28:04.320 --> 28:06.400
Or if somebody says, “All right, take out your clothes.”

28:06.600 --> 28:09.880
What's so great? Or, “Color your clothes in this way.”

28:10.080 --> 28:12.800
Nothing so special, anybody can do it.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.440
But can you take out cool breeze out of your head?

28:19.680 --> 28:22.160
Your own head.

28:22.360 --> 28:26.320
And when you get it, you can do it to others.

28:26.520 --> 28:30.640
Even from the others' heads you can take it out.

28:31.080 --> 28:35.600
This is the way it has to happen, the time has come.

28:35.800 --> 28:40.560
This is a very special time, when so many seekers are born,

28:40.760 --> 28:45.360
so many of them, in millions and millions of them;

28:45.560 --> 28:48.920
and so many are lost also,

28:49.120 --> 28:53.200
because of various reasons, because of attack on them.

28:53.400 --> 28:58.120
From very childhood, a person who is a seeker is attacked.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.680
Ultimately, his ego can attack.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.440
He may have his own mental projections built in,

29:04.640 --> 29:07.880
he may have horrible gurus, taking out money from him.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.720
And there'll be people … will be maneuvering them,

29:10.920 --> 29:13.960
there'll be people who'll be creating projection things

29:14.160 --> 29:17.120
just to engulf them.

29:17.320 --> 29:21.160
But to an Indian, it is easy — if they are Indians, of course;

29:21.360 --> 29:24.960
if they are uprooted people and all are westernized, then I can't say.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.280
But to a normal Indian, they know

29:27.480 --> 29:30.840
it is the Kundalini awakening that gives you realization.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.480
I don't have to tell them that this is so.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.280
They know. They are not naive.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.360
But in the Bible also it is written

29:39.560 --> 29:43.600
that “I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

29:43.800 --> 29:46.440
and actually, when you see the Sahasrara,

29:46.640 --> 29:51.480
it looks likes beautiful flames in seven colors,

29:51.680 --> 29:54.360
most harmless, silently;

29:54.560 --> 29:57.800
like this flame

29:58.000 --> 30:01.120
but very longish flames,

30:01.320 --> 30:05.200
and silently burning and opening out,

30:05.400 --> 30:07.640
very cooling flames.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.240
Even this flame can give you cool breeze.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.080
It has happened with many;

30:13.280 --> 30:15.800
and how it works out, that we have to see.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.760
It's fantastic! It's too much to believe.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.480
First of all, we have no faith in ourselves,

30:22.680 --> 30:25.560
we don't know how can we get realization so easily.

30:25.760 --> 30:28.960
People had to do this, people had to do that.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.200
But time has come.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.320
You have done everything in your previous lives.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.520
You have starved yourself,

30:38.080 --> 30:40.240
you have roamed about,

30:40.440 --> 30:42.960
you have done all the tapasyas, the penance,

30:43.160 --> 30:47.360
and today is the time for you to get realization.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.400
And that's what it is.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.000
But why doubt it? You don't have to pay for it.

30:53.200 --> 30:57.200
Nothing is selling here, you know that. Nothing is selling.

30:57.400 --> 31:02.480
Actually, you cannot sell God. You cannot sell God!

31:02.680 --> 31:06.640
Those who sell are committing sins.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.480
How can you sell love?

31:10.680 --> 31:13.480
Love is not a saleable quality.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.880
Then the love of God, how can you sell?

31:17.080 --> 31:20.160
But we are so attracted by commercializing and all that.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.760
Because everything is so commercialized.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.480
And so traditional now that, for people

31:25.680 --> 31:28.240
who says that you cannot pay for your realization,

31:28.440 --> 31:31.920
they just can't understand how can it be.

31:32.200 --> 31:35.160
Get out of this, get out of it!

31:35.360 --> 31:40.360
And just know that commercializing is a sin

31:40.560 --> 31:46.000
if you try to do that in the realm of Divine.

31:46.200 --> 31:50.120
It's a sinful thing. Anybody who has done that is wrong.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.160
Christ had taken a big hunter and hit all those people

31:53.360 --> 31:59.120
who were selling near that church. That's what it is.

31:59.320 --> 32:02.160
Today we find in all the churches, all the temples,

32:02.360 --> 32:06.120
mosques and everywhere — are nothing but commercializing.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.960
But that doesn't mean that those people

32:09.160 --> 32:13.800
who propounded those great ideals

32:14.000 --> 32:16.800
to balance yourself

32:17.000 --> 32:20.120
on your Void as we call it —

32:20.320 --> 32:26.320
they gave you the Ten Commandments to balance yourself —

32:26.680 --> 32:28.800
that they were wrong,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.560
that they did it just as a mental projection.

32:32.760 --> 32:35.760
It's a fact, you have to balance yourself!

32:35.960 --> 32:38.320
All of them tried to balance you,

32:38.520 --> 32:41.840
gave you a method of moderation.

32:42.040 --> 32:46.040
For what is this moderation?

32:46.240 --> 32:48.160
Is for the ascent.

32:48.360 --> 32:52.120
If you do not have balance in life, you cannot move.

32:52.320 --> 32:56.720
Imagine a car going on two wheels on one side.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.640
Even if there's a bicycle, you have to balance it.

33:00.840 --> 33:04.760
You just can't ride a bicycle if you don't know how to balance it.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.360
So this balance was to be established, and that's why

33:08.560 --> 33:13.720
they propounded all these great ideals for all of you.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.880
And all this is for your ascent

33:18.080 --> 33:21.520
and not to be just settled down with that balance.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.680
You have to ascend, and that ascent

33:25.880 --> 33:30.280
is now very simple and easy

33:30.480 --> 33:32.440
because the time has come.

33:32.640 --> 33:37.560
As I told you yesterday, on the tree of life

33:37.760 --> 33:42.800
there were very, very few flowers to begin with.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.160
But today, at the blossom time, there are so many seekers.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.240
A special category, the flowers as they call it.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.080
They are flowers, no doubt;

33:54.280 --> 33:58.560
when they called them flowers, it was true they were flowers —

33:58.960 --> 34:02.560
but they went into wrong direction.

34:02.760 --> 34:07.720
They were definitely flowers to become fruits.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.320
And they will, God willing,

34:10.520 --> 34:13.920
all of them will have to become the fruits.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.120
May God bless you all!

34:19.680 --> 34:23.000
I always ask people to ask Me questions,

34:23.200 --> 34:27.240
but that doesn't mean that you should go on

34:27.560 --> 34:31.520
taking time unnecessarily.

34:31.880 --> 34:37.880
And, also, mentally, I can just satisfy you up to a point

34:38.360 --> 34:41.480
because the mind cannot cross the barriers.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.200
It has to be triggered into a space

34:45.400 --> 34:47.880
of thoughtless awareness.

34:48.080 --> 34:53.400
And what you understand through your mind

34:53.600 --> 34:58.200
is only the signboard,

34:58.400 --> 35:02.240
which you can read; but you have to enter inside,

35:02.440 --> 35:06.120
and for that, the ascent has to take place.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.320
That's important.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.000
The other day in the university there was only one person

35:11.200 --> 35:12.880
who asked many questions.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.280
And he was the one who didn't ascend,

35:15.480 --> 35:17.840
the rest of them all ascended.

35:18.040 --> 35:21.240
It's very sad. And we have to work on him, of course;

35:21.440 --> 35:24.600
he is going to ascend because he wants to ascend.

35:24.800 --> 35:29.640
But the questions went on like that, and such a waste of time.

35:30.200 --> 35:33.800
Because you are earnest seekers and truthful seekers,

35:34.000 --> 35:39.280
please ask questions which will help everyone.

35:39.480 --> 35:42.480
We have to be kind to everyone.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.680
May God bless you!

36:05.480 --> 36:08.840
If you have any questions, please ask Me.

36:14.920 --> 36:15.720
Yes?

36:15.920 --> 36:18.240
SEEKER: [UNCLEAR], is it dangerous

36:18.440 --> 36:22.480
to split a mental cord? [INAUDIBLE]

36:25.440 --> 36:30.520
SHRI MATAJI: Now, can you tell Me what he's saying?

36:31.200 --> 36:35.160
Just tell it. I'll see, I have to be able to answer.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.080
YOGI: Is it dangerous to split thoughts?

36:44.280 --> 36:46.520
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, no! We are not splitting it.

36:46.720 --> 36:51.120
You are sadly mistaken. That's not the point.

36:53.080 --> 36:58.000
You see, a thought rises as a reaction to something, all right?

36:58.200 --> 37:02.760
Rises and falls off, and then another thought rises and falls off.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.040
In between the thought, there's a little space,

37:06.240 --> 37:09.440
which in Sanskrit called as vilamba.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.920
Now, the thought may come from the future, may come from the past,

37:13.120 --> 37:15.960
but when it comes, it goes to the past, all right?

37:16.160 --> 37:19.280
Now, what happens: that we see the rising of the thought

37:19.480 --> 37:21.600
but not falling of the thought.

37:21.800 --> 37:25.600
And in between the thought, this vilamba is the present.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.640
Now, if I tell you, “Be in the present,” you cannot.

37:29.840 --> 37:33.480
But you just go on thinking, thinking, thinking like mad.

37:33.680 --> 37:38.640
On the cusps of the thought you are moving, just like mad.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.440
But there's a realm beyond the thought,

37:42.640 --> 37:48.000
which is complete awareness and thoughtless awareness,

37:48.200 --> 37:50.240
where there is no thought.

37:50.440 --> 37:53.440
And thought is a great joy killer.

37:53.640 --> 37:57.400
I'll tell you how. For example, you are seeing these flowers now.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.600
I am also seeing them.

37:59.800 --> 38:04.000
Now, I am seeing it thoughtlessly, you are seeing it with thought.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.880
So the thought arises: “From what shop She must have bought?

38:08.080 --> 38:11.360
How much it must have cost?”

38:11.720 --> 38:14.640
Because thought is not joy.

38:14.840 --> 38:18.520
But I am just looking at it, without thinking.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.040
The complete creation of this,

38:21.240 --> 38:23.960
all the joy that is put into this,

38:24.160 --> 38:26.480
all the joy that has been created by putting it

38:26.680 --> 38:30.480
into this kind of a style, all that is silent

38:30.680 --> 38:33.600
is just entering into My being

38:33.800 --> 38:38.600
and giving Me that peace and the joy for which it was created.

38:38.800 --> 38:42.200
Is a barrier; actually, thought is always a barrier!

38:42.400 --> 38:45.360
But when you go beyond thought, it doesn't mean

38:45.560 --> 38:49.400
that you cannot think but you become a master.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.400
If you want you can think, if you don't want you cannot think.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.000
But you are not driven by your thoughts. You see My point?

38:56.200 --> 39:01.040
It's like the thought is riding you, now you ride the thoughts.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.560
SEEKER: Can you prevent the thinking?
SHRI MATAJI: Can you…?

39:04.760 --> 39:06.320
SEEKER: Can you prevent the thinking I have in my head?

39:06.520 --> 39:09.360
SHRI MATAJI: Yes! If you want, you can just sit silent,

39:09.560 --> 39:13.600
in your silence enjoying it. If you want, you can think.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.960
But after that, whatever you think

39:17.160 --> 39:21.080
has a special quality.

39:22.600 --> 39:26.440
Because that thought that comes to you after your realization

39:26.640 --> 39:30.800
is guided, enlightened by your spirit.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.040
Say, a thought comes to you. For example, you are sitting here,

39:35.240 --> 39:37.360
and you see something in the darkness,

39:37.560 --> 39:39.880
and you think this is a serpent.

39:40.080 --> 39:43.720
For example, you might think; you see, thinking anything is possible.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.520
There's no control.

39:45.720 --> 39:48.960
So you think it is a serpent going, and you are frightened of it,

39:49.160 --> 39:52.560
and you try to save yourself. But supposing there is light.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.080
Then the same thought tells you, “No, no, it's not,

39:55.280 --> 39:57.320
it's just a rope lying there.”

39:57.520 --> 40:01.800
With enlightenment, the same thought has a special quality.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Because you see it in all its dimensions and understand

40:05.200 --> 40:09.000
what does that mean, what it is like,

40:09.200 --> 40:14.040
what is the absolute value of particular thought is.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.280
And you just give up.

40:17.480 --> 40:21.080
Whatever is not right, you just give up; whatever is right, you accept.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.160
Because you see it clearly.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.360
So far, there is no discrimination.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.960
Now, a thought comes to a person

40:29.160 --> 40:33.800
that “Let me go and murder someone.” This all comes from thought!

40:34.000 --> 40:37.960
“Because I hate that person, I must murder that person.” All right?

40:38.160 --> 40:40.040
It's all hatred working.

40:40.240 --> 40:43.520
Now, you may obey that thought, somewhere,

40:43.720 --> 40:45.240
and you murder that person.

40:45.440 --> 40:49.080
And then, after the violence, the whole thing, the face changes,

40:49.280 --> 40:51.840
and you become so nervous, and everything starts.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.560
First thought takes you down there to kill the person,

40:54.760 --> 40:56.560
and the second thought comes [UNCLEAR]:

40:56.760 --> 40:59.800
“Oh God, what have I done!”

41:00.000 --> 41:01.640
Both are wrong.

41:01.840 --> 41:05.320
But if you are a realized soul, first of all you'll not hate anyone.

41:05.520 --> 41:10.840
There are ways of neutralizing the hatred in Sahaja Yoga.

41:11.320 --> 41:15.720
And neutralizing even the hatred of the person who hates you.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.960
Love's powers we have never known before.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.440
We only know the power of hatred, you see;

41:21.640 --> 41:24.280
the way we are producing MX [MX missile], and this, and that —

41:24.480 --> 41:28.280
is nothing, is based on hatred and filth.

41:28.480 --> 41:32.240
If these people get realization — I don't know if they'll ever get it —

41:32.440 --> 41:34.560
they won't produce all these horrible things,

41:34.760 --> 41:39.400
which is making everyone shudder.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.800
We have never used the power of love so far,

41:43.000 --> 41:46.080
but that you cannot do it unless and until you have felt it,

41:46.280 --> 41:49.280
after realization.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.720
SEEKER: Will you please tell us something of the technique?

42:00.920 --> 42:03.920
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I will.

42:07.520 --> 42:10.480
As I said … that it's a spontaneous thing,

42:10.680 --> 42:14.440
it's done as a living process, all right?

42:14.640 --> 42:16.800
Now, say, if I say that …

42:17.000 --> 42:20.120
what is the technique of sprouting a seed?

42:20.320 --> 42:23.040
That's a living process.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.600
No technique, you just put it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.320
It's all built in.

42:28.520 --> 42:31.520
It's a divine technique,

42:31.720 --> 42:34.480
by which it works out, first.

42:34.680 --> 42:38.600
But then you become the master of the technique yourself.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.280
Then you can do it!

42:41.480 --> 42:46.000
Because you enter into a new realm where you have the divine power,

42:46.200 --> 42:50.920
by which you can do it yourself, you can maneuver it.

42:51.520 --> 42:56.920
But how you get your realization? Is through the spontaneous process.

42:57.120 --> 43:00.400
And a very simple process, is like this: a candle

43:00.600 --> 43:04.760
which is enlightened can enlighten another light.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.160
If the candle is there

43:08.360 --> 43:11.280
and if the candle is in order.

43:11.480 --> 43:15.240
But this candle, if it's a realized soul …

43:15.440 --> 43:18.000
that it can also correct —

43:18.200 --> 43:21.280
through its techniques, which you have to learn —

43:21.480 --> 43:25.840
through its technique, it can also correct

43:26.040 --> 43:30.400
the other candle which is not yet enlightened,

43:30.600 --> 43:33.000
and then can enlighten.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.640
It can do everything!

43:35.840 --> 43:41.760
But the technique of that is to be understood very easily

43:41.960 --> 43:45.760
because you become

43:45.960 --> 43:48.400
a collectively conscious personality.

43:48.600 --> 43:52.840
You become, again I say, you become. You become another personality.

43:53.040 --> 43:57.000
Like an egg becomes a bird. That's how you become.

43:57.200 --> 44:01.280
Then the bird has to just learn how to fly.

44:01.480 --> 44:04.360
But how does a …

44:04.560 --> 44:08.960
what is the technique for the egg to become the bird?

44:09.160 --> 44:15.160
It's just to be put in the warmth of the mother hen.

44:15.640 --> 44:18.920
No technique, it's all built in. That's the divine technique.

44:19.120 --> 44:22.520
But then you learn the divine technique yourself, how to do it.

44:22.720 --> 44:27.560
All right? So then, once you are realized,

44:27.760 --> 44:30.320
by very simple method —

44:30.520 --> 44:34.240
which is our job first of all, the job of the realized souls,

44:34.440 --> 44:38.840
like the enlightened light — once that is done for you,

44:39.040 --> 44:42.120
then you have to do for others.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.920
Then you have to learn the technique.

44:44.120 --> 44:46.360
But unless and until you are enlightened,

44:46.560 --> 44:52.200
you cannot do any technique, because there's no power flowing.

44:52.720 --> 44:55.720
To start this, you have to put it to the mains, isn't it?

44:55.920 --> 44:58.200
Otherwise no use knowing the technique.

44:58.400 --> 45:03.160
If you don't know how to start the car, no use knowing how to drive.

45:03.360 --> 45:07.360
So let us first start it, and then you will learn the driving.

45:07.560 --> 45:09.440
Answered all right now?

45:09.640 --> 45:12.800
SEEKER: Having started, how long does it take to become realized?

45:13.000 --> 45:16.600
SHRI MATAJI: No, you are realized at the start only. To begin with.

45:16.800 --> 45:20.600
It takes hardly any time. You get realization first, in the sense

45:20.800 --> 45:24.560
that you become collectively conscious, you become empowered.

45:24.760 --> 45:28.000
But then … it takes hardly any time for some people,

45:28.200 --> 45:30.880
only six, seven days they can become experts.

45:31.080 --> 45:34.360
That's all, that's sufficient.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.480
Some people take some time,

45:37.680 --> 45:42.280
but depending on what obstructions you have in your centers.

45:42.480 --> 45:45.880
If your centers are obstructed, then it takes little more time.

45:46.080 --> 45:50.000
But if they are not, it doesn't take much time.

45:55.160 --> 45:58.640
You become automatically endowed with that technique.

45:58.840 --> 46:01.960
Now here we have at least fifty percent who are Sahaja Yogis.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.560
We call them Sahaja Yogis once they become expert, before that not.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.280
At least fifty percent people sitting here are that.

46:08.480 --> 46:11.680
They're just like you, but there's a difference.

46:11.880 --> 46:14.000
If you see, their faces are glowing,

46:14.200 --> 46:16.760
you won't find any pimples or anything on their faces;

46:16.960 --> 46:22.640
very soft skin, young looking, fresh; eyes are sparkling.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.920
They are over here.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.680
And that's how you become.

46:27.880 --> 46:31.360
You become the masters of yourself. Because you become the spirit!

46:31.560 --> 46:35.200
And spirit is the master because it guides you.

46:35.400 --> 46:39.000
All right? We'll work it out.

46:39.200 --> 46:44.240
That's a very good question! Why? Because you want it.

46:45.800 --> 46:50.400
That's a good question that really helps everyone.

46:56.360 --> 46:59.960
Should we have it now? All right.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.760
You have been requested to take out your shoes for a purpose,

47:02.960 --> 47:06.120
there's nothing to insult you or in any way to trouble you

47:06.320 --> 47:09.560
but to help you all. Because the Mother Earth, you see, helps you.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.840
We have to take the help from the Mother Earth,

47:12.040 --> 47:15.440
so we put our feet on the Mother Earth.

47:16.360 --> 47:19.960
We must know this Mother Earth helps us the most,

47:20.160 --> 47:23.480
so we have to put our feet on the Mother Earth,

47:23.680 --> 47:29.680
without much pressure, little apart, not very close to each other.

47:30.160 --> 47:31.840
All right?

47:32.040 --> 47:36.800
If possible, try to put the whole foot on the Mother Earth,

47:37.000 --> 47:38.560
and sit comfortably.

47:38.760 --> 47:41.960
Now, if there is anything tight, you can little bit loosen it.

47:42.160 --> 47:45.200
If it is too tight. I mean, you should never be uncomfortable,

47:45.400 --> 47:47.120
because your attention goes …

47:47.320 --> 47:50.160
if there is any uncomfortable feeling, it goes there.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.520
Also better to take out your spectacles and things

47:52.720 --> 47:54.600
because it also helps your eyesight.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.960
It helps so many things, so better to take out your spectacles.

47:58.160 --> 48:00.920
Keep it safe somewhere, so your attention is not

48:01.120 --> 48:04.800
sort of distracted by it.

48:07.680 --> 48:11.520
It's a very, very simple method which we have to use.

48:11.720 --> 48:14.800
First of all, as I told you — here you can see also —

48:15.000 --> 48:17.640
yesterday I told you that these centers

48:17.840 --> 48:21.120
are represented in our fingertips.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.720
Muhammad Sahib has said: “At the time of resurrection,

48:24.920 --> 48:28.080
your hands will speak.” Very clearly He said it.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.680
And now this what happens: that your fingers,

48:30.880 --> 48:35.320
they have got sympathetic endings here —

48:35.520 --> 48:39.280
that much, of course, the medical science also agrees —

48:39.480 --> 48:43.880
but these actually are your centers here represented.

48:44.080 --> 48:48.280
So — five, six, and seven. Here also five, six, and seven.

48:48.480 --> 48:51.120
On the two sympathetic nervous systems, left and right,

48:51.320 --> 48:52.760
as you see here.

48:52.960 --> 48:55.720
The gross is the left sympathetic nervous system,

48:55.920 --> 48:58.760
but the subtle one is called as the Ida Nadi,

48:58.960 --> 49:04.880
which is the one which caters to our desires.

49:05.960 --> 49:09.720
The another one, on the right-hand side,

49:09.920 --> 49:11.960
is the one called as the Pingala Nadi,

49:12.160 --> 49:17.160
which manifests the gross …

49:19.520 --> 49:20.800
channel

49:21.000 --> 49:25.920
which represents the right sympathetic nervous system,

49:26.120 --> 49:30.840
which is responsible for the creativity; is the action.

49:31.040 --> 49:34.760
So one is for the desire — first we desire, and then we act —

49:34.960 --> 49:37.880
so this is for the desire, for emotions,

49:38.080 --> 49:40.960
and the right one is for the action.

49:41.160 --> 49:44.080
So we use these hands gradually

49:44.280 --> 49:49.480
according to the obstructions we have on our different centers.

49:49.680 --> 49:54.080
But first of all we have to put the hands just like this:

49:54.280 --> 49:59.680
little bit open, very comfortably put on your lap;

49:59.880 --> 50:02.120
and you have to close your eyes.

50:02.320 --> 50:06.400
That's very important, you have to close your eyes.

50:07.960 --> 50:13.360
Just opposite of mesmerism. Please close your eyes.

50:13.560 --> 50:18.120
Whatever has to happen will happen inside, not outside.

50:18.320 --> 50:21.880
If I say, “Pay attention to yourself inside,” it's impossible.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.920
But it will happen

50:24.120 --> 50:28.440
when some happening takes place,

50:28.640 --> 50:31.240
and your attention will be attracted inside;

50:31.440 --> 50:36.560
and that happening is the awakening of the Kundalini.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.840
Please don't open your eyes. If our eyes are open,

50:45.040 --> 50:47.880
the Kundalini doesn't rise beyond a certain point.

50:48.080 --> 50:50.640
Sometimes She doesn't want to rise at all.

50:50.840 --> 50:55.880
So just keep your eyes shut and put your hands, fingers open,

50:56.080 --> 51:01.360
little … not upward but downward a little bit.

51:21.520 --> 51:25.040
Now, there's a little bit you have to pay attention to:

51:25.240 --> 51:27.200
don't have to open your eyes,

51:27.400 --> 51:30.760
remember that the left side is the desire.

51:30.960 --> 51:34.360
And the desire is the pure desire

51:34.560 --> 51:38.040
to become one with the Divine.

51:39.720 --> 51:43.400
This is the purest desire, and that is represented

51:43.600 --> 51:46.480
by the Kundalini, by this force,

51:46.680 --> 51:51.080
which is placed in the sacrum bone, or the sacred bone,

51:51.280 --> 51:54.400
in the triangular bone as they call it.

51:54.600 --> 51:57.840
Now, the desire has to be kept fixed;

51:58.040 --> 52:02.440
that means the left hand should to be kept as it is.

52:03.280 --> 52:06.240
Now with the right hand we have to work out

52:06.440 --> 52:11.320
the action of clearing our centers.

52:11.520 --> 52:16.360
First of all, please put your right hand on your heart,

52:16.560 --> 52:18.640
on the left-hand side,

52:18.840 --> 52:23.680
because in the heart resides your spirit.

52:23.880 --> 52:27.560
It's better to put it under the coat.

52:34.560 --> 52:37.560
And just say …

52:38.360 --> 52:41.960
or, we should say, ask a question:

52:42.880 --> 52:45.640
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

52:45.840 --> 52:49.080
Ask the question to Me thrice,

52:49.280 --> 52:53.440
in your heart, ask a question: “Am I the spirit?”

52:53.640 --> 52:56.640
Thrice.

53:02.400 --> 53:04.960
This is an absolute question.

53:05.160 --> 53:08.760
You are! But at this stage you just ask the question.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.440
You are the spirit, no doubt!

53:11.640 --> 53:16.480
But ask the question: “Mother, am I the spirit?”

53:21.640 --> 53:25.280
Put both the legs properly on the ground,

53:25.480 --> 53:28.960
separated from each other little bit.

53:29.720 --> 53:33.600
Now take down this hand

53:33.800 --> 53:38.320
to the left side of your stomach — don't open your eyes —

53:38.520 --> 53:42.920
left side, and press it little bit with your fingers.

53:43.120 --> 53:46.160
Here is the center

53:46.360 --> 53:51.760
of your guide, your master.

53:53.320 --> 53:58.000
Because the spirit is the guide and the master,

53:58.400 --> 54:01.120
and as you have asked Me the question

54:01.320 --> 54:04.000
whether you are the spirit,

54:04.200 --> 54:06.240
you better ask another question here,

54:06.440 --> 54:10.160
saying that “Mother, am I my own master?

54:10.360 --> 54:15.560
Am I my own guru? Am I my own guide?”

54:23.040 --> 54:25.720
Sincerely ask this question please.

54:25.920 --> 54:30.120
Lower down on the stomach, on the left-hand side, lower down.

54:30.320 --> 54:33.160
Yes. And put the left hand towards Me.

54:33.360 --> 54:35.800
Left hand should be towards Me, which is a fixed point,

54:36.000 --> 54:39.600
which is the desire that you want to become.

54:44.320 --> 54:50.320
This question is to be asked ten times, because of Ten Commandments.

54:52.240 --> 54:56.520
Or, there are ten petals to this center.

55:13.560 --> 55:19.080
Now again, raise your right hand to your heart position again,

55:19.280 --> 55:22.200
with your left hand at the same point.

55:22.400 --> 55:27.480
Press it a little bit and, again, with full confidence,

55:27.680 --> 55:30.520
please say for My sake, for your sake

55:30.720 --> 55:33.760
that “Mother, I am the spirit.”

55:33.960 --> 55:36.960
Just assert!

55:39.440 --> 55:43.040
You have to say it twelve times.

55:44.120 --> 55:47.800
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

56:23.760 --> 56:27.600
As the spirit is detached,

56:27.800 --> 56:30.160
is blemishless,

56:30.360 --> 56:33.080
it cannot commit any mistakes,

56:33.280 --> 56:36.040
it cannot have any guilt.

56:36.240 --> 56:40.680
So raise the same hand, right hand — left hand keeping the same way —

56:40.880 --> 56:44.400
to the left-side base of the neck.

56:44.600 --> 56:47.000
To the left-side base of the neck;

56:47.200 --> 56:50.960
it's very important, specially for western people

56:51.160 --> 56:55.240
because they always feel guilty, for nothing at all.

56:55.440 --> 56:58.240
You are not to feel guilty!

56:58.440 --> 57:03.280
So, as you are the spirit, you have to say, “Mother,

57:03.640 --> 57:06.640
I am not guilty.”

57:07.440 --> 57:12.320
You have to say this sixteen times please. “Mother, I am not guilty.”

57:12.520 --> 57:15.800
You are the spirit, and how can spirit be guilty?

57:16.000 --> 57:19.400
Don't feel any guilt about anything whatever you have done,

57:19.600 --> 57:23.080
the past is past. At this moment please say,

57:23.280 --> 57:28.440
“Mother, I am not guilty, because I am the spirit.”

57:28.640 --> 57:31.080
And what is your guilt after all,

57:31.280 --> 57:35.080
compared to the forgiveness of God's love?

57:35.280 --> 57:38.480
Because He's the ocean of forgiveness,

57:38.680 --> 57:41.760
He's the ocean of compassion,

57:41.960 --> 57:45.680
He's the ocean of love.

57:50.880 --> 57:53.760
Now raise the same hand. Put the left hand towards Me,

57:53.960 --> 57:57.480
that is important; you must keep the left hand towards Me on the lap,

57:57.680 --> 58:00.680
fixed.

58:00.960 --> 58:04.840
Say it sixteen times please.

58:07.120 --> 58:10.480
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Please say it with full confidence,

58:10.680 --> 58:16.360
is very important, I tell you. Most of you catch on that center.

58:24.920 --> 58:29.800
Now raise your right hand above

58:30.000 --> 58:32.520
onto your forehead, across.

58:32.720 --> 58:35.720
Just put it there.

58:36.440 --> 58:41.400
At this point, you have to forgive everyone.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.240
Just forgive everyone!

58:44.440 --> 58:47.600
Everyone you have to forgive. Put it across.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.840
Some people say it's difficult.

58:50.040 --> 58:52.800
It's a myth that we do not forgive,

58:53.000 --> 58:56.040
because what do we do when we don't forgive?

58:56.240 --> 59:00.600
So just say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

59:00.800 --> 59:04.800
Sincerely please say that “Mother, I really forgive everyone.”

59:05.000 --> 59:06.760
You have to just say it twice.

59:06.960 --> 59:11.800
But it is to be said from your heart, then it will work out.

59:12.000 --> 59:17.040
Now put this hand, after saying that, on top of your head,

59:17.240 --> 59:20.600
at the place where it was soft bone in your childhood,

59:20.800 --> 59:25.080
press it with your palm and just try to turn your head

59:25.280 --> 59:28.080
in a clockwise manner, pressing it.

59:28.280 --> 59:32.200
Just press it and turn it a little bit in the clockwise manner.

59:32.400 --> 59:35.880
Press it with your palm, press it with your palm at the point

59:36.080 --> 59:40.960
where it was soft when you were a child.

59:41.520 --> 59:45.680
At this point, I have to say, I am helpless;

59:45.880 --> 59:50.280
if you do not want to have your realization,

59:50.480 --> 59:53.360
I cannot force it through. Because, as I told you,

59:53.560 --> 59:56.520
you have been given your freedom, which is respected.

59:56.720 --> 59:59.840
So here you have to say, “Mother, I want my realization,

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.680
please give me realization.”

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.760
Unless and until you say that definitely,

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.440
I cannot cross the barrier of your freedom.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.320
So please say it clearly in your heart seven times:

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:18.240
“Mother, please give me my Self-realization.”

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.640
Seven times please.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.280
Say it from your heart. Say, it, from, your, heart.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.960
Very sincerely, that's important.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.480
Earnestly you have to say that.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.320
Now raise your hand and see if there is a cool breeze coming out;

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.400
or if there is a hot thing coming out:

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.440
maybe some people will get heat first.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.320
You can change over the hand and see from the other hand,

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.400
and put the right hand towards Me.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.320
You can see if there is a cool breeze coming in,

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.560
or a hot breeze coming in.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.400
Why don't you see?

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.720
It's there, it's there, it's there!

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.080
Put your hand like this, right hand … like this … when … yes …

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.000
also … and now you see. It's there? All right, gradually.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.840
Now you turn. Again see another hand.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.400
Just try with another hand, you see?

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.840
Again change over and see for yourself.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.480
This will help you to get a balance.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.400
If you are feeling in your head,

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.200
then see if you are feeling in your hands as well.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.080
Put your hands towards Me. See now if you are feeling in your hands.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:30.400
She's got it. You've got it, yes!

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.640
If you put up your hands like this — open your eyes —

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.480
just like this,

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.800
you start feeling it in your hands: a little cool breeze

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.600
or a movement downward. Start first feeling it.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.080
Are you? Good, good.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.520
Some of you have a center caught up there.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.400
All right?

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.680
Feeling it? Now bring it down and see for yourself

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.880
if you are feeling it in your hands.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.280
Mm, very relaxed.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.680
Are you? Good. What about you, sir?

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.160
Not yet? We will work out. (To a yogi) Just see…

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.720
Now, there are Sahaja Yogis here who are sitting,

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.840
who can help you also, those who have not felt it.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.960
It will work out, it is going to work out.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.560
It has worked in this lady: face is changed, looking so much younger.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.600
You too.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.720
What about you now? This gentleman, are you feeling now?

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.120
He's got just a Hamsa Chakra, this one.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.360
The one who came to Louise? Not yet?

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.200
It's all right, it will work out. Now, don't lose patience.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.600
You must have patience with yourself.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.000
Please close your eyes, just close your eyes.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.640
It's going to work out.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.480
There! Now just watch Me without thinking. Let's see can you do it.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:38.680
All right?

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.560
What about these people?

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.240
Aah, that's better!
