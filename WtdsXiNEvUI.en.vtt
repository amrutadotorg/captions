00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:11.960
It’s such a great joy;

00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:18.683
in these modern times,

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:27.820
it is described that in this Kali Yuga
everything will go upside down

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:32.531
because people will not recognize
the motherhood.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.880
The mothers won’t be respected

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:43.250
and won’t be respectable either.
Is a fact.

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:50.802
And imagine now this has brought this
Mother’s Day to this country.

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:55.095
It’s something, such a recognition

00:00:55.885 --> 00:01:01.849
from the Divine, that one has to

00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:10.290
remember that motherhood is very important.

00:01:14.718 --> 00:01:18.257
It is the Mother who created the universe;

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:22.539
the Father was just a witness
to the whole show.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.442
It is She works it out the whole thing.

00:01:26.637 --> 00:01:30.573
It is She makes it beautiful so that
He sees

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:35.904
the show, that He becomes the spectator,

00:01:39.668 --> 00:01:43.486
because She loves Her creation.

00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:48.387
The Father wants that it should be such
that He should be able to love it.

00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:54.998
He is a perfectionist, he wants everything
to be perfect.

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:58.614
But a Mother accepts as the child is,

00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:02.377
because that is Her own creation.
If there is a defect in the child,

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:06.419
She accepts that defect as Her own

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:11.184
and She works for it; She works very hard.

00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:19.012
It’s no sacrifice, because you enjoy it.

00:02:19.213 --> 00:02:26.014
You enjoy doing that. You enjoy working
for your children.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.240
And if it was not so, this world would
never have existed.

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:43.598
You know what untold things mother has
to bear when the child is to be born.

00:02:43.812 --> 00:02:47.201
Actually, it is a test of her love,
I feel, at that time.

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:53.186
Still she goes on with it because she wants
that child.

00:02:55.744 --> 00:03:00.044
But when this motherhood is spoilt
in its image,

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:05.558
when the mothers are no more mothers,
they are not respectable,

00:03:07.626 --> 00:03:13.586
then they are not respected. And when
the children don’t respect their mothers

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:19.257
because they have no respect for anything
else whatsoever…

00:03:19.617 --> 00:03:23.818
I mean, the first thing and the last thing
is the respect for the mother.

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.354
If one does not respect the mother,
or the motherhood,

00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:31.583
that means he has no respect for himself
either.

00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:36.539
So how does he exist? He exists through
his mother.

00:03:36.981 --> 00:03:42.577
So, mother is a very, very important
institution

00:03:42.778 --> 00:03:46.639
for the whole creation, for your creation

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.214
and for the creation of your children and
all the progeny that has to come.

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:59.373
Now let us see what does the Mother
provide us with,

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:03.429
what part of our being She is.

00:04:05.284 --> 00:04:08.359
I would say that She is everything.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.809
But your personal mother who has given you
this birth,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.805
this body, is your own mother

00:04:19.407 --> 00:04:23.737
whom you know very clearly that she is
your mother.

00:04:25.193 --> 00:04:28.728
As you know, she gives you

00:04:28.937 --> 00:04:35.219
the nourishment when you are in a fetus
stage;

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:40.020
and later on when you grow up she,
she gives you

00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:47.763
all the physical nourishment that is needed
for your growth and she enjoys it.

00:04:50.417 --> 00:04:54.052
Otherwise she feels over-burdened.
She wants to give it.

00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:57.707
And everyone appreciates that.

00:04:58.685 --> 00:05:02.964
It’s a collective enjoyment.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:13.691
And it’s going on, and it could be seen
from all the paintings of the world,

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:21.159
all over the world, in every language,
in every country, every religion.

00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:26.245
The mother and the child has been
the main theme of paintings

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:33.093
and expression of the most joyous moment
for painters.

00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:39.976
Poets also have written such a lot on that.

00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:46.745
Every way of manifestation of joy,

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:55.080
in all the human endeavor has been on this
thing, revolving on this thing.

00:05:56.558 --> 00:06:00.661
But the mother who is your own mother,
whom you know as your mother,

00:06:00.742 --> 00:06:03.713
who gives you physical birth,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.694
is the mother
who gives you much more than you know of.

00:06:12.276 --> 00:06:18.120
Because her blood has her vibrations,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:27.896
and when she gives you her blood she gives
you her vibrations,

00:06:28.924 --> 00:06:33.472
she gives her sustenance,

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:44.674
she gives you her desires and also
she gives you

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:50.369
a push in your evolution if she is
an evolved person.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:02.639
Now, in mother and the child relationship,
mother gives a lot.

00:07:03.236 --> 00:07:10.354
She gives, makes your complete left side.
She creates all that left side in you,

00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:16.447
because she has desired for you; so
she creates that.

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:25.025
On the right side she gives you
all the beauty of delicate things,

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:36.769
and also the hunches that you get
in your business

00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:44.276
or all the flexible moments of your life
that you think,

00:07:44.357 --> 00:07:50.143
“From where unknown I got something?” -
that’s your mother’s blessings on you.
