00:08.816 --> 00:11.960
It’s such a great joy;

00:15.203 --> 00:18.683
in these modern times,

00:19.606 --> 00:27.820
it is described that in this Kali Yuga
everything will go upside down

00:27.901 --> 00:32.531
because people will not recognize
the motherhood.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.880
The mothers won’t be respected

00:38.448 --> 00:43.250
and won’t be respectable either.
Is a fact.

00:43.458 --> 00:50.802
And imagine now this has brought this
Mother’s Day to this country.

00:51.188 --> 00:55.095
It’s something, such a recognition

00:55.885 --> 01:01.849
from the Divine, that one has to

01:03.684 --> 01:10.290
remember that motherhood is very important.

01:14.718 --> 01:18.257
It is the Mother who created the universe;

01:18.458 --> 01:22.539
the Father was just a witness
to the whole show.

01:22.860 --> 01:26.442
It is She works it out the whole thing.

01:26.637 --> 01:30.573
It is She makes it beautiful so that
He sees

01:31.133 --> 01:35.904
the show, that He becomes the spectator,

01:39.668 --> 01:43.486
because She loves Her creation.

01:43.826 --> 01:48.387
The Father wants that it should be such
that He should be able to love it.

01:48.628 --> 01:54.998
He is a perfectionist, he wants everything
to be perfect.

01:55.396 --> 01:58.614
But a Mother accepts as the child is,

01:59.078 --> 02:02.377
because that is Her own creation.
If there is a defect in the child,

02:02.458 --> 02:06.419
She accepts that defect as Her own

02:07.095 --> 02:11.184
and She works for it; She works very hard.

02:11.392 --> 02:19.012
It’s no sacrifice, because you enjoy it.

02:19.213 --> 02:26.014
You enjoy doing that. You enjoy working
for your children.

02:30.730 --> 02:37.240
And if it was not so, this world would
never have existed.

02:37.901 --> 02:43.598
You know what untold things mother has
to bear when the child is to be born.

02:43.812 --> 02:47.201
Actually, it is a test of her love,
I feel, at that time.

02:47.382 --> 02:53.186
Still she goes on with it because she wants
that child.

02:55.744 --> 03:00.044
But when this motherhood is spoilt
in its image,

03:00.245 --> 03:05.558
when the mothers are no more mothers,
they are not respectable,

03:07.626 --> 03:13.586
then they are not respected. And when
the children don’t respect their mothers

03:13.667 --> 03:19.257
because they have no respect for anything
else whatsoever…

03:19.617 --> 03:23.818
I mean, the first thing and the last thing
is the respect for the mother.

03:24.019 --> 03:28.354
If one does not respect the mother,
or the motherhood,

03:28.555 --> 03:31.583
that means he has no respect for himself
either.

03:31.784 --> 03:36.539
So how does he exist? He exists through
his mother.

03:36.981 --> 03:42.577
So, mother is a very, very important
institution

03:42.778 --> 03:46.639
for the whole creation, for your creation

03:46.840 --> 03:53.214
and for the creation of your children and
all the progeny that has to come.

03:54.913 --> 03:59.373
Now let us see what does the Mother
provide us with,

03:59.574 --> 04:03.429
what part of our being She is.

04:05.284 --> 04:08.359
I would say that She is everything.

04:08.440 --> 04:12.809
But your personal mother who has given you
this birth,

04:13.010 --> 04:17.805
this body, is your own mother

04:19.407 --> 04:23.737
whom you know very clearly that she is
your mother.

04:25.193 --> 04:28.728
As you know, she gives you

04:28.937 --> 04:35.219
the nourishment when you are in a fetus
stage;

04:35.589 --> 04:40.020
and later on when you grow up she,
she gives you

04:40.237 --> 04:47.763
all the physical nourishment that is needed
for your growth and she enjoys it.

04:50.417 --> 04:54.052
Otherwise she feels over-burdened.
She wants to give it.

04:54.253 --> 04:57.707
And everyone appreciates that.

04:58.685 --> 05:02.964
It’s a collective enjoyment.

05:05.895 --> 05:13.691
And it’s going on, and it could be seen
from all the paintings of the world,

05:13.772 --> 05:21.159
all over the world, in every language,
in every country, every religion.

05:21.291 --> 05:26.245
The mother and the child has been
the main theme of paintings

05:26.447 --> 05:33.093
and expression of the most joyous moment
for painters.

05:33.764 --> 05:39.976
Poets also have written such a lot on that.

05:40.821 --> 05:46.745
Every way of manifestation of joy,

05:46.945 --> 05:55.080
in all the human endeavor has been on this
thing, revolving on this thing.

05:56.558 --> 06:00.661
But the mother who is your own mother,
whom you know as your mother,

06:00.742 --> 06:03.713
who gives you physical birth,

06:03.800 --> 06:09.694
is the mother
who gives you much more than you know of.

06:12.276 --> 06:18.120
Because her blood has her vibrations,

06:19.860 --> 06:27.896
and when she gives you her blood she gives
you her vibrations,

06:28.924 --> 06:33.472
she gives her sustenance,

06:37.239 --> 06:44.674
she gives you her desires and also
she gives you

06:44.755 --> 06:50.369
a push in your evolution if she is
an evolved person.

06:54.270 --> 07:02.639
Now, in mother and the child relationship,
mother gives a lot.

07:03.236 --> 07:10.354
She gives, makes your complete left side.
She creates all that left side in you,

07:10.435 --> 07:16.447
because she has desired for you; so
she creates that.

07:17.336 --> 07:25.025
On the right side she gives you
all the beauty of delicate things,

07:26.630 --> 07:36.769
and also the hunches that you get
in your business

07:36.971 --> 07:44.276
or all the flexible moments of your life
that you think,

07:44.357 --> 07:50.143
“From where unknown I got something?” -
that’s your mother’s blessings on you.
