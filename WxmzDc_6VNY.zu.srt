1
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,540
I bow to all the seekers of truth

2
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:43,500
at the very outset I have to say we
should know what is the truth everybody

3
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:53,340
is seeking the truth but they have no
idea as to what they should find there

4
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:04,890
is an urge within us because these times
are special and we are seeking but still

5
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:13,320
we don't have a clear-cut idea as to
what we should seek and what we should

6
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:28,220
achieve after our seeking now I would
like to refer to all the great books on

7
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:41,220
religion about truth they all have said
that who have to know yourself knowing

8
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:51,000
yourself is the point and that you have
to become the spirit it said in all

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,450
these intelligence but though we can
find that these regions are not really

10
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:11,280
doing that they are not getting able to
give you the truth and that's why

11
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,090
there's so much of conflict so much of
fights going on there are all real

12
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,970
religions no doubt and the essence of
every Lydian is the same despite all

13
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:32,910
that they are fighting in the name of
religion how can that be it can be

14
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:41,910
explained very well that if you have
lost over way we can go into opposite

15
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,240
directions

16
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,730
so when we know we have to know
ourselves and that is our goal of life

17
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:04,980
that is how we are going to improve on
our life as such that has been not so

18
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:15,480
clearly explained but where there is an
arrangement with in a sonata is being

19
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:23,220
told by most of them and that are in
mint as must have been told to you lies

20
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:33,450
in the triangular bone three and a half
points of energy which is divine which

21
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,470
can connect us to the all-pervading
power of truth which is a very subtle

22
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:50,459
energy and when that happens you get
connected with that power and that power

23
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:57,060
starts flowing through you and you can
feel it on your fingertips that power

24
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:07,410
flow this is a fact we have to first
verify before denying it if it could

25
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:18,080
happen to you all that you can feel this
all-pervading power on your fingertips

26
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:26,910
then it's an experience it's not just by
giving you a big lecture or telling you

27
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,000
about something fantastic but
actualization most important thing is

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:43,610
the actualization is the becoming of
your being the spirit this has to happen

29
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:54,340
all kinds of acrobats people may tell is
absolutely I must say

30
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:11,820
is a false pretext no amount of acrobats
are necessary it is such such means is

31
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:19,360
spontaneous it is within you all of you
have this power all of you are capable

32
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,830
of becoming the spirit but you must
understand what you should expect what

33
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:33,240
you should pick up unless and until you
have proper value system about it

34
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:43,260
nothing can be explained and you can be
mislead by all other nonsensical thing

35
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:51,570
of course you can't pay for it because
it's a living process of your evolution

36
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:58,780
now you are at a human awareness but
it's not subjective you have to rise

37
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:06,789
higher higher into the realm of
spirituality it's not spiritualism but

38
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:13,660
spirituality where you become the spirit
the master it's not difficult at all I

39
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:23,610
assure you it's not difficult America
has been somehow the last last place

40
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,139
because I came long time back to begin
with but I found people were running

41
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:40,120
after all kinds of business nonsensical
people when I gave up I said I'll go to

42
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,710
America after nine years and then I came
and gradually I started understanding

43
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:56,099
that they are seekers they are really
seekers not that they are in any way

44
00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:04,150
hypocritical but it is the way people
are enticing them and taking them under

45
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,900
their own control
that they cannot see the point and the

46
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,610
point things you can't do anything about
a person may come and tell you you must

47
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,490
get the task give me all your property
all your money and I'll give you two

48
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:32,060
pair of clothes to wear and so many have
done that by doing this kind of nonsense

49
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:44,700
are you going to enter inside yourself
is it possible just think of it so many

50
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,220
people have come here telling you all
kinds of stories in your humble seeking

51
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:57,990
you have been mislaid and I feel very
sorry for it now try to understand that

52
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:06,990
you have been very special people as
human beings and that you have to become

53
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:16,229
the super human being we can call the
greatly evolved soul we have so many we

54
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,450
had so many and those we had we called
them by different name they were called

55
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:32,339
as Sufis and rick masters but they are
not intelligible normally to people

56
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,380
because unless and until you have the
awareness which is enlightened by your

57
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:45,770
spirit you cannot understand what they
are talking about now the time has come

58
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:54,209
for all of you to get your realization
you have been seeking for ages now and

59
00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:01,740
it is already describing books that the
day will come the time will come they

60
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:10,110
call it as Kali Yuga is the worst start
that is now at this time people who are

61
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:18,550
seeking God in the hills and dales will
get into proper family life

62
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:26,410
and they will get their server ization
through this Kundalini awakening now in

63
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,600
the name of Kundalini also lots of
nonsense has been said which is

64
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:43,930
surprising how people accepted that a
Kundalini can be dangerous and a person

65
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:53,040
who gets Kundalini awakening will be
very much harmed now she is your mother

66
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:00,880
Kundalini is your exclusive model she
knows each and everything about she

67
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,500
knows about your false and so your
aspirations everything is recorded in

68
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,310
her and she is extremely careful when
she gives you the second birth and she

69
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:21,040
takes up all the problems upon herself
she doesn't bother you she doesn't

70
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:29,890
trouble you and she's the one who looks
after your second birth again I say is

71
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:36,970
the actualization actualization of
baptism you can call it but it is not

72
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:44,589
the way they do its actual ization it
happens that this rises passes through

73
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:50,260
six centers and pierces through your
fontanel bone area and you do feel on

74
00:10:50,260 --> 00:11:00,520
your hands fingers and out of your head
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost this

75
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:08,290
has to happen otherwise whatever story
is one matter you shouldn't believe it

76
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:18,880
has to show results now these centers
that we have all these seven centers are

77
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,590
responsible for our
physical mental emotional and spiritual

78
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:39,370
me so many people get cured many people
have problems mentally they get here and

79
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,440
spiritually you get endowed with the
absolute knowledge absolute knowledge

80
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,480
not knowledge that we learn in the
schools or colleges but the knowledge

81
00:11:50,480 --> 00:12:01,880
which is absolute for example if you
want to know about someone you can ask a

82
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:10,490
question and you'll be amazed if the
question is yes then you start getting

83
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:19,850
the cool breeze flowing fast but if it
is no or it is wrong then you might get

84
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:33,710
little tingle or might get very hot from
those persons who are to be tested it's

85
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:41,060
a very very interesting precise and a
scientific method now if there are

86
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,190
doctors i would like to tell that you
get in control with the parasympathetic

87
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:52,400
nervous system luckily there's going to
be a big conference with me with the

88
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,950
doctors in New York I know what r
association it is called and I don't

89
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:08,180
know all right now in that they are
convinced now that what I am saying is a

90
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:17,200
fact and that helps helps you get cured
by yourself and you can also cure others

91
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,640
there's no need to have these horrible
modern diseases that you are afraid of

92
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:32,850
you can just find out about it in no
time apart from that

93
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:43,380
that you just know how to treat others
how to cure others how to help us out

94
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:51,910
but apart from that what you get is a
spiritual place and the spiritual

95
00:13:51,910 --> 00:14:00,190
blessing is this that you get the peace
in your heart surprisingly when this

96
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:07,360
Kundalini Rises she some are other by
joining with the divine power

97
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:15,540
all-pervading power assumes a
personality which is extremely pure

98
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:27,130
extremely benevolent extremely tolerant
and extremely true them all your enemies

99
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:40,120
that we call like anger lust greed all
these anyways just drop and you are no

100
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,670
more in the entanglement of those anyway
and you become a free person absolutely

101
00:14:48,670 --> 00:15:02,069
a free person above all you are so
beautiful you become such a nice person

102
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:14,550
that established your peace now normal
human beings what do they do they react

103
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,920
the reactor t see they were telling me
that still there is time people are

104
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,620
still coming doesn't matter you can come
late there's no don't come just now all

105
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:34,180
right but I don't know how to react and
that's why when I came visit mother

106
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:40,360
still you look very relaxed I said I
never reacted to this so you don't react

107
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:48,220
by not reaction what happens that the
thoughts that come to you count from the

108
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,380
future and the past and you are lost in
those thoughts because you are jumping

109
00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:00,040
on the cusp of these thoughts when the
Kundalini Rises the thoughts are like

110
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:09,579
this she along gates those thoughts and
a space is created which we call it as

111
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:18,640
pause or William in that state you
become absolutely peaceful you don't

112
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,339
think anymore we call it thoughtless
awareness that young girl described that

113
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:31,420
means you watch anything just as a
witness see everything as a witness see

114
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,810
there's a bit nice carpet here I am
seeing it now supposing it belonged to

115
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:43,720
me if I was normal I would have said oh
my god i don't know how are they going

116
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:51,370
to keep it in case this belongs to
somebody else i would appreciate it and

117
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,570
I'll say oh I must buy this how much it
will cost I hope is insured and all

118
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:05,110
kinds of but if I am they realized
person then I just watch it without

119
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:13,299
thinking and the joy that the artist has
put into this carpet enables you to

120
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:21,730
enjoy enjoy without reaction and this
state we call it aha was da where a

121
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:30,400
person becomes absolutely one with
himself complete and when he looks at

122
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,790
anything he doesn't react he sees he
becomes the witness you become just the

123
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:46,130
witness of the whole your memory
improves your ideas about creation

124
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:54,860
anything I mean you become an extremely
extremely I should say creative person

125
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:02,390
and you don't develop the pride you
don't ever fall suit but you just enjoy

126
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,780
creating something human being is the
most beautiful useful thing and the most

127
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:16,160
beautiful thing that divine has created
but we don't know what we are that's why

128
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,460
always it is said know thyself know
yourself unless and until you know

129
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:30,590
yourself how can you say I hate myself
or I do I do that actually the beauty

130
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:44,930
lies within you and is to be expressed
through these divine vibration now the

131
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:50,650
health improves no doubt so many have
improved their health but i have seen in

132
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:56,720
london in the beginning so many boys
were taking drugs give it up overnight I

133
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,020
never say don't give up I don't say
don't if you say don't then David half

134
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:09,340
of them will run away let them play let
them get their realization then

135
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,680
automatically the whole thing drops out
and you shoot out out of that and you

136
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:23,030
become the real personality thus you
know the reality because you are not any

137
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:29,270
more contaminated by your ego or your
super-ego these thoughts come to you

138
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:34,910
from your ego or super you go meaning
your conditioning you are noble you're

139
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:44,420
absolutely free and you see everything
in its real position this kind of thing

140
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:52,610
happening was already destined has been
already prophesized that is going to

141
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,410
happen
in those days and so if you can come

142
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,790
here this side we have chairs

143
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,260
alright

144
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:15,229
so this is how we are going to become
ourselves and we will know what we are

145
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:24,169
and what we are capable of our
capabilities are fathomless but unless

146
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:31,399
and until we are connected how can we
act for example this instrument if it is

147
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:37,099
not connected to the mains it is
ruthless in the same way you are to be

148
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:42,889
connected to the mains is very important
for that you don't have to do anything

149
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:49,209
it just works spontaneously within you
and you get your self-realization

150
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:56,599
without any doubt actually I must have
given thousands of lectures all over the

151
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:03,169
world and there's no end to it now I
would like you people to ask me some

152
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:09,999
questions which I would like to answer
if you have any

153
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,150
there any questions you could raise a
hand

154
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:42,000
the thing is if you can do without the
photograph nothing like it but you need

155
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,679
something to support and that's why
people use the photograph if you don't

156
00:21:50,679 --> 00:22:02,250
need it it's all right but you will find
you will need it all right

157
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:16,090
that's my job I will do it all right
it's very simple how does a mother earth

158
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:22,220
sprouts the seed how does she is
innately built in in her that power

159
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:32,380
isn't it what is gather

160
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:48,599
alright very good question Paramatma is
the God Almighty alright and his power

161
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:57,149
is the ADI Shakti is the power that has
done all the creation everything while

162
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:04,949
Paramatma is the one who is just a
spectator of the whole thing crystal

163
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:12,679
they call it while Adi Shakti the one
who does all the creation and everything

164
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:22,589
now permata is in your heart reflected a
spirit and Kundalini is reflected on

165
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:28,589
your in your triangular bone and
sufficiently I Receptus reflection is

166
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:38,029
the poodle oh you will get absolute
knowledge everything

167
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,890
get that

168
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:05,470
what should come first

169
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,920
what should come first what the
Kundalini awakening or dissolving the

170
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:17,910
jealousy no no Kundalini Awakening is
the one by which all these things

171
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:37,680
happened automatically there's no need
in sahaja yoga there's no need to work

172
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:45,210
it out the negative forces themselves
run away ninety-nine percent in one

173
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:53,460
person maybe it still sticks but
otherwise 99% they all run away with the

174
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,560
light of the Kundalini with the
Enlightenment of the Spirit on your

175
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,160
attention

176
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:21,659
yeah of course no doubt you only on the
contrary you become multi-dimensional

177
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:37,379
personality you try you cannot do it if
you are doing something wrong you cannot

178
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:42,359
do it after Kundalini awakening because
you see what is destructive for you and

179
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:49,649
what is constructive or so you don't do
it you just don't do it I told you just

180
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:59,609
now that overnight people gave up drugs
I didn't tell them is the light if you

181
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,570
are sitting in the darkness you don't
know where are you but if there's like

182
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:09,200
you know everything is like that is
enlightenment i am talking them

183
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:24,500
just to desire that you should get your
self-realization you must have a strong

184
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:32,080
desire yes madam

185
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:53,740
everything everything it is controlled
you don't have to do

186
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,730
because of practicing Christian religion
she feels that she's going to help

187
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:23,850
correct and does not mean that by
practicing now I was also born in a

188
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:32,090
Christian religion and I know that how
Christianity was just opposite of Christ

189
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:40,860
but just a minute but after realization
you are enlightened and you see the

190
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:47,100
beauty of every religion and the essence
of every religion and then you also

191
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:58,710
understand that you are capable yourself
of following a spiritual path without

192
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:05,340
any difficulties nothing destructive
nothing wrong nothing manipulated it's

193
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,740
your own you become your own master

194
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,590
those who are met and whose I have
nothing to say

195
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:21,210
I don't want to do that once the use is
done through some spirits I thing yes

196
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,509
madam

197
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:49,519
so many forces away from that yes it's
correct but just now just now I promise

198
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,529
you that you will get your realization
and then you will see all these forces

199
00:29:54,529 --> 00:30:06,940
with drop off all right the decay and
substance that I selected slicking

200
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:39,240
yes this means left side is caught up
what is this written this letter that

201
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:47,360
means left side is not all right but it
can be put right

202
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,010
said this is a special time

203
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:22,480
he is called as Kaliyuga and also this
is the time of Last Judgment and at this

204
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:33,700
time one has to be very careful because
you are going to be judged whether you

205
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:41,619
take to truth or not if you are still
with falsehood you are just you will

206
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:48,220
judge yourself nobody needs to judge you
by so many things will happen that will

207
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:59,279
realize there's something wrong 11

208
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:20,860
I didn't give me any joy I had to give
him advice but he did say that let our

209
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:28,120
country be free then you can start your
sahaja yoga program not before that that

210
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:35,700
was his idea that we are not yet free to
propagate anything

211
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:58,370
very good question you don't have to
assess no number of times you have to do

212
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:05,150
it under once it is enlightened it is
enlightened but we have problems still

213
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:11,740
there so the Kundalini goes back to
correcting sometimes so we have here a

214
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:18,560
proper follow-up they call it and after
that we have centers where you can go

215
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,530
all so nobody will charge any money and
they'll find out what's wrong with you

216
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:32,360
and they'll try to tell you what is to
be done it happens with very few but

217
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:41,920
you'll enjoy going to the center because
it is all enjoyment there free of charge

218
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:55,370
they will tell you you have to meditate
that they will tell you how to meditate

219
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:01,910
and if you follow it for 10-15 minutes
at the most and it works out and you can

220
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:08,900
grow because after all is first
germination of the seed you see there

221
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:15,860
but it has to grow and some people grow
so fast I'm surprised of times that at

222
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,500
the very first meeting only they become
great people

223
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:38,460
dorman no it does it does not but if you
try not to pay attention to its proper

224
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:47,050
alignment or proper development then it
will become static at that point but it

225
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,830
never goes back

226
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:10,440
Kevin
I see me

227
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:38,270
you can you can do it if you desired so
you can really help them you can read

228
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:44,360
help I mean that's what is happening now
as you see these people say that sahaja

229
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,300
yoga is working in 86 countries what
happened that one person got his

230
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:56,210
realization he went to his country and
he changed the way people in a far fresh

231
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:04,760
country like Benny imagine Benny where
they have mostly Muslims there are seven

232
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:12,470
thousand sahaja Yogi's in Turkey we have
three thousand and in so many places we

233
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:19,580
have but the maximum in Benin where
there are mostly people who are who were

234
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:25,370
Muslims and I was applied are there why
did you become Muslims so they said

235
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:31,010
because the French were here and we
didn't like the way they were a model so

236
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,300
we thought their religion is no good so
the gay Muslims but now they're great

237
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:41,180
sahaja Yogi's very very great sahaja
yoga so many Muslim countries have

238
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:47,000
become sahaja Yogi's all over the world
we have in Russia we have thousands and

239
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,660
thousands and thousands and Russians are
very deeply but I tell you the so-called

240
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,480
freedom we had we have gone helter
skelter while the Russians had no

241
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,900
freedom they could not even talk about
God they did not read anything about

242
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:11,570
divine and they developed I think out of
that tyranny of communism developed

243
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:19,070
within themselves a very very deep
understanding and they are there will be

244
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:26,240
amazed that sahaja yoga is now practiced
in so many countries where I never even

245
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,680
thought I would reach but sahaja Yogi's
have gone and done the job

246
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:38,319
what's a lot of pussy

247
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:55,890
now can I ask you one question what was
your first understanding that you were a

248
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:05,880
human being it's like that one as you
are aware of you being a human being I

249
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,690
was aware

250
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:41,680
I have no religion I have all the radius

251
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:52,220
born in any family should not sort of
stop your widget you can see through

252
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,350
everything if you have the light

253
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:12,500
there's another one now I was I must say
here there are so many people who are

254
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,720
asking questions normally they I don't
find that experience doesn't matter but

255
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:23,450
how many will become good sahaja Yogi's
used to be seen out of you it's all

256
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,760
right to ask questions after questions
but that is of no value unless and until

257
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:36,580
you really become what I am saying a
sahaja yogi a real personality that is

258
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:43,550
absolutely spiritual so we have to see
that that is the challenge for all of

259
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:49,430
you let's see how many i must say Los
Angeles has been really a lost and

260
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:56,930
delicious so far for me but sahaja
Yogi's always felt that I can do very

261
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:02,930
well so I came now this is the fifth
question you are asking madam will you

262
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:14,730
please take your realization and then
ask your right this another one

263
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,630
you see once you have asked a question
you shouldn't ask another question

264
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:27,210
please because all of them are waiting
for their self-realization they are all

265
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:32,910
waiting for their self-realization only
few who want to ask questions is one is

266
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:39,210
all right but not all the time go on
asking questions what is there unless

267
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:46,190
and until you are a journalist a vehicle

268
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:59,490
as we should can you now write your
questions and let me know I'll answer

269
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:06,710
them after you get your realization then
you won't have any questions I know

270
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:22,920
again I said it is the becoming you have
to become it's not just talking

271
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:36,140
now forget your questions for the time
being better get your realization all

272
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:49,520
right now one thing is that you have to
just take out your shoes or chuckles

273
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,830
whatever it because this mother earth is
of a great help she sucks in all our

274
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:03,220
problems put both the feet apart from
each other

275
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,960
you will know everything about sahaja
yoga why I said to put your feet apart

276
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,089
from each other everything you will know
very clearly but they should touch the

277
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:33,539
mother earth you have to just be
comfortable and all of you should be

278
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:42,779
seated before i start i have to request
that those who want their realization

279
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:50,520
only i can give them it cannot be forced
because kundalini is the pure desire is

280
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:58,589
the pure desire not impurities are as we
have whatever desired we have we have

281
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:03,200
today one then we want to have something
else that's the principle of economics

282
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,960
but this is pure desire and forth is
pure desire you should be determined to

283
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:19,950
get it is your own character your own
understanding only will work it out now

284
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:25,529
I would request you all to sit
comfortably with both feet like this

285
00:43:25,529 --> 00:43:33,500
very comfortable and put both your hands
towards me like

286
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:08,000
now what I find that some of you feel
guilty it's a nonsense if you feel

287
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,850
guilty then this Center here catches on
the left hand side and the Kundalini

288
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:22,130
don't move so if you have done anything
wrong I agree so it's finished that's

289
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:30,980
the past you don't have to worry about
that at this moment please you have to

290
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:40,870
know that you are not guilty at all for
anything so please forgive yourself

291
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:49,490
please forgive yourself now the second
thing is that we have to forgive also

292
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:56,120
others now some people say it's
difficult to forgive mother I mean what

293
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:02,240
do you do whether you forgive where you
don't forgive you don't do anything what

294
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:10,400
do you do nothing but by not forgiving
you torture yourself so best thing is to

295
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,400
forgive all of them forgive everybody
who has harmed you who has troubled you

296
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:23,540
was made you unhappy as hurt forgive
don't also think about them it's also

297
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:31,640
useless by forgiving you don't know what
will happen absolute really feel

298
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:38,240
peaceful be yourself just forgive it
this nobleness you should accept today

299
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:46,790
that you forgive everyone just working
now please put your hands torsion like

300
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:52,510
this comfortably perfect

301
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:05,400
now you can put your right hand towards
me and feel with the left hand on top of

302
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:17,250
your fontanel bone area little higher if
there is any cool or a hot breeze like

303
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:28,230
vibrations are coming out of your own
head on your ship bomb you can feel it

304
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:35,580
you move your hand up and down and see
for yourself if you are feeling please

305
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:45,810
remove your caps if you have please it's
better to remove now please see you must

306
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:50,850
have respect for yourself should not
denounce yourself and you should also

307
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:57,030
forgive everyone that's very important
