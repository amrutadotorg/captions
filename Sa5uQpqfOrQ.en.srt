1
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:11,280
Now the interest changes completely,

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,352
and you start really helping people and not
feeling that you are helping them, not at all.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,060
But the surrounding portion of that,
which is the void, is the best,

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,620
which is affected by your awakening,
that you become the virtue itself.

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:40,245
Nobody has to tell you that you be virtuous, when
you are awakened you become a virtuous personality,

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:51,589
you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy being good,
you enjoy being nice, you really enjoy it.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,832
And that enjoyment comes to you as a blessing
because the virtue itself is so strengthening,

8
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:07,080
so powerful that anyone who is
harmed or troubled or tortured or

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:16,410
put down, you stand up, you are not afraid of
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

10
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:24,300
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

11
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,340
I’m just a lady and single-handed
I told them who these people are,

12
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,060
how they are going to loot you,
and what they are going to do;

13
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,493
but in this country nobody can think of one
genuine person who could be really genuine.

14
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,906
It was the problem that time, but with this
awakening within you of the virtuous nature,

15
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,860
you just know what is virtue
and what is not virtue.

16
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,180
I don’t have to tell you; I don’t
say “don’t do this, don’t do that."

17
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,200
I never say that, it just happens,
because when the virtue starts developing,

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,692
the vibrations improve and
you feel extremely joyous.

19
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:16,440
We have lost our virtues because
there is no joy out of it, no reward.

20
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,139
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer;

21
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,600
if somebody’s good, he has to suffer; is
somebody’s kind, he thinks he has to suffer;

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,320
but after getting Realization you
are rewarded for your virtues.

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,520
You are amazed how you are paid
for it, it’s so surprising,

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,480
like once there was a lady who came to see
Me, she was a refugee, and I had a big house.

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,580
So I said, “All right come and stay with Me."

26
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,400
So My husband, My brother they
came, they said, “What’s this?

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,320
You don’t know her, who she is, her husband,

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,080
whether he is her husband or
not, just given her two rooms.

29
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,740
It’s not good!”

30
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,480
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter.

31
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,405
I know for nothing is going
to happen, let her be here."

32
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,580
So they wouldn’t also go against Me.

33
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,840
They said, “All right, if you say so."

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,780
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.

35
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,700
Then she become a very well-known actress in
India, I didn’t know she was the same lady,

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,560
but somebody told Me that she is the same lady.

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,069
I said, “Maybe."

38
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,485
Then one day you see, they wanted
to make a film for our Sahaja Yoga,

39
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,760
so they said, “We can ask this lady to
act, because she is a good actress."

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,860
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don’t tell
her I am here, otherwise she will have no choice.

41
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,420
I will not go and see her.

42
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,740
You just ask her."

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,860
They went and ask her, they said,
“Will you be actress?” and all that.

44
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,940
She said, “I’ll try."

45
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,140
This, that she was saying.

46
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,060
But on the day on when they were going to open the
film I went there, she saw Me, she was so amazed,

47
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,800
she said, “Oh God, You are the One, You
are the One Who is sponsoring this, Oh,

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,460
I’ll give my life for Her!” She just came
forward, she said, “Have anything you like,

49
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,692
I have nothing to say, I am so sorry
that you never told me that She’s there."

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,563
Thousand times more she rewarded
a little thing I did for her.

51
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,840
No more cheating, no more troubling,

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,480
you become a wonderful person and so many
people become your friends in this world.

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,520
Your have to just tell you are coming, there will
hundred people at the airport to receive you.

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,480
There will be so many friends all over
the world for you, you will be amazed.

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,700
It’s such a tremendous thing happens,
because now you all are awakened in

56
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,760
that Primordial Being and you
have become one with each other.

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,960
You can feel it, that oneness, that unison that
we are all not only human beings but we are yogis,

58
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,440
we are super human beings, and we
have to look after the whole world.

59
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,980
That feeling of compassion is
so overwhelming that all little,

60
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,736
little stupid things just fall
off, there’s no place for that.

61
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,020
This actually happens and has happened with many.

62
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:50,700
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories,

63
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,860
but there are many, some of them were so hot
tempered, some of them were so quarrelsome,

64
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,340
some them used to fight so much
in the beginning that I thought,

65
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,700
“How are they going to be all right?” But today I
find them as great friends and very great yogis.

66
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,680
So this is the center where
your religion is awakened.

67
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,000
And what is a religion?

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Word comes from “religo,” in Sanskrit it means
dharma, “Dhariyatisa Dharma,” the sustenance,

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,700
your sustenance, your valances is your religion.

70
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,580
As every atom, carbon has four valances,
and in the same way you have ten valances,

71
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:34,301
these are the ten commandments that were told
to you and you become that, you just become.

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,132
I don’t have to tell you as commandments but they
become your beautiful ornaments within yourself.

73
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,652
This happens automatically, so
spontaneously you become that.
