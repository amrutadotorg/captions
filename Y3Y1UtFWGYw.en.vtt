00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Public Program, Teesside Polytechnic, Middlesbrough (England), 31 July 1984.

00:02.080 --> 00:06.080
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:10.280 --> 00:15.000
First of all, we have to know what truth means.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.000
We want to seek truth,

00:19.000 --> 00:23.240
there’s an urge within us that we have to seek the truth.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.240
Because of this seeking only we all have become human beings.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Now after human beings' stage, what is going to happen to us?

00:35.280 --> 00:40.000
As it is, you find there is so much of confusion in this world,

00:40.080 --> 00:44.000
so much of confusion, so many ideas, so many thoughts,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
so many ideologies, so many religions. All kinds of things

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
have come up and a simple human starts looking at it

00:55.080 --> 00:57.000
and he gets quite puzzled,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
“What sort of thing this world is?”

00:59.080 --> 01:02.000
It’s a very confused world, first of all.

01:02.280 --> 01:06.000
The confusion gives you a greater urge to seek,

01:08.080 --> 01:11.000
because you find, “What’s this going on?”

01:11.080 --> 01:14.280
Secondly, I went round your city today

01:15.000 --> 01:17.080
just to vibrate the whole place

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
and I felt the place has got a kind of a feeling of dullness

01:23.000 --> 01:25.160
and I asked the person who was driving Me,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.160
I said, “Why the people here are looking very dull?”

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
He said, “The people are now without any jobs,”

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
so, I said that should happen to any country which is so industrially developed.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.000
When we are industrially developed, you see,

01:41.000 --> 01:45.080
all our industrial wants are over perhaps,

01:46.000 --> 01:47.280
then we start seeking more

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
because we think now we’ve got everything,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
we’ve got proper dress to wear, we’ve got food, we’ve got everything,

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
now what next? And that’s how we become dull

01:57.080 --> 02:00.080
because we don’t understand the meaning of life.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Now this meaning of life is more in the people who are affluent

02:06.000 --> 02:10.080
and has to be less in the people who are still developing

02:10.280 --> 02:13.000
because they want to become like you,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
have all plastics around them,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
they want to have foundries with all pollution, everything.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Once they have that then they will start seeking.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.080
But in a country like India

02:24.000 --> 02:26.280
which has been a very different type of a country I say,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
because of climatic position. It’s very good climate,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
like this, it is always there, so you can be always out in the villages,

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
you can be in the forest and you don’t have to worry so much

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
to fight the nature. So in such a place people have been meditating

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
and trying to find out, “Why are we here?”

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Now all these things when you see the development everywhere,

02:50.000 --> 02:54.080
you find it’s like the tree, the tree outside you see very well developed.

02:54.280 --> 02:59.000
But any tree that has developed very much must have very deep roots,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
otherwise it will be all finished and destroyed.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.080
So when there is such a lot of development outside,

03:05.240 --> 03:09.000
there must have been some development inside also, the roots.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
And this is what we are going to tell you about the roots now

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
because your development is sufficiently enough and if

03:16.000 --> 03:20.080
you have to sustain this development you must know about your roots.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
We have neglected our roots very much

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
and that’s the reason today we also find people suffering

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
from terminal diseases and all kinds of trouble.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
That is one of the first worry for Me

03:31.080 --> 03:33.080
that everyone should be healthy

03:34.000 --> 03:38.160
and that health comes to you not from outside, from inside.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.080
Because supposing if on a tree you find a leaf is sick

03:42.280 --> 03:45.080
and you start treating the leaf, you don’t treat the tree.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.000
You don’t treat the disease at all.

03:47.080 --> 03:51.000
But if you have some means of entering into the roots, you treat

03:51.080 --> 03:57.000
the whole of that tree very well, very easily in a very simple manner.

03:57.280 --> 04:01.000
In the same way if you can somehow reach your roots,

04:01.080 --> 04:08.000
you can treat yourself without much difficulty, without any medicine also.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.000
Now where are these roots?

04:10.080 --> 04:12.000
Uh, for that you have to see to this chart,

04:12.080 --> 04:15.000
I don’t know if everybody can see this chart,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
that within us this beautiful instrument is placed,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
and this is what is described in the Bible as the tree of life.

04:23.080 --> 04:30.080
Unless and until you achieve a state which we call as self-realization,

04:30.080 --> 04:34.000
which Christ called as the second birth

04:35.000 --> 04:37.080
we cannot understand what is this.

04:37.160 --> 04:41.000
Because now you are listening to Me very closely

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
but if I say, “Pay attention to yourself within,” you cannot.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
It’s a difficult thing, our attention is outside.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Now what should happen for that?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
There’s a happening that takes place,

04:53.000 --> 04:57.160
because of that happening your attention is attracted inside.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.240
And once the attention is inside,

04:59.240 --> 05:04.080
the same attention gets the enlightenment of this power

05:04.080 --> 05:08.000
which is within you, us in the sacrum bone,

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
sacrum meaning sacred, that means the Greeks knew about it.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.080
When this power rises, awakens, it’s like the plumule in the seed,

05:17.080 --> 05:20.000
the germinating power of a seed

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
and it just gives you a new dimension.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.080
It enriches your subtle centers.

05:28.000 --> 05:35.000
These subtle centers actually are the subtle entities of the gross plexuses.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.280
When they’re exhausted you suffer from diseases.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Now for example, today’s article made Me think that I should tell you

05:45.080 --> 05:48.000
how we get a particular disease called horrible cancer

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
and that is so common in the West,

05:51.280 --> 05:56.000
not so much in the developing countries as it is here.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
They say cancer is a rich man’s disease.

06:00.080 --> 06:06.000
The thing is that within us there are two systems,

06:06.280 --> 06:10.000
of nervous systems which cater us.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
One of them is the one called as the central nervous system

06:14.080 --> 06:18.000
another is the one which we call as autonomous nervous system.

06:18.280 --> 06:22.000
Now the doctors are honest, they just call it by name, autonomous.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Now if you ask them, “Who is this auto,” they won’t be able to tell you.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Just they call it some name, autonomous.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.080
This auto is the Spirit in the heart

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
and this auto if you somehow or other bring into your attention

06:38.000 --> 06:40.280
the light of the auto comes into your attention,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.280
you start controlling your being completely.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
This is a simple method I’m telling you.

06:47.080 --> 06:50.000
Now the nature of the roots is such

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
that this autonomous nervous system has three channels.

06:55.080 --> 06:58.240
The two channels of the left and the right sympathetic nervous system

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
and the central one is the parasympathetic. Now you can see here

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
the three channels but these are the subtle channels

07:05.160 --> 07:12.000
which control, which control the gross channels.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.080
Now these subtle channels work out in such a way

07:16.080 --> 07:20.000
that the left-side channel caters to your past,

07:20.080 --> 07:24.000
caters to what has happened, caters to your conditioning

07:24.000 --> 07:28.080
It is what we call is the channel of the moon,

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
or this is the one that works out the power of desire within us.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
The right-side channel is the channel which works out the action,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.240
so it is the channel of the action, caters to your future,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.160
to your mental activities and to your physical activities.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.240
It is called as the channel of the sun.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
Now both of them are parallel to each other.

07:56.240 --> 08:00.080
Now when a human being tries to find out something,

08:00.080 --> 08:04.000
he tries always to go to the extremes, in anything.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Supposing he goes to the pub then he must drink the whole of it.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.240
If he goes to some other work, he must finish off his work with

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
completely dedication, as they call it and exhaust all his life doing that.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.160
Always we go to extremes, either to the left or to the right.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.160
Now if a person is a person of moderation, he stays in the center.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
The central path is for our evolution.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.280
The whole of matter has evolved, as you know there’s a chart

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
and in the chart if you find the periodic laws the nature are

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
so beautifully made and it is all very much balanced.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And in the center lies the carbon

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
and the carbon is in the first center lies within us.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Now all these centers are nothing but the steps of our evolution.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.280
Like we were first carbon, then we became animals,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
then we became human beings and now we are seekers.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.280
That’s how we develop one after another and the evolution takes place

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
and we become human beings.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.080
Now the question comes, what next?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.080
Why are we here?

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
We are human beings but what are we to achieve next.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.160
If this question doesn’t come into your mind

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
then it will come later on, no doubt,

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
but it’s better that the time is here for you to seek that;

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
why are we on this earth?

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
We are here on this earth, like this instrument if you make,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
you’ll ask, “Mother why are you making this instrument?”

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
This instrument is made to carry My voice.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
In the same way you, the human beings are made instruments of God.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.080
Now you are to be employed by God and He’s going to use you

09:56.160 --> 09:59.000
and this power is going to flow through you.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Only thing is, you have to be connected to the mains

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
and this connection takes place through the ascent of this Kundalini

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
which is actually the Holy Ghost in the Bible.

10:11.080 --> 10:15.000
In the Bible nothing has been written about Holy Ghost as such.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
I asked a priest, “What do you mean by Holy Ghost?”

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So he tells Me, “I’m agnostic about it.”

10:20.280 --> 10:23.000
So I said, “Then why are you there? What are you doing?”

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
So he says, “I’m doing my job.”, you see.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.240
There’s no job in God’s realm,

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
like that where you can get money without knowing what you are doing.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
You’re supposed to know what you are doing.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.000
You are supposed to know what Holy Ghost is

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
and you are supposed to know where it is.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
You just cannot get a job, become something

10:44.000 --> 10:47.080
and profess something without knowing much about it.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And this is what is the dilemma of today’s religions,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
not one but all of them.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.080
They do not know that they have to be born again,

10:56.080 --> 10:59.000
first of all, to profess any religion.

10:59.240 --> 11:03.000
Christ has said so clearly that you are to be born again.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.080
And when Nicodemus asked Him, “What do you mean by born again?

11:06.280 --> 11:10.000
Have I to enter into my womb again?” He said, “No.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
The flesh gives birth to flesh but I’m talking about the Holy Spirit.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
The Holy Spirit has to give birth to your Spirit.”

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
And that’s what it is, the Holy Spirit within you

11:26.000 --> 11:32.000
is this three and a half-coiled Kundalini or the Holy Spirit.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.160
Now through meditative processes because as I told you

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
the attention of Indians was more inward

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
so they tried to find out how we are made.

11:41.240 --> 11:45.000
And this is not the knowledge of today, it’s a very ancient knowledge.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
A book written about a person fourteen thousand years back

11:50.160 --> 11:54.160
has described in all details all the things I’m telling you

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
but we have never come to know about it.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Neither we tried to look at it. Even about Christ there’s so much

12:00.080 --> 12:03.000
written in those books thousands of years back

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
About Mohamad thousands of years back,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
we never try to translate those things

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
or bring this knowledge to that level that everybody could read it.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
But now it is possible for you to understand

12:15.000 --> 12:19.280
that you’re not only the body, mind, ego, superego,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.080
but you’re something much more.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.080
And that much more is the Spirit

12:23.240 --> 12:27.000
and the truth is that you have to become the Spirit.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.080
Once you become the Spirit,

12:29.240 --> 12:31.000
means when you become the light

12:31.080 --> 12:34.080
what you do exactly is to give the light.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
But before that there are lots of hurdles,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.280
like as I told you there’s cancer, this, that, all kinds of diseases

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
that hurt human beings.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
There are mental diseases, there are emotional problems,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
there are all kinds of problems and they can only be solved

12:52.280 --> 12:55.000
if you go to your roots.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.080
Now let us see a simple case of cancer,

12:58.240 --> 13:02.160
for Me, it is simple because it can be cured very simply.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Now for example, you take one of the centers,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.280
it’s like this within us, like this, you can see, all of you.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
And this center is inside here.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
While this is the left and the right sympathetic nervous systems

13:16.000 --> 13:19.160
and in the center, we can say is the parasympathetic

13:20.000 --> 13:21.080
which supplies the balance,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
which supplies all the energy that is needed for the left and the right.

13:25.240 --> 13:29.000
When we go into any emergency, for example, if you start running

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
then the heart starts pulsating very fast

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
But it comes to normal through the central path of parasympathetic.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Now what happens that this center supposing

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
is used too much because of our extreme habits,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
you see, you use too much. Anyway, then what happens, that

13:45.280 --> 13:52.000
starts breaking this chain and you lose your contact with the whole.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Then you become on your own, means you become malignant.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.160
The cells become malignant; they start eating other cells

14:02.280 --> 14:05.000
without any relationship to the whole.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
You don’t know how far to go.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Supposing you develop a cancer of the nose,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.240
the nose cells start becoming bigger, they start eating other cells

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
and whosoever they touch, like an egotistical man, like Hitler,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
whosoever they touch, that cell again becomes malignant

14:22.080 --> 14:26.000
and then that starts eating and that’s how the whole body

14:26.000 --> 14:30.080
becomes malignant. This is how cancer is set in, a simple thing.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.280
But recently, about a year back, I saw a very interesting

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
television show of the doctors. They said that

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
the vulnerability of cancer is present in every human being

14:42.080 --> 14:44.280
because we live on extremes all the time,

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
but the triggering takes place when some entity attacks you

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
from the area built in within you since your creation.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.280
And this area we call in Sahaja Yoga as the collective subconscious.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
That is whatever is dead within us resides in that area.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Now this is the area beyond the left sympathetic.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
So those people who go too much to the left side,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.280
too much to the emotional side

15:14.000 --> 15:16.240
or those who go and bow to wrong type of gurus,

15:17.000 --> 15:22.160
wrong type of people and accept wrong type of religions I should say

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
where you take to dead, to spiritualists, spiritual work and

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
all those things are very much vulnerable to diseases like cancer.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.000
Cancer is not the right-side disease

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
but heart attack could be a right side as well as a left side disease.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have two types of hearts, not one type.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.160
One is the over active, another is the lethargic heart.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.080
Now the people who are over active, you see, all the time running,

15:49.280 --> 15:55.000
looking at the watches and just on the run, you see,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
all such people have an over active heart

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
which is absolutely exhausted.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.080
And the attention is so much outside that the Spirit in the heart

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
is agitated and it recedes and you get a heart attack.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.000
Now there’s another type of a heart which is lethargic,

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
which takes to emotional side, weeps all the time, sings about the past,

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
“My father was so rich and I’m so poor,” all those things, you see,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
specially the ladies have that problem.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
And then when they start talking too much about the left side

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
then what happens, the lethargic heart becomes a problem

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
because you develop symptoms like angina and all these things.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.080
So we have two types of hearts.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.280
Now you cannot treat a person who has two styles,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I mean, everybody cannot be treated the same way

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
because we have two types of heart troubles.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Now in the medical science which I have done Myself

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
is there’s only one type of human being.

16:55.160 --> 16:58.000
They do not separate one from another.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
But in everyday life you see we are so different from each other.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
So there are three types of people actually,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
one of them are the ones who are futuristic,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
another are the ones who live in the past

17:11.000 --> 17:13.080
and the others who are in the center.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.000
And they have three types of combinations then,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
that permutations and combinations work out with these,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
mainly, we should say, nine types of people.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
But then there can be even greater permutations and combinations

17:27.000 --> 17:31.160
depending on the kinds of people they meet, the kinds of people

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
they admire or live with, or dominated with or dominate.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
So we have very complicated human beings in this world,

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
doesn’t matter but they can brought down to the simple thing

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
as left, right and center.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.160
If you can bring them down and classify them to these three things

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
it’s very easy to treat them.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.000
Because if somebody is a right-sided person,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
he’ll have certain symptoms, he’ll be hot-tempered fellow,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
he’ll have a liver trouble. he’ll be thin,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
he’ll be shouting all the time on top of his voice.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
He may be good outside but in his family he would be very hot-tempered.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.000
He may be a person who is egoistical but maybe

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
that he’ll look very humble because he has to deal with people

18:19.080 --> 18:23.000
and maybe that he may be very, very aggressive

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
to such a point that he might become sadistic.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
Now the another type are the other ones who want always to run away,

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
escape, they could be these, not people who will be grossly aggressive

18:34.080 --> 18:39.000
but will be very sly and will be trying all tricks and playing games

18:39.000 --> 18:41.080
and intrigues and all sorts of things

18:41.160 --> 18:45.000
and also, they will be living with their past, this type of thing.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.000
Now there are people who are in the center,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
the people who are moderate, who take life pleasantly,

18:51.000 --> 18:56.080
not bothered so much about life, life’s complications

18:56.080 --> 19:00.000
but keep above it. And they lead a very normal life,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
they do not indulge into any nonsensical things.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
These are the central type of people and that’s why

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
all the religions came on this earth to establish that balance within.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
Religions, all of them came on this earth to establish that balance.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.080
Why the balance, again the question can come up, why the balance.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.000
The balance is for our ultimate ascent,

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
for example, if you have to take an aero plane, ascend it,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
you have to first see if it is balanced or not,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
otherwise, it will be not floating horizontally

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
but it might go one-sided, you see so one has to have a balance in life.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
But if you read yourself, if you face yourself you will understand that,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
“No, we are not so much balanced as we should have been.”

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
So this balance has to be brought in, in human beings

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
and that’s why we had great prophets on this earth

19:54.080 --> 19:56.000
to teach us the balance.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
And these prophets came at a time where we needed this balance,

20:00.160 --> 20:04.000
at every time people became imbalanced, they came on this earth

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
to teach us balance.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
When this balance is lost, mostly we develop diseases.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
Even in religious things we can be very imbalanced.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Like I’ve seen people reading Bible for three hours,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
what is the need to read Bible?

20:19.080 --> 20:22.000
I mean, for three hours you don’t learn anything.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
Actually, if you understand religion, is not to be read,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
but to be felt and experienced within yourself.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
Religion is like the ten valences of human beings.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And the ten valences of the human beings

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
when we lose the valence, we lose our balance.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.000
Now anything like, say a country

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
which is over-developed loses its balance.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.000
A country which is under-developed also can lose its balance.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.080
Anywhere it can happen the same way,

20:49.280 --> 20:52.280
makes no difference whether you’re developed or under-developed,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
you are in the same way whether the balance is up or down,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
makes no difference. So it is like that.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Now with the Kundalini what happens,

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
the first thing it does is to create the balance within.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.000
When She rises in that part of the thing, area of the stomach

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
it creates the balance, it brings forth the balance.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Once the balance has come then it’s much easier for you

21:19.000 --> 21:22.160
to balance all the chakras which have gone upside down

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
or which are crooked and the balance comes and fix them together.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.080
With that balance the chakras get their forms all right

21:31.280 --> 21:34.000
and because of that the Kundalini rises.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
She rises and pierces through your fontanelle bone area

21:38.000 --> 21:40.160
which is the true baptism.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
It’s not like somebody coming putting water onto your head

21:43.000 --> 21:45.160
and say, “Now you’re baptized.” And we accept it.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
It’s just an exercise, there’s no truth about it.

21:50.240 --> 21:55.000
The cool breeze of the Holy Ghost has to be felt on top of your head.

21:55.280 --> 22:01.000
So the truth has to be felt on your central nervous system,

22:01.000 --> 22:04.080
that means you must feel them on your fingertips.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Mohamad Sahib has clearly said that

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
at the time of Resurrection your hands will speak.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
But nobody wants to talk of Resurrection,

22:13.160 --> 22:17.000
nobody wants to talk of something that is good to happen,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
that there will be a period where people will be redeemed,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
that there will be a Redeemer, there will be a Counsellor;

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
nobody wants to talk of that.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.080
They want to talk of the doomsday because people will be frightened

22:30.280 --> 22:33.000
and they’ll be pouring money for them.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
It’s a money-making fright which is created in people.

22:38.280 --> 22:42.080
The God Almighty who has created this beautiful universe

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
has created you as special people who are human beings,

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
do you think He’s going to allow us to destroy His great creation?

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
He’s made us so beautifully within ourselves

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
and we have to just understand that you’re not what you seem to be,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.160
you’re much greater, you’re much more, you are glorified by Him.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.280
Because only this thing has to happen and once it happens

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
you’ll be surprised that you become in charge of yourself,

23:16.240 --> 23:20.160
that you become empowered with that power of God

23:21.000 --> 23:22.240
which flows through you.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
You can cure people, you can help people, you can raise Kundalini,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
you can get rid of all these stupid problems,

23:31.080 --> 23:35.080
all these big problems and all the universal problems

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
because a transformation takes place within you.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.280
We had an alcoholic in Brighton one day,

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
he came to the program completely drunk and he started abusing Me.

23:46.240 --> 23:51.000
I just smiled at him. Next day he came and he got his realization.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Today he’s a first-class man, he’s earning such a lot of money,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.000
he’s doing so well.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
So what happens to you that you become yourself

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
and to become yourself means you become the Spirit,

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
and Spirit is the reflection of God within yourself.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Once that happens, you become the dynamic power of God

24:12.000 --> 24:15.080
and you’re surprised the miraculous way you’re helped.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.080
Now of course, Sahaja Yoga has definitely cured cancer, no doubt,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
it can cure so many diseases.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.280
But when we wrote to the British council about it

24:25.000 --> 24:27.080
and they found out that we were curing people, they said,

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
“There’s a big red tape going on,” they’ve to go through the files,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
they have to find out, this, that.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
So we said, “All right, doesn’t matter, let them have their own time.”

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
But Sahaja Yoga is not only for physical being

24:41.160 --> 24:43.000
because you are not only physical being.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
I tell you there are many wrestlers and boxers

24:46.000 --> 24:49.240
who come to Me and say, “Mother,” who are very, very sturdy people,

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
they say, “Mother, we have no peace, give us peace.”

24:52.240 --> 24:56.240
So it is not for physical being, it is not for mental being,

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
it’s not for emotional being but it is for your spiritual being.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
But as you’re the temple of God, the temple has to be cleansed.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
When some guest is coming to your house, we clean the house,

25:08.080 --> 25:11.000
make it beautiful, put flowers, decorate it.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.160
In the same way, when your Spirit is going to enter into your attention

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
your body has to be cleansed; your mind has to be purified

25:19.000 --> 25:24.240
and that you have to become a beautiful temple for that enlightenment.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.280
And that’s how as a by-product of this Kundalini awakening you get cured.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.200
Now what happens to your awareness,

25:32.200 --> 25:35.000
that you become collectively conscious.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.080
You become, again I say there’s no certificate.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.320
In Sahaja Yoga there’s no membership,

25:40.080 --> 25:43.080
of course you must have heard, there’s no money to be paid or anything.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.280
I mean, it is stupid, how can you pay money to God,

25:45.280 --> 25:47.160
what does He understand about money?

25:47.200 --> 25:50.080
How much money are you going to pay for yourself, first of all?

25:50.120 --> 25:53.080
He has given beautiful eyes to us, what do we pay Him, nothing;

25:53.080 --> 25:55.040
on the contrary we spoil them all the time

25:55.080 --> 25:58.280
by looking at things with lust and greed, we spoil them.

25:59.080 --> 26:02.240
We have adultery in our eyes, so we spoil them, the beautiful

26:02.280 --> 26:06.040
innocent eyes that He has given us, the pure eyes, we spoil them.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.280
But when you’re awakened, your eyes become so beautiful

26:09.320 --> 26:12.160
that you look at the person, the person gets all right.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.080
Your presence, merely your presence can help so many.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.000
But you have to achieve that state.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.120
Now as he said, you cannot demand it, you see, there’s no shop here.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.280
In a shop you pay the money so you can demand,

26:27.280 --> 26:30.200
“All right, come along, this was bad and I paid so much money.”

26:30.280 --> 26:35.280
But here what do you give? Your seeking, you’re seeking the higher being,

26:35.320 --> 26:38.080
you are not seeking your cure but you’re seeking

26:38.120 --> 26:40.040
the higher being within you.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.280
The property, the wealth of spirituality that resides in all of us.

26:44.040 --> 26:50.080
It is there, it is all there, only thing we have to pay attention to it and get it.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.280
Now you become collectively conscious means you start feeling

26:53.280 --> 26:56.080
other people on your fingertips.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.200
Even a child can say, “This is the problem, this is the problem,”

26:59.200 --> 27:02.080
now you have to just know what these denote

27:02.080 --> 27:05.080
and that’s what I have decoded that this means heart,

27:05.080 --> 27:08.080
this means something else, this means something else

27:08.080 --> 27:11.080
and all the centers, the five and the sixth and the seventh centers,

27:11.120 --> 27:13.000
on the left and the right-hand side.

27:13.080 --> 27:16.080
So immediately you’ll know the person’s suffering.

27:16.200 --> 27:20.040
But we don’t talk like doctors, we don’t say,

27:20.080 --> 27:22.120
“This fellow is egoistical,” not like that.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.320
But we’ll say, “His Agnya chakra in the front is catching,”

27:25.080 --> 27:27.240
that means he’s egoistical. But we don’t say that.

27:27.240 --> 27:30.080
Even a person will come and say, “Mother today my Agnya is catching,

27:30.120 --> 27:32.280
just take it out,” meaning, “I’ve been egoistical.”

27:33.120 --> 27:37.000
So the language is different as you must have read in the Bible

27:37.080 --> 27:39.280
that when they got their realization through the Holy Ghost

27:39.280 --> 27:42.040
they started speaking in strange languages.

27:42.080 --> 27:46.080
That doesn’t mean that they started speaking in Latin or Hebrew.

27:46.080 --> 27:51.080
It means that they started speaking in the languages of chakras,

27:51.160 --> 27:53.280
of centers, of the subtle centers.

27:54.040 --> 27:57.200
They started talking about the channels,

27:57.240 --> 28:00.280
because you become subtle, you start seeing something subtle.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.320
Like the way you see colors, animals do not see.

28:04.080 --> 28:07.080
The way you see filth and dirt the animals do not see.

28:07.160 --> 28:11.080
But when you become realized souls you see the dirt and filth of a

28:11.240 --> 28:17.000
much subtler nature. That is the sin that they call it or anything like that.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.080
So you become separated from this,

28:19.120 --> 28:22.160
and you start witnessing the whole world like a witness.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.120
You become collectively conscious, so supposing you get cured,

28:26.200 --> 28:31.080
so-called by Me, so-called, I would say, then there’s no obligation

28:31.080 --> 28:34.080
because if you’re part and parcel of Me, whom do I help?

28:34.160 --> 28:38.080
If this finger is paining and I rub it like this, whom do I help,

28:38.120 --> 28:40.080
I help Myself, isn’t it?

28:40.160 --> 28:42.320
So you become part and parcel of the whole

28:43.080 --> 28:45.080
and when you become part and parcel of the whole,

28:45.160 --> 28:48.160
the whole thing works out in such a homogenous way.

28:48.280 --> 28:51.200
As a result of that the people in England

28:51.240 --> 28:55.080
who were suffering from many diseases, people in Australia,

28:55.080 --> 28:57.040
so many countries now we have,

28:57.080 --> 29:01.200
most of the European countries we have tackled, have been cured.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.280
They have been cured of their diseases, of their ailments,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.240
they’ve become so powerful that they have no habits,

29:10.080 --> 29:13.240
nothing can deter them. They’re very joyous, happy people,

29:13.280 --> 29:17.000
if you see their photographs, you’ll say they’re lotuses sitting down

29:17.080 --> 29:21.040
beautifully pink. And the same thing is happening in India

29:21.080 --> 29:25.240
where I’m working for a much shorter time than I have worked in England.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.160
England has a special place; I must say because in the universe

29:29.200 --> 29:32.160
England is the heart of the universe.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.280
Perhaps you do not realize, you’re not aware of it.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.080
But English are very balanced people compared to

29:38.160 --> 29:41.280
all other Western people, I must say. But despite that

29:42.040 --> 29:44.280
sometimes you go off because you’ve lost your confidence,

29:45.080 --> 29:47.280
you try to follow French, you try to follow Americans,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.120
they have to follow you, not that you have to follow them.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.200
You can articulate.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.120
Now once upon a time it was the industrial development

29:55.160 --> 29:59.240
and all these things were there, so you articulated into these

30:00.080 --> 30:05.120
but now that is over. Now it has to be spiritual development,

30:05.240 --> 30:10.040
for that also I think one has to work out in England.

30:10.120 --> 30:13.160
And that’s how perhaps My husband got elected to this job

30:13.240 --> 30:16.160
and had to come to England. I’ve been here for ten years

30:16.200 --> 30:19.320
while in India I was just two years after I started My work.

30:20.080 --> 30:24.080
Of course I travel all over and the most wonderful thing I’ve found out

30:24.160 --> 30:29.160
about the Western people is that their hankering is no more now

30:29.200 --> 30:34.080
for material things. It looks little bit but is not so much.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.320
Once they get to their realization, they want to save others,

30:37.040 --> 30:38.200
they want to help others.

30:38.240 --> 30:42.160
Now all the way Dr. Warren has come from Australia.

30:42.280 --> 30:45.080
Now they said the psychology is such

30:45.080 --> 30:49.080
if the Australians talk to the English, they feel happy.

30:49.160 --> 30:54.160
So we sent English to America and you’ll be surprised that in Houston

30:54.240 --> 30:57.080
an Englishman went there and he was regarded as a very

30:57.080 --> 31:00.280
respectable man, you see, and they all listened to him nicely.

31:01.040 --> 31:05.320
It’s a funny psychology but we have great Sahaja Yogis even in England.

31:06.080 --> 31:10.200
In England we have very great people who have mastered this art

31:10.320 --> 31:14.120
and once you know this you become so scholarly

31:14.200 --> 31:15.200
that many a times

31:15.200 --> 31:17.080
these newspaper people ask Me,

31:17.120 --> 31:22.240
“Have you got all your disciples as scholars?”

31:23.080 --> 31:25.280
I said, “No, they’re not My disciples, they’re children.”

31:26.040 --> 31:29.280
But they become scholarly because they get to the essence of knowledge

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
and this is the true knowledge.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.320
The otherwise whatever knowledge we have is of the dead.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.080
For example I was looking at your foundries, what do we do?

31:40.080 --> 31:43.040
We take out the dead and make something out of it.

31:44.320 --> 31:48.320
Can we make anything living? Can we transform these flowers into fruits?

31:49.080 --> 31:54.040
We cannot. After realization you start doing the living work

31:54.080 --> 31:59.240
and this is the process which a living work of living God.

32:00.080 --> 32:02.320
So you just cannot say that, “I stand on my head

32:03.080 --> 32:06.320
and I get the Kundalini there,” or, “I cut my hair short or

32:07.080 --> 32:11.080
I have another kind of a dress.” It’s nothing outside.

32:11.120 --> 32:15.160
It’s inside the happening takes place and you become another person.

32:15.240 --> 32:20.320
In Sanskrit language we call a bird as dwijaha, means born again

32:21.080 --> 32:25.120
and a Brahmin, the one who has known the power of Brahma,

32:25.200 --> 32:28.240
the power of God’s love, is called also dwijaha.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.240
Dwijaha, means the one who is born again.

32:32.040 --> 32:37.080
Now a bird is first is an egg and then it becomes a bird.

32:37.280 --> 32:43.120
That’s why you’ll be surprised that Christ when He was crucified

32:43.240 --> 32:48.160
and when He was resurrected on the Easter day it is to show

32:48.240 --> 32:53.280
that a person leaves this material body and becomes the Spirit.

32:54.080 --> 32:58.080
Resurrection is the message of Christ which is a very great thing

32:58.080 --> 33:02.360
He achieved because He was nothing but Himself the Brahma,

33:03.080 --> 33:06.400
the Chaitanya, Omkara, what you call the word. So that’s why He could

33:07.040 --> 33:10.320
achieve that thing. It’s all written about Him in Indian Scriptures.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.080
You have to go out to see all these things,

33:13.120 --> 33:15.280
what is the thing written about Christ.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.080
Bible cannot contain Him within Himself

33:18.080 --> 33:21.080
and the four years life that He led in this misery

33:21.280 --> 33:25.040
is not representative of His whole background.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.240
If you have to know about His background you have to read

33:27.280 --> 33:30.160
some books which were written fourteen thousand years back.

33:30.280 --> 33:35.280
They have told about that. So when He resurrected what we do,

33:35.320 --> 33:42.200
we present an egg on the Easter Sunday. What does that mean?

33:42.280 --> 33:47.080
That on an Easter Sunday you’re an egg and on the Easter Monday

33:47.160 --> 33:53.080
you are the bird. But we don’t know, we do it just automatically

33:53.160 --> 33:56.320
without understanding why we give those eggs to people.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.320
This is what we have to understand. Even to understand Bible

34:01.000 --> 34:04.280
we have to be self-realized, even to understand the life of Christ

34:04.320 --> 34:08.240
which was just so great we have to be realized.

34:08.280 --> 34:12.080
Now the controversy about Christ has started, it really pains Me

34:12.080 --> 34:15.080
that these people don’t want to take their realization,

34:15.080 --> 34:20.120
otherwise how can you explain to them any miracle whatsoever?

34:21.240 --> 34:22.400
Life is full of miracles.

34:23.080 --> 34:26.120
Even in My lifetime people have seen miracles happening.

34:26.280 --> 34:31.040
I don’t know if they have brought the photograph. Once I was giving

34:31.080 --> 34:35.160
a lecture in a very remote village where there was a very great soul

34:35.240 --> 34:38.280
who had died. And as soon as I entered the village I told them,

34:38.320 --> 34:40.200
“Who was the great soul who lived here?”

34:40.280 --> 34:42.320
They said he was a Muslim called as Mian.

34:43.080 --> 34:47.240
And I sat down for My lecture and suddenly I found that I got connected

34:47.280 --> 34:50.280
and there was a big light on My head coming.

34:50.320 --> 34:54.280
And then I saw it seven times the light was there and I got connected

34:54.360 --> 34:58.080
and it showed that, that he was there with Me.

34:58.240 --> 35:02.000
And then suddenly I stopped it, like this laughing.

35:02.120 --> 35:06.320
Imagine the photograph was taken by one girl

35:07.040 --> 35:09.240
and all these seven stages were clearly shown

35:09.280 --> 35:11.080
and you could see the light there.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.360
Now these boys went to show to someone, they said,

35:14.000 --> 35:16.120
“Oh, you must have arranged all these in the village.”

35:16.280 --> 35:20.280
But it was not, in that remote village there is no electricity also.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.280
So where’s the question of… and why should we arrange that?

35:23.320 --> 35:27.280
There are so many miracles that have taken place in Sahaja Yoga,

35:27.360 --> 35:29.080
so many miracles.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.400
I mean the President of India was cured of his cancer

35:32.080 --> 35:33.320
in five minutes, you won’t believe it.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.080
He came to London from his operation

35:36.160 --> 35:39.040
and it was very unsuccessful and he was going to die.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.320
And because of My husband I went to see him.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.240
We knew him otherwise but he didn’t know Me

35:44.240 --> 35:46.040
that I was also Mataji Nirmala Devi

35:46.120 --> 35:48.080
because I don’t tell this to these bureaucrats,

35:48.200 --> 35:50.080
they’re rather difficult people.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.320
So it so happened that one of the…

35:52.440 --> 35:56.200
that was B. K. Nehru who was the High Commissioner,

35:56.200 --> 36:00.160
he told, “Do you know this lady is Mataji Nirmala Devi?”

36:00.320 --> 36:03.240
And the wife of the President had heard My name

36:03.280 --> 36:05.320
as Mataji Nirmala Devi also

36:06.200 --> 36:09.160
and she said, “Mataji, why don’t you cure my husband?”

36:09.440 --> 36:13.200
And he said, “Yes I didn’t know you were Mataji Nirmala Devi.”

36:13.240 --> 36:16.080
I said, “All right.” So I put My hand on his back.

36:16.080 --> 36:19.400
In five minutes…, he could not sleep, he was so much with pain.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.400
He said, ”I’m feeling so relieved I want to lie down and sleep.”

36:23.080 --> 36:26.120
He went off to sleep. They had prepared for his cremation

36:26.200 --> 36:29.080
and everything in India and a big show was there, imagine,

36:29.080 --> 36:31.080
and they reached with the ambulance there.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.080
And there he walked down the steps and they saw him, they thought,

36:34.080 --> 36:36.200
“Is this his ghost walking or what?”

36:36.240 --> 36:39.240
He told Me all the story in a very jocular way

36:39.320 --> 36:44.320
and he said that, “I don’t know, I went, after that I forgot that I was sick

36:44.360 --> 36:49.360
and I went on a tour.” And next year when I went his wife showed Me

36:49.400 --> 36:53.320
that even the mark of the operation had gone, but I must say he must

36:53.400 --> 36:58.120
have been a very great soul to get that way, in such a simple way.

36:58.200 --> 37:01.240
And then he said, “You must have Mother some land because you must

37:01.240 --> 37:04.080
have some place where people should meet you.”

37:04.200 --> 37:06.240
And so he allotted some land to us

37:06.320 --> 37:08.400
and that’s how now we have some land in Delhi.

37:08.400 --> 37:14.280
But what I’m trying to tell you that miracles are the nature of God.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.400
For human beings He’s miraculous, isn’t it? He’s not human being,

37:18.080 --> 37:20.080
how can we judge Him with our limited brain?

37:20.200 --> 37:23.480
He can do whatever He likes and He is full of miracles.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.240
These intellectuals cannot understand Him.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.040
For example, Paul, he was an intellectual,

37:29.080 --> 37:32.120
he was no way a free man, he was not a realized soul

37:32.280 --> 37:35.080
and how can he understand Christ, he cannot.

37:35.120 --> 37:38.080
Because he was just an organizer and intellectual.

37:38.320 --> 37:42.000
You have to be a realized soul and you’ll be surprised Khalil Gibran

37:42.080 --> 37:46.080
has clearly written about Paul if you read him because Khalil Gibran

37:46.080 --> 37:49.280
was a realized soul that, “I can’t understand this strange man

37:49.400 --> 37:53.080
and he’s not a free soul,” and how is he in Bible?

37:53.160 --> 37:57.040
When I first saw the Bible I was surprised. I said, “How is he here?

37:57.200 --> 38:01.080
Who is he? I have never known him.” That’s what it is

38:01.200 --> 38:04.240
but we get enamored by his organizing capacity,

38:04.240 --> 38:08.400
the way he’s organized everything. You cannot organize God, can you?

38:09.280 --> 38:13.040
How can you organize God? Nobody should feel shattered because

38:13.160 --> 38:17.120
they are saying they were not miracles and they were allegories.

38:17.200 --> 38:22.320
You will meet so many miracles as soon as you will become the Spirit.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.320
God is full of miracles.

38:24.400 --> 38:28.120
Every miracle that is described of Christ is true.

38:28.440 --> 38:34.000
It was an immaculate conception. And we have His previous life,

38:34.080 --> 38:37.280
we know how He was created on this earth through complete

38:37.320 --> 38:42.080
immaculate conception by a virgin and everything we know about it

38:42.080 --> 38:46.240
in India and Indians are shocked how could you accept such a nonsense

38:46.320 --> 38:50.200
from people who are just intellectuals, they’re not realized souls.

38:50.360 --> 38:55.240
Thank God in India even today people know what is a realized soul is.

38:55.440 --> 38:59.200
Even the president, he would not sit down when I went to see him.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.080
He would not sit down, I said, “Sir, I’m your citizen,” he said,

39:02.160 --> 39:05.080
“No, Mother you’re a saint.” And he sat on the ground,

39:05.080 --> 39:08.320
he wouldn’t sit with Me on the same couch which he was having.

39:09.080 --> 39:13.080
That’s what it is. Our sensitivity in the West is gone down

39:13.080 --> 39:17.080
because of intellectualism. Even the science is a barrier,

39:17.160 --> 39:20.400
all these things are barriers, you see, and this barrier we must

39:21.080 --> 39:23.320
understand we have to become the same innocent person

39:23.400 --> 39:27.240
as Christ has said that you have to become children

39:27.240 --> 39:30.480
to enter into the kingdom of God. And this happens to you

39:31.080 --> 39:33.320
as soon as the Kundalini rises you become innocent,

39:33.480 --> 39:37.080
you become an innocent person. Innocent doesn’t mean a fool,

39:37.120 --> 39:41.520
innocent is the most intelligent, is the most powerful person.

39:42.240 --> 39:46.440
And a person who is a realized soul is also not a compromising person,

39:46.480 --> 39:49.240
“All right, if the churches are not working

39:49.240 --> 39:51.120
let us have a discotheque here.”

39:51.280 --> 39:54.120
That’s not possible, how can you have discotheque?

39:55.200 --> 39:57.320
Like in India in the temples they are selling all these drugs,

39:57.320 --> 40:01.320
can you imagine? Everywhere in all the religions they’re doing this

40:01.400 --> 40:05.520
compromising with the truth. Because they have no power;

40:06.080 --> 40:09.240
if you have the spiritual power you’ll not compromise with anyone.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.320
See the life of Christ.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.560
He took one hunter and started hitting all the people who were

40:15.040 --> 40:18.080
sitting outside and selling things outside the temple.

40:18.280 --> 40:21.560
It was He who stood against the people who were trying

40:22.000 --> 40:27.320
to throw stones at a prostitute and challenging because He knew

40:27.400 --> 40:31.480
that everybody was sinful and nobody had right to judge others.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.320
It was His power that made Him stand against all of them.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.160
I would say anyone of these who talk against Christ like this

40:39.280 --> 40:42.440
should stand up and say it. Have they got courage?

40:42.520 --> 40:46.400
They have no courage and that’s why I say they are not free people,

40:46.520 --> 40:48.000
they’re bound.

40:48.080 --> 40:51.080
If you want to attract people this is not the way to attract,

40:51.120 --> 40:54.280
through unreal thinking and mental projection.

40:54.400 --> 40:58.280
But by giving them their realization, their property, what they have.

40:58.440 --> 41:02.320
They don’t want to accept it because they think they’ll be challenged.

41:02.480 --> 41:06.320
They all can get realization themselves but they will not come forward.

41:06.400 --> 41:10.320
So don’t believe when they say that there were no miracles of Christ.

41:10.480 --> 41:14.280
Without miracles how are we created; ourselves we are miraculous.

41:14.360 --> 41:19.280
Think of ourselves; we are made like a computer which doesn’t think,

41:19.320 --> 41:22.080
it doesn’t need any programming. When you are seeing Me,

41:22.080 --> 41:25.320
you are seeing Me, you don’t have to think about it, isn’t it?

41:27.120 --> 41:31.280
What a great computer we are made. Can they make even a flower?

41:31.400 --> 41:35.560
What are they talking of intellectualizing and the miracles of miracles

41:36.080 --> 41:40.360
that are so many, how we are channelized, how we are born,

41:40.480 --> 41:46.080
how out of thousands of genes, one gene is used for the eyes,

41:46.200 --> 41:49.320
one for the nose, how they develop into a particular thing.

41:49.360 --> 41:51.560
Just look at the miracle of the whole universe,

41:52.080 --> 41:56.040
we don’t want to see that because we are becoming egoistical about it.

41:56.240 --> 42:00.320
We think that we can manage God, we can organize Him,

42:00.400 --> 42:05.280
we can do whatever we like. In the same realm, when we start seeing

42:05.360 --> 42:09.000
the horrible people coming from India and looting you,

42:09.080 --> 42:12.480
we succumb to them because they pamper your ego. They say,

42:12.520 --> 42:16.440
“All right, you can pay for me” “Oh, we can buy him, he’s for sale.”

42:16.520 --> 42:20.240
And now, I was surprised among the elite societies, it’s very funny

42:20.320 --> 42:26.160
but it’s true, they discuss, “I think this guru is three pounds less,”

42:27.000 --> 42:30.400
or, “That guru you can say five pounds,” it’s a big discussion on.

42:30.480 --> 42:32.480
It’s a guru-shopping going on, you see.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.240
I’ve been talking against them for the last twelve years

42:36.280 --> 42:39.240
openly taking their names and blasting them.

42:39.280 --> 42:44.040
About this Scientology, I told them in Brighton two years back

42:44.360 --> 42:46.480
and now they’ve found out about this Scientology.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.440
So the Brighton radio was very kind to Me and they called Me.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.360
I said, “When I told you, you were the ones who blasted Me,

42:53.440 --> 42:56.160
then why should you say this against Scientology?”

42:56.320 --> 42:59.560
Anybody who takes money from you in the name of God,

43:00.040 --> 43:04.400
know that he is a devil. No one should take any money

43:04.440 --> 43:07.280
in the name of God. All right you have to have the hall,

43:07.320 --> 43:11.440
you pay for the hall not for God. If your climate was all right,

43:11.480 --> 43:15.040
we could have done it outside but paying for the hall

43:15.080 --> 43:19.320
is different from paying for God. And the way these people have

43:19.360 --> 43:22.480
minted money is your naiveness, your stupidity, I should say

43:23.040 --> 43:26.080
that you didn’t understand this simple thing that these people are

43:26.160 --> 43:31.480
buying lots of aero planes and Rolls-Royces and you’re paying for it.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.440
Still I must say, English are wiser than many others.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.160
Like in America, I went and they told Me,

43:37.200 --> 43:39.080
“How many Rolls-Royces she has?”

43:39.160 --> 43:40.440
They said, “She has no Rolls Royce,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.480
She doesn’t take any money,” so they said, “We are not interested.”

43:44.120 --> 43:47.080
It’s a pop show going on, you see, how much money you make

43:47.120 --> 43:48.280
in this guru business.

43:48.400 --> 43:51.360
If somebody is a smart one, if he has made a big money,

43:51.400 --> 43:53.480
“Oh, he’s a smart fellow, he’s made so much money.”

43:54.080 --> 43:56.480
Can you imagine how money-oriented they are?

43:56.480 --> 44:01.000
You’re not, you are much better. So keep to your styles and I’m sure

44:01.080 --> 44:05.040
British will one day teach all of them a proper thing which is

44:05.080 --> 44:07.560
called is the proper balanced spiritual life.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.080
Somehow in this lifetime I have learned English language,

44:11.080 --> 44:15.280
I’m not so good but I can speak English and you should not mind

44:15.320 --> 44:18.480
if I have made any mistakes in English language. But one thing

44:18.480 --> 44:22.480
is there that English is much better than many other foreign languages

44:23.040 --> 44:26.080
because I find there is no word for awareness in French,

44:26.160 --> 44:29.280
how to translate awareness. There’s no word for conscience,

44:29.320 --> 44:32.440
there’s no word for consciousness, there’s only one ‘conscia’,

44:33.000 --> 44:35.520
whatever you call it. Of course English also has little problems.

44:36.080 --> 44:39.320
Like for spirit, you call the spirit that is dead the spirit,

44:39.400 --> 44:45.560
then you call the spirit that you get in the pubs also the spirit

44:48.160 --> 44:52.080
and also you call the spirit, that’s the pure thing within yourself,

44:52.120 --> 44:56.240
the reflection of God as spirit, and also the Holy Ghost as the Spirit.

44:56.400 --> 45:02.240
But in Sanskrit language, because it deals more, more with the roots

45:02.240 --> 45:05.120
it has more words for all these things.

45:05.240 --> 45:10.040
But it may not have so many words for the use of the, say,

45:10.080 --> 45:14.280
a glass and the tumbler for this kind of a wine and that,

45:14.320 --> 45:17.280
that it may not have anything about it, it’s a general thing,

45:17.320 --> 45:22.320
what we call as one word for the whole. All pubs are one word

45:22.400 --> 45:27.240
and all alcohols and everything is one word.

45:27.280 --> 45:30.560
There’s no differentiation at all because they do not know this area

45:31.080 --> 45:33.480
but the area they know, for that, they have different words.

45:33.520 --> 45:37.240
And that’s why sometimes one has to take to Sanskrit language

45:37.280 --> 45:41.240
in a way to understand. But you need not worry because we can do it

45:41.280 --> 45:45.120
in English language also very well now, it’s very simple.

45:45.320 --> 45:50.080
Now the happening takes place and then you become empowered

45:50.160 --> 45:53.480
and then you should only learn to maneuver it.

45:54.080 --> 45:57.080
So the yoga has two meanings, the first one means

45:57.080 --> 45:58.400
the union with the Divine,

45:58.480 --> 46:02.240
it is ‘sahaja’ meaning spontaneous because in the modern times

46:02.280 --> 46:06.480
there are all kinds of yogas. So it is a spontaneous, living yoga

46:07.000 --> 46:10.320
and that’s the only one is the real yoga, the rest is all

46:10.440 --> 46:14.520
something like an exercise. And the second part of the yoga means

46:15.080 --> 46:19.240
that the deftness to know the art of handling this power.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.280
That’s why they said when they got their realization or

46:22.320 --> 46:25.480
when they got the blessings of the Holy Spirit they started moving

46:25.480 --> 46:29.240
their hands in such a way that people thought that they were mad,

46:29.360 --> 46:32.280
but the whole of Namaz itself is awakening of the Kundalini,

46:32.400 --> 46:36.080
the whole of Namaz is. And the way we move our hands, you see,

46:36.080 --> 46:39.320
the power moves through our hands. So the movement of our hands

46:39.440 --> 46:43.400
gives us the empowering and we know how to handle this power

46:43.400 --> 46:46.480
within ourselves so you become your own guru.

46:47.120 --> 46:50.560
Now as I’m here for the first time I would like you to ask Me questions

46:51.080 --> 46:56.040
about Sahaja Yoga, about anything but still I would say you need not

46:56.080 --> 46:59.280
be aggressive with Me because it’s not good and don’t waste the energy

46:59.320 --> 47:02.480
of other people because there are many people who are seekers here

47:02.480 --> 47:05.480
I can see very clearly writ large on their faces,

47:06.000 --> 47:09.240
they’re real seekers of ages and let them have their seeking.

47:09.320 --> 47:13.480
Now if you have any such questions which you want to ask

47:14.080 --> 47:16.480
you can ask Me because in a short lecture like this,

47:16.480 --> 47:20.360
in one visit what could I do, how much could I tell you?

47:20.480 --> 47:24.280
I must have given at least two thousand lectures in English language

47:24.400 --> 47:27.320
and they are all on the tapes and later on you can get them

47:27.360 --> 47:30.080
and listen to them, the nature of the Spirit,

47:30.160 --> 47:32.200
what it means to be realized,

47:32.280 --> 47:40.000
how we become the citizens of God’s kingdom, what is God’s kingdom

47:40.000 --> 47:44.080
within us, where are these chakras placed, everything I’ve told

47:44.200 --> 47:47.400
and everything is to be told to you. There are some books also

47:47.440 --> 47:49.600
we have written but we don’t give books in the beginning

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
because again, you see, the brain starts thinking about it.

47:53.080 --> 47:56.600
You have to be in thoughtless awareness, so there only you grow.

47:56.600 --> 48:00.360
So we don’t want you to give some food for thought all the time

48:00.400 --> 48:03.640
so that you are all on a thinking level but you should grow

48:04.080 --> 48:06.280
and that’s why one has to understand

48:06.320 --> 48:08.320
that this lecture is not sufficient enough

48:08.480 --> 48:10.640
but is just an introduction to Sahaja Yoga.

48:11.080 --> 48:14.200
It was suddenly decided that I have to come here to Middlesbrough

48:14.320 --> 48:17.680
and this gentleman rang Me up and I found him very positive.

48:18.080 --> 48:22.320
It was very great, you see, and I think people are little in a puzzle

48:22.360 --> 48:25.400
these days because the way everything is attacked.

48:25.680 --> 48:33.240
And I think in a way it’s good because that will give them a curiosity

48:33.280 --> 48:36.120
to ascend. May God bless you all.

48:39.200 --> 48:42.600
I would like to have some questions from you.

48:44.400 --> 48:53.160
(Warren: Any questions? Very soon Shri Mataji will give you the experience

48:53.400 --> 48:56.080
and you can begin to feel what She’s speaking of.)

48:56.320 --> 49:00.120
I shouldn’t say I will give you because you’ll get it.

49:00.680 --> 49:03.080
It’s like the sun shining saying, “I’m shining,”

49:03.200 --> 49:06.000
I mean it has to shine jolly well, that’s its nature,

49:06.120 --> 49:10.040
and we have to get the sunshine, jolly well.

49:11.320 --> 49:13.520
It just works spontaneously.

49:24.360 --> 49:26.440
(Question: You gave this yoga a particular name,

49:26.480 --> 49:29.240
how many types of yoga do you have?)

49:31.080 --> 49:34.320
I don’t know, as many brains there are in this world,

49:34.320 --> 49:36.680
but there’s only one yoga, is Sahaja.

49:37.200 --> 49:40.360
If you read the Patanjali Yoga from which this so-called yoga has come,

49:40.440 --> 49:44.480
has got ahstangas eight folds, out of which a wee bit

49:44.600 --> 49:48.480
is called as yamanyama, in that a wee bit is the exercises.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.360
But these exercises are of no use without the Kundalini awakening.

49:52.400 --> 49:56.080
It’s written very clearly but nobody reads that big book, you see.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.560
Somebody has read only the beginning of it

49:58.680 --> 50:01.080
and has started calling it yoga.

50:01.320 --> 50:05.400
Now you have to make the Kundalini start

50:05.520 --> 50:07.480
and then you know where the problem is,

50:07.640 --> 50:10.160
for example, you have a problem in the stomach

50:10.360 --> 50:13.600
and if you are doing the exercise of the neck what’s the use.

50:14.400 --> 50:17.280
But the way people do sometimes it frightens Me;

50:17.400 --> 50:20.000
they want to take out the whole of their intestines outside,

50:20.040 --> 50:23.520
the way they are at it, it’s too much. There’s no need to do all that

50:23.680 --> 50:26.480
because that will really give you a heart attack or something like that.

50:26.480 --> 50:29.200
It gives Me a terrible fright;

50:31.080 --> 50:36.240
yoga doesn’t mean exercise by any chance, it means giving relief

50:36.320 --> 50:40.080
to a particular center which is obstructed, and how to do it,

50:40.080 --> 50:44.400
we also do exercises whenever it is needed to a particular thing

50:44.400 --> 50:49.320
but it’s very simple one, once in a while. It’s not like madness all the time,

50:49.320 --> 50:51.200
even people who do yoga I’ve seen,

50:51.280 --> 50:53.480
they cannot sit for one minute straight, you see.

50:53.600 --> 50:58.040
They just go into all these tantrums, it’s very difficult to understand.

50:58.240 --> 51:01.600
You become very normal, decent people.

51:03.560 --> 51:06.360
So the other yogas I don't know what they are all like,

51:06.480 --> 51:09.240
Kundalini yoga you can call it, is the Kundalini yoga

51:09.280 --> 51:11.560
if you want elaborately say it, Kundalini Yoga,

51:11.640 --> 51:15.480
it's Sahaja Yoga or you can call it Yoga itself.

51:17.680 --> 51:20.240
But I have called it Sahaja is not the point

51:20.360 --> 51:22.400
is a word very ancient Sahaja Saha-ja,

51:22.440 --> 51:27.080
'Saha' means with, 'ja' means born, it's born with you

51:28.600 --> 51:32.280
Like every seed can become a tree, it is born with you,

51:32.400 --> 51:36.440
you all can become that tree of life.

51:40.400 --> 51:43.560
I could have said yoga, but it means nothing

51:45.200 --> 51:48.280
I have seen people who were taking some drugs and

51:48.360 --> 51:51.440
I said, "What are you doing?" They said, "We are doing drug yoga."

51:52.560 --> 51:55.400
Everything is a yoga these days, you don't know.

51:55.600 --> 51:59.120
Coca-Cola yoga, all kinds of yoga.

52:02.600 --> 52:06.280
Yes, I tell you it is. Human beings are really ingenious,

52:06.280 --> 52:10.560
the way they manage everything. They know how to mess up everything.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.560
(Question: There are many interpretations of the Bible,

52:27.080 --> 52:30.400
how do you know that your interpretation is the correct one?)

52:30.600 --> 52:32.600
Because it can be proved,

52:33.320 --> 52:36.280
it can be proved - you see the interpretations that

52:36.280 --> 52:39.600
come out of brains will be many -

52:40.240 --> 52:44.640
because it can be proved, you see now for example I say Christ resides

52:45.280 --> 52:47.640
on a center called as Agnya chakra

52:47.800 --> 52:50.440
which is placed on the optic chiasma

52:51.000 --> 52:54.240
which is controlling your pituitary and the pineal body,

52:54.320 --> 52:58.320
supposing I say that, all right? Now you keep your mind open about it.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.040
Now when I raise the Kundalini

53:01.760 --> 53:04.320
I find that it is stuck here.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.440
This is the window; this is the window of Christ.

53:07.760 --> 53:13.200
This is the blood of Christ, symbolic of His blood which protects you.

53:13.600 --> 53:15.680
Now this is the window of Christ.

53:16.080 --> 53:18.480
Now when I say that, this interpretation,

53:18.640 --> 53:23.000
that when the Kundalini is rising, it stops there.

53:23.200 --> 53:26.440
I have to take His name, request Him

53:26.800 --> 53:29.560
or I have to say Lord's Prayer.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.600
That's the mantra, that's the chanting one has to do, then it rises.

53:35.080 --> 53:40.320
He sucks in your ego and superego and you can see it clearly

53:40.400 --> 53:45.520
happening that here on the fontanel bone area, you get a soft bone

53:46.000 --> 53:48.480
and you see the cool breeze coming out of it.

53:48.720 --> 53:54.320
Now, you ask a question, putting your hands like this,

53:54.440 --> 53:58.560
ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

54:00.760 --> 54:03.640
The vibrations start flowing much more.

54:04.040 --> 54:08.440
Supposing you ask about somebody who is not a good man

54:08.600 --> 54:11.200
the burning may start coming on your fingers.

54:11.560 --> 54:14.400
Now supposing you say there is no God,

54:14.560 --> 54:17.080
you may get a terrible burning on your hands.

54:17.320 --> 54:21.400
So relatively you understand that whenever you ask for something

54:21.600 --> 54:24.480
truthful you get lot of vibrations.

54:25.480 --> 54:29.160
That means your computer has started working

54:29.360 --> 54:34.720
but for anything you find out whether it is true or not

54:35.000 --> 54:37.400
you have to work it out and see for yourself.

54:37.520 --> 54:42.200
Now when it happens with this if you get cured automatically,

54:42.720 --> 54:47.440
if you become a joyous personality, if you get completely transformed

54:47.680 --> 54:51.440
and you start curing others and you know all about it,

54:51.720 --> 54:53.720
you become knowledgeable about it. It’s not that

54:53.760 --> 54:57.280
you start shaking before someone and then the person gets…,

54:57.320 --> 55:02.080
you are quite normal and not only that you cure

55:02.200 --> 55:05.360
but you make another person so peaceful and joyful

55:05.560 --> 55:10.440
and enlighten that person that that person can himself give realization.

55:10.720 --> 55:13.720
You can see the Kundalini, the one that is in the triangular bone

55:13.800 --> 55:16.800
just like a heart pulsating in some people, not all,

55:17.080 --> 55:19.680
if there’s an obstruction in the higher chakra

55:19.760 --> 55:24.360
then you see it actually like that. We have got pictures of that.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.600
So whatever interpretation you give mentally is not true,

55:28.760 --> 55:34.760
you must prove it. So you have to accept it as a hypothesis.

55:35.480 --> 55:39.040
As in any science you give a hypothesis first

55:39.160 --> 55:40.520
and then try to prove it.

55:40.680 --> 55:44.480
If you have proved it then you have to accept it as a law

55:44.520 --> 55:49.080
otherwise you are dishonest. If you’re honest,

55:49.200 --> 55:52.120
really if you’re honest you have to accept it, isn’t it?

55:52.640 --> 55:55.000
That’s what My husband told Me that, “I cannot be anymore

55:55.080 --> 55:59.360
dishonest about it, I have to accept it, that’s the truth.”

56:02.200 --> 56:04.720
All right, now what’s the other question?

56:10.240 --> 56:13.760
(Warren: She’s heard and read that if you awaken Kundalini

56:14.040 --> 56:15.480
before it’s ready it can be dangerous.)

56:15.600 --> 56:19.560
Yes, must be, because the people who raise have no authority to do it;

56:20.240 --> 56:22.800
they don’t know how to do it. A person who is not a doctor

56:22.800 --> 56:25.720
if he tries to operate, what will happen? It’s dangerous.

56:26.200 --> 56:29.440
So far so many people their Kundalini has been awakened.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.080
I haven’t seen any dangerous things happen to anyone,

56:32.200 --> 56:34.280
on the contrary everybody has gained by it.

56:34.640 --> 56:36.480
The reason is you should know how to do it, you should be

56:36.520 --> 56:43.320
an authority to do it. Supposing you put one seed in the steel box,

56:43.720 --> 56:47.080
will it grow? No, you have to put it in the Mother Earth,

56:47.240 --> 56:51.080
she has the capacity to do it. In the same way the one who knows

56:51.200 --> 56:55.360
can do it, has to be an authority on it, and it is your Mother,

56:55.480 --> 56:59.000
She is your Mother. Everyone has an individual mother

56:59.040 --> 57:03.400
waiting to give that self-realization, how can She be unkind to you?

57:04.040 --> 57:07.680
Of course, in the beginning little heat is thrown out of your body

57:07.720 --> 57:10.480
because you’re heated up. It’s all right, doesn’t matter,

57:10.640 --> 57:14.560
it’s not so much and sometimes you do feel little shaking

57:14.720 --> 57:17.120
if you have been to a wrong type of a guru or something

57:17.280 --> 57:19.040
or if you are suffering from nervous trouble

57:19.120 --> 57:20.800
there’s a little shaking that's all.

57:21.400 --> 57:23.560
I have not seen anything wrong happening

57:23.680 --> 57:26.480
but like one gentleman came and sat on the ground. I said,

57:26.480 --> 57:29.400
“Why are you sitting on the ground like that with your feet towards me?”

57:29.560 --> 57:32.080
He said, “You know Mother, my Kundalini has been awakened

57:32.200 --> 57:36.280
and I’m jumping like a frog.” I said, “Why are you jumping like a frog?”

57:36.400 --> 57:39.280
He said, “My guru has said it and he wrote it down on a book

57:39.400 --> 57:43.000
that you jump like a frog.” I said, “Now are you going to become a frog

57:43.080 --> 57:50.040
or an earthworm?” Use your brains, all right?

57:50.760 --> 57:53.200
Nothing to be afraid of.

57:53.680 --> 57:56.480
I don’t think I look that frightful, do I?

57:59.760 --> 58:02.320
(Warren: If there are no more questions we’ll have the experience.)

58:02.680 --> 58:05.520
No, one more, yes let’s have it.

58:06.720 --> 58:09.160
Yes, please!

58:29.440 --> 58:31.000
It's a very long question.

59:11.600 --> 59:16.120
(Warren: First of all, she says that she agrees with everything

59:16.200 --> 59:19.160
that You’ve said, but she’s concerned about one thing,

59:19.320 --> 59:26.480
as she herself is a spiritualist medium, she is aware of the dangers

59:27.040 --> 59:31.120
and she wonders whether You are able to distinguish

59:31.160 --> 59:33.280
between the dangers and the blessings.)

59:33.520 --> 59:38.760
Absolutely, that’s what it is, that you should know what are the dangers.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.480
I’ve already told you, moving to the left and the right

59:41.640 --> 59:43.760
and the spiritualists are moving to the left.

59:44.080 --> 59:47.200
They’re using spirits and it’s very dangerous. You don’t know how

59:47.280 --> 59:51.320
to protect yourself, unless and until you get your realization

59:51.480 --> 59:54.320
you will not even know how spiritualism is wrong;

59:54.440 --> 59:56.800
absolutely it is most dangerous.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.440
There is no danger in Kundalini, but in spiritualism

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.080
it’s most dangerous, whether you may be all right for the short time

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.760
but they are spirits, you must know

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.360
and spirits are the most dangerous things. Don’t go near them.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.480
It’s very surprising that in the West,

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.480
people have no idea about spirits

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.080
and the way they go headlong into it, it sometimes really upsets Me.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.400
In India people know about it, they call it Bhootavidya, Pretavidya,

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:30.600
Smashanavidya, means the knowledge about the dead, we can say,

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.720
in small the dead knowledge and they just don’t want to go near it.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.240
Say, the other day we had a visitor and I took her to a church

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.720
and she was holding her sari, going like this. I said,

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.720
“What’s the problem?” She said, “All dead are here,

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:48.600
how can we cross over them?” She couldn’t understand

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.080
and we have them in the churches where children go.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.160
It’s very dangerous. Only the realized people in India are buried,

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.000
only realized souls are buried, not the people who are not realized.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.440
They’re not to be buried; they’re to be burned so that their body

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.240
gets purified and again they come on this earth for their realization.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.360
And the dead in the church! It’s so dangerous,

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.680
playing with spiritualists, nobody will do.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.200
Here I find housewives, and all people responsible

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.760
getting into this mess of spiritualism.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.000
It’s all absolutely against Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.680
We have nothing to do with them. On the contrary they suffer a lot.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.160
Spiritualists suffer a lot later on in life.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.280
Not only but seven generations of their family can suffer.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.080
We had a doctor here who came and I was surprised that

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.040
he being a doctor was suffering from this kind of a disease.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.680
He was a Russian doctor and I asked him, “How did you get into it?”

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.160
So he told me his mother, his grandmother had a hobby to take him

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.480
to the cemetery. From his childhood he used to go to the cemetery.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.800
We could not locate the problem anywhere, he was very depressed

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.320
and he used to get into problems and he had to give up his jobs.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.360
Now then we met another Indian doctor who was here

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.120
and he had the same type of trouble, he’d given up his job and

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.200
his wife didn’t know what to do and his children were also suffering.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.720
So I asked him a question, “Why, why you are like this?

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.640
What did you do with your studies?” And he was quite normal.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.640
He said, “I led a very normal life.” But his grandfather used to do

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.680
black magic, in the sense we call it, all this is black magic.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.200
All spiritualism is black magic, because it has to deal with the dead.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.280
And this boy was suffering, his children were suffering.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.080
Now we have one person from Guyana,

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.360
another one from Guyana,

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.400
he too, his father used to do this kind of a thing and he is suffering,

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.680
he’s still suffering. He’s come to Sahaja Yoga and he’s still…

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.120
but he can see now and he knows how to protect.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.480
So those who deal with dead are going to suffer, take it from me,

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.720
whatever you may do, because they’re just like human beings

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.720
and sometimes slyer people than we are.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.040
We should have nothing to do with the dead.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.600
Let them take their birth again, let them take their realization.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.600
All anorexia, all these diseases come out of that.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.120
So many diseases I’ve told you, cancer is caused by the dead.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.200
Be careful on that point and I don’t understand

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.200
all educated people here, so much developed,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.600
how can you take…, Indians won’t take to it.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.760
They won’t go near it; they understand.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.200
Tantrikas and all that are prevalent only in very poor countries

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.240
like… say, it’s a vicious circle, it brings poverty also. As soon as

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.800
there is a dead in a family or a dead work done, the money disappears.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.440
The reason is the goddess of Lakshmi as we call them,

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.000
she just disappears, she doesn’t like that black thing at all.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.800
And so the countries where we have, I mean, in our country

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.080
the provinces which are poor, the whole country is not poor,

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.480
they’re doing all black magic. In Kerala, it’s very poor country,

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.720
I went there, they bury their dead in the house.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.720
It is all that. You must keep them out,

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:20.800
because the goddess of wealth doesn’t like it.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.080
All this knowledge was not known to you but that doesn’t mean

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.560
that you should go headlong into these things, it’s very, very dangerous.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.760
Never go near the dead; whatever it is the planet said,

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.520
this, that, it’s all nonsensical.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.360
There’s no need to do that. But people are really…,

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.080
I don’t understand, they’re daredevils.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.400
Like from America three big scientists came to see me,

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.160
in India I’m very well-known. So they came to see me and said that,

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.280
“Mother, teach us how to fly in the air.” I said,

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.320
“Why do you want to fly in the air? What is the need?”

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.400
“No, we want to leave our body and go to the moon.” I said,

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.200
“You are already doing it with your body, why do you want to do it?”

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:06.720
So they told me that, “Parapsychology is practiced now in Russia

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.520
and we want to do the same.” I said, “It will affect them.”

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:15.360
You see the way their presidents are killed, this is all parapsychology.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.080
I told them, “Don’t go near them.” They said, “No Mother,

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.600
we want to do it.” I said, “But then you will be slaves of these dead,

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.760
would you like to do that?” Still they said, “Yes we want to do it.”

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.280
I said, “I have nothing to do but who has told you about this?”

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.520
They said, “There is one fellow, Patanjali, who is a reporter.”

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.600
I said, “Look at this Patanjali, he was suffering from this trouble,

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.560
that his body used to be left behind and he would fly out and do…”

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.680
And he came and his wife came and begged of me that

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.440
they should be rid of this trouble and he’s telling them that

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.200
am I going to put the trouble into them?

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.000
All this parapsychology business, when I went first to America

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.760
I must tell you, this experience is very good.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.480
I told them against parapsychology openly because they,

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.560
I didn’t know what they were doing in parapsychology, first of all,

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.760
and they are the people who invited me in their hall. I blasted them

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.720
and I said, “Don’t do all this nonsense, it will all destroy you,

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.520
just don’t go near them.”

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.360
Second time when I went to America, only last year,

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.520
I was giving on the television, I was on the television

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.800
and before the television they had told that Mataji Nirmala Devi

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:32.240
is going to come. And somebody telephoned from San Diego saying that,

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.600
“Mother had come last time and she told us about parapsychology

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.360
and she told us about the gurus, she warned us but we never listened

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.480
to her and now we are destroyed people. Can she save us?” I said,

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:49.280
“Yes, but still it’s difficult now, you should not have gone to that.”

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.800
And the whole of that parapsychology thing is finished now.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.160
The building caught fire, the gentleman went to Australia,

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:04.720
he got a funny temperament, he ended up in a lunatic asylum.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.320
The wife, she became paralytic, she ended up in a lunatic asylum.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:16.000
Brezhnev and all these people, they all suffered from this.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.520
You can see their faces, all like this, possessed.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.080
Don’t go near the spiritualists;

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.680
don’t do that, it’s very dangerous, for you,

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.480
for the progeny, for everyone. I must warn you;

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.480
it’s the most dangerous thing and should not do that.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.120
Even if you don’t like it, I have to tell you.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.080
I don’t want to tell you something that’s not true.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.200
You depend on yourself, on your own Spirit, on your own being.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.040
Why to depend on somebody who’s dead, let them be alone.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.400
But when they suffer, they come to me, I’ve seen it,

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.120
when they suffer then they come.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.400
Then it’s so difficult, you see, afterwards to give them

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.160
realization, it’s so difficult, they’ve already harmed themselves.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:13.720
He (Warren) also had gone to someone like that, but his wife we lost

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.600
because she was going too much of it; we’ve lost her, she’s…,

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:22.080
I don’t know, she may come back, but I mean, she’s very much attacked,

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.080
very much attacked. And she used to become like a furious personality

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.400
and all sorts of things used to happen to her and I hope she comes back

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.080
but it’s very difficult, you know, to pull them back out of the clutches

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.480
of that, because they don’t know what they’re are doing,

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.320
what they’re talking, how they’re behaving.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:45.040
A sickness of the worst type. Even AIDS is a sickness from the same.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.720
Most of the terminal diseases come from them.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.040
It’s very dangerous, don’t go near them.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.480
Christ has already told you; he’s the one who told so plainly,

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.680
he took them out and put them in the pigs and pigs went into the sea.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.760
You have heard of that or not;

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.520
so why do you want to bring them back? Put them in the pigs.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.480
If they don’t want to reside in the area where they are supposed

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.920
to reside, let them go to pigs.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.360
They’ve no business… they’re busybodies, you know.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.720
There’re also one Dr. Lang in here. I must tell them about him,

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.880
this Dr. Lang, late Dr. Lang, dead. And he capsized a man

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.200
in Vietnam who was a soldier who was under a shock

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.400
and this soldier came down to London

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.720
to see his son and he said, “I’m Dr. Lang.”

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.840
The son was shocked, he said, “Who? How are you… my father is dead.”

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.240
He said, “No, your father has possessed me, and he has told me

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.840
that I must start my clinic here and there are many doctors

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.680
who want to help me and I’m going to start this clinic.”

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.440
So the son listened to it and he said, “How am I to believe

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.920
that you are my father?” Then he told him some secrets

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.320
which were between the two, and told about the house

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.840
where he had put some money and all that.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.280
And the son was surprised and he started the clinic;

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.800
and that’s how the International Curative Centre of Late Dr. Lang

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:19.320
started in London. How I came to know about it, that in 1974

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.520
I met a lady, she was shaking all the time like this.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.200
I said, “What’s this?”

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.000
She said, “Mother, I don’t know but I was cured by Dr. Lang,

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.760
late Dr. Lang.” Then she told me the story. But they were honest

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.160
to tell about this whole thing what had happened but he did not enter

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.760
into the body of the boy, his son, entered into somebody else

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.640
who was a very healthy man. And she told me that,

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.120
“When I wrote to them, I am suffering from these troubles,

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.880
stomach trouble, they told me that you will have the experience

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.040
at such and such exact this time.” That shows it’s not living

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.800
because you cannot give time to something that is living. You cannot

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.240
say exactly what time a flower is going to become the fruit, can you?

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.320
And this thing entered into her body, she started shaking, shaking,

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.520
and her stomach was all right.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.520
For about two years she was all right, afterwards the whole body

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.880
started shaking, she became like a mad woman.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.600
She used to run out of the house and people would say that,

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.240
“This woman is going to kill herself.” Once she jumped from

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.760
a very high ceiling just to kill herself but somehow she was saved,

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.160
and they brought her to Me and she told me the story of late Dr. Lang.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.480
So I have to tell you, though they cure you for a while,

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.240
don’t go near them, better you cure yourself and know all about it.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.800
You be the master of yourself.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.080
It’s nice she brought out the point because otherwise…

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.920
it’s all Sahaj, it’s spontaneous, so that I could tell you about it;

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.400
it’s quite possible that people could take to that.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.600
Now should we have the experience now, all of us?
