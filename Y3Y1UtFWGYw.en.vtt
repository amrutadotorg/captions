00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Public Program, Teesside Polytechnic, Middlesbrough (England), 31 July 1984.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.080
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.000
First of all, we have to know what truth means.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.000
We want to seek truth,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.240
there’s an urge within us that we have to seek the truth.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.240
Because of this seeking only we all have become human beings.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now after human beings' stage, what is going to happen to us?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.000
As it is, you find there is so much of confusion in this world,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.000
so much of confusion, so many ideas, so many thoughts,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so many ideologies, so many religions. All kinds of things

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
have come up and a simple human starts looking at it

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.000
and he gets quite puzzled,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
“What sort of thing this world is?”

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.000
It’s a very confused world, first of all.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.000
The confusion gives you a greater urge to seek,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.000
because you find, “What’s this going on?”

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.280
Secondly, I went round your city today

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.080
just to vibrate the whole place

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and I felt the place has got a kind of a feeling of dullness

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.160
and I asked the person who was driving Me,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.160
I said, “Why the people here are looking very dull?”

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
He said, “The people are now without any jobs,”

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so, I said that should happen to any country which is so industrially developed.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.000
When we are industrially developed, you see,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.080
all our industrial wants are over perhaps,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.280
then we start seeking more

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because we think now we’ve got everything,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we’ve got proper dress to wear, we’ve got food, we’ve got everything,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
now what next? And that’s how we become dull

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080
because we don’t understand the meaning of life.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now this meaning of life is more in the people who are affluent

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.080
and has to be less in the people who are still developing

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.000
because they want to become like you,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
have all plastics around them,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
they want to have foundries with all pollution, everything.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Once they have that then they will start seeking.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.080
But in a country like India

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.280
which has been a very different type of a country I say,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
because of climatic position. It’s very good climate,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
like this, it is always there, so you can be always out in the villages,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
you can be in the forest and you don’t have to worry so much

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to fight the nature. So in such a place people have been meditating

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and trying to find out, “Why are we here?”

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now all these things when you see the development everywhere,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.080
you find it’s like the tree, the tree outside you see very well developed.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.000
But any tree that has developed very much must have very deep roots,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
otherwise it will be all finished and destroyed.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.080
So when there is such a lot of development outside,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.000
there must have been some development inside also, the roots.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And this is what we are going to tell you about the roots now

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
because your development is sufficiently enough and if

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.080
you have to sustain this development you must know about your roots.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
We have neglected our roots very much

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and that’s the reason today we also find people suffering

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
from terminal diseases and all kinds of trouble.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
That is one of the first worry for Me

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.080
that everyone should be healthy

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.160
and that health comes to you not from outside, from inside.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.080
Because supposing if on a tree you find a leaf is sick

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.080
and you start treating the leaf, you don’t treat the tree.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.000
You don’t treat the disease at all.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.000
But if you have some means of entering into the roots, you treat

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.000
the whole of that tree very well, very easily in a very simple manner.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000
In the same way if you can somehow reach your roots,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.000
you can treat yourself without much difficulty, without any medicine also.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.000
Now where are these roots?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.000
Uh, for that you have to see to this chart,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.000
I don’t know if everybody can see this chart,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that within us this beautiful instrument is placed,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and this is what is described in the Bible as the tree of life.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.080
Unless and until you achieve a state which we call as self-realization,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.000
which Christ called as the second birth

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.080
we cannot understand what is this.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.000
Because now you are listening to Me very closely

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but if I say, “Pay attention to yourself within,” you cannot.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It’s a difficult thing, our attention is outside.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Now what should happen for that?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
There’s a happening that takes place,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.160
because of that happening your attention is attracted inside.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.240
And once the attention is inside,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.080
the same attention gets the enlightenment of this power

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.000
which is within you, us in the sacrum bone,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
sacrum meaning sacred, that means the Greeks knew about it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.080
When this power rises, awakens, it’s like the plumule in the seed,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.000
the germinating power of a seed

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and it just gives you a new dimension.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.080
It enriches your subtle centers.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
These subtle centers actually are the subtle entities of the gross plexuses.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.280
When they’re exhausted you suffer from diseases.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now for example, today’s article made Me think that I should tell you

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.000
how we get a particular disease called horrible cancer

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and that is so common in the West,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.000
not so much in the developing countries as it is here.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
They say cancer is a rich man’s disease.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.000
The thing is that within us there are two systems,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.000
of nervous systems which cater us.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
One of them is the one called as the central nervous system

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.000
another is the one which we call as autonomous nervous system.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.000
Now the doctors are honest, they just call it by name, autonomous.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now if you ask them, “Who is this auto,” they won’t be able to tell you.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Just they call it some name, autonomous.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.080
This auto is the Spirit in the heart

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and this auto if you somehow or other bring into your attention

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.280
the light of the auto comes into your attention,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.280
you start controlling your being completely.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This is a simple method I’m telling you.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.000
Now the nature of the roots is such

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that this autonomous nervous system has three channels.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.240
The two channels of the left and the right sympathetic nervous system

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and the central one is the parasympathetic. Now you can see here

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the three channels but these are the subtle channels

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:12.000
which control, which control the gross channels.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.080
Now these subtle channels work out in such a way

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.000
that the left-side channel caters to your past,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.000
caters to what has happened, caters to your conditioning

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.080
It is what we call is the channel of the moon,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
or this is the one that works out the power of desire within us.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The right-side channel is the channel which works out the action,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.240
so it is the channel of the action, caters to your future,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.160
to your mental activities and to your physical activities.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.240
It is called as the channel of the sun.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Now both of them are parallel to each other.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.080
Now when a human being tries to find out something,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.000
he tries always to go to the extremes, in anything.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Supposing he goes to the pub then he must drink the whole of it.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.240
If he goes to some other work, he must finish off his work with

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
completely dedication, as they call it and exhaust all his life doing that.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.160
Always we go to extremes, either to the left or to the right.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.160
Now if a person is a person of moderation, he stays in the center.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The central path is for our evolution.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.280
The whole of matter has evolved, as you know there’s a chart

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and in the chart if you find the periodic laws the nature are

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
so beautifully made and it is all very much balanced.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And in the center lies the carbon

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and the carbon is in the first center lies within us.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Now all these centers are nothing but the steps of our evolution.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.280
Like we were first carbon, then we became animals,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
then we became human beings and now we are seekers.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.280
That’s how we develop one after another and the evolution takes place

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and we become human beings.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.080
Now the question comes, what next?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.080
Why are we here?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
We are human beings but what are we to achieve next.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.160
If this question doesn’t come into your mind

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
then it will come later on, no doubt,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
but it’s better that the time is here for you to seek that;

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
why are we on this earth?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We are here on this earth, like this instrument if you make,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
you’ll ask, “Mother why are you making this instrument?”

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
This instrument is made to carry My voice.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
In the same way you, the human beings are made instruments of God.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.080
Now you are to be employed by God and He’s going to use you

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.000
and this power is going to flow through you.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Only thing is, you have to be connected to the mains

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and this connection takes place through the ascent of this Kundalini

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
which is actually the Holy Ghost in the Bible.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.000
In the Bible nothing has been written about Holy Ghost as such.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I asked a priest, “What do you mean by Holy Ghost?”

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So he tells Me, “I’m agnostic about it.”

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.000
So I said, “Then why are you there? What are you doing?”

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So he says, “I’m doing my job.”, you see.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.240
There’s no job in God’s realm,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
like that where you can get money without knowing what you are doing.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
You’re supposed to know what you are doing.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.000
You are supposed to know what Holy Ghost is

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and you are supposed to know where it is.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You just cannot get a job, become something

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.080
and profess something without knowing much about it.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And this is what is the dilemma of today’s religions,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
not one but all of them.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.080
They do not know that they have to be born again,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.000
first of all, to profess any religion.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.000
Christ has said so clearly that you are to be born again.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.080
And when Nicodemus asked Him, “What do you mean by born again?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.000
Have I to enter into my womb again?” He said, “No.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The flesh gives birth to flesh but I’m talking about the Holy Spirit.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
The Holy Spirit has to give birth to your Spirit.”

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And that’s what it is, the Holy Spirit within you

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
is this three and a half-coiled Kundalini or the Holy Spirit.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.160
Now through meditative processes because as I told you

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
the attention of Indians was more inward

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
so they tried to find out how we are made.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.000
And this is not the knowledge of today, it’s a very ancient knowledge.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
A book written about a person fourteen thousand years back

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.160
has described in all details all the things I’m telling you

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but we have never come to know about it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Neither we tried to look at it. Even about Christ there’s so much

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.000
written in those books thousands of years back

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
About Mohamad thousands of years back,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
we never try to translate those things

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
or bring this knowledge to that level that everybody could read it.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But now it is possible for you to understand

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.280
that you’re not only the body, mind, ego, superego,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.080
but you’re something much more.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.080
And that much more is the Spirit

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.000
and the truth is that you have to become the Spirit.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.080
Once you become the Spirit,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.000
means when you become the light

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.080
what you do exactly is to give the light.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But before that there are lots of hurdles,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.280
like as I told you there’s cancer, this, that, all kinds of diseases

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
that hurt human beings.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
There are mental diseases, there are emotional problems,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
there are all kinds of problems and they can only be solved

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.000
if you go to your roots.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.080
Now let us see a simple case of cancer,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.160
for Me, it is simple because it can be cured very simply.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Now for example, you take one of the centers,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.280
it’s like this within us, like this, you can see, all of you.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And this center is inside here.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
While this is the left and the right sympathetic nervous systems

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.160
and in the center, we can say is the parasympathetic

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.080
which supplies the balance,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
which supplies all the energy that is needed for the left and the right.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.000
When we go into any emergency, for example, if you start running

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
then the heart starts pulsating very fast

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
But it comes to normal through the central path of parasympathetic.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Now what happens that this center supposing

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
is used too much because of our extreme habits,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
you see, you use too much. Anyway, then what happens, that

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:52.000
starts breaking this chain and you lose your contact with the whole.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Then you become on your own, means you become malignant.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.160
The cells become malignant; they start eating other cells

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.000
without any relationship to the whole.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
You don’t know how far to go.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Supposing you develop a cancer of the nose,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.240
the nose cells start becoming bigger, they start eating other cells

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and whosoever they touch, like an egotistical man, like Hitler,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
whosoever they touch, that cell again becomes malignant

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.000
and then that starts eating and that’s how the whole body

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.080
becomes malignant. This is how cancer is set in, a simple thing.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.280
But recently, about a year back, I saw a very interesting

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
television show of the doctors. They said that

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
the vulnerability of cancer is present in every human being

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.280
because we live on extremes all the time,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
but the triggering takes place when some entity attacks you

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
from the area built in within you since your creation.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.280
And this area we call in Sahaja Yoga as the collective subconscious.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
That is whatever is dead within us resides in that area.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Now this is the area beyond the left sympathetic.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So those people who go too much to the left side,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.280
too much to the emotional side

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.240
or those who go and bow to wrong type of gurus,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.160
wrong type of people and accept wrong type of religions I should say

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
where you take to dead, to spiritualists, spiritual work and

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
all those things are very much vulnerable to diseases like cancer.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.000
Cancer is not the right-side disease

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
but heart attack could be a right side as well as a left side disease.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have two types of hearts, not one type.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.160
One is the over active, another is the lethargic heart.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.080
Now the people who are over active, you see, all the time running,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.000
looking at the watches and just on the run, you see,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
all such people have an over active heart

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
which is absolutely exhausted.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.080
And the attention is so much outside that the Spirit in the heart

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
is agitated and it recedes and you get a heart attack.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.000
Now there’s another type of a heart which is lethargic,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
which takes to emotional side, weeps all the time, sings about the past,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
“My father was so rich and I’m so poor,” all those things, you see,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
specially the ladies have that problem.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And then when they start talking too much about the left side

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
then what happens, the lethargic heart becomes a problem

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
because you develop symptoms like angina and all these things.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.080
So we have two types of hearts.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.280
Now you cannot treat a person who has two styles,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I mean, everybody cannot be treated the same way

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
because we have two types of heart troubles.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Now in the medical science which I have done Myself

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
is there’s only one type of human being.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.000
They do not separate one from another.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
But in everyday life you see we are so different from each other.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
So there are three types of people actually,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
one of them are the ones who are futuristic,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
another are the ones who live in the past

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.080
and the others who are in the center.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.000
And they have three types of combinations then,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
that permutations and combinations work out with these,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
mainly, we should say, nine types of people.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
But then there can be even greater permutations and combinations

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.160
depending on the kinds of people they meet, the kinds of people

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
they admire or live with, or dominated with or dominate.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So we have very complicated human beings in this world,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
doesn’t matter but they can brought down to the simple thing

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
as left, right and center.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.160
If you can bring them down and classify them to these three things

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
it’s very easy to treat them.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.000
Because if somebody is a right-sided person,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
he’ll have certain symptoms, he’ll be hot-tempered fellow,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
he’ll have a liver trouble. he’ll be thin,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
he’ll be shouting all the time on top of his voice.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
He may be good outside but in his family he would be very hot-tempered.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.000
He may be a person who is egoistical but maybe

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
that he’ll look very humble because he has to deal with people

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.000
and maybe that he may be very, very aggressive

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
to such a point that he might become sadistic.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Now the another type are the other ones who want always to run away,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
escape, they could be these, not people who will be grossly aggressive

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.000
but will be very sly and will be trying all tricks and playing games

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.080
and intrigues and all sorts of things

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.000
and also, they will be living with their past, this type of thing.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.000
Now there are people who are in the center,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
the people who are moderate, who take life pleasantly,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.080
not bothered so much about life, life’s complications

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.000
but keep above it. And they lead a very normal life,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
they do not indulge into any nonsensical things.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
These are the central type of people and that’s why

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
all the religions came on this earth to establish that balance within.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Religions, all of them came on this earth to establish that balance.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.080
Why the balance, again the question can come up, why the balance.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.000
The balance is for our ultimate ascent,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
for example, if you have to take an aero plane, ascend it,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
you have to first see if it is balanced or not,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
otherwise, it will be not floating horizontally

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
but it might go one-sided, you see so one has to have a balance in life.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
But if you read yourself, if you face yourself you will understand that,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
“No, we are not so much balanced as we should have been.”

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
So this balance has to be brought in, in human beings

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
and that’s why we had great prophets on this earth

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.000
to teach us the balance.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And these prophets came at a time where we needed this balance,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.000
at every time people became imbalanced, they came on this earth

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
to teach us balance.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
When this balance is lost, mostly we develop diseases.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Even in religious things we can be very imbalanced.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Like I’ve seen people reading Bible for three hours,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
what is the need to read Bible?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.000
I mean, for three hours you don’t learn anything.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Actually, if you understand religion, is not to be read,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
but to be felt and experienced within yourself.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Religion is like the ten valences of human beings.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And the ten valences of the human beings

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
when we lose the valence, we lose our balance.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.000
Now anything like, say a country

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
which is over-developed loses its balance.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.000
A country which is under-developed also can lose its balance.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.080
Anywhere it can happen the same way,

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.280
makes no difference whether you’re developed or under-developed,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
you are in the same way whether the balance is up or down,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
makes no difference. So it is like that.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Now with the Kundalini what happens,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
the first thing it does is to create the balance within.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
When She rises in that part of the thing, area of the stomach

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
it creates the balance, it brings forth the balance.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Once the balance has come then it’s much easier for you

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.160
to balance all the chakras which have gone upside down

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
or which are crooked and the balance comes and fix them together.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.080
With that balance the chakras get their forms all right

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.000
and because of that the Kundalini rises.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
She rises and pierces through your fontanelle bone area

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.160
which is the true baptism.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
It’s not like somebody coming putting water onto your head

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.160
and say, “Now you’re baptized.” And we accept it.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
It’s just an exercise, there’s no truth about it.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.000
The cool breeze of the Holy Ghost has to be felt on top of your head.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:01.000
So the truth has to be felt on your central nervous system,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.080
that means you must feel them on your fingertips.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Mohamad Sahib has clearly said that

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
at the time of Resurrection your hands will speak.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
But nobody wants to talk of Resurrection,

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.000
nobody wants to talk of something that is good to happen,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
that there will be a period where people will be redeemed,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
that there will be a Redeemer, there will be a Counsellor;

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
nobody wants to talk of that.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.080
They want to talk of the doomsday because people will be frightened

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.000
and they’ll be pouring money for them.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
It’s a money-making fright which is created in people.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.080
The God Almighty who has created this beautiful universe

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
has created you as special people who are human beings,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
do you think He’s going to allow us to destroy His great creation?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
He’s made us so beautifully within ourselves

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
and we have to just understand that you’re not what you seem to be,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.160
you’re much greater, you’re much more, you are glorified by Him.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.280
Because only this thing has to happen and once it happens

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
you’ll be surprised that you become in charge of yourself,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.160
that you become empowered with that power of God

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.240
which flows through you.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000
You can cure people, you can help people, you can raise Kundalini,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
you can get rid of all these stupid problems,

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.080
all these big problems and all the universal problems

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
because a transformation takes place within you.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.280
We had an alcoholic in Brighton one day,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
he came to the program completely drunk and he started abusing Me.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.000
I just smiled at him. Next day he came and he got his realization.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Today he’s a first-class man, he’s earning such a lot of money,

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.000
he’s doing so well.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
So what happens to you that you become yourself

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
and to become yourself means you become the Spirit,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
and Spirit is the reflection of God within yourself.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Once that happens, you become the dynamic power of God

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.080
and you’re surprised the miraculous way you’re helped.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.080
Now of course, Sahaja Yoga has definitely cured cancer, no doubt,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
it can cure so many diseases.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.280
But when we wrote to the British council about it

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.080
and they found out that we were curing people, they said,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
“There’s a big red tape going on,” they’ve to go through the files,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
they have to find out, this, that.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
So we said, “All right, doesn’t matter, let them have their own time.”

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
But Sahaja Yoga is not only for physical being

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.000
because you are not only physical being.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
I tell you there are many wrestlers and boxers

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.240
who come to Me and say, “Mother,” who are very, very sturdy people,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
they say, “Mother, we have no peace, give us peace.”

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.240
So it is not for physical being, it is not for mental being,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
it’s not for emotional being but it is for your spiritual being.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
But as you’re the temple of God, the temple has to be cleansed.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
When some guest is coming to your house, we clean the house,

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.000
make it beautiful, put flowers, decorate it.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.160
In the same way, when your Spirit is going to enter into your attention

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
your body has to be cleansed; your mind has to be purified

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.240
and that you have to become a beautiful temple for that enlightenment.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.280
And that’s how as a by-product of this Kundalini awakening you get cured.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.200
Now what happens to your awareness,

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.000
that you become collectively conscious.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.080
You become, again I say there’s no certificate.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.320
In Sahaja Yoga there’s no membership,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.080
of course you must have heard, there’s no money to be paid or anything.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.280
I mean, it is stupid, how can you pay money to God,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.160
what does He understand about money?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.080
How much money are you going to pay for yourself, first of all?

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.080
He has given beautiful eyes to us, what do we pay Him, nothing;

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.040
on the contrary we spoil them all the time

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.280
by looking at things with lust and greed, we spoil them.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.240
We have adultery in our eyes, so we spoil them, the beautiful

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.040
innocent eyes that He has given us, the pure eyes, we spoil them.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.280
But when you’re awakened, your eyes become so beautiful

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.160
that you look at the person, the person gets all right.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.080
Your presence, merely your presence can help so many.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.000
But you have to achieve that state.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.120
Now as he said, you cannot demand it, you see, there’s no shop here.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.280
In a shop you pay the money so you can demand,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.200
“All right, come along, this was bad and I paid so much money.”

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.280
But here what do you give? Your seeking, you’re seeking the higher being,

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.080
you are not seeking your cure but you’re seeking

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.040
the higher being within you.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.280
The property, the wealth of spirituality that resides in all of us.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.080
It is there, it is all there, only thing we have to pay attention to it and get it.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.280
Now you become collectively conscious means you start feeling

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.080
other people on your fingertips.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.200
Even a child can say, “This is the problem, this is the problem,”

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.080
now you have to just know what these denote

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.080
and that’s what I have decoded that this means heart,

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.080
this means something else, this means something else

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.080
and all the centers, the five and the sixth and the seventh centers,

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.000
on the left and the right-hand side.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.080
So immediately you’ll know the person’s suffering.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.040
But we don’t talk like doctors, we don’t say,

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.120
“This fellow is egoistical,” not like that.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.320
But we’ll say, “His Agnya chakra in the front is catching,”

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.240
that means he’s egoistical. But we don’t say that.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.080
Even a person will come and say, “Mother today my Agnya is catching,

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.280
just take it out,” meaning, “I’ve been egoistical.”

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.000
So the language is different as you must have read in the Bible

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.280
that when they got their realization through the Holy Ghost

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.040
they started speaking in strange languages.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.080
That doesn’t mean that they started speaking in Latin or Hebrew.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:51.080
It means that they started speaking in the languages of chakras,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.280
of centers, of the subtle centers.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.200
They started talking about the channels,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.280
because you become subtle, you start seeing something subtle.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.320
Like the way you see colors, animals do not see.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.080
The way you see filth and dirt the animals do not see.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.080
But when you become realized souls you see the dirt and filth of a

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.000
much subtler nature. That is the sin that they call it or anything like that.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.080
So you become separated from this,

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.160
and you start witnessing the whole world like a witness.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.120
You become collectively conscious, so supposing you get cured,

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.080
so-called by Me, so-called, I would say, then there’s no obligation

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.080
because if you’re part and parcel of Me, whom do I help?

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.080
If this finger is paining and I rub it like this, whom do I help,

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.080
I help Myself, isn’t it?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.320
So you become part and parcel of the whole

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.080
and when you become part and parcel of the whole,

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.160
the whole thing works out in such a homogenous way.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.200
As a result of that the people in England

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.080
who were suffering from many diseases, people in Australia,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.040
so many countries now we have,

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:01.200
most of the European countries we have tackled, have been cured.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.280
They have been cured of their diseases, of their ailments,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.240
they’ve become so powerful that they have no habits,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.240
nothing can deter them. They’re very joyous, happy people,

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.000
if you see their photographs, you’ll say they’re lotuses sitting down

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.040
beautifully pink. And the same thing is happening in India

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.240
where I’m working for a much shorter time than I have worked in England.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.160
England has a special place; I must say because in the universe

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.160
England is the heart of the universe.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.280
Perhaps you do not realize, you’re not aware of it.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.080
But English are very balanced people compared to

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.280
all other Western people, I must say. But despite that

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.280
sometimes you go off because you’ve lost your confidence,

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.280
you try to follow French, you try to follow Americans,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.120
they have to follow you, not that you have to follow them.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.200
You can articulate.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.120
Now once upon a time it was the industrial development

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.240
and all these things were there, so you articulated into these

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.120
but now that is over. Now it has to be spiritual development,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.040
for that also I think one has to work out in England.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.160
And that’s how perhaps My husband got elected to this job

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.160
and had to come to England. I’ve been here for ten years

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.320
while in India I was just two years after I started My work.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.080
Of course I travel all over and the most wonderful thing I’ve found out

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.160
about the Western people is that their hankering is no more now

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.080
for material things. It looks little bit but is not so much.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.320
Once they get to their realization, they want to save others,

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.200
they want to help others.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.160
Now all the way Dr. Warren has come from Australia.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.080
Now they said the psychology is such

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.080
if the Australians talk to the English, they feel happy.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.160
So we sent English to America and you’ll be surprised that in Houston

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.080
an Englishman went there and he was regarded as a very

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.280
respectable man, you see, and they all listened to him nicely.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.320
It’s a funny psychology but we have great Sahaja Yogis even in England.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.200
In England we have very great people who have mastered this art

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.120
and once you know this you become so scholarly

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.200
that many a times

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.080
these newspaper people ask Me,

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.240
“Have you got all your disciples as scholars?”

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.280
I said, “No, they’re not My disciples, they’re children.”

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.280
But they become scholarly because they get to the essence of knowledge

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
and this is the true knowledge.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.320
The otherwise whatever knowledge we have is of the dead.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.080
For example I was looking at your foundries, what do we do?

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.040
We take out the dead and make something out of it.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.320
Can we make anything living? Can we transform these flowers into fruits?

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.040
We cannot. After realization you start doing the living work

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.240
and this is the process which a living work of living God.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.320
So you just cannot say that, “I stand on my head

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.320
and I get the Kundalini there,” or, “I cut my hair short or

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.080
I have another kind of a dress.” It’s nothing outside.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.160
It’s inside the happening takes place and you become another person.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.320
In Sanskrit language we call a bird as dwijaha, means born again

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.120
and a Brahmin, the one who has known the power of Brahma,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.240
the power of God’s love, is called also dwijaha.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.240
Dwijaha, means the one who is born again.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.080
Now a bird is first is an egg and then it becomes a bird.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:43.120
That’s why you’ll be surprised that Christ when He was crucified

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.160
and when He was resurrected on the Easter day it is to show

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.280
that a person leaves this material body and becomes the Spirit.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.080
Resurrection is the message of Christ which is a very great thing

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.360
He achieved because He was nothing but Himself the Brahma,

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.400
the Chaitanya, Omkara, what you call the word. So that’s why He could

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.320
achieve that thing. It’s all written about Him in Indian Scriptures.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.080
You have to go out to see all these things,

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.280
what is the thing written about Christ.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.080
Bible cannot contain Him within Himself

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.080
and the four years life that He led in this misery

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:25.040
is not representative of His whole background.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.240
If you have to know about His background you have to read

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.160
some books which were written fourteen thousand years back.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.280
They have told about that. So when He resurrected what we do,

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:42.200
we present an egg on the Easter Sunday. What does that mean?

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.080
That on an Easter Sunday you’re an egg and on the Easter Monday

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:53.080
you are the bird. But we don’t know, we do it just automatically

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.320
without understanding why we give those eggs to people.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.320
This is what we have to understand. Even to understand Bible

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.280
we have to be self-realized, even to understand the life of Christ

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.240
which was just so great we have to be realized.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.080
Now the controversy about Christ has started, it really pains Me

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.080
that these people don’t want to take their realization,

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:20.120
otherwise how can you explain to them any miracle whatsoever?

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.400
Life is full of miracles.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.120
Even in My lifetime people have seen miracles happening.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:31.040
I don’t know if they have brought the photograph. Once I was giving

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.160
a lecture in a very remote village where there was a very great soul

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.280
who had died. And as soon as I entered the village I told them,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.200
“Who was the great soul who lived here?”

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.320
They said he was a Muslim called as Mian.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.240
And I sat down for My lecture and suddenly I found that I got connected

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.280
and there was a big light on My head coming.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.280
And then I saw it seven times the light was there and I got connected

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.080
and it showed that, that he was there with Me.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.000
And then suddenly I stopped it, like this laughing.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.320
Imagine the photograph was taken by one girl

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.240
and all these seven stages were clearly shown

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.080
and you could see the light there.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.360
Now these boys went to show to someone, they said,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.120
“Oh, you must have arranged all these in the village.”

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.280
But it was not, in that remote village there is no electricity also.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.280
So where’s the question of… and why should we arrange that?

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.280
There are so many miracles that have taken place in Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.080
so many miracles.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.400
I mean the President of India was cured of his cancer

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.320
in five minutes, you won’t believe it.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.080
He came to London from his operation

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.040
and it was very unsuccessful and he was going to die.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.320
And because of My husband I went to see him.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.240
We knew him otherwise but he didn’t know Me

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.040
that I was also Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.080
because I don’t tell this to these bureaucrats,

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.080
they’re rather difficult people.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.320
So it so happened that one of the…

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.200
that was B. K. Nehru who was the High Commissioner,

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.160
he told, “Do you know this lady is Mataji Nirmala Devi?”

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.240
And the wife of the President had heard My name

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.320
as Mataji Nirmala Devi also

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.160
and she said, “Mataji, why don’t you cure my husband?”

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.200
And he said, “Yes I didn’t know you were Mataji Nirmala Devi.”

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.080
I said, “All right.” So I put My hand on his back.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.400
In five minutes…, he could not sleep, he was so much with pain.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.400
He said, ”I’m feeling so relieved I want to lie down and sleep.”

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.120
He went off to sleep. They had prepared for his cremation

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.080
and everything in India and a big show was there, imagine,

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.080
and they reached with the ambulance there.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.080
And there he walked down the steps and they saw him, they thought,

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.200
“Is this his ghost walking or what?”

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.240
He told Me all the story in a very jocular way

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:44.320
and he said that, “I don’t know, I went, after that I forgot that I was sick

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.360
and I went on a tour.” And next year when I went his wife showed Me

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.320
that even the mark of the operation had gone, but I must say he must

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.120
have been a very great soul to get that way, in such a simple way.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.240
And then he said, “You must have Mother some land because you must

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.080
have some place where people should meet you.”

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.240
And so he allotted some land to us

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.400
and that’s how now we have some land in Delhi.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:14.280
But what I’m trying to tell you that miracles are the nature of God.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.400
For human beings He’s miraculous, isn’t it? He’s not human being,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.080
how can we judge Him with our limited brain?

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.480
He can do whatever He likes and He is full of miracles.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.240
These intellectuals cannot understand Him.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.040
For example, Paul, he was an intellectual,

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.120
he was no way a free man, he was not a realized soul

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.080
and how can he understand Christ, he cannot.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.080
Because he was just an organizer and intellectual.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.000
You have to be a realized soul and you’ll be surprised Khalil Gibran

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.080
has clearly written about Paul if you read him because Khalil Gibran

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.280
was a realized soul that, “I can’t understand this strange man

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.080
and he’s not a free soul,” and how is he in Bible?

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.040
When I first saw the Bible I was surprised. I said, “How is he here?

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.080
Who is he? I have never known him.” That’s what it is

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.240
but we get enamored by his organizing capacity,

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.400
the way he’s organized everything. You cannot organize God, can you?

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.040
How can you organize God? Nobody should feel shattered because

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.120
they are saying they were not miracles and they were allegories.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.320
You will meet so many miracles as soon as you will become the Spirit.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.320
God is full of miracles.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.120
Every miracle that is described of Christ is true.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:34.000
It was an immaculate conception. And we have His previous life,

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.280
we know how He was created on this earth through complete

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:42.080
immaculate conception by a virgin and everything we know about it

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.240
in India and Indians are shocked how could you accept such a nonsense

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.200
from people who are just intellectuals, they’re not realized souls.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:55.240
Thank God in India even today people know what is a realized soul is.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.200
Even the president, he would not sit down when I went to see him.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.080
He would not sit down, I said, “Sir, I’m your citizen,” he said,

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.080
“No, Mother you’re a saint.” And he sat on the ground,

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.320
he wouldn’t sit with Me on the same couch which he was having.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.080
That’s what it is. Our sensitivity in the West is gone down

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.080
because of intellectualism. Even the science is a barrier,

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.400
all these things are barriers, you see, and this barrier we must

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.320
understand we have to become the same innocent person

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.240
as Christ has said that you have to become children

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.480
to enter into the kingdom of God. And this happens to you

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.320
as soon as the Kundalini rises you become innocent,

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.080
you become an innocent person. Innocent doesn’t mean a fool,

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.520
innocent is the most intelligent, is the most powerful person.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.440
And a person who is a realized soul is also not a compromising person,

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.240
“All right, if the churches are not working

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.120
let us have a discotheque here.”

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.120
That’s not possible, how can you have discotheque?

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.320
Like in India in the temples they are selling all these drugs,

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.320
can you imagine? Everywhere in all the religions they’re doing this

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.520
compromising with the truth. Because they have no power;

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.240
if you have the spiritual power you’ll not compromise with anyone.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.320
See the life of Christ.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.560
He took one hunter and started hitting all the people who were

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.080
sitting outside and selling things outside the temple.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.560
It was He who stood against the people who were trying

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.320
to throw stones at a prostitute and challenging because He knew

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.480
that everybody was sinful and nobody had right to judge others.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.320
It was His power that made Him stand against all of them.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.160
I would say anyone of these who talk against Christ like this

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.440
should stand up and say it. Have they got courage?

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.400
They have no courage and that’s why I say they are not free people,

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.000
they’re bound.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.080
If you want to attract people this is not the way to attract,

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.280
through unreal thinking and mental projection.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.280
But by giving them their realization, their property, what they have.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:02.320
They don’t want to accept it because they think they’ll be challenged.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.320
They all can get realization themselves but they will not come forward.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.320
So don’t believe when they say that there were no miracles of Christ.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.280
Without miracles how are we created; ourselves we are miraculous.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:19.280
Think of ourselves; we are made like a computer which doesn’t think,

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.080
it doesn’t need any programming. When you are seeing Me,

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.320
you are seeing Me, you don’t have to think about it, isn’t it?

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.280
What a great computer we are made. Can they make even a flower?

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:35.560
What are they talking of intellectualizing and the miracles of miracles

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.360
that are so many, how we are channelized, how we are born,

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:46.080
how out of thousands of genes, one gene is used for the eyes,

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.320
one for the nose, how they develop into a particular thing.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.560
Just look at the miracle of the whole universe,

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.040
we don’t want to see that because we are becoming egoistical about it.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.320
We think that we can manage God, we can organize Him,

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.280
we can do whatever we like. In the same realm, when we start seeing

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.000
the horrible people coming from India and looting you,

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:12.480
we succumb to them because they pamper your ego. They say,

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.440
“All right, you can pay for me” “Oh, we can buy him, he’s for sale.”

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.240
And now, I was surprised among the elite societies, it’s very funny

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:26.160
but it’s true, they discuss, “I think this guru is three pounds less,”

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.400
or, “That guru you can say five pounds,” it’s a big discussion on.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.480
It’s a guru-shopping going on, you see.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.240
I’ve been talking against them for the last twelve years

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.240
openly taking their names and blasting them.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.040
About this Scientology, I told them in Brighton two years back

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.480
and now they’ve found out about this Scientology.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.440
So the Brighton radio was very kind to Me and they called Me.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.360
I said, “When I told you, you were the ones who blasted Me,

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.160
then why should you say this against Scientology?”

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.560
Anybody who takes money from you in the name of God,

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.400
know that he is a devil. No one should take any money

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.280
in the name of God. All right you have to have the hall,

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.440
you pay for the hall not for God. If your climate was all right,

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.040
we could have done it outside but paying for the hall

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.320
is different from paying for God. And the way these people have

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.480
minted money is your naiveness, your stupidity, I should say

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.080
that you didn’t understand this simple thing that these people are

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.480
buying lots of aero planes and Rolls-Royces and you’re paying for it.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.440
Still I must say, English are wiser than many others.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.160
Like in America, I went and they told Me,

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.080
“How many Rolls-Royces she has?”

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.440
They said, “She has no Rolls Royce,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.480
She doesn’t take any money,” so they said, “We are not interested.”

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.080
It’s a pop show going on, you see, how much money you make

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.280
in this guru business.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.360
If somebody is a smart one, if he has made a big money,

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.480
“Oh, he’s a smart fellow, he’s made so much money.”

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.480
Can you imagine how money-oriented they are?

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:01.000
You’re not, you are much better. So keep to your styles and I’m sure

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:05.040
British will one day teach all of them a proper thing which is

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.560
called is the proper balanced spiritual life.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.080
Somehow in this lifetime I have learned English language,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.280
I’m not so good but I can speak English and you should not mind

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.480
if I have made any mistakes in English language. But one thing

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:22.480
is there that English is much better than many other foreign languages

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.080
because I find there is no word for awareness in French,

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.280
how to translate awareness. There’s no word for conscience,

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.440
there’s no word for consciousness, there’s only one ‘conscia’,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.520
whatever you call it. Of course English also has little problems.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.320
Like for spirit, you call the spirit that is dead the spirit,

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:45.560
then you call the spirit that you get in the pubs also the spirit

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:52.080
and also you call the spirit, that’s the pure thing within yourself,

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:56.240
the reflection of God as spirit, and also the Holy Ghost as the Spirit.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.240
But in Sanskrit language, because it deals more, more with the roots

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.120
it has more words for all these things.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:10.040
But it may not have so many words for the use of the, say,

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.280
a glass and the tumbler for this kind of a wine and that,

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.280
that it may not have anything about it, it’s a general thing,

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:22.320
what we call as one word for the whole. All pubs are one word

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:27.240
and all alcohols and everything is one word.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.560
There’s no differentiation at all because they do not know this area

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.480
but the area they know, for that, they have different words.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.240
And that’s why sometimes one has to take to Sanskrit language

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:41.240
in a way to understand. But you need not worry because we can do it

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.120
in English language also very well now, it’s very simple.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.080
Now the happening takes place and then you become empowered

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.480
and then you should only learn to maneuver it.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:57.080
So the yoga has two meanings, the first one means

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.400
the union with the Divine,

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.240
it is ‘sahaja’ meaning spontaneous because in the modern times

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.480
there are all kinds of yogas. So it is a spontaneous, living yoga

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.320
and that’s the only one is the real yoga, the rest is all

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:14.520
something like an exercise. And the second part of the yoga means

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.240
that the deftness to know the art of handling this power.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.280
That’s why they said when they got their realization or

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.480
when they got the blessings of the Holy Spirit they started moving

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.240
their hands in such a way that people thought that they were mad,

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.280
but the whole of Namaz itself is awakening of the Kundalini,

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.080
the whole of Namaz is. And the way we move our hands, you see,

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.320
the power moves through our hands. So the movement of our hands

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.400
gives us the empowering and we know how to handle this power

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.480
within ourselves so you become your own guru.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.560
Now as I’m here for the first time I would like you to ask Me questions

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:56.040
about Sahaja Yoga, about anything but still I would say you need not

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.280
be aggressive with Me because it’s not good and don’t waste the energy

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.480
of other people because there are many people who are seekers here

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.480
I can see very clearly writ large on their faces,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.240
they’re real seekers of ages and let them have their seeking.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.480
Now if you have any such questions which you want to ask

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.480
you can ask Me because in a short lecture like this,

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.360
in one visit what could I do, how much could I tell you?

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.280
I must have given at least two thousand lectures in English language

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.320
and they are all on the tapes and later on you can get them

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.080
and listen to them, the nature of the Spirit,

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.200
what it means to be realized,

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:40.000
how we become the citizens of God’s kingdom, what is God’s kingdom

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.080
within us, where are these chakras placed, everything I’ve told

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.400
and everything is to be told to you. There are some books also

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.600
we have written but we don’t give books in the beginning

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
because again, you see, the brain starts thinking about it.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.600
You have to be in thoughtless awareness, so there only you grow.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.360
So we don’t want you to give some food for thought all the time

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.640
so that you are all on a thinking level but you should grow

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.280
and that’s why one has to understand

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.320
that this lecture is not sufficient enough

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.640
but is just an introduction to Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.200
It was suddenly decided that I have to come here to Middlesbrough

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.680
and this gentleman rang Me up and I found him very positive.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:22.320
It was very great, you see, and I think people are little in a puzzle

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.400
these days because the way everything is attacked.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:33.240
And I think in a way it’s good because that will give them a curiosity

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.120
to ascend. May God bless you all.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.600
I would like to have some questions from you.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:53.160
(Warren: Any questions? Very soon Shri Mataji will give you the experience

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.080
and you can begin to feel what She’s speaking of.)

00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.120
I shouldn’t say I will give you because you’ll get it.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.080
It’s like the sun shining saying, “I’m shining,”

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.000
I mean it has to shine jolly well, that’s its nature,

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.040
and we have to get the sunshine, jolly well.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.520
It just works spontaneously.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.440
(Question: You gave this yoga a particular name,

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.240
how many types of yoga do you have?)

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.320
I don’t know, as many brains there are in this world,

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.680
but there’s only one yoga, is Sahaja.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.360
If you read the Patanjali Yoga from which this so-called yoga has come,

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.480
has got ahstangas eight folds, out of which a wee bit

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:48.480
is called as yamanyama, in that a wee bit is the exercises.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.360
But these exercises are of no use without the Kundalini awakening.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:56.080
It’s written very clearly but nobody reads that big book, you see.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.560
Somebody has read only the beginning of it

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.080
and has started calling it yoga.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:05.400
Now you have to make the Kundalini start

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.480
and then you know where the problem is,

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.160
for example, you have a problem in the stomach

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.600
and if you are doing the exercise of the neck what’s the use.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.280
But the way people do sometimes it frightens Me;

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.000
they want to take out the whole of their intestines outside,

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.520
the way they are at it, it’s too much. There’s no need to do all that

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.480
because that will really give you a heart attack or something like that.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.200
It gives Me a terrible fright;

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:36.240
yoga doesn’t mean exercise by any chance, it means giving relief

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.080
to a particular center which is obstructed, and how to do it,

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:44.400
we also do exercises whenever it is needed to a particular thing

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.320
but it’s very simple one, once in a while. It’s not like madness all the time,

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.200
even people who do yoga I’ve seen,

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.480
they cannot sit for one minute straight, you see.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:58.040
They just go into all these tantrums, it’s very difficult to understand.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:01.600
You become very normal, decent people.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.360
So the other yogas I don't know what they are all like,

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.240
Kundalini yoga you can call it, is the Kundalini yoga

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.560
if you want elaborately say it, Kundalini Yoga,

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.480
it's Sahaja Yoga or you can call it Yoga itself.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.240
But I have called it Sahaja is not the point

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.400
is a word very ancient Sahaja Saha-ja,

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:27.080
'Saha' means with, 'ja' means born, it's born with you

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.280
Like every seed can become a tree, it is born with you,

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:36.440
you all can become that tree of life.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.560
I could have said yoga, but it means nothing

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.280
I have seen people who were taking some drugs and

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.440
I said, "What are you doing?" They said, "We are doing drug yoga."

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.400
Everything is a yoga these days, you don't know.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.120
Coca-Cola yoga, all kinds of yoga.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:06.280
Yes, I tell you it is. Human beings are really ingenious,

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:10.560
the way they manage everything. They know how to mess up everything.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.560
(Question: There are many interpretations of the Bible,

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.400
how do you know that your interpretation is the correct one?)

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:32.600
Because it can be proved,

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.280
it can be proved - you see the interpretations that

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:39.600
come out of brains will be many -

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:44.640
because it can be proved, you see now for example I say Christ resides

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.640
on a center called as Agnya chakra

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.440
which is placed on the optic chiasma

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.240
which is controlling your pituitary and the pineal body,

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.320
supposing I say that, all right? Now you keep your mind open about it.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.040
Now when I raise the Kundalini

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.320
I find that it is stuck here.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.440
This is the window; this is the window of Christ.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:13.200
This is the blood of Christ, symbolic of His blood which protects you.

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.680
Now this is the window of Christ.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.480
Now when I say that, this interpretation,

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:23.000
that when the Kundalini is rising, it stops there.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.440
I have to take His name, request Him

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.560
or I have to say Lord's Prayer.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.600
That's the mantra, that's the chanting one has to do, then it rises.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:40.320
He sucks in your ego and superego and you can see it clearly

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:45.520
happening that here on the fontanel bone area, you get a soft bone

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.480
and you see the cool breeze coming out of it.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:54.320
Now, you ask a question, putting your hands like this,

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.560
ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:03.640
The vibrations start flowing much more.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:08.440
Supposing you ask about somebody who is not a good man

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.200
the burning may start coming on your fingers.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.400
Now supposing you say there is no God,

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.080
you may get a terrible burning on your hands.

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:21.400
So relatively you understand that whenever you ask for something

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.480
truthful you get lot of vibrations.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.160
That means your computer has started working

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:34.720
but for anything you find out whether it is true or not

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.400
you have to work it out and see for yourself.

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:42.200
Now when it happens with this if you get cured automatically,

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:47.440
if you become a joyous personality, if you get completely transformed

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.440
and you start curing others and you know all about it,

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.720
you become knowledgeable about it. It’s not that

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:57.280
you start shaking before someone and then the person gets…,

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:02.080
you are quite normal and not only that you cure

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.360
but you make another person so peaceful and joyful

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:10.440
and enlighten that person that that person can himself give realization.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.720
You can see the Kundalini, the one that is in the triangular bone

00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.800
just like a heart pulsating in some people, not all,

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.680
if there’s an obstruction in the higher chakra

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.360
then you see it actually like that. We have got pictures of that.

00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:28.600
So whatever interpretation you give mentally is not true,

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:34.760
you must prove it. So you have to accept it as a hypothesis.

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.040
As in any science you give a hypothesis first

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.520
and then try to prove it.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.480
If you have proved it then you have to accept it as a law

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:49.080
otherwise you are dishonest. If you’re honest,

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.120
really if you’re honest you have to accept it, isn’t it?

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.000
That’s what My husband told Me that, “I cannot be anymore

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:59.360
dishonest about it, I have to accept it, that’s the truth.”

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.720
All right, now what’s the other question?

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.760
(Warren: She’s heard and read that if you awaken Kundalini

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.480
before it’s ready it can be dangerous.)

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.560
Yes, must be, because the people who raise have no authority to do it;

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.800
they don’t know how to do it. A person who is not a doctor

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.720
if he tries to operate, what will happen? It’s dangerous.

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.440
So far so many people their Kundalini has been awakened.

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.080
I haven’t seen any dangerous things happen to anyone,

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.280
on the contrary everybody has gained by it.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.480
The reason is you should know how to do it, you should be

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:43.320
an authority to do it. Supposing you put one seed in the steel box,

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:47.080
will it grow? No, you have to put it in the Mother Earth,

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:51.080
she has the capacity to do it. In the same way the one who knows

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.360
can do it, has to be an authority on it, and it is your Mother,

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.000
She is your Mother. Everyone has an individual mother

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.400
waiting to give that self-realization, how can She be unkind to you?

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:07.680
Of course, in the beginning little heat is thrown out of your body

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:10.480
because you’re heated up. It’s all right, doesn’t matter,

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.560
it’s not so much and sometimes you do feel little shaking

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:17.120
if you have been to a wrong type of a guru or something

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.040
or if you are suffering from nervous trouble

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.800
there’s a little shaking that's all.

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.560
I have not seen anything wrong happening

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.480
but like one gentleman came and sat on the ground. I said,

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.400
“Why are you sitting on the ground like that with your feet towards me?”

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.080
He said, “You know Mother, my Kundalini has been awakened

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.280
and I’m jumping like a frog.” I said, “Why are you jumping like a frog?”

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:39.280
He said, “My guru has said it and he wrote it down on a book

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:43.000
that you jump like a frog.” I said, “Now are you going to become a frog

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:50.040
or an earthworm?” Use your brains, all right?

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.200
Nothing to be afraid of.

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.480
I don’t think I look that frightful, do I?

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.320
(Warren: If there are no more questions we’ll have the experience.)

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.520
No, one more, yes let’s have it.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.160
Yes, please!

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.000
It's a very long question.

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:16.120
(Warren: First of all, she says that she agrees with everything

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:19.160
that You’ve said, but she’s concerned about one thing,

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:26.480
as she herself is a spiritualist medium, she is aware of the dangers

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:31.120
and she wonders whether You are able to distinguish

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:33.280
between the dangers and the blessings.)

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:38.760
Absolutely, that’s what it is, that you should know what are the dangers.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.480
I’ve already told you, moving to the left and the right

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:43.760
and the spiritualists are moving to the left.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.200
They’re using spirits and it’s very dangerous. You don’t know how

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.320
to protect yourself, unless and until you get your realization

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.320
you will not even know how spiritualism is wrong;

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.800
absolutely it is most dangerous.

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.440
There is no danger in Kundalini, but in spiritualism

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.080
it’s most dangerous, whether you may be all right for the short time

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.760
but they are spirits, you must know

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.360
and spirits are the most dangerous things. Don’t go near them.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.480
It’s very surprising that in the West,

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.480
people have no idea about spirits

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.080
and the way they go headlong into it, it sometimes really upsets Me.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.400
In India people know about it, they call it Bhootavidya, Pretavidya,

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:30.600
Smashanavidya, means the knowledge about the dead, we can say,

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.720
in small the dead knowledge and they just don’t want to go near it.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.240
Say, the other day we had a visitor and I took her to a church

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.720
and she was holding her sari, going like this. I said,

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.720
“What’s the problem?” She said, “All dead are here,

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:48.600
how can we cross over them?” She couldn’t understand

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.080
and we have them in the churches where children go.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.160
It’s very dangerous. Only the realized people in India are buried,

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.000
only realized souls are buried, not the people who are not realized.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.440
They’re not to be buried; they’re to be burned so that their body

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.240
gets purified and again they come on this earth for their realization.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.360
And the dead in the church! It’s so dangerous,

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.680
playing with spiritualists, nobody will do.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.200
Here I find housewives, and all people responsible

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.760
getting into this mess of spiritualism.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.000
It’s all absolutely against Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.680
We have nothing to do with them. On the contrary they suffer a lot.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.160
Spiritualists suffer a lot later on in life.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.280
Not only but seven generations of their family can suffer.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.080
We had a doctor here who came and I was surprised that

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.040
he being a doctor was suffering from this kind of a disease.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.680
He was a Russian doctor and I asked him, “How did you get into it?”

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.160
So he told me his mother, his grandmother had a hobby to take him

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.480
to the cemetery. From his childhood he used to go to the cemetery.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.800
We could not locate the problem anywhere, he was very depressed

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.320
and he used to get into problems and he had to give up his jobs.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.360
Now then we met another Indian doctor who was here

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.120
and he had the same type of trouble, he’d given up his job and

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.200
his wife didn’t know what to do and his children were also suffering.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.720
So I asked him a question, “Why, why you are like this?

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.640
What did you do with your studies?” And he was quite normal.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.640
He said, “I led a very normal life.” But his grandfather used to do

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.680
black magic, in the sense we call it, all this is black magic.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.200
All spiritualism is black magic, because it has to deal with the dead.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.280
And this boy was suffering, his children were suffering.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.080
Now we have one person from Guyana,

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.360
another one from Guyana,

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.400
he too, his father used to do this kind of a thing and he is suffering,

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.680
he’s still suffering. He’s come to Sahaja Yoga and he’s still…

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.120
but he can see now and he knows how to protect.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.480
So those who deal with dead are going to suffer, take it from me,

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.720
whatever you may do, because they’re just like human beings

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.720
and sometimes slyer people than we are.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.040
We should have nothing to do with the dead.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.600
Let them take their birth again, let them take their realization.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.600
All anorexia, all these diseases come out of that.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.120
So many diseases I’ve told you, cancer is caused by the dead.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.200
Be careful on that point and I don’t understand

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.200
all educated people here, so much developed,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.600
how can you take…, Indians won’t take to it.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.760
They won’t go near it; they understand.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.200
Tantrikas and all that are prevalent only in very poor countries

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.240
like… say, it’s a vicious circle, it brings poverty also. As soon as

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.800
there is a dead in a family or a dead work done, the money disappears.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.440
The reason is the goddess of Lakshmi as we call them,

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:57.000
she just disappears, she doesn’t like that black thing at all.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.800
And so the countries where we have, I mean, in our country

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.080
the provinces which are poor, the whole country is not poor,

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.480
they’re doing all black magic. In Kerala, it’s very poor country,

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.720
I went there, they bury their dead in the house.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.720
It is all that. You must keep them out,

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:20.800
because the goddess of wealth doesn’t like it.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.080
All this knowledge was not known to you but that doesn’t mean

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.560
that you should go headlong into these things, it’s very, very dangerous.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.760
Never go near the dead; whatever it is the planet said,

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.520
this, that, it’s all nonsensical.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.360
There’s no need to do that. But people are really…,

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.080
I don’t understand, they’re daredevils.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.400
Like from America three big scientists came to see me,

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.160
in India I’m very well-known. So they came to see me and said that,

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.280
“Mother, teach us how to fly in the air.” I said,

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.320
“Why do you want to fly in the air? What is the need?”

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.400
“No, we want to leave our body and go to the moon.” I said,

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.200
“You are already doing it with your body, why do you want to do it?”

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:06.720
So they told me that, “Parapsychology is practiced now in Russia

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.520
and we want to do the same.” I said, “It will affect them.”

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:15.360
You see the way their presidents are killed, this is all parapsychology.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.080
I told them, “Don’t go near them.” They said, “No Mother,

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.600
we want to do it.” I said, “But then you will be slaves of these dead,

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.760
would you like to do that?” Still they said, “Yes we want to do it.”

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.280
I said, “I have nothing to do but who has told you about this?”

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.520
They said, “There is one fellow, Patanjali, who is a reporter.”

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.600
I said, “Look at this Patanjali, he was suffering from this trouble,

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.560
that his body used to be left behind and he would fly out and do…”

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.680
And he came and his wife came and begged of me that

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.440
they should be rid of this trouble and he’s telling them that

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.200
am I going to put the trouble into them?

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.000
All this parapsychology business, when I went first to America

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.760
I must tell you, this experience is very good.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.480
I told them against parapsychology openly because they,

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.560
I didn’t know what they were doing in parapsychology, first of all,

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.760
and they are the people who invited me in their hall. I blasted them

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.720
and I said, “Don’t do all this nonsense, it will all destroy you,

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.520
just don’t go near them.”

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.360
Second time when I went to America, only last year,

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.520
I was giving on the television, I was on the television

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.800
and before the television they had told that Mataji Nirmala Devi

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:32.240
is going to come. And somebody telephoned from San Diego saying that,

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.600
“Mother had come last time and she told us about parapsychology

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.360
and she told us about the gurus, she warned us but we never listened

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.480
to her and now we are destroyed people. Can she save us?” I said,

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:49.280
“Yes, but still it’s difficult now, you should not have gone to that.”

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.800
And the whole of that parapsychology thing is finished now.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.160
The building caught fire, the gentleman went to Australia,

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:04.720
he got a funny temperament, he ended up in a lunatic asylum.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.320
The wife, she became paralytic, she ended up in a lunatic asylum.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:16.000
Brezhnev and all these people, they all suffered from this.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.520
You can see their faces, all like this, possessed.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.080
Don’t go near the spiritualists;

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.680
don’t do that, it’s very dangerous, for you,

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.480
for the progeny, for everyone. I must warn you;

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.480
it’s the most dangerous thing and should not do that.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.120
Even if you don’t like it, I have to tell you.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.080
I don’t want to tell you something that’s not true.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.200
You depend on yourself, on your own Spirit, on your own being.

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.040
Why to depend on somebody who’s dead, let them be alone.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.400
But when they suffer, they come to me, I’ve seen it,

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.120
when they suffer then they come.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.400
Then it’s so difficult, you see, afterwards to give them

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.160
realization, it’s so difficult, they’ve already harmed themselves.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:13.720
He (Warren) also had gone to someone like that, but his wife we lost

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:17.600
because she was going too much of it; we’ve lost her, she’s…,

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:22.080
I don’t know, she may come back, but I mean, she’s very much attacked,

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.080
very much attacked. And she used to become like a furious personality

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.400
and all sorts of things used to happen to her and I hope she comes back

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.080
but it’s very difficult, you know, to pull them back out of the clutches

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.480
of that, because they don’t know what they’re are doing,

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.320
what they’re talking, how they’re behaving.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:45.040
A sickness of the worst type. Even AIDS is a sickness from the same.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.720
Most of the terminal diseases come from them.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.040
It’s very dangerous, don’t go near them.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.480
Christ has already told you; he’s the one who told so plainly,

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.680
he took them out and put them in the pigs and pigs went into the sea.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.760
You have heard of that or not;

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.520
so why do you want to bring them back? Put them in the pigs.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.480
If they don’t want to reside in the area where they are supposed

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.920
to reside, let them go to pigs.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.360
They’ve no business… they’re busybodies, you know.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.720
There’re also one Dr. Lang in here. I must tell them about him,

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:26.880
this Dr. Lang, late Dr. Lang, dead. And he capsized a man

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.200
in Vietnam who was a soldier who was under a shock

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.400
and this soldier came down to London

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.720
to see his son and he said, “I’m Dr. Lang.”

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:40.840
The son was shocked, he said, “Who? How are you… my father is dead.”

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.240
He said, “No, your father has possessed me, and he has told me

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.840
that I must start my clinic here and there are many doctors

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.680
who want to help me and I’m going to start this clinic.”

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.440
So the son listened to it and he said, “How am I to believe

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.920
that you are my father?” Then he told him some secrets

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.320
which were between the two, and told about the house

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.840
where he had put some money and all that.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.280
And the son was surprised and he started the clinic;

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.800
and that’s how the International Curative Centre of Late Dr. Lang

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:19.320
started in London. How I came to know about it, that in 1974

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.520
I met a lady, she was shaking all the time like this.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.200
I said, “What’s this?”

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.000
She said, “Mother, I don’t know but I was cured by Dr. Lang,

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.760
late Dr. Lang.” Then she told me the story. But they were honest

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.160
to tell about this whole thing what had happened but he did not enter

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.760
into the body of the boy, his son, entered into somebody else

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.640
who was a very healthy man. And she told me that,

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.120
“When I wrote to them, I am suffering from these troubles,

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.880
stomach trouble, they told me that you will have the experience

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.040
at such and such exact this time.” That shows it’s not living

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.800
because you cannot give time to something that is living. You cannot

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.240
say exactly what time a flower is going to become the fruit, can you?

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.320
And this thing entered into her body, she started shaking, shaking,

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.520
and her stomach was all right.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.520
For about two years she was all right, afterwards the whole body

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.880
started shaking, she became like a mad woman.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.600
She used to run out of the house and people would say that,

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.240
“This woman is going to kill herself.” Once she jumped from

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.760
a very high ceiling just to kill herself but somehow she was saved,

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.160
and they brought her to Me and she told me the story of late Dr. Lang.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.480
So I have to tell you, though they cure you for a while,

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.240
don’t go near them, better you cure yourself and know all about it.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.800
You be the master of yourself.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.080
It’s nice she brought out the point because otherwise…

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.920
it’s all Sahaj, it’s spontaneous, so that I could tell you about it;

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.400
it’s quite possible that people could take to that.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.600
Now should we have the experience now, all of us?
