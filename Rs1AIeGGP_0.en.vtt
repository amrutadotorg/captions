00:17.270 --> 01:43.100
Havan on the day of Puja to Shri Krishna as
Yogeshwara, 1982-08-15

01:43.100 --> 01:44.300
Bahjan: Govinda Bolo

01:44.300 --> 01:45.500
Child: what's happening?

01:45.500 --> 01:46.500
…. Mother is coming.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.500
Bahjan: Govinda Bolo

01:47.500 --> 01:48.500
Indistinct voices of children

01:48.500 --> 01:51.720
Sahaja Children: questioning Shri Mataji [Marathi?]

01:51.720 --> 01:53.830
Shri Mataji: [Marathi?]

01:53.830 --> 02:00.640
Her blue sweater, just find out from Olympia's
Mother.

02:00.640 --> 02:13.390
…. [to the child] please sit there.

02:13.390 --> 02:24.700
Child: Did Olympia's mother come?

02:24.700 --> 02:31.490
Shri Mataji: [Marathi?]

02:31.490 --> 02:48.450
Today is the combination of Shri Krishna,
this one (is) his face and this is his dress.

02:48.450 --> 02:58.110
Ah, I think someone should go and find out
from...

02:58.110 --> 03:01.470
Joan [Mother calls a Yogi].

03:01.470 --> 03:20.140
Her sweater, her sweater is with … she said
she has given to Olympia her blue sweater.

03:20.140 --> 03:26.450
Light blue

03:26.450 --> 03:35.910
Child: Light blue

03:35.910 --> 03:56.890
Shri Mataji: What are the words, Vishnu's
names, in English.

03:56.890 --> 04:06.430
Better take it in English, better.

04:06.430 --> 04:15.970
(Mother talks to a baby-child [Marathi?].

04:15.970 --> 04:22.330
Ah, better take her.

04:22.330 --> 04:26.460
Take the names.

04:26.460 --> 04:31.720
In English they are easy to take I think.

04:31.720 --> 04:43.880
Only the first, one should take them.

04:43.880 --> 04:55.319
Ah, does somebody has a shawl, [Marathi?]

04:55.319 --> 05:04.800
Ne, it's alright.

05:04.800 --> 05:20.820
Actually we should have Rasaali (?) playing
with that, it would be nice, it doesn't matter.

05:20.820 --> 05:27.159
These are the names of Vishnu, because Vishnu
only achieved the status of Shri Krishna who

05:27.159 --> 05:34.319
in his own life time expresses his complete
form of Virata.

05:34.319 --> 05:36.699
Complete form of Virata.

05:36.699 --> 05:48.770
And this is a very good understanding, if
you know that you are also, start the dharma,

05:48.770 --> 05:54.990
establish your Dharma and then you become
a witness, and then you become part and parcel

05:54.990 --> 05:58.220
of the whole, the Virata.

05:58.220 --> 06:02.409
The same pattern takes place in you also,
in the evolutionary process.

34:22.809 --> 34:32.980
Yogi: all the badas that stop us feeling vibrations

34:32.980 --> 34:38.409
Yogis: Om Swaha

34:38.409 --> 34:43.300
Yogi: all the badas that gives us excuses
and (meditating ?) properly

34:43.300 --> 34:44.300
Yogis: Om Swaha

34:44.300 --> 34:45.300
Shri Mataji: now, what else?

34:45.300 --> 34:47.120
Yogi: all the badas that make us judge others

34:47.120 --> 34:49.280
Shri Mataji: of what?

34:49.280 --> 34:50.899
Yogi: judging others

34:50.899 --> 34:53.020
Shri Mataji: who says that?

34:53.020 --> 34:58.320
Yogis: all laughing, more than one answers:
Harry

34:58.320 --> 35:00.970
Shri Mataji: all right

35:00.970 --> 35:02.300
Om Swaha

35:02.300 --> 35:06.270
Yogi: all the badas that make us see others....
as others.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.320
Mother and Yogis: laughing everybody

35:08.320 --> 35:10.040
Yogis: Om Swaha

35:10.040 --> 35:21.320
Shri Mataji: You are all part and parcel of
yourself, and if something is wrong is better

35:21.320 --> 35:25.280
you judge yourself, that's the best part.

35:25.280 --> 35:33.990
How much do you love, how much do you respect,
discipline, of Sahaja Yoga.

35:33.990 --> 35:49.470
You have to sacrifice something for Sahaja
Yogis, is it?

35:49.470 --> 35:55.630
Lets count how many things have you sacrificed
so far for Sahaja Yoga.

35:55.630 --> 36:01.810
You have gained a lot, but you have to sacrifice.

36:01.810 --> 36:13.920
How much have you sacrificed for sahaja yoga,
you cant even sacrifice little comfort.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.960
All badas against sacrifice.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.020
Yogis: Om Swaha

36:21.020 --> 36:24.400
Shri Mataji: All badas against forbearing

36:24.400 --> 36:26.590
Yogis: Om Swaha

36:26.590 --> 36:30.000
Shri Mataji: All badas against wisdom

36:30.000 --> 36:32.170
Yogis: Om Swaha

36:32.170 --> 36:39.670
Shri Mataji: (? loving each other when there
is no ?) All badas against that

36:39.670 --> 36:42.970
Yogis: Om Swaha

36:42.970 --> 36:48.010
Shri Mataji: All badas against teasing your
Mother

36:48.010 --> 36:50.390
Yogis: Om Swaha

36:50.390 --> 36:56.760
Shri Mataji: I just want you to love each
other, that's all.

36:56.760 --> 36:58.270
Nothing else

36:58.270 --> 37:03.060
Yogi: all badas against resentment and jealousy

37:03.060 --> 37:09.390
Yogis: Om Swaha

37:09.390 --> 37:13.870
Yogi: All badas of (?)

37:13.870 --> 37:17.050
Yogis: Om Swaha

37:17.050 --> 37:24.080
Shri Mataji: and also those who are organizing
should not be dominating.

37:24.080 --> 37:28.920
They should be understanding and should know
they must respect the freedom of everyone.

37:28.920 --> 37:33.109
It should be mutual, it should be no something
with a rod.

37:33.109 --> 37:39.480
Sahaja Yoga cannot be done through a rod,
but if someone is trying that, you better

37:39.480 --> 37:40.480
accept it for the time being.

37:40.480 --> 37:45.810
Is not good for the person who is trying such
thing, to be using the rod all the time.

37:45.810 --> 37:51.690
Try to have a reasonable attitude for everything,
reasonable, there is nothing to fight, there

37:51.690 --> 37:57.400
is nothing to quarrel, there is nothing to
ahh... think that somebody is more dear to

37:57.400 --> 37:58.940
me and somebody is not.

37:58.940 --> 38:02.750
You see, those who look dear maybe they are
not.

38:02.750 --> 38:05.400
So don't do all that.

38:05.400 --> 38:10.550
Just try to be kind to each other, try to
understand, try to help, try to guide, somebody

38:10.550 --> 38:13.850
has some weaknesses, all right, try to help
that person.

38:13.850 --> 38:17.099
If somebody has weaknesses, you should not
capitalize all that.

38:17.099 --> 38:21.820
It should be worthy, but I can see (?) is
coming now.

38:21.820 --> 38:25.080
So I don't want miss the moment, I can feel
it, that's coming, no doubt.

38:25.080 --> 38:33.260
Some how I have a feeling now, and I have
seldom (felt ?) in my feelings.

38:33.260 --> 38:41.930
So some golden (age ?) I can see (along the
lines ?). I am sure something great is going

38:41.930 --> 38:42.930
to happen.

38:42.930 --> 38:45.210
May God bless you for this day.

38:45.210 --> 38:52.711
It was a great day and the birth of Shri Krishna,
should be within us, within ourselves, so

38:52.711 --> 38:58.270
our Vishuddi should be all right balanced
witnessing and control our ego and superego

38:58.270 --> 39:07.080
in such a manner that the Kundalini is kept
above on to a higher level, attention on to

39:07.080 --> 39:08.780
a higher level.

39:08.780 --> 39:13.580
I think from today I'll stop calling you anymore.

39:13.580 --> 39:19.360
And I have a feeling now we have to go very
fast, and once we have started very fast,

39:19.360 --> 39:40.960
then you will have to run fast then you will
have no time to quarrel.

39:40.960 --> 40:00.580
May God bless you

40:00.580 --> 40:44.710
Yogi: Om Shri (Radanna Pratini) Nirmala Devi
Ki Jai

40:44.710 --> 41:04.349
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.

41:04.349 --> 41:07.480
Thank you very much for celebrating this birthday
of mine.

41:07.480 --> 41:10.380
Thank you very much.

41:10.380 --> 41:15.810
Yogi: Thank you for coming on this Earth

41:15.810 --> 41:24.410
Shri Mataji: You see, according to Indian
(?), they count even the first day of birth,

41:24.410 --> 41:28.761
like if you have to say how many years you
have, according to them I am already 60 and

41:28.761 --> 41:44.940
I am going to be 61 and after 61 you can take
sanyasa, so it's a big freedom.

41:44.940 --> 42:02.920
Thank you very much to all

42:02.920 --> 42:11.910
Yogis: thank you
