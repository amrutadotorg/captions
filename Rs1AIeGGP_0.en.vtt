00:00:17.270 --> 00:01:43.100
Havan on the day of Puja to Shri Krishna as
Yogeshwara, 1982-08-15

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.300
Bahjan: Govinda Bolo

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.500
Child: what's happening?

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.500
…. Mother is coming.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Bahjan: Govinda Bolo

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Indistinct voices of children

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.720
Sahaja Children: questioning Shri Mataji [Marathi?]

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.830
Shri Mataji: [Marathi?]

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.640
Her blue sweater, just find out from Olympia's
Mother.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:13.390
…. [to the child] please sit there.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:24.700
Child: Did Olympia's mother come?

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.490
Shri Mataji: [Marathi?]

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:48.450
Today is the combination of Shri Krishna,
this one (is) his face and this is his dress.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:58.110
Ah, I think someone should go and find out
from...

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.470
Joan [Mother calls a Yogi].

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:20.140
Her sweater, her sweater is with … she said
she has given to Olympia her blue sweater.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.450
Light blue

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:35.910
Child: Light blue

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:56.890
Shri Mataji: What are the words, Vishnu's
names, in English.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:06.430
Better take it in English, better.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:15.970
(Mother talks to a baby-child [Marathi?].

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.330
Ah, better take her.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.460
Take the names.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.720
In English they are easy to take I think.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:43.880
Only the first, one should take them.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:55.319
Ah, does somebody has a shawl, [Marathi?]

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:04.800
Ne, it's alright.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:20.820
Actually we should have Rasaali (?) playing
with that, it would be nice, it doesn't matter.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.159
These are the names of Vishnu, because Vishnu
only achieved the status of Shri Krishna who

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:34.319
in his own life time expresses his complete
form of Virata.

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.699
Complete form of Virata.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:48.770
And this is a very good understanding, if
you know that you are also, start the dharma,

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.990
establish your Dharma and then you become
a witness, and then you become part and parcel

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.220
of the whole, the Virata.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.409
The same pattern takes place in you also,
in the evolutionary process.

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:03.800

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.280
you judge yourself, that's the best part.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:33.990
How much do you love, how much do you respect,
discipline, of Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:49.470
You have to sacrifice something for Sahaja
Yogis, is it?

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:55.630
Lets count how many things have you sacrificed
so far for Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:36:01.810
You have gained a lot, but you have to sacrifice.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:13.920
How much have you sacrificed for sahaja yoga,
you cant even sacrifice little comfort.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.960
All badas against sacrifice.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.020
Yogis: Om Swaha

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.400

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:30.000
Shri Mataji: All badas against wisdom

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.170
Yogis: Om Swaha

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:39.670
Shri Mataji: (? loving each other when there
is no ?) All badas against that

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.970
Yogis: Om Swaha

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:48.010
Shri Mataji: All badas against teasing your
Mother

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.390
Yogis: Om Swaha

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:56.760
Shri Mataji: I just want you to love each
other, that's all.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.270
Nothing else

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:03.060
Yogi: all badas against resentment and jealousy

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:09.390
Yogis: Om Swaha

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.870
Yogi: All badas of (?)

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:17.050
Yogis: Om Swaha

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:24.080
Shri Mataji: and also those who are organizing
should not be dominating.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.920
They should be understanding and should know
they must respect the freedom of everyone.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.109
It should be mutual, it should be no something
with a rod.

00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:39.480
Sahaja Yoga cannot be done through a rod,
but if someone is trying that, you better

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480
accept it for the time being.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:45.810
Is not good for the person who is trying such
thing, to be using the rod all the time.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:51.690
Try to have a reasonable attitude for everything,
reasonable, there is nothing to fight, there

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:57.400
is nothing to quarrel, there is nothing to
ahh... think that somebody is more dear to

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.940
me and somebody is not.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:02.750
You see, those who look dear maybe they are
not.

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:05.400
So don't do all that.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:10.550
Just try to be kind to each other, try to
understand, try to help, try to guide, somebody

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.850
has some weaknesses, all right, try to help
that person.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:17.099
If somebody has weaknesses, you should not
capitalize all that.

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:21.820
It should be worthy, but I can see (?) is
coming now.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:25.080
So I don't want miss the moment, I can feel
it, that's coming, no doubt.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:33.260
Some how I have a feeling now, and I have
seldom (felt ?) in my feelings.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:41.930
So some golden (age ?) I can see (along the
lines ?). I am sure something great is going

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:42.930
to happen.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.210
May God bless you for this day.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:52.711
It was a great day and the birth of Shri Krishna,
should be within us, within ourselves, so

00:38:52.711 --> 00:38:58.270
our Vishuddi should be all right balanced
witnessing and control our ego and superego

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:07.080
in such a manner that the Kundalini is kept
above on to a higher level, attention on to

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.780
a higher level.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:13.580
I think from today I'll stop calling you anymore.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:19.360
And I have a feeling now we have to go very
fast, and once we have started very fast,

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:40.960
then you will have to run fast then you will
have no time to quarrel.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:40:00.580
May God bless you

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:44.710
Yogi: Om Shri (Radanna Pratini) Nirmala Devi
Ki Jai

00:40:44.710 --> 00:41:04.349
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.

00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:07.480
Thank you very much for celebrating this birthday
of mine.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.380
Thank you very much.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:15.810
Yogi: Thank you for coming on this Earth

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:24.410
Shri Mataji: You see, according to Indian
(?), they count even the first day of birth,

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:28.761
like if you have to say how many years you
have, according to them I am already 60 and

00:41:28.761 --> 00:41:44.940
I am going to be 61 and after 61 you can take
sanyasa, so it's a big freedom.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:42:02.920
Thank you very much to all

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:11.910
Yogis: thank you
