04:48.682 --> 04:52.242
Today’s combination is very powerful.

04:54.902 --> 05:02.122
On the day of this special combination, which is called ‘Angaraki’-

05:02.802 --> 05:08.562
‘Angaraki Chaturthi’ is the ‘charturthi’ [fourth day of lunar month] of ‘Krishna Paksha’ [waning phase of the moon].

05:10.402 --> 05:14.342
On every ‘charturthi’ [fourth day] Shri Ganesha’s Birthday is celebrated.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.942
But if the ‘chaturthi’ falls on a Tuesday, it happens once in a while,

05:18.022 --> 05:21.642
sometimes once or sometimes twice or sometimes three times a year.

05:21.822 --> 05:27.262
If the ‘chaturthi’ falls on Tuesday then it is celebrated in a grand way.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.542
Today is the same ‘Yog’ [conjunction]

05:30.922 --> 05:35.602
where on a Tuesday, we are sitting here in Ganapati Pule

05:35.722 --> 05:41.082
where ‘Angaraki Yog’ is celebrated.

05:41.862 --> 05:47.702
Thousands of people come here to do the puja of Shri Ganesha.

05:48.042 --> 05:54.862
There was such a traffic jam that some sixty vehicles were in front,

05:55.102 --> 05:58.902
so we took a round-about road and came cause it’s no use going any faster.

05:59.022 --> 06:02.142
When something has to happen, it happens like this only.

06:04.602 --> 06:09.542
Till we understand this matter in Sahaja that whatever happens,

06:09.962 --> 06:12.862
we should watch it with patience.

06:13.402 --> 06:15.682
There should be patience.

06:16.262 --> 06:24.002
At that time if you hurry or if you become nervous,

06:24.302 --> 06:26.602
then the work will not happen.

06:26.842 --> 06:28.262
Have patience.

06:28.442 --> 06:33.582
Once you have patience, you will understand what to do and how to do.

06:34.322 --> 06:38.002
Rushing is against Sahaja.

06:38.462 --> 06:42.382
In Sahaja you should have patience.

06:42.602 --> 06:47.722
About this Sai Nath has told a lot – be patient.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.662
“Sai milat saburi mein” [you’ll find Sai in patience].

06:53.162 --> 06:58.482
The word ‘saburi’ [patience] is a bit inappropriate I feel.

06:59.122 --> 07:04.742
It means that when something is happening,

07:04.882 --> 07:10.222
you should forbear meaning waiting, watching.

07:10.842 --> 07:19.142
When there is forbearance then Paramchaitanya does the work

07:19.422 --> 07:24.942
and you will come to know exactly what to do.

07:25.042 --> 07:30.562
How to go about? What you should do? What path to take?

07:31.182 --> 07:35.702
But if you rush, then you will get stuck in your thoughts

07:35.782 --> 07:39.522
and run around here and there. You will not get what you want.

07:40.382 --> 07:44.122
Today there is one more Yoga [union],

07:44.702 --> 07:50.502
that it is also the birthday of Jesus Christ.

07:51.882 --> 07:58.322
I have told you several times that Jesus Christ is the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

08:00.162 --> 08:04.002
About this you have the proof also in Sahaja Yoga.

08:04.242 --> 08:06.522
Today being His [Shri Jesus Christ] birthday,

08:06.722 --> 08:11.642
today also being the Other’s [Shri Ganesha] birthday and today being a Tuesday;

08:11.682 --> 08:19.782
having such a great function and fireworks is a very big Yog [union].

08:19.922 --> 08:23.342
That we have come here to the place of Mahaganapati

08:23.502 --> 08:27.162
and are doing the puja of Mahavishnu.

08:30.882 --> 08:35.782
Now we have to understand the importance of Shri Ganesha.

08:36.302 --> 08:40.742
What is His significance that is expressed today?

08:41.502 --> 08:48.562
Like I had told you earlier, ‘vinay’, which is called humility.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.642
‘Namrata’ [humility] is His special quality.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.382
One more special quality is wisdom.

08:54.502 --> 09:02.502
I wasn’t getting an equivalent word in Marathi, they told Me the meaning of wisdom will be ‘subudhi’.

09:02.702 --> 09:04.542
O.K let us say ‘subudhi’.

09:06.282 --> 09:11.582
All these things are gifted by Ganesha’s principle.

09:12.522 --> 09:16.982
But then one more quality is that,

09:19.082 --> 09:26.082
He is a cool headed person.

09:26.662 --> 09:30.822
His walk is very cool. Like an elephant.

09:30.962 --> 09:36.002
In an elephant you see that it walks very slowly.

09:36.122 --> 09:41.282
The walk is so beautiful that if any lady walks nicely

09:41.442 --> 09:45.362
she’s called ‘gajagamini’, meaning she walks like an elephant.

09:45.842 --> 09:49.362
Slowly lifting the legs, thinking where to keep the foot

09:49.442 --> 09:53.242
o that no ant or animal comes under its feet.

09:53.322 --> 09:55.542
They walk taking care of these things.

09:55.622 --> 09:58.442
In the front they blow with their trunk while walking

09:58.602 --> 10:04.922
so that something that come in their way may not get destroyed.

10:05.202 --> 10:10.502
Secondly, they eat only grass. They are so strong eating only grass

10:10.682 --> 10:17.342
that wherever heavy work needs to be done, like carrying heavy load,

10:17.682 --> 10:20.102
there only elephants are used.

10:20.442 --> 10:29.282
The significant quality of elephant is also that they do thing slowly.

10:30.082 --> 10:32.682
They do not do anything hastily.

10:33.482 --> 10:44.502
And one more significant quality is that their memory is very strong.

10:44.782 --> 10:47.442
Even if they see a child in a young age,

10:47.522 --> 10:50.402
however old that person has grown, they recognize.

10:50.542 --> 10:54.502
In the same as on the left side because the working is of Shri Ganesha,

10:54.682 --> 11:00.062
you also know that when your left side becomes weak, your memory fails.

11:01.102 --> 11:05.982
That’s why we always raise the left side when the memory fails.

11:06.122 --> 11:09.502
The reason is the principle of Ganesha in you is reduced.

11:09.722 --> 11:15.702
When you become right sided, your left side Ganesha principle keeps reducing.

11:15.882 --> 11:19.262
Those people who work a lot, do this do that;

11:19.402 --> 11:22.662
their memory, you can see in their old age

11:22.842 --> 11:27.362
it becomes a question whether they will be able to recognize themselves or not.

11:27.622 --> 11:33.002
That’s why Shri Ganesha specialty is that wisdom is there

11:33.142 --> 11:38.062
but along with wisdom, His memory is excellent.

11:38.642 --> 11:42.122
He remembers everything. He has to remember.

11:42.222 --> 11:47.702
Because whatever is imprinted on the Kundalini, whatever written,

11:47.882 --> 11:50.962
all that is done by Shri Ganesha.

11:51.282 --> 11:55.002
He has a pen in His hand and He writes with His pen.

11:55.102 --> 11:57.262
The pen is one of His broken teeth.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.302
From that He writes what type of a person you are?

12:00.342 --> 12:04.722
What difficulties have you undergone? In your seeking where all you went?

12:04.762 --> 12:06.522
What mistakes did you do?

12:06.622 --> 12:09.102
Everything He writes in it [Kundalini].

12:09.962 --> 12:14.302
When the Kundalini begins to rise, like a tape recorder with problems squeaks,

12:14.482 --> 12:18.142
similarly you can see the squeaking of the Kundalini

12:18.302 --> 12:21.082
when She passes through your chakras.

12:21.322 --> 12:25.822
That’s how you come to know in the person this chakra is spoilt or that chakra is spoilt.

12:26.042 --> 12:29.302
This is absolutely classic scientific matter.

12:30.602 --> 12:33.382
So, there is not only one principle of Ganesha,

12:33.442 --> 12:36.862
that you stay chaste, be without sins.

12:37.482 --> 12:43.782
There are many principles and one of them is that there should be wisdom in you,

12:43.902 --> 12:45.962
there should be ‘subuddhi’ [wisdom] in you.

12:46.082 --> 12:49.442
You should know what is good and what is bad.

12:50.202 --> 12:54.842
What is the significance of today’s Angaraki,

12:55.002 --> 12:58.642
where special ‘Angarak Chaturthi’ is celebrated?

12:58.782 --> 13:04.922
The significance is that Shri Ganesha Himself cools down the ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal].

13:05.402 --> 13:09.582
If you see the Kundalini, It is also a type of fire.

13:09.802 --> 13:16.962
The mechanism of Kundalini is like flames.

13:17.162 --> 13:24.962
Because everything goes towards the Earth as you know cause of gravity,

13:25.042 --> 13:27.442
everything goes towards the Earth.

13:27.522 --> 13:31.842
Only this flame moves upwards.

13:32.042 --> 13:37.762
Any fire moves upwards and everything else towards the Earth.

13:38.002 --> 13:43.282
Upward movement is there only for fire.

13:43.442 --> 13:48.762
That is because He can cool down the fire in you.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.702
He cools down the fire in two ways.

13:53.042 --> 13:55.842
One – He cools the Kundalini.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.722
He tells the Kundalini that this person has these problems,

14:00.542 --> 14:03.902
but it is alright, you still please make him cross over [Realized].

14:04.002 --> 14:10.482
Because Kundalini’s child is Shri Ganesha and the child in you is Shri Ganesha,

14:10.882 --> 14:15.422
in the same friendliness, He persuades the Kundalini,

14:15.582 --> 14:19.942
“You are the Mother and I wish that I be awakened in this person.

14:20.142 --> 14:21.702
You help Me”.

14:21.862 --> 14:28.182
She becomes cool thinking that My child is asking this.

14:28.382 --> 14:34.962
So whatever the heat and problems in us cools down.

14:37.142 --> 14:41.442
Like you must have heard that once Devi became very angry

14:41.742 --> 14:46.782
and She saw that in the world many people are doing very wrong things.

14:47.042 --> 14:50.902
She was very troubled, very much in grief, She thought,

14:51.062 --> 14:54.382
“This entire Universe I have made, I shall destroy it”.

14:54.802 --> 15:00.382
Thinking like this She created destruction everywhere. She got very angry.

15:00.642 --> 15:04.782
When She started the dance [of destruction], Shri Mahadev thought,

15:04.982 --> 15:06.962
“Devi is angry, She is in action,

15:07.002 --> 15:10.522
now the world will be destroyed. What is the remedy?”

15:10.702 --> 15:16.082
So, what He did, He places Their Own Son Shri Kartikeya under Her feet.

15:16.222 --> 15:19.902
As soon as She stepped on the child, Her long tongue came out and She felt,

15:20.122 --> 15:21.002
“What am I doing?”

15:22.402 --> 15:27.042
The One who was so red with anger, on seeing the child She completely calmed down.

15:27.182 --> 15:36.062
In the same way He [Shri Ganesha] cools down our Kundalini that you are giving birth to Your child.

15:36.182 --> 15:38.922
At this point of time anger is not good. In the same way.

15:38.982 --> 15:41.882
Sometimes you would have troubled Kundalini so much

15:41.942 --> 15:46.222
that you went to wrong Gurus, we ourselves did something wrong.

15:46.322 --> 15:49.102
The poor Kundalini is shattered.

15:49.202 --> 15:53.962
Her support is Shri Ganesha Who pushes Her upwards.

15:54.782 --> 15:58.662
Kundalini can rise up only because of Shri Ganesha’s power.

15:58.902 --> 16:06.662
That is why He is called ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal] as He gives His power to the Kundalini.

16:06.822 --> 16:14.142
The fire in the Kundalini or the flames of Kundalini that rises are calm.

16:14.542 --> 16:18.762
You must have never heard that this kind of calm flames are also there.

16:18.922 --> 16:25.122
Very calm flames. They are of seven colours, but very calm.

16:25.282 --> 16:28.662
You see in the Sahasrara, how calm they are.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.982
All this work is done by Shri Ganesha.

16:33.702 --> 16:37.542
In a way, He can also bring down your anger.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.142
He can take away your anger.

16:46.442 --> 16:49.702
When we get angry, we get carried away.

16:49.962 --> 16:53.862
We don’t even remember what we should do and what we shouldn’t do.

16:54.102 --> 16:56.782
In that state we can hit someone, beat someone,

16:56.942 --> 16:59.522
even murder someone, anything we can do.

17:00.462 --> 17:04.462
The control that comes at that time comes from Shri Ganesha.

17:04.882 --> 17:07.862
Shri Ganesha cools down your anger.

17:09.102 --> 17:12.562
You see even Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] was similar.

17:12.702 --> 17:15.562
He told, “Forgive everyone.

17:16.162 --> 17:19.922
Whoever troubles you, you get angry with the person.

17:20.122 --> 17:24.282
But for once learn to forgive, forgive everyone”.

17:24.362 --> 17:31.562
For those people who insulted Him, troubled Him and put Him on the Cross,

17:31.782 --> 17:35.782
even for them He told His Father,

17:35.942 --> 17:43.022
“O Father, please forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing”.

17:45.262 --> 17:47.382
When Isa Masi [Jesus Christ] said that

17:47.502 --> 17:51.802
then think those people who crucified Him, troubled Him so much,

17:51.882 --> 17:54.982
even them He opted to forgive.

17:55.682 --> 17:59.442
This is one of His character, His nature.

17:59.582 --> 18:02.422
One more character of Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] –

18:02.602 --> 18:06.162
when people were sitting in front of the temple and selling things;

18:06.222 --> 18:09.542
like here also we have. When people go to temple,

18:09.642 --> 18:13.142
there they will be selling different thing, then they offer to God.

18:13.242 --> 18:16.762
Example – they offer a coconut to God then gain they get it out and sell.

18:16.922 --> 18:18.582
They make business out of it.

18:18.882 --> 18:21.942
Then He took a whip in His hand and whipped everyone saying,

18:22.162 --> 18:25.042
“You cannot do this business”.

18:25.382 --> 18:30.202
If you have to do, whatever is there it should be in a pure form.

18:30.602 --> 18:34.822
Not that you are offering to God and getting it out and selling it.

18:34.902 --> 18:38.622
ou offer Garland to God, then bring it out again and sell it.

18:38.782 --> 18:42.482
This type of thing, He said is absolutely wrong.

18:42.642 --> 18:47.742
He got so angry that He took a whip in His hand and started whipping everyone.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.902
This is His other side.

18:50.042 --> 18:53.182
Similarly, there is another side to Shri Ganesha also.

18:53.542 --> 18:55.822
The other side of Shri Ganesha is that,

18:55.982 --> 19:05.262
if any Rakshasa or evil troubles you or irritates you,

19:06.062 --> 19:11.022
He is Ganapati – meaning the King of Ganas,

19:12.182 --> 19:15.902
He destroys the rakshasas and evil people. He ruins them.

19:16.182 --> 19:18.762
He destroys them completely.

19:18.922 --> 19:24.342
You don’t have to tell Him anything. You need not inform.

19:24.422 --> 19:31.342
The Ganas are with you. They finish the people who try to trouble you.

19:31.882 --> 19:36.142
In Sahaja Yoga you remember that you are completely protected.

19:36.502 --> 19:41.502
No one can trouble you – only if you are in Sahaja Yoga.

19:41.842 --> 19:45.442
They, the Ganas are always around you in all directions.

19:45.582 --> 19:49.282
They have come here also.

19:52.662 --> 20:05.202
They have put the veil of protection on you, completely covered you.

20:05.742 --> 20:08.982
You will not face any troubles.

20:09.142 --> 20:12.162
Then you call it miracle. “Mother I don’t know how I was saved.

20:12.242 --> 20:15.142
I don’t know what happened and how I was suddenly saved”.

20:15.222 --> 20:16.862
All this is the work of Ganas.

20:16.982 --> 20:20.922
When Ganas do this work,

20:21.062 --> 20:24.382
then you understand that you really are a Sahaja Yogi.

20:24.482 --> 20:27.942
If they don’t do this work for you, then you have to understand

20:28.002 --> 20:30.842
that you have not yet become a complete Sahaja Yogi.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.502
One more thing about the Ganas is

20:34.082 --> 20:37.382
that They are all the time working in our body.

20:37.582 --> 20:43.322
The work that happens outside the body, is only when you are a Realized soul.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.102
When your connection is made with God,

20:46.202 --> 20:51.262
then they look after your body, your money and all your things,

20:51.402 --> 20:53.462
your kids are all looked after by them.

20:53.542 --> 20:57.762
Before that they live inside us as antibodies.

20:58.242 --> 21:02.842
And these antibodies are the ones who protect us from diseases

21:02.942 --> 21:05.762
and because of them we can fight diseases.

21:06.022 --> 21:11.202
This chakra in the center heart, here is a bone called sternum bone.

21:11.282 --> 21:15.482
Till twelve years the antibodies are prepared

21:15.602 --> 21:18.642
and they move around all over the body and are ready.

21:18.762 --> 21:23.622
Whenever there is a problem, sternum starts shaking and as soon as it shakes,

21:23.782 --> 21:26.922
like there is a remote control, like that they come to know.

21:27.022 --> 21:34.622
And the person coming and attacking you, or anything attacking

21:34.782 --> 21:42.102
or any virus is there or any type of disease entering your body, they fight with them.

21:43.042 --> 21:46.382
But when you go against the Mother,

21:46.902 --> 21:51.262
going against the Mother means losing your morality, falling in virtue.

21:51.402 --> 21:54.322
Going against the Father means

21:54.442 --> 22:01.842
that you are not working, you are not acting, you become lazy.

22:01.902 --> 22:03.842
This is the sin against the Father.

22:04.022 --> 22:08.222
But sin against the Mother is when you lose your morality.

22:08.622 --> 22:14.222
Those who have lost their chastity, their [center heart] becomes very weak.

22:14.522 --> 22:19.462
That is why it becomes very difficult to set this chakra all right.

22:19.582 --> 22:25.142
And the people to fall like this, them becoming all right is difficult.

22:25.222 --> 22:26.962
Like AIDS disease.

22:27.102 --> 22:31.622
Such kind of diseases that we call venereal diseases.

22:31.702 --> 22:34.422
All these venereal diseases come from immorality.

22:34.542 --> 22:38.662
And diseases caused by immorality cannot be cured

22:38.782 --> 22:41.602
till your Ganesha principle becomes alright.

22:43.702 --> 22:45.402
That why we should understand

22:45.502 --> 22:53.082
that we should stay away from immoral behavior.

22:53.162 --> 22:59.002
We should keep our personality, our entire life away from immorality.

22:59.102 --> 23:03.722
We should always be drowned in chastity.

23:04.902 --> 23:10.102
Regarding chastity Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has said something very great.

23:10.242 --> 23:12.602
Because His place is in Agyna chakra,

23:12.842 --> 23:15.722
He has told a very great thing about Agnya

23:15.942 --> 23:22.442
that even in your eyes there should not be anything unchaste –

23:22.602 --> 23:25.282
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

23:25.522 --> 23:29.022
Even the eyes should be such that it should be pure.

23:29.502 --> 23:33.782
If the eyes are not pure, then Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] is not there.

23:34.442 --> 23:36.962
But if you see in foreign nationals,

23:37.142 --> 23:40.802
we see that those who believe in Isa [Jesus Christ], they have bad eyes.

23:40.882 --> 23:43.422
Looking at this woman, looking at that lady.

23:43.602 --> 23:45.862
Then even the woman are looking at the men.

23:46.062 --> 23:49.442
Eyes are always roving. The eyes are never steady.

23:50.302 --> 23:55.982
Once this goes on, the dead spirits, move from the eyes.

23:56.162 --> 24:00.682
Once they [dead spirits] go into one person, then they [dead spirits] go to another.

24:00.842 --> 24:06.042
It is such a play that there is no enjoyment in that and the play keeps going on

24:06.162 --> 24:08.862
and the person goes mad in this.

24:10.242 --> 24:13.882
Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has told a very sensitive thing about morality

24:14.082 --> 24:16.882
that even your eyes should not be immoral.

24:17.042 --> 24:21.142
You cannot even look at another person with immoral eyes.

24:21.262 --> 24:28.482
This thing He told, there is a complete verse on chastity.

24:28.782 --> 24:32.002
Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has only talked about chastity.

24:32.202 --> 24:37.402
Whenever He has spoken is mostly about how one can keep oneself chaste.

24:37.502 --> 24:40.302
How you can stand on morality.

24:41.382 --> 24:45.082
So, in Sahaja Yoga everything takes place in a Sahaj [natural] way

24:45.182 --> 24:48.442
when you completely accept Shri Ganesha

24:48.622 --> 24:52.582
and accept that this Shakti [power] should come to us.

24:53.142 --> 24:56.362
As such Shri Ganesha’s place is there on every chakra.

24:56.502 --> 25:00.942
That’s why I always tell you that on every chakra, a Vice Chancellor is seated.

25:01.062 --> 25:06.102
Chancellor Sir is seated and till the time He certifies, Kundalini will not rise.

25:06.162 --> 25:08.962
And He works on every chakra.

25:09.482 --> 25:12.382
So, as I was telling about today’s Yog [conjuction],

25:12.462 --> 25:16.242
that His second nature is that He is ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal].

25:16.342 --> 25:21.202
This ‘angaar’ can be cooled down with ‘angaar’.

25:22.482 --> 25:25.122
It can be cooled completely.

25:25.282 --> 25:37.342
Like you have seen when Ravan spoke against Shri Rama,

25:38.042 --> 25:40.442
then Lanka caught fire.

25:41.722 --> 25:49.842
Hanumanji is also born on Tuesday and He has nine great powers.

25:50.102 --> 25:54.722
Both of them together work like this.

25:55.082 --> 25:58.562
Especially if there is anger in a person,

26:00.082 --> 26:04.862
then how to cool that anger Shri Ganesha knows that.

26:05.202 --> 26:14.642
Then He does such actions, such tricks that that person is defeated completely

26:14.822 --> 26:19.462
and accepts, “I have made a mistake, I should not have done that”.

26:20.422 --> 26:24.782
So, when heated people are there, He can make then also all right.

26:24.882 --> 26:35.062
That’s why if someone has ‘mangli’ [born on Tuesday], they should wear coral.

26:35.222 --> 26:41.482
Coral is also heating. Heat is removed by heat.

26:42.082 --> 26:47.102
If you see in countries where the heat is more, people eat more chilies.

26:47.262 --> 26:53.722
Wherever you go. If you go to India, South India food is so spicy

26:53.842 --> 26:55.342
that you cannot eat.

26:55.522 --> 27:03.122
Also, in China, south China – Cantone etc., lot of chilies are eaten.

27:03.382 --> 27:09.282
In the same way in Italy – in the south. In France – in the South they eat a lot of chilies.

27:09.682 --> 27:14.602
Why do they eat? Because chilies remove spice, heat removes heat.

27:14.962 --> 27:20.762
That’s why they eat chili, so that they sweat a lot and remain cool.

27:21.442 --> 27:26.242
In the same way Shri Ganesha also sets right your heat from His heat.

27:26.622 --> 27:37.062
Like this He shows his anger [greatness] cause of which you yourself cool down.

27:37.742 --> 27:43.982
In all these diseases lot of heat is generated

27:44.042 --> 27:48.482
and the person becomes delirious cause of the heat.

27:48.882 --> 27:52.462
It is right that we treat this heat –

27:52.542 --> 27:59.682
do puja of Shri Ganesha and we should be specially surrendered to Him.

27:59.902 --> 28:04.582
Today I feel is a great conjunction that these three things have fallen on the same day;

28:04.722 --> 28:07.462
that today is the birthday of Isa Masih [Jesus Christ],

28:07.622 --> 28:11.162
today is Tuesday and today is also the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

28:11.322 --> 28:14.022
And all of you have come to Ganapatipule.

28:14.182 --> 28:20.362
Everything has happened in such a way naturally

28:20.522 --> 28:23.522
that it feels like a miracle has taken place.

28:23.682 --> 28:26.062
A very big miracle that all have come.

28:26.322 --> 28:31.122
But due to that there was a problem that the crowd was so much

28:31.242 --> 28:33.722
that we got stuck in traffic jam and it got late.

28:33.822 --> 28:37.802
But delay or anything that happens, is a matter of patience.

28:37.962 --> 28:43.042
I always think whatever time is fixed for us the puja will happen only at that time.

28:43.362 --> 28:45.222
It cannot take place before that.

28:45.362 --> 28:50.822
Why try to change the destiny? What is the use of fighting with it?

28:51.042 --> 28:55.302
Whatever is, it is. Whenever the puja has to take place it will.

28:55.502 --> 28:59.702
In that if you start, puja is not taking place, this was the time.

28:59.822 --> 29:04.482
We are not slaves of the clock. But there are so many advantages of this.

29:04.662 --> 29:10.662
You will come to know in future that if you don’t do servitude of time,

29:10.942 --> 29:12.982
Sahaja Yoga can be spread very much.

29:13.542 --> 29:16.862
But the person who is time bound, he can never spread Sahaja Yoga.

29:16.982 --> 29:20.782
He keeps thinking, “At this time I have to do this”, “At that time you have to do that”.

29:20.902 --> 29:23.402
Such a person does not have time for Sahaja Yoga.

29:23.502 --> 29:28.222
But the person who says, “He has to do Sahaja Yoga” – entire time is available for him.

29:28.342 --> 29:31.182
Everything happens very nicely.

29:31.262 --> 29:38.382
Only thing is you should have the experience and after experience you should have faith.

29:39.582 --> 29:45.842
So many things happen. Many people tell Me their miracles from morning till evening.

29:46.122 --> 29:50.342
“Mother I was worried, I am going, when I’ll meet? When she’ll come?

29:50.422 --> 29:53.762
But saw the person walking in front of me”.

29:54.982 --> 30:00.962
Whatever desire that comes to your mind can be fulfilled. It is a matter of faith.

30:01.142 --> 30:05.782
By faith, there is no blind faith in Sahaja Yoga. There’s absolutely no blind faith.

30:05.862 --> 30:09.042
There is faith where you see everything with your own eyes.

30:09.202 --> 30:13.462
After seeing everything if you don’t believe, what can you say for that?

30:13.662 --> 30:21.582
It can be said that you are very untruthful or you lie or you are stupid.

30:21.682 --> 30:23.382
These three things are possible.

30:23.502 --> 30:28.242
You are seeing everything, you are understanding that things are taking place.

30:28.382 --> 30:33.202
After that also you do not believe, then there is something wrong with you.

30:34.862 --> 30:40.182
On seeing all this you can think how dynamic Shri Ganesha is.

30:40.722 --> 30:44.502
In Maharashtra there are eight ‘Ashtavinayak’ [8 Ganeshas]

30:44.642 --> 30:50.322
because of which Maharashtra has received a lot of blessings.

30:50.622 --> 30:55.102
But still people are so mad that they keep running after these things.

30:55.322 --> 31:00.942
They go on doing these things that they get stuck in rituals but do not achieve the truth.

31:01.442 --> 31:07.962
Now you people are lucky, are intelligent that you sought the truth and achieved it.

31:08.362 --> 31:13.762
Now to achieve this you have to imbibe the characteristics of Shri Ganesha.

31:14.002 --> 31:17.922
I was seeing thousands of people have come for Shri Ganesha’s puja.

31:18.302 --> 31:22.142
Among them, who are His believers,

31:22.322 --> 31:26.622
how many people have his qualities? I could not see anyone.

31:27.442 --> 31:32.922
They drink alcohol, fight among each other, ill-treat women and trouble them

31:33.002 --> 31:35.942
and then go for ‘Angarika’ of Shri Ganesha.

31:36.042 --> 31:40.022
When you are such an ‘angaar’ [hot tempered person], then why have to come here?

31:40.162 --> 31:43.542
Nobody thinks that if we believe in someone,

31:43.662 --> 31:46.042
how many of the qualities of them have we imbibed?

31:46.122 --> 31:50.182
“We have a lot of beliefs, we do puja of this [God] and we do puja of them [God]”.

31:50.242 --> 31:54.282
Ok then how many qualities [of the God] have you got? Nobody thinks like that.

31:55.782 --> 31:59.982
But the truth is if you believe in someone,

32:00.082 --> 32:05.002
then you should imbibe their qualities.Till you develop those qualities,

32:05.142 --> 32:09.622
you believe or not believe is the same, doesn’t make any difference.

32:11.282 --> 32:13.862
Today we are doing the puja of Shri Ganesha.

32:13.962 --> 32:16.602
There will be puja of Shri Ganesha and Gauri.

32:16.802 --> 32:21.362
You will need to understand that Gauri is the Kundalini.

32:21.482 --> 32:23.942
Mahakundalini is Mahagauri.

32:24.122 --> 32:34.182
Her work is that Her child who has been seeking for many years,

32:34.322 --> 32:36.882
give him Self Realisation.

32:37.442 --> 32:39.502
Give the child re-birth.

32:39.742 --> 32:44.042
This is the work of Mahagauri Who is residing in all of you.

32:44.242 --> 32:50.542
That’s why today we’ll do the puja of Ganeshji and Gauriji, later Devi puja.

32:51.722 --> 32:53.802
Many blessing to all.

33:01.342 --> 33:05.362
In short, I told them what is so special about today,

33:05.562 --> 33:09.022
tonight, is the time when, this is Tuesday,

33:09.542 --> 33:11.642
on Tuesday Shri Ganesha was born.

33:12.062 --> 33:18.602
So they celebrate every fourth day of the moon

33:18.762 --> 33:21.762
as the Shri Ganesha’s birth date

33:21.782 --> 33:23.682
because He was born on the fourth.

33:23.922 --> 33:27.442
But when this fourth falls on a Tuesday

33:27.642 --> 33:30.702
then they think it’s a tremendous yoga,

33:30.842 --> 33:33.862
because on Tuesday He was born.

33:34.162 --> 33:40.582
On Tuesday, this fourth of the month has come,

33:40.742 --> 33:45.242
so they just try to worship it as a something special day.

33:45.782 --> 33:49.542
Now I also told them what is the quality of Shri Ganesha,

33:49.682 --> 33:51.182
which we see in Christ

33:51.222 --> 33:53.942
and as Christ is the Incarnation of Shri Ganesha,

33:53.982 --> 33:57.962
today remarkable thing is that the third yoga is

33:58.102 --> 34:01.102
that today is the birthday of Christ.

34:02.042 --> 34:04.642
And the fourth thing, which is very important,

34:04.742 --> 34:08.902
is that you all should be here on such-and-such day on Ganapatipule.

34:10.502 --> 34:14.342
So it’s very important day and that’s how we have to learn

34:14.402 --> 34:17.622
that if you worship Ganapati or if you worship Christ,

34:17.742 --> 34:21.402
we should try to think what qualities we have got within ourselves.

34:24.582 --> 34:29.402
Now regarding Jesus Christ – you know Him very well –

34:29.542 --> 34:32.662
that He always talked of morality,

34:33.042 --> 34:37.262
always talked of holiness,

34:37.402 --> 34:40.282
of auspiciousness.

34:40.582 --> 34:47.482
And all these things, you see, the holiness and the complete

34:49.342 --> 34:52.502
cleanliness within your being

34:52.922 --> 34:55.702
is to such an extent that, I said, He said that,

34:55.782 --> 34:58.542
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

34:58.782 --> 35:03.122
So Shri Ganesha also was against the adultery.

35:03.362 --> 35:06.522
Any kind of adultery He was against

35:06.622 --> 35:10.762
and that’s why those people who indulge into adulterous life suffer,

35:10.962 --> 35:12.422
suffer very badly.

35:12.422 --> 35:14.542
It’s rather difficult to cure them.

35:14.962 --> 35:18.602
All these diseases which are incurable of Ganesha’s problems

35:18.722 --> 35:20.902
are really difficult, because

35:21.142 --> 35:23.122
here you have insulted Shri Ganesha

35:23.242 --> 35:26.142
and that’s why He gets angry with you.

35:26.462 --> 35:30.062
Now, His style is of two type(s).

35:30.122 --> 35:34.162
One is by which He soothes you down, He soothes your Kundalini

35:34.162 --> 35:37.902
and the second one is where He really gets angry with you

35:38.002 --> 35:40.042
and tries to punish you.

35:41.102 --> 35:44.862
These two qualities here, so one has to be very careful

35:44.982 --> 35:47.582
when you are dealing with your morality.

35:48.122 --> 35:51.062
The morality should be a part and parcel of your being.

35:51.162 --> 35:53.562
That you should be proud that you are moral

35:53.622 --> 35:56.522
and that you should try to lead a very moral life

35:56.602 --> 35:59.662
without torturing anybody, without troubling anybody.

36:00.142 --> 36:02.982
In Sahaja Yoga, I hope it is all very clear cut

36:03.222 --> 36:06.202
that we have to lead a very, very moral life.

36:06.402 --> 36:09.082
Of course, all My lecture can be translated later

36:09.162 --> 36:10.922
and I hope you’ll be able to enjoy it.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.622
But this is the best part of it,

36:12.722 --> 36:16.102
that today we have the birthday of Christ,

36:16.222 --> 36:18.042
the birthday of Shri Ganesha

36:18.222 --> 36:20.502
and also on such a date

36:20.642 --> 36:26.522
which is so well-worshipped and regarded as something important in India.

36:27.942 --> 36:29.522
May God bless you all!
