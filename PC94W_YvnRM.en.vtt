00:04:48.682 --> 00:04:52.242
Today’s combination is very powerful.

00:04:54.902 --> 00:05:02.122
On the day of this special combination, which is called ‘Angaraki’-

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:08.562
‘Angaraki Chaturthi’ is the ‘charturthi’ [fourth day of lunar month] of ‘Krishna Paksha’ [waning phase of the moon].

00:05:10.402 --> 00:05:14.342
On every ‘charturthi’ [fourth day] Shri Ganesha’s Birthday is celebrated.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:17.942
But if the ‘chaturthi’ falls on a Tuesday, it happens once in a while,

00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:21.642
sometimes once or sometimes twice or sometimes three times a year.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:27.262
If the ‘chaturthi’ falls on Tuesday then it is celebrated in a grand way.

00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:30.542
Today is the same ‘Yog’ [conjunction]

00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:35.602
where on a Tuesday, we are sitting here in Ganapati Pule

00:05:35.722 --> 00:05:41.082
where ‘Angaraki Yog’ is celebrated.

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:47.702
Thousands of people come here to do the puja of Shri Ganesha.

00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:54.862
There was such a traffic jam that some sixty vehicles were in front,

00:05:55.102 --> 00:05:58.902
so we took a round-about road and came cause it’s no use going any faster.

00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:02.142
When something has to happen, it happens like this only.

00:06:04.602 --> 00:06:09.542
Till we understand this matter in Sahaja that whatever happens,

00:06:09.962 --> 00:06:12.862
we should watch it with patience.

00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:15.682
There should be patience.

00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:24.002
At that time if you hurry or if you become nervous,

00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:26.602
then the work will not happen.

00:06:26.842 --> 00:06:28.262
Have patience.

00:06:28.442 --> 00:06:33.582
Once you have patience, you will understand what to do and how to do.

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:38.002
Rushing is against Sahaja.

00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:42.382
In Sahaja you should have patience.

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:47.722
About this Sai Nath has told a lot – be patient.

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:51.662
“Sai milat saburi mein” [you’ll find Sai in patience].

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:58.482
The word ‘saburi’ [patience] is a bit inappropriate I feel.

00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:04.742
It means that when something is happening,

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:10.222
you should forbear meaning waiting, watching.

00:07:10.842 --> 00:07:19.142
When there is forbearance then Paramchaitanya does the work

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:24.942
and you will come to know exactly what to do.

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:30.562
How to go about? What you should do? What path to take?

00:07:31.182 --> 00:07:35.702
But if you rush, then you will get stuck in your thoughts

00:07:35.782 --> 00:07:39.522
and run around here and there. You will not get what you want.

00:07:40.382 --> 00:07:44.122
Today there is one more Yoga [union],

00:07:44.702 --> 00:07:50.502
that it is also the birthday of Jesus Christ.

00:07:51.882 --> 00:07:58.322
I have told you several times that Jesus Christ is the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:08:00.162 --> 00:08:04.002
About this you have the proof also in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:06.522
Today being His [Shri Jesus Christ] birthday,

00:08:06.722 --> 00:08:11.642
today also being the Other’s [Shri Ganesha] birthday and today being a Tuesday;

00:08:11.682 --> 00:08:19.782
having such a great function and fireworks is a very big Yog [union].

00:08:19.922 --> 00:08:23.342
That we have come here to the place of Mahaganapati

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:27.162
and are doing the puja of Mahavishnu.

00:08:30.882 --> 00:08:35.782
Now we have to understand the importance of Shri Ganesha.

00:08:36.302 --> 00:08:40.742
What is His significance that is expressed today?

00:08:41.502 --> 00:08:48.562
Like I had told you earlier, ‘vinay’, which is called humility.

00:08:48.702 --> 00:08:51.642
‘Namrata’ [humility] is His special quality.

00:08:51.922 --> 00:08:54.382
One more special quality is wisdom.

00:08:54.502 --> 00:09:02.502
I wasn’t getting an equivalent word in Marathi, they told Me the meaning of wisdom will be ‘subudhi’.

00:09:02.702 --> 00:09:04.542
O.K let us say ‘subudhi’.

00:09:06.282 --> 00:09:11.582
All these things are gifted by Ganesha’s principle.

00:09:12.522 --> 00:09:16.982
But then one more quality is that,

00:09:19.082 --> 00:09:26.082
He is a cool headed person.

00:09:26.662 --> 00:09:30.822
His walk is very cool. Like an elephant.

00:09:30.962 --> 00:09:36.002
In an elephant you see that it walks very slowly.

00:09:36.122 --> 00:09:41.282
The walk is so beautiful that if any lady walks nicely

00:09:41.442 --> 00:09:45.362
she’s called ‘gajagamini’, meaning she walks like an elephant.

00:09:45.842 --> 00:09:49.362
Slowly lifting the legs, thinking where to keep the foot

00:09:49.442 --> 00:09:53.242
o that no ant or animal comes under its feet.

00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:55.542
They walk taking care of these things.

00:09:55.622 --> 00:09:58.442
In the front they blow with their trunk while walking

00:09:58.602 --> 00:10:04.922
so that something that come in their way may not get destroyed.

00:10:05.202 --> 00:10:10.502
Secondly, they eat only grass. They are so strong eating only grass

00:10:10.682 --> 00:10:17.342
that wherever heavy work needs to be done, like carrying heavy load,

00:10:17.682 --> 00:10:20.102
there only elephants are used.

00:10:20.442 --> 00:10:29.282
The significant quality of elephant is also that they do thing slowly.

00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:32.682
They do not do anything hastily.

00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:44.502
And one more significant quality is that their memory is very strong.

00:10:44.782 --> 00:10:47.442
Even if they see a child in a young age,

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.402
however old that person has grown, they recognize.

00:10:50.542 --> 00:10:54.502
In the same as on the left side because the working is of Shri Ganesha,

00:10:54.682 --> 00:11:00.062
you also know that when your left side becomes weak, your memory fails.

00:11:01.102 --> 00:11:05.982
That’s why we always raise the left side when the memory fails.

00:11:06.122 --> 00:11:09.502
The reason is the principle of Ganesha in you is reduced.

00:11:09.722 --> 00:11:15.702
When you become right sided, your left side Ganesha principle keeps reducing.

00:11:15.882 --> 00:11:19.262
Those people who work a lot, do this do that;

00:11:19.402 --> 00:11:22.662
their memory, you can see in their old age

00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:27.362
it becomes a question whether they will be able to recognize themselves or not.

00:11:27.622 --> 00:11:33.002
That’s why Shri Ganesha specialty is that wisdom is there

00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:38.062
but along with wisdom, His memory is excellent.

00:11:38.642 --> 00:11:42.122
He remembers everything. He has to remember.

00:11:42.222 --> 00:11:47.702
Because whatever is imprinted on the Kundalini, whatever written,

00:11:47.882 --> 00:11:50.962
all that is done by Shri Ganesha.

00:11:51.282 --> 00:11:55.002
He has a pen in His hand and He writes with His pen.

00:11:55.102 --> 00:11:57.262
The pen is one of His broken teeth.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:00.302
From that He writes what type of a person you are?

00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:04.722
What difficulties have you undergone? In your seeking where all you went?

00:12:04.762 --> 00:12:06.522
What mistakes did you do?

00:12:06.622 --> 00:12:09.102
Everything He writes in it [Kundalini].

00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:14.302
When the Kundalini begins to rise, like a tape recorder with problems squeaks,

00:12:14.482 --> 00:12:18.142
similarly you can see the squeaking of the Kundalini

00:12:18.302 --> 00:12:21.082
when She passes through your chakras.

00:12:21.322 --> 00:12:25.822
That’s how you come to know in the person this chakra is spoilt or that chakra is spoilt.

00:12:26.042 --> 00:12:29.302
This is absolutely classic scientific matter.

00:12:30.602 --> 00:12:33.382
So, there is not only one principle of Ganesha,

00:12:33.442 --> 00:12:36.862
that you stay chaste, be without sins.

00:12:37.482 --> 00:12:43.782
There are many principles and one of them is that there should be wisdom in you,

00:12:43.902 --> 00:12:45.962
there should be ‘subuddhi’ [wisdom] in you.

00:12:46.082 --> 00:12:49.442
You should know what is good and what is bad.

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:54.842
What is the significance of today’s Angaraki,

00:12:55.002 --> 00:12:58.642
where special ‘Angarak Chaturthi’ is celebrated?

00:12:58.782 --> 00:13:04.922
The significance is that Shri Ganesha Himself cools down the ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal].

00:13:05.402 --> 00:13:09.582
If you see the Kundalini, It is also a type of fire.

00:13:09.802 --> 00:13:16.962
The mechanism of Kundalini is like flames.

00:13:17.162 --> 00:13:24.962
Because everything goes towards the Earth as you know cause of gravity,

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:27.442
everything goes towards the Earth.

00:13:27.522 --> 00:13:31.842
Only this flame moves upwards.

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:37.762
Any fire moves upwards and everything else towards the Earth.

00:13:38.002 --> 00:13:43.282
Upward movement is there only for fire.

00:13:43.442 --> 00:13:48.762
That is because He can cool down the fire in you.

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:52.702
He cools down the fire in two ways.

00:13:53.042 --> 00:13:55.842
One – He cools the Kundalini.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.722
He tells the Kundalini that this person has these problems,

00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:03.902
but it is alright, you still please make him cross over [Realized].

00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:10.482
Because Kundalini’s child is Shri Ganesha and the child in you is Shri Ganesha,

00:14:10.882 --> 00:14:15.422
in the same friendliness, He persuades the Kundalini,

00:14:15.582 --> 00:14:19.942
“You are the Mother and I wish that I be awakened in this person.

00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:21.702
You help Me”.

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:28.182
She becomes cool thinking that My child is asking this.

00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:34.962
So whatever the heat and problems in us cools down.

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:41.442
Like you must have heard that once Devi became very angry

00:14:41.742 --> 00:14:46.782
and She saw that in the world many people are doing very wrong things.

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:50.902
She was very troubled, very much in grief, She thought,

00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:54.382
“This entire Universe I have made, I shall destroy it”.

00:14:54.802 --> 00:15:00.382
Thinking like this She created destruction everywhere. She got very angry.

00:15:00.642 --> 00:15:04.782
When She started the dance [of destruction], Shri Mahadev thought,

00:15:04.982 --> 00:15:06.962
“Devi is angry, She is in action,

00:15:07.002 --> 00:15:10.522
now the world will be destroyed. What is the remedy?”

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:16.082
So, what He did, He places Their Own Son Shri Kartikeya under Her feet.

00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:19.902
As soon as She stepped on the child, Her long tongue came out and She felt,

00:15:20.122 --> 00:15:21.002
“What am I doing?”

00:15:22.402 --> 00:15:27.042
The One who was so red with anger, on seeing the child She completely calmed down.

00:15:27.182 --> 00:15:36.062
In the same way He [Shri Ganesha] cools down our Kundalini that you are giving birth to Your child.

00:15:36.182 --> 00:15:38.922
At this point of time anger is not good. In the same way.

00:15:38.982 --> 00:15:41.882
Sometimes you would have troubled Kundalini so much

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:46.222
that you went to wrong Gurus, we ourselves did something wrong.

00:15:46.322 --> 00:15:49.102
The poor Kundalini is shattered.

00:15:49.202 --> 00:15:53.962
Her support is Shri Ganesha Who pushes Her upwards.

00:15:54.782 --> 00:15:58.662
Kundalini can rise up only because of Shri Ganesha’s power.

00:15:58.902 --> 00:16:06.662
That is why He is called ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal] as He gives His power to the Kundalini.

00:16:06.822 --> 00:16:14.142
The fire in the Kundalini or the flames of Kundalini that rises are calm.

00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:18.762
You must have never heard that this kind of calm flames are also there.

00:16:18.922 --> 00:16:25.122
Very calm flames. They are of seven colours, but very calm.

00:16:25.282 --> 00:16:28.662
You see in the Sahasrara, how calm they are.

00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:31.982
All this work is done by Shri Ganesha.

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:37.542
In a way, He can also bring down your anger.

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:46.142
He can take away your anger.

00:16:46.442 --> 00:16:49.702
When we get angry, we get carried away.

00:16:49.962 --> 00:16:53.862
We don’t even remember what we should do and what we shouldn’t do.

00:16:54.102 --> 00:16:56.782
In that state we can hit someone, beat someone,

00:16:56.942 --> 00:16:59.522
even murder someone, anything we can do.

00:17:00.462 --> 00:17:04.462
The control that comes at that time comes from Shri Ganesha.

00:17:04.882 --> 00:17:07.862
Shri Ganesha cools down your anger.

00:17:09.102 --> 00:17:12.562
You see even Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] was similar.

00:17:12.702 --> 00:17:15.562
He told, “Forgive everyone.

00:17:16.162 --> 00:17:19.922
Whoever troubles you, you get angry with the person.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:24.282
But for once learn to forgive, forgive everyone”.

00:17:24.362 --> 00:17:31.562
For those people who insulted Him, troubled Him and put Him on the Cross,

00:17:31.782 --> 00:17:35.782
even for them He told His Father,

00:17:35.942 --> 00:17:43.022
“O Father, please forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing”.

00:17:45.262 --> 00:17:47.382
When Isa Masi [Jesus Christ] said that

00:17:47.502 --> 00:17:51.802
then think those people who crucified Him, troubled Him so much,

00:17:51.882 --> 00:17:54.982
even them He opted to forgive.

00:17:55.682 --> 00:17:59.442
This is one of His character, His nature.

00:17:59.582 --> 00:18:02.422
One more character of Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] –

00:18:02.602 --> 00:18:06.162
when people were sitting in front of the temple and selling things;

00:18:06.222 --> 00:18:09.542
like here also we have. When people go to temple,

00:18:09.642 --> 00:18:13.142
there they will be selling different thing, then they offer to God.

00:18:13.242 --> 00:18:16.762
Example – they offer a coconut to God then gain they get it out and sell.

00:18:16.922 --> 00:18:18.582
They make business out of it.

00:18:18.882 --> 00:18:21.942
Then He took a whip in His hand and whipped everyone saying,

00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:25.042
“You cannot do this business”.

00:18:25.382 --> 00:18:30.202
If you have to do, whatever is there it should be in a pure form.

00:18:30.602 --> 00:18:34.822
Not that you are offering to God and getting it out and selling it.

00:18:34.902 --> 00:18:38.622
ou offer Garland to God, then bring it out again and sell it.

00:18:38.782 --> 00:18:42.482
This type of thing, He said is absolutely wrong.

00:18:42.642 --> 00:18:47.742
He got so angry that He took a whip in His hand and started whipping everyone.

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:49.902
This is His other side.

00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:53.182
Similarly, there is another side to Shri Ganesha also.

00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:55.822
The other side of Shri Ganesha is that,

00:18:55.982 --> 00:19:05.262
if any Rakshasa or evil troubles you or irritates you,

00:19:06.062 --> 00:19:11.022
He is Ganapati – meaning the King of Ganas,

00:19:12.182 --> 00:19:15.902
He destroys the rakshasas and evil people. He ruins them.

00:19:16.182 --> 00:19:18.762
He destroys them completely.

00:19:18.922 --> 00:19:24.342
You don’t have to tell Him anything. You need not inform.

00:19:24.422 --> 00:19:31.342
The Ganas are with you. They finish the people who try to trouble you.

00:19:31.882 --> 00:19:36.142
In Sahaja Yoga you remember that you are completely protected.

00:19:36.502 --> 00:19:41.502
No one can trouble you – only if you are in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:41.842 --> 00:19:45.442
They, the Ganas are always around you in all directions.

00:19:45.582 --> 00:19:49.282
They have come here also.

00:19:52.662 --> 00:20:05.202
They have put the veil of protection on you, completely covered you.

00:20:05.742 --> 00:20:08.982
You will not face any troubles.

00:20:09.142 --> 00:20:12.162
Then you call it miracle. “Mother I don’t know how I was saved.

00:20:12.242 --> 00:20:15.142
I don’t know what happened and how I was suddenly saved”.

00:20:15.222 --> 00:20:16.862
All this is the work of Ganas.

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:20.922
When Ganas do this work,

00:20:21.062 --> 00:20:24.382
then you understand that you really are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:24.482 --> 00:20:27.942
If they don’t do this work for you, then you have to understand

00:20:28.002 --> 00:20:30.842
that you have not yet become a complete Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:31.022 --> 00:20:33.502
One more thing about the Ganas is

00:20:34.082 --> 00:20:37.382
that They are all the time working in our body.

00:20:37.582 --> 00:20:43.322
The work that happens outside the body, is only when you are a Realized soul.

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:46.102
When your connection is made with God,

00:20:46.202 --> 00:20:51.262
then they look after your body, your money and all your things,

00:20:51.402 --> 00:20:53.462
your kids are all looked after by them.

00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:57.762
Before that they live inside us as antibodies.

00:20:58.242 --> 00:21:02.842
And these antibodies are the ones who protect us from diseases

00:21:02.942 --> 00:21:05.762
and because of them we can fight diseases.

00:21:06.022 --> 00:21:11.202
This chakra in the center heart, here is a bone called sternum bone.

00:21:11.282 --> 00:21:15.482
Till twelve years the antibodies are prepared

00:21:15.602 --> 00:21:18.642
and they move around all over the body and are ready.

00:21:18.762 --> 00:21:23.622
Whenever there is a problem, sternum starts shaking and as soon as it shakes,

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.922
like there is a remote control, like that they come to know.

00:21:27.022 --> 00:21:34.622
And the person coming and attacking you, or anything attacking

00:21:34.782 --> 00:21:42.102
or any virus is there or any type of disease entering your body, they fight with them.

00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:46.382
But when you go against the Mother,

00:21:46.902 --> 00:21:51.262
going against the Mother means losing your morality, falling in virtue.

00:21:51.402 --> 00:21:54.322
Going against the Father means

00:21:54.442 --> 00:22:01.842
that you are not working, you are not acting, you become lazy.

00:22:01.902 --> 00:22:03.842
This is the sin against the Father.

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:08.222
But sin against the Mother is when you lose your morality.

00:22:08.622 --> 00:22:14.222
Those who have lost their chastity, their [center heart] becomes very weak.

00:22:14.522 --> 00:22:19.462
That is why it becomes very difficult to set this chakra all right.

00:22:19.582 --> 00:22:25.142
And the people to fall like this, them becoming all right is difficult.

00:22:25.222 --> 00:22:26.962
Like AIDS disease.

00:22:27.102 --> 00:22:31.622
Such kind of diseases that we call venereal diseases.

00:22:31.702 --> 00:22:34.422
All these venereal diseases come from immorality.

00:22:34.542 --> 00:22:38.662
And diseases caused by immorality cannot be cured

00:22:38.782 --> 00:22:41.602
till your Ganesha principle becomes alright.

00:22:43.702 --> 00:22:45.402
That why we should understand

00:22:45.502 --> 00:22:53.082
that we should stay away from immoral behavior.

00:22:53.162 --> 00:22:59.002
We should keep our personality, our entire life away from immorality.

00:22:59.102 --> 00:23:03.722
We should always be drowned in chastity.

00:23:04.902 --> 00:23:10.102
Regarding chastity Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has said something very great.

00:23:10.242 --> 00:23:12.602
Because His place is in Agyna chakra,

00:23:12.842 --> 00:23:15.722
He has told a very great thing about Agnya

00:23:15.942 --> 00:23:22.442
that even in your eyes there should not be anything unchaste –

00:23:22.602 --> 00:23:25.282
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:23:25.522 --> 00:23:29.022
Even the eyes should be such that it should be pure.

00:23:29.502 --> 00:23:33.782
If the eyes are not pure, then Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] is not there.

00:23:34.442 --> 00:23:36.962
But if you see in foreign nationals,

00:23:37.142 --> 00:23:40.802
we see that those who believe in Isa [Jesus Christ], they have bad eyes.

00:23:40.882 --> 00:23:43.422
Looking at this woman, looking at that lady.

00:23:43.602 --> 00:23:45.862
Then even the woman are looking at the men.

00:23:46.062 --> 00:23:49.442
Eyes are always roving. The eyes are never steady.

00:23:50.302 --> 00:23:55.982
Once this goes on, the dead spirits, move from the eyes.

00:23:56.162 --> 00:24:00.682
Once they [dead spirits] go into one person, then they [dead spirits] go to another.

00:24:00.842 --> 00:24:06.042
It is such a play that there is no enjoyment in that and the play keeps going on

00:24:06.162 --> 00:24:08.862
and the person goes mad in this.

00:24:10.242 --> 00:24:13.882
Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has told a very sensitive thing about morality

00:24:14.082 --> 00:24:16.882
that even your eyes should not be immoral.

00:24:17.042 --> 00:24:21.142
You cannot even look at another person with immoral eyes.

00:24:21.262 --> 00:24:28.482
This thing He told, there is a complete verse on chastity.

00:24:28.782 --> 00:24:32.002
Isa Masih [Jesus Christ] has only talked about chastity.

00:24:32.202 --> 00:24:37.402
Whenever He has spoken is mostly about how one can keep oneself chaste.

00:24:37.502 --> 00:24:40.302
How you can stand on morality.

00:24:41.382 --> 00:24:45.082
So, in Sahaja Yoga everything takes place in a Sahaj [natural] way

00:24:45.182 --> 00:24:48.442
when you completely accept Shri Ganesha

00:24:48.622 --> 00:24:52.582
and accept that this Shakti [power] should come to us.

00:24:53.142 --> 00:24:56.362
As such Shri Ganesha’s place is there on every chakra.

00:24:56.502 --> 00:25:00.942
That’s why I always tell you that on every chakra, a Vice Chancellor is seated.

00:25:01.062 --> 00:25:06.102
Chancellor Sir is seated and till the time He certifies, Kundalini will not rise.

00:25:06.162 --> 00:25:08.962
And He works on every chakra.

00:25:09.482 --> 00:25:12.382
So, as I was telling about today’s Yog [conjuction],

00:25:12.462 --> 00:25:16.242
that His second nature is that He is ‘Angaar’ [red hot coal].

00:25:16.342 --> 00:25:21.202
This ‘angaar’ can be cooled down with ‘angaar’.

00:25:22.482 --> 00:25:25.122
It can be cooled completely.

00:25:25.282 --> 00:25:37.342
Like you have seen when Ravan spoke against Shri Rama,

00:25:38.042 --> 00:25:40.442
then Lanka caught fire.

00:25:41.722 --> 00:25:49.842
Hanumanji is also born on Tuesday and He has nine great powers.

00:25:50.102 --> 00:25:54.722
Both of them together work like this.

00:25:55.082 --> 00:25:58.562
Especially if there is anger in a person,

00:26:00.082 --> 00:26:04.862
then how to cool that anger Shri Ganesha knows that.

00:26:05.202 --> 00:26:14.642
Then He does such actions, such tricks that that person is defeated completely

00:26:14.822 --> 00:26:19.462
and accepts, “I have made a mistake, I should not have done that”.

00:26:20.422 --> 00:26:24.782
So, when heated people are there, He can make then also all right.

00:26:24.882 --> 00:26:35.062
That’s why if someone has ‘mangli’ [born on Tuesday], they should wear coral.

00:26:35.222 --> 00:26:41.482
Coral is also heating. Heat is removed by heat.

00:26:42.082 --> 00:26:47.102
If you see in countries where the heat is more, people eat more chilies.

00:26:47.262 --> 00:26:53.722
Wherever you go. If you go to India, South India food is so spicy

00:26:53.842 --> 00:26:55.342
that you cannot eat.

00:26:55.522 --> 00:27:03.122
Also, in China, south China – Cantone etc., lot of chilies are eaten.

00:27:03.382 --> 00:27:09.282
In the same way in Italy – in the south. In France – in the South they eat a lot of chilies.

00:27:09.682 --> 00:27:14.602
Why do they eat? Because chilies remove spice, heat removes heat.

00:27:14.962 --> 00:27:20.762
That’s why they eat chili, so that they sweat a lot and remain cool.

00:27:21.442 --> 00:27:26.242
In the same way Shri Ganesha also sets right your heat from His heat.

00:27:26.622 --> 00:27:37.062
Like this He shows his anger [greatness] cause of which you yourself cool down.

00:27:37.742 --> 00:27:43.982
In all these diseases lot of heat is generated

00:27:44.042 --> 00:27:48.482
and the person becomes delirious cause of the heat.

00:27:48.882 --> 00:27:52.462
It is right that we treat this heat –

00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:59.682
do puja of Shri Ganesha and we should be specially surrendered to Him.

00:27:59.902 --> 00:28:04.582
Today I feel is a great conjunction that these three things have fallen on the same day;

00:28:04.722 --> 00:28:07.462
that today is the birthday of Isa Masih [Jesus Christ],

00:28:07.622 --> 00:28:11.162
today is Tuesday and today is also the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:14.022
And all of you have come to Ganapatipule.

00:28:14.182 --> 00:28:20.362
Everything has happened in such a way naturally

00:28:20.522 --> 00:28:23.522
that it feels like a miracle has taken place.

00:28:23.682 --> 00:28:26.062
A very big miracle that all have come.

00:28:26.322 --> 00:28:31.122
But due to that there was a problem that the crowd was so much

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:33.722
that we got stuck in traffic jam and it got late.

00:28:33.822 --> 00:28:37.802
But delay or anything that happens, is a matter of patience.

00:28:37.962 --> 00:28:43.042
I always think whatever time is fixed for us the puja will happen only at that time.

00:28:43.362 --> 00:28:45.222
It cannot take place before that.

00:28:45.362 --> 00:28:50.822
Why try to change the destiny? What is the use of fighting with it?

00:28:51.042 --> 00:28:55.302
Whatever is, it is. Whenever the puja has to take place it will.

00:28:55.502 --> 00:28:59.702
In that if you start, puja is not taking place, this was the time.

00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:04.482
We are not slaves of the clock. But there are so many advantages of this.

00:29:04.662 --> 00:29:10.662
You will come to know in future that if you don’t do servitude of time,

00:29:10.942 --> 00:29:12.982
Sahaja Yoga can be spread very much.

00:29:13.542 --> 00:29:16.862
But the person who is time bound, he can never spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:16.982 --> 00:29:20.782
He keeps thinking, “At this time I have to do this”, “At that time you have to do that”.

00:29:20.902 --> 00:29:23.402
Such a person does not have time for Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:23.502 --> 00:29:28.222
But the person who says, “He has to do Sahaja Yoga” – entire time is available for him.

00:29:28.342 --> 00:29:31.182
Everything happens very nicely.

00:29:31.262 --> 00:29:38.382
Only thing is you should have the experience and after experience you should have faith.

00:29:39.582 --> 00:29:45.842
So many things happen. Many people tell Me their miracles from morning till evening.

00:29:46.122 --> 00:29:50.342
“Mother I was worried, I am going, when I’ll meet? When she’ll come?

00:29:50.422 --> 00:29:53.762
But saw the person walking in front of me”.

00:29:54.982 --> 00:30:00.962
Whatever desire that comes to your mind can be fulfilled. It is a matter of faith.

00:30:01.142 --> 00:30:05.782
By faith, there is no blind faith in Sahaja Yoga. There’s absolutely no blind faith.

00:30:05.862 --> 00:30:09.042
There is faith where you see everything with your own eyes.

00:30:09.202 --> 00:30:13.462
After seeing everything if you don’t believe, what can you say for that?

00:30:13.662 --> 00:30:21.582
It can be said that you are very untruthful or you lie or you are stupid.

00:30:21.682 --> 00:30:23.382
These three things are possible.

00:30:23.502 --> 00:30:28.242
You are seeing everything, you are understanding that things are taking place.

00:30:28.382 --> 00:30:33.202
After that also you do not believe, then there is something wrong with you.

00:30:34.862 --> 00:30:40.182
On seeing all this you can think how dynamic Shri Ganesha is.

00:30:40.722 --> 00:30:44.502
In Maharashtra there are eight ‘Ashtavinayak’ [8 Ganeshas]

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:50.322
because of which Maharashtra has received a lot of blessings.

00:30:50.622 --> 00:30:55.102
But still people are so mad that they keep running after these things.

00:30:55.322 --> 00:31:00.942
They go on doing these things that they get stuck in rituals but do not achieve the truth.

00:31:01.442 --> 00:31:07.962
Now you people are lucky, are intelligent that you sought the truth and achieved it.

00:31:08.362 --> 00:31:13.762
Now to achieve this you have to imbibe the characteristics of Shri Ganesha.

00:31:14.002 --> 00:31:17.922
I was seeing thousands of people have come for Shri Ganesha’s puja.

00:31:18.302 --> 00:31:22.142
Among them, who are His believers,

00:31:22.322 --> 00:31:26.622
how many people have his qualities? I could not see anyone.

00:31:27.442 --> 00:31:32.922
They drink alcohol, fight among each other, ill-treat women and trouble them

00:31:33.002 --> 00:31:35.942
and then go for ‘Angarika’ of Shri Ganesha.

00:31:36.042 --> 00:31:40.022
When you are such an ‘angaar’ [hot tempered person], then why have to come here?

00:31:40.162 --> 00:31:43.542
Nobody thinks that if we believe in someone,

00:31:43.662 --> 00:31:46.042
how many of the qualities of them have we imbibed?

00:31:46.122 --> 00:31:50.182
“We have a lot of beliefs, we do puja of this [God] and we do puja of them [God]”.

00:31:50.242 --> 00:31:54.282
Ok then how many qualities [of the God] have you got? Nobody thinks like that.

00:31:55.782 --> 00:31:59.982
But the truth is if you believe in someone,

00:32:00.082 --> 00:32:05.002
then you should imbibe their qualities.Till you develop those qualities,

00:32:05.142 --> 00:32:09.622
you believe or not believe is the same, doesn’t make any difference.

00:32:11.282 --> 00:32:13.862
Today we are doing the puja of Shri Ganesha.

00:32:13.962 --> 00:32:16.602
There will be puja of Shri Ganesha and Gauri.

00:32:16.802 --> 00:32:21.362
You will need to understand that Gauri is the Kundalini.

00:32:21.482 --> 00:32:23.942
Mahakundalini is Mahagauri.

00:32:24.122 --> 00:32:34.182
Her work is that Her child who has been seeking for many years,

00:32:34.322 --> 00:32:36.882
give him Self Realisation.

00:32:37.442 --> 00:32:39.502
Give the child re-birth.

00:32:39.742 --> 00:32:44.042
This is the work of Mahagauri Who is residing in all of you.

00:32:44.242 --> 00:32:50.542
That’s why today we’ll do the puja of Ganeshji and Gauriji, later Devi puja.

00:32:51.722 --> 00:32:53.802
Many blessing to all.

00:33:01.342 --> 00:33:05.362
In short, I told them what is so special about today,

00:33:05.562 --> 00:33:09.022
tonight, is the time when, this is Tuesday,

00:33:09.542 --> 00:33:11.642
on Tuesday Shri Ganesha was born.

00:33:12.062 --> 00:33:18.602
So they celebrate every fourth day of the moon

00:33:18.762 --> 00:33:21.762
as the Shri Ganesha’s birth date

00:33:21.782 --> 00:33:23.682
because He was born on the fourth.

00:33:23.922 --> 00:33:27.442
But when this fourth falls on a Tuesday

00:33:27.642 --> 00:33:30.702
then they think it’s a tremendous yoga,

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:33.862
because on Tuesday He was born.

00:33:34.162 --> 00:33:40.582
On Tuesday, this fourth of the month has come,

00:33:40.742 --> 00:33:45.242
so they just try to worship it as a something special day.

00:33:45.782 --> 00:33:49.542
Now I also told them what is the quality of Shri Ganesha,

00:33:49.682 --> 00:33:51.182
which we see in Christ

00:33:51.222 --> 00:33:53.942
and as Christ is the Incarnation of Shri Ganesha,

00:33:53.982 --> 00:33:57.962
today remarkable thing is that the third yoga is

00:33:58.102 --> 00:34:01.102
that today is the birthday of Christ.

00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:04.642
And the fourth thing, which is very important,

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:08.902
is that you all should be here on such-and-such day on Ganapatipule.

00:34:10.502 --> 00:34:14.342
So it’s very important day and that’s how we have to learn

00:34:14.402 --> 00:34:17.622
that if you worship Ganapati or if you worship Christ,

00:34:17.742 --> 00:34:21.402
we should try to think what qualities we have got within ourselves.

00:34:24.582 --> 00:34:29.402
Now regarding Jesus Christ – you know Him very well –

00:34:29.542 --> 00:34:32.662
that He always talked of morality,

00:34:33.042 --> 00:34:37.262
always talked of holiness,

00:34:37.402 --> 00:34:40.282
of auspiciousness.

00:34:40.582 --> 00:34:47.482
And all these things, you see, the holiness and the complete

00:34:49.342 --> 00:34:52.502
cleanliness within your being

00:34:52.922 --> 00:34:55.702
is to such an extent that, I said, He said that,

00:34:55.782 --> 00:34:58.542
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:34:58.782 --> 00:35:03.122
So Shri Ganesha also was against the adultery.

00:35:03.362 --> 00:35:06.522
Any kind of adultery He was against

00:35:06.622 --> 00:35:10.762
and that’s why those people who indulge into adulterous life suffer,

00:35:10.962 --> 00:35:12.422
suffer very badly.

00:35:12.422 --> 00:35:14.542
It’s rather difficult to cure them.

00:35:14.962 --> 00:35:18.602
All these diseases which are incurable of Ganesha’s problems

00:35:18.722 --> 00:35:20.902
are really difficult, because

00:35:21.142 --> 00:35:23.122
here you have insulted Shri Ganesha

00:35:23.242 --> 00:35:26.142
and that’s why He gets angry with you.

00:35:26.462 --> 00:35:30.062
Now, His style is of two type(s).

00:35:30.122 --> 00:35:34.162
One is by which He soothes you down, He soothes your Kundalini

00:35:34.162 --> 00:35:37.902
and the second one is where He really gets angry with you

00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:40.042
and tries to punish you.

00:35:41.102 --> 00:35:44.862
These two qualities here, so one has to be very careful

00:35:44.982 --> 00:35:47.582
when you are dealing with your morality.

00:35:48.122 --> 00:35:51.062
The morality should be a part and parcel of your being.

00:35:51.162 --> 00:35:53.562
That you should be proud that you are moral

00:35:53.622 --> 00:35:56.522
and that you should try to lead a very moral life

00:35:56.602 --> 00:35:59.662
without torturing anybody, without troubling anybody.

00:36:00.142 --> 00:36:02.982
In Sahaja Yoga, I hope it is all very clear cut

00:36:03.222 --> 00:36:06.202
that we have to lead a very, very moral life.

00:36:06.402 --> 00:36:09.082
Of course, all My lecture can be translated later

00:36:09.162 --> 00:36:10.922
and I hope you’ll be able to enjoy it.

00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:12.622
But this is the best part of it,

00:36:12.722 --> 00:36:16.102
that today we have the birthday of Christ,

00:36:16.222 --> 00:36:18.042
the birthday of Shri Ganesha

00:36:18.222 --> 00:36:20.502
and also on such a date

00:36:20.642 --> 00:36:26.522
which is so well-worshipped and regarded as something important in India.

00:36:27.942 --> 00:36:29.522
May God bless you all!
