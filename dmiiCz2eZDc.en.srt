1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
But if your attention is passing through the centre

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,470
of the Agnya chakra

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,108
you don’t see any light.

4
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:12,368
But if it is not passing through that,

5
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:15,105
then what happens, because your attention is outside,

6
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:16,135
you see the light.

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,274
Because it is enlightening also, you see.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,716
And you just see the light but the Kundalini is not passing through,

9
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:24,114
just it’s stuck up there.

10
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:26,024
And that’s why, because of that light,

11
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:28,137
your eyes go on like that, you see.

12
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:34,125
People have seen even a complete flow of light

13
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:35,566
moving up like that.

14
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:38,006
But they have not felt the Realisation.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,515
They saw it coming up to the Agnya

16
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:42,451
and then the whole thing drops back.

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,542
They saw it!

18
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:46,212
They saw the Kundalini how it was helping,

19
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:50,631
the Adi Kundalini was helping your Kundalini – they saw it.

20
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:55,682
Even this light rising is because of that. Because your attention is still outside, you see.

21
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,773
So you go on, the flickering of the eyes starts.

22
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:01,652
Then I tell you to fix up your eyes onto my finger.

23
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,572
When you fix it up onto my finger and my face,

24
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:09,006
what happens the chaitanya pushes you, through your eyes, into the centre, you see.

25
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:11,162
So that you see me as I am.

26
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:14,974
But the eyes are controlled by the chaitanya

27
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:19,563
and the attention that is inside is pushed inside that,

28
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:24,920
what you call the apparition, in the Agnya chakra

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,712
So I always say that if you are flickering your eyes,

30
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:31,358
please pay attention to me, so that the chaitanya works out through your eyes

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,858
and fixes your attention to pass through.

32
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:39,162
Because the light starts spreading on all the sides and you see that light and the eyes go on like that;

33
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,441
you cannot close your eyes.

34
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:43,361
Which is, that is the reason for that.

35
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,215
Then the second thing you said that

36
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:48,465
you are facing:

37
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:51,537
your Sahasrara was on the thing.

38
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:53,953
Yes, one of the reasons for nirvichara is that.

39
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:59,117
But also nirvichara is a way to express the blessings of your Mother.

40
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:02,429
When She wants to bless you. See, you wrote the letter She was happy.

41
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,143
Just to bless you, you became nirvichar.

42
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,697
You see, it’s a blessing.

43
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:11,181
That’s how you get the grace, you see, that comes to you from your Mother,

44
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,562
that you become nirvichar, that's that one has to recognise.

45
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,393
If you do the things that I tell you,

46
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:18,419
I feel I bless you very much,

47
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,010
because they are for your good,

48
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,911
for your kalyana

49
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,431
for your mangal (auspiciousness)

50
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,518
and that’s why you are blessed and that blessing you feel as nirvichara.

51
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:29,941
Because I am Nirvichara myself.

52
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,611
Yes. Come along.

53
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:36,830
I’m Douglas Fry, one of the early Sahaja yogis from London.

54
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:39,275
And what I would like to say is,

55
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:43,865
it’s rather amazing the way that the forces of good

56
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:46,014
and the forces of bad

57
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:50,361
have nevertheless, pushed us towards Mataji.

58
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:54,145
Now the person that introduced us to Mataji,

59
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,615
as you have heard from Gavin,

60
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:59,455
was a yoga ‘playboy’. Now....

61
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,617
And who was that?

62
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,958
A yoga playboy.

63
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:04,693
A guru or something.

64
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:07,955
Yes, he was, he was no doubt, and is still!

65
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:13,491
The reason he came to England…

66
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,513
…was to make some money out of yoga!

67
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:21,573
The reason he came to England was because he’d seen this particular fake guru

68
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:24,693
with the long hair, that looked like a pop star.

69
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:32,252
He told me, and I think he might have told some of the others of us,

70
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:37,633
that this particular guru had said to him,

71
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,175
“You should go to England.”

72
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:45,580
So, obviously he came to England and started yoga classes.

73
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:49,508
Now, where the yoga classes started

74
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:55,621
was the last place that you could teach yoga because it was very, very cold

75
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,896
and we started in winter,

76
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:00,295
and there was no heating on.

77
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:06,387
But for some reason, the yoga classes still went on.

78
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:09,230
Now, eventually,

79
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:13,353
he met Mataji and tried his experiment on us.

80
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:22,305
And we all felt coolness in the hands, we all got Realisation.

81
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:29,110
Now, another thing that this yoga playboy had tried

82
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,358
was Transcendental Meditation, I found out.

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,505
Now, after us having got Realisation,

84
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:39,435
he tried to teach us meditation

85
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:42,257
and the technique that he was trying to do

86
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:46,737
was a technique used by TM.

87
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:51,317
The TM people, they give you a mantra, they might make the mantra up themselves.

88
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:55,698
Or sometimes they give you names that sounds a bit like Sanskrit.

89
00:04:55,638 --> 00:05:00,555
In fact, I heard one fellow who had a mantra that sounded like “key ring”.

90
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:04,211
"Keyring!"

91
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:10,630
If you pronounce it strangely it can sort of sound like...

92
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:13,238
If you pronounce it strangely, it can sound a bit like Indian

93
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:15,940
but that’s neither here nor there.

94
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:18,872
So this fellow was trying to teach us

95
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:22,192
he was trying to use Transcendental Meditation techniques

96
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:24,411
to make us go into meditation.

97
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,906
And he told us that we should concentrate on a word,

98
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:30,146
a word that we think is nice.

99
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:34,680
Now the particular word I used was ‘divine’.

100
00:05:34,687 --> 00:05:37,850
Now we sat down there

101
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,545
for about ten... we sat down

102
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:43,685
for about ten or fifteen minutes to meditate

103
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:49,721
and I remember I had my head... I felt an explosion,

104
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:52,363
that finished in my head.

105
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,940
Now I did not know the time that it was

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,512
so I said, “I felt this explosion in my head, what was it?”

107
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,579
So he said, “Oh, I don’t think that was anything, you forget about it!”

108
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:09,725
Now,

109
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:19,024
once again, I think perhaps, just for a split of a second, I had achieved thoughtless awareness

110
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:21,855
and my Kundalini obviously had risen.

111
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:25,194
And then, at a later date,

112
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:30,132
once I was asleep, I actually saw my Kundalini rise.

113
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:34,964
So my head was full of an intense white flame

114
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:37,028
and then it went down again

115
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,437
and then it came up again.

116
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:43,968
And then I heard a “ting” from the top of my head.

117
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:47,877
That is a ting.  That’s not Kundalini, you see, this is the thing

118
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:50,591
This I assumed to be the breaking of the brahmarandhra

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,682
No, no.

120
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:52,372
This wasn't.

121
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:53,362
It is not.

122
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:56,024
This is what happens to so many people, you see,

123
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:58,904
that is always the ida and pingala nadi.

124
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,414
This is?

125
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,754
This is ida pingala

126
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:02,923
Oh, I see, pardon me.

127
00:07:02,934 --> 00:07:04,044
The sympathetic.

128
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,021
That works out and it looks like Kundalini.

129
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,053
But you don’t get any vibrations in the hand or head. It looks like.....

130
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:13,927
You know, some people get a big hole here, down below.

131
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,653
Especially this Muktananda he does like that.

132
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:19,163
And they get a feeling like that you know.

133
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:23,803
You should never feel the Kundalini rising like an explosion in a block like that.

134
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:24,963
Oh, I see

135
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:28,019
Later on, after Realisation, you may feel the slow movement.

136
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:30,790
But normally in Realisation you do not

137
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:36,704
Well, anyway, that’s all I want to say.

138
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,875
Thank you very much.

139
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,914
What about Sahaj Yog?

140
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:46,411
Well, anyway, after all this experience

141
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:56,593
initially of course I was in quite a mess, I used to take drugs and drink as many of the Western people seem to do these days.

142
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,759
And gradually I found,

143
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:02,809
after being exposed to Mataji’s love and Mataji’s influence,

144
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:07,019
I found that gradually my interest in drugs,

145
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:10,249
my interest in drinking and smoking, it all dropped out

146
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:14,608
and I gradually became more and more stable.

147
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:25,988
And now, I find that life for me is very settled and…

148
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,598
you can give Realisation.

149
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:32,015
I find that I can give Realisation to people and it's...

150
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,395
I can cure also.

151
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,566
And yes, also I have to say I can cure people

152
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:42,347
and I find it... the first time I gave Realisation to somebody, I was quite amazed

153
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:46,417
and just to realise I could do such a thing.

154
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:50,096
But now, to give Realisation it’s still, you know,

155
00:08:50,105 --> 00:08:54,525
it still makes me feel very nice and clean inside,

156
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:58,403
and it’s just, just wonderful.

157
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,768
This kind of experience many people get,

158
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:13,233
like Shri Krishna also had like that and so many people get a feeling like that,

159
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,766
that something goes up, suddenly shoots off,

160
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:18,766
and you feel exploded and opened out and all that.

161
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,516
But that is not the Kundalini.

162
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:23,083
It is the sympathetic nervous system

163
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,953
which is very much in strain.

164
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,790
You see her strain.

165
00:09:27,793 --> 00:09:31,460
And in that expression of that strain, what happens

166
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:35,932
that the whole thing, the energy of the complete sympathetic,

167
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:40,171
whatever they have in the parasympathetic is sucked in,

168
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:41,721
into the sympathetic.

169
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,391
Because the sympathetic is too much activated, you see.

170
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:47,841
Then what happens the parasympathetic system has

171
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,761
your stored up energy, whatever it is.

172
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:52,890
So it just sucks in all that

173
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,649
and when it is sucked in,

174
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:02,449
suddenly, the wave from the pelvic plexus, down below starts.

175
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,859
Because, you see, all the energies are released to the sympathetic.

176
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,430
Because the sympathetic is so exhausted

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,588
that whatever is the energy left in the chakras is released.

178
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,338
Once it is released, you see,

179
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:21,327
all that released energy you see, makes you feel

180
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:24,817
that the energy is rising within you because it is rising through ida and pingala.

181
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:29,716
Now this is the energy which is just sucked into ida and pingala. It rises up.

182
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:32,622
And you can feel it going up and coming down and all that.

183
00:10:32,672 --> 00:10:37,327
But the after effects of this one is this,

184
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:45,875
that such a person – of course in these experiences people feel sometimes a horrible thing also,

185
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,965
that they feel that there’s a heat liberation,

186
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,845
sometimes they feel some sort of a scorpion bites going on

187
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,072
or some snakes coming up and all kind of things can happen in this.

188
00:10:57,085 --> 00:10:59,004
It can be very horrifying also, this one,

189
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:01,768
and could be very simple also.

190
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:06,558
But when this happens, the after effect is like that, that you become arbitrary.

191
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:13,117
It is sort of all this drugs system started after that,

192
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:17,455
because once you are released from that self-control in between,

193
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:20,285
you can take to anything like this,

194
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:23,486
because you are free now to do whatever you please you see.

195
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,766
And that’s how you can take to drugs and things.

196
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:29,726
And this is what all these gurus are doing,

197
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,382
is to take out this stored energy which is controlling you,

198
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:35,312
suck them out onto the sympathetic.

199
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,442
There are so many ways by which they can do it:

200
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,042
they can starve you,

201
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:41,322
they can make you work very hard,

202
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:42,935
they can make you tired,

203
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:49,469
they can make you say some mantras, things. I mean they make your sympathetic work so hard

204
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:52,040
that ultimately a stage is reached where

205
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,539
your chakras release all the energy that is stored in them

206
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:57,529
and just get out of it, you see.

207
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:02,489
So all this energy they will suck in and a person feels: “Oh, suddenly something has happened!”

208
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:07,485
But in these circumstances, you see, you may have a big hollow in the head like that,

209
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:11,055
as if, like a mad person has, here, a big hollow.

210
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:15,055
And the whole thing is sucked in and you get a hollow there like that.

211
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,507
So many people get this thing,

212
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:21,682
that is a very different thing. But because all the energy that was inside is sucked in.

213
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:25,502
So it has become like a big hollow inside, you see.

214
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:28,342
Like a mad person has too, the same thing.

215
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:35,557
So this is the way people confuse between Kundalini awakening and the exhaustion of the sympathetic.

216
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:40,237
Normally the Kundalini awakening through Sahaj Yoga, you do not feel anything.

217
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,486
It just goes up and works out.

218
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:45,286
But sometimes, if there is, after Realisation,

219
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:49,573
if there is an obstruction due to certain combinations,

220
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,139
it may be the obstruction may go out like that.

221
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,721
But there’s a tremendous difference between the two.

222
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:59,531
That first, you release in the hands, of the vibrations, start with that.

223
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:03,071
But with the first one you do not get, on the contrary, you get heated up

224
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:06,351
and you start avoiding yourself, escaping from yourself.

225
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:09,711
And this starts. And that’s how you get into these drugs

226
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:14,789
This is very much played by the gurus. You see, that’s what they do to you.

227
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:20,375
They exhaust you completely, so that you cannot withstand reality and the present moment.

228
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,575
And so you try to get into something.

229
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:25,993
And once you try to escape it, you see, you just...

230
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:30,469
the whole release of the stores and parasympathetic takes place

231
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:32,063
and the Deities are broken

232
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,833
and you are broken, you become arbitrary.

233
00:13:33,883 --> 00:13:36,113
It’s a cancerous sort of a thing.

234
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,816
So that’s not Kundalini awakening but we would say,

235
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:43,256
it is more a sympathetic system which comes into play

236
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,624
and the movement of peristaltic, what you call that ‘pumping’ up.

237
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:52,803
Peristaltic movements of the pumping up of the energy starts.

238
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,314
They start putting it into the thing.

239
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:59,623
And the whole thing is sucked in because of the exhaustion.

240
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,680
So one should not confuse between the two.

241
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,544
Because after Realisation you cannot take to drugs and things easily.

242
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,043
It’s very difficult..

243
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:11,343
You have to really force yourself to take to drugs.

244
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:18,638
Mother, you just answered now something that I never questioned because after I met you I did not want to question it.

245
00:14:18,698 --> 00:14:27,448
I had, two years before meeting you, I had an extremely powerful experience of the same kind…
