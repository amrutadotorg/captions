00:50:49.447 --> 00:50:55.781
This felicitation function is little embarrassing for Me

00:50:55.822 --> 00:51:07.697
because I was born as a very simple person

00:51:07.739 --> 00:51:16.739
and I have been an extremely simple person. I don't understand money.

00:51:16.781 --> 00:51:27.156
I don't understand hatred. I don't understand greed. I'm so simple about it.

00:51:27.198 --> 00:51:33.239
Despite that, you people came and got your Realization.

00:51:33.281 --> 00:51:41.489
It's your own achievement. It's your own desires that you have achieved.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:50.198
I find so many children nowadays born as realized souls.

00:51:50.239 --> 00:51:54.198
So I think the time is also there,

00:51:54.239 --> 00:52:03.364
that at My life, in My life itself, this was to happen.

00:52:03.405 --> 00:52:06.489
It is everybody's lot.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:15.489
I think, like Shri Rama, then came Shri Krishna, then came Jesus, then other people.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:23.364
It was their time. And My time it is to give you all Realization.

00:52:23.405 --> 00:52:30.864
But, I must say, you all have taken it very heartily,

00:52:30.906 --> 00:52:37.031
sweetly, and are using your powers

00:52:37.073 --> 00:52:40.655
to give love to others and to transform others.

00:52:40.655 --> 00:52:50.198
The other day, I was talking about love. Now the love, as it is understood,

00:52:50.239 --> 00:52:55.614
is in your heart as this, but do you know the ocean of love

00:52:55.655 --> 00:53:01.073
is your Sahasrara. When your Sahasrara is filled with love,

00:53:01.114 --> 00:53:09.864
then the life is changed. You don't become a very intelligent man,

00:53:09.906 --> 00:53:19.073
very dynamic personality,but you are nothing but love

00:53:19.114 --> 00:53:23.114
and this love is so self-satisfying.

00:53:23.156 --> 00:53:31.323
You are not bothered if others don't love you or they love you. You don't see to that part.

00:53:31.363 --> 00:53:36.864
What you see is the enjoyment from that love.

00:53:36.906 --> 00:53:42.655
It's a tremendous ocean of love. You all have got it.

00:53:42.697 --> 00:53:51.572
And once you have entered into Sahaja Yoga, you know that you have entered into Sahasrara

00:53:51.614 --> 00:54:01.281
and Sahasrara is the, I tell you, the source of all the truth.

00:54:01.323 --> 00:54:07.073
Truth is there, the complete truth.

00:54:07.114 --> 00:54:15.864
Truth is the knowledge and also the truth is love.

00:54:15.864 --> 00:54:22.697
If you love somebody, you know the truths about that person.

00:54:22.739 --> 00:54:30.363
You find out whether the person is good or bad or anything. It's very difficult.

00:54:30.364 --> 00:54:38.447
But if you love that person, then immediately know what's wrong with that person,

00:54:38.489 --> 00:54:43.198
what's right from that person. But because of your love,

00:54:43.239 --> 00:54:50.655
you encompass the whole atmosphere between you and him

00:54:50.655 --> 00:54:53.198
or between you and others.

00:54:53.239 --> 00:54:59.405
You don't see the bad points easily, very difficult.

00:54:59.447 --> 00:55:04.198
I've been many a times, people say, cheated by others. Agreed,

00:55:04.239 --> 00:55:14.530
but I have no sense of what cheating means, how people cheat you.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:17.572
Many a times, people say that they are talking ill about Me.

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:22.530
Yes, they are. I can see they are talking, doesn't matter.

00:55:22.572 --> 00:55:27.906
Makes no difference to Me. If they're taking ill of Me, it's all right.

00:55:27.947 --> 00:55:32.363
But this felicitation embarrasses Me definitely

00:55:32.363 --> 00:55:38.405
because I've not done anything so extraordinary, as they think.

00:55:38.447 --> 00:55:44.405
Extraordinary is that whatever capacity you have,

00:55:44.447 --> 00:55:49.739
if it acts, then it is there, like love.

00:55:49.781 --> 00:55:56.281
I have tremendous love, I don't know what to say. And it acts. It works.

00:55:56.323 --> 00:56:00.363
And every human being cares for love.

00:56:00.363 --> 00:56:03.781
You may be very great, you might be very intelligent,

00:56:03.822 --> 00:56:09.822
you may be earning lots of money, whatever it is. It's not so important.

00:56:09.822 --> 00:56:17.239
What is the most important thing is that you are loved.

00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:23.489
This is, I have not made a theory out of it or I am not going to say that you all should learn it,

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:29.906
but it's so basic and that's the only thing that helps.

00:56:29.947 --> 00:56:38.363
So residing in the Sahasrara, if you see the waves of love flowing,

00:56:38.364 --> 00:56:43.864
maybe some people might take advantage of it, it doesn't matter,

00:56:43.906 --> 00:56:50.031
makes no difference. Some people can also mislead you.

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:54.156
It's all right. All kinds of things they do;

00:56:54.198 --> 00:57:01.906
but when there is love, you see, you are satisfied, you are not bothered,

00:57:01.947 --> 00:57:04.614
because you love everyone.

00:57:04.655 --> 00:57:12.572
So you are satisfied. You are not bothered as to what others, they are doing to you,

00:57:12.614 --> 00:57:16.864
what advantage they're taking of you, what they are troubling you

00:57:16.906 --> 00:57:21.156
or all these also felicitations, how they have done,

00:57:21.198 --> 00:57:26.614
also all the facilities that you have from your own being,

00:57:26.655 --> 00:57:28.781
are automatic.

00:57:28.781 --> 00:57:34.198
This felicitations and all that, of course, reflects you, no doubt,

00:57:34.239 --> 00:57:37.031
but to Me, it is nothing great.

00:57:37.031 --> 00:57:41.031
I don't think it is a very great achievement for Me

00:57:41.073 --> 00:57:46.239
because I have no vision, as such, I must tell you. I've heard this word,

00:57:46.239 --> 00:57:48.947
that Mother has a vision. No, no, no, no,

00:57:48.989 --> 00:57:50.947
I have no vision, I must tell you.

00:57:50.989 --> 00:57:55.947
My simple thing is that everybody must love,

00:57:55.947 --> 00:58:00.947
and a pure love will change your lives,

00:58:00.989 --> 00:58:05.073
it will change the whole world, no doubt about it.

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:08.697
It should come to you natural

00:58:08.697 --> 00:58:13.031
because now you have pierced through your Sahasrara.

00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:21.614
So for every Sahaja Yogi, love should be very, very natural thing, absolutely.

00:58:21.655 --> 00:58:27.697
For example, I know sometimes people are very rude.

00:58:27.739 --> 00:58:31.363
They have certain rules and regulations

00:58:31.405 --> 00:58:38.697
and then they get very angry with the other people or whatever it is.

00:58:38.739 --> 00:58:42.989
Some people have positions and they use their position to get angry with others

00:58:42.989 --> 00:58:48.363
and even to get after that person and torture another person,

00:58:48.405 --> 00:58:55.614
they do, go on doing like this. But they have missed the point. They have missed the point.

00:58:55.655 --> 00:59:04.739
If you just have love, that pure love, then you see the point.

00:59:04.781 --> 00:59:11.530
You see it, that 'Yes, yes, that's what he is doing, that's why he's — .'

00:59:11.572 --> 00:59:16.614
You know that. But you are not bothered, 'Why he is doing like me,'

00:59:16.655 --> 00:59:20.822
why is he troubling you and gradually, everything nullifies.

00:59:20.864 --> 00:59:24.405
Everything finishes off by itself.

00:59:24.447 --> 00:59:30.489
I've seen many people who are talking ill about Me,

00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:34.864
doing all kinds of things against Me. So what? Let them do.

00:59:34.864 --> 00:59:40.281
That's their job. Let them do; but to Me, it doesn't disturb, you know.

00:59:40.281 --> 00:59:44.739
I think they are indulging into something of their own style,

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:51.447
but what do you get? Joy comes only out of pure love.

00:59:51.489 --> 00:59:55.781
If you have no pure love, you cannot have joy.

00:59:55.822 --> 00:59:59.739
Talking that we are very joyous and all that,

00:59:59.781 --> 01:00:03.947
I know who are joyous really and who are not.

01:00:03.989 --> 01:00:08.822
You cannot artificially say that 'I am joyous.'

01:00:08.864 --> 01:00:16.239
It should be some sort of an innate, spontaneous feeling within.

01:00:16.281 --> 01:00:24.073
So you are the ocean of feelings, ocean of beautiful feelings.

01:00:24.114 --> 01:00:32.697
And when you are enriched by that ocean, you are least bothered about anything.

01:00:32.739 --> 01:00:36.363
You know very well that I am very bad at money.

01:00:36.363 --> 01:00:40.572
I don't understand. I cannot count money. So what?

01:00:40.614 --> 01:00:44.239
I mean, that's My handicap, I should say,

01:00:44.281 --> 01:00:48.655
but it doesn't matter. What is so needed is

01:00:48.697 --> 01:00:59.447
'Can you feel the love of others? Can you feel the sweetness of others?'

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:02.405
As you see a little child, how nice you feel.

01:01:02.405 --> 01:01:07.405
In the same way, 'Do you feel that for others?'

01:01:07.447 --> 01:01:15.281
or 'Are they like children? Are they innocent like children?'

01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:22.489
And the now, I would suggest that innocence is the sign of love.

01:01:22.489 --> 01:01:30.323
Anybody who has innocence would know the technique of love.

01:01:30.363 --> 01:01:35.906
If you are very clever, intelligent, you can answer back,

01:01:35.947 --> 01:01:44.447
you can correct people, do that. No. That's not the way. If you have love,

01:01:44.489 --> 01:01:49.364
you can correct people without saying anything to them,

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:54.489
because love is a supreme intelligence.

01:01:54.530 --> 01:02:02.156
It gives you all the correct method. It works out that.

01:02:02.198 --> 01:02:07.073
The whole thing works out that and then people say,

01:02:07.073 --> 01:02:09.156
'Mother, it's a miracle how it has happened.'

01:02:09.198 --> 01:02:13.530
No, no, it's no miracle.It's simple thing that love

01:02:13.572 --> 01:02:17.530
has acted in its own way. Love is not a dead thing.

01:02:17.572 --> 01:02:23.489
It's not a dead sea. It not only thinks, but it acts

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:27.405
and acts so beautifully.

01:02:27.447 --> 01:02:31.156
Sometimes I'm amazed at its working.

01:02:31.156 --> 01:02:35.363
We call it a miracle, this, that. Nothing — it's love.

01:02:35.363 --> 01:02:42.239
Now, because the Divine loves you, it gives you miracles, so called.

01:02:42.281 --> 01:02:44.739
It can do anything

01:02:44.781 --> 01:02:49.906
because the Divine wants that you should get to Sahaja Yoga

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:52.864
and you should become a real yogi.

01:02:52.906 --> 01:02:59.323
So whatever this love does, you think it's miracle.

01:02:59.363 --> 01:03:04.198
It is not. Why people say, 'Mother, that's your style.'

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:07.114
It's not question. It's a question of love.

01:03:07.156 --> 01:03:13.239
Say, I love everyone very much, I trust everyone very much.

01:03:13.281 --> 01:03:20.614
I never doubt, to begin with, and they are sinking, sinking,

01:03:20.655 --> 01:03:25.073
but still I have faith that they'll come round, that they'll be all right.

01:03:25.114 --> 01:03:30.363
Give them a chance. But supposing they try some tricks,

01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:33.739
you'll be amazed how they get exposed.

01:03:33.781 --> 01:03:38.489
How they get exposed, it's very surprising.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:44.281
We have a Sahaja Yogi in Dubai. He told Me,

01:03:44.323 --> 01:03:47.572
'Mother, no use giving Realization to these big people.'

01:03:47.614 --> 01:03:52.239
I say, 'Why?' So he gave Me the name of very highly

01:03:52.281 --> 01:03:56.239
spiritual people accepted by society.

01:03:56.281 --> 01:03:59.489
'I gave him Realization and he got exposed.

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:03.530
I don't know, I never said anything — got exposed.'

01:04:03.572 --> 01:04:09.947
Another person whom he gave Realization, also had a very big thing,

01:04:09.989 --> 01:04:16.781
having lots of awards and this and that, he got exposed.

01:04:16.822 --> 01:04:24.530
And he gave Realization to one fellow who had peace award.

01:04:24.572 --> 01:04:34.947
He also got exposed. And then it was in the newspaper all about him.

01:04:34.989 --> 01:04:42.530
Now what is happening is that this man, out of love for the other one, gives them Realization,

01:04:42.572 --> 01:04:48.822
but that same love acts in such a manner that he gets exposed.

01:04:48.864 --> 01:04:51.739
You don't want to expose people.

01:04:51.781 --> 01:04:56.323
You want that somehow they'll come to Sahaja Yoga all right, it's all right working out.

01:04:56.363 --> 01:05:01.530
So he said, 'Mother, I don't think I'll give Realization to anyone.'

01:05:01.572 --> 01:05:06.156
I said, 'See, you go on giving.

01:05:06.198 --> 01:05:11.239
If the Divine wants that the person should be exposed, he will be exposed.'

01:05:11.281 --> 01:05:16.697
If there is anything wrong with that person, he'll be exposed.

01:05:16.739 --> 01:05:20.864
Somebody who gets Realization, supposing,

01:05:20.906 --> 01:05:26.655
and he meets with an accident, of course he'll be saved,

01:05:26.697 --> 01:05:31.363
but he might meet with an accident.

01:05:31.363 --> 01:05:35.447
So what is the reason why? Why did he meet with the accident?

01:05:35.489 --> 01:05:44.114
Because he doesn't do anything for Sahaja Yoga. He's very ambitious.

01:05:44.156 --> 01:05:53.156
Somebody who's very sick, he's all right with Sahaja Yoga

01:05:53.198 --> 01:05:59.323
and somebody who's not that sick, gets much worse. It's a fact.

01:05:59.363 --> 01:06:05.031
Though he's protected — that's one thing about Sahaj Yoga,

01:06:05.073 --> 01:06:09.697
you may be the worst Sahaja Yoga, you are protected, no doubt, but if you go on like that,

01:06:09.739 --> 01:06:19.281
if you all the time trying to go against Sahaja

01:06:19.323 --> 01:06:25.073
and become asahaj, then you suffer very badly.

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:31.906
It's very simple that if you are standing in a place, you are established in a place,

01:06:31.947 --> 01:06:44.614
which is very peaceful, very joy-giving, but you want to get out of it,

01:06:44.655 --> 01:06:50.363
so you face whatever is outside, it's automatic.

01:06:50.363 --> 01:07:00.906
If you stand in the place which is so peaceful, which is joyous, which is full of love,

01:07:00.906 --> 01:07:05.781
you are all right, you'll grow in spirituality.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:10.447
But if you want to get out of it, then you have it.

01:07:10.489 --> 01:07:21.323
You can't help it. It's like a fortress or we can call a very secluded place,

01:07:21.323 --> 01:07:32.073
which very comfort and very much full of attention and all that

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:37.947
and then you want to go out of the attention. So, you're gone.

01:07:37.989 --> 01:07:42.572
That's how some Sahaja Yogis don't understand

01:07:42.614 --> 01:07:46.156
why they are not yet getting into Sahaj Yoga.

01:07:46.198 --> 01:07:55.073
So no use using your intelligence because this intelligence, human intelligence,

01:07:55.114 --> 01:07:58.530
is not a very high quality function.

01:07:58.572 --> 01:08:04.906
What is best is to fall in love with your Self

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:18.614
love which is divine, love which is nourishing, love that looks after you.

01:08:18.655 --> 01:08:22.447
But we don't know how to look after ourselves.

01:08:22.489 --> 01:08:27.989
We don't know how to love ourselves. We love this person, love that person,

01:08:28.031 --> 01:08:34.906
but what about yourself? Then they think it is selfishness — no, not at all.

01:08:34.906 --> 01:08:43.822
To know the Self is love. If you know the Self, you'll know love,

01:08:43.822 --> 01:08:46.781
you'll fall into the ocean of that love.

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:50.447
But that is what is My experience, I'm telling,

01:08:50.489 --> 01:08:53.447
and you all should experience the same love.

01:08:53.489 --> 01:08:56.614
Just watch yourself.

01:08:56.655 --> 01:09:05.947
It's very simple to introspect, 'Do I have love within me, fully?'

01:09:05.989 --> 01:09:10.239
Partly it is love, partly no.

01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:14.114
Now love can be very much bounded

01:09:14.156 --> 01:09:18.530
also like 'we love our country', say India.

01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:22.363
If we love our country, so we may think

01:09:22.363 --> 01:09:24.239
all Indian things are good.

01:09:24.281 --> 01:09:26.781
We'll never talk ill about our country.

01:09:26.822 --> 01:09:32.363
Anybody says anything about India, against, we'll hate that person.

01:09:32.364 --> 01:09:43.530
It's with everyone. You love your country. Also you love, say,

01:09:43.572 --> 01:09:49.281
your parents, love anybody. But is a limited love.

01:09:49.323 --> 01:09:54.906
It's a bounded love. Love should be just opened.

01:09:54.947 --> 01:10:01.198
Then you will see where do you stand as far as your country's concerned,

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:07.323
as far as your relationships are concerned. You will know everything.

01:10:07.363 --> 01:10:12.447
You need not harm, you need not say anything, you need not quarrel, fight,

01:10:12.489 --> 01:10:16.739
but you will know -- because love gives you knowledge,

01:10:16.781 --> 01:10:21.073
complete knowledge about the person.

01:10:21.073 --> 01:10:26.364
You know the person, what he's up to, what he's doing,

01:10:26.405 --> 01:10:32.405
but you don't mind because you love that person.

01:10:32.447 --> 01:10:35.489
So you don't mind. 'All right, so ahead.'

01:10:35.489 --> 01:10:39.281
It's like a little child. It's going on the wrong way. Let it go.

01:10:39.281 --> 01:10:43.906
Now with all these things, whatever you wear,

01:10:43.947 --> 01:10:49.073
you are very lucky people who have reached Sahasrara

01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:54.572
and that you all know everything about Sahaj Yoga.

01:10:54.614 --> 01:11:01.281
But without practising Sahaja Yoga, you cannot work it out

01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:06.114
because then, by practising it, you know about your Self.

01:11:06.156 --> 01:11:13.614
When you meditate, you know your Self and then you get just filled with love.

01:11:13.655 --> 01:11:18.697
But now, while sitting, you just start thinking,

01:11:18.697 --> 01:11:24.614
'He's a very bad man. I hate him' — this thing. All such stupid ideas come into your head,

01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:30.363
or 'I must buy this ornament' or 'I must buy this particular car'

01:11:30.364 --> 01:11:35.363
and all that, then you are not loving.

01:11:35.405 --> 01:11:43.947
But if you love, then what happens is that whatever you need, you get.

01:11:43.989 --> 01:11:46.947
Whatever you want, you get.

01:11:46.947 --> 01:11:50.947
You have to first love yourself,

01:11:50.947 --> 01:11:59.864
but that love should be pure love. As a result of that, you'll cleanse yourself.

01:11:59.906 --> 01:12:05.572
Sometimes you are so much identified with your temperaments,

01:12:05.614 --> 01:12:09.363
with your nature, with you personality, whatever it is,

01:12:09.363 --> 01:12:12.614
but then you realize, in that love,

01:12:12.614 --> 01:12:15.906
that 'This is not love. This is blind.'

01:12:15.947 --> 01:12:21.323
Love gives you a complete idea about yourself.

01:12:21.323 --> 01:12:28.655
'What am I? What problems I have?

01:12:28.655 --> 01:12:35.156
Why do I create problems? Why do I get into problems?'

01:12:35.198 --> 01:12:42.364
You'll be amazed that love has such a powerful light in it,

01:12:42.405 --> 01:12:48.697
that it is the truth and it is the knowledge.

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:54.114
Though I don't know if I am to blame anyone in this world

01:12:54.114 --> 01:13:01.739
who are not a realized soul, I will not -- and a fully realized soul, I will not --

01:13:01.781 --> 01:13:08.989
because there is no light in their life.They can't see themselves

01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:13.156
and they can't see others. So what's the use of blaming them,

01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:19.447
blaming this community, that community or this country or that country? What is the use?

01:13:19.447 --> 01:13:32.614
And this love is universal. It has nothing to do with any particular type

01:13:32.655 --> 01:13:36.697
or particular style. It's universal.

01:13:36.739 --> 01:13:40.364
That is why Sahaja Yoga is universal.

01:13:40.405 --> 01:13:46.906
It is spreading everywhere. I want you to enjoy that love.

01:13:46.906 --> 01:13:52.614
Only example I'll give you, a grandmother and a grandchild.

01:13:52.655 --> 01:14:00.198
They have a relationship — at least in India, I know. of tremendous love.

01:14:00.198 --> 01:14:07.739
For them, the grandchild is everything and the grandmother is everything.

01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:13.489
They just love each other. Whatever the grandchild may do,

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:16.363
whatever the grandmother may do, it's all right.

01:14:16.363 --> 01:14:21.739
It's a kind of a tremendous experience of elivage (elevation).

01:14:21.739 --> 01:14:28.156
You feel elevated and you enjoy that love.

01:14:28.156 --> 01:14:33.614
If there is no purity in love, you can never, never enjoy love.

01:14:33.655 --> 01:14:41.323
So I would request you to find out that ocean in your head

01:14:41.363 --> 01:14:47.614
in the Sahasrara, which is being filled by your heart.

01:14:47.614 --> 01:14:56.655
Do you know Heart and Sahasrara are very much in relationship with each other?

01:14:56.655 --> 01:15:07.114
Their style is such that if somebody's head is not all right, the heart won't be all right.

01:15:07.156 --> 01:15:11.156
If the heart is not all right, his head won't be all right.

01:15:11.198 --> 01:15:15.281
But is more reflection from the head to the heart.

01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:22.364
They say that thereґs genes are bad or this, nothing of the kind.

01:15:22.405 --> 01:15:26.906
After Sahaja Yoga, your genes are changed

01:15:26.947 --> 01:15:37.114
you are changed; everything is changed now. So your brain is filled with nothing but light.

01:15:37.114 --> 01:15:44.198
Your heart is filled with light and you are just

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:48.530
bouncing with love, all the time with humour,

01:15:48.572 --> 01:15:53.363
with loving care. Every day, I mean, it's so different.

01:15:53.363 --> 01:16:02.822
But that you have achieved now. Now you have got it. So just enjoy that.

01:16:02.822 --> 01:16:11.323
Then the caste system and the fundamentalism, that, the greed and jealousies

01:16:11.363 --> 01:16:17.198
and competition an all, they all drop, useless things.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:25.073
But if you have the jungle of nonsense in your mind,

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:29.156
then all kinds of animals can creep in.

01:16:29.198 --> 01:16:37.572
To purify yourself with love, cleanse yourself with love.

01:16:37.572 --> 01:16:47.073
Look at every position, everything, with love and you will be amazed how you will find it easier

01:16:47.114 --> 01:16:52.281
not to dominate, not control, not to despise,

01:16:52.281 --> 01:17:00.572
not to say things which are not(?) wrong. It's such a correcting thing, love is,

01:17:00.614 --> 01:17:10.239
extremely correcting and extremely joy-giving that you will be amazed at yourself,

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:12.447
how you are managing things.

01:17:12.447 --> 01:17:17.489
I knew of many like that.

01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:24.447
There was a Sahaja Yogi who never used to talk to his own uncle, never.

01:17:24.447 --> 01:17:32.697
And he said, 'Somehow, I hate him.' 'But why?' 'I don't know why, I hate him.'

01:17:32.739 --> 01:17:41.447
And then he went to a race course and there he saw his uncle coming.

01:17:41.447 --> 01:17:44.281
He rushed and he just hugged him.

01:17:44.281 --> 01:17:51.363
Uncle started looking, 'Now what does he want? Why is he doing? What is it?' in his mind.

01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:57.239
'Why is he wanting to love me like this?' He couldn't understand.

01:17:57.281 --> 01:18:08.323
When it happened, you know, that he couldn't explain that he'd become a Sahaja Yogi or anything.

01:18:08.323 --> 01:18:13.363
So the uncle asked, 'What do you want now?' He said,

01:18:13.363 --> 01:18:15.989
'Nothing. I love you, that's all.'

01:18:15.989 --> 01:18:26.697
It's such a nice thing to do it. It's such a nice thing to say.

01:18:26.739 --> 01:18:35.822
There should be no greed in it, no -- any plan behind it,

01:18:35.864 --> 01:18:43.198
just it's a feeling of an ocean which touches every shore

01:18:43.239 --> 01:18:50.031
and there it makes a sound, beautiful sound of love.

01:18:50.073 --> 01:19:01.156
And then the waves return back. Continuously it is flowing and continuously it is working out, never tired.

01:19:01.156 --> 01:19:07.530
I know in the Kali Yuga, to be born and to do this work

01:19:07.572 --> 01:19:12.655
is a very difficult task, but, to Me, it was not.

01:19:12.697 --> 01:19:14.864
Whatever happened,

01:19:14.906 --> 01:19:18.114
whatever people troubled Me, howsoever,

01:19:18.156 --> 01:19:28.947
I was working it out, out of this flow of love. Went round every place,

01:19:28.989 --> 01:19:32.405
wherever is possible, whenever it is possible,

01:19:32.405 --> 01:19:35.822
whatever may be My health or anything,

01:19:35.864 --> 01:19:41.405
I was least bothered and I have enjoyed all of you very much. I have enjoyed.

01:19:41.447 --> 01:19:45.281
There have been one or two horrible people -- doesn't matter.

01:19:45.323 --> 01:19:51.739
So when you have — saying all these things about Me, only tears come into My eyes.

01:19:51.739 --> 01:19:58.405
I don't know what else to say. I mean, it is something I would like you to do,

01:19:58.405 --> 01:20:03.572
you to get it, this kind of life where you just flow with your love.

01:20:03.614 --> 01:20:09.215
May God bless you very much.
