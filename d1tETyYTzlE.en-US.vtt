WEBVTT

00:07.400 --> 00:12.800
Today we have assembled here

00:13.320 --> 00:18.120
to worship Shri Ganesha,

00:21.160 --> 00:27.680
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

00:33.400 --> 00:41.760
He is the ocean of innocence.

00:42.200 --> 00:53.760
And though He is such a young, little boy,

00:55.280 --> 01:00.000
He can fight the whole world,

01:02.600 --> 01:10.800
He can destroy all the negativity.

01:10.960 --> 01:16.080
That’s the sign of innocence.¶

01:19.880 --> 01:22.480
There have been stories

01:22.640 --> 01:27.160
that children who have fallen from a very great height

01:27.600 --> 01:31.920
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

01:34.080 --> 01:42.480
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

01:43.480 --> 01:48.040
that it doesn’t harm anyone

01:48.480 --> 01:53.400
who is not to be harmed.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.160
It has all the wisdom of the world,

01:58.320 --> 02:01.920
all the understanding of the world;

02:02.320 --> 02:09.920
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

02:10.520 --> 02:15.080
the world, the whole world

02:15.240 --> 02:21.360
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

02:21.520 --> 02:24.640
might not have worshiped innocence so much,

02:24.800 --> 02:27.680
but they all stand,

02:27.840 --> 02:32.640
stand up against anybody who tries

02:32.800 --> 02:38.560
to harm the innocence.¶

02:40.040 --> 02:47.720
You can see in your own lives around you,

02:47.880 --> 02:51.680
anybody tries to trouble children,

02:51.840 --> 02:56.040
all of the them, whatever they are,

02:56.200 --> 02:58.760
whatever they are coming from,

02:58.920 --> 03:01.760
whatever maybe their nationality,

03:01.920 --> 03:04.240
they all jump,

03:04.400 --> 03:11.200
all jump to control and to safeguard that child.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.280
What is it?

03:14.440 --> 03:16.800
What is it within us

03:16.960 --> 03:21.360
that makes us so very conscious

03:21.560 --> 03:26.320
to protect the innocence?¶

03:27.720 --> 03:32.720
It’s really a shame,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.440
a great shame for us,

03:35.600 --> 03:38.720
when we find in this world

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
that innocence is under attack.

03:43.200 --> 03:49.120
Anything else can be tolerated.

03:49.560 --> 03:54.680
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

03:54.840 --> 04:01.480
those who have no malice,

04:02.040 --> 04:09.720
who are living like little children, I should say,

04:10.800 --> 04:14.840
if they are attacked by anyone,

04:17.200 --> 04:22.960
- not that the whole world reacts to that –

04:24.400 --> 04:29.720
but every one of them

04:29.880 --> 04:35.560
cannot bear any innocent person

04:35.720 --> 04:40.280
or ‘innocent being’ being harmed.¶

04:40.760 --> 04:46.480
We don’t realise that within us

04:47.720 --> 04:53.760
there is the ocean of love

04:54.080 --> 05:00.360
and ocean of understanding for children.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.480
Why? Why should it be?

05:03.680 --> 05:09.440
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

05:10.520 --> 05:13.480
Especially for innocence?

05:13.760 --> 05:15.480
There are people

05:15.640 --> 05:20.240
who are always attacking innocent people,

05:20.400 --> 05:23.480
innocent children, there are.

05:23.680 --> 05:29.680
But no-one wants to support them.

05:30.480 --> 05:37.000
No-one thinks that it’s proper to ill-treat children.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.600
And those who have done this have to suffer.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.400
They all suffer as a reaction.¶

05:47.280 --> 05:49.520
What is it within us

05:49.680 --> 05:54.000
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

05:54.160 --> 05:58.320
against innocence?

05:58.480 --> 06:02.040
For example if there is a regular war,

06:02.200 --> 06:04.840
and if there are people fighting;

06:05.000 --> 06:11.480
in a regular war, they don’t have much sympathy.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.760
In the world also, they say “Alright,

06:14.920 --> 06:19.120
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

06:19.280 --> 06:26.480
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.320
That’s what human beings have.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.120
Within themselves they have the power,

06:34.280 --> 06:37.880
power of Shri Ganesha,

06:38.400 --> 06:46.960
which gives you that feeling, that capacity,

06:47.120 --> 06:55.640
that understanding that you have to protect innocent,

06:55.840 --> 07:00.840
innocent children, innocent people.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.080
And the whole world can rise against all such people

07:06.240 --> 07:10.480
who are trying to kill the innocent.

07:10.680 --> 07:16.920
There cannot be any doubt.

07:17.080 --> 07:22.840
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.680
or criticize such a thing,

07:25.840 --> 07:31.080
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.¶

07:32.080 --> 07:41.920
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

07:42.080 --> 07:45.240
and can give up anything,

07:45.400 --> 07:52.400
but they cannot give up the feeling they have for innocence.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.600
It’s very remarkable.

07:55.760 --> 08:02.000
We don’t realize how much there is this ocean

08:02.160 --> 08:07.320
of protection and love for the innocent.

08:08.320 --> 08:13.000
What attracts the greatest strength

08:13.160 --> 08:18.960
is when we see an innocent person,

08:19.120 --> 08:23.600
innocent children, are under attack.

08:23.760 --> 08:27.400
That’s the beauty of human beings.

08:27.600 --> 08:31.920
Of course there are many human beings, who can be cruel,

08:32.080 --> 08:36.520
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

08:36.840 --> 08:44.600
But when it comes to children, and to innocent people,

08:44.760 --> 08:51.320
everyone feels his responsibility.¶

08:53.760 --> 08:58.680
It’s difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

08:58.840 --> 09:07.480
because they have a kind of an understanding

09:09.240 --> 09:13.280
that they are something great,

09:13.440 --> 09:16.040
that they understand everything,

09:16.200 --> 09:19.120
that they can analyze everything,

09:19.280 --> 09:21.400
and they could be crooks,

09:21.520 --> 09:23.400
they could be aggressive,

09:23.520 --> 09:26.240
they could be troublesome,

09:26.400 --> 09:28.800
they could be anything,

09:28.960 --> 09:32.320
and they can give explanation for that, doesn’t matter –

09:32.480 --> 09:39.160
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

09:39.440 --> 09:43.840
and they can never be honored

09:44.000 --> 09:46.400
for the thing they are doing.¶

09:46.560 --> 09:52.080
For us, the Sahaja Yogi, the Sahaj culture is

09:52.240 --> 09:55.080
to respect your innocence.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.680
You might feel a little bit cheated,

09:57.840 --> 10:01.600
you might feel a little bit dominated,

10:01.760 --> 10:04.480
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

10:04.640 --> 10:09.320
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

10:09.480 --> 10:14.160
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

10:14.400 --> 10:20.600
They should not feel dejected if they are being used,

10:20.760 --> 10:28.400
insulted, tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.520
They should not try to destroy

10:31.680 --> 10:37.680
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.360
Automatically it will work.

10:40.520 --> 10:48.840
You will be amazed that when innocence is challenged,

10:49.200 --> 10:55.880
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.¶

10:56.040 --> 10:59.640
An example of this is the recent war,

10:59.800 --> 11:03.440
so-called war, of America.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.800
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong –

11:08.960 --> 11:14.600
have been tortured, have been killed.

11:14.760 --> 11:20.760
At that time, all over the world,

11:20.920 --> 11:25.720
it’s a big support for them.

11:25.880 --> 11:32.840
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

11:33.080 --> 11:43.240
is anxious to look after those who have done this crime.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.680
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

11:46.840 --> 11:50.000
they may not be belonging to the same country,

11:50.160 --> 11:54.240
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

11:54.400 --> 11:56.760
but at this moment,

11:56.920 --> 12:01.160
who does not take the side of the innocence

12:01.320 --> 12:07.800
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.320
Once for all they will learn a lesson

12:11.480 --> 12:16.480
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.¶

12:16.600 --> 12:19.400
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

12:19.560 --> 12:25.280
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

12:25.440 --> 12:30.720
We should not, in no way punish them.

12:30.880 --> 12:36.400
Our main achievement

12:36.600 --> 12:42.080
should be that loving attention for children.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.760
All over the world,

12:44.920 --> 12:50.560
whether he belongs to your family or to some other family,

12:50.720 --> 13:02.680
or has some sort of detached attention with you,

13:03.000 --> 13:08.680
still because he’s a child, he’s innocent,

13:08.840 --> 13:12.600
the innocence within itself,

13:12.760 --> 13:18.760
your own innocence, will try to protect.¶

13:18.920 --> 13:21.880
It’s very surprising

13:22.040 --> 13:26.480
how people take to sacrificing their lives

13:26.600 --> 13:34.600
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

13:34.760 --> 13:39.200
Children should never be attacked.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.960
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.040
But you shouldn’t waste your energy on something

13:47.200 --> 13:53.120
that is extremely inauspicious,

13:53.320 --> 13:56.160
extremely cruel

13:56.320 --> 14:02.200
and extremely ugly.¶

14:02.480 --> 14:05.360
If you cannot love children,

14:05.480 --> 14:08.000
you cannot love anything.

14:08.160 --> 14:12.840
I have not come across anyone so far who says

14:13.000 --> 14:16.120
that they don’t love children – luckily!

14:16.280 --> 14:20.920
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”.

14:21.080 --> 14:24.240
Why? Why do you love flowers?

14:24.400 --> 14:27.400
Because they are innocent.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.720
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.720
You love nature – why?

14:33.880 --> 14:36.640
Because it is innocent.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.080
But the greatest innocence

14:39.240 --> 14:48.360
is seen among human beings who are Sahaja Yogi!¶
