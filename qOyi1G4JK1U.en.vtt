00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.880
With Sahaja Yoga, you can do many many things,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.200
but you must know what you can do.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:27.920
For that, Krishna is a very good example.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.480
He started Sahaj culture.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.400
Culture, I’m saying.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:43.760
He didn’t give Realization to anyone,&nbsp;
but he gave the idea of Sahaj culture.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.080
Now, what’s the meaning of the Sahaj culture?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:54.160
It’s culture, is something&nbsp;
that is, you are groomed,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.840
you are brought up in a very natural manner,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.960
that you develop a culture.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:16.000
It’s more like a child-like,&nbsp;
simple innocent behaviour.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.160
It is Shri Krishna’s introduction of&nbsp;
idea of pure joy, ‘Nirmal Ananda’,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:39.040
which came as a great relief to Indian people

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.916
because they were following Shri Ramachandra.

00:01:47.154 --> 00:01:50.960
I asked somebody, “What about your&nbsp;
bathing, why didn’t you take bath?”

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.040
He said, “These days it is&nbsp;
out of fashion to take bath.”

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800
[Laughter]

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.560
Everything seems to be out of fashion,&nbsp;
whatever is in fashion is horrid.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.120
“It’s very fashionable,” is another thing&nbsp;
people say, “it’s very fashionable,”

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.494
and whatever is fashionable looks so ugly to Me.

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:15.243
Now if you have to take to the Sahaj culture,

00:02:15.243 --> 00:02:19.149
you have to know that we have to&nbsp;
have a discipline in our life.

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.720
We have to have education,&nbsp;
we have to have a place,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.029
we have to have a position in the society.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.160
Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:39.119
somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting&nbsp;
there and just doing our tapasya.

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:45.005
Tapasya is here where you live.

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:51.840
Otherwise if you say that, “All&nbsp;
right, we have to go to Himalayas

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.840
and there we have to do Tapasya in the cold winds.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.040
Oh, that’s very good.”

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.880
Because that looks like&nbsp;
something, you see, you’ll have 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.640
might have a name, or something like that.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.440
But tapasya is here, the detachment&nbsp;
has to be worked out here.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.360
You get involved into all these things,&nbsp;
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.543
the amount of involvement you&nbsp;
have in the things which existed

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:25.331
in gross form, they have become subtler

00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:30.787
and you are still bound by&nbsp;
them, there’s no freedom.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.200
And that’s why when you see&nbsp;
something absurd happening,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.880
you see something funny happening in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.400
it’s just the symptom of that&nbsp;
thing becoming subtler within us

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.920
and is expressing itself.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.200
Like sometimes you may not see fire but it exists

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.520
and suddenly you find a blast.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.360
So, transformation of course means evolution,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.960
it also means that whatever basis you&nbsp;
had, you have to evolve out of it.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:19.920
Like a flower blossoming&nbsp;
and then becoming the fruit,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:27.760
but it has to drop out many things.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.741
And then with the nature one&nbsp;
has to see – such a unison.

00:04:35.172 --> 00:04:41.414
In the nature if you see, it sucks the water.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:45.529
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.918
Then it becomes a cloud and then the cloud waits,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.640
because the leaves drop out.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.778
In the winter time, they nourish&nbsp;
the tree with their nitrogen;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.560
when the time is ready,&nbsp;
then these clouds pour down

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.200
and again nourish this.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.640
Such a complete balance is in the nature.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.560
If it was not, I tell you they&nbsp;
would, we would have said,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.625
“all bald-headed lands here.”

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:39.184
Like now I saw some boy in New Zealand

00:05:40.426 --> 00:05:43.638
Who is really about to be dead,

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:49.631
and when he came back I found the attitude towards him was not kind,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.617
as it should have been.

00:05:55.976 --> 00:06:01.860
But this is the best chance– when you should see how you can practice your compassion.

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:05.989
We talk of compassion, compassion.

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:11.645
Now let us see how we can practice our compassion when this boy is so sick.

00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:14.800
On the contrary, everybody was harsh on him.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.960
They were passing remarks at&nbsp;
him, doing things like that.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.560
Because we have to have compassion.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.120
Now Mother has said, “We have to have compassion,”

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.640
well now where do we have our compassion?

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.520
On the walls?

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.240
Where do we use our compassion?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.360
Where do we use our compassion?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.040
So “Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced,”&nbsp;
doesn’t mean that you sit down

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.880
with my photograph all the&nbsp;
time, doesn’t mean that.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.480
It means you practice&nbsp;
compassion; you practice that.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.080
Then you have to practice love.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.200
Now how do you practice love with others?

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.000
If you love someone, what do you do?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.160
You try to please that person.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.760
Small things can make people very happy.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.840
I know, you all try to please me very much.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.360
You’ll give me presents.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.760
You’ll find out things which are good for me.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.960
You’ll go out of the way buy sweet flowers for me,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.880
beautiful things you do to please me.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.560
I am over-pleased, I must tell you.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.720
But I am more pleased, much more pleased

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.320
if you understand collectivity&nbsp;
and try to please each other.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.200
Such a person pleases me the&nbsp;
most, that the attention is more

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.240
on pleasing each other.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.560
As soon as you decide you have to please others,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.760
your tongue will become different.&nbsp;
It will become a sweet thing.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.200
The tongue which was like a pair of scissors

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.440
becomes such a beautiful thing of honey.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.080
Then you talk little but you really pour honey

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.280
on another person, and another&nbsp;
person really enjoys it.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.600
So now to practice love: where do you practice?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.960
Ask yourself a question,&nbsp;
“Where do I practice love?

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.360
What do I love?”

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.800
We love our house, we love our&nbsp;
photographs, our decorations,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.960
everything, “But do I&nbsp;
practice this love on my wife,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:37.920
or on my husband, or on other Sahaja yogis?”

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.560
In our Sahaj culture, we&nbsp;
have to practice compassion

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:51.040
and love, and thirdly we&nbsp;
have to practice patience.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.320
I know some children are&nbsp;
maybe little more mischievous,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.960
some are less mischievous.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.440
Maybe some people are very talkative,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.960
sometimes really they give me also headache;

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.040
they go on talking, talking,&nbsp;
talking, talking, so much!

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.520
Sometimes I think it’s good&nbsp;
because it’s a rest for my mouth –

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.440
one way of looking at it.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.840
Another way of looking at it&nbsp;
is – just switch off your mind,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.400
let him talk, take it out whatever he wants to do.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.360
Once he is finished with it and fagged out

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.880
then he won’t bother you much&nbsp;
and also he’ll feel satisfied

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.640
that somebody has listened to his prattles.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.680
So, patience is needed and patience is needed

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.240
in such a way that others&nbsp;
should see your patience.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.240
Yesterday for example, I was sitting for about

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.760
I think three hours shaking&nbsp;
hands with all sorts of people

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.720
and all types of problems,&nbsp;
and the person who came last,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:07.440
he said, “Looking at your patience,&nbsp;
I developed my own patience.”

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.760
And love gives you patience.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.520
This love nourishes you.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.320
I’m telling you, it’s&nbsp;
absolutely down-to-earth method:

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.120
here I’ve not mentioned that you trust God,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.120
I’m just saying trust yourself.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.920
[It’s] absolutely down-to-earth because&nbsp;
we are talking about your brain.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.960
Now we have been saying that&nbsp;
we have to forgive everyone,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.640
but we don’t practice that.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.760
Small, small things like mad people remember.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.080
I mean only I have heard that&nbsp;
a snake has this capacity

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.560
to remember if somebody has hurt him.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.640
But here I find human beings&nbsp;
have no less capacity.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.720
Whatever has happened thirteen years back,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.840
fifteen years back, they all&nbsp;
remember each and every thing:

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.360
whatever has hurt them.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.280
But how they have hurt others they don’t remember!

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.040
How they have been nasty to&nbsp;
others they don’t remember.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.560
Because this is a human&nbsp;
mind which has got the ego,

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.480
it can go on hurting others,&nbsp;
it doesn’t feel anything,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.219
and the superego which goes&nbsp;
on receiving all the hurts

00:11:22.219 --> 00:11:24.444
and always complaining about it.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:37.120
There must be 25-30% of people&nbsp;
who may not be on this line.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.000
Like I have seen I was travelling&nbsp;
by the taxi the driver asked me

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.120
if I had Marlborough cigarettes&nbsp;
or another fellow asked me

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.000
something like that.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.080
But they are very few people.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.240
And such people have to&nbsp;
still evolve to your level.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.360
But when there is vacuum all&nbsp;
kinds of things are sucked in.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:12.720
I feel there are many things&nbsp;
from the West are sucked in also

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:20.640
like drugs like this mad&nbsp;
music AIDs and other diseases

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:27.040
but the worst is the Freud’s ideas&nbsp;
of free love which are very much

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.240
malignant.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.680
I think the communist government&nbsp;
did not want to be bothered

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.760
about your morality at all.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:42.000
They wanted to enjoy their power&nbsp;
so they said do what you like,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.080
we don’t care as long as you&nbsp;
allow us to have the power.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.440
So this free love business has&nbsp;
gone too far also in Russia

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.880
and in Ukraine.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:01.440
But those who are on the Mahalakshmi&nbsp;
Principle have to know one thing

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:09.440
that morality is the basis of your ascent.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.757
That is the strength of Shri Ganesha.

00:13:13.757 --> 00:13:26.000
If this strength is not manifested&nbsp;
one will never go up to a point

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.600
which is desired.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.720
So in our sahaj culture, we have to understand

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:41.200
that morality is extremely&nbsp;
important for Mahalakshmi principle.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:51.760
Because of the western culture just&nbsp;
coming into this vacuum is very dangerous

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.080
I have to tell you, again and again, be careful.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:06.240
Many people who came to Sahaja yoga&nbsp;
not only in Russia have fallen off

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.680
because of their immoral attachments.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.280
But in a very sahaj manner, you can be moral.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.280
You do not have to force&nbsp;
yourself or compel yourself

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:31.280
but spontaneously you will manifest&nbsp;
morality in your lifestyle.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.320
In India we have some immoral people no doubt

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:45.280
but it is not their lifestyle&nbsp;
so some people may be immoral ?

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:53.760
They are[Inaudible] but they are&nbsp;
not the whole of the society.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.200
Moreover, the responsibility is more&nbsp;
on women who respect their chastity.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:07.200
If a woman is moral then the children become moral

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:14.240
and the husband also comes to&nbsp;
morality but if the woman is immoral

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.600
then the whole society is finished.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:24.160
So the responsibility of keeping&nbsp;
the social balance in society

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.040
is entirely of women.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:37.200
It means you have to be alert as to see&nbsp;
that you do not deviate from the path

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:45.120
of balance of Mahalakshmi into&nbsp;
something that is destroying.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:55.440
All the prophets have created a sense&nbsp;
of balance, righteousness, of dharma.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000
The reason is that they were&nbsp;
in the Void in the Bhavasagara.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.960
Moreover the more rigid is the&nbsp;
religion, like Catholic or Islamic,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.560
then people tend to be immoral&nbsp;
because they are suppressed

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:26.560
so they want to take out their oppression&nbsp;
in this way that they just go amok.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:36.360
So we should also understand that&nbsp;
the sense of morality is given to us

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.680
it’s already innately placed within us.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.520
Even if you see small girls or small boys

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.680
they have a great sense of shame.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.760
This innate sense keeps the children&nbsp;
innocent and they do not like

00:16:53.760 --> 00:17:00.480
things which are repulsive&nbsp;
or destructive spontaneously.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:06.676
But as you grow suddenly this&nbsp;
Mahalakshmi principle starts

00:17:06.676 --> 00:17:11.127
moving away from the central path.

00:17:14.144 --> 00:17:20.400
Very Surprising and so deeply, when I walked out of&nbsp;
the room, they all came after Me.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.760
That you don’t see in western&nbsp;
countries, that kind of a thing.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.240
All of them walked after Me, ran after Me,

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.440
they wanted to give their addresses and&nbsp;
they wanted Me to go to their country

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.840
and this and that. I said: “All right, I’ll come!”

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:40.400
We took their addresses, even&nbsp;
from Romania, everywhere.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.520
And they went back.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.880
And within 8 days one could trigger out the thing.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:55.840
It worked, because they were so deep,&nbsp;
because they were so much equipped

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.000
to trigger the happening.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.720
That’s how they triggered their&nbsp;
country and how they worked it out.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.280
So, if we live on a superficial&nbsp;
level of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.520
then we cannot do much for&nbsp;
ourselves nor for the country

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.080
and it’s just a wasteful&nbsp;
life, neither here nor there.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.800
Is like a seed, which is sprouted&nbsp;
and has not grown into the tree.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.360
So first of all we have to learn that&nbsp;
we have to become very deep people,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.680
very deep, you must teach our depth.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.960
I’ve heard that people come to Pujas and things

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.760
and their main interest is in food.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.040
As soon as the Puja is over&nbsp;
you just rush for food.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.000
How can you?

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.960
After Puja you get into a mood,&nbsp;
after meditation you get into a mood

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.400
of meditating nature and you just sit down

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.440
and you can’t get up, because&nbsp;
you were fallen into the well

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.360
and sort of thing happens.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.320
How can you just get up and&nbsp;
walk for cakes or things.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.520
We though can’t think about.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.400
So then judge yourself, how&nbsp;
you are, how far you are.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.480
You have to work out your vibrations&nbsp;
because you are going to create

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:16.400
that beautiful vision in this country,&nbsp;
for your children, for yourself

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.760
and for the whole country,&nbsp;
ultimately for the whole world.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.400
But if you do not take it&nbsp;
up seriously, just by the way,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.680
Sahaja Yoga is just by the&nbsp;
way, it doesn’t work out.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.600
It has to be way of life.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.800
And in everything that you do&nbsp;
it has to be a Sahaj culture.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.920
And in Sahaj culture so many&nbsp;
things are to be understood

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.440
that this is natural, this is real&nbsp;
and we have to accept the way it is.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.520
So many things are happening the West,&nbsp;
which I think are just destructive,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.080
absolutely destructive to the society.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.793
The society is not at all looked after, here.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:12.160
The highest personality can sacrifice&nbsp;
anything and can give up anything,

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:20.400
but they cannot give up the&nbsp;
feeling they have for innocence.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.560
It’s very remarkable.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:31.600
We don’t realise how much there is&nbsp;
this ocean of protection and love

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.120
for the innocent.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:46.080
What attracts the greatest strength&nbsp;
is when we see an innocent person,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.440
innocent children, are under attack.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.480
That’s the beauty of human beings.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.880
Of course there are many&nbsp;
human beings who can be cruel,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.760
who are, I would say, I call&nbsp;
them devils – maybe, maybe.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:11.760
But when it comes to children,&nbsp;
and to innocent people,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:18.880
everyone feels his responsibility.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.680
It’s difficult for normal&nbsp;
human beings to be innocent

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:39.318
because they have a kind of an&nbsp;
understanding that they are something great,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.345
that they understand everything,&nbsp;
that they can analyse everything,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.320
and they could be crooks,&nbsp;
they could be aggressive,

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.760
they could be troublesome,&nbsp;
they could be anything 

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.440
and they can give explanation&nbsp;
for that, doesn’t matter 

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.240
but still, on the whole,&nbsp;
they can never be respected

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:12.273
and they can never be honoured&nbsp;
for the thing they are doing.

00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:21.146
For us, the Sahaja Yogi, the Sahaj&nbsp;
culture is to respect your innocence.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.142
You might feel a little bit cheated,&nbsp;
you might feel a little bit dominated,

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.409
you might feel a little bit disgraced,&nbsp;
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.160
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.769
They should not feel dejected&nbsp;
if they are being used,

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.470
insulted, tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.717
They should not try to destroy&nbsp;
the innocence of other people,

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.069
of anyone.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.392
Automatically it will work.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:14.685
You will be amazed that when&nbsp;
innocence is challenged,

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.655
all the goodness of the world&nbsp;
comes to the rescue of that.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:30.480
An example of this is the recent&nbsp;
war, so-called war, of America.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.760
Where innocent people they&nbsp;
had done nothing wrong 

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.404
have been tortured, have been killed.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:52.960
At that time, all over the world,&nbsp;
it’s a big support for them.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.920
Every country, whether it&nbsp;
believes in those people or not,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:09.067
is anxious to look after (for)&nbsp;
those who have done this crime.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.680
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.040
they may not be belonging to the same country,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.200
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:28.080
but at this moment, who does not&nbsp;
take the side of the innocence

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:34.880
will be singled out and will be&nbsp;
destroyed  no doubt about it.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:41.755
Once and for all they will learn a lesson&nbsp;
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.

00:24:45.667 --> 00:24:53.600
So you see,it’s a kind of a&nbsp;
great collectivity of housewives

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.280
that has to work out.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.360
They have common problems, they&nbsp;
have to face their children,

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.720
they have to look after&nbsp;
the household, everything 

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.000
I mean there are so many common&nbsp;
problems with the housewives.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.280
And the housewife also knows&nbsp;
all little, little things.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.120
You see, men at least in India don’t know much

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.880
because they live in the air, I think.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:27.200
So the women have more sense in this respect,

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.425
for small, small things they are quite aware.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:39.360
It’s very interesting sometimes,&nbsp;
the men commit mistakes

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.360
of such a great humor.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.720
Because they do not deal with day-to-day life,

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:53.680
with all the problems of daily life.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:59.760
On one side the woman, housewife,&nbsp;
has to deal with the daily life.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:06.000
On the other side she has to look&nbsp;
after her family, her children.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.920
Also, poor thing, she is&nbsp;
responsible for the society.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.960
She has to maintain the society.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:21.120
In a country where women are&nbsp;
sensible and are matured,

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:27.040
you will be amazed that they&nbsp;
become extremely good families,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.600
good societies and good children.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.568
That’s why I must say, India is a very&nbsp;
good country of very good society.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:43.200
This is come out of the housewives,&nbsp;
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.600
who have done all the work that is important

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.800
as far as the culture is concerned.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:59.600
This kind of thing is very much in&nbsp;
India and with that, what you find

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:07.120
that the people respect, respect the housewives.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.080
So respecting the housewife&nbsp;
is the most important thing

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.200
in our Sahaj culture.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:21.760
But that doesn’t mean that the&nbsp;
women should try to dominate

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.320
and trouble and fight with the husbands.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:35.840
But it means a very important position&nbsp;
in the society, of a housewife.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:42.720
She is treated as a something a, like a devi only.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.680
But she too has to be a devi.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:52.000
If you treat her like a doormat,&nbsp;
then children will never respect her.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:59.280
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,&nbsp;
the children won’t respect the mother

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.240
and there will be no impact&nbsp;
of the mother on the children.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:11.520
As a result the children get wayward,&nbsp;
and in the societies or in the countries

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.520
where the mother is not respected,&nbsp;
you will find the children become

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:24.380
extremely dominating, hot-tempered&nbsp;
and horribly uncollective.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:36.640
One should not try to look&nbsp;
younger and just all the time

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:43.458
make your life miserable by trying&nbsp;
to keep your husband attached to you

00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:49.040
because by that you will lose&nbsp;
your powers, your Shakti,

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.800
but if your husband is a man of&nbsp;
character then you must respect him

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:59.200
and support him in every way and&nbsp;
tolerate him as far as possible.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.061
Yesterday I saw many ladies have cut their hair,

00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:08.441
please do not play into the&nbsp;
hands of these entrepreneurs,

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.514
they know how to befool you.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.720
I have seen horrible things&nbsp;
happening because these entrepreneurs

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:24.880
try to entice by advertisement.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.880
Recently in Paris they said we&nbsp;
should have six inches of skirts

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:38.320
and nowhere we could get long skirts.&nbsp;
Imagine in all these cold countries

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.240
so many got varicose veins.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:50.000
They start styles for hair, for body, for&nbsp;
faces, they start all kinds of nonsense

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.080
but Sahaja Yoginis should&nbsp;
understand what are they up to,

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.840
you should not fall into their traps at all.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.160
So you are the Goddess of the&nbsp;
family, you have the Shakti

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.560
and you have to be very careful.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.360
Moreover you are Sahaja Yoginis so&nbsp;
you shouldn’t allow your Sahasrara

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:18.000
to be touched by anyone and your&nbsp;
power comes from your chastity.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.360
Thousands of women in India committed suicide

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.360
because they didn’t want&nbsp;
any man to touch their body.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.800
Now you are in Sahaj culture and in Sahaj culture

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.400
we have to behave in a very&nbsp;
dignified mature manner.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:40.480
When you are small girls you are also Goddesses,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.680
that time you are innocent, then you get married,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:52.000
it’s a very big thing that you are&nbsp;
a married woman is very auspicious.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.440
Then after marriage you have children,&nbsp;
is even greater honour for you

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.160
because you are mothers.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:12.480
We are not actresses, we are mothers and&nbsp;
you should be proud of being a mother

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.720
and you should be proud of your children.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:24.560
Then you become grandmothers, I think&nbsp;
this is a very great achievement

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.400
and you should feel very proud of your age

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.960
that you are a grandmother.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:37.767
If you will go on struggling for&nbsp;
looking young you’ll look very old.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.440
You see your Mother is seventy years&nbsp;
of age and I don’t look my age,

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.532
that’s what they say.

00:31:45.532 --> 00:31:51.687
I have never bothered about&nbsp;
my looks, I have no time,

00:31:51.858 --> 00:31:59.218
I have so many children and I&nbsp;
am very proud of my age also.

00:31:59.218 --> 00:32:05.520
With age you grow, you mature, you are wiser,

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.680
then you have all the assets of your personality.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:16.640
If you really respect your age people&nbsp;
will come to you for advice, help,

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.134
and then you can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.520
There are so many complications&nbsp;
with these entrepreneurs

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.480
the way they try to exploit women.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.434
May God Bless you all.
