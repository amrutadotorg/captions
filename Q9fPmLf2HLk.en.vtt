00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:09.108
We have had Bhairava Puja in Belgium

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.236
and now I thought today let us have Mahakali Puja

00:00:15.436 --> 00:00:22.379
because yesterday's experience, last night's experience,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.564
was the work of Mahakali.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:34.448
She has a double role all the time, she's at two extremes.

00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:45.301
On one side she is full of joy, giver of joy,

00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:51.670
she's very happy when she sees her disciple are joyous.

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.355
Joy is her own quality, is her energy,

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:59.061
and yesterday you must have been amazed to see

00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:06.709
so many middle-aged ladies of France smiling and laughing.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.080
I'd never seen them smiling;

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.411
it's very surprising how they were so joyous

00:01:14.612 --> 00:01:20.072
and so very happy and this is the energy of Mahakali

00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:24.056
that gives you all that joy after Realization

00:01:24.257 --> 00:01:27.244
and the joy you enjoy among yourselves,

00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:31.127
all these are the qualities of Mahakali

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:35.518
and when they will read out the names of Mahakali

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:45.479
you will know how her powers manifest in Sahaja Yoga

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.307
and how it has helped you all

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:52.305
to get drenched into the Ocean of Joy.

00:01:56.947 --> 00:02:08.410
To begin with I have to tell you one thing that

00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:11.832
Mahakali Puja, when you are doing,

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:16.892
you have to feel a joy within yourself,

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.471
and joy from other Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:27.672
If you, if you cannot feel that, that means you are not yet grown

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.415
and there's some problem, maybe with your parents,

00:02:33.616 --> 00:02:36.157
maybe with your children, maybe it's family, with your country,

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:39.588
whatever it is but there's some sort of a conditioning

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:43.322
which is working out that doesn't give you that joy.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.888
And to grow into Sahaja Yoga is very important,

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.909
which I think people don't understand,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.497
even if they live in ashrams, they don't understand one thing,

00:03:00.698 --> 00:03:03.331
that you have to be collective.

00:03:04.604 --> 00:03:09.973
If you are not collective then you are thrown out, gradually.

00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:18.079
Now this Mahakali power has got seven strings you can say this,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.337
and these strings are there to throw you out

00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:25.376
into collective subconscious (next couple of words inaudible).

00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:29.655
Like as in the sitar you have seen for the resonance,

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:32.214
there are other strings also.

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.548
So once you start getting out of the collectivity

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:44.415
it is the Mahakali Herself, picks you out and starts throwing you out,

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:48.424
slowly slowly to the subconscious area

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:52.101
and where you just disappear.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.085
And all kinds of problems start,

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:00.717
I have seen this happening in every country,

00:04:00.918 --> 00:04:06.349
that people who do not attend the collective meditation.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.628
For France I have the same report

00:04:11.206 --> 00:04:17.909
and I think the people who do not grow will be thrown out.

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:23.515
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action,

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:26.543
as the Mahakali has a double action.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.145
She's extremely loving, full of joy,

00:04:29.346 --> 00:04:33.989
full of happiness and She's the one who's extremely cruel, wrathful,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.098
She's the one who's the slayer of all the demons and the evil,

00:04:38.299 --> 00:04:42.755
and those people who try to do evil.

00:04:42.956 --> 00:04:45.855
So once you are thrown out into the left side

00:04:46.074 --> 00:04:48.246
then you can imagine, you can develop any kind

00:04:48.447 --> 00:04:50.364
of left-side diseases to begin with,

00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:53.151
Mooladhara diseases are the worst,

00:04:53.352 --> 00:04:58.228
you develop diseases like mellitus, this, er, er,

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:01.442
you must have heard of the disabilities caused

00:05:01.643 --> 00:05:05.056
by the muscles getting degenerated.

00:05:05.257 --> 00:05:09.257
All muscular degeneration comes from this problem.

00:05:11.648 --> 00:05:14.398
So at any cost that must be avoided.

00:05:17.344 --> 00:05:21.440
But if you are not in the collective, if you do not understand the collective,

00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.770
and if you are out of the collective

00:05:24.986 --> 00:05:29.423
you'll be surprised that negative forces will join together

00:05:29.624 --> 00:05:32.373
and they'll pull you out.

00:05:32.573 --> 00:05:35.933
So this is one of the things that happens,

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.774
so be very careful that don't avoid the collective programmes.

00:05:46.986 --> 00:05:52.338
The, another problem about Mahakali is that,

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.267
that She's the one who gives you the feeling

00:05:56.468 --> 00:06:01.699
for your wife, for your husband,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.496
She is the one.

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:11.405
Now there also, the same problem.

00:06:11.606 --> 00:06:19.295
If both of them are alright, She's alright

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:24.154
but if She finds any one of them going astray

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:27.527
She'll throw that person out and out and out

00:06:27.727 --> 00:06:29.939
and the, another person, if that person is attached

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.986
to that person also will be thrown out. So this business of falling in love,

00:06:35.187 --> 00:06:37.736
this nonsense that we have here, that you fall in love,

00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:40.993
but the word is all right because you fall really in love.

00:06:41.194 --> 00:06:43.334
It's a real falling happens.

00:06:44.686 --> 00:06:47.445
So what happens when you start falling in love,

00:06:47.646 --> 00:06:50.758
there's a kind of a maya of this Mahakali

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:54.279
and you just get infatuated, your ego gets pampered,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.779
or something like that, or you have certain ideas of a wife

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.581
or something and then you think 'Oh, that's the one for me.'

00:07:03.308 --> 00:07:06.663
So in these cases only two things can happen;

00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:09.812
either you can be lost completely because of

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:14.079
your wife or your husband whom you adore and admire

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.669
and you, you've finished, I mean your personality is finished.

00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:23.573
Or else, the another thing which is even more serious is that,

00:07:23.774 --> 00:07:26.774
that you'll completely break forever and hate each other.

00:07:26.876 --> 00:07:31.076
That's why they say that there's a love and hate relationship.

00:07:31.277 --> 00:07:33.878
How can love be hate?

00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:40.849
But it becomes, because of the, this quality of the Goddess

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.747
that She is on one side extremely loving,

00:07:44.948 --> 00:07:48.916
extremely kind, extremely soft,

00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:51.585
she goes up to a point.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.290
And then She throws you on the other side,

00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:59.774
and that is why in these countries where people always fall in love, you see,

00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:04.747
they don't marry otherwise, unless and until they have fallen in love.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.900
In that they cross all the maryadas also.

00:08:08.837 --> 00:08:11.105
In falling in love they will marry somebody

00:08:11.306 --> 00:08:15.488
who is already married or who is, they'll carry on with somebody

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:20.141
who is not yet divorced

00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:25.098
or also they will have marriages, er, among themselves

00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:27.908
in the same household or something.

00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:30.007
All kinds of things they do and the old woman

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:33.543
marries a young man or a young, er,

00:08:33.754 --> 00:08:35.645
old man marries a young girl, like that,

00:08:35.864 --> 00:08:38.821
all nonsensical things, without any maryadas.

00:08:39.022 --> 00:08:42.274
And they do not stick together, they have no maryadas.

00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:48.657
To marry is to create a maryada, maryada of your behaviour

00:08:48.858 --> 00:08:51.442
and this is the maryada which, if you do not keep,

00:08:51.701 --> 00:08:55.718
er, keep, then this Mahakali gets into it.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:59.226
So first of all one has to be collective,

00:08:59.474 --> 00:09:00.763
the ones who are not collective,

00:09:00.982 --> 00:09:04.593
who do not attend every time a collective programme.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.312
You might give suggestions,

00:09:06.513 --> 00:09:09.020
that you would like to come for such and such thing.

00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:11.854
For example, I have already explained,

00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:14.822
that you shouldn't talk, put my,

00:09:15.023 --> 00:09:18.080
there are so many tapes which they have not, never heard.

00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:21.510
List...let them listen to my tape then go into meditation

00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:24.236
and then do the aarti and finish it off.

00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:27.454
Because these tapes are to be heard again and again.

00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:32.180
Now those who get any questions out of those tapes

00:09:32.381 --> 00:09:36.344
can, next time, discuss it before starting the tapes.

00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:41.014
That's a very good thing and that works. In India nobody speaks,

00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:45.037
they just put my tapes on or show my video,

00:09:45.238 --> 00:09:51.258
after that they just have meditation and aarti. Finished.

00:09:51.459 --> 00:09:54.493
After that nobody talks. But before starting it,

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:59.688
they do it is to talk to each other and discuss the problems

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:06.583
or discuss anything that they felt about the previous programme.

00:10:06.784 --> 00:10:09.317
Because you have not come here to marry someone

00:10:09.518 --> 00:10:12.143
or to fall in love into something.

00:10:13.541 --> 00:10:15.880
You have not come here to get after some woman

00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:19.660
because she's your wife or some man because he's your husband.

00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:23.861
You have had so many husbands and wives in previous lives.

00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:28.009
But you have come here for your ascent;

00:10:30.658 --> 00:10:32.249
and if you have come here for your ascent

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.244
you have to keep a watch. How is your mind working?

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:39.933
Supposing I say that you should have good married life,

00:10:40.134 --> 00:10:43.895
of course, I do say, you should have good married life.

00:10:44.096 --> 00:10:47.549
But not at the cost of losing your ascent.

00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:54.869
It has happened with people, we have lost a complete,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.455
I should say, a city like that.

00:10:57.656 --> 00:11:00.804
Such stupidity came, comes up over people.

00:11:02.153 --> 00:11:04.655
So be careful not to get lost,

00:11:04.856 --> 00:11:08.600
you have not come here to have only a happy married life

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:12.756
but happy married life is just one step.

00:11:12.957 --> 00:11:15.483
But if that step is taking you away

00:11:15.684 --> 00:11:20.371
from the real path of your ascent is better to be careful.

00:11:24.668 --> 00:11:29.514
Also we must understand the innocence means purity,

00:11:29.715 --> 00:11:31.969
purity of thought. As I explained yesterday

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.165
I hope you understood the meaning of purity.

00:11:35.366 --> 00:11:40.224
Purity is to be understood much more by Europeans.

00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:45.425
Very important. Specially French.

00:11:48.182 --> 00:11:50.986
Because the whole society is suffering.

00:11:52.113 --> 00:11:58.404
Society can only be pure if the family life is pure.

00:11:58.605 --> 00:12:04.521
Not only that but your relations with each other are pure.

00:12:04.722 --> 00:12:08.722
Like I was told that somebody fell in love in Ganapatipule.

00:12:08.933 --> 00:12:11.432
I mean you go for a pilgrimage.

00:12:12.378 --> 00:12:15.456
It's like you have to go to buy a sari and you

00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:20.258
end up with a shaving stick.

00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:22.094
It's that stupid.

00:12:22.295 --> 00:12:27.511
You are coming to Ganapatipule for a, for what?

00:12:28.175 --> 00:12:39.579
You are coming there for your ascent, it's a pilgrimage.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.873
But in the pilgrimage I've never heard anybody

00:12:42.086 --> 00:12:46.681
falls in love with each other and goes to marriage.

00:12:46.882 --> 00:12:51.298
So this bhoot of falling in love must be given up in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:51.499 --> 00:12:53.284
that is one of the biggest loads.

00:12:53.485 --> 00:12:57.797
And, and must understand that purity means chastity.

00:13:01.562 --> 00:13:04.720
Innocence means chastity,

00:13:04.921 --> 00:13:08.351
not only physical also mental chastity.

00:13:10.835 --> 00:13:13.433
You have to have mental chastity,

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:18.548
if you don't have mental chastity you cannot ascend.

00:13:19.369 --> 00:13:26.588
Actually in the West it is more mental that physical, is a fact.

00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:33.174
And that's why their brains (inaudible?) have gone off.

00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:37.008
And they are becoming just like, I think, potatoes now, I think.

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:40.541
Because if you go on mentally imagining

00:13:40.742 --> 00:13:43.679
and playing around and working it out this way,

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.085
it's going to be absolutely dangerous

00:13:46.286 --> 00:13:49.546
because it's all imagination, it has nothing to do with reality.

00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:52.289
The more you get into this kind of a nonsense

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.466
the more you become away from reality.

00:13:56.076 --> 00:13:58.187
That never means you should be dry,

00:13:58.388 --> 00:14:02.537
it never means you should be, er,

00:14:02.738 --> 00:14:05.483
negligent of your responsibility, does not mean.

00:14:05.684 --> 00:14:09.135
As I said, the sap...

00:14:22.485 --> 00:14:30.703
As I've said that the sap in the tree rises, all right?

00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:35.867
Then it purifies, it nourishes

00:14:36.068 --> 00:14:40.485
every part of the plant separately in a different way.

00:14:40.686 --> 00:14:45.055
Like it's a mother, so mother, father, is a father,

00:14:45.256 --> 00:14:50.615
sister, is a sister, brother, is a sister, brother is a brother.

00:14:50.816 --> 00:14:53.654
The brother-sister relations

00:14:53.855 --> 00:14:59.987
cannot become husband-wife relations. How can it be?

00:15:07.831 --> 00:15:12.747
Now what happens really is that such a confusion in the mind

00:15:12.948 --> 00:15:18.462
and it has created tremendous problems for us.

00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:26.550
Then the sap nourishes all these things and comes back.

00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:30.709
It doesn't get attached to something:

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.537
'Oh, she's my wife so the first priority is my wife.'

00:15:34.738 --> 00:15:37.693
Because I've said, of course, family life has to be all right,

00:15:37.894 --> 00:15:40.175
you must look after your family life.

00:15:41.043 --> 00:15:44.225
But that doesn't mean that you make everything suffer,

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:47.285
that doesn't mean that your ascent should be finished.

00:15:47.496 --> 00:15:49.621
Cannot be that.

00:15:50.653 --> 00:15:53.311
You are not like ordinary people, you are saints

00:15:53.512 --> 00:15:56.855
and for the saints the main thing is their ascent,

00:15:57.066 --> 00:16:02.490
not their family life, not their material possessions, nothing.

00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:06.041
Nor their children, but their ascent, once they ascend

00:16:06.242 --> 00:16:10.355
everything will ascend with it.

00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:23.307
Now the understanding of chastity should be there.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:26.468
It can come to you very easily if you ascend,

00:16:26.669 --> 00:16:29.677
it's such a vicious circle.

00:16:29.878 --> 00:16:32.534
It is such a vicious circle.

00:16:32.735 --> 00:16:36.735
Now first of all you get your Realization, all right.

00:16:38.774 --> 00:16:44.980
Now you must know that Kundalini itself is the Mahakali shakti

00:16:45.481 --> 00:16:47.610
because she's the primordial.

00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:51.811
Mahakali shakti is the primordial shakti within us.

00:16:52.108 --> 00:16:55.108
And is the Kundalini is the Mahakali shakti.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.217
And she remains as a virgin within you.

00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:04.792
Means She's purity, She has a power to purify.

00:17:06.808 --> 00:17:14.288
All that happens when you get your Realization.

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:20.327
She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects on you.

00:17:22.938 --> 00:17:26.938
Now the one who's sitting there is Shri Ganesh.

00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:32.515
Now people don't understand what is innocence is.

00:17:34.224 --> 00:17:36.059
Shri Ganesha is sitting there

00:17:36.293 --> 00:17:45.351
and He is the one who resides on mooladhara,

00:17:45.552 --> 00:17:48.906
even over his Mother because He's like a guard,

00:17:49.107 --> 00:17:54.054
and He's the one who tells whether She can ascend or not.

00:17:54.255 --> 00:18:00.044
Unless and until He gives permission She cannot ascend.

00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:08.461
So Shri Ganesha gives the ascending sort of, er,

00:18:09.368 --> 00:18:15.221
OK, alright, you can rise.

00:18:15.422 --> 00:18:22.218
And he stops all his work.

00:18:22.418 --> 00:18:26.128
You have seen th... Me, sitting for hours together.

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:27.918
I don't have to go even to the bathroom

00:18:28.113 --> 00:18:31.646
or anywhere because Shri Ganesha stops all his work.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.414
He's only worried now about the ascent

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:41.721
and on every chakra he checks your purity,

00:18:42.823 --> 00:18:46.870
and then accordingly the Kundalini tries to purify.

00:18:49.206 --> 00:18:53.803
But when it reaches the mental level,

00:18:54.004 --> 00:18:56.967
mental level has all these funny ideas of romance,

00:18:57.168 --> 00:18:59.862
this nonsense, that nonsense.

00:19:00.063 --> 00:19:02.958
I was surprised the other day,

00:19:03.159 --> 00:19:06.425
there was a girl who was having a trouble with her husband

00:19:06.626 --> 00:19:09.807
of expressing her love to her husband after marriage;

00:19:10.008 --> 00:19:12.609
before marriage she was all right.

00:19:13.578 --> 00:19:17.378
So I told her: 'Read some book where they have described

00:19:17.673 --> 00:19:21.672
the romance between husband and wife'.

00:19:22.806 --> 00:19:24.823
So she said, 'There is no book I have known.'

00:19:25.024 --> 00:19:26.667
Then I asked one professor to find out,

00:19:26.868 --> 00:19:28.801
he said there's no such book.

00:19:32.686 --> 00:19:36.530
In Sahaja Yoga the romance starts after the marriage.

00:19:37.765 --> 00:19:42.203
But also with maryadas, not at the cost of Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:42.404 --> 00:19:45.265
not at the cost, cost of your ascent.

00:19:48.647 --> 00:19:50.989
So all these ideas people have in the West,

00:19:51.185 --> 00:19:53.403
I know you are so much conditioned about it.

00:19:53.576 --> 00:19:55.443
So, you say now let us see,

00:19:55.631 --> 00:19:57.187
this is some (? inaudible word) after all,

00:19:57.388 --> 00:20:00.365
we have to give all the benefit to them.

00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:05.499
Now we select people, we do everything.

00:20:07.187 --> 00:20:09.658
Is all the work of Mahakali

00:20:09.859 --> 00:20:12.541
because you have to work on the vibrations,

00:20:12.742 --> 00:20:14.861
it's all the work of Mahakali.

00:20:15.062 --> 00:20:18.938
And after marriages also some marriages do fail.

00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:20.972
The reason being they do not know

00:20:21.173 --> 00:20:23.993
what is the purpose of their marriages.

00:20:31.838 --> 00:20:34.611
So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali is that

00:20:34.752 --> 00:20:39.767
She is purity. Absolute purity.

00:20:40.752 --> 00:20:45.964
And that purity if we cannot imbibe within us,

00:20:46.165 --> 00:20:49.165
we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:50.047 --> 00:20:54.424
Now this mind is so much conditioned, I know.

00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:56.750
Our children will be much better off than ourselves.

00:20:57.591 --> 00:21:01.591
Then they won't have these conditionings as we have had.

00:21:03.185 --> 00:21:06.060
And so many problems can be just avoided

00:21:06.261 --> 00:21:08.773
if you really become pure people.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.648
I see in the other society in which I move,

00:21:12.849 --> 00:21:14.111
nobody seems to be safe,

00:21:14.312 --> 00:21:16.921
somebody's wife is running with somebody's husband,

00:21:17.117 --> 00:21:19.624
somebody's daughter is running with somebody's father,

00:21:19.812 --> 00:21:23.679
somebody's running, a boy running with somebody's mother.

00:21:24.338 --> 00:21:28.212
Next day you find somebody else standing there husband and wife.

00:21:28.424 --> 00:21:32.043
Or sometimes it's so biz...funny that you can't believe it,

00:21:32.246 --> 00:21:36.582
how can it be? And everybody's in danger.

00:21:37.832 --> 00:21:39.158
A man goes to the house,

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:43.135
he finds his wife run away with another man.

00:21:43.377 --> 00:21:47.938
Or a man goes for his work, he's run away with another woman.

00:21:48.139 --> 00:21:53.693
So the, She, She's the one, She gives you stithi, the state.

00:21:53.912 --> 00:21:57.302
Stithi means consolidation.

00:21:58.844 --> 00:22:04.836
Without your proper consolidation into your purity,

00:22:05.102 --> 00:22:10.681
not into your romantic life, you cannot rise.

00:22:13.455 --> 00:22:15.494
Like when we make the aeroplane,

00:22:15.697 --> 00:22:18.301
first we have to consolidate it.

00:22:18.502 --> 00:22:20.387
Fix it up properly, work it out,

00:22:20.588 --> 00:22:23.004
so that when it goes in the air

00:22:23.205 --> 00:22:27.986
all its parts do not fly away with the passengers.

00:22:29.932 --> 00:22:38.490
In the same way when we are ascending Shri Ganesha does that,

00:22:38.691 --> 00:22:43.502
he just stops the action of excretion completely

00:22:43.704 --> 00:22:47.827
and the ascent starts.

00:22:48.398 --> 00:22:50.429
They are doing their work all right,

00:22:50.629 --> 00:22:52.717
despite the fact they have been insulted,

00:22:52.918 --> 00:22:55.881
they have been neglected, we have misbehaved,

00:22:56.082 --> 00:22:58.131
whatever we might have done,

00:22:58.332 --> 00:23:00.519
they are doing their jobs alright.

00:23:00.738 --> 00:23:04.084
We can see it, so many people getting their Realization.

00:23:04.285 --> 00:23:06.874
But what are we doing about it?

00:23:08.851 --> 00:23:12.327
We cannot be even collective,

00:23:14.437 --> 00:23:17.905
we cannot attend collective things.

00:23:18.645 --> 00:23:20.757
And look at them how generous they are,

00:23:20.958 --> 00:23:25.306
they are extremely collective, they are extremely collective,

00:23:25.507 --> 00:23:32.147
to such an extent to somebody supposing worships Shri Krishna.

00:23:33.483 --> 00:23:35.686
His heart will catch.

00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:41.672
Why? Because you must also worship Shiva.

00:23:45.844 --> 00:23:49.444
They are so collective and so much connected with Me.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.441
So they are all collective, in the same way

00:23:53.642 --> 00:23:57.342
you are also devas, you also should be collective.

00:24:00.157 --> 00:24:01.676
As soon as you become collective

00:24:01.877 --> 00:24:04.877
all these nonsensical things will drop out.

00:24:05.667 --> 00:24:09.292
All these ideas will drop out. You do not become collective

00:24:09.493 --> 00:24:12.985
because you have not dropped out all these things,

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:16.963
or else you are afraid of dropping them out.

00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:20.661
So let us know what is our purpose (is?),

00:24:20.862 --> 00:24:23.510
our purpose is to ascend.

00:24:24.925 --> 00:24:28.125
And what is the Mahakali power is doing for us.

00:24:29.204 --> 00:24:33.094
She is giving you your ascent through Kundalini.

00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:40.914
She is purify; She's giving you all the powers.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:48.454
She is protecting you all the time, She is giving you joy.

00:24:49.879 --> 00:24:51.576
But what are we doing for Her?

00:24:51.777 --> 00:25:04.138
Her only, only desire is that my children should be saintly,

00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:07.939
that they should have beautiful qualities of a saint.

00:25:08.535 --> 00:25:12.268
That he doesn't fall at every woman, fall at every man.

00:25:12.637 --> 00:25:15.121
It's not so cheap, you see.

00:25:18.395 --> 00:25:20.355
And mentally specially,

00:25:22.387 --> 00:25:24.848
I mean if the Sahasrara is spoilt

00:25:25.049 --> 00:25:27.275
how can Sahaja Yoga work out?

00:25:28.916 --> 00:25:31.916
The whole play is of the Sahasrara.

00:25:34.853 --> 00:25:39.424
And that purity should manifest.

00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:43.492
Through you we are going to change the world.

00:25:44.086 --> 00:25:45.690
Through no-one else.

00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:49.291
The Sahaja Yogis who are going to change the world.

00:25:49.602 --> 00:25:53.402
Now look at the generosity, when my body is so generous.

00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:58.851
Yesterday one lady came, I think she,

00:25:59.052 --> 00:26:02.914
she had a very bad liver. She came downstairs and I,

00:26:03.115 --> 00:26:07.115
my liver started pumping vibrations, terrible.

00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:11.545
She had a very bad liver though; she had taken drugs,

00:26:11.746 --> 00:26:13.725
I mean she had taken drugs and all that suffering

00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:18.425
was done to me, by this liver of mine.

00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:23.712
It didn't think that 'Oh Mother, she's come all the way out suffering'

00:26:23.913 --> 00:26:28.790
so started just pumping for that woman.

00:26:30.517 --> 00:26:35.500
So generous it is. And they are so generous themselves

00:26:35.701 --> 00:26:37.831
the way they bestow blessings (all over?).

00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:41.947
How they are hard working, how they are running about.

00:26:43.033 --> 00:26:45.025
What are we giving them?

00:26:50.205 --> 00:26:52.900
They give us joy, they look after us,

00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:56.634
they look after our children, they look after everything,

00:26:56.835 --> 00:27:00.502
they manage everything. Now what are we doing for them?

00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:03.689
Also I've heard that people don't help

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:05.660
when they have to do postering, they have to do,

00:27:05.861 --> 00:27:09.720
very few people come up.

00:27:09.921 --> 00:27:15.735
This is being ungrateful,
very ungrateful to those.

00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:18.098
All the deities are present

00:27:18.298 --> 00:27:21.430
when you are having those collective programmes.

00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:25.901
And surprisingly the old Sahaja Yogis

00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:29.715
are more difficult than the new ones.

00:27:29.916 --> 00:27:32.303
I mean this I just, surprising.

00:27:32.504 --> 00:27:36.777
I mean are they becoming now out of date or something?

00:27:37.832 --> 00:27:40.928
Christ has said 'First will be the last'.

00:27:41.129 --> 00:27:44.349
I hope that's not going to happen.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.059
Sort of a confidence they develop,

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.888
'Oh, we are old Sahaja Yogis.'

00:27:48.089 --> 00:27:52.089
We have had a horrible results in London

00:27:52.777 --> 00:27:54.568
of this consciousness that 'We are old,

00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:56.318
we'll do whatever we like.

00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:00.581
We may attend the collective or not.' A kind of a ego.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.988
Please be careful.

00:28:06.189 --> 00:28:09.872
Christ has clearly said 'First will be the last.'

00:28:10.072 --> 00:28:14.278
And I've seen so many of them, just getting out like that,

00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:17.807
even I don't know how they get out.

00:28:21.034 --> 00:28:26.268
In such stupid ways that unimaginable for anyone.

00:28:26.469 --> 00:28:32.026
Like one gentleman in Italy was an old Sahaja Yogi

00:28:32.227 --> 00:28:36.372
just got up and said: 'I am Maha Mataji.'

00:28:37.271 --> 00:28:41.406
Everyone started looking at him. 'What do you mean?'

00:28:41.607 --> 00:28:48.075
'I am Maha Mataji and I'm going to do all this myself.'

00:28:49.545 --> 00:28:53.022
So they said, 'Alright, so we are going out of ashram.'

00:28:53.225 --> 00:28:56.664
'No, no, no, I can't manage the ashram, I'm getting out.'

00:28:56.865 --> 00:28:59.509
And he went and stayed with someone, that lady,

00:28:59.713 --> 00:29:05.447
who heard against me and got cancer and died.

00:29:12.312 --> 00:29:15.174
In the collectivity supposing you have one problem,

00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:20.171
another one has some problem. It just works out, balances.

00:29:23.406 --> 00:29:29.293
As one finger is cut out, it is useless

00:29:29.494 --> 00:29:36.025
or a nail which is taken out is useless. It dies.

00:29:36.892 --> 00:29:40.020
So that is how we are organizing

00:29:40.221 --> 00:29:43.916
our spiritual death and ultimately I don't know what else.

00:29:44.117 --> 00:29:45.622
And then they come back that

00:29:45.823 --> 00:29:48.010
'Mother I have got now these troubles so I have come back,

00:29:48.211 --> 00:29:51.750
I was out of Sahaja Yoga for three years.'

00:29:51.951 --> 00:29:53.531
I say: 'What do you mean, out of Sahaja Yoga?'

00:29:53.732 --> 00:29:57.115
'I didn't attend any collective programme.'

00:30:00.795 --> 00:30:04.075
I am thinking of the collectivity of the whole world,

00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:09.765
that's my vision, and if Sahaja Yogis cannot be collective

00:30:09.966 --> 00:30:13.710
who is going to be collective?

00:30:13.911 --> 00:30:17.317
Who is going to fulfill my vision?

00:30:22.272 --> 00:30:26.637
So all of you, those who call themselves Sahaja Yogis,

00:30:26.838 --> 00:30:29.494
must attend the programme.

00:30:31.158 --> 00:30:33.355
And the second thing is that

00:30:33.556 --> 00:30:41.556
there was a little problem of generosity of people.

00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:45.878
Of course that's also is a character of Mahalaxshmi,

00:30:46.098 --> 00:30:48.652
She's very generous.

00:30:48.989 --> 00:30:55.059
And when you are generous in giving vibrations

00:30:55.778 --> 00:31:00.209
and looking after people, this and that,

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.558
then Mahalaxshmi's principle works out.

00:31:03.759 --> 00:31:06.011
But Mahalaxshmi doesn't give money to people

00:31:06.212 --> 00:31:09.298
who are miserly, will never give.

00:31:10.486 --> 00:31:16.107
They may have money in the bank but they can never enjoy.

00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:24.211
So if there is need people have to give money to Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:24.412 --> 00:31:28.771
I have been supplying lot of money, as you know, from the very beginning.

00:31:29.076 --> 00:31:30.578
Those who are early Sahaja Yogis will know

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:32.979
how much I have been able to pay.

00:31:33.162 --> 00:31:36.542
But now we are growing and everybody should know

00:31:36.743 --> 00:31:43.133
that we have to pay. After all this is our responsibility.

00:31:43.337 --> 00:31:46.943
Where are we going to spend our money, in what?

00:31:47.144 --> 00:31:49.487
I mean my family feels that, that what,

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:53.167
whatever money I'm spending for Sahaja Yoga is the best.

00:31:53.363 --> 00:31:56.635
They get punyas, is the best for them.

00:31:56.836 --> 00:32:04.836
Only with punyas you get more wealth, health and prosperity.

00:32:05.117 --> 00:32:08.117
If you do not have punyas you cannot get it.

00:32:09.038 --> 00:32:13.295
It will come and go away.

00:32:13.496 --> 00:32:17.808
It will disappear, into thin air.

00:32:21.034 --> 00:32:24.971
So I was surprised that people are not generous.

00:32:28.424 --> 00:32:34.407
We have to know that we are so much better off people

00:32:34.608 --> 00:32:37.608
than many others.

00:32:38.678 --> 00:32:41.586
Like the Eastern Bloc people are not so good

00:32:41.787 --> 00:32:43.646
in money matters just now.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:48.157
I'm not saying that we have to help them but we have to think.

00:32:48.365 --> 00:32:50.786
Have we sent something for them as presents?

00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:53.389
Can we do something for them?

00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:58.584
The matter has the value which is again Mahakali's power.

00:32:58.785 --> 00:33:02.738
Is the power of Mahakali,

00:33:03.082 --> 00:33:09.194
that the matter carries the love.

00:33:09.395 --> 00:33:11.897
Expresses.

00:33:15.124 --> 00:33:19.867
So many times I have seen how, very sweetly,

00:33:20.068 --> 00:33:21.750
they gave me something.

00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:26.208
I really don't take anything and I don't need anything

00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:29.096
but certain things which show so such concern,

00:33:29.297 --> 00:33:34.485
such understanding, such love.

00:33:35.352 --> 00:33:38.047
How will you express your love?

00:33:39.399 --> 00:33:42.672
To those people who're so far away.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:53.096
You just try, try to give, try to give for Sahaja Yoga also

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:58.906
and you'll be amazed how it will work out.

00:33:59.953 --> 00:34:04.645
For collectivity we have to know that Shri Bhairavanath

00:34:04.846 --> 00:34:09.541
and Shri Hanumana and Shri Ganesha,

00:34:09.742 --> 00:34:14.587
these three principles that work within

00:34:14.788 --> 00:34:18.227
us, all of them have parallel work to do, parallel work,

00:34:18.428 --> 00:34:22.516
they do not interfere for each other. But if it comes to help

00:34:22.717 --> 00:34:28.879
they go all out, there's no quarrel.

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:31.785
No quarrel between the two, no.

00:34:32.043 --> 00:34:34.504
If Hanuman needs Bhairava, he is there,

00:34:34.715 --> 00:34:38.855
if Bhairava needs Hanumana he is there, all out.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:46.918
So this collectivity comes only by understanding one thing

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:49.861
what a great work we are doing today,

00:34:50.126 --> 00:34:54.477
people are not conscious of that, they take it just by the way.

00:34:54.915 --> 00:34:58.355
In the war you have seen how people fight,

00:34:58.556 --> 00:35:02.907
even if they have the fear of dying.

00:35:03.202 --> 00:35:06.702
Formerly nobody was paid also in the military.

00:35:08.366 --> 00:35:11.547
But they went and fought, maybe for their country,

00:35:11.748 --> 00:35:15.547
for anything. And they used to join together to fight,

00:35:15.748 --> 00:35:19.391
they allowed themselves to be killed, they helped each other,

00:35:19.592 --> 00:35:22.860
they did this, all these qualities are there

00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:26.040
when we want to hate someone.

00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:28.905
But when we want to love someone why shouldn't we help,

00:35:29.117 --> 00:35:32.170
those qualities emerging out of us.

00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:40.934
These are the qualities of Mahakali

00:35:41.135 --> 00:35:45.289
because She is the expert of war affairs.

00:35:46.555 --> 00:35:49.274
She's the One who makes people work

00:35:50.337 --> 00:35:55.630
and She's the One who makes them fight because is the desire.

00:35:55.831 --> 00:36:02.073
They have nothing there, just the desire to do something

00:36:02.274 --> 00:36:09.237
and then they join together and then the Mahasaraswati helps them to act

00:36:09.438 --> 00:36:13.745
but first the desire is so strong.

00:36:13.945 --> 00:36:16.562
Now the desire has to be very very strong within us

00:36:16.763 --> 00:36:20.434
that we have to be for the emancipation of the whole world,

00:36:20.638 --> 00:36:22.989
we are the people, we are the special people,

00:36:23.169 --> 00:36:24.122
we are in the (foundation?).

00:36:24.404 --> 00:36:31.548
Nothing else is more important than our own personality

00:36:31.749 --> 00:36:36.282
being completely dedicated for Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:37.951 --> 00:36:43.425
This desire has to be extremely strong and very pure.

00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:50.282
Those actually desire it, actually,

00:36:50.634 --> 00:36:52.790
they get their Realization like that,

00:36:52.993 --> 00:36:54.836
they reach their depth like that

00:36:55.037 --> 00:36:57.243
and they enjoy doing work of Sah...

00:36:57.444 --> 00:37:01.178
they all the time they enjoy it, for them nothing is more important.

00:37:06.655 --> 00:37:08.634
As we say in, there's a saying that

00:37:08.835 --> 00:37:12.413
when you get the re...water of Ganges to drink,

00:37:12.614 --> 00:37:17.903
why should you take water from dirty, er, rivers?

00:37:20.316 --> 00:37:22.970
So the whole attention is that side,

00:37:23.447 --> 00:37:27.183
the all the joy you get out of this romance and this love,

00:37:27.358 --> 00:37:32.584
and this and that, becomes zero before it because it's Nirananda.

00:37:32.844 --> 00:37:35.687
Only joy.

00:37:35.888 --> 00:37:39.005
In the marriage you see wife says like this, says that,

00:37:39.206 --> 00:37:45.789
er, all this is so conditioning. Any, any joy.

00:37:46.665 --> 00:37:49.214
You have different joys on different centers,

00:37:49.415 --> 00:37:51.542
they are all given by Mahakali,

00:37:51.743 --> 00:37:54.985
but the greatest of all you have got after Realization

00:37:55.274 --> 00:38:00.633
is the Nirananda, that state you must reach, to Nirananda state.

00:38:02.525 --> 00:38:05.337
If you are in that state of Nirananda,

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:10.863
You are absolutely purified.

00:38:11.242 --> 00:38:15.341
But how to bring the purity.

00:38:16.137 --> 00:38:19.433
Just by developing thoughtless awareness

00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:23.962
and looking at things without thinking.

00:38:27.195 --> 00:38:31.673
For that you have to be collective. If you are collective,

00:38:31.874 --> 00:38:34.163
I am there, wherever you are collective,

00:38:34.452 --> 00:38:38.431
wherever you gather, I am there

00:38:38.632 --> 00:38:40.778
and nothing gives me greater pleasure

00:38:41.011 --> 00:38:45.230
to hear that all of you are attending this programme.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.150
You'll be amazed that in Australia we have so many

00:38:49.351 --> 00:38:59.460
centers in every, every city but they all attend

00:38:59.661 --> 00:39:05.207
the programmes of collectivity

00:39:05.408 --> 00:39:12.824
because they know collectivity is the ocean of nourishment.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:20.893
This is the simplest thing we have to do,

00:39:21.094 --> 00:39:25.098
but the bhoots are much more collective.

00:39:25.299 --> 00:39:30.650
Much more collective. Bhoots can go

00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:35.037
to such a length of fraternity

00:39:35.238 --> 00:39:39.144
that you'll be amazed.

00:39:43.015 --> 00:39:45.837
There was a lady in France only.

00:39:46.038 --> 00:39:50.174
She was an old lady and her daughter was in Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:50.374 --> 00:39:54.165
She had become absolutely mad so she put her in the,

00:39:54.366 --> 00:39:55.620
I mean absolutely bhootish,

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.806
and so she put her in a elderly home.

00:39:59.007 --> 00:40:03.626
And in the elderly home she only knew how to go to church on Sundays,

00:40:03.827 --> 00:40:05.531
she would dress up and go to church,

00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:08.653
that's only sensible thing she used to do.

00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:15.670
So she put her in the thing and there was a church,

00:40:15.879 --> 00:40:20.045
and she told me this, her daughter told me that it is very amazing

00:40:20.246 --> 00:40:23.192
that all of them get up in the morning,

00:40:23.392 --> 00:40:25.995
dress up well and go to church

00:40:26.196 --> 00:40:29.318
and in the, inside the church there are graves of people

00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:33.998
who have died, out of those, I mean,

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:38.497
half-mad or full-mad elderly people.

00:40:38.698 --> 00:40:42.032
Otherwise they did not know even how to wear their dresses,

00:40:42.233 --> 00:40:46.025
they didn't know how to eat their food, they didn't know anything

00:40:46.226 --> 00:40:48.541
but when it came to going

00:40:48.742 --> 00:40:52.130
to church to that bhootish place where all the bhoots were there,

00:40:52.373 --> 00:40:55.560
they all would get up in the morning, dress up properly

00:40:55.755 --> 00:40:59.836
and go to the church, sit down, sing hymns and come back.

00:41:00.037 --> 00:41:03.131
As if like possessions.

00:41:03.332 --> 00:41:06.453
Such a fraternity of bhoots there is.

00:41:06.654 --> 00:41:08.710
As soon as one bhoot comes in,

00:41:08.911 --> 00:41:11.919
one bhoot came now recently from Australia.

00:41:12.137 --> 00:41:14.906
Now he is gathering all the bhoots round here.

00:41:15.107 --> 00:41:20.377
Even to Pune there he gathered, all the bhoots, immediately.

00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:24.411
Then he came here, now he's gathering those bhoots.

00:41:24.612 --> 00:41:26.263
People are getting friendly with him.

00:41:26.464 --> 00:41:29.573
Exactly who are bhoots you can make it out

00:41:29.774 --> 00:41:31.292
by just seeing a bhoot sitting there

00:41:31.493 --> 00:41:34.109
and who is sitting next to that person.

00:41:34.305 --> 00:41:37.471
They are so attracted like a magnet,

00:41:37.672 --> 00:41:40.945
well the magnet is the quality of Mahakali.

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:50.072
Bhoots know me better than anybody else can know

00:41:50.273 --> 00:41:54.202
because they know my past, they are in the past.

00:41:54.468 --> 00:41:57.666
And they know who has got bhoots

00:41:57.867 --> 00:41:59.976
and how they attract each other,

00:42:00.281 --> 00:42:04.272
and how they act on a bhootish person.

00:42:08.484 --> 00:42:12.383
That is why the positive collectivity has to be there.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:18.149
But when it comes to positivity they do not get collective.

00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:21.798
All those who do not get collective will gradually

00:42:21.999 --> 00:42:27.071
go into the fraternity of bhoots

00:42:27.272 --> 00:42:30.272
because today we are dealing about Mahakali.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.913
She is the One who knows everything about these bhootish things,

00:42:34.114 --> 00:42:36.700
she's in charge, I mean.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.276
She's the Lord of all these bhoots and She knows

00:42:40.477 --> 00:42:43.676
and She looks after then and She manages them.

00:42:43.958 --> 00:42:47.512
But where's, (inaudible word?) want to go into that realm,

00:42:47.778 --> 00:42:51.832
what has She to do?

00:42:52.033 --> 00:42:54.633
She has locked them up on one side

00:42:54.834 --> 00:42:56.958
but Sahaja Yogis want to go there,

00:42:57.162 --> 00:43:00.857
just enter through back doors into that area,

00:43:01.058 --> 00:43:04.597
what can you do?

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.363
Of course She protects, She doesn't want anyone to go there,

00:43:09.564 --> 00:43:12.201
She's just kept them out and told the bhoots

00:43:12.402 --> 00:43:17.396
not to come this side, but Sahaja Yogis only go there.

00:43:17.597 --> 00:43:21.090
That's been reported.

00:43:23.965 --> 00:43:29.318
Under these circumstances, Sahaja Yoga has gone very far,

00:43:29.519 --> 00:43:32.662
very much in so many other countries.

00:43:32.863 --> 00:43:35.175
In France you have seen yesterday

00:43:35.376 --> 00:43:41.506
how this ananda shakti of the Mother acted on people. '

00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:45.277
It was wonderful to see that, everybody came to me

00:43:45.478 --> 00:43:48.363
and they were full of smiles, I have never seen

00:43:48.564 --> 00:43:52.160
any French woman of that age smiling, never, no question,

00:43:52.361 --> 00:43:55.321
even if you tickled them, even if you certify that

00:43:55.533 --> 00:43:59.261
this is a joke they'll not smile like that.

00:43:59.462 --> 00:44:01.470
I've never seen their teeth.

00:44:01.837 --> 00:44:05.898
Yesterday the whole face was lit up, so many of them,

00:44:06.099 --> 00:44:08.798
something so miraculous it was.

00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:16.368
This anandini shakti of Mahakali was acting so beautifully yesterday

00:44:16.569 --> 00:44:19.642
and you are the people who will now

00:44:19.842 --> 00:44:21.779
guide or misguide them.

00:44:22.859 --> 00:44:26.303
If you become, all of you become,

00:44:26.504 --> 00:44:28.563
higher personalities,

00:44:28.764 --> 00:44:31.372
if you become collective all of you,

00:44:31.572 --> 00:44:33.706
and if you become generous,

00:44:33.914 --> 00:44:37.786
and if you become absolutely pure, they will say

00:44:37.987 --> 00:44:42.364
'Now look at these people, how beautiful they look.'

00:44:42.575 --> 00:44:45.679
You already look very beautiful, your faces shine,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.880
but it will all disappear.

00:44:52.017 --> 00:45:00.830
And the effects of disappearance are not very simple.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:05.828
So be careful, I of course bless you,

00:45:06.029 --> 00:45:14.029
with all the qualities of Bhairava,

00:45:14.623 --> 00:45:18.887
as He is the greatest disciple of Mahakali

00:45:19.088 --> 00:45:21.293
and He is the One who is running up and down,

00:45:21.494 --> 00:45:24.025
morning till evening every time, specially in the night

00:45:24.291 --> 00:45:27.949
He is working so very hard killing these horrible rakshasas,

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.978
this, that,

00:45:34.308 --> 00:45:39.120
and achieving such results.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:44.644
We have to join Him, all of us, and work it out.

00:45:44.895 --> 00:45:49.068
May God Bless You.
