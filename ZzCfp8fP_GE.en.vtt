00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:15.542
We must understand that Sahaja Yoga 
is not done through brain activities.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.667
Like many people think that
 if you just tell yourself

00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:27.500
“You have to be like this”, 
it will work out.

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:29.959
If you have to all the time inform yourself that,

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:34.375
“Oh, you must get rid of a particular 
problem”, you’ll be all right.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:38.667
Or some people think that if 
they tell somebody,

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:43.459
that “This is wrong with you and you 
should get well”, it will be all right.

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:45.834
It is not so.

00:00:45.918 --> 00:00:49.959
Because Sahaja Yoga does not work on mental level.

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:55.417
It works on spiritual level which is a 
much higher level than the mental level.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:01:01.876
So what you have to do is to understand 
how to correct your chakras.

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:07.709
And you must understand how 
to work out your machines.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:11.292
Perhaps people still live on mental level

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:15.042
and try to solve problems on mental level.

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:18.918
And that’s why all the problems start coming out.

00:01:18.918 --> 00:01:23.584
Now, if you have a problem with any 
chakras or there is anything catching

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:26.918
or you find that there’s something wrong with you,

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:32.667
no use working it out on any 
other level but spiritual level....

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:41.167
Some people believe that if they 
have dressed up like something

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:47.292
or if they outwardly behave like 
something, they become that.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.250
That is not true. Like we have hippies in the West

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.459
and they think that they have become primitive.

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.334
You do not become primitive by believing it.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:03.500
Because you are so overdeveloped, 
that you cannot become primitive.

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:11.042
So by just doing something 
mentally we do not become.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:18.626
Now, this mental level can go even 
further in a subtler way into people.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:25.876
Some of you might feel that by 
knowing some of the aartis

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:31.542
and things by heart you will achieve 
great depth, it is not true, also.

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:33.999
Because that is also just words.

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:39.584
But, if that is an awakened thing 
within you, then they become a mantra.

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:42.167
And then you can work it out.

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:47.334
But first of all you must achieve 
a certain standard

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:52.042
to have that power to create the mantras.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.459
Also, when you say some aarti, 
it’s not necessarily possible

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.083
that it will work out.

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:06.083
Let us face the things as they are and 
not to be conditioned by anything else.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:12.667
You have to achieve a certain 
depth within yourself

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:18.167
to even enlighten the mantras.

00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:24.500
First of all you should have clear-cut 
vibrations, minimum of minimum.

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:27.167
If you have certain chakras catching,

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:33.375
then try to improve your chakras 
with the photograph.

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.209
With all due respect to the photograph.

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.500
It’s only the photograph which 
is going to work it out.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.083
Nothing else. Or if I am there.

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:47.083
But once you have achieved a 
certain state of enlightenment,

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:54.209
then you can use mantras otherwise 
also, it will help you.

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:57.667
But first of all your heart must be clear.
