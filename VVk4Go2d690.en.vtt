WEBVTT

03:40.479 --> 03:43.178
First, I’ll speak in English language,

03:43.379 --> 03:48.966
because we have so many people from foreign countries,

03:49.300 --> 03:51.498
and especially from Madras (Chennai)

03:51.681 --> 03:56.794
and also from Kerala,

03:56.995 --> 04:00.683
Hyderabad and Bangalore.

04:01.564 --> 04:04.434
All these people have come here,

04:04.635 --> 04:07.479
and I don’t know what other people are here,

04:07.844 --> 04:13.340
who have come from South

04:13.541 --> 04:20.681
and who do not yet understand Hindi language.

04:30.662 --> 04:35.287
This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think,

04:35.843 --> 04:39.388
because

04:42.694 --> 04:49.875
there is so much –

04:50.076 --> 04:55.289
if you read any newspaper in the morning,

04:55.490 --> 05:01.756
such horrible news is there

05:02.018 --> 05:07.602
about the people who are trying to create

05:07.967 --> 05:15.398
all kinds of violence, corruption

05:15.599 --> 05:20.242
and immoral behaviour.

05:20.443 --> 05:28.321
You are surprised how, these
days, it is so full of

05:28.884 --> 05:33.883
all these criminalities going round us.

05:35.161 --> 05:41.954
This is the time, as if come, for

05:41.979 --> 05:47.453
the “Taandav nrutya” (cosmic dance) of Shri Shiva.

05:48.589 --> 05:53.716
Otherwise, one feels things cannot improve.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.655
It is His anger, if it starts,

05:59.481 --> 06:04.713
throwing wrath on people of this character and this type.

06:05.999 --> 06:12.849
I don’t know how anyone can save from His wrath.

06:13.672 --> 06:17.573
He’s a God who is full of love,

06:18.700 --> 06:22.932
full of tremendous compassion,

06:24.242 --> 06:36.485
but also the- another extreme of very destroying character.

06:37.657 --> 06:39.659
He can destroy the whole world.

06:41.382 --> 06:48.177
He can finish all the creatures that have been created

06:49.725 --> 06:53.053
if He gets into a temper.

06:58.944 --> 07:01.128
You all must be knowing the story,

07:01.691 --> 07:06.521
how He went into ecstasy.

07:08.499 --> 07:14.439
There was a devil who had taken a form of a child.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.607
And a mother cannot kill the child,

07:19.170 --> 07:22.039
she cannot. And She thought

07:22.496 --> 07:30.332
She won’t be able to save the world from the wrath

07:31.900 --> 07:35.157
or anger of Shiva

07:36.078 --> 07:40.683
if He sees the whole world destroyed by this devil.

07:47.345 --> 07:52.646
So She withdrew from Her act

07:53.781 --> 07:59.965
of sacrificing the child or killing the child

08:01.387 --> 08:04.864
and it was Shiva who took over.

08:06.349 --> 08:12.502
And He just stood on the back of the child and killed him.

08:13.168 --> 08:14.867
That child was a devil.

08:16.170 --> 08:19.877
And so, He saved the world

08:21.061 --> 08:24.750
from the destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

08:26.194 --> 08:28.998
And then He danced with joy.

08:30.053 --> 08:34.896
That’s what they call as a cosmic, cosmic joy.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.864
Many people don’t understand why

08:39.285 --> 08:41.556
He’s standing on top of a little child,

08:42.556 --> 08:44.136
but the reason was this.

08:44.985 --> 08:49.011
So, even people may camouflage today

08:49.884 --> 08:55.169
as small children, as very innocent people,

08:55.741 --> 09:03.465
as very holy gurus,

09:05.158 --> 09:07.523
Shiva can destroy all of them.

09:09.619 --> 09:12.328
This destruction has already started

09:13.709 --> 09:17.209
and is going with a full speed, I think, all over,

09:18.712 --> 09:21.124
through so many things that are happening:

09:21.973 --> 09:27.197
we have got hurricanes,

09:29.356 --> 09:32.626
storms, earthquakes,

09:34.193 --> 09:35.652
many accidents,

09:36.819 --> 09:40.398
and so many destructive things are working out

09:41.096 --> 09:45.194
which are the outcome of Kalaki [Kalki] incarnation.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.265
But, at the same time,

09:49.234 --> 09:53.434
there is another work going on, of the same incarnation:

09:54.434 --> 09:57.347
is the resurrection of the people.

09:58.395 --> 10:01.095
Such people can never be hurt,

10:02.008 --> 10:04.484
nothing can happen to them.

10:05.349 --> 10:07.103
They’ll be always saved.

10:07.905 --> 10:10.058
Everything will be saved for them

10:10.669 --> 10:16.029
because they are under the protection of their Mother.

10:18.857 --> 10:22.711
Now the problem is

10:23.187 --> 10:29.243
how can we the Sahaja Yogis deal with such people

10:29.444 --> 10:35.259
and to see that they go out of the circulation of evolution?

10:38.140 --> 10:41.349
Only solution is raising the Kundalini.

10:43.189 --> 10:46.448
If you raise the Kundalini of human beings,

10:48.003 --> 10:52.019
who are even very bad and gone cases,

10:52.615 --> 10:58.152
either they will be destroyed or they will be saved

10:58.422 --> 11:00.765
and they’ll become good people.

11:02.098 --> 11:04.934
They will stop all this

11:07.633 --> 11:12.129
horrible things they are thinking and planning in their heads

11:13.033 --> 11:17.581
and they’ll become really very, very good people.

11:18.619 --> 11:21.637
It may fail in some cases – I wouldn’t say

11:21.838 --> 11:25.734
that Sahaja Yoga would be successful in every case.

11:26.670 --> 11:29.213
But if Sahaja Yogis meditate

11:29.792 --> 11:33.832
and keep themselves in complete peace

11:34.586 --> 11:39.580
and also completely surrendered,

11:40.548 --> 11:42.596
nothing can happen to them.

11:44.400 --> 11:48.177
They are always protected and you all have an experience

11:48.525 --> 11:49.598
of that protection.

11:50.971 --> 11:54.386
But first you should have faith in yourself

11:55.180 --> 11:58.576
and complete surrendering to Sahaja Yoga.

12:00.021 --> 12:02.880
We are so many Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

12:04.198 --> 12:08.253
mostly from North, South, East and West of India,

12:08.698 --> 12:10.898
and also from other foreign countries.

12:12.216 --> 12:16.744
Every country is, today, under the,

12:18.450 --> 12:21.720
we should say, under the control of these negative forces.

12:22.831 --> 12:27.615
What we have to do is to make people positive

12:28.298 --> 12:30.076
through Kundalini awakening.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.298
This you all can do.

12:33.049 --> 12:34.292
This you can achieve.

12:34.990 --> 12:39.348
For this, you don’t have to do something special.

12:40.094 --> 12:45.040
In day-to-day life, you can achieve it and you should do it.

12:45.405 --> 12:49.589
This is the only thing that is needed today,

12:49.701 --> 12:53.413
is to transform people and you all can do it,

12:54.024 --> 13:00.812
all of you can do it in a very sincere and a good manner.

13:01.876 --> 13:06.828
You don’t have to get to temper, jump at people,

13:07.495 --> 13:09.505
get angry with rude people,

13:09.878 --> 13:13.632
but with peaceful attitude, you should achieve it;

13:14.583 --> 13:21.919
so that this wrathful temperament of Shiva,

13:22.094 --> 13:25.303
as they say, the third eye of Shiva won’t open.

13:26.292 --> 13:28.414
That’s something horrible.

13:29.406 --> 13:32.307
We all can do it in a very constructive manner,

13:32.949 --> 13:35.299
extremely in a constructive manner.

13:36.124 --> 13:39.545
So what we should do is to, first of all,

13:39.894 --> 13:46.276
establish our own Shiva principle, is the principle of joy,

13:49.800 --> 13:51.546
principle of love

13:53.197 --> 13:56.021
and principle of Truth, I should say.

13:58.029 --> 14:00.870
There are big problems, also,

14:01.679 --> 14:04.674
because people have no idea

14:05.531 --> 14:13.128
as to Shiva’s global temperament.

14:16.525 --> 14:21.075
For example, I have heard people
quarrelling and fighting over

14:21.480 --> 14:24.853
Shiva principle and Vishnu principle.

14:27.037 --> 14:29.847
Now, Vishnu is there, His power is there

14:30.959 --> 14:34.422
for you to rise up to this Shiva principle.

14:36.906 --> 14:41.750
Both are not different, one is supplementary for another.

14:42.877 --> 14:45.417
But if you go on fighting even on that point,

14:45.909 --> 14:47.235
I can’t understand.

14:48.623 --> 14:51.674
You cannot please Shiva without Vishnu.

14:53.364 --> 14:59.223
And if you cannot stick to Shiva’s principle,

14:59.620 --> 15:02.684
if you have not understood the Vishnu principle –

15:05.210 --> 15:09.805
Kundalini itself rises through the Sushumna Nadi.

15:11.093 --> 15:15.910
She is the principle, She is the “tattwa” of Shiva.

15:17.335 --> 15:21.410
And She rises through the channel

15:21.720 --> 15:26.564
that is made by Vishnu out of evolutionary process.

15:27.976 --> 15:32.828
So how can you do away with one of Them?

15:33.764 --> 15:36.820
One is the road, another is the destination.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.838
So I hope you understand how important it is

15:42.489 --> 15:45.457
that your centers should be corrected,

15:46.021 --> 15:48.626
your road should be alright,

15:49.420 --> 15:52.221
that your Sushumna should be cleared,

15:52.570 --> 15:55.446
because we are “madhyamargis”:

15:56.208 --> 15:58.303
we have to go by the centre,

15:59.366 --> 16:03.407
by the central path and we have to have the balance,

16:04.034 --> 16:07.192
not to go to the left and not to go to the right.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.971
This balance we must keep

16:11.172 --> 16:13.278
and go on moving until you reach

16:13.778 --> 16:17.826
your “talu bhaag” (Brahmarandhra) where sits Sadashiva.

16:19.594 --> 16:23.471
You can experience it, you can see for yourself.

16:24.296 --> 16:27.738
Whatever I am saying, you know it very well.

16:28.199 --> 16:32.532
Only thing is when I am telling you, you can verify.

16:34.072 --> 16:37.352
Sahaja Yoga can be verified very easily,

16:38.150 --> 16:43.941
and you know that, that you now know the only truth.

16:45.711 --> 16:49.473
The truth which is absolute.

16:50.505 --> 16:55.816
This is also the principle which starts showing results

16:56.197 --> 16:59.966
when these two powers meet.

17:02.093 --> 17:06.421
It is very surprising that, when these two powers meet,

17:07.286 --> 17:12.445
or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle,

17:12.984 --> 17:14.614
then you realize

17:17.122 --> 17:22.865
that these two powers are so complimentary

17:23.809 --> 17:30.748
and so much related to each other.

17:31.883 --> 17:35.224
There’s no difference, in a way,

17:36.296 --> 17:38.020
between these two powers.

17:38.592 --> 17:44.774
And, so, keep your road “madhyamarga” [central channel] clean

17:45.243 --> 17:47.983
and let the Kundalini pass through it.

17:49.382 --> 17:52.007
When the Kundalini will pass through it,

17:52.792 --> 17:59.509
you’ll be amazed that the same Kundalini

17:59.710 --> 18:02.017
is going through the Vishnu path

18:02.218 --> 18:07.374
and reaching at the lotus feet of Shiva.

18:12.345 --> 18:19.138
All of you recognise Shivji, and He is worshiped.

18:20.558 --> 18:24.566
But, you do not know the different aspects of His qualities.

18:25.184 --> 18:28.575
That is why, many times you make mistakes.

18:30.611 --> 18:34.856
The most important form of  Shivji is bliss and joy.

18:35.990 --> 18:41.847
And this joy is spread everywhere in subtle and subtlest forms.

18:42.165 --> 18:48.101
But, until you become spiritually subtle to absorb this,

18:48.388 --> 18:52.562
you will neither be able to see this nor understand this.

18:53.086 --> 18:55.282
He resides in everything,

18:55.483 --> 19:00.754
He resides in everything

19:05.082 --> 19:10.297
and in a way we can say He creates a joyful realm.

19:10.498 --> 19:15.625
And when you look around in that realm, you find

19:15.826 --> 19:18.850
that you have been transformed into something else.

19:19.097 --> 19:23.215
Other people find happiness in different things.

19:24.533 --> 19:30.191
Many people find happiness in destroying themselves.

19:31.361 --> 19:35.329
By taking to different wrong paths,

19:35.984 --> 19:41.856
people think that if we go against the Spirit, we can find happiness.

19:43.081 --> 19:48.994
But, the Atma [Spirit], Which is verily Shivji,

19:51.385 --> 19:54.409
finds joy in a different way.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.616
And only that can touch our heart.

20:00.403 --> 20:06.855
Like, there are a lot of people who are immersed in material things.

20:07.580 --> 20:12.214
Some take to alchohol,  some indulge into sinful activities,

20:12.485 --> 20:14.724
they keep doing all wrong things

20:15.065 --> 20:18.350
and they think that there is a lot of happiness in that.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.079
But it is not so.

20:20.611 --> 20:25.031
gradually they get destroyed and slowly, they are finished.

20:26.601 --> 20:31.383
But, Shivji is the one who comforts us,

20:31.780 --> 20:35.955
He gives us peace and He gives us joy.

20:37.600 --> 20:44.616
And when the Power of Shiva and the Power of Vishnu,

20:45.105 --> 20:48.879
– like Kundalini and Sushumna Nadi;

20:49.689 --> 20:55.776
when unite with each other, you get the absolute Truth.

20:56.592 --> 20:58.982
absolute Truth.

20:59.183 --> 21:05.339
Such that you cannot, in any way,

21:05.540 --> 21:07.705
refuse to accept this Truth.

21:07.906 --> 21:10.161
Because it is the absolute Truth.

21:10.831 --> 21:14.402
Which you can feel on your fingertips, on your hands.

21:16.181 --> 21:18.823
You will have many types of experiences,

21:19.257 --> 21:24.185
by which you will understand that in the absolute Truth

21:25.688 --> 21:29.010
there is not even an iota of untruth.

21:29.211 --> 21:36.970
That is known within you; you can know it, understand it.

21:37.614 --> 21:40.955
This is the gift given by the Kundalini.

21:42.078 --> 21:45.831
This means that the Kundalini, which is the Shakti [Power] of Shiva,

21:46.051 --> 21:51.145
when She rises through the central channel,

21:51.774 --> 21:56.587
She awakens all the chakras, aligns them in its entirety,

21:56.788 --> 21:58.988
and integrates them

21:59.189 --> 22:03.547
Who looks after that Shakti [Power]?

22:04.381 --> 22:07.230
We can say that Shri Vishnu looks after Her,

22:07.962 --> 22:10.833
because She moves in the central path of Vishnu.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.726
And then She reaches the Brahmarandhra,

22:15.599 --> 22:17.345
and appears there.

22:18.343 --> 22:21.660
And on reaching there we can understand that

22:22.193 --> 22:26.141
Her journey is now complete.

22:26.998 --> 22:31.139
So we can see so much cooperation and understanding among them.

22:32.556 --> 22:34.169
But, we people are there,

22:35.456 --> 22:39.861
now a type of disease has come that everyone is running after money.

22:40.571 --> 22:44.126
Running after money has become a very peculier disease.

22:44.567 --> 22:47.209
And for that we are willing to do anything,

22:47.559 --> 22:49.455
We take support from anything,

22:49.662 --> 22:51.862
Even in Sahaja Yoga people do that.

22:52.164 --> 22:56.647
The reason for this is that some sort of defect has crept into us.

22:58.134 --> 23:01.491
A lot of negativities have accumulated in us.

23:02.376 --> 23:06.742
And these negativities can be cleansed only by Kundalini.

23:07.549 --> 23:15.605
But, until you do not become one with the Kundalini,

23:15.806 --> 23:19.594
and through meditation if you do not develop It,

23:20.888 --> 23:24.507
then you cannot reach that state where,

23:25.381 --> 23:28.840
the Power is manifested in you,

23:29.318 --> 23:34.404
the Power which is the truth, it is joy giving, peace giving -

23:35.603 --> 23:37.523
– a weakness remains in it.

23:38.143 --> 23:41.471
When the Kundalini rises, She cleanses everything.

23:42.788 --> 23:45.859
With the Power of Shivji, everything gets cleansed.

23:46.371 --> 23:50.158
But, still some people because of their old habits

23:50.492 --> 23:53.359
or because of wrong ideals, suffer a lot.

23:56.603 --> 24:00.311
And those people – with whatever that is wrong,

24:01.381 --> 24:04.579
whatever bad habits of theirs,

24:05.996 --> 24:11.265
even with the slightest temptation they fall from their ascent.

24:13.004 --> 24:17.526
Even if an atom of negativity is left within us,

24:17.899 --> 24:20.740
remaining within,

24:20.923 --> 24:25.421
We can fall due to that, and get completely destroyed

24:26.506 --> 24:30.848
Those who come to the Pujas and meditate,

24:31.152 --> 24:33.967
those people always make progress.

24:35.059 --> 24:42.352
If there is no peace, even a tree cannot survive, it cannot grow.

24:42.553 --> 24:45.313
Even germination cannot take place.

24:45.514 --> 24:49.187
That is why, within you,

24:49.388 --> 24:54.063
if you don't have this meditative quality, don't have these ideals,

24:54.264 --> 24:56.896
that we will never go towards downfall,

24:57.097 --> 25:00.579
we will not succumb to any bad habits,

25:00.780 --> 25:05.705
then you should attend all the pujas – as many as possible

25:05.906 --> 25:08.629
and you should be in meditation.

25:08.830 --> 25:12.086
Because now you have the right to do puja.

25:12.287 --> 25:14.239
Everyone doesn’t have the right to do Pujas.

25:14.367 --> 25:16.236
Anyone and everyone goes to do puja.

25:16.459 --> 25:19.077
But when there is no connection,

25:19.292 --> 25:22.192
then how can you be authorised to do a puja?

25:22.786 --> 25:24.611
But many people think-

25:24.779 --> 25:28.509
go to this temple or that temple; go to this guru or that guru.

25:28.699 --> 25:29.835
Nothing comes out of that.

25:30.011 --> 25:31.741
You are your own guru,

25:31.932 --> 25:35.701
and only you can introspect and think, ’what is the problem in me’?

25:36.029 --> 25:42.481
’In our heart are we completely accepting Sahaja Yoga or not'?

25:43.460 --> 25:46.292
I have seen a lot of people come into Sahaja Yoga

25:46.449 --> 25:50.996
and after reaching a certain height, they fall.

25:51.595 --> 25:54.658
The higher they rise, the lower they fall.

25:55.324 --> 25:59.459
The reason is that the hidden tendencies in you,

25:59.808 --> 26:04.570
have somehow become active, without you being aware of it.

26:06.139 --> 26:08.376
That is why you must pay attention

26:08.686 --> 26:12.623
– ’hope I am not falling into wrong things’,

26:13.397 --> 26:19.969
or ’hope, I am not doing anything wrong which is against Sahaja?

26:20.766 --> 26:26.324
or ’have some bad motives arisen in me that

26:26.681 --> 26:30.679
I have come to Sahaja with the idea of making money?’

26:30.880 --> 26:34.221
Or ,’I have come into Sahaja Yoga to do something bad?’

26:34.620 --> 26:37.745
Our attention should be towards these things.

26:37.946 --> 26:41.422
The best thing is that, whatever activities of Sahaja are there –

26:41.589 --> 26:46.510
or however it is possible in Sahaja, like meditation, worship, etc.

26:46.711 --> 26:50.879
you should do all that and establish individually

26:51.080 --> 26:55.593
within you, a special type of state

26:57.987 --> 27:01.717
which we call as

27:02.352 --> 27:05.299
individuality or as totality.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.857
Once you are established individually,

27:07.058 --> 27:09.582
then you can become a collective person.

27:09.783 --> 27:11.394
Those who do not attend collectivity,

27:11.782 --> 27:15.402
they cannot also grow individually.

27:15.809 --> 27:17.235
This I have seen.

27:17.489 --> 27:21.505
Only those who attend the collectivity, raise higher.

27:22.280 --> 27:26.009
For some time maybe you’ll get some benefits,

27:26.161 --> 27:29.169
like you get some money, or fame or something.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.520
Especially in Sahja Yoga some people have this ambitions –‚

27:33.680 --> 27:36.425
that ’how many people can I control’.

27:37.098 --> 27:41.423
Even that also happens, but your personality does not improve.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.046
There is no depth in you and

27:44.610 --> 27:49.030
you are not a Sahaja Yogi of high caliber.

27:49.509 --> 27:54.656
Until you are not of high caliber, all your talks are of no use.

27:55.090 --> 27:58.045
Because, who knows when you will fall from the brink

27:58.141 --> 28:01.309
and who knows when you will be destroyed completely?

28:01.632 --> 28:03.635
That is why we should be cautious

28:03.873 --> 28:08.309
and try to achieve high spiritual personality.

28:09.733 --> 28:12.333
There is one more thing you should do.

28:12.678 --> 28:15.336
If you have got your Realization today,

28:15.606 --> 28:17.292
then ’tomorrow’ you give Realization to thousands of people.

28:17.803 --> 28:19.712
Then your Powers will increase.

28:19.930 --> 28:24.119
If not, whatever little you have achieved, will also be finished.

28:25.322 --> 28:29.322
This is a very peculier rule.

28:30.084 --> 28:33.639
It cannot be compared with anything else.

28:33.911 --> 28:38.248
Like, if one lam enlightened and from that another is enlightened;

28:38.633 --> 28:41.491
even then you cannot say that the

28:42.586 --> 28:45.268
light of the first lamp increases –can not say.

28:45.560 --> 28:50.267
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, that if anyone opens his heart

28:50.588 --> 28:54.921
and sincerely does Sahaja Yoga

28:54.993 --> 28:58.296
and not only that but gives Realization to others, he shines.

28:58.892 --> 29:02.058
Because you have been made a Sahaja Yogi

29:02.289 --> 29:05.336
so that you tranform the entire world.

29:06.117 --> 29:11.688
That you create a great wave of transformation in the world

29:12.267 --> 29:16.473
and make it a beautiful place.

29:17.018 --> 29:22.509
The world should become a new and special world

29:23.311 --> 29:27.239
this should be one of your pure desires.

29:28.036 --> 29:32.071
Once you have this pure desire, your Kundalini becomes activated.

29:32.440 --> 29:35.162
I have seen that even very simple, normal people,

29:35.472 --> 29:38.516
when they narrate their experiences, I am surprised-

29:38.683 --> 29:41.277
how did such a thing happen to them?

29:42.293 --> 29:44.627
How did they give such a suggestion?

29:45.520 --> 29:50.400
In Sahaja Yoga also there are some people, who come for power.

29:51.330 --> 29:53.520
Some come for money.

29:54.510 --> 29:58.673
With all these things, the personality of a person is not developed.

29:58.966 --> 30:01.363
There is no glow in their personality.

30:01.648 --> 30:05.547
Because, the light that you have received;

30:06.007 --> 30:08.728
till the time you do not  share it with others;

30:09.086 --> 30:13.617
and within yourself also if you will not be enlightened,

30:13.922 --> 30:17.033
till then no effort will have any success.

30:17.997 --> 30:21.805
Which is to say that our only work is to change the world;

30:21.901 --> 30:23.511
to transform the world.

30:23.686 --> 30:27.654
We have to build a special world and you are special people.

30:28.277 --> 30:32.713
When you begin to understand how important you are,

30:32.967 --> 30:37.952
then with that understanding, you will make your life beautiful.

30:41.437 --> 30:43.426
Have spoken in English,

30:43.627 --> 30:46.567
and spoken in Hindi.

30:46.768 --> 30:50.389
There are so many Maharashtrian’s here

30:50.590 --> 30:53.397
that I should speak in Marathi too.

30:53.598 --> 30:55.364
But it is My wish

30:55.523 --> 30:59.820
that all the Sahaja Yogis who live in Maharashtra

31:00.021 --> 31:02.465
should at least learn the Hindi language,

31:02.666 --> 31:05.032
as it is our National language.

31:05.233 --> 31:11.896
We should love and be ready, if required be ready

31:12.097 --> 31:14.479
to sacrifice anything for our Nation.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.198
People were always ready to do that.

31:16.399 --> 31:18.315
This was the speciality of Maharashtra.

31:18.516 --> 31:21.088
Now the Maharashtra state, which I see,

31:21.306 --> 31:24.895
I don’t understand, where those people have gone.

31:25.096 --> 31:28.482
They took to the Gods and started doing their puja.

31:28.683 --> 31:34.626
After this was done and didn’t work out, they used another way;

31:34.827 --> 31:37.356
they have started going to this guru, that guru,

31:37.557 --> 31:41.316
then going to temples and all that.

31:41.517 --> 31:44.970
We should see what these people have achieved by doing this

31:45.171 --> 31:48.442
what was their benefit,

31:48.643 --> 31:51.760
and what you have achieved by doing Sahaja Yoga.

31:51.961 --> 31:53.990
So now just leave and forget everything

31:54.173 --> 31:58.584
and dedicate sincerely to yourselves

31:58.785 --> 32:03.238
and make your Kundalini to be in perfect state

32:03.439 --> 32:07.033
and through that you can do a tremendous work.

32:07.234 --> 32:13.325
Now, If I say, I am by birth Maharashtrian,

32:13.526 --> 32:17.411
it is very sad for Me to see

32:17.955 --> 32:20.425
that the Sahaja Yoga has spread in north India,

32:20.626 --> 32:24.787
though I have hardly made any effort there,

32:24.988 --> 32:29.061
but it has spread like fire in north India,

32:29.426 --> 32:33.505
which is very surprising.

32:34.906 --> 32:37.662
Why it has not worked out in Maharashtra?

32:37.863 --> 32:41.656
Sahaja Yoga has spread in all big and small villages of Maharashtra.

32:41.863 --> 32:47.565
One day a man had come to work at My place.

32:48.297 --> 32:50.864
He bowed down to Me and did namaskar

32:51.071 --> 32:52.766
so I asked him, “What happened?”

32:52.967 --> 32:57.752
He told Me: „Mataji Your photo is in every big and small villages,

32:57.953 --> 33:01.568
Your disciples are there in all our villages”.

33:01.769 --> 33:04.274
„How can that be?” - I asked.

33:04.475 --> 33:08.374
All of them say: "we are Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell us anything else".

33:08.575 --> 33:12.059
I was wondering how this happened and with whose blessings?

33:12.216 --> 33:16.712
As I was thinking nothing would work in this country,

33:16.913 --> 33:19.835
as too many people are superficial.

33:20.036 --> 33:22.496
But people of Maharashtra are very deep-rooted,

33:22.697 --> 33:25.511
the knowledge they have about everything is  deep-rooted,

33:25.712 --> 33:28.497
but, I don’t know where it has gone.

33:28.698 --> 33:30.091
I have always said

33:30.292 --> 33:34.080
that Sahaja Yogis should come in the collective minimum of minimum,

33:34.281 --> 33:38.312
and maximum of maximum give Realization to thousands of people.

33:38.513 --> 33:40.148
Every day we should only think

33:40.349 --> 33:43.182
how many people did we give Realization to,

33:43.383 --> 33:45.725
how many people

33:48.439 --> 33:50.995
did we awaken the Kundalini to.

33:51.196 --> 33:55.955
You have a job to save the entire world,

33:56.156 --> 33:59.844
as the Kundalini of the world is established in Maharashtra,

34:00.045 --> 34:02.042
and we have eight Ganeshas in Maharashtra,

34:02.243 --> 34:06.208
and three and a half Goddesses are manifested here.

34:06.409 --> 34:09.493
All the arrangements are done here,

34:09.694 --> 34:13.257
but, surprisingly, people do not take interest in that.

34:13.458 --> 34:15.802
People are so false, pretending to be what they are not,

34:16.003 --> 34:22.081
and waste time doing  mundane things.

34:23.036 --> 34:27.299
Instead of doing this, try to achieve the truth.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.452
Pay attention to the truth.

34:29.653 --> 34:33.082
Under any mythical ideea, if you try to do something good

34:33.283 --> 34:35.293
what are you going to achieve?

34:35.494 --> 34:37.441
If you don't change from within,

34:37.642 --> 34:40.275
you cannot achieve anything.

34:40.476 --> 34:47.239
The innate growth should be so deep and mature,

34:47.440 --> 34:51.974
that its fragrance should spread all over the world.

34:52.175 --> 34:56.526
Insted of that we get involved in petty things

34:56.727 --> 34:58.825
and fight among ourselves.

34:59.026 --> 35:00.652
This all should stop.

35:00.853 --> 35:04.351
Instead of that, I see

35:04.542 --> 35:08.189
that Yuva Shakti activities are very good.

35:08.390 --> 35:15.741
Due to yuvashakti the whole of Maharashtra will change.

35:15.942 --> 35:20.199
People who are highly placed,

35:20.993 --> 35:24.950
who are sitting in high positions,

35:25.151 --> 35:28.613
are very arrogant, terribly arrogant.

35:28.814 --> 35:32.270
It is very surprising from where they have got this arrogance.

35:32.471 --> 35:38.033
I fail to understand the reason for this arrogance.

35:38.234 --> 35:40.416
Because of this arrogance,

35:40.617 --> 35:46.291
we were not able to do any special Sahaja Yoga work in Maharashtra.

35:46.492 --> 35:51.688
So, it should be your aim to spread Sahaja Yoga

35:51.889 --> 35:55.544
and to establish people in Sahaja Yoga.

35:55.786 --> 35:59.318
Today is a very special day, the day of Shivratri.

35:59.519 --> 36:02.328
We should all take a pledge,

36:02.529 --> 36:05.881
and pledge to Shri Shiva to get His blessings.

36:06.082 --> 36:09.022
Due to His bliss in your heart,

36:09.223 --> 36:13.259
you will be surprised

36:13.460 --> 36:17.297
there will be flow of joy and flow of love.

36:17.498 --> 36:22.084
First of all, you get ready for that.

36:23.366 --> 36:25.968
You have light in our heart.

36:26.169 --> 36:29.082
This light if we do not spread,

36:29.283 --> 36:33.435
then we will be in darkness, along with others.

36:33.661 --> 36:36.018
So, we should all decide

36:36.219 --> 36:43.954
that we will give Realization to at least 100 people till next year.

36:44.155 --> 36:47.010
I know that if we go and speak to people about Sahaja Yoga,

36:47.211 --> 36:49.842
they won't agree, that is the issue.

36:50.043 --> 36:53.202
They think are over smart but don't have any common sense.

36:53.403 --> 36:56.443
But still if you explain them

36:56.644 --> 37:00.087
what you have gained and what you have benefitted,

37:00.300 --> 37:03.572
what you achieved and what you are still to achieve,

37:03.773 --> 37:07.053
then people may start believing you.

37:07.327 --> 37:08.951
They will trust that

37:09.152 --> 37:14.341
and they will gradually stop their wrong doings.

37:14.542 --> 37:16.434
This is our main responsibility.

37:16.635 --> 37:23.333
For this, you all have to think properly and should act accordingly.

37:23.534 --> 37:24.957
If this does not happen

37:25.158 --> 37:28.173
then I am not sure in what condition will be Maharashtra.

37:28.374 --> 37:32.278
Shivaji Maharaj has worked so hard for this state.

37:32.479 --> 37:37.109
There have been many saints in Maharashtra, unlike anywhere else,

37:37.310 --> 37:40.384
who have shed their blood

37:40.559 --> 37:43.334
for this great and holy land!

37:43.556 --> 37:45.481
That is why it is called Maharashtra.

37:45.656 --> 37:49.375
You should not fight for petty things,

37:49.576 --> 37:51.702
you should not live like petty people.

37:51.903 --> 37:55.817
There is no point, because you people are Realized souls now.

37:56.018 --> 37:59.492
Earlier, there were no Realized souls, but they were land soldiers.

37:59.693 --> 38:01.630
I fail to understand this,

38:01.831 --> 38:05.943
where these people have gone, the people from the royal community.

38:06.144 --> 38:08.111
People who never used to touch alcohol,

38:08.326 --> 38:11.393
are now drinking senselessly.

38:11.594 --> 38:14.818
Under this nonsense they are destroying themselves

38:15.009 --> 38:18.041
and are going away from Shiva.

38:19.506 --> 38:26.080
That is why people have said that God has taken lots of effort.

38:27.282 --> 38:29.107
Everything is done,

38:29.308 --> 38:33.677
but if you are facing the wrong direction then how it will work?

38:33.878 --> 38:36.921
Now you should explain it to people,

38:38.146 --> 38:40.325
from all your heart,

38:40.526 --> 38:46.283
and this is what I am telling you, in this Shiva puja.

38:46.484 --> 38:48.798
If Shiva gets angry,

38:49.029 --> 38:52.481
then He will be angry on Maharashtra first,

38:52.682 --> 38:55.469
as this is a special place for Him.

38:55.670 --> 38:59.478
You know how much people believe in Shiva,

38:59.679 --> 39:03.250
and you know whom Shri Shiva is worshiping first.

39:03.473 --> 39:06.286
For everybody in Maharashtra the first worshipped deity

39:06.487 --> 39:07.815
is Shri Ganesha.

39:08.016 --> 39:11.549
And if He gets disturbed then I am not sure what will happen.

39:11.750 --> 39:16.336
I don’t know when all this iniquity started in Maharashtra,

39:16.537 --> 39:23.950
and I am seeing what people are doing with Shri Ganesha’s idol.

39:24.151 --> 39:26.210
He is Shri Ganesha -

39:26.393 --> 39:30.624
if you insult Him, if you disrespect Him,

39:30.825 --> 39:34.552
then what will happen to you and who will save you?.

39:35.374 --> 39:40.899
So, you need to tell the people that they should get Realization

39:41.163 --> 39:43.206
and they should join Sahaja Yoga,

39:43.397 --> 39:45.705
and get their Kundalini awakened.

39:45.906 --> 39:47.792
Everybody is aware of it,

39:47.993 --> 39:50.247
right from Marchrindra Nath to Gorakh Nath,

39:50.438 --> 39:52.465
everyone has worked on it.

39:52.666 --> 39:54.719
Everyone has knowledge about it,

39:54.918 --> 39:57.963
and everybody knows that Kundalini has to be awakened.

39:58.164 --> 40:00.943
And in Marathi there are books about Kundalini,

40:01.144 --> 40:04.972
but the knowledge of books has remained within the books.

40:05.173 --> 40:08.446
But you should clearly explain about it to people:

40:08.647 --> 40:13.594
„Look, this is the time for you to get your resurection”.

40:13.795 --> 40:17.413
You should get ready for it.

40:17.614 --> 40:21.660
On this auspicious occasion of Shivratri,

40:21.861 --> 40:24.980
we should all decide

40:25.181 --> 40:30.076
that we will spread Sahaja Yoga in tremendous way.

40:30.277 --> 40:35.222
That is of utmost importance and nothing is beyond it in our life.

40:35.423 --> 40:38.517
All your work will be taken care of,

40:38.708 --> 40:41.039
if you practice Sahaja Yoga.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.420
You should meditate.

40:42.621 --> 40:46.639
If you don't meditate what is the point in being in Sahaja Yoga?

40:46.840 --> 40:51.394
Just coming here, singing and all and then going away,

40:51.595 --> 40:54.116
what is the meaning of it?

40:55.317 --> 40:59.867
The main thing is you should feel the Self within,

41:00.068 --> 41:02.057
the transformation in your personality.

41:02.258 --> 41:06.491
That will make you feel so happy

41:06.666 --> 41:09.643
and so proud of yourself.

41:09.844 --> 41:12.557
You will feel: „What we could do now?

41:12.788 --> 41:16.643
It is a very huge task, which should be done by you.

41:16.844 --> 41:21.833
On this auspicious occasion I am telling you,

41:22.034 --> 41:24.546
if you want to please Shri Shiva,

41:24.747 --> 41:27.906
you give Realization to a lot of people.

41:28.081 --> 41:31.096
It means Kundalini is His Shakti.

41:31.297 --> 41:34.120
So you should awaken their Kundalini,

41:34.321 --> 41:38.003
instead of wasting time unnecessarily on unimportant things.

41:38.204 --> 41:41.126
So have your attention on Kundalini awakening.

41:41.327 --> 41:44.015
By doing this, you will change the Maharashtra completely.

41:44.216 --> 41:48.709
There are few people who are creating problems,

41:48.891 --> 41:50.684
but they will get destroyed.

41:50.885 --> 41:53.183
First of all, you should give realization to others,

41:53.384 --> 41:59.195
it is important to give it to as many people as possible.

41:59.396 --> 42:01.471
This is your duty.

42:01.672 --> 42:04.467
Now, this is Shri Shiva puja,

42:04.668 --> 42:06.423
so during his Puja,

42:06.624 --> 42:10.142
establish Shri Shiva in your heart,

42:10.343 --> 42:13.277
so that you will never have problems.

42:13.478 --> 42:15.950
You have to keep Shri Shiva in your heart,

42:16.151 --> 42:18.976
so that when the kundalini is awakened,

42:19.177 --> 42:22.093
you become one with Him.

42:22.294 --> 42:27.564
This transformation takes place because of the light of Shri Shiva,

42:27.779 --> 42:29.544
as He is the Spirit.

42:29.753 --> 42:33.491
He is the reflection of Atma in our heart.

42:33.692 --> 42:37.769
So, in this state of reflection,

42:37.972 --> 42:40.597
you look in your heart, asking yourself:

42:40.798 --> 42:44.492
"Why are you lying and making a fool of yourself?".

42:44.693 --> 42:47.506
introspect youeself from within,

42:47.707 --> 42:52.217
I have tried explaining this to people - they just don’t understand.

42:52.418 --> 42:56.646
They say: "Mother, we heard this lecture today, other another day".

42:56.847 --> 42:58.955
Listening my lectures won’t help you.

42:59.156 --> 43:01.587
If you want to help yourself,

43:01.788 --> 43:06.042
you will have to establish in Sahaja Yoga with full dedication.

43:06.243 --> 43:11.184
This is My request to you all, a request with all My love.

43:11.385 --> 43:14.686
May God bless you all.
