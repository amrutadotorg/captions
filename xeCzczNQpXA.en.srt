1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:08,074
It has been a very, very joyful evening 
for all of us.

2
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:13,637
And we thank all the people who have 
brought

3
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:19,313
all kinds of entertainment for all of us.

4
00:00:19,576 --> 00:00:23,860
I’m really amazed because last time 
I couldn’t go to Spain

5
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:31,143
despite they had invited Me, but I think 
somehow it has taken roots there,

6
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:38,258
there are so many people who are now 
involved in Sahaja Yoga.

7
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:45,355
It’s very important that places like Spain 
should have

8
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:49,433
many more sahaja yogis I think, I always 
thought,

9
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:53,486
because it’s a country visited by so many 
people,

10
00:00:53,687 --> 00:01:01,317
so cosmopolitan, and there are quite a lot 
of Turkish influence also.

11
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:06,304
Despite that we found it was not so much 
encouraging,

12
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,912
and Jose was extremely upset with the whole 
thing.

13
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:14,217
And he said: “Mother, what has happened 
to these people here?”.

14
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:17,988
It’s alright now, as you see, it’s very 
encouraging,

15
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:24,144
we have so many beautiful singers, 
musicians from Spain,

16
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:28,151
and there are so many people here who have 
come

17
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:32,402
to entertain you with their beautiful, 
melodious music –

18
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:37,876
specially their rhythm is something really 
extraordinary.

19
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:45,663
Indian music has a rhythm of its own, but 
it’s very bound by its systems,

20
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:50,478
while I find here is absolutely a freedom 
to play whichever way you like,

21
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:55,301
your tabla whichever way you like, your 
rhythmic patterns,

22
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:59,046
which is a very great thing to achieve 
also that freedom

23
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:03,295
despite the fact that it keeps the rhythm 
on.

24
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:10,415
Now the another thing we have to now say 
about the

25
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:17,018
way Belgian people have sung very well, 
and the way they have shown their love.

26
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,612
Belgium is another very important country, 
where of course there is

27
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:27,821
European, as you know, capital, and that’s 
a very important country

28
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:32,364
where I’m very happy that Sahaja Yoga 
is taking its roots.

29
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:39,262
Last time I was so happy because the leader 
from Belgium

30
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:42,472
used to always say: “Mother, now what 
to do, this Belgian

31
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:46,137
government is funny, and the Belgian people 
are funny”, and all that.

32
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:50,528
Suddenly he said: “It’s become different 
now”. I said: “Why?”.

33
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:54,903
“Because newspapers are only writing 
against the Catholic Church

34
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,252
and they have forgotten us completely”.

35
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:12,432
That’s very a promising thing that people 
are now taking to Sahaja Yoga in Belgium

36
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:18,487
in such a serious manner, and they must 
understand their responsibility

37
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:24,685
as they have got the capital of Europe with 
them.

38
00:03:24,886 --> 00:03:32,658
So they have to be people of very lofty 
ideas and of very high culture.

39
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:39,900
I must say for art, they are real artists 
there, they really respect art,

40
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:43,180
and they have a great sense of art, even 
now

41
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:46,997
after all this modern art has come, all 
these things have come.

42
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:54,243
But I think that the number of artists we 
have in Belgium in Sahaja Yoga

43
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:58,219
are the largest in the whole of Europe, 
it’s surprising,

44
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:06,190
but there are so many artists in our Belgian 
Sahaja Yoga,

45
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:11,673
that sometimes I feel that it’s a 
combination, say, music coming from Spain,

46
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:17,728
and from Belgium this art is coming, it’s 
really great.

47
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:23,828
Now we have Holland, and Holland also now 
coming up in music, I must say,

48
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:30,034
but the way they showed the sahaja yogis 
to begin with, how they are

49
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:34,866
and how gradually they change when their 
ego and their…

50
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:41,025
superego burst out is very realistic. 
I’ve seen this.

51
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,934
I’m sorry.

52
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:53,128
I’ve seen it, you see, sometimes that some 
sahaja yogis, you see, in the beginning,

53
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:57,976
they are not all of them like that they were 
showing in Belgium - in Holland,

54
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:02,617
but some sahaja yogis in the beginning, 
you just don’t understand them

55
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:08,771
what they are talking about. And – see, 
they just start talking so big and,

56
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:14,047
as if they have read too much maybe, or 
they are too much conditioned,

57
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,844
whatever it is. Then you just look at them,

58
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:20,565
with understanding there’s something wrong 
somewhere,

59
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:27,117
and ultimately really the conditioning goes 
away and the ego also bursts out,

60
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:30,193
and then they become very good sahaja 
yogis.

61
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:35,501
But so many sahaja yogis are there who just 
jumped into Sahaja Yoga.

62
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:40,258
That’s something also very remarkable. But 
sometimes who jump very fast

63
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:45,698
do not go very deep, it’s a very funny thing 
about human beings I can’t understand.

64
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,194
That sometimes they take time to take 
to Sahaj Yog,

65
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:52,209
and once they take to Sahaja Yoga they go 
very deep.

66
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,311
And sometimes they take no time, they just 
jumped into it,

67
00:05:57,512 --> 00:06:02,018
and then afterwards you just don’t 
understand why they are still

68
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:09,774
at the same point, same height, and they’re 
still not going deep into it.

69
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:17,323
So it’s all has something to do I think 
with all the education one must have had,

70
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:22,324
or maybe the way they are brought up, 
or maybe their childhood, or maybe

71
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:27,624
some psychological problem – or could be 
some sort of a egoistical treatment

72
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:32,501
they have developed or some sort 
of a complication within.

73
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:38,739
But that doesn’t matter, ultimately 
everybody comes up and become

74
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,992
a very good source of Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja 
Yoga is now on your shoulders,

75
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:50,047
you have to look after it, you have 
to spread it.

76
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:54,119
Music is one way you can spread – in India, 
Maharashtra specially,

77
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,195
every Saturday they take a truck,

78
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:01,708
on the truck so many musicians go from 
places to places,

79
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:06,459
and they arrange the program there, give 
a program and then talk about Sahaja Yoga.

80
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,950
Like that it’s spreading very fast, that 
way, even in Delhi.

81
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:14,459
In Delhi I was surprised which I used 
to think is nothing,

82
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,528
absolutely an empty shell, but Delhi has 
become so great now.

83
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:26,635
Because the people started going round to 
other villages, and spreading Sahaja Yoga,

84
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:30,117
and developing that confidence within 
themselves.

85
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:33,630
The confidence comes when you give 
realizations to others.

86
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:38,757
Apart from that, the joy that you get 
by giving realization is the greatest.

87
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:44,537
You – as if like a mother when she gives 
birth to a child, how happy she feels.

88
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:49,258
In the same way you also feel that you have 
been able to give realizations to others,

89
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,731
and that is how Sahaja Yoga spreads a lot. 
Now from Finland, I’m very happy

90
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:59,075
that people have come all the way from 
Finland, because

91
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:03,781
so far I didn’t go to Finland, and they 
have been doing some work

92
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:08,393
also in the Belarus - is that right? 
(Somebody says something)

93
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:13,566
Yes. So you see, it’s a thing they are 
moving out from their place

94
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:18,410
and going to these places which I may not 
be able to reach.

95
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:22,289
And other Scandinavian countries are also 
represented here,

96
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,573
and I wish I could go sometime to 
Scandinavia to spread Sahaja Yoga there.

97
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:33,188
I’ve been there, but – I’ve been to Finland 
also, as I must say,

98
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:38,118
but I didn’t do any work for Sahaja Yoga 
there.

99
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:44,027
So, you see, Finland I went later on, but 
other Scandinavian countries also

100
00:08:44,228 --> 00:08:51,947
I wish I could go, and if My health permits 
and My age as you know is –

101
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:56,492
traveling becomes rather difficult for Me. 
But in that case I would request all of you

102
00:08:56,693 --> 00:09:01,460
to do something in all these countries 
where I may not have touched

103
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:03,969
or maybe Sahaja Yoga is not growing.

104
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,019
Where Sahaja Yoga is not growing you should 
go all out to help them.

105
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,451
It’s a very remarkable thing how we come 
from different countries

106
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,487
and different cultures, speaking different 
languages,

107
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:22,680
and how we understand the language of heart, 
language of love, which is Divine love.

108
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:32,255
So tomorrow will be our great Puja of 
Kundalini – they call it Kundalini Puja,

109
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:38,535
or Adi Shakti Puja, whatever they may call 
it – but I think I’ll be able

110
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:45,888
to say something new tomorrow for all 
of you to enjoy.

111
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:51,690
I cannot entertain as you can entertain, 
but somehow I’ve seen that My  –

112
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:58,775
whatever I’m saying you all listen to Me 
so intensely

113
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:04,582
that must be some entertainment there, 
I think so.

114
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:11,959
So may God bless you all. Have a nice 
evening and sleep now.

115
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,067
And tomorrow morning I have asked some 
people to see Me.

116
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:22,260
I hope they will come and see Me and 
I'll be very happy.

117
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:26,031
May God bless you. May God bless you.
