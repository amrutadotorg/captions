WEBVTT

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:20.494
There is a self-driven power inside us which
is called the Autonomous Nervous System
in English.

00:00:21.824 --> 00:00:39.784
It's located subtly in the medulla oblongata,
inside the spinal cord in our back.

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:52.767
I told you that these are the three subtle powers
which make our Autonomous Nervous System work.

00:00:53.072 --> 00:01:08.992
Those two powers which are on the left and right,
one is called Ida and the other Pingala and
the one in the middle is called Sushumna.

00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:19.801
They are the three channels and the three powers
on these three channels are namely,
the one on the left side

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:27.464
is Mahakali, the one on the right is Mahasaraswati
and the one in the middle is Mahalakshmi.

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:38.157
Our existence and dissolution is due to Mahakali
Shakti, our body is formed by Mahasaraswati

00:01:38.413 --> 00:01:45.953
as well as all our thinking work/thought process
- whatever suggestions we have for the future,
whatever planning we do,

00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:52.313
we think, we implement, whatever
creative capacities we have,

00:01:52.313 --> 00:02:01.176
are all displayed and manifested through it.
And the power in between

00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:09.982
which we call the power of Mahalakshmi,
in which the people of this city of Bombay
believe very much,

00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:17.351
it is through this Mahalakshmi power that
our evolution takes place.

00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:23.286
We have evolved from amoeba to the human
form today because of this power only.

00:02:23.286 --> 00:02:29.716
Because of this power we sustain ourselves;
Dhaarana means to sustain.

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:43.466
The qualities of every single substance, as I
told you yesterday that carbon has four valencies,
the nature of every single substance,

00:02:43.532 --> 00:02:54.932
or it's, what we say, properties all come through
this power and the sustenance of religion in a
human being is also due to this.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:03:00.565
A human being does also have some religion/attributes of
his own, otherwise why would he be called a human being?

00:03:00.712 --> 00:03:10.472
He has ten attributes/virtues, which can in a simpler
way be said, that the Ten Commandments in
the Bible are those ten virtues.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:18.912
These ten dharmas have many more subtle forms
about which we have mention in our scriptures
since ancient times.

00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:23.392
Many saints and sages found out
and have written a lot on it.

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:31.990
The last thing I was telling you yesterday about
Dharma, because while describing the three Chakras,

00:03:31.993 --> 00:03:44.113
when we came to the navel chakra, I said that
Lakshmiji has a very close connection with
dharma because religion is in our stomach.

00:03:46.362 --> 00:03:51.562
Religion is not in the thought/mind. The person who
practices religion with the mind is not religious.

00:03:51.677 --> 00:03:58.317
Religion is not through thoughts, it is
in our stomach. Like, I tell you a simple thing,

00:03:58.317 --> 00:04:02.395
that if there is a truly religious man, that is,
one who should be called a realized soul -

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:07.766
I don't consider that person religious who walks
around with a big mark or badge but one who is a
dedicated person from within,

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:14.196
one who has become one with God, who is a
Yogi in the true sense, who is a realized soul,

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:22.108
if that person goes to the house of someone
who has committed murder and harassed people,

00:04:22.108 --> 00:04:27.730
as soon as he eats food at that man's house, he
will start vomiting. He will not be able to bear it.

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:34.125
He will not be able to see any naked woman.
As soon as he sees her, he will feel
like vomiting.

00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:36.618
His stomach won't be able to bear it.

00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:42.022
There must be many people among you who can't
even eat food at someone else's house.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:45.294
Going to their houses, they will
definitely feel like vomiting.

00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:52.245
No one can tell the reason for this. The simple reason
is that your religion[dharma] is not compatible
with the religion which is in that house.

00:04:54.445 --> 00:05:01.875
You may also have experienced many such
things in your life for which you might
not have found the answer.

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:06.650
When our Dharma becomes weak or
when man's Dharma starts declining,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.430
the moment his religion starts declining,
gradually he starts compromising with life.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.512
When his compromise begins, he gradually
becomes weak.

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:24.810
As soon as he becomes weak, sometimes some
evil spirits also come upon him.
Sometimes he himself becomes a evil spirit.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.003
When man falls from Dharma, he can only
descend into the devilish/subhuman form.

00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:37.901
Because now he can neither be born as an
animal nor can he be born as a deity.

00:05:39.114 --> 00:05:44.084
So being a human when he falls/strays from
his religion then where will he go?

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:49.169
He has to go to the demonic form or
he has to go to the state of Hell.

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.075
Now whether Hell exists or not, is there
any proof of this or not, what is it's proof,
Mataji please show us scientifically.

00:05:55.075 --> 00:06:00.256
So that cannot be done, but yes, for sure it is,
that I showed it to you even today morning

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:03.787
and yesterday too, I showed you the pulsation
of the Kundalini, which you can see.

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:10.819
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini
with your own eyes, even though you have
not been realized yet.

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.161
And those who have been realized have also
experienced the peace about which I am talking,

00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:21.336
that thoughtlessness where a person becomes
silent and within him all his thoughts stop

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:26.161
and he becomes a witness and starts watching.
This happening takes place.

00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:30.991
What scientific proof can be given
for what happens inside you?

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:35.134
Suppose you are listening to some nice,
beautiful music and you say you are enjoying it

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:38.203
give some scientific proof for this,
then how can it be given?

00:06:38.203 --> 00:06:45.733
You become, this happens within you, and
cool vibrations start flowing through you.

00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:50.003
This happened to many among you yesterday
and you experienced it too

00:06:50.003 --> 00:06:55.494
and many people must have benefited from it
too and should move ahead in this.

00:06:56.642 --> 00:07:02.092
Those people who have understood this matter
deeply and have moved forward have reached
great heights today.

00:07:02.092 --> 00:07:06.251
While living in this world, they have become
superior to many sages and saints,

00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:11.322
and how many people they are giving realization,
and curing many of them also.

00:07:11.322 --> 00:07:19.645
Even diseases like cancer - we have a simple school
teacher here, he has cured cancer of so many people.

00:07:19.645 --> 00:07:24.165
And he is a very accomplished man,
although he is a very simple teacher.

00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:29.713
He has reached great heights and in Kundalini Shastra,
he is absolutely very [wise and] knowledgeable.

00:07:29.713 --> 00:07:37.785
He has acquired so much knowledge about Kundalini
Shastra that you'll be surprised as to where
this man has gained so much knowledge from.

00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:44.215
You have not known anything till now. When you
start knowing, then whatever deep/profound knowledge
there is,

00:07:44.215 --> 00:07:48.565
everything starts flowing from within because
first there must be the power to know.

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:54.094
One who doesn't have the power to know - if you
do not have the power to listen, then how
will you understand what I am saying.

00:07:54.094 --> 00:07:58.278
If you don't have the power to see, then how
will you be able to see what I'm showing you?

00:07:58.278 --> 00:08:03.708
Therefore this cannot happen without your
consciousness becoming subtle first.

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:09.548
Yesterday a gentleman came and told me,
"My brother's sickness, one of your
disciples was not able to cure,"

00:08:09.548 --> 00:08:17.971
and I have no faith in You," So I said,
"If you don't even have any faith in Me,
then what brought you here?"

00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:24.092
"If I cure your brother, you will have
faith in Me; What compulsion is this."

00:08:24.152 --> 00:08:31.602
"I have not taken any money from you, what
right do you have over Me, that you can
tell Me, 'I should cure your brother.'"

00:08:31.602 --> 00:08:39.035
You are saying to Me with so much authority,
" Awaken my Kundalini," so what
right do you have after all?

00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:44.875
Your right is that you have accepted Me
as your Mother, you have faith in Me,

00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:49.225
otherwise, I have nothing to take from
you, nor can you give Me anything.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:55.559
But if you don't have faith at all, then
you just think, all these Deities sitting
on the chakras,

00:08:55.559 --> 00:09:01.322
will they accept the fact that you have absolutely
no faith in Me, no faith in these Gods,

00:09:01.322 --> 00:09:06.556
you don't have faith in God, you abuse
everyone morning-evening, and
will they run around and work for you?

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:14.849
If there is an ordinary officer, then he
has so much protocol, then how much
protocol will that God Almighty have!

00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:20.573
We have become so egoistic that we think
that, "Our Kundalini should be awakened,

00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:26.610
this should happen for us, that should happen
for us, and we have absolutely no faith in God,
we are big shots," - so be where you are.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.130
It is very difficult for such people to get
realization. Let me tell you before hand.

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:37.873
It is important that you come with faith.
Farmers have a lot of faith.

00:09:37.873 --> 00:09:45.688
I had gone to Rahuri, I was surprised thousands
of people had come; Crowds of five-five, six-six
thousand were getting realization just like that.

00:09:45.688 --> 00:09:50.417
(UNCLEAR) was saying, "What kind of sons of
Mother Earth are they, how quickly they
are getting it."

00:09:50.417 --> 00:09:55.958
There were some educated people, some
rich people too - it was not that they
were all completely illiterate -

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.341
there were some illiterate people too,
but everyone was getting realization very quickly.

00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:03.604
So I asked them, "What is the matter?" They said,
"Mother, we have great reverence for You."

00:10:03.604 --> 00:10:08.370
So I asked, "Why do you have faith?"
They replied, "We do have. We are farming people."

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:13.215
"How can we do farming without faith?
Farming cannot be done without faith."

00:10:13.575 --> 00:10:18.455
It is correct. Farming can't be done without faith.

00:10:18.524 --> 00:10:23.554
When a man thinks about how the
land/earth makes a seed grow,

00:10:23.554 --> 00:10:28.798
on her own She gives us so many fruits
and doesn’t want us to give her anything.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:35.710
Seeing it, man is certainly amazed and realizes
what a great miracle it is, what a great wonder it is!

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.958
And when we go to the market here and
buy things, we take it for granted.

00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:44.460
We don't feel that something special
is happening or is a miracle.

00:10:46.684 --> 00:10:55.434
Having faith in God is a natural thing,
very natural, because whatever we have got,

00:10:55.434 --> 00:10:59.632
just think; today we have become human beings
from an amoeba, we have not evolved on our own.

00:10:59.632 --> 00:11:05.193
God Himself has incarnated in the world many times.
- He took ten incarnations in the world

00:11:05.193 --> 00:11:10.774
and in those ten Incarnations, He has worked very
hard in every Incarnation and has helped you people

00:11:10.774 --> 00:11:15.745
to reach to this state. This is correct. Whether
it is or not we will later make you realize.

00:11:15.745 --> 00:11:20.579
We told you yesterday itself that as a
scientist, you just keep your minds open.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.754
After that we will show you each and every thing.

00:11:24.342 --> 00:11:30.192
Before such an Almighty God we must come
with our heads bowed down.

00:11:30.192 --> 00:11:33.758
The person who thinks himself to be higher
than God should stay at his place.

00:11:33.758 --> 00:11:38.199
But he is in one sense. God has made
man higher than Himself.

00:11:38.199 --> 00:11:43.742
This is true in one sense, where even God
is at a loss and I also am.

00:11:43.742 --> 00:11:50.664
That is, God has given you freedom.
You have to choose your own evolution

00:11:50.664 --> 00:11:56.554
when you come to the level of a human being,
upon reaching this plane, you will have
to search it in your freedom.

00:11:56.554 --> 00:12:00.775
We cannot force you, that if we want we enchant you,

00:12:00.775 --> 00:12:06.841
that we make you unconscious, that we put
you in a trance, that we befool you,
it cannot happen like this.

00:12:06.841 --> 00:12:14.805
You have to choose it, you have to take this
decision in full consciousness, in full awareness,

00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:22.589
this has to be accepted that, 'Yes, I am going to
go on the path of God, I want to know the
power of God.' Only then will it happen.

00:12:22.757 --> 00:12:32.147
In this sense you are the highest. This
question does not arise in other creatures,
this question is of human beings.

00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:37.712
And that is why God bows down before man
bcause his evolution, his development,

00:12:37.712 --> 00:12:41.114
on reaching this state, just can't
happen without freedom.

00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:45.864
Because if I want to make you kings, then
only in your freedom can I make you kings.

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:52.203
If you yourself are dependent, and if
you are doing something because of Me,
then how can we make you a king.

00:12:53.218 --> 00:13:02.138
This is the greatest liberation, the greatest freedom,
and for the greatest liberation, first the
intellect of man must be somewhat free.

00:13:02.138 --> 00:13:06.388
His decision should be made freely.
Every person should in complete freedom

00:13:06.388 --> 00:13:14.461
must accept that, 'Yes, we want this.'
Absolute faith means absolute freedom.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:23.801
Yesterday I told you about the three chakras
- today many new people have come -

00:13:24.144 --> 00:13:31.444
and among them I told that Mooladhara Chakra
is at the bottom. It contains the power
of Shri Ganesha, which is Eternal Childhood.

00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:38.812
And the important point of this I told is
that the Mooladhar, which is of
The Goddess, of Gauriji,

00:13:38.812 --> 00:13:48.816
or what should be called the triangular place
of Kundalini Shakti - is below it,
not above it, it is below it.

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:57.955
So if Kundalini has to be raised, then the Mooladhara
Chakra, which controls sex, should not be touched.

00:13:57.955 --> 00:14:04.780
Mooladhara Chakra is related to sex
because Shri Ganesha is a small child

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.344
and He, small children, do not know
anything regarding this.

00:14:09.344 --> 00:14:12.212
They are innocent, they have innocence.

00:14:12.212 --> 00:14:18.837
Sex has no role to play in the Kundalini
awakening or in the evolution of humans.

00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:30.501
He is already sublimated. But man at
this time has an opposite relationship.

00:14:30.501 --> 00:14:38.364
It is such that when he spreads his hands in front
of God and desires that his Kundalini be awakened,

00:14:38.364 --> 00:14:44.873
he should know that Kundalini is my Mother.
She is my Holy Mother who is forever with me.

00:14:44.873 --> 00:14:53.243
And he should have thoughts towards Her like
an extremely pure child, just like
Shri Ganesha had towards Gauri Ji.

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:58.591
Later on, Tantrikas came to our
country and negated the efforts/did the opposite.

00:14:58.591 --> 00:15:02.274
If I get time someday, I will tell you about
tantric as well, but the thing is,

00:15:02.274 --> 00:15:06.730
that by doing such negative things they have
spread total destruction in this country.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:18.583
But whatever is the Truth, remains indestructible
and persists. Our country, India, is the real
land of Yoga.

00:15:18.602 --> 00:15:24.702
This is such a huge land of Yoga that
no falsehood can last long here.

00:15:24.702 --> 00:15:30.206
This thing is correct and that is why this
work can be done in this country even today.

00:15:30.206 --> 00:15:35.812
Otherwise, many attempts have been made in
this country to break the sanctity of this
country but it could not be broken.

00:15:35.812 --> 00:15:40.540
Many people did. Uptil now there have been
such people who are spreading bad things.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:47.269
But this country could not break down in the way
other Western countries got completely destroyed.

00:15:48.244 --> 00:15:56.114
How amazing it is that this sacred relationship
between mother and son still exists in our country!

00:15:58.718 --> 00:16:05.458
I told you about our second chakra,
Swadhisthana Chakra, through which
we do all our creative work

00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:15.773
and whose power is Saraswati. The third chakra, I told you
was of Lakshmi ji and Narayan, i.e. Vishnu ji.

00:16:17.397 --> 00:16:30.870
In the space formed around this chakra,
Brahmaji has created the entire universe.

00:16:30.898 --> 00:16:38.388
And this universe which has been created
in today's condition/stage is called Bhavsagar.

00:16:38.388 --> 00:16:43.174
It has many conditions, stages - in
this stage it is called Bhava Sagar.

00:16:43.537 --> 00:16:54.177
That is why we say that 'Make us cross the ocean of
illusion, save us from the ocean of illusion' - the
world is an ocean, whatever has happened, the ocean remains.

00:16:54.488 --> 00:17:03.668
In this ocean, this world in which we have
come and this world in which we are living,
this should be called Bhavasagar.

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:14.159
And it is also true that presently it is Kalyug.
Now it is Kalyug, a very terrible kind of Kalyug,

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:23.045
and simultaneously the Satyug has also begun.
Kaliyug is going on, along with it Satyayug
has also begun.

00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:37.311
In this ocean of illusion a very great
power has incarnated within us repeatedly.

00:17:37.815 --> 00:17:46.345
This is the picture of Virata and this is the
Bhavsagara. The name of this power is Guru Sampada.

00:17:47.562 --> 00:18:01.082
Adi Guru Dattatreya has taken birth many times
in this world. Adinath,  in whom Jains believe,
is His Incarnation.

00:18:03.347 --> 00:18:10.007
After that Dattatreyaji is also His incarnation.
King Janaka is His incarnation.

00:18:11.635 --> 00:18:17.825
Whom we call Nanaka and Nanaki
are also Janaka and Janaki.

00:18:19.353 --> 00:18:26.673
And Mohammed Saheb was also His incarnation
and His daughter Fatima was also Janaki.

00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:37.176
Her two sons were Luv and Kush. Later on, they
are born many a times after coming to this world.

00:18:38.772 --> 00:18:51.232
First they were Luv and Kush. After
Luv and Kush, they came into this
world as Mahavira and Buddha.

00:18:51.232 --> 00:18:59.963
And later on they took birth as Hasan and
Hussain, the two sons of Fatima.

00:18:59.963 --> 00:19:05.605
Whether this is true or not, you
should test it again on Kundalini.

00:19:05.627 --> 00:19:13.497
Like, a Muslim doctor who lives in Iran,
came to Me in London and said to Me

00:19:13.497 --> 00:19:17.361
That, "Mother, I have a really bad type
of cancer and how do I cure it?"

00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:23.355
I said, "You are a Muslim and you will not have
faith in any other Guru except Mohammed Saheb."

00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:26.682
So he said, 'Yes.' I said,
"Then I can't cure your cancer."

00:19:26.682 --> 00:19:31.777
Started saying, 'Why?' I said, "It is caused
by imbalance - cancer is always caused by imbalance."

00:19:31.777 --> 00:19:40.567
This feeling is so strong and deeply embedded within
you that Mohammed Saheb is the only Incarnation
and can't there be other incarnations of Him?

00:19:40.567 --> 00:19:45.383
Although Mohammed Saheb has said a thousand
times that, 'Many more like Me will come.'

00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:53.977
He has said this many times, but Muslims are not
ready to accept that many like Him have
come and will come.

00:19:54.904 --> 00:19:58.694
So he said, 'He has said so but I
haven't seen anyone.'

00:19:58.694 --> 00:20:03.544
I said, "Well, if you chant the mantra
of Dattatreya, I can cure you."

00:20:03.544 --> 00:20:08.362
At first that Muslim gentleman got very
angry, he went away, annoyed with Me.

00:20:08.362 --> 00:20:12.116
After that - but cancer is such a
disease that what to do -

00:20:12.116 --> 00:20:15.539
he came back again running and said, "Okay
Mother, I am ready to do whatever You say."

00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:22.114
Now his health is fine, because
Dattatreya Himself cannot accept this

00:20:22.114 --> 00:20:25.034
that why are we dividing Him into
so many divisions?

00:20:25.153 --> 00:20:30.053
Man wants to divide himself in this way.
God does not want to divide Himself.

00:20:30.122 --> 00:20:35.262
Man wants that, 'I am a Muslim, I am a Hindu'
- this is disgusting for God.

00:20:36.028 --> 00:20:42.678
It's weird to say, 'I am the nose, I am the eye,
I am the ear.' - to talk stupidly like that.

00:20:43.212 --> 00:20:49.782
God has created man in the whole universe;
Not to mould him into different shapes.

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:55.806
There are many flowers blooming on the same tree.
After taking those flowers and plucking them,

00:20:55.806 --> 00:21:00.191
after killing them you people are fighting amongst
yourselves that, 'This religion is different,
that religion is different.'

00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:05.018
Just yesterday a gentleman had come from
Delhi – let me tell you his story.

00:21:05.232 --> 00:21:10.522
He too is in a lot of problem; he is realized
but he said, "This void of mine,"

00:21:10.522 --> 00:21:15.179
what we call the void, Bhavasagar, "Is caught."
I said, I asked him many things.

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:19.140
I said, "Is this your problem, is that yours?"
He said, "No," I said, "Are you a Jan Sanghi?"

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:24.817
He said, "Yes, I am a great Jan Sanghi at heart."
I said, "That is why it is happening -
now sit down and do namaaz to Mohammad Saheb."

00:21:24.817 --> 00:21:28.335
"Become a Muslim for a while." He said,
"Mataji, what are You saying?"

00:21:28.335 --> 00:21:34.538
I said, "Be and see. Try being a Muslim
for a few days," and soon after,

00:21:34.538 --> 00:21:38.137
[MARATHI]

00:21:38.137 --> 00:21:45.631
"Try becoming a Muslim and then you
will see that you will be alright/fine."

00:21:45.631 --> 00:21:51.053
I said, "Okay, you take the name of Mohammed
Saheb for a while." As soon as he took the name,
vibrations started coming from within him.

00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:59.153
Vibrations start. If what I am saying
is false, you can know it on vibrations.

00:21:59.153 --> 00:22:05.599
Your vibrations will immediately tell you
what is truth and what is falsehood.
You do not know the Absolute thing yet.

00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:11.242
Mother is saying this is true, he is saying
that that is true, you check each and everything.
It is evident before us.

00:22:11.255 --> 00:22:16.955
You people are just like computers; only your
computer needs to be put into the mains now.

00:22:16.955 --> 00:22:21.715
As soon as you are put to the mains, you will
immediately know which thing is true and
which thing is false.

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:26.801
I told about some Gurus that, 'These Gurus are
not good', then that gentleman got very angry.

00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:29.429
I said, "Okay, you get your realization, then see."

00:22:29.429 --> 00:22:34.087
After that, his condition is such that whenever
anyone takes the name of that Guru, he says,
'Oh God, whose name have you taken?'

00:22:34.087 --> 00:22:39.605
They run away from there. One must recognize
who is true and who is false.

00:22:39.605 --> 00:22:44.286
Should I not say who is truthful is
truthful and who is false is false?

00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:51.141
If you read Kabir Das, in all his verses
that he has written,

00:22:51.211 --> 00:22:56.121
he has said in all of them that these people
wearing robes and those who instigate quarrels

00:22:56.121 --> 00:23:00.954
and these monks who take money and these
fraudsters and those who are tantriks

00:23:00.954 --> 00:23:04.170
all these, he has lashed out at one
and all and those who do khichari,

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:08.762
everything, he has set everyone right,
but who will read Kabir Das?

00:23:11.406 --> 00:23:16.256
I tell you that no one among the Hindi
speaking people would have read Kabirdas.

00:23:16.256 --> 00:23:22.969
Manohar Kahaniyaan - Even if he is an M.A. in Hindi,
he will still keep reading Manohar Kahaniyaan
[A MAGAZINE].

00:23:24.037 --> 00:23:30.127
This is the disposition/inclination of man
today. The disposition of the people of
India has become very shallow.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.710
When you read Kabirdas, you get goosebumps.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:40.584
A single man, being at the level of a weaver,
has lashed out at everyone in such a manner,
what is called lashing.

00:23:40.584 --> 00:23:46.384
He has exposed every single person,
those who show magic and witchcraft.

00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:51.931
Look at Nanak. Nanak has written chapters
after chapters on these hypocrites.

00:23:51.931 --> 00:23:57.237
There are chapters after chapters written on
those who make money, on those who show miracles.

00:23:57.237 --> 00:24:00.183
Why does one need to go anywhere;
Read these people.

00:24:00.919 --> 00:24:06.649
Marathi people must have read Tukaram a lot
but nobody knows how much he has written on it.

00:24:07.143 --> 00:24:16.573
And even if they know, they will close their
eyes and say 'This is our guru'. For Marathi
people, Gurus gets stuck to them like stamps.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:23.810
Then you can't say anything about them. Who is
your Guru? So, he is the Guru of that place.

00:24:23.853 --> 00:24:26.953
Well, what is his name? Now you have accepted him.

00:24:26.953 --> 00:24:31.352
"And even if he runs away with my wife,
it doesn't matter - she has become my mother."

00:24:35.544 --> 00:24:38.844
And Gujaratis don't have time at all
- they're all just collecting money.

00:24:40.418 --> 00:24:45.528
Where is God? Shown some lamp,
work's done, let's go.

00:24:47.405 --> 00:24:57.115
We have come to this state, this land of Yoga,
in seriousness, to the country in which
we have our living, where we live,

00:24:57.416 --> 00:25:02.846
how serious/solemn we should be there,
how devoted should we be to God.

00:25:02.846 --> 00:25:08.968
Nobody thinks how deeply one should delve
into it. Nobody has time for God.

00:25:09.186 --> 00:25:13.276
There is time to do all the works,
but there is no time for God.

00:25:13.438 --> 00:25:18.968
And that is where all the joy lies, son.
There is no joy anywhere else, let Me
tell you the truth.

00:25:18.968 --> 00:25:25.864
You may search for anything. This very Guru
Sampada was very powerful in our country, India.

00:25:25.864 --> 00:25:30.607
There have been great teachers elsewhere too
- no one can say that -
Confucius is his incarnation.

00:25:30.607 --> 00:25:36.199
There are many great Gurus in other places too,
but in our country it has been a great asset.

00:25:36.199 --> 00:25:46.136
There was Gyaneshwarji - there were so many
great Gurus - there was Ramdas Swami. But
their only influence on us was just singing songs.

00:25:46.238 --> 00:25:54.148
Take their hymns and keep singing from morning to
evening 'Search your heart, brother',
'Search your heart, brother', 'Search your heart, brother'.

00:25:54.148 --> 00:25:59.505
Okay, they just gave a prescription to search for
the pot(heart). You people just go on singing the same

00:25:59.505 --> 00:26:02.618
that, 'Search the pot only, search the pot(Heart) only'
- but when will you search?

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:14.470
People sing Kabir Das' Bhajans with great enthusiasm.
He has sung that 'Song(Beats) of the heart can
be heard on the silent top of our head'.

00:26:15.432 --> 00:26:20.892
The complete description of Kundalini is
already given by him. Meaning I'm not
going to tell you anything new.

00:26:21.034 --> 00:26:26.964
He has sung and said everything
'Ida, Pingla, Sukhman Nadi re'.

00:26:26.964 --> 00:26:31.924
People will sit with a harmonium, play the tabla
and sing loudly. 'Oh people, what are you singing?'

00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:35.043
'Kabir Das.' What are you singing?
What is written in it?

00:26:39.293 --> 00:26:45.723
Meaning this has also become a means
of entertainment. Singers' group means,
people are crazily engaged in it.

00:26:45.912 --> 00:26:51.702
Oh, what are you singing, what are you doing,
what are you thinking - there is no
integration/propriety in that.

00:26:53.624 --> 00:26:58.704
That is why there is a need to know the
Guru heritage of our country in depth.

00:26:59.499 --> 00:27:03.459
Now let me tell you about the Sikh people.
In London, the Sikhs staged a huge opposition.

00:27:03.459 --> 00:27:07.637
They have done it because they have
to tie those turbans on their head.

00:27:07.637 --> 00:27:12.740
Because if they are going by bike,
motorbike somewhere and they happen
to fall, their heads will crack.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.268
So one has to wear a helmet. So they said,
'It's forbidden in our religion.'
'Where is it written?' Ask them.

00:27:17.841 --> 00:27:23.491
Now the poor Englishmen have not read it. They say,
"Their religion is strange. When their heads
will break, why can't they wear a helmet?"

00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:27.399
And raised this very serious/big question to
the Parliament, to the Parliament.

00:27:27.459 --> 00:27:34.649
And one thing which has been absolutely and
completely forbidden by Mohammad Sahab and Guru Nanak,

00:27:34.649 --> 00:27:40.118
that any kind of intoxication, of any
type, alcohol, cigarette, any type
of intoxication, is prohibited.

00:27:40.118 --> 00:27:44.024
They are number one among them -
the British also have lost to them.

00:27:44.024 --> 00:27:50.945
If a Sardarji is coming from one side after
consuming alcohol and an Englishman is coming
from the other side, the Englishman will run away.

00:27:54.325 --> 00:27:59.897
'As long as,' they say, 'the Sardarjis
stay here, our Scotch whisky will
never run out.'

00:27:59.897 --> 00:28:04.583
'It's business will continue.' This is the
name we people have earned there.

00:28:04.922 --> 00:28:09.052
And they're called Nanak's special people
and they reached the Parliament that
they don't want the helmet.

00:28:09.052 --> 00:28:14.993
To this condition have they brought our
Guru Sampada[heritage], the Great Power
which God had incarnated within us.

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:18.839
We have made it such that by
creating different groups,

00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:23.414
and by making different things, and we are
saying that, 'Yes, this only is our religion.'

00:28:27.388 --> 00:28:31.728
And what can be said about the amount
of alcohol that Muslims drink!

00:28:33.439 --> 00:28:41.449
No one is more fond of alcohol than them;
not only this, they have written poetry too.

00:28:41.449 --> 00:28:47.510
Many poets, one greater than the other, are
praising this alcohol, this devil, so much.

00:28:47.785 --> 00:28:53.435
Definitely alcohol is a demon.
Demons enter fermented alcohol.

00:28:53.475 --> 00:28:58.845
It turns a man into a demon. Maybe
you people may not like this

00:28:58.893 --> 00:29:05.833
but I am telling you that alcohol
within is a man-made atom bomb.

00:29:06.234 --> 00:29:12.074
Such a stupid thing it is! I don't know
how and when this came into their minds

00:29:12.074 --> 00:29:17.300
and they started making liquor and just
now a gentleman came to tell Me that
even the gods used to drink Somras.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:26.594
So I told them that's why they had a fall.
And from where did they bring this scripture

00:29:26.594 --> 00:29:29.610
that the gods used to drink Somras. I said,
"Were you there to see it?"

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:37.315
But you don't drink. If you drink, you will
become a devil and even after seeing those
who drink, you start drinking again.

00:29:39.278 --> 00:29:45.028
There is no need to bring any prohibition
policy for this. Think about this idea
from your own mind.

00:29:45.028 --> 00:29:52.875
Think about it, how dirty it is! The biggest
thing forbidden in Guru Sampada[Heritage]
is intoxication.

00:29:53.221 --> 00:29:57.821
Every Guru, who has come into this world,
has strictly forbidden intoxication.

00:29:58.036 --> 00:30:03.426
Because this was not thought of in other
incarnations, hence, those with
Guru Sampada, did it.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:13.330
It was absolutely forbidden. And Christians
will say that why did Jesus Christ not forbid it?

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:19.479
He did, but a person named Moses of
His time has clearly written

00:30:19.479 --> 00:30:24.193
that no intoxicating substance should
be consumed because He was, He was a
person of Guru Sampada[Heritage].

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:32.439
He has clarified this, but these great
followers of Jesus Christ say,

00:30:32.439 --> 00:30:38.956
that, "We are great followers of Jesus Christ."
Nobody in the world can insult Him as
much as these people have.

00:30:38.956 --> 00:30:42.928
Because the one who has spent His whole
life in celibacy, these are His disciples -

00:30:42.928 --> 00:30:46.813
just look at their faces. You have no idea
in what pit these people are entrapped.

00:30:47.063 --> 00:30:54.553
These people call themselves disciples
of Jesus Christ. These people who
insult Him are His worst enemies.

00:30:54.553 --> 00:31:04.227
We are like this only. We are no less.
Whenever we think about religion,
it is related to Guru Sampada.

00:31:04.652 --> 00:31:12.272
One thing has been told to us that
every human being has the same
light of the Spirit within him.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.960
Therein lies the vision/sight of God
and every human being can be reborn.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.577
Then how can we say that a person
is a Brahmin by caste only.

00:31:23.657 --> 00:31:30.911
And in that they say that it is written in
the Gita. So you go and ask them this
question, 'Who wrote the Gita?'

00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:40.763
'Vyasa.' 'Whose son was Vyasa?' He was
definitely the son of sage Parashar

00:31:40.763 --> 00:31:50.809
but his mother was from some lower caste -
and that too illegitimate. Everyone knows.
He was not the son of a Brahmin.

00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:55.751
His parents were not even married
and their son born was Vyasa.

00:31:55.751 --> 00:32:01.331
Could he write that one should be a Brahmin
by birth. This is an allegation.

00:32:02.099 --> 00:32:06.579
Who was Valmiki? You all know.

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:14.486
Then chortle like this, 'A person
can be a Brahmin by birth only,'
is a very wrong thing.

00:32:16.782 --> 00:32:21.822
People have made this dirty method
of breaking all their paths.

00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:27.401
Brahmin means one who knows Brahma;
'Dwij', who has been born for the second time.

00:32:27.401 --> 00:32:30.597
He who has not been realised, cannot be a Brahmin.

00:32:30.597 --> 00:32:39.061
At our places, you can keep a Brahmin
to cook food in your house. Done -
Brahmin cooks food in the house

00:32:39.061 --> 00:32:43.221
'We are holy people, we have kept a
Brahmin in our house to cook food
in the house.'

00:32:43.221 --> 00:32:54.601
Keep a Brahmin to perform the puja. A hired
person cannot be a Brahmin. Brahmin is a
condition, a tendency,

00:32:54.601 --> 00:32:59.496
One who is searching for Brahma. You are
all Brahmins because you have come
to Me searching for Brahma.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:12.260
One who seeks Brahma is a Brahmin, one who
seeks power is a Kshatriya. Thus, all
this is based on one's disposition.

00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:19.917
But such dirty practices have been in vogue in India,
how much have we troubled our teachers[Gurus].

00:33:19.917 --> 00:33:26.014
Gyaneshwarji, because he was the son of a sanyasi -
it's what these people said - took his life.

00:33:26.073 --> 00:33:33.743
Till recently, our Sai Nath of Shirdi,
who was the incarnation of Dattatreya Himself,

00:33:34.077 --> 00:33:40.257
was persecuted because he was a Muslim.
And now when He is dead, then before Him

00:33:40.257 --> 00:33:47.024
His enemies, the very people who tortured
Him, are standing with their fat bellies
and performing aarti to Him.

00:33:47.773 --> 00:33:52.723
Created means to make money. He has been
enclosed from all sides - has been blunted.

00:33:52.723 --> 00:34:00.437
A day will come when His Spirit will leave
that place. They have made a business out of Him.

00:34:01.368 --> 00:34:06.928
They have come out to sell God.
We are selling these Gurus.

00:34:07.153 --> 00:34:10.923
When they are alive, they torture
Them and kill Them.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:16.860
Whatever, whatever can be, whatever evil and
cruel of the world, all happens with Them.

00:34:17.866 --> 00:34:22.856
And when they're no more - when we die,
then we know

00:34:22.856 --> 00:34:27.537
because we go into the collective subconscious -
about which I'm going to tell you all tomorrow morning -

00:34:27.537 --> 00:34:30.877
When we go into the collective subconscious
then we come to know,

00:34:30.877 --> 00:34:36.855
that we have done this evil deed, we have
done this cruelty, and come back and
start singing their bhajans[Hymns].

00:34:37.884 --> 00:34:45.144
And if we can get some money along with it,
is a very good thing. What is the
state of religion we have made!

00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:54.279
This religious wealth is also within us in
our Bhavsagara, therefore a person should
have correct ideas about it.

00:34:54.279 --> 00:35:04.248
The greatest correct idea should be that
religion is an innate thing inside us,
something within us.

00:35:04.382 --> 00:35:10.842
And in every major religion and its founders,
there is only one religious power.

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:19.620
It has come in different forms, at different
places and it is a continuous process.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:28.590
Just as a tree first blossoms, then its
buds come, then its leaves come,
then its fruits come,

00:35:29.725 --> 00:35:34.755
seeds come, it comes in various forms,
but the power within them is the same.

00:35:34.755 --> 00:35:39.374
Similarly in this tree of Dharma, in
the great tree, which is the same thing,

00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:45.538
several things happened at numerous times
and in diverse ways, but all are driven
by the same power within.

00:35:45.538 --> 00:35:50.391
And we have no right to divide it
or call it different

00:35:50.391 --> 00:35:56.657
and we become it's proclaimers. We say that
we are so and so and we are so and so.

00:35:57.441 --> 00:36:03.251
Adi Shankaracharya's - just see, among all the
Shankaracharyas today - except for one
Shankaracharya, all the others

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:09.999
Adishankaracharya, who had said, 'Neither
yoga nor Sankhya' this is not going to
happen through any means;

00:36:09.999 --> 00:36:16.314
Only by the Grace of the Mother can a
man transcend[Be realized]. Shankaracharya
has been tied up and thrown into the jungle.

00:36:17.211 --> 00:36:27.501
And all these people are roaming around with gold
umbrellas on their heads. You know a gold umbrella
is needed. Seen how their face looks inside?

00:36:29.977 --> 00:36:38.447
Shankaracharya means - such a big thing. What
comparison can there be between the Incarnation
of Dattatreya Himself and these Bhadotris
[Hired People] of today!

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.790
Then comes its reaction. It should be
understood that if you do not
understand this power properly -

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.821
it's reaction has come today itself that
none of our young boys are being seen here.

00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:56.437
All are wasting time in college. Nobody is
going to come here. They have nothing
to do with religion.

00:36:56.437 --> 00:37:00.927
They think, "Our parents are stupid people,
let them go, let them do what they have to do,
it doesn't matter to us."

00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:08.675
They think, 'We are very intelligent.' They
are also going in foolishness. They get away
from one thing so are going into another.

00:37:08.675 --> 00:37:14.475
But if you also want to establish religion,
there must be awakening, there must be
transcendence,

00:37:14.475 --> 00:37:18.283
but you must bring some balance in
your thoughts. Balance has to be attained.

00:37:18.283 --> 00:37:23.702
And have to think that if we carry on
with any extreme ideas, then it's not
going to be beneficial in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:23.702 --> 00:37:25.449
You have to be in the center.

00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:28.644
Any extreme person cannot benefit
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:28.644 --> 00:37:32.995
If you are very close to that person
and you don't want realisation,
then we can't do anything.

00:37:32.995 --> 00:37:38.319
There are many people who say that,
"Whether we get self-realization or not,
we are still Jan Sanghis[Some Political group],"

00:37:38.579 --> 00:37:43.832
"And we will stick to them. We will
kill wherever we find a Muslim."
So they'll remain stuck.

00:37:43.832 --> 00:37:47.529
When they'll go before God, God will
ask you, "Yes, what's the matter?"

00:37:47.529 --> 00:37:51.472
They will say, "Oh, we were Jan Sanghis and
we had a guru; we used to give him money."

00:37:51.616 --> 00:37:57.936
"Okay!" And he told us, "You do smuggling
or whatever, give the money here.
Hand me the purse."

00:37:58.287 --> 00:38:05.417
"So I used to give him money. Then I got
caught while smuggling and now I am dead,
and now I am in front of You."

00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:09.390
So God will say, "Now go to Hell."
His Guru will also be sitting there
and he will also sit there.

00:38:10.798 --> 00:38:15.218
Gurus will never say, "You don't do
this, don't do that." No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:38:15.218 --> 00:38:22.672
If he says this, then everything will
be lost for him. Only a mother can
say so, 'Son, don't do this.'

00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:30.979
'This is prohibited, it is wrong.' Why should
he say so? He is only interested in your
purse, keep your purse here and sit comfortably.

00:38:30.979 --> 00:38:35.636
'You consider me your Guru, right? Worship
me and give me your purse.' Work done.

00:38:35.945 --> 00:38:46.105
They don't think what will happen
after you die, after you meet God.

00:38:46.105 --> 00:38:49.792
They themselves have no idea what will happen to them.

00:38:49.792 --> 00:38:54.411
Are they going to carry the burden of this
money and all the things they have collected here?

00:38:58.705 --> 00:39:08.735
These people themselves will go and sit in the
most dark Hell. There's no doubt in this that
their utter destruction is also going to happen.

00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:16.321
But they will take you along with them
and drown. You yourself know that they
can't carry their bundles/burdens with them.

00:39:16.757 --> 00:39:24.157
If any person asks you for money in the name
of God, then understand beforehand that
God cannot be found here.

00:39:29.005 --> 00:39:36.965
It's another thing that suppose we have to build this
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan today - it's okay.
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has no connection with God.

00:39:36.965 --> 00:39:42.453
This building needs to be built, collect
money for it, make it, it's done. It
can have no connection with God.

00:39:43.222 --> 00:39:47.142
If someone says, 'Give for God.'
What can you give for God?

00:39:49.382 --> 00:39:58.962
What do you have? What can you give?
When everything is His, there is
nothing worth giving Him.

00:39:59.284 --> 00:40:07.044
What can we give Him except our heart,
our devotion to Him, there is nothing
else to give.

00:40:07.465 --> 00:40:11.775
And those who - just today a gentleman was
telling Me that, "Mataji, you should
charge some fee."

00:40:11.775 --> 00:40:21.439
"You don't charge a single penny, that's
why people don't value it at all."
I said, "Wow, what to say about you!"

00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:28.835
I said, "Tell Me, for how much money would
you sell your mother's love? Put a price."

00:40:30.005 --> 00:40:33.825
"Today you've said such a thing,
never say it again."

00:40:34.556 --> 00:40:39.676
No one can think of all these things because
everything we think of in terms of money.

00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:45.799
There are some in something of Balaji,
they apply some mark on their head
- putting up a bid for that.

00:40:47.939 --> 00:40:53.969
There is a bid for moving the fan.
Everything has become a share market.

00:40:54.812 --> 00:41:05.832
Are you people out to sell even your
Mother's love. Just think how very disgusting
the concepts of our religion have become.

00:41:07.168 --> 00:41:13.078
Think about it. Do we not know
anything about love at all?

00:41:13.078 --> 00:41:18.633
Did we not have mothers at all?
Have we not seen love in this world?

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:24.180
Have we become so stupid that we
cannot understand this?

00:41:27.807 --> 00:41:38.337
All these thoughts were put before us by
our Gurus and they told and taught us,
how much the poor things suffered!

00:41:41.169 --> 00:41:45.684
The chakras above that, all those
gurus are located within us.

00:41:45.684 --> 00:41:52.971
All those Gurus, all the Gurus,
reside within us and guide us.

00:41:52.971 --> 00:42:00.906
If we have gone on the wrong path - I mean,
in Sahaja Yoga I don't tell this to anyone

00:42:00.906 --> 00:42:05.101
I don't tell anyone that 'You should not
drink alcohol, you should not smoke cigarettes.'

00:42:05.104 --> 00:42:10.184
When you get realized you give up yourself.
90% of the people leave on their own.

00:42:10.187 --> 00:42:15.477
There is no habit left. The reason is that
when you start enjoying yourself,

00:42:15.477 --> 00:42:18.523
then where do you have the time
to enjoy anything else.

00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:25.702
You forget to be bored. The joy in your
heart starts becoming so intense that
you forget this thing altogether.

00:42:26.785 --> 00:42:33.365
That's why I don't tell anyone but it
happens, automatically it happens.

00:42:36.847 --> 00:42:46.867
After that you'll see that the chakra above
is called the heart chakra, in this
heart chakra Jagdamba resides.

00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:58.047
You know Jagdamba Ji is Shiva, Shri Shiv's
consort. Shri Shiv resides in the heart.
Shiva resides in everyone's heart.

00:42:58.047 --> 00:43:04.554
The spark of the Spirit is inside our hearts,
which is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:43:04.601 --> 00:43:18.821
Whether it is there or not, you see
later on. It is there. Inside this
reflective form, the Spirit form

00:43:22.475 --> 00:43:31.825
is a light, like a flame, which stays
in our heart and watches all our actions.

00:43:32.024 --> 00:43:39.664
It keeps watching us all the time, it
does not get involved anywhere, it's
just a witness, keeps watching.

00:43:40.674 --> 00:43:47.874
And the Kundalini which is kept in our
triangular bone records everything.

00:43:47.874 --> 00:43:55.332
Whatever it sees, our whatever action
the light of the Spirit knows, it watches

00:43:55.332 --> 00:44:01.496
It knows our every action - we can't hide
anything from it. It's a witness, keeps watching.

00:44:01.944 --> 00:44:09.684
Like a reporter, and all it's light
keeps falling on the Kundalini and
the Kundalini keeps knowing.

00:44:09.684 --> 00:44:19.022
There is a triangle formed from the
heart to here. Above the forehead
is the seat of Shri Sadashiva.

00:44:19.022 --> 00:44:27.155
From there, the information goes to the Kundalini
and just like a tape recorder,
the Kundalini keeps noting down everything.

00:44:27.155 --> 00:44:31.671
Many people, sometimes [when] I ask them
something, they ask with great surprise,
"Mataji, how do you know?"

00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:37.601
So I know about you from your Kundalini,
I can play the whole tape. Just
played your tape - finished/done.

00:44:37.601 --> 00:44:41.578
And whatever I want - don't even have
to pull the tape - everything is revealed.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:50.120
Everything is stored in the Kundalini
and this flame of the Spirit keeps
burning alone, lonely.

00:44:51.075 --> 00:44:56.525
When the Kundalini is awakened, when the
Kundalini rises and pierces the
Bramharandhra, then

00:44:56.525 --> 00:45:02.422
The seat of Shri Sadashiva which is here
above the head, remains forever above
you all the time.

00:45:02.422 --> 00:45:09.252
Because of this you have the wisdom to
discriminate between truth and falsehood.
Conscience exists because of this.

00:45:09.252 --> 00:45:15.095
And then when it goes there and
touches it - it's like a small light
which keeps burning in the gas -

00:45:15.095 --> 00:45:20.326
and when the force of the gas comes
and mixes with it, then the whole
thing gets lit up.

00:45:20.326 --> 00:45:26.852
In the same way, the feeling comes into
your entire consciousness, it's awareness comes.

00:45:26.852 --> 00:45:31.499
The vibrations that come to your hands
later on are the effects of that consciousness.

00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:42.226
And only after that does a man become a
witness. This happening has to take place.

00:45:42.226 --> 00:45:47.518
This is not going to happen with any lecture.
Even now when I am giving you a speech,
My vibrations are still flowing

00:45:47.518 --> 00:45:51.347
and they are coming and the happening,
whatever it is, is taking place within you.

00:45:51.347 --> 00:45:56.893
But it doesn't work out with all those
people who give speeches and read books.

00:45:57.994 --> 00:46:06.714
For this, a highly authorised person is needed
and the authorised person should be such
who is completely united with God in love.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:12.530
Authorized means he should be someone spectacular
who is sitting on the seventh floor

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:18.161
everyone should bend and touch his feet. When the guru
comes, one comes and puts his head on the guru's feet,
then the other comes, he too puts his head on the feet.

00:46:18.161 --> 00:46:22.177
Put twenty five rupees there, someone put five
hundred rupees there, and he with four feathers

00:46:22.177 --> 00:46:28.807
and two horns attached, is sitting there. No.
The one who is authorized is very simple.

00:46:28.807 --> 00:46:33.874
We believe Radhaji to be Adishakti, we believe
in Sitaji too - what speciality did Sitaji have?

00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:38.122
We believe in Mary, the Mother of Christ,
to be Adishakti - what was in Her?

00:46:38.651 --> 00:46:46.521
They were very ordinary Mothers, very
ordinary, but strong/powerful from within.

00:46:46.521 --> 00:46:50.714
People had to be Realized to know Their powers
otherwise people don't know it.

00:46:50.714 --> 00:46:57.009
In Sitaji's time, people were so sensitive,
they were quite sensitive - today such
a thing can't be seen.

00:46:57.009 --> 00:47:00.994
I had just been to Satara and I realised that
the people of that sensitivity are here.

00:47:00.994 --> 00:47:06.764
Otherwise I have never seen such anywhere else
who seemed to know exactly what the thing is.

00:47:06.883 --> 00:47:13.923
They were such sensitive people that they got
realized in no time. Their king's mother
was so sensitive that I was very surprised.

00:47:13.923 --> 00:47:18.569
I said, 'In a small place like Satara -
this might there due to the virtuous deeds
of Shivaji -

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:24.763
but people were so sensitive as if the lamps
were fully ready and thus they lit instantly.

00:47:24.763 --> 00:47:30.692
Instantly - so very beautiful! When such
people are there, this work gets done.

00:47:30.692 --> 00:47:37.679
There must be sensitivity for this thing,
that a person is sensitive. Otherwise,
I work hard and have done it.

00:47:37.962 --> 00:47:41.802
Now, among the upper Chakras, that I
have told, the Chakra of Jagdamba,

00:47:41.802 --> 00:47:46.234
You know that Jagdamba ji many times
after incarnating came to the
Bhavasagara [ocean of existence]

00:47:46.234 --> 00:47:54.482
and has protected all Her devotees; you too
are among them. Today in Kaliyuga,
you are searching for the same.

00:47:54.482 --> 00:47:59.751
You too have come from among them. Without
you having some assets, you would not have
come and would not get realization.

00:47:59.751 --> 00:48:06.248
If you know that this is your cheque
which I am encashing, it's all your deposited

00:48:06.248 --> 00:48:13.215
wealth which I'm giving; nothing is mine
I'm sitting in the center. As a mediator
is, I'm sitting in the middle.

00:48:13.215 --> 00:48:18.058
It is yours, you take it, but it's only
that I can't give you unauthorized.

00:48:18.058 --> 00:48:23.285
Will give it to whosoever is authorized and
whatever I can do, how much I can put

00:48:23.285 --> 00:48:26.045
with the power of My love, I will.

00:48:26.045 --> 00:48:29.636
It happens, has happened to many, and has
happened to thousands and should happen
to you too.

00:48:30.686 --> 00:48:38.046
Now above that, the Chakra that is on it's
side, you can say that it is the Chakra
of Shri Ram and Sita

00:48:38.046 --> 00:48:45.291
because in evolution when He incarnated
ten times, one of those incarnations
was of Shri Ram and Sita.

00:48:45.291 --> 00:48:50.996
And Shri Ram was incarnated that it
should be told to the world what
an ideal king should be like.

00:48:50.996 --> 00:48:53.679
Now I cannot tell you much about
this because time is short.

00:48:53.679 --> 00:48:58.894
And the chakra above it, which we call
Agnya Chakra, is the optic thalamus.

00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:05.469
Where the nerves of our two eyes meet,
there in the middle is a center

00:49:05.469 --> 00:49:11.308
through which both the pituitary and
pineal glands are controlled,

00:49:11.308 --> 00:49:14.476
due to which the ego and superego which
is formed in the head of a human being,

00:49:14.476 --> 00:49:23.196
is controlled and apart from this, this
chakra, in it's center, now here, look here

00:49:23.196 --> 00:49:29.847
one is this Agnya Chakra, and here in the
center is the Chakra of Shri Krishna.
This is Shri Krishna's Chakra,

00:49:29.847 --> 00:49:36.805
because this Chakra tells us that when man
raised his neck, he set his eyes towards God.

00:49:36.805 --> 00:49:43.355
As long as his neck was towards the earth, till then
his sight was not towards Virat or God Almighty.

00:49:43.355 --> 00:49:46.914
When he raised his neck, when he became
a human from an animal,

00:49:46.914 --> 00:49:50.893
when he raised his neck, then here in
the throat Shri Krishna resided.

00:49:50.893 --> 00:49:57.904
And Radhaji is the power of Shri Krishna.
You know Ra-Dha, Ra means power, and
Dha means the one who sustains.

00:49:57.904 --> 00:50:04.054
And because of this power, due to this
power only, you become a witness.

00:50:04.054 --> 00:50:11.394
Now these are very deep matters; and now I'm
just telling you the names of the Chakras
and their presiding deities.

00:50:11.394 --> 00:50:18.212
What happens beyond that, what are its subtleties,
what is its subtleness, what else is there
in it, there is a lot to tell.

00:50:18.212 --> 00:50:22.152
We have some people who have attained
mastery in this. You people should also try.

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:26.198
Nearly, if you, there are frequent programmes
here in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.

00:50:26.198 --> 00:50:30.246
You people come, know/learn and understand;
Some have written books too.

00:50:30.246 --> 00:50:34.410
I haven't written anything yet but
everyone has written something, look at it.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:42.042
Listen to my lectures and understand them
and use your hands, then you will know
whether what I'm saying is correct or not.

00:50:42.042 --> 00:50:48.365
Now the above Agnya Chakra, which I had told,
has the incarnation of MahaVishnu in it.
If you read Devi Bhagavat,

00:50:48.365 --> 00:50:56.336
then you will know that MahaVishnu
is a very big incarnation of the Son.

00:50:56.336 --> 00:51:02.286
And in that he has considered Shri Ganesha
as the main principle. Considering
Shri Ganesha as the main principle

00:51:02.286 --> 00:51:06.384
that incarnation was sent into the world,
whose name is Jesus Christ.

00:51:06.384 --> 00:51:13.154
Jesus Christ is none other but the incarnation
of Shri Mahavishnu, whom we call Bauddha.

00:51:13.154 --> 00:51:18.929
He is the incarnation of Jesus Christ
and His mother was Radhaji Herself.

00:51:18.929 --> 00:51:24.689
It's evident that the name Jesus which they
have given, this name Jesu, is from Yashoda.

00:51:24.689 --> 00:51:28.624
Yashoda's name is not mentioned anywhere
so they have named Him Jesu

00:51:28.624 --> 00:51:34.566
and His name, which is Christ, is
from none other than Krishna,
because Krishna was His father.

00:51:34.693 --> 00:51:42.453
Repeatedly He describes His Father, you
should read Devi Mahatma, in Devi Mahatma
it is completely written about This Child.

00:51:42.453 --> 00:51:46.258
There is only a difference in the name.
It says MahaVishnu and His name is Jesus Christ.

00:51:46.258 --> 00:51:49.342
If you read them, you will know exactly
that these are His descriptions only.

00:51:49.342 --> 00:51:57.956
Fully it is His description that He came into
the world and the things He did and the way
He forgave; Forgiveness was His key principle.

00:51:57.956 --> 00:52:04.534
In forgiveness, whatever weapons there were
He dissolved them and put them into forgiveness.

00:52:04.534 --> 00:52:07.700
He has given forgiveness as the
greatest weapon that man has.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:13.922
Now the reality of this too, it's feeling,
of everything, you can realize through
Kundalini awakening

00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:19.048
that when the Kundalini rises and when it
stops at any Chakra, then the name of
that Deity has to be taken.

00:52:19.048 --> 00:52:22.556
If you do not take it's name then the Kundalini
will not rise. You can see this yourself.

00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:26.760
When the Kundalini rises, gradually you will
notice that you will keep getting
vibrations on the chakras.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.699
You can also see it with your eyes.
There you will have to take the name of
that very Deity which I am saying.

00:52:30.699 --> 00:52:34.434
If you do not take the name then the Kundalini
will not rise and when the Kundalini rises

00:52:34.434 --> 00:52:37.479
you should know that the Deity there is happy.

00:52:37.479 --> 00:52:41.986
After that comes Sahasrara. Kalki is
considered to be the incarnation of Sahasrara.

00:52:41.986 --> 00:52:49.607
Kalki means, the One who is the master of all
the seven chakras, the master of all
the seven chakras is Kalki.

00:52:49.607 --> 00:52:55.485
And hence Her incarnation is believed
to be in Sahasrara and this is the
highest incarnation of Adi Shakti

00:52:55.485 --> 00:53:04.035
Because only due to this, because of Adi Shakti
only, Sahasrara can be opened here.
Otherwise it could never be opened.

00:53:04.035 --> 00:53:11.987
Along side, all the Gods reside on this
Chakra and this is the incarnation of Sahasrara.

00:53:12.767 --> 00:53:19.567
Now I have told you enough regarding this
matter. We will now meditate a little
and see what is our state.
