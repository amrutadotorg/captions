1
00:00:00,891 --> 00:00:08,932
Today we are here to celebrate Mahashivaratri.

2
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:13,093
It’s a very great privilege for all of us

3
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:16,528
to understand about

4
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:25,851
Shri Mahadeva.

5
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:37,174
Unless and until you have got your Self Realisation

6
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:41,690
you cannot understand what

7
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:52,851
is the great personality,

8
00:00:53,335 --> 00:01:07,133
the character and the powers of Shri Mahadeva.

9
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:17,174
It is not easy to conceive,

10
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,730
also to reach the depths

11
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:27,133
of his greatness,

12
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:32,053
unless and until we are humble.

13
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:39,335
We have to be very humble to reach

14
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:44,528
at the Lotus Feet of Shri Mahadeva.

15
00:01:52,690 --> 00:02:02,932
As you have seen, one has to cross even the Sahasrara

16
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:11,174
to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality.

17
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:23,335
He is beyond – beyond all our conceptions.

18
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:29,174
But he resides in our hearts as the Spirit,

19
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:37,730
and is reflected very well when you get your Realisation.

20
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:47,012
But still, one has to understand the powers of Shri Mahadeva

21
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:55,416
which is not very easy to describe about

22
00:02:55,528 --> 00:03:04,416
this great God in liuttle words.

23
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,456
But the first power he himself has,

24
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:15,012
that he is a very forgiving God.

25
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,609
He forgives!

26
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:25,770
He forgives us so many of our sins,

27
00:03:25,891 --> 00:03:31,690
so many of our destructive activities,

28
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:35,456
our horrible minds

29
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:40,456
which tries to create problems for everyone.

30
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:43,811
Up to a point!

31
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:51,770
But he has the greatest power to destroy.

32
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:57,690
His destruction comes so suddenly

33
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:03,053
because he rules all the elements.

34
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:08,730
All the elements he rules. He rules the Mother Earth,

35
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:13,891
and he rules all other elements.

36
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:17,609
Through their causal he rules,

37
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,569
and he can destroy everything that he wants to

38
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,295
if he finds there is problem.

39
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,214
I have to tell you

40
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:39,649
that earthquakes are managed by him, not by me.

41
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:43,690
I am not there for destruction.

42
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:49,811
He is the one who sees what’s happening on this earth,

43
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:53,730
what’s happening to the human beings.

44
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:58,649
I’ll give you an example of Gujurat:

45
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:05,295
apart from anything, Gujurat people are very money-oriented,

46
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,851
they are worried with the stock-exchange, this, that,

47
00:05:07,972 --> 00:05:11,932
all the time money, money, money, money, money.

48
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:18,254
Even if they are abroad, they are extremely money-oriented.

49
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,730
Sometimes I am surprised,

50
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:28,214
impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

51
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:34,932
and they like artificial type of things like some gurus or somebody.

52
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:40,375
I don’t know from where they get like this.

53
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:48,851
Whatever it is, you have a state called Bhavnagar in Gujurat.

54
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,528
Bhavnagar people came,

55
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:57,972
they brought for me those silver slippers, padukas,

56
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:04,295
to be vibrated; I was surprised, I was happy at least,

57
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,416
that these people are thinking about it.

58
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:13,416
So they did a Puja, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar

59
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:16,649
and also in Baroda.

60
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,133
These are the two places that were not touched,

61
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:26,214
even touched even by bookambh by the earthquake.

62
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:28,214
Can you imagine.

63
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:37,174
And Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered.

64
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:42,174
There are Sahaja Yogis, very few,

65
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:49,012
all of them were saved, and their houses also did not move.

66
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:55,932
This is between the protection of your Mother

67
00:06:56,053 --> 00:07:01,093
and the wrath of God Almighty.

68
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:06,295
One has to understand this very well,

69
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:12,254
that he has powers over all the elements.

70
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,528
I went to France,

71
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:20,012
and there some people in France tried to trouble Me.

72
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:23,528
And all the media got after Me.

73
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:26,456
And on the television, everywhere,

74
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:29,891
they were saying all kinds of things against me.

75
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:33,488
I knew something would go somewhere

76
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:38,295
and suddenly from the sea a big –

77
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:43,649
I don’t know what to call it – a big storm started,

78
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,649
suddenly, no-one knows why.

79
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,811
And two ships were completely sunk,

80
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:58,528
and those people who went to rescue them got cancer.

81
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:04,811
Then it came, this storm started moving fast

82
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:13,133
and all the churches lost their top – heads I should say.

83
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:20,811
All the churches lost it. So many priest’s houses were ruined

84
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:26,456
and it travelled and came up to the place where I had purchased

85
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:29,690
a very big castle.

86
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:35,416
It just stopped – and just stopped at the brink of it.

87
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,730
Now, it is not my doing, I must tell you.

88
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:43,456
But this is what he does.

89
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:49,174
Though he is very forgiving, he is extremely kind,

90
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:58,254
he’s blissful, but you should be aware of his powers.

91
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:07,851
All those powers are used to protect my work, I should say.

92
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:15,133
It goes too far and it is to show to people that

93
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:20,730
they shouldn’t obstruct the work of spirituality.

94
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:27,254
It should be real spirituality. It should not be somebody

95
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:33,972
like a false guru coming up and showing some magic,

96
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:40,488
or talking something about some far-fetched thing.

97
00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:44,851
But the real spirituality, if you have,

98
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:48,174
the protection will be always there,

99
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,730
and Shiva will be very blissful.

100
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:55,093
It’s extremely blissful.

101
00:09:55,214 --> 00:10:01,133
And what does he give you is even more beautiful

102
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:03,416
than you could think of.

103
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,053
He is extremely forgiving.

104
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:12,891
I should say he is the source of such forgiveness.

105
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:19,690
If you have forgiveness in your heart, he resides in your heart.

106
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:30,012
Otherwise, gradually, you start developing

107
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:36,295
very difficult types of diseases.

108
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:44,851
Say, if you are forgiving, your heart runs very fast.

109
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:51,649
No-one can touch your heart. You cannot get heart-attacks.

110
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:59,730
But if you are tolerating, suffering

111
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:09,730
and taking many things as a power of your own,

112
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:16,335
doing wrong things and forgetting about God,

113
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:23,609
then you also start developing a very weak heart.

114
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,851
So one side is that you develop a heart

115
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:33,851
which is extremely aggressive,

116
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:39,456
and can become like Hitler’s heart.

117
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:47,609
Under any kind of pretensions, if you start torturing someone,

118
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,335
your heart becomes solid

119
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:55,851
and then you can get a tremendous massive heart-attack,

120
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:59,012
and all the troubles from that.

121
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:04,012
This is inevitable.

122
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:09,932
But supposing you are extremely tolerant

123
00:12:10,053 --> 00:12:14,932
and you tolerate all nonsense, you are very docile,

124
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:18,295
you are a frightened person.

125
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:23,053
If you are frightened, then because of fright you do that,

126
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:28,335
you can develop another kind of a heart we call as angina

127
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,891
where the blood supply is there,

128
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:36,891
and ultimately you develop a kind of guilt and

129
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:41,972
you lead a very mediocre life.

130
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:49,093
So this second thing also is very visible

131
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:54,488
among people who think they are very, very tolerant.

132
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:59,254
I am saying that tolerance is alright,

133
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,972
because of Spirituality,

134
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:05,528
but not because you are frightened,

135
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,174
and you are afraid of something.

136
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:13,649
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have no business to be

137
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,214
afraid of anything.

138
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,254
In India people are afraid of everything!

139
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,528
If they can see a squirrel, they will be frightened.

140
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:32,851
If they see a lizard – finished!

141
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,730
I mean they are afraid of anything,

142
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:41,851
and the ladies in India are so afraid of even cockroaches!

143
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,053
This kind of temperament is absolutely stupid!

144
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:56,093
Because that makes you a kind of a person who is prone to angina.

145
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:59,093
What is there to be afraid of?

146
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,416
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini,

147
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:06,093
you are not to be afraid of anything.

148
00:14:06,214 --> 00:14:09,295
They are afraid of rats,

149
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:13,335
all kinds of nonsense and they boast of it,

150
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:15,569
and they talk about it.

151
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,093
Here the heart is becoming weak and weak and weak.

152
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:26,609
Also, I must say, the Indian men are responsible for that.

153
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,569
Because they treat their women as

154
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,214
if they are appendages or some sort of a liability,

155
00:14:34,335 --> 00:14:36,730
I don’t know what they think they are.

156
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:42,456
Their behaviour is so bad, unbelievable!

157
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:48,295
Especially in north India, I have seen, women have no position.

158
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:53,649
The woman is brought in the house, kept in the house,

159
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,214
just like a maidservant,

160
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,375
she has to cover he face all the time,

161
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:06,528
she doesn’t have to go out anywhere without permission.

162
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,609
It’s terrible!

163
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,012
Some people say it is a Muslim influence or whatever it is.

164
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:23,053
But when you believe in eternal life, in spiritual life,

165
00:15:23,174 --> 00:15:32,456
you should not be governed by any such nonsensical atrocities.

166
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:37,093
And that’s why I feel

167
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:41,649
that you really need the emancipation of women in India.

168
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:47,891
They are very good, they are very tolerant, they are very sweet,

169
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:56,456
but they develop all the bad diseases, all the mental diseases,

170
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:01,012
because they don’t know their own value,

171
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,416
they don’t know their own self-respect.

172
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:08,851
And on this I have already spoken at length.

173
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:12,254
Whey should men behave like that?

174
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:20,254
I think in our country, we have at least seventy percent are women;

175
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:27,335
and seventy percent people’s energy is wasted in the north India.

176
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:31,569
I don’t know what they think of themselves.

177
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,649
And then they are punished.

178
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,891
All such countries can never prosper,

179
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:42,932
because women are the Laxmis.

180
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:46,488
But they have to be Laxmis also,

181
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:49,569
they have to behave like Laxmis.

182
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,649
But some of them come up like this that you are shocked.

183
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:59,254
How can they be women, they look like devils?

184
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:04,133
So such an imbalance in the society

185
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:08,972
which is punished, again, by Shri Mahadeva.

186
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:14,053
He is very kind,

187
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:18,053
and he looks after the people who have to suffer it.

188
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:22,851
And he tries to punish people who make them suffer.

189
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:28,770
It is his quality to help

190
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:34,690
by destroying people who are aggressive.

191
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:38,690
He doesn’t talk of any Kundalini,

192
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:41,649
he doesn’t talk of Self Realisation,

193
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,093
he just punishes them, nicely!

194
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:49,851
In such a bad way that it’s shocking!

195
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:53,375
And he relieves sometimes people like

196
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:59,730
– I have seen many women who live like this, suffer so much.

197
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:05,214
They die much earlier than their ages.

198
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:13,528
All this one has to see in the right perspective.

199
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:18,972
He’s there to protect, of course,

200
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:22,254
but more to destroy.

201
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:28,488
He protects all kinds of animals, all birds,

202
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,254
all the nature, he protects.

203
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:40,649
He is the one who brings all the joy,

204
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,456
all the joy of spirituality.

205
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:51,891
But if you try to become aggressive,

206
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:57,730
then he is the one who will destroy.

207
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:04,214
Sometimes he gives more long rope to hang,

208
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:06,456
and so people think we are alright,

209
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:09,375
they are satisfied with themselves.

210
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:12,012
On the contrary, in the west I find,

211
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:15,690
the women are ruling the men more than the men.

212
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,891
Very surprising.

213
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:21,375
I don’t know how they have handled the situation,

214
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:24,053
but they are ruling, all the time,

215
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:27,053
and the men have to be under their thumb

216
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:29,770
– I don’t know how they have managed it –

217
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:34,295
but they do it! They are not humble.

218
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,053
They don’t love,

219
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:41,375
and they go on divorcing their husbands all the time.

220
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:44,690
They do not love!

221
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:47,295
They don’t know what is love is.

222
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:54,012
But also, I have seen men don’t understand what love is in India.

223
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,456
They don’t know how to love

224
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:01,488
their wives, which is a life-partner.

225
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:06,133
How to respect, they don’t understand.

226
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:11,254
There, then comes a great wrath,

227
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:15,891
and this wrath works in so many ways,

228
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:19,730
in creating horrible diseases

229
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:27,295
and in creating problems and problems for such men.

230
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:37,770
And the society also is responsible

231
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:45,174
for doing all kinds of things against humble people.

232
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:53,730
Both ways, one has to understand, that if you are aggressive,

233
00:20:53,851 --> 00:21:00,690
you are under the Third Eye of Shri Mahadeva.

234
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:07,012
In any way if you are aggressive, say with your servants,

235
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,972
if you are aggressive with your subordinates,

236
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:16,690
if you are aggressive with your children,

237
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:23,174
there is this wrathful God watching,

238
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:30,649
and one can get under the spell of his destruction.

239
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:38,932
But he gives us the great heights of Himalaya.

240
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:49,254
He makes human beings extremely beautiful, very noble,

241
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:55,649
and he wants that people should love each other.

242
00:21:56,295 --> 00:22:00,416
There should be pure love among human beings.

243
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:12,891
And also he makes you, very delicately,

244
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:18,690
behaving towards other people;

245
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:23,730
very sweetly behaving towards others.

246
00:22:24,295 --> 00:22:32,416
If you don’t have that, then you are going in the wrong direction.

247
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:35,214
But his greatest privilege,

248
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:40,133
that he gives you the height and the depth.

249
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:49,012
If you are worshipping him, then you develop such heights

250
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:54,295
that you see the whole world as a witness.

251
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:02,770
He sees the whole world as a sakshi-swarupa, as a witness.

252
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:09,174
And so he is the knowledge, he is the pure knowledge.

253
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:13,012
You may get your Realisation, alright;

254
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:17,214
you might feel the cool breeze in your hands, alright;

255
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:22,335
but do you have the knowledge?

256
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:27,012
I have to tell you what finger means what,

257
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:32,053
what hand means what, what is vibrations, I have to tell you.

258
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:37,851
He is that knowledge, He is the pure knowledge,

259
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:43,770
complete knowledge, of the highest level.

260
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:48,528
So he is the source of knowledge.

261
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:56,456
Those people who are not humble cannot get that knowledge.

262
00:23:57,012 --> 00:24:01,690
Those people who are arrogant

263
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:08,730
and who do not handle others delicately, sweetly, beautifully,

264
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:13,335
are not blessed by him.

265
00:24:13,456 --> 00:24:20,770
They cannot achieve anything in life.

266
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:23,133
What do we have to achieve?

267
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:30,295
Not your position, not your wealth, not all these outward things,

268
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:34,891
but you have to achieve a loving heart!

269
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:38,488
Heart with which you can love.

270
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:42,811
If there is Shiva in your heart, you will love

271
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:48,528
everyone in a very beautiful manner.

272
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:53,609
There won’t be any nonsensical ideas about love.

273
00:24:53,730 --> 00:25:05,456
Just pure love, pure love for all the people.

274
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:14,488
With the blessing, then all your harshness goes away.

275
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:19,770
For example, if you have a little power, little power,

276
00:25:22,932 --> 00:25:26,488
so you start to misuse it.

277
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:35,093
Look at Shiva, he has so many powers; if he starts misusing,

278
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:39,770
there won’t be even a blade of grass left on this earth.

279
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:46,730
How much you are sinful, selfish, you know that.

280
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:50,456
But still he gives you a chance

281
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:53,335
‘So let’s see, they might improve’.

282
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:58,488
And he is extremely generous, extremely generous,

283
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:04,770
he is very forgiving and also extremely generous.

284
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:14,569
Now supposing there are people who are living in a desert

285
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:19,254
and they are very good people,

286
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:24,214
and they are suffering because they are living in a desert,

287
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:29,690
he will create oasis for them, he controls the Mother Earth.

288
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:33,770
He can do everything to make them happy,

289
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:39,770
if they are spiritual, if they worship.

290
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:44,053
But human beings are so stupid

291
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:49,528
that they go on fighting also in the name of God.

292
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:56,891
Like in the south we have two types of people,

293
00:26:57,012 --> 00:27:00,569
one who worships Shiva, another who worships Vishnu.

294
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,254
Can you imagine!

295
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:06,254
Vishnu used to worship Shiva!

296
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:11,093
Nobody’s higher, nobody’s lower. It’s so important.

297
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,770
Everything is so important.

298
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:19,133
But they used to fight on this point, if they are worshipping Shiva,

299
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:22,214
or they are worshipping Vishnu,

300
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:25,528
and nowhere near the reality they were.

301
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:28,770
They didn’t know what was the reality, nothing,

302
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:32,254
just fighting, fighting, fighting.

303
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:38,456
In the name of God, those who fight, Shiva comes on them

304
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:41,932
and with his trident hits them.

305
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:44,730
You are not to fight in the name of God,

306
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:47,972
but you have to love and understand.

307
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:51,932
So this fighting in the name of God is a nonsense.

308
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:55,375
Not only that but it’s very, very dangerous.

309
00:27:55,488 --> 00:28:00,214
All such people who do that will be destroyed.

310
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:06,456
It is self-destructive. Such people will be destroyed completely.

311
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:13,690
So, you should understand that in the name of God you have to love.

312
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:15,972
You have to understand.

313
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:19,214
You need not tolerate nonsenses, it’s different;

314
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:25,456
but you have to love people, spread you love.

315
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:30,932
Gradually this love can go all over, all over the world,

316
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:37,133
and then the vision of mine I can see working out.

317
00:28:37,254 --> 00:28:41,053
But if there is fighting, there’s hatred,

318
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:43,690
there’s all kinds of aggressiveness,

319
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:48,416
these are all against Shiva, and such people will be destroyed.

320
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:50,932
What will I do with them?

321
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:54,295
What can I do if they are destroyed?

322
00:28:54,416 --> 00:29:00,133
If they are very money oriented, materialistic people,

323
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:04,214
they are not loving them, they are loving only for money.

324
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:08,335
All such people will be destroyed, no doubt.

325
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:15,375
One should be not only humble, but should be extremely loving.

326
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:22,375
To get the blessings of Shiva you have to be extremely loving.

327
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:30,133
Such people may not be very cunning, clever,

328
00:29:30,254 --> 00:29:34,456
maybe very innocent – they must be.

329
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:39,730
Because when you love somebody, you want to help that person.

330
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:41,811
I have suffered myself,

331
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:46,375
I have tried to help people and they have deceived me.

332
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:49,335
So what? That’s their nature,

333
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:52,012
and they are destroyed, what can I do?

334
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:57,133
I didn’t ask them that you deceive me, but they deceived me

335
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,375
– I don’t know why.

336
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:03,730
And I have been very kind and nice, and still they deceived me.

337
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:10,375
So when the destruction follows, what can I do about it?

338
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:13,569
I don’t want anybody to be destroyed,

339
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,375
I love this creation of mine,

340
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:18,254
and I don’t have

341
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:24,730
any way of protecting them if they are destructive.

342
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:32,053
Because there is another great power who can destroy them.

343
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:39,093
See then, I am absolutely in a helpless condition, sometimes I feel

344
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,770
and I don’t know how to express,

345
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:45,254
but one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis

346
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:52,012
that with Shiva’s love and his blessings

347
00:30:52,133 --> 00:31:01,174
you can become extremely loving, extremely generous,

348
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:09,528
very, very sweet and innocent like children.

349
00:31:10,254 --> 00:31:13,488
You have to be innocent.

350
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:17,375
There is no need to be very clever and cunning

351
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:26,174
and you will be amazed how your innocence will be protected.

352
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:31,012
If you are innocent, you don’t have to worry,

353
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:40,891
there’s a power, the Third Eye of Shiva looking after you.

354
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:44,335
Wherever you are going, he is with you.

355
00:31:44,456 --> 00:31:47,891
That doesn’t mean that you become stupid.

356
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:54,053
It doesn’t mean that you are not practical.

357
00:31:54,174 --> 00:31:58,972
All that is taken over, all the practical side,

358
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:01,730
by the power of Shiva.

359
00:32:01,851 --> 00:32:08,569
His guidance, his love, his kindness,

360
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,851
you can see at every, every step of life.

361
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,770
But first of all, watch your steps!

362
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:20,456
Are you aggressive? Are you troublesome?

363
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:25,811
Do you say harsh things to others?

364
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:30,972
Or are you humble? Are you gentle?

365
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:36,569
And if you are kind, he is very much pleased.

366
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:43,053
In the nature, it is His rule that works.

367
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,569
And they (animals) are so systematic,

368
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:54,609
they live with understanding of each other.

369
00:32:54,730 --> 00:33:11,053
For example, if you go in the jungle and it is absolutely quiet,

370
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:15,012
and you don’t even hear the birds twittering:

371
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:19,254
then you should know there is a tiger sitting some way.

372
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:23,932
Because he is the king. They know they have to obey,

373
00:33:24,053 --> 00:33:28,093
and when the king is there, his protocol is there.

374
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,254
They know automatically what is the protocol of the king.

375
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:35,972
Nobody would be even moving if he is there.

376
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:38,851
He sits in his majesty.

377
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:44,335
Then in one week, or maybe fifteen days he will kill one animal.

378
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,254
He has to eat.

379
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:55,214
He kills one animal then he and his family, they eat first.

380
00:33:55,295 --> 00:33:59,891
He waits for some time, of course, for the blood to ooze out,

381
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:03,569
then the whole family comes and eats.

382
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,972
Then he leaves the body there.

383
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:13,730
Then by gradation, one by one, all kinds of animals come

384
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,932
and eat it as a prasad.

385
00:34:17,053 --> 00:34:25,972
And the last thing are the crows who come and eat that animal.

386
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:31,375
Such discipline, such understanding of the protocol;

387
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:38,488
I am amazed how animals are managed by Shiva.

388
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:45,254
You never hear that animals are having a ‘strike’,

389
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:52,528
or animals are having a big ‘underworld’ animals!

390
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:59,811
You don’t hear that these animals are stealing things.

391
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:05,649
And just imagine, we are coming from that animal life,

392
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,609
but we are worse than them.

393
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:13,932
How are we going to rise if we have all such funny ideas

394
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:19,528
of behaving in such a manner of fighting.

395
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:23,456
On any small little excuse they will fight,

396
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:25,851
they will start fighting.

397
00:35:25,972 --> 00:35:29,214
Animals also fight a little bit among themselves,

398
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,012
but not in a collective way.

399
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:36,012
They don’t do it in a collective way as we do it here.

400
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:43,214
It is really at the slightest provocation

401
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:47,295
we get into groups and start fighting.

402
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:51,416
They get into groups but they don’t fight.

403
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:53,569
What is the thing among them?

404
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,174
Everything is so much, so much understood by animals,

405
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:07,295
why not for us also to understand the law of nature?

406
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,456
It is Mahadeva

407
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:17,053
who manages that all the nature’s law are to be obeyed.

408
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:21,609
Even the Mother Earth, the sky, everything,

409
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,335
is looked after by him.

410
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:29,012
He does nice, nice, beautiful things for us.

411
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:31,932
With the changing of the seasons,

412
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:36,690
he creates these beautiful flowers;

413
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:41,972
he creates all that is soothing and joy-giving and beautiful,

414
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:43,851
he looks after.

415
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:49,174
He gives us to see what nature has given us,

416
00:36:49,295 --> 00:36:56,254
and tries to please us, keep us happy, entertain,

417
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,053
like an innocent child.

418
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:02,811
But while we are, in our arrogance,

419
00:37:02,932 --> 00:37:07,012
we have our reactions – to everything!

420
00:37:07,295 --> 00:37:11,133
You see a carpet, you will say “I don’t like it!”

421
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:14,012
Especially in the west, it is a common

422
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,932
thing to say “I don’t like it”.

423
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:20,891
Who are you not to like something, or to dislike something?

424
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:23,456
What do you think of yourself?

425
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:26,972
It’s very common, and shamelessly they will say

426
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:33,174
“I don’t like this, I like it …” It’s impossible!

427
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:36,690
Such human beings, I don’t know where they will go,

428
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:38,690
what will happen to them.

429
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:44,811
Instead of appreciating, instead of enjoying everything,

430
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:49,972
why to start criticizing and reacting.

431
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:52,811
Reaction is much more in the west, I must say,

432
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:54,770
not so much in India.

433
00:37:54,891 --> 00:38:01,093
But there are certain cultural differences, I think,

434
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:03,416
that’s why people say like that.

435
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:05,528
Here if somebody says like that,

436
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:08,012
people will think that person is mad or that

437
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:11,012
something is wrong with him, the way he talks.

438
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:16,528
It is important how you express your love,

439
00:38:16,649 --> 00:38:20,488
how you talk about your love.

440
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:23,972
Start it with your wife, to begin with,

441
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:28,811
and then you can move towards your children and other people.

442
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,053
And we are so stupid sometimes,

443
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:35,214
that we love the whole world but we can’t love our wives!

444
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:39,254
It’s a specialty! In India that’s very true,

445
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:43,053
but also in the west I have seen people love their wives

446
00:38:43,174 --> 00:38:48,133
because of fear – fear of divorce maybe, I don’t know –.

447
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:58,214
Love should have no fear. It should be just ‘free’ love.

448
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:07,609
Without any fear, without any aggression, enjoy that pure love.

449
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:14,214
And that is what is missing in the human beings today as it is.

450
00:39:14,335 --> 00:39:19,174
When the day will come when human beings will

451
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:24,851
be understanding the beauty of love,

452
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:33,891
then from the heavens there will be flowers falling on us,

453
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:40,416
it would be such a tremendous day when

454
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:50,416
Mahadeva will be able to close his Third Eye

455
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,770
and would be peaceful in his heart.

456
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,093
It is my vision.

457
00:39:57,214 --> 00:40:01,214
It’s the future for you;

458
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:07,932
to see how peacefully you can talk to people,

459
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:14,133
how sweetly you can love others,

460
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:18,416
how much you can give to others.

461
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:24,649
For example, they have to give something,

462
00:40:24,891 --> 00:40:28,770
they’ll go in the market and buy the cheapest,

463
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:33,093
the rottenest thing for giving.

464
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:36,528
That’s not the way.

465
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:43,053
You must buy small or big, whatever it is, out of love!

466
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,053
That (thing) should talk about your love,

467
00:40:46,174 --> 00:40:48,488
tell about your love,

468
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:52,569
and not about your money and what you have spent.

469
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,730
It’s very common nowadays, even in India,

470
00:40:56,851 --> 00:41:03,174
that people try to show how much they are worth,

471
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:07,214
what they wear, how they dress up.

472
00:41:07,335 --> 00:41:16,456
For what? For what? I’ve known such people, very many,

473
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:19,932
and when they die there are not even four people available

474
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:23,053
to carry their dead bodies!

475
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:26,811
When they lived they think no end of themselves.

476
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:33,528
That time, you should see how many people there are

477
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:39,133
to love that person, to care for that person.

478
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:44,416
Maybe it is the upbringing,

479
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:47,295
maybe, that he had never known love,

480
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,416
anything you may blame.

481
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:53,851
But for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to learn

482
00:41:53,972 --> 00:42:02,012
that love is your life, love is spirituality, and love

483
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:07,174
– without expectations – to do something.

484
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:11,053
Some people are, I know, very good at helping

485
00:42:11,174 --> 00:42:13,649
poor people, this, that.

486
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:19,730
But behind that is the power that …

487
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:25,214
They think “Oh, we are great, we are doing this work, that work”

488
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:29,770
just to satisfy their power, not their love.

489
00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:33,174
So when you are working,

490
00:42:33,295 --> 00:42:38,569
you have to know that it’s just to satisfy your Spirit,

491
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,649
just to satisfy your love that you are doing it,

492
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:50,295
not for any name or for any kind of a position.

493
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:58,851
If you have that kind of a detached love,

494
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:05,488
virakta as they call it, then nobody has to certify you.

495
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:11,649
You have it, and you are enjoying it!

496
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:19,770
It is unfortunate I have to speak in English language,

497
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:24,093
and maybe there are some who do not understand English,

498
00:43:24,214 --> 00:43:29,214
but nowadays English has become dominating, what to do?

499
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:32,851
You have to suppose people will read  English language.

500
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:36,730
I can’t use any other language.

501
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:43,416
But one has to speak the language of love.

502
00:43:43,528 --> 00:43:49,214
You see animals, you see if you have a horse

503
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,133
and if you have a dog,

504
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:57,972
all these animals, they understand your love;

505
00:43:58,456 --> 00:44:04,811
how they stick to you, how they express their love,

506
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:07,456
they are very sweet.

507
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:13,569
And this we have to learn from them now, I think.

508
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:18,295
Otherwise I don’t know how to make them understand

509
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,133
the value of love.

510
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:30,456
It is not that the way people are criticising:

511
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:36,012
that we are not practical, that we have not

512
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:44,770
achieved much money or power or something, that’s not important.

513
00:44:45,295 --> 00:44:50,569
Because there are many like that selling in the market.

514
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:59,254
But we are different. We are the jewels of humanity,

515
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:02,528
and we have to be like that, shining,

516
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:07,730
cutting out all the wrong things within us

517
00:45:07,851 --> 00:45:15,093
as a diamond is cut to look something very, very great.

518
00:45:15,932 --> 00:45:23,649
My only, if I have any desire, is that:

519
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:31,609
‘Try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva’.

520
00:45:32,254 --> 00:45:42,416
How great he is, how detached he is, detached, absolutely detached.

521
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:49,730
He lives with bones and things like that.

522
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:54,214
He is not bothered about where he is, what he lives with,

523
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,488
what he has, nothing.

524
00:45:57,972 --> 00:46:02,811
So detached, and we should be detached like that.

525
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:08,012
At the same time, we should be very loving like him,

526
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:11,488
extremely loving.

527
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:16,174
How his heart is full of love for others,

528
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:19,174
how he looks after others.

529
00:46:19,295 --> 00:46:25,851
I am warning you, because I know you all love me very much,

530
00:46:25,972 --> 00:46:29,254
but you should also love each other,

531
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,375
you should have a loving heart,

532
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:37,851
and have satisfaction in loving others.

533
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:42,932
If you could develop that, your height will grow,

534
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:48,012
your depth in Sahaja Yoga will grow.

535
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:53,456
It’s alright, the Goddess gives you the shraddha, alright,

536
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:57,770
but the depth in shraddha,

537
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:03,609
in Sanskrit, or in Hindi and Marathi I don’t know,

538
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,932
but in Marathi they call it dyas.

539
00:47:08,053 --> 00:47:14,569
Just deep in to that love, drenched in to that love,

540
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,811
enjoying that love – then you don’t want anything.

541
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:22,528
What do you want? You’ve got everything.

542
00:47:22,649 --> 00:47:25,133
So what do you want now?

543
00:47:25,254 --> 00:47:33,770
Just like the greatness of Shri Mahadeva.

544
00:47:33,891 --> 00:47:39,609
He’s so great that he’s detached.

545
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,528
What does he want? I mean nothing is greater than him,

546
00:47:43,649 --> 00:47:47,932
nothing is more important than him. Then what does he want?

547
00:47:48,053 --> 00:47:53,770
He doesn’t want anything. That’s why he’s detached.

548
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:59,375
This detachment you have to develop.

549
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:05,609
But at the same time he is the Lord of all the arts,

550
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:10,012
of the music, of the rhythm.

551
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:14,528
The other day you saw these boys were playing the rhythm.

552
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:18,254
The whole rhythm of everything he gives.

553
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:26,851
The rhythmic life that we have, we are not yet aware of it.

554
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:36,609
See a child is born exactly after nine months and so-many days.

555
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,770
Who keeps this rhythm?

556
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:45,690
Then we get, say, certain flowers at such-and-such time,

557
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:52,174
then we get in the nature all kinds of seasons.

558
00:48:52,295 --> 00:48:54,569
Who keeps the rhythm?

559
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:59,649
He is the one who is nothing but rhythm!

560
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,416
And that rhythm is kept up, in the nature,

561
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:07,770
in everything there is a rhythm.

562
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:14,851
And a rhythmic person is the one who has a very large heart!

563
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:18,609
It’s like an ocean.

564
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:23,932
You get just that rhythm disturbed immediately if you

565
00:49:24,053 --> 00:49:29,416
find somebody who is being very cruel, very bad and all that.

566
00:49:29,528 --> 00:49:38,053
But in a smooth, beautiful, peaceful lake,

567
00:49:38,174 --> 00:49:42,811
there is no ripple at all, it is just love.

568
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:46,093
And then at that time, if the rhythm,

569
00:49:46,214 --> 00:49:51,335
the silent rhythm of that heart is broken,

570
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:54,569
then Shiva takes charge.

571
00:49:54,690 --> 00:50:02,053
So one has to have a complete sense of the rhythm of time,

572
00:50:02,174 --> 00:50:07,416
rhythm of nature, rhythm of everything.

573
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:10,891
People don’t know even the names of the flowers.

574
00:50:11,012 --> 00:50:14,093
They don’t know what these flowers are,

575
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:17,053
what time they come up;

576
00:50:17,174 --> 00:50:23,972
they have no idea what is the rhythm of their ‘living’

577
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:26,053
– nobody’s bothered.

578
00:50:26,174 --> 00:50:31,295
All over, if you see, there is seasons and things.

579
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:37,811
So all the rhythm, like his play, with tabla or pakwaj

580
00:50:37,932 --> 00:50:45,811
on which he played all the beautiful tunes of all the seasons.

581
00:50:45,932 --> 00:50:49,730
And that’s how the nature flourishes

582
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:54,609
and comes up and then subsides.

583
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:57,690
We do not see that point.

584
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,770
We are just bothered about ourselves.

585
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:04,214
Like I’ll ask “How are you?”

586
00:51:04,335 --> 00:51:07,891
“Mother, I’ve got a headache, I’ve got a stomach trouble,

587
00:51:08,012 --> 00:51:12,528
I have another trouble” … or everything is there.

588
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:18,012
But another one would say “Ah, I’m alright!”

589
00:51:18,133 --> 00:51:19,770
“So, what’s the matter?”

590
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:22,093
“Put the world right Mamma!

591
00:51:22,214 --> 00:51:24,609
Mother, why don’t you put the world right?”

592
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:30,488
He’s worried about others, not about himself.

593
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:36,609
And in that understanding of what one should do

594
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,335
to make this world happy, beautiful,

595
00:51:40,456 --> 00:51:45,214
for that one has to really work hard, so called,

596
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:49,375
and in that working one thinks,

597
00:51:49,528 --> 00:51:55,569
“Isn’t it our duty to make this world beautiful?

598
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,053
Isn’t it our job to make

599
00:51:59,174 --> 00:52:04,295
this world rhythmic, rhyming with the Spirit?”

600
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,456
It’s our duty. We have to do it!

601
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:14,053
Not only taking Sahaja Yoga for yourself, but for others.

602
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:17,649
It’s not you are all the time worried about yourself,

603
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:21,375
but you are worried about others,

604
00:52:21,528 --> 00:52:25,375
what’s happening in the world.

605
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:31,416
That is love! That love is spontaneous,

606
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:35,932
and when it works, it works wonders.

607
00:52:41,012 --> 00:52:45,932
So this is a beautiful evening,

608
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:58,295
where we are worshipping such a great source of our ascent.

609
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:03,811
And I hope you people will understand

610
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:08,488
how far you are with that force,

611
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:13,690
how much are you drenched in that force,

612
00:53:13,811 --> 00:53:20,335
in that rhythm of Shiva,

613
00:53:20,456 --> 00:53:25,811
who, in his rhythmic way, gives you vibrations.

614
00:53:25,932 --> 00:53:30,609
Vibrations flow in the way we live,

615
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:36,488
and that way should engulf you completely;

616
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:41,254
and you should be asked in that your ‘I-ness’

617
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:43,843
should be dissolved in that which is I bless you.

618
00:53:43,868 --> 00:53:45,384
Thank you.
