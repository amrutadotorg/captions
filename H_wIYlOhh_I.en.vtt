00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.080
For a saint, it’s said in Sanskrit,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.400
“Udara charitanam vasudhaiva kutumbakam,”

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.400
for a person who is of a generous nature,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.080
means a person who is a saint,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.120
the whole world is his own family.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.240
Are you still only worried about your own family?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.999
Then you are not yet aware of your saintliness.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.000
And a saint doesn’t only worry about his own wife,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.800
about his own child, about his own house,

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.680
he worries about the whole world.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.200
Now, as sahaja yogi, you are a powerful entity.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.680
You are very powerful people.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.280
We have got problems in the whole world. You know that very well.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.999
It’s not necessary you have to be great intellectuals,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.560
or you have to be people who are

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.280
some sort of politicians, or something.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.680
But you must be on the lookout for the problems

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.480
which are troubling this world. You have to be.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.080
You cannot live in your own world, that you are a saint,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.320
“Now I am in Niranand!” that’s not possible.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.040
You can’t just be in Niranand.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.999
You have to know that you have to live in this world,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.999
and you have to know all the problems of this world.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.720
And you have to think about them,

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.480
not only your problems that, “Mother

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.999
how will I be able to do this and how will I be able to do that?”

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.720
But you have to worry about the whole world.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.040
You have to think, what’s happening in the world, what are the problems of the world.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.999
You are responsible for that.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.280
Not only that, but you have to pray.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.999
In your prayers you have to say, “Mother solve this problem.”

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.040
Collectively, individually, you have to take your attention

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.040
from yourself, from your smaller life,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.840
to a much wider thing – then you are a saint.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:20.800
And you have to think that it is your duty to ask for Divine help,

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.800
that all these problems should be solved.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.400
This is your job for which you are selected.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.800
Your asking is going to work out

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.000
because as you know, I am desire-less.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.400
You have to desire for it. Whatever you desire will work out.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.080
The protection, the affection, the compassion

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.280
of Mother is with you.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.000
But you have to look after this world

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.920
and show the concern that you have,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
not to live with a very limited areas,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.680
and with a very limited ways.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.720
Like now the British think, British are here, all right.

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.800
“UK problems are our problems.” No

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.999
Your problems extend to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
all the places wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.240
And you have to worry about all of them.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.999
Now we are having, say, problems in Australia.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.920
And there’s somebody who is very troublesome.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.999
So, you have to see to it that

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.560
you beat that person with shoes and put that right.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.400
Your leader has to tell whom to beat with the shoes.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.280
And work it out, whether it is in Australia,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.560
whether it is in America, whether it is in India,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800
anywhere you see that there’s a problem on Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:46.400
there’s an assault on Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.480
all of you should put your attention to it and work it out.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.999
Then there are general problems as you see.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.560
You see, we see that America is now becoming idiotic,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.480
or whatever you may say,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.200
so you have to put your attention to America.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.000
You have to stretch your attention outside,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.680
not inside

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.560
just worried about yourself, about your family,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.080
about your house, about your children.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.200
As soon as you spread your attention outside,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.000
your problems are solved in the house,

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.480
in the smaller circle they are solved.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.680
You have to pay attention outside!

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.720
Now these days there are televisions,

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:35.560
where, first, we had said, “Don’t see any televisions!“,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.080
because there was no use seeing television by sahaja yogis.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.040
When they saw the television they only got caught up.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.280
But now there are important things that are happening

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.280
which you can see for yourself. You can scan it out,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.280
what are the world problems, and you can see for yourself

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.680
where you have to put your attention.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.200
You should become aware of your personality,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.920
it’s not a personality that can be

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.999
completely involved into a very small area.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.920
Your personality, is such [that it] should get involved

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.720
into all the problems of the universe,

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:16.999
all the problems there are.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.680
And you’ll be amazed that everything can work out

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.480
in a very collective way.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.360
And at this stage, when you are, you can see for yourself now,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.080
all the sahaja yogis have got vibrations on top of their heads.
