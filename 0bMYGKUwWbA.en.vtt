00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:09.220
So, Navaratri is a big preparation.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.071
We have to know that

00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:14.937
the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga has to come into us,

00:00:15.017 --> 00:00:20.256
otherwise, why will people ask- think that you are saints?

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:23.014
Nobody’s going to believe it

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:24.969
that you are saints,

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:28.040
in your behaviour, in your knowledge,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.509
in your dealing with others.

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.220
In everything a Sahaja Yogi should be something outstanding.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.389
When I said,

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.023
“You have become, you all have to become your own masters”.

00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:42.165
Then they use it the other way round.

00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:47.941
They tell the leader: “Now we have become our own masters”.
It’s not the way.

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:50.662
So, the first thing is wisdom,

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:53.802
wisdom to understand that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:55.693
Assume the power.

00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:58.794
Sometimes I feel as if a

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:01.937
beggar is made a king supposing;

00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:05.309
still he doesn’t assume his position.

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:09.209
Anybody coming he says, “Can you give me one penny?”

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.889
Though he’s a king.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.490
Something like that.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.123
Now you have to become the leaders of the world,

00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:20.959
all over the world

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.420
and this is something to be assumed

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.000
and felt. It’s not ego, it’s a reality.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.631
Because once you know that it is the reality

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:33.694
you immediately change yourself.

00:01:33.774 --> 00:01:37.679
Immediately you will think that, “Now, what are we doing?

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.390
How much do we know?

00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:46.609
We are the leaders, the responsibility’s ours”.

00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:52.562
If that is understood, you’ll be surprised that

00:01:53.953 --> 00:01:58.773
nothing is needed to work out your cleansing.

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:02.350
Just automatically it will work,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.265
that’s My blessing to you. Accept it.

00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:09.160
But you must

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.607
feel that, “I have to be all right”, you have to feel it.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.285
The situation becomes helpless for Me sometimes,

00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:20.414
if I tell something to somebody they’ll start crying

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:22.734
or they’ll run away from Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:24.085
So, what am I to do?

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:27.092
Should I leave you at the same stage as it is?

00:02:27.172 --> 00:02:29.553
Now, to save you from evil

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:31.725
is not the same as to fight

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:34.550
Mahishasura or Narakasura, not that way.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.201
Because Narakasura is also gone into your head

00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.824
and Mahishasura is also gone into your head.

00:02:40.904 --> 00:02:44.037
So, the only thing one has to do is to understand,

00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:48.503
“There is this one in me, I ask that to get out”.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.476
Once you work it out that way,

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:54.580
you are doing Navaratri itself.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.861
You have got powers,

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:59.393
you have the knowledge, you know you can feel it.

00:02:59.473 --> 00:03:03.558
Just take out all these conditionings:
we are something different.

00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:08.707
You are not ordinary people.

00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:15.230
You are something very special.

00:03:16.312 --> 00:03:19.357
And why should we, at all,

00:03:19.437 --> 00:03:20.701
behave like others

00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:24.646
or like the way others behave? You’re not like others.

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:28.217
And what a big thing you have,
what a big knowledge you have!

00:03:28.297 --> 00:03:31.123
Look at Christ, He was alone.

00:03:31.203 --> 00:03:34.724
He talked about what he wanted
to say to multitudes, he talked.

00:03:34.804 --> 00:03:41.068
He was crucified, still, He talked.
Till the end.

00:03:41.148 --> 00:03:45.121
But He was knowledgeable

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:50.720
and you might say that Mother
he was an incarnation, all right.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.471
But in no way you are less now: you know
how to raise the Kundalini, you know everything.

00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:58.151
You are my children.

00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:04.240
So, I would suggest that to develop wisdom,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.579
you must meditate and be in the centre,

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.846
so all these things will go away:
just be away from this nonsense.

00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:17.577
In what atmosphere we live, what we do, it’s not important.

00:04:20.288 --> 00:04:25.349
We have to know that we are something exceptional.

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:29.928
All the Ganas, all the angels are just waiting.
