WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:09.809
Every time I face the new people, I have to
give an introductory talk and Sahaj Yogis

00:09.809 --> 00:17.470
get sometimes impatient about it.

00:17.470 --> 00:27.990
But we have to understand that this is the
knowledge of the Divine

00:27.990 --> 00:34.150
and those who have not known about it are
to be told.

00:34.150 --> 00:38.250
And those who have known should know that
there are many things they have not known,

00:38.250 --> 00:40.179
which they have to know.

00:40.179 --> 00:48.690
Still there is a lot to be known.

00:48.690 --> 00:57.600
Supposing I tell you all about it and you
do not get your Realisation, you do not get

00:57.600 --> 01:06.860
your yoga, you do not get your connection
with the Divine then it is useless.

01:06.860 --> 01:10.320
Talk will remain talk.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.120
You may verify it; you may find it the same
written in many scriptures.

01:13.120 --> 01:19.620
Many saints have told you the same thing [but]
it has no use.

01:19.620 --> 01:32.700
The knowledge, gyana, is useless without yoga,
without the union with the Divine.

01:32.700 --> 01:39.600
When you get the yoga, also, when you are
realised, you get your Realisation, and I

01:39.600 --> 01:44.600
do not give you the knowledge, then your Realisation
is also useless.

01:44.600 --> 01:50.870
I have seen in this great country many realised-souls
are born.

01:50.870 --> 01:57.830
They live as realised-souls, they don’t
know what are they; they act as spiritualists,

01:57.830 --> 01:59.450
they call themselves, whatever people call
them.

01:59.450 --> 02:05.090
But they are not aware that they are realised-souls!

02:05.090 --> 02:20.769
They commit mistakes, they go onto wrong paths,
get confused about their Realisation.

02:20.769 --> 02:33.739
So, it is necessary also to know what have
they got, what does it mean, how to use it,

02:33.739 --> 02:44.680
how to go ahead with it and how to develop.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.159
Many people who have been here in this hall
have got Realisation.

02:48.159 --> 02:55.600
Once they get Realisation, they feel so satisfied
about it that they just don’t come next

02:55.600 --> 02:57.849
time.

02:57.849 --> 03:01.680
And sometimes, after a year or two years they
appear saying that, “Mother, we are again

03:01.680 --> 03:02.680
lost."

03:02.680 --> 03:17.300
So, to get Realisation is the most important
thing, absolutely important because if you

03:17.300 --> 03:20.480
do not start your car, you do not move.

03:20.480 --> 03:25.430
You [may] go on describing everything that,
“Now here we are on Leicester Square.

03:25.430 --> 03:26.819
Now we are here!”

03:26.819 --> 03:30.670
But you are not there, you’re just talking.

03:30.670 --> 03:38.719
The car has to move first, has to start and
when the car has started then you must also

03:38.719 --> 03:42.749
know the roads, how to go.

03:42.749 --> 03:47.459
Then the car starts and bumps into something,
then you feel that, “What has happened?

03:47.459 --> 03:48.639
Our car has started!”

03:48.639 --> 03:57.280
So, these are two things: one is the yoga
– is the Realisation, through awakening

03:57.280 --> 04:07.840
of your Kundalini and the other is the gyana
(knowledge), which is the part which gives

04:07.840 --> 04:14.599
you complete knowledge and mastery over your
powers.

04:14.599 --> 04:22.860
For example, you go to a house and the lady
gives you the keys, “All right this is your

04:22.860 --> 04:23.860
house.

04:23.860 --> 04:25.199
You use it as you like it."

04:25.199 --> 04:28.930
Say, I come to England and somebody gives
me the keys.

04:28.930 --> 04:33.259
I don’t know how to use a washing machine!

04:33.259 --> 04:35.960
And I don’t know how to use the oven!

04:35.960 --> 04:42.860
Though she has given me the keys, I have entered
into it, I should know how to use it.

04:42.860 --> 04:52.490
I should know also what are the don’ts and
what are the dos.

04:52.490 --> 04:59.340
Before entering into the house, what’s the
use of knowing, also?

04:59.340 --> 05:05.500
Of course, it may help you, if you have a
little knowledge about it.

05:05.500 --> 05:11.870
But you cannot practise anything because you
have not entered inside it.

05:11.870 --> 05:16.919
The machinery is not before you, you are not
facing it.

05:16.919 --> 05:29.190
So, in Sahaj Yoga one has to first get into
[the] Self-realised state and then should

05:29.190 --> 05:41.600
know thoroughly how to use that state, or
how to be in that state, how to manifest it,

05:41.600 --> 05:46.350
improve it and stabilise it.

05:46.350 --> 05:52.379
For this you cannot go into courses – that
is for definite.

05:52.379 --> 05:55.409
“Should we do fourteen courses outside?”

05:55.409 --> 05:56.860
Has nothing to do with Sahaj Yoga.

05:56.860 --> 06:04.129
You have to get the keys.

06:04.129 --> 06:11.199
Secondly, you cannot pay any money for it,
you cannot purchase it.

06:11.199 --> 06:21.879
It is very difficult for human beings to understand
this part: that you cannot pay for it.

06:21.879 --> 06:28.620
That is one place where you cannot pay and
purchase.

06:28.620 --> 06:36.740
It is not that you are going to judge the
Sahaj Yoga, but Sahaj Yoga is going to judge

06:36.740 --> 06:37.740
you.

06:37.740 --> 06:40.830
It’s just the other way around.

06:40.830 --> 06:48.300
It is not that you are going to purchase Sahaj
Yoga, but Sahaj Yoga has to purchase you and

06:48.300 --> 06:52.039
has to accept you.

06:52.039 --> 06:59.289
It is very easy to do any other nonsense:
just you pay the money and you are there enrolled,

06:59.289 --> 07:00.289
permanently.

07:00.289 --> 07:04.880
You become the member of any group, very easy.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.879
And you can club together and be satisfied,
“Oh, we are this and that!”

07:08.879 --> 07:14.110
You can brand yourself as anything but not
as Sahaj Yogis, unless and until you have

07:14.110 --> 07:17.699
got it.

07:17.699 --> 07:36.850
It is that essential, that authentic, that
intrinsic, that innate, that you have to be

07:36.850 --> 07:37.850
that.

07:37.850 --> 07:44.870
You can be an Englishman if you get a British
passport.

07:44.870 --> 07:50.490
You can be a director anywhere if you can
qualify for that.

07:50.490 --> 08:01.759
But you cannot be a Sahaj Yogi by doing anything
that you have been doing to achieve for worldly

08:01.759 --> 08:09.449
things or worldly positions, worldly possessions.

08:09.449 --> 08:15.699
We see so many such phenomena in our life
that we cannot see or cannot manoeuvre, cannot

08:15.699 --> 08:28.509
do such as a flower manifest into a fruit.

08:28.509 --> 08:39.680
As we cannot germinate a seed, we cannot do
this living thing, which has to be done by

08:39.680 --> 08:48.019
Divine power and not by human power.

08:48.019 --> 08:58.690
Once you get it, the Divine power starts flowing
through you, then you can also charge the

08:58.690 --> 08:59.690
dynamo.

08:59.690 --> 09:01.300
There is no false certificate that can be
given.

09:01.300 --> 09:06.970
You may be having a son who is not realised:
you may stand on your head or do whatever

09:06.970 --> 09:12.240
you please, you just cannot certify unless
and until he has got it.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.491
It is such a strange thing, so unique.

09:15.491 --> 09:21.570
But do you know: this is what you are seeking.

09:21.570 --> 09:30.149
The rest of the things can be sought.

09:30.149 --> 09:43.280
This is the thing which can only be requested
for, to be prayed for, to be asked for.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.779
You cannot demand it.

09:44.779 --> 09:50.150
Only the grace of God can work it out.

09:50.150 --> 09:59.110
Today I happened to read Bible, part of it,
and I was amazed how John has revealed so

09:59.110 --> 10:05.800
many things about chakras and this; but of
course, in a very mystic language.

10:05.800 --> 10:18.570
He calls chakras as the plug/plaque in his
dream he saw, and the deities as the angels.

10:18.570 --> 10:26.630
He has also described the Realisation.

10:26.630 --> 10:29.140
It is so wonderful to read it.

10:29.140 --> 10:38.960
But only after Realisation you’ll understand,
because it’s a very, very deep writing and

10:38.960 --> 10:50.820
you cannot read much from it – mystical
sounding, vague words.

10:50.820 --> 11:01.220
Now, we are here to seek ourselves.

11:01.220 --> 11:05.550
Everybody is floating an enterprise like that,
everybody is saying, “Oh, we are here to

11:05.550 --> 11:08.350
help you to seek yourself."

11:08.350 --> 11:10.870
I may be one of them, too.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.040
Why should you believe me, in any case?

11:13.040 --> 11:20.740
The first thought that will come into your
mind is, “Why should we believe Mataji?”

11:20.740 --> 11:26.899
If you believe in me blindly, it is not going
to help me at all.

11:26.899 --> 11:33.240
Neither it is going to help me, if you are
going to deny.

11:33.240 --> 11:41.519
Like a scientist just keep your eyes open,
keep your mind open, because this is what

11:41.519 --> 11:44.120
you are seeking, not just in this lifetime.

11:44.120 --> 11:51.829
You have been seeking for ages and unless
and until you get it you are not going to

11:51.829 --> 11:57.029
be satisfied, you are not going to find your
fulfilment.

11:57.029 --> 11:58.820
This has to happen to you.

11:58.820 --> 12:09.089
I don’t know how far Gavin has been able
to explain to you what to expect out of Sahaja

12:09.089 --> 12:10.690
Yoga.

12:10.690 --> 12:20.240
But it is the actualisation of this experience
I’m talking about, which has to work out.

12:20.240 --> 12:35.360
Here you see they have drawn a human being,
as he exists, with his Divine instrument within

12:35.360 --> 12:36.360
himself.

12:36.360 --> 12:46.579
These are the patterns of the energies which
are undercurrent of the sympathetic and parasympathetic

12:46.579 --> 12:50.459
nervous system.

12:50.459 --> 12:58.519
The sympathetic nervous system is managed
by two channels within us.

12:58.519 --> 13:09.570
One, on the left hand side that you see with
the blue line, is the power to desire: is

13:09.570 --> 13:13.160
called as ichcha shakti.

13:13.160 --> 13:24.690
And the other one, on the right hand side,
with the yellow line, is the power to act,

13:24.690 --> 13:27.160
which is called as the kriya shakti.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.980
The first one is called as the ichcha shakti.

13:31.980 --> 13:37.199
First one has to desire and then he acts.

13:37.199 --> 13:45.670
And these two powers exist within us as left
and right sympathetic nervous system, which

13:45.670 --> 13:51.960
doctors can see outside the spinal cord, but
this is inside the spinal cord and inside

13:51.960 --> 13:55.720
the cranial bones, inside the brain as you
can see there.

13:55.720 --> 14:05.800
These all can be related to the gross nervous
system that doctors can see.

14:05.800 --> 14:10.040
But they are subtle energies within us.

14:10.040 --> 14:18.020
The one which runs on the left hand side is
connected with the seventh chakras down below;

14:18.020 --> 14:25.800
or you can call it the first chakra.

14:25.800 --> 14:32.560
This gives us desire to live and also desire
to die.

14:32.560 --> 14:46.480
All desires give us emotions, it gives us
existence and when we deny our existence,

14:46.480 --> 14:48.699
then it gives us death.

14:48.699 --> 14:58.360
The other one is the power of action for which
we use our physical being and our mental being.

14:58.360 --> 15:03.850
So, this represents our physical and mental
being.

15:03.850 --> 15:12.970
The central one is called as the path of knowledge:
gyana shakti.

15:12.970 --> 15:20.720
But the knowledge we know of is very different
from the knowledge I am talking about.

15:20.720 --> 15:28.139
I mean the subjective knowledge that we have
achieved as human beings through our evolution.

15:28.139 --> 15:40.810
For example, a human being is much higher
in his awareness than the animal.

15:40.810 --> 15:46.160
His awareness is the thing that he has achieved
through his evolution, which is built in him,

15:46.160 --> 15:47.610
which acts subjectively.

15:47.610 --> 16:06.269
For example, supposing you take a rose flower:
you know it is a rose flower and you enjoy

16:06.269 --> 16:08.759
it.

16:08.759 --> 16:15.050
But for an animal, it makes no difference
whether it is filth or a garden, it can pass

16:15.050 --> 16:18.250
through it most unawares.

16:18.250 --> 16:29.410
So, your gyana shakti means your awareness
or your knowledge – knowledge that is awareness,

16:29.410 --> 16:35.639
human awareness – is developed to a point
and still has to develop more, has to manifest

16:35.639 --> 16:36.639
more.

16:36.639 --> 16:39.779
It has to have another dimension.

16:39.779 --> 16:52.509
Because of a certain gap in between – you
can see the central line; this green gap gives

16:52.509 --> 17:08.750
you the Void – gives you an awareness which
is not yet complete.

17:08.750 --> 17:18.400
The completion of human awareness can only
be achieved if he reaches the absolute point.

17:18.400 --> 17:27.770
Supposing you have not reached the absolute
point then whatever you are talking is relative.

17:27.770 --> 17:30.960
Relative to relative creates confusion.

17:30.960 --> 17:42.020
So, the idea of righteousness, idea of holiness,
idea of sin, everything is relative.

17:42.020 --> 17:54.090
You have to reach that absolute point by which
you judge whether it is holiness or not, whether

17:54.090 --> 17:57.390
it is sinful or not.

17:57.390 --> 18:00.450
That we have to reach.

18:00.450 --> 18:08.760
That absolute point is within us, placed in
our heart, which is called as the Spirit and

18:08.760 --> 18:12.400
is the reflection of God Almighty.

18:12.400 --> 18:19.440
In Sanskrit language it is called as Atma.

18:19.440 --> 18:29.900
That Spirit resides within us, it watches
all our activities, it knows everything about

18:29.900 --> 18:42.290
us and it informs the lowest chakra there,
which records everything that we do – all

18:42.290 --> 18:49.010
our conditionings, all our ego-trips – to
that three and a half-coiled energy, which

18:49.010 --> 18:51.650
we call as Kundalini.

18:51.650 --> 18:53.540
‘Kundalini’ means coils.

18:53.540 --> 19:00.020
This is the Kundalini, as called as the Serpent
power.

19:00.020 --> 19:04.809
Now, horrible things have been said and written
about Kundalini.

19:04.809 --> 19:15.860
When I read, I mean when I even heard about
it, I was really shocked about the naive description

19:15.860 --> 19:17.630
of it!

19:17.630 --> 19:25.480
I’ve always said that it is like a villager
going in the city and putting both the hands

19:25.480 --> 19:29.591
into the plug and saying that, “Electricity
I know, don’t tell me about it!

19:29.591 --> 19:36.440
You see what happens, it gives you a shock
and you just fall back and you break your

19:36.440 --> 19:37.440
neck."

19:37.440 --> 19:46.809
Those who do not know about Kundalini have
written about Kundalini because this is the

19:46.809 --> 19:49.081
only area where nobody can control you.

19:49.081 --> 19:53.500
You can write anything about God, against
God, or do whatever you please, who can check

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
you?

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
There is no law which forbids.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.960
You can write about Kundalini whatever you
feel like.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.800
She is your Mother.

20:01.800 --> 20:11.050
She has been born with you several times.

20:11.050 --> 20:17.400
She is the one who is going to give you Realisation.

20:17.400 --> 20:22.860
And do you think your Kundalini is going to
harm you by any chance?

20:22.860 --> 20:23.860
Is going to torture you?

20:23.860 --> 20:24.860
Is going to trouble you?

20:24.860 --> 20:37.990
And if you have to achieve the highest through
the Divine love of God, is it going to be

20:37.990 --> 20:39.210
torturesome?

20:39.210 --> 20:47.570
Did you get this nose and these eyes and mouth
and everything that you have as a human being

20:47.570 --> 20:49.419
out of some tortures?

20:49.419 --> 20:57.490
You never even felt how it has happened!

20:57.490 --> 21:03.680
How gentle it is, how kind it is!

21:03.680 --> 21:09.590
It is your Mother who is sitting there waiting
for a moment to rise.

21:09.590 --> 21:16.559
Now the whole thing sounds very poetic to
a scientific mind.

21:16.559 --> 21:20.350
But poetry is also a part of human beings.

21:20.350 --> 21:23.590
If it sounds poetic.

21:23.590 --> 21:30.070
It is the poetic work, of the Kundalini.

21:30.070 --> 21:36.770
God is not only science; he is also love,
beauty.

21:36.770 --> 21:43.200
He is not only dry truth; He is also joy.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.700
He is joy.

21:46.700 --> 21:54.320
He’s joy, because he is truth, He’s truth
because He’s beauty.

21:54.320 --> 22:04.890
So, when the Kundalini rises within you through
these six centres that are shown here, it

22:04.890 --> 22:15.030
pierces this area, which is called as the
fontanel bone and gives you Self-realisation.

22:15.030 --> 22:21.940
This is called as baptism.

22:21.940 --> 22:29.909
You cannot go to a theological college and
become a Baptist.

22:29.909 --> 22:34.430
Nobody can brand you a Baptist.

22:34.430 --> 22:36.370
You have to be realised.

22:36.370 --> 22:43.860
This fontanel bone area has to be pierced
through by the Kundalini, then only you become

22:43.860 --> 22:47.010
one with the All-pervading Power, with that
subtle power.

22:47.010 --> 22:53.740
It has to happen; this germination has to
take place within you.

22:53.740 --> 23:03.120
You are still at a seed stage and just by
branding a seed you do not become a tree.

23:03.120 --> 23:13.220
So, it has to happen within us, and has to
happen beautifully, and spontaneously, because

23:13.220 --> 23:20.150
it is a living process of evolution.

23:20.150 --> 23:27.039
We have evolved into human beings from amoeba:
nobody has done anything about it.

23:27.039 --> 23:38.240
And we are not going to do anything about
becoming that for which we are made.

23:38.240 --> 23:44.950
Somebody who has created this machinery is
going to put you through to the mains if he

23:44.950 --> 23:47.110
wants to use it.

23:47.110 --> 23:53.100
But in between there’s a little problem.

23:53.100 --> 24:01.250
Everything was ready, just perfect, just to
be connected to the mains.

24:01.250 --> 24:07.400
But the instrument was given the freedom to
choose.

24:07.400 --> 24:16.230
That is important for evolution, very important,
that you should be given the freedom, a complete

24:16.230 --> 24:20.170
freedom to choose whether it is right or wrong.

24:20.170 --> 24:23.471
Nobody can force that onto you.

24:23.471 --> 24:32.590
In all your freedom you have to choose whether
you want to enter into the Kingdom of God

24:32.590 --> 24:33.590
or not.

24:33.590 --> 24:39.169
Nobody’s going to force you there, to enter.

24:39.169 --> 24:47.070
It has to be your desire; it has to be your
asking.

24:47.070 --> 25:00.090
And for that freedom has been given to use
these two powers of your desire and of your

25:00.090 --> 25:17.770
action which gives you the idea of your accelerator
and of your brake: to know how to drive your

25:17.770 --> 25:36.960
own car, so that the master behind it hands
over the keys to you and car to you.

25:36.960 --> 25:44.410
It was necessary for you to learn these two
powers, to be managed.

25:44.410 --> 25:54.090
But in your freedom and in understanding yourself
you have committed mistakes; you have bumped

25:54.090 --> 25:55.090
your cars too much.

25:55.090 --> 26:01.750
It was said that: keep in the centre, do not
go too much left or to the right or you’ll

26:01.750 --> 26:03.090
get into bumps.

26:03.090 --> 26:06.610
Either you went into the left or to the right.

26:06.610 --> 26:12.090
And when you tried to correct your right you
went into the left, to another extreme.

26:12.090 --> 26:14.490
To correct to the left you went to the right.

26:14.490 --> 26:18.270
By going to the extremes, you will be bumping
your car.

26:18.270 --> 26:27.730
And this is exactly what has happened to us
– doesn’t matter.

26:27.730 --> 26:32.400
The car has to be repaired; it has to be done.

26:32.400 --> 26:36.390
A little patience can work it out.

26:36.390 --> 26:42.370
There’s nothing to get annoyed with oneself.

26:42.370 --> 26:47.210
When the car starts it goes very fast.

26:47.210 --> 26:56.640
Then you
should know how to slow it down, how to organise

26:56.640 --> 26:57.640
it.

26:57.640 --> 27:04.770
Then you have to become the authority, yourself,
of discrimination.

27:04.770 --> 27:09.539
I don’t have to tell you that this is not
good or that is not good.

27:09.539 --> 27:11.350
How is it possible?

27:11.350 --> 27:21.529
Because you become one with the Divine, you
become one with the Primordial Being, with

27:21.529 --> 27:31.960
the Great Being, with the Akbar, and you start
acting according to that.

27:31.960 --> 27:41.230
A subjective manifestation of your awareness
takes place by which you understand what’s

27:41.230 --> 27:46.560
wrong with you and what’s wrong with others.

27:46.560 --> 27:52.090
It is so precise and correct.

27:52.090 --> 27:59.020
You just feel on your hands, on your fingers
as shown, all the centres that are within

27:59.020 --> 28:03.210
you, which are created out of different elements.

28:03.210 --> 28:08.159
Immediately you know what is in imbalance,
what is more, what is less, left is more or

28:08.159 --> 28:12.340
right is more, what is wrong with you.

28:12.340 --> 28:16.289
Even a born-realised child, say, of two years
who can talk, can tell you what’s wrong,

28:16.289 --> 28:17.289
because it’s subjective.

28:17.289 --> 28:23.710
You start feeling it: this is happening, that
is happening.

28:23.710 --> 28:35.720
All this understanding comes to you because
it is Self-knowledge.

28:35.720 --> 28:42.590
But when you know about yourself you also
know about others, because you jump into collective

28:42.590 --> 28:46.559
consciousness.

28:46.559 --> 28:51.860
You ‘jump into’, I say.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.100
You become collectively conscious.

28:53.100 --> 29:00.110
It is not that I say, “We are all brothers
and sisters,” have United Nations for it

29:00.110 --> 29:02.059
and use it for giving jobs to everyone.

29:02.059 --> 29:04.100
It’s not that way.

29:04.100 --> 29:08.070
It’s an actualisation that takes place:
you just become.

29:08.070 --> 29:18.269
Jolly well you’ll have to feel it.

29:18.269 --> 29:19.269
You cannot get rid of it.

29:19.269 --> 29:20.269
It becomes your awareness.

29:20.269 --> 29:22.840
You just feel it and that’s how you correct
it.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.250
Everybody is a part and parcel of that Great
Being.

29:26.250 --> 29:32.320
As this finger can feel this finger; and as,
when it is hurt, this finger goes to sooth

29:32.320 --> 29:38.970
it, in the same way the whole is more important
than individual.

29:38.970 --> 29:46.100
So, when we are seeking our wholesomeness
we have to know that, only through Self-realisation,

29:46.100 --> 29:51.179
by becoming one with the Self, you are going
to get it.

29:51.179 --> 29:55.899
Talks, talks, talks – we have had many.

29:55.899 --> 29:59.279
Let’s have the real and get it.

29:59.279 --> 30:02.350
You cannot argue about it.

30:02.350 --> 30:08.470
It happens, especially in this country I have
seen, because you are great thinkers and analysers.

30:08.470 --> 30:13.179
Everything you try to analyse.

30:13.179 --> 30:18.700
But this is beyond your thinking.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.220
You go beyond your rationality.

30:20.220 --> 30:25.850
Because rationality is limited and you have
to be triggered into something unlimited,

30:25.850 --> 30:30.500
so you have to leave that.

30:30.500 --> 30:36.240
You have to go into that space.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.360
You cannot explain it by thinking.

30:38.360 --> 30:46.049
But then, when it starts flowing through you,
you use your rationality to understand, “Why

30:46.049 --> 30:49.730
this finger is burning?”

30:49.730 --> 30:53.980
It is decoded in Sahaj Yoga.

30:53.980 --> 31:19.130
In Sahaj Yoga you know all the decoding of
all the signals you get from the Absolute.

31:19.130 --> 31:20.169
Your computer starts working.

31:20.169 --> 31:26.580
But who has to decode the computer and the
numbers?

31:26.580 --> 31:29.990
All that is explained.

31:29.990 --> 31:34.649
That is what you have to learn, that is known
as gyana.

31:34.649 --> 31:38.659
After Realisation what one has to do?

31:38.659 --> 31:42.320
Also, a point comes up sometimes.

31:42.320 --> 31:47.390
Supposing, I have enlightened this one (candle),
now what have we to do?

31:47.390 --> 31:49.020
Is to give light.

31:49.020 --> 31:50.250
What a question!

31:50.250 --> 31:55.650
When you are enlightened, after enlightenment
what do you do?

31:55.650 --> 31:57.550
Is to give light, that’s all.

31:57.550 --> 32:01.460
That’s your job, is to give light.

32:01.460 --> 32:08.419
But how to manoeuvre it, how to organise it
– that’s the thing you have to learn,

32:08.419 --> 32:13.919
for which I’m willing to work very hard.

32:13.919 --> 32:25.049
And everything that I say, you have to verify
it, and you have to see for yourself.

32:25.049 --> 32:30.950
After Realisation, if you start doubting – we
had people who started doubting – and what

32:30.950 --> 32:32.049
are you doubting here?

32:32.049 --> 32:34.090
I don’t want anything from you.

32:34.090 --> 32:43.929
I am sitting here just to give, not to take
anything, then what are you doubting about?

32:43.929 --> 32:48.460
They start doubting and the progress is much
less.

32:48.460 --> 32:57.350
But some people are of very high calibre in
this country, are of a very great high calibre,

32:57.350 --> 32:59.340
and once they get it, they just get it like
that.

32:59.340 --> 33:06.159
You will be amazed, there was one gentleman
who went to someone and was ditched and deceived

33:06.159 --> 33:14.710
and absolutely he was looted: he just saw
my photograph.

33:14.710 --> 33:21.700
There are, Gavin himself has got his Realisation
only through my photograph.

33:21.700 --> 33:27.100
There are many here who have got it through
my photograph only.

33:27.100 --> 33:29.120
But they are people of calibre.

33:29.120 --> 33:36.200
So, I said that Sahaj Yoga is going to judge
you and you are not going to judge Sahaj Yoga:

33:36.200 --> 33:37.200
you cannot.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.130
You cannot measure it.

33:39.130 --> 33:42.140
It is an ocean.

33:42.140 --> 33:45.000
Just enjoy it and be your Self.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.419
It’s a gift for which you have been asking,
so just take it.

33:49.419 --> 33:57.260
It’s absolutely free, you cannot pay it
and don’t think on these hopeless worldly

33:57.260 --> 33:58.260
ways.

33:58.260 --> 34:05.700
It is the love of God, the grace of God, which
one has to receive.

34:05.700 --> 34:09.500
Just enjoy it.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.840
Just have it.

34:10.840 --> 34:17.740
That’s what it is and we should work it
out.

34:17.740 --> 34:27.880
Now I had a system, especially in these countries,
that people can ask me questions.

34:27.880 --> 34:33.870
But it happened like that, that questions
were asked by extremely negative people mostly.

34:33.870 --> 34:39.870
I would answer them, they would take everybody’s
time who were anxious to have Realisation.

34:39.870 --> 34:43.880
And then just as soon as we started, “All
right let’s have the Realisation,” the

34:43.880 --> 34:45.320
person would get up and go away.

34:45.320 --> 34:46.320
It’s common practice.

34:46.320 --> 34:53.280
The person is not at all interested in Self-realisation,
seems to be more interested in questions.

34:53.280 --> 35:00.920
And, sort of, you give more chance to a person
who is negative and useless than to people

35:00.920 --> 35:02.750
who really want Realisation.

35:02.750 --> 35:09.720
Now, if there is a question, I still would
like you to ask me, no doubt, but be sensible

35:09.720 --> 35:11.770
and considerate.

35:11.770 --> 35:14.650
Thank you very much.

35:14.650 --> 35:17.710
May God bless you all!

35:17.710 --> 35:23.220
Be considerate when you ask a question, but
ask.

35:23.220 --> 35:29.130
It’s nice to ask, you know, because I have
no questions, that’s the problem.

35:29.130 --> 35:33.900
Not to fear, please ask the question.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.722
Lady from the audience: Have a question.

35:35.722 --> 35:38.370
Shri Mataji: You have been always asking,
I am not going to allow this time.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.400
She is useless.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.430
You asked me.

35:40.430 --> 35:41.580
Somebody else should ask me.

35:41.580 --> 35:44.740
Her questions are always like that, has no
meaning.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.180
You’d better get your Realisation, perfected.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.180
Anybody else?

35:48.180 --> 35:49.180
Ask.

35:49.180 --> 35:55.770
She has been every time asking questions,
but you don’t want to perfect your Realisation.

35:55.770 --> 35:59.560
You must perfect your Realisation.

35:59.560 --> 36:05.160
Yes please.

36:05.160 --> 36:16.350
Yes, ask me, loudly.

36:16.350 --> 36:55.530
Seeker: I’ll try not to be negative but
I’ve tried a few different organisations

36:55.530 --> 36:57.200
and I’ve searched quite a lot of different
organisations

36:57.200 --> 36:58.850
Shri Mataji: I can see that.

36:58.850 --> 36:59.850
All right

36:59.850 --> 37:04.433
Seeker: and always I come to the same question
that people who are interested in truth, how

37:04.433 --> 37:05.433
could they come to such an organisation as
yours?

37:05.433 --> 37:06.433
Shri Mataji: I have no organisation.

37:06.433 --> 37:07.433
We have no membership.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.433
This is not an organisation.

37:08.433 --> 37:09.433
Question: But…

37:09.433 --> 37:10.433
Shri Mataji: Now, I’m very happy that…Please,
sit down, all right?

37:10.433 --> 37:11.433
I know.

37:11.433 --> 37:12.433
He is a seeker.

37:12.433 --> 37:13.433
He has been to many organisations.

37:13.433 --> 37:14.433
There has to be.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.580
It is written already in the Bible, there
have to be many like these, you see, coming

37:16.580 --> 37:17.580
up.

37:17.580 --> 37:19.370
All right?

37:19.370 --> 37:32.760
But first of all, I have requested you that
here we are not selling anything, to begin

37:32.760 --> 37:33.990
with.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.140
We are not selling.

37:35.140 --> 37:42.810
What are you going to lose in any case?

37:42.810 --> 37:49.380
Maybe, your ego a little bit, maybe.

37:49.380 --> 37:56.599
Because we are identified with our ego, we
think our self is our ego, you see; which

37:56.599 --> 37:59.970
may not be pampered [here] also, as in another
organisation.

37:59.970 --> 38:06.100
I have been, seen people who are very honest,
they go to other organisations and they find

38:06.100 --> 38:13.230
that only their ego is pampered and their
pockets are being vacated.

38:13.230 --> 38:16.430
No, that’s not here.

38:16.430 --> 38:22.100
Now, I also do not guarantee that you will
get your Realisation definitely.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.730
It’s like germination.

38:23.730 --> 38:29.510
If it works, I’ll be the happiest person
and you’ll be the happiest.

38:29.510 --> 38:33.450
If it doesn’t work, please come again, we’ll
work out.

38:33.450 --> 38:41.010
So, again if you have started judging about
it, it won’t work out.

38:41.010 --> 38:51.210
There are fifty per cent people here who are
realised people and they know your problems.

38:51.210 --> 38:57.870
They haven’t given me a single pie (1\192
Rupee), nothing!

38:57.870 --> 39:07.580
But if you come here, you
have come in your own right, because you are

39:07.580 --> 39:19.530
a seeker and I respect you for that and I
love you for that.

39:19.530 --> 39:20.530
And I am here for you.

39:20.530 --> 39:21.530
Not in London.

39:21.530 --> 39:24.720
I didn’t come to London for that, I came
by chance.

39:24.720 --> 39:29.150
You know that my husband was appointed here
to this U.N.

39:29.150 --> 39:33.000
thing, he was elected, and I had to come here.

39:33.000 --> 39:41.900
But also, this is God’s desire that I should
be with you because there are so many seekers!

39:41.900 --> 39:44.920
So, I am with you here.

39:44.920 --> 39:51.120
If you have been to many organisations and
many thugs also, I must tell you very, very

39:51.120 --> 39:55.370
frankly that you’ll have problems much more
than anybody else will have.

39:55.370 --> 40:04.100
It’s going to be difficult to give you Realisation,
because all these organisations do spoil your

40:04.100 --> 40:07.600
Kundalini and your chakras.

40:07.600 --> 40:13.840
I’ve yet to meet one organisation which
doesn’t spoil.

40:13.840 --> 40:22.570
Except for, there are some real people who
live in the forests and they have disciples.

40:22.570 --> 40:29.730
But I can make them out: if they are coming
from the real gurus, I immediately know.

40:29.730 --> 40:39.080
But no organisation, so far, I have known,
who has even kept your instrument intact.

40:39.080 --> 40:47.800
They have spoilt your Agnya, they have spoilt
other centres, which are so vital, just to

40:47.800 --> 40:49.810
get some money out of you.

40:49.810 --> 40:55.970
I don’t know why they have done it.

40:55.970 --> 41:04.970
I know you are tired of seeking but no more
you should repent about it.

41:04.970 --> 41:09.580
But if you have been to other gurus, you must
tell us, because we’ll have problems correcting

41:09.580 --> 41:11.060
you.

41:11.060 --> 41:22.400
Even if you read the books, even if you just
think of them or even if you have a photograph,

41:22.400 --> 41:26.750
it acts negatively; it’s a problem.

41:26.750 --> 41:36.150
So, I request you to let us know if you have
been to any guru.

41:36.150 --> 41:43.890
I wish I could tell you the experiences we
have had from people who went to other gurus,

41:43.890 --> 41:46.820
and the things that we had to correct.

41:46.820 --> 41:53.180
And most of the Sahaj Yogis are here who have
been, at least half of them or most of them

41:53.180 --> 42:00.080
have been to some gurus somewhere and have
known this, that there is a problem.

42:00.080 --> 42:02.180
Doesn’t matter!

42:02.180 --> 42:14.780
If your Kundalini is preserved even by them,
I’ll be very thankful.

42:14.780 --> 42:16.880
All right?

42:16.880 --> 42:20.030
It’s correct now?

42:20.030 --> 42:22.130
What’s it?

42:22.130 --> 42:25.020
So, should we start now?

42:25.020 --> 42:28.500
Let us see how it works out, hmm?

42:28.500 --> 42:29.500
Hmm.

42:29.500 --> 42:44.890
Now, put your hands like this.

42:44.890 --> 42:47.320
One has to be extremely positive, after Realisation,
about it.

42:47.320 --> 42:52.870
If you go down you will move very slow.

42:52.870 --> 43:00.400
It is like three paces forward and two paces
backwards.

43:00.400 --> 43:03.410
When you will reach?

43:03.410 --> 43:05.670
You’ll never reach!

43:05.670 --> 43:10.600
Before that, I do not ask for anything.

43:10.600 --> 43:14.450
But after that you have to do it.

43:14.450 --> 43:21.610
Secondly, when you put your hands towards
me, as shown there, all these fingers have

43:21.610 --> 43:32.670
got the centres, the chakras, dormantly placed
on these fingers: one, two, three, four, five,

43:32.670 --> 43:40.960
six and seven, on the left, on the right;
left sympathetic and right sympathetic.

43:40.960 --> 43:48.410
So, when you are placing towards me, like
as you place towards this one, it radiates

43:48.410 --> 43:49.410
heat.

43:49.410 --> 43:52.250
In the same way, I radiate this Divine love.

43:52.250 --> 43:57.620
You will also radiate when you will be realised,
when you will be enlightened.

43:57.620 --> 44:03.450
So, when you put your hands towards me you
take this radiation within yourself.

44:03.450 --> 44:08.030
It goes within yourself onto these.

44:08.030 --> 44:20.990
There are two very important chakras, which
work it down on your, these, two lines and

44:20.990 --> 44:27.170
inform the Kundalini through the lower chakra
to rise.

44:27.170 --> 44:32.740
And you can see with your naked eyes the pulsation
of Kundalini in some people, who’s this

44:32.740 --> 44:33.740
chakra is catching.

44:33.740 --> 44:34.740
With naked eyes you can see.

44:34.740 --> 44:36.270
You can see even the rising of the Kundalini.

44:36.270 --> 44:44.450
If you have the stethoscope you can feel the
throbbing going up.

44:44.450 --> 44:50.920
When it reaches here, it throbs here and then
it stops.

44:50.920 --> 44:54.400
That is the time you are realised.

44:54.400 --> 44:57.360
But some people have lots of imbalances.

44:57.360 --> 45:00.910
Now, how do we remove them?

45:00.910 --> 45:09.200
Supposing the ego is too much on this side,
there is no space here.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.900
So, you have to push down the ego.

45:11.900 --> 45:15.770
If the superego is too much, you have to push
down the superego.

45:15.770 --> 45:27.720
So, those who are realised people, also radiate
this, this Divine love, this integrated force

45:27.720 --> 45:35.980
of vital energies and they, through their
vibrations, manoeuvre it by giving these radiations,

45:35.980 --> 45:37.560
they take it down.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.900
You can also do it.

45:40.900 --> 45:45.820
You have to learn, only, the art.

45:45.820 --> 45:49.330
And then they raise the Kundalini, so the
Kundalini starts.

45:49.330 --> 45:53.340
If there is an obstruction you can see the
Kundalini going there.

45:53.340 --> 46:00.180
For example: somebody has a liver trouble;
you can see the Kundalini going there and

46:00.180 --> 46:01.180
throbbing.

46:01.180 --> 46:07.880
If you have the kidneys trouble, the Kundalini
will go there; poor thing will supply to the

46:07.880 --> 46:09.090
kidneys and then come up.

46:09.090 --> 46:16.300
That’s why the first thing that will happen
to you is, that physically you will be cured.

46:16.300 --> 46:19.760
We have definitely cured cancer.

46:19.760 --> 46:23.570
The president of India (Neelam Sanjiva Reddy)
who was suffering from cancer, was cured by

46:23.570 --> 46:24.570
me.

46:24.570 --> 46:28.030
If you want you can write to him and ask.

46:28.030 --> 46:33.840
That cancer can only be cured by Sahaj Yoga,
by nothing else, is also another fact.

46:33.840 --> 46:37.110
But doesn’t matter; don’t get too frightened
about it.

46:37.110 --> 46:45.290
Just now, let us have the Kundalini moving.

46:45.290 --> 46:48.460
Let us see if it starts.

46:48.460 --> 46:49.800
It has to start.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.520
By anything you cannot do it.

46:53.520 --> 46:58.800
Only through Divine radiation you can do it.

46:58.800 --> 47:05.690
But (break in recording) I have seen horrible
Kundalinis, I have seen, in doing this work.

47:05.690 --> 47:11.190
People are not aware of it: what we have done
to harm ourselves, people are not aware and

47:11.190 --> 47:17.680
that’s why sometimes it takes time, doesn’t
matter.

47:17.680 --> 47:23.840
As I have patience and love for you, please
have patience for yourself because you are

47:23.840 --> 47:25.080
a seeker.

47:25.080 --> 47:33.930
You are a seeker of truth and that’s why
I’m here.

47:33.930 --> 47:41.230
Now please put your hands like this close
your eyes.

47:41.230 --> 47:43.570
And you have to put your feet on the ground.

47:43.570 --> 47:52.220
The reason is that the Mother Earth sucks
in lots of our problems.

47:52.220 --> 47:59.250
Now the people who are realised also can help
me, they are just like my hands.

47:59.250 --> 48:01.100
You have to also become my hands.

48:01.100 --> 48:05.400
But when they move their hands and all that
you are not to get frightened of them.

48:05.400 --> 48:07.880
They are the people who are salvaging you!

48:07.880 --> 48:10.160
They have to help you.

48:10.160 --> 48:15.910
If they know swimming, they have to fetch
you to the shores.

48:15.910 --> 48:18.500
They have to extend their hands to you.

48:18.500 --> 48:20.420
Don’t be frightened of them.

48:20.420 --> 48:24.400
Come on the shores and you are going to do
the same thing.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.510
There’s nothing to be frightened.

48:26.510 --> 48:28.360
They are not going to do anything.

48:28.360 --> 48:31.830
Might be, they might feel, if you are realised
or not.

48:31.830 --> 48:38.300
So, just put your hands like this.

48:38.300 --> 48:42.820
Now, you have to close your eyes.

48:42.820 --> 48:47.060
Close your eyes, please.

48:47.060 --> 48:52.370
But some cannot close their eyes because the
eyelids will flicker.

48:52.370 --> 48:56.730
So, please open your eyes, in that case.

48:56.730 --> 49:02.810
If your eyes can be easily closed without
any flickering, then keep them closed.

49:02.810 --> 49:06.500
That’s a very good sign.

49:06.500 --> 49:18.830
Now, if you feel anything like little shaking
in the hands or anything like that, then open

49:18.830 --> 49:19.830
your eyes.

49:19.830 --> 49:21.260
Nothing external should happen.

49:21.260 --> 49:23.340
If it happens, then open your eyes.

49:23.340 --> 49:31.410
Even if you feel heat in the hand, you’ll
not feel much, but if you feel slightly even,

49:31.410 --> 49:40.580
which you think is little unbearable then
open your eyes.

49:40.580 --> 49:45.320
When you close your eyes most of you will
find you have no thoughts in your mind already.

49:45.320 --> 49:51.610
This is called as Nirvichar Samadhi, is called
as thoughtless awareness.

49:51.610 --> 50:00.180
It’s this samadhi, it’s this state which
is achieved after thousands of years of meditation,

50:00.180 --> 50:02.030
as they say.

50:02.030 --> 50:04.920
It’s the most difficult thing, agreed.

50:04.920 --> 50:09.900
But there could be someone for whom this could
be only just a play
