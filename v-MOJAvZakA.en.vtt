WEBVTT

06:35.060 --> 06:43.272
Today we are going to celebrate the birth
of Jesus Christ.

06:52.605 --> 07:03.665
He came on this earth in a very special
way, that He was born to a Virgin.

07:04.973 --> 07:10.267
And we can understand

07:12.634 --> 07:22.312
as you know as Shri Ganesha was also born
in the same way,

07:22.513 --> 07:31.766
and as Jesus is an incarnation
of Shri Ganesha,

07:33.911 --> 07:39.690
He had all His powers when He was born,

07:39.891 --> 07:49.548
He did not have to bring any outward
weapons to show that what powers He had.

07:49.749 --> 07:54.098
But He had all the powers with Him,

07:54.299 --> 08:00.110
but still He tried to show tolerance and
understanding,

08:00.311 --> 08:07.170
because at that time the people with whom
He had to deal

08:07.371 --> 08:12.789
were absolutely ignorant of spirituality.

08:13.466 --> 08:16.388
They were actually Jews

08:16.589 --> 08:24.949
and they were instructed by Moses, Abraham,
all these people.

08:25.150 --> 08:30.863
But they had lost their moorings, and they
didn’t know what to seek,

08:31.064 --> 08:35.757
how to seek, and they were not seekers.

08:35.958 --> 08:42.193
They are quite satisfied with all the Jewish
ritualism they had

08:42.394 --> 08:48.467
as also in other religions we do the same.

08:48.668 --> 08:55.243
There was no seeking at all for anything
great.

08:56.149 --> 09:05.206
And so He had a very difficult life,
extremely difficult life.

09:07.287 --> 09:10.815
When He was born there was a sign,

09:11.016 --> 09:20.927
of a star which three men saw and they
followed it

09:21.159 --> 09:30.225
and reached that place where they found
that He was born in a manger,

09:30.426 --> 09:39.312
the very simple, simplest possible place
to be born.

09:41.846 --> 09:44.323
Was born in all great difficulties

09:44.524 --> 09:55.642
but it was shown clearly through a star
that He was something great.

09:55.843 --> 10:02.006
The other day somebody was asking Me,
"How did You find Ganapatipule?"

10:02.754 --> 10:08.703
Actually I didn’t know, and in Maharashtra
this is not a very well-known place.

10:08.904 --> 10:12.287
They go to Ashtavinayakas but not to this
Mahaganapati.

10:12.488 --> 10:15.266
They had no idea.

10:16.252 --> 10:19.796
But I was coming back from Ratnagiri

10:19.997 --> 10:26.879
and I saw really a very big star on top
of this temple.

10:27.413 --> 10:30.282
But nobody could see it, that’s
the problem is.

10:30.483 --> 10:33.190
At that time no sahaja yogis could see it.

10:33.391 --> 10:40.670
So I told them, "Let us follow this star."
It was a very big, big one, unusually big,

10:40.871 --> 10:48.640
not like a star, but quite a big, big star,
very unusual.

10:48.841 --> 10:53.217
But they couldn’t see it. Other people who
were with Me

10:53.418 --> 10:57.167
they said that, “We can’t see it.”

10:58.408 --> 11:05.548
I said, “Doesn’t matter.” So I told them
to turn it,

11:05.749 --> 11:13.222
turn it from this Hadkamba they call it,
and let us go on this another road.

11:13.423 --> 11:21.136
And we just followed it. They, of course,
listened to Me, and they did not argue.

11:21.337 --> 11:24.457
And we were travelling, travelling, we were
quite late,

11:24.658 --> 11:29.526
but still I [said], “Doesn’t matter,
it’s alright, let’s go”.

11:29.727 --> 11:33.664
And by the time we reached Ganapatipule,

11:33.865 --> 11:38.052
it was the dawn, beautiful dawn, I can’t
forget that.

11:38.253 --> 11:46.536
And in that dawn we see such a beautiful
place here where we are now.

11:46.737 --> 11:51.866
And I said, “This is the place where we
have to be,

11:52.067 --> 11:57.562
where we have to get all the sahaja
yogis to.”

11:57.763 --> 12:02.687
Of course, you know that Rabindranath
Tagore has already described

12:02.888 --> 12:08.234
about this place that people will come here
from all over the world

12:08.435 --> 12:12.125
and at the shore of Bharat this will be
done.

12:12.326 --> 12:17.425
All these are predicted, have been done
already,

12:17.925 --> 12:23.788
but how miraculously I discovered this
place is very surprising

12:23.989 --> 12:28.643
as those three great men discovered Christ.

12:30.941 --> 12:39.270
And the place was really blessed and was
very beautifully vibrated.

12:40.130 --> 12:47.426
I stayed here for two days and I decided

12:47.627 --> 12:52.822
that this is the place we have to take.

12:53.023 --> 12:58.871
Ultimately we got this land and we got
all these things here.

13:00.238 --> 13:04.130
but people troubled us a lot.

13:04.563 --> 13:08.671
Such negative people they troubled us.

13:08.755 --> 13:15.431
Like Christ also was troubled and tortured, very much tortured by people.

13:16.347 --> 13:19.957
So at a very young age His parents took him away

13:20.652 --> 13:23.643
and they say that they were in Kashmir.

13:25.863 --> 13:34.323
And then He came back from Kashmir later on,

13:35.372 --> 13:41.608
is described in one of the books I’ve read about Christ being in Kashmir,

13:42.608 --> 13:44.975
where He met Shalivahana,

13:45.249 --> 13:48.771
I would say our forefather.

13:49.312 --> 13:52.941
Is very well described, and in Sanskrit it is written.

13:53.370 --> 13:56.761
I think the writer didn’t know what he was writing.

13:57.292 --> 14:05.995
And the whole thing was the conversation between Christ and Shalivahan,

14:06.375 --> 14:13.135
and Christ told that “The country from where I come is spiritually dead.

14:15.503 --> 14:19.823
And the people are running after all filth and dirt.

14:20.636 --> 14:24.096
This is My country and I want to live here”.

14:26.041 --> 14:29.870
But Shalivahana told Him that, “You are such a great saint”.

14:29.995 --> 14:33.932
He also told His name, as Issa.

14:36.307 --> 14:39.338
“But You should go back to Your own country.

14:39.933 --> 14:42.565
You go over back to Your own country and”

14:42.612 --> 14:46.416
– the word he has used – “You teach them Nirmala Tattwam,

14:46.675 --> 14:49.938
the principle of Nirmala”.

14:50.299 --> 14:53.360
Is clearly written in Sanskrit language.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.837
But He went there, and the people were so negative, so negative,

14:59.532 --> 15:03.665
that they crucified Him just after three years.

15:06.089 --> 15:10.180
This is the sad story of His incarnation.

15:10.795 --> 15:15.807
But after that there were twelve disciples He had.

15:16.930 --> 15:20.855
And out of these twelve disciples the weakest was Peter.

15:22.087 --> 15:26.072
Very weak and he denied Christ thrice.

15:26.424 --> 15:29.471
And Christ had told him that,

15:29.496 --> 15:33.815
“ A satan will come and meet you”.

15:34.145 --> 15:36.721
It was Paul who met him.

15:37.325 --> 15:44.713
And the whole thing changed into a satanic anti-Christ force, as Catholic church.

15:45.674 --> 15:49.643
This Catholic church when I read about it I am shocked,

15:49.830 --> 15:55.330
how can a religious movement be such a criminal thing.

15:55.658 --> 16:00.383
It is absolutely criminal, it is anti-Christ.

16:00.493 --> 16:06.305
It has been making all money, everything, deceiving people,

16:06.649 --> 16:11.915
and brought what, nothing but their own kingdom.

16:13.063 --> 16:16.969
They live like saints to show,

16:17.024 --> 16:20.446
but all kinds of filth is going on in that Vatican,

16:20.471 --> 16:23.258
I have read another book recently.

16:23.283 --> 16:27.087
But I can’t imagine how can they call them Christians

16:27.173 --> 16:30.811
when Christ was innocence and purity.

16:31.640 --> 16:37.429
Such a shame in the name of God to do all these things.

16:38.031 --> 16:43.179
They also made artificial, we can say artificial

16:47.108 --> 16:54.996
notes and distributed them through their own bank,

16:55.292 --> 16:59.436
they have a banking system, they have all kinds of things,

16:59.461 --> 17:03.858
I lived there, I know how terrible they are.

17:04.062 --> 17:11.280
And this is what is the outcome of such
a great soul that sent by God.

17:12.124 --> 17:18.005
They changed the Bible also – not only that, but they tortured the Gnostics,

17:18.030 --> 17:24.216
the people, the early Christians who have had a religious experience.

17:25.708 --> 17:32.919
All nonsense they are doing morning till evening and
people are absolutely slavish about it.

17:35.403 --> 17:37.921
They are talking of conversion:

17:38.364 --> 17:42.241
what conversion has brought good to them?

17:42.312 --> 17:47.631
In Italy there is mafia, there’s all kinds of nonsensical things

17:47.679 --> 17:56.381
and the Catholics are all full of sins and they have to just go and confess.

17:58.077 --> 18:05.202
When they are celebrating His millennium I was not at all very joyous about it,

18:05.863 --> 18:12.042
because this is another way to make money, to make money out of this festival.

18:12.800 --> 18:19.319
Actually Christ’s Birthday was not celebrated for 347 years,

18:19.756 --> 18:25.850
and they thought it’s a good idea to celebrate His birthday so that we can make lots of money.

18:26.514 --> 18:36.034
First of all they are all allowed to drink and be merry, all these systems started of immorality there.

18:36.261 --> 18:39.995
They also make a wine called Benedictine.

18:41.284 --> 18:45.745
They are making all kinds of things which are filthy and bad,

18:45.769 --> 18:48.659
and they have amassed so much of money with them

18:49.112 --> 18:52.760
that no-one can challenge them and can ask them

18:53.073 --> 18:56.291
to get out of the lives of people, but is the people

18:57.112 --> 19:00.888
who has seen it through and through and have given them up.

19:01.345 --> 19:04.360
This is the beauty of Christ.

19:04.454 --> 19:09.165
He has saved really these people, they were seekers of truth,

19:09.298 --> 19:15.640
and they have been able to take to Sahaj,

19:15.828 --> 19:18.531
to understand that there is truth in it, and we should not anymore cling on to something that is untruth. And now we have so many here who have been harmed and who have been tortured by this Catholic Church.

19:18.703 --> 19:23.234
and we should not anymore cling on to something that is untruth.

19:23.515 --> 19:32.624
And now we have so many here who have been harmed and who have been tortured by this Catholic Church.

19:33.023 --> 19:36.052
They are quite frightened of Sahaja Yoga I must tell you,

19:36.201 --> 19:39.958
they know that we are standing on the truth.

19:40.294 --> 19:44.591
They are very much frightened and they are trying their level best to harm us.

19:44.607 --> 19:48.731
But so far they have not done anything, they couldn’t achieve anything

19:48.966 --> 19:56.200
despite everything. At the end they had one argument through the newspaper about Sahaja Yoga

19:56.482 --> 20:00.849
They said, ‘We don’t want to have one religion all over the world’.

20:01.148 --> 20:04.178
I said, ‘Yes, because how will you fight then?

20:04.218 --> 20:06.561
You must have many religions to fight’.

20:06.609 --> 20:07.952
Then they stopped.

20:08.054 --> 20:11.397
The newspaper they were arguing, they all stopped it.

20:11.734 --> 20:18.116
All these nonsensical ideas came, and it became so much

20:18.155 --> 20:23.467
of an extreme that people saw through it ‘This is wrong’,

20:23.562 --> 20:27.692
and they really took to Sahaj.

20:29.326 --> 20:35.583
If there is no truth, why are they converting people all over the world?

20:36.021 --> 20:39.057
What have they achieved by conversion?

20:39.191 --> 20:47.785
And that is why one has to understand that all religions are equally the same.

20:49.762 --> 20:54.808
In its manifestation may be different, but in its essence

20:54.833 --> 20:59.805
they all say that you have to have your self-realization.

21:00.173 --> 21:03.891
Whatever words, this way or that way,

21:04.055 --> 21:11.523
it has said you must seek the truth, in the Bible if you read – even, you’ll be amazed, in Koran

21:11.548 --> 21:17.196
though they have tried to camouflage lots of things, it has not been possible.

21:18.204 --> 21:22.367
Now Muslims also have taken up another view,

21:23.110 --> 21:25.813
worse than even Christians.

21:26.126 --> 21:28.625
That they are saying that

21:32.540 --> 21:37.750
Mohammed Sahib was the last incarnation.

21:38.188 --> 21:45.055
If He was so, there were so many others afterwards they may not accept:

21:45.196 --> 21:49.321
we had Guru Nanaka, we had Gyaneshwara,

21:49.438 --> 21:53.406
we had Shri Shirdi Sainath.

21:53.438 --> 21:56.313
How these prophets came on this earth?

21:56.391 --> 21:58.735
How can you deny it?

21:59.274 --> 22:01.789
If you say we don’t believe then you are stupid.

22:03.680 --> 22:08.078
Because if He was the last,
how did these incarnations came here?

22:10.288 --> 22:16.426
So many things Christ has said.
On the cross He said, “Behold the Mother”.

22:16.627 --> 22:27.255
Behold, is a very good word, meaning that
look forward, see the Mother.

22:27.589 --> 22:32.274
At the time of His death also He said this.

22:32.475 --> 22:41.073
And all these people are just trying
to create violence, torture,

22:41.274 --> 22:47.129
all kinds of things which cannot be Divine.

22:48.083 --> 22:53.155
So one has to understand that you cannot
spread any religion

22:53.356 --> 23:00.518
with violence, with force, you cannot.
Only with love and compassion.

23:00.719 --> 23:05.785
You can spread Sahaja Yoga only through
love and compassion.

23:05.986 --> 23:11.138
And that compassion is not a mental stuff

23:11.339 --> 23:15.252
that we think we are better than others
so we should change them.

23:15.453 --> 23:22.161
No. It is more love and compassion.

23:22.362 --> 23:26.598
That you feel that we can really resurrect
people,

23:26.822 --> 23:33.724
not trying to change anything, but
to resurrect,

23:33.925 --> 23:37.643
as they are, we will resurrect them.

23:37.844 --> 23:43.292
This is our work: to resurrect people and
to give them the truth.

23:43.493 --> 23:47.805
There are many, many people all over
the world, and you have seen now,

23:48.006 --> 23:53.412
we are working in the 86 countries.
In a place like Benin

23:53.613 --> 23:57.327
we have got seven hundred sahaja yogis,
seven thousand, sorry,

23:57.528 --> 24:02.167
sahaja yogis, who were Muslims.

24:02.368 --> 24:06.936
And I asked them, "How did you take
to Sahaj?"

24:07.137 --> 24:09.661
He said, “Obvious.” I said, “Why?”

24:09.862 --> 24:14.013
I said, “First of all, why did you become
Christians?”

24:14.214 --> 24:19.796
He said, “No, we didn’t. We just became
Muslims.” “But why?”

24:19.997 --> 24:27.567
“Because the French who were ruling there
were extremely immoral people,

24:27.768 --> 24:32.415
very immoral. And we thought, what’s
the use of following their religion,

24:32.616 --> 24:36.673
who drink all the time, and do all kinds
of filth,

24:36.874 --> 24:43.832
so how can we be better off? So we took
to Islam.”

24:44.033 --> 24:50.024
But they are now in Sahaja Yoga because
whatever it is

24:50.225 --> 24:55.670
they have discrimination. They are seekers
and they have discrimination.

24:55.871 --> 25:03.128
Imagine, they are all, we can call them
as people from the black, black people.

25:03.329 --> 25:07.197
But they have such enlightened mind, I was
amazed.

25:07.398 --> 25:11.910
They have made poems on Me, they have made
lots of things about Me,

25:12.111 --> 25:15.103
and seven thousand of them have become,

25:15.312 --> 25:20.838
and they said one day the whole country
will become, sahaja yogis.

25:26.728 --> 25:31.031
In Turkey you know there is Islam,
so-called.

25:31.232 --> 25:36.577
But there was their leader Atatürk Kemal
Pasha, who was an enlightened soul

25:36.778 --> 25:42.067
and he talked to them that all this is
nonsense, this purdah system, this, that,

25:42.268 --> 25:44.627
oppression of women, all is nonsense.

25:44.828 --> 25:50.222
And he really made them much free. They
are extremely creative people there,

25:50.423 --> 25:56.703
and imagine, there are two thousand sahaja
yogis in Turkey.

25:56.896 --> 26:01.238
When there was this earthquake, you’ll be
amazed to know

26:01.439 --> 26:10.851
not one sahaja yogi was killed nor
anybody’s house was destroyed.

26:16.786 --> 26:23.277
In our country also we have four, four
states

26:23.478 --> 26:26.798
which were all converted into Catholicism.

26:26.999 --> 26:30.323
Now I have talked to them, and they said,
“No, these people only told us

26:30.524 --> 26:36.616
how to dress up well, go to church, sing
hymns and come back home.”

26:37.157 --> 26:42.630
I was surprised: they are dressed better,
no doubt, than other people,

26:42.815 --> 26:48.478
but how could they accept such a thing?
Because they are aboriginal,

26:48.679 --> 26:57.058
they are people who are not yet open
to light of the modern times or anything.

26:57.432 --> 27:00.880
And then after that,

27:03.920 --> 27:11.788
after that, they were trying their hands
on Orissa.

27:13.315 --> 27:21.187
In Orissa there were already 35 to 40
persons who were Catholics.

27:21.904 --> 27:27.083
And I asked some sahaja yogis from
Australia

27:27.284 --> 27:31.049
to go and do some work there of Sahaja
Yoga.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.909
And they established nine centers there.

27:35.110 --> 27:38.111
Nine centers of Sahaja Yoga were
established.

27:38.312 --> 27:45.912
But the best part of it, when there was
a huge big destruction

27:46.113 --> 27:51.115
through a hurricane that came,

27:53.062 --> 28:01.070
all the sahaja yogis who have newly
accepted Sahaja Yoga, are all safe.

28:03.786 --> 28:07.651
All their houses are safe.

28:07.852 --> 28:12.187
So now what is going to come is the Last
Judgment.

28:12.388 --> 28:18.138
In that all people who still are trying
fundamentalism,

28:18.339 --> 28:22.381
who are fundamentalist, they’ll be
destroyed, I think so.

28:22.582 --> 28:28.228
Because the way they are destroyed in all
these countries, I just don’t understand

28:28.429 --> 28:32.635
what is happening and why these people are
getting destroyed,

28:32.836 --> 28:38.514
their families destroyed, their houses
destroyed. Is the Kalki I think is acting,

28:38.715 --> 28:44.886
and working it out in all these places
in such a severe manner.

28:47.951 --> 28:52.745
Those people who do black magic and all
that, they were also destroyed.

28:52.922 --> 29:00.379
Is very surprising that in Orissa not one
sahaja yogi was hurt.

29:01.793 --> 29:09.034
It is such a big protection of the Divine
on sahaja yogis,

29:09.235 --> 29:13.799
which was to come, was told long time back
it was going to come.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.439
But people got lost in ritualism,
in the priesthood,

29:18.640 --> 29:23.617
and its all kinds of talks.

29:24.704 --> 29:28.908
By talking you cannot get a spiritual
experience,

29:29.109 --> 29:34.797
by reading you cannot get any spiritual
experience.

29:34.998 --> 29:40.913
Guru Nanaka has said it, Kabira has said it,
even Adi Shankaracharya has said

29:41.114 --> 29:47.554
that this is Shabda Jalam, this is the web
of words. “Oh Mother, take me out of that”.

29:47.755 --> 29:52.885
All these people who knew the truth have
said the same thing,

29:53.086 --> 29:57.867
they have repeated the same thing, if you
read their lives you’ll be surprised.

29:58.068 --> 30:05.215
Even the Sufis who were Muslims have
written the same thing all over.

30:05.416 --> 30:10.258
It’s surprising, how can Sufis living
in Turkey

30:10.459 --> 30:16.572
or living in, even they were in Pakistan –

30:16.773 --> 30:20.620
now is Pakistan, that time it was India –

30:20.821 --> 30:26.738
they all have written the same thing, some
great poets even from England

30:26.939 --> 30:35.149
have written the same thing, that truth
is truth, and truth is love.

30:35.350 --> 30:38.560
That’s what Christ wanted to establish,

30:38.761 --> 30:43.596
but He was born in a very, very difficult
situation.

30:43.797 --> 30:49.238
And the people who took over, as priests
and Church and all that,

30:49.439 --> 30:56.482
made full advantage of that and have really
oppressed all the people.

30:56.762 --> 31:02.784
There’s no oppression in Sahaja Yoga.
It’s your free will by which you come in.

31:02.985 --> 31:09.854
And you have to find the truth, truth about
yourself, you should know yourself.

31:10.055 --> 31:13.659
All the time Christ has said, “Know
Thyself.”

31:13.860 --> 31:16.847
And they don’t try that at all anywhere,
Knowing Thyself,

31:17.048 --> 31:20.523
because they don’t know themselves.

31:22.422 --> 31:28.781
This situation we have in every religion.

31:28.982 --> 31:36.493
They all came to fight it, to tell us
what is the right path what to follow.

31:36.694 --> 31:39.855
What Christ did was a very remarkable
thing,

31:40.056 --> 31:47.293
that He told the Jews that He is the Light,
He is the Path.

31:47.499 --> 31:50.897
But He didn’t say He was the destination,
clearly,

31:51.098 --> 31:55.585
because He knew that somebody has to come,

31:55.786 --> 32:00.454
and He said the Holy Ghost will come,

32:00.655 --> 32:03.934
and She’ll have three things as you know:

32:04.135 --> 32:10.657
that She’ll be a Comforter, She’ll be
a Counselor, and She’ll be a Redeemer.

32:10.858 --> 32:17.732
He didn’t use She or He, but in Hebrew
language it says “It”.

32:18.364 --> 32:23.519
So people have misused Bible to such
an extent that in England

32:23.720 --> 32:29.102
a king wanted to divorce his wife so he
authorized the Bible.

32:29.303 --> 32:35.599
How can such an adharmic fellow authorize
such a holy book like Bible?

32:35.835 --> 32:41.546
Because the power: with the power he want
to control,

32:41.746 --> 32:47.029
want to control all that is reality.

32:47.230 --> 32:49.819
This is a blind power.

32:50.020 --> 32:55.675
But if you have a real power, then you know
what to respect, what not to respect.

32:55.876 --> 32:58.015
Which way to go, which way not to go.

32:58.216 --> 33:06.070
Because you have a sight, you know a very
bright understanding of the whole thing.

33:06.271 --> 33:13.581
Which road you have to follow, where you
have to go, and which is the right thing.

33:13.782 --> 33:19.295
Thank God through this Kali Yuga, because
of all kinds of horrible things,

33:19.496 --> 33:24.863
as also among Hindus lots of funny, funny
rituals they have,

33:25.064 --> 33:31.852
that people have seen through that this is
not the end of it.

33:32.053 --> 33:35.595
You have to seek, you have to seek.

33:35.812 --> 33:41.628
But the only thing which is very important
is that all of them have said

33:41.829 --> 33:46.154
that you have to seek, you have to find out
your Self.

33:46.355 --> 33:51.272
Which is very clearly written in some
of the Indian scriptures.

33:51.473 --> 33:54.370
Some of them, I would say not all of them.

33:54.571 --> 33:57.771
Some of them it is written that you must
seek your Self,

33:57.972 --> 34:02.767
specially the saints who came on this earth
in India,

34:02.968 --> 34:09.161
they have tried to say all the time that
you must seek,

34:09.362 --> 34:12.829
you must find out the truth. Because they
knew the truth

34:13.030 --> 34:16.028
and they wanted others to find the truth.

34:16.229 --> 34:20.109
So in every religion there have been
enlightened people.

34:20.310 --> 34:27.075
Among Buddhists also there has been
a Viditama, Lao-Tse, and many others,

34:27.276 --> 34:32.715
who have talked about seeking, seeking
the truth.

34:32.917 --> 34:37.081
Christ has said it very clearly, very, very
clearly,

34:37.282 --> 34:44.267
and at His birthday I feel very happy that
so many of you

34:44.468 --> 34:48.243
have already found out the truth and that
you know

34:48.444 --> 34:52.961
the path of love and compassion and
humility.

34:53.162 --> 34:58.006
As it is we know where Christ resides
within us,

34:58.207 --> 35:02.453
and how to respect Christ, and how
to worship it.

35:02.654 --> 35:06.223
With this Agnya chakra you can make out
a person

35:06.424 --> 35:15.070
whether he is a seeker or he is
a dominating arrogant Christian.

35:16.144 --> 35:19.794
You cannot do that, if you are a Christian
you cannot be that.

35:19.995 --> 35:22.646
If you are that, then you are not
a Christian.

35:22.847 --> 35:25.499
Look at Christ, how humble He was.

35:25.700 --> 35:30.458
He could have finished them off - He had
such powers - all of them;

35:30.659 --> 35:38.358
but He got Himself crucified. The reason
was Agnya chakra was to be broken.

35:38.559 --> 35:42.120
Was to be crossed. And so He accepted.

35:42.321 --> 35:45.420
As I told you He had all the powers
of Shri Ganesha,

35:45.621 --> 35:52.463
which are the most destructive powers.

35:52.664 --> 35:57.270
All these powers come from Mother Earth,

35:57.471 --> 36:01.814
and the Mother Earth can shake the whole
world.

36:02.015 --> 36:06.327
But He was the One who came as Mahavishnu,

36:06.515 --> 36:11.552
as described in the Devi Mahatmya. What
a person He was,

36:11.753 --> 36:16.354
and what He did, all His work is
beautifully described in Mahavishnu.

36:17.206 --> 36:24.088
Now, when they do not know, want to connect the Devi Mahatmya with Christ’s work,

36:24.526 --> 36:28.002
it’s alright, they are lost.

36:28.065 --> 36:32.776
There’s such a disintegration, and there’s no collectivity, nothing.

36:33.018 --> 36:39.226
And they call themselves as the disciples of Christ: you cannot.

36:39.813 --> 36:42.321
You must have love, compassion.

36:42.462 --> 36:47.290
And not for a purpose. They have missionaries who go and

36:47.446 --> 36:53.897
talk of compassion, love, and what they achieve is nothing but conversion, because

36:53.929 --> 36:57.765
it is democracy and they want to have more heads.

36:57.845 --> 37:03.185
It’s so despising, the whole attitude towards Christ,

37:03.326 --> 37:08.505
is so criminal to have such an attitude towards Christ,

37:08.584 --> 37:12.754
who was the One who came to give salvation to the whole world,

37:13.285 --> 37:18.902
to unite the whole world, and to make so many different, different

37:18.926 --> 37:22.652
efforts to spoil His name.

37:23.082 --> 37:30.322
Now I would tell you this, that if Christ
is born and He came on this earth,

37:30.523 --> 37:33.150
it’s a very, very great occasion.

37:33.351 --> 37:36.469
He gave His life for us, He did everything.

37:36.670 --> 37:41.250
And how are we following Him is
by forgiving.

37:41.451 --> 37:47.193
You have to forgive others, you forgive
yourself and you forgive others.

37:47.394 --> 37:51.491
Is very important if you want to open this
Agnya chakra,

37:51.692 --> 37:56.203
where resides our Lord Jesus Christ.

37:56.404 --> 37:59.715
If you cannot forgive others

37:59.916 --> 38:04.892
and you cannot forgive yourself, then this
Agnya won’t open.

38:05.093 --> 38:09.747
And the best part of it, all the Christian
nations I have seen,

38:09.956 --> 38:15.811
where there are so-called Christians, they
all have a very bad Agnya.

38:16.012 --> 38:21.650
If they are really following Christ, why
should there be a catch on the Agnya chakra?

38:21.851 --> 38:29.169
And they are extremely dominating, arrogant
people.

38:29.528 --> 38:35.357
They cannot be the disciples of Christ.
He was so humble,

38:35.558 --> 38:43.294
He was so much one with God Almighty, that
He accepted His crucifixion.

38:43.495 --> 38:48.492
His birth itself is a very great miracle,

38:48.693 --> 38:51.729
and His work is even greater.

38:51.930 --> 38:58.142
We have to win over all the Christians and
tell them what is real Christianity,

38:58.343 --> 39:01.983
what is reality, and what they should
take to,

39:02.184 --> 39:07.335
and how they should justify their following
of Christ.

39:07.536 --> 39:14.328
It is very big organizational thing, and
it’s a big, I mean, political thing,

39:14.529 --> 39:20.586
I mean, all kinds of things are going on.
And all the bad things they have

39:20.787 --> 39:25.110
from, say Hindu religion, they carry on.

39:25.333 --> 39:29.083
So what is the use of conversion also?

39:29.284 --> 39:36.598
So from His life we have to learn that
He took a birth

39:36.885 --> 39:44.138
in such a situation that nobody would have
dared to be born like that.

39:44.339 --> 39:49.962
So much of darkness and ignorance, so much
of cruelty,

39:50.163 --> 39:55.134
that He took His birth at that time is
extremely remarkable.

39:55.335 --> 39:58.962
Such a brave, courageous personality.

39:59.186 --> 40:02.666
Nowadays they make Christ look like
a TB patient, I mean,

40:02.867 --> 40:09.671
just to beg, you know. Because they are
beggars. All the time they are begging.

40:09.872 --> 40:16.385
And I was in Bombay this time, some little,
little girls and boys were singing songs

40:16.586 --> 40:20.479
and they came up, and they said, “Give us
some money.”

40:20.680 --> 40:23.236
I said, “What are you doing?”
“We are singing carols.”

40:23.437 --> 40:26.413
“So you sing! Why do you need money for?”

40:26.614 --> 40:31.568
“You know, we need money, we have no food
to eat.” Imagine.

40:31.769 --> 40:37.147
Then why sing songs of Christ?

40:38.038 --> 40:44.896
All kinds of begging is done. Christ, did
He beg for anything?

40:45.097 --> 40:48.785
Did He want to create beggars on this
earth?

40:48.986 --> 40:54.212
He died, lived with self-respect.

40:54.413 --> 40:59.296
All His qualities are never studied and
people take

40:59.497 --> 41:08.594
to something which is very mundane,
sometimes absolutely degrading, degrading.

41:08.795 --> 41:14.462
He came to give us a very dharmic,

41:14.671 --> 41:19.681
very… I shouldn’t say religious because
that's different meaning,

41:19.882 --> 41:25.817
but I would say a very pious and beautiful
life.

41:26.018 --> 41:30.019
He is the model, He is the model we have
to follow.

41:30.596 --> 41:35.486
Not that to become beggars and go round and ask for alms.

41:35.987 --> 41:41.338
Even in the schools which are Christian schools they teach this to children, that

41:41.542 --> 41:44.291
you go and ask for money, ask for money;

41:44.316 --> 41:46.705
all over the world they are asking for money.

41:46.792 --> 41:49.705
And what do they do with their money God only knows.

41:49.768 --> 41:55.486
Money can never be so important, never so important

41:55.750 --> 42:03.272
– it is just that we use it, but it cannot dominate us.

42:05.499 --> 42:10.132
He came in a very, very humble way, in a manger He was born,

42:10.320 --> 42:12.786
to show that money is not important.

42:14.468 --> 42:24.530
Though in the Sanskrit literature it is written that a God, or God Almighty when He incarnates,

42:24.843 --> 42:32.843
He has aishwarya, means He has wealth,
He must have wealth.

42:33.941 --> 42:37.433
It is meaning the spiritual wealth.

42:37.472 --> 42:40.972
He must be born with the spiritual wealth.

42:41.190 --> 42:46.730
If he has spiritual wealth, then He is the real incarnation.

42:47.347 --> 42:51.626
If you don’t have the spiritual wealth of love and compassion,

42:52.057 --> 42:57.275
and detachment, you cannot be called as an incarnation.

42:57.432 --> 43:04.275
It’s a myth. So we have to test it on people who are saying they are incarnations,

43:04.299 --> 43:08.470
they are gods, they are divine, that they will take you to divine life.

43:08.494 --> 43:11.009
See their own lives, how they live.

43:12.221 --> 43:14.361
See their own temperament.

43:15.873 --> 43:18.615
You can see how Christ knew about:

43:18.680 --> 43:23.107
He told Peter that you’ll meet a satan.

43:23.522 --> 43:25.922
And that’s what he met, this Paul.

43:26.827 --> 43:36.122
In every incarnation’s life there has been negative force curbing the activity of that incarnation.

43:36.560 --> 43:42.364
We too had lots of negative forces, but gradually we have surmounted it

43:42.458 --> 43:49.348
and still I am there living, it’s no, there’s no crucifixion for Me at least.

43:50.200 --> 43:58.200
So this is what it is, because you are seekers and you have found the truth.

43:59.263 --> 44:04.614
This was My job, is to give you the truth. And you have got it,

44:04.817 --> 44:10.395
you have got the spiritual experience, which is the greatest thing one can ask for.

44:10.692 --> 44:14.792
You know yourself and you are so one with each other.

44:15.035 --> 44:20.923
This is the completion of the work of Christ, that He said ‘I will send you the Holy Ghost’.

44:21.457 --> 44:27.729
So this millennium for Me is mixed with funny feelings,

44:27.792 --> 44:33.456
because all created by this Catholic Church, saying ‘this is the Millennium’.

44:33.816 --> 44:35.245
Who says so?

44:36.761 --> 44:43.924
Because it is already not was celebrated for four hundred and something, forty-seven years,

44:43.940 --> 44:50.330
and now you say ‘this is millennium’. So the whole world has said, ‘Now is millennium, millennium, millennium’.

44:51.268 --> 44:58.174
If it is, if it is really the millennium, then what Christ wanted to do

44:58.222 --> 45:05.823
is to take a hunter in His hand and hit all the people who are negative or making money in the name of God.

45:10.893 --> 45:15.276
I am unhappy because is created by Catholic Church.

45:15.386 --> 45:20.071
They have already made so much money out of Christ,

45:20.096 --> 45:29.505
out of His name, and if you meet people say in Brazil, or Argentina, of Peru and all these places,

45:29.591 --> 45:36.278
wherever there is Catholicism, they are very, very poor people.

45:36.310 --> 45:43.919
Catholics are mostly very poor, except in Switzerland I think, where they must, they have banks, maybe that is the reason.

45:44.677 --> 45:49.113
Even these banking people are all Catholics.

45:50.301 --> 45:52.558
Can you imagine?

45:53.730 --> 45:59.902
And Italy also has lots of it, but now, Italians are that way much more open,

46:01.291 --> 46:12.737
much more open and they have been attacking by so many ways this Catholic Church.

46:12.808 --> 46:22.386
France I don’t know, France partly, they are not yet so many, but one day will come this France will have to learn a lesson,

46:22.442 --> 46:26.239
a very serious lesson for whatever they are doing.

46:26.467 --> 46:31.208
They don’t know what is freedom is, actually they don’t know laws.

46:31.302 --> 46:33.847
They are going at random like mad people.

46:33.926 --> 46:35.993
Firstly they drink such a lot.

46:36.457 --> 46:39.066
Drinking according to them is allowed.

46:39.402 --> 46:45.660
How can it be allowed, drinking, which is the greatest curse on human beings?

46:45.880 --> 46:52.949
They said that He went for a wedding and in the wedding He created wine.

46:53.003 --> 46:58.261
In Hebrew language wine means the grape juice.

47:00.503 --> 47:02.766
Not wine which is fermented.

47:02.946 --> 47:06.493
And instantly, how can you create wine?

47:06.821 --> 47:11.430
There’s no logic. You have to ferment it, you have to rot it.

47:12.071 --> 47:15.251
But the Christians are the worst in this.

47:15.392 --> 47:17.592
If somebody dies they will drink.

47:18.360 --> 47:21.337
If somebody’s born, they will drink.

47:21.407 --> 47:25.697
Anything that happens, whether good or bad, they will drink.

47:25.807 --> 47:29.119
Drinking is their religion, specially in France.

47:29.197 --> 47:32.016
Now they have no money, French have no money,

47:32.040 --> 47:36.672
because this drinking business takes out all your money, everything.

47:39.219 --> 47:42.969
Christ never said you should drink. Why will He say?

47:43.016 --> 47:46.586
It goes against your awareness, must understand,

47:46.618 --> 47:55.063
you can’t bring such a bad name to Him saying that He had agreed to people who were drinking.

47:55.079 --> 48:02.014
No, never. He cannot. He was an incarnation of purity:

48:02.468 --> 48:04.468
how will He say such a thing?

48:04.483 --> 48:11.959
I can’t understand the licentiousness, the immorality that people are doing.

48:12.413 --> 48:15.677
They’ll go to church, come back and become immoral.

48:16.249 --> 48:23.897
There’s no restriction on them, because they don’t know, because there is no light,

48:23.983 --> 48:31.827
light of the Spirit in them, to see what is destructive and what is constructive.

48:31.991 --> 48:40.827
That’s why Christ came on this world to show, and they put all these things on Him, and take a license to do whatever they like.

48:40.992 --> 48:46.261
After Sahaja Yoga you realize what is
wrong, what is good.

48:46.462 --> 48:54.254
Unless and until you become a sahaja yogi
is difficult to have this discrimination.

48:54.455 --> 48:58.300
That’s how so many people are lost
in the name of Christ,

48:58.501 --> 49:04.956
lost in the destructive forces of their
being.

49:05.157 --> 49:13.799
As it is we call them all the six enemies
that we have.

49:14.538 --> 49:18.765
So today, when we remember His life,

49:20.870 --> 49:28.651
His birth, His work, His greatness,
His sacrifice,

49:28.852 --> 49:33.721
we have to know that we have to follow
His life.

49:33.922 --> 49:36.508
He is our model,

49:36.693 --> 49:44.062
we have to bear lots of things, we have
to be tolerant, we cannot be aggressive,

49:45.257 --> 49:50.754
we cannot be threat to the freedom
of others.

49:50.955 --> 49:53.765
I know there’s some are satanic people,

49:53.966 --> 49:58.776
but we should not be a threat to them.
Our truth will fight.

49:58.977 --> 50:04.461
This is a very, very simple thing we have
to do.

50:04.662 --> 50:09.381
In Sahaja Yoga see, I have seen people have
taken more

50:09.582 --> 50:14.971
to a very moral life, and a moral behavior,

50:15.179 --> 50:21.319
and a whole culture also. Sahaja Yoga
culture

50:21.520 --> 50:29.002
is a very moral culture, very loving
culture, very compassionate culture.

50:29.218 --> 50:36.026
And I am sure Christ within you will be
happy to see you in this manner.

50:36.227 --> 50:39.218
May God bless you.
