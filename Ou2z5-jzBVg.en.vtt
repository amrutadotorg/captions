00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:01.624
[...] also.

00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:07.606
You have such nice places on the outskirts.

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:16.862
On the outskirts you have really very
nice places in Sydney

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:26.203
and this picnicking has helped you to make
your collectivity better.

00:00:26.404 --> 00:00:30.227
That’s how they started having picnics
and in the picnics they developed

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:42.334
the collectivity, which is very beautiful
to be one with the nature,

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:50.934
see the bounty of the nature and
the variety that they have.

00:00:54.292 --> 00:01:05.835
Is a innate feeling inside always that you
should be one with the nature,

00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:11.918
that you should enjoy the nature.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.427
I mean, it’s maybe because they say we have
evolved from animals

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:23.847
so we like nature, you see. But it’s so
much round,

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:29.756
so much your temperament, everything
when you see the nature

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:38.298
and start seeing it, how it obeys the laws
which govern it.

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:46.489
Now see, if you see every leaf, any leaf,
is not comparable with another leaf,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.513
if you put it under microscope they’ll be
all differently made.

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:59.557
So the variety’s so much in the nature,
but still how they abide together.

00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:08.319
And the greatest thing they have is that
always the desire to get the sunlight.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:15.224
And every leaf, every branch tries to give
chance

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:21.734
to another leaf and another branch, that
they all get the sunlight.

00:02:21.935 --> 00:02:30.788
If you have to see collectivity, really you
see in a jungle or in a place like this.

00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:42.621
How they live together and with such
happiness, with such unity.

00:02:43.376 --> 00:02:50.887
They are all under the complete control
of the Divine laws, no doubt,

00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:54.552
and they are so much enjoying.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:03.633
It’s only the human beings who have got
this freedom,

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:07.994
the will, “free will” as they call it.

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:11.746
If you want to go to heaven, you can go
to heaven.

00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:16.353
If you want, you can go to hell.

00:03:19.263 --> 00:03:24.165
And that is what we are facing now
in modern times,

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:34.569
that if we do not take course to sensible
things

00:03:36.423 --> 00:03:43.748
we may be all wiped out of the surface
of the Earth.

00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:50.805
I’ve been telling since long that it
affects our genes.

00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:55.987
Supposing a father is an alcoholic, the son
also gets it in his genes.

00:03:56.188 --> 00:03:59.907
So many things, most of the vulnerability
that you have

00:04:00.108 --> 00:04:13.422
or what you can call the susceptibility
is coming from these genes.

00:04:13.623 --> 00:04:18.183
Now the susceptibility to do something
wrong,

00:04:18.594 --> 00:04:24.286
always to take to something bad,
whatever is destructive,

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:27.793
comes from the genes;

00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:38.137
and it was said that the Asians have
two genes which protects them,

00:04:38.338 --> 00:04:45.464
bars them for doing something wrong.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:52.183
Might be a culture research, I don’t know.

00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:57.332
And the Aboriginals and the people who
have lived in the nature

00:04:57.533 --> 00:05:01.294
have only one gene that protects.

00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:06.947
But for white skin, there’s no gene
to protect. Can you imagine?

00:05:07.148 --> 00:05:13.964
They are left to winds. Whichever way
the wind blows, they start blowing.

00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:22.250
So, it’s such a big problem with the white
skin.

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.523
Also they think they are the higher race,
but they are not

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:28.593
according to the biological process,
you can say.

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:33.268
You can see the Germans, what they did.
I mean, killing children in the gas...

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:38.893
How could they do it? I mean, I just –
unimaginable.

00:05:41.798 --> 00:05:47.848
The way they have killed people in all
the African countries also,

00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:52.306
specially in America, the Spanish.

00:05:54.466 --> 00:05:59.741
Unimaginable. The way they have treated
other people everywhere.

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:07.124
Cruelty comes to them first. Very easily
they can become cruel.

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:13.966
They take to bad things very easily.

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:16.883
There are some Sahaja Yogis who came
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:17.084 --> 00:06:23.364
stayed in Sahaja Yoga for so much and
again they have taken to their bad life.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:30.036
So now it is very much to be understood

00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:35.586
that you have to be very careful and
cautious.

00:06:36.857 --> 00:06:40.457
The bhoots will first catch you.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.380
That’s why so much schizophrenia
everywhere.

00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:49.809
If you – schizophrenia is so much true
in America. So much.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.844
All kinds of horrible diseases they have.

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:57.126
But I can’t understand how they got it.

00:06:58.965 --> 00:07:02.466
So one has to be very careful

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:07.918
that after coming to Sahaja Yoga you must
stick on

00:07:08.134 --> 00:07:18.199
to your sublime Self, to your glorious
Self, otherwise it is dangerous.

00:07:19.343 --> 00:07:25.579
When one thing about Sahaja Yoga I was
amazed that how it cleanses the genes.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:36.295
Actually, gene in a Persian language is
called like a “bhoot,” you know Jin,

00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:44.222
but this whole theory is now showing

00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:55.864
that white-skinned people are more
vulnerable to all kinds of things.

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:01.473
And I think they are the ones who have
suffered a lot

00:08:01.674 --> 00:08:04.559
because there must have been a big fight
within,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.738
that ‘What is this nonsense we are doing?
Why should we do it?’

00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:19.642
And that’s why so many of them started
seeking, so many of them.

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:26.261
The seeking is so much suggested in Indian
culture, everything,

00:08:26.462 --> 00:08:31.558
but nobody did that the way you people
were seeking, it’s creditable;

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:35.858
because you realized, perhaps, that this
is a terrible life you are into.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:40.653
‘Why are we here, so unprotected?’.

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:49.261
And that’s why so much of – we have so
many Sahaja Yogis all over the world

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:56.210
who have taken to Sahaja Yoga, and are
steadying themselves

00:08:56.411 --> 00:09:00.817
and are progressing beautifully.

00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:06.806
That means the genes which were not
protecting have become protective now,

00:09:07.007 --> 00:09:15.107
one thing, and those genes which make you
vulnerable to things also become clean

00:09:15.308 --> 00:09:21.011
and you cannot get to those things.
They said the people who get AIDS

00:09:21.212 --> 00:09:27.305
are the ones who have genes like that,
they are vulnerable to AIDS.

00:09:32.376 --> 00:09:40.013
So, this new dimension that the science
has exposed before us

00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:51.065
tells us two things, that by living like
a white country,

00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:58.282
people saw the hell itself and that’s why
they have taken now,

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:03.873
with such a big jump, to Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:04.849 --> 00:10:14.767
And your duty is to see that you get more
out of all that hell.

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:19.692
Around you, if you see – I mean, when you
read the newspaper you are shocked.

00:10:19.893 --> 00:10:23.069
It’s not the accident by which people die,

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:30.545
but all kinds of diseases, murders, this,
that going on. God knows, such violence.

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:33.815
Specially in America, you’ll be surprised

00:10:34.016 --> 00:10:36.547
that I can’t even wear my wedding ring
there.

00:10:36.748 --> 00:10:43.278
My husband doesn’t allow Me to wear
My wedding ring, even mangal sutra.

00:10:43.479 --> 00:10:47.181
And what goes wrong with them, I don’t
know,

00:10:47.382 --> 00:10:54.216
that they take to violence without
any difficulties.

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:58.031
We had one gentleman who came from America.

00:10:58.232 --> 00:11:01.954
He had already murdered his brother and
murdered his mother also –

00:11:02.155 --> 00:11:08.162
mother and brother, both. I said,
“How could you do that?”

00:11:08.363 --> 00:11:13.834
And so many you will find in England
who have killed their children.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.162
And the children, when you see them,
nothing but –

00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:23.981
you develop a kind of a special sweet
feeling, isn’t it – very sweet.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.215
It’s a - in Sanskrit called as “Vatsalya.”

00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:32.169
In our all Indian languages we use
that word, Vatsalya,

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:38.447
when the feeling that you get when you
see a little child.

00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:41.496
They have described Shri Krishna as
a little child.

00:11:41.697 --> 00:11:44.317
They have described Shri Rama as a little
child.

00:11:44.518 --> 00:11:51.742
Also Christ as a little child has been
described in the Indian churches.

00:11:51.943 --> 00:11:57.317
Beautiful, very beautifully He has been
described.

00:11:59.944 --> 00:12:05.932
One song, one poem was there, written
very beautifully

00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:13.302
that Christ as a child, who can turn
the whole universe with His own finger,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:18.548
was putting His own finger in the mouth
as a child.

00:12:20.872 --> 00:12:24.710
Such beautiful poetry is written about
children,

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:29.567
how they behave, but not so much in
the English language, Spanish language.

00:12:29.768 --> 00:12:33.246
They go more for these love affairs
and things like that.

00:12:33.447 --> 00:12:36.575
But what about children?

00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:43.867
They never describe children, how beautiful
they are.

00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:47.881
I think I have read hardly about ten
or twelve poems.

00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:52.158
One of them I remember is “The Toys.”

00:12:52.359 --> 00:13:02.017
There’s such Poet says that he got very
angry with his child and he beat him,

00:13:04.073 --> 00:13:07.348
and the child was crying, and then
the child went off to sleep

00:13:07.549 --> 00:13:12.725
with a little doll, maybe, or something.

00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:17.676
And when he saw him sleeping like that,
he says to God

00:13:17.877 --> 00:13:23.972
that, “Maybe I might do lots of mistakes
and You might punish me,

00:13:24.181 --> 00:13:31.705
but when I’m dying, then You must forgive
me as I have forgiven my son”.

00:13:31.906 --> 00:13:35.303
That is a very beautiful song was written
by him.

00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:42.048
But still, the description of a child, how
when he runs -

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:49.800
when he runs, when he jumps, when he walks,

00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:53.845
it’s a beautiful songs about Shri Rama.

00:13:54.053 --> 00:13:59.277
[Mother says in Hindi “Do you know
the song Thumak Chalat Ram Chandra?”]

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.119
Yes. Now these words are such that
we cannot explain in English,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.432
but - when they walk, you know, with –
started walking,

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:15.280
so their body, you know, moves in a way
that’s called “thumakna” in Hindi language.

00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:21.540
So described by Tulsidasa, that Shri Rama
is walking in that way:

00:14:21.741 --> 00:14:24.567
Thumak Chalat Ram Chandra.

00:14:24.768 --> 00:14:34.008
And His anklets are singing and then
He is looking round

00:14:34.209 --> 00:14:38.513
and every pebble on which He is walking
is reflecting Him,

00:14:38.714 --> 00:14:45.902
like the souls in which He is reflected.

00:14:46.103 --> 00:14:51.414
Even Shri Krishna’s childhood is described
very well, His mischiefs, everything.

00:14:51.615 --> 00:14:58.628
All these things have been described and
this is called as one of the moods.

00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:03.158
As we have, you see, nine moods described,

00:15:03.367 --> 00:15:06.781
one of the moods is vatsalya, vatsalya ras.

00:15:06.982 --> 00:15:14.367
Or “rasa” means the - [in Hindi: "What we
will call that?"] rasa means the essence

00:15:14.568 --> 00:15:21.352
of a poetry where that gives you a feeling,
is rasa.

00:15:22.904 --> 00:15:26.193
This is not there in the Western idea,
you see,

00:15:26.394 --> 00:15:30.837
because they just think of romance only,
nothing else.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:35.436
So they don’t have rasa in their mind.

00:15:35.637 --> 00:15:42.051
We have nine rasas, out of which this
vatsalya ras is the best.

00:15:42.252 --> 00:15:45.992
We have bhakti ras when you have
bhakti for someone.

00:15:46.193 --> 00:15:52.391
Also we have shringar, but shringar is
only between husband and wife

00:15:52.592 --> 00:15:56.870
and also just before marriage, once
marriage is settled

00:15:57.071 --> 00:16:02.140
or you know you are going to marry some
and some. That’s a shringar rasa.

00:16:03.358 --> 00:16:07.586
Like that, we have also vibhatsa, means
grotesque.

00:16:07.787 --> 00:16:11.291
You see something very ugly, describe
the death

00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:22.665
or something you describe the vultures
eating, eating the corpses.

00:16:22.866 --> 00:16:25.959
All this is also described
as vibhatsa.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.289
So we have nine ragas - nine rasas, and
these rasas are –

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.481
you must have seen in some dances they
must have shown.

00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:43.032
One is also of anger, and when a person
gets anger, you see,

00:16:43.233 --> 00:16:46.934
how his anger is expressed and – in words.

00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:55.232
But then later on this thing, this anger
is also depicted

00:16:55.433 --> 00:17:02.056
and all these rasas are depicted in
the form of dancing –

00:17:02.257 --> 00:17:12.887
dancing also which is a very… very fast,
we can say, fast movement.

00:17:13.088 --> 00:17:17.252
And these fast movements are also
shown very –

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:22.891
these all nine rasas can be shown
in one dance,

00:17:23.092 --> 00:17:27.514
see how one changes from one to another
and then to another.

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:33.003
So it is a very deep understanding of human
beings.

00:17:33.204 --> 00:17:37.865
But as far as the children are concerned,

00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:42.442
I think Indians love them the most.
They love them,

00:17:42.643 --> 00:17:47.838
but, on the, though because of their love,
they discipline.

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:51.810
If you love your children, you must
discipline them.

00:17:52.011 --> 00:17:57.817
Today I just wanted to tell you that
the children are to be brought up

00:17:58.018 --> 00:18:03.903
in a proper way. That means you shouldn’t
spoil them, firstly.

00:18:04.104 --> 00:18:08.403
Now, we have problems of children who
came to see Me

00:18:08.604 --> 00:18:14.580
and they are telling that these children
cannot fit into the pattern

00:18:14.781 --> 00:18:19.104
of our Sahaja Yoga school in Dharamsala.

00:18:19.305 --> 00:18:26.627
So one child is a very adamant child,
extremely adamant

00:18:26.828 --> 00:18:33.851
and you tell him something he goes on
more doing the same thing.

00:18:34.052 --> 00:18:38.037
And if you say, ‘I’ll punish you.’ ‘All
right, don’t give me food. Don’t do this.’

00:18:38.238 --> 00:18:43.797
He is so adamant and he’s developed
this kind of a funny situation.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:47.985
Now definitely such a child, we should
say, is possessed.

00:18:48.186 --> 00:18:51.227
He’s not a normal child, he’s a possessed
child

00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:54.610
and one has to deal with that child
in that manner.

00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:59.362
Another child could be who is a back-number
in the class, can be.

00:18:59.563 --> 00:19:07.920
Now the back-number child is a child
which, which is also possessed,

00:19:08.121 --> 00:19:13.318
maybe in some depressive mood he must
have felt something,

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:17.766
he lost his brother or something. So
he’s become depressive.

00:19:17.967 --> 00:19:21.825
He is depressed and when he is depressed
then what he is doing

00:19:22.026 --> 00:19:29.249
that he is always sulking and he cannot
pay attention to his work,

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.564
and he is not so good.

00:19:33.778 --> 00:19:38.414
Thirdly, there are children who are not
disciplined at all.

00:19:38.615 --> 00:19:42.629
Maybe the father is not disciplined,
the mother is not disciplined.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.777
But they are not at all disciplined and you
cannot discipline them.

00:19:46.978 --> 00:19:53.856
It’s very troublesome and they make such
problems. They go on answering.

00:19:54.057 --> 00:20:02.379
The fourth category of children that they
have reported are really very violent type,

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:09.567
extremely violent. They want to bash this,
break that and every sort of thing.

00:20:09.768 --> 00:20:13.242
It is impossible to understand why they
do it,

00:20:13.443 --> 00:20:19.022
but My own theory is this: that if
the children are told all the time

00:20:19.223 --> 00:20:23.069
that this is very important, carpet is
important, ‘Don’t spoil this,’

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:28.983
all material nonsense we talk to them,
then these children

00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:34.338
sort of develop a kind of an antagonistic,
you can say,

00:20:34.538 --> 00:20:40.461
or a kind of a opposition to that kind
of a suppression,

00:20:40.662 --> 00:20:46.924
and then they want to destroy everything
that they see as a possession.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:54.451
So how should we manage these things
is a big problem.

00:20:54.652 --> 00:20:59.454
The last and the least is the most
horrifying thing is

00:20:59.655 --> 00:21:05.974
that they start taking to sex life very
early, very early.

00:21:06.175 --> 00:21:10.623
They’ll enter into the teacher’s bed
or into some friend’s beds

00:21:10.824 --> 00:21:15.107
and that’s horrible.

00:21:16.838 --> 00:21:20.253
And for this, I don’t know whom to blame,

00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:27.506
but maybe that, again we can say genes;

00:21:27.707 --> 00:21:33.406
but the newspapers, the media, all those
things

00:21:33.607 --> 00:21:37.615
are teaching children all these things.
Horrible films we have.

00:21:37.816 --> 00:21:42.200
I mean, they are, they come into hell,
born into hell.

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:47.598
So they learn these things sometimes,
I don’t know how,

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:52.174
and it’s very difficult to get these things
out of their mind.

00:21:52.375 --> 00:21:58.279
There’s no innocence at all. At a very,
very young age they do it.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:04.186
Some people say that because children
are sometimes molested or something,

00:22:04.387 --> 00:22:07.413
so they develop this in their childhood

00:22:07.614 --> 00:22:11.575
and they go on developing it more and
more and more.

00:22:11.776 --> 00:22:17.809
But still, I just don’t know what is child
molestation is supposed to be.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.589
Why such stupid feelings come into
people’s mind?

00:22:20.797 --> 00:22:25.278
They also ruin their own children!

00:22:25.479 --> 00:22:32.714
So if you see the whole thing is, there’s
one point is missing,

00:22:32.915 --> 00:22:39.708
and that is, we don’t love our children
as we should.

00:22:40.899 --> 00:22:44.094
We should punish them in case we find
they are not all right.

00:22:44.295 --> 00:22:49.871
It is our duty to teach them discipline,

00:22:50.072 --> 00:22:55.813
not only for their good, for the good
of the whole society.

00:22:56.432 --> 00:23:01.018
There’s a story in India that there was
one thief

00:23:01.219 --> 00:23:07.653
and then he murdered people, he did this
and he did that.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.144
So he was to be hanged.

00:23:13.345 --> 00:23:17.000
They asked him, ‘Have you any desire
before being hanged?’

00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:20.119
He said, ‘Only one. Please call my mother.’

00:23:20.341 --> 00:23:26.334
So they called the mother and he went
and bit her hard on her hand.

00:23:26.535 --> 00:23:29.010
Say, ‘Why are you doing this?’

00:23:29.211 --> 00:23:37.591
He said, ‘Because when I did the first
crime, you didn’t say anything to me.

00:23:37.933 --> 00:23:42.064
You tried to hide it and you didn’t do
anything to me.

00:23:42.265 --> 00:23:45.012
That’s why now I am being hanged.

00:23:45.213 --> 00:23:50.246
So it was your duty to correct me
at that time,

00:23:50.447 --> 00:23:56.006
whichever way it was possible, but you
did not do it.’

00:23:57.249 --> 00:24:02.898
So, the love of a person should not be
such that it should spoil people.

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:05.907
Say now, if I’m your Mother, I love you
very much,

00:24:06.108 --> 00:24:08.658
you know that very well and you also
love Me,

00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:11.818
but if I have to correct you, I must have
courage to correct you

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:15.355
and tell you what I want you to do.

00:24:15.556 --> 00:24:18.055
You need not get into temper or anger.

00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:23.076
I seldom, I think, very seldom, I really
get angry with people.

00:24:23.277 --> 00:24:27.104
But you have to tell them.

00:24:27.305 --> 00:24:32.110
So you start now as you are Sahaja Yogis,
your children are born realized

00:24:32.311 --> 00:24:36.035
and Sahaja Yogis the other way round
people - that ‘You are all Sahaja Yogis,’

00:24:36.236 --> 00:24:39.991
you tell your children, ‘you can’t behave
like that.’

00:24:40.192 --> 00:24:44.464
Put the dignity into their mind. Tell them
that this is the way

00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:48.947
you have to behave, otherwise you are
not Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:49.148 --> 00:24:54.626
Give them the credentials, I would say,
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:59.905
that you are Sahaja Yogi, you are born
realized, you cannot behave like that.

00:25:00.106 --> 00:25:06.141
But I have seen some people try to fight
with others for their own children,

00:25:06.342 --> 00:25:10.851
which is absolutely wrong and immature
behaviour.

00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:15.636
If somebody says something to your child,
it’s all right,

00:25:15.837 --> 00:25:19.695
and you should try to accept it very well.

00:25:19.896 --> 00:25:24.571
See that at least somebody has told you
about your child and you must correct.

00:25:24.772 --> 00:25:31.207
Is a real loving father or mother who
are concerned about it,

00:25:31.408 --> 00:25:39.029
not only to protect him and protect
all the vices he is developing.

00:25:39.398 --> 00:25:41.356
Now as it is,

00:25:41.557 --> 00:25:45.730
in the Western life there’s such an attack
on innocence, I can see this,

00:25:45.931 --> 00:25:51.089
such a lot, because why should they kill
their children?

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.180
Well, I’ve never heard of such a thing
in India,

00:25:55.381 --> 00:25:57.457
that anybody’s killing their children.

00:25:57.658 --> 00:26:01.540
I had a washerwoman. She was staying
in our house, in our -

00:26:01.741 --> 00:26:07.747
we had quarters for them. And she had
eleven children.

00:26:07.948 --> 00:26:15.125
And I had gone away to Lucknow, I was
building a house,

00:26:15.342 --> 00:26:20.810
and in the meanwhile, you see, these
people they cook –

00:26:21.011 --> 00:26:26.745
what do you call that? – starch in the
house. And in a big pot they cook it.

00:26:26.946 --> 00:26:30.317
And this, by mistake you see, that she
had so many children -

00:26:30.525 --> 00:26:37.825
this child crawled up to it and died in
that. I mean, he got into it and he died.

00:26:38.026 --> 00:26:43.203
This lady had ten children left. She was
like a madwoman –

00:26:43.404 --> 00:26:46.223
she was crying, weeping, not eating.
When I went back

00:26:46.423 --> 00:26:48.909
she had not had her food for twenty days.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.388
She had not even taken water or anything,
so much she was crying.

00:26:53.589 --> 00:26:56.479
I told her, “There are ten children you
have got.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:04.049
Now one child God has taken away, so
why are you crying for that child?”

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:09.389
But she couldn’t get over it. She - it took
her months to get over it,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.498
that she has lost one child out
of the eleven.

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:17.923
But when I hear of people who kill their
two children who are there and –

00:27:18.124 --> 00:27:22.935
now the children are killing the parents.
Can you imagine?

00:27:23.136 --> 00:27:29.696
There was recently a case in England,
two boys, I think eight and ten,

00:27:29.897 --> 00:27:36.688
got hold of one little child in
the supermarket and killed him

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:42.631
and put him under the railway track.
Imagine!

00:27:42.832 --> 00:27:48.129
This sweet age of eight and twelve,
what nice things children can do.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.112
What nice things they can do to you.

00:27:51.313 --> 00:27:55.979
Instead of (that) they went and killed
one child! Why?

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.713
We should introspect, we should find out.

00:27:58.914 --> 00:28:03.193
I wouldn’t blame anybody here, but I
would say that we should understand

00:28:03.394 --> 00:28:07.088
why children do like that.

00:28:07.289 --> 00:28:11.211
Firstly, they must get affection.

00:28:11.412 --> 00:28:14.753
They must know somebody loves them
very much and dearly

00:28:14.954 --> 00:28:20.465
and, secondly, the respect. They should
know that they are very much respected

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:24.531
and they have to be respectable.

00:28:24.837 --> 00:28:28.479
Thirdly, they should know also that
they belong

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.139
to a very prestigious family of Sahaja
Yogis.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:37.088
They can’t do all this.

00:28:37.636 --> 00:28:44.289
Their attention also is to be such that
they understand what they are doing.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.738
In the West children don’t have that
attention, I tell you.

00:28:47.939 --> 00:28:53.794
Normally, what attention we have
in the East, we don’t find it,

00:28:53.995 --> 00:28:57.354
that children, even if they are realized
souls, they have the same attention.

00:28:57.555 --> 00:28:59.788
It has to be brought in.

00:28:59.989 --> 00:29:06.521
I remember My Mother always used to say,
“Where is your attention?”, all the time.

00:29:06.722 --> 00:29:09.239
She said, “Where is Your attention?”

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.807
I was quite a philosopher, you know,
so I used to go into meditation.

00:29:14.015 --> 00:29:16.342
So she used to say, “Where is Your
attention?” I said, “Inside”.

00:29:16.543 --> 00:29:19.442
“It’s all right”.

00:29:23.422 --> 00:29:27.213
But I never minded. Nobody minded it,
when she said, “Where is Your attention?”

00:29:27.414 --> 00:29:32.408
Attention is very important thing, where
it goes, what it says.

00:29:32.622 --> 00:29:36.317
So when, say children are describing
something, tell you something,

00:29:36.518 --> 00:29:40.382
they’re very sweet. You should ask them
questions. You must see

00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:45.608
that you ask them questions and they answer
you, very sweet sweet things they answer.

00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:49.524
But in that, you should see where is
their attention,

00:29:49.725 --> 00:29:56.912
what they are describing and what they
are saying to you.

00:29:57.113 --> 00:29:58.949
because they are realized children,

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.536
and the realized children always talk
in a third person also.

00:30:02.737 --> 00:30:05.289
Like you tell them, ‘Now, you better go
home.’

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.659
So they’ll say, ‘This boy will not go.

00:30:07.868 --> 00:30:12.324
I tell you, he doesn’t want to go home.
This boy will not go,’

00:30:12.525 --> 00:30:17.108
meaning this boy is different from the one
which is speaking, you know.

00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:22.468
So they speak like that. And the way they
speak and the way things they say,

00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:25.138
it’s beautiful things they say.

00:30:25.339 --> 00:30:29.337
And one lady tried to write down certain
things the children had to say

00:30:29.538 --> 00:30:34.021
about politics, about politicians, and then
she wrote a book;

00:30:34.222 --> 00:30:37.835
and the book was sold within one week’s
time. It was so sweet.

00:30:38.036 --> 00:30:44.288
I mean, innately, all of us have the same
type of sweetness for our children,

00:30:44.489 --> 00:30:47.442
except for some, I don’t know, what sort
of people are they

00:30:47.643 --> 00:30:50.628
who have a different reaction.

00:30:50.829 --> 00:30:54.648
But for Sahaja Yogis, you see,
in collectivity,

00:30:54.849 --> 00:30:57.392
you must try to bring your child

00:30:57.593 --> 00:31:02.787
in a manner that he doesn’t feel that
he belongs to you only.

00:31:03.478 --> 00:31:05.445
There should be no competition.

00:31:05.646 --> 00:31:08.939
You should also praise other children,
you should,

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:14.005
and never try to praise your child.
It’s not good manners, I tell you.

00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:20.277
It’s not good manners to praise your child,
‘My child is like this. My, my.’ Nothing.

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:26.987
But you praise others’ children first and
the child will see that also,

00:31:27.188 --> 00:31:31.857
and he’ll also praise other parents,
not his own.

00:31:32.058 --> 00:31:34.887
If he learns that, then the collectivity
improves,

00:31:35.087 --> 00:31:38.636
that you start seeing good things
in everything.

00:31:38.837 --> 00:31:42.130
And now, as I was telling you, it’s
a very dangerous situation

00:31:42.331 --> 00:31:47.635
when you [know], I read about the genes
and the no protective genes;

00:31:47.836 --> 00:31:53.130
because I remember once, one student
who had gone to Cambridge.

00:31:53.331 --> 00:31:56.035
He came back and he said, ‘What surprises
me,

00:31:56.236 --> 00:32:02.293
he – they take to drugs like a venture.
They take to anything bad like a venture,

00:32:02.494 --> 00:32:05.135
while for us, we are frightened, you know,
we think this is wrong.

00:32:05.336 --> 00:32:09.862
All throughout, we know it is wrong and
we are doing wrong, knowingly.’

00:32:10.063 --> 00:32:11.927
So he said, ‘I don’t’, he told Me,

00:32:12.128 --> 00:32:16.380
‘I don’t know how they get over this
protectiveness.’

00:32:16.581 --> 00:32:20.052
They just go headlong into it, anything,
you know,

00:32:20.253 --> 00:32:24.715
a love affair with any unknown girl,
they’ll sleep with anyone.

00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:30.033
How can they do it? They don’t even
think whether it is right or wrong.

00:32:30.234 --> 00:32:38.071
That’s what is true, that to introspect
and see for yourself

00:32:38.272 --> 00:32:43.331
whether it is good or bad, is very
important.

00:32:43.532 --> 00:32:46.580
Now also we have some national problems.

00:32:46.781 --> 00:32:49.862
Different nationality has different
problems.

00:32:50.063 --> 00:32:53.627
But in Sahaja Yoga I think we are washed
of all these things.

00:32:53.828 --> 00:32:56.662
I’ve known some people who were drug
addicts.

00:32:56.863 --> 00:33:01.174
The first seven who came to Me, out
of them four were drug addicts

00:33:01.375 --> 00:33:03.014
and they told Me they couldn’t see Me.

00:33:03.215 --> 00:33:05.607
They were just seeing lights coming out
of Me, that’s all.

00:33:05.808 --> 00:33:09.772
Some sort of a miraculous photographs
they had become, I think,

00:33:09.973 --> 00:33:13.667
and they couldn’t see Me in one person.

00:33:13.868 --> 00:33:18.534
And one came and just was there like
a coma, she was sitting like this.

00:33:18.735 --> 00:33:24.981
So difficult. And one of them was
a professor of physics from Australia.

00:33:25.182 --> 00:33:27.945
I don’t know where he has disappeared.

00:33:28.146 --> 00:33:33.697
This fellow, he was a professor of physics
from Cambridge

00:33:33.898 --> 00:33:40.853
and so much in the drug that I asked him,
I said, “What’s your name?”

00:33:41.054 --> 00:33:46.233
So he went on, ‘Ah, ah.’ I said, “I asked
you what’s your name.”

00:33:46.434 --> 00:33:50.920
‘Ah, you asked me my name?’ I said,
“I did ask you your name.”

00:33:51.121 --> 00:33:57.229
‘My name, You said what is my name?’
I said, “Yes, I did say what is your name.”

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:02.520
Went on for five minutes. He could not
come to terms with his name even.

00:34:02.721 --> 00:34:06.850
I said, “What sort of this drug addiction
is there?” It was too much.

00:34:07.051 --> 00:34:11.990
But then he got all right. He improved
a lot - and he was just dying with liver,

00:34:12.191 --> 00:34:17.169
but he got all right. I took him home,
treated him. He was all right.

00:34:17.396 --> 00:34:25.658
So, you see, with such dull brains, you…
because this drug definitely harms,

00:34:25.859 --> 00:34:30.228
really definitely harms the brain cells
because the way I have seen,

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:35.679
after coming to Sahaja Yoga, they got
Realization, very intelligent people.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.716
Some were PhDs. I call them PHD-MADs,
you see.

00:34:39.917 --> 00:34:47.456
And all of them, these PhDs and MADs, were
so much harmed, so much harmed.

00:34:47.657 --> 00:34:52.677
I asked them, “You are such intelligent,
educated people,

00:34:52.878 --> 00:34:57.895
why did you take to drugs – for experience
of what?”

00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:02.154
‘Experience of spirituality.’ I said,
“Who told you?”

00:35:02.355 --> 00:35:06.095
Some guru told them or somebody
told them,

00:35:06.296 --> 00:35:09.167
but I said, “In India nobody would think

00:35:09.368 --> 00:35:12.427
that these drugs can give you
spirituality.”

00:35:12.628 --> 00:35:15.374
He said, ‘No. Such and such guru came
from there

00:35:15.575 --> 00:35:23.254
and he told us that you take to drugs
and you will be spiritual.’

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:28.702
I mean, people like Rajneesh who thrive –

00:35:28.903 --> 00:35:33.397
means all these gurus knew that if you
tell them something

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:38.307
that are the weaknesses of human beings
they’ll take to it, easily.

00:35:38.508 --> 00:35:43.010
Not in India. If Freud had come to India –
I tell you, I don’t know.

00:35:43.211 --> 00:35:45.759
He would have been cut into pieces perhaps.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.047
Nobody would have tolerated a nonsense
like that,

00:35:48.248 --> 00:35:51.663
the way he was talking about the mother’s
love.

00:35:51.864 --> 00:35:57.709
So all such people have been accepted
blindly, all over.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:04.279
See you, not only in America, but also
in this thing, U.K.,

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.200
there was one boy who came to Me
who was the disciple

00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:12.874
of this fourteen year old gentleman,
Guru Maharaji,

00:36:13.075 --> 00:36:18.554
and he was actually on potato diets.
So I said, “Why are you on potato diet?”

00:36:18.755 --> 00:36:23.033
‘Because my guruji has said that if you
give me a Rolls Royce,

00:36:23.234 --> 00:36:27.583
then only I’ll come to England.’ He already
had, I think, fifty-three or something.

00:36:27.784 --> 00:36:30.525
‘So we have to give him a Rolls Royce,
so we are on a potato diet.

00:36:30.726 --> 00:36:39.366
We are saving money.’ I said, “Why are
you doing that – saving money for potatoes?

00:36:39.567 --> 00:36:42.034
Out of potatoes, how much are you saving?”

00:36:42.235 --> 00:36:45.602
He said, ‘We are saving quite a lot and we
are sure by the end of this year

00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:50.837
we’ll have lots of money to buy a Rolls
Royce.’ Ba – ba.

00:36:51.038 --> 00:36:53.967
But I said, “Why are you doing it? You see,
why do you want to give him money?

00:36:54.168 --> 00:36:55.934
Why do you want to give him a Rolls Royce?”

00:36:56.135 --> 00:36:59.570
He said, ‘Because, you see, this Rolls
Royce is just metal,

00:36:59.771 --> 00:37:06.483
but he is going to give us the Spirit.’
“Which spirit?”

00:37:11.206 --> 00:37:14.268
And really – this fellow was, ultimately
he died, you see.

00:37:14.469 --> 00:37:19.654
This one died because I don’t know what
harm they do to people.

00:37:19.855 --> 00:37:25.261
But Rajneesh was using all kinds of dirty
tricks and people took to it

00:37:25.462 --> 00:37:30.807
and that is why I want to tell you that
you should all be very careful.

00:37:31.008 --> 00:37:34.720
Also among Sahaja Yogis we had some
problem in Melbourne.

00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:39.113
Somebody came from Portugal and he
learned certain things from Nepal

00:37:39.314 --> 00:37:43.749
and he did some tricks there. So, among
us also, maybe

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:48.309
somebody who thinks that he should show
that he is a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:54.158
take to some so-called spiritual life
and try to create problems.

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:57.491
So we should not have groups. We should
have no groups.

00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:01.960
Nothing should be a secret. Everybody
should know what everybody is doing.

00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:05.214
That is how collectively we’ll be
all right.

00:38:05.415 --> 00:38:08.157
Because supposing somebody comes
and tells you,

00:38:08.358 --> 00:38:12.965
‘All right, I’ll make you something
special, and for that this is to be done.’

00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:15.535
It has happened before with your leaders
also,

00:38:15.736 --> 00:38:19.623
that they used to tell them in their ears
that, ‘Mother has told me to do this.

00:38:19.824 --> 00:38:24.765
Mother has told me to do this.’ Never
listen to such people.

00:38:24.966 --> 00:38:30.606
You’ve got leaders whom you can ask
what is good and what is bad.

00:38:30.807 --> 00:38:34.522
If not, you can even write to Me, but
don’t listen to such people

00:38:34.723 --> 00:38:39.491
who are telling you things just
to destroy –

00:38:39.692 --> 00:38:45.266
destroy Sahaja Yoga, destroy the only hope
for the whole world.

00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:51.627
You have to be very, very careful about it.
And if you are careful, I am sure,

00:38:51.828 --> 00:38:54.702
you have now the insight, you have now
the powers,

00:38:54.903 --> 00:38:59.387
you have now the authority. Everything
is there, no doubt,

00:38:59.588 --> 00:39:07.232
but vulnerability is the problem
I sometimes feel.

00:39:07.767 --> 00:39:13.406
For that you have to be very, very careful
because now, as you see in Sydney,

00:39:13.607 --> 00:39:19.799
it started in a very bad way, and now we
are so many sensible people sitting here

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.466
who are My children of whom I’m very
proud, very proud.

00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:30.820
But, at the same time, please try
to understand

00:39:31.029 --> 00:39:34.039
that you are surrounded by vultures
actually,

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.489
the whole atmosphere is full of such things
because I see your newspapers,

00:39:38.705 --> 00:39:43.584
I see your media and I am really shocked.

00:39:43.785 --> 00:39:48.780
Is much worse than you could see in India,

00:39:48.981 --> 00:39:51.016
though in India also these things have
come now.

00:39:51.217 --> 00:39:55.564
The Western life is coming there and many
people are taking to it, no doubt,

00:39:55.765 --> 00:39:59.812
but only in big cities and very few people
who’re supposed to be

00:40:00.013 --> 00:40:03.733
very rich or elite, they try to do
all this.

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:07.768
This will all go away, I’m sure, one day.

00:40:07.969 --> 00:40:11.860
Then another point is, apart from your
family, your children,

00:40:12.061 --> 00:40:16.467
where normally people are glued into,
you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:16.668 --> 00:40:21.729
You are not only for your family, for your
country, but for the whole world.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.636
Then attention should be on all such
things.

00:40:24.837 --> 00:40:33.810
For example, I read about what is happening
in Johannesburg or in Natal

00:40:34.011 --> 00:40:39.215
and how the people are massacred there
and what they are doing there.

00:40:39.416 --> 00:40:43.036
I was very disturbed, couldn’t sleep –
very disturbed –

00:40:43.237 --> 00:40:48.857
and I decided this year I must go
to South Africa.

00:40:59.103 --> 00:41:03.206
Also Yugoslav is another problem

00:41:03.407 --> 00:41:07.488
where these stupid Muslims are killing
themselves.

00:41:07.689 --> 00:41:15.321
All their funny ideas are working out
in such a disastrous way

00:41:15.529 --> 00:41:18.305
that they must die now in the name of God,

00:41:18.506 --> 00:41:23.753
so after the Qiyamah comes in,
the Resurrection time comes in,

00:41:23.954 --> 00:41:27.503
they’ll come out of their graves and
they’ll get Resurrection.

00:41:27.704 --> 00:41:34.389
Such stupid ideas are also for Christians,
for Muslims and also for Jews.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.688
Now, imagine those who died five
hundred years back,

00:41:36.889 --> 00:41:40.532
what will come out of their graves?

00:41:42.001 --> 00:41:46.013
But the sensible idea is from
Nal-Damayanti-akhyan

00:41:46.214 --> 00:41:53.673
that all the souls will be born again and
there will be population problem.

00:41:53.874 --> 00:41:57.929
But they’ll be born again, souls will take
forms

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:02.524
and they will seek their Realization and
many will get Realization,

00:42:02.725 --> 00:42:08.591
which is a very sensible thing to say that
the souls, not the body, from the graves.

00:42:08.792 --> 00:42:13.048
And that’s why they were occupying such
a lot of land all over,

00:42:13.249 --> 00:42:23.185
that in Spain, what they do is to put
the dead bodies in rocks like this.

00:42:23.386 --> 00:42:27.526
They cut a piece and push it there,
one after another.

00:42:27.727 --> 00:42:32.940
They go on pushing all these coffins inside
a rock like that, all over.

00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:37.798
I was wondering what is this made like
this, like a drawers, you know.

00:42:37.999 --> 00:42:40.492
In these drawers they put it and they
push it in.

00:42:40.693 --> 00:42:43.317
They are all there and they are all going
to come out

00:42:43.518 --> 00:42:45.719
when there will be Resurrection time

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.725
and all of them are going to get their
Realization.

00:42:51.916 --> 00:42:55.781
That’s why these people, Muslims
[in Hindi “everywhere”],

00:42:55.982 --> 00:42:59.681
or you can call it the Yugoslav,
Yugoslavia,

00:42:59.957 --> 00:43:04.045
they are killing themselves, stupidly.

00:43:04.505 --> 00:43:08.059
Also they have no wisdom to see that
this is wrong.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:13.842
How can it be that our dead bodies will
come out?

00:43:15.145 --> 00:43:19.413
[Mother speak aside: “There’s a ship coming
and the children are –

00:43:24.452 --> 00:43:32.931
so very sweet, ah, really. They are
for private owners, or…

00:43:36.035 --> 00:43:43.495
Very sweet. It just crawls or…
in the water?”].

00:43:51.567 --> 00:43:55.701
So now our attention should be global.

00:43:55.902 --> 00:43:58.674
If Sahaja Yogis put their attentions,
you see, global,

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:03.420
you don’t know your powers, how
important it is.

00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:06.973
Just put your attention now, say,
to South Africa,

00:44:07.174 --> 00:44:15.618
what the Natal, where they are having
all these problems of suppression.

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:18.214
It will help, very much help, you don’t
know.

00:44:18.415 --> 00:44:23.511
Things will subside, because through you
this all-pervading power,

00:44:23.712 --> 00:44:31.527
Paramchaitanya, will focus itself there.
You are the one who can focus.

00:44:31.728 --> 00:44:35.687
You should have your global attention there

00:44:35.895 --> 00:44:40.089
and you should see for yourself where
is serious problem.

00:44:40.298 --> 00:44:43.386
I’m doing on My Own whatever is possible.

00:44:43.587 --> 00:44:48.066
For that you must read newspapers, but
not all the nonsense of the newspaper,

00:44:48.267 --> 00:44:50.973
but see where is the problem is, what
is happening.

00:44:51.181 --> 00:44:57.107
Because you are in Sydney, but you are
responsible for the whole world.

00:44:57.308 --> 00:45:00.992
Wherever you are, you are responsible
for the whole world.

00:45:01.193 --> 00:45:04.545
Now there’s a very good thing that has
happened in Russia.

00:45:04.746 --> 00:45:09.084
I don’t know if you have that paper
with you? Russian paper?

00:45:09.285 --> 00:45:11.977
Yogi: No.
Shri Mataji: No.

00:45:12.178 --> 00:45:14.443
Yogi 2: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: You have that?

00:45:14.644 --> 00:45:19.036
Yogi 3: Yes, we’ve got this. Yes,
Shri Mataji.

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:22.680
Yogi 4: Jai Shri Mataji.

00:45:23.244 --> 00:45:28.965
Shri Mataji: And see, the Russian
University of St. Petersburg

00:45:29.166 --> 00:45:33.243
which is the oldest in Asia, perhaps
oldest in the whole world,

00:45:33.444 --> 00:45:41.882
has got now only ten people as member
of their Academy

00:45:42.083 --> 00:45:47.181
and one of them is Me, I’m surprised.
So -

00:45:51.142 --> 00:45:55.987
So when they applied – you see, they
applied for My membership,

00:45:56.188 --> 00:46:01.269
they wrote – I can’t read it, it’s too much
for Me.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:05.839
They wrote, you see, this application

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:12.654
and why, I mean, saying that I should be
appointed as one of the members.

00:46:12.855 --> 00:46:15.435
Einstein is one of the members, can
you imagine.

00:46:15.636 --> 00:46:20.138
I was surprised that they had put Me
with Einstein.

00:46:20.339 --> 00:46:23.683
And I was quite ashamed, though it
was done.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:27.621
So they said, ‘What? What is Einstein?
What has he done?

00:46:27.822 --> 00:46:30.569
He is just working with the matter,

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.555
You have worked with human beings,
You see.’

00:46:33.756 --> 00:46:39.311
So, can you read it out?
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.485
Shri Mataji: Just see their attention.

00:46:47.686 --> 00:46:53.881
I mean, this is the vice-president of that
Academy who applied for Me.

00:46:54.082 --> 00:46:58.311
I think you talk on this, and will be
better.

00:47:00.798 --> 00:47:04.317
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, shall I read
the whole of it? That’s the whole…

00:47:04.518 --> 00:47:09.166
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. Read how they
had applied. Yes.

00:47:09.367 --> 00:47:13.581
They’ll be happy to know about their
Mother also.

00:47:19.556 --> 00:47:22.570
[A yogi reads the letter:]

00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:30.050
‘This is addressed to the Presidium
of Peter’s Academy of Arts and Sciences.

00:47:30.251 --> 00:47:34.174
It’s the official presentation
of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:47:34.375 --> 00:47:41.107
for election as an Honored Member
of the Academy.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:48.769
Mrs. Nirmala Shrivastava, Doctor
of Philosophy and Medicine,

00:47:50.804 --> 00:47:56.785
a Distinguished Authority on the fields
of Religion, Philosophy and Science,

00:47:56.986 --> 00:48:01.204
by Her noble activity does very much
to promote happiness

00:48:01.405 --> 00:48:07.852
and friendship of Indian and Russian
peoples and all the nations of the world.

00:48:08.054 --> 00:48:10.199
She was always regarding our land
as a center

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.991
of the world’s spirituality and morality,

00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:19.228
center of rapprochement, people
of West and Orient,

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:23.027
the centre of the revival of sublime
ideals

00:48:23.228 --> 00:48:30.375
which have been put forth by Russians
and many other nations of Russia.

00:48:30.916 --> 00:48:36.460
Being the founder of the elevating teaching
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:48:36.661 --> 00:48:41.412
Mrs. Nirmala Devi Shrivastava

00:48:41.613 --> 00:48:48.280
absolutely reliably connects physical
and psychic health of a man

00:48:48.481 --> 00:48:53.099
with the mode of his life and morality.

00:48:54.223 --> 00:48:58.528
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi was born in 1923

00:48:58.729 --> 00:49:05.054
on the 23rd of March [Shri Mataji:
“That’s wrong”] in Chindwara,

00:49:05.255 --> 00:49:12.121
central part of India in a noble Christian
family.

00:49:12.322 --> 00:49:17.215
Having revealed Her extraordinary abilities
already in childhood,

00:49:17.416 --> 00:49:21.428
later She got the high medical education

00:49:21.636 --> 00:49:29.343
and took an active part in the struggle
for the National Independence of India.

00:49:29.675 --> 00:49:40.172
In 1947 She married Mr. Shrivastava
and now they have two daughters.

00:49:40.716 --> 00:49:50.035
Sir C.P. Shrivastava for sixteen years
occupied the post of General Secretary

00:49:50.236 --> 00:49:57.733
of the International Naval Organization
of the United Nations,

00:49:57.934 --> 00:50:03.330
having been unanimously elected for this
post three times in succession,

00:50:03.531 --> 00:50:09.374
now he is the honored General Secretary
of this agency.

00:50:10.517 --> 00:50:13.484
During the elections to the Prime Minister
of India,

00:50:13.685 --> 00:50:19.178
Sir Shrivastava held office of General
Secretary.

00:50:19.379 --> 00:50:26.415
He was rewarded by thirty-four awards
of different countries.

00:50:26.616 --> 00:50:30.267
The Queen of England marked his retirement,
granting him honorary title

00:50:30.468 --> 00:50:37.026
of Knight-Commander of the Order
of Saint Michael and Saint George.

00:50:37.548 --> 00:50:42.432
Mrs. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi and Mr. C.P.
Shrivastava,

00:50:42.633 --> 00:50:46.906
considering the Russian people to be
spiritual and pure,

00:50:47.107 --> 00:50:53.310
see in our Motherland the center
of spiritual revival of the world.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:58.385
Being absolutely sincere from the bottom
of my heart,

00:50:58.586 --> 00:51:03.963
I recommend to the Presidium of Peter’s
Academy of Arts and Sciences

00:51:04.164 --> 00:51:12.589
to elect Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi to be
an Honored Member of our Academy.’

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:20.539
“And this was spoken by the Vice-President
of Peter’s Academy of Arts and Sciences,

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:26.591
Mr. Voronov.”
Shri Mataji: Very nice man.

00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:30.048
Sahaja Yogi: Jai Shri Mataji!

00:51:45.103 --> 00:51:48.417
Shri Mataji: He even came to My Puja.
Can you imagine?

00:51:48.618 --> 00:51:56.116
He did the Puja and gave Me some very
nice present also;

00:51:56.317 --> 00:52:04.947
and I told him that I have never graduated
in science or philosophy or anything,

00:52:05.148 --> 00:52:07.682
so he said, ‘That’s why You are so great.’
I said, “Why?”

00:52:07.883 --> 00:52:14.411
Because none of the discoverers have
ever been to colleges, or university.’

00:52:14.612 --> 00:52:21.181
Very nice person, very nice and he is
willing to come to India any time you want.

00:52:21.382 --> 00:52:24.361
Then I met another personality

00:52:24.562 --> 00:52:30.260
who is called as Ayatollah, means person
in charge of Religion.

00:52:30.461 --> 00:52:33.953
His name was Rohani Ayatollah

00:52:34.154 --> 00:52:38.253
and Rohani Ayatollah is a gentleman –
Ruhani.

00:52:38.454 --> 00:52:42.081
“Ruha” means this all-pervading power
or spiritual.

00:52:42.282 --> 00:52:50.274
So he was in charge of Religion when the –
there was this rule of the King

00:52:50.475 --> 00:52:53.477
and afterwards he had to run away from
there

00:52:53.678 --> 00:52:58.037
and he came to Paris and settled down
there.

00:52:58.238 --> 00:53:07.238
Now, his younger brother is also an Irani,

00:53:07.439 --> 00:53:13.753
is voted for becoming the new President
of Iran.

00:53:13.954 --> 00:53:17.585
So this old one, the one who is a very
strict

00:53:17.786 --> 00:53:24.540
and, you can say, a very fundamentalist
type,

00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:28.691
he arrested those six families which
supported him

00:53:28.892 --> 00:53:35.266
and took a affidavit from them saying that
‘No, they are not going to support him.’

00:53:35.467 --> 00:53:42.377
But, if you all put your attention to it,
he might be, he might be elected.

00:53:42.578 --> 00:53:46.485
And if he is elected that’s the saving
of the Muslims there

00:53:46.686 --> 00:53:52.387
because they are Shia people and this
Rohani gentleman is so wonderful.

00:53:52.588 --> 00:53:56.838
He touched My Feet and he danced when
he got his Realization.

00:53:57.039 --> 00:54:02.311
I mean, some things are happening which
are so much of a joy.

00:54:02.512 --> 00:54:08.785
Even in My country I find – India – that
there’s a big recognition of Sahaja Yoga

00:54:08.986 --> 00:54:14.943
and which is so obvious that people
are recognizing

00:54:15.144 --> 00:54:18.645
the purity of Sahaj Yoga.

00:54:18.846 --> 00:54:22.943
Let us see how far we can go.

00:54:23.144 --> 00:54:31.113
But in Brazil also they have – the President
of the Senate called Me,

00:54:31.314 --> 00:54:34.576
got his Realization, he was very happy.
He called his secretary, everybody,

00:54:34.777 --> 00:54:36.513
asked them to get their Realization.

00:54:36.714 --> 00:54:42.264
And then they sent – you see, they said
that Brasilia is that they have selected,

00:54:42.465 --> 00:54:51.533
is the one is depicted by some philosophers
as the center of spirituality.

00:54:51.734 --> 00:54:55.197
And when they came,

00:54:58.619 --> 00:55:03.592
he called all other people also and their
Vice-President was there.

00:55:03.793 --> 00:55:06.461
The President was already impeached.

00:55:06.662 --> 00:55:11.225
So this Vice-President, I never liked him.
I said, “Funny person he is.”

00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:14.204
And then he was arrested.

00:55:14.405 --> 00:55:18.463
So, so many things – like Italy also –
lots of things are happening.

00:55:18.664 --> 00:55:26.698
Maybe all this might just change
the atmosphere.

00:55:26.899 --> 00:55:32.820
You know about Marcus who was in Vienna,

00:55:33.021 --> 00:55:37.931
who troubled us so much, did so much
against us in the newspaper and all that?

00:55:38.132 --> 00:55:43.978
This Marcus fellow, I don’t know what has
gone wrong with him or he’s come round.

00:55:44.179 --> 00:55:47.382
Now, he’s saying that you can live in this
Ashram for two years

00:55:47.583 --> 00:55:52.658
without paying any rent. I’ll also give
you money that you can purchase a land.

00:55:52.859 --> 00:55:54.853
Afterwards, you can leave the house.

00:55:55.054 --> 00:55:58.402
And he says, ‘The maya was too much
for me and I got lost.

00:55:58.603 --> 00:56:04.580
I’ll be back again in Ganapatipule.’
Can you imagine?

00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:17.115
So all such things are happening and
it’s tremendous

00:56:17.316 --> 00:56:23.167
because you can’t expect a person like
Marcus coming around like that, you see.

00:56:23.368 --> 00:56:30.151
So Sahaja Yoga is showing its own
success and you all can add to it.

00:56:30.352 --> 00:56:32.878
You have seen among, among yourselves only,

00:56:33.079 --> 00:56:37.949
there are so many beautiful people
who come out of lot of troubles.

00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:43.148
All troubles can be overcome. There’s
no problem about it.

00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:48.430
Only thing, one has to be sincere and
attached to Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:48.631 --> 00:56:52.816
You may be a family man, you might be
a father, mother, anything,

00:56:53.017 --> 00:56:56.431
but first and foremost thing, you are
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:56:56.632 --> 00:56:59.355
I tell you about Myself also.

00:56:59.556 --> 00:57:04.811
You know I have a family. I have My
husband and all that,

00:57:05.696 --> 00:57:13.457
and whenever, you see, it was needed,
I always said, “Sahaja Yoga first.”

00:57:13.658 --> 00:57:16.543
Even money-wise, I would say that, if you
have to spend any money,

00:57:16.744 --> 00:57:23.006
then spend on Sahaj Yoga. So the first
thing was Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:23.207 --> 00:57:26.267
All these are secondary, all your art,
all your business,

00:57:26.468 --> 00:57:34.020
all your music or whatever line of life
you take, is a secondary.

00:57:34.221 --> 00:57:39.380
The first and foremost thing is Sahaja
Yoga. And you get in that everything.

00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:43.621
But you should do it very sincerely,
respectfully.

00:57:43.822 --> 00:57:49.091
If you think you are not in it, then you
better understand

00:57:49.292 --> 00:57:51.979
that if you are not in it, you cannot be
there.

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.527
You have to be fully into it, you see.

00:57:54.728 --> 00:57:58.938
So either you are in the sea or you are
outside. It’s like that.

00:57:59.139 --> 00:58:05.588
And this will give you the greatest
pleasure, the greatest fulfillment of life.

00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:08.842
I can see that’s happening now and I’m
very happy

00:58:09.043 --> 00:58:11.366
and, as I said, I’m very proud of you.

00:58:11.567 --> 00:58:16.440
It should happen everywhere, and with
all My love I bless you

00:58:16.641 --> 00:58:20.031
that you all should really become great
Sahaja Yogis,

00:58:20.232 --> 00:58:24.889
very, very great Sahaja Yogis and you’ll
be all known all over the world.

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:28.262
May God bless you.
