00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.280
Today you all have gathered here

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.720
to do the Guru Puja.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.160
Your Guru is a Mother first and then a Guru

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.400
and that has given Me a greater help.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.800
We have had before also many Guru Pujas,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.560
mostly in England.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.600
And you should wonder why

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.600
Mother always somehow is doing Guru Puja in London.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.080
The time falls in such a way that it is in Guru Puja,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.120
I am here, during that time I have to be in London.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.040
So many years we have been doing Guru Puja in England.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.360
All things happen if according to ritambhara pragya

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.480
then there must be some reason

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.560
why Mother is here in England for a Guru Puja.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.880
It is stated in the Puranas that

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.520
the Adi Guru Datattreya

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.880
worshipped Mother

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.880
along the banks of the river Tamasa.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.280
Tamasa is the same as your Thames

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.880
and He himself came and worshipped here.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.200
And the druids, those who had

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.160
the manifestation of the Stonehenge and all that,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.640
are originated from that time in this great country of Shiva,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.640
of the Spirit.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.520
So the Spirit resides here as in the heart of human beings,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.320
and the Sahasrara

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.440
is in the Himalayas where Sadashiva exists at the Kailasha.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.320
This is the great secret

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.040
of we having so many Guru Pujas here.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.320
To culminate it today and to this special type of Guru Puja

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.480
in the year of the sixtieth birthday of your Mother

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.920
is, has a special, very, very special significance

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.360
because is the Guru Sashti -

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.440
is the sixty years of your Guru has been celebrated today.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.800
And that's how it's a very big occasion that you all have gathered

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.280
under the influence of again ritambhara pragya.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.720
So all that has happened has happened by the nature's own gift to you

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.600
and everything has worked out so well

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.120
because that was the desire of the Divine

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.360
and the design of the Divine.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.000
So the river Thames, which we call Her as Thames -

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.320
you see, English have a method of making everything English.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.880
Like Bombay they made it - Mumbai was Bombay,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.280
you see, like Calcutta, like all other words just like that.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.200
Like Varanasi was made into Benares,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.080
River Thames which was really Tamsa was called as Thames.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.600
Now from the name Tamsa one should know

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.680
that is a place of Tamo Guna.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.520
Is a place where left-sided resided since long.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.200
So people were very worshipful, left-sided people, emotional type,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.440
and they worshipped God more

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.440
than that they went into yagyas and all that.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.160
And Datattreya lived here

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.040
and meditated on the banks of River Thames.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.040
That's why Guru puja here has to give us a great background

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.200
for your awakening of the Guru Principle.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.960
We have to go to the roots of everything

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.000
so that we understand the importance of it.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.400
Unless and until you know the roots and the traditions behind

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.800
you cannot understand the depth,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.600
the gravity, the intensity of any puja.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.080
Today we have gathered here to do the Guru Puja, again.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.240
The reason is we have got a Guru Principle within ourselves

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.240
as I told you last time

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.280
and also I have given elaborately

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.640
the Ten Commandments as expressed within us

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.120
which are describing the different

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.440
the different types of essences within us.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.400
The essence of Guru Puja has to be awakened within us.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.480
That's how we are having this program here.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.720
Now it is important

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.040
that we have to establish

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.320
the dharma within us.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.920
Without the dharma you cannot have the ascent.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.000
And as I have told you before that the cleanliness

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.160
of your being

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.320
depends on how much dharma you follow, religiously.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.280
At the time of Moses

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.600
it was worked out

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.360
and all the rules and regulations

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.880
were created for realized souls.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.480
But as I read in one of the books - it was very good,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.360
because if I had said this, people would not have believed -

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.200
that it had to be changed.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.640
I think during the speech the children should not be here,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.560
it's better to take them out.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.600
After the speech you can bring them along - those who make noises.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880
Those who are quiet it's all right,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.240
but those who are making noises you better bring them out.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.600
If they are going to make noises, better to be out or near the door

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.160
so that if they make noises you can get out,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.640
so there is no disturbance.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.920
And during the puja is all right, you could be at the gate,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.600
door or some place from where you can go.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.600
So the laws and regulations that were given to human beings

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.640
were actually for the realized souls who would understand.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.800
But when Moses must have discovered the way human beings are,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.080
He must have changed them to very strict rules,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.000
because with human beings as they are,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.560
one has to be extremely strict.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.400
They can't understand anything but fear.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.280
If you have

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.760
a stick in your hand, you can put them right.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.400
Without that stick human beings won't listen.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.320
They are only all right if there's a fear.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.440
Now if you see

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.000
the today condition of all the nations,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.880
those who are having leaders, or prime ministers, or presidents

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.280
they are all people extremely strict,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.920
very dominating and very dry.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.720
And normally people like such people.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.240
Even Hitler succeeded because of that nature.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.120
So the character of a guru so far

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.320
has been of a very strict nature

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.840
for people who are not realized.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.200
Normally a guru doesn't - a good guru, Satguru,

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.400
He doesn't like to talk to people much.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.720
They throw stones

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.520
or they don't like to talk to people

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.040
who are not realized.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.600
But if they are realized then these Gurus change their attitude

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.400
towards the people who want to see them.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.320
There is a tremendous difference

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.760
between a person who is a realized and non-realized

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.240
in the protocol of God.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.600
A man may be the king or anything, he'll be asked to sit outside.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.960
It has nothing to do with what position you enjoy.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.400
As long as he is a realized soul and not possessed

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.160
he is given the highest position.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.120
But if you are possessed then also the Guru will tell him

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.640
that "You get out from here,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.840
first get rid of your possession and then come."

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.920
And all these strict rules were there,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.800
that such and such person must be killed,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.400
such and such person must be given a punishment

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.800
of cutting the hands, cutting the feet,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.240
even absolutely destroying the eyes.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.120
This was done because they were not realized souls.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.320
It was the great realization of Moses, I think,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.320
that He took to another kind of law which is known as Sharia now

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.600
and that's what the Muslims are following.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.520
In a way it's good I think,

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.040
because people who are now normal people really deserve such a rule,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.480
but it should not be so fanatical that you cannot discriminate

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.480
between a realized soul and a non-realized soul.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.080
Now the Guru within you

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.480
will be awakened if you are strict with yourself.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.680
That's one point is very important.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.280
Unless and until you are strict with yourself

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.040
the Guru will not be awakened within you.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.640
People who are lazy lumps, who cannot sacrifice anything,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.960
who are very fond of comfort can never be gurus, take it from Me.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.000
They can be good administrators, they can be anything,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.640
but never a guru.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.240
A guru should be willing to live the way he has to live.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.320
He should be able to sleep on stones,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.360
he should be able to sleep under any circumstances.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.920
Not that the disciple should force on him,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.240
but it should be his own nature, that he can adjust himself.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.360
Comfort cannot crawl on a guru.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.840
Now those who want your Guru Principle to be awakened

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.240
must know that you should not ask for comfort.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.760
Even for a thing like that, yesterday you saw the dancing,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.560
one has to do real tapasya.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.800
Intensive tapasya you have to do,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.600
you cannot learn even a thing like dancing

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.800
without going into a penance about it.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.080
So a guru has to go through all penances is important.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.280
Sahaja Yogi need not go, but a guru Sahaja Yogi has to do it.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.600
We have to have penances,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.040
and the penance can be any kind of desire you have.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.640
Say, supposing you are very fond of food,

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.680
just don't eat the food that you want to eat.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.280
If you are very fond of sweet food,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.440
then eat something very bitter, raised to power hundred and eight.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:09.120
And if you are fond of some sort of a very ...

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.080
- as Indians are, sometimes -

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.560
... very spicy food then eat so bland the food, without salt.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.280
Teach your tongue to behave itself.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.720
It doesn't behoove a guru to put his attention to food.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.800
I have seen some of the Sahaja Yogis, they are all right

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.480
when the food is there, quite concentrated,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.160
but when it comes to the programme they have no concentration.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.600
Such a sad thing, such people cannot be gurus. They can be cooks, good,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.520
or could be food-tasters or something like that.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.080
Will suit them better, but if they have to be gurus

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.800
they must learn to control their tongue and their desires.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.600
I mean, fasting is a good thing for such people, fasting is very good.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.360
All the time they are worried, what are we going to have for lunch,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.360
what are we going to have for dinner?

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.600
Such people cannot have their Guru Principle awakened,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.080
neither they can be gurus. So please be careful.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.160
The guru must have control over the tongue.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.440
He must know when to get angry

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.120
and when to be gentle.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.840
He must know what to say when,

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.760
how much to say.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.640
That's why many gurus have been more effective by not speaking.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.560
Silence is the best way you can help others,

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.600
but when it comes to explaining Sahaja Yoga, you should speak.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.760
But I have seen with some people they are very eloquent

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.200
when it comes to nonsensical things,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.360
but when it comes to Sahaja Yoga, they don't know anything

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.080
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.880
So you have to be the master of Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.680
if you have to be a Guru,

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.440
not only in talking, but in your behaviour, in everything.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.480
And the karamat

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.760
is the ...

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.360
I don't know if you use charismatic-word, charismatic they call it

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.320
or you say, the one how to do it

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.400
how to raise the Kundalini, how to put it at the Sahasrara,

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.800
how to break the Sahasrara, all these things you must know,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.680
how to spend your knowledge is viniyoga in Sanskrit.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.640
Guru principle is awakened in a person

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.920
when he himself has achieved something.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.320
Imagine a half-baked guru going along talking as a Guru.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.040
He'll end up as a disciple ultimately.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.960
So you have to be master of your own,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.520
but when the Guru Principle comes in

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.520
you have to give it to others,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.640
it's a question of giving it to others.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.360
So you have to be at a higher level to give it to others,

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.040
have to be at a very high level.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.600
If you are attached to money, if you are attached to food,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.240
if you are attached to mundane things of life, you cannot give.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.600
Now the higher state than that can be achieved,

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.240
which is naturally in Me, but can be achieved,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.400
is that you don't have to have any dependence like that,

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.920
that any rules and regulations,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.600
like saying that I will have no worry about food,

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.520
I should fast, this, that -

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.440
it all ends up. When you eat but don't eat,

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.680
that's the state one should have,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.400
that you are eating the food

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.800
and if you ask, "Did you have your lunch?"

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.800
"I don't know ..."

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.160
"Will you have your lunch?"

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.960
"I don't know ..."

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:18.160
Absolutely indifferent to the problems of the body.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.200
"Where did you sleep?"

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.320
"I don't know ..."

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.680
"What did you eat, what will you have?"

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.560
"I don't know ..."

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.320
This kind of a state is called ateeta state where you go beyond

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.520
and whatever you do, you are doing it

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.440
because it is to be done. Without paying any attention to it,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.040
is automatic.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.840
Nothing is important, but this is -

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.240
before becoming ateeta you have to steady yourself,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.440
"Nothing is important," you see, is a, avir bhava

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.000
they call it, is a kind of a drama you have to put in.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.080
"Oh, nothing is important, this carpet is not important,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.920
I should try to sleep on the cement."

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.600
First you have to do that.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.480
But after some time it happens

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.320
that you don't remember whether you slept on the cement

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.600
or on a cot, "Where did I sleep? I don't know."

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.000
That is the ateeta state.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.320
And that state is to be achieved now by many Sahaja Yogis-

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.760
in a state where you go beyond.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.520
Say there is somebody who is before you and you have to get angry.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.040
All right, you give them left, right, left, right nicely

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.040
and then you are smiling next moment.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.920
Did you get angry with that person? "I don't know, did I?"

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.680
Like Buddha once said something

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.080
in one village

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.080
and there was a horrible fellow who got up

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.960
and said lots of things to him.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.720
And when He went to the next village the fellow felt

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.760
that "Oh, I should not have done that," Left Vishuddi, perhaps.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.040
So he went down and said, "I am sorry Sir, I have said so

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.800
and I should not have said it,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.560
I didn't know You are the enlightened one,

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.280
so it happened, so forgive me."

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.200
He said "When, where did you say?"

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.160
He said, "In the last village."

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.600
"Oh, everything in the last village I have left there alone

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.640
I don't take with me."

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.400
That is the ateeta state that you have to reach.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.160
So even not to feel, it's not important.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.840
These identifications when they drop out completely

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.800
then you are doing things in akarma state,

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:59.400
where, like sun is shining it doesn't know it is shining.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.680
When the vibrations are flowing you don't know it is flowing.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.240
Already it has started working in you.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.800
You are surprised, you raise the hands and the Kundalini is rising.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.000
You don't know you are raising the Kundalini actually.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.840
How do you raise it?

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.240
You don't know, that's it.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.360
That state has already started ateeta in you,

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.200
but get it established in every walk of life,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.080
everything, that you go beyond.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.120
And if you can manage that,

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.320
that's the highest that you have to reach.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.960
Now with the incarnations it's very different,

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.200
it's the other way round.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.840
Everything is the other way round.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.960
They don't have to do any tapasya.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.520
They don't have to starve, they don't have to cleanse themselves,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.480
whatever they do is the punya.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.120
They don't have to collect punyas either.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.960
If they kill somebody it is dharma.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.320
If they hit somebody it is the dharma.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.040
Nothing they do wrong.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.240
They are absolutely immaculate.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.760
If they deceive someone, they cheat someone,

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.280
it's perfectly all right.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:35.080
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goals.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.160
It's justified in our day-to-day life you'll see,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.960
that when you are defending your country,

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.280
there is an enemy on you, if you have to defend your country

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.880
you can slay him.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.840
You can cheat him, diplomatically you can befool him.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.680
Is allowed, why?

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.120
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goal.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.880
But for an incarnation it is always the higher goal.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.280
He is not bothered about smaller goals at all.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.040
He doesn't have to weigh, think, rationalize

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.680
or to train himself or do some drama or anything, it's all done.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.520
Even the movement, every movement, every movement of an incarnation

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.720
has a ripple in it, which is for the good.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.960
There is nothing, not even a moment is such

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.640
which is not for the good of the world.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.240
So the incarnation is a very different thing,

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.640
that is not to be achieved, that has to be.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.880
Now for example

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.040
the incarnation is the bhokta, is the enjoyer,

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.160
He is the enjoyer of everything.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.320
Many people, say, have created,

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.200
now we have a carpet here from Turkey.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.080
These carpets were created by Turkish peoples

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.320
some time back for an incarnation to sit.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.480
So the ritambhara pragya will bring it round in such a way

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.240
that at least I see it,

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.000
or I have it,

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.800
so that their souls will be blessed,

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.520
so that they feel nice.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.200
Like Michelangelo has made that not for popes, I can tell you.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.640
and not for all the rubbish people who go there.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.320
Neither Blake did all that work

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.160
for the useless people who want to go and see nude artists.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.360
It was all done for the incarnation to see.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.520
That's the way they have blessed the most,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.720
because they are beyond, nothing touches them, nothing is important,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.640
but it's not rational or anything that they have trained themselves,

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.640
but it is automatically they have.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.040
Like Shri Krishna had to marry sixteen thousand women.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.400
Can you imagine?

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:10.880
In those days of monogamy he would be prosecuted hundred times.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.240
The reason was he has sixteen thousand powers

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.000
and He was to be born

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.560
with those sixteen thousand powers on this Earth

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:28.200
and five elements became His queens.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:37.200
He had to do some justification to have them around.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.960
And as I have now Sahaja Yogis whom I have,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.040
I mean, given Realization.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.440
So automatically I am your Mother, is established.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.480
But for Him there was no way out

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.400
but to marry His sixteen thousand powers.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.720
And so He married, but He was never married,

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.800
He was a bachelor out and out all His life.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.920
Because He is Yogeshwara and He is a brahmacharya.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.600
Who can marry ... Him?

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.880
So for Them all these worldly things are just a drama,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.120
has no meaning at all.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.720
It's just a drama.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.120
A person

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:40.400
who is not an incarnation should not try to be.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.960
That's not the right of a human being.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.640
Like a policeman standing on the road,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.200
if he puts his hands right, left - we follow it.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.720
But you ask some mad man to go and stand there, he will be arrested.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.480
So for normal people, even you are a guru

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.360
you shouldn't allow them to touch your feet.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.400
Only an incarnation's feet must be touched

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.120
and nobody else's feet must be touched.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.120
Of course in samayachara

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.400
like as we have in India the custom to touch the feet of the father,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.560
but because the father is a representative of the father

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.040
in you, that's why - or the mother.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.240
But that's symbolic,

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.920
but in reality you are not to surrender yourself to anybody else,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.280
but to an incarnation.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.240
Also if there's a teacher in your,

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.480
any art or in anyway the master, you must touch his feet.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.840
Even to take his name you have to pull your ears.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.600
But nobody

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.960
who is a human being should make touch your feet,

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.720
especially the Sahaja Yogis should not.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.200
Nobody should ask anyone to touch your feet.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.360
As an elder you may,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.840
that's a different point, but not as a guru.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.320
Is a very dangerous thing,

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.360
once you start it, you know what it happens, with so many,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.880
they have just gone out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.640
So to develop the Guru Principle within you

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:33.760
first of all you must develop yourself, fully.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.480
Now how to develop yourself a Guru Principle, one must see.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.960
We have got the ten principles within you, as I told you before

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.760
and we should develop these all ten principles in such a way,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.640
that we stand out from others.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.920
Yesterday as I told you that when we do dhyana-dharana-samadhi

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.640
and achieve the blessings of the ritambhara pragya,

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.360
then put that whole thing

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.960
onto different areas

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.120
as called as desh or bhoomi.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.440
How you spend them is the point - is through mantras,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.320
cleanse it through mantras,

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.880
cleanse it through your attention,

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.120
every day you must know which chakra to be cleared out.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.960
You must know about yourself, where is the problem,

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.840
how it is to be cleansed,

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.960
how we have to clear it out.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.400
Do not take it for granted.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.960
Many people who have got, say, left-sided problem,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.160
you will just bring them lemon and chillis

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.160
and think that Mother has done the job.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.080
I can only do the job temporarily,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.480
but if there is a vacuum again you will suck in.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.360
You see ...

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:04.600
these vacuums within you feel hungry again to have some more.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.320
So to take out that vacuum is your job

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.040
and for that you have to religiously get

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.720
after all your defects.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:16.920
That's the most important thing for all of you.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.800
And try to put full attention to all these different deshas

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.160
- is the nations, they are called like this.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.040
And once you have cleared it,

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.240
it is enlightened, is full of light,

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.720
then you call it pradesh,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.920
means the desha has been enlightened.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.760
Once that has achieved

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.920
then you have reached the point you can become a guru,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.920
but still you are not a Satguru.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:56.160
To become the Satguru you must achieve the state of ateeta.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.040
The ateeta state is such

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:05.200
that the person who is not a good man will tremble before you.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.720
A man who is a liar,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.160
who has cheated others will lose his tongue.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.680
A man who has adulterous eyes,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:26.040
who is a man without, no control,

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.400
without any control over his mind

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.440
as far as the women are concerned or men are concerned,

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.080
such a person will have shaking in his eyes.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.120
Some of them will shake,

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.640
those who have been possessed will be shaking with it.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.040
They'll be all exposed before the light of a Sat Guru.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.640
When you achieve that you don't have to fight them,

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.400
they will themselves be exposed

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.640
and you won't have to do anything.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.840
One day I was told

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.440
that there is a servant, lady-servant

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.320
who is a very possessed person, in the family.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.160
So I said "Get rid of her."

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.280
I went to the airport. On My way I stopped at that house

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.440
and the maid-servant just walked in, you see

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.640
and there was a big gutter flowing,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.960
I mean not a gutter but a open sort of a thing

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.440
and she saw Me and she fell in that.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.520
I said, "Oh God,"

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.280
so I told the driver to take the car a little ahead.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.880
And she fell in. It happens.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.160
I was traveling by plane one day

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.440
and the gentleman in front started just jumping.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:50.680
So a Sahaja Yogi asked, "Are you from TM?" He said, "How do you know?"

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.480
He said, "We know." So I sat back.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.200
It may be they may all have ...

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.920
A day may come when they might start jumping like that.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.040
Or a pilot might start jumping.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.200
It's a big problem for Me.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:23.200
Even the lights ...

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.400
... you enter into a church

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.760
and suddenly you find all the lights going off like this.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.840
Even in big banquets, I find, when I am sitting there

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.560
and suddenly everybody comes and sit down

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.920
and all their bhoots come around,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.680
they start jumping and then people start looking, "What's happening,

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.760
is there a fire on?"

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.760
So many things can happen,

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.520
like there was a gentleman very much possessed in a war

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.360
and we were going to a ship

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.840
and there was a little  platform on which we had to first jump

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.320
and the platform started doing like this, like that

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.120
and the fellow didn't know what to do with it,

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.040
he didn't understand why it was doing this.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.560
So when you reach that state you don't have to argue or do anything,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.720
even if you lift your eye

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.600
it happens that the person gets into problems.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:25.040
Or there could be some ego-oriented people, they'll melt down.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.200
First you have to do the drama of a guru,

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.080
dress up in a way which is simple,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.840
you have to behave in a way which is very gentle,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.360
because you have to attract them.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.320
"Come along, come along, come along."

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.880
That's advertising, Advertising Department.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.440
And once it is done, that drama is done

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.880
it can be exposed very soon, if they will find out that you are not good,

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.120
you are just a dramatist.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.480
Once the drama has been done then

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.800
very cleverly you can bring out your real self before them.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.480
So first you don't show them that you are a real, hard taskmaster.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.400
Never.

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.320
First use all your sweet qualities.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.920
The more they are difficult the more I am gentle with them.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.520
Then they come inside.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.640
Then you put to the mill and you can cure them.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.560
First prepare them. First of all sometimes they are so frightened,

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.360
they are so nervous, they are so upset, sometimes too much of ego.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.880
So be gentle.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.760
Gradually they'll strengthen themselves also in your company

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.640
and then, even if you hit them they are all right.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.320
That's how it has to be done very cleverly.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.040
and if you see the way I manage My Gurudom

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.720
you can also manage.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.760
But the key to Guru is patience,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.520
a complete patience and complete dependence on God Almighty.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.640
That's the key, complete patience.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.640
First you tell them that this should be such,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.760
but they will not accept. They will argue -

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.320
how, why, this, that. All right, go ahead.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.800
Then they will come back with a black eye.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.960
Or they may come back with a punched nose.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.520
Then you say, "All right, I'll soothe it down." You soothe it down,

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.240
and then tell them.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:42.240
So is the wisdom, the discretion of Yogeshwara you should have.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.040
How to deal with people is very important,

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.440
why I say Yogeshwara.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:52.600
Because at the guru state you have to give it on a collective level.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.760
Individual level finishes and you jump into collective,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.720
once you start becoming a guru.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.440
So all these methods which I explained the other day to Modi,

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:16.120
you can understand that the ten of

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.280
your problems at the void

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.040
- once solved -

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.880
you solve the sixteen problems of the Vishuddhi.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.960
And once sixteen problems are crossed you come to Agnya.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.760
And at the Agnya Chakra

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.160
there is such a tremendous sacrifice

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:52.080
without feeling the sacrifice, is awaiting.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:59.000
And one has to see what you can sacrifice

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.600
in that ateeta state, because you don't sacrifice anything.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.880
Everything is already sacrificed, what is there to sacrifice?

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.640
And such a state should be achieved

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.280
by realizing that you are realized souls.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.600
You are not ordinary people

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.640
and you cannot have ordinary,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.360
mundane types

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.040
of rules and regulations.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.520
Like yama and nyama,

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.440
the nyamas are for yourself, yamas for others, nothing.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.120
There should be absolute truths with you.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.480
So much so that you should manifest them

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.440
and all these truths have powers.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:00.400
By every truth that is within you established,

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.160
you don't have to do anything, they work out themselves.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:10.640
So first of all you must get your chakras all right.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.840
On the chakras you must put your attention.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:20.200
After the samadhi state you will start opening them out properly.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.760
Clear them out. Know what are the chakras that are bad.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.680
I have seen people who have very bad few chakras

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.960
and many good chakras,

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.920
but they will be only enjoying the good chakras

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.000
and will not worry about the bad ones.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:37.760
Pay attention to your bad chakras, cleanse them, cleanse them.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.920
Put all your attention to that.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.760
Put the attention of the God,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.360
of the Deity whom you worship

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.200
and you'll get the ...

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.400
... complete manifestation of their power within yourself.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.040
So clear all the chakras,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.560
all the pradeshas to be established

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.680
and after the establishment of the pradeshas

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.080
you'll have to establish the rapport with others

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.240
on the collective level.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:26.760
Then a state when you become a complete spirit at the Agnya Chakra.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.880
It's a, easiest in Sahaja Yoga and I have told

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.680
you the reason, because you are such fortunate people.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.240
The easiest of easiest is Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.920
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is that it's the easiest thing to do.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:56.720
And that is why we should take full

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:02.080
advantage of that easiest method,

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.720
made easy, absolutely for you.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.440
This is the blessing of Guru Puja for you

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:18.640
that you all should become gurus by next year.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.680
Just you have to dedicate and say today in your heart,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.880
to promise Me in your heart that Mother, not we'll try but we will be

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:34.280
and thrice you should say, "We will be, we will be."

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.640
Now last of all I want to tell you

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.960
that now I have completed My sixtieth year

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:05.520
and no more celebrations of My birthday, this is the last.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.920
Please remember this.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.680
I have accepted whatever you said,

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.120
because of sixtieth birthday is very auspicious.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:18.160
After this no more celebration of My sixtieth birthday.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.240
You have already thought of giving Me some present

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.000
from all Europeans.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.400
On the sixtieth birthday I have accepted,

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:54.960
but no more of this kind of planning should be done anymore

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.320
for the sixtieth birthday, which is over now.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.960
I am telling you very frankly, all right?

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.560
So nobody is going to celebrate My sixtieth birthday anymore.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.040
I hope it's clear to you.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:20.960
So the protocol

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.920
of the Guru and the Mother

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:35.720
is to be understood in Sahaja Yoga mostly by experiencing it.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.800
But that doesn't mean

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:43.120
that you go out of the way to experience the other side of it.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.400
By being protocolish more and more

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:54.040
you will find you will receive much more help.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.160
Like Nick one day I told him, he will tell you that,

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.680
there were two ladies who wanted to go to Belgium.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.600
I told them they are going tomorrow.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.680
And the ladies said, "No, we are going today."

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.800
He said, "The Mother has said that you are going tomorrow,

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.440
so you go tomorrow, whatever it is."

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.760
They said, "No, we are going today.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.720
How is it Mother has said that we are going tomorrow?"

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.880
He said, "But She said it" -  they wouldn't listen.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.960
So we sent them to the airport

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.200
and they found they had to go next day.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.720
So that is how it is, that the protocol should be that,

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.800
"Yes, Mother has said it, doesn't matter.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.680
It may go wrong, doesn't matter.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.280
Whatever She says, let's obey and see."

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.200
By experiencing only you will know,

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.760
but in the beginning only you will say,

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.360
"No, we'll not do this and that," - it's not good.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:55.200
So the protocol is the simplest of simple to do,

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.240
So that's the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.080
the simplest of the simple is the protocol.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.560
If you understand the protocol

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.480
you don't have to do anything, you will grow by it automatically.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.720
But you lack in protocol and that's how you do not grow.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.160
This is the point is, that to grow best in Sahaja Yoga

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:22.040
is to know the protocol, which you can ask others.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.720
With experienced people you can ask,

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.160
or if you want to have your own experience you can have.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.200
But some people try the other way round, like answering Me back,

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.600
by saying all kinds of things

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:34.240
they think "Let's experiment what happens."

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.920
And then they break their necks and come to Me for curing.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.760
So that should not happen. Experience should be for betterment.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.880
And that's how if you can ask others, take their advice,

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:49.240
those people who are rising higher then normal,

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.200
what is the protocol?

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.560
And put your attention to it, how can you improve your protocol,

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.360
what should we do to observe protocol,

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.240
what wrong are we doing, where are we going wrong?

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:05.160
Because the essence of Sahaja Yoga today is the protocol,

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.920
which should be the simplest.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.840
Should be the simplest thing to do

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.160
and once you know the protocol that "If She has said it,

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.240
if it is meant, then it's all right."

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.600
But some people are so funny

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.720
that they start using Me as a quotation.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.920
"Mother has said everybody must fast."

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.080
I told somebody that "You'd better fast."

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.240
So a thin man comes next day fainting, I said, "What happened?"

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.200
When I say something to a particular person they just circulate it,

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.480
because they think, "Why should I fast alone, everybody must fast."

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.880
Is a big problem, that they always quote Me.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.800
Nobody is to quote Me to others,

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.640
because one thing is important,

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.720
whatever you have to say you put it on the notice board

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:17.800
maybe with My signature, better - for general things.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.600
and for particular whatever I say, you should do it for particular.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.760
At least that much discretion we all should have.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.440
And try. You'll be very much helped,

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.120
you will be surprised, you'll be very much helped,

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.640
because it is for, everything is for your betterment

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.160
and a special grace,

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:43.520
if you understand the essence of protocol.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.840
So I am taking you to that point

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.720
where you'll start understanding

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.880
that nothing is to be surrendered to Mother as such,

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:58.040
because She doesn't take anything, nothing goes to Her.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.120
Is only your surrendering yourself,

00:49:00.321 --> 00:49:04.641
by leaving all that is not wanted.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.440
It's a very beautifying process which one should take.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.760
You all have come up so much and you have to grow very much further,

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.840
I am sure you will go ahead and will become great Gurus

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:26.240
as you have promised today, by next year.
