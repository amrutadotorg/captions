1
00:00:00,794 --> 00:00:02,759
Can we start with Your childhood?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,142
-Yes.
- Do You, can describe a little bit

3
00:00:05,343 --> 00:00:08,659
the circumstances where you were grown up?

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,123
- My family?
- Yes.

5
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:22,931
I belong to a family of very enlightened people.

6
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:27,760
My father was a linguist

7
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:30,854
and he was master of fourteen languages.

8
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:34,167
He knew about twenty-six languages

9
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:41,467
and he translated even Koran-e-Sharif into Hindi language.

10
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:46,920
My Mother was in those days

11
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:51,041
was a honors in mathematics.

12
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:57,500
So both were very well educated and enlightened people.

13
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:05,399
At the time of My birth,

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,581
My mother dreamt

15
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:12,168
something which she could not explain,

16
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:16,553
but after that she had a great desire to go and see a tiger

17
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:19,299
in the open field.

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,913
My father was a great hunter,

19
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:25,819
because tigers were a menace in the area where we were living.

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,292
It was a hill station called Chhindwara.

21
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:34,460
So there was a king who was very much interested in My father.

22
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,801
Somehow or the other a letter came that

23
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:40,949
there’s a tiger, a very big tiger that has appeared

24
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,413
and they are frightened of him that he might be a man-eater.

25
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:51,412
So My father took My Mother and Me to that place.

26
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,055
And they were sitting what we call as a machhan,

27
00:01:55,256 --> 00:02:00,972
where they built something, for people to sit on top of a tree,

28
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:04,997
from where they can shoot nicely.

29
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:09,895
And then My mother tells Me that a big huge tiger

30
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:15,792
of a very big size, very beautifully appeared on the field.

31
00:02:15,993 --> 00:02:19,683
And she felt tremendous love for the tiger.

32
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:25,522
It was a full moon day and she felt

33
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:29,902
extremely compassionate towards the tiger.

34
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:33,089
And when My father raised his gun to shoot,

35
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,826
she stopped him and she wouldn’t allow him.

36
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:41,019
And the tiger went away and he never came to that forest again.

37
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,401
But that made My father think -

38
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:47,523
because he himself was a realized soul -

39
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,836
that must be somebody,

40
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:57,516
what we call a Goddess Durga who is fond of  a tiger

41
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:01,041
must be born to My mother,

42
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,818
because the symptoms were rather funny

43
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,768
that a lady should like to see a tiger and all.

44
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:09,265
So he told My mother, “Now are you satisfied?”

45
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,205
because they were struggling with the gun.

46
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:14,156
He said, “Is there a Durga sitting in your womb

47
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:17,785
that you are trying to protect the tiger?”

48
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:21,625
She said, “Yes, yes, so stop it now. I won’t allow you.”

49
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:24,505
Like that there were many incidents in My life

50
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:29,617
because I am of a Christian family – protestants –

51
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,278
and when I was born My mother didn’t feel any labor pains or anything

52
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,951
and just I was born; she didn’t know how.

53
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:40,518
And I had no blood on My body, nothing, I was clean washed.

54
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,031
That’s why they called My name as Nirmala.

55
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,856
But My grandmother said that She should be called as Nishkalanka,

56
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:52,358
that means the one which has no spots on it.

57
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,535
But that’s the name of man.

58
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,675
So they said, “All right, we'll call Her Nirmala

59
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:59,436
meaning the same, Immaculata.”

60
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,712
Now all these incidents, and then My Father being a realized soul,

61
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:08,130
he felt tremendous vibrations from Me,

62
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,801
and he felt that this life is great

63
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:17,330
and She will do something great in this life.

64
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,528
I do not know why, but

65
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:23,018
I don’t know if he dreamt or he understood it, but

66
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,113
all the time if I remember when he talked to Me,

67
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:29,433
he used to say that, "You have to find out a way

68
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:33,710
of giving en masse Realization, all the time".

69
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:37,439
As I told you, he was a great scholar of so many things,

70
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,599
and a very widely read man.

71
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,606
So he gave Me a good education in religion,

72
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,611
in different religions,

73
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:51,028
and also good education about human beings,

74
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,950
what are their problems,

75
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:56,295
why they react like this, why don’t they take to God,

76
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,324
why are they hypocritical.

77
00:04:58,607 --> 00:05:01,387
All kinds of things he talked to Me.

78
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:04,724
He also knew about Kundalini, but not so much.

79
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:08,127
Of course, when I was born

80
00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:11,411
I knew about Kundalini myself.

81
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,903
I knew all about it from My very childhood.

82
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:17,165
I was a very aware person, extremely aware.

83
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,789
But I didn’t know whom to talk to

84
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,331
because, see, people didn’t have that awareness.

85
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:24,004
You can’t talk to everyone like that.

86
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,523
So I was regarded as a very jolly person,

87
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:31,211
at the same time very serious also, very deep,

88
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:35,148
and then I started my studies as a child.

89
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:38,568
I was not very much interested

90
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:41,565
in the studies but I used to do very well,

91
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:45,928
but I used to read lives of great men and things like that.

92
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:49,595
At a very young age I read Bernard Shaw.

93
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:52,276
When people were reading just Great Expectations,

94
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,674
I was reading Bernard Shaw.

95
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,378
But as such I didn’t have interest in particularly reading

96
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,359
some text books because I thought they were childish,

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,566
and there is nothing to be read about it.

98
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:07,127
Then I told My father that “I have to do medicine.”

99
00:06:07,328 --> 00:06:10,545
So he said, “Why?” I said, “Because I have to talk to doctors.”

100
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,714
He said, “You have to talk to doctors?” “Yes”, I said.

101
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,121
But it so happened in My childhood

102
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:19,049
when I was about seven years of age,

103
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,153
My father was a congressman,

104
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:24,375
he had joined Congress when I was four years of age.

105
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,944
He used to live with a style, very westernized.

106
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:29,786
His clothes were stitched in London, sort of a man.

107
00:06:30,313 --> 00:06:32,029
We had governesses and all that.

108
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,918
He threw away everything and he became a real Indian

109
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:40,089
and started leading a life of a martyr.

110
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:46,500
Then he made us study our languages, Sanskrit...

111
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,675
He made Me study in an Indian school, not in a missionary school,

112
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,043
because missionaries were very unkind.

113
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:56,130
They threw us out of the school when My father was in the Congress.

114
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,844
They were against us completely.

115
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:04,537
Then at the age of seven years I happened to go with My Father

116
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,097
to Mahatma Gandhi.

117
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,717
He was about seventy miles, living with us,

118
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:13,013
but the first time he took Me down.

119
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:14,804
And Mahatma Gandhi liked Me very much.

120
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,170
He said, “Leave this child with me.”

121
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:20,153
So, I had not even taken clothes or anything. I stayed on;

122
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:25,422
then My Father sent Me everything with him.

123
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,846
And he was very fond of Me, but I was a little girl,

124
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,587
but he understood that there was something about Me.

125
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:36,688
He consulted Me on very serious problems sometimes, surprisingly.

126
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,297
Like one day he wanted to

127
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:42,331
make the Prayer Book all right.

128
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,908
So, he asked Me, “How should I put the series?” and all that.

129
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:48,506
So I told him how to put the series

130
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:51,449
and he put the series in that way.

131
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,168
I used to go back for My school and again go back to Gandhiji,

132
00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:00,273
every year, like that. And he called Me Nepali.

133
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:02,149
He'd given Me a name Nepali.

134
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,195
Everybody used to call Me Nepali that time.

135
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:10,009
Then I grew up with him very intimately.

136
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,645
He was a very, very kind person for children,

137
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:14,916
otherwise an extremely strict man,

138
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:19,349
with himself and with others, very strict, a big disciplinarian.

139
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,094
And he would make everybody get up at four o’clock,

140
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,920
have your baths, everything, be ready for your morning prayers

141
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:29,407
at five o’clock, you see, and he used to walk very fast.

142
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,361
I also learnt walking fast with him.

143
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:34,224
In his company I had to walk fast.

144
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:38,116
And he was extremely loving and a very nice person,

145
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,044
and he would listen to Me because I was a child, you see.

146
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:43,285
Supposing I forced him to eat more or something,

147
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:46,199
then he would, in laugh he would accept.

148
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,332
Very kindly person.

149
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:51,099
But with others was very strict, and I used to tell him that,

150
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,847
“Why are you strict with everyone?”

151
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,043
He said, “But You are a little girl, You get up in the morning time.

152
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:59,893
Why can’t they get up?” I said, “I am little. That’s why I get up.

153
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:04,499
They are big so they can’t get up”; like that, you see, little chats.

154
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,960
And then My father went to jail

155
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:08,887
and My mother also went to jail five times.

156
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:11,299
My father went to jail twice,

157
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,308
once for about two and a half years,

158
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,498
and he was the only supporting member of the family.

159
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,573
By the way, we come from a very old royal family,

160
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,065
which is called as Shalivahanas. They have a Calendar also in India.

161
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:32,699
And then when we, I mean when they took My father to jail,

162
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,437
we had to leave our house and we had to live in huts

163
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:38,390
and in all problems, that was nothing.

164
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:39,751
But also Me

165
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,695
they pestered a lot, because I helped many people there

166
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:45,854
and I joined the ’42 movement in a very serious way

167
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:48,242
and I became the leader here for the young people.

168
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:52,040
I thought unless and until I take a very positive stand,

169
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:54,873
it may not work out with them.

170
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,605
It’s not gracious to say how they tortured Me, what they did to Me,

171
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:02,063
but they really tortured Me.

172
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:05,443
I was a young girl of nineteen years that time.

173
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:10,274
It is over now. So, it’s finished, and after that we,

174
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,965
My father went to jail again

175
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,057
and then when he came back

176
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:20,081
he got elected as the member of the Central Assembly later on,

177
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:24,030
as the Constituent Assembly and then at the Parliament.

178
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:27,887
My brother was also a member of the Parliament, later on.

179
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:33,022
Now, recently, he was the Minister in the Cabinet.

180
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:37,839
Another brother is a High Court judge in Bombay.

181
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,080
They are all doing well, despite the fact

182
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:43,337
that our parents neglected us in a way

183
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:45,534
because they gave their lives for the country

184
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:48,670
but, you see, that never deterred us from studies

185
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:51,050
and we came up very well.

186
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:53,772
Then I, when I was in the ’42 movement, you see,

187
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,867
My college rusticated Me

188
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:58,351
– from the college they threw Me out

189
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:01,516
and I had to go to another college to study

190
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:05,534
far away from My house, in Punjab,

191
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:08,686
where I studied for two years.

192
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:12,797
Science I did, then I did my medical.

193
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:18,530
I didn’t do fully because, just after that the ’47 riots broke out,

194
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,982
so our college was closed and I didn’t want to know more

195
00:11:21,183 --> 00:11:23,876
because what I wanted to know I came to know about it.

196
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:27,505
So I did not need and I got married.

197
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,651
You must have heard My husband was, is now

198
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:34,449
the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization.

199
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,475
He held very high positions.

200
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:40,525
He was also Secretary to Lal Bahadur Shastri,

201
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:43,747
who was our Prime Minister, who was a another very great man,

202
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:47,045
but he did not survive long. If he had survived

203
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,705
things would have been different, I think, for our country

204
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:52,847
because he was a Gandhian, out and out Gandhian,

205
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:57,182
and he lived like an ideal Gandhian personality.

206
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:02,047
So that’s how the life went on.

207
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:07,694
But inner being was still seeking the way and methods

208
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,357
of giving en masse Realization.

209
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:16,389
My father said, “Before You do not develop this technique

210
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,482
of giving en masse Realization, don’t talk of religion.

211
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:22,180
Let nobody know that You know anything about it

212
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:25,147
because they’ll crucify You,” or

213
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:27,790
he was rather worried that people won’t understand

214
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:30,071
or, ‘You may write another Bible or Geeta. No use.

215
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:33,693
First of all you must give them Realization.

216
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:35,556
If they get their Realization

217
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:37,994
then they will realize that there is something about,

218
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:41,158
above this human awareness”.

219
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,996
For example, he always used to give an analogy -

220
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,899
supposing you are born on the tenth storey

221
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,685
and everybody is on the ground,

222
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:51,364
you must at least make them climb two storeys,

223
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:53,483
so they know there is something above it;

224
00:12:53,684 --> 00:12:55,650
otherwise no use talking about it.

225
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:58,551
And he said this is the mistake

226
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:01,529
between the saints and the incarnations was

227
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,044
that they never realized that these people are still on the ground,

228
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:09,191
they have to still enter into the building.

229
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,523
So that is what you have to be very careful

230
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,911
that first of all you must give Realization to people.

231
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:18,790
So I was seeking the ways and methods,

232
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:21,013
working it out inside Myself

233
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:24,917
through My own style of meditation in the sense that

234
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,533
I would work out all the permutations and combinations.

235
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:30,761
Supposing I met one person, then I would see

236
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:34,914
what problems that person had, how you can overcome it like that.

237
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:38,629
I would try to study that person internally.

238
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,321
And I went to many people to find out,

239
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,889
but I found they were great hypocrites.

240
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,696
I saw so many of these gurus.

241
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:50,799
Most of them I saw them, I was surprised, they were all hypocrites,

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,136
money-making and this thing.

243
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:57,097
And also I went to Rajneesh also, to see him.

244
00:13:57,298 --> 00:14:01,034
Then he said that I should come to his program.

245
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,557
I did not know what sort of man

246
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,977
because he was talking about Geeta and big, big things.

247
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,573
I thought he might be knowing something about it.

248
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:09,338
I went there, but my husband said,

249
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,203
“No, I won't allow You to go to his camp”

250
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:13,847
So he arranged his own bungalow and all that for Me.

251
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,484
So I went down there

252
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:18,357
and there I couldn't see all the things that were going on

253
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,636
and that is the day somehow or other

254
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:24,950
I said I must open the last chakra. So the last chakra was opened.

255
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:30,630
And I saw the Kundalini which is the Primordial force within us,

256
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:34,536
which is the Holy Ghost within us,

257
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:37,576
rising like a telescope, opening out,

258
00:14:38,236 --> 00:14:42,266
and then I saw the whole thing open

259
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:46,486
and a big torrential rain of breeze

260
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:49,755
started flowing through My head all over,

261
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,794
as if, and I felt "I am lost now. I am no more there.

262
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:55,826
It’s only the Grace is there, that is there."

263
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:59,040
I saw it completely happening to Me.

264
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:05,195
And, but I was amazed that when I went to Rajneesh, you see,

265
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,129
because before going I had to say goodbye.

266
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,621
He never realized what had happened or anything.

267
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:10,920
So I was surprised.

268
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:14,362
I said, “This man doesn’t know anything about God”,

269
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,763
and then I discovered that they were all hypocrites

270
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,569
and telling lies.

271
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,484
So in 1973 this happened, on 5th of May

272
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:27,368
’70, 1970, 5-th of May.

273
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,448
And just after that

274
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:33,508
we had a very big lecture in Jahangir Hall - there's a very big hall -

275
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,663
and thousands of people had come. I told them very frankly

276
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:39,491
that these are all thugs and these are like this, hypocrites.

277
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,977
Some of them are demoniacs. Some are evil people.

278
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:45,686
I took their names, everything. I told them, “Don’t go near them.”

279
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:48,411
There were some foreigners also.

280
00:15:50,923 --> 00:15:54,463
And there were so many others whom I told these things very clearly,

281
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,260
and they got frightened. They said, “You shouldn’t say like this.

282
00:15:57,461 --> 00:15:58,959
They’ll come and murder you. They’ll do..."

283
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,682
”I said, “Let them come and murder Me.”

284
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:04,639
But nobody did anything. Nobody even went to the courts.

285
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,927
And that’s how, you see, they tried to bring bad name to Me.

286
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:13,609
They paid money to the newspapers to publish things against Me,

287
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,126
because I said, “You cannot pay money.”

288
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:21,029
So they thought that I was just trying to, you see, harm them

289
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,636
by saying such a thing that you can’t earn money in the name of God.

290
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:29,062
If it’s a job you can do it, but God’s work is not a job.

291
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:33,660
And the struggle started

292
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:36,953
from the day I started giving Realization,

293
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:41,317
and I started with one lady who got Realization first.

294
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:45,374
Then we got about twelve people who got Realization.

295
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:51,499
In two years I got only about fourteen people Realization.

296
00:16:51,828 --> 00:16:54,659
Then gradually when fourteen people got Realization then

297
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,585
many others started getting Realization.

298
00:16:57,786 --> 00:17:02,916
But I started also curing people because that was helping a lot.

299
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:07,613
Then My husband got elected to this post

300
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:09,896
and we had to come to London.

301
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,473
So when I came to London

302
00:17:11,674 --> 00:17:15,321
we had one program in Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan. They arranged it.

303
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:18,693
So the Indians abroad are not so much interested in God;

304
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:20,791
they are more interested in money.

305
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:24,400
So none of the Indians stayed there. They all ran away.

306
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:30,299
And only the foreigners who were there, were about seven hippies.

307
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,429
So I had to work on them, seven hippies.

308
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,433
For four years I was working on them, to give them Realization.

309
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:39,145
Very difficult, you see. Their liver was bad.

310
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:42,937
They had ill health. Their head was off, terrible times.

311
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:45,229
But in between I used to go to India,

312
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,261
and in India also the work was done.

313
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,560
For three months always I would be in India.

314
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:51,920
So we started working in the villages,

315
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:55,160
specially surprisingly where My forefathers were ruling,

316
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:58,669
in that area, the work started moving in a very big way.

317
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,602
And there then we started taking some people from India.

318
00:18:02,803 --> 00:18:07,589
Then some people came from Australia to India, like that,

319
00:18:07,835 --> 00:18:11,974
and the work started moving in those directions.

320
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,394
Then gradually the work improved and people found

321
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,641
that this is the way we can transform ourselves.

322
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:21,963
Many people who were taking drugs or alcoholic

323
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:24,764
or mad people, or cancer people ,

324
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:27,359
they felt better, then they got cured

325
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,732
and it was established that Sahaja Yoga is something very important.

326
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,313
Now when I travel all over the world,

327
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:40,550
you see, first My husband used to pay for everything.

328
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:43,156
Wherever I went, he had to pay all.

329
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:45,537
Any expenses he used to do for Me.

330
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,971
Gradually, then now, these people pay for My travel,

331
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:53,104
but otherwise they don’t have to pay for anything else

332
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,475
That’s how we started our work. There was lot of opposition

333
00:18:57,676 --> 00:19:02,077
and the media people would never understand it,

334
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:06,293
because it was no such a sensation as you can say,

335
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:08,222
nothing to people feel excited.

336
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:09,942
But in a way it’s a very great thing,

337
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:13,068
because if this is the solution for the whole world.

338
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,031
One should try to do it.

339
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:20,024
Then we had very great people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

340
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:24,386
like, we can say,

341
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:29,542
the Hague High Court judge, who is now the President,

342
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:34,273
who has given Nicaragua, this thing judgment.

343
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:38,602
He and many lawyers and many barristers.

344
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,126
We have one barrister here from Algeria,

345
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:44,680
and doctors, and then they took over

346
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:49,393
and they started helping Me out how to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

347
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:53,296
But it was a difficult task in the West.

348
00:19:53,497 --> 00:19:55,999
Of course, in India it spread very fast in the villages

349
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,188
but city people in India also

350
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:00,964
are westernized and they start analyzing.

351
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,150
They don’t know much about our past.

352
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,606
They don’t know anything about our heritage,

353
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,207
that we have our Kundalini and all that.

354
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,950
But some people do know about self-Realization.

355
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:13,161
But these gurus could not stick on in India

356
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:16,817
because nobody would accept them. So they all run away abroad.

357
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:19,145
And that was something a blessing for Me also

358
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:21,978
because I didn’t have to fight them there,

359
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,691
and it started working out,

360
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:27,474
and then people found that it helps in every way,

361
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:30,392
and they found so many miracles about it,

362
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:34,264
and that’s how Sahaja Yoga got settled quite a lot.

363
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:36,486
But still I would say that

364
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:39,202
we have not been to certain countries so far,

365
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:44,148
and in the west, I would say that so much work has still to be done.

366
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:47,462
Because as soon as you start any work in any place,

367
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,819
first of all they want Me to cure people

368
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,321
and to help them with curatives.

369
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:56,101
Now if I pay attention more to that,

370
00:20:56,302 --> 00:21:00,119
then the main work is to create doctors out of everyone.

371
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,826
That is neglected. Then you become unpopular.

372
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:05,873
They think, “Oh, She is not sympathetic” and this and that.

373
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:08,058
But now as we have, everybody can cure now,

374
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,564
everyone. I don’t cure anyone directly.

375
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:13,170
But they don’t like it. They want I should be there

376
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:15,834
and their ego to be pampered and all those things are there.

377
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,360
Rather difficult.

378
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:20,124
It’s not, we are not running an election, you see,

379
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:22,843
like we should please others sort of thing, is not there.

380
00:21:23,044 --> 00:21:25,142
But whatever is reality,

381
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:30,059
if a person has intelligence – pure intelligence

382
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,178
– he can see that this is something very different

383
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,937
and for that one has to

384
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:40,079
understand that you cannot,

385
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,235
you cannot force on anyone that "You get your Realization".

386
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:49,513
In the same way you cannot force Me that I give you Realization,

387
00:21:49,714 --> 00:21:51,603
because if it does not work, it does not work.

388
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:53,321
It’s such a living force, you see.

389
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,403
And that upsets them very soon.

390
00:21:56,604 --> 00:22:00,177
I feel that the way

391
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:04,718
this industrial revolution has come in the west,

392
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,417
people have lost their moorings, perhaps. They are so confused.

393
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,517
With all these gurus coming down here confusing them

394
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:16,211
and all kinds of new things coming, they don’t know where to look.

395
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:20,344
But unless and until you get your evolution completed,

396
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:24,121
unless and until you reach that absolute state of understanding,

397
00:22:24,322 --> 00:22:25,812
the chaos will remain.

398
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,740
So one has to try to get to that.

399
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:33,890
But one must understand you can’t pay for it. There is no effort.

400
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,249
After getting Realization

401
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,796
they feel so satisfied, they forget about it.

402
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:40,662
But after that you must know how to give it to others.

403
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:44,313
As Christ has said that the light which is enlightened,

404
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:46,411
you do not put it under the table.

405
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:48,408
That’s how what happens that,

406
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,772
it's a, though we may give Realization at hundred people,

407
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:55,806
only out of that five to six will come forward to help us out.

408
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,513
But still I must say lot of work has been done.

409
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:01,378
Especially Austria, I am very proud of Austria.

410
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:06,629
And the way they have never given Me any problem – never –

411
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:09,608
and very good people have come out of Austria.

412
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:16,003
Very balanced, you see, level-headed people, very level-headed.

413
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:18,861
They are not extremists. They do not go to extremes.

414
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:23,099
There is no fanaticism about them. They are sensible people,

415
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,714
and something so lucky that Austria was found out

416
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:31,154
because I never expected that in Austria

417
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:33,654
there will be so many people. But somehow

418
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:38,106
like water finds its own level, Sahaja Yoga finds its own level.

419
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:40,191
We just came down to Austria.

420
00:23:40,392 --> 00:23:44,892
We haven’t been to Norway, to Sweden, Denmark, Finland.

421
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:48,148
I visited those places because of My husband’s job

422
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:50,521
but I have not been there.

423
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:57,014
Now we have sixteen centers in Australia,

424
00:23:57,215 --> 00:24:00,255
and Australia is a very progressive Sahaja Yoga thing.

425
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:03,327
We have got schools now there. They are running schools

426
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:10,243
and the teachers are extremely well-behaved and visionaries,

427
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:12,796
and they look after the children very well.

428
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:17,744
The Government people sent somebody for observation

429
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:20,900
and they have remarked that whatever they proclaim,

430
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:22,649
that’s what they manifest,

431
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,727
and they have given good certificates to us.

432
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:29,534
But the greatest achievement on the outward life is this,

433
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:33,027
that Cambridge University has accepted Sahaja Yoga

434
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:36,991
for a research work, with respect, by one Dr. Lee,

435
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:39,951
who is doing the research about Sahaja Yoga in Cambridge University.

436
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:41,291
He is already a Doctor.

437
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:45,442
And there is another great thing has happened in Delhi University,

438
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:48,651
that the Delhi University has accepted

439
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:54,653
that a person can do, only a doctor can do, a PhD,

440
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:57,623
or we can say the Doctorate in Sahaja Yoga,

441
00:24:57,841 --> 00:25:03,912
and he gets the highest degree called the Doctor of Medicine,

442
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:08,754
and perhaps maybe after sometime they will allow anyone to do that.

443
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,746
This is about the medicine part of it.

444
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:13,619
In agriculture we have done lots of research, Myself.

445
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,894
We have somebody here, an expert on agriculture.

446
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:19,259
He has also done lot of research,

447
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,829
and we found out, that with vibrations we start after Realization,

448
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,627
if you vibrate the water and if you water the plants with that,

449
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,819
then sometimes you might get even ten times more breed.

450
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,300
That’s what they did in India, in one of the Agricultural University.

451
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:40,519
But here also he’s found out that there’s tremendous difference

452
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,247
between the growth of an ordinary thing.

453
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:46,037
Another thing we have found out in agriculture,

454
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:48,159
that if you give vibrations then

455
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,220
even an ordinary cow can give lot of milk.

456
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:55,265
But if you have hybrid cows then, you see,

457
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:56,820
it’s not good for the brain,

458
00:25:57,034 --> 00:26:00,923
because a person who takes hybrid milk, also gets hybrid.

459
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:03,296
I mean his brain becomes little wobbly.

460
00:26:03,497 --> 00:26:06,470
So better to have a pure milk from a cow

461
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:11,321
which is not been put to this kind of a experimentation.

462
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:13,857
Moreover, food also, if it’s hybrid food,

463
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:17,711
it’s not very good for us because that spoils our nerves, I think.

464
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:21,907
But ordinary seeds you cannot use because they have weakened

465
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,669
and they cannot reproduce.

466
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,408
So when we vibrate them

467
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:29,157
they produce very well just like,

468
00:26:29,358 --> 00:26:31,719
better than even sometimes, hybrid thing,

469
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,973
and the food, it tastes very well

470
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,122
and it doesn’t give those complications.

471
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:38,600
So this can help in agriculture in India,

472
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:41,780
and the government has allotted us lot of land

473
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:44,147
where we are going to now experiment,

474
00:26:44,348 --> 00:26:46,702
and we are going to start the experimentation there

475
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:49,260
to show that how we can use this.

476
00:26:49,461 --> 00:26:52,950
But many farmers who are Sahaja Yogis have done a lot of job

477
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:57,211
and they have discovered that even animals

478
00:26:57,412 --> 00:26:59,870
and this, what you call,

479
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:04,412
farming, everything is helped very much by vibration.

480
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:07,030
So it improves the lives of people.

481
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:10,824
We have on the other side, social side, I can tell you that

482
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,009
we have our marriages – international marriages.

483
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,426
We arrange international marriages between people.

484
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:25,345
They have to know each other and they are together.

485
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:29,796
And first of all they are together for one or half month

486
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,661
with us in the tour. They see each other

487
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:33,277
and their marriages are fixed.

488
00:27:33,478 --> 00:27:37,363
And we have seen that such marriages are extremely successful.

489
00:27:37,564 --> 00:27:40,053
Ninety-nine percent marriages are successful.

490
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:41,951
Once in a while, maybe a mishap,

491
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:44,758
but mostly there are no divorces that take place.

492
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,824
Once in a while if it’s not successful

493
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:48,682
we have no objection to divorce also,

494
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:51,261
but mostly it is successful and they get children

495
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,462
who are very intelligent,

496
00:27:53,653 --> 00:27:56,328
who are themselves born realized children, mostly.

497
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:00,188
So the problem is much less and the family life improves.

498
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:03,280
The quality of life is thousand times better.

499
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,555
People are very joyous, happy, they do not complain,

500
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:08,853
and they enjoy life and they give to others.

501
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,287
They share what joy they have. So …

502
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:13,516
I: Can I ask a question?

503
00:28:13,717 --> 00:28:15,452
What do you think are the important points

504
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,286
in the education of children,

505
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:21,155
what are important to give to the children?

506
00:28:21,356 --> 00:28:24,060
You see, first if they get Realization,

507
00:28:24,261 --> 00:28:26,962
to get first time to that point of Realization...

508
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,193
If they are already born realized no problem,

509
00:28:29,394 --> 00:28:31,777
but if they have, they're given Realization,

510
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:34,693
then, you see, they start seeing from a different level.

511
00:28:34,894 --> 00:28:38,673
They become the Spirit. So their self-respect, you see, awaken.

512
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:44,638
Such children behave in a very dignified, elderly manner, you see.

513
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,262
They talk in a very elderly manner

514
00:28:47,463 --> 00:28:50,046
and this gives solutions of all kinds, you see.

515
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:53,101
And they are tremendous people.

516
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:56,978
But we have to guide them properly by our own behavior,

517
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,317
how we behave. The greatest thing is how we behave.

518
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:02,225
That’s how the children learn.

519
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:06,340
We put the children certain

520
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,890
to some tests, how they are.

521
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:12,369
We find out if they have any physical problems, we cure them.

522
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,761
If they have mental problem, we cure them.

523
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,673
If they have any other problem, social problem or anything,

524
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,190
we try to help them out.

525
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,830
So that basically if a human being is all right in the childhood,

526
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:27,441
then fundamentals are all right for the child.

527
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:29,014
The foundation is laid down.

528
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:33,404
Then to build a child up into a good quality is not difficult.

529
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,176
So now we find great artists are there,

530
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:39,398
there are great musicians

531
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,634
and at a very young age they have started playing violin...

532
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:46,295
I mean suddenly they have become dynamic also and very humble.

533
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:49,804
They are very humble and self-respectfing and very well-behaved.

534
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:54,241
It's surprising how the atmosphere is and how it works out.

535
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:57,324
And the other day the lady asked Me about the women

536
00:29:57,525 --> 00:30:01,650
and I told her that a woman’s power as a mother is very great.

537
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:03,718
And she felt hurt about it. But I didn’t mean

538
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,848
that you should be just a mother. What I am saying,

539
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:09,443
she is a mother, means she is compassionate, she is kind,

540
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,389
she is not aggressive like men.

541
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,161
That is a very big quality.

542
00:30:13,362 --> 00:30:16,282
That is a very big power in a woman. That is what I was suggesting

543
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,110
that that is what we have to earn,

544
00:30:18,311 --> 00:30:22,291
is not to compete with men. It's madness to compete with men,

545
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:25,711
and to go about like that, because...

546
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:29,695
You see we have to understand that life

547
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:34,897
has to be enjoyable.

548
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:38,643
Life is to be a blessing, not to be a misery.

549
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:42,120
We create our own miseries by these false ideas,

550
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:47,588
by our own conflictions we have in our mind,

551
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:49,902
mental projections we have in our mind,

552
00:30:50,093 --> 00:30:52,882
or our own obstinacy – whatever it is.

553
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,362
All these things can be cured

554
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:57,037
if you take to Sahaja Yoga

555
00:30:57,238 --> 00:31:00,588
because you become a balanced person, level-headed, wise person.

556
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:01,834
And you become a witness.

557
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:04,455
The whole thing becomes like a show, like a drama.

558
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:05,696
And you become fearless,

559
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,836
you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.

560
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:10,328
And this is what a human being has to achieve.

561
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:13,923
We talk of peace. We talk of no war.

562
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,107
We talk of many things like this, you see,

563
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,593
atomic bomb, this, that... All that is not going to work out.

564
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:21,084
Only what is going to work out

565
00:31:21,285 --> 00:31:23,184
is the transformation of human beings.

566
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:25,141
If the human beings are transformed,

567
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,757
things will work out absolutely first class.

568
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:33,739
Not only that, but that they will enjoy the bliss of life.

569
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,589
We are missing the point altogether!

570
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,570
This is a very important thing

571
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:41,689
that human beings must say, one thing:

572
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,419
what have we achieved out of all these?

573
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,971
Just for a minute to stop and think.

574
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:51,546
What would you say is the definition of illness?

575
00:31:51,682 --> 00:31:54,132
What's the causes of illness?

576
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:58,866
It’s the physical, mental, emotional, all illnesses are caused

577
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:02,874
by the imbalances within us, by our extreme behavior.

578
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:06,873
And supposing say now the cancer. We can take the cancer.

579
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:10,304
Cancer is caused by the over-activity

580
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:12,827
of the sympathetic nervous system.

581
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:18,595
Now supposing a person is a very sad person.

582
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:22,216
He cries and weeps and all the time feels guilty

583
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:25,032
and thinks that he is the worst person ever born,

584
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:28,657
he’s committed so many sins and all sorts of nonsense, you see.

585
00:32:28,897 --> 00:32:31,341
Then he goes to the left side, according to us

586
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:34,289
and crosses over to the collective subconscious area.

587
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,082
And there, according to us, what they call as Protein 58,

588
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:41,004
and Protein 52, doctors call it that way,

589
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,277
but we call it as the dead souls;

590
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:45,825
they exist there and they catch hold of you

591
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:48,206
and they trigger the cancer.

592
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:49,840
But supposing by any chance

593
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:53,504
you can bring the attention fully away from that

594
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,860
in the center you can get cured.

595
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:59,791
So it is the centers within us which are subtle,

596
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,317
which are basically seven centers.

597
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:04,500
There are many others, but basically seven.

598
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:06,053
If you can put them right,

599
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:10,257
you cannot have any sickness or illness, of any kind.

600
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:15,095
Let's go back to your childhood.

601
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:20,015
Can You explain - Your parents

602
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:23,649
supported You very much in Your learning and in Your studies.

603
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,070
It’s correct? [unclear]

604
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:29,567
Yes, yes. Of course. You see in...

605
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:31,377
Is this normal

606
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:34,339
that parents support the child like You in Your family?

607
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,485
In India, all parents support the child.

608
00:33:37,686 --> 00:33:40,120
- Even if...
- You can learn everything what You want to?

609
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:41,972
Yes, yes, I mean, that is true.

610
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,013
But you see the basic thing is

611
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:47,702
parents are very benevolent to children, very kind to children,

612
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:52,851
and to them, you see, the child’s education, child’s upbringing

613
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:55,965
and child’s life is very important.

614
00:33:56,166 --> 00:34:00,047
That’s why we know they are, so we depend on them,

615
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:03,534
they look after us and they are very wise people.

616
00:34:03,735 --> 00:34:05,678
They sacrifice everything for us.

617
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,096
So, whatever they say we think it’s nice

618
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:12,317
and by doing this we have not lost anything so far.

619
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:14,761
In India if you find Indian children when they come abroad

620
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:16,862
they always talk the least anywhere.

621
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:19,112
They are very obedient children

622
00:34:19,313 --> 00:34:21,612
and they behave very well.

623
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:24,656
We don’t have all this problem, teenage problem, homosexual.

624
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,731
We don’t know even all this problems are

625
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,341
because we are so close with the parents all the time.

626
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,874
They all the time watch us. We don’t have drug problem,

627
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:34,855
none of these. Only in the cities, little bit,

628
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,597
it happens and it disappears;

629
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:39,007
because parents are all the time with their children.

630
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,564
We live together. The whole family lives together.

631
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:43,420
And not only with the parents

632
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,405
but all the relations and all the people

633
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:49,521
in the village and the city, everyone knows each other.

634
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:52,225
Such a joint system we have

635
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:56,526
that we do not normally,

636
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,742
sort of, go into wrong ways and methods

637
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:02,458
and we do not become obstinate also.

638
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:05,549
- But, You grew up in a Christian family in India.
- Yes.

639
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,822
Yes.

640
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:11,320
It’s not a normal situation, that Indian people are Christian.

641
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:13,125
Yes, I know. It is, you see,

642
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:15,667
I was born in a Christian family deliberately,

643
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,714
because I think, you see, I personally think,

644
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:22,753
that Protestants are the greatest fanatics;

645
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,936
because they are very sophisticated, you see,

646
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:26,555
their fanaticism is in their brain.

647
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:28,682
Nobody can make them out of their fanaticism.

648
00:35:28,883 --> 00:35:31,441
They are very great fanatics, the greatest of all.

649
00:35:31,642 --> 00:35:33,738
But My parents were very enlightened people

650
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:35,971
and they understood Christ very well.

651
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,777
Yesterday I told you about Paul, you see, when I was -

652
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:40,917
first time I took the Bible in the hand

653
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:42,853
and I asked My father, “Who is this Paul?”.

654
00:35:43,054 --> 00:35:46,270
He said “He is an intruder. Forget him. Don’t read him at all.”

655
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,862
So you see they understood all these things very well

656
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,165
and because My father was a realized soul,

657
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,577
like Khalil Gibran, you see. If you read Khalil Gibran,

658
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,860
he says the same thing about Paul, the same thing.

659
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:59,156
So, you see, if you are an enlightened person,

660
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,138
you see the essence of everything.

661
00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:03,088
Whatever religion you may be born,

662
00:36:03,263 --> 00:36:06,143
you don’t ignore any other religion.

663
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:08,356
You try to learn about other religion,

664
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:11,088
and you find the essence is the same in every religion.

665
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:12,499
What is there to fight?

666
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,373
And that’s how you belong to no religion,

667
00:36:14,574 --> 00:36:17,415
you belong to every religion. That’s what happens.

668
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:20,584
But My parents were very enlightened people, I must say,

669
00:36:20,785 --> 00:36:24,531
and I was very lucky to choose them as My parents.

670
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:28,078
You have been an enlightened child, is it correct?

671
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:30,775
- I beg your pardon?
- You had been an enlightened child?

672
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:32,838
Yes, I have been born as an enlightened child.

673
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,990
But You don’t feel sometimes very lonesome,

674
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:40,791
because all the others are different?

675
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,830
No, no, that is, you see, if you know how to share with others...

676
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:48,846
Actually I was like a Mother to them from My very childhood.

677
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:51,329
When My father, mother went to jail I was,

678
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,414
first time, I was about, I think five and a half years of age.

679
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:59,252
So I had all the keys of the house in My little frock thing,

680
00:36:59,453 --> 00:37:02,534
and I used to carry all the duties like a grandmother.

681
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:04,565
I never felt lost. I mean,

682
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,314
My life is on the whole is very collective,

683
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:09,978
by temperament I am extremely collective.

684
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:12,595
I can live anywhere. I can sleep anywhere.

685
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,685
I can live in the jungles. I can...

686
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:18,500
I have no problems of that. I am extremely collective.

687
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:22,199
I am not exclusive by temperament, from very childhood.

688
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,973
I was very friendly with all the people

689
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:27,305
in that area where we were living

690
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:29,772
and My mother was known as Nirmala’s mother,

691
00:37:29,973 --> 00:37:31,551
father was known as Nirmala’s father.

692
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:34,463
So they said, “We have lost our identity because of Her”.

693
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:38,196
So I was a very friendly person. I never felt lonely,

694
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:40,963
and when I am with Myself I am never lonely at all.

695
00:37:41,164 --> 00:37:43,801
I enjoy Myself very much.

696
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:50,082
When You had been to the ashram with Gandhi,

697
00:37:50,283 --> 00:37:54,471
can You mention one or two impressions You remember

698
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,826
about Gandhi?

699
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,652
Oh! Gandhiji was a tremendous man.

700
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:00,915
One has to learn a lot from him.

701
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:04,628
He was not at all a hypocrite, that’s one thing.

702
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:09,112
And he was not like modern, we say, politicians,

703
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:13,074
who says something, do something. No, he was very outspoken

704
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:17,415
and always put himself on the testing point.

705
00:38:17,624 --> 00:38:21,608
And he used to confess if he made mistakes, immediately.

706
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:26,093
One very great incident I remember, when I was a small child.

707
00:38:26,294 --> 00:38:29,559
They were having a meeting together

708
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,377
and we girls were there only sitting giving them

709
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,431
water and things, to all the people.

710
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:39,000
All the big people were there, like...

711
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:42,392
Jawaharlal Lal Nehru was there and also Maulana Azad,

712
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:44,454
all these people were sitting there.

713
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,627
They were discussing something and then suddenly

714
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:51,790
Mahatmaji said that, “Now it’s very late. We’ll have lunch here.”

715
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,352
So they said, “Yes, yes, we’ll have lunch here.”

716
00:38:55,553 --> 00:38:58,210
They had to go to the guest house which was far away.

717
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:03,707
So Mahatmaji asked for the Baa, is his wife. She had gone out.

718
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,989
So he got up. He had a key with him,

719
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,908
you see, always of the store room.

720
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:09,312
He opened the store room,

721
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,013
and he asked the people who were in charge of cooking

722
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:14,871
to measure everything

723
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:18,901
according to the people there are, properly, everything, you see.

724
00:39:19,102 --> 00:39:22,611
And then he, and they measured it out, everything was done

725
00:39:22,812 --> 00:39:24,051
then he put the key back,

726
00:39:24,252 --> 00:39:26,557
and then he went and sat there nicely.

727
00:39:26,774 --> 00:39:28,461
So these people said,

728
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:31,950
“Bapu, we did not know you had to take so much trouble,

729
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:36,260
you see, to go all the way and measure out everything out for us.”

730
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:39,220
It did not take much time, about fifteen minutes, but still.

731
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,574
So he said, “What do you think?

732
00:39:41,775 --> 00:39:46,099
This is the blood of my country. I cannot allow it to be wasted”.

733
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,160
See, that’s the sign of a person who understands

734
00:39:49,361 --> 00:39:53,307
the value of public money. That’s just ingrained in him,

735
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:57,053
but those who saw him also felt

736
00:39:57,285 --> 00:40:01,186
that, "Look at this man, who is living like an ascetic, absolutely,

737
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:04,422
in the sense that he would not touch the public money".

738
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:08,136
And that is one of the key, keys for all the leaders.

739
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:11,975
If they are absolutely above the money,

740
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:16,438
then only people will respect; otherwise, there is no way out.

741
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,528
But you find these days in every country

742
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:21,586
so much of corruption, hypocrisy,

743
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:23,797
then you are really shocked.

744
00:40:23,998 --> 00:40:26,049
What do You think is the reason

745
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:30,557
of all these corruption, of the political instability?

746
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:34,426
It’s ignorance. It is ignorance.

747
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:39,673
They think by having money or by having big position

748
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:44,631
or by having a big name, they’ll be happy.

749
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:48,129
They will not be happy. Only the ego will be pampered.

750
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,547
When it is slightly hurt, the person will be unhappy.

751
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:54,936
So he’ll be going into from happiness to unhappiness.

752
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:57,732
But when he gets the knowledge

753
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:01,271
that it is the Spirit which is the source of joy,

754
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:04,885
then he doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care for all these things.

755
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:07,801
He is not afraid of anything. He lives like a Lord himself.

756
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:10,120
He is a Lord, he doesn’t want anything.

757
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,879
You see, the one who is the Lord doesn’t want anything.

758
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,060
For example, now, as you know, I come from a rich family,

759
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:17,877
my husband from a rich family.

760
00:41:18,132 --> 00:41:21,450
He’s now well to do. We have very comfortable living,

761
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:25,052
but I can live in a, on a street, I can sleep on a street,

762
00:41:25,253 --> 00:41:28,663
because I am like a queen. I don’t need anything.

763
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:31,068
If you need anything then you are a beggar,

764
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,290
otherwise you are a king, isn’t it?

765
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,851
That’s what I feel. So that is what is the ignorance.

766
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:41,412
Once they know we are just fighting our ignorance

767
00:41:41,613 --> 00:41:43,277
they’ll give it up. It’s nonsense.

768
00:41:43,478 --> 00:41:46,154
It is nonsense and it’s not at all joy giving.

769
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:48,776
Your virtues are very joy giving.

770
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:54,149
If you know about your chastity, or you know about your honesty,

771
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,164
or if you know about your straightforwardness,

772
00:41:57,365 --> 00:41:58,766
it’s very joy giving.

773
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:01,031
You feel so confident, so happy

774
00:42:01,232 --> 00:42:03,758
and such a person never tries to harm anyone,

775
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:05,381
to be sarcastic with anyone.

776
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:07,459
Such a person is absolutely free, I should say,

777
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,989
because he has no bondages of any kind.

778
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,409
These are all bondages which bind us

779
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,480
and we become jealous and we become greedy,

780
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:18,550
we become lusty. All this is nonsense.

781
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:21,972
It’s to be just seen after getting to your Spirit

782
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,741
that the light shows these are all like snakes, you see,

783
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,752
crawling up on us and we are holding on to snakes.

784
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:31,323
People when they die, you see - big, big people I have seen -

785
00:42:31,524 --> 00:42:33,326
people tell about them.

786
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,977
In the history they go down as horrible people.

787
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:38,827
In the history they are described as people who were hypocrites,

788
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:44,932
who were cruel, who were very, I should say, adamant type,

789
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:46,793
and all kinds of things is described.

790
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:50,222
Whatever is genuine remains genuine.

791
00:42:52,288 --> 00:42:55,439
You never, don’t feel frightened?

792
00:42:55,621 --> 00:43:00,361
No, I don’t. I don’t know anything like fear.

793
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:04,479
What’s there to be afraid of?

794
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,259
I am never afraid of,

795
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,992
because if you believe and you know definitely there is God all over,

796
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:12,947
there is nothing to be afraid of.

797
00:43:13,148 --> 00:43:16,335
He looks after you every moment, every minute.

798
00:43:16,536 --> 00:43:18,297
Wherever you are, He looks after you.

799
00:43:18,498 --> 00:43:21,096
These people have had so many experiences of that.

800
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:24,790
There was one girl who was a Sahaja Yogini

801
00:43:24,991 --> 00:43:29,790
and she was driving somewhere in Germany on an Autobahn,

802
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:31,716
and there were so many cars were with her.

803
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,968
And suddenly her brake failed

804
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:36,029
and the car started going this way, that way.

805
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,897
She didn’t know how to manage it. She said, “Now, what to do?”

806
00:43:39,098 --> 00:43:41,625
She just... She had another one also with her.

807
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:42,897
Both of them, they said,

808
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:45,140
“All right, let us close our eyes and think of Mother.”

809
00:43:45,341 --> 00:43:47,560
They just started thinking of Me and said,

810
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:50,190
“We’ll not be afraid, just think of Her”.

811
00:43:50,398 --> 00:43:52,952
And suddenly they found that their car had come

812
00:43:53,153 --> 00:43:58,256
to one side of the road very nicely without any scratch.

813
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:04,272
So, you see, it is just our fear makes us more frantic and stupid.

814
00:44:04,473 --> 00:44:06,892
There is nothing to be afraid of.

815
00:44:07,093 --> 00:44:09,213
It is to be seen how God helps you.

816
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:11,635
But people don’t want to take His help, you see.

817
00:44:11,836 --> 00:44:15,831
Then God says, “All right, go ahead and break your head. What to do?”

818
00:44:17,477 --> 00:44:20,276
Sometimes other people are helping.

819
00:44:20,477 --> 00:44:23,204
Yes, then you should know how to handle them.

820
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:26,005
You see, they, for example, yesterday that fellow came.

821
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,115
You see, he just became like a beaten up dog.

822
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:31,489
You saw him coming and saying something to Me, which you never heard.

823
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,793
But they belong to a cult, some sort of a cult, you see,

824
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:38,722
and they always oppose us. They have some sort of Christians.

825
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:43,713
And when I was in Geneva, one of the ladies,

826
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:48,966
all, you see, dressed up in a very fashionable way,

827
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:52,366
she came to Me with a Bible in her hand to hit me, you see.

828
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:55,919
And everybody got frightened that now she is going to beat Me.

829
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,396
This woman walked with big high heels upon Me

830
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:02,398
and I dont know, they thought she’ll do something to Me.

831
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,578
As soon as I saw her with the Bible, you know,

832
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,425
I started laughing, absolutely.

833
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:09,072
I couldn’t bear. I thought, “Such a joker she is.

834
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,772
She is coming to hit Me with a Bible? How can she do it?”

835
00:45:11,973 --> 00:45:15,008
And she got worried about Me that I am laughing so much.

836
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:16,421
It’s all on the tape.

837
00:45:16,622 --> 00:45:18,744
And these boys were very much frightened, I've seen.

838
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:21,410
I was not at all. I said, “It’s perfectly all right,”

839
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:23,814
and she ran away because she saw Me laughing, you know.

840
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:27,295
I just couldn’t help [unclear] laughing at the joker,

841
00:45:27,496 --> 00:45:30,904
the way she came to hit Me with a Bible. Imagine!

842
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:33,303
So this is what it is. If you are afraid

843
00:45:33,504 --> 00:45:36,873
then they sit on your heads. But you should not be afraid.

844
00:45:38,396 --> 00:45:42,978
There's a chinese story that there's one king who took two,

845
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:49,454
two cocks for fighting to a very realised soul, a guru,

846
00:45:49,655 --> 00:45:52,383
and he said, "You make them all right".

847
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,883
So he said "All right". He trained them for one month,

848
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:56,617
and they went for a fight.

849
00:45:56,843 --> 00:46:00,696
So many cocks were brought him to fight these.

850
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:02,699
So these two were standing there,

851
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:05,325
they would no attack anyone, just standing.

852
00:46:05,526 --> 00:46:07,559
Everybody was attacking, they were just standing.

853
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,359
Everybody got frightened, all the,

854
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,072
all the cocks got frightened and ran away.

855
00:46:12,273 --> 00:46:15,426
And these two were standing there nicely.

856
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:21,455
You should not attack anyone, nor anybody would attack you.

857
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,935
Yes, they are there, but quite alright.

858
00:46:25,136 --> 00:46:26,797
But I am not frightened of them.

859
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:30,827
So far nobody has been successful.

860
00:46:41,525 --> 00:46:47,265
P: I request Mataji, if Mataji can explain how to raise the Kundalini,

861
00:46:47,466 --> 00:46:50,312
that may help the guests also.

862
00:46:50,513 --> 00:46:54,472
Explain how to raise the Kundalini.
P: Yes

863
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:07,228
He wants to know how the Kundalini is raised.

864
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:11,084
As they explained the, yesterday in German language,

865
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:15,117
that at the base of our spine,

866
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:18,662
there is a power lying there,

867
00:47:18,863 --> 00:47:22,226
which is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

868
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:24,956
And the Spirit lies in the heart

869
00:47:25,157 --> 00:47:28,078
which is the reflection of God Almighty.

870
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:33,578
So the power of God is the Holy Ghost, is a female power,

871
00:47:33,779 --> 00:47:38,715
because God is a male,

872
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:43,519
then He has a son. There has to be a Mother to the son.

873
00:47:45,486 --> 00:47:47,862
They didn't want to have a woman there, imagine.

874
00:47:48,063 --> 00:47:50,689
We cannot have women for...

875
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,185
They cannot be ordained. This is too much.

876
00:47:53,386 --> 00:47:55,224
It's not in India like this, you see.

877
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,330
You don't find this kind of a nonsense there

878
00:47:57,531 --> 00:48:00,380
but is here that women have accepted, though you are so advanced.

879
00:48:00,596 --> 00:48:03,351
There, here it is so stupid that women cannot become priests.

880
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:06,365
Why can't they if the men can be?

881
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:10,859
So, this, to avoid the women from the whole thing,

882
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:16,213
they called It a Holy Ghost, without telling that it's a female.

883
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:18,825
And that female power is the Shakti

884
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:22,060
which resides in the triangular bone.

885
00:48:22,284 --> 00:48:29,855
Now, what happens, that when a person who is authorised,

886
00:48:30,056 --> 00:48:33,936
in a way that a person who is a realised soul,

887
00:48:35,144 --> 00:48:40,697
is faced by such a person, then the Kundalini spontaneously rises.

888
00:48:40,898 --> 00:48:48,505
Just like in the womb of the Mother Earth if you put any seed,

889
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:53,328
spontaneously it sprouts because it's a living process.

890
00:48:53,573 --> 00:48:56,545
And it passes through the six chakras.

891
00:48:56,746 --> 00:48:59,770
The seventh is the last chakra, which is the pelvic,

892
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:01,472
which helps the pelvic plexus.

893
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:03,924
So it doesn't play any part,

894
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:07,990
means sex does not play any part in this. You become like a child.

895
00:49:08,191 --> 00:49:10,516
And the Kundalini passes through six centres

896
00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:12,767
ultimately the sixth one is here,

897
00:49:12,968 --> 00:49:18,152
which we call as Sahasrara, meaning thousand petaled lotus.

898
00:49:18,353 --> 00:49:20,589
But actually it is the limbic area,

899
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:25,166
and at the apex of limbic area here, at the fontanel bone area,

900
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:26,658
It pierces through,

901
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:28,320
and you actually start feeling

902
00:49:28,521 --> 00:49:30,907
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

903
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:33,002
Actually start feeling like that.

904
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:36,274
So, it just sprouts by itself,

905
00:49:36,425 --> 00:49:39,247
it is a spontaneous happening.

906
00:49:43,115 --> 00:49:45,676
Did you understand?

907
00:49:45,877 --> 00:49:49,093
You are from the country of Krishna, You should know many things.

908
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:52,242
After coming here, you people have forgotten God.

909
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:54,261
Is it true or not?
