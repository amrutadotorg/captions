00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:14.140
The love of Sahaj Yogis is so overwhelming that I cant find words what to talk…

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:30.400
You might be knowing that today in whole world the Sahaj Yogis are heading towards their evolution.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:46.940
Many Sahaj Yogis have reached a very high state, the source of joy flows in them.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:58.500
Some of them became subtle and are active in a special way.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:09.200
But in every country I see that they have their own style or conditionings… human being is everywhere same…

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.280
and Sahaj Yoga is an innate state of being which has no relation from outside.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:38.720
Still, the ‘Attention’ which is a form of the nature, which we know as Kundalini…

00:01:38.720 --> 00:02:00.980
has the tape record of all the countries you have been through, all the births you have taken, the ways through which you passed and whatever states you have experienced…

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:09.500
this is the reason I see that every country’s human being is little different.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:19.860
Its very surprising that human being catches so strongly to whatever is ‘illusion’….

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.200
and to catch the truth how much he is arrogant. He is so lethargic…

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.300
with such difficulty he accepts it… but very badly he keeps sticking to the untruth.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.420
That’s why it is so surprising for me.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:53.260
In the beginning I used to think that human being considers his name, village, position

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:06.120
and all these degrees as important, but it is amazing to see that how deeply it affects.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.980
As soon as it all gets vanished….

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.800
As soon as all this illusion gets erased… we make our attention lighter and lighter.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.620
In Sahaj Yoga this ‘ attention’ goes and unites with the God.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.760
This ‘attention’ gets dissolved in the omnipresent enlightened Param Chaitanya.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.920
This same human attention which we consider as form of nature,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.860
this flower which is the part of nature gets dipped in the ocean of Divine love!

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:58.120
But sometimes it is amazing to see that this human attention is so heavy…so scattered…

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.340
There is only one way to recognize sahaj yoga is that how much joy you are in,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.680
how much peace you are in, and how much love you are into…

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.760
The people who are living in illusion cannot get Sahaj Yoga.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.020
What can be done through my hard work?

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:26.980
Is that I can take your Kundalini on mine and leave you there but you always drop it…

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:35.160
You cannot even enjoy where I take you to.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.060
In every country there are different type of problems.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.220
We must first understand what is the problem of our country, because first of all we should know our own problem.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.540
And what is the problem of other country also should be understood.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:01.540
Like, recently in U.K I have started my work, very slowly, I have taken very few people in my hands.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:09.660
I didn’t want to take many people, I thought first at least to establish twenty five people who should be established in Sahaj Yoga.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.600
You will be surprised to know that those people are very great souls!

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.100
They have eternal faith in Sahaj Yoga, they understand that there is no other cure except Sahaj Yoga.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:29.400
After reaching the final stage, Sahaj Yoga is extremely ‘dynamic’ thing.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:39.240
And if there is any program of Sahaj Yoga, then there is nothing else greater and important for them.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.340
And for hours they will be involved in it….

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.740
As if don’t know what is this thing which came from God which is to be given to this world….

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.640
And the truth is that, ‘It Is’!! no doubt about it,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:03.520
but even after knowing this truth , I wont call it their fault

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:11.800
but the reason for their shortcoming is that they did not get birth in Yoga Bhoomi (Land of Yoga) of India.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.200
Don’t know why God gave birth to such great people on that bhoga bhoomi (Land of Materialism)

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.220
and you people have got birth on this Yoga Bhoomi.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:30.920
That bhoga bhoomi where they have no culture.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.800
They don’t even know if they have to wear sindoor (kumkum) on the forehead or on the nose.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.060
They don’t know the protocols of Puja, they don’t know the protocol of praying…

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:52.920
they have no knowledge about God.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.700
They don’t know even how to sit on the ground.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:05.300
They don’t know anything, they don’t even know how to give claps while performing the ‘Aarti’.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:21.640
And such great souls… so innate they are… so loving…they love me so much… such respect they have towards me.. that I am surprised.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.280
Whenever they walk in front of me, in fact they don’t, but whenever they pass they bow and pass with their head bent down.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.800
They love me so much that anything in this whole world has no meaning for them in front of me.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:45.900
They have such deep feeling for me that they don’t know how should they respect me, in what way.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.920
I am surprised that how they have so much understanding of all this about me. But for themselves they are so much upset, they are behind themselves with a stick.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.720
I told them that, “ you can shoe beat yourself 108 times’

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.220
but they do it thrice 108 times… wherever they get chance they start shoe beating themselves.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:06.560
They say that we want to scold ourselves. I did not hear from them anything else about others individually,

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.860
no complaints about anyone, nothing, but only about themselves they think and speak,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.860
and for other person they say, “ He is such a nice person that I feel shame on myself in front of him”

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.720
They don’t look at the other person in wrong way.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.540
They just look at themselves as wrong.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:26.600
You will be really surprised that all the time they are behind themselves with a stick.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.560
Here (in India) I see that all the vision is outside, just opposite.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.660
Such dedication they have that when I was coming, there were tears flowing from their eyes,

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.940
I tried, but their tears didn’t stop.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:47.620
So much Sahaj and simple is their feeling…

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:57.640
Till now I could only get around 21 people like them.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:05.520
But, they are deep, what we call as genuine..

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.700
they themselves come and say that we are not genuine…

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:16.640
as if somebody is coming and telling me that I am not genuine.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.840
“Mother, I have this fault, I have that mistake and untruthy within me…I am carrying untruth within me…”

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.600
they say it with completely opened heart.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:38.040
And they don’t feel shy for it… to call themselves bad they don’t feel shy… but they don’t judge others.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.920
And they also tell me about the reasons why they are like this.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.120
They will come and say, “ I am like this because My Father was like this, this thing happened and so…psychologically it is like this so I am doing like this.”

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:55.380
they tell the reason why they did something wrong, because it happened so at that time, that’s why I am doing like this.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.980
One or two people also come who have lot of badhas (negativities). They work hard and are quiet.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:11.220
They don’t speak anything but say that, “ please let all the untruth get out of me, may be something is still hiding within me” they are so much deep in silence within.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:19.060
But they have this problem that they don’t know how to do Puja, how to worship, poor people don’t even understand how to do it….

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:24.500
I told them that I don’t even send any money to you still how you manage?

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.080
Once I told them that I like this bread very much.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.040
So every time they came they brought same bread for me.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.960
I told them: “Who will eat so many breads?”

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.300
I just said, but they don’t understand how to surrender, how to give.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:51.480
They are very well educated and intellectuals, they have read all your scriptures and literature.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.860
So its not difficult to make them understand Sahaj Yoga.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.300
They say that, Sahaj Yoga is the process of getting to subtle from gross state.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.600
They have written an introductory book about me.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:09.040
You wont believe it, they brought all the philosophers of the world and put them on Mother’s feet…

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:16.400
They say, “They are nothing… these philosophers raised only questions, but Mother has answered all questions!!”

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:24.320
They praise their fate and say that we are so fortunate to have Mother…

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:32.780
One day Sahaj Yoga is going to reach a very great height and recognition.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:39.240
You are my foundations.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.980
Imagine how strong the foundation stones have to be.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.560
First thing bring in your attention“Are we genuine?”

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.480
look at yourself, not on others… Look at yourself! Am I genuine?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.960
Look, they even don’t know how to pronounce the mantras, they cant even say “Shri Krishna”

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.940
with lot of difficulty they are able to pronounce ‘Radha Krishna’.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:10.440
For you it is so easy… that you can cleanse your Vishuddhi. You just say ‘Radha Krishna’ and its cured…

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:16.120
Now, they cant pronounce clearly ‘Radha Krishna’, so Shri Krishna gets little angry on it.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:24.060
Their pronunciation is also not all right, but, with you its easy and you can awaken him easily.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.360
They don’t know how to put kumkum. They don’t know what is kumkum for.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:38.320
They don’t know how to offer flowers, they don’t know how to make Shri Ganesha, they don’t know how to make swastika, every time they make it reverse.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.940
They never knew all these things.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:50.640
But even being so much surrendered and devoted, they are unable to achieve what you people have achieved.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:13:09.460
You have received a lot, but its value, still very few have understood deep within.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:16.060
Not that I have not given them Sahaj, not that I have not given them free of cost…

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:23.080
I have given them same as you people have got from me.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.120
But, the Love they have for me is so unlimited.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.860
It seems that they have understood my relation with them since many births but you people have not yet been able to understand it.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:40.420
Why are you so limited to yourself?

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:51.140
Being cells of same body, being part and parcel of same body, still you feel each other as separate and different.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:59.600
And there, no question of teamwork raises, they solve it among themselves.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:15.480
One boy there started smoking. All of them just got behind him.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.800
They made him all right in such a way that he left smoking.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:31.120
They corrected all his arguments, helped him in every way, as soon as they saw him smoking, they used to call him, sit with him.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:38.120
Went to their home and took all the packets out where ever they found and hid them.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.340
It wasn’t cigarette smoking, it was something else, what you call it…drug.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.040
And they said that if you continue then we will inform in Police.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:51.200
And, that boy did not feel bad about it, he said that please you do something about it.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:15:05.740
That boy himself said and used to run to them and say “ please save me, that desire is approaching me, please save me, anyhow”.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:15.300
So much hard work they are doing to correct themselves.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.640
Here (in India) your society itself is corrected one!

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.180
You don’t know in what heavenly land you are living in.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.220
there they don’t know about mother or sister…

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:37.260
Such a filth and dirty is there… every house there is liquor… drinking…

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.860
such bad relations they have… Nothing like family, don’t know about mother, don’t know about father.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.760
You ask someone what about your mother? He will say, “ don’t know, she has married someone else and gone”.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.480
Characterless… everyone with damaged Mooladhara.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.260
Even being born in such country they came with Shri Ganesha to me… “

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:21.480
Mother please give us innocence” they broke the head in front of Shri Ganesha, catching ears…asking for forgiveness… and a bravery in it.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:39.720
They are so much aware of themselves and also about others. is truth.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:46.920
They told about so many miracles and experiences of Sahaj Yoga.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.360
You have got one letter which I sent.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.320
It was all of them who found that thing out about me.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.780
About me they found out the fact.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:13.400
Still, you people could not understand it and haven’t seen it, but they could.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.200
They understood that yes it is like this, this is it… to say it is Mahamaya but within us it

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.620
They have not achieved what you have.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:32.060
But they have put everything for it, all their efforts, they have understood that the time of evolution has come and Sat Yuga is standing on the door.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.360
They know that if this door wont open then destruction could not be stopped.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:45.620
And they feel responsible for it, they feel that everyone has to be responsible that we have to do it.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.060
They are responsible for Sahaj Yoga. No one can dare to speak against Sahaj Yoga.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:58.840
They don’t speak against Sahaj among themselves, but if someone else speaks then they just take him to task and make him understand what it is.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:08.780
If I tell them that 24 hours you sit without food, they will…!!!

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.780
But, it does not mean that you people are less than that.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:23.340
Some of you have achieved the heights and state, its extraordinary.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:34.920
But that feeling of achieving is the problem about self.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:41.360
There is a meaning in keeping the attention steady.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.040
It doesn’t mean that you look here or there.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:51.600
The attention is steady only when all the dirt over it gets cleansed.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.740
When it becomes light.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.980
There is a very big curse on our country (India).

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:10.240
It’s a very deeply located within us and that I call as ‘Sin against the Father’.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:17.740
We have committed sin against our Father in heaven.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.300
What is it?

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.160
It is all the time thinking that “we are poor, we have poverty.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:32.280
We don’t have money, how will it go like this…what about my stomach… all these beggar like thinking.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:38.440
How will we pull on with money, what will happen to my children?

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:52.580
If you have faith in God then at least leave this to him that he will give you food, otherwise what is there to have faith in God

00:19:52.580 --> 00:20:00.220
that even he cannot give you food and look after your needs.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:05.000
This is very great sin we are doing.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:15.300
If we leave this food and all arrangements on God, then Indians can achieve very great height.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:24.000
There are two kinds of Sin. One is to doubt on the fatherhood of the father, and second I call as ‘Sin against the Mother’ that is there in West

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:37.060
in which there is immorality, indulgences, materialism, comfort and to get totally free… out of control, this is the problem there.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.540
Both the ways lead you straight to hell.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:49.320
Doing anything for Money, whatever wrong you have to do to make money… its all right.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.660
This is the sin of Indians.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.320
I am not talking about government. I am talking about God about the kingdom of God.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:02.880
When you are in the Kingdom of God then, he will give if he desires or he will not if he doesnt…

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.000
what’s the problem in at least having this attitude within?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.720
He will do if he will and he will not if he wont…

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:17.000
“ As you keep me, I shall be” if a Sahaj yogi just has this feeling within that “ As you will keep me, I shall live!!!,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.740
let me see how you will keep me” you can just enjoy everything.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:31.080
You just start enjoying it… you say, “ let me see how you will keep me, you will keep me hungry?

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:38.100
O.K let me see how many days you will keep me starving!!!” “As you will let me live, I shall live!!!

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:44.520
You make me walk, I will…, make me sit on horse, I will…., you will get into this bliss and joy….!!!!!

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.940
You people are lucky to have been born in this great country that rest everything is all right,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:56.300
your parents are all right, your wife and children are all right, you are moral… most of you.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:06.080
Some of you are… But not so bad… it can be corrected.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.940
There is so much sin, the other one, that everybody’s eyes just keep moving…like this…

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.220
this… all the time, of every man and woman… its such a negativity in them.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.920
Transmitting the negativity to each other through eyes.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.780
One woman goes, she looks on men, then the men look on women, then other,… it just goes on there like this… I said what is this?

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.280
they said, ‘ Mother what to do here everyone gets this negativity in eyes.. what to do?”

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:30.400
I said, “keep your eyes to the ground.” How was Shri Lakshmana, he only used to see the feet of Shri Sita.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:39.760
Keep the eyes low. Gradually all these badhas will go away spontaneously. If you will not do all this then what will that negativity do living in you?

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:47.300
That bhoot which is playing through you and doing all this and using you, will run away by itself.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:54.600
If you don’t move your eyes here and there then that bhoot will just run away from you.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.240
And, till you will keep moving your eyes, the bhoots will keep sitting there in you.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:06.780
They accepted it… and now when they walk on the street they walk with eyes like this on the mother earth… low… this is obedience…

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.260
Mother said and it is accepted and agreed!!

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:16.260
These are the sign of true children.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.840
It is for your benevolence, for your wellbeing.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:26.400
You must understand this, that whatever you have got in sahaj yoga, you have to achieve it in this life itself.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.600
I have to achieve it, not the other… I have to… not others,

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.460
leave of others, don’t worry about others, look within,

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:41.200
how much I have achieved the state till now, how profound and deep I have gone in sahaj yoga?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.640
How am I behaving with myself, why am I acting with myself? Why am I cheating myself?

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:57.200
Why am I lying to myself? Why am I torturing myself? What have I got?

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.460
Look….. all the treasure is opened for you… just come in….

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:08.500
no matter how you are, just come in, get inside.. I will give you bath and make you sit cleansed.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:14.140
Then what to think? How deep have we got inside the cool wave of Ganga?

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.340
It is just flowing completely… “take whatever you want…take it my child…”

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.100
how much pitcher we have filled? Our attention is just scattered and running here and there…

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:29.780
the moment you will have look within, you will understand that it is you who has cheated yourself,

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.920
no one else. This is a very big gap. It is harmful for sahaj yoga.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.600
Not to keep attention toward self is the most harmful thing in Sahaj Yoga.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.540
And this introspection is only in that person’s nature who had been seeking since many lives….

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:51.560
And knows that because of my mistakes I could not get it till now, so I wont commit mistakes anymore.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.640
Its like you are closed in a dark house and can’t see the way to get out of it.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.940
The one who has broken his head by striking against the walls in darkness knows and thinks…

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:08.180
No, look towards the door…keep the attention towards the door.. to the way to the door.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:13.660
He doesn’t know anything else but knows and says…

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:25.340
yes, I know, I have got it, the vibrations are flowing from within… My Sahasrara is pierced and I have known the truth!!!

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.760
And his face is towards the door… he is catching that door

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:40.580
and then if Mother says anything then it is not that “ I don’t believe or I don’t agree..” whatever Mother is saying, every word is truth!

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:50.940
And the moment they say this.. all the wisdom starts flowing through them.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.140
Your baithak (sitting) should be perfect.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.920
It should be strong.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:05.440
I cant even tell them about baithak. They don’t even know this word.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.880
English language is useless…

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:16.740
They don’t have any culture of that sort, no talks like this.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.260
So unfortunate they are…

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.400
Here you have sages and saints. You people are so fortunate.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:32.960
I took birth in your country. On this Yoga Bhoomi I was born.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:41.160
But you have to see what you have got, not what others have got or did not get, what others say, where others are… nothing to do with this.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.360
What have you achieved and got. The moment you will get it, you will become surrendered to God.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.480
What are you? you are just a little part within Him, isn’t it?

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:55.880
I have told you hundred times that I need 1000 people who can sit on this Sahasrara.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:05.820
I need 1000 people to sit on horse who never get caught. Is it difficult.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:12.460
Those who are detached…

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:19.040
If you are doing something for Sahaj Yoga, you are doing for yourself.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:26.820
If there is someone who says that I went to the market and purchased so much gold for myself, so many things and did shopping.. I worked so hard.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:33.500
Whatever you worked hard, whatever you did, it is for yourself, isn’t it?

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.000
Not for anyone else.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:47.480
You have seen, that whatever you have done till now, you are enjoying the benefits of it.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:53.360
There were so many people till now in this world who could achieve.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:02.240
One or two were there in every Yuga (era) you have met, seen and known, so many people in this world, how many are realized?

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:07.120
Very few you will find.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:18.600
And today it is great naad (sound) of Kali Yuga… There are so many animals today… The animals without tails.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:32.300
But in this Kali Yuga itself, in this dirty mud a great work has to be accomplished, you know it is happening…

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:43.400
in this time, you must take as much as you can.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.360
Otherwise you will be thrown out of this evolutionary process.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.240
That time is not far away, I told about it. In 1979.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.980
That till 1979 this work has to be done and by the year 1999 Satya Yuga (the era of truth) will get fully matured.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:02.180
Now it depends on your wisdom, otherwise Kali Yuga will also flourish because of you only.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:10.540
If you people wont like to work it out then the responsibility of destruction will be on your head…

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:44.160
use your wisdom in such a way, bring your intellect to wisdom and think that ‘ what have I taken from Ganga? What did I achieved and what have I to yet get?’

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:51.020
you have got so much joy and still you have to get much more.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:55.840
You must keep remembering that moment of what you have got.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:02.800
And you must tell your mind that “I have to be always in that moment (of realisation)”. You will get sticked to it.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.440
And rest all useless thoughts which are coming, just stop them.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.200
It is not prohibited to anyone of any age.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:22.440
It is not restricted to the person of any colour or complexion, it is not restricted for the person of any state or caste.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:30.740
But most of the people are cutting their own feet with their own hands.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:34.420
Making groups.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:44.080
I don’t understand what should I say for all this… how are you separate and different from each other?

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:51.820
If I move my finger here, everyone’s Sahasrara gets activated.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.540
If I shake my feet a little… it just can be felt on everyone’s Sahasrara.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.140
How are you different and other.. that you keep talking as separate individuals.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.520
Don’t you understand it?

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.760
You cannot be separate.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:15.080
It is just like you break one hand and take it away and that hand says that Oh! I am doing such a great job!

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:24.740
I am very sad to be united with this body, so I must get away…

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.640
it is something about instinct.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:36.640
When the human being desires its own death then he starts doing all this.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:58.080
But, that person who could understand that you are part and parcel of one ‘collective personality’ On that very moment everything gets solved.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:08.980
You know that you are…you are aware of it.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:15.960
All sahaj yogis know this. Anyone who comes from England, from America or from India, he will talk same…

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:23.760
that Agnya is catching or heart or anything else… others cannot know about it.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:29.800
They even don’t know this language of our’s. It’s a new language!! Have you ever thought of it?

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:36.340
Immediately you come to know, what is the problem, what is catching… what is the depth of the person… whatever is happening.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:44.500
The only difference is that because our attention is not on self, so we cant see what’s problem within us but can see what is problem in other very clearly.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:53.160
It is same like this hand is getting rotten and the other hand is not bothered about it,

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:59.340
then that hand will get senseless and what will this hand get out of it?

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:13.560
No one has to fall down, and also not the other should fall down, but first thing is that you should not fall down.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:20.220
It is working and is activated all the time all around enveloping… what we call as unconscious!

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:32.360
То, что называется пранав (божественное дыхание), то, что Я называю What is called as pranav (divine breath) to what I call as ‘Divine Love’ is all around…for helping you, circling around you.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:40.300
Bhairavnath is sitting here, Hanumanaji is sitting here…

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:44.460
there are thousands of them with you, working hard on you, for you.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:54.740
This experience and Realization which you have got, how many could get it till today? Tell me…

00:33:54.740 --> 00:34:03.020
Might have been great sages and great saints, could anyone know so clearly about ‘Collective Consciousness’ how much you people know?

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:16.040
No matter how many books you read. And those great sadhus (sages) and saints ask me that, ‘for what have you given them this, what for?’

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.880
It’s a very great thing… I have given you birth on My Sahasrara!!

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:31.240
I have not given them this… I came on them but to you people I gave you place in my heart but have given you birth through My Sahasrara. Such great state you are in!

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.720
I have not even given birth to Shri Ganesha like this as I have given to you!!

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:43.200
Its something special…with immense love I have nourished and given to you.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:49.000
Love thyself, when you will love yourself then you will shed away your faults and weaknesses.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.760
As you like this sari… you see there is something wrong…

00:34:54.760 --> 00:35:07.460
you take it out and make it all right… whatever you love anything you try to make it all right… to keep it perfectly all right.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:13.340
And whatever you don’t love…you abandon it.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.460
I have loved you so much, how much have you loved yourself?

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.420
Be loving towards yourself!

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:40.300
I am looking forward to that day when this wave will become synchronized as one thread!

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:47.840
Now you people have no doubts on it, because you have felt vibrations. No one is doubtful about it.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:57.740
Whatever Mother is saying is truth we know because we can feel it through vibrations, so no doubts should be there.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:13.360
Some of you have reached there to that state.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:25.200
Look at them who have raised to those heights, that level…and head towards that direction.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:31.740
You will be just pulled up!! Like the fishes are pulled on one single net…

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:41.600
same way you will be pulled… but first keep strangled in that net of Love! You should not come out of the net of Mother’s Love.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.620
Don’t use your brains into it… I know how much intellect and brain you have.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:50.480
Did you know where is Kundalini and all this… you knew nothing, isn’t it?

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:57.360
Some of you are even elder to me are aged than me in age, but I am million years old.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:07.380
How can you be elder than me? You are my son, my child…

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:15.580
I wish that you all should get into this ocean of joy and work it out for whole world.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.860
Just a little you need a push, a little effort and the boat will get across!!

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:25.100
It is just moving little left and right, going forward and backward…

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:36.600
Still I don’t say that the boat of sahaj has gone across, you people keep pulling it, pulling it here and some are pulling it there….

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:43.280
The boat has to be brought across to the shore. But the ‘Groupism’ is not to be done.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:50.240
“This man is not good, that man is not good, he did this, he did that…” No one will tell me all these complaints.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:58.440
I know each and everyone inside out! I am not going to listen to anyone’s complaints.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.560
You just keep watching where you were and where you have reached and where you have to reach further. That’s all.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:08.200
When you are walking on your way, do you keep saying all this? You just keep saying:

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.840
“ when will I reach there, when will I reach there, when will I reach”.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:23.180
First throw that out which is torturing you within… leave everything behind and move…

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.780
leave every second behind you…leave every past moment behind you and stand on this very second… it is the question of getting inside!

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:37.440
I am sitting here to push you all there. But all of you don’t fall on my head… two or four will fall, it’s all right…

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.420
What argument can be in Sahaj Yoga?

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:46.980
If your heart is caught, it is caught, if your Agnya is caught, it is caught… nothing to argue…you have to accept.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:52.620
What is there to feel bad about it? If it is caught, it is caught…

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.340
If you have to get rid of it, you have to get rid… that’s all.

00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:01.760
If you get cancer and go to the doctor and he says “you got cancer”… will you beat the doctor?

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:10.220
You will say: “All right if it is so, I have cancer so please cure me now… make me all right.”

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:17.720
Same way if your Agnya is catching, the how can you say, No Mother, how can it be, its not caught…

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:25.840
If it is caught then you have to get rid of it. Whatever is negative within has to be taken out… that’s all, finished…!

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.580
Can’t you understand such simple straight thing… what is there to argue and what to say?

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.640
If by saying or arguing someone’s Agnya chakra gets all right then try it.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:39.760
It is not going to work out with talks…

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:48.460
it is subtlest of the subtle Love which works out.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.420
Those who have got realization… have they got by your arguments?

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:58.060
By your speeches or by the books they have or written or you have read? How did it happen then?

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:08.280
It was like a miracle and spontaneously…in second you got realization…

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:16.520
Gagangarh Maharaj used to say that, “What is this Mother? That’s you just came and everyone’s Kundalini got awakened!!

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:23.360
Not even single person Gagangarh maharaj gave realisation and thousands of his disciples are ready to give life for him.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:44.460
(NO translation)

00:40:44.460 --> 00:41:00.320
How many of you are ready to give life for me? I don’t want it… you have to just take out what’s negative in you…. just this… that’s all.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:44:04.360
(No translation)

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:12.260
Here our children will also get spoilt like this because we are ourselves half baked.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:21.220
There are so many nice children in India… but even they have got jealousy and hatred in their mind through parents…

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:28.820
they get spoilt by listening to the talks of parents all the time.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:41.280
But there it is not so… they are such strong children that they even stand against their parents who are wrong.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:47.680
All those children are getting ready and prepared. In next 10 years those children will get ready.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:57.800
And in your house also such children will come. There are… many.. Those who are standing on their feet, firm. As soon as they will grow they will stand on their feet.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.580
No need to teach them sahaj yoga, they are all already learnt, they are my own.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:08.100
But I would again say that you people from Bombay are the foundation stones.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:14.260
Everyone says that people grow very slowly in Sahaj Yoga.. It is spreading very slowly.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:21.580
The reason for it is that they see you people and say, may God save me are they sahaj yogis? We don’t want such sahaj Yoga.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:27.980
By seeing you people Sahaj Yoga is going to spread…

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:32.260
Many people told me that we must add the organization to name…

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:37.040
like sahaj yogi Amte, sahaj yogi Tamte, I said, “no” otherwise it will get stick…

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.300
we can’t add this to anyone’s name.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:49.300
They said: why? I told them that this is like today you are graduate and tomorrow you will be a donkey totally.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:46:00.300
Today you are on sky and tomorrow below ground. We are not to give any degree to anyone, if you give a degree then it will be just difficult.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:07.680
So now I have come, and now you think and tell Me what all you have to work out further. Go home and think about it.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:15.120
Taken a months leave, now there are going to be programs in coming two three days, let me see what talents you show in it.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:21.200
Sit in meditation… sit in meditation for three days.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:34.820
Go in meditation and say that, who all will come for meditation, what all will they do in meditation, in collectivity…

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:41.340
put your attention on them. Put attention on them whom you know personally. You attention has all that power.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:47.220
Take that attention, use it… that ‘he can come, they must come, they should come…’

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.920
put your attention, give bandhan for them to bring them to program.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:47:02.180
Also give bandhan to yourself after reaching home. The blessing of God will come on you!

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:12.220
Don’t identify yourself with anyone else… that he is my this relation and he lives there… etc.. they are mine and this thing wrong happened with him… Not this.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:22.220
But, “What can I do for Sahaj Yoga, this person should come, from there they should come, those people should come…” put your attention…

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:29.060
On your attention is the Shakti…. Shakti is sitting on your attention.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:33.100
If you will put it on wrong things or mundane things then it will just sleep.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:38.240
If you will put it in Sahaj Yoga then it will awaken and shine.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:52.840
I met him, I talked to him, I cured him… sit down today in meditation and take your attention on all of them.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:59.780
You are not going to talk to me anything other than Sahaj Yoga, I am not going to listen to anything else. Its enough…

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:05.600
my wife ran away, my husband ran away…my child got this… etc… I am not going to listen to this from Sahaj Yogis.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.200
He told me this, he scolded me, he troubles me… all this… I am not going to listen to.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:20.200
And those who have to talk all this or tell me all this should leave Sahaj Yoga.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:28.900
The one who has to enjoy the bliss… should come here, the one who has to enjoy love should come here, the one who has to enjoy the whole world should come here.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:34.780
All the property of joy which God has made for you is flowing on you, if you have to take it, then come here.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:47.860
And you all are the leaders. You are the leaders of that Sat Yuga (era of truth) which is going to come. Go to the history…

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:56.680
If you are not going to be important for this, then please don’t come here. I am saying this for the first time to you.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:04.200
The one who has to achieve, the one who has to get should individually come, not as a group. Individually.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.380
And when individually you will get inside it then you will become like a drop when becomes Ocean.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.540
Otherwise you will carry the dirt of everyone along with you.

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:20.040
You must decide that except Sahaj Yoga I will not talk anything else with anyone… no discussions, arguments, etc.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:25.080
You are so many… I never got so many people in any incarnation as many as you all are.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:32.120
So many!! And with their help the boat will go across.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:44.920
So, it’s my prayer and request to you…that if really I have loved you and have given love to you,

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:53.720
then when the fruit is to come then you wont have to do any stupidity. Of any kind. You must get maturity… don’t act childish.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:59.920
And those who talk childish, you must say “ Keep quiet” and don’t listen to them.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:18.420
Talk like matured elders… You have become matured fruits. Be silent within… and enjoy!!

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:30.080
Break all illusions and differences… and the blood of life will start flowing within you… and will fill you with joy, peace and bliss!!
