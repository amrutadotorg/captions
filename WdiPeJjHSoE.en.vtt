WEBVTT

07:21.041 --> 07:24.041
The question was asked Me,

07:24.250 --> 07:28.625
“What Puja we are going to have today?”

07:29.875 --> 07:32.875
And I kept it a secret.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.917
Today we should worship

07:43.125 --> 07:45.750
the Paramachaitanya,

07:45.959 --> 07:49.834
the All-Pervading Power of God’s Love.

08:01.792 --> 08:04.208
We are aware

08:05.458 --> 08:08.999
that Paramachaitanya

08:10.625 --> 08:13.166
does everything.

08:14.583 --> 08:17.291
At least mentally we know

08:17.500 --> 08:20.500
that everything is worked out

08:21.125 --> 08:24.041
by the grace of Paramachaitanya,

08:24.250 --> 08:28.333
which is the power of the Adi Shakti.

08:29.208 --> 08:32.208
But still,

08:33.709 --> 08:38.667
it is not so much in our heart,

08:45.875 --> 08:49.625
so much in our attention.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.458
We can consider Paramachaitanya

08:56.667 --> 08:59.375
like a ocean,

09:00.959 --> 09:06.000
like a ocean which contains everything within itself.

09:07.125 --> 09:10.667
Everything, all the working,

09:12.125 --> 09:17.041
everything, is within its own limits.

09:17.250 --> 09:22.041
So it cannot be compared with anything. You cannot compare it.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.667
Now, if you see the sun,

09:26.417 --> 09:29.750
then from the sun

09:29.959 --> 09:34.250
the rays have to come out, to work it.

09:36.625 --> 09:40.625
If you see somebody,

09:42.667 --> 09:46.291
say, a person

09:47.291 --> 09:50.250
who has an authority,

09:52.500 --> 09:56.500
he has to assert that power -

09:57.333 --> 09:59.625
outside.

09:59.875 --> 10:02.959
So within himself

10:03.208 --> 10:06.000
he doesn’t work it out.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.041
Say, for example, if there’s a seed

10:20.083 --> 10:22.250
and inside the seed only

10:22.625 --> 10:27.250
the tree grows, and the fruits come out, and

10:28.125 --> 10:30.875
then they are sold, and people eat it, and

10:31.041 --> 10:34.583
everything is inside that seed.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.959
Then that is Paramachaitanya.

10:41.542 --> 10:47.999
So we are all enveloped in it.

10:49.875 --> 10:53.834
And only the waves that we see,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.917
and we are on the waves,

10:57.083 --> 11:00.834
so we see it as

11:01.000 --> 11:05.166
dislocated, separated.

11:05.709 --> 11:10.250
Like we feel “this is Germany”

11:12.291 --> 11:16.417
or “this is England, this is India.”

11:16.667 --> 11:21.500
These are just folds of the sari

11:22.166 --> 11:24.208
of Paramachaitanya

11:24.417 --> 11:27.041
which look separated,

11:27.709 --> 11:30.583
but they are not separated.

11:31.667 --> 11:35.000
They are continuous.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.625
So the connection is absolutely complete.

11:42.083 --> 11:45.375
If I pull a thread from here,

11:45.583 --> 11:49.709
the thread will throughout be pulled.

11:52.792 --> 11:56.709
In the same manner, this Paramachaitanya

11:59.750 --> 12:03.500
is working within itself.

12:05.750 --> 12:09.583
And there is nothing without.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.291
So, when you are Sahaja Yogis,

12:20.417 --> 12:23.875
it pays special attention to you.

12:24.125 --> 12:28.250
Or, I should say, it becomes absolutely

12:28.792 --> 12:30.917
one with you.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.458
Whatever you desire,

12:33.667 --> 12:36.834
whatever you want,

12:37.000 --> 12:40.542
also will be coming from the same Paramachaitanya,

12:40.750 --> 12:43.625
if you are one with it.

12:44.875 --> 12:47.750
Like in a, say,

12:49.458 --> 12:52.999
turbulent ocean

12:55.208 --> 12:59.375
some drops of water may fly into the air

12:59.792 --> 13:03.917
and start thinking that “we are above.”

13:05.083 --> 13:09.375
We’re away from the world, away from the ocean.

13:09.583 --> 13:13.375
But again they have to fall into the sea.

13:16.375 --> 13:20.750
So this formless energy,

13:21.750 --> 13:26.875
which has all the intelligence, all the coordination,

13:27.166 --> 13:29.166
all the organizations,

13:29.375 --> 13:31.917
all the computers,

13:33.625 --> 13:35.959
all the televisions,

13:36.625 --> 13:40.667
all that you can think of communication

13:40.875 --> 13:44.291
and of governing, of administration,

13:44.500 --> 13:47.250
and above all,

13:49.667 --> 13:53.000
it is the Love,

13:53.917 --> 13:56.959
it is the Love of God

13:58.291 --> 14:01.875
and Love of your Mother.

14:07.291 --> 14:13.709
So to be one with this Paramachaitanya,

14:16.250 --> 14:19.208
you have to know

14:19.417 --> 14:23.417
that you have to become the reality.

14:28.583 --> 14:33.542
For example, if you take a photograph of Mine, sitting here,

14:36.834 --> 14:42.291
Maybe My photograph might give you living vibrations, all right,

14:44.375 --> 14:47.375
though it’s a photograph.

14:51.834 --> 14:56.999
But, if you take a photograph of somebody else

15:00.667 --> 15:06.208
it will not work out Sahaja Yoga.

15:08.333 --> 15:13.208
The reason is, that somebody else has not become the reality.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.834
It’s like any other painting if you see,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.917
supposing you see a painting

15:20.083 --> 15:23.458
where it is raining.

15:24.083 --> 15:27.083
This rain does not nourish the flowers.

15:27.291 --> 15:29.583
It does not

15:35.625 --> 15:39.667
wet the cloth of the people who are there.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.583
It is static.

15:43.333 --> 15:46.583
So in ignorance,

15:47.667 --> 15:50.041
in ignorance,

15:50.291 --> 15:54.458
we just have the

15:55.999 --> 16:00.917
picture which is static about reality.

16:02.458 --> 16:05.375
And that is the reason why

16:05.583 --> 16:08.834
we think we can work it out

16:09.417 --> 16:12.125
ourselves, everything.

16:13.458 --> 16:18.542
Now if somebody says that, “I see this picture,

16:19.999 --> 16:25.999
all right. And I’ll make the rain as a real thing.”

16:26.208 --> 16:29.709
You cannot. Try anything,

16:30.583 --> 16:32.333
put whatever color you like.

16:32.542 --> 16:35.417
It may appear, it will appear

16:36.000 --> 16:37.375
with effort.

16:37.583 --> 16:42.792
But it will not have the capacity,

16:45.709 --> 16:49.041
nor the nature of reality.

16:51.750 --> 16:55.083
So human beings always deal

16:56.125 --> 17:02.125
with unreal things, thinking they are doing something great.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.667
We can get flowers which are real, of course.

17:06.875 --> 17:09.500
We can feel them.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.208
We can create plastic flowers.

17:15.417 --> 17:19.917
We can create paintings, exactly the same as they are.

17:20.083 --> 17:24.667
But we can’t produce one flower

17:25.625 --> 17:28.333
on our own.

17:34.542 --> 17:38.041
We’ll have to go to reality

17:38.875 --> 17:42.208
is that the Mother Earth is going to produce it,

17:44.250 --> 17:49.125
or the Sun is going to help the Mother Earth.

17:54.166 --> 17:57.875
So all of you Sahaja Yogis

18:00.333 --> 18:02.875
have to know

18:03.458 --> 18:07.834
that in reality you do not do anything

18:08.250 --> 18:11.625
and everything is done by Paramachaitanya.

18:11.999 --> 18:16.750
This is the difference between a non-Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogi.

18:16.959 --> 18:22.000
A non-Sahaja Yogi does not know.

18:23.542 --> 18:28.208
And even if he knows, this is not

18:28.417 --> 18:31.125
the truth in his heart.

18:31.333 --> 18:34.250
It’s not a part and parcel of his being.

18:34.458 --> 18:38.999
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that

18:39.709 --> 18:42.709
reality is Paramachaitanya

18:42.917 --> 18:46.959
and it is reality that works out everything.

18:49.083 --> 18:52.250
And then this reality is

18:52.458 --> 18:55.542
the Divine Love.

18:57.166 --> 19:00.500
We always separate love from action.

19:01.417 --> 19:04.750
To us love means

19:07.166 --> 19:12.500
some sort of a mad behavior towards a person.

19:14.750 --> 19:18.999
It has no technical know-how, how to love.

19:19.834 --> 19:24.250
It works without any understanding.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.875
When we love somebody,

19:29.041 --> 19:32.999
we don’t know, what do we do?

19:33.999 --> 19:36.750
We think we love you.

19:36.959 --> 19:40.166
Tomorrow we start saying, “I hate you.”

19:40.709 --> 19:43.709
So how can it be love?

19:47.542 --> 19:51.542
We love our own children, love our own family,

19:51.750 --> 19:55.250
love our own friends,

19:55.500 --> 19:58.458
which is so unreal.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.250
If it was real,

20:03.500 --> 20:06.208
it would never have failed.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.542
That you cannot definitely say

20:10.750 --> 20:13.333
that, all right, today you’ll work for your son

20:13.542 --> 20:16.250
and be very selfish about your son.

20:16.458 --> 20:18.709
But you can’t say tomorrow how he will treat you

20:18.917 --> 20:21.583
or you’ll treat him.

20:25.542 --> 20:28.583
But Paramachaitanya knows.

20:29.583 --> 20:33.792
It knows how to express its love.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.458
Not only that,

20:37.667 --> 20:42.166
but it’s an eternal feeling of love,

20:44.667 --> 20:48.458
which may change its hue, color,

20:52.083 --> 20:53.834
but

20:55.041 --> 20:59.417
the concern of that love will be the same.

20:59.625 --> 21:03.417
The essence of love is concern.

21:04.458 --> 21:08.041
Even if, supposing, somebody does wrong,

21:08.250 --> 21:11.875
the concern of the Divine would be to correct that person.

21:12.041 --> 21:14.583
Concern.

21:14.959 --> 21:18.208
Or if we say as “Hita”,

21:18.750 --> 21:20.917
is the benevolence.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.709
So the concern for the benevolence

21:23.917 --> 21:26.041
will be all the time there,

21:26.250 --> 21:30.709
whether it may appear to be, sometimes, cruel,

21:30.917 --> 21:33.417
might appear to be affectionate,

21:33.625 --> 21:35.667
might appear to be over-indulgent.

21:35.875 --> 21:39.542
Whatever it may take a form, like a wave.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.959
Whichever way it may look, but actually,

21:44.667 --> 21:47.583
it’s for your benevolence.

21:48.583 --> 21:51.875
It works for your benevolence.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.875
Not only your benevolence,

21:55.041 --> 21:58.750
but the collective benevolence.

22:00.834 --> 22:04.458
And it knows very well what is to be done

22:04.667 --> 22:07.542
how it is to be worked out.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.834
It does not have to go and learn from anywhere

22:13.000 --> 22:16.458
because the complete knowledge of all this know-how

22:16.667 --> 22:19.917
also is within itself.

22:22.834 --> 22:25.999
It’s such a storage

22:27.458 --> 22:32.542
of wisdom, knowledge and love.

22:34.583 --> 22:37.709
So it does not deviate.

22:37.999 --> 22:42.458
Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, the concern

22:44.375 --> 22:47.792
for your benevolence

22:47.999 --> 22:51.250
is all the time there.

22:51.542 --> 22:56.166
Whether you are punished or not is a different point.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.834
Some people might get a job.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.375
Some people will not get a job.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.500
With some people it will work out this way.

23:05.709 --> 23:08.625
With some people it will not work out that way.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.083
Then one may say that, “How is it, this Paramachaitanya

23:11.291 --> 23:13.083
is behaving like this?”

23:13.291 --> 23:15.208
Is all for your correction.

23:15.417 --> 23:18.125
Is a big churning.

23:18.458 --> 23:20.709
Whatever works out for your correction

23:20.917 --> 23:22.959
and is for your benevolence.

23:23.125 --> 23:25.208
If you understand this point,

23:25.417 --> 23:28.917
then you’ll never be disappointed in your life.

23:35.834 --> 23:39.208
And it has no concern

23:39.417 --> 23:41.750
of its own benevolence,

23:41.959 --> 23:45.917
because it is complete benevolence itself.

23:48.709 --> 23:53.000
It never thinks how it is going to be benevolent

23:53.959 --> 23:59.458
or helpful, because it has no botheration about it.

23:59.667 --> 24:03.709
A man, say, who has everything,

24:03.917 --> 24:05.709
worldly things,

24:05.917 --> 24:08.583
still may be concerned about getting more,

24:08.792 --> 24:11.083
the greed, there would be.

24:11.291 --> 24:15.000
But as it is the complete, Purna,

24:16.125 --> 24:18.500
it has no greed.

24:20.375 --> 24:23.625
It’s fully satisfied with itself.

24:24.250 --> 24:27.458
And because it is so powerful,

24:28.083 --> 24:30.417
so knowledgeable,

24:30.625 --> 24:33.792
that it has no doubts,

24:34.500 --> 24:36.959
no doubts of any kind.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.500
And because

24:41.250 --> 24:44.792
there’s nobody which can harm it,

24:45.083 --> 24:48.083
it has no fear.

24:52.375 --> 24:56.083
And you all have now felt

24:56.375 --> 25:00.458
that Paramachaitanya,

25:01.999 --> 25:06.875
should give you a complete fearless life,

25:07.041 --> 25:10.000
a peaceful life,

25:10.542 --> 25:12.750
and a joyous life.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.166
Like a child who finds his mother, then he stops crying,

25:20.208 --> 25:22.417
no more, now he’s found his mother.

25:22.625 --> 25:26.625
In the same way you have found Paramachaitanya

25:26.834 --> 25:29.625
and the connection with it.

25:29.959 --> 25:34.000
So you don’t have to worry for anything,

25:34.792 --> 25:36.583
don’t have to think about anything,

25:36.792 --> 25:39.250
you don’t have to plan about anything,

25:39.625 --> 25:41.875
only thing is you have to jump into it,

25:42.041 --> 25:45.125
just jump into it

25:46.542 --> 25:51.750
and know that you have become part and parcel of the reality.

25:54.875 --> 26:00.083
This if you have understood, I think, we have done a big job.

26:02.999 --> 26:05.875
Now we are in Germany,

26:06.041 --> 26:09.166
and you know in Germany

26:09.375 --> 26:12.625
there have been people who have

26:13.999 --> 26:17.999
tried to shatter the hopes of human beings.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.583
But

26:21.792 --> 26:25.542
even that happening that took place,

26:26.166 --> 26:30.208
all those horrible things happened, that so many people died,

26:30.417 --> 26:33.667
of course they are born again, no problem,

26:34.125 --> 26:37.166
and such problems came up

26:39.000 --> 26:42.083
that they were

26:43.542 --> 26:45.834
thinking that

26:46.333 --> 26:48.959
the whole world will be finished.

26:50.125 --> 26:52.166
They were so much worried,

26:52.375 --> 26:55.542
they thought that the whole world will be finished.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.959
But did not.

26:59.125 --> 27:03.333
But this war has taught us a lesson.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.333
It has made us more collective.

27:09.917 --> 27:12.959
It has made us understand each other.

27:13.917 --> 27:17.208
Otherwise, how do you come out of the ignorance

27:17.417 --> 27:20.750
that “we are this country”, “we are that country”,

27:21.125 --> 27:23.000
racialism,

27:23.208 --> 27:25.917
then this so-called nationalism,

27:26.083 --> 27:28.166
so-called patriotism -

27:28.375 --> 27:32.834
all these separating forces,

27:34.375 --> 27:36.709
divisive things.

27:37.625 --> 27:42.375
Saw clearly we are all human beings

27:43.875 --> 27:47.458
and we should be treated as human beings.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.834
If you see the history, after every war

27:52.000 --> 27:58.250
there has been a speedy movement towards knowledge,

27:58.583 --> 28:01.999
knowledge of oneness of the world.

28:03.166 --> 28:05.542
It is something

28:07.166 --> 28:10.959
like, you have in a spacecraft

28:11.125 --> 28:14.999
that a container is built in,

28:16.792 --> 28:20.166
one into another,

28:21.875 --> 28:25.750
and the whole thing

28:26.999 --> 28:32.291
comes into a speed, some velocity,

28:33.375 --> 28:37.417
and then the lower container bursts,

28:38.125 --> 28:40.417
or explodes.

28:40.625 --> 28:44.625
When it explodes, it gives a higher speed

28:45.500 --> 28:47.959
to the rest of it.

28:48.458 --> 28:53.500
And so the acceleration of the velocity takes place.

28:53.999 --> 28:57.999
And that’s how one can go into the space.

28:59.583 --> 29:02.417
In the same manner,

29:02.625 --> 29:06.125
all these horrible things that have happened

29:06.834 --> 29:09.750
are explosions

29:10.583 --> 29:13.583
which brings you

29:15.667 --> 29:18.583
towards knowledge

29:18.834 --> 29:20.792
that there’s something wrong with us,

29:20.999 --> 29:24.709
we are living with something unreal.

29:26.250 --> 29:31.041
Now the problems, today’s problems as they are,

29:37.166 --> 29:40.208
like ecology problem,

29:43.500 --> 29:44.999
AIDS,

29:46.083 --> 29:47.917
drugs,

29:49.625 --> 29:54.792
all these modern problems and poverty,

29:55.875 --> 29:59.166
if you see it like a witness, you will see

29:59.375 --> 30:02.083
these are quite shocking.

30:03.208 --> 30:05.625
These are very shocking things.

30:05.834 --> 30:10.333
And all these shocking things should really shock our mind,

30:11.000 --> 30:14.041
should really shock our mind.

30:14.792 --> 30:18.000
Why we have these problems?

30:20.500 --> 30:24.709
And these problems, some of the stupid leaders think

30:24.917 --> 30:28.458
that we can solve by making more money.

30:29.500 --> 30:33.750
We can protect ourselves from ecology if we have more money.

30:34.625 --> 30:38.792
And that we can pollute the atmosphere

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
because we will have more money.

30:41.208 --> 30:43.792
And then we can protect ourselves

30:43.999 --> 30:46.333
so that everybody will have to have a mask,

30:46.542 --> 30:49.083
moving about all over the place.

30:49.458 --> 30:53.875
But we should make more money to protect ourselves.

30:54.041 --> 30:57.875
Doesn’t matter if there is ecological problem, doesn’t matter.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.583
So you move about

31:00.792 --> 31:03.375
like a person who is entering

31:03.583 --> 31:07.542
into the area which is all full of fumes.

31:10.709 --> 31:13.583
All these stupid ideas come up because

31:13.792 --> 31:15.542
they do not see

31:15.750 --> 31:19.000
that, what is human dignity is,

31:20.125 --> 31:24.166
that human beings are above

31:24.375 --> 31:28.333
everything else - above machinery,

31:28.542 --> 31:32.500
above all material things of the world.

31:33.375 --> 31:37.375
They will not talk, that we'll balance the machinery. No.

31:38.208 --> 31:41.041
What they will talk, that we'll make a man

31:41.250 --> 31:43.917
a greater slave of the machinery

31:44.083 --> 31:45.999
because he must have money.

31:46.166 --> 31:49.834
He must have more money, and with this more money,

31:50.000 --> 31:54.125
we can protect ourselves against this ecological problem.

31:54.458 --> 31:56.917
It is absurd.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.959
But if you understand the human dignity,

32:02.291 --> 32:05.333
then you have to understand that

32:05.542 --> 32:08.542
as a human being,

32:11.250 --> 32:15.625
we have to take a very positive,

32:15.834 --> 32:20.250
wise step to stop all the nonsense we have been doing.

32:25.125 --> 32:27.500
Like, now most of the

32:28.709 --> 32:30.250
French

32:31.917 --> 32:33.250
shores,

32:33.999 --> 32:37.500
the beaches, are polluted.

32:37.999 --> 32:40.000
Naturally.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.166
Because they started a funny thing

32:42.375 --> 32:45.125
called “holiday making on the seashore.”

32:46.083 --> 32:47.875
So this is the result.

32:48.041 --> 32:49.999
Now, do what you please.

32:50.166 --> 32:53.458
You cannot do all that. It has stopped.

32:53.667 --> 32:55.999
So instead of - now human brain is such,

32:56.208 --> 32:59.542
instead of understanding that we have done something wrong,

32:59.750 --> 33:03.000
oh, they will say, “We will start some new method

33:03.208 --> 33:05.625
of cleansing this.”

33:05.834 --> 33:08.375
They will never condemn

33:08.583 --> 33:10.542
what has gone wrong with them

33:10.750 --> 33:14.041
that they have become so addicted to this kind of a

33:14.250 --> 33:17.834
funny life that they have on the seashores.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.250
Now, AIDS.

33:20.458 --> 33:23.500
You’ll be amazed that in America

33:24.041 --> 33:27.250
why, even they said that

33:27.542 --> 33:31.083
there were in Los Angeles, itself,

33:31.417 --> 33:34.709
seven hundred thousand people

33:35.250 --> 33:38.792
who glorified themselves as martyrs of AIDS

33:38.999 --> 33:42.834
because they are achieving such a great goal

33:44.500 --> 33:48.208
of leading a life which is nonsensical,

33:48.542 --> 33:51.709
as if like a big revolution.

33:52.792 --> 33:56.583
And thinking that they are very, very

33:56.792 --> 34:00.166
great revolutionaries, great people,

34:00.458 --> 34:03.875
that they are supporting this AIDS

34:06.834 --> 34:11.208
disease and glorifying it.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.875
Can you believe

34:15.166 --> 34:19.375
that this kind of

34:19.583 --> 34:23.500
assertion will be accepted?

34:24.917 --> 34:27.750
People will laugh at you.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.625
But everything is so money-oriented.

34:31.834 --> 34:33.667
They like to advertise it.

34:33.875 --> 34:36.208
They want to talk about money help.

34:36.417 --> 34:39.458
They want to say that this is happening because

34:41.291 --> 34:43.000
if they had more money,

34:43.208 --> 34:46.583
they would have taken more drugs.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.999
Because they have no money, that’s why they are thieving.

34:50.166 --> 34:53.667
So we must give them money so that they can take drugs,

34:55.083 --> 34:57.792
or they can take to this kind of life.

34:57.999 --> 35:00.542
On the whole, if you see,

35:00.750 --> 35:02.792
people have lived

35:02.999 --> 35:05.750
with something which is so unreal

35:05.959 --> 35:08.959
all their lives, absolutely unreal.

35:09.125 --> 35:12.750
And when it comes to facing it,

35:12.959 --> 35:15.333
that we’ve done a mistake,

35:15.542 --> 35:18.500
we should not have done this mistake;

35:19.375 --> 35:21.417
then they retreat

35:21.625 --> 35:24.709
and take another glorious

35:24.917 --> 35:28.083
image, artificial and unreal,

35:28.291 --> 35:31.750
saying  “Oh, we are great, we are martyrs.”

35:36.792 --> 35:41.583
And this is what is, what we call is Kali Yuga

35:41.792 --> 35:46.667
where everything that is ignoble, everything that is to be detested,

35:46.875 --> 35:51.041
everything from which we should have protection will become

35:51.250 --> 35:55.792
the goal of people to achieve.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.375
I hope you have understood

35:59.583 --> 36:03.959
that the All-Pervading Power around us

36:04.125 --> 36:06.834
is the one that is doing Sahaja Yoga,

36:07.000 --> 36:09.375
is the one that has brought you to Sahaja Yoga,

36:09.583 --> 36:12.999
and is the one who has given you blessings,

36:13.166 --> 36:14.458
is Paramachaitanya.

36:16.625 --> 36:19.375
Through which it has worked out.

36:19.583 --> 36:24.125
So today’s prayer should be that we be more and more aware

36:24.333 --> 36:28.375
that we are part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya

36:28.583 --> 36:31.041
and that we can feel that,

36:31.250 --> 36:35.333
we can use that power, we can work it out.

36:35.542 --> 36:38.291
If it is felt today that way,

36:38.500 --> 36:41.917
I think lot of work has been done already

36:42.083 --> 36:43.917
and may God bless you for that.

37:58.250 --> 37:59.583
Now.

38:02.208 --> 38:05.959
So when you are doing this Puja, please remember

38:06.125 --> 38:09.458
that you are worshipping Me as Paramachaitanya

38:09.667 --> 38:13.834
and so you have to just think

38:14.000 --> 38:17.792
that you’re dealing with reality itself.

38:22.166 --> 38:25.583
With that understanding, you have to do this Puja.

38:32.792 --> 38:35.083
May God bless you.
