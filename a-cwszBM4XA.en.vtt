00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.890
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.010
Definitely it is evident today

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.929
that you have come here all the way in the rain

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.970
to seek the truth, that you are real seekers.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.529
And the real seekers

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.930
will find the real way.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.828
Whatever they may do, whatever wrong path they may take,

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:42.014
they may identify themselves with wrong things also,

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:44.942
and may oppose in the beginning the truth,

00:00:45.143 --> 00:00:50.530
but ultimately they will all find the real path,

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.865
as long as they do not try to deceive themselves.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.288
The awakening of the Kundalini

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.969
is not a new thing as you people may be thinking.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.569
It has been done since

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.481
sixteenth century back,

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:24.219
when it is said Indra, the God King,

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.849
was given Realization.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.824
So you can imagine,

00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:32.243
that is called as Siddhendra,

00:01:32.445 --> 00:01:37.970
means the Indra first made a hole here.

00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:42.529
And there’s a place where it was done in India.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.376
It’s a very ancient thing,

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:46.849
and at the time of Rama also,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.126
there was a fellow called Nachiketa

00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:53.878
who came to Rama’s father-in-law, Janaka,

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.720
and asked Him if he could get his Self Realization.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.049
And the father-in-law said that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.649
“You can ask anything but not for your Realization.”

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.119
He said, “No, I don’t want anything else but Realization”.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.626
And they say that He put him to test, many a times, for years,

00:02:14.827 --> 00:02:17.929
and then he was the first who got Realization,

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.905
at the time of Shri Rama.

00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:27.744
It is very interesting that how this system of Self Realization,

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:32.058
was kept more or less exclusive, and rather secretive,

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.140
because the people would like always

00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:40.440
to use this method to make some money out of it;

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:44.211
that they would not respect the reality,

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:49.429
and would learn, say about your chakras, Kundalini,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.050
this, that, few words and start selling books

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.450
or posing that they are born again,

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:58.768
and impressing others with it,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.928
and try to make some cults or some sort of groups,

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.489
just forming into some falsehood.

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:11.329
And that is the reason this was kept quite a secret.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.929
But on the right hand side of the seeking,

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.929
they tried to find out the ways and methods

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.689
how to initiate the elements within us, the casual of elements,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.649
first to initiate the causal of the elements,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.089
by which we could control the elements for our own purpose.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.449
This was one way where they called it as the Yagnya and all that.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.666
And that’s how the Vedas were written.

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:42.129
Veda means vida, means to know.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.783
These were written to say that you have to know.

00:03:45.984 --> 00:03:49.010
And at the very beginning of the Vedas, it is written

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.152
that after reading this book, throughout,

00:03:52.353 --> 00:03:55.784
if you have not known the truth,

00:03:55.927 --> 00:03:58.809
it is of no use to you.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.569
The very first stanza says so.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.440
So the whole thing was done with that idea,

00:04:05.642 --> 00:04:08.757
and in the ancient country of India,

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.093
they started working on the right side

00:04:11.294 --> 00:04:14.818
to know this subtle body

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:18.314
or the subtle Deities of all the elements

00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:21.890
so that they could master the elements; this was first idea.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.843
On the left hand side, they started another kind of a search,

00:04:27.044 --> 00:04:29.930
in believing that there is God,

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.570
and we have to ask the help of God.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.903
And they started praying,

00:04:36.102 --> 00:04:38.169
first to Primordial Mother,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.529
because in every religion there is a place for the Mother.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.649
There’s no religion which does not believe in the Primordial Mother.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.570
You can say that at the time of Mohammed Sahib,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.289
He didn’t talk much about it, because the time was such.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.359
But His own daughter

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.597
was an incarnation of the Primordial Mother,

00:04:59.788 --> 00:05:01.569
whose name was Fatima Bi.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.061
And the two sons that were born to Her, are the sons

00:05:06.263 --> 00:05:12.296
who came on this earth also as Mahavira and Buddha.

00:05:12.497 --> 00:05:14.523
And they were born even earlier.

00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:17.175
Like that, they were born again and again,

00:05:17.376 --> 00:05:21.530
as these two elements, as the disciples, as two disciples.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.191
And you can see if you read their life,

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:28.689
their character, their behavior, you’ll be surprised,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.329
how these two characters have been born again and again,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.770
in different times, to suggest two personalities

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.049
of two types, who have been seeking God,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.692
and who have been trying to understand God

00:05:43.893 --> 00:05:46.251
through their personality as disciples;

00:05:46.453 --> 00:05:49.729
and how they reached a conclusion

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.690
after taking a kind of a position in life.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.490
Now for example Buddha preached that

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.289
there should be complete non-violence,

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.756
and also Mahavira said so, there should be non-violence.

00:06:04.957 --> 00:06:07.290
But they carried it to such an extent.

00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:11.061
that Mahavira’s disciples started saving the bugs.

00:06:11.262 --> 00:06:14.373
They would get some bugs from the village,

00:06:14.628 --> 00:06:16.397
put them in a hut

00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:20.609
and put a Brahmin inside that – fanaticism at that stage -

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.710
and the bugs would eat,

00:06:22.901 --> 00:06:29.129
or take, take out the blood of that poor brahmin,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.449
and when they would be all filled with blood,

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.489
then they would give money to this brahmin.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.209
Such extreme vegetarianism or extreme type of ahinsa!

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.128
Or another type of Buddha’s ahinsa that started

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.929
that Buddha was not the one who was a vegetarian,

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.650
because He died, at the end you know that,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.849
He ate the meat of a boar which was not properly cooked.

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.072
So this kind of extreme type of

00:06:58.273 --> 00:07:02.128
food-oriented religion started out of them,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.748
so they got themselves born again,

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:08.362
as Hassan and Hussein and [unclear]

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.192
[missing a part] a person who is a religious person.

00:07:11.341 --> 00:07:18.008
So the idea of all these people was in such a way

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:23.158
that the time at that period was such and such,

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:27.460
and at that period this was the proper thing to be done.

00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:30.541
Now we can see the example of Christ is.

00:07:30.781 --> 00:07:32.413
Christ came at a time

00:07:32.614 --> 00:07:36.260
where the Son of God had to manifest.

00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:40.941
And He came at a time where He had to forgive,

00:07:41.141 --> 00:07:47.061
and He had to show to people how stupid they were, to crucify Him,

00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:52.061
so that they could repent for what stupidity they have done.

00:07:52.262 --> 00:07:54.421
And that’s how He came on this earth.

00:07:54.668 --> 00:07:57.271
But when He will come again,

00:07:57.528 --> 00:08:00.300
He’s not going to come in that way.

00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.075
The Second Advent of Christ,

00:08:03.204 --> 00:08:06.460
is going to be a very serious one.

00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:10.741
When He will come, He will have eleven destroying powers.

00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:14.100
With that He will destroy all that is useless,

00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:17.661
all that has gone wasted, all those fanatics

00:08:17.861 --> 00:08:20.357
or "Whom they'll call Christ, Christ, I won’t know”,

00:08:20.558 --> 00:08:22.021
He’s told that, very well.

00:08:22.222 --> 00:08:25.461
All these things He’s going to absolutely finish off.

00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:29.381
And those who are realized souls,

00:08:29.582 --> 00:08:32.900
who have entered into the Kingdom of God, will be only saved.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.661
And this is what is described in all the Scriptures.

00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:41.048
Of course somebody calls them, say Islam calls it “Mahdi”

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:43.741
in India He is called as “Kalki”,

00:08:43.942 --> 00:08:47.421
in the Bible He is called as “the Christ on the white horse”.

00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:49.221
He is called by various names,

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:51.941
but it is definite that He is going to come,

00:08:52.141 --> 00:08:53.586
and when He comes,

00:08:53.787 --> 00:08:58.515
then He is not going to bother as to tell you, and convince you,

00:08:58.716 --> 00:09:03.735
and to counsel you or to redeem you and give you Realization.

00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:07.100
That time, He is not going to bother about it.

00:09:07.341 --> 00:09:10.061
He is going to come in pure destructive form,

00:09:10.301 --> 00:09:12.872
where He will destroy all that is useless.

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:17.584
And to understand this, if you see
the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo,

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:20.741
you can see Him clearly standing, at the Agnya chakra,

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:23.700
with a robust body, throwing people up and down.

00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:26.421
Those who call, “Christ, Christ”, He throws them down,

00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:31.388
because they did not do anything what Christ has asked for.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.999
Now the people should know

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.261
what we have got out of anything whatsoever.

00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.981
You may be identified with any cult, with any idea,

00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.941
with any group, or anything,

00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:46.459
but always must know what you have you got out of it.

00:09:46.661 --> 00:09:50.820
For example, I would say for Christians it is necessary to know

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.821
that Christ has said a very strong thing,

00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:57.581
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:01.421
Let us find out, do we have innocent eyes?

00:10:01.661 --> 00:10:04.739
If we don’t, we are not Christians.

00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:06.941
How do we have innocent eyes?

00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:10.099
How do we develop our innocence, is the problem.

00:10:10.301 --> 00:10:14.380
And to develop our innocence we have to awaken the Kundalini.

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:16.566
When the Kundalini is awakened, the first center

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:19.900
of innocence is awakened.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.420
At that time all the excretion work of the body just stops,

00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:32.115
and this center of Mooladhara, informs the Kundalini,

00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:36.381
that “There is somebody who knows the job and You can rise.”

00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:38.661
Then only the Kundalini rises.

00:10:38.901 --> 00:10:42.882
This center of innocence is first awakened within us.

00:10:43.084 --> 00:10:48.420
If this center finds that the person is anti-God,

00:10:48.622 --> 00:10:50.741
he is anti-Christ,

00:10:51.341 --> 00:10:55.221
he is a man who is a devil, or any sort of a thing,

00:10:55.461 --> 00:10:57.981
it just does not allow the Kundalini to rise.

00:10:58.181 --> 00:11:01.221
I have seen people with absolute frozen Kundalini;

00:11:01.422 --> 00:11:04.861
I have seen people who have nothing to do with Kundalini,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.026
we can say they are just like devils

00:11:07.227 --> 00:11:11.060
and they have no way that they can be realized.

00:11:11.261 --> 00:11:14.646
But ninety-nine percent people in this world

00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:18.301
are excellent people, good people,

00:11:18.503 --> 00:11:20.781
and out of them I think at least

00:11:21.021 --> 00:11:23.820
thirty to forty percent people are seeking God.

00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:28.421
Not all; some are seeking money, some are seeking power

00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:31.781
and some are seeking some personal indulgences.

00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:35.701
But there are definitely true seekers on this earth,

00:11:35.902 --> 00:11:39.828
and this thirty percent people are, or forty percent people,

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:43.420
are the most important people from the God’s point of view.

00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:47.221
You might be anything. You might be having any organization,

00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:49.900
you might be having any position in life,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.661
you might be any great personality, makes no difference to God.

00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:57.100
What is important is that are you seeking?

00:11:57.621 --> 00:12:00.981
If you’re not, the door will be opened has been promised.

00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:03.501
But if you think you have already achieved it

00:12:03.741 --> 00:12:06.540
and that you are there, how can it be worked out?

00:12:06.741 --> 00:12:11.061
So one has to be humble about it, and allow the Kundalini to rise

00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:14.949
in Its own glory, giving you your real beauty.

00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:19.820
Now the thing we have to know that

00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:25.100
as the Kundalini ascends, we also start getting powers.

00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:28.900
The first power is that of innocence.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.208
Innocence has a power above all other powers.

00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:36.420
It’s the most powerful thing,

00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:39.203
but in the human beings it takes time

00:12:39.404 --> 00:12:42.656
for innocence to be awakened in the full way.

00:12:42.857 --> 00:12:46.180
It takes time. As a child they have the innocence;

00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:49.341
and in childhood, if they get their awakening

00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:51.900
that’s the best thing that can happen to human beings

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.421
that in the childhood only they become, get their Realization.

00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:57.540
But as soon as you start growing

00:12:57.781 --> 00:13:01.660
your attention starts going either to the left or to the right.

00:13:01.861 --> 00:13:04.621
You start indulging into all kinds of things

00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:06.701
as far as your sex is concerned,

00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:09.509
as far as your seeking is concerned,

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.560
and you then jump on to some sort of a wrong thing

00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:15.423
which you should not have done.

00:13:15.624 --> 00:13:18.273
And that’s how the first center gets lost.

00:13:18.474 --> 00:13:22.541
An innocent person is looked after by angels.

00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:25.723
Such a person has no fear of anything.

00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:30.031
He’s not bothered, he’s never violent, he’s never hasty,

00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:33.180
he’s never in a temper, he’s so peaceful,

00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:37.621
and he knows that what he is doing is the right thing.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:41.099
Such a person stands by righteousness.

00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:45.420
Like you can see in the life of Christ is a very good example

00:13:45.661 --> 00:13:50.026
that when Mary Magdalene was stoned by people, He stood up,

00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:53.260
and He said, “Among you who has done no sin

00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:55.100
can throw the stone at her.”

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:58.261
Actually Christ had nothing to do with a prostitute.

00:13:58.501 --> 00:14:02.021
He had no relationship of any kind with her.

00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:06.100
She is a prostitute and He is the Son of God.

00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:10.100
But at that time He did feel that she has a right to exist,

00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:13.181
because those who are stoning her

00:14:13.382 --> 00:14:15.861
are the people who have committed also sins.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.900
Only she is a person who’s exposed, and He stood by her.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.673
And that is what happens to a person who is innocent

00:14:22.874 --> 00:14:24.059
he is fearless.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.981
He has no fear of anything,

00:14:26.181 --> 00:14:30.501
because he knows that he stands on truth and on innocence.

00:14:30.861 --> 00:14:36.701
Such a person also has a capacity to bear up lots of nonsense,

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:41.621
to laugh at lots of tortures and troubles people bestow upon him.

00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:44.274
And the greatest thing of innocence is,

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.380
that it gives you discretion.

00:14:46.581 --> 00:14:50.075
Such a person is immensely discreet. He’s so wise.

00:14:50.276 --> 00:14:53.460
He may be a little child, he may be a grown-up person,

00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:56.580
he may be a villager, he might be educated,

00:14:56.782 --> 00:14:59.860
he might be uneducated, but he’s so wise

00:15:00.061 --> 00:15:04.107
that he sees what is right and what is righteous.

00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:07.900
And this is the greatest quality of an innocent person,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.781
that he’s very discreet about everything.

00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:15.341
His discretion is just like a straight forward hit.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.620
He doesn’t have to think, he doesn’t have to bother.

00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:22.100
Whatever he decides is absolute discreet,

00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:24.180
and he doesn’t have to have choices.

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:27.611
He doesn’t go on choosing people, he doesn’t go on choosing things.

00:15:27.812 --> 00:15:29.740
He said, “This is the thing” – finished.

00:15:29.941 --> 00:15:32.900
So, such a person becomes absolutely dynamic

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.900
because he doesn’t waste any energy, he doesn’t waste his brains,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.981
he doesn’t waste his arguments with anyone.

00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:42.741
If he thinks a person is worth arguing, he’ll argue,

00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:46.500
otherwise he’ll say, “All right, you are clever. Go ahead.”

00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:51.010
This is the understanding of a person,

00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:52.981
who is completely discreet.

00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.701
Like there was a very big joke about it, that

00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:01.261
there was a man who was going up the road,

00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:06.260
up the stairs, and another one was coming downstairs.

00:16:06.461 --> 00:16:10.501
The one who was going up the road was a wise man

00:16:10.741 --> 00:16:13.300
and the one who was coming down was not a wise man.

00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:16.620
So he tried to be aggressive, so, and he told him

00:16:16.821 --> 00:16:21.380
that “I will not move for you, because I don’t move for fools.”

00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:26.041
So the other one moved on one side and he said, “I do.”

00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:29.581
Meaning, “I move out for fools,”

00:16:29.821 --> 00:16:31.899
you see, but he said, “I do.” And he moved out.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.220
So he has such a discretion – how far to go and how far not to go.

00:16:36.421 --> 00:16:38.461
Now, I will give you an example how

00:16:38.701 --> 00:16:41.221
in nature you can find this very easily.

00:16:41.461 --> 00:16:44.580
See, the root has a little root cap.

00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:46.741
It’s a very, very small minute thing,

00:16:46.981 --> 00:16:48.900
you have to see through the microscope.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.826
Now this root cap is a wise thing.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.430
It goes in the soil, it sees there are some stones,

00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:57.219
so it goes around the stones.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.499
Then it finds there are boulders. It goes around the boulders.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.036
It has to find its way, so it's not bothered.

00:17:03.238 --> 00:17:04.940
“You are a boulder? All right, doesn’t matter,

00:17:05.148 --> 00:17:06.574
I am not going to fight with you.”

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:10.170
It passes through that, it goes directly

00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:13.181
to that place where it has to arrive,

00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:16.711
and when it reaches that place, when he arrives that place,

00:17:16.913 --> 00:17:20.433
what happens, he finds that he has tied up these boulders

00:17:20.635 --> 00:17:24.141
around himself to support the whole tree.

00:17:24.937 --> 00:17:29.821
This is the wisdom of a little bit, small little cell

00:17:30.061 --> 00:17:32.941
which is the root-end.

00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:37.061
So you can imagine how much there is wisdom

00:17:37.261 --> 00:17:40.900
in a little cell like that.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.061
And God has given us such a good brain

00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:46.501
and if we do not have discretion

00:17:46.741 --> 00:17:48.900
we are like people who are blind,

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.540
who walk without knowing where they have to go.

00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:58.821
So the first power of your innocence is awakened.

00:17:59.301 --> 00:18:01.661
Innocent men cannot be harmed.

00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:05.899
Those who try to harm the innocent men are harmed ultimately.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.701
They are very severely harmed, and it is amazing sometimes

00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:14.341
that the harm can be too much, too severe

00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:17.461
and that’s why the compassion of Christ thought of it,

00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:20.221
and He said, “Oh God, please forgive them,

00:18:20.422 --> 00:18:22.861
for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.100
Because it could have been that

00:18:25.341 --> 00:18:27.061
with the Father who is so wrathful,

00:18:27.261 --> 00:18:29.900
they would have been all destroyed completely.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.899
So the way He said, “Forgive them,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.461
because I do not want

00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:37.901
that these people, who are ignorant people,

00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:41.541
who have tortured Me like this, should be destroyed.”

00:18:41.901 --> 00:18:45.551
This is the sign of innocence.

00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:51.140
Then the second chakra, when it is awaken within you,

00:18:51.341 --> 00:18:56.812
you have a special quality of creativity.

00:18:57.381 --> 00:18:59.900
Because when the second chakra is awaken,

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.989
you are actually thoughtless, there’s no thought in your mind.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:08.680
So you start looking at anything, without thinking.

00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:13.861
You start looking at anything that is created

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.380
without any ripple of thought in your mind.

00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:21.660
Like all that is created round the lake of your mind

00:19:21.861 --> 00:19:28.029
is completely reflected in that ripple-less lake,

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:33.900
and you see the complete reflection of that creation,

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.900
as well as the joy that is bubbling in that creation.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.900
So your creativity becomes tremendous.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.483
You start seeing things, but not thinking about it.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.900
Now, see if you come to this hall,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.500
and you start seeing something, you like it,

00:19:51.701 --> 00:19:54.421
then you start thinking, “Oh God, this is a beautiful thing,

00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:57.900
but how much it must have cost? And now how old it is?

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.100
Is it going to last or not? Is it insured or not?”

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:03.181
All sorts of funny ideas will come to you,

00:20:03.421 --> 00:20:05.365
and you’ll never enjoy what it is.

00:20:05.566 --> 00:20:07.980
But supposing you have no thought about it,

00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:09.900
you just watch it, you just see it.

00:20:10.101 --> 00:20:13.981
What happens? The creation that of the artist

00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:16.020
who has created this beautiful thing,

00:20:16.221 --> 00:20:18.740
the joy of that creation that the artist had -

00:20:18.981 --> 00:20:22.198
who might be dead now - you start enjoying that joy.

00:20:22.399 --> 00:20:27.198
The whole thing can be filled in you with that bubbling joy

00:20:27.399 --> 00:20:31.032
that he wanted to put there with his own heart.

00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:34.141
And that’s what happens because there is no thought.

00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:36.900
So the creativity becomes tremendous.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.341
But it’s not only that the creativity is tremendous,

00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:42.100
but your techniques even.

00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:45.541
For example, a musician can become a tremendous musician.

00:20:45.781 --> 00:20:50.421
People who have never done any work, can become extremely powerful.

00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:53.500
We have somebody here from India.

00:20:53.701 --> 00:20:55.299
The other day he was telling people,

00:20:55.501 --> 00:20:57.678
because he gave one of the lectures,

00:20:57.879 --> 00:21:00.327
that “I had never seen what is wood is.

00:21:00.528 --> 00:21:03.900
I did not know what was teak, what was other wood and all that.”

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.900
And he had no job when he came to Me.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.591
And he said, “Now, after Realization what job should I take?”

00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:11.303
I said, “You take to interior decoration”, and he got a shock.

00:21:11.504 --> 00:21:13.100
He said, “I don’t know what [to do].

00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:14.968
How am I to take interior decoration?”

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:17.381
I said, “You can start feeling the vibrations.

00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:20.261
You just do it on the basis on vibrations.”

00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:23.100
And he did it, and he made a big money out of it,

00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:25.221
because as I told you the other day,

00:21:25.461 --> 00:21:28.341
whatever is absolutely beautiful you think,

00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:31.181
has nothing in it but has vibrations.

00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:34.500
It has a coefficient which gives you vibrations.

00:21:34.701 --> 00:21:37.141
Like Mona Lisa now. We like her, Mona Lisa.

00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:39.740
According to modern standards she cannot be a beauty

00:21:39.981 --> 00:21:42.961
because she was a very plump lady, an elderly lady.

00:21:43.162 --> 00:21:46.661
But today also, if you go there, you cannot see her painting,

00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:49.821
it’s so crowded, everybody’s anxious to see Mona Lisa.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.900
And if you go and feel the vibrations,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.900
from distance you’ll get vibrations,

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.901
because the coefficients of her body, face and everything

00:21:58.101 --> 00:22:01.100
is made so well, that you get the vibrations.

00:22:01.461 --> 00:22:05.099
Now people are very anxious to create new ideas,

00:22:05.301 --> 00:22:07.388
new type of things, and these,

00:22:07.589 --> 00:22:09.815
but these things do not sell

00:22:10.016 --> 00:22:13.541
and even if they sell temporarily, they have no eternal values.

00:22:13.821 --> 00:22:17.421
So the people with this chakra enlightened,

00:22:17.661 --> 00:22:23.036
start creating things of very eternal values,

00:22:23.821 --> 00:22:25.349
of universal values.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.564
Anywhere you take such a thing, you will take it to India,

00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:32.141
you take it to China, you take it to Japan or you take it to America

00:22:32.381 --> 00:22:36.100
anywhere, any human being who sees that,

00:22:36.301 --> 00:22:39.900
sees the beauty of the Spirit,

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.861
because it gives you joy in your Spirit.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.900
So the pure art is produced [through you].

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.321
That’s the purity,

00:22:48.522 --> 00:22:51.381
or I would say the holy art is produced through you.

00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:55.335
When you start producing that holy art, then you should believe

00:22:55.536 --> 00:22:59.900
that you have got an enlightenment on that chakra.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.112
This chakra has another capacity,

00:23:02.313 --> 00:23:05.993
to transform your fat, for the use of your brain.

00:23:06.194 --> 00:23:09.981
And it works very hard for that, when you start thinking too much.

00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.023
And by that over thinking,

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.667
what happens, that you develop all the diseases

00:23:14.868 --> 00:23:17.621
of the organs which it has to look after.

00:23:17.861 --> 00:23:19.861
Like, it has to look after the liver,

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.900
it has to look after the pancreas, it has to look after the spleen,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.101
it has to look after the parts of the intestine and the uterus.

00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:31.068
So what happens that when you use this chakra

00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:34.980
only for the use of thinking and thinking and thinking,

00:23:35.181 --> 00:23:37.461
all these things go out of order.

00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:41.716
And one by one you start developing diseases like diabetes,

00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:46.535
and then you start developing diseases of the stomach,

00:23:46.736 --> 00:23:50.172
and sometimes the spleen, and all other diseases

00:23:50.373 --> 00:23:52.400
which are very dangerous, that the,

00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:55.297
as you can call the blood cancer and all those things,

00:23:55.498 --> 00:23:57.860
out of this kind of mad thinking.

00:23:58.061 --> 00:24:01.141
Now to tell you that you shouldn’t think too much,

00:24:01.381 --> 00:24:04.533
you shouldn’t bother too much, you should not be wobbly,

00:24:04.734 --> 00:24:07.327
you should take things easy, be light-hearted,

00:24:07.528 --> 00:24:09.375
is not possible in the modern times

00:24:09.527 --> 00:24:11.420
because we are slaves of the watch.

00:24:11.621 --> 00:24:15.780
But what happens, that when you get Realization,

00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:18.301
your thinking process becomes regulated.

00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:20.221
You only think when you have to think.

00:24:20.422 --> 00:24:22.900
You just go on thinking, thinking, like horns coming out.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.220
You don’t think like that. You only think when you have to think.

00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:30.259
And whatever you think comes from you inspiration as such.

00:24:30.461 --> 00:24:34.221
Now for time, you see, My watch is always out of order.

00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:39.099
I deliberately keep it out of order, because the time is

00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:43.141
in your hands.

00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:45.941
Supposing these people will hurry Me up too much,

00:24:46.141 --> 00:24:49.243
“Mother we have go now, we’ll miss
the plane, this thing, that thing.”

00:24:49.444 --> 00:24:51.232
I said, “All right, if you say I’ll go.”

00:24:51.433 --> 00:24:53.129
I go to the airport

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.540
and there they find the plane is three hours late.

00:24:55.741 --> 00:24:57.900
Then they said, “Mother, why didn’t you tell us?”

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.221
I said, “I was telling you, no need to hurry up.

00:25:00.461 --> 00:25:01.980
Why didn’t you telephone and find out?

00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:05.341
If you had telephoned, we would not have been there earlier.”

00:25:05.581 --> 00:25:08.357
So you see, you start seeing

00:25:08.558 --> 00:25:13.030
that this time is best for this, this time is best for that.

00:25:13.231 --> 00:25:15.512
You don’t have to become a slave of the watch.

00:25:15.713 --> 00:25:18.048
Like this, people become such slaves

00:25:18.249 --> 00:25:23.100
that they arrive at a point where there can be

00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:25.341
some sort of a wrong thing happening

00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:29.100
or maybe that you reach the place
and you have to wait for four hours,

00:25:29.341 --> 00:25:33.127
you have to do all kinds of arrangements

00:25:33.328 --> 00:25:35.039
to make yourself comfortable.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.181
Or sometimes it so happens that you quarrel with your wife,

00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:40.572
quarrel with your husband, quarrel with your children,

00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:42.514
“Oh, we are getting late, we are getting late

00:25:42.715 --> 00:25:43.831
we have to be on the time.”

00:25:44.032 --> 00:25:45.899
All this madness comes to people

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.501
because they have not got their Realization.

00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:51.421
Once you get Realization, you station down.

00:25:51.661 --> 00:25:54.461
You are very much at ease with yourself.

00:25:54.701 --> 00:25:57.820
You don’t hurry others and you don’t trouble others.

00:25:58.061 --> 00:26:01.340
Like small, small things, how much we trouble by our worries.

00:26:01.541 --> 00:26:05.101
You see, human beings will go on saying, “I’m worried.”

00:26:05.341 --> 00:26:08.021
But what’s the use of worrying? Now if I tell you, “Don’t worry”

00:26:08.221 --> 00:26:09.405
you cannot stop it.

00:26:09.607 --> 00:26:11.621
But once the hole is made here,

00:26:11.861 --> 00:26:13.821
which we call the Brahmarandhra is opened,

00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:16.381
then there’s a hole out of which the worry comes out,

00:26:16.621 --> 00:26:18.621
and then you just cannot worry.

00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:20.861
Even if you want to worry, you won’t worry;

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.901
because somehow or other you go beyond that nonsense of worrying.

00:26:26.621 --> 00:26:30.541
In any way, mentally I cannot convince you that you don’t worry.

00:26:30.781 --> 00:26:33.021
But once you get Realization, you’ll be amazed,

00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:35.221
you’ll be just enjoying yourself.

00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:37.941
Even if you are late, you are not going to bother about

00:26:38.141 --> 00:26:40.141
or trouble others and you will find

00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:42.301
that you’ll be are always in time for things,

00:26:42.541 --> 00:26:44.261
because there is a force,

00:26:44.501 --> 00:26:47.781
this All Pervading Power of God looks after you.

00:26:48.021 --> 00:26:50.381
You start believing in it, how it works out.

00:26:50.621 --> 00:26:53.221
You won’t believe how much it helps,

00:26:53.461 --> 00:26:57.701
how much it works out, how it can operate

00:26:57.941 --> 00:27:00.100
just beyond description.

00:27:00.301 --> 00:27:02.747
I mean, I’ll tell you a story which you won’t believe.

00:27:02.955 --> 00:27:05.736
Did I tell them yesterday about the boy who fainted?

00:27:05.911 --> 00:27:07.660
SY: I don't think so, Mother.
SM: No.

00:27:07.861 --> 00:27:09.900
SM: A story about Myself,

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.900
and then a story about Warren I can tell you.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.821
It’s in the newspaper, so you can believe it.

00:27:16.061 --> 00:27:18.301
I was giving a lecture in Bedford

00:27:18.541 --> 00:27:21.581
and that was from seven to ten

00:27:21.821 --> 00:27:24.341
and about eight o’clock a boy fell down somewhere,

00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:27.900
about I don’t know ten-fifteen miles from a bridge.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.381
Very deep down he fell down from his motorbike.

00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:33.751
And they sent for an ambulance.

00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:36.271
They got frightened; they thought this boy must be dead,

00:27:36.472 --> 00:27:38.500
to fall down to this extent.

00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:41.901
So the ambulance came in and when the ambulance came in,

00:27:42.101 --> 00:27:44.261
this boy just walked up, and he came up

00:27:44.501 --> 00:27:46.021
and he sat in the ambulance.

00:27:46.221 --> 00:27:47.900
So they said, “How are you?”

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.900
He said “I’m all right, nothing wrong with me.”

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.702
So they said, “But nothing happened to you.”

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:53.581
He said, “No, I broke lots of things

00:27:53.821 --> 00:27:56.187
but a Lady came in a white clothes,

00:27:56.388 --> 00:27:58.753
in a white Mercedes (that’s My car),

00:27:58.954 --> 00:28:02.100
and She walked down up to me and She cured me.

00:28:02.301 --> 00:28:07.141
And only She left the lower portion of my bone,

00:28:07.381 --> 00:28:09.581
and She said that, You come for this to Me,

00:28:09.782 --> 00:28:11.781
and the rest is I’m perfectly all right, see."

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.821
They couldn’t believe it, you see.

00:28:14.061 --> 00:28:16.421
And the police was there, and everybody was there.

00:28:16.661 --> 00:28:20.548
And the next day he saw My photograph in the newspaper,

00:28:20.749 --> 00:28:22.621
and he informed them, he informed the police,

00:28:22.822 --> 00:28:24.545
“This is the Lady Who came and cured me.”

00:28:24.746 --> 00:28:26.621
So they telephoned our people, and ask them,

00:28:26.861 --> 00:28:27.941
“Did She pass this way that day?”

00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:30.341
They said, “That time She was just giving lecture

00:28:30.581 --> 00:28:32.740
before six hundred people. She was not there.”

00:28:32.941 --> 00:28:35.900
So they were quite amazed, how it has happened. But it can happen.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.341
It’s nothing new. I mean it has happened many a times.

00:28:38.661 --> 00:28:41.301
But one of these that has appeared in the newspaper is like that.

00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:43.100
Now, how does this happen?

00:28:43.301 --> 00:28:46.741
God has got wonderful television also, perfect,

00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:49.181
it’s so systematic, it’s so scientific.

00:28:49.421 --> 00:28:54.020
How it works, that for that you have to just see and wonder.

00:28:54.221 --> 00:28:57.820
He has got telecommunication, He has got computers,

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.221
He has got everything that you have created,

00:29:00.461 --> 00:29:04.094
but extremely efficient and methodical.

00:29:04.295 --> 00:29:06.980
You don’t have to worry, it just works out.

00:29:07.181 --> 00:29:09.540
There are so many things that have happened,

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:12.821
like you have heard that Christ gave bread,

00:29:13.061 --> 00:29:15.900
five bread and fish to so many people.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.341
It’s nothing new to now Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:18.581 --> 00:29:20.100
They have seen this many a times happening,

00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:21.941
in our groups and in our camps.

00:29:22.141 --> 00:29:24.980
But another thing which is not believable

00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:27.221
but it has happened to one Mr. Warren,

00:29:27.461 --> 00:29:29.099
Dr. Warren, who is here from Australia.

00:29:29.341 --> 00:29:32.900
When he came to India and he got his Realization,

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.367
and when he went back he said,

00:29:34.526 --> 00:29:37.476
“I must now start talking about Sahaja Yoga

00:29:37.677 --> 00:29:39.261
and giving Realization to people.”

00:29:39.501 --> 00:29:44.461
And when he went back to Australia there was a petrol crisis.

00:29:44.701 --> 00:29:47.540
And there was no petrol in his car, about to finish,

00:29:47.781 --> 00:29:49.434
so they thought, “Now, what to do?

00:29:49.635 --> 00:29:52.181
We’ll not have any petrol. How to do Mother’s work?”

00:29:52.421 --> 00:29:53.750
So they said, “Lets try.

00:29:53.952 --> 00:29:57.621
We’ll just go wherever we want, we’ll not look at the petrol.”

00:29:57.861 --> 00:30:01.581
And they did this for twenty-one days, continuously,

00:30:01.821 --> 00:30:04.723
and when they went to the petrol pump after twenty-one days,

00:30:04.924 --> 00:30:07.740
because the petrol pumps had opened out,

00:30:07.941 --> 00:30:09.980
the petrol pump fellow said that,

00:30:10.182 --> 00:30:14.900
“There is hardly one liter space there. What am I to fill in?”

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.381
And they were amazed, they did it twenty-one days. It can happen.

00:30:18.741 --> 00:30:21.899
You do not know when you say God is Almighty,

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.901
when we say that He can do whatever He wants to do.

00:30:25.101 --> 00:30:26.261
He does everything.

00:30:26.501 --> 00:30:29.981
When we say that we are not aware that what He can do.

00:30:30.253 --> 00:30:34.179
We just think that at the most He can make flowers into fruits,

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.900
at the most He can make our heart beat,

00:30:37.139 --> 00:30:40.980
at the most He can make us from amoeba to human being.

00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:42.900
But just think of it,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.420
how far He can go,

00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:47.661
and how capable He is

00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:53.410
and how full of compassion He is for His own creation.

00:30:53.861 --> 00:30:56.501
Now you have to enter into that area.

00:30:56.741 --> 00:30:58.861
First of all, unless and until you are there,

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.781
you are really blessed by God,

00:31:01.021 --> 00:31:04.170
you cannot believe it how it helps.

00:31:04.901 --> 00:31:10.100
Thirdly, the third center, is the center of your seeking,

00:31:10.341 --> 00:31:13.661
as he has told you, is the center of your seeking.

00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:16.781
Now the seeking gets satisfied

00:31:17.221 --> 00:31:22.181
in the sense that you feel you are no more to seek,

00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:24.101
now you have to give.

00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:26.701
You are asking for the light,

00:31:26.941 --> 00:31:29.900
you have got the light, and you have to give the light.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.393
But you do not develop the fanatic attitude

00:31:33.594 --> 00:31:37.135
that, “I am the right person, and you are the wrong person”

00:31:37.337 --> 00:31:40.123
and that kind of a violent nature,

00:31:40.324 --> 00:31:43.861
but you develop a very gentle and a kindly

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.301
and affectionate nature towards that person.

00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:49.141
Because you have gone through that kind of an experience,

00:31:49.381 --> 00:31:51.661
so you know that this person is ignorant.

00:31:51.901 --> 00:31:54.701
Gradually when he will see the light, he will understand.

00:31:54.981 --> 00:31:57.781
So you don’t force your way onto him, at all.

00:31:58.021 --> 00:32:01.978
On the contrary you allow that person to slowly

00:32:02.179 --> 00:32:06.740
take to it, and awaken his Kundalini and see for himself

00:32:06.981 --> 00:32:08.781
so that he should certify himself.

00:32:09.021 --> 00:32:11.141
You don’t force him to say things,

00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:12.977
you do not organize him,

00:32:13.178 --> 00:32:16.588
you do not make him a member,

00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:18.899
you do not take money from him, nothing.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.141
You leave him alone. If he wants to come, he can come.

00:32:22.381 --> 00:32:25.024
If he does not want to come, he need not come.

00:32:25.225 --> 00:32:28.221
In Sahaja Yoga, we have made it compulsory

00:32:28.461 --> 00:32:30.060
that all the centers we are running,

00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:33.421
no young boys should come who are below age

00:32:33.661 --> 00:32:35.181
without the permission of their parents,

00:32:35.421 --> 00:32:37.581
even to visit, leave alone living there.

00:32:37.821 --> 00:32:42.141
So that, that’s how we allow only those people

00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:46.700
who are grown up, adults, to come with their own wishes.

00:32:46.901 --> 00:32:48.233
They are not to be forced.

00:32:48.434 --> 00:32:51.904
If they want to go today, we’ll say, “All right, go just now.”

00:32:52.802 --> 00:32:55.741
There is no compulsion on anyone,

00:32:55.981 --> 00:32:58.981
because one thing you must know, that you cannot compel

00:32:59.181 --> 00:33:01.900
as far as your Self Realization is concerned.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.981
Because it is of no use.

00:33:04.181 --> 00:33:06.941
It has to come through your freedom,

00:33:07.141 --> 00:33:10.260
through your asking, otherwise we cannot work it out.

00:33:10.501 --> 00:33:14.221
Unless and until you ask for it, we cannot do it,

00:33:14.461 --> 00:33:15.701
it is an impossibility.

00:33:15.941 --> 00:33:18.067
So you must understand that

00:33:18.258 --> 00:33:21.093
I cannot force you to get Realization.

00:33:21.294 --> 00:33:22.581
It has to work out.

00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:26.635
If it works out, you are a lucky person. I cannot guarantee it.

00:33:26.836 --> 00:33:29.780
If it works out that means it is your own,

00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:33.381
and if it has not worked out and if you want to work Me out

00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:36.021
or anybody to work it out, they’ll work it out.

00:33:36.221 --> 00:33:39.900
But it cannot be guaranteed, it cannot be promised.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.301
So your seeking stops and what happens

00:33:43.541 --> 00:33:46.970
that you start looking at yourself

00:33:47.171 --> 00:33:49.624
and seeing your own glory,

00:33:49.815 --> 00:33:52.820
and understanding your own powers,

00:33:53.021 --> 00:33:55.061
get yourself cleaned out,

00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:00.114
and you want to give others that solace that you have got,

00:34:00.315 --> 00:34:02.661
that Realization that you have got.

00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:06.221
So, I always say that I’m the greatest capitalist,

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:09.796
because if I have all the powers I’m the greatest capitalist,

00:34:09.997 --> 00:34:11.900
and I’m the greatest communist

00:34:12.099 --> 00:34:14.701
because I cannot live without distributing you.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.821
I must distribute. When we talk of capitalism,

00:34:18.021 --> 00:34:20.099
what do you have? These stones? What do you have?

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.980
What do you distribute? The stones?

00:34:22.181 --> 00:34:23.941
And what are you a communist? What are you distributing?

00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:25.340
Only stones.

00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:29.099
So there is nothing to be proud of these worldly possessions.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.980
What you are to be proud of,

00:34:31.181 --> 00:34:33.260
or to be conscious of, is your Spirit.

00:34:33.501 --> 00:34:38.421
Spirit is the only thing that can kindle another Spirit.

00:34:38.661 --> 00:34:42.900
I have not seen any matter can kindle that joy in anyone.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.388
At the most if you give some matter to somebody, at the most,

00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:49.915
that is the only advantage of having some material thing is

00:34:50.116 --> 00:34:51.659
that you can give away,

00:34:51.861 --> 00:34:55.181
that you can express your love through some material things.

00:34:55.421 --> 00:34:58.421
But otherwise the matter has no value of any kind.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.301
But Spirit has absolute value,

00:35:01.541 --> 00:35:04.541
because it can kindle light into another’s life,

00:35:04.781 --> 00:35:08.061
and there cannot be anything better than to be given to anyone else.

00:35:08.341 --> 00:35:12.301
No amount of money, no amount of empires,

00:35:12.541 --> 00:35:15.181
nothing can give that which is the Spirit,

00:35:15.421 --> 00:35:17.461
because the Spirit is the ultimate.

00:35:17.701 --> 00:35:20.108
After that you don’t seek anything.

00:35:21.061 --> 00:35:23.821
That’s what is the Kundalini, is the true desire

00:35:24.061 --> 00:35:26.901
which wants to become the reality,

00:35:27.101 --> 00:35:29.900
which wants to become the divinity.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.261
To get divinity within you is the highest thing,

00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:35.261
and that’s what once you get,

00:35:35.501 --> 00:35:37.861
you don’t want anything else.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.741
So the seeking starts improving.

00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:43.780
Around the seeking are the Ten Commandments, you can say,

00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:46.283
or the ten primordial masters.

00:35:46.484 --> 00:35:49.701
There are many others, but the primordial masters, the ten,

00:35:49.941 --> 00:35:51.900
who came on this earth, one after another,

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.085
to teach us how to balance ourselves.

00:35:54.286 --> 00:35:57.380
After Realization I’ve seen people automatically balance.

00:35:57.621 --> 00:36:00.141
I don’t tell them anything about Ten Commandments.

00:36:00.381 --> 00:36:02.501
I don’t say “Don’t”, I never say.

00:36:02.741 --> 00:36:04.487
I said, “You get your Realization.”

00:36:04.689 --> 00:36:07.899
Once they get Realization they just start

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.900
behaving in such a manner that is extremely righteous,

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.860
extremely balanced, extremely holy.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.500
Such a person becomes immediately

00:36:18.741 --> 00:36:23.261
rid of all the horrible habits they have,

00:36:23.541 --> 00:36:28.688
all the enslavement of passion, and lust and greed.

00:36:28.889 --> 00:36:30.620
Everything drops out just like that,

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:36.232
and like a beautiful lotus they come out of that mire,

00:36:39.579 --> 00:36:41.900
that darkness, into light.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.139
And then in the light they see it so clearly,

00:36:46.341 --> 00:36:49.460
that this is not the thing that I can have,

00:36:49.701 --> 00:36:51.900
this is not the thing that I can wear,

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.821
and immediately they give it up.

00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:56.661
That’s how you become a new personality.

00:36:56.901 --> 00:36:58.927
This religion is born within you.

00:36:59.128 --> 00:37:02.471
Now we talk of religion, this religion that religion, that religion.

00:37:02.672 --> 00:37:04.420
Everybody is talking of different religions

00:37:04.661 --> 00:37:06.021
and dogmas, and this and that,

00:37:06.222 --> 00:37:08.221
and only fighting everywhere you go.

00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:10.821
They are fighting among each other, it’s still going on.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.540
It’s endless; they are all fighting morning till evening.

00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:17.541
Then I have seen also some people who try to unite religions

00:37:17.781 --> 00:37:21.020
and there also they have nothing but all the devils put together,

00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:22.900
all devils joined together to unite.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.341
There is nothing of reality in them.

00:37:25.581 --> 00:37:29.100
So the people are puzzled, “What is happening to religion?”

00:37:29.301 --> 00:37:32.621
These organized religions also can be very dangerous.

00:37:32.901 --> 00:37:35.701
They can put you into such norms that you can really

00:37:35.941 --> 00:37:38.621
get absolutely brain-washed,

00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:41.421
and you start believing that what you are doing is correct,

00:37:41.661 --> 00:37:44.221
without understanding why are you doing it.

00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:47.661
Most of the things tell, “This is a mystery, that is a mystery.”

00:37:47.901 --> 00:37:49.461
Then why, what are you doing there?

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:51.498
If it is a mystery, it is better you give up.

00:37:51.699 --> 00:37:54.392
But they’ll just brand you that “This is mystery, that is mystery”.

00:37:54.593 --> 00:37:55.780
You have to accept.

00:37:55.981 --> 00:37:58.021
But what is the advantage of that kind of a life,

00:37:58.221 --> 00:37:59.420
nobody wants to see.

00:37:59.661 --> 00:38:02.860
As I told you, that Christ has asked for one thing,

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.701
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

00:38:05.941 --> 00:38:10.830
and let us see which religious organization

00:38:11.031 --> 00:38:12.621
has granted that to people.

00:38:12.861 --> 00:38:16.076
It’s only your Spirit, when It is awakened and reborn,

00:38:16.277 --> 00:38:18.340
you can have that innocence within you.

00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:21.741
As it is today, it’s getting late,

00:38:21.981 --> 00:38:24.261
but I have to tell you that the chakras

00:38:24.501 --> 00:38:27.821
as he explained, I am just giving you the powers of every chakra.

00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:34.847
And the power of the chakra of heart is tremendous.

00:38:35.701 --> 00:38:39.600
It gives you the fearlessness.

00:38:40.289 --> 00:38:42.941
When the child is about twelve years of age,

00:38:43.141 --> 00:38:47.899
in this sternum bone, the antibodies are created by this chakra.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.235
And they are sent all over the body

00:38:50.436 --> 00:38:54.899
to fight the disease or any kind of an attack on the personality.

00:38:55.169 --> 00:38:59.981
Now, these are actually looked after by the deity in that center,

00:39:00.301 --> 00:39:04.741
and this deity, when gets the message,

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.900
She informs all the antibodies that “You have to fight.”

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.750
And all of them will go at that point, join together,

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:19.100
to fight the enemy of life, enemy of God.

00:39:19.722 --> 00:39:23.540
Like now we are having, now I’m here,

00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:27.100
and Americans are to be realized,

00:39:27.341 --> 00:39:29.860
and we have to do something about America.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.420
Then knowing that how America is important -

00:39:33.661 --> 00:39:36.899
I’ll tell you where America is in this body -

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.701
people from Australia, from India,

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.460
from France, from all over,

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.100
have come down here.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.101
All the way they have come,

00:39:50.461 --> 00:39:53.140
just to give Realization to Americans.

00:39:53.341 --> 00:39:57.020
All of them. I never forced anybody, I never asked anybody,

00:39:57.221 --> 00:39:59.981
they just came forward, “Mother, we are going to go with You,

00:40:00.181 --> 00:40:03.855
and we are going to do this great work of Realization

00:40:04.056 --> 00:40:07.460
to people of America who are seekers.”

00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:10.941
They all have come on their own, spending their own money,

00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:13.206
and they are doing this work with Me.

00:40:13.407 --> 00:40:19.905
So you can image what a great attraction it must be,

00:40:20.106 --> 00:40:24.301
what a great attachment it must be, for the seekers of America,

00:40:24.541 --> 00:40:27.861
that they have come all the way. They are all people on big jobs

00:40:28.062 --> 00:40:31.029
one is a doctor, another is an architect, another is this,

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:34.900
all of them sacrificing their money, everything, time

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.819
have come down here to be with Me for these two months

00:40:39.021 --> 00:40:41.231
to work for America, from all over.

00:40:41.432 --> 00:40:43.948
We have some people who are actresses

00:40:44.149 --> 00:40:50.230
in the English drama

00:40:50.432 --> 00:40:53.461
or some are directors and things like that.

00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:55.181
They all have come here.

00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:57.061
In your Boston we have at least,

00:40:57.261 --> 00:40:59.900
I think, ten people from ten countries.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.889
So you can imagine how is the whole attention, the priority.

00:41:06.091 --> 00:41:09.261
This is the important thing. They must get Realization.

00:41:09.552 --> 00:41:11.621
They do not get any money out of it;

00:41:11.861 --> 00:41:13.900
they do not get any reward out of it,

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:18.020
only the satisfaction that so many have got Realization.

00:41:18.335 --> 00:41:21.461
The more, the merrier. When they see more people coming

00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:24.899
getting Realization, you must see their faces, they lit up.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.341
This kind of a personality people have not seen.

00:41:28.701 --> 00:41:30.500
I had one bishop

00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:33.659
who came to stay with Me in My house in London,

00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:36.061
and when he saw Sahaja Yogis, he said,

00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:39.100
“This is a rare caste and community. I have never seen such a...

00:41:39.461 --> 00:41:42.341
So I’ve been telling people to do little things

00:41:42.581 --> 00:41:44.981
in life, they cannot do it and look at these people,

00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:49.261
how beautiful they are. I can’t believe how can they be so nice.”

00:41:49.501 --> 00:41:51.661
Because your Spirit is beautiful,

00:41:51.901 --> 00:41:53.701
the Spirit is glorious,

00:41:53.941 --> 00:41:55.741
and when you become that,

00:41:55.981 --> 00:41:59.021
automatically it starts manifesting its beauty.

00:41:59.221 --> 00:42:02.100
You don’t have to tell yourself, you’ll be amazed at yourself

00:42:02.341 --> 00:42:04.460
how you have become so beautiful,

00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:07.021
and so good and so nice.

00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:10.661
So this quality of fearlessness comes to you

00:42:10.901 --> 00:42:12.900
because your antibodies

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.460
are completely charged with the power of the Spirit.

00:42:17.821 --> 00:42:21.181
And you start understanding what sort of a disease is coming,

00:42:21.461 --> 00:42:23.661
what sort of an attack is coming,

00:42:23.893 --> 00:42:26.024
and your body knows how to fight it.

00:42:26.225 --> 00:42:29.341
You know how to fight it, and when you know that,

00:42:29.542 --> 00:42:31.732
you are not afraid of any disease whatsoever,

00:42:31.933 --> 00:42:33.380
even it is cancer, anything,

00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:37.260
people know how to fight it themselves and for others.

00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:41.540
Now the higher chakra is of Vishuddhi chakra

00:42:41.741 --> 00:42:45.021
and this chakra is what America is.

00:42:45.221 --> 00:42:48.460
In the Universe this is the chakra,

00:42:48.701 --> 00:42:53.039
Vishuddhi chakra, is what America represents.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.621
Because America has a responsibility,

00:42:55.861 --> 00:42:57.765
this center has the responsibility.

00:42:58.006 --> 00:43:00.408
When they raise the head,

00:43:02.278 --> 00:43:05.021
human beings, then this center developed

00:43:05.221 --> 00:43:08.129
the responsibility to be human beings.

00:43:09.221 --> 00:43:11.900
And the responsibility of spirituality

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.924
lies on the shoulders of Americans.

00:43:15.581 --> 00:43:20.071
You had great people like Abraham Lincoln,

00:43:20.272 --> 00:43:24.500
very great people here professing about

00:43:25.781 --> 00:43:29.301
freedom of your country and big ideal things.

00:43:29.664 --> 00:43:33.341
But to My dismay I find: where are those gone?

00:43:33.581 --> 00:43:35.211
Where are those people

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:38.141
who will take the responsibility of spirituality?

00:43:38.381 --> 00:43:42.421
They are lost with fake gurus, they are lost with cults,

00:43:42.661 --> 00:43:46.780
they are lost with all kinds of things and where are they?

00:43:46.981 --> 00:43:50.100
It’s such a sad thing that the responsibility

00:43:50.301 --> 00:43:52.380
which was on the shoulders of Americans

00:43:52.621 --> 00:43:55.581
has been not properly tackled, at all.

00:43:55.782 --> 00:43:59.021
But now the time is – though we start slowly,

00:43:59.221 --> 00:44:02.341
let us take up the responsibility and see for ourselves,

00:44:02.581 --> 00:44:05.900
what we can do for our countrymen, for our people,

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.500
and on the hole for the whole world.

00:44:08.741 --> 00:44:11.940
You can do a lot, because that is your specialty

00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:15.333
that is your job, which has to be done.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.141
Now this chakra gives you the power to be the witness.

00:44:20.381 --> 00:44:23.181
First power you get that you become the witness

00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:26.581
– witness of everything. The whole thing becomes like a drama,

00:44:26.821 --> 00:44:30.420
like you are in the water, and then you suddenly come in a boat

00:44:30.661 --> 00:44:34.501
and you start seeing the play of all these waves.

00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:37.487
You are no more afraid, you just start seeing it as a drama;

00:44:37.689 --> 00:44:39.074
you become a witness.

00:44:39.275 --> 00:44:41.549
The second thing that happens to you with this,

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.061
that you become collectively conscious.

00:44:44.261 --> 00:44:48.460
Your hands, if this chakra is good, start feeling the cool breeze,

00:44:48.661 --> 00:44:52.820
start feeling the chakras of yourself and chakras of other people.

00:44:53.021 --> 00:44:55.340
With your hands you can cure people,

00:44:55.541 --> 00:44:57.661
with your hands you can raise the Kundalini,

00:44:57.862 --> 00:44:59.581
with your hands you can give Realization.

00:44:59.821 --> 00:45:02.743
These hands become powerful things.

00:45:03.261 --> 00:45:06.261
Even the movement of these hands has a meaning;

00:45:06.493 --> 00:45:08.268
everything has a meaning.

00:45:08.469 --> 00:45:12.100
Whatever it does, little fingers, they all have a meaning

00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:14.420
and because they get enlightened.

00:45:14.661 --> 00:45:16.781
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

00:45:16.982 --> 00:45:20.389
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

00:45:21.397 --> 00:45:24.540
Now if you talk to any Muslims,

00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:28.139
they will say, “We have never heard of Resurrection day.”

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.326
Find in the Koran, if you see,

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:33.029
most of it is dealt with the resurrection day,

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:36.290
and the doomsday is very little.

00:45:36.914 --> 00:45:39.100
But people will talk about the doomsday

00:45:39.301 --> 00:45:41.621
because they can frighten others with that

00:45:41.861 --> 00:45:45.181
and have their own cults and own things.

00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:48.781
But actually the resurrection day is the most important thing.

00:45:49.021 --> 00:45:53.246
And for which Mohammed Sahib has clearly said the future.

00:45:53.447 --> 00:45:56.421
He didn’t say that, “I’m the last, now nothing is going to happen.”

00:45:56.661 --> 00:46:01.061
He said, “At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak.”

00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:03.061
And that’s exactly what happens,

00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:06.460
that you start feeling others on your fingertips.

00:46:06.741 --> 00:46:08.505
You know through your fingertips

00:46:08.707 --> 00:46:12.421
what centers are catching in another person or in yourself also,

00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:16.301
and immediately you start improving it, if you know how to do it.

00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:19.581
And that’s what you have to learn: is the divine technique,

00:46:19.782 --> 00:46:25.377
the true knowledge, of how to handle this power of Divine Love,

00:46:25.578 --> 00:46:27.677
that is flowing through you.

00:46:28.168 --> 00:46:31.900
So this center is very important, I think, for Americans.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.940
It has one side by which people are aggressive.

00:46:36.141 --> 00:46:41.155
When they talk they’re bumptious, they are ego oriented,

00:46:41.356 --> 00:46:43.701
they try to suppress others by their speeches

00:46:43.941 --> 00:46:46.420
and try to dominate others when they talk

00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:48.354
– these are the right sided people.

00:46:48.555 --> 00:46:51.981
The other side are the left sided people when they feel guilty,

00:46:52.181 --> 00:46:54.661
they think they have done this wrong, and that wrong,

00:46:54.901 --> 00:46:56.421
they should not have done this wrong.

00:46:56.661 --> 00:46:58.461
Actually I’ve seen that in America

00:46:58.701 --> 00:47:01.741
most of the people have problems here, most surprising,

00:47:01.981 --> 00:47:04.692
They are all the time shaking their neck like this, all the time.

00:47:04.893 --> 00:47:08.061
In My program also I’ve seen, they have always a problem here.

00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:11.581
The thing is that they have a greater responsibility

00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:13.484
to keep this center the best,

00:47:13.679 --> 00:47:16.449
by keeping the responsibility of spirituality

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.900
quite the highest priority.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.301
They should have the highest priority.

00:47:22.541 --> 00:47:24.906
But what you find that all the people are coming

00:47:25.107 --> 00:47:27.300
from all over the world to help the Americans.

00:47:27.501 --> 00:47:30.866
A day should come when the Americans should go all over the world

00:47:31.067 --> 00:47:32.261
to give Realization.

00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:34.646
And I’m sure that day will come one day

00:47:34.821 --> 00:47:37.485
when you will grow up to that sense of responsibility

00:47:37.686 --> 00:47:40.304
when this center will really stand up,

00:47:40.505 --> 00:47:42.903
as a spiritual personality.

00:47:43.261 --> 00:47:47.442
Now, the higher center is of Agnya chakra which

00:47:47.644 --> 00:47:52.202
he has told you about, is the center when you get Realization,

00:47:52.403 --> 00:47:54.540
and when the Kundalini rises above that,

00:47:54.741 --> 00:47:57.598
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:47:58.054 --> 00:48:02.980
Now at this time you get the power first of all of curing people.

00:48:03.253 --> 00:48:05.021
If you touch somebody, he’s cured.

00:48:05.221 --> 00:48:07.021
If you say something, that happens.

00:48:07.221 --> 00:48:10.420
If you go in the house, something good comes in that house.

00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:12.858
Auspiciousness starts working through you,

00:48:12.978 --> 00:48:14.412
when this center is opened.

00:48:14.613 --> 00:48:16.381
But one should not leave at that center,

00:48:16.621 --> 00:48:19.604
because if you start moving onto the left, or to the right,

00:48:19.805 --> 00:48:21.620
you'll get into problems.

00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:24.621
If that center starts moving onto the right,

00:48:24.822 --> 00:48:27.861
then you start seeing visions, which is a very wrong thing.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.179
You go into the realm of supra-conscious

00:48:30.381 --> 00:48:32.221
or into the collective supra-conscious,

00:48:32.461 --> 00:48:34.861
by you can become a very ego oriented person.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.899
You can be a very violent, hot tempered, quarrelsome person.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.221
Actually, Hitler used this.

00:48:41.461 --> 00:48:44.941
Hitler used this method from the lamas he learnt,

00:48:45.141 --> 00:48:48.900
and he put people onto the right side of the supraconscious,

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.779
into collective supraconscious and put the spirits, dead spirits,

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:58.261
who were of the people who were extremely ambitious and cruel.

00:48:58.581 --> 00:49:00.900
That’s how this cruelty came into the Germans

00:49:01.062 --> 00:49:02.985
and they forgot what they were.

00:49:03.187 --> 00:49:04.661
They forgot they were human beings,

00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:06.900
the way they killed, the way they behaved,

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.581
it’s impossible for any human being to do that.

00:49:09.782 --> 00:49:11.880
But he managed this, and is written down

00:49:12.081 --> 00:49:16.221
that he got all this from lamas from Tibet.

00:49:16.461 --> 00:49:18.900
From there he got the knowledge how to put people

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.540
onto the collective supraconscious.

00:49:21.741 --> 00:49:24.021
Now the people who can go to the left side,

00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:27.541
also start curing people, they start...

00:49:28.877 --> 00:49:31.581
In such a company you might just get stunned.

00:49:31.821 --> 00:49:34.261
If you face such a person you might just get stunned.

00:49:34.501 --> 00:49:41.020
Or you might get a kind of a complete attraction for such a person

00:49:41.221 --> 00:49:44.380
You might get completely under the domination of such a person.

00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:47.061
You might surrender completely to such a person,

00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:48.975
and you will not know what you are doing,

00:49:49.176 --> 00:49:51.475
till that person has completely destroyed you.

00:49:51.676 --> 00:49:54.500
This type of people have these horrible powers

00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:57.141
because they enter into the collective subconscious.

00:49:57.381 --> 00:49:59.683
And when they enter into the collective subconscious,

00:49:59.884 --> 00:50:04.021
they gather those spirits, which they use.

00:50:04.865 --> 00:50:08.900
But the people, who as it is, move to the left side,

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:14.261
who cry, weep, emotional, feel guilty all the time

00:50:14.501 --> 00:50:17.621
miserable people, they jump onto the left side.

00:50:17.861 --> 00:50:20.713
Now all the diseases, practically most of them,

00:50:20.914 --> 00:50:24.668
like AIDS, like cancer, like myelitis.

00:50:24.869 --> 00:50:27.661
All these diseases come from the left sided entry

00:50:27.901 --> 00:50:29.941
and is accepted by the doctors;

00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:32.781
because I’ve seen a very good film made by the doctors,

00:50:32.982 --> 00:50:34.500
who were researching on cancer,

00:50:34.741 --> 00:50:37.581
that when the body is vulnerable to these diseases,

00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:41.741
means when you are over-exerting yourself,

00:50:41.981 --> 00:50:45.341
when there is too much of sympathetic activity in a person,

00:50:45.581 --> 00:50:48.821
and when a person is absolutely fagged out with it,

00:50:49.061 --> 00:50:51.162
at that time, they say,

00:50:51.363 --> 00:50:53.715
that these diseases are triggered into you,

00:50:53.858 --> 00:50:55.380
that somebody triggers it.

00:50:55.581 --> 00:51:00.191
And what is this they call, is the protein 52, and protein 58,

00:51:00.392 --> 00:51:02.643
and all these names they give because doctors don’t know

00:51:02.844 --> 00:51:04.112
that they are dead spirits.

00:51:04.314 --> 00:51:06.888
And these are the things when they enter into you

00:51:07.089 --> 00:51:08.237
then they trigger it.

00:51:08.439 --> 00:51:10.235
But they say something very right,

00:51:10.355 --> 00:51:12.399
and that is that these things come

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.572
from the area built in you since your creation,

00:51:15.773 --> 00:51:18.392
means your collective subconscious.

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:20.821
And that I have been saying for so many years.

00:51:21.061 --> 00:51:22.660
Now recently I saw this film.

00:51:22.861 --> 00:51:26.661
So they are coming to the same point, but after such a long time,

00:51:26.901 --> 00:51:28.581
that it is triggered by them.

00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:32.540
So those people who go too much to the left get this trouble.

00:51:33.061 --> 00:51:38.460
Those who go too much to the right get heart trouble, heart attacks;

00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:42.620
but not the slow attack, because heart has double type of attacks,

00:51:42.821 --> 00:51:46.060
it can a be slow heart or it can be a fast heart.

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:49.061
The people who go on the right side have everything fast,

00:51:49.261 --> 00:51:51.821
liver is moving fast, everything moving fast,

00:51:52.022 --> 00:51:55.069
it’s such a speedy temperament because they are so speedy.

00:51:55.271 --> 00:51:57.873
In the morning they’ll get up, “Now I have to go to the office”

00:51:58.016 --> 00:52:00.332
and they’ll be taking the breakfast in one hand,

00:52:00.533 --> 00:52:02.951
putting one foot in the trousers,

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:06.381
and another hand into the coat, running to the car,

00:52:06.621 --> 00:52:09.301
and there's a big another jam coming up

00:52:09.581 --> 00:52:12.899
and then swearing at everything and it’s a mess throughout.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.781
And the whole body gets messed up.

00:52:15.021 --> 00:52:17.414
And when the whole body gets messed up,

00:52:17.525 --> 00:52:19.875
then what happens, that your speedometer

00:52:20.076 --> 00:52:22.420
which is the spleen also goes out of order

00:52:22.621 --> 00:52:25.301
and you develop a funny type of temperament.

00:52:25.541 --> 00:52:28.061
If you say them that, “We have to go now to the airport”

00:52:28.261 --> 00:52:30.621
you see them absolutely gone as they are wobbly.

00:52:30.861 --> 00:52:33.900
The whole machine goes off, you don’t know why,

00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:36.270
if you ask them, “What’s the …?” “Oh! I have to go to the airport.”

00:52:36.471 --> 00:52:39.541
So what? Even the name of the airport can put people like that.

00:52:39.781 --> 00:52:43.221
So they become absolutely uneasy people,

00:52:43.461 --> 00:52:47.661
and this kind of thing when happens, you see, you are in for trouble

00:52:47.862 --> 00:52:49.657
you are very much in for trouble.

00:52:49.864 --> 00:52:52.282
And this is to be balanced and put right

00:52:52.483 --> 00:52:55.044
through your Kundalini awakening.

00:52:55.701 --> 00:52:58.380
Now this center as you know, is the most important center

00:52:58.582 --> 00:53:02.100
because this is the gate to the Kingdom of God,

00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:05.259
and is governed by our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:53:05.461 --> 00:53:07.900
who is the embodiment of innocence.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:12.237
Here He does not incarnate, there He incarnates on this earth.

00:53:12.438 --> 00:53:16.969
Now, His crucifixion was fixed, and He was to be crucified

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:21.954
to show that He is eternal life, which does not die.

00:53:22.155 --> 00:53:25.380
He is Chaitanya; He is made of all these vibrations.

00:53:25.581 --> 00:53:27.781
So He could walk on the water also,

00:53:28.021 --> 00:53:32.822
and He could pass through that tight closeness

00:53:33.036 --> 00:53:38.300
of these two balloon-like structures, ego and superego,

00:53:38.501 --> 00:53:42.261
and could settle there to establish that center for us,

00:53:42.501 --> 00:53:44.501
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

00:53:44.741 --> 00:53:47.420
which controls your ego and superego, both.

00:53:47.661 --> 00:53:52.341
But most surprising, the people who are, say, Catholics

00:53:52.581 --> 00:53:55.781
are the people who use their superego.

00:53:56.021 --> 00:53:59.141
They get conditioned very much, this should not be done,

00:53:59.381 --> 00:54:03.861
confessions, weeping, crying, unhappy...

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:05.580
"We have to be miserable"… Why?

00:54:05.781 --> 00:54:09.540
Christ has been crucified for you. He has suffered for you.

00:54:09.741 --> 00:54:12.581
Why? If you have accepted Christ, you should be joyous.

00:54:12.821 --> 00:54:14.292
Only to be awakened Christ,

00:54:14.475 --> 00:54:17.873
so that you get your Realization, that’s all. What is there to cry?

00:54:18.074 --> 00:54:20.900
If they are, say Protestants and all that...

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:22.980
I took My birth in Protestant religion,

00:54:23.181 --> 00:54:24.941
and many Hindus and Muslims ask Me,

00:54:25.141 --> 00:54:27.900
“Mother, why did You take Your birth in Protestant religion?”

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.900
So I said, “They are very sophisticated fanatics,

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.900
because they rationalize everything.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.900
They rationalize God, they rationalize every dogma, everything

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.900
it’s such a thinking going on there,

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.380
So it is very difficult to push them back,

00:54:40.621 --> 00:54:43.780
that God is not thinking, God is beyond thought,

00:54:43.981 --> 00:54:46.461
God is beyond your mind. Mind is limited.

00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:48.105
You have to go beyond that,

00:54:48.306 --> 00:54:51.420
and that’s why Christ crossed that limit by His resurrection.

00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:54.092
So His message is His resurrection

00:54:54.266 --> 00:54:58.521
and His resurrection has given us a special quality,

00:54:58.722 --> 00:55:00.518
that once He is awakened within us,

00:55:00.719 --> 00:55:03.781
the both these ego and superego are sucked in by Him.

00:55:04.021 --> 00:55:05.941
That means He died for our sins,

00:55:06.141 --> 00:55:08.581
so that He sucked our sins, our karmas,

00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:10.996
everything sucked in and this opens out.

00:55:11.197 --> 00:55:14.141
Once this opens out, the Kundalini comes out.

00:55:14.342 --> 00:55:16.900
And this is what He has done such a great work

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.661
that He has died for our sins

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:21.351
and when He is awakened,

00:55:21.941 --> 00:55:25.035
both these institutions are sucked in,

00:55:25.236 --> 00:55:27.101
and you become

00:55:28.541 --> 00:55:31.061
egoless, superegoless,

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:33.900
you become de-conditioned automatically.

00:55:34.101 --> 00:55:38.100
Now this great incarnation was called as Mahavishnu

00:55:38.341 --> 00:55:40.900
and is described in the ancient books

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.339
about fourteen thousand years back, by Markandeya.

00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:46.900
But people could not relate it to that,

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.900
because when Christians went from here,

00:55:49.101 --> 00:55:51.604
they went in a different mode, it was a political stunt.

00:55:51.805 --> 00:55:54.899
You see, they carried a gun in one hand and a Bible in another hand.

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.014
Such people could not communicate with other people,

00:55:58.216 --> 00:55:59.857
who had everything with them,

00:56:00.058 --> 00:56:03.261
and they never read those books to them, it was all prohibited.

00:56:03.501 --> 00:56:07.661
Bible is too small a book to contain a character like Christ.

00:56:08.141 --> 00:56:09.637
He was too great a man,

00:56:09.838 --> 00:56:11.899
and we should have gone all out to see

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.141
what He’s described in other scriptures,

00:56:14.421 --> 00:56:16.261
how He’s talked about, let us find out.

00:56:16.501 --> 00:56:18.261
We should have been open minded about it.

00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:20.901
Instead of that people just laughed

00:56:21.101 --> 00:56:24.466
and mocked at all these old books, the Scriptures,

00:56:24.667 --> 00:56:26.188
and they thought they are the wisest.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:29.821
This is the worst part is that the ego thinks they are the highest,

00:56:30.061 --> 00:56:32.021
they are the best, they can do what they like

00:56:32.221 --> 00:56:33.661
and that is how they lived.

00:56:33.901 --> 00:56:36.861
But thank God, now, people are realizing

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.420
that we have missed the point, we have definitely missed the point.

00:56:40.661 --> 00:56:42.894
So we have to see what He was

00:56:43.095 --> 00:56:46.061
before He came on this earth,

00:56:46.261 --> 00:56:50.900
in the Heaven, how He was created, how He was Alpha and Omega,

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.500
what was His own nature, for what purpose He came,

00:56:54.741 --> 00:56:57.661
and why He died, why He was resurrected,

00:56:57.901 --> 00:57:00.140
why this drama was to be carried out?

00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:04.341
For this, only three and a half years of Christ cannot explain,

00:57:04.581 --> 00:57:08.021
and people cannot tell us why all these things happened.

00:57:08.221 --> 00:57:10.900
We have to keep a very open mind about Christ,

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.460
and we have to see with our own eyes how it works out.

00:57:14.781 --> 00:57:16.900
In Kundalini awakening you’ll be surprised,

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.900
when the Kundalini stops here,

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.967
and this chakra is closed,

00:57:21.168 --> 00:57:25.100
then you have to say the Lord’s prayer, everywhere,

00:57:25.461 --> 00:57:27.461
whether you are a Jew, you are a Muslim,

00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:29.821
you are a Hindu or a Christian.

00:57:30.061 --> 00:57:32.900
From whatever community you become a yogi,

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.460
you become a realized soul, you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

00:57:36.741 --> 00:57:38.212
because the Kundalini won’t rise,

00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:43.061
and that is the one of the greatest proof

00:57:43.261 --> 00:57:44.980
that Christ resides here.

00:57:45.181 --> 00:57:48.501
If you do not say the Lord’s Prayer, it doesn’t work out.

00:57:48.741 --> 00:57:50.940
So Lord’s Prayer is a mantra, is a chanting,

00:57:51.141 --> 00:57:53.417
but is to be said by a person who is a realized soul,

00:57:53.618 --> 00:57:54.980
who is authorized for you.

00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:57.181
Otherwise it is called as anadhikar cheshta,

00:57:57.421 --> 00:57:59.260
means the person who has no right,

00:57:59.461 --> 00:58:02.021
is trying to do something, is doing a wrong thing.

00:58:02.221 --> 00:58:05.100
So those who are realized souls, when they say

00:58:05.341 --> 00:58:08.900
this mantra, then this center is opened up,

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.500
Christ is awakened, and you are allowed

00:58:11.737 --> 00:58:14.682
to see, allow your Kundalini to pass through it

00:58:14.883 --> 00:58:18.900
and enter into the realm of this limbic area

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:26.100
where is one thousand petaled Lotus remains.

00:58:26.595 --> 00:58:29.461
Now these petals then open up,

00:58:29.741 --> 00:58:32.900
because of the pressure being reduced

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.770
of the ego and super ego,

00:58:34.971 --> 00:58:40.021
and they are in different beautiful colored flames.

00:58:40.295 --> 00:58:43.981
The outside starts with a just like

00:58:44.181 --> 00:58:47.085
from vibgyor if you take it, from

00:58:47.301 --> 00:58:51.380
Vibgyor in the same way they start, but very slowly moving

00:58:51.621 --> 00:58:54.394
and the end ones are like crystal, crystal,

00:58:54.595 --> 00:58:56.541
absolutely like crystal, they’re shinning.

00:58:56.781 --> 00:58:58.860
And when the Kundalini comes out of it

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.621
you see the whole thing opened out, the whole chakra opens out.

00:59:02.861 --> 00:59:07.181
This is a very important center which has to be opened out

00:59:07.421 --> 00:59:10.141
because here all the seven centers are there.

00:59:10.381 --> 00:59:12.970
For example, we have got here at the back,

00:59:13.171 --> 00:59:16.755
if you start here, from here if you start, is the Mooladhara,

00:59:16.956 --> 00:59:19.466
and then around it is the Swadisthana,

00:59:19.641 --> 00:59:22.866
and here is the Nabhi, and then it is the Heart.

00:59:23.067 --> 00:59:26.411
See now. This is the hole which has to open,

00:59:26.612 --> 00:59:27.957
and this is the Heart,

00:59:28.158 --> 00:59:31.900
means if there is a dirty heart,

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:35.100
if there is a closed heart, if it is a tired heart,

00:59:35.341 --> 00:59:38.819
if there is a sick heart, then this doesn’t open.

00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:41.861
So in the heart resides the Spirit,

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:44.420
and that’s why this is the seat of the Spirit,

00:59:44.661 --> 00:59:46.181
but it resides in the heart.

00:59:46.421 --> 00:59:49.541
So when this opens out,

00:59:51.341 --> 00:59:54.047
this flower-like lotus opens out,

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:57.181
then the Kundalini rises in Her own glory,

00:59:57.382 --> 00:59:59.821
and you get your Realization, as you got it.

01:00:00.061 --> 01:00:02.981
Now as I told you, it is the beginning.

01:00:03.341 --> 01:00:04.900
In the Bible it is said,

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.900
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

01:00:08.108 --> 01:00:10.603
and you can see it. I see it every day,

01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:12.661
the beautiful tongues of flames.

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.261
But you can’t see it because you are in it.

01:00:15.541 --> 01:00:19.180
Whatever you see, you are not, so you have to first become.

01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:21.981
Once you become and you grow into that,

01:00:22.181 --> 01:00:25.581
then you can also start seeing, but just now you have to become.

01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:28.819
Supposing you see the light, means you are not the light.

01:00:29.021 --> 01:00:30.981
If you see anything, you are not that.

01:00:31.181 --> 01:00:36.336
So the question is of becoming, of actualizing and growing into it

01:00:36.537 --> 01:00:39.141
and knowing about everything that you do,

01:00:39.381 --> 01:00:42.221
Everything should be knowledgeable and should be understood,

01:00:42.461 --> 01:00:44.100
should be logical.

01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:47.981
I hope it works out in this place.
I have told you all about chakras.

01:00:48.181 --> 01:00:51.900
Tomorrow what to do after Self Realization I’ll tell you.

01:00:53.035 --> 01:00:55.191
And we'll have another session here in this hall,

01:00:55.392 --> 01:00:56.762
luckily we have got it,

01:00:56.963 --> 01:00:59.531
and we have decided to have one more program tomorrow.

01:00:59.732 --> 01:01:02.581
I hope it will be nice tomorrow and it won’t rain so much.

01:01:02.821 --> 01:01:05.380
So call all your friends. I will tell you what’s to be done

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:08.177
after Realization, what is the situation.

01:01:08.357 --> 01:01:10.978
So, may God bless you. Thank you.
