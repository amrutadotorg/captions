00:01.570 --> 00:05.890
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:08.129 --> 00:11.010
Definitely it is evident today

00:11.210 --> 00:14.929
that you have come here all the way in the rain

00:15.250 --> 00:19.970
to seek the truth, that you are real seekers.

00:25.210 --> 00:28.529
And the real seekers

00:28.730 --> 00:31.930
will find the real way.

00:32.130 --> 00:37.828
Whatever they may do, whatever wrong path they may take,

00:38.029 --> 00:42.014
they may identify themselves with wrong things also,

00:42.215 --> 00:44.942
and may oppose in the beginning the truth,

00:45.143 --> 00:50.530
but ultimately they will all find the real path,

00:50.770 --> 00:55.865
as long as they do not try to deceive themselves.

01:02.850 --> 01:06.288
The awakening of the Kundalini

01:06.490 --> 01:10.969
is not a new thing as you people may be thinking.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.569
It has been done since

01:14.770 --> 01:18.481
sixteenth century back,

01:18.682 --> 01:24.219
when it is said Indra, the God King,

01:24.426 --> 01:26.849
was given Realization.

01:27.050 --> 01:28.824
So you can imagine,

01:29.025 --> 01:32.243
that is called as Siddhendra,

01:32.445 --> 01:37.970
means the Indra first made a hole here.

01:38.628 --> 01:42.529
And there’s a place where it was done in India.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.376
It’s a very ancient thing,

01:44.544 --> 01:46.849
and at the time of Rama also,

01:47.050 --> 01:49.126
there was a fellow called Nachiketa

01:49.327 --> 01:53.878
who came to Rama’s father-in-law, Janaka,

01:54.079 --> 01:58.720
and asked Him if he could get his Self Realization.

01:59.290 --> 02:02.049
And the father-in-law said that

02:02.250 --> 02:05.649
“You can ask anything but not for your Realization.”

02:05.850 --> 02:09.119
He said, “No, I don’t want anything else but Realization”.

02:09.320 --> 02:14.626
And they say that He put him to test, many a times, for years,

02:14.827 --> 02:17.929
and then he was the first who got Realization,

02:18.129 --> 02:20.905
at the time of Shri Rama.

02:21.687 --> 02:27.744
It is very interesting that how this system of Self Realization,

02:27.946 --> 02:32.058
was kept more or less exclusive, and rather secretive,

02:32.259 --> 02:36.140
because the people would like always

02:36.341 --> 02:40.440
to use this method to make some money out of it;

02:40.863 --> 02:44.211
that they would not respect the reality,

02:44.412 --> 02:49.429
and would learn, say about your chakras, Kundalini,

02:49.630 --> 02:53.050
this, that, few words and start selling books

02:53.450 --> 02:56.450
or posing that they are born again,

02:56.633 --> 02:58.768
and impressing others with it,

02:58.970 --> 03:03.928
and try to make some cults or some sort of groups,

03:04.129 --> 03:07.489
just forming into some falsehood.

03:07.918 --> 03:11.329
And that is the reason this was kept quite a secret.

03:11.530 --> 03:15.929
But on the right hand side of the seeking,

03:16.129 --> 03:19.929
they tried to find out the ways and methods

03:20.129 --> 03:24.689
how to initiate the elements within us, the casual of elements,

03:24.890 --> 03:27.649
first to initiate the causal of the elements,

03:27.890 --> 03:32.089
by which we could control the elements for our own purpose.

03:32.290 --> 03:36.449
This was one way where they called it as the Yagnya and all that.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.666
And that’s how the Vedas were written.

03:38.867 --> 03:42.129
Veda means vida, means to know.

03:42.330 --> 03:45.783
These were written to say that you have to know.

03:45.984 --> 03:49.010
And at the very beginning of the Vedas, it is written

03:49.330 --> 03:52.152
that after reading this book, throughout,

03:52.353 --> 03:55.784
if you have not known the truth,

03:55.927 --> 03:58.809
it is of no use to you.

03:59.010 --> 04:02.569
The very first stanza says so.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.440
So the whole thing was done with that idea,

04:05.642 --> 04:08.757
and in the ancient country of India,

04:08.958 --> 04:11.093
they started working on the right side

04:11.294 --> 04:14.818
to know this subtle body

04:15.033 --> 04:18.314
or the subtle Deities of all the elements

04:18.515 --> 04:21.890
so that they could master the elements; this was first idea.

04:22.129 --> 04:26.843
On the left hand side, they started another kind of a search,

04:27.044 --> 04:29.930
in believing that there is God,

04:30.130 --> 04:32.570
and we have to ask the help of God.

04:32.810 --> 04:35.903
And they started praying,

04:36.102 --> 04:38.169
first to Primordial Mother,

04:38.370 --> 04:42.529
because in every religion there is a place for the Mother.

04:42.730 --> 04:47.649
There’s no religion which does not believe in the Primordial Mother.

04:47.850 --> 04:50.570
You can say that at the time of Mohammed Sahib,

04:50.850 --> 04:54.289
He didn’t talk much about it, because the time was such.

04:54.490 --> 04:56.359
But His own daughter

04:56.560 --> 04:59.597
was an incarnation of the Primordial Mother,

04:59.788 --> 05:01.569
whose name was Fatima Bi.

05:01.770 --> 05:06.061
And the two sons that were born to Her, are the sons

05:06.263 --> 05:12.296
who came on this earth also as Mahavira and Buddha.

05:12.497 --> 05:14.523
And they were born even earlier.

05:14.724 --> 05:17.175
Like that, they were born again and again,

05:17.376 --> 05:21.530
as these two elements, as the disciples, as two disciples.

05:21.810 --> 05:25.191
And you can see if you read their life,

05:25.392 --> 05:28.689
their character, their behavior, you’ll be surprised,

05:28.890 --> 05:32.329
how these two characters have been born again and again,

05:32.530 --> 05:36.770
in different times, to suggest two personalities

05:36.970 --> 05:40.049
of two types, who have been seeking God,

05:40.250 --> 05:43.692
and who have been trying to understand God

05:43.893 --> 05:46.251
through their personality as disciples;

05:46.453 --> 05:49.729
and how they reached a conclusion

05:49.930 --> 05:54.690
after taking a kind of a position in life.

05:54.930 --> 05:57.490
Now for example Buddha preached that

05:57.691 --> 06:00.289
there should be complete non-violence,

06:00.530 --> 06:04.756
and also Mahavira said so, there should be non-violence.

06:04.957 --> 06:07.290
But they carried it to such an extent.

06:07.491 --> 06:11.061
that Mahavira’s disciples started saving the bugs.

06:11.262 --> 06:14.373
They would get some bugs from the village,

06:14.628 --> 06:16.397
put them in a hut

06:16.598 --> 06:20.609
and put a Brahmin inside that – fanaticism at that stage -

06:20.810 --> 06:22.710
and the bugs would eat,

06:22.901 --> 06:29.129
or take, take out the blood of that poor brahmin,

06:29.330 --> 06:32.449
and when they would be all filled with blood,

06:32.650 --> 06:35.489
then they would give money to this brahmin.

06:35.690 --> 06:41.209
Such extreme vegetarianism or extreme type of ahinsa!

06:41.410 --> 06:44.128
Or another type of Buddha’s ahinsa that started

06:44.370 --> 06:46.929
that Buddha was not the one who was a vegetarian,

06:47.129 --> 06:49.650
because He died, at the end you know that,

06:49.890 --> 06:53.849
He ate the meat of a boar which was not properly cooked.

06:54.129 --> 06:58.072
So this kind of extreme type of

06:58.273 --> 07:02.128
food-oriented religion started out of them,

07:02.330 --> 07:05.748
so they got themselves born again,

07:06.033 --> 07:08.362
as Hassan and Hussein and [unclear]

07:08.386 --> 07:11.192
[missing a part] a person who is a religious person.

07:11.341 --> 07:18.008
So the idea of all these people was in such a way

07:18.209 --> 07:23.158
that the time at that period was such and such,

07:23.359 --> 07:27.460
and at that period this was the proper thing to be done.

07:27.661 --> 07:30.541
Now we can see the example of Christ is.

07:30.781 --> 07:32.413
Christ came at a time

07:32.614 --> 07:36.260
where the Son of God had to manifest.

07:36.461 --> 07:40.941
And He came at a time where He had to forgive,

07:41.141 --> 07:47.061
and He had to show to people how stupid they were, to crucify Him,

07:47.261 --> 07:52.061
so that they could repent for what stupidity they have done.

07:52.262 --> 07:54.421
And that’s how He came on this earth.

07:54.668 --> 07:57.271
But when He will come again,

07:57.528 --> 08:00.300
He’s not going to come in that way.

08:00.501 --> 08:03.075
The Second Advent of Christ,

08:03.204 --> 08:06.460
is going to be a very serious one.

08:06.661 --> 08:10.741
When He will come, He will have eleven destroying powers.

08:10.981 --> 08:14.100
With that He will destroy all that is useless,

08:14.301 --> 08:17.661
all that has gone wasted, all those fanatics

08:17.861 --> 08:20.357
or "Whom they'll call Christ, Christ, I won’t know”,

08:20.558 --> 08:22.021
He’s told that, very well.

08:22.222 --> 08:25.461
All these things He’s going to absolutely finish off.

08:25.701 --> 08:29.381
And those who are realized souls,

08:29.582 --> 08:32.900
who have entered into the Kingdom of God, will be only saved.

08:33.100 --> 08:36.661
And this is what is described in all the Scriptures.

08:36.901 --> 08:41.048
Of course somebody calls them, say Islam calls it “Mahdi”

08:41.249 --> 08:43.741
in India He is called as “Kalki”,

08:43.942 --> 08:47.421
in the Bible He is called as “the Christ on the white horse”.

08:47.622 --> 08:49.221
He is called by various names,

08:49.461 --> 08:51.941
but it is definite that He is going to come,

08:52.141 --> 08:53.586
and when He comes,

08:53.787 --> 08:58.515
then He is not going to bother as to tell you, and convince you,

08:58.716 --> 09:03.735
and to counsel you or to redeem you and give you Realization.

09:04.029 --> 09:07.100
That time, He is not going to bother about it.

09:07.341 --> 09:10.061
He is going to come in pure destructive form,

09:10.301 --> 09:12.872
where He will destroy all that is useless.

09:13.073 --> 09:17.584
And to understand this, if you see
the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo,

09:17.786 --> 09:20.741
you can see Him clearly standing, at the Agnya chakra,

09:21.021 --> 09:23.700
with a robust body, throwing people up and down.

09:23.902 --> 09:26.421
Those who call, “Christ, Christ”, He throws them down,

09:26.781 --> 09:31.388
because they did not do anything what Christ has asked for.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.999
Now the people should know

09:34.200 --> 09:37.261
what we have got out of anything whatsoever.

09:37.501 --> 09:40.981
You may be identified with any cult, with any idea,

09:41.181 --> 09:42.941
with any group, or anything,

09:43.141 --> 09:46.459
but always must know what you have you got out of it.

09:46.661 --> 09:50.820
For example, I would say for Christians it is necessary to know

09:51.100 --> 09:53.821
that Christ has said a very strong thing,

09:54.061 --> 09:57.581
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

09:58.221 --> 10:01.421
Let us find out, do we have innocent eyes?

10:01.661 --> 10:04.739
If we don’t, we are not Christians.

10:04.941 --> 10:06.941
How do we have innocent eyes?

10:07.141 --> 10:10.099
How do we develop our innocence, is the problem.

10:10.301 --> 10:14.380
And to develop our innocence we have to awaken the Kundalini.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.566
When the Kundalini is awakened, the first center

10:16.767 --> 10:19.900
of innocence is awakened.

10:20.100 --> 10:25.420
At that time all the excretion work of the body just stops,

10:25.621 --> 10:32.115
and this center of Mooladhara, informs the Kundalini,

10:32.316 --> 10:36.381
that “There is somebody who knows the job and You can rise.”

10:36.621 --> 10:38.661
Then only the Kundalini rises.

10:38.901 --> 10:42.882
This center of innocence is first awakened within us.

10:43.084 --> 10:48.420
If this center finds that the person is anti-God,

10:48.622 --> 10:50.741
he is anti-Christ,

10:51.341 --> 10:55.221
he is a man who is a devil, or any sort of a thing,

10:55.461 --> 10:57.981
it just does not allow the Kundalini to rise.

10:58.181 --> 11:01.221
I have seen people with absolute frozen Kundalini;

11:01.422 --> 11:04.861
I have seen people who have nothing to do with Kundalini,

11:05.100 --> 11:07.026
we can say they are just like devils

11:07.227 --> 11:11.060
and they have no way that they can be realized.

11:11.261 --> 11:14.646
But ninety-nine percent people in this world

11:14.781 --> 11:18.301
are excellent people, good people,

11:18.503 --> 11:20.781
and out of them I think at least

11:21.021 --> 11:23.820
thirty to forty percent people are seeking God.

11:24.061 --> 11:28.421
Not all; some are seeking money, some are seeking power

11:28.661 --> 11:31.781
and some are seeking some personal indulgences.

11:32.061 --> 11:35.701
But there are definitely true seekers on this earth,

11:35.902 --> 11:39.828
and this thirty percent people are, or forty percent people,

11:40.029 --> 11:43.420
are the most important people from the God’s point of view.

11:43.621 --> 11:47.221
You might be anything. You might be having any organization,

11:47.421 --> 11:49.900
you might be having any position in life,

11:50.100 --> 11:53.661
you might be any great personality, makes no difference to God.

11:53.861 --> 11:57.100
What is important is that are you seeking?

11:57.621 --> 12:00.981
If you’re not, the door will be opened has been promised.

12:01.181 --> 12:03.501
But if you think you have already achieved it

12:03.741 --> 12:06.540
and that you are there, how can it be worked out?

12:06.741 --> 12:11.061
So one has to be humble about it, and allow the Kundalini to rise

12:11.261 --> 12:14.949
in Its own glory, giving you your real beauty.

12:15.261 --> 12:19.820
Now the thing we have to know that

12:20.061 --> 12:25.100
as the Kundalini ascends, we also start getting powers.

12:25.301 --> 12:28.900
The first power is that of innocence.

12:29.100 --> 12:34.208
Innocence has a power above all other powers.

12:34.409 --> 12:36.420
It’s the most powerful thing,

12:36.621 --> 12:39.203
but in the human beings it takes time

12:39.404 --> 12:42.656
for innocence to be awakened in the full way.

12:42.857 --> 12:46.180
It takes time. As a child they have the innocence;

12:46.421 --> 12:49.341
and in childhood, if they get their awakening

12:49.621 --> 12:51.900
that’s the best thing that can happen to human beings

12:52.100 --> 12:55.421
that in the childhood only they become, get their Realization.

12:55.661 --> 12:57.540
But as soon as you start growing

12:57.781 --> 13:01.660
your attention starts going either to the left or to the right.

13:01.861 --> 13:04.621
You start indulging into all kinds of things

13:04.861 --> 13:06.701
as far as your sex is concerned,

13:06.941 --> 13:09.509
as far as your seeking is concerned,

13:09.710 --> 13:13.560
and you then jump on to some sort of a wrong thing

13:13.761 --> 13:15.423
which you should not have done.

13:15.624 --> 13:18.273
And that’s how the first center gets lost.

13:18.474 --> 13:22.541
An innocent person is looked after by angels.

13:22.901 --> 13:25.723
Such a person has no fear of anything.

13:25.925 --> 13:30.031
He’s not bothered, he’s never violent, he’s never hasty,

13:30.261 --> 13:33.180
he’s never in a temper, he’s so peaceful,

13:33.421 --> 13:37.621
and he knows that what he is doing is the right thing.

13:37.901 --> 13:41.099
Such a person stands by righteousness.

13:41.861 --> 13:45.420
Like you can see in the life of Christ is a very good example

13:45.661 --> 13:50.026
that when Mary Magdalene was stoned by people, He stood up,

13:50.228 --> 13:53.260
and He said, “Among you who has done no sin

13:53.461 --> 13:55.100
can throw the stone at her.”

13:55.301 --> 13:58.261
Actually Christ had nothing to do with a prostitute.

13:58.501 --> 14:02.021
He had no relationship of any kind with her.

14:02.221 --> 14:06.100
She is a prostitute and He is the Son of God.

14:06.301 --> 14:10.100
But at that time He did feel that she has a right to exist,

14:10.341 --> 14:13.181
because those who are stoning her

14:13.382 --> 14:15.861
are the people who have committed also sins.

14:16.100 --> 14:19.900
Only she is a person who’s exposed, and He stood by her.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.673
And that is what happens to a person who is innocent

14:22.874 --> 14:24.059
he is fearless.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.981
He has no fear of anything,

14:26.181 --> 14:30.501
because he knows that he stands on truth and on innocence.

14:30.861 --> 14:36.701
Such a person also has a capacity to bear up lots of nonsense,

14:37.021 --> 14:41.621
to laugh at lots of tortures and troubles people bestow upon him.

14:41.861 --> 14:44.274
And the greatest thing of innocence is,

14:44.520 --> 14:46.380
that it gives you discretion.

14:46.581 --> 14:50.075
Such a person is immensely discreet. He’s so wise.

14:50.276 --> 14:53.460
He may be a little child, he may be a grown-up person,

14:53.781 --> 14:56.580
he may be a villager, he might be educated,

14:56.782 --> 14:59.860
he might be uneducated, but he’s so wise

15:00.061 --> 15:04.107
that he sees what is right and what is righteous.

15:04.741 --> 15:07.900
And this is the greatest quality of an innocent person,

15:08.100 --> 15:10.781
that he’s very discreet about everything.

15:11.021 --> 15:15.341
His discretion is just like a straight forward hit.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.620
He doesn’t have to think, he doesn’t have to bother.

15:18.821 --> 15:22.100
Whatever he decides is absolute discreet,

15:22.301 --> 15:24.180
and he doesn’t have to have choices.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.611
He doesn’t go on choosing people, he doesn’t go on choosing things.

15:27.812 --> 15:29.740
He said, “This is the thing” – finished.

15:29.941 --> 15:32.900
So, such a person becomes absolutely dynamic

15:33.100 --> 15:36.900
because he doesn’t waste any energy, he doesn’t waste his brains,

15:37.100 --> 15:39.981
he doesn’t waste his arguments with anyone.

15:40.181 --> 15:42.741
If he thinks a person is worth arguing, he’ll argue,

15:42.981 --> 15:46.500
otherwise he’ll say, “All right, you are clever. Go ahead.”

15:46.701 --> 15:51.010
This is the understanding of a person,

15:51.211 --> 15:52.981
who is completely discreet.

15:53.181 --> 15:56.701
Like there was a very big joke about it, that

15:57.621 --> 16:01.261
there was a man who was going up the road,

16:02.141 --> 16:06.260
up the stairs, and another one was coming downstairs.

16:06.461 --> 16:10.501
The one who was going up the road was a wise man

16:10.741 --> 16:13.300
and the one who was coming down was not a wise man.

16:13.501 --> 16:16.620
So he tried to be aggressive, so, and he told him

16:16.821 --> 16:21.380
that “I will not move for you, because I don’t move for fools.”

16:21.581 --> 16:26.041
So the other one moved on one side and he said, “I do.”

16:26.621 --> 16:29.581
Meaning, “I move out for fools,”

16:29.821 --> 16:31.899
you see, but he said, “I do.” And he moved out.

16:32.100 --> 16:36.220
So he has such a discretion – how far to go and how far not to go.

16:36.421 --> 16:38.461
Now, I will give you an example how

16:38.701 --> 16:41.221
in nature you can find this very easily.

16:41.461 --> 16:44.580
See, the root has a little root cap.

16:44.781 --> 16:46.741
It’s a very, very small minute thing,

16:46.981 --> 16:48.900
you have to see through the microscope.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.826
Now this root cap is a wise thing.

16:52.100 --> 16:55.430
It goes in the soil, it sees there are some stones,

16:55.631 --> 16:57.219
so it goes around the stones.

16:57.420 --> 17:00.499
Then it finds there are boulders. It goes around the boulders.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.036
It has to find its way, so it's not bothered.

17:03.238 --> 17:04.940
“You are a boulder? All right, doesn’t matter,

17:05.148 --> 17:06.574
I am not going to fight with you.”

17:06.775 --> 17:10.170
It passes through that, it goes directly

17:10.371 --> 17:13.181
to that place where it has to arrive,

17:13.421 --> 17:16.711
and when it reaches that place, when he arrives that place,

17:16.913 --> 17:20.433
what happens, he finds that he has tied up these boulders

17:20.635 --> 17:24.141
around himself to support the whole tree.

17:24.937 --> 17:29.821
This is the wisdom of a little bit, small little cell

17:30.061 --> 17:32.941
which is the root-end.

17:33.141 --> 17:37.061
So you can imagine how much there is wisdom

17:37.261 --> 17:40.900
in a little cell like that.

17:41.100 --> 17:44.061
And God has given us such a good brain

17:44.261 --> 17:46.501
and if we do not have discretion

17:46.741 --> 17:48.900
we are like people who are blind,

17:49.100 --> 17:52.540
who walk without knowing where they have to go.

17:52.741 --> 17:58.821
So the first power of your innocence is awakened.

17:59.301 --> 18:01.661
Innocent men cannot be harmed.

18:01.901 --> 18:05.899
Those who try to harm the innocent men are harmed ultimately.

18:06.100 --> 18:10.701
They are very severely harmed, and it is amazing sometimes

18:10.941 --> 18:14.341
that the harm can be too much, too severe

18:14.581 --> 18:17.461
and that’s why the compassion of Christ thought of it,

18:17.701 --> 18:20.221
and He said, “Oh God, please forgive them,

18:20.422 --> 18:22.861
for they do not know what they are doing.”

18:23.100 --> 18:25.100
Because it could have been that

18:25.341 --> 18:27.061
with the Father who is so wrathful,

18:27.261 --> 18:29.900
they would have been all destroyed completely.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.899
So the way He said, “Forgive them,

18:33.100 --> 18:35.461
because I do not want

18:35.701 --> 18:37.901
that these people, who are ignorant people,

18:38.101 --> 18:41.541
who have tortured Me like this, should be destroyed.”

18:41.901 --> 18:45.551
This is the sign of innocence.

18:46.181 --> 18:51.140
Then the second chakra, when it is awaken within you,

18:51.341 --> 18:56.812
you have a special quality of creativity.

18:57.381 --> 18:59.900
Because when the second chakra is awaken,

19:00.100 --> 19:03.989
you are actually thoughtless, there’s no thought in your mind.

19:04.190 --> 19:08.680
So you start looking at anything, without thinking.

19:09.451 --> 19:13.861
You start looking at anything that is created

19:14.100 --> 19:17.380
without any ripple of thought in your mind.

19:17.581 --> 19:21.660
Like all that is created round the lake of your mind

19:21.861 --> 19:28.029
is completely reflected in that ripple-less lake,

19:28.230 --> 19:33.900
and you see the complete reflection of that creation,

19:34.100 --> 19:38.900
as well as the joy that is bubbling in that creation.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.900
So your creativity becomes tremendous.

19:42.100 --> 19:45.483
You start seeing things, but not thinking about it.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.900
Now, see if you come to this hall,

19:49.100 --> 19:51.500
and you start seeing something, you like it,

19:51.701 --> 19:54.421
then you start thinking, “Oh God, this is a beautiful thing,

19:54.701 --> 19:57.900
but how much it must have cost? And now how old it is?

19:58.100 --> 20:01.100
Is it going to last or not? Is it insured or not?”

20:01.301 --> 20:03.181
All sorts of funny ideas will come to you,

20:03.421 --> 20:05.365
and you’ll never enjoy what it is.

20:05.566 --> 20:07.980
But supposing you have no thought about it,

20:08.181 --> 20:09.900
you just watch it, you just see it.

20:10.101 --> 20:13.981
What happens? The creation that of the artist

20:14.181 --> 20:16.020
who has created this beautiful thing,

20:16.221 --> 20:18.740
the joy of that creation that the artist had -

20:18.981 --> 20:22.198
who might be dead now - you start enjoying that joy.

20:22.399 --> 20:27.198
The whole thing can be filled in you with that bubbling joy

20:27.399 --> 20:31.032
that he wanted to put there with his own heart.

20:31.233 --> 20:34.141
And that’s what happens because there is no thought.

20:34.381 --> 20:36.900
So the creativity becomes tremendous.

20:37.100 --> 20:40.341
But it’s not only that the creativity is tremendous,

20:40.542 --> 20:42.100
but your techniques even.

20:42.301 --> 20:45.541
For example, a musician can become a tremendous musician.

20:45.781 --> 20:50.421
People who have never done any work, can become extremely powerful.

20:50.861 --> 20:53.500
We have somebody here from India.

20:53.701 --> 20:55.299
The other day he was telling people,

20:55.501 --> 20:57.678
because he gave one of the lectures,

20:57.879 --> 21:00.327
that “I had never seen what is wood is.

21:00.528 --> 21:03.900
I did not know what was teak, what was other wood and all that.”

21:04.100 --> 21:05.900
And he had no job when he came to Me.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.591
And he said, “Now, after Realization what job should I take?”

21:08.792 --> 21:11.303
I said, “You take to interior decoration”, and he got a shock.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.100
He said, “I don’t know what [to do].

21:13.301 --> 21:14.968
How am I to take interior decoration?”

21:15.169 --> 21:17.381
I said, “You can start feeling the vibrations.

21:17.621 --> 21:20.261
You just do it on the basis on vibrations.”

21:20.501 --> 21:23.100
And he did it, and he made a big money out of it,

21:23.301 --> 21:25.221
because as I told you the other day,

21:25.461 --> 21:28.341
whatever is absolutely beautiful you think,

21:28.581 --> 21:31.181
has nothing in it but has vibrations.

21:31.421 --> 21:34.500
It has a coefficient which gives you vibrations.

21:34.701 --> 21:37.141
Like Mona Lisa now. We like her, Mona Lisa.

21:37.381 --> 21:39.740
According to modern standards she cannot be a beauty

21:39.981 --> 21:42.961
because she was a very plump lady, an elderly lady.

21:43.162 --> 21:46.661
But today also, if you go there, you cannot see her painting,

21:46.901 --> 21:49.821
it’s so crowded, everybody’s anxious to see Mona Lisa.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.900
And if you go and feel the vibrations,

21:52.100 --> 21:53.900
from distance you’ll get vibrations,

21:54.100 --> 21:57.901
because the coefficients of her body, face and everything

21:58.101 --> 22:01.100
is made so well, that you get the vibrations.

22:01.461 --> 22:05.099
Now people are very anxious to create new ideas,

22:05.301 --> 22:07.388
new type of things, and these,

22:07.589 --> 22:09.815
but these things do not sell

22:10.016 --> 22:13.541
and even if they sell temporarily, they have no eternal values.

22:13.821 --> 22:17.421
So the people with this chakra enlightened,

22:17.661 --> 22:23.036
start creating things of very eternal values,

22:23.821 --> 22:25.349
of universal values.

22:25.550 --> 22:28.564
Anywhere you take such a thing, you will take it to India,

22:28.765 --> 22:32.141
you take it to China, you take it to Japan or you take it to America

22:32.381 --> 22:36.100
anywhere, any human being who sees that,

22:36.301 --> 22:39.900
sees the beauty of the Spirit,

22:40.100 --> 22:42.861
because it gives you joy in your Spirit.

22:43.100 --> 22:46.900
So the pure art is produced [through you].

22:47.100 --> 22:48.321
That’s the purity,

22:48.522 --> 22:51.381
or I would say the holy art is produced through you.

22:51.621 --> 22:55.335
When you start producing that holy art, then you should believe

22:55.536 --> 22:59.900
that you have got an enlightenment on that chakra.

23:00.100 --> 23:02.112
This chakra has another capacity,

23:02.313 --> 23:05.993
to transform your fat, for the use of your brain.

23:06.194 --> 23:09.981
And it works very hard for that, when you start thinking too much.

23:10.181 --> 23:12.023
And by that over thinking,

23:12.224 --> 23:14.667
what happens, that you develop all the diseases

23:14.868 --> 23:17.621
of the organs which it has to look after.

23:17.861 --> 23:19.861
Like, it has to look after the liver,

23:20.100 --> 23:22.900
it has to look after the pancreas, it has to look after the spleen,

23:23.100 --> 23:27.101
it has to look after the parts of the intestine and the uterus.

23:27.541 --> 23:31.068
So what happens that when you use this chakra

23:31.269 --> 23:34.980
only for the use of thinking and thinking and thinking,

23:35.181 --> 23:37.461
all these things go out of order.

23:37.701 --> 23:41.716
And one by one you start developing diseases like diabetes,

23:41.917 --> 23:46.535
and then you start developing diseases of the stomach,

23:46.736 --> 23:50.172
and sometimes the spleen, and all other diseases

23:50.373 --> 23:52.400
which are very dangerous, that the,

23:52.551 --> 23:55.297
as you can call the blood cancer and all those things,

23:55.498 --> 23:57.860
out of this kind of mad thinking.

23:58.061 --> 24:01.141
Now to tell you that you shouldn’t think too much,

24:01.381 --> 24:04.533
you shouldn’t bother too much, you should not be wobbly,

24:04.734 --> 24:07.327
you should take things easy, be light-hearted,

24:07.528 --> 24:09.375
is not possible in the modern times

24:09.527 --> 24:11.420
because we are slaves of the watch.

24:11.621 --> 24:15.780
But what happens, that when you get Realization,

24:15.981 --> 24:18.301
your thinking process becomes regulated.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.221
You only think when you have to think.

24:20.422 --> 24:22.900
You just go on thinking, thinking, like horns coming out.

24:23.100 --> 24:26.220
You don’t think like that. You only think when you have to think.

24:26.421 --> 24:30.259
And whatever you think comes from you inspiration as such.

24:30.461 --> 24:34.221
Now for time, you see, My watch is always out of order.

24:34.461 --> 24:39.099
I deliberately keep it out of order, because the time is

24:41.501 --> 24:43.141
in your hands.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.941
Supposing these people will hurry Me up too much,

24:46.141 --> 24:49.243
“Mother we have go now, we’ll miss
the plane, this thing, that thing.”

24:49.444 --> 24:51.232
I said, “All right, if you say I’ll go.”

24:51.433 --> 24:53.129
I go to the airport

24:53.330 --> 24:55.540
and there they find the plane is three hours late.

24:55.741 --> 24:57.900
Then they said, “Mother, why didn’t you tell us?”

24:58.100 --> 25:00.221
I said, “I was telling you, no need to hurry up.

25:00.461 --> 25:01.980
Why didn’t you telephone and find out?

25:02.181 --> 25:05.341
If you had telephoned, we would not have been there earlier.”

25:05.581 --> 25:08.357
So you see, you start seeing

25:08.558 --> 25:13.030
that this time is best for this, this time is best for that.

25:13.231 --> 25:15.512
You don’t have to become a slave of the watch.

25:15.713 --> 25:18.048
Like this, people become such slaves

25:18.249 --> 25:23.100
that they arrive at a point where there can be

25:23.301 --> 25:25.341
some sort of a wrong thing happening

25:25.581 --> 25:29.100
or maybe that you reach the place
and you have to wait for four hours,

25:29.341 --> 25:33.127
you have to do all kinds of arrangements

25:33.328 --> 25:35.039
to make yourself comfortable.

25:35.240 --> 25:38.181
Or sometimes it so happens that you quarrel with your wife,

25:38.421 --> 25:40.572
quarrel with your husband, quarrel with your children,

25:40.773 --> 25:42.514
“Oh, we are getting late, we are getting late

25:42.715 --> 25:43.831
we have to be on the time.”

25:44.032 --> 25:45.899
All this madness comes to people

25:46.100 --> 25:48.501
because they have not got their Realization.

25:48.741 --> 25:51.421
Once you get Realization, you station down.

25:51.661 --> 25:54.461
You are very much at ease with yourself.

25:54.701 --> 25:57.820
You don’t hurry others and you don’t trouble others.

25:58.061 --> 26:01.340
Like small, small things, how much we trouble by our worries.

26:01.541 --> 26:05.101
You see, human beings will go on saying, “I’m worried.”

26:05.341 --> 26:08.021
But what’s the use of worrying? Now if I tell you, “Don’t worry”

26:08.221 --> 26:09.405
you cannot stop it.

26:09.607 --> 26:11.621
But once the hole is made here,

26:11.861 --> 26:13.821
which we call the Brahmarandhra is opened,

26:14.061 --> 26:16.381
then there’s a hole out of which the worry comes out,

26:16.621 --> 26:18.621
and then you just cannot worry.

26:18.861 --> 26:20.861
Even if you want to worry, you won’t worry;

26:21.100 --> 26:25.901
because somehow or other you go beyond that nonsense of worrying.

26:26.621 --> 26:30.541
In any way, mentally I cannot convince you that you don’t worry.

26:30.781 --> 26:33.021
But once you get Realization, you’ll be amazed,

26:33.221 --> 26:35.221
you’ll be just enjoying yourself.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.941
Even if you are late, you are not going to bother about

26:38.141 --> 26:40.141
or trouble others and you will find

26:40.381 --> 26:42.301
that you’ll be are always in time for things,

26:42.541 --> 26:44.261
because there is a force,

26:44.501 --> 26:47.781
this All Pervading Power of God looks after you.

26:48.021 --> 26:50.381
You start believing in it, how it works out.

26:50.621 --> 26:53.221
You won’t believe how much it helps,

26:53.461 --> 26:57.701
how much it works out, how it can operate

26:57.941 --> 27:00.100
just beyond description.

27:00.301 --> 27:02.747
I mean, I’ll tell you a story which you won’t believe.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.736
Did I tell them yesterday about the boy who fainted?

27:05.911 --> 27:07.660
SY: I don't think so, Mother.
SM: No.

27:07.861 --> 27:09.900
SM: A story about Myself,

27:10.100 --> 27:12.900
and then a story about Warren I can tell you.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.821
It’s in the newspaper, so you can believe it.

27:16.061 --> 27:18.301
I was giving a lecture in Bedford

27:18.541 --> 27:21.581
and that was from seven to ten

27:21.821 --> 27:24.341
and about eight o’clock a boy fell down somewhere,

27:24.661 --> 27:27.900
about I don’t know ten-fifteen miles from a bridge.

27:28.100 --> 27:31.381
Very deep down he fell down from his motorbike.

27:31.621 --> 27:33.751
And they sent for an ambulance.

27:33.952 --> 27:36.271
They got frightened; they thought this boy must be dead,

27:36.472 --> 27:38.500
to fall down to this extent.

27:38.701 --> 27:41.901
So the ambulance came in and when the ambulance came in,

27:42.101 --> 27:44.261
this boy just walked up, and he came up

27:44.501 --> 27:46.021
and he sat in the ambulance.

27:46.221 --> 27:47.900
So they said, “How are you?”

27:48.100 --> 27:49.900
He said “I’m all right, nothing wrong with me.”

27:50.100 --> 27:51.702
So they said, “But nothing happened to you.”

27:51.903 --> 27:53.581
He said, “No, I broke lots of things

27:53.821 --> 27:56.187
but a Lady came in a white clothes,

27:56.388 --> 27:58.753
in a white Mercedes (that’s My car),

27:58.954 --> 28:02.100
and She walked down up to me and She cured me.

28:02.301 --> 28:07.141
And only She left the lower portion of my bone,

28:07.381 --> 28:09.581
and She said that, You come for this to Me,

28:09.782 --> 28:11.781
and the rest is I’m perfectly all right, see."

28:12.100 --> 28:13.821
They couldn’t believe it, you see.

28:14.061 --> 28:16.421
And the police was there, and everybody was there.

28:16.661 --> 28:20.548
And the next day he saw My photograph in the newspaper,

28:20.749 --> 28:22.621
and he informed them, he informed the police,

28:22.822 --> 28:24.545
“This is the Lady Who came and cured me.”

28:24.746 --> 28:26.621
So they telephoned our people, and ask them,

28:26.861 --> 28:27.941
“Did She pass this way that day?”

28:28.141 --> 28:30.341
They said, “That time She was just giving lecture

28:30.581 --> 28:32.740
before six hundred people. She was not there.”

28:32.941 --> 28:35.900
So they were quite amazed, how it has happened. But it can happen.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.341
It’s nothing new. I mean it has happened many a times.

28:38.661 --> 28:41.301
But one of these that has appeared in the newspaper is like that.

28:41.541 --> 28:43.100
Now, how does this happen?

28:43.301 --> 28:46.741
God has got wonderful television also, perfect,

28:46.981 --> 28:49.181
it’s so systematic, it’s so scientific.

28:49.421 --> 28:54.020
How it works, that for that you have to just see and wonder.

28:54.221 --> 28:57.820
He has got telecommunication, He has got computers,

28:58.100 --> 29:00.221
He has got everything that you have created,

29:00.461 --> 29:04.094
but extremely efficient and methodical.

29:04.295 --> 29:06.980
You don’t have to worry, it just works out.

29:07.181 --> 29:09.540
There are so many things that have happened,

29:09.781 --> 29:12.821
like you have heard that Christ gave bread,

29:13.061 --> 29:15.900
five bread and fish to so many people.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.341
It’s nothing new to now Sahaja Yogis.

29:18.581 --> 29:20.100
They have seen this many a times happening,

29:20.301 --> 29:21.941
in our groups and in our camps.

29:22.141 --> 29:24.980
But another thing which is not believable

29:25.181 --> 29:27.221
but it has happened to one Mr. Warren,

29:27.461 --> 29:29.099
Dr. Warren, who is here from Australia.

29:29.341 --> 29:32.900
When he came to India and he got his Realization,

29:33.100 --> 29:34.367
and when he went back he said,

29:34.526 --> 29:37.476
“I must now start talking about Sahaja Yoga

29:37.677 --> 29:39.261
and giving Realization to people.”

29:39.501 --> 29:44.461
And when he went back to Australia there was a petrol crisis.

29:44.701 --> 29:47.540
And there was no petrol in his car, about to finish,

29:47.781 --> 29:49.434
so they thought, “Now, what to do?

29:49.635 --> 29:52.181
We’ll not have any petrol. How to do Mother’s work?”

29:52.421 --> 29:53.750
So they said, “Lets try.

29:53.952 --> 29:57.621
We’ll just go wherever we want, we’ll not look at the petrol.”

29:57.861 --> 30:01.581
And they did this for twenty-one days, continuously,

30:01.821 --> 30:04.723
and when they went to the petrol pump after twenty-one days,

30:04.924 --> 30:07.740
because the petrol pumps had opened out,

30:07.941 --> 30:09.980
the petrol pump fellow said that,

30:10.182 --> 30:14.900
“There is hardly one liter space there. What am I to fill in?”

30:15.100 --> 30:18.381
And they were amazed, they did it twenty-one days. It can happen.

30:18.741 --> 30:21.899
You do not know when you say God is Almighty,

30:22.100 --> 30:24.901
when we say that He can do whatever He wants to do.

30:25.101 --> 30:26.261
He does everything.

30:26.501 --> 30:29.981
When we say that we are not aware that what He can do.

30:30.253 --> 30:34.179
We just think that at the most He can make flowers into fruits,

30:34.380 --> 30:36.900
at the most He can make our heart beat,

30:37.139 --> 30:40.980
at the most He can make us from amoeba to human being.

30:41.261 --> 30:42.900
But just think of it,

30:43.100 --> 30:45.420
how far He can go,

30:45.621 --> 30:47.661
and how capable He is

30:47.901 --> 30:53.410
and how full of compassion He is for His own creation.

30:53.861 --> 30:56.501
Now you have to enter into that area.

30:56.741 --> 30:58.861
First of all, unless and until you are there,

30:59.100 --> 31:00.781
you are really blessed by God,

31:01.021 --> 31:04.170
you cannot believe it how it helps.

31:04.901 --> 31:10.100
Thirdly, the third center, is the center of your seeking,

31:10.341 --> 31:13.661
as he has told you, is the center of your seeking.

31:13.901 --> 31:16.781
Now the seeking gets satisfied

31:17.221 --> 31:22.181
in the sense that you feel you are no more to seek,

31:22.421 --> 31:24.101
now you have to give.

31:24.341 --> 31:26.701
You are asking for the light,

31:26.941 --> 31:29.900
you have got the light, and you have to give the light.

31:30.100 --> 31:33.393
But you do not develop the fanatic attitude

31:33.594 --> 31:37.135
that, “I am the right person, and you are the wrong person”

31:37.337 --> 31:40.123
and that kind of a violent nature,

31:40.324 --> 31:43.861
but you develop a very gentle and a kindly

31:44.100 --> 31:46.301
and affectionate nature towards that person.

31:46.541 --> 31:49.141
Because you have gone through that kind of an experience,

31:49.381 --> 31:51.661
so you know that this person is ignorant.

31:51.901 --> 31:54.701
Gradually when he will see the light, he will understand.

31:54.981 --> 31:57.781
So you don’t force your way onto him, at all.

31:58.021 --> 32:01.978
On the contrary you allow that person to slowly

32:02.179 --> 32:06.740
take to it, and awaken his Kundalini and see for himself

32:06.981 --> 32:08.781
so that he should certify himself.

32:09.021 --> 32:11.141
You don’t force him to say things,

32:11.381 --> 32:12.977
you do not organize him,

32:13.178 --> 32:16.588
you do not make him a member,

32:16.789 --> 32:18.899
you do not take money from him, nothing.

32:19.100 --> 32:22.141
You leave him alone. If he wants to come, he can come.

32:22.381 --> 32:25.024
If he does not want to come, he need not come.

32:25.225 --> 32:28.221
In Sahaja Yoga, we have made it compulsory

32:28.461 --> 32:30.060
that all the centers we are running,

32:30.261 --> 32:33.421
no young boys should come who are below age

32:33.661 --> 32:35.181
without the permission of their parents,

32:35.421 --> 32:37.581
even to visit, leave alone living there.

32:37.821 --> 32:42.141
So that, that’s how we allow only those people

32:42.381 --> 32:46.700
who are grown up, adults, to come with their own wishes.

32:46.901 --> 32:48.233
They are not to be forced.

32:48.434 --> 32:51.904
If they want to go today, we’ll say, “All right, go just now.”

32:52.802 --> 32:55.741
There is no compulsion on anyone,

32:55.981 --> 32:58.981
because one thing you must know, that you cannot compel

32:59.181 --> 33:01.900
as far as your Self Realization is concerned.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.981
Because it is of no use.

33:04.181 --> 33:06.941
It has to come through your freedom,

33:07.141 --> 33:10.260
through your asking, otherwise we cannot work it out.

33:10.501 --> 33:14.221
Unless and until you ask for it, we cannot do it,

33:14.461 --> 33:15.701
it is an impossibility.

33:15.941 --> 33:18.067
So you must understand that

33:18.258 --> 33:21.093
I cannot force you to get Realization.

33:21.294 --> 33:22.581
It has to work out.

33:22.821 --> 33:26.635
If it works out, you are a lucky person. I cannot guarantee it.

33:26.836 --> 33:29.780
If it works out that means it is your own,

33:30.021 --> 33:33.381
and if it has not worked out and if you want to work Me out

33:33.621 --> 33:36.021
or anybody to work it out, they’ll work it out.

33:36.221 --> 33:39.900
But it cannot be guaranteed, it cannot be promised.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.301
So your seeking stops and what happens

33:43.541 --> 33:46.970
that you start looking at yourself

33:47.171 --> 33:49.624
and seeing your own glory,

33:49.815 --> 33:52.820
and understanding your own powers,

33:53.021 --> 33:55.061
get yourself cleaned out,

33:55.260 --> 34:00.114
and you want to give others that solace that you have got,

34:00.315 --> 34:02.661
that Realization that you have got.

34:03.021 --> 34:06.221
So, I always say that I’m the greatest capitalist,

34:06.461 --> 34:09.796
because if I have all the powers I’m the greatest capitalist,

34:09.997 --> 34:11.900
and I’m the greatest communist

34:12.099 --> 34:14.701
because I cannot live without distributing you.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.821
I must distribute. When we talk of capitalism,

34:18.021 --> 34:20.099
what do you have? These stones? What do you have?

34:20.340 --> 34:21.980
What do you distribute? The stones?

34:22.181 --> 34:23.941
And what are you a communist? What are you distributing?

34:24.141 --> 34:25.340
Only stones.

34:25.581 --> 34:29.099
So there is nothing to be proud of these worldly possessions.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.980
What you are to be proud of,

34:31.181 --> 34:33.260
or to be conscious of, is your Spirit.

34:33.501 --> 34:38.421
Spirit is the only thing that can kindle another Spirit.

34:38.661 --> 34:42.900
I have not seen any matter can kindle that joy in anyone.

34:43.100 --> 34:46.388
At the most if you give some matter to somebody, at the most,

34:46.589 --> 34:49.915
that is the only advantage of having some material thing is

34:50.116 --> 34:51.659
that you can give away,

34:51.861 --> 34:55.181
that you can express your love through some material things.

34:55.421 --> 34:58.421
But otherwise the matter has no value of any kind.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.301
But Spirit has absolute value,

35:01.541 --> 35:04.541
because it can kindle light into another’s life,

35:04.781 --> 35:08.061
and there cannot be anything better than to be given to anyone else.

35:08.341 --> 35:12.301
No amount of money, no amount of empires,

35:12.541 --> 35:15.181
nothing can give that which is the Spirit,

35:15.421 --> 35:17.461
because the Spirit is the ultimate.

35:17.701 --> 35:20.108
After that you don’t seek anything.

35:21.061 --> 35:23.821
That’s what is the Kundalini, is the true desire

35:24.061 --> 35:26.901
which wants to become the reality,

35:27.101 --> 35:29.900
which wants to become the divinity.

35:30.100 --> 35:33.261
To get divinity within you is the highest thing,

35:33.501 --> 35:35.261
and that’s what once you get,

35:35.501 --> 35:37.861
you don’t want anything else.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.741
So the seeking starts improving.

35:40.981 --> 35:43.780
Around the seeking are the Ten Commandments, you can say,

35:43.981 --> 35:46.283
or the ten primordial masters.

35:46.484 --> 35:49.701
There are many others, but the primordial masters, the ten,

35:49.941 --> 35:51.900
who came on this earth, one after another,

35:52.100 --> 35:54.085
to teach us how to balance ourselves.

35:54.286 --> 35:57.380
After Realization I’ve seen people automatically balance.

35:57.621 --> 36:00.141
I don’t tell them anything about Ten Commandments.

36:00.381 --> 36:02.501
I don’t say “Don’t”, I never say.

36:02.741 --> 36:04.487
I said, “You get your Realization.”

36:04.689 --> 36:07.899
Once they get Realization they just start

36:08.100 --> 36:11.900
behaving in such a manner that is extremely righteous,

36:12.100 --> 36:15.860
extremely balanced, extremely holy.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.500
Such a person becomes immediately

36:18.741 --> 36:23.261
rid of all the horrible habits they have,

36:23.541 --> 36:28.688
all the enslavement of passion, and lust and greed.

36:28.889 --> 36:30.620
Everything drops out just like that,

36:30.821 --> 36:36.232
and like a beautiful lotus they come out of that mire,

36:39.579 --> 36:41.900
that darkness, into light.

36:42.100 --> 36:46.139
And then in the light they see it so clearly,

36:46.341 --> 36:49.460
that this is not the thing that I can have,

36:49.701 --> 36:51.900
this is not the thing that I can wear,

36:52.100 --> 36:53.821
and immediately they give it up.

36:54.061 --> 36:56.661
That’s how you become a new personality.

36:56.901 --> 36:58.927
This religion is born within you.

36:59.128 --> 37:02.471
Now we talk of religion, this religion that religion, that religion.

37:02.672 --> 37:04.420
Everybody is talking of different religions

37:04.661 --> 37:06.021
and dogmas, and this and that,

37:06.222 --> 37:08.221
and only fighting everywhere you go.

37:08.461 --> 37:10.821
They are fighting among each other, it’s still going on.

37:11.100 --> 37:14.540
It’s endless; they are all fighting morning till evening.

37:14.781 --> 37:17.541
Then I have seen also some people who try to unite religions

37:17.781 --> 37:21.020
and there also they have nothing but all the devils put together,

37:21.221 --> 37:22.900
all devils joined together to unite.

37:23.100 --> 37:25.341
There is nothing of reality in them.

37:25.581 --> 37:29.100
So the people are puzzled, “What is happening to religion?”

37:29.301 --> 37:32.621
These organized religions also can be very dangerous.

37:32.901 --> 37:35.701
They can put you into such norms that you can really

37:35.941 --> 37:38.621
get absolutely brain-washed,

37:38.861 --> 37:41.421
and you start believing that what you are doing is correct,

37:41.661 --> 37:44.221
without understanding why are you doing it.

37:44.461 --> 37:47.661
Most of the things tell, “This is a mystery, that is a mystery.”

37:47.901 --> 37:49.461
Then why, what are you doing there?

37:49.701 --> 37:51.498
If it is a mystery, it is better you give up.

37:51.699 --> 37:54.392
But they’ll just brand you that “This is mystery, that is mystery”.

37:54.593 --> 37:55.780
You have to accept.

37:55.981 --> 37:58.021
But what is the advantage of that kind of a life,

37:58.221 --> 37:59.420
nobody wants to see.

37:59.661 --> 38:02.860
As I told you, that Christ has asked for one thing,

38:03.100 --> 38:05.701
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

38:05.941 --> 38:10.830
and let us see which religious organization

38:11.031 --> 38:12.621
has granted that to people.

38:12.861 --> 38:16.076
It’s only your Spirit, when It is awakened and reborn,

38:16.277 --> 38:18.340
you can have that innocence within you.

38:18.541 --> 38:21.741
As it is today, it’s getting late,

38:21.981 --> 38:24.261
but I have to tell you that the chakras

38:24.501 --> 38:27.821
as he explained, I am just giving you the powers of every chakra.

38:28.141 --> 38:34.847
And the power of the chakra of heart is tremendous.

38:35.701 --> 38:39.600
It gives you the fearlessness.

38:40.289 --> 38:42.941
When the child is about twelve years of age,

38:43.141 --> 38:47.899
in this sternum bone, the antibodies are created by this chakra.

38:48.100 --> 38:50.235
And they are sent all over the body

38:50.436 --> 38:54.899
to fight the disease or any kind of an attack on the personality.

38:55.169 --> 38:59.981
Now, these are actually looked after by the deity in that center,

39:00.301 --> 39:04.741
and this deity, when gets the message,

39:05.100 --> 39:10.900
She informs all the antibodies that “You have to fight.”

39:11.100 --> 39:14.750
And all of them will go at that point, join together,

39:14.952 --> 39:19.100
to fight the enemy of life, enemy of God.

39:19.722 --> 39:23.540
Like now we are having, now I’m here,

39:23.741 --> 39:27.100
and Americans are to be realized,

39:27.341 --> 39:29.860
and we have to do something about America.

39:30.100 --> 39:33.420
Then knowing that how America is important -

39:33.661 --> 39:36.899
I’ll tell you where America is in this body -

39:37.100 --> 39:40.701
people from Australia, from India,

39:41.100 --> 39:44.460
from France, from all over,

39:45.100 --> 39:47.100
have come down here.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.101
All the way they have come,

39:50.461 --> 39:53.140
just to give Realization to Americans.

39:53.341 --> 39:57.020
All of them. I never forced anybody, I never asked anybody,

39:57.221 --> 39:59.981
they just came forward, “Mother, we are going to go with You,

40:00.181 --> 40:03.855
and we are going to do this great work of Realization

40:04.056 --> 40:07.460
to people of America who are seekers.”

40:07.661 --> 40:10.941
They all have come on their own, spending their own money,

40:11.141 --> 40:13.206
and they are doing this work with Me.

40:13.407 --> 40:19.905
So you can image what a great attraction it must be,

40:20.106 --> 40:24.301
what a great attachment it must be, for the seekers of America,

40:24.541 --> 40:27.861
that they have come all the way. They are all people on big jobs

40:28.062 --> 40:31.029
one is a doctor, another is an architect, another is this,

40:31.230 --> 40:34.900
all of them sacrificing their money, everything, time

40:35.100 --> 40:38.819
have come down here to be with Me for these two months

40:39.021 --> 40:41.231
to work for America, from all over.

40:41.432 --> 40:43.948
We have some people who are actresses

40:44.149 --> 40:50.230
in the English drama

40:50.432 --> 40:53.461
or some are directors and things like that.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.181
They all have come here.

40:55.421 --> 40:57.061
In your Boston we have at least,

40:57.261 --> 40:59.900
I think, ten people from ten countries.

41:00.100 --> 41:05.889
So you can imagine how is the whole attention, the priority.

41:06.091 --> 41:09.261
This is the important thing. They must get Realization.

41:09.552 --> 41:11.621
They do not get any money out of it;

41:11.861 --> 41:13.900
they do not get any reward out of it,

41:14.100 --> 41:18.020
only the satisfaction that so many have got Realization.

41:18.335 --> 41:21.461
The more, the merrier. When they see more people coming

41:21.701 --> 41:24.899
getting Realization, you must see their faces, they lit up.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.341
This kind of a personality people have not seen.

41:28.701 --> 41:30.500
I had one bishop

41:30.701 --> 41:33.659
who came to stay with Me in My house in London,

41:33.861 --> 41:36.061
and when he saw Sahaja Yogis, he said,

41:36.261 --> 41:39.100
“This is a rare caste and community. I have never seen such a...

41:39.461 --> 41:42.341
So I’ve been telling people to do little things

41:42.581 --> 41:44.981
in life, they cannot do it and look at these people,

41:45.621 --> 41:49.261
how beautiful they are. I can’t believe how can they be so nice.”

41:49.501 --> 41:51.661
Because your Spirit is beautiful,

41:51.901 --> 41:53.701
the Spirit is glorious,

41:53.941 --> 41:55.741
and when you become that,

41:55.981 --> 41:59.021
automatically it starts manifesting its beauty.

41:59.221 --> 42:02.100
You don’t have to tell yourself, you’ll be amazed at yourself

42:02.341 --> 42:04.460
how you have become so beautiful,

42:04.701 --> 42:07.021
and so good and so nice.

42:07.221 --> 42:10.661
So this quality of fearlessness comes to you

42:10.901 --> 42:12.900
because your antibodies

42:13.100 --> 42:17.460
are completely charged with the power of the Spirit.

42:17.821 --> 42:21.181
And you start understanding what sort of a disease is coming,

42:21.461 --> 42:23.661
what sort of an attack is coming,

42:23.893 --> 42:26.024
and your body knows how to fight it.

42:26.225 --> 42:29.341
You know how to fight it, and when you know that,

42:29.542 --> 42:31.732
you are not afraid of any disease whatsoever,

42:31.933 --> 42:33.380
even it is cancer, anything,

42:33.621 --> 42:37.260
people know how to fight it themselves and for others.

42:37.461 --> 42:41.540
Now the higher chakra is of Vishuddhi chakra

42:41.741 --> 42:45.021
and this chakra is what America is.

42:45.221 --> 42:48.460
In the Universe this is the chakra,

42:48.701 --> 42:53.039
Vishuddhi chakra, is what America represents.

42:53.240 --> 42:55.621
Because America has a responsibility,

42:55.861 --> 42:57.765
this center has the responsibility.

42:58.006 --> 43:00.408
When they raise the head,

43:02.278 --> 43:05.021
human beings, then this center developed

43:05.221 --> 43:08.129
the responsibility to be human beings.

43:09.221 --> 43:11.900
And the responsibility of spirituality

43:12.100 --> 43:14.924
lies on the shoulders of Americans.

43:15.581 --> 43:20.071
You had great people like Abraham Lincoln,

43:20.272 --> 43:24.500
very great people here professing about

43:25.781 --> 43:29.301
freedom of your country and big ideal things.

43:29.664 --> 43:33.341
But to My dismay I find: where are those gone?

43:33.581 --> 43:35.211
Where are those people

43:35.412 --> 43:38.141
who will take the responsibility of spirituality?

43:38.381 --> 43:42.421
They are lost with fake gurus, they are lost with cults,

43:42.661 --> 43:46.780
they are lost with all kinds of things and where are they?

43:46.981 --> 43:50.100
It’s such a sad thing that the responsibility

43:50.301 --> 43:52.380
which was on the shoulders of Americans

43:52.621 --> 43:55.581
has been not properly tackled, at all.

43:55.782 --> 43:59.021
But now the time is – though we start slowly,

43:59.221 --> 44:02.341
let us take up the responsibility and see for ourselves,

44:02.581 --> 44:05.900
what we can do for our countrymen, for our people,

44:06.100 --> 44:08.500
and on the hole for the whole world.

44:08.741 --> 44:11.940
You can do a lot, because that is your specialty

44:12.141 --> 44:15.333
that is your job, which has to be done.

44:16.100 --> 44:20.141
Now this chakra gives you the power to be the witness.

44:20.381 --> 44:23.181
First power you get that you become the witness

44:23.421 --> 44:26.581
– witness of everything. The whole thing becomes like a drama,

44:26.821 --> 44:30.420
like you are in the water, and then you suddenly come in a boat

44:30.661 --> 44:34.501
and you start seeing the play of all these waves.

44:34.741 --> 44:37.487
You are no more afraid, you just start seeing it as a drama;

44:37.689 --> 44:39.074
you become a witness.

44:39.275 --> 44:41.549
The second thing that happens to you with this,

44:41.750 --> 44:44.061
that you become collectively conscious.

44:44.261 --> 44:48.460
Your hands, if this chakra is good, start feeling the cool breeze,

44:48.661 --> 44:52.820
start feeling the chakras of yourself and chakras of other people.

44:53.021 --> 44:55.340
With your hands you can cure people,

44:55.541 --> 44:57.661
with your hands you can raise the Kundalini,

44:57.862 --> 44:59.581
with your hands you can give Realization.

44:59.821 --> 45:02.743
These hands become powerful things.

45:03.261 --> 45:06.261
Even the movement of these hands has a meaning;

45:06.493 --> 45:08.268
everything has a meaning.

45:08.469 --> 45:12.100
Whatever it does, little fingers, they all have a meaning

45:12.301 --> 45:14.420
and because they get enlightened.

45:14.661 --> 45:16.781
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

45:16.982 --> 45:20.389
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

45:21.397 --> 45:24.540
Now if you talk to any Muslims,

45:24.781 --> 45:28.139
they will say, “We have never heard of Resurrection day.”

45:28.340 --> 45:30.326
Find in the Koran, if you see,

45:30.527 --> 45:33.029
most of it is dealt with the resurrection day,

45:33.230 --> 45:36.290
and the doomsday is very little.

45:36.914 --> 45:39.100
But people will talk about the doomsday

45:39.301 --> 45:41.621
because they can frighten others with that

45:41.861 --> 45:45.181
and have their own cults and own things.

45:45.421 --> 45:48.781
But actually the resurrection day is the most important thing.

45:49.021 --> 45:53.246
And for which Mohammed Sahib has clearly said the future.

45:53.447 --> 45:56.421
He didn’t say that, “I’m the last, now nothing is going to happen.”

45:56.661 --> 46:01.061
He said, “At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak.”

46:01.261 --> 46:03.061
And that’s exactly what happens,

46:03.261 --> 46:06.460
that you start feeling others on your fingertips.

46:06.741 --> 46:08.505
You know through your fingertips

46:08.707 --> 46:12.421
what centers are catching in another person or in yourself also,

46:12.661 --> 46:16.301
and immediately you start improving it, if you know how to do it.

46:16.541 --> 46:19.581
And that’s what you have to learn: is the divine technique,

46:19.782 --> 46:25.377
the true knowledge, of how to handle this power of Divine Love,

46:25.578 --> 46:27.677
that is flowing through you.

46:28.168 --> 46:31.900
So this center is very important, I think, for Americans.

46:32.100 --> 46:35.940
It has one side by which people are aggressive.

46:36.141 --> 46:41.155
When they talk they’re bumptious, they are ego oriented,

46:41.356 --> 46:43.701
they try to suppress others by their speeches

46:43.941 --> 46:46.420
and try to dominate others when they talk

46:46.621 --> 46:48.354
– these are the right sided people.

46:48.555 --> 46:51.981
The other side are the left sided people when they feel guilty,

46:52.181 --> 46:54.661
they think they have done this wrong, and that wrong,

46:54.901 --> 46:56.421
they should not have done this wrong.

46:56.661 --> 46:58.461
Actually I’ve seen that in America

46:58.701 --> 47:01.741
most of the people have problems here, most surprising,

47:01.981 --> 47:04.692
They are all the time shaking their neck like this, all the time.

47:04.893 --> 47:08.061
In My program also I’ve seen, they have always a problem here.

47:08.261 --> 47:11.581
The thing is that they have a greater responsibility

47:11.821 --> 47:13.484
to keep this center the best,

47:13.679 --> 47:16.449
by keeping the responsibility of spirituality

47:16.650 --> 47:19.900
quite the highest priority.

47:20.100 --> 47:22.301
They should have the highest priority.

47:22.541 --> 47:24.906
But what you find that all the people are coming

47:25.107 --> 47:27.300
from all over the world to help the Americans.

47:27.501 --> 47:30.866
A day should come when the Americans should go all over the world

47:31.067 --> 47:32.261
to give Realization.

47:32.501 --> 47:34.646
And I’m sure that day will come one day

47:34.821 --> 47:37.485
when you will grow up to that sense of responsibility

47:37.686 --> 47:40.304
when this center will really stand up,

47:40.505 --> 47:42.903
as a spiritual personality.

47:43.261 --> 47:47.442
Now, the higher center is of Agnya chakra which

47:47.644 --> 47:52.202
he has told you about, is the center when you get Realization,

47:52.403 --> 47:54.540
and when the Kundalini rises above that,

47:54.741 --> 47:57.598
you become thoughtlessly aware.

47:58.054 --> 48:02.980
Now at this time you get the power first of all of curing people.

48:03.253 --> 48:05.021
If you touch somebody, he’s cured.

48:05.221 --> 48:07.021
If you say something, that happens.

48:07.221 --> 48:10.420
If you go in the house, something good comes in that house.

48:10.661 --> 48:12.858
Auspiciousness starts working through you,

48:12.978 --> 48:14.412
when this center is opened.

48:14.613 --> 48:16.381
But one should not leave at that center,

48:16.621 --> 48:19.604
because if you start moving onto the left, or to the right,

48:19.805 --> 48:21.620
you'll get into problems.

48:21.821 --> 48:24.621
If that center starts moving onto the right,

48:24.822 --> 48:27.861
then you start seeing visions, which is a very wrong thing.

48:28.100 --> 48:30.179
You go into the realm of supra-conscious

48:30.381 --> 48:32.221
or into the collective supra-conscious,

48:32.461 --> 48:34.861
by you can become a very ego oriented person.

48:35.100 --> 48:38.899
You can be a very violent, hot tempered, quarrelsome person.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.221
Actually, Hitler used this.

48:41.461 --> 48:44.941
Hitler used this method from the lamas he learnt,

48:45.141 --> 48:48.900
and he put people onto the right side of the supraconscious,

48:49.100 --> 48:52.779
into collective supraconscious and put the spirits, dead spirits,

48:52.980 --> 48:58.261
who were of the people who were extremely ambitious and cruel.

48:58.581 --> 49:00.900
That’s how this cruelty came into the Germans

49:01.062 --> 49:02.985
and they forgot what they were.

49:03.187 --> 49:04.661
They forgot they were human beings,

49:04.901 --> 49:06.900
the way they killed, the way they behaved,

49:07.100 --> 49:09.581
it’s impossible for any human being to do that.

49:09.782 --> 49:11.880
But he managed this, and is written down

49:12.081 --> 49:16.221
that he got all this from lamas from Tibet.

49:16.461 --> 49:18.900
From there he got the knowledge how to put people

49:19.100 --> 49:21.540
onto the collective supraconscious.

49:21.741 --> 49:24.021
Now the people who can go to the left side,

49:24.221 --> 49:27.541
also start curing people, they start...

49:28.877 --> 49:31.581
In such a company you might just get stunned.

49:31.821 --> 49:34.261
If you face such a person you might just get stunned.

49:34.501 --> 49:41.020
Or you might get a kind of a complete attraction for such a person

49:41.221 --> 49:44.380
You might get completely under the domination of such a person.

49:44.621 --> 49:47.061
You might surrender completely to such a person,

49:47.261 --> 49:48.975
and you will not know what you are doing,

49:49.176 --> 49:51.475
till that person has completely destroyed you.

49:51.676 --> 49:54.500
This type of people have these horrible powers

49:54.701 --> 49:57.141
because they enter into the collective subconscious.

49:57.381 --> 49:59.683
And when they enter into the collective subconscious,

49:59.884 --> 50:04.021
they gather those spirits, which they use.

50:04.865 --> 50:08.900
But the people, who as it is, move to the left side,

50:09.100 --> 50:14.261
who cry, weep, emotional, feel guilty all the time

50:14.501 --> 50:17.621
miserable people, they jump onto the left side.

50:17.861 --> 50:20.713
Now all the diseases, practically most of them,

50:20.914 --> 50:24.668
like AIDS, like cancer, like myelitis.

50:24.869 --> 50:27.661
All these diseases come from the left sided entry

50:27.901 --> 50:29.941
and is accepted by the doctors;

50:30.141 --> 50:32.781
because I’ve seen a very good film made by the doctors,

50:32.982 --> 50:34.500
who were researching on cancer,

50:34.741 --> 50:37.581
that when the body is vulnerable to these diseases,

50:37.821 --> 50:41.741
means when you are over-exerting yourself,

50:41.981 --> 50:45.341
when there is too much of sympathetic activity in a person,

50:45.581 --> 50:48.821
and when a person is absolutely fagged out with it,

50:49.061 --> 50:51.162
at that time, they say,

50:51.363 --> 50:53.715
that these diseases are triggered into you,

50:53.858 --> 50:55.380
that somebody triggers it.

50:55.581 --> 51:00.191
And what is this they call, is the protein 52, and protein 58,

51:00.392 --> 51:02.643
and all these names they give because doctors don’t know

51:02.844 --> 51:04.112
that they are dead spirits.

51:04.314 --> 51:06.888
And these are the things when they enter into you

51:07.089 --> 51:08.237
then they trigger it.

51:08.439 --> 51:10.235
But they say something very right,

51:10.355 --> 51:12.399
and that is that these things come

51:12.600 --> 51:15.572
from the area built in you since your creation,

51:15.773 --> 51:18.392
means your collective subconscious.

51:18.775 --> 51:20.821
And that I have been saying for so many years.

51:21.061 --> 51:22.660
Now recently I saw this film.

51:22.861 --> 51:26.661
So they are coming to the same point, but after such a long time,

51:26.901 --> 51:28.581
that it is triggered by them.

51:28.821 --> 51:32.540
So those people who go too much to the left get this trouble.

51:33.061 --> 51:38.460
Those who go too much to the right get heart trouble, heart attacks;

51:38.661 --> 51:42.620
but not the slow attack, because heart has double type of attacks,

51:42.821 --> 51:46.060
it can a be slow heart or it can be a fast heart.

51:46.330 --> 51:49.061
The people who go on the right side have everything fast,

51:49.261 --> 51:51.821
liver is moving fast, everything moving fast,

51:52.022 --> 51:55.069
it’s such a speedy temperament because they are so speedy.

51:55.271 --> 51:57.873
In the morning they’ll get up, “Now I have to go to the office”

51:58.016 --> 52:00.332
and they’ll be taking the breakfast in one hand,

52:00.533 --> 52:02.951
putting one foot in the trousers,

52:03.153 --> 52:06.381
and another hand into the coat, running to the car,

52:06.621 --> 52:09.301
and there's a big another jam coming up

52:09.581 --> 52:12.899
and then swearing at everything and it’s a mess throughout.

52:13.100 --> 52:14.781
And the whole body gets messed up.

52:15.021 --> 52:17.414
And when the whole body gets messed up,

52:17.525 --> 52:19.875
then what happens, that your speedometer

52:20.076 --> 52:22.420
which is the spleen also goes out of order

52:22.621 --> 52:25.301
and you develop a funny type of temperament.

52:25.541 --> 52:28.061
If you say them that, “We have to go now to the airport”

52:28.261 --> 52:30.621
you see them absolutely gone as they are wobbly.

52:30.861 --> 52:33.900
The whole machine goes off, you don’t know why,

52:34.101 --> 52:36.270
if you ask them, “What’s the …?” “Oh! I have to go to the airport.”

52:36.471 --> 52:39.541
So what? Even the name of the airport can put people like that.

52:39.781 --> 52:43.221
So they become absolutely uneasy people,

52:43.461 --> 52:47.661
and this kind of thing when happens, you see, you are in for trouble

52:47.862 --> 52:49.657
you are very much in for trouble.

52:49.864 --> 52:52.282
And this is to be balanced and put right

52:52.483 --> 52:55.044
through your Kundalini awakening.

52:55.701 --> 52:58.380
Now this center as you know, is the most important center

52:58.582 --> 53:02.100
because this is the gate to the Kingdom of God,

53:02.301 --> 53:05.259
and is governed by our Lord Jesus Christ,

53:05.461 --> 53:07.900
who is the embodiment of innocence.

53:08.100 --> 53:12.237
Here He does not incarnate, there He incarnates on this earth.

53:12.438 --> 53:16.969
Now, His crucifixion was fixed, and He was to be crucified

53:17.170 --> 53:21.954
to show that He is eternal life, which does not die.

53:22.155 --> 53:25.380
He is Chaitanya; He is made of all these vibrations.

53:25.581 --> 53:27.781
So He could walk on the water also,

53:28.021 --> 53:32.822
and He could pass through that tight closeness

53:33.036 --> 53:38.300
of these two balloon-like structures, ego and superego,

53:38.501 --> 53:42.261
and could settle there to establish that center for us,

53:42.501 --> 53:44.501
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

53:44.741 --> 53:47.420
which controls your ego and superego, both.

53:47.661 --> 53:52.341
But most surprising, the people who are, say, Catholics

53:52.581 --> 53:55.781
are the people who use their superego.

53:56.021 --> 53:59.141
They get conditioned very much, this should not be done,

53:59.381 --> 54:03.861
confessions, weeping, crying, unhappy...

54:04.100 --> 54:05.580
"We have to be miserable"… Why?

54:05.781 --> 54:09.540
Christ has been crucified for you. He has suffered for you.

54:09.741 --> 54:12.581
Why? If you have accepted Christ, you should be joyous.

54:12.821 --> 54:14.292
Only to be awakened Christ,

54:14.475 --> 54:17.873
so that you get your Realization, that’s all. What is there to cry?

54:18.074 --> 54:20.900
If they are, say Protestants and all that...

54:21.100 --> 54:22.980
I took My birth in Protestant religion,

54:23.181 --> 54:24.941
and many Hindus and Muslims ask Me,

54:25.141 --> 54:27.900
“Mother, why did You take Your birth in Protestant religion?”

54:28.100 --> 54:30.900
So I said, “They are very sophisticated fanatics,

54:31.100 --> 54:32.900
because they rationalize everything.

54:33.100 --> 54:35.900
They rationalize God, they rationalize every dogma, everything

54:36.100 --> 54:37.900
it’s such a thinking going on there,

54:38.100 --> 54:40.380
So it is very difficult to push them back,

54:40.621 --> 54:43.780
that God is not thinking, God is beyond thought,

54:43.981 --> 54:46.461
God is beyond your mind. Mind is limited.

54:46.701 --> 54:48.105
You have to go beyond that,

54:48.306 --> 54:51.420
and that’s why Christ crossed that limit by His resurrection.

54:51.661 --> 54:54.092
So His message is His resurrection

54:54.266 --> 54:58.521
and His resurrection has given us a special quality,

54:58.722 --> 55:00.518
that once He is awakened within us,

55:00.719 --> 55:03.781
the both these ego and superego are sucked in by Him.

55:04.021 --> 55:05.941
That means He died for our sins,

55:06.141 --> 55:08.581
so that He sucked our sins, our karmas,

55:08.821 --> 55:10.996
everything sucked in and this opens out.

55:11.197 --> 55:14.141
Once this opens out, the Kundalini comes out.

55:14.342 --> 55:16.900
And this is what He has done such a great work

55:17.100 --> 55:18.661
that He has died for our sins

55:18.848 --> 55:21.351
and when He is awakened,

55:21.941 --> 55:25.035
both these institutions are sucked in,

55:25.236 --> 55:27.101
and you become

55:28.541 --> 55:31.061
egoless, superegoless,

55:31.261 --> 55:33.900
you become de-conditioned automatically.

55:34.101 --> 55:38.100
Now this great incarnation was called as Mahavishnu

55:38.341 --> 55:40.900
and is described in the ancient books

55:41.100 --> 55:44.339
about fourteen thousand years back, by Markandeya.

55:44.541 --> 55:46.900
But people could not relate it to that,

55:47.100 --> 55:48.900
because when Christians went from here,

55:49.101 --> 55:51.604
they went in a different mode, it was a political stunt.

55:51.805 --> 55:54.899
You see, they carried a gun in one hand and a Bible in another hand.

55:55.100 --> 55:58.014
Such people could not communicate with other people,

55:58.216 --> 55:59.857
who had everything with them,

56:00.058 --> 56:03.261
and they never read those books to them, it was all prohibited.

56:03.501 --> 56:07.661
Bible is too small a book to contain a character like Christ.

56:08.141 --> 56:09.637
He was too great a man,

56:09.838 --> 56:11.899
and we should have gone all out to see

56:12.100 --> 56:14.141
what He’s described in other scriptures,

56:14.421 --> 56:16.261
how He’s talked about, let us find out.

56:16.501 --> 56:18.261
We should have been open minded about it.

56:18.501 --> 56:20.901
Instead of that people just laughed

56:21.101 --> 56:24.466
and mocked at all these old books, the Scriptures,

56:24.667 --> 56:26.188
and they thought they are the wisest.

56:26.390 --> 56:29.821
This is the worst part is that the ego thinks they are the highest,

56:30.061 --> 56:32.021
they are the best, they can do what they like

56:32.221 --> 56:33.661
and that is how they lived.

56:33.901 --> 56:36.861
But thank God, now, people are realizing

56:37.100 --> 56:40.420
that we have missed the point, we have definitely missed the point.

56:40.661 --> 56:42.894
So we have to see what He was

56:43.095 --> 56:46.061
before He came on this earth,

56:46.261 --> 56:50.900
in the Heaven, how He was created, how He was Alpha and Omega,

56:51.100 --> 56:54.500
what was His own nature, for what purpose He came,

56:54.741 --> 56:57.661
and why He died, why He was resurrected,

56:57.901 --> 57:00.140
why this drama was to be carried out?

57:00.341 --> 57:04.341
For this, only three and a half years of Christ cannot explain,

57:04.581 --> 57:08.021
and people cannot tell us why all these things happened.

57:08.221 --> 57:10.900
We have to keep a very open mind about Christ,

57:11.100 --> 57:14.460
and we have to see with our own eyes how it works out.

57:14.781 --> 57:16.900
In Kundalini awakening you’ll be surprised,

57:17.100 --> 57:18.900
when the Kundalini stops here,

57:19.100 --> 57:20.967
and this chakra is closed,

57:21.168 --> 57:25.100
then you have to say the Lord’s prayer, everywhere,

57:25.461 --> 57:27.461
whether you are a Jew, you are a Muslim,

57:27.701 --> 57:29.821
you are a Hindu or a Christian.

57:30.061 --> 57:32.900
From whatever community you become a yogi,

57:33.100 --> 57:36.460
you become a realized soul, you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

57:36.741 --> 57:38.212
because the Kundalini won’t rise,

57:38.413 --> 57:43.061
and that is the one of the greatest proof

57:43.261 --> 57:44.980
that Christ resides here.

57:45.181 --> 57:48.501
If you do not say the Lord’s Prayer, it doesn’t work out.

57:48.741 --> 57:50.940
So Lord’s Prayer is a mantra, is a chanting,

57:51.141 --> 57:53.417
but is to be said by a person who is a realized soul,

57:53.618 --> 57:54.980
who is authorized for you.

57:55.181 --> 57:57.181
Otherwise it is called as anadhikar cheshta,

57:57.421 --> 57:59.260
means the person who has no right,

57:59.461 --> 58:02.021
is trying to do something, is doing a wrong thing.

58:02.221 --> 58:05.100
So those who are realized souls, when they say

58:05.341 --> 58:08.900
this mantra, then this center is opened up,

58:09.100 --> 58:11.500
Christ is awakened, and you are allowed

58:11.737 --> 58:14.682
to see, allow your Kundalini to pass through it

58:14.883 --> 58:18.900
and enter into the realm of this limbic area

58:19.100 --> 58:26.100
where is one thousand petaled Lotus remains.

58:26.595 --> 58:29.461
Now these petals then open up,

58:29.741 --> 58:32.900
because of the pressure being reduced

58:33.100 --> 58:34.770
of the ego and super ego,

58:34.971 --> 58:40.021
and they are in different beautiful colored flames.

58:40.295 --> 58:43.981
The outside starts with a just like

58:44.181 --> 58:47.085
from vibgyor if you take it, from

58:47.301 --> 58:51.380
Vibgyor in the same way they start, but very slowly moving

58:51.621 --> 58:54.394
and the end ones are like crystal, crystal,

58:54.595 --> 58:56.541
absolutely like crystal, they’re shinning.

58:56.781 --> 58:58.860
And when the Kundalini comes out of it

58:59.100 --> 59:02.621
you see the whole thing opened out, the whole chakra opens out.

59:02.861 --> 59:07.181
This is a very important center which has to be opened out

59:07.421 --> 59:10.141
because here all the seven centers are there.

59:10.381 --> 59:12.970
For example, we have got here at the back,

59:13.171 --> 59:16.755
if you start here, from here if you start, is the Mooladhara,

59:16.956 --> 59:19.466
and then around it is the Swadisthana,

59:19.641 --> 59:22.866
and here is the Nabhi, and then it is the Heart.

59:23.067 --> 59:26.411
See now. This is the hole which has to open,

59:26.612 --> 59:27.957
and this is the Heart,

59:28.158 --> 59:31.900
means if there is a dirty heart,

59:32.100 --> 59:35.100
if there is a closed heart, if it is a tired heart,

59:35.341 --> 59:38.819
if there is a sick heart, then this doesn’t open.

59:39.021 --> 59:41.861
So in the heart resides the Spirit,

59:42.100 --> 59:44.420
and that’s why this is the seat of the Spirit,

59:44.661 --> 59:46.181
but it resides in the heart.

59:46.421 --> 59:49.541
So when this opens out,

59:51.341 --> 59:54.047
this flower-like lotus opens out,

59:54.270 --> 59:57.181
then the Kundalini rises in Her own glory,

59:57.382 --> 59:59.821
and you get your Realization, as you got it.

01:00:00.061 --> 01:00:02.981
Now as I told you, it is the beginning.

01:00:03.341 --> 01:00:04.900
In the Bible it is said,

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.900
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

01:00:08.108 --> 01:00:10.603
and you can see it. I see it every day,

01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:12.661
the beautiful tongues of flames.

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.261
But you can’t see it because you are in it.

01:00:15.541 --> 01:00:19.180
Whatever you see, you are not, so you have to first become.

01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:21.981
Once you become and you grow into that,

01:00:22.181 --> 01:00:25.581
then you can also start seeing, but just now you have to become.

01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:28.819
Supposing you see the light, means you are not the light.

01:00:29.021 --> 01:00:30.981
If you see anything, you are not that.

01:00:31.181 --> 01:00:36.336
So the question is of becoming, of actualizing and growing into it

01:00:36.537 --> 01:00:39.141
and knowing about everything that you do,

01:00:39.381 --> 01:00:42.221
Everything should be knowledgeable and should be understood,

01:00:42.461 --> 01:00:44.100
should be logical.

01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:47.981
I hope it works out in this place.
I have told you all about chakras.

01:00:48.181 --> 01:00:51.900
Tomorrow what to do after Self Realization I’ll tell you.

01:00:53.035 --> 01:00:55.191
And we'll have another session here in this hall,

01:00:55.392 --> 01:00:56.762
luckily we have got it,

01:00:56.963 --> 01:00:59.531
and we have decided to have one more program tomorrow.

01:00:59.732 --> 01:01:02.581
I hope it will be nice tomorrow and it won’t rain so much.

01:01:02.821 --> 01:01:05.380
So call all your friends. I will tell you what’s to be done

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:08.177
after Realization, what is the situation.

01:01:08.357 --> 01:01:10.978
So, may God bless you. Thank you.
