00:09:14.163 --> 00:09:21.386
After seeing this love,

00:09:21.587 --> 00:09:25.097
my heart is filled.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:38.813
And I am thinking

00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:42.710
that love is such a big power

00:09:43.434 --> 00:09:48.128
by which so many people are attracted

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:51.375
and become happy.

00:09:52.228 --> 00:09:57.339
This is such a surprising thing.

00:09:57.843 --> 00:09:59.723
In this Kali Yuga,

00:09:59.914 --> 00:10:05.898
no one would have seen this greatness of love.

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:16.976
I think that after seeing this,

00:10:17.645 --> 00:10:23.355
all of you should learn to increase your love.

00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:33.026
And this thing is very easy.

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.662
And you can do it in this way-

00:10:35.863 --> 00:10:41.522
by meditating morning and evening,

00:10:42.462 --> 00:10:48.670
then the bad thoughts in your mind

00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:55.828
which cause jealousy and anger

00:10:56.536 --> 00:11:00.773
and you get hurt by small things,

00:11:00.974 --> 00:11:04.417
all such thoughts will end.

00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:10.783
And after that whatâ€™s left

00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:14.674
its Nirmal prem.

00:11:15.382 --> 00:11:17.613
With this love

00:11:17.814 --> 00:11:21.367
you can give the whole world

00:11:22.402 --> 00:11:25.553
a new life.

00:11:34.637 --> 00:11:38.717
I have told them in Hindi language

00:11:38.917 --> 00:11:42.317
that love, you can see one person's love

00:11:42.557 --> 00:11:45.997
manifested in so many eyes here.

00:11:46.277 --> 00:11:48.917
And when I saw the enthusiasm

00:11:49.197 --> 00:11:56.237
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

00:11:57.797 --> 00:12:03.237
So one can see how powerful is this love.

00:12:03.637 --> 00:12:10.757
All kinds of bad feelings, negative thinking

00:12:11.317 --> 00:12:16.317
and also self-destructive elements

00:12:16.517 --> 00:12:22.037
can be corrected and controlled very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:22.277 --> 00:12:29.437
if you with sincere heart meditate morning and evening, twice.

00:12:30.077 --> 00:12:33.437
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

00:12:33.637 --> 00:12:38.237
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:42.357
That will give you such a strength to love others,

00:12:42.557 --> 00:12:44.557
to forgive others;

00:12:45.077 --> 00:12:49.517
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

00:12:49.717 --> 00:12:54.037
you feeling irritated

00:12:54.317 --> 00:13:00.277
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

00:13:00.477 --> 00:13:04.037
or else sometimes

00:13:04.277 --> 00:13:09.637
we become aggressive towards some people,

00:13:09.997 --> 00:13:15.797
very aggressive, for no fault of theirs.

00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:21.957
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

00:13:22.357 --> 00:13:27.717
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

00:13:28.077 --> 00:13:32.477
it will create more confusions.

00:13:33.597 --> 00:13:36.677
A person who has very bad vibrations,

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:42.717
you can't fight with that person, you cannot control that person.

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:48.477
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

00:13:48.877 --> 00:13:54.157
you should not try to pacify him

00:13:54.477 --> 00:14:01.237
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

00:14:01.437 --> 00:14:07.317
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

00:14:07.517 --> 00:14:11.477
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

00:14:11.677 --> 00:14:15.797
So the best thing is to show your love

00:14:16.077 --> 00:14:21.877
in very sweet and different manner.

00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:26.437
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

00:14:26.717 --> 00:14:30.197
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

00:14:30.477 --> 00:14:33.477
who was living on a very high mountain,

00:14:33.797 --> 00:14:38.117
and there was no way of going by car or anything, and I had to walk.

00:14:38.317 --> 00:14:41.797
So everybody said, "Mother, why should You go there after all?"

00:14:41.997 --> 00:14:44.117
I said, "You see the vibrations.

00:14:44.317 --> 00:14:49.077
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going."

00:14:49.277 --> 00:14:53.037
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

00:14:53.237 --> 00:14:57.277
"Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?"

00:14:57.477 --> 00:15:00.677
So they told us.

00:15:01.077 --> 00:15:04.757
So I said, "I must see this man,"

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:10.317
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

00:15:10.717 --> 00:15:15.077
Now, he's supposed to control the rain.

00:15:15.677 --> 00:15:20.397
He could control the rain. So he was

00:15:20.957 --> 00:15:25.517
sitting there on a stone

00:15:25.997 --> 00:15:30.757
and he was moving his head with great

00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:35.157
agitation when I reached there.

00:15:35.557 --> 00:15:38.357
And it was raining so heavily

00:15:38.677 --> 00:15:43.797
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:48.397
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

00:15:48.837 --> 00:15:53.797
and he came back

00:15:54.077 --> 00:15:58.397
with great anger towards the rain.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:05.197
So he said, "Mother, why did You not allow me to control the rain?"

00:16:05.837 --> 00:16:07.837
I said, "I didn't do that."

00:16:08.037 --> 00:16:11.237
"No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.637
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

00:16:14.837 --> 00:16:17.597
and this rain should not have misbehaved."

00:16:17.957 --> 00:16:20.357
I said, "No, no, he didn't misbehave."

00:16:20.717 --> 00:16:24.837
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

00:16:25.037 --> 00:16:29.157
I said, "You settle down, I'll tell you what has happened.

00:16:29.677 --> 00:16:33.037
See, you have bought a sari for Me

00:16:33.317 --> 00:16:35.717
and you are a sanyasi,

00:16:36.077 --> 00:16:39.157
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

00:16:39.357 --> 00:16:41.597
so the rain has made it convenient.

00:16:41.797 --> 00:16:46.517
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari."

00:16:46.837 --> 00:16:51.517
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

00:16:51.717 --> 00:16:56.757
started crying and he fell at My feet.

00:16:57.077 --> 00:17:00.237
And then he said, "Mother, now I know

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:03.597
what is the greatness of love,

00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:08.557
how it takes you away from mundane things and

00:17:08.797 --> 00:17:12.397
dry behaviour, and takes you to a place

00:17:12.597 --> 00:17:18.877
where you can enjoy the showers of love."

00:17:19.717 --> 00:17:23.117
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

00:17:23.317 --> 00:17:27.997
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

00:17:28.197 --> 00:17:32.517
that you should try your love,

00:17:32.717 --> 00:17:38.957
your tricks of pure love, pure love, and it works.

00:17:39.477 --> 00:17:42.597
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

00:17:42.797 --> 00:17:44.517
You should not give up.

00:17:44.717 --> 00:17:48.637
Some people are very difficult, I agree - very, very difficult.

00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:53.117
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

00:17:53.317 --> 00:17:56.477
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

00:17:56.677 --> 00:17:59.837
and lots of friends and friendship,

00:18:00.037 --> 00:18:03.037
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:03.397 --> 00:18:07.717
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

00:18:07.997 --> 00:18:11.797
because there were very few Sahaja yogis and they brought

00:18:11.997 --> 00:18:15.037
- I don't know why they wanted to do My puja, might be

00:18:15.237 --> 00:18:17.837
Bombay people must have told them, something

00:18:18.157 --> 00:18:20.757
- and they brought kum-kum and everything in a plastic

00:18:20.997 --> 00:18:23.637
little, little bottles - oh, my!

00:18:23.837 --> 00:18:26.317
I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

00:18:26.557 --> 00:18:29.837
I said, "Now what to do? What will happen?"

00:18:30.037 --> 00:18:36.917
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

00:18:37.197 --> 00:18:41.837
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:44.477
I saw them with their flags and

00:18:44.677 --> 00:18:49.157
I didn't know there's such a procession of flags will be here,

00:18:49.357 --> 00:18:53.597
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

00:18:53.837 --> 00:18:57.157
But how they were enjoying each other!

00:18:57.437 --> 00:19:02.277
It's really remarkable. If you can enjoy love,

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:04.517
you won't enjoy anything else

00:19:04.717 --> 00:19:10.077
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

00:19:10.597 --> 00:19:14.677
On the contrary you will see that your body,

00:19:14.877 --> 00:19:17.877
your mind, your thoughts,

00:19:18.077 --> 00:19:22.557
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

00:19:22.757 --> 00:19:25.677
and not for yourself.

00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:29.437
The whole attitude changes.

00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:34.037
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

00:19:34.517 --> 00:19:39.197
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

00:19:39.397 --> 00:19:44.637
Nobody tells the light that, "You have to spread the light

00:19:45.237 --> 00:19:47.877
all over," but it does.

00:19:48.077 --> 00:19:51.797
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

00:19:52.037 --> 00:19:54.357
you are all enlightened with love;

00:19:54.717 --> 00:19:59.677
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

00:19:59.837 --> 00:20:03.157
spontaneously, sahaj.

00:20:04.157 --> 00:20:06.757
I was also very much

00:20:07.037 --> 00:20:12.157
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

00:20:12.677 --> 00:20:14.997
I think it's a very great blessing,

00:20:15.197 --> 00:20:17.757
because these days our young children,

00:20:17.957 --> 00:20:22.317
our young people are getting astray.

00:20:22.677 --> 00:20:25.837
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

00:20:26.037 --> 00:20:28.837
but quite a big trend is going on

00:20:29.197 --> 00:20:33.357
to spoil them and to make them a, what you'd call

00:20:33.557 --> 00:20:38.757
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:43.077
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

00:20:43.277 --> 00:20:46.437
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

00:20:46.637 --> 00:20:50.277
and enjoying each other's company.

00:20:50.597 --> 00:20:53.157
This is something has to happen

00:20:53.557 --> 00:20:56.437
in this country and in every country;

00:20:56.637 --> 00:20:58.957
that we should all feel oneness

00:20:59.197 --> 00:21:03.517
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

00:21:03.877 --> 00:21:08.477
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

00:21:09.037 --> 00:21:11.077
which can be dried any time.

00:21:11.277 --> 00:21:14.317
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

00:21:14.557 --> 00:21:20.157
then what happens is that every

00:21:20.357 --> 00:21:23.597
movement of the ocean you carry with you,

00:21:23.797 --> 00:21:28.637
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

00:21:28.837 --> 00:21:33.637
because you do not have separate identity.

00:21:33.997 --> 00:21:37.757
All these things that make a separate identity

00:21:38.197 --> 00:21:42.397
in our society or in our culture

00:21:42.597 --> 00:21:47.237
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

00:21:47.437 --> 00:21:51.317
all should be completely curbed down.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.477
And this will settle many problems,

00:21:54.677 --> 00:21:59.037
from family life to national life, to international life.

00:21:59.237 --> 00:22:04.117
So we should curb down all such feelings of separatedness,

00:22:04.317 --> 00:22:07.637
that we should have a separate house, separate state,

00:22:07.837 --> 00:22:11.597
separate nation.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:15.637
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

00:22:15.837 --> 00:22:18.157
because great times are coming,

00:22:18.357 --> 00:22:24.117
and so many people at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:24.397 --> 00:22:26.197
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

00:22:26.397 --> 00:22:29.237
then things will be very much different.

00:22:29.437 --> 00:22:32.477
Today it is not with them,

00:22:32.837 --> 00:22:35.317
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

00:22:35.517 --> 00:22:42.397
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

00:22:42.797 --> 00:22:45.357
so they want to have separate of everything.

00:22:45.557 --> 00:22:49.077
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

00:22:49.277 --> 00:22:54.557
with the heat around or maybe with the rain they'll be washed away,

00:22:54.757 --> 00:22:59.437
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

00:22:59.797 --> 00:23:05.037
So we all should be together, whatever may be the differences.

00:23:05.397 --> 00:23:08.157
In different families we are born - after all,

00:23:08.357 --> 00:23:10.717
all cannot be born in one family.

00:23:10.917 --> 00:23:13.877
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

00:23:14.077 --> 00:23:16.917
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

00:23:17.197 --> 00:23:20.317
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

00:23:20.557 --> 00:23:23.237
or separate speciality.

00:23:23.437 --> 00:23:25.437
We are all one with each other,

00:23:25.637 --> 00:23:29.717
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

00:23:30.317 --> 00:23:33.037
I was really very much touched,

00:23:33.237 --> 00:23:36.997
because now the new year is coming with

00:23:37.197 --> 00:23:39.877
a new challenge for all of us

00:23:40.077 --> 00:23:43.237
which we have to accept, that Kali Yuga is over

00:23:43.437 --> 00:23:46.237
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

00:23:46.437 --> 00:23:52.357
for which all of you from every country should have thinking,

00:23:52.557 --> 00:23:55.957
how you can do it in your country and in other countries.

00:23:56.197 --> 00:23:58.637
What are the problems in another country?

00:23:58.917 --> 00:24:01.797
Put your attention outside, not inside

00:24:01.997 --> 00:24:04.237
this way that you should say

00:24:04.477 --> 00:24:07.437
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

00:24:07.677 --> 00:24:12.237
We should know what other people need:

00:24:12.597 --> 00:24:15.317
what is their need,

00:24:15.517 --> 00:24:19.957
what the people in our society, in our nation,

00:24:20.277 --> 00:24:24.477
in our world require?

00:24:24.957 --> 00:24:28.077
Better write them down: what do they require?

00:24:28.397 --> 00:24:32.677
It's better, it will work; might be, it might be corrected.

00:24:32.877 --> 00:24:35.877
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

00:24:36.077 --> 00:24:41.277
and write down what the world needs, and what is to be done.

00:24:41.477 --> 00:24:43.757
It will be a nice idea for all of you

00:24:43.957 --> 00:24:48.677
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

00:24:48.877 --> 00:24:50.797
that we have here today.

00:24:50.997 --> 00:24:53.677
And we'll be one day, you will be surprised

00:24:53.877 --> 00:24:57.557
that we will be the ones who will guide

00:24:57.757 --> 00:25:04.837
and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care.

00:25:05.877 --> 00:25:07.757
So it's very important time,

00:25:07.957 --> 00:25:11.157
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

00:25:11.477 --> 00:25:15.557
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
