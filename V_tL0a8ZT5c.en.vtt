09:14.163 --> 09:21.386
After seeing this love,

09:21.587 --> 09:25.097
my heart is filled.

09:33.919 --> 09:38.813
And I am thinking

09:38.996 --> 09:42.710
that love is such a big power

09:43.434 --> 09:48.128
by which so many people are attracted

09:48.304 --> 09:51.375
and become happy.

09:52.228 --> 09:57.339
This is such a surprising thing.

09:57.843 --> 09:59.723
In this Kali Yuga,

09:59.914 --> 10:05.898
no one would have seen this greatness of love.

10:09.859 --> 10:16.976
I think that after seeing this,

10:17.645 --> 10:23.355
all of you should learn to increase your love.

10:29.312 --> 10:33.026
And this thing is very easy.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.662
And you can do it in this way-

10:35.863 --> 10:41.522
by meditating morning and evening,

10:42.462 --> 10:48.670
then the bad thoughts in your mind

10:49.981 --> 10:55.828
which cause jealousy and anger

10:56.536 --> 11:00.773
and you get hurt by small things,

11:00.974 --> 11:04.417
all such thoughts will end.

11:07.069 --> 11:10.783
And after that whatâ€™s left

11:11.531 --> 11:14.674
its Nirmal prem.

11:15.382 --> 11:17.613
With this love

11:17.814 --> 11:21.367
you can give the whole world

11:22.402 --> 11:25.553
a new life.

11:34.637 --> 11:38.717
I have told them in Hindi language

11:38.917 --> 11:42.317
that love, you can see one person's love

11:42.557 --> 11:45.997
manifested in so many eyes here.

11:46.277 --> 11:48.917
And when I saw the enthusiasm

11:49.197 --> 11:56.237
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

11:57.797 --> 12:03.237
So one can see how powerful is this love.

12:03.637 --> 12:10.757
All kinds of bad feelings, negative thinking

12:11.317 --> 12:16.317
and also self-destructive elements

12:16.517 --> 12:22.037
can be corrected and controlled very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

12:22.277 --> 12:29.437
if you with sincere heart meditate morning and evening, twice.

12:30.077 --> 12:33.437
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

12:33.637 --> 12:38.237
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

12:38.717 --> 12:42.357
That will give you such a strength to love others,

12:42.557 --> 12:44.557
to forgive others;

12:45.077 --> 12:49.517
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

12:49.717 --> 12:54.037
you feeling irritated

12:54.317 --> 13:00.277
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

13:00.477 --> 13:04.037
or else sometimes

13:04.277 --> 13:09.637
we become aggressive towards some people,

13:09.997 --> 13:15.797
very aggressive, for no fault of theirs.

13:16.357 --> 13:21.957
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

13:22.357 --> 13:27.717
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

13:28.077 --> 13:32.477
it will create more confusions.

13:33.597 --> 13:36.677
A person who has very bad vibrations,

13:36.917 --> 13:42.717
you can't fight with that person, you cannot control that person.

13:43.197 --> 13:48.477
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

13:48.877 --> 13:54.157
you should not try to pacify him

13:54.477 --> 14:01.237
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

14:01.437 --> 14:07.317
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

14:07.517 --> 14:11.477
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

14:11.677 --> 14:15.797
So the best thing is to show your love

14:16.077 --> 14:21.877
in very sweet and different manner.

14:22.397 --> 14:26.437
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

14:26.717 --> 14:30.197
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

14:30.477 --> 14:33.477
who was living on a very high mountain,

14:33.797 --> 14:38.117
and there was no way of going by car or anything, and I had to walk.

14:38.317 --> 14:41.797
So everybody said, "Mother, why should You go there after all?"

14:41.997 --> 14:44.117
I said, "You see the vibrations.

14:44.317 --> 14:49.077
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going."

14:49.277 --> 14:53.037
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

14:53.237 --> 14:57.277
"Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?"

14:57.477 --> 15:00.677
So they told us.

15:01.077 --> 15:04.757
So I said, "I must see this man,"

15:06.197 --> 15:10.317
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

15:10.717 --> 15:15.077
Now, he's supposed to control the rain.

15:15.677 --> 15:20.397
He could control the rain. So he was

15:20.957 --> 15:25.517
sitting there on a stone

15:25.997 --> 15:30.757
and he was moving his head with great

15:30.997 --> 15:35.157
agitation when I reached there.

15:35.557 --> 15:38.357
And it was raining so heavily

15:38.677 --> 15:43.797
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

15:44.117 --> 15:48.397
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

15:48.837 --> 15:53.797
and he came back

15:54.077 --> 15:58.397
with great anger towards the rain.

15:58.757 --> 16:05.197
So he said, "Mother, why did You not allow me to control the rain?"

16:05.837 --> 16:07.837
I said, "I didn't do that."

16:08.037 --> 16:11.237
"No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

16:11.437 --> 16:14.637
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

16:14.837 --> 16:17.597
and this rain should not have misbehaved."

16:17.957 --> 16:20.357
I said, "No, no, he didn't misbehave."

16:20.717 --> 16:24.837
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

16:25.037 --> 16:29.157
I said, "You settle down, I'll tell you what has happened.

16:29.677 --> 16:33.037
See, you have bought a sari for Me

16:33.317 --> 16:35.717
and you are a sanyasi,

16:36.077 --> 16:39.157
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

16:39.357 --> 16:41.597
so the rain has made it convenient.

16:41.797 --> 16:46.517
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari."

16:46.837 --> 16:51.517
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

16:51.717 --> 16:56.757
started crying and he fell at My feet.

16:57.077 --> 17:00.237
And then he said, "Mother, now I know

17:00.437 --> 17:03.597
what is the greatness of love,

17:03.837 --> 17:08.557
how it takes you away from mundane things and

17:08.797 --> 17:12.397
dry behaviour, and takes you to a place

17:12.597 --> 17:18.877
where you can enjoy the showers of love."

17:19.717 --> 17:23.117
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

17:23.317 --> 17:27.997
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

17:28.197 --> 17:32.517
that you should try your love,

17:32.717 --> 17:38.957
your tricks of pure love, pure love, and it works.

17:39.477 --> 17:42.597
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

17:42.797 --> 17:44.517
You should not give up.

17:44.717 --> 17:48.637
Some people are very difficult, I agree - very, very difficult.

17:48.837 --> 17:53.117
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

17:53.317 --> 17:56.477
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

17:56.677 --> 17:59.837
and lots of friends and friendship,

18:00.037 --> 18:03.037
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

18:03.397 --> 18:07.717
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

18:07.997 --> 18:11.797
because there were very few Sahaja yogis and they brought

18:11.997 --> 18:15.037
- I don't know why they wanted to do My puja, might be

18:15.237 --> 18:17.837
Bombay people must have told them, something

18:18.157 --> 18:20.757
- and they brought kum-kum and everything in a plastic

18:20.997 --> 18:23.637
little, little bottles - oh, my!

18:23.837 --> 18:26.317
I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

18:26.557 --> 18:29.837
I said, "Now what to do? What will happen?"

18:30.037 --> 18:36.917
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

18:37.197 --> 18:41.837
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.477
I saw them with their flags and

18:44.677 --> 18:49.157
I didn't know there's such a procession of flags will be here,

18:49.357 --> 18:53.597
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

18:53.837 --> 18:57.157
But how they were enjoying each other!

18:57.437 --> 19:02.277
It's really remarkable. If you can enjoy love,

19:02.517 --> 19:04.517
you won't enjoy anything else

19:04.717 --> 19:10.077
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

19:10.597 --> 19:14.677
On the contrary you will see that your body,

19:14.877 --> 19:17.877
your mind, your thoughts,

19:18.077 --> 19:22.557
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

19:22.757 --> 19:25.677
and not for yourself.

19:25.917 --> 19:29.437
The whole attitude changes.

19:29.837 --> 19:34.037
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

19:34.517 --> 19:39.197
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

19:39.397 --> 19:44.637
Nobody tells the light that, "You have to spread the light

19:45.237 --> 19:47.877
all over," but it does.

19:48.077 --> 19:51.797
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

19:52.037 --> 19:54.357
you are all enlightened with love;

19:54.717 --> 19:59.677
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

19:59.837 --> 20:03.157
spontaneously, sahaj.

20:04.157 --> 20:06.757
I was also very much

20:07.037 --> 20:12.157
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

20:12.677 --> 20:14.997
I think it's a very great blessing,

20:15.197 --> 20:17.757
because these days our young children,

20:17.957 --> 20:22.317
our young people are getting astray.

20:22.677 --> 20:25.837
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

20:26.037 --> 20:28.837
but quite a big trend is going on

20:29.197 --> 20:33.357
to spoil them and to make them a, what you'd call

20:33.557 --> 20:38.757
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

20:39.037 --> 20:43.077
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

20:43.277 --> 20:46.437
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

20:46.637 --> 20:50.277
and enjoying each other's company.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.157
This is something has to happen

20:53.557 --> 20:56.437
in this country and in every country;

20:56.637 --> 20:58.957
that we should all feel oneness

20:59.197 --> 21:03.517
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

21:03.877 --> 21:08.477
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

21:09.037 --> 21:11.077
which can be dried any time.

21:11.277 --> 21:14.317
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

21:14.557 --> 21:20.157
then what happens is that every

21:20.357 --> 21:23.597
movement of the ocean you carry with you,

21:23.797 --> 21:28.637
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

21:28.837 --> 21:33.637
because you do not have separate identity.

21:33.997 --> 21:37.757
All these things that make a separate identity

21:38.197 --> 21:42.397
in our society or in our culture

21:42.597 --> 21:47.237
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

21:47.437 --> 21:51.317
all should be completely curbed down.

21:51.677 --> 21:54.477
And this will settle many problems,

21:54.677 --> 21:59.037
from family life to national life, to international life.

21:59.237 --> 22:04.117
So we should curb down all such feelings of separatedness,

22:04.317 --> 22:07.637
that we should have a separate house, separate state,

22:07.837 --> 22:11.597
separate nation.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.637
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

22:15.837 --> 22:18.157
because great times are coming,

22:18.357 --> 22:24.117
and so many people at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

22:24.397 --> 22:26.197
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

22:26.397 --> 22:29.237
then things will be very much different.

22:29.437 --> 22:32.477
Today it is not with them,

22:32.837 --> 22:35.317
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

22:35.517 --> 22:42.397
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

22:42.797 --> 22:45.357
so they want to have separate of everything.

22:45.557 --> 22:49.077
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

22:49.277 --> 22:54.557
with the heat around or maybe with the rain they'll be washed away,

22:54.757 --> 22:59.437
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

22:59.797 --> 23:05.037
So we all should be together, whatever may be the differences.

23:05.397 --> 23:08.157
In different families we are born - after all,

23:08.357 --> 23:10.717
all cannot be born in one family.

23:10.917 --> 23:13.877
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

23:14.077 --> 23:16.917
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

23:17.197 --> 23:20.317
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

23:20.557 --> 23:23.237
or separate speciality.

23:23.437 --> 23:25.437
We are all one with each other,

23:25.637 --> 23:29.717
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

23:30.317 --> 23:33.037
I was really very much touched,

23:33.237 --> 23:36.997
because now the new year is coming with

23:37.197 --> 23:39.877
a new challenge for all of us

23:40.077 --> 23:43.237
which we have to accept, that Kali Yuga is over

23:43.437 --> 23:46.237
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

23:46.437 --> 23:52.357
for which all of you from every country should have thinking,

23:52.557 --> 23:55.957
how you can do it in your country and in other countries.

23:56.197 --> 23:58.637
What are the problems in another country?

23:58.917 --> 24:01.797
Put your attention outside, not inside

24:01.997 --> 24:04.237
this way that you should say

24:04.477 --> 24:07.437
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

24:07.677 --> 24:12.237
We should know what other people need:

24:12.597 --> 24:15.317
what is their need,

24:15.517 --> 24:19.957
what the people in our society, in our nation,

24:20.277 --> 24:24.477
in our world require?

24:24.957 --> 24:28.077
Better write them down: what do they require?

24:28.397 --> 24:32.677
It's better, it will work; might be, it might be corrected.

24:32.877 --> 24:35.877
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

24:36.077 --> 24:41.277
and write down what the world needs, and what is to be done.

24:41.477 --> 24:43.757
It will be a nice idea for all of you

24:43.957 --> 24:48.677
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

24:48.877 --> 24:50.797
that we have here today.

24:50.997 --> 24:53.677
And we'll be one day, you will be surprised

24:53.877 --> 24:57.557
that we will be the ones who will guide

24:57.757 --> 25:04.837
and lead the rest of the people with our love, attention and care.

25:05.877 --> 25:07.757
So it's very important time,

25:07.957 --> 25:11.157
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

25:11.477 --> 25:15.557
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
