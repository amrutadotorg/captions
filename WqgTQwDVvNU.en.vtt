00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:26.218
It’s my privilege and pleasure to introduce

00:55:26.418 --> 00:55:31.738
the first of our distinguished guest-speakers.

00:55:32.618 --> 00:55:35.578
He bears a famous name

00:55:36.338 --> 00:55:39.338
and needs very little in the way of introduction.

00:55:40.458 --> 00:55:46.458
Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and industrialist

00:55:46.458 --> 00:55:50.458
of course, he was the man who invented dynamites

00:55:50.698 --> 00:55:57.738
and left his fortune to be used for the Nobel Prize

00:55:58.538 --> 00:56:00.658
himself was a bachelor,

00:56:00.898 --> 00:56:06.698
but Mr. Claes Nobel is his grandnephew.

00:56:07.778 --> 00:56:15.178
He was inspired by the work of his distinguished forebear

00:56:16.058 --> 00:56:24.058
and has himself had the inspiration to found an organization

00:56:24.698 --> 00:56:28.618
which is called “United Earth”, which he is still the chairman.

00:56:28.778 --> 00:56:32.738
And this organization has itself instituted a prize

00:56:32.778 --> 00:56:35.938
in the ecological sphere

00:56:36.018 --> 00:56:41.778
which is not one of the Nobel Prizes, there is no prize for ecology.

00:56:42.338 --> 00:56:46.578
And this prize he calls “Earth Ethics”.

00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:49.098
He met Shri Mataji last year in India

00:56:49.138 --> 00:56:54.458
when he was the chairman of the World Philosophers conference.

00:56:54.898 --> 00:56:57.138
So without any more ado, I’dd like to

00:56:57.178 --> 00:57:00.858
invite Mr. Claes Nobel to come on to the stage, please.

00:57:12.898 --> 00:57:18.978
Well, indeed, life is full of surprises,

00:57:19.378 --> 00:57:25.698
after all we are meeting here inspired by the message and work

00:57:26.098 --> 00:57:30.938
by Holy Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:57:31.338 --> 00:57:39.058
and She is not here in body, but She is here in Spirits.

00:57:39.338 --> 00:57:42.298
Also the wonderful letter that we recently heard

00:57:42.338 --> 00:57:45.138
from ayatollah Ruhani

00:57:45.258 --> 00:57:49.138
which speaks very highly about the work and the mission

00:57:49.178 --> 00:57:51.538
of the Holy Mother,

00:57:51.658 --> 00:57:56.418
where he indicates the importance of women

00:57:56.458 --> 00:58:00.258
in the world is needed here.

00:58:00.618 --> 00:58:05.258
And frankly speaking, only 36 hours ago

00:58:05.298 --> 00:58:07.858
I did not know that I would be here

00:58:07.978 --> 00:58:11.218
tonight at the Royal Albert Hall,

00:58:11.298 --> 00:58:14.778
addressing this audience.

00:58:14.938 --> 00:58:22.938
Still I say: Dear Holy Mother,

00:58:23.578 --> 00:58:30.978
and I also recognize her husband Sir C.P. Srivastava in the audience,

00:58:31.178 --> 00:58:37.698
and I say, most importantly: dear friends, fellow-seekers of truth,

00:58:37.898 --> 00:58:41.058
Are you out there? Because with all this light,

00:58:41.218 --> 00:58:44.978
I can only see about 20 people in front of me.

00:58:45.098 --> 00:58:48.178
So, say “yes”, if you are in here, then I know…

00:58:49.498 --> 00:58:50.578
Ah…

00:58:57.418 --> 00:59:02.698
Now I can see you, I can here you as well as you can see and here me.

00:59:02.778 --> 00:59:08.058
With that said, I want to say I have a vision,

00:59:08.298 --> 00:59:13.938
I have a vision for a world that is better, safer and saner

00:59:14.058 --> 00:59:17.458
than the one that we presently are experiencing.

00:59:17.658 --> 00:59:23.218
It is a world where people live in harmony and peace with themselves

00:59:23.338 --> 00:59:26.858
and in harmony and peace with Nature.

00:59:27.018 --> 00:59:32.338
Now, those words of vast, it’s a bold vision,

00:59:32.618 --> 00:59:38.458
do I have a practical way of going from vision to reality?

00:59:39.298 --> 00:59:44.138
Yes, I will share that with you.

00:59:44.338 --> 00:59:48.418
And I will share it and indicate a tone of the meeting

00:59:48.458 --> 00:59:52.298
by ten small words.

00:59:53.458 --> 00:59:57.538
And they indicate how this global world transformation

00:59:57.618 --> 00:59:59.978
should be undertaken.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:11.178
And they are: Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Deeds,

01:00:11.378 --> 01:00:16.418
Right Here and Right Now.

01:00:17.538 --> 01:00:26.818
The key word, the key word is, of course, “right”,

01:00:27.138 --> 01:00:30.098
this world is fighting about what is right,

01:00:30.218 --> 01:00:34.178
what is right to you might be wrong to me or vice-versa,

01:00:34.218 --> 01:00:36.058
it’s a grey area.

01:00:36.178 --> 01:00:39.098
So we need a reference point,

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:43.578
so we can distinguish between right and wrong

01:00:43.698 --> 01:00:47.418
and between truth and lie.

01:00:47.698 --> 01:00:47.858
Tonight Shri Mataji will show us what is right.

01:00:56.618 --> 01:01:00.658
Tonight Shri Mataji will empower us

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:05.498
to become the masters of our own destiny.

01:01:05.698 --> 01:01:09.538
And tonight we’ll be guided

01:01:09.578 --> 01:01:14.778
by the knowledge of Self Realization.

01:01:15.018 --> 01:01:19.898
We will do so in the light of Truth

01:01:20.258 --> 01:01:27.538
and we shall all know absolute truth and absolute peace.

01:01:27.698 --> 01:01:33.658
Now, 100 years ago Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prizes.

01:01:33.778 --> 01:01:37.138
These prizes represent excellence.

01:01:37.298 --> 01:01:42.698
We have prizes in chemistry, physics, medicine, literature

01:01:42.738 --> 01:01:45.178
and peace.

01:01:45.258 --> 01:01:52.778
All those prizes, I hold the peace prize to be the finest.

01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:59.938
And I want to tell you that Alfred Nobel listened to a woman,

01:01:59.938 --> 01:02:03.698
he listened to his secretary Bertha von Suttner in Paris

01:02:03.698 --> 01:02:05.778
100 years ago when she said:

01:02:05.778 --> 01:02:10.458
”Dr. Nobel, you should use your vast fortune

01:02:10.498 --> 01:02:13.898
for betterment of the world”.

01:02:14.178 --> 01:02:18.458
Tonight we are listening to another woman,

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:23.698
we are listening to the message of Shri Mataji.

01:02:24.058 --> 01:02:29.018
However, I am very much inspired first by my uncle

01:02:29.218 --> 01:02:32.978
and later on, you will hear, by Shri Mataji.

01:02:33.258 --> 01:02:37.138
Alfred Nobel talked much about peace.

01:02:37.378 --> 01:02:41.938
He was frightened that his awesome explosive dynamite

01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:46.218
which cleared up land for harbors and tunnels

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:49.458
could also be used for war affair.

01:02:49.618 --> 01:02:54.538
Today, in the arsenal of military systems,

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.778
it’s like a small fire cracker,

01:02:56.778 --> 01:03:02.578
but at that time dynamite was a most awesome destructive material.

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:05.778
Now, Alfred Nobel thought basically

01:03:05.898 --> 01:03:10.538
about peace as absence of war.

01:03:10.938 --> 01:03:17.298
But I assure you that peace is much more than absence of war.

01:03:17.698 --> 01:03:23.218
And I see that peace exists in four specific areas.

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:29.178
The first area is the peace that an individual has in him or herself

01:03:29.378 --> 01:03:34.538
how do we treat our mind, our emotions and our feelings?

01:03:34.698 --> 01:03:38.098
How do we treat our body?

01:03:38.258 --> 01:03:43.178
Are we slaves to other masters

01:03:43.258 --> 01:03:45.658
or are we our own master?

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:50.458
Until we have the inner peace in ourselves,

01:03:50.498 --> 01:03:54.138
we can never have an outer peace in the world.

01:03:54.218 --> 01:03:58.378
And the safest and best way of finding world peace

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:04.218
is to have mass movements that include all religions and philosophies,

01:04:04.378 --> 01:04:10.618
all enterprises, whether they are of political or scientific nature,

01:04:10.698 --> 01:04:14.338
to realize what inner peace is.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:18.698
And that’s what we are talking about tonight: Self Realization.

01:04:19.018 --> 01:04:21.058
What does Self Realization mean?

01:04:21.178 --> 01:04:26.538
Well, it means that we are realizing something, but what is the Self?

01:04:26.698 --> 01:04:33.098
Ladies and gentlemen, the Self in us is the Divine Cosmic Power

01:04:33.098 --> 01:04:36.218
that exist in each and every individual,

01:04:36.218 --> 01:04:42.418
but which is dormant in most people around the world.

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:46.018
The spiritual leaders from ancient lores,

01:04:46.058 --> 01:04:49.218
they knew about this and they spoke about this.

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:55.298
But this secret of secrets has been suppressed deliberately

01:04:55.418 --> 01:05:00.978
until Shri Mataji with great courage and great wisdom,

01:05:01.138 --> 01:05:04.698
being an old soul would decided by Herself

01:05:04.738 --> 01:05:08.298
to come back to the Earth at this critical time in our history,

01:05:08.298 --> 01:05:11.898
in order to share Her knowledge and wisdom

01:05:11.938 --> 01:05:14.498
which is the Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:17.578
which is instant Self Realization,

01:05:17.658 --> 01:05:20.978
which is to activate the dormant principle

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.938
that we all have: the Kundalini,

01:05:22.978 --> 01:05:28.978
and have the Kundalini to rise up and thus we become

01:05:29.218 --> 01:05:35.978
what it says in the Bible: “You are created in My image”.

01:05:43.258 --> 01:05:46.978
That was the first category, first sphere of peace

01:05:47.058 --> 01:05:49.058
the one we have in ourselves.

01:05:49.138 --> 01:05:55.698
The next one is the peace that we have among each other

01:05:55.858 --> 01:06:01.058
in the family, in our community, in our nation,

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:04.098
that we have peace with other ethnic groups

01:06:04.138 --> 01:06:06.378
and with other religions,

01:06:06.498 --> 01:06:13.138
that we really become true what I call “active listeners”

01:06:13.378 --> 01:06:17.098
And, as “active listeners” are able to put ourselves

01:06:17.138 --> 01:06:24.098
in the place, in the shoes of the other party.

01:06:24.218 --> 01:06:28.658
Only then, when we have the outlook from their perspective,

01:06:28.738 --> 01:06:32.218
shall we understand what they are trying to say.

01:06:32.338 --> 01:06:34.978
We are always talking, talking, talking.

01:06:35.138 --> 01:06:38.218
My dear wife, who is not here tonight,

01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:42.938
she said: ”Claes, you talk too much, you don’t listen”.

01:06:43.218 --> 01:06:48.658
I have start to practice what she calls “active listening”.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:53.218
The third sphere is a sphere that put me in, originally.

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:56.498
After all, I am a European Swedish business man,

01:06:56.498 --> 01:07:00.618
why am I up here speaking the language of spirituality

01:07:00.658 --> 01:07:05.098
and saying that that is where the hope of the future exists?

01:07:05.298 --> 01:07:09.338
I am doing so, because I have a deep and profound

01:07:09.378 --> 01:07:11.458
reverence for Nature,

01:07:11.538 --> 01:07:16.098
as a Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer said.

01:07:16.258 --> 01:07:19.418
After, he add, worked and worked, trying to

01:07:19.538 --> 01:07:23.338
distil the phrase that contained everything that he knew,

01:07:23.338 --> 01:07:26.258
everything he wanted to say through his philosophy,

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:32.258
Dr. Albert Schweitzer calling the phrase “reverence for Life”

01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:35.618
Nature is nothing but a plethora

01:07:35.698 --> 01:07:39.778
of examples of life in its multifaceted version.

01:07:39.978 --> 01:07:44.298
And I tell you, dear fellows seekers of Truth,

01:07:44.418 --> 01:07:48.458
we, humanity today, in our ignorance,

01:07:48.578 --> 01:07:51.738
in our greed and in our lust for power,

01:07:51.898 --> 01:07:54.098
we are in the process of destroying the

01:07:54.298 --> 01:07:56.778
very thing that makes this planet unique

01:07:56.858 --> 01:08:01.338
and that is Life on Earth.

01:08:08.098 --> 01:08:14.418
And, so far, we do not know of another planet in the universe

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:17.258
that harbors this miracle.

01:08:17.338 --> 01:08:24.698
Earth is like a blue jewel in space

01:08:24.698 --> 01:08:28.378
and is only one Earth and this Earth is fragile

01:08:28.458 --> 01:08:31.218
and we must take care of her and respect her.

01:08:31.218 --> 01:08:33.658
Earth is also called Nature.

01:08:33.658 --> 01:08:37.938
We cannot break the laws of Nature,

01:08:38.218 --> 01:08:41.618
we must live by the laws of Nature.

01:08:41.698 --> 01:08:44.658
If we break them, Mother Earth will break us.

01:08:44.898 --> 01:08:47.858
And we are only one species of –

01:08:47.938 --> 01:08:53.138
we don’t know how many species we have – 5, 10, 15 millions.

01:08:53.338 --> 01:08:55.258
But this we know

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:59.018
and this is being proven by the world foremost scientist

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:05.618
in Harvard University U.S., Dr. Edward O. Wilson:

01:09:05.698 --> 01:09:13.058
we are today bringing to extinction 250 species per day.

01:09:13.218 --> 01:09:16.938
That is as if we are deliberately and willfully

01:09:17.018 --> 01:09:19.698
pulling out thread after thread after thread

01:09:19.778 --> 01:09:22.458
of what consists the fabric of life

01:09:22.538 --> 01:09:25.858
and Mother Nature will not let us continue doing that

01:09:25.938 --> 01:09:30.698
without correcting us as naughty children.

01:09:31.058 --> 01:09:37.378
The fourth sphere of peace is the peace that we shall know

01:09:37.498 --> 01:09:41.018
between ourselves and God.

01:09:41.378 --> 01:09:44.178
Any religion or any group

01:09:44.218 --> 01:09:48.018
who raises their arms and destroys its enemy

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:54.138
in the name of God is not following what God has asked us to do.

01:09:54.138 --> 01:09:57.778
The world should not know of violence

01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:06.778
and the world should not know of war.

01:10:07.658 --> 01:10:12.618
I call, as you earlier heard, these four spheres of peace

01:10:12.698 --> 01:10:15.698
“Earth Ethics”

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:19.538
And tonight we will hear more from the Holy Mother

01:10:19.658 --> 01:10:23.978
how we shall have a reference point, how we can distinguish

01:10:24.058 --> 01:10:26.738
if we have a charlatan and a fraud in front of us,

01:10:26.778 --> 01:10:30.938
or if it’s a genuine honest person.

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:36.258
And you, dear audience, you have come here tonight

01:10:36.338 --> 01:10:39.178
from many different walks of life.

01:10:39.338 --> 01:10:46.018
And like you, I have also been seeking for the truth.

01:10:46.138 --> 01:10:52.098
I am beginning to discern truth rather clearly

01:10:52.418 --> 01:10:57.938
and let me tell you this, that I look upon life on Earth

01:10:58.058 --> 01:11:02.178
as a kind of a school, a school

01:11:02.218 --> 01:11:07.338
where we are learning perfection and purification.

01:11:07.778 --> 01:11:11.658
Now on Earth everything is interdependent,

01:11:11.698 --> 01:11:15.018
interactive and interrelated.

01:11:15.258 --> 01:11:18.258
And on Earth, as well as in Heaven, I guess

01:11:18.298 --> 01:11:20.618
every action has a reaction,

01:11:20.698 --> 01:11:25.538
every effect has a cause, every cause has an effect.

01:11:25.898 --> 01:11:31.138
And the Holy Mother, as I said, She is a highly evolved soul,

01:11:31.218 --> 01:11:35.058
She has learned from many many lives

01:11:35.098 --> 01:11:37.498
what it is all about

01:11:37.618 --> 01:11:41.578
and these what it is all about laws, the unseen laws,

01:11:41.618 --> 01:11:43.378
the spiritual laws,

01:11:43.418 --> 01:11:48.218
they’re always here and they work as infallible

01:11:48.258 --> 01:11:51.418
as the law of gravity works.

01:11:51.658 --> 01:11:55.178
It always works, all those unseen laws.

01:11:55.378 --> 01:12:01.098
It is for us to learn and perceive that law.

01:12:02.378 --> 01:12:10.058
I am very comfortable with the teachings of Shri Mataji

01:12:10.218 --> 01:12:15.498
and I am very comfortable with the Holy Mother Herself.

01:12:15.618 --> 01:12:21.698
I say so because in the Bible there is one saying

01:12:21.698 --> 01:12:28.338
among several good ones: “You shall know the tree by its fruit”.

01:12:28.458 --> 01:12:32.738
And lately, I have met young men and women

01:12:32.738 --> 01:12:35.218
in different parts of the world,

01:12:35.298 --> 01:12:38.418
and certainly from many different parts of the world

01:12:38.538 --> 01:12:44.578
and they are all shining, beautiful human individuals

01:12:44.698 --> 01:12:49.578
that radiate inner peace and balance.

01:12:49.778 --> 01:12:51.458
They are unique.

01:12:51.538 --> 01:12:55.298
You who follow or who are in a process of following

01:12:55.778 --> 01:12:58.938
will be, I think,

01:12:59.018 --> 01:13:02.058
those individuals who shall call themselves

01:13:02.098 --> 01:13:05.858
“ambassadors for the Earth”.

01:13:06.258 --> 01:13:09.378
And after tonight session is over,

01:13:09.578 --> 01:13:14.258
I’m sure that you shall see clearly

01:13:14.298 --> 01:13:17.698
how you shall distinguish between truth and lie

01:13:17.978 --> 01:13:22.298
and you shall realize that blind faith

01:13:22.378 --> 01:13:29.378
is of no value and that fanaticism and

01:13:32.218 --> 01:13:37.098
to take up violence as a last argument is of no value:

01:13:37.138 --> 01:13:40.978
eventually those things will bring you unhappiness

01:13:41.018 --> 01:13:47.138
and will bring you conflict and potential war.

01:13:49.498 --> 01:13:57.298
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that we hold the future in our hands.

01:13:57.418 --> 01:14:00.858
I know that the future is in your hands

01:14:00.938 --> 01:14:03.658
I know it’s in my hands.

01:14:03.698 --> 01:14:08.178
And I also know that the future of the planet

01:14:08.218 --> 01:14:13.498
exists in the heart of the individuals.

01:14:13.698 --> 01:14:20.698
Now, I will close my remarks tonight by a fable from India.

01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:26.218
I heard it when I attended the Rio Conference ’92,

01:14:26.378 --> 01:14:29.938
that was the 20-th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference,

01:14:30.018 --> 01:14:35.378
that for the first time put on the environment on the world agenda.

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:39.538
In Stockholm ’72 we had only two heads of states:

01:14:39.618 --> 01:14:42.458
the prime minister of India and the king of Sweden.

01:14:42.458 --> 01:14:47.698
In Rio, 20 years later, we had 110 heads of states.

01:14:48.018 --> 01:14:52.298
A marvelous declaration was drafted, “Agenda 21”.

01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:56.058
Just last week in New York there were 70 heads of state

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:59.058
that continued with “Rio plus 5”.

01:14:59.218 --> 01:15:01.538
What is I told Sir C.P. when he asked me

01:15:01.538 --> 01:15:04.218
about how is the outcome of this conference,

01:15:04.218 --> 01:15:08.218
I said: Well, we are talking about sustainable future,

01:15:08.218 --> 01:15:11.258
for it seems to me that in UN there is much

01:15:11.258 --> 01:15:14.338
of a sustainable dialogue ongoing.

01:15:14.418 --> 01:15:16.578
Tonight we should take the action.

01:15:16.578 --> 01:15:22.458
Well, I asked the holy man from India, a white robed Acharya

01:15:22.498 --> 01:15:24.618
and I said:

01:15:25.218 --> 01:15:29.378
“Is there hope for the future?”.

01:15:29.538 --> 01:15:36.418
And he said: “Mr. Nobel, I will answer your question as follows”,

01:15:36.938 --> 01:15:42.178
and this is what he said: “When the Dear Lord had created the Earth,

01:15:42.258 --> 01:15:46.698
He was very very happy, very very very pleased,

01:15:46.738 --> 01:15:51.458
it was His finest creation in the Universe

01:15:51.538 --> 01:15:55.298
and He decided to celebrate, to have a party.

01:15:55.418 --> 01:16:01.898
And God invited in all angels and all the devils.

01:16:02.098 --> 01:16:03.898
When they were there,

01:16:03.938 --> 01:16:06.698
He toasted them and wished them welcome as a good host

01:16:06.698 --> 01:16:07.698
and said:

01:16:07.738 --> 01:16:12.218
There is only one rule that you must strictly obey while you are here

01:16:12.338 --> 01:16:15.298
having a good time. And, by the way,

01:16:15.458 --> 01:16:19.738
the best food and the best wine was served, the ambrosia and nectar.

01:16:19.898 --> 01:16:25.018
And He said: "There is one rule and that is that while you are here"

01:16:25.138 --> 01:16:32.178
celebrating My creation, you may never bend your elbows.

01:16:32.378 --> 01:16:35.258
The devils cried out and said:

01:16:35.338 --> 01:16:38.978
We don’t want any part of such party.

01:16:39.098 --> 01:16:41.938
How can we enjoy it, not bending our elbows?!

01:16:41.978 --> 01:16:44.578
So they left.

01:16:45.018 --> 01:16:47.178
Then the party started,

01:16:47.218 --> 01:16:49.738
the angels were having a jolly good time

01:16:49.858 --> 01:16:53.218
and the Dear God was very very happy.”

01:16:53.338 --> 01:17:01.338
Now, how could they eat and drink, without bending their elbows?

01:17:03.698 --> 01:17:10.738
Well, I sense that you can see what the moral of the fable is.

01:17:10.898 --> 01:17:14.098
The angels were feeding each other,

01:17:14.138 --> 01:17:18.778
they were sharing and they were caring,

01:17:18.938 --> 01:17:24.738
and that is what we shall do in the future together.

01:17:24.978 --> 01:17:26.738
Thank you very much.
