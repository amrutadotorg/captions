00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
...is because they want to get realization. It's only aggressiveness or they belong to some cult or something

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.360
and uh..they don't want to admit that they have been stupid to pay money there so also they try to, sort of, profess that no, no, no, no

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.000
this is correct and that is correct because this is too much that you are not supposed to pay.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.660
So, if you ask questions, it should not be an aggressive question - it should be a question that relates to your ascent.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.740
will be much better, wiser because I have nothing to gain from you - it's a fact, I have nothing to gain from you

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.000
but even when I say, "I've to give you something," maybe, ego rises, "Who is She to give us, why should?"

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.960
I mean, I would say, "Better you do it. Can you do it?" - I'll be very happy.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.580
You see, as you know, I have a good family, everything is there [UNCLEAR -BUT?] like a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.880
ascetic I'm moving all over the world, working hard with people.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.840
If you can do it, nothing like it. It's My lot to do it and I'm doing it because that's My job.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.360
There's nothing that I'm higher or lower than you. On the contrary, in a way, I always try to please you so that you get it.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:15.140
Mother's job is a thankless job. She has to go on telling you, "Please have it, it's your own, why not?"

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.820
Any question, yes please, ask?

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.360
Will you say it loudly? Can you [UNCLEAR]

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.300
[INAUDIBLE] doesn't have to perform too much physical exertion and mental

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.160
- and mental [INAUDIBLE]
 - You're asking about something
 - Yeah.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.920
- Hmmm
 - Is this Kundalini [UNCLEAR] and you have to perform all sorts of mental or other forms of effort to reach

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.760
No, nothing. First of all you get your realization, alright? First you get your realization, means yoga - the union takes place.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.740
Sahaja means - 'Saha' means with, 'Ja' means born - is born with you means spontaneously.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.680
So the Kundalini rises automatically - She rises without any effort. Please be seated, I'll tell you.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.300
Then, what happens, that the Kundalini sees that you have problems

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.320
so She goes back. Supposing, you are a liver patient - take a simple question - you are a cancer patient

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.520
or any other patient - say on the physical level. Then She sees that the physical side should be alright

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.320
so She goes and bangs there. You can see it with your naked eyes, you can see it's banging at that point.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.540
then you have to know how to make Her move from there, how to give Her energy, how to make Her move,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.940
how to improve that, how to manoeuvre - that you have to know, that decoding you have. This is the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.380
knowledge of the Divine laws which you have to know which is very simple - even the children spontaneously.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.100
You see a child putting his finger - all the children outside were putting their finger in the mouth.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.600
What does that mean - that the people sitting inside are feeling guilty.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:15.040
They, they know. If they put this finger, means something, if they put this finger, means something, if they put this thumb, means something.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.200
So the children spontaneously know because they're born realized children but

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.900
you will have to know what it is in decoding but it's very simple is not difficult. Even

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.860
the one - now he's a doctor, alright but those who are not doctor have cured cancer, have cured, definitely cured cancer.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.520
They have cured many diseases because what you have to do is to go to the source of the trouble and just try to help the source

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.040
and that's how you cure but it's not like a spiritualist thing that you shake before the person and he feels alright - it's not that.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.620
You know exactly what you have to do. So first of all, you raise your Kundalini, you get your realization - this is the first yoga.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.200
Then you have to look after your Kundalini, gradually you have to raise it again and again -

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.480
for that there might be an obstruction on all levels maybe, physical, mental, emotional -

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.300
any level, there could be an obstruction so you have to understand what this obstruction is

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:24.160
and then you should know how to clean that. If you know how to clear it out, you take your Kundalini up - it is like that.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.280
So, there is no effort as such because you see yourself as an outsider to all this thing.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.080
Like this saree of Mine has supposing some spot on it. So I see it. If I don't see it,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.180
I cannot cure it. But not only that I see it but also I know how to do it.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.340
So I clear it out - I'm not identified with that.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.020
I don't have to tell you that you do this, you don't do that - nothing. It just happens to you spontaneously - I don't have to tell you.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.220
You know yourself and you do it yourself because you become your own master, I don't have to tell you.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.680
Only thing if I raise your Kundalini, if your Spirit is enlightened, in the light you see yourself.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.500
Like in the darkness I'll have to tell you walk carefully, don't go here, you'll hit that, do that

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.580
but if I put on the light, you can see it clearly - it's that simple as that but still you must know that how to keep the light on.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.200
That's a little thing which you have to know if you know that you become a master.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.460
Alright. It sounds fantastic, isn't it - it is. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.640
It is. You are fantastic - what do you think of yourself? Aren't you fantastic - look at yourself.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.900
Look at your eyes, how you're made, how beautifully. Just look at your brain -

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.960
everything that you are, can any computer make like that? You are a computer which doesn't think and knows.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:57.320
You look at Me, you know I'm sitting here. You don't think about it, you don't have to go to some thinking process to come around to see - it just knows.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.120
What a computer you are made! So must be having some higher connections. Only it is to be connected to the mains - that's the point is.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.180
But sometimes the connections are loose so you have to put the connections alright.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.380
Anything else? Ask questions, no harm.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:31.740
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.640
giving instructions, ummm, I find it confusing because [UNCLEAR] those instructions

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.540
something is trying to control me. If it is something, [ UNCLEAR - GOD TRYING TO SPEAK FOR WHAT?]

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.640
If during her spiritual [UNCLEAR] If during her spiritual development she starts hearing voices,

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.080
she, she's a little confused. She's wondering, is it the voice of God or is it something which

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:06.400
It is never voice of God, it's wrong. Your hands will speak

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.040
not your ears. You shouldn't hear anything - that's all wrong.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.540
I don't want to harp, tell you all about it but you will know what it is. You should never hear voices - is a wrong idea.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.760
- I, I feel it's wrong [INAUDIBLE]
 - She feels it's something is trying to control her and that's wrong, she feels.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.360
That's very, very wrong - you have  to be an independent, free soul.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:41.040
Nobody should control you - why should anybody control you? That's a wrong thing. That means you have gone on a wrong way,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:48.560
that's true but you, you don't hear anything, you just become the master - you know everything yourself.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.140
If somebody is trying to control you, then it's a wrong path you have taken but it can be corrected.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.840
Alright, it's nice you have seen that - I'm very happy - because sometimes people come in a condition when they are in a coma

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:08.900
from all these paths. It's so difficult, you see, to raise them - it's better to see it clearly.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.140
I don't quite understand what the source is [INAUDIBLE] hands.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.960
- What's it?
- She doesn't quite understand what the source is from the hands

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.360
- Sources?
 - The source, where it's coming from?

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:36.540
It's coming from your Spirit, it's coming from your Spirit. Spirit is the source.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:43.380
Spirit is the reflection of God within us and that's the source which is the universal being within us -

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.940
that's the source.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:58.340
Christ said about it - somebody touched Him, He said, "The energy has passed into the lady who has touched Me."

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:09.100
But He was Spirit Himself so what He said is something to be seen that it happens to you also.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.800
Anything else? Yes.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:23.380
I just wonder if I could see the spiritual development [UNCLEAR - OF THE KUNDALINI?]

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.380
- What's it?
- How does one nurture the seed to ensure the development of the Kundalini?

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:35.000
Very good question, it's beautiful! If that is the anxiety My child, there's no problem.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:44.180
That's the best thing I've heard, really. Isn't it important - it's so sweet!

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.560
This time we have really nice people here, I think. It's very simple to look after the seed.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:59.600
You'll be told about it. We have luckily a center here where people have risen

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.360
from all kinds of problems and they will tell you.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.340
We have all sorts of people here who can help you, who have come to sahaja yoga,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.800
have come up to that - they'll all tell you, it's very simple and you yourself will know.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.260
Very nice question, very encouraging! Very encouraging, isn't it?

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.740
That he's, he's concerned about his development - is a very, very big thing

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:34.840
otherwise people are so self-centered and so contented with all the nonsense that they have

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.140
but to see that you have to develop and to retain it, is something great.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:46.720
It's only possible if you really value your life, if you really understand how

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.020
great it is to be a human-being - it's only possible then.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.360
It's beautiful question. Any other question?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:11.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:19.920
Is it possible to raise the Kundalini while you are attached to a lot of other desires and fears?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:28.000
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Uhh yes, it's possible - it's not difficult. Yes, it's possible, absolutely.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.020
I mean, you see, desire is a myth, is a myth.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:42.360
Kundalini rises through these centers and the desire power is on the left-hand side and the

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:50.240
right-hand side is the power of action so Kundalini rises through the center, center-most part

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:57.180
and this has nothing to do with those two which are on the sides, left on the sides.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:05.180
So there's no problem - but then what happens to your desires and then what happens to your attachments - you become a witness.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:13.900
You start witnessing your desire and then your desires change then, uh..

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:21.460
you start thinking in a different way. Like when you are not a light, you want to become a light

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:30.060
but when you have the light, what is your desire - is to give the light because your state changes.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:43.400
See the point - because the state changes, you become a different person.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:52.820
Like, if you have to, say, nourish a tree, then what do you do - you go to the roots.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.400
If you try to nourish the leaves, there's no nourishment

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:06.760
so you go to the roots and these are the roots that we have. But you must know that the sap in the tree doesn't get attached to anything.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:13.420
If it gets attached, the tree will die and the place where it is attached that will also die.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.660
So you become the sap and once you become the sap and not the leaf, you are a different personality.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.620
You see My point - the state changes

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.760
You are at a state where you give.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.900
You emit.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:49.720
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - What's it?

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.400
- I think, it's the old puzzle that we all had before we got our realization.
 - What's that?

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.400
- Now that You're so involved in all these things
 - Me?

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.400
- No, we.
- Haan
 - How can we break through this, this barrier?

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.780
That's the miracle of God!

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:16.360
Yes, these barriers are all mythical. Now, for example we think we're doing this, we're doing that - let's take some myths that we have.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:24.520
We say, now we made this big hall - alright, so what? This is something from dead to the dead - what have we done?

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.060
Can we transfer a flower into a fruit - one flower?

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:41.160
So, this is a myth coming from ego that we have done this, we can do this, we can do that - alright, that's one thing.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.660
Another myth comes from superego where we're conditioned that we are this and we are that

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:53.280
oh, we should not be expecting to be higher than this

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.200
- kind of a suppression within us, whatever is suppressed us.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:03.620
All these things can be easily broken just like that where we say that Christ died for us -

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.060
is a simple thing like that. Christ resides in this center -

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:18.200
it's not here, it's one of the windows but on the optic chiasma where the pitutary and the pineal body are there

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.680
in the center of it, this center is of Christ is.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.960
So what happens, that when Christ is awakened here, He sucks in -

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:35.120
these two pouches you see there, the blue and the yellow - one is the ego, another is the superego - and a space is created

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:43.980
and when the space is created, Kundalini goes out. We're bound by these two that's why we think we're attached

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.520
but is sucked in. If it is sucked in, the Kundalini passes out

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.240
but Christ has to be awakened here by the Kundalini itself.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.500
Alright, you understand the mechanical process, yes.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.920
Good question.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.480
You see, Kundalini rising is a tremendous  process. It rises, it

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:20.440
augments, it relaxes, it has to work out in , I mean, after all if this machine is working, there must be something,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:26.400
a lot going on inside, isn't it? And in the same way when Kundalini comes up, there lots of things happen.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:37.500
But one of the examples I've given you how our, the Sahastrara opens out because when Christ is awakened He sucks in.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.340
That's why we say that He died for our sins, He suffered for our sins.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.300
Meaning that whatever sins, so called, we have committed, so called always I say, will be sucked by Him.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.660
but still people believe that we must suffer - so go on suffering.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.440
He has already died for you, why should you suffer any more. Can you suffer more than He has suffered?

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.900
You just remain a happy person and you get your realization - finished.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.560
Now any more question?

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:30.620
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.120
Could You say a little more of the importance of this country in the matter of Spiritual affairs?

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:45.120
I think, you better read William Blake. He's said it quite a lot

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.700
but people call him mad, mean the all mad people calling him mad.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.200
If you go to lunatic asylum, all lunatics will call you mad, you see, it's like that.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:07.520
He has said it that this was to happen, He has given exact places where it will happen

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.200
He has described My house where I will live, exactly.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:22.160
He's described everything - is the most important country. For Me, imagine, I started My work

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:31.220
about 12 years back, you can say and 10 years I've spent in England, 10 years

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:39.260
but I have the least number of sahaja yogies in England, what do you say to that - isn't it sir?

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.640
The maximum are abroad, of course, in India we have thousands in the villages

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.800
and we have more in Australia, Switzerland, France.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.780
France, imagine the French [PEOPLE LAUGH]!

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:04.720
isn't it a big joke? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Yes, the French.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.980
Italians - Italians are great, traditional. They are wonderful people. Can you imagine the mayor - now this cannot happen in England -

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:28.120
uh.. the mayor just saw My photograph, a mayor, imagine - he saw My photograph, looked at it, he said, "This is Divinity".

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:37.700
He made a copy of that photograph and on 40 places he placed where it was his authority to place,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.920
on his own, paying for it, everything and he gave us a hall, beautiful hall

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.120
with a beautiful ceiling done with - I don't know what artist has done that work.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.460
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.040
Just imagine, a mayor doing that!

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:03.400
But we are not sensitive here much, I think, because we are the heart.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.520
Imagine the heart not being sensitive! We have to have the heart.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:18.760
Heart is frozen by many things. Many things have frozen our heart here, I understand that.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:28.020
I know, our love has been challenged all the time as a result, you see, we are frozen people

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:36.760
inside our heart, no doubt, I agree but when it melts, it melts very well.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:49.460
Imagine this, hundred years back, two hundred years back William Blake has said this - can you imagine?

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:57.300
Such details, even of our ashram, where it is. He's described each and every detail

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:03.200
but who reads him, who understands him, who is bothered about him?

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:12.480
There could not be any better poetry. Even Shakespeare, Wordsworth all were realized souls. Shakespeare

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:20.980
showed the futility of all nonsense we are doing - didn't he? In our

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:30.000
Sanskrit language we call him avdhoot - means a person who is beyond everything - so he showed all the futility of Romeo, Juliet, this, that, everything

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.920
and then we have Wordsworth who talks about the breeze, huh,

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.280
in their own sweet way. Even your nursery rhymes are all about sahaja yoga.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.220
'London bridge is falling down' - what does that suggest?

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.860
So many nursery rhymes are about sahaja yoga.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.200
'Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall' - Who was Humpty Dumpty - an egoist.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:09.840
You can understand that and  'To fetch a pail of water' - the seekers.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.620
' Broke his crown' - all those things are absolutely happening, you can see that.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.700
These are not ordinary nursery rhymes - they have come from the Unconscious.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.500
So many great people you have had in this country.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.820
- Should we have the experience now?
 - Should we?

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:54.560
Now, for that experience, one humble thing I've to tell you, you have to do, is to take out your shoes

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:02.100
because we have to use the Mother Earth for taking out our problems, so just take out your shoes - it helps.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.760
With this experience also people get well, their health improves

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.580
automatically, I don't have to do anything - it just happens - they get well.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.160
Now, one has to remember

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.060
that all of us have got Kundalini within ourselves

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:05.480
but everybody has got their individual problem so,

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:11.480
it cannot be guaranteed to everyone. Ultimately everybody will get it, ultimately

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:17.900
but maybe, some people may not get today, may get it tomorrow - doesn't make any difference whatsoever.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.920
Some seeds sprout today, some seeds sprout tomorrow - makes no difference.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.480
So nobody should be anxious about it, worried about it, ultimately you'll get it, all of you, I promise you that

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:37.100
but I cannot guarantee today but ultimately all of you should get your realization - that's your right.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:47.360
Secondly, you have to close your eyes and till I tell you

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:55.320
keep them closed - don't open your eyes, is important because of this center

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.360
if the eyes are open, it doesn't allow the Kundalini to rise - that's our experience.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.680
So please keep your eyes shut.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:16.320
Put your both the hands in this way, in this way comfortably

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:24.480
on your laps - not like that, not like this but like this because these are the five centers you can see,

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:32.220
five, six and seven centers on the left and the right hand side so if you put your hands like this, the energy passes through you,

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.880
it informs the Kundalini and Kundalini rises.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:47.860
The left hand suggest or is symbolically expressing your desire to get realization

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:55.460
so keep your hand like this, left hand all the time but we use the right hand for the action

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:04.040
of nourishing our different centers ourselves so that if there is any obstruction on these,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.460
then it is cleared out and we can do it, we have done it the other, yesterday

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:16.200
uh.. we had few people, of course but everyone of them got realization - the Kundalini was here -

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:23.480
just they could feel it and they were surprised, "It's a gale, Mother." I said, "Yes, it's true." So it will work out for all of you

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:30.500
only thing is, few things that I have told you, please try to remember

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:38.440
that without questioning, just do it. There's nothing serious, I'll just tell you where to put your hand and to say what

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:45.840
on different chakras, on different centers. The ultimate result will be that you start feeling first the cool breeze out of your head.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:52.260
First of all, you'll be without any thoughts. Just now it has happened to many of you - there's no thought in the mind

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.620
but then what happens that it breaks through and you start feeling the Kundalini coming out.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.780
but you must listen to Me and do what I tell you and it should happen.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:10.500
Any habits that you have of which you're tired and fed up just drop out next day

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:17.500
so you just don't worry if you have some habits, you have been doing something wrong and forget about the past, just forget.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.860
At present you are sitting with Me for your realization and you have to get it.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:29.680
Don't think this mistake I have done, that mistake I have done or this person has tortured me or that person has done to me - forget everything.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.760
Just now you get your realization - this is what you have to achieve.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:42.560
To address Me you can call Me Mataji, if you find it difficult, you can call Me Mother - whatever suits you, you can call Me by that name.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:52.400
Now, please close your eyes. [ASIDE - Can you put this off, it's too much - light?]

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:59.820
Please close your eyes. I think, put off both. I don't think we should have any more, it's finished.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.240
It's too much light.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.280
Done? Released? Agnya released?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:16.020
- Agnya is released, Vishuddhi is still a problem.
 - It's alright, started now.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.240
Hmmm. It's better now, it's too much of a Vishuddhi

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:51.120
Remove his hair, just Ekadasha. Remove his hair, I'll have a watch.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:58.060
Uh.. Warren, remove his hair. Ekadasha is there - just remove his hair.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:05.100
- If you remove his hair, he has Ekadasha
- Yes, he's, he's just told me he's paining to [UNCLEAR]

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:11.600
doing the same sort of thing by this habit but he just said

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.760
- Ekadasha
 - It's cold diet [UNCLEAR]

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:26.240
- It's alright. Is it working now? No, is it working out?
 - You can see  that's what I said Ekadasha is there
 - [UNCLEAR]

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.200
Can I just remind all of you that there is the follow-on meeting tomorrow morning

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:42.280
and there is a meeting here tomorrow evening, which you can find out the times?

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:51.940
If you look on the sheets that've been given you, you'll see the address on the back side of where our center is situated

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:59.300
and can I also request that you just be a little bit quiet while Mother is working. Thank you very much.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.040
- It won't work.
- It's a typing business

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.340
Now, is it?

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:20.840
- Well right void is released, left void more now
- Right void?
- Left void now, Mother, left void.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.460
Hmmm

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.780
- He's got it, hasn't he? No?
- He's not feeling, Mother.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:50.460
It's alright, he'll feel it but Vishuddhi is there. It's terrible, now don't feel guilty.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:57.120
Don't you feel guilty all the time, don't feel guilty.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:06.400
Haan, now better? Are you feeling on your hair? Good!

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:13.000
Sit, work. Now keep it up, alright? Now this has to relax little bit because you type too much, hmmm.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:20.260
You come to the ashram, they'll give you the oil, you rub your hands with that, rub this part, it'll become sensitive - alright? May God bless you!

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:30.820
Yeah. Thank you very much, thank you very much. Beautiful!

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:39.280
I had a very big problem this week. I was in Switzerland and I don't want to stay then someone tried to terrorize me [UNCLEAR]

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:46.840
soon overshadowing me in my aura and they still they regress me with a lot of power, an awful lot of power I've never seen

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:54.420
-  and they threatened to damage my shockers my heart
 - Where?
- In Lausanne, in Switzerland, I went there. He claimed it was fantastic.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:34:01.840
- He claimed to be a [UNCLEAR]
- In Lausanne?
- In Lausanne. I went there for three months to work and I was terrorized

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.540
- by someone with a lot of power
- What's his name?
 - I don't know. I think he was from Scientology. He

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.240
Yes, yes I know him, horrible fellow. Yes

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:16.420
It wasn't in person. It was like attached to my aura in Spirit for the live person

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:21.560
- but there's one fellow who's doing that
- and a lot of power, a lot of power
- Hmm, hmm. Oh baba
- he wouldn't leave me, he was attached to me.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:29.800
- But I was in Lausanne too
- Oh, I went to a talk in July 5th, in Lausanne. Someone gave, someone from your group. That was in the middle of it

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.640
- They were attacking my aura all around me all the time. I lost my job and I had to come back to London.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:43.100
- But this man who was attacking you
- Anh, ha - I didn't sleep for four weeks because
- you didn't see that
- I couldn't see him, I could feel his presence all the time with me

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:49.900
- For four weeks with me.
- There's one horrible fellow there in Lausanne
- Oh!
- Yes, one horrible fellow, uh..

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.960
- he had captured a woman and all sorts of thing he's doing I don't know why

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:59.100
- It's like black magic [UNCLEAR] something like that
- Terrible! Yes, he's killing people also like that

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.880
- Oh, I tried [UNCLEAR] almost have a nervous breakdown almost have
- Hmmm
 - That's what they tried and I came back

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.340
- I've only done good things like Buddhist to Christian meditation - I never was involved in anything
 - But even Buddhist is no good

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:16.420
But even Buddhist is no good. That's also you see, all these are all, all misguided people - Buddhist are very misguided.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.400
Might be from the Buddhist meditation you do get this problem.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:30.780
- I never had anything like it
- You see, these Buddhist lamas are the ones who had advised uh.. Hitler - do you know that?

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:38.780
- No.
- Yes, under there guidance only Hitler did all this
 - I couldn't get it away from my aura, like it was something with me in my aura.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:46.540
- Now do one thing. Put your hand like this and ask a question, "Mother, are You Buddha?" Ask a question, "Mother, are You Buddha?"

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:52.260
- "Mother, are You Buddha?"
- Keep your eyes open
- "Are You Buddha?"
 - Again
- "Are You Buddha?"
- Again

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.860
- "Are You Buddha?"
 - Again
- "Are You Buddha?"
- Again

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.000
- "Are You Buddha?"
 - Again
- "Are You Buddha?"
- Again
 - Are You Buddha?"

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.940
- Haan, alright.
- Yes
- Ha, ha, ha, ha

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.520
- They are all mythical people, that's why
- [UNCLEAR] had lots of power, lot of power and just
- No, no, it's all negative
- Haan

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:22.460
I know that man, I know him - horrible. One person only in Lausanne who does all these tricks - I know.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.940
- and comes out of the body, out of the body to my room
 - Hmm,

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:35.980
- I never had anything like that
 - He, he also teaches Buddhism, same fellow - but he captured a woman very badly

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:41.980
she came to Me, she told Me about him. He does all Buddhist uh.. rituals and all that - it's horrible!

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:49.340
- I know him
- Oh, I didn't know [UNCLEAR]
- Baba we had a big problem with him

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.740
- Of course that woman is now out of his clutches

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.460
- Is he alright?
- Thank You!
- Are you feeling it - the cool breeze?

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.840
Tie it up, tie it up - tying up is the best way.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.200
Have they been to someone? Have you been to some guru?

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:23.780
No, no one, sure?

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:39.140
Drugs? Same thing. Void is catching that [UNCLEAR - SIDE OR WHY?]

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.980
left void.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.160
throughout - he is also left void.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:29.460
Just uh.. call that publisher here - what's his name?

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.360
- Uh.. John Knox
- Annh, John?
- John Knox
- John Knox

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.440
Just eat this, it'll neutralize

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:50.800
It will neutralize, you see,  the effects. Come along, eat it. Come along! Let him eat it.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.640
This will - just eat it. This will neutralize the effects, on the stomach, you have.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.020
Eat it. Put it everything in the mouth - just, just there - it will neutralize, you see.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.560
Yes, John I was saying that as you see here, of course, we have got Simon and all that

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.300
but, you see, if you also take up also very positive action because

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.360
see there are intellectuals and people have to understand sahaja yoga and you have to explain to them

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:24.080
somebody has to talk on those lines. Of course, I'll tell also Simon - he's alright for realization and all that

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.500
when you have to talk to people, you see, there has to be somebody elderly otherwise they don't take you seriously

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:35.800
so I would say that whenever they have such a meeting and all that, you should try to conduct - I'll tell Simon because, you see,

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:41.540
what reports I got that in Brighton you have all little, little boys - young people.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:52.480
- I mean, Spiro is there, everybody but they look so young so if you help them, it will be better that you stand up, you see - alright?
- Yes Mother.
- May God bless you!

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.240
How is he, he's alright?

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:06.120
- Unnh?
- He smoked four cigars, he had four cigars

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:14.780
- He smoked four cigars, Mother, today.
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Alright, don't feel guilty. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:22.680
Haan, better now, see - are you feeling the cool breeze?

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.060
Feeling the cool breeze now? Good!

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.640
You have this thing to eat to neutralize your cigars - let's have it.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.860
- Just to neutralize your cigars
- Thank You!
- Alright, just put it in the mouth. Now

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.980
How is this gentleman?

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.900
- Kundalini has risen
- Good!
- during the program, right now. Wait,

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.880
- What about this one? This lady, is she alright?

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.320
How are you, are you alright now?

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.800
- Whom did you go to?
- Hmmm?
- Whom did you go to?
- [UNCLEAR - SCIENTOLOGY?]
- Oh!

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:17.520
- Oh!
- I think I was meant to
- Hmmm?
- I think I was meant to [UNCLEAR] mentally

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.640
- I didn't follow
- She thinks she was meant to go to Scientology and then she was mentally Scientology.

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:32.520
Really I tell you the damage you have. Scientology is a one of the worst damages I've ever seen, I must confess

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:41.400
This is the first time we're giving realization to people who have been to Scientology otherwise we used to say no. Believe Me, it was

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:46.340
such a damage, I don't know what [UNCLEAR - SPIRIT?] - such a damage, I must say!

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:57.140
- You'll be alright.
- I feel like [UNCLEAR] I've learnt to laugh, I've learnt to [UNCLEAR]
- That's good, very nice.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.160
- You see, once you come out of it, you can be very great

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.260
- You see, you have to come out of it fully
- Yes
 - That's what they'll tell you how to do it

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:14.000
- Hello! How are you, how did you feel?
- I didn't quite understand [INAUDIBLE]
- Really, you didn't quite understand? [UNCLEAR - WHY OR WHAT?]

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:21.480
- You, you didn't feel the cool breeze?
- I thought I did, I wasn't sure. [UNCLEAR] relaxing

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:30.000
- Is it? Now, what about you never felt any cool breeze you mean to say?
- I felt the heat coming out but I [UNCLEAR]
- Heat?

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:36.740
Hmmm, there's lot of heat inside has to come out. There's a hole I've made in the head, you see,

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.660
- so the heat is coming out. Let the heat go away, you'll feel the cool breeze.
- I'm not [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:47.560
- Did you
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:54.220
It was, that's good, it's the beginning, isn't it? It's very subtle. We have to go little further with it, isn't it?

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:58.760
- [UNCLEAR]
- Very simple

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:09.160
- Better you [UNCLEAR]. She's alright too but she's a liver patient, little bit liver trouble you have

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.720
- that's why the heat.
- Liver trouble?
- Liver
- Liver trouble, have I?

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:20.580
Liver is little bit over-activated, that's why you felt the heat but you'll be alright - now you'll feel the cool breeze, let's see.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:30.680
- Yes, I do.
- Now let's see there
- There is.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:39.940
Now, ladies like you should take more interest because these are all young people

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:47.580
and you can work it out better, act more, guide, guide them better than these little young boys - isn't it?

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:55.620
You should come and help, I request you. You better come, you'll be of such a help

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.820
and you have to look after your children - they're taking to drugs and all this

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:07.100
Isn't it all waste and now AIDS is coming - you have to guide them.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.480
No more to sit at home and do something.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:20.960
You should come. This, this is the greatest business. You come on the Saturdays, Sundays - meet them, guide them

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:25.600
I'll be very thankful to you - alright. May God bless you!

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.000
Alright, thank You!

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.840
Yes, well

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:41.780
- What's the matter?
- I'm very grateful for Your time anyway and

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:48.800
- I honestly believe, You're trying to give me something I couldn't get it and

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.120
- What's the problem on your neck?
- I just [UNCLEAR] so

00:44:54.620 --> 00:45:01.440
uh.. I just [UNCLEAR] the bone three months ago and [UNCLEAR]

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:08.760
- Could that be broken [UNCLEAR]?
- Yes of course, of course so I must cure you. Take it out, I'll put that right

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:15.440
- Take it out, this one.
- It's got a thin [UNCLEAR]
- No, I'll take it out. What it's a cotton?

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:21.760
- Hmmm
- That's a doctor behind you
- this is a , [UNCLEAR] BONE

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:27.020
- that is quite easy.
- Remember there's a poultice on it. Someone suggested putting poultice on it.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:32.560
- But I didn't mean that. I just meant it's that
- I know, I know. Yes, that does block, that does block.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:40.160
See, first the Mother must first give you physical health that's important for Mother, isn't it, that children should be alright physically

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.140
Hmmm, [UNCLEAR] this dislocation has to go,

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:51.620
- that's very important.
- Hmmm, wish it could!
- It will, hundred percent.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:46:00.880
- But I didn't come
- I know, I know that My child you didn't come
- No, I didn't
- but, but I, I feel as a Mother you should be alright first

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.920
then talk of God - alright?

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:13.340
- Hmmm, let it work
- [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:21.180
- Don't feel guilty - that's your problem
- No, I don't, not anymore

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:26.640
- I used to - not anymore, not allowing that

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:36.000
- Haan. Hello Sara, how are you?

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.620
How is everything working out?

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:48.960
- I do want [UNCLEAR] what You were trying to give me [UNCLEAR]

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.520
It is working out - just see on her head - has she got it?

00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.820
- Warm
- It's coming, it's coming up - don't you worry.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:07.760
- I know You're trying to give
- Yes and you'll take it too

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:13.200
- [UNCLEAR - ARRANGE?]
- I'll arrange, I'll arrange that for you. Ha, ha, haan, now see.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:18.820
Now, can you sit here, this side, just this side please. Now it's alright - now

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.400
- [UNCLEAR - KUNDALINI?] is coming, Mother

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.980
- Haan!
- Left Vishuddhi is very much there

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:54.340
Just go on saying, "Mother, I'm not guilty." Just - Hello, how are you David? Haan

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.460
You're alright? Take a light.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:11.340
- What about this gentleman - Ross?
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Haan?
- His hands are numb, Mother.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.800
- His, his -UNCLEAR - HIS HANDS ARE NUMB?]
- What's up?
- His hands are numb, Mother

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:22.380
- He has a, he has vibrations but his hands are numb
 - But why are they numb?

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:30.860
- He must have done
 - Has he been to some guru or someone? What work you do?
- An engineer work.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:35.540
Very simple question; Ask about engineering

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.580
This is the Divine engineering. Put both the hands towards Me and ask the question.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:56.480
- [UNCLEAR]
- Unnh?
- This is still [UNCLEAR]
- It's better now
- Yes

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:04.920
Haan! Put both the hands like this and ask the question. Hmmm

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:21.440
Alright? That's the answer - this is Divine engineering.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.200
Haan, done. Close your eyes. Tie it up, tie it up.

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:37.000
There is right heart and Agnya, Mother.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.940
- Right heart
- Right heart and Agnya
- Right?
- Yes, Mother.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:48.840
Forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive. Forgive your father - alright?

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.940
Forgive your father. Haan!

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:14.640
- Now, alright?
- Still [UNCLEAR]
- Still?

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:22.700
- But the cool is coming out.
- Oh, yes Mother.
- Alright, then it's alright. You people are the such perfectionists, I tell you [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:28.480
- Now, you feeling the cool breeze in the hand, madam?
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, that's it, you've got it.

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:33.180
Now see your neck, move it and see, is it moving? Move it on the sides.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.080
- Alright? Is it paining now?
- [UNCLEAR - YEAH?]
-  Move it to the left and right

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.940
- Is it paining?
- Yeah.
- Alright
 - No
- It doesn't pain?
- Little bit

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:50.140
Paining? Where is it paining now? It's there so the dislocation is here

00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.780
Hmmm

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:12.060
Alright? Neeche gaya? This is all engineering

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:19.140
- Haan!
- [UNCLEAR]
- Beg your pardon?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:26.860
- What's he saying?
 - What did You say to give my problem?
- Because you have not forgiven

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.700
Isn't it correct?

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:37.020
[UNCLEAR]

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.660
[UNCLEAR] it's very strange, I mean, this morning she was saying she didn't blame me for anything.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.680
- [UNCLEAR]
- Nothing is strange, you see, I have to know about you. If I love you, I must know you, isn't it?

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:56.440
Only through My love I know what your problems are

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:02.960
because I'm the Mother. I've to know your problems - there's nothing strange about it. Haan!

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:09.980
Haan, Mother's love is so powerful, isn't it? Haan!

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:21.200
She has a problem. Better!

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.700
All her head is pulsating

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:42.380
Now see your pain is it better, My child, just see.

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:51.580
Less now, much less.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:03.340
You are enjoying them and they are enjoying you wonderfully - you'll go on like this forever, I think. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:10.960
Actually they are enjoying you, you see, so they're not moving out - they're just enjoying you taking your vibra.... - isn't it wonderful?

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.540
The first time we start enjoying other human-beings.

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:22.060
How is this gentleman? He has a Hamsa little bit.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:29.040
Do you get sinus trouble sometimes - no pain there?

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:40.720
He has a Hamsa - stops there. Hmmm, now you're alright - pain?

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:48.780
- No.
- Gone?
- [UNCLEAR]
- Now see, is there a pain now? Move your

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.260
- Is there a pain?
- No [UNCLEAR]
- Done, gone for, everything gone. Alright, perfectly alright.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.860
She's - Aha, you're alright. Yes, sit down, sit down.

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:09.500
- I didn't get anything but thank You for everything but
- I'll work it out
- I've been talking to one of your

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:16.100
- [UNCLEAR - A MAID ?] is there, she said, I told her, I came to know because of an experience sign
- Hmm

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:20.920
- about a long while ago thirty-eight
- Unnh?
- a long while ago, thirty-eight
-

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:28.420
I had [UNCLEAR]

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:35.100
and I was lying in the bed [UNCLEAR] all these buckles and all these

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:43.120
I couldn't see him coming [UNCLEAR] and then the next thing he was on the ceiling. I

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:51.220
[UNCLEAR]

00:54:52.140 --> 00:55:00.240
and the most beautiful music was being played and such a thing piece was beautiful

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:06.040
- You felt separated?
- Oh yes I was! I was up there and I was just [UNCLEAR]

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:13.820
- [UNCLEAR]  but I was up there and I felt some peace in myself and contented

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:18.440
- Did you go to anyone like that, into any Spiritualist or any?
- No, no.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:26.540
- To no one?
- No, no and then I was just about to follow these people [UNCLEAR] came back

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:33.860
and she came out of the side and she shook my hand and shook my [UNCLEAR]

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:41.320
and before [UNCLEAR] I came

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:49.100
but I had to get back in through heel and I had to slide in [UNCLEAR]  and I had to put my toes in

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:56.700
- Annh?
- to put my toes in where they belong to, my legs and [UNCLEAR]

00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:03.480
- they had come back then through here I just saw hiding [UNCLEAR]

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:10.800
because it was so beautiful out there and then [UNCLEAR] as I was at the

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:19.020
- lake canal train
- Hmm
- and I didn't want to come back [UNCLEAR]

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:31.300
- I've never experienced any thing [UNCLEAR] before
- That's the Spirit; You become the Spirit but your body should contain it, you should not get out of it,

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:36.360
- that's not a good thing
- Hmmm
- If it takes you out then there's something else that's working it out
- Hmmm

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:41.940
- You, you have to feel it within yourself with your body intact, don't have to leave your body.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:48.260
Leave your body then it's not alright but you have to be there - it's very dangerous also to leave the body. Sometimes

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:54.780
you may lose it completely so you have to be there all the time. Now

00:56:55.180 --> 00:57:01.540
- [UNCLEAR] All the left side is
- Annh?
- all the left, all the left side is

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:10.600
- Now you say you didn't go to any body like that, you didn't go see any
- No
- transwoman and - no sure?
-  No
- You remember that?

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.580
- I've been to a saint to meet him
- Annh?
- A spiritualist saint
- That's it!

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:21.380
That's it! Is the Spiritualists; You see the spirits. They do these tricks.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:28.840
- I think, your spirit is great, no doubt but to separate you from yourself
- [UNCLEAR - THIS WAS 30 YEARS?]
- Yes, that's what they have done.

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:37.440
- So you have to work it out a little bit to get rid of it because what you have to feel this beauty within yourself, in your body, in your consciousness.
- Hmmm

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:45.440
- You understand My point?
- Hmm, hmm.
- Alright. So for that, it's very simple is they'll tell you what is to be done. You have a left-side problem and they'll correct it for you

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:53.280
That's very also not good because if you have the left-side problem, you might again fall into the same trap so better get it corrected.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:59.540
- Alright? They'll do it for you, you come and see them. Get it corrected - it's very important for you - alright?
- Yeah.

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.260
- God bless you!
- Thank You!
- Is she alright?

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:11.420
- Again left side.
- It's [UNCLEAR] Mother. The left-side and [UNCLEAR]
- Alright.
- So she can work it out if she has to work it out.

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:17.580
- Absolutely.
- I'll tell somebody about you. Who's there? Annh

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:25.660
- You see, this la... -  what's your name please? Annh?
- Irelene
- Irelene.

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:33.700
This lady has been to Spiritualist [UNCLEAR], you see, and her body was separated from her soul once. You see, it's a dangerous thing so, what you have to do is to

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:41.980
put her left to the photograph, right outside on the Mother Earth - give her a light and all that and get her alright because left-side is absolutely burnt

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:49.940
- and is dangerous, alright. Irelene, they'll look after you - look after yourself
- Thank You!
- Alright? May God bless you! Look after yourself.

00:58:52.200 --> 00:59:00.220
- You take her address - it's just burning, just be there. Just rub it
- Yes, ooh, ooh, ooh [UNCLEAR]
- Haan

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:05.880
- [UNCLEAR] Carolene
- How do you do?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:13.180
-  Did she get it?
- Yes, [UNCLEAR]

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.980
- I'm not sure, maybe. [UNCLEAR] sure I did.
- Hmm

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:27.560
- What work does she do?
- [UNCLEAR]
- She is a medical student

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:42.780
You ask Me a question. Say, "Mother, are You the source of all the medical science?" Ask a question.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:48.600
- "Mother, are You source of all medical science?"
- Again.
- "Mother, are You the source of all medical science?"

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:52.780
- Again.
- "Mother, are You the source of all medical science?"

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.180
Feeling it?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.220
- [UNCLEAR - I DO?]
- That's the answer.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:13.420
[ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Like this engineer sitting here, he had to ask, "Mother, are You the engineer of all the engineers?"

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:19.780
He got it, quite surprised because I look too simple to be that. Alright, May God bless you!

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:27.900
She's alright - is the barrier not the - medical science, this science, that science - barrier

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:36.460
ha, ha - so, absolutely burning. How are you? What's the matter?

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:44.680
- [UNCLEAR]
- Oh, what is it?
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What's the problem?

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:51.700
- I had a virus [UNCLEAR]

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.000
- Alright, sit down on the chair. Get him a chair.
- I'll sit [UNCLEAR]
- No, you sit on the chair. You're alright. Sit comfortably facing Me,

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:07.220
facing Me. Now, do one thing. Take the light behind him. What time, when was this, when did it happen?

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.460
- What's the result?
- [UNCLEAR]
- You got an attack
- Yeah

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.980
- Virus infection?
- Think so virus
- Alright, have it.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:39.340
Put both the hands towards Me. This shakes more than that. Put the left like that.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:45.660
The left like this. Right towards Me and left like this, yes. Put the right

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.940
Just forgive, forgive, forgive everyone.
