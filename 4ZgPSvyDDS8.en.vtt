00:09:33.202 --> 00:09:48.371
It is such a honor for all of us to pay this
homage to the great poet, printer and a prophet

00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:50.591
that was William Blake.

00:09:50.591 --> 00:10:04.281
When I first came to England, they have been
telling Me that England is a place of scholarship

00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:15.031
and you can see lots of museums and exhibitions
and suddenly I told the Sahaja yogis that

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:22.701
I would like to go and see Tate Gallery for
William Blake's paintings.

00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:28.851
They were surprised because I seldom go to
any one of them, specially the libraries and

00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:36.411
the books.

00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:49.521
And when I went there, I saw this great poet,
this great personality, pouring out His heart

00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:57.440
with such concern, with such honesty, with
such understanding and perception of the Divine

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:06.801
to the people of England, to understand the
great powers of Divinity.

00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:17.080
But to My surprise there were some funny people;
they had brought some magnifying glasses and

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:23.421
they were looking at the drawings and were
watching the private parts of people.

00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:32.001
I said, " Look at these wretched, absolutely
baser people, who cannot see the sublime,

00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:40.380
the highest, which He wanted to paint," and
they were taking photographs.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:50.211
I was surprised the way people reacted and
then I realized how tormented He must have

00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:58.670
been in His lifetime to live with such people,
who have no sense of Divine.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:05.091
He must have cried in the wilderness; He must
have wept; He could not have been accepted,

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.371
it's impossible.

00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:14.041
Such low level minds cannot accept something
that's sublime and great and My heart bled

00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:15.371
with pain.

00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:16.700
Oh God!

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:24.921
Why did He take His birth in a place like
this?

00:12:24.921 --> 00:12:30.230
To torment Himself, to torture Himself, saying
something which cannot be accepted.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.250
But it's not so.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:44.740
I knew who He was, what He is doing, why He
was here.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:51.100
We do not know about Him much, because from
the books you can't understand who He could

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.630
have been.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:58.920
He was an Incarnation., of Bhairavanath.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:09.050
That's whom you call the St. Michael, or St.
George, who is as you know the Saint - Angel

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.651
of England.

00:13:12.651 --> 00:13:23.620
That's why He had to incarnate and for Him,
this was His role, to talk about Divine in

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:29.550
a open, fearless manner.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:35.461
He had to use symbolic language, He had to
use.

00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:45.111
It's not difficult to understand Him at all;
if you are a realized soul, you'll read through

00:13:45.111 --> 00:13:52.111
it, sometimes laughing, sometimes weeping,
enjoying the whole drama, what He has tried

00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:53.111
to explain.

00:13:53.111 --> 00:14:04.771
When I read Him I am amazed at His sense of
humor; how He openly comes out with such remarks.

00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:17.301
I feel He is like Markandeya in India, or
Kabir Dass in India, who slashed the whole

00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:25.450
society with their sword all the time to see
that they are brought to the proper shape,

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.031
without fear.

00:14:27.031 --> 00:14:40.841
But so gentle, if you read the Song of the
Thel, it's so gentle; and all of them who

00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:55.681
were Him perhaps or of the same style, extremely
open, straightforward, you can say even blatant

00:14:55.681 --> 00:15:01.931
and extremely gentle.

00:15:01.931 --> 00:15:10.801
The vision of Christ, that He has described,
is the one which He sees through His own enlightened

00:15:10.801 --> 00:15:23.001
eyes and He sees that the vision is completely
distorted, is the opposite of what Christ

00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:24.241
was.

00:15:24.241 --> 00:15:26.801
I also felt the same way.

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:33.121
I took My birth in a Protestant, Christian
family and I was shocked the way the Christians

00:15:33.121 --> 00:15:34.121
were.

00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:36.690
I said " Are these the Christians?"

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:42.581
Now the point He brings forth is very clear
cut, you can understand, that in the mannerism

00:15:42.581 --> 00:15:48.961
if you are gentle, " I'm sorry" , "I'm afraid"
, " I doubt."

00:15:48.961 --> 00:15:50.980
Just look at that.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.901
It's very commonly we use this language.

00:15:54.901 --> 00:16:00.420
He says that Christ was not a gentleman of
that kind.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:10.070
I also say I'm not seeking election, I'm not
here to please you, but I am here to make

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:23.970
you please yourself; to enjoy yourself, to
have your all wealth, enjoyed, manifested.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:31.431
That is how He also put the vision of Christ
before you, that He was not a gentle man,

00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:40.850
who would go around and be extremely gentle
to people and nice to them, superficially,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:52.961
only the mannerism of it, but He would be
so gentle with the people who are lowly.

00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:59.111
He created Divinity out of fishermen, who
were ordinary people, uneducated, absolutely

00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:06.500
we can say, people who were one of the lowest
in the strata of society.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.040
He picked them up and made them Divine.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.151
He didn't go to the ministers and the prime
ministers and the governors.

00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:21.090
He did not.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:28.991
When you see all the great people who are
supposed to be looking after the religion

00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:34.590
part of it, they are busy only with governors
and they are only busy with the kings and

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.480
the queens; who must go and bow to them.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.600
They are politically activated people.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.461
How can a Divine person get into this mess
of politics which human beings have created?

00:17:48.461 --> 00:17:53.070
But we don't understand it, because we try
to rationalize everything and thank God He's

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:59.891
the one who talked against rationality; and
against all the intellectual ideas of putting

00:17:59.891 --> 00:18:07.171
down Christ to the mere level of a human being,
because He was Himself Divine and He could

00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:11.441
understand Christ.

00:18:11.441 --> 00:18:21.221
He was so much pestered and actually persecuted
that He used to get depression sometimes and

00:18:21.221 --> 00:18:29.610
He had problems of money, problems of convincing
His brother and sister, everybody trying to

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.391
make Him feel uneasy.

00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:40.490
Such a fine soul came on this earth to talk
of Jerusalem.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.141
What did He mean by Jerusalem?

00:18:44.141 --> 00:18:45.141
What is Jerusalem?

00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:49.731
We go to Jerusalem for pilgrimage.

00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:50.731
Why?

00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:52.661
Because Christ was born there.

00:18:52.661 --> 00:18:57.351
England will become Jerusalem when Christ
will be born here.

00:18:57.351 --> 00:19:02.911
But how many of English people today care
for the spirit?

00:19:02.911 --> 00:19:09.341
English language itself is such a funny one,
that we use the word spirit for drinking,

00:19:09.341 --> 00:19:18.810
the spirit that you call alcohol; spirit for
the dead souls, which hang around, many more

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:28.371
here, and spirit for the atma, the spirit.

00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:35.931
When He came on this earth, the industrial
revolution had not taken its respite.

00:19:35.931 --> 00:19:42.571
People were still entering into those 'mills'
as he calls them and He saw the scribes how

00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:46.601
they were behaving and He saw the whole myth
of religion.

00:19:46.601 --> 00:19:52.441
He does not know that all the religions were
doing the same nonsense everywhere, not only

00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:53.441
Christianity.

00:19:53.441 --> 00:20:00.831
You go to any other country and see every
religion is the same style of a nonsense,

00:20:00.831 --> 00:20:06.771
which is opposite of what the prophets told
them, of what the incarnations told them,

00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:11.411
of what all the great sages told them.

00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:19.441
This is not only about Christianity, but still
nobody can forgive it, because Christianity

00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:26.711
has a special fervor, has a special role,
has a special meaning, that's what He's tried

00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:35.711
to also say, that Moses came on this earth
to lay down the code of conduct, morality,

00:20:35.711 --> 00:20:45.170
the moral thing, and also He describes Milton
as a person who describes a Deity who is above

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.601
everything, a puritanical Deity.

00:20:48.601 --> 00:20:54.581
But He describes the Divine humanity.

00:20:54.581 --> 00:21:02.120
Also He describes the Christ who came on this
earth for the emancipation of human beings;

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.491
not to tell them, "Don't do this and don't
do that."

00:21:04.491 --> 00:21:09.502
That was all right at the time of Moses in
the beginning of it, the code of it, and He

00:21:09.502 --> 00:21:17.791
calls it a 'moral' Christianity, meaning 'immoral'
must be, because if you force someone, into

00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:23.490
something and pass such laws and regulations
at this time, modern times, it's going to

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:28.531
be impossible for human beings to follow and
they'll fall into some other traps.

00:21:28.531 --> 00:21:37.161
Strict rules of anything, imposed on people
who are not realized souls, can push them

00:21:37.161 --> 00:21:42.870
into some sort of problems, they can become
criminals, they can become violent as a reaction

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:50.021
and we see the reaction today acting, that
the hypocrisy of the whole thing is exposed.

00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:54.461
Like in India or anywhere else, they will
say, "You should not be attached to money,

00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:59.041
give the money to the church, to the temple,
to the mosque, to all the people to enjoy

00:21:59.041 --> 00:22:00.550
it."

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:12.430
The kind of life people led in those days
in the name of God, was no model for anyone

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.001
and that's how poets like Him were born again
and again.

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:22.170
I would say that in Lebanon a great poet,
like Kahlil Gibran, was born, and then in

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:30.481
India we had so many such poets, who just
lashed the society and lashed all these ideas

00:22:30.481 --> 00:22:36.480
of the intellectuals, the ideas of the religions,
the ones who were trying to curb them.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.651
Because there was no genuineness, there was
no sincerity.

00:22:40.651 --> 00:22:47.850
If we are honest people, we really mean it,
then let us face it and see for ourselves

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.691
what we have to achieve.

00:22:51.691 --> 00:22:58.581
So that is how He came as a poet, a remarkable
poet, the way He rhymes it and the sense of

00:22:58.581 --> 00:23:06.671
humor He has and the way He unfolds the beauty
of words as any poet should do.

00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:15.531
In Sanskrit it is said, vakyam rasatmakam
kavyam - poetry is full of rasats; rasats

00:23:15.531 --> 00:23:22.170
means the essences, the explosion of essences
through words.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:29.761
If it could be done, then the magic of it
is called as poetry and that's what you find

00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:31.180
in Blake.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:37.641
Such a great poet; poetry is only great when
it talks of the Divine and when it talks of

00:23:37.641 --> 00:23:40.441
the baser things, takes you to the baser things.

00:23:40.441 --> 00:23:47.391
The other day I heard one Australian poet
and I was amazed at his bathroom singing,

00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:54.610
it was horrible; how can you call it a poetry
which sings of baser things of life, which

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.691
takes you to the baser things and pleasures?

00:23:57.691 --> 00:24:04.001
But He has very clearly, if you can understand
Him, has said, "What are these books for?

00:24:04.001 --> 00:24:07.921
This is to collect money out of them."

00:24:07.921 --> 00:24:10.161
Now how do you collect money?

00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:19.881
By playing on the weaknesses of the people,
pampering their ego, pampering their greed.

00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:24.990
All these things, if you can do, you can very
nicely befool them and they feel very happy

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.860
and nice, that oh what a book it is.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.230
As we have had great writers also in this
country.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:35.800
I would say Shakespeare was a great evolved
soul, but the deterioration you see later

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.110
on, like people like Hemingway and all those
coming up.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.701
I don't know how, after Somerset Maugham and
all that, suddenly these horrible Hemingway

00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:47.261
people coming up and people buying their books
like hot cakes.

00:24:47.261 --> 00:24:53.781
We've lost all our moorings, we have lost
all our roots, but one thing good has happened

00:24:53.781 --> 00:25:03.160
out of this, leading the way of Freud, making
him Christ; all that has led to problems and

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:11.920
people now realize, now realize, that's why
the prophecy was there, that's why He was

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920
a Prophet.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.401
He warned people of what is going to happen,
but who is bothered?

00:25:17.401 --> 00:25:21.050
He was treated as an insane personality.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:28.281
If you go to the lunatic asylum, everybody
will think you are insane, that's the way

00:25:28.281 --> 00:25:31.560
lunatics look at a sane personality.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.730
His wisdom was condemned.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:42.241
People thought that He is getting all these
hallucinations, He's talking out of His hat,

00:25:42.241 --> 00:25:48.230
because they have no brains to understand,
they have no enlightenment, they have no perception,

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.211
that's why they treated Him that way.

00:25:51.211 --> 00:25:56.011
Now He is dead, of course they're selling
His books, making big money; selling His plates,

00:25:56.011 --> 00:26:01.050
what He painted, but when He lived, nobody
bothered.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:05.831
And now they can use Him the way they like.

00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:12.461
I've met some very funny people here, in this
respect, the way they have shown great interest

00:26:12.461 --> 00:26:17.641
in Blake in saying that, "He says that a naked
woman is the best."

00:26:17.641 --> 00:26:18.641
I said, "Where?

00:26:18.641 --> 00:26:22.191
How could He say such a thing?

00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:23.191
He was innocent."

00:26:23.191 --> 00:26:26.751
Now we do not understand what His is innocence
also.

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:33.501
Just like Markandeya describing His mother,
her breast and everything, like a little child.

00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:41.311
A child doesn't see, sex in a naked body,
he does not see.

00:26:41.311 --> 00:26:43.971
And the beauty of a woman He describes.

00:26:43.971 --> 00:26:47.031
That means all women are walking nude, everywhere,
now.

00:26:47.031 --> 00:26:53.811
Are you exciting the innocence of people,
or are you exciting the baser self of the

00:26:53.811 --> 00:26:54.811
people?

00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:59.451
We have to be natural, are you natural?

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:09.011
All these perversions and all these diversifications
has come because man does not have a simple

00:27:09.011 --> 00:27:11.631
mind, he's a crooked person.

00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:14.791
This 'crookery' has to go from the mind.

00:27:14.791 --> 00:27:21.561
That is important; but if I say that , I'm
not doing My job here, I know that.

00:27:21.561 --> 00:27:27.451
I know for definite that is not the way it
is going to work out.

00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:33.181
That's why Christ, the One who said, "Forgive,
forgive them."

00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:41.731
Otherwise how can God meet man, with this
'crookery', with all this kind of cunning,

00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:46.041
how can God reach man without forgiveness?

00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:49.541
He cannot reach man if he listens to Moses,
can He?

00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:50.831
He cannot.

00:27:50.831 --> 00:27:58.901
If He has to come to human beings, He has
to forgive and that's what is in Sahaja Yoga

00:27:58.901 --> 00:28:00.501
in the beginning.

00:28:00.501 --> 00:28:06.901
We tell, you must forgive everyone, you forgive
yourself, don't feel guilty.

00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:12.551
Now in Christianity just the opposite has
been done, let us face it and know for yourself

00:28:12.551 --> 00:28:15.421
that you have to go and confess to the priest.

00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:21.561
The priest also gets mad with your confession,
you are already mad.

00:28:21.561 --> 00:28:24.371
What is there to confess in the ocean of forgiveness?

00:28:24.371 --> 00:28:26.601
It just dissolves.

00:28:26.601 --> 00:28:31.711
What a message Christ gave us that the greatest
weapon we have got is to forgive others and

00:28:31.711 --> 00:28:39.331
forgive ourselves because God forgives us
and this is the message we have to know, that

00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:41.321
we have to forgive ourselves.

00:28:41.321 --> 00:28:48.671
Instead of that, for all that we do wrong,
all that we try to do against our spirit,

00:28:48.671 --> 00:28:54.171
we feel guilty and moreover if the teachings
are such, that "you better feel guilty", all

00:28:54.171 --> 00:28:59.931
the time what we are doing is to feel guilty
and catch on this chakra on the Left Vishuddhi,

00:28:59.931 --> 00:29:08.081
to such an extent, that in the West wherever
I go I tell them, first of all, you just say

00:29:08.081 --> 00:29:15.161
one mantra, "Mother, I am not guilty."

00:29:15.161 --> 00:29:17.741
Take it out of you, who are you to feel guilty?

00:29:17.741 --> 00:29:24.951
When God loves you so much, He has made you
the epitome of evolution, you are at the highest

00:29:24.951 --> 00:29:28.253
point, why should you judge yourself and feel
guilty?

00:29:28.253 --> 00:29:32.461
Is He not capable of forgiving you?

00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:37.871
Have you no faith in His ocean of love?

00:29:37.871 --> 00:29:46.051
But this is the basics of the mistakes that
are committed in the name of Christ.

00:29:46.051 --> 00:29:52.951
I'm telling to the priests, now who is a priest
here, coming from theological college, can

00:29:52.951 --> 00:29:56.181
you learn about Divinity in the theological
college?

00:29:56.181 --> 00:29:59.781
Did Christ go to any theological college?

00:29:59.781 --> 00:30:05.641
How did He get it, how did He get the knowledge
- through enlightenment, enlightenment has

00:30:05.641 --> 00:30:06.641
to be there.

00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:14.461
The way He has clearly stated everything,
nobody liked it, because of vested interest.

00:30:14.461 --> 00:30:16.501
Everybody has vested interest.

00:30:16.501 --> 00:30:21.221
Nobody is sincere, honest, and they want to
exploit others to make money.

00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:24.341
You cannot make money in the name of God.

00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:27.001
Is sin.

00:30:27.001 --> 00:30:29.961
Such people can never enter into the kingdom
of God.

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:35.531
That's why Christ has said, "You'll be calling
Me, Christ, Christ, I won't recognize you."

00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:38.021
That's a fact.

00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:45.141
So if you have to be a truthful person, just
a truthful person, do not feel guilty about

00:30:45.141 --> 00:30:46.141
it.

00:30:46.141 --> 00:30:48.611
Do not feel you have committed sin.

00:30:48.611 --> 00:30:53.291
There's a little story in India that one missionary
came to a village in India.

00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:59.931
Indian people are in the villages very simple,
you know, they are not so sophisticated.

00:30:59.931 --> 00:31:05.371
So when he was going, they praised him a lot,
"Sir, we are thankful to you that you have

00:31:05.371 --> 00:31:08.981
told us what is sin and that we are sinners."

00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:15.041
They didn't know they were sinning.

00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:23.041
And this is one of the things that Blake brought
forth for us to show that Christ was a person

00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:26.541
who brought a new message over Moses.

00:31:26.541 --> 00:31:31.351
Of course Moses was needed at the time when
Jews had to come up, that was the time they

00:31:31.351 --> 00:31:36.731
needed it and He brought these shariat laws;
it was Moses who started but Muslims are following

00:31:36.731 --> 00:31:38.441
them.

00:31:38.441 --> 00:31:49.001
Now when today we are in this twentieth century,
sitting down here, we have to see what is

00:31:49.001 --> 00:31:52.821
the prophecy of this great man, William Blake.

00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:59.221
Can you imagine, His birthday was in this
month, Guru Nanaka's birthday in this month,

00:31:59.221 --> 00:32:10.091
Mohammed Sahib's birthday on this month, all
these great people were born on this month.

00:32:10.091 --> 00:32:17.181
Now, this month also we celebrated the Diwali.

00:32:17.181 --> 00:32:28.381
Such a great month is this one and in this
month those who are born have to be great

00:32:28.381 --> 00:32:32.481
people.

00:32:32.481 --> 00:32:47.971
In the whole understanding of Blake, I find
a single lonely man, plowing this land with

00:32:47.971 --> 00:32:52.741
the seeds of wisdom.

00:32:52.741 --> 00:33:02.191
I'm here just to reap it; He's the one who
planted, watered, made ready by Shakespeare,

00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:09.031
you can say; you have had many great poets
here, Wordsworth another one who really is

00:33:09.031 --> 00:33:11.681
enchanting and beautiful.

00:33:11.681 --> 00:33:18.511
I think Wordsworth must have seen the fate
of William Blake and he said better describe

00:33:18.511 --> 00:33:23.811
the nature, forget about human beings; he
must have thought of it, thinking it to be

00:33:23.811 --> 00:33:29.461
an incorrigible land where He cannot sow anything.

00:33:29.461 --> 00:33:47.181
But whatever it is, what Blake has done is
to give you a new vision and a new idea, because

00:33:47.181 --> 00:34:02.161
in the West, Christ has been shrunk to a position
of someone who was just a human being and

00:34:02.161 --> 00:34:06.911
now, when you hear the way people describe
Him, I'm amazed.

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:12.401
From where did they get this vision?

00:34:12.401 --> 00:34:15.831
Have they got eyes or are they blind to talk
like this about Him?

00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:21.151
I hear the bishops talking like that, all
your archbishops talking like that.

00:34:21.151 --> 00:34:25.891
Have they no fear of God?

00:34:25.891 --> 00:34:29.611
What's going to happen to this country if
you talk about Christ like that?

00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:37.311
And you are going to have now pictures and
films showing Him to be a unrighteous personality,

00:34:37.311 --> 00:34:42.001
showing His Mother naked.

00:34:42.001 --> 00:34:43.361
No respect.

00:34:43.361 --> 00:34:49.201
Even Blake, I don't know if you have noticed
it, He paints human beings naked all right,

00:34:49.201 --> 00:34:51.011
but not gods.

00:34:51.011 --> 00:34:58.281
Christ He never painted, He never paints them
that way, the respect.

00:34:58.281 --> 00:35:06.141
While we, the great intellectuals of modern
times are trying all these tricks, just to

00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:09.951
bring forth the wrath of God upon ourselves.

00:35:09.951 --> 00:35:12.931
The second point about Him was that He was
a printer.

00:35:12.931 --> 00:35:15.021
We should think why did He become a printer?

00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:16.721
Why Blake took to printing?

00:35:16.721 --> 00:35:25.291
He has described Himself the hell where the
books were created and how He has described,

00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:30.941
how at every chakra we created a devil and
put them in the libraries.

00:35:30.941 --> 00:35:35.591
I'm ... that's why against the books very
much, Myself.

00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:37.051
But why did He become a printer?

00:35:37.051 --> 00:35:41.251
It's very important to know and why He wrote
so much about printing.

00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:45.191
We see the media today.

00:35:45.191 --> 00:35:49.291
The media, that's the devil He described.

00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:55.411
The media is the one has ruined you completely
believe Me - just to make money out of you,

00:35:55.411 --> 00:36:01.281
playing upon your weaknesses, making your
children and you weaker and weaker, the society

00:36:01.281 --> 00:36:06.321
completely being destroyed, systematically.

00:36:06.321 --> 00:36:13.501
This is the media He wanted to hit, that's
why He took His birth and became a printer.

00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:15.011
He could have been anything else.

00:36:15.011 --> 00:36:19.141
No poet was a printer in England or anywhere
else.

00:36:19.141 --> 00:36:22.031
It was Blake, who became that.

00:36:22.031 --> 00:36:29.771
The reason was He wanted to show that this
media is the one and let Him cut it at its

00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:30.771
root.

00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:37.521
But as you know, evil grows, whether you like
it or not and today's media we cannot understand

00:36:37.521 --> 00:36:48.661
to what extent it has destroyed us, our roots,
our faiths, all our sublime and righteous

00:36:48.661 --> 00:36:50.531
visions.

00:36:50.531 --> 00:36:59.351
I know that I Myself was asked by your television
people and all that, to come down and talk

00:36:59.351 --> 00:37:00.351
to them.

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:07.611
But amazed at the way the people told Me that
an Anglo Saxon brain, God knows who made that

00:37:07.611 --> 00:37:17.771
brain, cannot understand anything that can
be done without money.

00:37:17.771 --> 00:37:23.911
I said you first get your realization, otherwise
I'm not coming to your programs, or to your

00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:25.741
televisions.

00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:30.591
That's the triumphant pride of Christ you
can see in His crucifixion.

00:37:30.591 --> 00:37:35.541
He didn't care, He could have gone fallen
at the feet, you see, as our politicians do,

00:37:35.541 --> 00:37:38.771
morning 'til evening, moving from one place
to another.

00:37:38.771 --> 00:37:42.881
He would have gone to the scribes and the
Pharisees and said, "Oh, please forgive, I

00:37:42.881 --> 00:37:46.341
will serve you all My life, I'll sell everything."

00:37:46.341 --> 00:37:48.021
He would not accept that bribe.

00:37:48.021 --> 00:37:58.441
He went with that triumphant pride on the
cross.

00:37:58.441 --> 00:37:59.701
But what does it show?

00:37:59.701 --> 00:38:02.391
What does it show?

00:38:02.391 --> 00:38:08.124
That we, the stupid, crucified that great
Personality and today are we not again crucifying

00:38:08.149 --> 00:38:09.769
Him?

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:19.471
That's why I'll say that He was a great Prophet,
because He makes prophecies that, if you do

00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:28.592
not take to the right path, if you do not
take to the higher seeking, all these things

00:38:28.617 --> 00:38:29.617
will show.

00:38:29.846 --> 00:38:34.621
Now we have to understand, because it concerns
us.

00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:39.923
This is what is happening to us, to us, to
our children, to our families, to our society,

00:38:39.948 --> 00:38:40.978
to our country.

00:38:41.803 --> 00:38:53.438
Let us face it and understand that compassion
of God can fail in such horrible, blazing

00:38:53.470 --> 00:39:00.216
hearts, which doesn't have any understanding
of the spirit.

00:39:00.264 --> 00:39:08.389
Sahaja Yoga came on this earth long time back,
much before I came on this earth, and today

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.828
it has come to England.

00:39:09.853 --> 00:39:13.769
We should say I came here twelve years back.

00:39:13.769 --> 00:39:22.229
It took fourteen years for Blake to write
Jerusalem and I think after fourteen years

00:39:22.229 --> 00:39:29.609
also if I could really feel satisfied that
I've been able to do some justice to Him in

00:39:29.609 --> 00:39:37.059
this Jerusalem that He wanted to build, I'll
be very much grateful to you all.

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:42.289
But it's not so, it's a very disappointing
thing.

00:39:42.289 --> 00:39:47.809
People don't want to listen anything, they
want to listen to something that they like,

00:39:47.809 --> 00:39:53.879
that you have to play on their weaknesses;
all the time tell them that whatever wrong

00:39:53.879 --> 00:39:58.629
you are doing is a good thing; go ahead with
it.

00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:05.599
Now the compassion and love of Christ can
work out miracles, no doubt.

00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:09.999
It can work out, because He came for us.

00:40:09.999 --> 00:40:12.989
The whole universe was created for us.

00:40:12.989 --> 00:40:16.379
It is for us to receive all the blessings
of the Divine.

00:40:16.379 --> 00:40:21.159
It is we who are going to become the spirit.

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:23.899
As He said, "You are to be born again".

00:40:23.899 --> 00:40:32.239
But the conditioning, of the subtle conditionings
of these ... surroundings and the atmosphere,

00:40:32.264 --> 00:40:41.709
the history and all that, is so much embedded
in us, but we don't realize and are not aware,

00:40:41.709 --> 00:40:48.859
that we have to look upward.

00:40:48.859 --> 00:40:56.929
Blake's life was another crucifixion, I feel.

00:40:56.929 --> 00:41:05.009
When I read Him, tears fall continuously sometimes.

00:41:05.009 --> 00:41:16.469
What a Son of a great Father, who said Christ
was not bothered about His parents.

00:41:16.469 --> 00:41:19.529
He ran away from the house at the age of twelve
years.

00:41:19.529 --> 00:41:24.509
That means all the boys are now running from
their houses at twelve years taking to drugs;

00:41:24.509 --> 00:41:30.349
that's the best way we can pay homage to Him,
by running away from the houses taking to

00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:36.429
drugs, because Christ ran away from the house
at the age of twelve years.

00:41:36.429 --> 00:41:41.819
And He said, "This is My Father's business,"
that's what He writes, "What do I care for

00:41:41.819 --> 00:41:43.939
the parents?"

00:41:43.939 --> 00:41:49.709
That does not mean that you should not respect
your parents, but it means that, "I am at

00:41:49.709 --> 00:41:56.669
a higher seeking, I have a higher seeking,
I have to move in another direction.

00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:03.379
You have lived in this direction, whatever
it is you have balanced your life, but I have

00:42:03.379 --> 00:42:05.819
to ascend."

00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:11.559
And this is the message He has tried to put
forward before you, very clearly.

00:42:11.559 --> 00:42:16.374
That is so obvious, so clear cut.

00:42:16.565 --> 00:42:23.629
Wherever He's so fiery, wherever He's so compassionate,
wherever He's so gentle, wherever He's so

00:42:23.629 --> 00:42:31.750
modest, the inner line is one that, "Achieve
your ascent; achieve your higher being; become

00:42:31.775 --> 00:42:32.750
that."

00:42:33.734 --> 00:42:36.629
He has prepared grounds for us here in England.

00:42:36.629 --> 00:42:42.679
As I have told you many a times, England is
a very important part of the universe, which

00:42:42.679 --> 00:42:45.939
I don't know how many Englishmen realize.

00:42:45.939 --> 00:42:51.899
It is the heart of the universe; it is small,
but so important.

00:42:51.899 --> 00:42:54.589
But what do we get from the heart?

00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:59.832
What do we have in the heart?

00:42:59.932 --> 00:43:01.444
Racialism.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.209
If Christ comes here, you'll throw Him out
because He's not English, or do you believe

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:12.258
that He was English?

00:43:12.457 --> 00:43:19.709
What do we get ? We can't love our children,
we kill our children, we ill-treat them.

00:43:19.709 --> 00:43:22.838
You are sitting in the heart of the universe.

00:43:22.838 --> 00:43:31.618
This is the heart of the universe and what
do you have to give to the world?

00:43:31.618 --> 00:43:32.618
The spirit.

00:43:32.618 --> 00:43:41.409
The spirit resides in your heart and that's
why Blake said that England has to become

00:43:41.409 --> 00:43:43.866
Jerusalem, because it is the heart.

00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:53.394
That means Spirit has to come in the attention
of the universe, otherwise things won't work

00:43:53.419 --> 00:44:03.159
out, but from where is it going to come, this
Spirit, where is going to be awakened?

00:44:03.159 --> 00:44:09.258
It is going to be awakened in the human beings,
and where are those human beings - in the

00:44:09.258 --> 00:44:11.409
heart?

00:44:11.544 --> 00:44:13.083
Where are they living?

00:44:13.108 --> 00:44:18.238
Even those who have come here, immigrants
and all that, they are gone cases, useless,

00:44:18.238 --> 00:44:19.599
good for nothing.

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:25.669
And those who are living here are already
lethargic; the heart is lethargic, it cannot

00:44:25.669 --> 00:44:28.509
pump anything out of it.

00:44:28.509 --> 00:44:35.308
First it was over pumping, tried to impress
the whole world, and now after the impression,

00:44:35.308 --> 00:44:39.698
it is in depression.

00:44:39.698 --> 00:44:47.339
This heart has to awaken, to make the whole
world a spiritual being.

00:44:47.339 --> 00:44:50.269
Do we realize our responsibility?

00:44:50.269 --> 00:44:57.998
Do we understand this - what is the role we
have to play as a spiritual being?

00:44:57.998 --> 00:45:05.008
You have to play a role as a spiritual being
now; but we are not, we are busy with all

00:45:05.008 --> 00:45:10.899
other nonsensical things, but with theSpirit.

00:45:10.899 --> 00:45:14.569
I have labored for twelve years, as I said,
and I think I'll have to stay here for two

00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:23.738
years more, fourteen years, and then only
maybe, I hope so, Jerusalem will start showing

00:45:23.738 --> 00:45:26.149
its results in this country.

00:45:26.149 --> 00:45:31.008
You can do it, you are the only ones who can
do it, nobody else.

00:45:31.008 --> 00:45:33.389
You are entitled to that.

00:45:33.389 --> 00:45:38.459
God has chosen you to be born here, with a
purpose.

00:45:38.459 --> 00:45:43.359
But you can't talk to any one about religion,
they don't discuss religion.

00:45:43.359 --> 00:45:46.488
But what religion?

00:45:46.488 --> 00:45:50.389
Religion which contains all the religions
of the world.

00:45:50.389 --> 00:45:57.119
Religion which is the inner balance, the tranquility
within you, which gives you the ascent and

00:45:57.119 --> 00:45:58.399
we don't discuss it.

00:45:58.399 --> 00:46:03.929
This is out of etiquette, we can discuss all
the drunkards and all the pubs of the world,

00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:09.144
but we cannot discuss such a horrible thing
like religion, which is so innate and within

00:46:09.169 --> 00:46:10.759
ourselves.

00:46:11.939 --> 00:46:16.119
You cannot have anything in the newspaper
about it.

00:46:16.119 --> 00:46:23.339
But, He has described all the fake gurus and
all the satanic people with such a strong

00:46:23.339 --> 00:46:28.988
description of all these and you see them
and thousands follow these nonsensical people,

00:46:28.988 --> 00:46:34.698
pay them money, become beggars, but they don't
want to come to reality.

00:46:34.698 --> 00:46:42.829
Why, I ask Myself, why it's happening like
this?

00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:47.219
No use going to any excuses.

00:46:47.219 --> 00:46:54.718
Here is someone who has given you such a lot
of explanation.

00:46:54.718 --> 00:46:59.792
Holy Ghost, He says, and Holy Ghost ... a
vacuum.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:07.103
You ask anyone, I was surprised, when it was
asked to some very big bishop, "What do you

00:47:07.128 --> 00:47:07.800
think of Holy Ghost?"

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:13.197
He says, "I'm agnostic, agnostic."

00:47:13.899 --> 00:47:17.199
Then ... from India ... asks him, "Then what
are you doing here?"

00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:20.219
He said, "I am doing my job, as you are doing
your job."

00:47:20.219 --> 00:47:22.789
[unknown name and word] it's all quiet.

00:47:22.789 --> 00:47:27.649
He's agnostic, he doesn't know anything about
Holy Ghost.

00:47:27.649 --> 00:47:29.229
What is Holy Ghost?

00:47:29.229 --> 00:47:33.788
William Blake has said, "It resides within
you."

00:47:33.788 --> 00:47:36.249
Why don't we find out where does it reside?

00:47:36.249 --> 00:47:39.058
... Why not we go out of the way to find out?

00:47:39.058 --> 00:47:42.458
Bible cannot contain Christ, the whole universe
cannot contain Christ.

00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:46.238
Let us go out and find out what others have
to say about it.

00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:51.978
But we are very insular self-opinionated,
great people sitting here in complete lethargy.

00:47:51.978 --> 00:47:59.146
We have no time, we don't think anybody to
be considered about it, let us go out and

00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:00.314
see.

00:48:00.339 --> 00:48:07.058
What is Holy Ghost is very simple; Holy Ghost
is the Kundalini.

00:48:07.058 --> 00:48:10.779
See, you use logic, not rationality but logic,
is different.

00:48:10.779 --> 00:48:17.298
If you use your logic, you will see that we
have a Trinity, Holy Trinity.

00:48:17.298 --> 00:48:24.929
We have God Almighty, all right, and we have
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

00:48:24.929 --> 00:48:30.699
Have you heard of any father having a son
without the mother?

00:48:30.699 --> 00:48:35.458
Then who is the Holy Ghost is the Primordial
Mother.

00:48:35.458 --> 00:48:41.308
Automatically you come to that conclusion,
but Mother should not be mentioned.

00:48:41.308 --> 00:48:49.729
That's why Blake has said about the daughters
of Albion, because He knew the way the women

00:48:49.729 --> 00:48:51.389
were suppressed in this life.

00:48:51.389 --> 00:48:53.545
Very sophisticated ways.

00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:59.788
In Sanskrit it is said, yatra narya pujyante
tatra ramente devata "Where the women are

00:48:59.788 --> 00:49:03.433
worshipped, there remains the domain of the
deities."

00:49:03.616 --> 00:49:09.528
Where they are worshipped, and they have to
be worshipful, not the harlots, in the brothels

00:49:09.528 --> 00:49:19.659
and the women who walk nude and show off their
nudity to excite the baser self, but the ones

00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:26.569
who are worshipful, where they reside, reside
the gods.

00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:31.899
So these women were suppressed and suppressed
to such an extent that they did not want to

00:49:31.899 --> 00:49:35.219
talk about God as a Woman, anywhere.

00:49:35.219 --> 00:49:38.978
So Holy Ghost is something abstract, a dove.

00:49:38.978 --> 00:49:44.605
All right, it's a dove, then what.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:47.649
What does it do the dove?

00:49:47.649 --> 00:49:51.409
Why is it so important that we should have
blessings from the dove?

00:49:51.409 --> 00:49:53.169
Nobody explains, it's a mystery.

00:49:53.169 --> 00:49:58.319
We have to live with a mystery; everything
is a mystery, the banking is a mystery here,

00:49:58.319 --> 00:50:01.694
the where does the money go is also a mystery.

00:50:01.813 --> 00:50:06.198
It has something to do with the mafia, that's
also a mystery, then the Masonic people are

00:50:06.198 --> 00:50:10.099
organizing the Switzerland bank is also a
mystery.

00:50:10.099 --> 00:50:14.518
Everything mysterious and hidden and kept
aside, "Oh, that is not to be said, this is

00:50:14.518 --> 00:50:19.718
just 'overseas banking' Oh good, very good
name."

00:50:19.718 --> 00:50:25.929
It's 'overseas banking', it is this, it is
that, and we carry on with this hypocrisy,

00:50:25.929 --> 00:50:31.119
we carry on with all these false notions,
"Oh that's all right, that's all right, that

00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:32.119
part is all right."

00:50:32.119 --> 00:50:35.349
This is not forgiveness.

00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:39.379
What is the forgiveness for the cunning?

00:50:39.379 --> 00:50:42.689
What is the forgiveness for the crooked?

00:50:42.689 --> 00:50:47.899
What is the forgiveness for satan?

00:50:47.899 --> 00:50:53.373
Discrimination is needed when we talk of forgiveness.

00:50:53.398 --> 00:50:57.238
Forgiveness is for the people who think they
have committed sins.

00:50:57.238 --> 00:51:03.698
It's only in thinking you commit sins, otherwise
you do not.

00:51:03.698 --> 00:51:09.869
Look at a dog, look at a tiger, look at all
these people, if tiger has to eat the cow,

00:51:09.869 --> 00:51:11.538
it eats; does it commit any sin?

00:51:11.538 --> 00:51:12.859
It does not know about a sin.

00:51:12.859 --> 00:51:18.839
"Now I didn't know what is sin is," he will
say that, "I didn't know it was a sin, you

00:51:18.839 --> 00:51:25.181
see I just ate it, but what is the sin?"

00:51:25.546 --> 00:51:32.849
Just to condemn someone all the time, "You
are the sinners, you did this sin, you did

00:51:32.849 --> 00:51:34.218
that sin."

00:51:34.218 --> 00:51:38.548
Human beings, they are the temple of God.

00:51:38.548 --> 00:51:47.399
With what care, with love, affection, delicacy
they are created.

00:51:47.399 --> 00:51:48.528
For what?

00:51:48.528 --> 00:51:56.449
This lotus has been brought out of the mire
of illusion for what?

00:51:56.449 --> 00:51:57.508
To be condemned?

00:51:57.508 --> 00:51:59.919
To be trampled?

00:51:59.919 --> 00:52:06.379
To be ill-treated in this way, that too in
the name of God?

00:52:06.379 --> 00:52:19.459
Lotuses are created to be offered to the Gods,
with their fragrance, to illuminate the whole

00:52:19.459 --> 00:52:20.459
world.

00:52:20.459 --> 00:52:26.558
They are the poetic genius of the Lord, as
He has described.

00:52:26.558 --> 00:52:40.149
While we look at human beings as something
to be exploited, to be suppressed, to be oppressed

00:52:40.149 --> 00:52:46.889
and so, as He says, there are two types of
people, and He has given horrible names to

00:52:46.889 --> 00:52:54.839
them, who try to oppress the people, who try
to devour the people and He calls that the

00:52:54.839 --> 00:53:00.429
religion now has become the compromise between
the two.

00:53:00.429 --> 00:53:07.629
While the innocent suffer, while the simple
suffer, while the seekers suffer, while the

00:53:07.629 --> 00:53:10.569
good suffer, that's the fact.

00:53:10.569 --> 00:53:16.808
Let us all of us join together now and get
our realization.

00:53:16.808 --> 00:53:18.379
Become the spirit.

00:53:18.379 --> 00:53:23.558
Is the easiest thing to do for you, because
the Holy Ghost, which is the Kundalini, is

00:53:23.558 --> 00:53:24.699
within you.

00:53:24.699 --> 00:53:29.978
In the triangular bone She resides and She
can be awakened.

00:53:29.978 --> 00:53:35.988
Now one may say that, "Why didn't He talk
about Kundalini?

00:53:35.988 --> 00:53:39.669
Whatever He talked, who listened to him?

00:53:39.669 --> 00:53:43.659
Whatever He said, who tried to understand;
till today I don't find many people have understood

00:53:43.659 --> 00:53:45.469
Him.

00:53:45.469 --> 00:53:51.319
Whatever He manifested, who bothered to know
about it?

00:53:51.319 --> 00:53:55.968
And if He had talked of something more, it
would have been obscure.

00:53:55.968 --> 00:54:03.468
But He says, "I don't care for the idiots
for whom My sayings are obscure."

00:54:03.468 --> 00:54:04.468
He says clearly.

00:54:04.468 --> 00:54:12.359
He has used only thrice the word 'idiot' I
think, many times 'stupid' and so many times

00:54:12.359 --> 00:54:13.679
'the fools'.

00:54:13.679 --> 00:54:21.159
Above all that, to Me, all of them are God's
own children.

00:54:21.159 --> 00:54:23.599
I know how He was angry.

00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:32.438
I know why He was angry and I also understand
Him that He thought that, before Sahaja Yoga

00:54:32.438 --> 00:54:41.139
coming here, let Me scold them, let Me give
them a thump, let Me open them with a big

00:54:41.139 --> 00:54:43.438
blow, so they are ready.

00:54:43.438 --> 00:54:50.419
But in His criticism, I read, they said He
was not acceptable because He went too far.

00:54:50.419 --> 00:54:52.429
Same with Me.

00:54:52.429 --> 00:54:54.438
People don't accept Me because I go too far.

00:54:54.438 --> 00:54:55.719
I must try to please them.

00:54:55.719 --> 00:54:58.859
Am I seeking your votes that I should try
to please you?

00:54:58.859 --> 00:55:03.989
I have to tell you the truth, whether you
like it or not.

00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:08.569
I want you to accept it because that's what
I am here for.

00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:12.268
I'm here for that, that you accept the truth
and get it.

00:55:12.268 --> 00:55:13.548
I'll do my level best.

00:55:13.548 --> 00:55:18.489
I can make food for you, I can give you good
food to you, I can give you presents, I can

00:55:18.489 --> 00:55:21.458
do whatever a Mother can do for Her children.

00:55:21.458 --> 00:55:29.788
But when it doesn't work out, She has to shout
sometimes.

00:55:29.788 --> 00:55:35.609
She has to say things clearly, because you
have to get it.

00:55:35.609 --> 00:55:39.899
Now you cannot force it on people, this is
the biggest problem is.

00:55:39.899 --> 00:55:46.929
You cannot force Self-realization on to people,
you cannot do it by force.

00:55:46.929 --> 00:55:50.778
Say if the ... supposing Russians tell Me
they are very much interested to know about

00:55:50.778 --> 00:55:51.778
Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:51.778 --> 00:55:52.778
No doubt.

00:55:52.778 --> 00:55:59.528
But if they tell Me that, "You come to our
government and give them realization", I cannot,

00:55:59.528 --> 00:56:01.619
I cannot do it.

00:56:01.619 --> 00:56:02.919
You have to be free people.

00:56:02.919 --> 00:56:10.988
When you are free, then you are abandoned,
see, the wages of freedom we are paying.

00:56:10.988 --> 00:56:15.778
Nobody is free, in New York if you go, I have
to take out all these ornaments, which I am

00:56:15.778 --> 00:56:18.288
supposed to wear because of My family.

00:56:18.288 --> 00:56:24.829
I have to go there without a purse, I have
to tie up my purse inside here see something,

00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:28.429
otherwise they'll rob it.

00:56:28.429 --> 00:56:31.129
Nothing is safe.

00:56:31.129 --> 00:56:36.829
So this kind of a freedom which leads to violence,
to butchery; actually the way we have butchered

00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:43.339
our children, butchered our elders, the way
insulted every one of them, all that goes

00:56:43.339 --> 00:56:45.069
hand in hand with freedom.

00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:51.349
This is no freedom, this is absolutely unleashed
abandonment of the brutal self within us.

00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:59.699
So whether you go to Russia or to here Sahaja
Yoga is in a problem, whether you go to the

00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:09.159
left or to the right, I just don't understand,
where will it prosper, where freedom is used

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:12.718
with wisdom, with respect.

00:57:12.718 --> 00:57:19.788
If you cannot respect the freedom of others
you do not have the freedom at all, you have

00:57:19.788 --> 00:57:23.629
never known the freedom, you have never enjoyed
the freedom.

00:57:23.629 --> 00:57:32.968
So the freedom of human beings has to be respected
and when this freedom is respected, then only

00:57:32.968 --> 00:57:40.069
you can get your realization and then only
you can enter into higher freedom, into complete

00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:44.669
liberty that Blake has described.

00:57:44.669 --> 00:57:54.548
There are seekers, so many seekers in this
country, and so many are lost, so many are

00:57:54.548 --> 00:57:55.859
lost.

00:57:55.859 --> 00:58:03.659
There have been people who are saved by Sahaja
Yoga, who have been taking drugs, overnight

00:58:03.659 --> 00:58:05.359
they gave up, overnight.

00:58:05.359 --> 00:58:06.359
How?

00:58:06.359 --> 00:58:12.169
It's a mechanism within you, God has built
that, that power of the spirit when it enlightens

00:58:12.169 --> 00:58:15.339
you, you just become so powerful, you give
up.

00:58:15.339 --> 00:58:19.708
But beforehand if I say, "Don't have this
and don't have that", you cannot do it.

00:58:19.708 --> 00:58:23.438
You do not have that power of the spirit.

00:58:23.438 --> 00:58:29.489
Most of the incarnations who came before Christ
didn't realize this point, that human beings

00:58:29.489 --> 00:58:33.508
are not enlightened, they don't have the power
of the spirit within them.

00:58:33.508 --> 00:58:37.758
Christ realized it and He said it openly,
"You are to be born again."

00:58:37.758 --> 00:58:44.548
Not only that, but He said, "First of all
forgive, talk of forgiveness."

00:58:44.548 --> 00:58:50.329
So that they settle down, that they are not
paranoid, that they are not upset.

00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:56.639
Let them be settled down in peace and in compassion
and then awaken their kundalini and then give

00:58:56.639 --> 00:58:57.718
them realization.

00:58:57.718 --> 00:59:02.819
So then you have the power, then there is
no temptation, nothing like that.

00:59:02.819 --> 00:59:05.449
Will you tempt Christ with anything?

00:59:05.449 --> 00:59:06.708
You cannot.

00:59:06.708 --> 00:59:10.909
In the same way you do not get enslaved to
any temptations.

00:59:10.909 --> 00:59:17.139
You rise in your own beauty and glory, and
your own strength and power.

00:59:17.139 --> 00:59:21.258
You don't have to get subdued to anything.

00:59:21.258 --> 00:59:24.958
This is what is Self-realization.

00:59:24.958 --> 00:59:29.169
Sahaja Yoga came to London about twelve years
back when I came.

00:59:29.169 --> 00:59:33.109
Now I am not an immigrant for your information,
at all.

00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:40.349
I just came by chance, I should say, or by
God's ordained programming.

00:59:40.349 --> 00:59:46.349
My husband got elected to this job out of
hundred and thirty-four nations, you see.

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:51.278
He was elected , we came here, just because
he was elected, not even appointed, but elected,

00:59:51.278 --> 00:59:53.028
and elected four times unanimously.

00:59:53.028 --> 00:59:56.989
He is the senior most senior secretary-general.

00:59:56.989 --> 01:00:04.448
So we had to come here, and that's how I'm
here, otherwise I may not have ever come to

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:08.579
England to teach Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:18.308
With Blake, One feels compelled to try and
try and try to establish Jerusalem, whatever

01:00:18.308 --> 01:00:27.349
may be the case, whatever may be the disappointment,
whatever may be the disgust, doesn't matter.

01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:29.909
One has to do it.

01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:37.709
He had such faith in the England's soil that
we have to build the Jerusalem.

01:00:37.709 --> 01:00:46.548
But first, everyone of you who are here must
get your realization and humble down before

01:00:46.548 --> 01:00:47.548
your realization.

01:00:47.548 --> 01:00:51.319
You are not to be arrogant with it.

01:00:51.319 --> 01:00:58.663
He said Christ was not humble before human
beings, but before God He was.

01:00:58.663 --> 01:00:59.939
Before His Father He was.

01:00:59.939 --> 01:01:06.458
In the same way, you have to be humble before
your spirit and before your Self-realization

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:12.988
and you have to get to the higher state.

01:01:12.988 --> 01:01:16.949
It's surprising that in India, we had all
this knowledge all these years, but we were

01:01:16.949 --> 01:01:20.478
supposed to be heathens, I don't know what
else they called us.

01:01:20.478 --> 01:01:22.978
We were supposed to be slaves.

01:01:22.978 --> 01:01:28.079
Nobody wanted to know anything about it, the
knowledge of the roots existed and our intellectuals

01:01:28.079 --> 01:01:33.399
also never bothered, they always followed
Oxford and Cambridge traditions.

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:42.718
With this Oxbridge business, we never got
through people to tell them about this great

01:01:42.718 --> 01:01:46.819
knowledge we had in that country and everything
subsided.

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:51.599
This knowledge is not meant for India, is
not meant for any particular place, is meant

01:01:51.599 --> 01:01:56.619
for the whole world, as your knowledge of
science, all the knowledge of the tree is

01:01:56.619 --> 01:02:00.698
meant for the whole world, which you gave
it to us, or to give it to all the eastern

01:02:00.698 --> 01:02:02.469
countries and people accept it.

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:08.359
What's the harm in accepting the knowledge
which comes to you for your benevolence; only

01:02:08.359 --> 01:02:14.379
because it is from the eastern side you feel
so insecure about it?

01:02:14.379 --> 01:02:17.879
From where did Christ come?

01:02:17.879 --> 01:02:20.678
He came from America?

01:02:20.678 --> 01:02:23.268
I think He must have run away.

01:02:23.268 --> 01:02:34.879
Despite that I must say among all of them,
British are the most matured.

01:02:34.879 --> 01:02:40.459
But we run after Americans, we run after French,
we run after everyone, not being aware of

01:02:40.459 --> 01:02:46.808
ourselves, what we are, we are wisdom.

01:02:46.808 --> 01:02:56.278
We are the people who represent the heart
of the universe and time has taken, from Him

01:02:56.278 --> 01:02:58.599
to this time, that we have matured now.

01:02:58.599 --> 01:03:06.729
I hope we have matured enough to understand
that there has to be a breakthrough.

01:03:06.729 --> 01:03:14.819
When they published My handbills, you see,
somehow it so happened that My face has come

01:03:14.819 --> 01:03:16.079
out quite black in that.

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:22.739
I said, "Forget it, nobody will come to our
program, if you show such a black face they'll

01:03:22.739 --> 01:03:29.758
say, 'oh, somebody coming from Africa is trying
to teach us what is Jerusalem'."

01:03:29.758 --> 01:03:34.058
So they had to re-do it, to show that I am
not that black.

01:03:34.058 --> 01:03:43.409
What difference does it make, the skin deep
color?

01:03:43.409 --> 01:03:51.028
The color comes from the heart, the beauty
comes from the heart, the exuberance of the

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:59.579
heart expresses that beauty on your being
and the beauty of the truth is that, that

01:03:59.579 --> 01:04:02.119
it acts, it works.

01:04:02.119 --> 01:04:07.448
It just doesn't decorate itself, it doesn't
try to take to ways and methods of luring

01:04:07.448 --> 01:04:12.899
people but it acts, whether you like it or
not it acts.

01:04:12.899 --> 01:04:16.458
Let us work it out.

01:04:16.458 --> 01:04:18.579
Is simple.

01:04:18.579 --> 01:04:26.409
Instead of going into intellectual feats and
going into the direction of finite understanding

01:04:26.409 --> 01:04:32.958
through your brains, let us go to the infinite;
that's only possible when you get to your

01:04:32.958 --> 01:04:37.198
spirit, which is infinite, which creates the
collective consciousness within.

01:04:37.198 --> 01:04:43.298
Which creates, I say, which means knowledge,
but knowledge does not mean what you know

01:04:43.298 --> 01:04:48.968
through your brain, but what you know through
your central nervous system; that you can

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:53.958
feel it, that you can feel the chakras of
everyone on your fingertips.

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:58.879
Mohammed Sahib has said, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak".

01:04:58.879 --> 01:05:04.268
But look at the Muslims, they never, never
talk of the resurrection, when most of Koran

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:05.659
is nothing but resurrection.

01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:09.248
They talk of the doomsday because they have
to make money by frightening people.

01:05:09.248 --> 01:05:13.728
Beware of the doomsday, you give the money,
we'll save you, we'll give a certificate;

01:05:13.728 --> 01:05:16.558
at the doomsday you stand with the certificate,
you'll be saved.

01:05:16.558 --> 01:05:19.458
First they will go down in the doomsday.

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:33.978
This is for every religion, people have used
it for very baser things, making money, creating

01:05:33.978 --> 01:05:37.149
political ideas.

01:05:37.149 --> 01:05:46.058
I can't understand how can diamonds be thrown
into dirt like this, and covered with that,

01:05:46.058 --> 01:05:49.758
and the fragrance turned into filth.

01:05:49.758 --> 01:05:52.518
It is beyond Me.

01:05:52.518 --> 01:05:59.079
The powers of human beings sometimes supercede
that of God, you can see the way they can

01:05:59.079 --> 01:06:04.659
change the forms, they change the beauty,
change everything that is reality, into something

01:06:04.659 --> 01:06:06.798
nonsensical and stupid.

01:06:06.798 --> 01:06:11.558
And they live with it, they don't want to
know about it; they enjoy it.

01:06:11.558 --> 01:06:15.119
"We are very happy people, what's wrong."

01:06:15.144 --> 01:06:19.425
What a waste, one feels, of this creation.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:29.439
One feels with what aspirations and visions
these human beings were created on this earth.

01:06:29.439 --> 01:06:39.509
And then what should we do to make them understand
what they are, to make them aware with that

01:06:39.509 --> 01:06:45.949
perception, with that vision of the Divine
that they are?

01:06:45.998 --> 01:06:55.008
Sometimes, I also cry in the wilderness and
share some of the pathos of all these poets

01:06:55.008 --> 01:07:03.359
who came on this earth and suffered, and suffered,
and suffered.

01:07:03.359 --> 01:07:11.478
I hope today, with all this anguish, whatever
I am telling you, you will try to see that

01:07:11.478 --> 01:07:15.859
sincerity is the only way you can understand
yourself.

01:07:15.859 --> 01:07:24.069
No books , nothing, no conditioning, no denial,
nothing can convince you but the sincerity

01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:33.728
to know the spirit, which is within you and
this sincerity I call it as the pure desire.

01:07:33.728 --> 01:07:39.728
If you have that pure desire, which is the
power of your kundalini, you will get your

01:07:39.728 --> 01:07:41.068
realization.

01:07:41.093 --> 01:07:44.537
Now, just now, the shoot.

01:07:45.092 --> 01:07:50.558
That's all is needed, the pure desire to be
the Spirit, nothing more than that.

01:07:50.558 --> 01:07:58.649
But when it is awakened, then it is to be
looked after, that's very important; it has

01:07:58.649 --> 01:08:06.798
to be looked after, it has to be kept burning,
it has to be maneuvered and kept at a point

01:08:06.798 --> 01:08:10.538
that you start growing more and more.

01:08:10.538 --> 01:08:15.188
I need not tell you all about Sahaja Yoga,
it's going to be too much for you, but how

01:08:15.188 --> 01:08:19.359
Blake has worked for us.

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:28.129
So many poets have done this job and now the
new great poets are coming to finish us off,

01:08:28.129 --> 01:08:41.808
to please the media, to make money, befool
us, using flowery words, pleasing sentences,

01:08:41.808 --> 01:08:45.064
taking us to hell directly.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:50.899
Beware of them, beware, save your children
from them, save the whole community.

01:08:50.899 --> 01:08:56.680
The whole of England has to be saved because
if the heart dies, the whole universe will

01:08:56.705 --> 01:08:58.006
die.

01:08:58.839 --> 01:09:05.538
May God bless you.

01:09:27.849 --> 01:09:43.704
The Sahaja yogis didn't want Me to allow you
to ask Me questions but I think better ask

01:09:43.737 --> 01:09:45.177
Me some questions.

01:09:45.177 --> 01:09:48.276
Q.....about the chakras....

01:09:48.276 --> 01:09:52.417
Shri Mataji: Yes sir.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:57.286
That's what I said, that I didn't talk about
them because it would be too long a lecture

01:09:57.286 --> 01:10:04.068
but we have got a book on this, a little book
and there it is all written though I say that

01:10:04.068 --> 01:10:11.306
before realization don't even read that book,
can create problems.

01:10:11.306 --> 01:10:18.213
You can know all about the subtle side, the
chakras and everything without paying anything,

01:10:18.242 --> 01:10:19.732
without any effort.

01:10:20.348 --> 01:10:25.887
There are people now in England, you will
be surprised, so many of them are excellent

01:10:25.887 --> 01:10:30.717
Sahaja yogis who are experts and they will
tell you all about it very clearly.

01:10:30.717 --> 01:10:32.556
We have got books to explain.

01:10:32.556 --> 01:10:34.976
As you see there are seven chakras are shown
here.

01:10:34.976 --> 01:10:40.870
The lowermost is the Mooladhara Chakra, is
the innocence.

01:10:41.497 --> 01:10:46.627
Q:...can you see it with your eyes, outside
the body, can you see it?

01:10:46.627 --> 01:10:52.476
Shri Mataji: If you see something then you
are not that.

01:10:52.476 --> 01:10:57.506
And people have seen it because they were
not that, because they moved on the sides,

01:10:57.506 --> 01:11:01.197
on the sympathetic nervous system, what we
call the Ida and Pingala.

01:11:01.197 --> 01:11:05.687
When you go on sympathetic nervous system
you can see it from outside.

01:11:05.687 --> 01:11:10.267
Like this building you can see it from outside,
but when you are in it you don't see it, you

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:11.776
see only the inside.

01:11:11.776 --> 01:11:18.076
So that's what it is, when you ascend, you
need not see anything, you become, you get

01:11:18.076 --> 01:11:23.467
the powers.

01:11:23.467 --> 01:11:29.596
People have seen it no doubt, but that one
should not ask for.

01:11:29.596 --> 01:11:40.796
I can see the glass - better to drink the
water.

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:42.006
Now what else?

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:51.716
Q:....what do You do with all Your wealth,
all your money?

01:11:51.716 --> 01:11:54.616
Shri Mataji: My money?

01:11:54.616 --> 01:12:01.627
Are you from the bank?

01:12:01.627 --> 01:12:06.957
What I do with My money - what do you want
Me to do?

01:12:06.957 --> 01:12:09.076
What sort of a question is this?

01:12:09.076 --> 01:12:17.167
Ask a simple straightforward question madam
I don't understand what do I do with My money,

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:19.197
I don't do anything with it.

01:12:19.197 --> 01:12:24.407
Actually My husband manages his money, I ask
him whatever I like.

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:28.207
Of course he earns a lot no doubt, he earns
very much.

01:12:28.207 --> 01:12:32.316
I sometimes tell him, "I'm ashamed the way
they give you money," because he doesn't even

01:12:32.316 --> 01:12:33.816
pay any tax you know.

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:38.207
Of course I do spend some money on Sahaja
Yoga, I must confess I have to sometimes,

01:12:38.207 --> 01:12:39.276
what to do?

01:12:39.276 --> 01:12:47.336
One has to and these people have their own
ashrams, where they stay, and look after it.

01:12:47.336 --> 01:12:50.937
For this hall they must have collected some
money I don't know, I don't know what do they

01:12:50.937 --> 01:12:53.957
do with their money, I don't know, I have
no idea, I've never seen that.

01:12:53.957 --> 01:12:56.846
They are honest people, they all know all
about it.

01:12:56.846 --> 01:13:02.596
I don't know anything, I have nothing to do
with it.

01:13:02.596 --> 01:13:09.086
This is the aggressiveness, "What do I do
with My money" Just look at this.

01:13:09.086 --> 01:13:11.147
Yes sir?

01:13:11.147 --> 01:13:25.296
Q....a man has mental illness, he wants to
know whether he'll have it after he dies....

01:13:39.434 --> 01:13:45.577
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, just now you can
cure it.

01:13:45.602 --> 01:13:47.441
Why to think of death?

01:13:47.466 --> 01:13:53.479
You can be cured of your mental illness at
least, minimum, that could be done.

01:13:53.504 --> 01:14:04.036
Q....How can you tell that it's Self-realization?

01:14:04.036 --> 01:14:06.296
You feel a breeze but how does it become...

01:14:20.452 --> 01:14:24.692
Shri Mataji: You see, when you feel the cool
breeze is the beginning of it, all right?

01:14:24.717 --> 01:14:28.382
Now you have to see what this cool breeze
is, all right?

01:14:28.407 --> 01:14:34.407
Now if you go to a college of science or a
college of medicine what you have to do is

01:14:34.432 --> 01:14:41.893
to see what it is, isn't it; and to see whatever
it says does it prove.

01:14:41.893 --> 01:14:49.412
Now, when you see the cool breeze in your
hand, what happens that it is, as I said,

01:14:49.412 --> 01:14:53.976
is the compassion of God say for example,
you just believe in the hypothesis just now.

01:14:54.001 --> 01:14:58.567
Now what is this compassion doing, is made
you a computer.

01:14:58.592 --> 01:15:05.052
On the fingertips you can tell what centers
are catching, of yours and of others, so you

01:15:05.077 --> 01:15:07.306
become the diagnosis.

01:15:07.331 --> 01:15:14.982
Now if you know a little few gestures by which
you can handle this power, you can cure them.

01:15:15.007 --> 01:15:17.513
That's the minimum, all right?

01:15:17.538 --> 01:15:22.169
You can know from this whether you have mental
problem or you have emotional problem, or

01:15:22.194 --> 01:15:25.623
you have physical problem and of what nature.

01:15:26.071 --> 01:15:30.605
This is how is the self-knowledge starts,
from the very basics.

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:35.229
What's your problem with you, first let us
see the problem on the centers, all right?

01:15:35.254 --> 01:15:40.405
Then you move forward when you go with it,
then you understand what's the problem with

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:45.559
others; then what's the problem in the collective;
then what's the problem of this country; and

01:15:45.736 --> 01:15:52.766
if you know how to solve them, sitting down
here, you can do it, you can solve it.

01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:57.872
But this is the breeze which has to be felt
first because this is the breeze which we

01:15:57.897 --> 01:16:01.806
call as the all-pervading power of God.

01:16:01.882 --> 01:16:07.943
Now, just because I say you should not believe
Me, because blind faith is of no use, but

01:16:07.943 --> 01:16:11.483
you can experiment and see for yourself.

01:16:11.483 --> 01:16:13.283
Even little children know.

01:16:13.283 --> 01:16:16.862
They can tell you what is catching in you,
what chakras are catching.

01:16:16.862 --> 01:16:22.243
You can have ten children, 'fold' their eyes,
put them before a gentleman, immediately they'll

01:16:22.243 --> 01:16:24.683
raise this finger or this finger.

01:16:24.683 --> 01:16:29.592
Supposing they raise this finger, means this
person feels terribly guilty.

01:16:29.592 --> 01:16:34.703
He must be a Catholic that he feels so guilty.

01:16:34.703 --> 01:16:38.843
That the children won't say but you will know
that this is the chakra is caught up here

01:16:38.843 --> 01:16:41.933
because he's feeling guilty.

01:16:41.933 --> 01:16:47.922
Like that you can go on finding on your own
being like a laboratory the whole thing becomes

01:16:47.922 --> 01:16:55.003
like a computer because it is knowledge, knowledge
through your central nervous system, through

01:16:55.003 --> 01:16:57.922
your evolutionary process.

01:16:57.922 --> 01:17:02.142
But you have to practice and understand what
it is.

01:17:02.142 --> 01:17:07.062
If I give you a car, how will you know it
moves unless and until you get into it and

01:17:07.062 --> 01:17:09.783
know how to drive it, isn't it.

01:17:09.783 --> 01:17:17.062
You have to give some time, not much, but
you enjoy, best part of it you enjoy doing

01:17:17.062 --> 01:17:18.062
the whole thing.

01:17:18.062 --> 01:17:25.092
It just flows automatically, you don't have
to do anything about it.

01:17:25.092 --> 01:17:31.943
But one has to learn, little bit, what it
is.

01:17:31.943 --> 01:17:38.533
Before realization you don't have to do anything,
it just forms spontaneously as the seed is

01:17:38.533 --> 01:17:40.683
sown in the Mother Earth, all right?

01:17:40.683 --> 01:17:45.772
Then when it comes out, then you have to look
after it; the same way you have to look after

01:17:45.772 --> 01:17:47.802
your realization, respect it.

01:17:47.802 --> 01:17:49.642
Then you become the masters.

01:17:49.642 --> 01:17:55.152
We have one master standing here and we have
so many.

01:17:55.152 --> 01:18:04.415
They are just like you to look at, but they
know so much and they are so humble.

01:18:04.415 --> 01:18:09.852
They don't go about with a big plate on their
heads "I am the master of this and master

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:10.852
of that" nothing.

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:16.713
They are doing all their jobs, they are doing
very well, they are blessed and also they

01:18:16.713 --> 01:18:21.253
are helping people to get their realization.

01:18:21.253 --> 01:18:26.373
You'll be surprised in Sahaja Yoga very difficult
to get an unemployed person.

01:18:26.373 --> 01:18:28.083
All of them are employed.

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:32.073
If they are unemployed they get employment
with God also.

01:18:34.653 --> 01:18:37.043
Basically they are employed by God.

01:18:38.035 --> 01:18:39.035
All right?

01:18:39.567 --> 01:18:47.210
Q... is this the only way to get realization?

01:18:47.235 --> 01:18:51.221
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course; there cannot
be another, God could not make thousand and

01:18:51.246 --> 01:18:52.945
one, could He?

01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:58.211
That would be too much of a headache , like
as you sprout the seed, how do you do it?

01:18:58.236 --> 01:18:59.236
Spontaneously.

01:18:59.261 --> 01:19:04.531
Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous, living process
is always spontaneous.

01:19:04.715 --> 01:19:09.945
Now supposing we want to sprout a seed and
we take out the primule, push it out and push

01:19:09.970 --> 01:19:13.430
it inside the Mother Earth, will it sprout
- no.

01:19:13.455 --> 01:19:17.886
You have to take advantage of the powers of
the Mother Earth, to sprout a seed, isn't

01:19:17.911 --> 01:19:20.091
it?

01:19:25.723 --> 01:19:36.252
Q. ...saying she has not come across Sahaja
Yoga in the religions, that there are many

01:19:36.277 --> 01:19:36.874
religions.

01:19:37.181 --> 01:19:40.508
Shri Mataji: In the religions there's no ... religions
are no religions, that's the trouble is.

01:19:40.545 --> 01:19:44.965
I have told you all this just now that there
is nothing, they will never mention that is

01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:46.630
sensible, but it's not so.

01:19:46.687 --> 01:19:52.437
I would say Sikhism, we can say is the latest
religion.

01:19:52.437 --> 01:19:59.417
I mean there are so many verses about, much
later than Islam, Sikhism came on this earth

01:19:59.417 --> 01:20:04.417
and they have said that, complete description,
I mean you don't understand Hindi otherwise

01:20:04.417 --> 01:20:09.497
I would have told you - Ida, Pingala, Sushumna
- everything they have described - Kabira

01:20:09.497 --> 01:20:15.467
has described at such length that we have
in India a great poet Gyaneshwara and He has

01:20:15.467 --> 01:20:17.487
described all about kundalini.

01:20:17.487 --> 01:20:21.107
If you go in Maharashtra and tell them that
somebody is going to awaken the kundalini,

01:20:21.107 --> 01:20:26.647
they'll all rush, they know all about it.

01:20:26.647 --> 01:20:29.107
How many years did Christ live?

01:20:29.107 --> 01:20:33.997
How many times He could talk to people?

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:38.997
How many of them accepted Him and how many
of them understood Him?

01:20:38.997 --> 01:20:49.212
He went to a wrong place, I tell you; all
were deaf, dumb and brainless.

01:20:49.848 --> 01:20:52.878
How will they understand?

01:20:52.903 --> 01:20:57.513
How could He talk about Kundalini when everybody
was after His life?

01:20:57.513 --> 01:21:02.741
But He did talk of Holy Ghost, He talked of
the Comforter He was going to send.

01:21:02.766 --> 01:21:05.806
He talked of so many things in that short
time.

01:21:05.831 --> 01:21:11.871
Do you know for four years I was struggling
with seven hippies in London; for four years.

01:21:11.896 --> 01:21:19.196
I must say, it's very creditable for Him in
three and a half years to talk so much.

01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:23.591
How many years Blake had to work hard to talk
to you?

01:21:23.616 --> 01:21:25.856
Is it easy to talk to people about truth?

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:30.951
Very difficult; everybody is extremely intelligent
and wise, nobody want to listen to anything,

01:21:30.976 --> 01:21:31.976
do they?

01:21:32.829 --> 01:21:38.930
But in India we have a tradition; we know
it; that you have to ascend.

01:21:38.955 --> 01:21:41.197
The whole thing works out that way.

01:21:41.222 --> 01:21:46.162
If they talk of kundalini, not in the North
so much, but in Maharashtra, if you go, if

01:21:46.187 --> 01:21:49.551
you go in the South, you'll be amazed six
thousand people, seven thousand people come

01:21:49.576 --> 01:21:50.576
in a village.

01:21:50.601 --> 01:21:54.231
They have seen it, these people have seen
it, they come in bullock carts, they come

01:21:54.256 --> 01:22:03.066
in, any way that is possible for them, buses,
and trains, and they walk miles together when

01:22:03.091 --> 01:22:05.721
they hear I'm there.

01:22:05.746 --> 01:22:12.812
Once I was coming from a program in the night
and suddenly I found lots of people lying

01:22:12.837 --> 01:22:13.837
on the road.

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:15.684
I said, "Who are these people?"

01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:18.278
They said, "Mother we couldn't reach Your
program, we were late, You give us realization

01:22:18.303 --> 01:22:19.770
here."

01:22:19.795 --> 01:22:20.770
I said: "All right, have it."

01:22:21.522 --> 01:22:26.726
They had it, they are the ones who'll get
much faster than anyone else, I know, that's

01:22:26.751 --> 01:22:28.921
why I don't mind spending some time here.

01:22:28.946 --> 01:22:34.366
Once I go there, you will see the whole country
would be ablaze, I'm not telling you lies,

01:22:34.391 --> 01:22:36.314
you ask the people who have been there.

01:22:36.339 --> 01:22:41.439
They are very different type of people, to
them most important is their spirit.

01:22:41.464 --> 01:22:48.944
If you tell them what, the way we talk about
Christ here, so disrespectfully, without understanding,

01:22:48.969 --> 01:22:50.678
they are shocked.

01:22:50.737 --> 01:22:56.316
Any Indian who is a Christian or a Muslim
or a Hindu, doesn't treat the way you treat

01:22:56.341 --> 01:22:57.341
Bible.

01:22:58.855 --> 01:23:02.959
The respect they have has come to them traditionally.

01:23:03.134 --> 01:23:06.224
Of course you don't judge Indians by the Indians
who have come here.

01:23:06.224 --> 01:23:13.034
They like your company, they are this type,
they are materialistic, they want to have

01:23:13.034 --> 01:23:20.824
money, they have come here to earn money,
but the people who are in India in the villages,

01:23:20.824 --> 01:23:29.064
not in the cities, are still seeking, seeking
God, they're very simple people, humble people.

01:23:29.064 --> 01:23:31.514
Traditionally we have known for thousands
of years.

01:23:31.514 --> 01:23:40.265
I talk of Markandeya who was there twelve
thousand years back, who incarnated here as

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:42.075
William Blake.

01:23:42.639 --> 01:23:47.314
Twelve thousand years back He said the same
thing which is said in England after twelve

01:23:47.314 --> 01:23:51.042
thousand years, because that time I don't
know what was here, may be only jungles, I

01:23:51.067 --> 01:23:52.217
think.

01:23:54.684 --> 01:24:01.944
And that is also waste, isn't it, tell Me,
isn't it?

01:24:01.944 --> 01:24:04.584
How much could Christ talk about kundalini?

01:24:04.584 --> 01:24:07.734
He talked of Holy Ghost.

01:24:07.734 --> 01:24:14.237
But why stick on to that, now I have come
to talk to you.

01:24:14.237 --> 01:24:19.645
Better take your realization; when He came,
they talked of Moses, when Moses came they

01:24:19.645 --> 01:24:20.645
talked of Abraham.

01:24:20.645 --> 01:24:29.574
What about the present, I am with you, why
not have your realization?

01:24:29.574 --> 01:24:34.814
All religions were built for this day, that
you get your realization, to give you the

01:24:34.814 --> 01:24:40.704
balance, to give you that property by which
you ascend.

01:24:40.704 --> 01:24:45.064
Like when we have an aeroplane, we fix it
up properly; in the same way they wanted to

01:24:45.064 --> 01:24:51.574
fix you up, but the religions went astray,
they made people crooked, the things they

01:24:51.574 --> 01:24:56.274
fixed, wrong bolts into wrong places, the
whole aeroplane is in a tattered condition

01:24:56.274 --> 01:24:59.574
if it flies, it will all fall down.

01:24:59.574 --> 01:25:03.124
Better give up all those ideas.

01:25:03.124 --> 01:25:10.284
But kundalini is such a great force, it's
such a great force; it comforts you, it cures

01:25:10.284 --> 01:25:16.874
you, it builds up all your centers and slowly
moves upward and when if you get realization,

01:25:16.874 --> 01:25:20.378
also it goes back, attends to all these problems
that

01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:21.385
you have.

01:25:21.385 --> 01:25:26.485
It's such a mother she is.

01:25:26.485 --> 01:25:29.885
Any other question, please?

01:25:29.885 --> 01:25:34.235
Q. Why are you to be known as Mataji, Mother?

01:25:34.235 --> 01:25:37.445
Shri Mataji: I didn't follow.

01:25:37.445 --> 01:25:41.525
Yogi: Nor did I.

01:25:41.525 --> 01:25:44.955
Why are You to be known as Mataji?

01:25:44.955 --> 01:25:47.355
Shri Mataji: As Shri Mataji?

01:25:58.036 --> 01:26:01.846
That's the title they gave Me, what can I
do?

01:26:01.846 --> 01:26:08.596
In India.

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:11.476
You have to be an Indian to understand that.

01:26:11.476 --> 01:26:18.956
There are certain things described, about
Shri Mataji.

01:26:18.956 --> 01:26:31.846
If you have read any books, of Adi Shankaracharya,
or of Markandeya Himself, then you will know

01:26:31.846 --> 01:26:40.746
and the qualities described there of such
a person, if they find it in someone, they

01:26:40.746 --> 01:26:45.236
call that person by that name, isn't it?

01:26:45.236 --> 01:26:49.796
Like Gandhiji was called as Mahatma Gandhi.

01:26:49.796 --> 01:26:57.086
Mahatma means a bigger spirit than others,
because he had that.

01:26:57.086 --> 01:27:02.816
He didn't care for himself or his own family,
everything for his own, but he thought of

01:27:02.816 --> 01:27:07.946
the whole country; that's why he was called
Mahatma.

01:27:07.946 --> 01:27:18.076
Now, but I didn't call Myself; if others want
to call I think is all right, I have no objection.

01:27:18.076 --> 01:27:23.736
You can call anything, whatever you see, you
can call that.

01:27:23.736 --> 01:27:29.016
By calling that, what is your objection?

01:27:29.016 --> 01:27:31.306
Can I ask you this question?

01:27:31.306 --> 01:27:32.746
Beg pardon?

01:27:32.746 --> 01:27:35.636
[No objection] No objection.

01:27:35.636 --> 01:27:39.256
All right, that's all right.

01:27:39.256 --> 01:27:48.506
See, then it's all right, if you understand
that it is must be some reason also.

01:27:48.506 --> 01:27:52.106
(Further question from same person)

01:27:52.106 --> 01:27:54.816
Q. Do you have some divine power?

01:27:54.816 --> 01:28:00.976
Shri Mataji: That you better find out; I am
not going to be tactless on that.

01:28:00.976 --> 01:28:09.236
Christ said what was the truth, that He was
the Son of God, all right, but they crucified

01:28:09.236 --> 01:28:10.886
Him.

01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:20.556
I don't want to get crucified so soon.

01:28:20.556 --> 01:28:30.956
[INAUDIBLE Q:] But the one who is an Indian,
who is an Indian and Englishman.

01:28:30.956 --> 01:28:33.816
[Hindi].

01:28:33.816 --> 01:28:55.316
You see
it is for an ... Indians understand it better.

01:28:55.316 --> 01:29:10.376
[Hindi]
I'm sorry I'm speaking in Hindi because I

01:29:10.376 --> 01:29:26.446
have to little bit chastise the Indians here,
I hope you don't mind.

01:29:26.446 --> 01:29:27.746
[Hindi]

01:30:30.415 --> 01:30:33.415
Now, what is another question please?

01:30:34.431 --> 01:30:35.700
Yes please?

01:30:35.977 --> 01:30:37.124
Q. Yogi: Mother, she is
900
01:32:18,283 --&gt; 01:30:49,310
asking if you can cure physical ailment, I
mean the answer's yes, that comes from Self-realization,

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:51.003
no question.

01:30:51.028 --> 01:30:57.064
Shri Mataji with your permission, the majority
of people have come for the experience and

01:30:57.170 --> 01:31:04.222
are anxious to have, I may be mistaken, but
I think most people would like to stop questions

01:31:04.247 --> 01:31:04.833
and ...

01:31:04.858 --> 01:31:07.389
Shri Mataji: But sometimes you know those
who want to ask, let them ask, otherwise the

01:31:07.414 --> 01:31:09.225
brain will again put out a question.

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:13.510
Now madam, what is it..?

01:31:16.115 --> 01:31:17.115
(SY.

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:19.855
She's asking You, Mother, what life was like
for You as a child)?

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.593
Shri Mataji: As a child?

01:31:21.618 --> 01:31:26.548
I mean that's another story; you come and
see Me, I'll tell you all about it.

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:35.800
Why do you want to know about My past and
future?

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:42.560
Let us at the present time to get your realization;
makes no difference what I was as a child,

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.850
or what I was as an old woman.

01:31:45.850 --> 01:32:00.080
Yogi: ... She's asking whether you have an
opinion about the growth of interest in spirituality

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.080
in England...

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.920
Shri Mataji: What spirituality?

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:05.750
Yogi asks questioner: spiritualism or spirituality?

01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:07.170
Questioner answers: spiritualism.

01:32:07.170 --> 01:32:11.600
Shri Mataji: That's the witchcraft, revived;
very, very dangerous.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:19.930
Ah, is very dangerous, never go near that,
all this parapsychology and all those things.

01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:23.060
We have described all these things in our
book; you can have a look at it.

01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:25.380
Is a very comprehensive thing, Sahaja Yoga
is.

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:30.570
Is the witchcraft, you may call it spirituality,
because a spirit can be also a dead soul as

01:32:30.570 --> 01:32:32.320
I told you, in English language.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:35.045
There is no 'ism' about God.

01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:37.589
It's infinite.

01:32:38.775 --> 01:32:49.690
'Isms' are all finite things.

01:32:49.690 --> 01:33:19.470
Q. SY: she's praising Your lecture, Mother,
and saying now that....she'll go back to read

01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:20.470
Blake again.

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:23.310
Shri Mataji: I'm very happy, I'm very happy
that you say that, madam, it's really such

01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:27.860
a great poet, but you'll be surprised in India,
none of them brought Blake.

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:33.370
We never read Blake there, never; you see
we studied English language, we studied Shakespeare,

01:33:33.370 --> 01:33:38.220
we studied so many things, but never they
mentioned Blake, you know.

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:39.220
I don't know why.

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:44.410
In the whole education system of India, they
never mentioned Blake.

01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:52.760
[another inaudible question ...]
Shri Mataji: That's very nice, such books

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:53.820
you must read.

01:33:53.820 --> 01:34:00.070
Such books you must read.

01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:23.550
[Here someone disclaims in Sanskrit]
You see there's a Sanskrit scholar here, but

01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:27.250
the greatest Guru is the Mother, don't you
think so?

01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:31.921
The Mother is the Guru of the gurus.

01:34:31.946 --> 01:34:37.450
But it's very difficult, because guru is a
hard stuff, you see.

01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:44.410
A mother has to be very soft, kind, gentle
to manage the show, but the guru can be very

01:34:44.410 --> 01:34:56.523
hard and they are very hard people, but Mother
as a guru is a difficult task, it's very enjoyable.

01:34:56.548 --> 01:35:03.050
Now I have given at least eleven lectures
on Guru tattwa, all right?

01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:07.612
So you can take tapes from them, you can read
it and you will enjoy it very well.

01:35:07.834 --> 01:35:15.280
Here the Guru tattwa is expressed in the Void,
there, where the ten Gurus actually incarnated

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:17.830
basically and they reincarnated.

01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:27.480
Say we can start from Adi Nath, then we can
come to other ones like Nanaka, Janaka.

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:32.660
Janaka was much earlier, then we can say Abraham,
Moses.

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:41.010
All these were Guru tattwa, Socrates, all
these were Guru tattwa people, the people

01:35:41.010 --> 01:35:47.104
who came as Prophets; the ones who came on
this earth to teach us balance, to teach us

01:35:47.129 --> 01:35:48.485
the code of life.

01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:52.070
That was also important part, but that was
forgot.

01:35:52.226 --> 01:35:53.226
Why?

01:35:53.251 --> 01:35:55.671
Why the code, why the religion?

01:35:55.696 --> 01:36:00.340
Religion is for the ascent, to build you up.

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:06.140
Q. ?Tattwa
Shri Mataji: Tattwam assi, that's what is

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:14.022
the tattwa there; tattwa is there; tattwa
is nothing but your kundalini is your tattwa,

01:36:14.047 --> 01:36:17.287
is the principle....

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:30.550
Q: [INAUDIBLE] Parvati, Shiva; She's also
called as Kundalini.

01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:33.990
Shri Mataji: Of course.

01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:37.980
Yes, yes, it is all over, same thing.

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:40.220
I'm just giving you the gist of it.

01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:51.880
SY: She's asking, Mother, who was Mother Durga,
she's asking about who was Mother Durga?

01:36:51.880 --> 01:37:00.030
Shri Mataji: A very direct question; I told
you, I'm very tactful, I'm not going to confess

01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:01.660
anything.

01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:05.320
You better find out, it's better to find out.

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.850
It's nice, isn't it?

01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:10.700
To find out yourself.

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:20.050
Yogi: ...I'll explain, Mother, the program
is that tonight will be the experience of

01:37:20.050 --> 01:37:26.190
realization and we have another program on
Saturday evening, here in the same place,

01:37:26.190 --> 01:37:31.070
which will be for this knowledge part; after
realization, the knowledge makes more sense,

01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:34.040
so it's better to get the experience...

01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:39.211
Shri Mataji: But our experience is very funny,
I must tell you that for My program, even

01:37:39.211 --> 01:37:47.103
if there may be one thousand people, for getting
realization, after that they just get lost,

01:37:47.128 --> 01:37:48.268
never grow.

01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:57.410
That's only more in England, they just don't
... they'll get lost, I think they must be

01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:59.110
going to the pub after that.

01:37:59.110 --> 01:38:04.890
I can't explain why it happens but they just
get lost, they don't want to know anything

01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:05.890
anymore.

01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:10.400
I don't know why, I cannot explain, I mean,
is something I cannot explain.

01:38:10.425 --> 01:38:13.425
All right, let's have it now.

01:38:13.551 --> 01:38:22.621
So now, if we are all settled down, it's very
simple, Sahaj also means simple, Sahaj; saha

01:38:22.621 --> 01:38:29.351
means 'with' ja means 'born'; is born with
you, this right to get this union, this yoga,

01:38:29.351 --> 01:38:33.891
is born with you, is within you and is the
living process of the living God so it is

01:38:33.891 --> 01:38:34.931
spontaneous.

01:38:34.931 --> 01:38:41.141
Everything that is living is spontaneous and
should happen to all of you, no doubt about

01:38:41.141 --> 01:38:43.121
it.

01:38:43.121 --> 01:38:48.311
You don't have to do anything as I said but
you have to receive the power within yourself,

01:38:48.311 --> 01:38:52.451
to invite the kundalini to rise.

01:38:52.451 --> 01:38:57.161
Now first thing I have to request, I hope
it is not too much of it, that we have to

01:38:57.161 --> 01:38:59.071
take out our shoes to touch the Mother Earth.

01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:04.741
Is very important because the Mother Earth
is the one which sucks in, for a while.

01:39:04.741 --> 01:39:10.051
I don't know, is there a carpet there?

01:39:10.051 --> 01:39:27.741
Be in a mood of reception, and also of well-being,
in a happy mood, because this is the greatest

01:39:27.741 --> 01:39:41.001
moment of our lives.

01:39:41.001 --> 01:39:48.151
Now as I said that these fingers, here five,
six and seven, on the same way this way, represent

01:39:48.151 --> 01:39:56.231
the two sides of the chakras within us, the
sympathetic sides, so we have to put our hands

01:39:56.231 --> 01:40:03.761
like this, just like this, simple as that.

01:40:03.761 --> 01:40:09.511
And sit, not crossed legged but putting both
the feet with respect, towards the Mother

01:40:09.511 --> 01:40:15.371
Earth, in parallel to each other.

01:40:15.371 --> 01:40:20.221
Now maybe some of you must have started feeling
the cool breeze, I don't know, might have,

01:40:20.221 --> 01:40:24.371
because today's lecture was rather too terrific
and William Blake must have worked it out

01:40:24.371 --> 01:40:28.161
I'm sure.

01:40:28.161 --> 01:40:31.051
But otherwise is very simple.

01:40:31.051 --> 01:40:36.691
Now we have to do is to ourselves awaken our
own kundalini, which is very simple, which

01:40:36.691 --> 01:40:38.021
I will tell you.

01:40:38.021 --> 01:40:43.651
In the heart resides the spirit so first we'll
have to put our hand to our heart.

01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:46.451
I will tell you one by one.

01:40:46.451 --> 01:40:51.282
And then in the upper part of your stomach
where the guru tattwa is here, the principle

01:40:51.282 --> 01:40:53.471
of guru is there.

01:40:53.471 --> 01:41:11.051
Then in the lower part of the abdomen, where
it is the divine, or we can say the pure knowledge

01:41:11.051 --> 01:41:13.801
that exists and which works.

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:21.491
This is the center through which the pure
knowledge, the pure technique, works.

01:41:21.491 --> 01:41:36.401
Then we take this hand again back, same way,
up to this point where, it is here, when we

01:41:36.401 --> 01:41:40.901
are guilty we catch this chakra.

01:41:40.901 --> 01:41:48.111
Now here works our self-confidence, our faith
in God that He forgives us.

01:41:48.111 --> 01:41:56.461
Then we put our hand on top of our head - this
is the Agnya Chakra, which is very important.

01:41:56.461 --> 01:42:03.161
Here we forgive everyone; then at the back
of the Agnya Chakra again, where we have to

01:42:03.161 --> 01:42:06.971
say that, "If we done any mistake, oh God
forgive us".

01:42:06.971 --> 01:42:10.031
These are the two sides of the Agnya Chakra.

01:42:10.031 --> 01:42:17.331
And then you put your hand, stretch it, put
this part on the fontanel bone area, the soft

01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:25.971
bone which was on top of our head and press
it hard and move it hard, for a while.

01:42:25.971 --> 01:42:27.071
That's all one has to do.

01:42:27.071 --> 01:42:28.981
I'll tell you one by one.

01:42:28.981 --> 01:42:35.061
First and foremost thing is, we have to close
our eyes, because eyes take out our attention;

01:42:35.061 --> 01:42:42.051
but attention will be sucked inside our body
in the sense it will go through the - just

01:42:42.051 --> 01:42:47.661
like this cloth - it is spread out, but as
kundalini rises, She sucks it in and then

01:42:47.661 --> 01:42:55.071
pierces through this attention, enlight[en]ing
all of that.

01:42:55.071 --> 01:42:59.721
It's a happening that takes place without
any trouble whatsoever.

01:42:59.721 --> 01:43:08.011
As a result of that, what you get is the cool
breeze coming out of your head; you can also

01:43:08.011 --> 01:43:17.751
feel the cool breeze in your fingertips; then
later on in your hands and you get that shine

01:43:17.751 --> 01:43:19.801
on your skin.

01:43:19.801 --> 01:43:26.841
Christ has said, "The face that does not shine
cannot become the star."

01:43:26.841 --> 01:43:32.921
And then you get that glint of shine of the
spirit in your eyes.

01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:43.031
That's all, is not the point, is much, much,
much, much more but just a wee bit that we

01:43:43.031 --> 01:43:49.691
have to today testify and later on to find
out have we got realization all right, then

01:43:49.691 --> 01:43:56.541
can we work it out, can we do this, because
later on we have to play our role now as a

01:43:56.541 --> 01:44:00.771
spiritual being, that's the point one has
to understand.

01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:09.211
So now, have respect for yourself first of
all; and not to feel guilty at all.

01:44:09.211 --> 01:44:16.871
You are the temple of God, really believe
Me you are made that way, only the light is

01:44:16.871 --> 01:44:20.391
to be kindled and that is in your heart.

01:44:20.391 --> 01:44:25.751
When the kundalini rises, she's something
like an energy that does that because when

01:44:25.751 --> 01:44:33.371
she pierces through, this is the place where
the God Almighty resides, who is reflected

01:44:33.371 --> 01:44:45.101
in our heart as the spirit and the all-pervading
power, which is the Primordial Mother, the

01:44:45.101 --> 01:44:53.062
Holy Ghost, this vibrations that you feel,
the power of God, the love of God which is

01:44:53.062 --> 01:45:03.231
represented within us as the kundalini, rises
and unites us, our attention to the Divine.

01:45:03.231 --> 01:45:12.371
The spirit enlightens the attention and by
that enlightenment you know, on your fingertips,

01:45:12.371 --> 01:45:18.511
on your central nervous system, through your
new collective consciousness about yourself

01:45:18.511 --> 01:45:19.781
and about others.

01:45:19.781 --> 01:45:28.611
Through Sahaja Yoga you know how to cure,
improve, and through this happening, through

01:45:28.611 --> 01:45:36.701
the spirit you enjoy because spirit - the
nature of spirit is satchidanand, means it

01:45:36.701 --> 01:45:44.061
is the truth, it becomes the attention and
it is the source of joy.

01:45:44.061 --> 01:45:51.261
Without getting realization you can be happy
and unhappy but you cannot be joy, which has

01:45:51.261 --> 01:45:52.951
no dualism.

01:45:52.951 --> 01:45:55.341
You become the source of joy.

01:45:55.341 --> 01:46:03.531
Such a person, when he meets someone; he sees
someone, he looks at someone, just a kataksh

01:46:03.531 --> 01:46:11.241
is sufficient to raise the kundalini - just
a glance is sufficient to cure that person;

01:46:11.241 --> 01:46:16.391
just a thought, can give comfort to the other
person.

01:46:16.391 --> 01:46:21.651
Miracles after miracles, so many miracles
that as Sahaja yogis say, "miracle' has lost

01:46:21.651 --> 01:46:25.391
its meaning Mother, in Sahaja Yoga," that's
true.

01:46:25.391 --> 01:46:32.421
So miracles of miracles and every moment you
feel that God is looking after you.

01:46:32.421 --> 01:46:45.801
When this great volcano burst, exploded in
Mexico, a miracle happened they say, that

01:46:45.801 --> 01:46:48.291
the children were saved.

01:46:48.291 --> 01:46:57.191
The wrath - no this was not in Mexico but
later on more in Colombia, because Colombia

01:46:57.191 --> 01:47:04.151
is sending all kinds of these horrible things
all over the world, making money out of it.

01:47:04.151 --> 01:47:13.381
The wrath of the Mother Earth poured that
mud and the people were drowned but the children

01:47:13.381 --> 01:47:14.381
survived.

01:47:14.381 --> 01:47:18.431
Their heads were above the mud, the body inside
the mud.

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:24.161
The same Mother Earth looked after them because
they should not be burned so She covered them

01:47:24.161 --> 01:47:26.671
with the mud, why?

01:47:26.671 --> 01:47:29.931
Because of the innocence in them.

01:47:29.931 --> 01:47:36.081
Those who have even the slightest innocence
in them will become realized souls, no doubt

01:47:36.081 --> 01:47:41.151
about it - slightest, a very wee bit.

01:47:41.151 --> 01:47:46.931
All the seekers are a special category of
people and they have to become realized souls.

01:47:46.931 --> 01:47:51.361
So forget about the past, forget whatever
you have done in your seeking, whatever you

01:47:51.361 --> 01:47:59.081
are told, whatever you are branded with, just
forget it and forgive yourself, once for all.

01:47:59.081 --> 01:48:03.701
This is I am telling you this because this
is one of the biggest problems of the West

01:48:03.701 --> 01:48:09.771
that everybody sits down with a bad, horrible
trouble here and sometimes I feel it so much

01:48:09.771 --> 01:48:12.821
that I can't even hear people.

01:48:12.821 --> 01:48:13.821
Is terrible.

01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:20.851
This portion is so bad here so I have to request
you that please forgive yourself.

01:48:20.851 --> 01:48:27.681
You are the glory of God, without you God
has no meaning also.

01:48:27.681 --> 01:48:32.231
It is He who is anxious, much more then you
are, to give you realization.

01:48:32.231 --> 01:48:33.981
Just help Him out a little.

01:48:33.981 --> 01:48:34.981
All right.

01:48:34.981 --> 01:48:35.981
Let us see.

01:48:35.981 --> 01:48:41.631
So we put our both the hands like this, close
our eyes.

01:48:41.631 --> 01:48:47.921
Now you have to keep the left hand all the
time towards Me, because is the desire, is

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:52.391
expressed through it is the power of desire
in the left hand which expresses that you

01:48:52.391 --> 01:48:53.521
want to have realization.

01:48:53.521 --> 01:48:58.941
The right hand is the power of action so you
move your right hand but don't open your eyes.

01:48:58.941 --> 01:49:06.371
You have to keep your eyes all the time shut,
just the opposite of mesmerism as you can

01:49:06.371 --> 01:49:07.491
see.

01:49:07.491 --> 01:49:26.431
Now please close your eyes; now put your right
hand on your heart.

01:49:26.431 --> 01:49:37.941
Now here you have to say, or ask Me a question,
"Mother am I the spirit?"

01:49:37.941 --> 01:49:41.451
You may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever
suits you.

01:49:41.451 --> 01:49:46.271
"Mother am I the spirit?" is a fundamental
question and if you are a computer it will

01:49:46.271 --> 01:49:47.271
answer.

01:49:47.271 --> 01:49:49.241
"Mother am I the spirit?"

01:49:49.241 --> 01:49:51.511
Ask the question three times please.

01:49:51.511 --> 01:50:01.971
Put your left hand properly, please close
your eyes; everybody should do it, please.

01:50:01.971 --> 01:50:09.831
It's uncivil not to close your eyes; please
close your eyes because others may feel self-conscious

01:50:09.831 --> 01:50:20.381
so please close your eyes, to be courteous.

01:50:20.381 --> 01:50:27.181
Now you have to take down your right hand
on the upper part of your stomach, on the

01:50:27.181 --> 01:50:31.231
left hand side, we are working only on the
left hand side.

01:50:31.231 --> 01:50:37.451
Here is the principle of the master.

01:50:37.451 --> 01:50:42.291
If you are the spirit, automatically you have
to ask the second question, "Mother am I my

01:50:42.291 --> 01:50:44.511
own master?

01:50:44.511 --> 01:50:46.641
Mother am I my own guru?"

01:50:46.641 --> 01:50:53.861
Please ask this question, you have to ask
this question three times again, without fear,

01:50:53.861 --> 01:51:09.091
with all confidence you ask this question,
you are the spirit, you are your master.

01:51:09.091 --> 01:51:18.591
Now move your right hand on the lower part
of your abdomen on the left hand side, lower

01:51:18.591 --> 01:51:20.931
part of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:51:20.931 --> 01:51:30.731
This is the center of the divine work, of
the divine knowledge or the pure knowledge,

01:51:30.731 --> 01:51:35.481
of the technique of divine manifestation.

01:51:35.481 --> 01:51:45.282
At this point I cannot force you to do anything,
as I told you, you have to be free, I can

01:51:45.282 --> 01:51:52.121
only request you and here I say that you have
to ask for the divine knowledge, you have

01:51:52.121 --> 01:52:00.201
to ask for the pure knowledge and when you
ask for it the kundalini will start moving.

01:52:00.201 --> 01:52:08.881
Here with sincere heart, in a humble way you
have to say, "Mother may I have the pure knowledge,

01:52:08.881 --> 01:52:13.941
Mother may I have the divine technique?"

01:52:13.941 --> 01:52:38.141
Ask this question six times because this center
has got six petals.

01:52:38.141 --> 01:53:04.851
Now to make the way easy for kundalini, we
go along the same centers upwards so you put

01:53:04.851 --> 01:53:12.601
your right hand on the upper part of your
abdomen, to make it easy for the kundalini

01:53:12.601 --> 01:53:26.681
to rise you have to open this center by asserting,
by saying "Mother I am my own master", by

01:53:26.681 --> 01:53:52.151
saying "Mother I am my own master", ten times
because there are ten petals, ten Sat gurus

01:53:52.151 --> 01:54:24.391
basically who incarnate ten times, of Prophets,
the Masters.

01:54:24.391 --> 01:54:30.391
Now raise your right hand on your heart, press
it.

01:54:30.391 --> 01:54:44.051
With the same confidence you have to say twelve
times "Mother I am the spirit, I am the spirit,

01:54:44.051 --> 01:54:47.601
I am the spirit".

01:54:47.601 --> 01:55:04.081
Just assert, that's a fact, that's the truth.

01:55:04.081 --> 01:55:14.771
Press it with your fingers.

01:55:14.771 --> 01:55:26.411
Now, twelve times, have full confidence in
you, believe Me you are the spirit, you have

01:55:26.411 --> 01:55:32.301
to just become in the sense it has to come
in your attention on to your central nervous

01:55:32.301 --> 01:55:58.761
system.

01:55:58.761 --> 01:56:10.971
Now raise the right hand on the left hand
side of your neck, in the corner where the

01:56:10.971 --> 01:56:15.841
neck and the shoulder meet, press it hard,
take it backwards, press it hard.

01:56:15.841 --> 01:56:21.271
This is the most difficult center in the West,
as I told you, that we feel guilty all the

01:56:21.271 --> 01:56:32.231
time but as I have told you, God is the ocean
of love, ocean of compassion, but above all

01:56:32.231 --> 01:56:34.371
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:56:34.371 --> 01:56:38.031
He's the ocean of forgiveness.

01:56:38.031 --> 01:56:46.951
When He's the ocean of forgiveness, what guilt
can we have that He cannot wash away or dissolve

01:56:46.951 --> 01:56:47.951
it?

01:56:47.951 --> 01:56:55.051
So just you have to say sixteen times because
there are sixteen petals, to say sixteen times

01:56:55.051 --> 01:57:00.161
with full belief in yourself, "Mother I'm
not guilty, Mother, I'm not guilty, Mother,

01:57:00.161 --> 01:57:48.541
I'm not guilty" sixteen times will you please
say that "Shri Mataji I'm not guilty".

01:57:48.541 --> 01:57:53.381
If you still feel you are guilty and you can't
forgive yourself, better say it to punish

01:57:53.381 --> 01:58:09.771
yourself hundred and eight times, if that
pleases you.

01:58:09.771 --> 01:58:31.231
When you forgive yourself you have to forgive
others and so the greatest message of Christ,

01:58:31.231 --> 01:58:39.081
that we have to forgive others you have to
put your hand to the center which is the adornment

01:58:39.081 --> 01:58:46.721
or we should say which adorns Christ, on the
Agnya Chakra on your forehead, please put

01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:49.141
your right hand across,.

01:58:49.141 --> 01:59:05.491
Press it hard and here you have to say with
full belief in yourself and in your powers

01:59:05.491 --> 01:59:11.811
that, "Shri Mataji I forgive everyone".

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:16.891
Some may say that's very difficult but what
do we do when we forgive or not forgive - no

01:59:16.891 --> 01:59:18.051
logic in it.

01:59:18.051 --> 01:59:28.081
But when we say that, then we are out of the
clutches of other people, so please say, "Shri

01:59:28.081 --> 01:59:30.931
Mataji I forgive everyone.

01:59:30.931 --> 01:59:50.701
Now say it with your whole heart, how many
times is not the point, please say it with

01:59:50.701 --> 01:59:51.701
your whole heart.

01:59:51.701 --> 01:59:56.701
Now you move your hand backwards onto the
back side of the same center - Agnya - press

01:59:56.701 --> 01:59:58.541
it hard.

01:59:58.541 --> 02:00:09.661
Now here, you have to say once only without
feeling guilty at all, without feeling no

02:00:09.661 --> 02:00:17.491
remorse, no condemnation, to God, one for
your satisfaction, "Oh Lord, if I have done

02:00:17.491 --> 02:00:26.081
anything wrong, please forgive me" but don't
feel guilty, that's very important.

02:00:26.081 --> 02:00:36.811
Even without saying He has forgiven you.

02:00:36.811 --> 02:00:39.021
Better.

02:00:39.021 --> 02:00:46.632
Now raise your right hand on top of your head,
stretch your ... stretch your palm, press

02:00:46.632 --> 02:00:55.741
it hard on the fontanel bone area, which was
the soft bone in your childhood, press it

02:00:55.741 --> 02:00:57.891
hard, move it seven times.

02:00:57.891 --> 02:01:02.451
Again here I cannot force anything on you.

02:01:02.451 --> 02:01:09.721
You have to say that you want your Self-realization
that, "Mother, please give us our realization.

02:01:09.721 --> 02:01:11.971
We want our Self-realization.

02:01:11.971 --> 02:01:20.361
Please give me my Self-realization" and press
it hard and move it seven times and say that.

02:01:20.361 --> 02:01:34.721
I'm sure it will work out.

02:01:34.721 --> 02:02:15.411
Now bring down your hand, slowly, and bend
your head a little bit and feel with your

02:02:15.411 --> 02:02:38.811
left hand if there's a cool breeze coming
out of your fontanel bone area.

02:02:38.811 --> 02:02:43.681
Try to bend your head a little, little bit
and about four inches above the head, bend

02:02:43.681 --> 02:02:48.101
it a little, that works out better sometimes.

02:02:48.101 --> 02:03:01.641
With your left hand, right hand towards Me
and with the left hand you see the breeze.

02:03:01.641 --> 02:03:06.331
Right hand towards Me and then with the left
hand you see, you can feel it better, with

02:03:06.331 --> 02:03:11.201
the left hand on top of your head; first with
the left hand.

02:03:11.201 --> 02:03:12.621
Aah.

02:03:12.621 --> 02:03:19.971
Now put the left hand towards Me and with
the right hand just see if it is blowing because

02:03:19.971 --> 02:03:22.071
it should come in both the hands.

02:03:22.071 --> 02:03:30.831
Open your eyes, open slowly and watch Me without
thinking.

02:03:30.831 --> 02:03:42.161
Let us see if you can do it - just without
thinking, just watch Me, without thinking.

02:03:42.161 --> 02:03:52.641
There's no thought in your mind, no thought.

02:03:52.641 --> 02:04:03.471
Now just put your hands like this, are you
feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

02:04:03.471 --> 02:04:09.461
Now put your hands up in the air, like this,
and in your heart ask a question, "Is this

02:04:09.461 --> 02:04:11.611
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

02:04:11.611 --> 02:04:17.361
Ask the question, put it up nicely, ask the
question three times: "Is this the cool breeze

02:04:17.361 --> 02:04:19.051
of the Holy Ghost?

02:04:19.051 --> 02:04:21.961
Is this the brahma shakti?

02:04:21.961 --> 02:04:26.361
Is this the all-pervading power of God?

02:04:26.361 --> 02:04:31.101
Ask the question.

02:04:31.101 --> 02:04:39.691
Now put down your hands and see for yourself
if you feel the cool breeze.

02:04:39.691 --> 02:04:50.201
All those who have felt the cool breeze on
the head, coming out of the head, or on their

02:04:50.201 --> 02:05:00.911
fingertips or in the hands please raise your
hands, both the hands.

02:05:00.911 --> 02:05:01.911
That's Blake.

02:05:01.911 --> 02:05:03.391
You all have become Blake.

02:05:03.391 --> 02:05:07.221
May God bless you.

02:05:07.221 --> 02:05:08.541
So many.

02:05:08.541 --> 02:05:09.701
May God bless you.

02:05:09.701 --> 02:05:15.611
But I must warn you, after this don't talk
about it because it is beyond reasoning.

02:05:15.611 --> 02:05:22.061
Secondly you must come back, must all of you
come back and work it out.

02:05:22.061 --> 02:05:27.351
Those who haven't got realization will also
receive it.

02:05:27.351 --> 02:05:30.571
Those who have got it, will establish it.

02:05:30.571 --> 02:05:31.961
Please come back.

02:05:31.961 --> 02:05:40.161
You will enjoy the silence, the stillness
within.

02:05:40.161 --> 02:05:42.961
But that's just the beginning of it.

02:05:42.961 --> 02:05:45.221
We have to go further.

02:05:45.221 --> 02:05:50.221
Otherwise you won't be able to manifest it
properly.

02:05:50.221 --> 02:05:51.801
It has to be looked after.

02:05:51.801 --> 02:06:01.458
It's just a shoot that has come out, a little
shoot we have to look after it.

02:06:01.483 --> 02:06:04.483
May God bless you all.

02:06:04.588 --> 02:06:09.818
Thank-you very much.

02:06:09.818 --> 02:06:29.250
Why not sing Jerusalem to them ... will be
good idea.

02:06:29.275 --> 02:06:36.422
Yogi: Mother with Your permission the music
group would like to sing one song for You

02:06:36.463 --> 02:06:41.541
but before that we have a little memento of
this evening which we would like to present.

02:06:41.761 --> 02:06:44.144
Shri Mataji: You want to sing, all right?

02:06:44.169 --> 02:06:47.246
You have all the arrangements here.

02:06:47.271 --> 02:06:48.271
All right.

02:06:48.271 --> 02:06:51.206
If you don't mind, just sit down for five
minutes.

02:06:52.041 --> 02:06:57.366
Yogi: So Garuda take wing.

02:07:37.244 --> 02:07:43.097
While we were preparing the program of Blake's
Birthday Festival Mother, we found out there

02:07:43.097 --> 02:07:50.862
was an Exhibition of Blake's work in London
in one of the galleries and we very much wanted

02:07:50.887 --> 02:07:59.574
to give You something that was made by His
own Hands and with the good wishes of all

02:07:59.599 --> 02:08:04.689
the Sahaja yogis of England we've been able
to do it for You.

02:08:04.714 --> 02:08:07.942
Shri Mataji: Oh that's too much, that's too
much Gavin, that's too much.

02:08:07.967 --> 02:08:14.221
Yogi: No it's something special Mother, we
hope that it'll be our pledge to try to do

02:08:14.246 --> 02:08:19.141
some justice to You as You've tried to do
some justice to Blake.

02:08:19.166 --> 02:08:21.061
Shri Mataji: I'm so proud of Him, really.

02:08:21.086 --> 02:08:24.843
Can you - I am not good at opening.
