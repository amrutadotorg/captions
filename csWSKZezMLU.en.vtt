00:02.583 --> 00:04.041
Happy Diwali!

00:13.417 --> 00:16.333
Wish you all a very happy Diwali!

00:27.000 --> 00:30.375
You have seen these different types of dances,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.999
understand one thing from them

00:36.750 --> 00:39.792
that whoever has written it or said it,

00:40.458 --> 00:43.166
they are all saying the same thing.

00:44.875 --> 00:47.208
The greatest thing that they said was

00:49.125 --> 00:51.291
that the Paramatma is One.

00:55.458 --> 00:58.417
They had incarnated in different forms, avatars,

00:58.917 --> 01:00.709
but the Paramatma is one.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.959
There were no disputes amongst them,

01:06.750 --> 01:11.750
they came in this world for the destruction of evil

01:12.750 --> 01:15.999
and killing the wicked people;

01:17.625 --> 01:20.333
and this is happening.

01:20.417 --> 01:26.417
I am seeing everywhere

01:27.709 --> 01:32.583
that these evil people are getting exposed

01:33.999 --> 01:36.583
and now it is your duty too,

01:38.583 --> 01:41.542
to see that all those who are evil,

01:41.583 --> 01:46.709
those who are working against the Paramatma and

01:47.125 --> 01:50.917
who are ready to do anything for the sake of earning money,

01:51.291 --> 01:55.125
all of them go to hell.

01:56.166 --> 02:02.166
We do not know how many Hells there are!

02:03.667 --> 02:08.750
The place where you are all sitting now

02:10.375 --> 02:12.625
is very much away from hell.

02:13.709 --> 02:16.166
There is no relation with hell at all.

02:17.750 --> 02:22.208
But staying here,

02:24.542 --> 02:27.667
if you perform unreligious deeds, do wrong things

02:28.500 --> 02:31.000
then you too can go to hell.

02:32.750 --> 02:36.542
There are many types of hells and

02:37.250 --> 02:39.959
the arrangements to go there are also very nicely done.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.417
Because those who are going there,

02:44.792 --> 02:47.875
do not even know where they are going.

02:49.041 --> 02:54.875
Those who remain behind go to Heaven.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.667
Nobody on this earthly abode even knows

03:00.834 --> 03:03.041
that they may even go to Hell.

03:04.333 --> 03:07.041
Doing wrong deeds would land us in Hell.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.250
The meaning of Diwali itself is that

03:13.166 --> 03:15.458
the way the lamps are lit outside,

03:15.999 --> 03:19.250
you too should be enlightened within

03:23.250 --> 03:31.125
In this dark world you see, you are the lights,

03:32.041 --> 03:37.208
you are the lamps and you have to give the light.

03:38.417 --> 03:41.333
But if you are not internally enlightened enough

03:42.333 --> 03:45.333
then how can you give out light?

03:45.750 --> 03:47.959
Realise this.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.709
So first of all, you Sahaja Yogis

03:51.625 --> 03:56.166
should get properly enlightened internally

03:58.041 --> 04:00.709
and may be it is for this purpose alone

04:01.291 --> 04:04.166
that we have come into this world.

04:04.792 --> 04:09.000
Until Jesus Christ, nobody even spoke about this.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.417
At Agnya chakra He came

04:13.875 --> 04:23.667
and showed that he did not have any ego whatsoever.

04:24.250 --> 04:27.917
He was the son of the Almighty, still he had no ego.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.875
The people who had come before him

04:32.458 --> 04:36.083
revealed a little but Christ

04:36.709 --> 04:43.625
only wanted that our Agnya chakra should be cleared and

04:46.083 --> 04:49.500
that Agnya chakra seems to be very much caught up in Delhi.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.458
What is the reason for this?

04:56.458 --> 04:58.625
The English people lived here before

05:00.667 --> 05:03.917
and they taught us to be egoistic.

05:06.959 --> 05:10.333
This is quite evident in your talk and behaviour.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.291
We have seen those days too

05:13.750 --> 05:16.333
when our country was not independent

05:17.917 --> 05:22.333
but you people are liberated now.

05:23.125 --> 05:24.959
Now we are independent.

05:26.542 --> 05:29.875
And what is Swatantra, Know the Swa – oneself

05:31.792 --> 05:34.166
and the one who has the “Swa” Self knowledge,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.125
then he also has the knowledge of the “tantra”

05:37.583 --> 05:38.542
instrument of “Swa” oneself.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.750
Through Sahaja Yoga you have known yourself

05:41.208 --> 05:45.917
and you know that you are the “tantra” instrument and

05:47.500 --> 05:50.417
that you need to follow the path of Self Knowledge.

05:53.041 --> 05:57.291
It can be seen that there has been a lot of development in Delhi.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.959
Outside Delhi too there has been a lot of development.

06:06.208 --> 06:10.750
You all know what the problem is with the people over here,

06:10.834 --> 06:11.917
I need not tell you.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.875
But now you have become independent,

06:16.250 --> 06:19.417
so you have to see that you don't have these problems.

06:22.417 --> 06:26.500
The first problem is that your Agnya chakra is catching.

06:30.834 --> 06:34.999
Christ was crucified and killed,

06:36.875 --> 06:40.625
but still we have not yet learnt from it.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.166
On the contrary, people from the Christian countries

06:44.667 --> 06:47.250
are highly egoistic

06:48.542 --> 06:50.834
and they have influenced us also.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.917
But the worst thing here is that

06:59.291 --> 07:05.959
we have not yet recognized each other.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.333
There are fights and disputes everywhere.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.166
There are quarrels going on,

07:12.834 --> 07:15.333
there is no purity of mind.

07:16.583 --> 07:21.583
First of all we should purify our minds.

07:22.834 --> 07:24.625
With Sahaja Yoga everything is possible

07:25.625 --> 07:27.583
and can take people to such great heights.

07:28.999 --> 07:32.709
It is not necessary for anyone to go and sit in the Himalayas.

07:33.375 --> 07:36.999
You can do this in the city of Delhi itself.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.417
But if you look around

07:39.709 --> 07:42.208
you will see egoistic people everywhere

07:43.083 --> 07:45.291
and their Agnya chakra is caught up very severely.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.667
So it is very difficult.

07:48.458 --> 07:51.999
Now God has sent one new thing and that is “CANCER”.

07:53.999 --> 07:59.500
If you get cancer and your Agnya chakra is not clear,

08:01.750 --> 08:03.875
then it cannot be cured

08:05.250 --> 08:07.166
and then a big tragedy will take place.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.375
So, one who has cancer

08:11.333 --> 08:13.875
should take to Sahaja Yoga

08:14.291 --> 08:20.333
and clear out the ego within himself.

08:21.041 --> 08:22.999
Wherever there is a Government,

08:23.417 --> 08:26.333
there the people are very egoistic.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.458
We have got so many government servants here

08:32.000 --> 08:35.208
and all of them have enough ego in them.

08:36.291 --> 08:38.500
The people who come from outside

08:39.333 --> 08:42.000
have much more than them

08:42.208 --> 08:45.041
and on top of it they all drink liquor.

08:45.417 --> 08:46.583
You just analyse,

08:46.750 --> 08:48.834
they call themselves Christians and they all drink.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.792
By drinking liquor you are going against yourself.

08:57.500 --> 09:04.417
You are disobeying your Agnya chakra.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.291
You are not obeying it.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.458
The person whose Agnya chakra is clear

09:09.667 --> 09:12.542
cannot drink, he can never drink.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.542
Wherever you look, the people are drinking liquor,

09:19.458 --> 09:22.625
and they have no ways of getting rid of it.

09:23.291 --> 09:25.375
Because when they find they are unable to get rid of it,

09:26.000 --> 09:27.500
again they drink over it.

09:28.333 --> 09:32.709
So addictions of any sort puts us into slavery,

09:32.792 --> 09:34.291
let it be of any kind.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.291
Here, there is addiction to paan

09:40.291 --> 09:42.375
and they will add tobacco also to it.

09:45.500 --> 09:49.834
God has created you with so much of affection

09:50.125 --> 09:51.542
and given you birth in this country

09:52.250 --> 09:55.041
so that you can become unique from rest of the world.

09:55.667 --> 09:58.333
They can be so. Indians are so.

10:00.208 --> 10:04.542
But of late, I find there are a couple of serious ailments.

10:06.917 --> 10:10.834
They are eating money in the place of food.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.333
The roads by which we came now

10:16.417 --> 10:19.625
were not there earlier but it was a pain for me

10:20.583 --> 10:23.250
to see that the roads are in such bad shape

10:23.500 --> 10:27.250
that no one can say that they are new.

10:28.583 --> 10:31.458
Only Indians can do such things.

10:31.959 --> 10:35.667
I have not seen such shameless people in the whole world,

10:37.625 --> 10:41.792
who do such things. And it is not necessary to be so.

10:42.667 --> 10:48.250
Here any time, any person who has the power can do this thing.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.709
First of all, we have to take a resolution today

10:52.999 --> 10:55.083
that we have to clear our Agnya.

10:55.999 --> 10:58.250
The greatest issue at the Agnya is that

10:58.792 --> 11:01.500
we think that we are very superior.

11:02.041 --> 11:08.750
And we start thinking that we can rule the whole world,

11:09.041 --> 11:11.041
and that we can correct the world.

11:11.458 --> 11:12.583
When you yourselves are not correct

11:12.792 --> 11:15.166
then how can you correct this world?

11:15.500 --> 11:17.667
Now, you must have seen many people

11:18.709 --> 11:21.792
who think that they are very great,

11:22.792 --> 11:25.250
but do a lot of wrong things.

11:26.333 --> 11:29.000
In this country people take a lot of money.

11:30.500 --> 11:34.542
Tell me how will God forgive us for this?

11:36.333 --> 11:41.542
The greatest of all sins are stealing and corruption.

11:42.959 --> 11:45.125
The person who commits these types of sins,

11:46.999 --> 11:50.125
whatever he may try, he may do poojas

11:50.750 --> 11:55.542
chant mantras, read Namaz, call out to Allah,

11:56.875 --> 11:59.375
anything, he won't be benefited in any way.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.875
So, today, is a New year for you,

12:03.375 --> 12:04.999
I wish you all

12:05.333 --> 12:08.583
and I want you all to make a resolution

12:10.250 --> 12:16.917
From today onwards, I will not tell lies, never ever lie".

12:16.999 --> 12:22.959
Indians are very famous world wide as liars.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.291
I do not know how but our country carries the stamp

12:28.458 --> 12:29.834
of being dishonest.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.000
Great saints, prophets have taken their birth here.

12:33.959 --> 12:35.625
where so many Sufis were born,

12:37.959 --> 12:40.999
How can people lie in a place like this?

12:42.291 --> 12:44.041
So today, you have to promise

12:44.417 --> 12:45.792
that you will never tell lies,

12:46.291 --> 12:47.417
whatever may be the consequences.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.333
For that you need to have courage.

12:51.625 --> 12:55.125
Now that you are realized what more courage is needed?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.959
As it is you can't lie at all.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.959
It’s only when you become like this,

13:02.333 --> 13:04.667
the people will be able to have faith

13:05.041 --> 13:07.625
that you are really truthful people.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.333
So, the Sahaja Yogis have to be truthful.

13:15.333 --> 13:17.375
Whatever may be one's occupation,

13:18.375 --> 13:23.458
whatever he may do he may be an Engineer laying roads,

13:24.250 --> 13:26.875
he may be a Doctor treating everyone.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.208
If inspite of all this,

13:30.917 --> 13:35.583
if you lie then it would be Hell for you.

13:37.709 --> 13:45.041
That is because you are now transformed.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.750
You are now realized.

13:48.166 --> 13:51.959
So when realized people lie

13:54.375 --> 13:58.333
they cannot benefit from it at all.

14:00.041 --> 14:03.999
When I go abroad, and often hear people say,

14:04.458 --> 14:06.000
that the people of our country are cheaters,

14:06.834 --> 14:11.166
liars and corrupt, I feel very sad.

14:11.959 --> 14:13.792
Today it is very auspicious day for you.

14:14.333 --> 14:15.500
Today let us all make a resolution that

14:15.875 --> 14:18.834
we will never lie, whatever it may be.

14:24.583 --> 14:27.709
I myself am a woman, that too an Indian.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.542
I have never said a lie.

14:31.999 --> 14:36.834
By telling lies it would be a loss for you,

14:40.125 --> 14:43.083
you will be put to loss by doing wrong deeds.

14:45.667 --> 14:49.291
By doing so, you may be earning more

14:50.458 --> 14:51.667
or cheat more

14:53.041 --> 14:58.500
but you cannot go to Heaven, you will go to Hell.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.917
One thing it is very important to know that

15:02.333 --> 15:06.750
we have a very bad reputation in the rest of the world.

15:07.542 --> 15:09.208
Why the bad reputation?

15:10.250 --> 15:12.291
Because, we are such type of people!

15:12.959 --> 15:15.250
When you come to know that someone is a liar,

15:16.875 --> 15:24.083
form an organization and make an enquiry into it.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.709
For example, if a road has been laid

15:27.291 --> 15:29.417
which is not good enough,

15:29.999 --> 15:34.250
then enquire about the amount spent in its laying

15:34.500 --> 15:38.458
and what is being done?

15:39.500 --> 15:41.333
The money that is made out of the road

15:41.709 --> 15:44.999
will only be used for drinking and liquor, which is our enemy!

15:47.792 --> 15:49.750
Why do you want to do it?

15:50.417 --> 15:52.583
You are all very well-to-do people.

15:53.125 --> 15:55.041
I have seen many countries where there are poor people

15:55.667 --> 15:58.291
but they are very honest.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.542
So honesty should be the foremost quality in you.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.125
Today, make a decision that

16:04.375 --> 16:06.417
we will never be dishonest hereafter.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.625
And we will not remain in the company of dishonest people

16:09.458 --> 16:12.333
and if any one is dishonest we will expose him.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.834
Now it is like this, people will say,

16:15.083 --> 16:18.333
“Mother in the Police force too they are like this

16:18.500 --> 16:20.750
and in other departments too they are like that,"

16:21.041 --> 16:22.583
but you are Sahaja Yogis.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.458
Those who are Sahaja Yogis,

16:25.125 --> 16:29.083
are nothing less than any policeman or any person in power.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.333
They are all powerful. But all the powers are of Truth.

16:36.999 --> 16:38.375
Truthfulness should be there

16:39.166 --> 16:40.542
and I am very glad

16:41.000 --> 16:43.709
that a lot of Sahaja Yogis are truthful

16:46.000 --> 16:50.333
but we still need more Sahaja Yogis who are truthful.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.250
Truthfulness has to be there,

16:54.917 --> 16:56.999
otherwise your Agnya chakra will not be cleared.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Agnya, is where the ego resides.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.041
When a person becomes egoistic,

17:07.625 --> 17:09.041
then he commits any kind of mistakes,

17:09.291 --> 17:13.500
he criticizes, harms, gets corrupt

17:14.834 --> 17:17.917
all such people will go to hell.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.375
I want to tell you very clearly,

17:20.667 --> 17:22.792
that you should not take to corruption,

17:23.208 --> 17:24.500
you are not dying.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.000
What have you done by earning more?

17:26.291 --> 17:28.417
What are you doing?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.291
You must have put up a few more lights,

17:31.625 --> 17:36.083
kept a couple of more women, what more than that?

17:37.041 --> 17:41.583
Now, what will be your condition when you go to Hell?

17:42.750 --> 17:45.417
I am discussing all this, on this day of Diwali

17:46.750 --> 17:48.375
because Diwali was celebrated

17:49.500 --> 17:52.834
on the occasion of Sitaji's re-union with Rama.

17:56.166 --> 18:02.542
We can no more be slaves once we embrace chastity.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.999
We are our own slaves and not the slaves of others.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.583
We shall not lie for any reason whatsoever.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.333
I have lived in Delhi for a long time

18:13.208 --> 18:17.709
and am quite surprised at how much they lie.

18:18.041 --> 18:22.625
They are not afraid of lying at all.

18:23.417 --> 18:26.500
By telling lies openly

18:26.917 --> 18:33.000
they might benefit here, they might earn more money,

18:33.458 --> 18:38.041
but it is not known that they will not go to Heaven.

18:38.375 --> 18:41.333
I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise that

18:41.625 --> 18:45.458
neither will they lie nor will they support the people who lie.

18:46.083 --> 18:53.875
People say that our country is very corrupt.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.917
Yes, I have been to far off places and

18:59.667 --> 19:05.000
I have seen that the Russians are the best amongst them.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.917
They are as it is, half like Sahaja Yogis

19:08.667 --> 19:10.542
and a lot of Sahaja Yogis are there.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.792
This year I was not able to go to Russia,

19:14.083 --> 19:16.625
next year I will definitely go.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.750
This means that

19:20.083 --> 19:23.875
we were not able to implement democracy well,

19:26.250 --> 19:29.000
we too should have been communist.

19:29.917 --> 19:32.083
There are no cases of robbery there, no lies

19:33.417 --> 19:35.458
and everyone loves each other.

19:36.166 --> 19:38.083
They respect me a lot.

19:39.333 --> 19:44.125
We have to understand where we are going.

19:44.834 --> 19:48.125
For the sake of earning more money, to what extent will we go?

19:48.917 --> 19:50.709
What are we going to get?

19:51.917 --> 19:55.041
So, honesty should be the foremost quality within you.

19:56.667 --> 20:02.166
Your dishonesty is going to create problems for your own people.

20:02.709 --> 20:05.959
People say that the Indians are dishonest.

20:07.999 --> 20:10.000
I feel ashamed to hear this.

20:10.999 --> 20:14.500
So many great saints have taken birth over here,

20:15.000 --> 20:19.542
how many great prophets have been over here,

20:20.417 --> 20:26.083
and people of this place are great thieves

20:27.208 --> 20:32.542
and they steal and criticize

20:33.959 --> 20:37.750
your Agnya has been scared of all this from beginning itself.

20:38.041 --> 20:39.875
They want to make huge money;

20:40.250 --> 20:42.917
in the end all these rich people will go to Hell.

20:44.792 --> 20:47.375
On this day of Diwali,

20:47.834 --> 20:50.458
I want to tell you all that the meaning of Diwali is that

20:51.000 --> 20:54.542
the Hell is full of darkness and you all are enlightened.

20:55.625 --> 20:59.333
You are expected to fight wherever there is darkness

21:01.208 --> 21:03.375
and let them know that they are wrong deeds.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.291
By doing this our country will improve

21:07.000 --> 21:09.291
and you have to do this.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.333
We have been performing poojas and rituals

21:12.667 --> 21:16.125
but the Shakti (Divine power) which is there within us,

21:17.083 --> 21:21.542
is there to oppose all that is not truthful.

21:23.208 --> 21:26.625
Many people do not know that making money is a sickness.

21:29.208 --> 21:31.375
They will go straight to Hell.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.792
I am telling you all this

21:34.500 --> 21:37.792
because no one has said it like this before.

21:38.166 --> 21:41.083
On the day of Diwali, I am telling you

21:41.999 --> 21:44.125
that we are going to light lamps and

21:44.625 --> 21:46.959
celebrate happiness in our hearts.

21:47.417 --> 21:51.417
By this we can see what kind of a person one is

21:51.959 --> 21:54.709
is he a person who steals?

21:55.208 --> 21:58.542
As of now too, I can see people fighting with each other.

21:59.041 --> 22:01.458
Quarrels amongst Hindus and Muslims are over now

22:02.083 --> 22:04.667
but fighting with others has started.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.917
That is the second thing- we are quarrelsome too.

22:11.542 --> 22:15.542
At least in the other countries

22:15.792 --> 22:17.542
there are not as many religions as we have.

22:17.834 --> 22:19.875
So whenever we get a chance, we start fighting,

22:22.875 --> 22:24.291
fighting is the priority.

22:25.917 --> 22:29.667
Fighting between husband and wife and then their children and

22:31.333 --> 22:33.125
then if they have someone else with them

22:34.166 --> 22:36.750
they will fight with them too. What is Sahaja Yoga?

22:37.375 --> 22:39.375
Sahaja Yoga is love and only love.

22:40.500 --> 22:44.166
Awaken the power of love which is within us.

22:51.999 --> 22:53.875
Today is a very auspicious day

22:54.792 --> 22:57.583
and we have to light the lamps in our heart

22:58.000 --> 23:02.999
and take up the resolution that we may die but we won't lie.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.125
We had great people over here

23:09.041 --> 23:12.709
but still Indians are very ill-famed the world over

23:13.417 --> 23:16.041
as being very dishonest.

23:16.458 --> 23:18.917
Though I have never seen one of this kind

23:19.250 --> 23:21.583
but whenever I hear of it, I feel very sad.

23:22.583 --> 23:24.667
India is such a holy place

23:25.291 --> 23:28.333
where such great saints have taken their birth,

23:29.458 --> 23:30.792
that didn't happen anywhere, also the sufis

23:31.500 --> 23:32.999
were also born here

23:35.166 --> 23:39.208
So many great saints were born here in India

23:40.583 --> 23:42.875
No other country had so many saints as in India

23:43.875 --> 23:45.834
there could have been a few

23:46.375 --> 23:48.458
but in India we had great saints

23:49.583 --> 23:53.333
that whatever they had taught, leave that.

23:54.250 --> 23:56.458
We have become notorious thieves.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.542
Whoever commits theft, can never go to Heaven.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.834
As compared to the life span spent here,

24:07.500 --> 24:11.458
you will have to spend a thousand times more in the Hell

24:12.500 --> 24:15.083
Today I am talking about hell

24:17.000 --> 24:19.625
because hell means darkness and

24:21.125 --> 24:23.709
we are seeing the spell of darkness everywhere, that of hell.

24:24.375 --> 24:29.417
Now, that your lights are lit, try to see who all are in hell.

24:30.166 --> 24:38.166
You support the Government by exposing the dishonest.

24:38.625 --> 24:41.125
You may be holding a junior or a senior position

24:42.291 --> 24:44.875
still you have to expose the one who is a thief

24:45.750 --> 24:50.542
Catch the thieves, catch those who are dishonest

24:51.291 --> 24:53.917
Now you have got the powers what is it for?

24:55.542 --> 24:57.709
You have been awakened now what is it for?

25:00.959 --> 25:02.750
You have got enlightenment.

25:03.250 --> 25:05.583
You see yourself in its light.

25:06.834 --> 25:08.667
You have seen nothing in the darkness

25:09.417 --> 25:13.417
but see in your light, what you are,

25:14.959 --> 25:19.250
and what are you going to achieve by telling lies?

25:22.083 --> 25:23.500
We are family people,

25:24.041 --> 25:29.625
we never lie - never - and we can't even lie.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.625
Whenever the situation to lie arises

25:34.417 --> 25:36.875
don't forget that you have the powers, you are the lights,

25:38.166 --> 25:42.291
You see, you are the light in this darkness

25:43.041 --> 25:44.834
and keep the lights burning.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.917
We have to end this darkness.

25:47.583 --> 25:49.709
We have a bad reputation for our dishonesty.

25:50.709 --> 25:53.750
There is no country as great as ours,

25:55.041 --> 25:56.750
yet it is very sad to know

25:57.792 --> 26:00.583
that the people outside have misunderstood us.

26:00.999 --> 26:03.959
It is not known what these people achieve by their dishonesty.

26:04.750 --> 26:07.500
What they will get will be horrible!

26:08.250 --> 26:09.291
No one will be spared!

26:11.083 --> 26:13.375
Whoever is dishonest will be caught

26:14.417 --> 26:15.959
and there are arrangements made for it.

26:17.417 --> 26:20.125
You have got realization because you are not dishonest,

26:20.959 --> 26:24.709
you love truthfulness and respect it.

26:25.959 --> 26:29.041
I want you all to stand for truth.

26:30.083 --> 26:36.875
The people who are throwing clutter in Jamunaji are fools.

26:38.959 --> 26:42.083
Jamunaji goes straight down to Hell.

26:43.458 --> 26:50.208
But you will be saved from that Hell.

26:50.583 --> 26:51.709
You are realized souls.

26:52.625 --> 26:54.291
The one who is enlightened never falls.

26:56.750 --> 27:06.417
But if you really want to establish Sahaja Yoga

27:07.834 --> 27:09.291
fully within yourself then you have to first of all decide

27:09.583 --> 27:11.375
never to be dishonest in any way.

27:14.458 --> 27:17.750
Earning money is the only business left in this world!

27:18.667 --> 27:20.417
What happens with that?

27:21.917 --> 27:23.709
Nobody will even remember them.

27:26.875 --> 27:31.875
You have to be truthful if at all you love your country.

27:32.166 --> 27:34.792
Otherwise who is going to believe in a liar's love!

27:37.375 --> 27:41.333
It is a very tough situation for you

27:42.417 --> 27:44.959
when you see that your neighbour is of such a type

27:45.125 --> 27:46.917
and you think that you too should become like that.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.000
On the contrary why don't you think that we are like this

27:49.417 --> 27:51.709
and why not that neighbour too be made like us.

27:53.542 --> 27:57.709
First of all you should promise that you will never be dishonest

27:59.959 --> 28:02.917
nor support any dishonest doers.

28:09.208 --> 28:15.125
It is not known - the thriving of liars is a curse of our country!

28:16.583 --> 28:19.750
There are many people who will tell at least ten lies

28:19.999 --> 28:23.166
from morning till evening, still it won't be enough for them.

28:24.417 --> 28:26.500
Now that your poverty has perished,

28:27.166 --> 28:29.000
all is well, you have everything to eat and drink

28:29.417 --> 28:31.375
and you are not a beggar any more,

28:31.750 --> 28:33.583
then why do you have to lie?

28:37.792 --> 28:38.999
So on this day, take this resolution

28:39.125 --> 28:40.792
we are not going to lie and if anyone is a liar

28:41.250 --> 28:43.083
then we are not going to support that person,

28:43.542 --> 28:45.917
we are not going to establish any connection with him.

28:47.750 --> 28:51.917
There is a lot of peace and happiness in this.

28:53.792 --> 29:00.000
You know a liar will go to Hell

29:01.959 --> 29:05.792
and you too will follow him.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.709
God has given you realization,

29:08.792 --> 29:10.500
you have been enlightened within.

29:11.458 --> 29:15.208
See, in that light, if there are other people like you,

29:15.792 --> 29:18.917
you should take a resolution that you will never tell lies

29:19.500 --> 29:21.667
let our heads be cut off, whatever it may be.

29:24.667 --> 29:29.208
In this matter the Indians are very much better,

29:29.792 --> 29:32.291
I know, but when I hear about them outside

29:32.834 --> 29:35.000
then I feel very sad about it.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.625
Now, the way these roads are made,

29:39.333 --> 29:41.709
are they roads in any sense?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.750
I felt as if we were going through some forests.

29:46.417 --> 29:50.792
You have an organization so whenever you see such a thing,

29:51.250 --> 29:54.709
you can call for any enquiry who made such type of road?

29:55.333 --> 29:58.000
Why he made? Who ate up the money?

30:00.083 --> 30:03.417
All the Sahaja yogis should get united

30:04.542 --> 30:16.041
and try to drive this bhoot (possession) out of our country.

30:18.999 --> 30:23.792
Wherever we go people say, " Don't believe the Indians"

30:25.125 --> 30:26.750
How shameful this is!

30:29.959 --> 30:34.667
The people who should be trusted the most are – we Indians.

30:36.667 --> 30:39.542
We have had such great leaders,

30:39.750 --> 30:44.208
great saints and great souls over here

30:45.875 --> 30:49.709
but we don't think of the name and fame they had,

30:50.000 --> 30:54.125
how much people respected them and they respect you too,

30:54.583 --> 30:58.792
but don't support the thieves.

30:59.500 --> 31:01.542
If you know that a particular person is a thief

31:01.792 --> 31:05.166
then you don't go to his place to eat,

31:06.125 --> 31:10.500
this would become difficult for the thieves.

31:11.041 --> 31:13.125
I am telling you

31:13.583 --> 31:16.875
you are the police force of the Divine and

31:17.542 --> 31:21.417
you try to keep a note of all the thieves whom you come across.

31:23.291 --> 31:25.667
Try to instill this courage in your children too.

31:27.125 --> 31:31.667
Try to find out about the people who are wrong doers and liars.

31:32.792 --> 31:40.709
This country of ours has been awakened by a number of saints

31:42.166 --> 31:43.709
and you all are also saints.

31:44.917 --> 31:46.750
There is no need for you to tell lies,

31:47.291 --> 31:48.959
what will happen if you get food only once a day?

31:49.625 --> 31:51.709
No one dies if he doesn't eat.

31:52.458 --> 31:54.458
We people are getting to eat and drink

31:54.875 --> 31:56.750
but on the top of it, we want to drink liquor.

31:57.083 --> 32:01.583
Secondly on drinking liquor we can hardly walk even a step.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.375
On the contrary we get destroyed.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.083
We cannot live well upon the addiction of liquor.

32:11.999 --> 32:13.500
Now, for example in America,

32:15.583 --> 32:17.166
they have taken out a new issue, that

32:17.417 --> 32:20.709
when a child turns 16 years then he will earn for himself.

32:21.208 --> 32:23.458
This means that all are servants.

32:23.875 --> 32:28.041
They are given money for whatever work they do; washing vehicles.

32:28.792 --> 32:30.709
And at the age of 16 what they say,

32:31.959 --> 32:37.083
Sir you are 16 years of age and now you go out

32:38.291 --> 32:39.500
I have seen everywhere,

32:40.083 --> 32:43.375
these poor children who are 16 years of age,

32:43.875 --> 32:47.500
we think, that he is just now turning 16 where will he go?

32:47.999 --> 32:52.375
What about education? He is of 16 years now!

32:52.917 --> 32:54.583
He is thrown out of his house.

32:55.166 --> 32:58.500
He is driven out of the house, both by his father and mother.

32:58.583 --> 33:01.333
How long will this continue with the Americans, you just see.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.125
They are getting ruined.

33:05.041 --> 33:07.500
By buying one or two aeroplanes, nobody becomes great.

33:09.667 --> 33:15.709
Where are you? What is your capacity?

33:16.875 --> 33:20.792
India is such a country which can serve the whole world

33:28.166 --> 33:33.291
But for that, there should be truthfulness in it.

33:33.834 --> 33:39.500
Where is the need for falsehood, I can't understand!

33:39.999 --> 33:44.917
Most of the people who are rich should first of all know

33:45.792 --> 33:48.583
that you are rich, sit quietly now

33:49.792 --> 33:52.208
and don't think of earning more.

33:52.500 --> 33:58.125
I didn't see anyone who became happier through earning more.

34:00.333 --> 34:04.291
You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have the light in you.

34:04.999 --> 34:10.083
You can see your path in this light and the path is of truth.

34:11.792 --> 34:15.667
You may be a Muslim, may be a Hindu or may be a Christian

34:17.875 --> 34:20.333
it makes no difference. You are all human beings.

34:21.375 --> 34:23.875
And if human beings do not have honesty in them

34:25.208 --> 34:29.667
then they are dishonest. He won't be known to anyone.

34:30.458 --> 34:34.917
We have life beyond this too, how would that be?

34:36.834 --> 34:39.500
There are many benefits of being honest.

34:40.458 --> 34:41.750
The greatest of all is that

34:42.500 --> 34:45.041
you have the blessing of God with you.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.291
You have the kind of blessings

34:48.750 --> 34:52.083
that you will be surprised to know.

34:52.417 --> 34:55.250
Without any efforts all your things are set in order.

34:55.999 --> 35:00.500
But now in India, whatever the condition of the people –

35:00.999 --> 35:03.834
they may have, they may not have, all run after money.

35:04.208 --> 35:06.458
There are still many more poor people

35:08.834 --> 35:13.041
and so it should be Diwali celebrations for them also today.

35:13.583 --> 35:15.166
They too should be happy.

35:15.542 --> 35:17.417
We live in the same country.

35:18.083 --> 35:22.458
But we deceive ourselves. We are very clever.

35:25.375 --> 35:28.417
By this we become egoistic inside.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.166
And by becoming egoistic nobody can save you in any way.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.500
Under the influence of your ego you can get cancer.

35:39.709 --> 35:41.792
Then you can't save yourself.

35:42.250 --> 35:45.333
If you have cancer within you then you cannot save yourself.

35:45.625 --> 35:48.625
I too cannot save you. I am telling you the fact.

35:49.208 --> 35:54.041
Firstly burn your ego in the fire.

35:56.375 --> 35:59.000
If you have an ego then you should be ashamed of it.

36:00.125 --> 36:02.333
For what are you having ego?

36:03.792 --> 36:05.834
In our country it is for everything.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.834
If some one has done a BA he gets egoistic

36:10.999 --> 36:13.875
and if he does something more than that, he gets a double ego.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.875
If someone has achieved something,

36:18.208 --> 36:20.125
if he becomes an engineer or a doctor

36:20.792 --> 36:23.166
then he becomes egoistic.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.792
When his Agnya chakra gets caught up

36:26.375 --> 36:31.166
where will it take you straight to? To Hell

36:33.000 --> 36:37.333
and hell is a very horrible place.

36:37.917 --> 36:40.834
God has given you intelligence and

36:41.625 --> 36:43.291
now you have got your realization.

36:44.417 --> 36:48.583
And even after that if you want to go to hell you can go.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.875
Till today nobody has spoken of this.

36:53.792 --> 36:59.125
Today is an auspicious day,

36:59.542 --> 37:01.750
because many things took place on this day.

37:02.125 --> 37:06.250
Sitaji returned during the period of “Ramchandraji”,

37:07.999 --> 37:14.083
whatever great deeds were done during the period of “Krishnaji”

37:14.750 --> 37:18.917
were done by people who were realized souls.

37:19.917 --> 37:22.458
So the first thing that you decide for sure is

37:22.959 --> 37:25.500
that we won't do any dishonest deed at the same time

37:26.166 --> 37:29.291
if any one else does then we will get him exposed.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.625
But I am seeing in this country that

37:34.959 --> 37:36.500
the whites are fighting the blacks,

37:37.333 --> 37:38.667
someone is fighting with someone else.

37:39.999 --> 37:42.583
They want the country of India to be separated

37:42.834 --> 37:45.000
which is not going to be beneficial at all.

37:45.375 --> 37:50.166
How can it be beneficial when you are honest

37:51.959 --> 37:54.041
and when you have a good character!

37:55.333 --> 37:57.792
Whatever we have learnt from the English people,

37:58.291 --> 37:59.667
there is nothing worth learning from them.

38:01.583 --> 38:05.041
They are all in a very bad state now.

38:06.959 --> 38:10.750
But we have to save our own country and save the whole world.

38:11.667 --> 38:13.208
It is a great responsibility;

38:13.959 --> 38:17.500
you have been given realization, you have been enlightened,

38:18.083 --> 38:23.333
still if you want to fall in the ditch then what can anyone do?

38:27.208 --> 38:29.750
Everyone should come together and try.

38:30.250 --> 38:33.458
I want the Sahaja Yogis to form a committee

38:35.500 --> 38:37.375
and if you come across any theft

38:37.792 --> 38:40.417
then it should be brought to the notice of the committee

38:40.917 --> 38:42.999
and then see, what the committee does.

38:43.917 --> 38:46.500
In this way you will get fame and

38:47.250 --> 38:49.125
you will reach to a very high position.

38:50.875 --> 38:52.417
So the first thing would be that

38:52.917 --> 38:55.834
neither should you be dishonest nor let others to be dishonest.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.166
This is very important.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.792
Your country has been blemished.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.583
In the oil there is adulteration

39:06.792 --> 39:08.166
then in the Ghee there is adulteration.

39:09.458 --> 39:12.750
Where ever we see, people are laughing at us.

39:13.667 --> 39:14.834
No one believes

39:15.542 --> 39:17.999
but actually the best of people are in India.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.917
The number of people who have got their realization

39:24.875 --> 39:26.999
is more than anywhere else in the world.

39:27.417 --> 39:29.750
They have not earned any virtue.

39:31.709 --> 39:34.041
So it is better to earn virtue than to earn money.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.667
See the people who are very poor.

39:44.166 --> 39:47.625
So this day is a very auspicious day and also a very joyful day.

39:48.792 --> 39:54.208
Why joyful? Because today we have got heaven

39:55.834 --> 39:57.667
and we want to stay in heaven alone.

39:58.999 --> 40:02.583
But cowardly people cannot enter the Heaven.

40:04.375 --> 40:05.999
There is no need to be afraid.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.709
If you get a couple of rupees more or less

40:11.834 --> 40:13.792
which disaster is going to befall upon you?

40:16.083 --> 40:18.333
All have become rich. I have been seeing.

40:18.792 --> 40:22.000
I have been coming here for the past 17-18 years now.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.834
You have become richer than before.

40:25.667 --> 40:27.750
The situation is better than before.

40:28.542 --> 40:29.999
But from morning to evening

40:30.500 --> 40:33.375
there is dishonesty, dishonesty and dishonesty.

40:34.709 --> 40:36.667
So the path has been made.

40:39.083 --> 40:43.125
So, today just promise that, we are not going to be dishonest

40:43.792 --> 40:47.959
and if anybody is, then we all will unitedly oppose.

40:48.709 --> 40:50.709
Why have you been given Sahaja Yoga?

40:51.208 --> 40:52.999
Why have you been given realization?

40:53.375 --> 40:57.083
So that you can spread light, if you have no light internally

40:57.417 --> 40:59.959
then how can you spread light outside?

41:00.333 --> 41:05.583
And with that light you see, you are helping the dishonest?

41:07.250 --> 41:11.458
Nothing will happen if you earn a little less or more.

41:12.333 --> 41:16.208
If you are honest then God will help you!

41:17.750 --> 41:20.125
Why are so many people dying in our country?

41:20.542 --> 41:23.834
Nowhere else they die, so many of them.

41:23.917 --> 41:26.041
The reason is that they have to go to Hell.

41:29.291 --> 41:32.250
So, you have to know this that if you are dishonest

41:33.417 --> 41:36.583
then your first step to Hell is already over and

41:39.375 --> 41:42.333
then the second step of telling lies will not be necessary.

41:43.291 --> 41:44.750
You tell the truth.

41:46.166 --> 41:53.792
The person who will tell the truth would be a unique person.

41:54.166 --> 41:59.917
If he is a Sahaja Yogi then it would be the best.

42:00.417 --> 42:02.542
The way people are remembering the sufis,

42:03.041 --> 42:05.667
the same way people are going to remember you.

42:06.417 --> 42:08.083
You don't have to do anything.

42:08.834 --> 42:11.834
Just catch hold of those who are dishonest

42:14.959 --> 42:17.166
it is very much necessary.

42:17.583 --> 42:19.125
Here people are fighting

42:19.375 --> 42:21.750
to stop the rubbish from being thrown into Jamunaji

42:22.583 --> 42:24.709
this too needs to be told!

42:25.041 --> 42:26.458
I have been to so many countries!

42:27.000 --> 42:29.750
nobody throws waste into the river.

42:31.041 --> 42:35.625
Why are you so lazy? There are so many facilities over here.

42:36.458 --> 42:41.750
You can give the waste to the Municipality.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.375
Dispose somewhere, but if you yourself throw waste

42:47.166 --> 42:49.375
then what can one do?

42:50.250 --> 42:53.750
Today all of you decide in your mind and take a resolution

42:53.750 --> 42:56.208
it is a very auspicious day today, very auspicious day, that

42:57.166 --> 43:01.625
“We won't do any dishonest deed nor will we believe in dishonesty”

43:04.625 --> 43:06.375
I have seen people who were neither dishonest

43:07.875 --> 43:10.625
nor did they go to the house of people who were dishonest.

43:11.792 --> 43:13.500
They had nothing to do with them

43:14.959 --> 43:18.333
because they were concerned not only about their own welfare

43:18.625 --> 43:20.291
but also the welfare of the whole country.

43:22.458 --> 43:24.166
So you are a Sahaja Yogi,

43:24.500 --> 43:26.166
so you need to make a promise

43:26.999 --> 43:29.500
that we are not going to do any thing dishonest.

43:32.375 --> 43:35.458
You just recognise a person who is dishonest

43:37.000 --> 43:43.834
and then tell your inner soul that he is dishonest.

43:44.458 --> 43:48.333
And, Sahaja Yogis, even if twelve Sahaja Yogis come together

43:49.542 --> 43:52.125
and if they come to know that he is dishonest

43:54.250 --> 43:57.709
then the Divine will be there to support.

44:03.250 --> 44:05.750
This country won't benefit by a few rich people,

44:06.166 --> 44:09.583
but it will definitely benefit by honest people.

44:10.709 --> 44:13.125
The greatest stigma that has been put on us

44:13.500 --> 44:15.000
is that we are dishonest.

44:15.333 --> 44:18.083
Those who are Sahaja Yogis can never be dishonest.

44:25.625 --> 44:30.125
We all have to be united, leaving aside all quarrels

44:30.875 --> 44:33.250
and assumptions that we are honest people.

44:33.667 --> 44:35.999
India's image is very much tarnished,

44:43.250 --> 44:45.709
hence take a vow today that from now onwards

44:46.000 --> 44:48.500
we shall not be dishonest and

44:48.917 --> 44:52.999
if there are any dishonest people we shall all get after him

44:54.875 --> 44:57.458
Next day he will be unable to sleep in peace

45:01.834 --> 45:03.875
But this has increased too much.

45:04.792 --> 45:07.166
I am astonished at the level of dishonesty,

45:08.166 --> 45:11.542
dishonesty in everything, dishonesty in everything.

45:12.208 --> 45:17.291
Earlier they used to outcast on every minor issue and

45:18.917 --> 45:23.000
they used to separate themselves for even very minor things.

45:24.875 --> 45:30.875
But our country was so honest, it had such nice qualities.

45:32.041 --> 45:37.250
Have we forgotten them? Where have they gone?

45:38.792 --> 45:45.333
I can see dishonesty everywhere, dishonesty at every step.

45:46.291 --> 45:51.959
We have to teach the children that they should not be dishonest.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.667
Yes, if they are dying with hunger,

45:57.750 --> 45:59.999
then arrangements can be made for that too,

46:00.333 --> 46:02.750
but only if he is honest.

46:03.083 --> 46:09.458
If you are not honest then nobody can help you, not even God.

46:10.125 --> 46:12.333
He will get all kinds of diseases of the world.

46:13.250 --> 46:17.792
There are many such traditions in our country

46:19.625 --> 46:22.999
they will drink liquor, drink wine.

46:24.041 --> 46:29.917
Tell me, have you come here to become a fool?

46:31.583 --> 46:36.041
And don't be a friend of one who does it. Don't help them.

46:37.917 --> 46:40.417
I have seen people who go to the houses of people

46:40.750 --> 46:46.250
who drink liquor, then they too start taking liquor.

46:47.750 --> 46:48.834
But when you know

46:49.041 --> 46:50.667
that a person is of such a character,

46:52.041 --> 46:55.250
when you know that he is dishonest, then,

46:55.709 --> 47:00.625
stop eating at his place. You have nothing to do with him.

47:01.917 --> 47:04.375
We have to work for the well being of our country

47:04.709 --> 47:06.709
because God has given us light. See in that light.

47:07.792 --> 47:11.709
His power is tremendous.

47:12.417 --> 47:18.875
If you decide that, those who are dishonest to the nation

47:20.875 --> 47:24.333
will be taken care by God, then that alone is enough.

47:25.208 --> 47:28.083
But you are turning deaf. You are not able to understand.

47:30.458 --> 47:32.667
Such a person can never do any good deed;

47:33.709 --> 47:35.417
nor can he ever give.

47:36.709 --> 47:41.500
I cannot understand how they live so shamelessly.

47:42.417 --> 47:50.000
So, that is why today's message is that

47:51.000 --> 47:53.959
you have to take a vow that

47:54.458 --> 47:57.417
we are not going to be dishonest in any way and

47:57.792 --> 48:00.500
if any one is dishonest then we are not going to support him.

48:01.166 --> 48:03.625
That is enough.

48:04.083 --> 48:08.250
Many more realized souls will come to our country.

48:09.792 --> 48:12.542
But who would like to come to such a dishonest country?

48:14.166 --> 48:16.250
So today the only message is that

48:16.834 --> 48:21.375
you have light and if you walk in that light,

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
it will give you strength.

48:24.417 --> 48:27.750
You can do whatever you want to do.

48:29.125 --> 48:33.000
Look, we have achieved our “Swatantra”.

48:34.667 --> 48:37.750
“Swatantra” is the mechanism of understanding oneself.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.792
Now I want a lot of realized children to be born ,

48:41.375 --> 48:51.792
so learn that it is a very great day today,

48:53.166 --> 48:54.458
take a vow today

48:55.417 --> 49:01.208
that neither will we be dishonest nor support the dishonest.

49:02.375 --> 49:04.333
Not even be scared of them;

49:05.083 --> 49:07.583
God is not with them at all. God is with you.

49:10.834 --> 49:15.000
If you are good then God is with you.

49:15.667 --> 49:19.583
All the people had taken birth on this very land of India

49:21.291 --> 49:23.250
not for the sake of fighting,

49:24.583 --> 49:26.917
dying amongst yourselves, great fools!

49:27.250 --> 49:28.750
We are fighting, dying,

49:30.417 --> 49:32.917
there is no benefit in fighting, tell the people.

49:33.875 --> 49:36.875
“Oh! why are you fighting? What do you want?

49:37.625 --> 49:43.750
After all you have nice things to eat and drink,

49:44.041 --> 49:46.125
what more do you want?”

49:47.458 --> 49:49.291
But nowadays what is most prevalent is that ,

49:49.667 --> 49:50.959
we want such and such clothes,

49:51.625 --> 49:56.375
we want such type of a house and we don't have that,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.959
with all that we will only go to hell.

50:03.542 --> 50:07.709
In those times there were many who were sufis,

50:08.458 --> 50:12.625
like them you are all sufis, because you are all cleansed.

50:14.542 --> 50:18.999
Now all of you write the poem of honesty.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.458
This dishonesty has got to go, that is the first thing

50:26.083 --> 50:31.709
and secondly there are many issues which need to be corrected.

50:32.375 --> 50:35.500
But see, first of all don't be dishonest

50:38.500 --> 50:42.959
No one is so poor in India that we have to resort to dishonesty.

50:44.250 --> 50:47.625
I am saying that our country is tarnished.

50:48.125 --> 50:50.250
This needs to be wiped off.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.625
You are Sahaja Yogis and you can do it.

50:55.250 --> 50:58.542
You have light, with this light

50:58.999 --> 51:03.625
you can spread the light everywhere

51:04.750 --> 51:08.375
and give courage to all, that its alright.

51:09.041 --> 51:11.959
Particularly those of you who are young, who are friends

51:12.583 --> 51:16.417
have to think what all honest deeds you can do.

51:18.583 --> 51:21.375
Now they have started – don't throw rubbish into “Jamunaji”.

51:22.250 --> 51:24.375
That is alright but it is not so important.

51:25.000 --> 51:29.917
What is important is to get rid of dishonesty.

51:32.750 --> 51:36.750
That is why this day is considered auspicious everywhere.

51:37.041 --> 51:39.542
Lamps are lit all around.

51:40.166 --> 51:44.583
In spite of everything if we can't do this

51:45.792 --> 51:48.417
then what is the benefit of Sahaja Yoga?

51:49.166 --> 51:56.417
The largest number of Sahaja yogis are in India.

52:00.917 --> 52:07.500
Then comes Russia. Now, the Russian people are very polite.

52:08.709 --> 52:12.750
They do no commit any robberies. I don't know why?

52:14.792 --> 52:17.208
May be if communism comes to India

52:17.625 --> 52:20.125
then we too might become like them;

52:20.542 --> 52:22.875
but that is not a very great thing.

52:25.417 --> 52:27.000
If somebody does something out of compulsion

52:27.542 --> 52:29.166
then it is not good.

52:29.625 --> 52:31.834
Decide that we should be powerful ourselves.

52:32.375 --> 52:38.000
Today you decide, today is a very auspicious day that

52:38.542 --> 52:43.250
neither will you be dishonest nor let others be dishonest.

52:49.458 --> 52:52.458
Your country will then prosper a lot.

52:55.250 --> 52:58.667
I have seen what other countries are and how its people are

52:59.333 --> 53:00.834
all are useless people.

53:01.542 --> 53:07.667
But the people of our country are still religious

53:11.041 --> 53:14.542
Religiousness will perish in our country

53:15.166 --> 53:17.458
if these dishonest people become so powerful.

53:18.917 --> 53:20.542
So the only message is that

53:21.792 --> 53:25.959
neither will we be dishonest nor will we allow others to do so.

53:28.750 --> 53:33.458
But the people here are very tolerant in this matter.

53:35.750 --> 53:37.999
They tolerate, this is their greatest mistake.

53:38.667 --> 53:41.417
When you have got the light, why are you scared?

53:43.125 --> 53:45.083
What is the need for you to be afraid?

53:49.999 --> 53:55.000
That is why I am requesting you today, be courageous

53:55.959 --> 53:58.166
and now one kind of liberation has been achieved.

53:58.667 --> 53:59.999
You will achieve “swatantra”,

54:00.667 --> 54:02.041
the “tantra” (Mechanism) of “swa”(Oneself),

54:02.458 --> 54:08.667
you have achieved it. But make use of it.

54:13.166 --> 54:15.875
Today, you are so many people gathered here.

54:16.291 --> 54:18.375
I have never seen so many in Delhi.

54:27.959 --> 54:30.500
So, today you all decide within yourself

54:31.542 --> 54:35.834
that you are not going to believe any dishonest people

54:37.709 --> 54:40.208
and all the devils take birth

54:41.667 --> 54:44.166
for this very reason that we have something in us

54:44.709 --> 54:47.625
which makes them think that we will believe them.

54:48.709 --> 54:51.375
Indians should never believe

54:52.125 --> 54:57.291
and the ones who are realized should never at all.

54:59.834 --> 55:02.667
There is one great aspersion on our country everywhere

55:04.000 --> 55:07.834
which is not true. India has many people who are honest

55:08.083 --> 55:11.709
many and this aspersion is not true.

55:12.208 --> 55:16.166
I have also seen this,

55:20.583 --> 55:23.834
They will fight this land is ours and that land is yours.

55:24.959 --> 55:28.333
Whatever you have is swaraja, kingdom of oneself

55:29.583 --> 55:31.125
one's own kingdom.

55:32.625 --> 55:33.959
You will have kingdom of your own

55:34.667 --> 55:38.041
when you would become swatantra in the true sense.

55:38.792 --> 55:44.458
There is no need to fear anyone no need to tell anyone.

55:50.542 --> 55:53.583
I am surprised to see so many people.

55:53.875 --> 55:55.834
I had never seen so many people in Delhi.

56:07.625 --> 56:12.542
So, my only request to you on this auspicious day is that

56:13.125 --> 56:15.667
we should decide, we should never be dishonest,

56:16.000 --> 56:17.750
even if we have to die.

56:19.583 --> 56:21.875
Our country has deteriorated in the last ten years.

56:25.125 --> 56:28.709
You are so many Sahaja yogis. What are you afraid of?

56:32.959 --> 56:34.625
What is the issue to be scared of?

56:38.709 --> 56:41.417
The Divine is there behind everyone.

56:48.999 --> 56:51.208
When the Sufis came to know

56:52.959 --> 56:55.250
that the divine was there with them

56:56.041 --> 57:00.834
they got rid of all unwanted things from this world.

57:01.291 --> 57:08.000
Not all sufis but a few did. So you all have to do it.

57:10.250 --> 57:14.041
So the message for today is that

57:14.458 --> 57:19.583
you yourself should never be a thief nor support any thief.

57:20.709 --> 57:26.208
But I am seeing people fighting on more and more issues,

57:28.917 --> 57:32.458
fighting on issues of caste and religion.

57:32.917 --> 57:36.999
Are you here to save the country or to get drowned?

57:39.917 --> 57:41.750
You have a great responsibility.

57:42.583 --> 57:44.458
You have been born in Kaliyuga.

57:45.792 --> 57:48.208
This kaliyuga has to be changed

57:49.917 --> 57:53.333
and that is why so many thousands of you are realized.

57:53.792 --> 57:58.417
So many people were never realized anywhere else in the world.

57:59.250 --> 58:01.999
That is why I am requesting you again and again

58:02.750 --> 58:08.458
that always stand on Truth and I will be there with you.

58:13.083 --> 58:21.667
God is also with you.

58:24.375 --> 58:29.000
So the request to you all is to firmly decide within yourself

58:29.834 --> 58:33.375
that we are not going to allow any theft, robberies

58:36.417 --> 58:40.083
and wherever we find them we will fight it.

58:41.667 --> 58:45.000
But the people seem to be drunk or what?

58:48.875 --> 58:55.333
What did they achieve from this light? Courage.

58:57.250 --> 58:59.083
Fight with courage.

58:59.625 --> 59:02.083
Whatever is wrong should be removed from this country.

59:02.875 --> 59:10.208
It is very tarnished, still there are many more issues

59:10.667 --> 59:12.625
but the most important one is that

59:13.041 --> 59:17.834
if there is no honesty then how can God help you?

59:19.667 --> 59:21.875
Earning money is of no use to God.

59:22.417 --> 59:26.375
But getting your religion is and that you have achieved.

59:27.834 --> 59:30.375
There are not so many Sahaja yogis in this world

59:32.959 --> 59:35.458
and then Sahaja yogis don't do such deeds.

59:36.291 --> 59:37.834
But I am telling you all this because

59:38.500 --> 59:40.959
the atmosphere here is very bad

59:45.250 --> 59:47.625
and we people have such a bad name everywhere.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.083
You have everything to eat and drink, clothes to dress,

59:54.667 --> 59:56.792
what else do you want?

01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:05.709
You watch movies, you do have that much money.

01:00:07.999 --> 01:00:13.000
But the addiction for money which is there should be got rid off.

01:00:16.792 --> 01:00:20.875
I have full hope that you will heed my words.

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:29.542
So we should take a vow that we will not be dishonest

01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:34.375
and we would oppose the people who are dishonest.

01:00:49.709 --> 01:00:52.291
Understand that the greatest thing

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.709
that our country needs today is honesty.

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:03.667
There is nothing greater than that. Honesty is your mother.

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:08.375
So what if you have one shirt in the place of ten?

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.792
Tell the ladies also the same thing.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.417
It will happen. It will take place.

01:01:17.999 --> 01:01:22.417
Today's speech is a little different, it is unique

01:01:27.291 --> 01:01:33.417
and it is very gracious of you all to have liked it.

01:01:38.834 --> 01:01:41.542
Thank you.
