00:00:02.583 --> 00:00:04.041
Happy Diwali!

00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:16.333
Wish you all a very happy Diwali!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.375
You have seen these different types of dances,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.999
understand one thing from them

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.792
that whoever has written it or said it,

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:43.166
they are all saying the same thing.

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.208
The greatest thing that they said was

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.291
that the Paramatma is One.

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:58.417
They had incarnated in different forms, avatars,

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:00.709
but the Paramatma is one.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.959
There were no disputes amongst them,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.750
they came in this world for the destruction of evil

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.999
and killing the wicked people;

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.333
and this is happening.

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:26.417
I am seeing everywhere

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.583
that these evil people are getting exposed

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.583
and now it is your duty too,

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:41.542
to see that all those who are evil,

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:46.709
those who are working against the Paramatma and

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.917
who are ready to do anything for the sake of earning money,

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:55.125
all of them go to hell.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:02.166
We do not know how many Hells there are!

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:08.750
The place where you are all sitting now

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:12.625
is very much away from hell.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.166
There is no relation with hell at all.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.208
But staying here,

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:27.667
if you perform unreligious deeds, do wrong things

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.000
then you too can go to hell.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.542
There are many types of hells and

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.959
the arrangements to go there are also very nicely done.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.417
Because those who are going there,

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.875
do not even know where they are going.

00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:54.875
Those who remain behind go to Heaven.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.667
Nobody on this earthly abode even knows

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:03.041
that they may even go to Hell.

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:07.041
Doing wrong deeds would land us in Hell.

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:11.250
The meaning of Diwali itself is that

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.458
the way the lamps are lit outside,

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.250
you too should be enlightened within

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.125
In this dark world you see, you are the lights,

00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:37.208
you are the lamps and you have to give the light.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:41.333
But if you are not internally enlightened enough

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:45.333
then how can you give out light?

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.959
Realise this.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:50.709
So first of all, you Sahaja Yogis

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:56.166
should get properly enlightened internally

00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:00.709
and may be it is for this purpose alone

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.166
that we have come into this world.

00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:09.000
Until Jesus Christ, nobody even spoke about this.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.417
At Agnya chakra He came

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:23.667
and showed that he did not have any ego whatsoever.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.917
He was the son of the Almighty, still he had no ego.

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:31.875
The people who had come before him

00:04:32.458 --> 00:04:36.083
revealed a little but Christ

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:43.625
only wanted that our Agnya chakra should be cleared and

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:49.500
that Agnya chakra seems to be very much caught up in Delhi.

00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:55.458
What is the reason for this?

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:58.625
The English people lived here before

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.917
and they taught us to be egoistic.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:10.333
This is quite evident in your talk and behaviour.

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:13.291
We have seen those days too

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.333
when our country was not independent

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:22.333
but you people are liberated now.

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:24.959
Now we are independent.

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:29.875
And what is Swatantra, Know the Swa – oneself

00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:34.166
and the one who has the “Swa” Self knowledge,

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.125
then he also has the knowledge of the “tantra”

00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:38.542
instrument of “Swa” oneself.

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:40.750
Through Sahaja Yoga you have known yourself

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:45.917
and you know that you are the “tantra” instrument and

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.417
that you need to follow the path of Self Knowledge.

00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:57.291
It can be seen that there has been a lot of development in Delhi.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.959
Outside Delhi too there has been a lot of development.

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:10.750
You all know what the problem is with the people over here,

00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:11.917
I need not tell you.

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:14.875
But now you have become independent,

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.417
so you have to see that you don't have these problems.

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:26.500
The first problem is that your Agnya chakra is catching.

00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:34.999
Christ was crucified and killed,

00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:40.625
but still we have not yet learnt from it.

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.166
On the contrary, people from the Christian countries

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.250
are highly egoistic

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:50.834
and they have influenced us also.

00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:57.917
But the worst thing here is that

00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:05.959
we have not yet recognized each other.

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:09.333
There are fights and disputes everywhere.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.166
There are quarrels going on,

00:07:12.834 --> 00:07:15.333
there is no purity of mind.

00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:21.583
First of all we should purify our minds.

00:07:22.834 --> 00:07:24.625
With Sahaja Yoga everything is possible

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.583
and can take people to such great heights.

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:32.709
It is not necessary for anyone to go and sit in the Himalayas.

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:36.999
You can do this in the city of Delhi itself.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.417
But if you look around

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.208
you will see egoistic people everywhere

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:45.291
and their Agnya chakra is caught up very severely.

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:47.667
So it is very difficult.

00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:51.999
Now God has sent one new thing and that is “CANCER”.

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:59.500
If you get cancer and your Agnya chakra is not clear,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.875
then it cannot be cured

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.166
and then a big tragedy will take place.

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:10.375
So, one who has cancer

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:13.875
should take to Sahaja Yoga

00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:20.333
and clear out the ego within himself.

00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:22.999
Wherever there is a Government,

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:26.333
there the people are very egoistic.

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:29.458
We have got so many government servants here

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.208
and all of them have enough ego in them.

00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.500
The people who come from outside

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:42.000
have much more than them

00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:45.041
and on top of it they all drink liquor.

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:46.583
You just analyse,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.834
they call themselves Christians and they all drink.

00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:54.792
By drinking liquor you are going against yourself.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:04.417
You are disobeying your Agnya chakra.

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:07.291
You are not obeying it.

00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:09.458
The person whose Agnya chakra is clear

00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:12.542
cannot drink, he can never drink.

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.542
Wherever you look, the people are drinking liquor,

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:22.625
and they have no ways of getting rid of it.

00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:25.375
Because when they find they are unable to get rid of it,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.500
again they drink over it.

00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:32.709
So addictions of any sort puts us into slavery,

00:09:32.792 --> 00:09:34.291
let it be of any kind.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.291
Here, there is addiction to paan

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.375
and they will add tobacco also to it.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.834
God has created you with so much of affection

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:51.542
and given you birth in this country

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.041
so that you can become unique from rest of the world.

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:58.333
They can be so. Indians are so.

00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:04.542
But of late, I find there are a couple of serious ailments.

00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:10.834
They are eating money in the place of food.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.333
The roads by which we came now

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.625
were not there earlier but it was a pain for me

00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:23.250
to see that the roads are in such bad shape

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.250
that no one can say that they are new.

00:10:28.583 --> 00:10:31.458
Only Indians can do such things.

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:35.667
I have not seen such shameless people in the whole world,

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:41.792
who do such things. And it is not necessary to be so.

00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:48.250
Here any time, any person who has the power can do this thing.

00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:52.709
First of all, we have to take a resolution today

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:55.083
that we have to clear our Agnya.

00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:58.250
The greatest issue at the Agnya is that

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:01.500
we think that we are very superior.

00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:08.750
And we start thinking that we can rule the whole world,

00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:11.041
and that we can correct the world.

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:12.583
When you yourselves are not correct

00:11:12.792 --> 00:11:15.166
then how can you correct this world?

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.667
Now, you must have seen many people

00:11:18.709 --> 00:11:21.792
who think that they are very great,

00:11:22.792 --> 00:11:25.250
but do a lot of wrong things.

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:29.000
In this country people take a lot of money.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.542
Tell me how will God forgive us for this?

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:41.542
The greatest of all sins are stealing and corruption.

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:45.125
The person who commits these types of sins,

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:50.125
whatever he may try, he may do poojas

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.542
chant mantras, read Namaz, call out to Allah,

00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:59.375
anything, he won't be benefited in any way.

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:02.875
So, today, is a New year for you,

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:04.999
I wish you all

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:08.583
and I want you all to make a resolution

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:16.917
From today onwards, I will not tell lies, never ever lie".

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:22.959
Indians are very famous world wide as liars.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.291
I do not know how but our country carries the stamp

00:12:28.458 --> 00:12:29.834
of being dishonest.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.000
Great saints, prophets have taken their birth here.

00:12:33.959 --> 00:12:35.625
where so many Sufis were born,

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:40.999
How can people lie in a place like this?

00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:44.041
So today, you have to promise

00:12:44.417 --> 00:12:45.792
that you will never tell lies,

00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:47.417
whatever may be the consequences.

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:51.333
For that you need to have courage.

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:55.125
Now that you are realized what more courage is needed?

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:57.959
As it is you can't lie at all.

00:12:59.625 --> 00:13:01.959
It’s only when you become like this,

00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:04.667
the people will be able to have faith

00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:07.625
that you are really truthful people.

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.333
So, the Sahaja Yogis have to be truthful.

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:17.375
Whatever may be one's occupation,

00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:23.458
whatever he may do he may be an Engineer laying roads,

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.875
he may be a Doctor treating everyone.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.208
If inspite of all this,

00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:35.583
if you lie then it would be Hell for you.

00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:45.041
That is because you are now transformed.

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.750
You are now realized.

00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:51.959
So when realized people lie

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:58.333
they cannot benefit from it at all.

00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:03.999
When I go abroad, and often hear people say,

00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:06.000
that the people of our country are cheaters,

00:14:06.834 --> 00:14:11.166
liars and corrupt, I feel very sad.

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:13.792
Today it is very auspicious day for you.

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:15.500
Today let us all make a resolution that

00:14:15.875 --> 00:14:18.834
we will never lie, whatever it may be.

00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:27.709
I myself am a woman, that too an Indian.

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:30.542
I have never said a lie.

00:14:31.999 --> 00:14:36.834
By telling lies it would be a loss for you,

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:43.083
you will be put to loss by doing wrong deeds.

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:49.291
By doing so, you may be earning more

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:51.667
or cheat more

00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:58.500
but you cannot go to Heaven, you will go to Hell.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.917
One thing it is very important to know that

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:06.750
we have a very bad reputation in the rest of the world.

00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:09.208
Why the bad reputation?

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.291
Because, we are such type of people!

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:15.250
When you come to know that someone is a liar,

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:24.083
form an organization and make an enquiry into it.

00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:26.709
For example, if a road has been laid

00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:29.417
which is not good enough,

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:34.250
then enquire about the amount spent in its laying

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.458
and what is being done?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.333
The money that is made out of the road

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:44.999
will only be used for drinking and liquor, which is our enemy!

00:15:47.792 --> 00:15:49.750
Why do you want to do it?

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.583
You are all very well-to-do people.

00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:55.041
I have seen many countries where there are poor people

00:15:55.667 --> 00:15:58.291
but they are very honest.

00:15:59.417 --> 00:16:02.542
So honesty should be the foremost quality in you.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.125
Today, make a decision that

00:16:04.375 --> 00:16:06.417
we will never be dishonest hereafter.

00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:08.625
And we will not remain in the company of dishonest people

00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:12.333
and if any one is dishonest we will expose him.

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:14.834
Now it is like this, people will say,

00:16:15.083 --> 00:16:18.333
“Mother in the Police force too they are like this

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.750
and in other departments too they are like that,"

00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:22.583
but you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.458
Those who are Sahaja Yogis,

00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:29.083
are nothing less than any policeman or any person in power.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.333
They are all powerful. But all the powers are of Truth.

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:38.375
Truthfulness should be there

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:40.542
and I am very glad

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.709
that a lot of Sahaja Yogis are truthful

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.333
but we still need more Sahaja Yogis who are truthful.

00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:54.250
Truthfulness has to be there,

00:16:54.917 --> 00:16:56.999
otherwise your Agnya chakra will not be cleared.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Agnya, is where the ego resides.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.041
When a person becomes egoistic,

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.041
then he commits any kind of mistakes,

00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:13.500
he criticizes, harms, gets corrupt

00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:17.917
all such people will go to hell.

00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.375
I want to tell you very clearly,

00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:22.792
that you should not take to corruption,

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:24.500
you are not dying.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.000
What have you done by earning more?

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:28.417
What are you doing?

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.291
You must have put up a few more lights,

00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:36.083
kept a couple of more women, what more than that?

00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:41.583
Now, what will be your condition when you go to Hell?

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.417
I am discussing all this, on this day of Diwali

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.375
because Diwali was celebrated

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.834
on the occasion of Sitaji's re-union with Rama.

00:17:56.166 --> 00:18:02.542
We can no more be slaves once we embrace chastity.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.999
We are our own slaves and not the slaves of others.

00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:09.583
We shall not lie for any reason whatsoever.

00:18:10.834 --> 00:18:12.333
I have lived in Delhi for a long time

00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:17.709
and am quite surprised at how much they lie.

00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:22.625
They are not afraid of lying at all.

00:18:23.417 --> 00:18:26.500
By telling lies openly

00:18:26.917 --> 00:18:33.000
they might benefit here, they might earn more money,

00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:38.041
but it is not known that they will not go to Heaven.

00:18:38.375 --> 00:18:41.333
I want the Sahaja Yogis to promise that

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:45.458
neither will they lie nor will they support the people who lie.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:53.875
People say that our country is very corrupt.

00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:58.917
Yes, I have been to far off places and

00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:05.000
I have seen that the Russians are the best amongst them.

00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:07.917
They are as it is, half like Sahaja Yogis

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:10.542
and a lot of Sahaja Yogis are there.

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:13.792
This year I was not able to go to Russia,

00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:16.625
next year I will definitely go.

00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:19.750
This means that

00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:23.875
we were not able to implement democracy well,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.000
we too should have been communist.

00:19:29.917 --> 00:19:32.083
There are no cases of robbery there, no lies

00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:35.458
and everyone loves each other.

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:38.083
They respect me a lot.

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:44.125
We have to understand where we are going.

00:19:44.834 --> 00:19:48.125
For the sake of earning more money, to what extent will we go?

00:19:48.917 --> 00:19:50.709
What are we going to get?

00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:55.041
So, honesty should be the foremost quality within you.

00:19:56.667 --> 00:20:02.166
Your dishonesty is going to create problems for your own people.

00:20:02.709 --> 00:20:05.959
People say that the Indians are dishonest.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:10.000
I feel ashamed to hear this.

00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:14.500
So many great saints have taken birth over here,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.542
how many great prophets have been over here,

00:20:20.417 --> 00:20:26.083
and people of this place are great thieves

00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:32.542
and they steal and criticize

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:37.750
your Agnya has been scared of all this from beginning itself.

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:39.875
They want to make huge money;

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.917
in the end all these rich people will go to Hell.

00:20:44.792 --> 00:20:47.375
On this day of Diwali,

00:20:47.834 --> 00:20:50.458
I want to tell you all that the meaning of Diwali is that

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.542
the Hell is full of darkness and you all are enlightened.

00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:59.333
You are expected to fight wherever there is darkness

00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:03.375
and let them know that they are wrong deeds.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.291
By doing this our country will improve

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.291
and you have to do this.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.333
We have been performing poojas and rituals

00:21:12.667 --> 00:21:16.125
but the Shakti (Divine power) which is there within us,

00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:21.542
is there to oppose all that is not truthful.

00:21:23.208 --> 00:21:26.625
Many people do not know that making money is a sickness.

00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:31.375
They will go straight to Hell.

00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:33.792
I am telling you all this

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.792
because no one has said it like this before.

00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:41.083
On the day of Diwali, I am telling you

00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:44.125
that we are going to light lamps and

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.959
celebrate happiness in our hearts.

00:21:47.417 --> 00:21:51.417
By this we can see what kind of a person one is

00:21:51.959 --> 00:21:54.709
is he a person who steals?

00:21:55.208 --> 00:21:58.542
As of now too, I can see people fighting with each other.

00:21:59.041 --> 00:22:01.458
Quarrels amongst Hindus and Muslims are over now

00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:04.667
but fighting with others has started.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.917
That is the second thing- we are quarrelsome too.

00:22:11.542 --> 00:22:15.542
At least in the other countries

00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:17.542
there are not as many religions as we have.

00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:19.875
So whenever we get a chance, we start fighting,

00:22:22.875 --> 00:22:24.291
fighting is the priority.

00:22:25.917 --> 00:22:29.667
Fighting between husband and wife and then their children and

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:33.125
then if they have someone else with them

00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:36.750
they will fight with them too. What is Sahaja Yoga?

00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:39.375
Sahaja Yoga is love and only love.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.166
Awaken the power of love which is within us.

00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:53.875
Today is a very auspicious day

00:22:54.792 --> 00:22:57.583
and we have to light the lamps in our heart

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.999
and take up the resolution that we may die but we won't lie.

00:23:03.583 --> 00:23:05.125
We had great people over here

00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:12.709
but still Indians are very ill-famed the world over

00:23:13.417 --> 00:23:16.041
as being very dishonest.

00:23:16.458 --> 00:23:18.917
Though I have never seen one of this kind

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.583
but whenever I hear of it, I feel very sad.

00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:24.667
India is such a holy place

00:23:25.291 --> 00:23:28.333
where such great saints have taken their birth,

00:23:29.458 --> 00:23:30.792
that didn't happen anywhere, also the sufis

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.999
were also born here

00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:39.208
So many great saints were born here in India

00:23:40.583 --> 00:23:42.875
No other country had so many saints as in India

00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:45.834
there could have been a few

00:23:46.375 --> 00:23:48.458
but in India we had great saints

00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:53.333
that whatever they had taught, leave that.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.458
We have become notorious thieves.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.542
Whoever commits theft, can never go to Heaven.

00:24:04.834 --> 00:24:06.834
As compared to the life span spent here,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.458
you will have to spend a thousand times more in the Hell

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.083
Today I am talking about hell

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.625
because hell means darkness and

00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:23.709
we are seeing the spell of darkness everywhere, that of hell.

00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:29.417
Now, that your lights are lit, try to see who all are in hell.

00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:38.166
You support the Government by exposing the dishonest.

00:24:38.625 --> 00:24:41.125
You may be holding a junior or a senior position

00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:44.875
still you have to expose the one who is a thief

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.542
Catch the thieves, catch those who are dishonest

00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:53.917
Now you have got the powers what is it for?

00:24:55.542 --> 00:24:57.709
You have been awakened now what is it for?

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:02.750
You have got enlightenment.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.583
You see yourself in its light.

00:25:06.834 --> 00:25:08.667
You have seen nothing in the darkness

00:25:09.417 --> 00:25:13.417
but see in your light, what you are,

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:19.250
and what are you going to achieve by telling lies?

00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:23.500
We are family people,

00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:29.625
we never lie - never - and we can't even lie.

00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:33.625
Whenever the situation to lie arises

00:25:34.417 --> 00:25:36.875
don't forget that you have the powers, you are the lights,

00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:42.291
You see, you are the light in this darkness

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.834
and keep the lights burning.

00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:46.917
We have to end this darkness.

00:25:47.583 --> 00:25:49.709
We have a bad reputation for our dishonesty.

00:25:50.709 --> 00:25:53.750
There is no country as great as ours,

00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:56.750
yet it is very sad to know

00:25:57.792 --> 00:26:00.583
that the people outside have misunderstood us.

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:03.959
It is not known what these people achieve by their dishonesty.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.500
What they will get will be horrible!

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.291
No one will be spared!

00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:13.375
Whoever is dishonest will be caught

00:26:14.417 --> 00:26:15.959
and there are arrangements made for it.

00:26:17.417 --> 00:26:20.125
You have got realization because you are not dishonest,

00:26:20.959 --> 00:26:24.709
you love truthfulness and respect it.

00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.041
I want you all to stand for truth.

00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:36.875
The people who are throwing clutter in Jamunaji are fools.

00:26:38.959 --> 00:26:42.083
Jamunaji goes straight down to Hell.

00:26:43.458 --> 00:26:50.208
But you will be saved from that Hell.

00:26:50.583 --> 00:26:51.709
You are realized souls.

00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:54.291
The one who is enlightened never falls.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:06.417
But if you really want to establish Sahaja Yoga

00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:09.291
fully within yourself then you have to first of all decide

00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:11.375
never to be dishonest in any way.

00:27:14.458 --> 00:27:17.750
Earning money is the only business left in this world!

00:27:18.667 --> 00:27:20.417
What happens with that?

00:27:21.917 --> 00:27:23.709
Nobody will even remember them.

00:27:26.875 --> 00:27:31.875
You have to be truthful if at all you love your country.

00:27:32.166 --> 00:27:34.792
Otherwise who is going to believe in a liar's love!

00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:41.333
It is a very tough situation for you

00:27:42.417 --> 00:27:44.959
when you see that your neighbour is of such a type

00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:46.917
and you think that you too should become like that.

00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:49.000
On the contrary why don't you think that we are like this

00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:51.709
and why not that neighbour too be made like us.

00:27:53.542 --> 00:27:57.709
First of all you should promise that you will never be dishonest

00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:02.917
nor support any dishonest doers.

00:28:09.208 --> 00:28:15.125
It is not known - the thriving of liars is a curse of our country!

00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:19.750
There are many people who will tell at least ten lies

00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:23.166
from morning till evening, still it won't be enough for them.

00:28:24.417 --> 00:28:26.500
Now that your poverty has perished,

00:28:27.166 --> 00:28:29.000
all is well, you have everything to eat and drink

00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:31.375
and you are not a beggar any more,

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.583
then why do you have to lie?

00:28:37.792 --> 00:28:38.999
So on this day, take this resolution

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:40.792
we are not going to lie and if anyone is a liar

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.083
then we are not going to support that person,

00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:45.917
we are not going to establish any connection with him.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:51.917
There is a lot of peace and happiness in this.

00:28:53.792 --> 00:29:00.000
You know a liar will go to Hell

00:29:01.959 --> 00:29:05.792
and you too will follow him.

00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:07.709
God has given you realization,

00:29:08.792 --> 00:29:10.500
you have been enlightened within.

00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:15.208
See, in that light, if there are other people like you,

00:29:15.792 --> 00:29:18.917
you should take a resolution that you will never tell lies

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.667
let our heads be cut off, whatever it may be.

00:29:24.667 --> 00:29:29.208
In this matter the Indians are very much better,

00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:32.291
I know, but when I hear about them outside

00:29:32.834 --> 00:29:35.000
then I feel very sad about it.

00:29:35.875 --> 00:29:37.625
Now, the way these roads are made,

00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:41.709
are they roads in any sense?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.750
I felt as if we were going through some forests.

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:50.792
You have an organization so whenever you see such a thing,

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.709
you can call for any enquiry who made such type of road?

00:29:55.333 --> 00:29:58.000
Why he made? Who ate up the money?

00:30:00.083 --> 00:30:03.417
All the Sahaja yogis should get united

00:30:04.542 --> 00:30:16.041
and try to drive this bhoot (possession) out of our country.

00:30:18.999 --> 00:30:23.792
Wherever we go people say, " Don't believe the Indians"

00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:26.750
How shameful this is!

00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:34.667
The people who should be trusted the most are – we Indians.

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:39.542
We have had such great leaders,

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:44.208
great saints and great souls over here

00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:49.709
but we don't think of the name and fame they had,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.125
how much people respected them and they respect you too,

00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:58.792
but don't support the thieves.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.542
If you know that a particular person is a thief

00:31:01.792 --> 00:31:05.166
then you don't go to his place to eat,

00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:10.500
this would become difficult for the thieves.

00:31:11.041 --> 00:31:13.125
I am telling you

00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:16.875
you are the police force of the Divine and

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:21.417
you try to keep a note of all the thieves whom you come across.

00:31:23.291 --> 00:31:25.667
Try to instill this courage in your children too.

00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:31.667
Try to find out about the people who are wrong doers and liars.

00:31:32.792 --> 00:31:40.709
This country of ours has been awakened by a number of saints

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:43.709
and you all are also saints.

00:31:44.917 --> 00:31:46.750
There is no need for you to tell lies,

00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:48.959
what will happen if you get food only once a day?

00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:51.709
No one dies if he doesn't eat.

00:31:52.458 --> 00:31:54.458
We people are getting to eat and drink

00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:56.750
but on the top of it, we want to drink liquor.

00:31:57.083 --> 00:32:01.583
Secondly on drinking liquor we can hardly walk even a step.

00:32:03.333 --> 00:32:05.375
On the contrary we get destroyed.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.083
We cannot live well upon the addiction of liquor.

00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:13.500
Now, for example in America,

00:32:15.583 --> 00:32:17.166
they have taken out a new issue, that

00:32:17.417 --> 00:32:20.709
when a child turns 16 years then he will earn for himself.

00:32:21.208 --> 00:32:23.458
This means that all are servants.

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:28.041
They are given money for whatever work they do; washing vehicles.

00:32:28.792 --> 00:32:30.709
And at the age of 16 what they say,

00:32:31.959 --> 00:32:37.083
Sir you are 16 years of age and now you go out

00:32:38.291 --> 00:32:39.500
I have seen everywhere,

00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:43.375
these poor children who are 16 years of age,

00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:47.500
we think, that he is just now turning 16 where will he go?

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:52.375
What about education? He is of 16 years now!

00:32:52.917 --> 00:32:54.583
He is thrown out of his house.

00:32:55.166 --> 00:32:58.500
He is driven out of the house, both by his father and mother.

00:32:58.583 --> 00:33:01.333
How long will this continue with the Americans, you just see.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:04.125
They are getting ruined.

00:33:05.041 --> 00:33:07.500
By buying one or two aeroplanes, nobody becomes great.

00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:15.709
Where are you? What is your capacity?

00:33:16.875 --> 00:33:20.792
India is such a country which can serve the whole world

00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:33.291
But for that, there should be truthfulness in it.

00:33:33.834 --> 00:33:39.500
Where is the need for falsehood, I can't understand!

00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:44.917
Most of the people who are rich should first of all know

00:33:45.792 --> 00:33:48.583
that you are rich, sit quietly now

00:33:49.792 --> 00:33:52.208
and don't think of earning more.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:58.125
I didn't see anyone who became happier through earning more.

00:34:00.333 --> 00:34:04.291
You are a Sahaja Yogi and you have the light in you.

00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:10.083
You can see your path in this light and the path is of truth.

00:34:11.792 --> 00:34:15.667
You may be a Muslim, may be a Hindu or may be a Christian

00:34:17.875 --> 00:34:20.333
it makes no difference. You are all human beings.

00:34:21.375 --> 00:34:23.875
And if human beings do not have honesty in them

00:34:25.208 --> 00:34:29.667
then they are dishonest. He won't be known to anyone.

00:34:30.458 --> 00:34:34.917
We have life beyond this too, how would that be?

00:34:36.834 --> 00:34:39.500
There are many benefits of being honest.

00:34:40.458 --> 00:34:41.750
The greatest of all is that

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.041
you have the blessing of God with you.

00:34:46.375 --> 00:34:48.291
You have the kind of blessings

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:52.083
that you will be surprised to know.

00:34:52.417 --> 00:34:55.250
Without any efforts all your things are set in order.

00:34:55.999 --> 00:35:00.500
But now in India, whatever the condition of the people –

00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:03.834
they may have, they may not have, all run after money.

00:35:04.208 --> 00:35:06.458
There are still many more poor people

00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:13.041
and so it should be Diwali celebrations for them also today.

00:35:13.583 --> 00:35:15.166
They too should be happy.

00:35:15.542 --> 00:35:17.417
We live in the same country.

00:35:18.083 --> 00:35:22.458
But we deceive ourselves. We are very clever.

00:35:25.375 --> 00:35:28.417
By this we become egoistic inside.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.166
And by becoming egoistic nobody can save you in any way.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.500
Under the influence of your ego you can get cancer.

00:35:39.709 --> 00:35:41.792
Then you can't save yourself.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.333
If you have cancer within you then you cannot save yourself.

00:35:45.625 --> 00:35:48.625
I too cannot save you. I am telling you the fact.

00:35:49.208 --> 00:35:54.041
Firstly burn your ego in the fire.

00:35:56.375 --> 00:35:59.000
If you have an ego then you should be ashamed of it.

00:36:00.125 --> 00:36:02.333
For what are you having ego?

00:36:03.792 --> 00:36:05.834
In our country it is for everything.

00:36:06.291 --> 00:36:08.834
If some one has done a BA he gets egoistic

00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:13.875
and if he does something more than that, he gets a double ego.

00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:17.875
If someone has achieved something,

00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:20.125
if he becomes an engineer or a doctor

00:36:20.792 --> 00:36:23.166
then he becomes egoistic.

00:36:23.834 --> 00:36:25.792
When his Agnya chakra gets caught up

00:36:26.375 --> 00:36:31.166
where will it take you straight to? To Hell

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.333
and hell is a very horrible place.

00:36:37.917 --> 00:36:40.834
God has given you intelligence and

00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:43.291
now you have got your realization.

00:36:44.417 --> 00:36:48.583
And even after that if you want to go to hell you can go.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.875
Till today nobody has spoken of this.

00:36:53.792 --> 00:36:59.125
Today is an auspicious day,

00:36:59.542 --> 00:37:01.750
because many things took place on this day.

00:37:02.125 --> 00:37:06.250
Sitaji returned during the period of “Ramchandraji”,

00:37:07.999 --> 00:37:14.083
whatever great deeds were done during the period of “Krishnaji”

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.917
were done by people who were realized souls.

00:37:19.917 --> 00:37:22.458
So the first thing that you decide for sure is

00:37:22.959 --> 00:37:25.500
that we won't do any dishonest deed at the same time

00:37:26.166 --> 00:37:29.291
if any one else does then we will get him exposed.

00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:34.625
But I am seeing in this country that

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:36.500
the whites are fighting the blacks,

00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:38.667
someone is fighting with someone else.

00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:42.583
They want the country of India to be separated

00:37:42.834 --> 00:37:45.000
which is not going to be beneficial at all.

00:37:45.375 --> 00:37:50.166
How can it be beneficial when you are honest

00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:54.041
and when you have a good character!

00:37:55.333 --> 00:37:57.792
Whatever we have learnt from the English people,

00:37:58.291 --> 00:37:59.667
there is nothing worth learning from them.

00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:05.041
They are all in a very bad state now.

00:38:06.959 --> 00:38:10.750
But we have to save our own country and save the whole world.

00:38:11.667 --> 00:38:13.208
It is a great responsibility;

00:38:13.959 --> 00:38:17.500
you have been given realization, you have been enlightened,

00:38:18.083 --> 00:38:23.333
still if you want to fall in the ditch then what can anyone do?

00:38:27.208 --> 00:38:29.750
Everyone should come together and try.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.458
I want the Sahaja Yogis to form a committee

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.375
and if you come across any theft

00:38:37.792 --> 00:38:40.417
then it should be brought to the notice of the committee

00:38:40.917 --> 00:38:42.999
and then see, what the committee does.

00:38:43.917 --> 00:38:46.500
In this way you will get fame and

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.125
you will reach to a very high position.

00:38:50.875 --> 00:38:52.417
So the first thing would be that

00:38:52.917 --> 00:38:55.834
neither should you be dishonest nor let others to be dishonest.

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.166
This is very important.

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.792
Your country has been blemished.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.583
In the oil there is adulteration

00:39:06.792 --> 00:39:08.166
then in the Ghee there is adulteration.

00:39:09.458 --> 00:39:12.750
Where ever we see, people are laughing at us.

00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:14.834
No one believes

00:39:15.542 --> 00:39:17.999
but actually the best of people are in India.

00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:22.917
The number of people who have got their realization

00:39:24.875 --> 00:39:26.999
is more than anywhere else in the world.

00:39:27.417 --> 00:39:29.750
They have not earned any virtue.

00:39:31.709 --> 00:39:34.041
So it is better to earn virtue than to earn money.

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.667
See the people who are very poor.

00:39:44.166 --> 00:39:47.625
So this day is a very auspicious day and also a very joyful day.

00:39:48.792 --> 00:39:54.208
Why joyful? Because today we have got heaven

00:39:55.834 --> 00:39:57.667
and we want to stay in heaven alone.

00:39:58.999 --> 00:40:02.583
But cowardly people cannot enter the Heaven.

00:40:04.375 --> 00:40:05.999
There is no need to be afraid.

00:40:07.625 --> 00:40:09.709
If you get a couple of rupees more or less

00:40:11.834 --> 00:40:13.792
which disaster is going to befall upon you?

00:40:16.083 --> 00:40:18.333
All have become rich. I have been seeing.

00:40:18.792 --> 00:40:22.000
I have been coming here for the past 17-18 years now.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.834
You have become richer than before.

00:40:25.667 --> 00:40:27.750
The situation is better than before.

00:40:28.542 --> 00:40:29.999
But from morning to evening

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.375
there is dishonesty, dishonesty and dishonesty.

00:40:34.709 --> 00:40:36.667
So the path has been made.

00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:43.125
So, today just promise that, we are not going to be dishonest

00:40:43.792 --> 00:40:47.959
and if anybody is, then we all will unitedly oppose.

00:40:48.709 --> 00:40:50.709
Why have you been given Sahaja Yoga?

00:40:51.208 --> 00:40:52.999
Why have you been given realization?

00:40:53.375 --> 00:40:57.083
So that you can spread light, if you have no light internally

00:40:57.417 --> 00:40:59.959
then how can you spread light outside?

00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:05.583
And with that light you see, you are helping the dishonest?

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:11.458
Nothing will happen if you earn a little less or more.

00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:16.208
If you are honest then God will help you!

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.125
Why are so many people dying in our country?

00:41:20.542 --> 00:41:23.834
Nowhere else they die, so many of them.

00:41:23.917 --> 00:41:26.041
The reason is that they have to go to Hell.

00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:32.250
So, you have to know this that if you are dishonest

00:41:33.417 --> 00:41:36.583
then your first step to Hell is already over and

00:41:39.375 --> 00:41:42.333
then the second step of telling lies will not be necessary.

00:41:43.291 --> 00:41:44.750
You tell the truth.

00:41:46.166 --> 00:41:53.792
The person who will tell the truth would be a unique person.

00:41:54.166 --> 00:41:59.917
If he is a Sahaja Yogi then it would be the best.

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.542
The way people are remembering the sufis,

00:42:03.041 --> 00:42:05.667
the same way people are going to remember you.

00:42:06.417 --> 00:42:08.083
You don't have to do anything.

00:42:08.834 --> 00:42:11.834
Just catch hold of those who are dishonest

00:42:14.959 --> 00:42:17.166
it is very much necessary.

00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:19.125
Here people are fighting

00:42:19.375 --> 00:42:21.750
to stop the rubbish from being thrown into Jamunaji

00:42:22.583 --> 00:42:24.709
this too needs to be told!

00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:26.458
I have been to so many countries!

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.750
nobody throws waste into the river.

00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:35.625
Why are you so lazy? There are so many facilities over here.

00:42:36.458 --> 00:42:41.750
You can give the waste to the Municipality.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.375
Dispose somewhere, but if you yourself throw waste

00:42:47.166 --> 00:42:49.375
then what can one do?

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.750
Today all of you decide in your mind and take a resolution

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.208
it is a very auspicious day today, very auspicious day, that

00:42:57.166 --> 00:43:01.625
“We won't do any dishonest deed nor will we believe in dishonesty”

00:43:04.625 --> 00:43:06.375
I have seen people who were neither dishonest

00:43:07.875 --> 00:43:10.625
nor did they go to the house of people who were dishonest.

00:43:11.792 --> 00:43:13.500
They had nothing to do with them

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:18.333
because they were concerned not only about their own welfare

00:43:18.625 --> 00:43:20.291
but also the welfare of the whole country.

00:43:22.458 --> 00:43:24.166
So you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.166
so you need to make a promise

00:43:26.999 --> 00:43:29.500
that we are not going to do any thing dishonest.

00:43:32.375 --> 00:43:35.458
You just recognise a person who is dishonest

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.834
and then tell your inner soul that he is dishonest.

00:43:44.458 --> 00:43:48.333
And, Sahaja Yogis, even if twelve Sahaja Yogis come together

00:43:49.542 --> 00:43:52.125
and if they come to know that he is dishonest

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:57.709
then the Divine will be there to support.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:05.750
This country won't benefit by a few rich people,

00:44:06.166 --> 00:44:09.583
but it will definitely benefit by honest people.

00:44:10.709 --> 00:44:13.125
The greatest stigma that has been put on us

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.000
is that we are dishonest.

00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:18.083
Those who are Sahaja Yogis can never be dishonest.

00:44:25.625 --> 00:44:30.125
We all have to be united, leaving aside all quarrels

00:44:30.875 --> 00:44:33.250
and assumptions that we are honest people.

00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:35.999
India's image is very much tarnished,

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:45.709
hence take a vow today that from now onwards

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.500
we shall not be dishonest and

00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:52.999
if there are any dishonest people we shall all get after him

00:44:54.875 --> 00:44:57.458
Next day he will be unable to sleep in peace

00:45:01.834 --> 00:45:03.875
But this has increased too much.

00:45:04.792 --> 00:45:07.166
I am astonished at the level of dishonesty,

00:45:08.166 --> 00:45:11.542
dishonesty in everything, dishonesty in everything.

00:45:12.208 --> 00:45:17.291
Earlier they used to outcast on every minor issue and

00:45:18.917 --> 00:45:23.000
they used to separate themselves for even very minor things.

00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:30.875
But our country was so honest, it had such nice qualities.

00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:37.250
Have we forgotten them? Where have they gone?

00:45:38.792 --> 00:45:45.333
I can see dishonesty everywhere, dishonesty at every step.

00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:51.959
We have to teach the children that they should not be dishonest.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.667
Yes, if they are dying with hunger,

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.999
then arrangements can be made for that too,

00:46:00.333 --> 00:46:02.750
but only if he is honest.

00:46:03.083 --> 00:46:09.458
If you are not honest then nobody can help you, not even God.

00:46:10.125 --> 00:46:12.333
He will get all kinds of diseases of the world.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.792
There are many such traditions in our country

00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:22.999
they will drink liquor, drink wine.

00:46:24.041 --> 00:46:29.917
Tell me, have you come here to become a fool?

00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:36.041
And don't be a friend of one who does it. Don't help them.

00:46:37.917 --> 00:46:40.417
I have seen people who go to the houses of people

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:46.250
who drink liquor, then they too start taking liquor.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:48.834
But when you know

00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:50.667
that a person is of such a character,

00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:55.250
when you know that he is dishonest, then,

00:46:55.709 --> 00:47:00.625
stop eating at his place. You have nothing to do with him.

00:47:01.917 --> 00:47:04.375
We have to work for the well being of our country

00:47:04.709 --> 00:47:06.709
because God has given us light. See in that light.

00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:11.709
His power is tremendous.

00:47:12.417 --> 00:47:18.875
If you decide that, those who are dishonest to the nation

00:47:20.875 --> 00:47:24.333
will be taken care by God, then that alone is enough.

00:47:25.208 --> 00:47:28.083
But you are turning deaf. You are not able to understand.

00:47:30.458 --> 00:47:32.667
Such a person can never do any good deed;

00:47:33.709 --> 00:47:35.417
nor can he ever give.

00:47:36.709 --> 00:47:41.500
I cannot understand how they live so shamelessly.

00:47:42.417 --> 00:47:50.000
So, that is why today's message is that

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.959
you have to take a vow that

00:47:54.458 --> 00:47:57.417
we are not going to be dishonest in any way and

00:47:57.792 --> 00:48:00.500
if any one is dishonest then we are not going to support him.

00:48:01.166 --> 00:48:03.625
That is enough.

00:48:04.083 --> 00:48:08.250
Many more realized souls will come to our country.

00:48:09.792 --> 00:48:12.542
But who would like to come to such a dishonest country?

00:48:14.166 --> 00:48:16.250
So today the only message is that

00:48:16.834 --> 00:48:21.375
you have light and if you walk in that light,

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
it will give you strength.

00:48:24.417 --> 00:48:27.750
You can do whatever you want to do.

00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:33.000
Look, we have achieved our “Swatantra”.

00:48:34.667 --> 00:48:37.750
“Swatantra” is the mechanism of understanding oneself.

00:48:38.458 --> 00:48:40.792
Now I want a lot of realized children to be born ,

00:48:41.375 --> 00:48:51.792
so learn that it is a very great day today,

00:48:53.166 --> 00:48:54.458
take a vow today

00:48:55.417 --> 00:49:01.208
that neither will we be dishonest nor support the dishonest.

00:49:02.375 --> 00:49:04.333
Not even be scared of them;

00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:07.583
God is not with them at all. God is with you.

00:49:10.834 --> 00:49:15.000
If you are good then God is with you.

00:49:15.667 --> 00:49:19.583
All the people had taken birth on this very land of India

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.250
not for the sake of fighting,

00:49:24.583 --> 00:49:26.917
dying amongst yourselves, great fools!

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.750
We are fighting, dying,

00:49:30.417 --> 00:49:32.917
there is no benefit in fighting, tell the people.

00:49:33.875 --> 00:49:36.875
“Oh! why are you fighting? What do you want?

00:49:37.625 --> 00:49:43.750
After all you have nice things to eat and drink,

00:49:44.041 --> 00:49:46.125
what more do you want?”

00:49:47.458 --> 00:49:49.291
But nowadays what is most prevalent is that ,

00:49:49.667 --> 00:49:50.959
we want such and such clothes,

00:49:51.625 --> 00:49:56.375
we want such type of a house and we don't have that,

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.959
with all that we will only go to hell.

00:50:03.542 --> 00:50:07.709
In those times there were many who were sufis,

00:50:08.458 --> 00:50:12.625
like them you are all sufis, because you are all cleansed.

00:50:14.542 --> 00:50:18.999
Now all of you write the poem of honesty.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.458
This dishonesty has got to go, that is the first thing

00:50:26.083 --> 00:50:31.709
and secondly there are many issues which need to be corrected.

00:50:32.375 --> 00:50:35.500
But see, first of all don't be dishonest

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.959
No one is so poor in India that we have to resort to dishonesty.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:47.625
I am saying that our country is tarnished.

00:50:48.125 --> 00:50:50.250
This needs to be wiped off.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.625
You are Sahaja Yogis and you can do it.

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:58.542
You have light, with this light

00:50:58.999 --> 00:51:03.625
you can spread the light everywhere

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:08.375
and give courage to all, that its alright.

00:51:09.041 --> 00:51:11.959
Particularly those of you who are young, who are friends

00:51:12.583 --> 00:51:16.417
have to think what all honest deeds you can do.

00:51:18.583 --> 00:51:21.375
Now they have started – don't throw rubbish into “Jamunaji”.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.375
That is alright but it is not so important.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.917
What is important is to get rid of dishonesty.

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:36.750
That is why this day is considered auspicious everywhere.

00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:39.542
Lamps are lit all around.

00:51:40.166 --> 00:51:44.583
In spite of everything if we can't do this

00:51:45.792 --> 00:51:48.417
then what is the benefit of Sahaja Yoga?

00:51:49.166 --> 00:51:56.417
The largest number of Sahaja yogis are in India.

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:07.500
Then comes Russia. Now, the Russian people are very polite.

00:52:08.709 --> 00:52:12.750
They do no commit any robberies. I don't know why?

00:52:14.792 --> 00:52:17.208
May be if communism comes to India

00:52:17.625 --> 00:52:20.125
then we too might become like them;

00:52:20.542 --> 00:52:22.875
but that is not a very great thing.

00:52:25.417 --> 00:52:27.000
If somebody does something out of compulsion

00:52:27.542 --> 00:52:29.166
then it is not good.

00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:31.834
Decide that we should be powerful ourselves.

00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:38.000
Today you decide, today is a very auspicious day that

00:52:38.542 --> 00:52:43.250
neither will you be dishonest nor let others be dishonest.

00:52:49.458 --> 00:52:52.458
Your country will then prosper a lot.

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:58.667
I have seen what other countries are and how its people are

00:52:59.333 --> 00:53:00.834
all are useless people.

00:53:01.542 --> 00:53:07.667
But the people of our country are still religious

00:53:11.041 --> 00:53:14.542
Religiousness will perish in our country

00:53:15.166 --> 00:53:17.458
if these dishonest people become so powerful.

00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:20.542
So the only message is that

00:53:21.792 --> 00:53:25.959
neither will we be dishonest nor will we allow others to do so.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:33.458
But the people here are very tolerant in this matter.

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:37.999
They tolerate, this is their greatest mistake.

00:53:38.667 --> 00:53:41.417
When you have got the light, why are you scared?

00:53:43.125 --> 00:53:45.083
What is the need for you to be afraid?

00:53:49.999 --> 00:53:55.000
That is why I am requesting you today, be courageous

00:53:55.959 --> 00:53:58.166
and now one kind of liberation has been achieved.

00:53:58.667 --> 00:53:59.999
You will achieve “swatantra”,

00:54:00.667 --> 00:54:02.041
the “tantra” (Mechanism) of “swa”(Oneself),

00:54:02.458 --> 00:54:08.667
you have achieved it. But make use of it.

00:54:13.166 --> 00:54:15.875
Today, you are so many people gathered here.

00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:18.375
I have never seen so many in Delhi.

00:54:27.959 --> 00:54:30.500
So, today you all decide within yourself

00:54:31.542 --> 00:54:35.834
that you are not going to believe any dishonest people

00:54:37.709 --> 00:54:40.208
and all the devils take birth

00:54:41.667 --> 00:54:44.166
for this very reason that we have something in us

00:54:44.709 --> 00:54:47.625
which makes them think that we will believe them.

00:54:48.709 --> 00:54:51.375
Indians should never believe

00:54:52.125 --> 00:54:57.291
and the ones who are realized should never at all.

00:54:59.834 --> 00:55:02.667
There is one great aspersion on our country everywhere

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.834
which is not true. India has many people who are honest

00:55:08.083 --> 00:55:11.709
many and this aspersion is not true.

00:55:12.208 --> 00:55:16.166
I have also seen this,

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:23.834
They will fight this land is ours and that land is yours.

00:55:24.959 --> 00:55:28.333
Whatever you have is swaraja, kingdom of oneself

00:55:29.583 --> 00:55:31.125
one's own kingdom.

00:55:32.625 --> 00:55:33.959
You will have kingdom of your own

00:55:34.667 --> 00:55:38.041
when you would become swatantra in the true sense.

00:55:38.792 --> 00:55:44.458
There is no need to fear anyone no need to tell anyone.

00:55:50.542 --> 00:55:53.583
I am surprised to see so many people.

00:55:53.875 --> 00:55:55.834
I had never seen so many people in Delhi.

00:56:07.625 --> 00:56:12.542
So, my only request to you on this auspicious day is that

00:56:13.125 --> 00:56:15.667
we should decide, we should never be dishonest,

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.750
even if we have to die.

00:56:19.583 --> 00:56:21.875
Our country has deteriorated in the last ten years.

00:56:25.125 --> 00:56:28.709
You are so many Sahaja yogis. What are you afraid of?

00:56:32.959 --> 00:56:34.625
What is the issue to be scared of?

00:56:38.709 --> 00:56:41.417
The Divine is there behind everyone.

00:56:48.999 --> 00:56:51.208
When the Sufis came to know

00:56:52.959 --> 00:56:55.250
that the divine was there with them

00:56:56.041 --> 00:57:00.834
they got rid of all unwanted things from this world.

00:57:01.291 --> 00:57:08.000
Not all sufis but a few did. So you all have to do it.

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:14.041
So the message for today is that

00:57:14.458 --> 00:57:19.583
you yourself should never be a thief nor support any thief.

00:57:20.709 --> 00:57:26.208
But I am seeing people fighting on more and more issues,

00:57:28.917 --> 00:57:32.458
fighting on issues of caste and religion.

00:57:32.917 --> 00:57:36.999
Are you here to save the country or to get drowned?

00:57:39.917 --> 00:57:41.750
You have a great responsibility.

00:57:42.583 --> 00:57:44.458
You have been born in Kaliyuga.

00:57:45.792 --> 00:57:48.208
This kaliyuga has to be changed

00:57:49.917 --> 00:57:53.333
and that is why so many thousands of you are realized.

00:57:53.792 --> 00:57:58.417
So many people were never realized anywhere else in the world.

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.999
That is why I am requesting you again and again

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:08.458
that always stand on Truth and I will be there with you.

00:58:13.083 --> 00:58:21.667
God is also with you.

00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:29.000
So the request to you all is to firmly decide within yourself

00:58:29.834 --> 00:58:33.375
that we are not going to allow any theft, robberies

00:58:36.417 --> 00:58:40.083
and wherever we find them we will fight it.

00:58:41.667 --> 00:58:45.000
But the people seem to be drunk or what?

00:58:48.875 --> 00:58:55.333
What did they achieve from this light? Courage.

00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:59.083
Fight with courage.

00:58:59.625 --> 00:59:02.083
Whatever is wrong should be removed from this country.

00:59:02.875 --> 00:59:10.208
It is very tarnished, still there are many more issues

00:59:10.667 --> 00:59:12.625
but the most important one is that

00:59:13.041 --> 00:59:17.834
if there is no honesty then how can God help you?

00:59:19.667 --> 00:59:21.875
Earning money is of no use to God.

00:59:22.417 --> 00:59:26.375
But getting your religion is and that you have achieved.

00:59:27.834 --> 00:59:30.375
There are not so many Sahaja yogis in this world

00:59:32.959 --> 00:59:35.458
and then Sahaja yogis don't do such deeds.

00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:37.834
But I am telling you all this because

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.959
the atmosphere here is very bad

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:47.625
and we people have such a bad name everywhere.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.083
You have everything to eat and drink, clothes to dress,

00:59:54.667 --> 00:59:56.792
what else do you want?

01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:05.709
You watch movies, you do have that much money.

01:00:07.999 --> 01:00:13.000
But the addiction for money which is there should be got rid off.

01:00:16.792 --> 01:00:20.875
I have full hope that you will heed my words.

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:29.542
So we should take a vow that we will not be dishonest

01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:34.375
and we would oppose the people who are dishonest.

01:00:49.709 --> 01:00:52.291
Understand that the greatest thing

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.709
that our country needs today is honesty.

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:03.667
There is nothing greater than that. Honesty is your mother.

01:01:06.333 --> 01:01:08.375
So what if you have one shirt in the place of ten?

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.792
Tell the ladies also the same thing.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.417
It will happen. It will take place.

01:01:17.999 --> 01:01:22.417
Today's speech is a little different, it is unique

01:01:27.291 --> 01:01:33.417
and it is very gracious of you all to have liked it.

01:01:38.834 --> 01:01:41.542
Thank you.
