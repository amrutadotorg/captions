1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:10,540
I think some of the Sahaja Yogis were rather
amazed that I accepted Rita’s invitation

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:20,880
to come to this place! Rita has been very
kind to call me here.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:30,490
Every place has its own attractions, as far
as the Divine is concerned.

4
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:42,040
And I knew there must be some very deep seekers
in this place who could be really benefited

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:51,780
if I could visit this place. And I was overjoyed
to arrive here.

6
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:03,370
Now the question about Sahaja Yoga is very
simple to understand. All that is vital is

7
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:10,870
extremely simple. For example the way we breathe
is so simple. We don’t read any book, we

8
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:17,760
don’t do any exercise for that. We don’t
have to go and learn from anyone, we just

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:28,540
do it. In the same way, if our seeking has
some meaning and if we have to find out something

10
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:36,250
it must be the most vital thing offered. It’s
not just an alternative life. Many people

11
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,880
have a feeling that the seekers are nothing
but they are finding alternative theories,

12
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:50,220
and to alternate, with the present norms and
conditions – it’s not so.

13
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,290
The time, that is today, the modern times,
are special times described in the ancient

14
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:04,010
scriptures in India and also in The Bible
and Koran. In all the scriptures they are

15
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:15,700
described. In the Koran they are described
as the resurrection time. Christ has many

16
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:26,500
a time talked about it that: you have to know
My Father forever. That your hands will speak.

17
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:34,680
Lots of descriptions he has given of this
state which you will achieve at a time. As

18
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:45,260
in life you have seen [that] a tree has to
grow. First it may have just one or two flowers

19
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,140
but when time comes when the same tree which
has only one or two flowers – about, say,

20
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:58,130
two years back [or] three years back – suddenly
gets into a blossom time and has lots of flowers.

21
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:04,060
Like that, today is the time of blossom time
of all the seekers.

22
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,180
So many seekers have taken birth today on
this Earth. Especially England it’s described

23
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,950
by William Blake that these times are going
to come when England is going to become Jerusalem.

24
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,250
‘Jerusalem’ means ‘where it will be
pilgrimage.’ For people will think this

25
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,970
is the Holy Land of God. That people will
come to this Holy Land, to visit this place.

26
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,970
So the people have to be holy, they have to.
It’s not the trees that are going to become

27
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:38,230
holy, it is not the land that is going to
be holy but it’s the people. Their hearts

28
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,090
are going to be holy.

29
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,680
Then how do they become holy? What happen
to a person when he really becomes holy? We

30
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,620
talk of saints. We talk of prophets. What
is the difference between these revered people

31
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:04,760
and ordinary people? There’s only one difference.
The difference is this: that in their attention,

32
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,220
in their central nervous system, there is
the light of their Spirit. While for the other

33
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,290
people, they live in ignorance without this
light of the Spirit.

34
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:24,180
The Spirit exists in every one of us. It is
always there, present, all the time. It’s

35
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,880
Omnipresent. It’s all the time present within
us. But the problem is that we are not aware

36
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,020
of it, that it is not shining in our attention,
in our awareness.

37
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,370
When Gavin told you about the new awareness
it means that the awareness that we have,

38
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,990
the human awareness, becomes enlightened – a
new awareness – and in that awareness what

39
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,400
happens is that our Spirit manifests.

40
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,210
Now one may say, Mother it must be a difficult
thing. People have to do so many tapasya,

41
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:09,610
they have to do so much penance and they have
to go to Himalayas and do all kinds of things,

42
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,050
stand on their heads for days together, and
how is it that it is working so easily now?

43
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:19,520
Actually that kind of thing is not needed
today because the time has come.

44
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:31,490
When the time has come it just work out fast,
it works out en masse. Now I am with you here

45
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,130
but in India, those people who have visited
with me know that there are thousands of people

46
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:40,050
for every programme I go [to] there. And all
of them get realisation. All of them get realisation.

47
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,860
Means they started feeling the All-pervading
Power for the first time on their hands. “Your

48
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,750
hands will speak.” First time the All-pervading
Power about which Christ has described, every

49
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:02,210
scripture has described, you start to feel
it as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

50
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,090
Now this feeling, somebody can say, “Could
be due to this, could be due to that,” because

51
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:13,710
we are doubting Thomases sometimes and we
start doubting it. But the thing is, you can

52
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:20,580
see, in so many people, the rising of the
power from the triangular bone which is called

53
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,660
as ‘Sacrum’. Surprisingly ‘sacrum’
means ‘sacred’. That means that Greeks

54
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:31,190
knew that it is a sacred bone, it’s a sacred
bone. Nowadays this word has no meaning but

55
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:38,090
it will come back when people realise what
is sacred.

56
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:46,520
In this bone, the triangular bone, we have
this power called Kundalini settled down.

57
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,500
This residual power which creates us, which
creates the whole being, is still not manifested,

58
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,630
it is still sleeping. Because it is the power
of our desire which is the ultimate desire

59
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:05,420
to become one with the Spirit, to feel the
All-pervading Power, to be the instrument

60
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,750
of the God.

61
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:15,680
Until this power, or we can say this power
of desire has manifested itself, we are not

62
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,930
going to be happy people. We can try anything
we like [but we will not].

63
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,210
Now, in the beginning you may say, that so
many prophets came in: Christ came in, all

64
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:32,380
of them came just to make us ready for this
day when we can be born again. Christ has

65
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,130
clearly said you have to be born again. Now
who is bothered about it? There are people

66
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,910
I have met who have certified themselves “born
again,” but you can’t certify yourself

67
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:46,420
as “born again”. “Born again” means
a person who has felt this All-pervading Power.

68
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:55,050
Who can make this All-pervading Power flow
through his being and can manoeuvre it and

69
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,700
understand it.

70
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:04,160
Now this All-pervading Power is the power
that has all the powers that you see: all

71
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,830
this electricity, everything is a part of
that power. That’s the vitality of the whole

72
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,740
Universe, that has created this Universe.
This All-pervading Power that flows when you

73
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,860
get your realisation, gives you tremendous
powers. But the biggest power it gives you

74
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:28,740
is to love. God is love, and His power is
the power of love. He really loves us. He

75
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,830
loves us so much that He is the one who wants
to save us. It is He who is anxious to save

76
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:42,590
His creation. He doesn’t want that His creation
which He has created with such love with such

77
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:49,080
attention, with such delicate help, out of
which you are the epitome of His creation.

78
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,380
The human beings are the highest, and [for
them] to be destroyed – that He cannot bear.

79
00:08:54,380 --> 00:09:01,120
And it is His desire that is flowering today
as Sahaja Yoga and that the people are getting

80
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,440
Self-realisation in such a mass quantities.

81
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,900
But the main problem today is that there are
so many in the market that people don’t

82
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:19,710
know what to do. To begin with, we have churches,
we have mosques, we have temples, we have

83
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:27,000
all kinds of people selling God, or maybe
talking about God, or saying that, “This

84
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,470
is God.”

85
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,990
Now these religions came on this Earth, all
the Prophets came on this Earth, to establish

86
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:43,640
a balance within us, as I told you, to prepare
us for the ultimate. But I have noticed that

87
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:51,400
without enlightenment whatever is the belief,
whether it is Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism,

88
00:09:51,400 --> 00:10:01,300
all any isms or Communism or Capitalism or
any sort of thing, it is fanatic belief.

89
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,500
The reason is without the light, you can not
see.

90
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,730
For example, I come upon this table, I feel
this table [when] there is no light [in the

91
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,830
room]. To me this table is the main thing,
the rest doesn’t exist. To another person

92
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,270
comes here and sees a chair, to him this chair,
nothing [else] exists. Now this myth that

93
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:27,050
he believes into, he has to establish it.
It’s a myth because he’s not yet enlightened

94
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,820
and he cannot enlighten other people so it’s
a myth. And he has to adhere to that myth

95
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:44,440
with such glue-like tenacity that created
a great barrier between him and the Truth.

96
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:53,590
Because he has not known the Reality yet.
Reality is very different from what we feel

97
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,570
today as human beings.

98
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:03,040
For example, I will tell you that this Gavin
(Brown) who has today spoke to, met me about

99
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,280
six, seven years back or we should say more
than that.

100
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:13,550
And first he got his realisation I told him,
“This is All-pervading Power. ” He started

101
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,930
feeling the Cool Breeze. He said, “Mother
how are we to know that it has got telecommunication,

102
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,760
it has every way of informing us?” I said,
“Alright, what do you want to find out?”

103
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:28,320
He said, “I want to find out about my father.”
I said, “Alright, you put your hands and

104
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,380
just ask ‘how is my father?’.” And he
asked this question: immediately he started

105
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,610
getting the burning on his hand, on here.
Now, these are the centres of your father.

106
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:47,270
These are the centres of your mother. When
he started getting the burning here, he said,

107
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,780
“Mother what is this?” I said it means
you father is down with very bad bronchitis.

108
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,080
His father was in Scotland. I said, “Why
don’t you telephone to him and find out?

109
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,430
It’s very easy to find out.” And when
he telephoned, he found out, his mother told,

110
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,910
that, “Your father is down with very bad
bronchitis.” So that is how the information

111
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,440
comes to us from this All-pervading Power.

112
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,540
Now before that, whatever we do, say we talk
of capitalism, we talk of communism. I would

113
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:34,420
say I am the greatest capitalist because I
have all my powers within my control. I have

114
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:47,210
all my powers within my control And I am the
greatest communist because I cannot live without

115
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:54,080
sharing. I have to share them because otherwise
I cannot enjoy all those powers that I have.

116
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:07,840
I really cannot enjoy my own life unless and
until I share it with all of you.

117
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:18,230
I have lots of joy within myself but unless
and until I share my joy with you all, I am

118
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,690
not going to enjoy it. So I am a regular communist.
So all these things you have done, like communism,

119
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,200
capitalism, communism, democracy are nothing
but the myths of the Reality. Like, sometimes

120
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,170
you say, “I am my nose, I am my ears, I
am my eyes.” They are all one!

121
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,830
You do not see the integration. Why? Because
you haven’t yet awakened yourself.

122
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,580
Once you are awakened you find “Oh! I am
the whole body.” All this whole body has

123
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,210
all these different parts which we consider,
“This is good, that is good,” but none

124
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,470
of them have proved to be really perfect.
They are good, but they are not that good.

125
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,150
So there must be some way where all these
things integrate, and they integrate at a

126
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,280
point where you become the Spirit because
Spirit is the thing within you which is the

127
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,000
Collective Being.

128
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,060
Now my husband, as you know, is at the UN
system and you have an agency here called

129
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:52,440
the ‘Maritime Organisation’. And he also
feels that, whatever they are doing on a global

130
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,740
level, on an international level lacks something,
lacks something, in human beings. Because

131
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,130
rationally they understand that the whole
world is the same, that you are my brother

132
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:10,440
and I am your sister this sort of things but
in their hearts there is still something lurking

133
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:18,060
because the heart and the head are not integrated.
We believe into so many things but the heart

134
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,910
and the brain, they are not integrated.

135
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:30,140
How do you find, that the person who is believing
into something but is not doing that? Because

136
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:37,960
they are not integrated. When the heart and
brain both are absolutely integrated then

137
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,440
you do what you believe into, and [if] you
believe into something, then you do that.

138
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,410
Both things go hand in hand, and that’s
how these things that we feel look so funny

139
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,800
with people. They talk so big! They say they,
“We’ll do this for you,” and, “This

140
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,840
is what we feel,” They make all kinds of
drama. And ultimately you find they have no

141
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,460
feels about it. But I do not blame them because
they haven’t found their Spirit, which integrates

142
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:08,900
you completely. And this is the time when
you will get your complete integration in

143
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,420
life.

144
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:17,750
Now coming to absolute mundane level of things:
the other day, a gentleman of the radio came

145
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,390
to interview me and he said, “Alright. You
tell tell me that physical, emotional and

146
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,380
also mental problems can be solved through
Sahaja Yoga.” It’s true. We have cured

147
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:32,160
cancer. There is one girl today, who came
today from America. She has cured a blood

148
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,250
cancer [case]. Of course it’s true. It can
be cured. With this happening, with the awakening

149
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:44,260
of Kundalini you can cure all these diseases.
Heart troubles, all these can be cured. Then

150
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,830
mentally also: many mad people have become
sane people. Many addicts and all sorts of

151
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:58,410
things have become alright. No doubt! It can
be done. But you have to first of all get

152
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:03,790
your realisation. Without that, without that
first step, nothing can be achieved.

153
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,820
First step is that you get your light in.
Now some people think that we should work

154
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,300
very hard and we should cleanse ourselves,
we should do this and we should do that and

155
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,070
then we should take realisation. But why?

156
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:21,870
Unless and until you get out of yourself you
cannot cleanse yourself, you cannot see yourself,

157
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,110
and you cannot understand because you are
so identified. For example, if you correct

158
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,320
somebody, “You have got ego.” He’ll
just punch you on your nose and say, “What

159
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,850
do you mean by such a thing? What do you mean,
‘You have an ego’? You are the one who

160
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,050
has the ego! What do you mean by saying such
a thing to me that ‘You have an ego’?”

161
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:44,180
But when you get your realisation, when the
Kundalini rises, here at this point, where

162
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,080
you see this red mark, behind it, on the optic
chiasma there’s a very subtle centre called

163
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:58,830
Agya chakra. On this centre resides our Lord
Jesus Christ. And He sucks in your ego and

164
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,970
superego. And when your attention is there,
you can see your ego bloating up like a balloon.

165
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,900
You see it and you say, “Oh God! This is
me? Alright.” Nobody minds then if you tell

166
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,870
them that, “Your Agya chakra is catching.”
Nobody minds it. Because they don’t like

167
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,000
it [to be catching]. They want to have these
vibrations flowing into you.

168
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,610
Then there can be a person with a superego.
A person who is always frightened, who has

169
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:29,310
fear and who always keeps quiet and goes into
some sort of alcoholism or something, shuns

170
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:37,100
the society. There could be person like that.
Such a person, also, when he sees light within

171
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,460
himself he becomes normal. Sahaja Yoga is
there to normalise you completely, to make

172
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,420
you a normal person.

173
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,160
But coming to the absolutely mundane thing
like this gentleman asked me a question that,

174
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,100
“What about our unemployment in England?
What do you say? What is the solution you

175
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,790
give for our unemployment if through Sahaja
Yoga?” I said, “That’s a very great

176
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,800
employment for you?” He said, “How?”
I said, “Let’s see how you got employed.

177
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:06,900
Let us be very practical about it.” You
are over developed people. You have got your

178
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,670
railways done, you have got your aeroplanes
done, all kinds of machineries you have finished

179
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:21,350
with. I mean, you have done everything and
to add to it now you have computers! Sitting

180
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,890
down here you can move everybody’s nose
and eyes and everything, you don’t have

181
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:33,690
to move out of here. You can even destroy
the whole world sitting down here. You don’t

182
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,490
have to do anything.

183
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,030
So you have reached that state where, now,
you must rest. You have had too much development.

184
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,850
So, as a holiday, now you are resting. And
that’s how you are unemployed. But, in the

185
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:51,780
subtle way, it is a Divine’s working. How?
Science and all these powers have been given

186
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:58,990
to us, exposed to us because we have to finish
our every day-to-day work and save time. We

187
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:04,220
have been wearing watches. I don’t think
my grandmother wore any watch all her life.

188
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,460
Nor could have been yours also. That time
nobody bothered about time. Time was passing,

189
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,070
nobody bothered about that. But now we are
all the time, “Save the time, save the time,

190
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,690
save the time.” But save for what? Save
for the pub, or save for the ballroom dancing,

191
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:30,050
or for the quarrelling, or for hitting others
or talking ill of others? Save for yourself.

192
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:45,210
Save for your meditation. Save for your ascent.
And this saving itself, the time that you

193
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:52,870
have saved, has brought in the birth of so
many seekers on this Earth.

194
00:19:52,870 --> 00:20:03,490
Now this is the time [that] you have got such
a lot of spare time to you. Why this spare

195
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,940
time has been awarded to you? Is to ascend.
Now you have been employed for worldly things

196
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,200
and worldly materialistic things and all that
but now you are to be employed by God. You

197
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,740
have to seek His employment. Once you get
your realisation, now we have Sahaja Yogis,

198
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:32,480
first I first said all Sahaja Yogis must seek
some jobs. They should not be unemployed.

199
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,330
But just to make it look normal I told that.
But they are so employed now, they have no

200
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:46,010
time, they are so busy. They are giving realisation
to people, they are curing people, they are

201
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:51,730
going round telling them about the message.
They are so busy, they are doing God’s work.

202
00:20:51,730 --> 00:21:03,610
Now you are no more employed with the government.
You are not employed by any private companies,

203
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:15,590
but you are employed by God. So, you are free,
you are getting your food alright, you are

204
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:23,460
getting your pensions alright. Now you work.
I have seen people who are even eighty years

205
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:30,530
old, ninety years old [that] are doing God’s
work. From India, recently when I went to

206
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:36,860
America, a gentleman who is about seventy-six
years of age came down to get me from India,

207
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:45,520
all the way. And he said, “Now I am doing
God’s work, so I am not at all tired, I

208
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:55,550
am not at all afraid.” He and his wife,
both of them, came to Los Angeles to help

209
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,740
me down there.

210
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:20,980
So now the new employment has to start and
that is the employment of God.

211
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:50,010
You can meet the Sahaja Yogis and ask them.
They are very busy people. They have no time.

212
00:22:50,010 --> 00:23:07,990
Now my grandchildren who are here, they are
also born-realised people, they are very enlightened

213
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:26,740
people. And they are very busy. They have
no time for anything. You see, since we have

214
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,010
come here they have been busy going round
and trying to see wider people. Now, we went

215
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:42,000
to the airport one day, and this girl was
tying up like this, very fast, she was doing

216
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:51,740
like this, very fast, like a machine was on.
So her mother asked, “What are you doing?”

217
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:59,090
She said, “I’m trying to tie up the whole
of airport. You see, they are running helter-skelter

218
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:07,990
they are all getting mad!” And this action
works out because the hands are flowing [with]

219
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:18,600
that Divine Power. So this action has a meaning.
And she was working it out like that and she

220
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:26,040
was going on, and she said, “I have to tie
up all these people, they are so speedy, so

221
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:35,850
crazy, they are running fast for nothing at
all.” And she was just trying to do that.

222
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,830
They are all the time busy. [If] you talk
to them, “No I’m just I’m busy!” They

223
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:44,550
will do something here and there and they
try to correct it.

224
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:53,910
So the new employment one has to take. But
the first of all, the first criteria of this

225
00:24:53,910 --> 00:25:02,620
new employment is that you should become the
Spirit. If you are not the Spirit, you cannot

226
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:18,500
do it. So you become the Spirit. Then you
must learn the methods of how to use this

227
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,100
Divine Power, how should it be done.

228
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:28,410
That’s all! It’s so simple. It’s all
made for you. It’s very easy. Nothing to

229
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:38,130
work out. But one should not go on thinking
about it. Because it is beyond thought. By

230
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:48,510
thinking you have built up all these things,
by planning you have done all this. But now

231
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:58,760
you have to enter into the Realm of God, to
be the citizen of God Empire where he gives

232
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:07,440
you powers by which you work out the world.
But the whole. And then you really feel your

233
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:18,650
generosity and your giving powers which are
so great, your forgiving powers, which are

234
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:27,360
so satisfying. All the great powers will start
feeling once you become that Spirit. And that

235
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,600
is very important, to become the Spirit.

236
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:41,860
Now of course, you can say, there are many
who talk like this. They have to! They have

237
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:52,730
to talk like this, but there are ways of understanding
how to make out a person who is real and who

238
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,490
is unreal.

239
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:59,670
First of all, it is a living happening. It’s
the happening in your evolutionary process.

240
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:10,450
As you have become human being you have to
become a higher being. You are still in transition.

241
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:19,210
You do not know why you are here. You don’t
know your meaning, that’s why you are frustrated,

242
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:25,070
that’s why you are unhappy. So this has
to happen to all of us.

243
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:33,160
Now for this, everybody can say, “Alright,
I’ll give you an experience.”

244
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:44,600
The other day one girl told me that a gentleman
came and told us, “I’ll give you an experience.”

245
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,720
And what experience did he give? She said,
“We became dumbfounded.” I said, “What

246
00:27:50,720 --> 00:28:00,200
is there [so special] to be dumbfounded?”
Supposing you go to a pub and have a big drink

247
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:08,570
you can be dumbfounded! What’s so valuable
[in that]? What is an experience? Supposing

248
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:17,010
you are pricked you might get the experience
of pain or something. Experience is not the

249
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:24,090
thing, it’s the awareness. What happens
to your awareness is the point. Is your awareness

250
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:29,690
is enlightened? Has your awareness got the
new dimension by which you understand other

251
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:35,580
people, the collectively consciousness? Did
you become collective? Are you collectively

252
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,100
conscious? Ask this simple question to yourself.

253
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,290
But it’s very easy to scan out these people
because everything they do is for money or

254
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:47,570
for women, or something very, very low level
thing. I mean, everybody who is trying to

255
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,940
do something is nothing but money or buildings
or all these things which are not important.

256
00:28:51,940 --> 00:29:02,880
In the realm of God, what is important is
the joy, is the peace, is the love. And when

257
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:12,190
we can achieve that Spirit then only we can
talk about it. Before that, if I tell you

258
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:19,120
a big story, what’s the use? It has to happen,
it has to work out. It’s your own right

259
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,050
to get it. You cannot sell it in the market
because it’s a living process. For example,

260
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:30,140
supposing there’s a seed which has to grow,
sprout, and it’s a living process, can we

261
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:37,170
pay money to the seed? “Now you please grow?”
Or a flower which has to become the fruit,

262
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:43,990
can you pay money to the flower? “Alright,
come along now, become a fruit!” Will it

263
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,150
become? It’s as simple as that.

264
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:52,630
All these living things are done by this All-pervading
Power. We have become human beings also through

265
00:29:52,630 --> 00:30:00,220
the grace of this All-pervading Power. Even
you have to become higher beings it will be

266
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,330
through that.

267
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,860
‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’. Also
it means it’s ‘simple’, ‘spontaneous’.

268
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:14,400
Everything living is spontaneous and that’s
why you cannot pay for it, you cannot sell

269
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,860
it in the market. It has nothing to do with
money.

270
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:29,290
God doesn’t understand money. He never saw
money. He doesn’t know what it is you human

271
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,530
beings have created, this money, this poverty,
this richness. He has nothing to do with it.

272
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:43,570
He has created a beautiful world, a beautiful
place for all of you live and He has created

273
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:59,070
you to enjoy it. But if you have made complications
and hangs-up and you are so complicated it’s

274
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:09,380
better to get out of it and become a simple
personality. To become a simple personality

275
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,970
also you have to get to that level which is
the Spirit.

276
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:18,480
And that is what Sahaja yoga is today.

277
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,600
As Gavin has told you that you have to put
hands towards me.

278
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:32,070
Now I must say, I must confess that that’s
my job. I have to accept it. But it should

279
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:38,360
not in any way hurt your ego. Because the
other day somebody told me, “Why you Mother?”

280
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:44,670
I said, “Please come along! I’ll be very
happy.

281
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:52,690
If you can do it nothing like it! I’ll be
very happy. Now see, I have a good family,

282
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,340
a very good husband, my family, my children,
my grandchildren and they are happy people.

283
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,020
Actually yesterday he was not well also so
much and he didn’t want me to come here

284
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,900
but I said, “No I must go to this place.
It’s definite I must go.” And I managed

285
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,470
to come here. And he also realises how important
it is to transform people. But it’s my job

286
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,220
what can I do? You see, if it is my job are
you going to crucify me for that? I have been

287
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:18,840
really asked to do this job and I am doing
it in my own humble way just to give you something.

288
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:31,070
I have to just give you. I have nothing to
take from you. I am standing at an end where

289
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:42,360
I cannot take anything. I can just give you
my love and you should just accept it. Is

290
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,720
there any harm in accepting somebody’s love?
Which you cannot pay for.

291
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,940
But once you get realisation, once you are
enlightened, you can enlighten other people.

292
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:03,230
Like one light which is enlightened can enlighten
another person and when that person is enlightened,

293
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,320
can enlighten another person.

294
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,220
It’s simple as that. I was born as an enlightened
personality. And I was aware of it. And then

295
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,270
my father told me, very frankly that, “Now
you find out a method by which you can give

296
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,400
a en-masse realisation. Because otherwise
if you speak it will become another Bible,

297
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:22,250
and people will fight; it will be another
Judaism, and they will fight, another Islam,

298
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,720
and they will fight. It’s better that you
give them realisation. Because [if] somebody

299
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:33,220
is born on the tenth storey and he talks of
the tenth storey and people on the ground

300
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,030
do not rise. First they are jealous or they
are angry or they think the man is mad and

301
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,740
they will do all kinds of things like crucifixion,
giving poison, torturing the saints and all

302
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,150
that.” He said, “Nothing doing! First
of all you make them rise at least two storeys

303
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,970
or three storeys. Let them feel that there
is something beyond. Once they start feeling

304
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,880
there’s something beyond that they have
to achieve it in their awareness then only

305
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,580
they will understand that there is God and
there is Divinity.”

306
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:50,190
Blind faith is no use. In the same way, denying
God is also no use. You must see and witness

307
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,660
this happening and then, once you become the
Self, you will understand God. Before becoming

308
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,140
the Self you cannot understand God, that’s
why even Buddha didn’t talk about God. He

309
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,720
said, “You better not talk of God. Once
you talk of God, again hypocrisy starts.”

310
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,390
So he said, “Let’s talk of the Self-realisation
only. Once they get their Self-realisation,

311
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,920
then I’ll talk about God.” But you know,
he didn’t live that long to tell people.

312
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,840
Actually, in his life time, he couldn’t
give realisation to many people.

313
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,300
Luckily I am in England. It’s all arranged,
I think. I have to be here because this is

314
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:10,470
going to be the Jerusalem. And I have been
struggling with English people quite a lot!

315
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,340
And I had six people with me for four years
– you won’t believe – and I was struggling

316
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,010
with them, with the six people. But they were
managed and they are now the foundation of

317
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,150
Sahaja Yoga in England.

318
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,650
English people are wise people. They are scholarly
people. They don’t rush to conclusions.

319
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:17,290
They are sensible people. But a kind of an
inertia is settled because of the experiences

320
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,710
of the past. Experiences of the religious
people, experiences of the fake gurus, experiences

321
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,500
of the other experiments that people have
done and they are really now fed up and fagged

322
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:20,720
out that, “We are not going to go in for
anything more!”

323
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,250
But supposing you are seeking a diamond and
ultimately find it.

324
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:21,750
Won’t you ask for it? Because you have been
seeking that only. So why not get to it and

325
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:21,780
do it?

326
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:21,950
No use identifying yourself with something:
with some organisation, with some cult, with

327
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,070
some sort of a misguided religion, or religious
behaviours.

328
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,320
Best is to be your Self. And then, you will
be surprised, your hands will speak. You yourself

329
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,010
will know who is the real who is the unreal.

330
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,650
Now there is one drawback that people feel
that, if you start jumping, you have become,

331
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,140
you are, blessed by Holy Ghost! If you start
talking something non-sensical, you have been

332
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,540
blessed by Holy Ghost.

333
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,220
How can that be? We can always jump. It’s
not difficult. Is it difficult to jump? Anybody

334
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,510
can start jumping. Anybody can start saying
something like that. Now, this misunderstanding

335
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:34,800
has come, because

336
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,470
‘Saint’ Paul I think said something, which
he should not have said because he was not

337
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:35,470
realised soul. And he had no business to say
that the Holy Ghost made them jump. Actually

338
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,110
this is done by the [dead] spirits. People
can mesmerise you and can make you jump. They

339
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,880
can mesmerise you. You have seen so many cases
where mass hypnosis has taken place. People

340
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,040
are just hypnotised to become the slaves of
these people, to give them money,

341
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,980
to give them Rolls Royces, to give them all
kinds of useless things.

342
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,520
So we must understand that this happening
is a living happening. You cannot pull out

343
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:45,820
your Kundalini like that. You cannot pull
out the primule, the germinating seedling

344
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,190
from the seed. You cannot pull it out [and
say], “Now come along now! You grow.”

345
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,830
It has to grow by itself. In the same way,
the happening of the Kundalini, in so many

346
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:54,940
people you can see. If you come to my programme
later on, you will be able to see. That you

347
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:02,180
can see the pulsation of the Kundalini in
the Sacrum, you can see the pulsation rising.

348
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,030
You can feel it on the fontanel bone area.
And once this opens out, you can feel the

349
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,870
cool breeze coming out of your head. You can
feel it, the cool breeze, coming out. And

350
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,440
also then you start feeling the cool breeze
in your hand.

351
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,320
Now this you cannot do! No one can do it.
Something has happened to you. And then once

352
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,070
you get it, if you start practicing it, you
will be amazed what powers you have got. Because,

353
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,910
supposing, even if I have powers, or if I
have money and I don’t know how to spend

354
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,010
it, I don’t know what the money is, what
this paper means – what’s the use? In

355
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,400
the same way, when you get this, you have
to give it to others. You have to look after

356
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,680
others. You have to impart this beauty to
others. In doing that you do not get into

357
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:25,820
any trouble, you do not suffer from anything.
On the contrary you feel so elated. And the

358
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:25,830
fulfilment of your being comes into you that
there’s some meaning to our lives. Something

359
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:25,830
that we are doing which is so substantial,
so living. We are doing the work of God.

360
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:25,840
May God bless you all.

361
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:25,840
It’s such a big subject that, in this short
time, I cannot explain every aspect of it.

362
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:25,850
It’s a very, very wide thing. But now I
can only say that there are about six [to]

363
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:25,860
severn hundred lectures I have given only
in England and I don’t know how many in

364
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:25,870
India. Still they say, “Mother, always you
say something new. I just don’t understand.”

365
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:25,880
But whatever it is, knowledge by words is
of no use. Knowledge should be your own which

366
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:25,890
should come to you as light. For example,
in a library, if you get a way of knowing

367
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:25,890
every book, just by the subtle entering into
it, or penetration into it, you [will] become

368
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:25,900
the knowledge. So best thing is to become
the knowledge instead of just knowing through

369
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:25,910
me and understanding it through me, which
you can do it. You are quite capable of doing

370
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,910
it and it can happen to all of you.

371
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
I wish this evening especially it should happen.

372
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:25,930
They say it is a small village. And to me,
small or big doesn’t matter. It’s how

373
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:25,930
many are there [who are] genuine seekers,
who are genuinely seeking God, who are seeking

374
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,980
their Spirit? That’s the most important
thing for me. Even there is one person like

375
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,430
that I’ll go to that place. Whether it’s
one house, or one village, or a big city,

376
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,550
makes no difference to me.
