1
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,416
Shakti Puja, Togliatti (Russia), 3 August 1993.

2
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:33,166
Today it is such a great day for our Being,

3
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:39,581
to be with you all again this year.

4
00:01:49,126 --> 00:02:01,137
It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance.

5
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:18,289
Today we have decided to have a Puja of Shakti that is the power,

6
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,637
that is the Devi.

7
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:45,002
You know within us there are many powers

8
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:53,125
of Maha Kali, Maha Saraswati, Maha Lakshmi, Kundalini.

9
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:11,659
All these powers are there for us to ascent.

10
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:49,948
If these powers are properly used and understood,

11
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:57,008
then your ascent can be permanent.

12
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:09,124
Once you achieve your ascent

13
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,897
and enter into the kingdom of God,

14
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:17,730
all these powers get enlightened.

15
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:33,168
And these powers which are enlightened

16
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:41,532
are absolutely filled with Love.

17
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:56,158
Enlightenment, we have to understand that

18
00:04:56,358 --> 00:05:01,522
we get completely enlightened by Love.

19
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,821
So after enlightenment, after realisation,

20
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:19,115
we use only one power which is of Love.

21
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:34,308
Shri Rama had two sons: one was Lav and one was Kush.

22
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:44,178
One of them, Lav, came to Russia.

23
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:51,701
That’s why you are called as Slavs, means ‘with love’.

24
00:05:56,077 --> 00:06:07,677
So Russian people are already quite full of their heart with love.

25
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:18,694
But once you get your enlightenment

26
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:23,866
you realise that your love becomes

27
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:30,995
a beautiful ocean of joy for yourself.

28
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:48,836
This love is not the same which you had before enlightenment.

29
00:06:52,682 --> 00:07:03,822
It’s transformed into a new dimension, into a new form.

30
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:11,076
Before enlightenment you are attached to yourself,

31
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:15,201
first of all, very much: to your body, to your mind,

32
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:21,513
to your conditionings, to your intellect, to your ego.

33
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:34,193
And that is how you develop

34
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:42,414
darkness of many horrible things within yourself.

35
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,949
If you are too much attached to your body,

36
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:53,196
then you may eat too much or you may not eat at all

37
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:56,335
or you may exercise too much

38
00:07:56,536 --> 00:08:04,349
or you may work it out for a particular form of your figure.

39
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:20,068
And you will use your body for absolutely wrong things

40
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:24,471
or sinful things also.

41
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:32,468
But then you become enlightened

42
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:38,737
and you understand that your body is the temple of God.

43
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:51,878
Then you keep your body clean and also you try to avoid

44
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:57,328
all that is destructive for your body.

45
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:10,450
The another attachment we have is very limited,

46
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,951
say for your own family, for your children, for your wife,

47
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:19,797
for your husband, something like that.

48
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:32,937
Despite that a human being can be extremely selfish

49
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,730
and could only bother about himself

50
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,195
and first of all him and then the rest.

51
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,999
Also he may spoil his children or spoil her husband

52
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:04,350
or his wife in any way just to pamper their ego.

53
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:21,327
Some people might indulge into alcoholism

54
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:25,776
or drugs or all kinds of things.

55
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:38,877
Also to help their families they may draw other people,

56
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:52,148
because they are very self-centered and their vision is very narrow.

57
00:10:56,224 --> 00:11:00,866
Sometimes they discover that for those people for whom

58
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:08,254
they are doing wrong things, are not actually bother about them.

59
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:21,654
Then there’s enlightenment and they see for themselves

60
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:24,888
that whatever I’m doing is neither good for me

61
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:29,636
nor for my family, nor my relations.

62
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:44,610
After enlightenment you think collectively.

63
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:51,245
Also when you think about your wife and your children,

64
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:57,125
your family, you think what is the right thing for them to do.

65
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:10,327
Immediately you become attentive to their problems

66
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:14,613
and to their destructiveness.

67
00:12:23,262 --> 00:12:29,238
Then this power of love changes the whole atmosphere.

68
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:37,089
In the family people see how sacrificing you are

69
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,413
and how noble you are.

70
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:55,520
This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis.

71
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,142
In that noble understanding of life

72
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:14,105
they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family

73
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:19,656
and try to bring them to the right path.

74
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:36,794
At the same time when they are helping their families

75
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:42,795
and try to improve their understanding,

76
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:49,140
they can be also very particular as to see that

77
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:59,091
they do not allow over indulgence into their family.

78
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:12,827
Because of the enlightenment, there’s detachment.

79
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:22,200
And the power of detached love is the greatest.

80
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:29,638
It’s like the sap in the trees which rises from the Mother Earth,

81
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:34,865
goes up into the smallest of leaves

82
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:41,708
and then it is either evaporated or goes back to the Mother Earth.

83
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:55,620
It doesn’t stay in one flower

84
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:03,206
because it likes it or in one leaf because it likes it.

85
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:14,022
It nourishes every part of the tree, whatever is need,

86
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:18,543
and is not attached.

87
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:30,432
But supposing it gets entangled or involved in one flower

88
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:34,120
or in one leaf, the tree will die

89
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,148
and that leaf and that flower will also die.

90
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:54,937
So detached love only gives, doesn’t expect anything back.

91
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:04,820
If it expects anything is complete prosperity

92
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:12,309
and the goodness of the tree.

93
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:21,921
In the same way a saintly person, who is a Sahaja Yogi,

94
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:25,820
behaves towards his family, towards his friends,

95
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,050
towards everything.

96
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:42,568
We have used only the power of hatred so far.

97
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:49,094
In the politics, especially, one country believes that

98
00:16:49,294 --> 00:16:54,349
they must hate another country, they are born for that.

99
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:02,269
Because hundred years back

100
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,108
some quarrel took place or a war took place,

101
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:11,029
so the children are still fighting among themselves.

102
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:21,072
You’ll be amazed that when I first came to Russia,

103
00:17:21,272 --> 00:17:28,287
25 German Sahaja Yogis rushed to help Me here.

104
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:40,341
Instead of bearing that malice in their hearts,

105
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:44,091
as their forefathers had killed so many of Russians,

106
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:50,049
they felt it was their greatest wishes to go

107
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:55,221
and do some service for the Russians.

108
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:13,863
So all the hatred changes into this powerful Love.

109
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:25,479
This power of Love is the greatest power and after Sahaja Yoga,

110
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,858
we have to use only our power of Love.

111
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:44,357
It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have.

112
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:52,552
Because this is Divine Love.

113
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:57,284
We are getting the source of Divine Love

114
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:02,937
from the all pervading power of God’s Love.

115
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:12,350
They say that God is Almighty.

116
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:19,422
Then who can be more powerful than God?

117
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,313
And if we are connected with God Almighty,

118
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:29,740
who could be mightier than us?

119
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:40,947
In His Love He protects us, He gives us whatever we want,

120
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:47,188
He blesses us and He makes us enjoy ourselves.

121
00:19:54,922 --> 00:20:02,187
His government is the most efficient
one and is very quick and very fast.

122
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:10,375
Today only when I was coming, one
of the Sahaja Yogis came and said,

123
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:15,286
“Mother it is very cloudy, it may rain.”

124
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:24,248
And when I came out after five minutes

125
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:28,561
I found the whole sky is cleared out.

126
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:40,812
So all these five elements also are at
the disposal of the children of God.

127
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:48,973
Even the cruellest of the cruel person melts down

128
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:58,335
and comes to the humble understanding of this power.

129
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:08,251
No one can harm you.

130
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:14,540
And anybody who tries to harm you becomes melted away.

131
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:22,674
It is so many miracles that in this short speech

132
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,168
I won’t be able to tell you all of them.

133
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:30,535
But you’ll find it in your life itself, how this power of Love,

134
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:36,279
that you have within your heart, has protected you.

135
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:48,084
I have seen people who are very hot tempered,

136
00:21:48,284 --> 00:21:53,354
who are angry type, who are all the
time making other’s life miserable,

137
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:58,772
become extremely beautiful, nice people.

138
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,840
With this Light of Love, you love yourself in the right way

139
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,201
and give up all that is wrong, all that is immoral.

140
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,458
This Love is eternal, is very powerful

141
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:42,282
and gives you a confidence in the collectivity of human beings.

142
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:55,249
Because it’s the Spirit which enlightens all your power.

143
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:06,331
And the Spirit is the source of collectivity and love

144
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:10,625
for every human being in the world.

145
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:19,538
Then your attention goes to all the people who are in trouble,

146
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:25,389
who are suffering, who need help.

147
00:23:31,141 --> 00:23:34,269
And with this attention, which is so enlightened,

148
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:39,736
you can solve their problems sitting down here.

149
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:51,298
With such people there’s no need to have any wars,

150
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:58,132
no need to have any weapons, no need to have any boundaries.

151
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:10,155
If Russians go to India, they feel India as their country,

152
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:16,284
if Indians come to Russia they think Russia their own country.

153
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,587
So who will fight?

154
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:32,189
There’s no one to whom you can really say: “He is my enemy” ,

155
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:37,988
because everybody is part and parcel of your being.

156
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:53,037
These are the special times, I call them the Blossom time

157
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:59,675
when too many flowers are there who are seeking the Truth.

158
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,390
And their fragrance is their Love.

159
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,972
And they have all to become fruits now.

160
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:28,060
And this is what is going to happen

161
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:33,116
as these times are very, very important.

162
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:42,194
In all the religions they are described.

163
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:48,457
We don’t hate anyone because we believe in one religion

164
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:55,504
or another religion. On the contrary,
we believe in all the religions.

165
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,159
This is the power by which a drop becomes the ocean

166
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,633
and individual becomes the collective.

167
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:23,027
So all your powers that are there are enlightened

168
00:26:23,227 --> 00:26:27,360
by the all pervading power.

169
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:40,717
It transforms you and it has such a beautiful, delicate way

170
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:45,175
of handling everything.

171
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:58,962
The only thing that is needed is faith in this power,

172
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:06,685
that only by having Love for others,

173
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:10,841
and this enlightened Love

174
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:16,782
is going to give you whatever you want.

175
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:29,511
And there is such a power, All-pervading power.

176
00:27:35,884 --> 00:27:40,099
There is no doubt about it.

177
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:44,554
And we have to just accept it with our open heart

178
00:27:44,754 --> 00:27:50,418
that it fills it and makes us a great personality.

179
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,535
So there’s no competition, there’s no ambition,

180
00:28:00,735 --> 00:28:06,675
there’s no jealousy, nothing of the kind.

181
00:28:12,616 --> 00:28:17,744
The only desire then left is that "I am enjoying myself,

182
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:21,975
let others also enjoy."

183
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:34,108
People go out of the way to spread Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:43,668
They work very hard, travel with very little money,

185
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:47,043
they try to convince people,

186
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:53,035
do all kinds of things for no material gain.

187
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,972
But the greatest joy is when you see that

188
00:29:04,172 --> 00:29:07,347
you have raised the Kundalini of another person

189
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:12,227
and given him self-realisation.

190
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:24,288
That lits up your faces I have seen many times.

191
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:35,330
Let this Love grow more and more.

192
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:43,992
They asked me, why of all places I came to Togliatti.

193
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:55,944
Not for Volga, not for these beautiful houses you have

194
00:29:56,144 --> 00:30:00,725
but for My children who are here.

195
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,886
May God bless you.
