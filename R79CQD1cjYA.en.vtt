00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:54.675
Today, in these modern times

00:53:56.765 --> 00:53:58.681
we are face to face

00:53:59.587 --> 00:54:01.869
with lots of complicated problems

00:54:05.099 --> 00:54:07.697
lots of shocks that are awaiting us.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.840
And then we

00:54:13.254 --> 00:54:14.354
look back

00:54:15.312 --> 00:54:16.312
to understand

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.654
why have we failed.

00:54:20.707 --> 00:54:23.441
What has gone wrong with all of us?

00:54:24.181 --> 00:54:27.042
Whatever way the human beings have moved

00:54:28.077 --> 00:54:29.177
in whatever direction

00:54:30.131 --> 00:54:32.253
they have tried to

00:54:32.786 --> 00:54:33.886
achieve something

00:54:34.462 --> 00:54:37.191
the whole thing has recoiled on the whole humanity

00:54:37.392 --> 00:54:39.893
and has destroyed it.

00:54:41.424 --> 00:54:43.245
One must stop at this point

00:54:44.759 --> 00:54:47.035
and witness the reason

00:54:47.489 --> 00:54:50.556
the basic reason, what mistake we have committed.

00:54:52.132 --> 00:54:54.929
We talk of love, we talk of peace

00:54:56.008 --> 00:54:56.908
world peace.

00:54:57.967 --> 00:54:59.891
But the peace is not in your hearts.

00:55:00.918 --> 00:55:02.222
Peace is not within.

00:55:02.905 --> 00:55:04.258
You are in a turmoil

00:55:04.723 --> 00:55:07.172
and how can you bring forth peace all over?

00:55:09.721 --> 00:55:10.721
If the

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.573
sea is full of waves

00:55:14.618 --> 00:55:15.995
which are in a turmoil

00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:20.878
how do you expect the boat to be steady?

00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:23.020
The reason is

00:55:23.874 --> 00:55:25.322
we are not

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:28.432
trying to find out what is wrong with us.

00:55:29.344 --> 00:55:30.992
But we are all the time trying to find out

00:55:31.193 --> 00:55:33.103
what is wrong with others.

00:55:33.572 --> 00:55:34.472
But who is the other?

00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:38.197
We are all part and parcel of one

00:55:39.158 --> 00:55:40.158
Great World.

00:55:40.447 --> 00:55:42.200
God has not created many countries.

00:55:42.538 --> 00:55:44.055
He never knew about these things.

00:55:45.388 --> 00:55:47.846
He will be surprised if He visits His world.

00:55:48.117 --> 00:55:49.715
He will be surprised the way we have

00:55:49.916 --> 00:55:51.097
divided ourselves into countries

00:55:51.138 --> 00:55:52.475
countries, countries

00:55:52.676 --> 00:55:54.840
and from one country to another country

00:55:55.041 --> 00:55:57.970
you move like a criminal with a passport number.

00:56:01.569 --> 00:56:05.879
This idea of love is not love.

00:56:06.658 --> 00:56:09.757
This conception, the mental projection

00:56:10.456 --> 00:56:13.908
that we call love is not love at all.

00:56:17.103 --> 00:56:21.218
The love is something which is a power.

00:56:23.315 --> 00:56:27.501
A power that is looking after us

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.790
the power that is guiding us

00:56:31.971 --> 00:56:36.014
the power that has nourished us, has brought us to this level.

00:56:36.329 --> 00:56:40.443
We in our ego human beings think that we have done this

00:56:40.585 --> 00:56:41.498
we have done that.

00:56:41.969 --> 00:56:43.507
You have done nothing.

00:56:44.144 --> 00:56:49.274
You can't even create a blade of grass.

00:56:50.662 --> 00:56:53.887
You cannot ! Can you?

00:56:54.866 --> 00:56:58.202
You cannot create anything that is living.

00:57:00.754 --> 00:57:05.488
Then why say that, "we have done this, we have done that"?

00:57:05.805 --> 00:57:07.265
you have done nothing

00:57:07.529 --> 00:57:11.628
but you have created all kinds of devils out of your cocoons

00:57:12.261 --> 00:57:14.115
and put them on top of your heads.

00:57:14.671 --> 00:57:16.703
First let us be humble about it

00:57:16.904 --> 00:57:19.605
then we can understand what is love of God.

00:57:22.265 --> 00:57:26.714
Love of God is a power, it is all pervading power.

00:57:28.423 --> 00:57:30.357
It is the subtle power

00:57:31.269 --> 00:57:35.146
which resides in all the elements

00:57:37.067 --> 00:57:41.463
in all the molecules, in all the atoms.

00:57:43.906 --> 00:57:48.155
The vibrations that you see say in a sulphur dioxide

00:57:49.135 --> 00:57:50.205
when you see the

00:57:50.692 --> 00:57:57.412
isometric movement of the atoms

00:57:57.451 --> 00:58:01.116
then know it is the love of God which is watching it.

00:58:04.701 --> 00:58:07.631
Now it is easy to say that it is no love of God.

00:58:08.555 --> 00:58:11.948
But this is not very scientific way of looking at things.

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:15.356
If you are scientific minded

00:58:16.928 --> 00:58:19.900
then, you have to understand this is the hypothesis

00:58:20.101 --> 00:58:21.766
which I am putting before you.

00:58:22.082 --> 00:58:24.609
And if it is not proved then you can deny.

00:58:24.938 --> 00:58:27.850
Uptil now I would have accepted that you said there is no God

00:58:28.051 --> 00:58:29.492
but that also is not scientific

00:58:29.783 --> 00:58:30.883
because you have not seen yet.

00:58:31.336 --> 00:58:33.045
You have not gone into that direction.

00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:34.511
You have not tried to find it out.

00:58:34.712 --> 00:58:36.596
How can you say there is no God?

00:58:36.687 --> 00:58:39.564
Only because in your small little brain

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:43.167
you have conceived an idea that there is no God.

00:58:45.061 --> 00:58:48.546
So, secondly you have to have an open mind

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:52.450
to understand God's love.

00:58:53.233 --> 00:58:54.815
A very open mind

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:58.561
open mind like a student who goes to the university

00:58:58.714 --> 00:59:03.059
doesn't challenge a professor, but sits down to listen

00:59:03.934 --> 00:59:06.627
to find out what the professor has to teach.

00:59:09.505 --> 00:59:10.605
Thirdly,

00:59:12.812 --> 00:59:16.664
we must understand that we know very little

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:19.984
very very little, wee bit.

00:59:20.849 --> 00:59:24.520
We are using a very weebit of our brain to understand it.

00:59:25.423 --> 00:59:27.801
so, whatever so called knowledge we have got

00:59:28.063 --> 00:59:30.779
is absolutely a limited knowledge.

00:59:30.927 --> 00:59:34.672
May be it is just ignorance or may be something mythical.

00:59:35.516 --> 00:59:37.218
Let us keep it as a hypothesis.

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:40.857
Now, I say

00:59:43.310 --> 00:59:44.443
that there is God

00:59:45.873 --> 00:59:50.282
and I say that His love is all pervading.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.766
All the great saints, incarnations, prophets

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:58.418
all the great religions have said this.

00:59:58.619 --> 01:00:00.405
I am not saying this for the first time.

01:00:00.761 --> 01:00:05.836
I am only here to prove that they have said it, is the truth

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:09.181
and you can find out whether it is the truth or not.

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:12.050
But you should be the seekers of truth

01:00:12.251 --> 01:00:15.205
and not just intellectuals or some sort of

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:17.900
argumentative personalities.

01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:22.085
Try to understand that at human level you have not been able to

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:26.626
discover that great power of love, is a fact, must accept.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.012
You have not been able to feel God's love.

01:00:32.774 --> 01:00:37.159
Or you might have read a lot, but you have had no experience of God.

01:00:38.033 --> 01:00:40.124
You have never felt His love

01:00:40.919 --> 01:00:46.236
Then, one must know that we have been ignorant.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.542
The darkness of ignorance has been on us

01:00:51.792 --> 01:00:54.462
and in darkness we are eating each other

01:00:54.937 --> 01:00:58.211
You have no idea as to how we are related to each other.

01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:02.726
It is a crazy world we are creating today because of this darkness.

01:01:03.405 --> 01:01:05.090
This darkness has to go away.

01:01:05.522 --> 01:01:10.045
And for that the light of God's love has to come.

01:01:12.697 --> 01:01:16.597
Now the question could be, how can we know God?

01:01:18.599 --> 01:01:21.305
Because as it is, we are like a cocoon.

01:01:22.995 --> 01:01:26.367
We have taken out all these traits of the cocoon

01:01:27.486 --> 01:01:28.586
put them round us

01:01:29.302 --> 01:01:32.861
and everybody thinks that they have produced some sort of a

01:01:33.101 --> 01:01:35.779
novel ideology or a philosophy

01:01:36.586 --> 01:01:38.252
which will solve all the problems of the world.

01:01:38.703 --> 01:01:40.901
It has not, it has created more complications,

01:01:41.102 --> 01:01:43.066
more complications and more complications.

01:01:43.351 --> 01:01:44.451
Let us face it.

01:01:47.012 --> 01:01:50.396
How to get out of this cocoon is the problem today?

01:01:51.153 --> 01:01:53.006
And to get out of this cocoon

01:01:54.004 --> 01:01:55.444
what should we do?

01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:58.499
Normally as human beings we always think

01:01:58.524 --> 01:02:02.446
that by doing something only we achieve the results.

01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:04.077
But this is the other way round.

01:02:07.046 --> 01:02:11.284
When we became human beings from ameba stage what did we do?

01:02:13.565 --> 01:02:16.676
From monkeys to human beings what did we do?

01:02:17.335 --> 01:02:19.631
We didn't do anything. Did we?

01:02:19.832 --> 01:02:22.365
But there was some internal force

01:02:22.566 --> 01:02:24.930
that has brought forth this  revolution.

01:02:28.155 --> 01:02:30.674
Now when something has happened

01:02:31.843 --> 01:02:33.434
without our effort

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:37.129
then it must be something unique.

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:41.047
But it is nothing. Everyday we see it.

01:02:41.332 --> 01:02:44.748
For example, a flower becomes a fruit. You see it every day.

01:02:46.067 --> 01:02:47.167
And you accept it.

01:02:49.046 --> 01:02:51.964
You never challenge, how it has become suddenly

01:02:52.353 --> 01:02:54.161
the flower becoming a fruit

01:02:54.684 --> 01:02:56.275
because it is a living process.

01:02:58.687 --> 01:03:01.400
So the living process

01:03:04.022 --> 01:03:05.748
of the living God

01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:10.608
comes from His love, which is living.

01:03:12.908 --> 01:03:14.570
Dead Gods I am not talking about

01:03:14.771 --> 01:03:16.809
which we have made out of our own brains.

01:03:17.672 --> 01:03:21.517
But real God, the reality itself

01:03:23.555 --> 01:03:28.193
which is not created by you, He has created us.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.140
When He has created us

01:03:31.451 --> 01:03:33.563
We cannot put in effort to know Him.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.086
He has to put in effort for us to know Him.

01:03:38.635 --> 01:03:41.456
So, He has put in all the efforts within yourself

01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:43.513
very beautifully.

01:03:45.826 --> 01:03:48.393
In the different stages of your evolution,

01:03:50.274 --> 01:03:51.174
He has

01:03:53.929 --> 01:03:57.115
developed within you a mechanism

01:03:57.365 --> 01:04:00.265
a beautiful living mechanism

01:04:02.283 --> 01:04:04.675
which has given you the state

01:04:05.144 --> 01:04:07.488
upto which you have come up as a human beings

01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:12.263
and also the possibility of becoming a higher being

01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:13.711
through that mechanism.

01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:19.513
Now if you want to know through science , you cannot.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:22.962
By all human efforts

01:04:24.851 --> 01:04:27.815
whatever you try is the knowledge of the tree.

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:32.125
But if you have to have the knowledge of the roots

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:37.040
you have to become a subtler personality to get to it.

01:04:40.779 --> 01:04:42.799
Even to become that

01:04:45.551 --> 01:04:48.610
God has made all beautiful arrangements within us.

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:53.981
In the west I would say

01:04:54.168 --> 01:04:56.584
on the scientific field you reached

01:04:57.545 --> 01:05:01.183
quite daring but he made little mistakes

01:05:01.794 --> 01:05:05.154
because He didn't have a Mother to tell him perhaps.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:09.749
So, he made a very big mistake

01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:12.671
by saying that the unconscious

01:05:14.056 --> 01:05:18.022
is below the subconscious mind.

01:05:19.995 --> 01:05:21.864
And then is the conscious mind

01:05:26.385 --> 01:05:28.833
which we call (SUPHTA CHETAN).

01:05:30.574 --> 01:05:32.514
Which is Sakhshat Kundalini.

01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:36.649
This Kundalini

01:05:38.744 --> 01:05:46.155
according to him was placed  under the layers of these minds.

01:05:47.298 --> 01:05:51.868
God is a great creator and a planner.

01:05:53.447 --> 01:05:55.800
Supposing you have to

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.857
enter into an airport

01:05:59.992 --> 01:06:03.480
and there are piles of luggage, one after another and everything

01:06:03.681 --> 01:06:06.590
piled one after the other like that, how will you reach?

01:06:07.889 --> 01:06:09.710
There has to be a path.

01:06:11.858 --> 01:06:15.639
So, this argument of his has failed him completely.

01:06:16.183 --> 01:06:19.281
But actually it is not placed one on top of another

01:06:19.569 --> 01:06:20.669
but on parallel sides.

01:06:22.859 --> 01:06:25.362
On the left hand side and the right hand side.

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:29.912
On the left hand side, we have the subconscious.

01:06:30.995 --> 01:06:35.030
The present subconscious is like subconscious

01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:39.033
many lives' subconscious and then the collective subconscious.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:44.494
On the right hand side we have got supraconscious, the present one

01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:46.283
this life's

01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:48.991
then of many lives

01:06:49.248 --> 01:06:52.767
and then last of all is the collective supraconscious.

01:06:53.988 --> 01:06:56.357
Now the supraconscious means the futuristic

01:06:57.184 --> 01:06:59.528
the futuristic ideas of people.

01:07:00.927 --> 01:07:03.264
So, we have two types of people already

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:07.306
one are which are left sided which live with their past

01:07:08.842 --> 01:07:12.457
one which are right sided which live with the future.

01:07:12.633 --> 01:07:16.088
We can say in India we are the people live more with the past.

01:07:16.644 --> 01:07:18.679
We talk of Shivaji but what about today?

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:21.261
Can we produce someone like him?

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:27.941
We talk of Nanaka. Can we produce anyone like Him?

01:07:29.906 --> 01:07:33.259
We talk of Kabira. Can we produce anyone like Him?

01:07:33.826 --> 01:07:36.417
With all this nonsense that is going on

01:07:37.233 --> 01:07:40.617
can we produce even one like them? We cannot.

01:07:42.219 --> 01:07:43.543
So no use talking about them.

01:07:43.819 --> 01:07:46.748
Better see what you can do today in the present.

01:07:48.152 --> 01:07:50.282
So in the present is the central path

01:07:51.117 --> 01:07:54.605
which we call in the Sanskrit language as Maha Laxmi's.

01:07:56.591 --> 01:07:59.921
This central path is the evolutionary path of the human beings.

01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:04.319
And thus all the centers that are created within us

01:08:04.784 --> 01:08:08.343
are the different stages in which a human being has gone through.

01:08:08.916 --> 01:08:11.959
For example, the first one which is called as the Mooladhara

01:08:12.426 --> 01:08:13.526
which you see there

01:08:14.639 --> 01:08:18.060
is the one, that starts with carbon.

01:08:18.967 --> 01:08:22.478
With the carbon coming into the evolutionary process

01:08:23.048 --> 01:08:25.507
amino acids were formed.

01:08:25.708 --> 01:08:28.376
Iife took its own existence

01:08:28.577 --> 01:08:29.878
and life stared running.

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:32.996
So basically,

01:08:33.388 --> 01:08:36.972
we have started from that stage, going higher, higher, higher.

01:08:37.449 --> 01:08:39.563
Till now we have come to the human stage

01:08:40.442 --> 01:08:44.001
and last is this chakra which we call

01:08:44.114 --> 01:08:48.607
in the medical science as limbic area, Sahastrara.

01:08:49.528 --> 01:08:52.633
The end of it is called as the Bramharandra

01:08:52.702 --> 01:08:55.586
in the fontanelle bone area in the medical terminology

01:08:56.067 --> 01:08:59.551
and this is a soft bone in childhood

01:09:00.466 --> 01:09:02.795
which gets covered up because

01:09:03.615 --> 01:09:07.880
of the two institutions growing into us of ego and superego.

01:09:09.786 --> 01:09:12.512
When the kundalini rises through these centers

01:09:12.794 --> 01:09:15.176
She pierces through this seventh center

01:09:16.446 --> 01:09:18.989
and you get that higher awareness

01:09:19.178 --> 01:09:22.833
which we call as Yogis or Sahajyogis.

01:09:24.818 --> 01:09:27.258
These days there are so many types of yogis moving.

01:09:27.623 --> 01:09:29.610
That is why we call it Sahajyogis,

01:09:29.811 --> 01:09:31.588
but all real yogis are Sahajyogis.

01:09:33.233 --> 01:09:38.994
It is a spontaneous happening because it is a living process.

01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:43.001
Living process is a spontaneous happening.

01:09:44.553 --> 01:09:47.247
Once people asked Ramadasa,

01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:50.514
"How much time does it takee for kundalini to rise?"

01:09:50.988 --> 01:09:53.119
He said TAT CHHAN, (that moment).

01:09:55.644 --> 01:09:57.912
Guru Nanaka has said," Sahaja Samadhi lago".

01:09:58.588 --> 01:09:59.617
" Sahaja Samadhi lago".

01:09:59.818 --> 01:10:03.025
He has described, Sahaja Samadhi lago, clearly.

01:10:04.695 --> 01:10:06.174
What more he should say?

01:10:08.207 --> 01:10:11.803
Kabira has said," Ida pingala sukhman nadi mein".

01:10:12.993 --> 01:10:15.413
They all have described the same thing.

01:10:15.692 --> 01:10:16.980
In the Bible it is written,

01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:21.634
"I will appear before you like tongues of flames".

01:10:21.867 --> 01:10:24.005
No one can explain what does that mean.

01:10:24.442 --> 01:10:28.909
Christ has said ,"I will come back as a comforter, as a Holy Ghost".

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:30.994
If you ask somebody, who is Holy Ghost?

01:10:32.336 --> 01:10:33.930
They say we don't know, that is a mystery.

01:10:34.107 --> 01:10:36.145
Everything is a mystery, then what is the use of having such a

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.240
mysterious ideas.

01:10:39.465 --> 01:10:41.302
Why do you accept anything that is mysterious?

01:10:42.481 --> 01:10:45.983
Holy Ghost is nothing but it is the kundalini within you.

01:10:47.582 --> 01:10:51.249
She is the reflection of the Primordial Mother

01:10:51.676 --> 01:10:53.973
who is within you in the triangular bone.

01:10:54.618 --> 01:10:56.534
She is kept there all the time.

01:10:57.067 --> 01:11:04.806
That is the power which is, what we call is the power of

01:11:06.898 --> 01:11:09.425
Shuddah Iccha.

01:11:09.626 --> 01:11:12.257
Pure desire, pure desire.

01:11:12.634 --> 01:11:14.566
What is the pure desire we have?

01:11:14.793 --> 01:11:18.185
Is that we have to become one with this all pervading power.

01:11:18.486 --> 01:11:19.386
This is the pure desire.

01:11:19.659 --> 01:11:22.109
All other desires come and go.

01:11:22.294 --> 01:11:26.110
Today they are asking say for something.

01:11:26.269 --> 01:11:27.852
Tomorrow they will ask for something.

01:11:28.214 --> 01:11:30.275
Day after tommorow they will ask for something.

01:11:30.476 --> 01:11:32.426
It will go on and go on and go on.

01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:35.978
But once you get to your pure desire

01:11:36.239 --> 01:11:38.085
you don't want to ask for anything.

01:11:38.367 --> 01:11:39.267
Then you give.

01:11:40.174 --> 01:11:42.979
Then you don't ask. You don't want anything, you want to give.

01:11:43.705 --> 01:11:46.520
This is the situation which we should arrive at

01:11:46.721 --> 01:11:48.816
that we have to give.

01:11:49.017 --> 01:11:51.021
When we say that we have to become the light

01:11:51.448 --> 01:11:52.300
then you become the light.

01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:53.534
What does the light do?

01:11:53.745 --> 01:11:54.645
Light gives.

01:11:55.431 --> 01:11:58.211
Till it becomes the light all the problems are there.

01:11:58.378 --> 01:12:00.691
As soon as it becomes light, it gives.

01:12:01.553 --> 01:12:05.454
In the same way, there is full arrangement within us.

01:12:06.094 --> 01:12:10.867
In a living process the kundalini has to rise

01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:16.300
and give you your self realisation, your self knowledge

01:12:16.407 --> 01:12:19.010
which is the BODHA, which is the VEDAS.

01:12:19.211 --> 01:12:20.611
VED means VIDH.

01:12:20.811 --> 01:12:24.311
To know within yourself means on your central nervous system

01:12:24.477 --> 01:12:27.911
not reading, not reading.

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:31.979
Kabira has said, (" PADHI PADHI PANDIT MOORAKH BHAYYA").

01:12:32.423 --> 01:12:36.550
He said by reading too much, the great learned have become stupid.

01:12:37.465 --> 01:12:38.465
That is a fact.

01:12:38.882 --> 01:12:42.715
Because when you read, everybody else is in your head, you are lost.

01:12:43.183 --> 01:12:45.822
Now when the self knowledge comes into you

01:12:47.619 --> 01:12:49.166
then what happens?

01:12:50.034 --> 01:12:53.029
When self knowledge is there, you know about yourself.

01:12:53.984 --> 01:12:55.084
You don't know anything about yourself.

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:59.543
For example, somebody who is sick

01:13:00.632 --> 01:13:02.997
he says,"Oh! I was quite alright

01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:06.080
and suddenly i find i have got bone marrow cancer".

01:13:06.526 --> 01:13:07.755
He never new,no nothing.

01:13:07.956 --> 01:13:10.055
Suddenly they say now i have bone marrow cancer.

01:13:10.349 --> 01:13:12.845
I am walking about alright. I am perfectly alright.

01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:15.150
He did not know.

01:13:15.711 --> 01:13:18.042
Somebody says,"My son was alright,

01:13:18.244 --> 01:13:20.258
suddenly he has turned out to be epiliptic".

01:13:20.767 --> 01:13:24.937
Another one says,"My daughter was alright. Now she is a lunatic."

01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:27.876
How it has happened, we don't know?

01:13:28.101 --> 01:13:30.325
Suddenly, something has gone down with the machine.

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:35.350
We know more about the motorcar that we drive the machinery

01:13:36.223 --> 01:13:38.045
much less about this our machinery

01:13:38.246 --> 01:13:39.924
which is so beautiful and so subtle.

01:13:42.566 --> 01:13:45.093
To know this you have to become the knower.

01:13:45.357 --> 01:13:48.848
And the knower is the spirit, where you have to reach.

01:13:48.898 --> 01:13:51.257
But for that you don't have to do anything.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.730
Kundilini has to do some job

01:13:53.977 --> 01:13:57.099
and that job is simple because She is your Mother.

01:13:57.890 --> 01:14:00.868
She has been your mother all your lives

01:14:01.512 --> 01:14:04.814
and now she wants to give you your second birth.

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:06.769
That you have to have.

01:14:07.023 --> 01:14:09.931
It is no use certfying yourself twice born

01:14:10.462 --> 01:14:14.759
or say that I am a person, who has got realisation.

01:14:15.774 --> 01:14:18.103
It is no use deceiving yourself, no use.

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:22.296
When you get your realisation , the first thing that happens to you

01:14:22.407 --> 01:14:25.459
the first and foremost thing that will happen to you

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:28.518
that on your central nervous system

01:14:28.834 --> 01:14:31.012
you will develop a new dimension

01:14:31.806 --> 01:14:34.873
of collective consciousness.

01:14:36.273 --> 01:14:39.284
A new depth on your central nervous system

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:43.052
you can feel your own centers and the centers of others

01:14:43.234 --> 01:14:47.254
on your five fingers and six and seven centers.

01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:49.580
This has to happen.

01:14:49.781 --> 01:14:51.466
The one who thinks I know a lot,

01:14:51.667 --> 01:14:54.239
i am a great pandit i am this and that,

01:14:54.476 --> 01:14:56.974
I think all of them are on their way to Narak (Hell).

01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:00.520
Only the way to rise

01:15:00.721 --> 01:15:04.859
is to ascend through kundailini awakening, there is no other way.

01:15:05.559 --> 01:15:09.114
Some people think that we have to be very

01:15:09.315 --> 01:15:13.164
upright, straight forward in life if you are honest

01:15:13.365 --> 01:15:16.415
if you are all other things then it is enough.

01:15:16.706 --> 01:15:22.067
But another may ask," Why, For What was the purpose of all this?"

01:15:23.047 --> 01:15:24.621
Why should we have this balanced life?

01:15:25.394 --> 01:15:28.107
Why should we go through this rigmarole of

01:15:28.308 --> 01:15:30.684
being very steady, this, that.

01:15:30.897 --> 01:15:33.182
Any body can ask, young people will ask this question.

01:15:33.444 --> 01:15:37.297
Why this nonsense of being all these things , for what?

01:15:38.079 --> 01:15:40.652
This balance is for the ascent.

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:43.224
Without the balance it cannot ascend.

01:15:43.425 --> 01:15:44.928
That is why the balance has to come.

01:15:45.447 --> 01:15:47.347
That is why you have to be in the middle.

01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:52.060
You have to be in moderation because you have to ascend.

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:55.943
And for the ascent, all the extreme temperament cannot beat.

01:15:56.566 --> 01:15:59.653
Supposing you have an aeroplane which has one wheel missing.

01:15:59.854 --> 01:16:00.778
will it fly?

01:16:01.463 --> 01:16:04.228
Which has got one wheel very heavy it won't fly.

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:06.622
So, one has to have a balance

01:16:07.123 --> 01:16:12.063
and this balance is achieved through your being in moderation

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:16.596
or being , I would not say (DHARMIC) because Dharmic means nonsense

01:16:16.918 --> 01:16:19.140
but Dharmic means the Dharma

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:23.219
the Dharma within you, the ten valencies that are within you.

01:16:23.807 --> 01:16:27.572
which are the valencies of human beings to be balanced.

01:16:27.942 --> 01:16:31.867
We can say the ten commandments or we can say the ten valencies

01:16:32.039 --> 01:16:33.511
or we can say the DASHA DHARMAS ( the ten dharmas).

01:16:34.607 --> 01:16:35.396
They are inner things

01:16:35.597 --> 01:16:38.462
they are not outside, they are inside yourself.

01:16:39.586 --> 01:16:42.653
When they are in balance, the ascent takes place.

01:16:44.416 --> 01:16:45.856
Now the difference between

01:16:47.099 --> 01:16:49.680
all those historical things that we have seen

01:16:50.418 --> 01:16:52.651
all those

01:16:52.889 --> 01:16:55.377
self realisation stories we have heard

01:16:55.793 --> 01:16:57.409
have been of one or two persons

01:16:57.730 --> 01:16:59.680
because of the tree of life at that time

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:00.928
they were one or two flowers.

01:17:01.802 --> 01:17:05.138
I find there are thousands today. The blossom time has come.

01:17:05.372 --> 01:17:07.288
So, many will get realisation no doubt.

01:17:08.183 --> 01:17:11.735
But the other difference between all those practices where

01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:13.624
people used to cleanse themselves

01:17:14.109 --> 01:17:15.810
chakras by chakras they used to raise it.

01:17:15.905 --> 01:17:16.971
They used to go to real gurus, satgurus.

01:17:17.172 --> 01:17:20.022
not these horrible gurus but satgurus.

01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:23.558
Satgurus they used to go.

01:17:24.302 --> 01:17:27.807
and these gurus would raise their kundalini one by one step by step

01:17:28.008 --> 01:17:29.496
and give them realisation, cleanse them.

01:17:29.697 --> 01:17:31.269
It was a very hazardous method.

01:17:32.567 --> 01:17:33.667
So as the Mother

01:17:34.319 --> 01:17:38.004
I thought why not make you your own guru.

01:17:39.099 --> 01:17:40.305
How do you do it?

01:17:40.662 --> 01:17:42.261
Somehow or other, I must develop a method

01:17:42.815 --> 01:17:46.723
by which I can manage amass realisation.

01:17:47.991 --> 01:17:50.772
Let many people get realisation.

01:17:51.943 --> 01:17:55.151
Now the kundalini doesn't rise in its own full force,

01:17:55.213 --> 01:17:57.016
because the chakras are not clean

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.680
there are problems on the chakras,

01:17:58.881 --> 01:18:00.296
there are blockages things like that.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.577
But there is a wee bit

01:18:03.054 --> 01:18:07.156
a small hair like power can rise in some people

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.327
Some people can have a bigger flow

01:18:09.558 --> 01:18:12.315
some people can have a completete jet coming out.

01:18:12.705 --> 01:18:17.351
But everybody should have this experience.

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:20.420
And as a result of that, the

01:18:22.504 --> 01:18:26.614
light in of the spirit flickers a little bit.

01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:30.064
In that light you can see your own problems.

01:18:30.567 --> 01:18:32.039
You can see what is wrong with you

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.268
because you can feel it on your finger tips.

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:39.064
and if you know how to correct them, you become your own guru

01:18:39.265 --> 01:18:40.738
you correct yourself, I don't want to tell you.

01:18:41.294 --> 01:18:43.044
Because if I tell you, you will all run away.

01:18:43.526 --> 01:18:45.735
These are not the days to tell anybody to do something.

01:18:45.934 --> 01:18:47.034
That is the worst thing.

01:18:48.021 --> 01:18:50.659
So only thing is you get your realisation

01:18:51.595 --> 01:18:53.042
get this little light with you

01:18:53.243 --> 01:18:55.751
and see for your self what is wrong with you and you manage it.

01:18:55.918 --> 01:18:57.358
This is the only difference is

01:18:57.793 --> 01:18:59.077
and I find this works better.

01:18:59.789 --> 01:19:02.189
Because human beings in the modern times

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:04.900
have accumulated so much of ego on their head, so much

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.120
beyound their heads.

01:19:07.824 --> 01:19:08.924
So no use touching it.

01:19:09.523 --> 01:19:12.392
Best is to raise the kundalini, so that they see their ego.

01:19:13.551 --> 01:19:16.285
And they say, "Mother, Please remove this

01:19:16.567 --> 01:19:20.208
thing that has gone on my head, please remove this."

01:19:21.106 --> 01:19:22.206
They themselves say.

01:19:22.997 --> 01:19:26.112
This is what is this modern Sahajyoga is.

01:19:26.835 --> 01:19:30.132
The Kundalini awakening is very simple.

01:19:30.487 --> 01:19:34.552
People might have told you that it gives you problems and all that.

01:19:35.031 --> 01:19:37.852
I just don't know because thousands of people

01:19:38.053 --> 01:19:42.638
in the villages, in the cities, all over the world I have done this.

01:19:42.781 --> 01:19:43.821
Nobody had any problems.

01:19:44.022 --> 01:19:46.517
On the contrary all their problems are solved.

01:19:46.797 --> 01:19:49.063
This is a wrong idea we have got in our head.

01:19:49.232 --> 01:19:52.545
I don't know from where it has come that you have to suffer

01:19:53.533 --> 01:19:55.321
to get to spirituality.

01:19:55.522 --> 01:19:59.737
I just don't understand like some people in England said to me

01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:01.369
that we have to suffer.

01:20:01.599 --> 01:20:02.699
I said ,"Why?"

01:20:02.952 --> 01:20:05.276
Christ has suffered for you. Hasn't He?

01:20:05.372 --> 01:20:07.288
Are you going to suffer more than Christ?

01:20:07.623 --> 01:20:09.620
Why did He suffer for you if there was something

01:20:09.821 --> 01:20:11.477
left for you to suffer?

01:20:12.067 --> 01:20:13.829
Actually they make everybody else suffer.

01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:15.176
They don't suffer much.

01:20:15.668 --> 01:20:16.672
All such people.

01:20:16.873 --> 01:20:19.285
Because if you don't eat anything

01:20:19.402 --> 01:20:21.318
you starve, you make yourself miserable.

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:23.775
Everybody else will be miserable with that person.

01:20:24.155 --> 01:20:27.851
Supposing you want to hurt ME, the best thing is to fast.

01:20:28.775 --> 01:20:31.350
You see Mother I am fasting then I don't feel like eating Myself.

01:20:31.549 --> 01:20:33.965
If My children are fasting, why should I eat?

01:20:35.646 --> 01:20:38.357
But if I say don't fast, then that is the

01:20:38.711 --> 01:20:40.309
most sinister thing I have told you.

01:20:40.986 --> 01:20:43.448
You can fast as much as you like all your life

01:20:43.649 --> 01:20:45.286
and make everybody fast, doesn't matter.

01:20:45.497 --> 01:20:47.040
But not in the name of God

01:20:47.448 --> 01:20:50.539
You are maligning God. He is Joy!

01:20:51.184 --> 01:20:53.970
He has made all this world so beautiful

01:20:55.097 --> 01:20:56.120
for you to come!

01:20:56.321 --> 01:20:58.879
He wants to welcome you to His own kingdom!

01:20:59.742 --> 01:21:00.926
And what He finds?

01:21:01.127 --> 01:21:04.816
The people are beating himself, themselves or beating others

01:21:05.204 --> 01:21:08.150
or fasting or torturing themselves.

01:21:08.351 --> 01:21:12.942
This is the kind of attitude that is not going to please God at all.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.477
I don't know from where these ideas might have come from people

01:21:19.678 --> 01:21:21.242
who preached about God.

01:21:21.369 --> 01:21:24.334
Because they must be saying, you starve and give all food to me.

01:21:26.397 --> 01:21:28.844
You become a sanyasi. Give all your money to me.

01:21:28.972 --> 01:21:30.072
Must be this is the reason.

01:21:30.342 --> 01:21:33.671
I cannot find any reason for this kind of nonsense

01:21:33.869 --> 01:21:36.950
that you should fast , you should suffer.

01:21:37.879 --> 01:21:39.779
In Sahaj yoga no body is allowed to do that.

01:21:40.204 --> 01:21:42.581
And if you have to do that, then please don't come to Sahaj yoga.

01:21:44.084 --> 01:21:46.147
You have to know that God

01:21:47.005 --> 01:21:52.859
wants you to be the happiest person, to be the most joyous person

01:21:53.103 --> 01:21:57.083
a person without any problems, without any tension

01:21:58.151 --> 01:21:59.251
without any trouble

01:22:00.585 --> 01:22:04.144
enjoying the beauty and the grace

01:22:05.037 --> 01:22:06.818
with all His bliss upon you.

01:22:08.866 --> 01:22:10.837
But for that first of all

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.024
you have to make your mind

01:22:13.752 --> 01:22:15.669
that you first of all forgive yourself.

01:22:17.169 --> 01:22:18.269
and then forgive others.

01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:21.410
and just sit with an open mind.

01:22:21.927 --> 01:22:23.924
I am sure you will get all your realisation

01:22:24.131 --> 01:22:26.608
and feel this all pervading power of God

01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:28.825
like vibrations or cool breeze

01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:31.429
which is called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

01:22:31.636 --> 01:22:32.981
on your finger tips.

01:22:34.641 --> 01:22:35.845
Some may not feel

01:22:36.046 --> 01:22:39.010
possibly because of some troubles, some obstructions

01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:41.037
some mental projections. May be!

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.565
But that doesn't mean they will not feel later.

01:22:44.699 --> 01:22:45.795
And they should not go and criticize

01:22:45.996 --> 01:22:48.785
"Oh! i didn't feel, it is all humbug." This is nonsense.

01:22:50.505 --> 01:22:52.001
This is like dog in the manger.

01:22:52.854 --> 01:22:55.023
You cannot eat and don't allow others to eat.

01:22:58.067 --> 01:23:01.380
If you do not feel it then don't condemn yourself either.

01:23:01.945 --> 01:23:04.195
We can workout, you can come back to the center

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:05.134
and get your realisation.

01:23:05.982 --> 01:23:08.486
Now the time has come for all of us to be wise

01:23:09.163 --> 01:23:10.454
and not to be stupid anymore.

01:23:10.843 --> 01:23:11.943
You have done enough of stupidity.

01:23:13.077 --> 01:23:14.882
Alright as children they are forgiven.

01:23:15.617 --> 01:23:17.184
But if you are born like that

01:23:17.814 --> 01:23:19.913
I don't know where you will land

01:23:20.257 --> 01:23:22.213
and where this world is going to land ultimately.

01:23:23.427 --> 01:23:28.323
So, all of us have to decide, those who are here, that from today

01:23:28.644 --> 01:23:32.369
because the new year has started, let us try to be wise.

01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:36.051
And the wisdom has its own powers

01:23:37.288 --> 01:23:39.410
beauty has its own powers

01:23:40.244 --> 01:23:42.879
and love has its all powers.

01:23:43.332 --> 01:23:46.391
Everything emerges into the ocean of 'Love of God'.

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:53.802
I had told you that I would talk to you in Hindi also.

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:56.813
And I talk to you in spoken language used in our daily life only.

01:23:57.066 --> 01:24:00.990
I do not use any such language which you may not understand.

01:24:01.306 --> 01:24:05.643
So,those who are against the Hindi language, they are requested that

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:08.064
I cannot learn many languages.

01:24:08.265 --> 01:24:10.490
I have learnt as many languages as I could

01:24:10.691 --> 01:24:12.353
and it is your daily spoken language

01:24:12.608 --> 01:24:16.109
I speak in the same language in which you watch cinema.

01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:18.272
Some people told ME, "Mother , please speak in Panjabi."

01:24:18.509 --> 01:24:20.523
Earlier I knew Punjabi language a little,

01:24:20.753 --> 01:24:23.549
but now for the past so much time

01:24:25.802 --> 01:24:28.734
it has not been used, so have forgotten a little.

01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:31.688
But the language must be that of 'Love'.

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:35.315
Learn the language of 'Love'.

01:24:36.101 --> 01:24:38.605
What have you done after learning so many languages?

01:24:39.635 --> 01:24:42.060
Simply think that after learning so many languages

01:24:42.261 --> 01:24:43.388
we have given rise to all quarrels.

01:24:44.333 --> 01:24:47.674
After that , after learning Dharma what rivalry did we give rise to?

01:24:48.818 --> 01:24:52.840
If Dharma teaches to quarrel, then that cannot be Dharma.

01:24:53.518 --> 01:24:56.775
Because we are the cells of same one God

01:24:57.882 --> 01:25:00.370
the cells of this one God.

01:25:00.608 --> 01:25:03.255
If your one hand starts quarrelling with another hand

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:09.126
what shall a mother say,"Son, you are two hands of one single body."

01:25:11.185 --> 01:25:14.109
Now when we see that wherever we pay attention

01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:16.026
quarrel goes on even in the name of religion.

01:25:16.227 --> 01:25:19.439
tomorrow's children will say , "God save from such a religion

01:25:19.463 --> 01:25:20.910
and God save from such Gods also."

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:25.317
Your children only will say that they don't want such a religion.

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:30.261
What you are asking for today, will be abused tomorrow and lost

01:25:31.217 --> 01:25:33.467
because its proof must be visible.

01:25:33.971 --> 01:25:35.618
Its result must be visible.

01:25:35.992 --> 01:25:41.132
People must know what was the result and what did we achieve.

01:25:41.759 --> 01:25:44.729
If somebody in the house,

01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:47.699
sows babool, people ask,"why are you sowing Babool?

01:25:47.753 --> 01:25:49.508
says, because thorns will grow out of it.

01:25:49.818 --> 01:25:51.222
Why are you sowing thorns?

01:25:51.433 --> 01:25:53.375
Sowing thorns so that , these prick people.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.420
Very good condition of yours.

01:25:55.668 --> 01:25:56.768
Why are you thinking like that?

01:25:56.884 --> 01:25:59.642
I want that these should prick everyone so that they curse me only.

01:26:00.576 --> 01:26:01.476
Very good!

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:06.239
All such foolishness that we are making one after the other

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:09.537
the time has come to put an end to all such foolishness.

01:26:09.691 --> 01:26:11.082
If you do not put an end to it

01:26:11.283 --> 01:26:14.418
God will put an end to it as well as to you.

01:26:16.374 --> 01:26:21.643
Do not blame God for wrong doings.

01:26:22.684 --> 01:26:25.657
For wrong things ,don't say God has said so.

01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:28.189
God has said so. He can never say so.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.410
We have popularised such wrong assertions

01:26:32.535 --> 01:26:35.666
and in every religion their agents are sitting amongst them.

01:26:36.006 --> 01:26:36.992
In which religion it is not so?

01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:40.642
It is so in Christians, in Muslims, in Sikhs

01:26:40.792 --> 01:26:43.250
no less in Hindus, in thousands.

01:26:45.145 --> 01:26:47.593
Tell Me, in which religion there are not its agents?

01:26:47.918 --> 01:26:50.033
Everybody is earning money. Everything is means of earning money.

01:26:50.227 --> 01:26:52.750
God doesn't understand a single penny.

01:26:52.782 --> 01:26:55.806
If you tell ME tomorrow to write a cheque for a bank,

01:26:56.007 --> 01:26:57.363
I will say, "You write it, I don't know how to write it."

01:26:57.716 --> 01:27:00.735
I have got worldwide wisdom, but I have no knowledge of banks.

01:27:00.936 --> 01:27:02.939
I cannot understand Bank.

01:27:04.332 --> 01:27:06.840
The God who does not understand money,

01:27:07.041 --> 01:27:09.162
you are eaning money in His name.

01:27:09.395 --> 01:27:12.144
Only means of earning money started.

01:27:12.877 --> 01:27:15.809
Now there will start the trade of committing murder.

01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:20.245
Beyond that there will start the trade of all evil acts.

01:27:20.691 --> 01:27:24.874
You must have heard that in the olden days there were such temples

01:27:25.004 --> 01:27:27.825
where all the evil acts were done in the name of God.

01:27:28.684 --> 01:27:30.473
Cheating started in our country.

01:27:30.935 --> 01:27:34.173
By doing all this, by doing all these evil acts

01:27:34.387 --> 01:27:36.386
not having the blessings of God

01:27:36.587 --> 01:27:37.714
people blame God

01:27:37.915 --> 01:27:41.577
and your children will say there is nothing like God.

01:27:42.677 --> 01:27:44.678
Whatever the number of your views are

01:27:44.879 --> 01:27:47.710
there is communism of the whole world

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:50.966
one is imperialism

01:27:51.292 --> 01:27:53.132
somebody says that

01:27:53.577 --> 01:27:55.909
there should be independance

01:27:56.110 --> 01:27:58.307
some say there should be social democracy

01:27:58.508 --> 01:28:01.031
by creating varieties of isms.

01:28:01.444 --> 01:28:03.741
Now what did you get finally? This you should think.

01:28:04.393 --> 01:28:07.667
Today you go to America, nobody's life is safe.

01:28:07.868 --> 01:28:09.135
It is not in Delhi only.

01:28:09.381 --> 01:28:11.137
Everybody was telling Me about bangles,

01:28:11.338 --> 01:28:12.933
but on the day of Diwali one has to wear it.

01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:14.768
Take these out or the people will snatch (bangles).

01:28:16.828 --> 01:28:19.450
The position of a man in Delhi is , just like a cat

01:28:20.497 --> 01:28:22.580
and the same is going on at other places too.

01:28:23.207 --> 01:28:26.980
So all these excellencies you have accomplished

01:28:27.718 --> 01:28:30.277
on the basis of which people are bewildered all over the world.

01:28:30.522 --> 01:28:32.143
Wherever you go, there is terror

01:28:32.344 --> 01:28:35.000
No notion is no where successful.

01:28:35.307 --> 01:28:37.682
I have been to Russia as well to China.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.225
and I have been to America as well. All are of the same metal.

01:28:42.012 --> 01:28:43.953
Everybody is cutting his neck with his hand

01:28:44.154 --> 01:28:45.763
and cutting his nose as well.

01:28:47.085 --> 01:28:50.112
And we are following them.

01:28:51.254 --> 01:28:53.266
Using their own wisdom, if everybody

01:28:53.467 --> 01:28:55.323
has to go to hell, then it is very easy.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.894
Let there be vacancy in hell.

01:28:57.095 --> 01:28:58.500
How can there be so much space available suddenly?

01:29:01.993 --> 01:29:03.088
Let there be some arrangement first

01:29:03.105 --> 01:29:05.206
Mother has anxiety even if you have to go to hell.

01:29:05.407 --> 01:29:06.926
Even if they go to hell, let there be arrangement there

01:29:07.127 --> 01:29:08.135
where the children will sit.

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:14.706
So, such a wave that we have started

01:29:14.899 --> 01:29:16.855
the reality is far from that.

01:29:17.292 --> 01:29:19.319
Exactly on the other side it is darkness there.

01:29:20.055 --> 01:29:21.055
It is mist

01:29:22.055 --> 01:29:23.987
in which you are getting deep down more and more

01:29:24.295 --> 01:29:29.167
ascending towards God and looking upward towards Him is reality.

01:29:31.152 --> 01:29:33.322
Where from these agents will give you PARMATMA(God).

01:29:33.523 --> 01:29:35.554
These agents are money minting people.

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:37.932
You only tell,

01:29:38.163 --> 01:29:42.500
"How much money do you pay to these flowers to become fruits?"

01:29:43.334 --> 01:29:45.694
How much money do you pay to this mother earth

01:29:45.895 --> 01:29:46.887
SASHYA SHYAAMALAAM ( productive and brown coloured motherland)

01:29:47.088 --> 01:29:47.938
which helped you so much?

01:29:48.338 --> 01:29:51.374
You have raised so much hue and cry

01:29:51.883 --> 01:29:53.829
With what great difficulty this mother earth

01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:55.609
cradled and brought up us

01:29:55.673 --> 01:29:58.652
and we are destroying it like this.

01:29:58.714 --> 01:29:59.954
Have saddened it so much

01:30:00.155 --> 01:30:01.736
and even after doing that even today

01:30:01.937 --> 01:30:03.189
that SASYA SHYAMALAM mother earth

01:30:03.301 --> 01:30:06.304
cradles us even today

01:30:06.608 --> 01:30:09.104
Cares for us, looks after us.

01:30:09.305 --> 01:30:11.391
Even taking that into consideration as well

01:30:12.057 --> 01:30:13.942
We do not understand

01:30:14.305 --> 01:30:17.277
that on which path are we digging ourselves.

01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:19.564
All those who are God's messengers

01:30:19.765 --> 01:30:23.099
just perceive that these five elements

01:30:23.119 --> 01:30:24.742
these are God's messengers

01:30:25.107 --> 01:30:28.730
these are their angles ready to help us.

01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:32.881
It is only we who are ready to cut our neck, what shall God do?

01:30:33.538 --> 01:30:35.224
Within you there is Kundalini as well

01:30:35.714 --> 01:30:39.709
and within you, your mother kundalini is settled there beautifully.

01:30:41.039 --> 01:30:43.177
It is settled perfectly in three and half circles.

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:44.905
Poor (KUNDALINI) is waiting

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:47.240
that let the foolish fellows come to the right path.

01:30:50.498 --> 01:30:53.065
Then your chakras are also beautifully made.

01:30:54.203 --> 01:30:57.786
and how beautiful arrangement God has made.

01:30:58.329 --> 01:30:59.521
You haven't got any knowledge as yet,

01:30:59.722 --> 01:31:01.818
your eyes have not even opened as yet.

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:06.193
When your eyes will open, you will come to know then.

01:31:06.932 --> 01:31:08.666
Then you will understand.

01:31:09.236 --> 01:31:12.719
Oh! in what darkness we had sunk?

01:31:12.941 --> 01:31:14.946
somewhere under the darkness of ego

01:31:15.065 --> 01:31:17.465
Somewhere under the darkness of fright

01:31:17.667 --> 01:31:20.631
in the darkness of greed for some wrong things

01:31:20.691 --> 01:31:24.155
covered with all the six evils, where shall we go?

01:31:25.249 --> 01:31:27.927
All these things are absolutely within you.

01:31:28.617 --> 01:31:30.664
What discussion you will do in this case?

01:31:30.865 --> 01:31:33.845
I see many people stand in front of Me with clubs in their hands.

01:31:34.666 --> 01:31:35.566
I asked them, "Why?"

01:31:35.674 --> 01:31:38.185
They said ,"They were saying that by raising Kundalini it happens,"

01:31:38.386 --> 01:31:40.009
I said," You better go to them."

01:31:41.137 --> 01:31:42.664
Anyone says anything

01:31:43.046 --> 01:31:44.236
if anyone says anything

01:31:44.437 --> 01:31:46.718
is getting it published in newspaper, how does it matter?

01:31:46.847 --> 01:31:49.573
You take a plain paper and print it out.

01:31:50.191 --> 01:31:53.243
Anyone who prints anything, is that a Shastra?

01:31:53.498 --> 01:31:55.783
Is that about God?

01:31:56.264 --> 01:31:58.140
How much effort did Nanak Sahab made?

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:00.303
that all those who were realised souls

01:32:00.961 --> 01:32:03.194
all those have been put together in Granth Sahab

01:32:03.986 --> 01:32:07.045
attatched them in Granth Sahab, attatched Namdev to it.

01:32:07.412 --> 01:32:10.119
And the day before yesterday, I thought that in the temple of Namdev

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.829
somebody had been murdered. Oh! Ram

01:32:12.877 --> 01:32:13.877
That Namdev

01:32:14.876 --> 01:32:18.252
What to talk of Him to you. Only Nanak sahab could understand Him.

01:32:20.015 --> 01:32:21.391
When Namdev

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.198
went to meet Gora kumbhar (a saint and potter by trade)

01:32:24.744 --> 01:32:27.068
he said these words, see what beautiful words he said.

01:32:27.101 --> 01:32:30.104
See his beauty  and our crudeness

01:32:30.424 --> 01:32:31.524
and foolishness.

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:34.671
Now , Gora kumbhar, was a poor potter

01:32:34.867 --> 01:32:37.204
whom we should call, a schedule caste and this tailor

01:32:38.989 --> 01:32:40.893
just on seeing him, he says

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:43.907
NIRGUNACHE  BHETI AALO SUGUNASANGE'

01:32:44.652 --> 01:32:45.582
in the guise of Nirguna (without qualities)

01:32:45.783 --> 01:32:47.438
i reached Saguna (refers to God)

01:32:47.639 --> 01:32:48.874
in the form of Saguna Nirguna was standing.

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:54.352
This love, this respect and this honour only a yogi can do

01:32:56.293 --> 01:32:59.150
to respect another person is not possible for a man.

01:32:59.876 --> 01:33:00.976
They can't do.

01:33:01.296 --> 01:33:03.402
Because you don't know

01:33:08.433 --> 01:33:11.604
how much loving the other person is, how much dignified.

01:33:11.766 --> 01:33:13.574
Some minister comes to you and you run after him.

01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:15.851
He left yesterday, you ignored him and ran after another one.

01:33:16.101 --> 01:33:20.665
You don't have any discretion whom to follow and whom to run after

01:33:21.618 --> 01:33:23.249
If you have your own dignity

01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:25.553
you can recognise another dignified person.

01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:27.955
That this Sakhshat (In reality) dignified person

01:33:29.139 --> 01:33:30.386
is standing in the form of Saguna.

01:33:30.704 --> 01:33:33.223
But you don't have the eye to recognise that.

01:33:33.568 --> 01:33:36.103
For that too one should have eye that has light.

01:33:36.592 --> 01:33:39.279
Thousands of people wrote

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.834
many said

01:33:41.633 --> 01:33:44.192
but today we are just forgotten and wandering.

01:33:44.735 --> 01:33:46.389
And what to talk of these Hindus!

01:33:51.198 --> 01:33:54.241
You are paying for that sin and save God from these Christians.

01:33:55.206 --> 01:33:57.642
If you find a more foolish person than them, let ME know.

01:33:59.432 --> 01:34:01.608
All the frivolous tales about Christ are there.

01:34:01.809 --> 01:34:03.984
Now a days they even say that Christ was a human being.

01:34:04.257 --> 01:34:06.124
Who has told them so?

01:34:06.926 --> 01:34:08.206
One gentleman in England has said

01:34:08.407 --> 01:34:11.191
he is a renowned person, called Bishop of Durham

01:34:11.764 --> 01:34:13.935
that Christ was an ordinary man.

01:34:14.255 --> 01:34:17.435
His birth has been just like us

01:34:17.635 --> 01:34:20.312
some of His disciples were uneducated.

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:25.532
Just ask them ,"What do you know about Christ?"

01:34:26.254 --> 01:34:29.226
Do you have the insight to know Him?"

01:34:29.604 --> 01:34:33.462
Do you have the ability that you are telling to Christ

01:34:33.626 --> 01:34:35.274
Because somebody has elected you

01:34:35.475 --> 01:34:37.919
somebody appointed you as Bishop and somebody as Pope

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.362
have you become a great man?

01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:43.900
In this way, you put them on your heads, beat drums and wander.

01:34:44.698 --> 01:34:47.241
I am telling you that all these drum beatings are of hell.

01:34:47.503 --> 01:34:48.719
By following these wrong gurus

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:51.512
do not take yourself and your children to hell.

01:34:51.713 --> 01:34:53.676
There is unrighteousness in all these religions.

01:34:54.124 --> 01:34:56.610
DHARMA is only of one VISHWA DHARM PARMATMA

01:34:56.811 --> 01:34:58.983
and that DHARMA is to achieve God.

01:34:59.265 --> 01:35:01.497
Till now, tell Me who did not say so?

01:35:01.648 --> 01:35:02.748
Am I telling it today?

01:35:04.025 --> 01:35:05.973
Were all those liars who said

01:35:06.207 --> 01:35:09.504
KAHE NANAK BINA AAPA CHINE MITEY NA BRAMHA KI KAI

01:35:09.705 --> 01:35:11.427
How many people recognised AAPA?

01:35:11.866 --> 01:35:13.378
Those who had to say said so

01:35:14.261 --> 01:35:15.808
They said thousands of times and left

01:35:15.959 --> 01:35:19.016
They were tortured to death when they were living

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.846
and till now only they are killing.

01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:23.824
I say,"Be aware!"

01:35:25.107 --> 01:35:27.261
To everybody I as a Mother today

01:35:28.837 --> 01:35:29.937
warn you

01:35:30.668 --> 01:35:32.586
there is no need to go forward than this.

01:35:33.393 --> 01:35:36.664
Stand up and get in Sahaj Yoga

01:35:37.582 --> 01:35:40.807
and proudly become saints.

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:47.027
Avail this NIRGUNA which is today spread all around us

01:35:47.466 --> 01:35:48.609
sitting to respect us

01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:50.344
sitting to honour us.

01:35:50.792 --> 01:35:52.601
Obtain that.

01:35:52.802 --> 01:35:56.681
Are you going to take these useless things on your head?

01:35:57.319 --> 01:35:58.862
That which you should take

01:35:59.568 --> 01:36:01.174
that which is available to you so easily

01:36:01.424 --> 01:36:03.610
when this diamond is so easily available

01:36:03.761 --> 01:36:05.987
then why not to get that?

01:36:06.697 --> 01:36:08.764
I cannot understand man's wisdom

01:36:09.293 --> 01:36:11.074
My father was tired of making ME understand.

01:36:11.274 --> 01:36:12.765
He would say,"You won't understand all this."

01:36:13.242 --> 01:36:15.301
In reality I am still learning.

01:36:15.987 --> 01:36:18.974
How does a human being looks at things from the reverse side?

01:36:19.699 --> 01:36:21.735
Why he doesn't look at things from the right side?

01:36:22.387 --> 01:36:25.186
And when everyone has already said, specially in our own country

01:36:25.364 --> 01:36:27.343
there are so many great saints.

01:36:28.179 --> 01:36:29.532
Hey! feel ashamed of yourself!

01:36:32.965 --> 01:36:37.445
Today, we have a lot of questions, for example

01:36:39.567 --> 01:36:40.196
In our culture it has been said,

01:36:40.397 --> 01:36:43.120
YATRA NARIYA PUJYANTE TATRA RAMANTE DEVATA

01:36:43.344 --> 01:36:46.570
Where a woman is worth adoring and adored

01:36:47.396 --> 01:36:49.098
there itself Gods reside.

01:36:50.232 --> 01:36:51.885
Here the way women are

01:36:52.965 --> 01:36:53.865
tortured

01:36:54.162 --> 01:36:56.988
every Indian thinks that he is a male

01:36:57.243 --> 01:37:00.127
he has the right to get rid of woman.

01:37:00.574 --> 01:37:02.585
The person who has given birth to you is your mother

01:37:03.128 --> 01:37:05.026
One who is by your side is your wife

01:37:05.227 --> 01:37:06.048
one who is your daughter,

01:37:06.249 --> 01:37:07.509
they are all women.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.127
By doing excesses with women

01:37:09.328 --> 01:37:12.299
she becomes lioness and can dispose off you.

01:37:12.561 --> 01:37:14.152
But what is the use of this rivalry?

01:37:14.353 --> 01:37:16.225
This rivalry is of no use.

01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:20.385
This rivalry is there because you don't know

01:37:21.103 --> 01:37:23.096
You are the two wheels of one chariot

01:37:23.297 --> 01:37:25.189
one in the left , the other in the right.

01:37:25.288 --> 01:37:29.392
Both are of same height but not alike

01:37:31.639 --> 01:37:34.519
In Sahaj Yoga last time

01:37:36.567 --> 01:37:42.032
according to our desire and joyfully we had fifty one marriages.

01:37:42.318 --> 01:37:43.884
But out of fifty one marriages

01:37:45.322 --> 01:37:48.575
not even one marriage failed. All the marriages are going on nicely.

01:37:49.548 --> 01:37:51.571
It gives a great joy to see them.

01:37:51.772 --> 01:37:56.566
Clapping

01:37:56.632 --> 01:38:00.276
Apart from this diseases get cured just by the way.

01:38:00.848 --> 01:38:03.736
Just now you saw one gentleman who came up to the stage

01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:06.534
He had blood cancer, he got well absolutely.

01:38:07.264 --> 01:38:10.518
Your diseases, come atleast with this greed, I am your Mother.

01:38:10.777 --> 01:38:12.490
that first

01:38:12.691 --> 01:38:14.147
even if castroil has to be given

01:38:14.348 --> 01:38:16.159
she gives it by covering it with chocolate.

01:38:16.647 --> 01:38:18.440
Ok! come to get cured.

01:38:18.691 --> 01:38:21.361
No, we are healthy. We are very strong.

01:38:22.048 --> 01:38:25.484
Ok for your peace! We live in absolute peace.

01:38:26.691 --> 01:38:27.691
Very peaceful! We are very peaceful!

01:38:27.739 --> 01:38:30.954
We are in peace, we slap wife twice or thrice and nothing else.

01:38:31.001 --> 01:38:31.636
Clapping

01:38:31.837 --> 01:38:34.477
We take out all our anger on wife . We are sitting peacefully.

01:38:34.534 --> 01:38:36.360
You are very peaceful! What to speak of you!

01:38:39.256 --> 01:38:41.852
We have got enough. We don't need anything.

01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:44.587
Then I can't say anything

01:38:44.788 --> 01:38:47.601
But you will come, by and by you also come.

01:38:48.337 --> 01:38:50.002
But My son, why not to get it now?

01:38:51.171 --> 01:38:52.171
Now, I have come!

01:38:52.865 --> 01:38:56.109
Dr. Sahab said,"Mother please come to Delhi for one day."

01:38:57.041 --> 01:38:58.918
He has come. Here is a center.

01:38:59.383 --> 01:39:00.866
Three four doctors are carrying on research work.

01:39:01.067 --> 01:39:03.127
They have found out that by joining Sahaj Yoga

01:39:03.328 --> 01:39:05.093
a human being instantly becomes

01:39:05.729 --> 01:39:09.341
Which in Punjabi language is called ' very good '

01:39:12.010 --> 01:39:14.341
when he took their readings.

01:39:14.542 --> 01:39:17.341
Now he is writing a paper, that he noted in that reading

01:39:17.730 --> 01:39:20.464
that man's [INAUDIBLE] resistance power increased

01:39:21.087 --> 01:39:22.596
his stress level decreased

01:39:23.398 --> 01:39:26.311
which you call ' tension'. ' Now a days i have got tension '

01:39:26.512 --> 01:39:27.214
That was over.

01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:30.412
When this hole occurs in Bramharandra, then there is no tension.

01:39:31.233 --> 01:39:33.459
And in this way he found out lot of things

01:39:33.755 --> 01:39:35.642
And we are carrying on research work over cancer as well

01:39:35.792 --> 01:39:37.589
Research means, as such everything is research only

01:39:37.662 --> 01:39:42.102
but he had said that you collect all the reports of this

01:39:42.187 --> 01:39:42.978
and make its documents.

01:39:43.179 --> 01:39:44.487
That we are doing.

01:39:45.447 --> 01:39:48.359
But even after doing this, please do not get here only sick people.

01:39:48.499 --> 01:39:51.769
kindly, everyone here must not be sick.

01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:53.838
Some must be such who are healthy.

01:39:54.061 --> 01:39:55.299
Bring such people also.

01:39:56.016 --> 01:39:58.937
Because we want such people also who can cure other people.

01:39:59.517 --> 01:40:01.751
Now, I have only two hands.

01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:05.108
And with these two hands whatever I can do, I do.

01:40:06.209 --> 01:40:09.392
I request you that in this great movement

01:40:10.262 --> 01:40:14.370
It is for the betterment of the whole world.

01:40:15.112 --> 01:40:17.965
Must come! We don't need any money for this.

01:40:18.904 --> 01:40:21.576
I don't need any respect. I don't need anything.

01:40:22.489 --> 01:40:25.683
Even if you don't give anything to Mother, She will still love you.

01:40:25.842 --> 01:40:26.842
This you know very well.

01:40:27.596 --> 01:40:29.007
So, I don't want anything from you.

01:40:29.325 --> 01:40:32.313
I only want that you take what is yours.

01:40:33.915 --> 01:40:36.208
Whtever is hidden within you

01:40:36.857 --> 01:40:39.958
that which is subtle, get it. It is your right.

01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:41.768
That you should get.

01:40:42.325 --> 01:40:47.016
May God give you all wisdom and blessings.
