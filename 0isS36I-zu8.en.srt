1
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:12,540
It’s your birthright as a human
being to become the Spirit.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,480
That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha
means “with” and ja is “born."

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:27,720
Born with you is the right to get this
yoga, is the union with the divine.

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,880
It’s your birthright as a human being.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,372
You are as I told you at the epitome of evolution.

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,945
And it has to work out, but please
open your hearts and open your minds.

7
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:49,472
The unique experience of self-realization

8
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:54,925
takes place when the primordial energy
called Kundalini is correctly awakened

9
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:59,869
by someone who has already experienced
and mastered their own self-realization.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,608
Shri Mataji has explained that the Kundalini
is the power of our spiritual ascent found

11
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:11,280
in the triangular bone at the base of
the spine called sacrum by the Greeks.

12
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:15,265
It is the power of our pure desire.

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,100
When awakened the Kundalini rises spontaneously
through six subtle centers called chakras.

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,557
The Kundalini then emerges through the
fontanelle bone area at the top of thehead

15
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:33,758
emitting a cool breeze that can
be felt there as well as on the hands.
