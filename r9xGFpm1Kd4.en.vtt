00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.440
While worshipping Shri Ganesha you have to know

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.280
that such a powerful thing

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.800
you have to establish within yourself

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.440
and by that establishment

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:41.240
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.080
and the power of Shri Ganesha's

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.200
greatness is auspiciousness.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.960
It's a coefficience;

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.840
it's a formula, we can say in scientific language,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.680
that emits auspiciousness.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.680
It's a magnet in the Mother Earth.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.760
The same magnet is within you,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.040
which is Shri Ganesha.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.800
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.440
which is the north, south, east, west.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.280
Close My eyes, still I'll tell you.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.600
You know there are so many birds who fly out

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.720
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.120
because they have that magnet with them,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.440
they have that innocence with them.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.400
There are so many fishes,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.520
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.880
Scientists should find out.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:21.160
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:30.960
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.080
becomes magnetic

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.120
and magnet attracts the steel

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.920
-- not dried leaves, does not -- steel.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.840
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.880
Is a man with the steel, say.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.560
"Man of steel" -- a person who has character, conviction

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.800
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.600
is a man of steel.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.240
So this magnet attracts the steel.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.640
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.080
not pliable, it's rather dry

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.240
but the magnet attracts, means

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.600
it creates that special quality in the steel

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.640
that it moves towards the magnet.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.680
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.080
you'll be amazed.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.960
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.000
they'll be running towards you.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.480
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.040
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.000
-- anywhere, any place.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.840
So what is this magnet?

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.240
Is pure love.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.360
Is pure love

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.440
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn't depend

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.720
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.080
It is the support of itself.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.720
It's like light that spreads just by its own nature,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.360
doesn't want anything,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.640
doesn't expect anything.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.680
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people's hearts.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.840
That's why they get attracted.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.560
Those who have not even seen Me,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.000
those who have not even known Me,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.200
just with My name, I've seen,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.400
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.360
that they said, "We have to call the police".

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.680
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.600
we'll manage somehow."

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.360
In Poona we had such crowds

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.920
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.520
He said, "Mother, I'll give You very big area

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.560
where You can sit down in a big open place

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.960
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished."

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.120
I said, "You don't worry,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.160
everything will be in proper place."

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.960
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.920
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.160
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.720
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.800
Just like a picture.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.880
No movement of hand, feet, eyes -- nothing.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.200
Just sitting like a picture.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.280
And the gentleman who owned that hall

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.520
had never seen such a thing before.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.280
Throughout for one and half hour,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.760
no movement of any kind.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.640
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.960
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.680
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.560
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.440
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:25.440
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.600
A child, there's one child,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.240
everybody is attracted towards the child.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.120
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.480
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.600
everybody would be worried about the child.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.120
What's happening to the child?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.200
They will not think: it's an Arab child or an American child, no.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.120
Unless and until it's a devil.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.680
Why this attraction for children?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.600
Because their magnets are intact.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.240
Their ego has not yet developed.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.840
Our ego developed, had to develop

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.960
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.440
what is right and what is wrong.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.400
So the ego developed was all right.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.320
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.000
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.200
overlapped the superego also.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.240
No conditioning, nothing.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.400
We'll do whatever we like.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.760
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.360
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.720
Then we'll cut our hair or we'll do this, we'll do that.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.080
No conditioning of any kind.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.560
All superego was also covered -- ego.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.520
This ego would have been all right

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.200
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.400
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.960
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.160
If you see a farmer and a big professor

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.400
or a very well educated man

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.880
and talk to both of them. You'll find the farmer

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.280
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.280
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.240
He knows the living process.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.760
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.320
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:04.400
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.800
ten ego-oriented people.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.440
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.160
is that you become a wise person.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.280
When you speak, people start looking at you.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.240
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:42.680
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.160
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.160
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.680
is good for nothing.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.360
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.200
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.760
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.640
and hitting that person.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.520
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.560
they say, "That bull, the same bull".

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.840
Everybody reports about the same bull.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.600
"Oh, that's the one, all right."

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.320
So it grants you wisdom.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.960
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.440
your eyes are radiant.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.160
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.640
when He is enlightening you;

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:54.840
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.680
But this glance is so powerful

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.400
that even one glance is sufficient

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.760
to purify thousands of people.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.040
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.560
and you find whole thing changes

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.200
into a beautiful morning

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.720
from a complete dark night.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.880
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.920
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.920
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.440
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.400
He has to certify, "All right. Pass. Go," on every chakra.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.040
And when the Kundalini rises,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.240
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.720
But then when He sleeps down,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:16.240
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.720
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.040
That's not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:36.120
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:43.080
with something that cannot allow

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.640
Shri Ganesha's principle to manifest in us.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.520
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.840
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.360
That's all, but it never dies.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.960
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.440
The another quality of a person who is endowed

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.680
with Shri Ganesha's powers is that

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.640
He removes all the hurdles.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.720
If one person of this nature is in some place,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.600
all the rest of the people who are nearby

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.480
will be saved if there's an accident or if there's any problem,

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.480
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.040
You will find this happening.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:05.440
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.200
He guides you.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.560
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.840
He is the one who is Sahaja.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.680
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.640
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.240
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.800
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:38.960
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:46.880
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:55.000
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.200
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.200
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.440
because all the Gods and Goddesses

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.840
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.440
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.240
He knows,

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:23.120
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.240
To have all the powers of the world,

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.040
just keep the Mother pleased.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.280
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.760
which can be described.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.200
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:57.120
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.120
but He is the one who will tell you

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.120
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.760
That means He gives you the taste of love

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.360
in the food that is cooked for you.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.280
Because He is love.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.800
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.
