Guru Puja, July 12th, 1998

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:21.447
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:03:54.631 --> 00:04:04.396
Today, we have assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

00:04:05.706 --> 00:04:13.497
The word "guru" comes from

00:04:13.698 --> 00:04:19.599
"the one which is magnetic,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.294
the person who is magnetic";

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:31.754
the one which attracts the attention of the seekers

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:37.247
is the guru. Also it means

00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:42.599
the heaviness, or you can say,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.982
a person who is very steady,

00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:57.429
who is very deep, who has the knowledge,

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.577
and who can act like the Mother Earth.

00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:12.443
For the power of magnetism in the Mother Earth

00:05:12.644 --> 00:05:16.123
also is called as magnetic,

00:05:16.324 --> 00:05:20.568
but in Sanskrit is "Gurutwa karshan,"

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:25.888
means "the attraction

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:31.107
of the heaviness of the Mother Earth."

00:05:31.308 --> 00:05:36.599
But actually it is

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.318
a power of the Mother Earth that makes us stand

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:49.920
properly on our legs when it is rotating

00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:52.443
with such a tremendous speed,

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:57.873
otherwise we would be all thrown away.

00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:01.318
With that velocity that She is moving,

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:12.579
we are still attached or we are one in our balance,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.243
is only because She has gravity.

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:25.102
This gravity has to be in a guru.

00:06:25.303 --> 00:06:31.321
Gravity means

00:06:31.522 --> 00:06:41.166
a kind of a serious understanding of oneself

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:46.830
and one's own responsibilities.

00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:52.111
So a guru has to be very steady.

00:06:52.312 --> 00:07:01.139
In these modern times, people are very mobile,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.745
all the time agitated,

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:09.558
all the time getting disturbed.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:14.136
With small things happening here and there, they get disturbed.

00:07:14.337 --> 00:07:19.581
They meet people who are not of any quality,

00:07:19.782 --> 00:07:22.214
then they get disturbed.

00:07:22.415 --> 00:07:26.269
These disturbing qualities

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:32.746
come from our deficiency in our gravity.

00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:37.230
A person who has gravity doesn't get depressed,

00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:40.378
neither get excited,

00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:43.878
nor get overly enthusiastic,

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:48.800
nor is he very sad or unhappy.

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:52.120
So he's in the center,

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:56.495
he's in the center of his being.

00:07:56.696 --> 00:08:01.253
But how do we become the guru?

00:08:01.454 --> 00:08:05.730
That is very important for Sahaja Yogis to understand.

00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:09.035
Many have felt that they are gurus,

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:12.855
they have tried to behave in a funny manner,

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:17.027
and have lost their guru position.

00:08:17.228 --> 00:08:20.735
First and foremost thing for Sahaja Yogis,

00:08:20.936 --> 00:08:26.532
it is important that they must have introspection,

00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:29.798
they must watch themselves.

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:35.306
If a person runs about

00:08:35.507 --> 00:08:39.243
changing because a fashion has come,

00:08:39.444 --> 00:08:44.384
because people have suppressed them, or have asked them;

00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:50.743
just to please people of cheap values,

00:08:50.944 --> 00:08:58.514
if a person changes, then he cannot be a guru.

00:08:59.328 --> 00:09:02.631
He has to station himself

00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:08.170
properly on the values of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:12.389
Without introspection you will not know,

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:16.756
you will never remember what you have done wrong,

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:23.303
nor will you think of what you have to do right.

00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:31.160
But that is only possible if you go on improving yourself.

00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:33.968
First and foremost thing is,

00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:38.429
all the great saints have praised their guru.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:44.156
For example, we have a very great saint,

00:09:44.357 --> 00:09:47.406
Gyaneshwara, in India.

00:09:47.607 --> 00:09:51.140
He's written a complete chapter about the guru.

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:55.210
In English they have translated it as "preceptor" -

00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.804
guru is the preceptor -

00:09:58.005 --> 00:10:01.460
and what he has done is a great thing.

00:10:01.661 --> 00:10:05.538
He says you are not to challenge the guru,

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:09.007
otherwise you can never become a guru;

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:12.632
for name's sake you might be, but you are not.

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:16.788
Secondly, you can never misbehave.

00:10:16.989 --> 00:10:20.601
You can never be rude, arrogant,

00:10:20.802 --> 00:10:25.499
and you cannot show your temper to a guru.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.348
If that is so, that means you are not a guru,

00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:37.884
you are still on a very low level personality.

00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:40.864
It is very clearly said

00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:47.702
that if you try to say against other gurus

00:10:47.903 --> 00:10:51.843
who are real gurus, who are very high caliber,

00:10:52.044 --> 00:10:57.538
that also, then you are not a guru.

00:10:57.746 --> 00:11:02.835
But I would say that you all have got now vibrations,

00:11:03.036 --> 00:11:06.640
you all have got vibratory awareness.

00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:09.445
When you have vibratory awareness,

00:11:09.646 --> 00:11:14.343
you are capable of finding out about everyone.

00:11:14.544 --> 00:11:17.976
Now you need not talk about

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:20.773
your own understanding of a person,

00:11:20.974 --> 00:11:24.828
but try to face that person directly,

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:29.281
and tell that person, "This is the problem,"

00:11:29.482 --> 00:11:32.172
and ask him to change.

00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:37.195
But in Sahaja Yoga we have something more than other gurus had.

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:40.258
Other gurus were very, very strict.

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:44.367
They used to carry a stick in their hand, a big stick

00:11:44.568 --> 00:11:50.258
which they would use for walking or for hitting their disciples.

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:56.054
They used to hit their disciples in such a bad manner

00:11:56.255 --> 00:12:04.355
that the disciple was literally frightened of the guru.

00:12:04.556 --> 00:12:10.602
I'll give you an example of a guru I came across.

00:12:10.803 --> 00:12:16.649
One fellow was there in India

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:22.383
who came to one of the ladies who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:12:22.584 --> 00:12:29.485
and he said that "My guru has sent me word

00:12:29.686 --> 00:12:35.133
that Adi Shakti's going to come and stay with you. Is it true?"

00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:38.852
She said, "Yes, She's going to stay with me. So what?"

00:12:39.053 --> 00:12:42.540
He said, "My guru has told me

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:45.493
that 'You go and request Her,

00:12:45.694 --> 00:12:49.462
and if She could come to our ashram.'"

00:12:49.663 --> 00:12:52.735
She said, "I'll ask Mataji, I don't know."

00:12:52.936 --> 00:13:03.121
This fellow came to a program and he saw Me, a housewife.

00:13:03.322 --> 00:13:06.566
He said, "This cannot be that Guru."

00:13:06.767 --> 00:13:13.379
But when I came in, he saw, and when I did Self Realization,

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.418
that everybody's Kundalini was awakened, he was so surprised

00:13:17.619 --> 00:13:22.316
and he prostrated himself before Me.

00:13:22.517 --> 00:13:25.659
Now, his guru was living in Amarnath,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:35.994
is a very famous religious place in the Himalayas.

00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:40.541
And this fellow lived in a place called Ambarnath.

00:13:40.742 --> 00:13:47.279
So he asked Me, "Mother, will You come to my ashram?"

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.037
I said, "Why not?" Because these gurus in the ancient time

00:13:52.238 --> 00:13:55.725
never used to leave their seat, they call takia -

00:13:55.926 --> 00:14:00.264
means "the pillow" - they never left their takia.

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:02.787
I said, "All right, I don't mind. I'll come to you,

00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:04.952
to your ashram."

00:14:05.153 --> 00:14:08.179
So he's just keeping quiet all the while.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.248
So I went there, this guru fell at My Feet,

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:15.701
and he was very, very respectful;

00:14:15.902 --> 00:14:22.232
and then we came back home.

00:14:22.433 --> 00:14:25.662
So this fellow started telling Me, "If You don't tell my guru,

00:14:25.863 --> 00:14:30.857
I would like to tell You that I have got a very bad Agnya.

00:14:31.058 --> 00:14:34.318
Can You cure, Mother?" I said, "Why not? I will."

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:37.435
So I went back to this guru again, and I said,

00:14:37.636 --> 00:14:41.185
"Why didn't you cure his Agnya?"

00:14:41.386 --> 00:14:45.076
He said, "Why? Why should I cure? Who cured my Agnya?

00:14:45.277 --> 00:14:49.662
 I worked out myself. I had to introspect, find out,

00:14:49.863 --> 00:14:53.756
and I cured my own Agnya, and why should I cure his Agnya?

00:14:53.957 --> 00:14:59.475
Let him plod, let him work, let him get to this.

00:14:59.676 --> 00:15:06.061
Otherwise he will be a spoilt man."

00:15:06.262 --> 00:15:09.506
I was quite surprised. And he said,

00:15:09.707 --> 00:15:13.850
"You do it because You are a Mother. You are nothing but love,

00:15:14.051 --> 00:15:18.873
and that's why You are doing it, all this, for others.

00:15:19.074 --> 00:15:27.231
But not me! No guru will open the Agnya of his disciples."

00:15:27.432 --> 00:15:29.669
I said, "Then why are you a guru?"

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:35.440
He said, "Because we have to guide them.

00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:57.468
And if they have their Agnya badly cut out,

00:15:57.669 --> 00:16:03.757
if their attention is not all right, I'm not bothered about it.

00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:07.835
It is their duty to introspect and find,

00:16:08.036 --> 00:16:11.233
and climb the ladder which I've put before them.

00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:16.069
So I'm a guru, I can only give them the ladder to climb up.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.038
It is they who should work very hard,

00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:21.944
it is they who should introspect,

00:16:22.145 --> 00:16:24.733
it is they who should correct themselves.

00:16:24.934 --> 00:16:28.616
Why should I help them to such an extent

00:16:28.817 --> 00:16:31.944
that you open their Agnya?"

00:16:32.145 --> 00:16:34.746
I said, "All right, you allow Me to open his Agnya,

00:16:34.947 --> 00:16:35.947
if you don't mind."

00:16:36.148 --> 00:16:38.277
He said, "You are a Mother, do what You like;

00:16:38.478 --> 00:16:42.019
I have nothing to say. If You want to do that,

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.300
You'll spoil him, You'll spoil him.

00:16:46.501 --> 00:16:48.933
Let him do it on his own,

00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:51.699
otherwise You'll be spoiling him."

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.840
I said, "As you are also spoiling,

00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:57.168
that you don't open anybody's Agnyas, yes?"

00:16:57.369 --> 00:17:02.410
"But whatever position I've achieved is a permanent one."

00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:05.598
So I opened his Agnya.

00:17:05.799 --> 00:17:10.332
Then this fellow, on his way he told Me that

00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:15.809
his guru came back "and he put me hanging on a well.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.848
And he used to every time lower the rope

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:24.598
so I would go into the water. Ten times he did it."

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:27.668
But I said, "Why did he do such a cruel thing?"

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.770
He said, "Because he found me smoking a cigarette."

00:17:30.971 --> 00:17:33.598
My goodness!

00:17:33.815 --> 00:17:35.384
So I asked his guru, I said,

00:17:35.585 --> 00:17:38.907
"Why do you do such horrible things to your disciples?"

00:17:39.108 --> 00:17:42.930
He said, "Otherwise, if you don't do like that

00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:46.266
they will never rise, they'll never come up.

00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:49.657
You go on forgiving them and the more you forgive,

00:17:49.858 --> 00:17:54.196
the worse they become, and they will show no ascent at all.

00:17:54.397 --> 00:17:56.969
So you have to be very strict with them.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.985
Please don't spoil them all the time."

00:18:01.186 --> 00:18:04.423
I was really surprised. How could he say so?

00:18:04.624 --> 00:18:09.829
"You see," he said, "Mother, if you give everything free,

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.876
you give them everything so easily,

00:18:13.077 --> 00:18:16.095
they will never value their self-respect,

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:19.954
they will never value their Self Realization."

00:18:20.155 --> 00:18:24.345
I said, "It's not so. You have to give them a chance.

00:18:24.546 --> 00:18:28.212
You have to allow them to rise,

00:18:28.413 --> 00:18:33.579
and to allow them to become something.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.936
Like Mother Earth, what She does,

00:18:37.137 --> 00:18:41.923
She sprouts the seeds, then the trees come up.

00:18:42.124 --> 00:18:45.488
Then after that She gives them the fruits,

00:18:45.689 --> 00:18:50.597
and She sees that the fruits are ripened; all does She do."

00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:57.620
But he said, "But they are not trees, You see, they're human beings,

00:18:57.821 --> 00:19:02.229
and they have freedom to become devils also."

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.549
I said, "All right, if there are devils, I can manage them.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.346
You just see how I can manage them. And if they are devils

00:19:10.547 --> 00:19:14.494
they will remain devils, you cannot change them."

00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:16.885
So he argued with Me,

00:19:17.086 --> 00:19:19.354
and when he met Sahaja Yogis he asked them,

00:19:19.555 --> 00:19:23.893
"How many of you are willing to give life for Shri Mataji?

00:19:24.094 --> 00:19:28.838
Do you know what She has given you?" They said, "Yes, we do."

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:31.861
So they came to Me and told, "Mother,

00:19:32.062 --> 00:19:35.775
he wanted us to give life for You." I said,

00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:39.869
"There's no necessity, it's not necessary;

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.494
because he used to ask his disciples, perhaps."

00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:49.142
And then I met many like him who were very strict gurus,

00:19:49.343 --> 00:19:53.189
complete obedience was needed; complete humility,

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.306
complete surrender was needed.

00:19:55.507 --> 00:19:58.283
A word against the guru was not tolerated,

00:19:58.484 --> 00:20:00.650
but even you could not answer,

00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:05.158
you could not show any temper to a guru.

00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:09.252
Now I have met people who are like that sometimes,

00:20:09.453 --> 00:20:12.565
then I stopped talking to them, that's it.

00:20:12.766 --> 00:20:14.338
 If they want to improve, they can improve;

00:20:14.539 --> 00:20:18.401
they don't want to improve, you cannot force them to improve.

00:20:18.602 --> 00:20:20.846
But according to these gurus,

00:20:21.047 --> 00:20:22.047
there should be a great fear in their mind,

00:20:24.078 --> 00:20:26.533
that they should be so frightened

00:20:26.734 --> 00:20:32.038
that they should behave themselves.

00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:36.080
Now we expect so much from the guru,

00:20:36.281 --> 00:20:40.424
that he's your father, mother,

00:20:40.625 --> 00:20:44.487
he's a friend, everything to you.

00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:49.870
He is a pure person who just wants your ascent.

00:20:50.071 --> 00:20:53.386
He wants to look after you,

00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:57.980
he wants to guide you, wants to protect you,

00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:02.863
and takes you to the life of spirituality;

00:21:03.064 --> 00:21:06.738
and this is the way a guru has to work out.

00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:12.136
But what is expected of the disciples is even much worse.

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:19.991
The disciple has to be absolutely a pure person,

00:21:20.192 --> 00:21:27.085
he should have a pure desire to become a spiritual person.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.858
If he doesn't have this pure desire,

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:35.194
he has some other desires, then absolutely useless.

00:21:35.395 --> 00:21:38.686
Like some people come to Sahaja Yoga, I've seen it,

00:21:38.887 --> 00:21:41.561
they want to make a name out of themselves,

00:21:41.762 --> 00:21:44.842
they become great masters of everything,

00:21:45.043 --> 00:21:47.405
they want to dominate everything.

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:52.022
That is not, that is not important.

00:21:52.223 --> 00:21:55.085
There are some people who try to make money in Sahaja Yoga:

00:21:55.286 --> 00:21:57.866
a way of making money.

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:01.296
That also absolutely wrong; and not only that,

00:22:01.497 --> 00:22:03.405
but it's very low level,

00:22:03.606 --> 00:22:06.882
that you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:11.179
Then there are people who just come here for some politics.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.812
They go on saying things here and saying things there.

00:22:15.013 --> 00:22:19.820
All these things are not going to give you any ascent whatsoever.

00:22:20.021 --> 00:22:25.086
You have come here only to achieve a

00:22:25.287 --> 00:22:30.922
great life of spirituality, of becoming a guru.

00:22:31.123 --> 00:22:34.367
Now also this politics business is quite a lot,

00:22:34.568 --> 00:22:40.633
people try to enjoy the position of a leader,

00:22:40.834 --> 00:22:46.555
so they try to keep that position in a very special way.

00:22:46.756 --> 00:22:48.274
There's no need.

00:22:48.475 --> 00:22:54.672
If you are a leader because you are a great master,

00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:58.227
you will remain. Nobody can challenge you,

00:22:58.428 --> 00:23:01.726
nobody can dethrone you, and one should not get disturbed

00:23:01.927 --> 00:23:04.171
with any such fear.

00:23:04.372 --> 00:23:10.452
Sahaja Yoga is a yoga in which fear doesn't play any part;

00:23:10.653 --> 00:23:12.679
there's no fear, for you.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:18.593
Only thing for your ascent, it is necessary that you introspect.

00:23:18.794 --> 00:23:22.296
Try to find out, what have you been doing?

00:23:22.497 --> 00:23:28.896
Are you an, absolutely a humble person?

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:32.507
Do you do whatever is told to you?

00:23:32.708 --> 00:23:41.023
Supposing I tell somebody just go to, say, some place,

00:23:41.224 --> 00:23:43.523
he may not go. He'll come and tell Me,

00:23:43.724 --> 00:23:45.656
"Mother, You know, this happened, that happened" -

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:49.117
some excuse, he may not go.

00:23:49.318 --> 00:23:51.820
But that's not being good.

00:23:52.021 --> 00:23:54.325
If you have been told to go to that place,

00:23:54.526 --> 00:23:57.903
there must be some meaning and you have to go.

00:23:58.104 --> 00:24:01.247
You have to obey. If you are not obedient

00:24:01.448 --> 00:24:06.669
then you cannot become a guru, because if you cannot obey,

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:10.138
how can others obey you?

00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:13.763
This obedience is not for any personal gain of the guru,

00:24:13.964 --> 00:24:16.654
not at all, but for your gain only,

00:24:16.855 --> 00:24:20.396
for your education, for your ascent.

00:24:20.597 --> 00:24:25.529
So if such a view is taken then what happens,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:31.693
that you start getting all the qualities of a guru.

00:24:31.894 --> 00:24:35.170
Firstly, a guru cannot be fussy man,

00:24:35.371 --> 00:24:36.818
first and foremost thing.

00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:39.591
"I want this house, I want that thing;

00:24:39.792 --> 00:24:43.802
I can't like this, I can't like that."

00:24:44.003 --> 00:24:47.450
If a person who does not know

00:24:47.651 --> 00:24:51.161
how to get detached from all these habits,

00:24:51.362 --> 00:24:55.138
he cannot be a guru. How can he ascend?

00:24:55.339 --> 00:24:59.372
Of course, I mean, you have to try

00:24:59.573 --> 00:25:02.020
that you get rid of all these habits.

00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:05.708
They are funny habits which make you miserable;

00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:10.130
doesn't make miserable others, as it makes you miserable.

00:25:10.331 --> 00:25:14.927
No habit should cling to a guru.

00:25:15.128 --> 00:25:22.099
First and foremost is that he has to be beyond time.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.583
He should not worry about time.

00:25:26.784 --> 00:25:29.435
Many-a-times I have seen people,

00:25:29.636 --> 00:25:33.904
if they have to go to a airport, for example,

00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:35.763
something enters into their body,

00:25:35.964 --> 00:25:38.552
they become speedy suddenly, everybody.

00:25:38.753 --> 00:25:42.458
Even if I have to go, I'm going,

00:25:42.659 --> 00:25:44.989
then all of them will become speedy,

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:48.075
everybody starts running helter-skelter. Why?

00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:53.153
I am going, you are not going; but it happens.

00:25:53.354 --> 00:25:56.809
Like that, if you tell somebody you have to go to a function

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:01.551
or for some felicitation, people start jumping about,

00:26:01.752 --> 00:26:05.903
and that's a very modern disease, it was not before.

00:26:06.104 --> 00:26:11.973
So they start seeing that we are getting late, getting upset.

00:26:12.174 --> 00:26:16.762
But if you go on worrying like that, you don't go beyond time.

00:26:16.963 --> 00:26:20.871
And when you go beyond time, you control time,

00:26:21.072 --> 00:26:26.387
time is with you all the time. Whenever you go, it happens.

00:26:26.588 --> 00:26:29.051
I'll give an example of that.

00:26:29.252 --> 00:26:33.934
We had a little girl in Cabella who fell down

00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:36.934
and she broke her hand, very badly.

00:26:37.135 --> 00:26:39.576
I was about to leave for America, I was,

00:26:39.777 --> 00:26:42.045
actually I'd come out of My room.

00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:43.806
When I saw the child I said,

00:26:44.007 --> 00:26:48.876
"All right, doesn't matter. I'll cure this child first."

00:26:49.077 --> 00:26:50.751
They said, "No, Mother, but Your plane!"

00:26:50.952 --> 00:26:53.689
I said, "It's all right, forget it."

00:26:53.890 --> 00:27:00.736
So I got the child, treated the child, and she was all right.

00:27:00.937 --> 00:27:08.064
And after, I think, half-an-hour, I left, I left for the airport.

00:27:08.265 --> 00:27:10.642
And you'll be amazed to hear

00:27:10.843 --> 00:27:15.025
that that aeroplane was out of order,

00:27:15.226 --> 00:27:16.830
which was going to New York.

00:27:17.031 --> 00:27:20.619
So there's this plane is out of order. Then they said,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.846
"All right, You can go by another plane which goes to Washington,

00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:28.885
with the same ticket." I said, "Very good idea, give Me that,"

00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:31.815
and I went by that. So that I reached Washington,

00:27:32.016 --> 00:27:36.292
which is a very, very nice airport to arrive,

00:27:36.493 --> 00:27:40.526
because there's no problem of customs,

00:27:40.727 --> 00:27:42.799
there's no crowd, nothing.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.877
All people go to New York, I don't know why.

00:27:46.078 --> 00:27:49.393
They should all go to Washington, it's very surprising.

00:27:49.594 --> 00:27:54.573
I discovered for Myself, that I wished I had not gone

00:27:54.774 --> 00:27:59.237
by that horrible plane to go to New York.

00:27:59.438 --> 00:28:02.550
Like that everything works out.

00:28:02.751 --> 00:28:08.448
And the time comes what is good for you.

00:28:08.649 --> 00:28:13.136
It is such a lot of experience of Mine which I can tell you,

00:28:13.337 --> 00:28:18.222
that to worry about time itself is a headache.

00:28:18.423 --> 00:28:23.300
 If you leave it to this divine power and believe in it,

00:28:23.501 --> 00:28:27.300
then everything works out for your good.

00:28:27.501 --> 00:28:36.209
And if it does not, you must know that it is your destiny,

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:40.451
you must accept, you must learn to accept.

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:42.904
Because whatever you have fixed up yourself

00:28:43.105 --> 00:28:47.029
as something very great, is not.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:50.513
So what is the greatest thing you have to achieve? -

00:28:50.714 --> 00:28:52.911
your detachment.

00:28:53.112 --> 00:28:55.583
Then you become gunateet:

00:28:55.784 --> 00:28:59.739
means, as you know, we have three gunas within us.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:07.422
One is, they call is as sattwa guna, is the best.

00:29:07.735 --> 00:29:11.839
But there are two other gunas which are, as you know,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.089
the left side and right side.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.597
Either you are a right-sided person or a left-sided person.

00:29:19.798 --> 00:29:26.894
These two gunas within us are of no importance.

00:29:27.095 --> 00:29:29.871
Supposing you are a right-sided person,

00:29:30.072 --> 00:29:35.269
then what happens to you? You become over-active.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.972
Over- activity gives you fatigue,

00:29:38.173 --> 00:29:41.480
gives you all kinds of diseases which you have seen,

00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:44.043
and you have to cure right side.

00:29:44.244 --> 00:29:46.848
Such a person is extremely speedy,

00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:49.739
he cannot sit in one place for two minutes,

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.372
all the time jumping,

00:29:52.573 --> 00:29:57.036
and he creates problems for himself and his family.

00:29:57.237 --> 00:30:02.028
Then the left-sided person,

00:30:02.229 --> 00:30:05.708
which we call as the tamo guna -

00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:08.311
the right-sided is rajo guna, and the left-sided

00:30:08.512 --> 00:30:14.209
is the one which is tamo guna -

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:19.959
"tamo" means darkness, such a man is afraid of darkness,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.326
darkness, everything he is afraid of.

00:30:23.527 --> 00:30:31.473
But he becomes a very intriguingly, very crooked person.

00:30:31.674 --> 00:30:36.528
He always tries to trouble people in a very crooked manner,

00:30:36.729 --> 00:30:41.536
not openly, while the right-sided man is openly a Hitler.

00:30:41.737 --> 00:30:46.403
But this one, the second one, the one who is called as tamo guni,

00:30:46.604 --> 00:30:51.294
is the one tries to trouble others very much.

00:30:51.495 --> 00:30:56.552
Rajo guni has a opinion of his own about everything.

00:30:56.753 --> 00:31:00.068
When he is so much having his own opinion,

00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:03.779
he goes on forcing it on to other persons.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.271
But if you see his own life, he is in complete misery.

00:31:08.472 --> 00:31:12.638
He cannot carry on with people, he cannot talk to people,

00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:17.255
and there's a very big gap between himself,

00:31:17.456 --> 00:31:20.638
his Spirit and his being.

00:31:20.839 --> 00:31:23.810
The second type, the tamo gunis, are the ones

00:31:24.011 --> 00:31:27.162
who end up with all kinds of diseases.

00:31:27.363 --> 00:31:30.904
Even the right-sided people get lots of diseases.

00:31:31.105 --> 00:31:34.748
But the left ones get it psychosomatic.

00:31:34.949 --> 00:31:38.131
Psychosomatic diseases are very dangerous

00:31:38.332 --> 00:31:41.787
and not curable by human doctors.

00:31:41.988 --> 00:31:44.037
So you have to take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:44.238 --> 00:31:46.685
But again you go to the right or to the left,

00:31:46.886 --> 00:31:52.701
again right, to the left. This is not a very good attitude,

00:31:52.902 --> 00:31:58.373
I think, towards life that you get bound by one of these gunas,

00:31:58.574 --> 00:32:01.517
or you are all the time like a pendulum

00:32:01.718 --> 00:32:04.517
moving from left to right, right to left.

00:32:04.718 --> 00:32:07.439
So you have to be a steady person.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.384
For that, you all have to meditate.

00:32:11.585 --> 00:32:13.947
I know immediately a person who meditates,

00:32:14.148 --> 00:32:17.236
and I know who does not meditate.

00:32:17.437 --> 00:32:20.431
You will yourself know a person who meditates.

00:32:20.632 --> 00:32:23.579
It's a question of ten, fifteen minutes,

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.884
but that you must do every night and morning,

00:32:27.085 --> 00:32:32.243
about five minutes' meditation; then you develop your balance,

00:32:32.444 --> 00:32:38.585
you develop your tenacity, you develop your own body

00:32:38.786 --> 00:32:42.796
in such a manner that it can stand lots of nonsense,

00:32:42.997 --> 00:32:48.054
it can bear lots of things. You don't have then desires left -

00:32:48.255 --> 00:32:52.367
what food you should eat, when you should eat,

00:32:52.568 --> 00:32:56.312
whom you should please - nothing of the kind.

00:32:56.513 --> 00:32:59.468
You yourself become such a sweet person

00:32:59.669 --> 00:33:03.827
that everybody is pleased, and understand that

00:33:04.028 --> 00:33:09.647
one has to be like you.

00:33:09.848 --> 00:33:13.131
The people see you and you become like a model.

00:33:13.332 --> 00:33:17.709
People start following you, that means you become a guru.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:22.178
In this way you get rid of these two habits that you have,

00:33:22.379 --> 00:33:26.194
of left and right side. Now sattwa gunis are the people

00:33:26.395 --> 00:33:32.038
who believe in the righteousness, but when they are righteous,

00:33:32.239 --> 00:33:36.265
they have contempt for others who are not righteous.

00:33:36.466 --> 00:33:38.992
They go on saying things to such people,

00:33:39.193 --> 00:33:42.320
so they can develop a kind of a temperament

00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:46.406
so they become aloof. They can go to Himalayas,

00:33:46.607 --> 00:33:50.937
sit there and not to meet anybody; get out of the society,

00:33:51.138 --> 00:33:53.609
get out of all your relations, everyone,

00:33:53.810 --> 00:34:00.398
and just establish yourself as a big guru somewhere.

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:03.789
This kind of also another generation is there,

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:09.844
which is of no use. I met some of them when I was in Hardwar.

00:34:10.045 --> 00:34:13.117
And I told them, "What are you doing here in the Himalayas?"

00:34:13.318 --> 00:34:15.437
They said, "We don't want to face human beings.

00:34:15.638 --> 00:34:18.414
They're useless people, they're good for nothing.

00:34:18.615 --> 00:34:21.673
You do anything for them, they go on troubling you.

00:34:21.874 --> 00:34:25.321
We don't want to be there." So I said, "Why have you become guru?

00:34:25.522 --> 00:34:30.227
If you cannot manage them, if you cannot

00:34:30.428 --> 00:34:32.969
get out of the troubles they are giving you

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.055
and out of all those things, and remain in your peace,

00:34:37.256 --> 00:34:39.461
then what's the use of becoming this?"

00:34:39.662 --> 00:34:41.523
He said, "We have had enough of it."

00:34:41.724 --> 00:34:45.273
Some of them were over hundred years of age and all that,

00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:48.464
but I said, "What's the use? Your life is of no use,

00:34:48.665 --> 00:34:51.816
you are staying here alone somewhere in the jungles."

00:34:52.017 --> 00:34:56.332
He said, "The tigers, the snakes, all of them know us,

00:34:56.533 --> 00:34:59.207
that we are great; they don't trouble us.

00:34:59.408 --> 00:35:01.629
But these human beings are troubling.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:05.676
If we go down, they'll trouble us and torture us.

00:35:05.877 --> 00:35:09.285
We don't want to go there because they're very ambitious,

00:35:09.486 --> 00:35:12.808
or they are very negative.

00:35:13.009 --> 00:35:15.113
Something is wrong with the human beings,

00:35:15.314 --> 00:35:18.761
none of them have reached a perfect state."

00:35:18.962 --> 00:35:21.112
So that all that, I was surprised

00:35:21.313 --> 00:35:26.034
how they are not at all willing to come down and be with us,

00:35:26.235 --> 00:35:29.440
and be a part and parcel of us.

00:35:29.641 --> 00:35:33.182
So they said, "All right, Mother, You have come. You are a Mother,

00:35:33.383 --> 00:35:37.276
You can tolerate all this and You can work it out, but not me.

00:35:37.477 --> 00:35:40.120
We are out of it, we don't want to go back."

00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:43.761
They have lots of powers. They can control the nature,

00:35:43.962 --> 00:35:46.054
they can do so many things. But they said,

00:35:46.255 --> 00:35:51.269
"Easy to control even a snake than to control a human being.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.082
Today they might behave in a particular manner,

00:35:54.283 --> 00:35:56.059
suddenly they will become horrible.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.278
You don't know these human beings how uncertain they are,

00:35:59.479 --> 00:36:01.622
what uncertain quantity they are."

00:36:01.823 --> 00:36:05.833
I said, "There is a way of putting them right.

00:36:06.034 --> 00:36:10.153
You first give them Realization. In the light of their Spirit

00:36:10.354 --> 00:36:13.637
they can see how they are doing wrong things.

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:18.434
Ninety-nine percent people will know what's going wrong with them,

00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:21.442
where are they missing the point.

00:36:21.643 --> 00:36:24.083
They will start seeing themselves.

00:36:24.284 --> 00:36:28.278
Spirit is like a mirror where you see yourself clearly,

00:36:28.479 --> 00:36:30.505
and you start changing yourself.

00:36:30.706 --> 00:36:34.013
There's no introspection actually needed then,

00:36:34.214 --> 00:36:38.490
when you have your Spirit awakened. You can watch yourself,

00:36:38.691 --> 00:36:41.865
you can see for yourself clearly,

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:44.904
as soon as

00:36:45.105 --> 00:36:52.217
you become a developed or evolved Sahaja Yogi."

00:36:52.418 --> 00:36:56.108
And that is one point one should see,

00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:59.085
if it has happened to you.

00:36:59.286 --> 00:37:02.733
If you can see something wrong with you,

00:37:02.934 --> 00:37:11.250
if you can find out what sort of defects you have,

00:37:11.451 --> 00:37:16.484
if you can detach yourself from those defects,

00:37:16.685 --> 00:37:19.453
and if you can understand

00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:23.344
that all these attachments and defects and habits

00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:28.946
are pulling you down, then only you can leave them.

00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:31.454
But that only happens when you have

00:37:31.655 --> 00:37:36.009
this mirror of your Self shining through.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.978
When this light comes to you, you see for yourself

00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:43.666
what is wrong with you,

00:37:43.867 --> 00:37:46.213
what is the wrong path you are taking.

00:37:46.414 --> 00:37:50.713
Overnight you have seen people have given up so many things.

00:37:50.914 --> 00:37:54.921
Many gross things they give up, but still there are many,

00:37:55.122 --> 00:37:58.812
I should say, subtle things, which stick on to them.

00:37:59.013 --> 00:38:03.203
First thing that happens to you is that you start finding

00:38:03.404 --> 00:38:11.193
what's wrong with your own people of your own nation.

00:38:11.482 --> 00:38:15.242
I'm amazed, you see, when the English got Realization,

00:38:15.443 --> 00:38:17.742
they started telling Me about the English.

00:38:17.943 --> 00:38:20.094
When Italians got Realization,

00:38:20.295 --> 00:38:23.563
they started telling Me about the Italians.

00:38:23.764 --> 00:38:27.844
If you tell the Italians that "You see, this Italian fellow did this like that,"

00:38:28.045 --> 00:38:30.875
he said, "Italians after all, Mother, what will they do?

00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:34.328
They're just like this, You know." He himself is an Italian,

00:38:34.529 --> 00:38:37.837
but immediately he'll say. Same with the Russians, I have seen,

00:38:38.038 --> 00:38:41.915
it's very surprising that they start telling you

00:38:42.116 --> 00:38:45.845
about what's wrong with the Russians or with the Ukrainians,

00:38:46.046 --> 00:38:49.472
all of them are quite alike. Even Indians, they'll say,

00:38:49.673 --> 00:38:53.120
"After all this is Indian. You know Indian people how they are,

00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:57.265
Mother; they are doing like this." I was surprised that

00:38:57.469 --> 00:38:58.721
they themselves being Indians,

00:38:58.922 --> 00:39:02.565
how are they immediately telling Me about the Indians?

00:39:02.766 --> 00:39:06.331
And many things I have come to know about these countries

00:39:06.532 --> 00:39:09.761
through the, actually through the Sahaja Yogis only.

00:39:09.962 --> 00:39:13.014
When the Sahaja Yogis tell Me, I'm amazed

00:39:13.215 --> 00:39:15.811
that they are not identified with their country,

00:39:16.012 --> 00:39:18.092
they are not identified with anyone,

00:39:18.293 --> 00:39:20.936
even their own family they are not identified with.

00:39:21.137 --> 00:39:23.405
If they find something wrong, they'll tell Me,

00:39:23.606 --> 00:39:27.608
"Mother, my father is like that, my mother is like that."

00:39:27.809 --> 00:39:29.897
That is how you get detached,

00:39:30.098 --> 00:39:32.897
when you start seeing and not identified.

00:39:33.098 --> 00:39:36.811
If you are not identified with all these things,

00:39:37.012 --> 00:39:41.772
then you become a free person, you have the freedom.

00:39:41.973 --> 00:39:45.819
You become a person who is not attached to anyone

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:50.350
because he's your father or she's your mother,

00:39:50.551 --> 00:39:52.756
or a sister or anyone.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:57.381
This attachment is a very dangerous one also.

00:39:57.582 --> 00:40:02.115
With the family attachment, we have lost many Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:05.295
Because their family was funny, they got lost;

00:40:05.496 --> 00:40:07.240
they couldn't get out of it.

00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:11.803
We don't say that you detach yourself from family or get out of it,

00:40:12.004 --> 00:40:15.639
but in a subtle way you should understand what are they up to,

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.127
and what they are doing. All these subtle understanding

00:40:20.328 --> 00:40:25.557
about everyone doesn't give you any right also to criticize them.

00:40:25.758 --> 00:40:29.370
You should see for yourself what's wrong with you.

00:40:29.571 --> 00:40:31.892
You know all these subtleties you criticize,

00:40:32.093 --> 00:40:34.712
that such a person is such, such a person is such,

00:40:34.913 --> 00:40:38.915
but you also have the same problems with you.

00:40:39.116 --> 00:40:43.837
That's why you get detachment only possibly,

00:40:44.038 --> 00:40:48.900
through this introspection through the mirror of your Spirit.

00:40:49.101 --> 00:40:53.970
So the spiritual life is very important to a person

00:40:54.171 --> 00:40:57.486
than anything else on this earth,

00:40:57.687 --> 00:41:00.377
because such a person has been seeking,

00:41:00.578 --> 00:41:04.596
he has been seeking the truth, he has been seeking the reality.

00:41:04.797 --> 00:41:08.519
And once you know the reality, you don't want to cling onto

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.800
something which is not reality.

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:16.558
You want to be a person who is above all these things,

00:41:16.759 --> 00:41:18.535
that you can see all these things.

00:41:18.736 --> 00:41:20.816
And that is how you can save others

00:41:21.017 --> 00:41:27.886
who are getting drowned into the ocean of darkness,

00:41:28.087 --> 00:41:32.199
into the ocean of misidentification,

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.129
only when you are above these things.

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:40.316
But mostly what happens is this, that you are identified,

00:41:40.517 --> 00:41:44.698
you are identified, "How can I do it? How can I say?"

00:41:44.899 --> 00:41:48.003
The countries where Sahaja Yoga has spread,

00:41:48.204 --> 00:41:52.355
where there have been people who are not identified with those countries,

00:41:52.556 --> 00:41:55.175
and think that they have to help

00:41:55.376 --> 00:41:59.847
all these countrymen to come up, to join them.

00:42:00.048 --> 00:42:05.199
For that, tremendous patience and love is necessary.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.983
As you know this cosmic power, as they call it,

00:42:09.184 --> 00:42:13.866
which they say I'm the source: actually, it is the power of love,

00:42:14.067 --> 00:42:17.546
of divine love, of pure love.

00:42:17.747 --> 00:42:22.296
And such a love doesn't demand anything, doesn't want anything,

00:42:22.497 --> 00:42:25.015
but it acts, it works.

00:42:25.216 --> 00:42:28.351
For example, if you love somebody, you would not like to do

00:42:28.552 --> 00:42:32.289
something to displease that person.

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:34.477
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:42:34.678 --> 00:42:38.485
who do things which I really don't like,

00:42:38.686 --> 00:42:42.610
but I never show, I just keep quiet.

00:42:42.811 --> 00:42:46.516
But normally if a person has love for someone,

00:42:46.717 --> 00:42:50.086
he wouldn't do anything to displease

00:42:50.287 --> 00:42:54.703
or to trouble that person, or in any way hurt.

00:42:54.904 --> 00:42:57.555
Without that development within you,

00:42:57.756 --> 00:43:01.078
you cannot become collective.

00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:06.484
In collectivity what happens that you feel for others,

00:43:06.685 --> 00:43:09.547
you understand others. You may not show off,

00:43:09.748 --> 00:43:12.399
but you do, inside yourself you know.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.688
Supposing somebody has done lots of funny things with you,

00:43:15.889 --> 00:43:20.735
doesn't matter. But gradually you will see he will change,

00:43:20.936 --> 00:43:25.251
gradually he will become better, because he'll realize that

00:43:25.452 --> 00:43:30.212
whatever he has been doing has not been a correct thing to do.

00:43:30.413 --> 00:43:34.228
He will not only feel guilty, that's not the way, but he will say,

00:43:34.429 --> 00:43:38.478
"I should correct. Why did I do like this? I should not have done."

00:43:38.679 --> 00:43:42.314
Gradually he will improve, but for that you should have

00:43:42.515 --> 00:43:45.923
a great sense of forgiveness,

00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:48.775
great sense of understanding.

00:43:48.976 --> 00:43:52.283
Under circumstances, people also misbehave.

00:43:52.484 --> 00:43:56.260
Because they've had no training how to be all right,

00:43:56.461 --> 00:43:58.908
how to be humble, they misbehave.

00:43:59.109 --> 00:44:03.791
Because in their culture perhaps, there is nothing but just anger,

00:44:03.992 --> 00:44:06.471
and arrogance is regarded as something great,

00:44:06.672 --> 00:44:10.401
also they misbehave. Sometimes they come from such families

00:44:10.602 --> 00:44:14.948
where only arrogance is taught, so you can't help it.

00:44:15.149 --> 00:44:19.167
Such people are to be forgiven again and again,

00:44:19.368 --> 00:44:21.339
and see that they change.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.487
Because I have a faith that all human beings

00:44:26.688 --> 00:44:30.690
can be made into beautiful flowers of fragrance -

00:44:30.891 --> 00:44:36.198
all the human beings. But I know there are some difficult ones.

00:44:36.399 --> 00:44:39.919
Why? Because they don't want. If they don't want,

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.708
if they don't have the pure desire, you cannot force it on them.

00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:48.396
So forget it, they are difficult people, forget about them.

00:44:48.597 --> 00:44:55.763
But those who want, those who have a great desire

00:44:55.964 --> 00:44:58.896
which is absolutely pure desire -

00:44:59.097 --> 00:45:03.880
not for money, not for position, not for anything else,

00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:10.177
but for achieving a great state of spirituality -

00:45:10.378 --> 00:45:13.974
such people are to be helped at any cost.

00:45:14.175 --> 00:45:18.326
I know some of them have gone to very wrong gurus and they have suffered;

00:45:18.527 --> 00:45:21.646
they have a bad Agnya, they have all kinds of things.

00:45:21.847 --> 00:45:24.755
Doesn't matter, you should try to help them.

00:45:24.956 --> 00:45:27.424
If they can listen to you, if they can understand

00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:31.018
what you are telling them, I'm sure it will work out.

00:45:31.219 --> 00:45:34.237
It is worked out so much, as you can see now

00:45:34.438 --> 00:45:38.964
that in the foreign countries where I was just an Indian,

00:45:39.165 --> 00:45:43.300
how people have taken to it; how they have understood Me,

00:45:43.501 --> 00:45:46.191
and how they have become Sahaja Yogis

00:45:46.392 --> 00:45:48.925
of such a great value and level.

00:45:49.126 --> 00:45:53.245
We never had so many saints in the olden days, never.

00:45:53.446 --> 00:45:58.073
Only one saint would be born and he would be tortured.

00:45:58.274 --> 00:46:00.675
There were not so many to help each other

00:46:00.876 --> 00:46:02.933
and to protect each other.

00:46:03.134 --> 00:46:06.933
So collectivity is to be learned very well:

00:46:07.134 --> 00:46:11.191
how to be collective, how to be nice to each other;

00:46:11.392 --> 00:46:14.355
because later on when you become the guru,

00:46:14.556 --> 00:46:18.894
when you have to guide the people,

00:46:19.095 --> 00:46:22.269
you will know what are the problems of the collectivity are.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:26.816
Also you will know how to overcome that,

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:30.285
how to make collectivity perfect.

00:46:30.486 --> 00:46:34.269
And once you learn that thing, you'll be amazed

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:40.011
that you have mastered the art of being a guru.

00:46:40.212 --> 00:46:45.308
I would like to see so many of you becoming a real guru,

00:46:45.509 --> 00:46:50.808
real masters; not only in your jobs, in your talents,

00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:55.347
but in your own life.

00:46:55.548 --> 00:46:59.972
People should say that such and such person is a real guru.

00:47:00.173 --> 00:47:04.222
For that, as I said, you must learn obedience,

00:47:04.423 --> 00:47:08.855
complete obedience. You should not question the guru.

00:47:09.056 --> 00:47:10.621
Whatever is told to you, you must do;

00:47:10.822 --> 00:47:13.004
though in Sahaja Yoga I do not say that.

00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:15.254
Today is the first time I am saying it,

00:47:15.455 --> 00:47:18.457
because I find so many of you

00:47:18.658 --> 00:47:22.027
fall a little short of becoming perfect.

00:47:22.228 --> 00:47:25.066
You don't have to sacrifice anything, I have told you,

00:47:25.267 --> 00:47:27.550
you don't have to give up anything.

00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:31.238
You don't have to give up your families or anything,

00:47:31.439 --> 00:47:35.332
and do odd things just to show that you are perfect.

00:47:35.533 --> 00:47:37.746
But it's something, a state within yourself

00:47:37.947 --> 00:47:41.949
which you have to establish, where you become extremely humble,

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:46.691
obedient, and you'll be glowing with this light, I am sure.

00:47:46.892 --> 00:47:51.730
Once you understand the importance, then

00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:55.243
you will dedicate yourself to become

00:47:55.444 --> 00:47:59.056
a personality of a real quality.

00:47:59.257 --> 00:48:01.884
It's very difficult, as people something say,

00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:04.251
but I think the easiest thing to be,

00:48:04.452 --> 00:48:09.329
because that's the most comfortable way of living in life -

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:13.720
no use fighting, no use quarreling, nobody trying to show off,

00:48:13.921 --> 00:48:18.611
and all that. The care of everyone,

00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:21.361
the suggestion of care,

00:48:21.562 --> 00:48:26.509
 is very much satisfying for others.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.704
A little care here and there, people like it.

00:48:29.905 --> 00:48:33.196
And that only comes from a very noble soul

00:48:33.397 --> 00:48:36.079
who bothers about small, small things,

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.821
about whatever others need. It's not for your own advancement,

00:48:41.022 --> 00:48:45.876
it's not for your own sort of leadership, whatever you may call,

00:48:46.077 --> 00:48:51.243
or for your own positions - then you are falling short -

00:48:51.444 --> 00:48:54.501
but it's for your own ascent,

00:48:54.702 --> 00:49:01.181
for your higher life that you give up

00:49:01.382 --> 00:49:06.931
all these ideas of leadership and this and that.

00:49:07.132 --> 00:49:13.040
Is absurd the way sometimes I find some Sahaja Yogis

00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:21.283
are so anxious to assert themselves as leaders; it's not correct.

00:49:21.736 --> 00:49:24.691
So many times I have explained to you

00:49:24.892 --> 00:49:29.537
that your own development, your own correction,

00:49:29.738 --> 00:49:36.873
your own position in Sahaja Yoga will say what you are.

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:39.045
Whatever others may say doesn't matter.

00:49:39.246 --> 00:49:44.256
What you say about yourself truly, truthfully, is the reality,

00:49:44.457 --> 00:49:46.904
and you must face yourself all the time.

00:49:47.105 --> 00:49:49.256
I would say, specially for the ladies,

00:49:49.457 --> 00:49:55.084
that I'm a woman and I have worked very hard all these years,

00:49:55.285 --> 00:50:02.279
and as a woman I must tell you that all the ladies should try;

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.115
because they always say "We are shaktis,"

00:50:06.316 --> 00:50:10.076
but in their life I don't see there's any work done as shaktis,

00:50:10.277 --> 00:50:14.670
only their sort of dependence all the time on Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:14.871 --> 00:50:17.928
They have to stand up in their own freedom,

00:50:18.129 --> 00:50:19.576
they have to be independent,

00:50:19.777 --> 00:50:24.201
and they should have right ideas about everything.

00:50:24.402 --> 00:50:27.506
I'm sure if the ladies come up that way,

00:50:27.707 --> 00:50:30.733
Sahaja Yoga will spread very much.

00:50:30.934 --> 00:50:34.577
Men are working much more for Sahaja Yoga than women are.

00:50:34.778 --> 00:50:36.882
I can understand because they have families,

00:50:37.083 --> 00:50:39.195
they have children, this thing.

00:50:39.396 --> 00:50:41.359
But the most important thing is that

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.750
once you take to active Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:44.951 --> 00:50:47.039
then your children also come up well,

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.180
the family is also looked after.

00:50:49.381 --> 00:50:55.118
After all, there is this divine power which looks after all of you.

00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:59.602
You must believe that this pure divine power thinks,

00:50:59.803 --> 00:51:05.836
understands, it organizes; above all, it loves you.

00:51:06.037 --> 00:51:09.992
This divine power has to be understood that

00:51:10.193 --> 00:51:14.015
it is now your own

00:51:14.216 --> 00:51:17.335
and that you are in the realm of this divine power,

00:51:17.536 --> 00:51:20.655
where you won't have any problems whatsoever.

00:51:20.856 --> 00:51:25.866
If you leave things to the divine power, it will all work out.

00:51:26.067 --> 00:51:29.616
As you know about this scientist who found out about Me.

00:51:29.817 --> 00:51:34.366
I have to just say that he asked Me that

00:51:34.567 --> 00:51:39.257
"How is it this so many hearts are made here?"

00:51:39.458 --> 00:51:42.195
I said, "It's people who are singing the song,

00:51:42.396 --> 00:51:44.586
'Sitting in the Heart of the Universe.'

00:51:44.787 --> 00:51:47.367
So this many hearts have come up."

00:51:47.568 --> 00:51:51.594
But he said, "Still, does this power hear?"

00:51:51.795 --> 00:51:56.469
I said, "No, it's Me only, I can hear.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:52:02.852
I was hearing the song, and then the power organizes everything."

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:05.469
It's something to be understood very well

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:11.594
that the power within you, what you have, understands,

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:14.758
and understand you also.

00:52:14.959 --> 00:52:20.227
It is a way of power which is your own power,

00:52:20.428 --> 00:52:24.319
but you cannot control it.

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:28.203
It knows about you. Whenever you are falling,

00:52:28.404 --> 00:52:31.516
when you are doing wrong, the same power which protects you

00:52:31.717 --> 00:52:33.657
and loves you like a mother,

00:52:33.858 --> 00:52:38.133
will correct you and bring you to the right path.

00:52:38.334 --> 00:52:42.094
I think now a new century is starting

00:52:42.295 --> 00:52:44.352
and so many things have to happen,

00:52:44.553 --> 00:52:48.961
and all of you must decide that you'll do this or that.

00:52:49.162 --> 00:52:55.180
Whatever is your understanding is about spreading Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:55.381 --> 00:52:59.266
you should try to; all of you should put your mind to it.

00:52:59.467 --> 00:53:03.352
If women can't go out they can write down something,

00:53:03.553 --> 00:53:07.524
they can write about their spiritual ascent

00:53:07.725 --> 00:53:12.540
or about whatever their experiences are.

00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:15.633
So in any case all those who have got also

00:53:15.834 --> 00:53:19.711
very miraculous photographs, they should send it over here.

00:53:19.912 --> 00:53:23.633
Very important is, because this gentleman is coming here in September,

00:53:23.834 --> 00:53:26.125
 and he's going to analyze all of them.

00:53:26.326 --> 00:53:28.914
So it would be very nice of you if you can send it.

00:53:29.115 --> 00:53:34.881
Also you write down about your different experiences

00:53:35.082 --> 00:53:38.654
you have had in Sahaja Yoga: that would be also a good idea.

00:53:38.855 --> 00:53:42.482
He told Me that he would like to publish a book like that;

00:53:42.683 --> 00:53:45.927
and now the time has come for us to publish

00:53:46.128 --> 00:53:49.208
our miracles that have taken place.

00:53:49.409 --> 00:53:52.364
All of you have had some experience of the miracle.

00:53:52.565 --> 00:53:56.309
So I have to request you to send you, as soon as possible,

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:01.340
written well in English language or in Hindi language or Marathi,

00:54:01.541 --> 00:54:04.121
because I don't understand other languages.

00:54:04.322 --> 00:54:06.309
And please don't send Me in other languages,

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:09.957
we'll have to appoint somebody to translate them in fourteen languages,

00:54:10.158 --> 00:54:14.520
it's a difficult thing. So I would request you to send that.

00:54:14.721 --> 00:54:18.012
I am sure today's lecture, you will again go through it

00:54:18.213 --> 00:54:20.996
and understand it, and work it out.

00:54:21.197 --> 00:54:25.900
May God bless you.
