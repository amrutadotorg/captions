00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.625
Today we have

00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:38.583
had to spend a little more time than normal

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.583
to get to the stage

00:20:42.125 --> 00:20:47.375
where we could really worship the Guru.

00:20:53.041 --> 00:20:57.333
When we worship our Guru,

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:02.291
we have to know actually

00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:05.041
we are trying to awaken

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:09.083
the Guru Principle within ourselves.

00:21:11.583 --> 00:21:16.041
It’s not only that you are here to worship your Guru.

00:21:17.041 --> 00:21:20.125
You may worship

00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:23.417
many-a-times,

00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:28.041
maybe the vibrations would flow,

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:33.709
Maybe that you might get filled with that

00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:38.166
and you feel

00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:44.625
elevated, nourished.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.291
But this nourishment

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:52.625
has to be retained within ourselves,

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:58.250
So always remember then,

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:03.250
whenever you are worshipping

00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:07.333
any principle

00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:11.291
outside, you are trying

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:16.500
to worship your own principle within yourself.

00:22:21.417 --> 00:22:26.291
Within us as you know, in all of us

00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:31.125
there lies the principle of Guru.

00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:38.667
It’s very interesting to notice

00:22:41.333 --> 00:22:46.041
the Guru Principle being drawn

00:22:46.709 --> 00:22:50.500
beautifully round the Nabhi Chakra.

00:22:51.709 --> 00:22:57.375
We never see any chakras connected with the Guru Principle.

00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:04.709
You see Nabhi, and around is the Bhavasagara.

00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:11.542
So this Bhavasagara

00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:17.333
which is the Ocean of Illusion cannot be the Guru.

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:24.458
So there are

00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:31.709
hidden chakras within this Bhavasagara

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.709
within us, which are

00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:40.000
to be awakened

00:23:40.542 --> 00:23:44.291
and to be brought to light,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.166
to be manifested.

00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:56.709
As you can see that

00:23:58.083 --> 00:24:03.667
the limits of this principle

00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:08.542
are done by the movement

00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.291
of the Swadisthana Chakra.

00:24:14.083 --> 00:24:16.375
Swadisthan is the chakra

00:24:16.583 --> 00:24:21.333
which gives you, first and foremost thing, is

00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:26.667
the creativity.

00:24:29.041 --> 00:24:32.333
A person who is a guru

00:24:33.125 --> 00:24:36.250
has to be creative by nature.

00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:42.250
If you are not a creative person

00:24:42.625 --> 00:24:45.583
you cannot become a guru.

00:24:47.709 --> 00:24:50.250
For example,

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.458
you are faced with disciples

00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:04.125
with whom you have to converse.

00:25:05.583 --> 00:25:09.000
You have to create

00:25:09.583 --> 00:25:13.709
a word of divine magic

00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:20.375
to impress on the disciples

00:25:20.709 --> 00:25:25.417
or the people who are attracted towards you as gurus,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.041
to show that

00:25:31.709 --> 00:25:37.125
you have much more divine magic than them.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.542
If you are a very mundane type of a person,

00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:46.583
very ordinary,

00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:49.542
cannot create

00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:56.291
a beautiful couplet or a beautiful sentence,

00:25:58.208 --> 00:26:01.667
or a humor or a joke,

00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:09.375
or a beautiful painting

00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:16.000
or a beautiful tapestry

00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:18.709
or a beautiful house;

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.625
if you lack in creativity

00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:25.417
you will lack in your Guru Principle,

00:26:25.709 --> 00:26:28.583
because a guru has to create

00:26:29.083 --> 00:26:32.166
out of ordinary people

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.250
something extraordinary.

00:26:40.583 --> 00:26:44.500
He should be able to create

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:52.542
a new personality out of

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.125
personality which is decaying.

00:27:07.083 --> 00:27:13.000
So the first principle you have to understand within yourself,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.583
that you should be able to create

00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:20.625
a new personality in a person.

00:27:26.208 --> 00:27:29.041
So how do we do it?

00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:34.166
Of course you have got powers to raise the Kundalini,

00:27:34.417 --> 00:27:39.709
you have got powers to cure people,

00:27:40.709 --> 00:27:45.333
you have got powers to talk big or talk small.

00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:49.709
Despite all that,

00:27:50.417 --> 00:27:54.417
if you cannot create a new personality

00:27:55.041 --> 00:27:58.375
out of the persons with whom you are dealing,

00:27:58.583 --> 00:28:01.500
then you are not a guru.

00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:05.333
And the new personality has to be

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:10.125
a special personality of very unique

00:28:10.583 --> 00:28:15.709
combination of compassion and dynamism.

00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:23.542
So it is important

00:28:25.166 --> 00:28:30.125
that in your creativity

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:36.709
you have to use the energy of compassion.

00:28:38.375 --> 00:28:42.083
You can only mold people through compassion

00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:45.500
and never through anger,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.500
never through suppression,

00:28:49.125 --> 00:28:51.625
never through showing off

00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:54.709
your powers of gurudom.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.083
Unless and until you handle the situation

00:29:02.583 --> 00:29:06.083
and the personality very carefully,

00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:11.375
showing all the respect,

00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:14.500
showing all the concern

00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:17.542
and all the love

00:29:18.166 --> 00:29:21.542
for the person whom you are giving realization.

00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:26.000
Just showing off that you are a great guru,

00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:30.041
it will only create a kind of a fear about you,

00:29:30.291 --> 00:29:34.542
and after some time people would not like to see your faces.

00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:44.208
So the most important thing about

00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:50.709
Guru Principle is that you have to create.

00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:56.333
Many people get realization, all right,

00:29:57.083 --> 00:29:59.208
they get realization

00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:02.333
and then they stay in some ashrams maybe.

00:30:03.375 --> 00:30:05.709
They come to pujas,

00:30:08.083 --> 00:30:12.041
they listen to music, they may dance,

00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:15.041
they laugh, they’re collective,

00:30:15.333 --> 00:30:19.208
but still their Guru Principle is not awakened

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:22.458
unless and until they have created

00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:27.250
many, many more Sahaja yogis, Sahaja yogis.

00:30:31.417 --> 00:30:34.625
So the vision of a guru should be,

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:39.041
“How many Sahaja yogis I am going to create?

00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:43.250
How am I going to use this creativity

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.625
to create more Sahaja yogis?”

00:30:49.208 --> 00:30:54.417
So the basis or the essence of the Swadisthana Chakra,

00:30:54.667 --> 00:30:57.291
though is aesthetics,

00:30:58.166 --> 00:31:01.625
the force and the energy of Swadisthana Chakra

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:04.333
is attention.

00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:08.709
If you have a wobbly attention,

00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:13.625
if your attention is one minute here, one minute there;

00:31:14.458 --> 00:31:18.542
if you have an attention by which you just can criticize others

00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:21.500
and cannot see your own faults;

00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:24.625
if you have an attention by which

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:31.417
you show people that you are a frivolous, nonsensical person,

00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:40.000
then your Guru Principle is wasted.

00:31:41.375 --> 00:31:45.083
It is the effort of Sahaja Yoga that is wasted,

00:31:45.583 --> 00:31:48.583
and your Guru’s job is also wasted.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.417
Minimum of minimum, first the attention has to be pure.

00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:07.125
But pure attention doesn't mean harshness,

00:32:08.166 --> 00:32:10.458
it doesn't mean asceticism,

00:32:11.125 --> 00:32:13.583
it doesn't mean disciplining your eyes

00:32:13.709 --> 00:32:17.542
like a blinkers of horse,

00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:20.667
but in all freedom

00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:24.709
your attention to be concentrated.

00:32:26.375 --> 00:32:29.500
Where do we pay our attention the most?

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:35.417
If we are honest we can think on human level

00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:38.709
we pay our attention to our children,

00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:43.709
to our wife, to our husbands, to our family,

00:32:44.208 --> 00:32:49.417
the relationships which are with love.

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:55.542
So when your attention

00:32:57.417 --> 00:32:59.417
has got

00:33:02.375 --> 00:33:05.291
the compassion

00:33:06.542 --> 00:33:11.208
and the love for another person,

00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:17.125
then only you can work out the realization of others.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.709
If you have to work out the realization of others,

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:27.083
it has to be an intense love

00:33:28.083 --> 00:33:30.417
for another person.

00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:35.125
If you don’t have that intensity,

00:33:35.583 --> 00:33:39.125
you are just moving your hands raising the kundalini

00:33:39.291 --> 00:33:43.166
because your Mother has given you powers, and it’s finished off.

00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:47.041
That intensity of love

00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:50.667
can only give you success

00:33:51.208 --> 00:33:53.291
with your pure attention,

00:33:53.542 --> 00:33:58.625
and I think the pure attention can only love.

00:33:59.709 --> 00:34:02.333
Impure attention cannot love,

00:34:02.542 --> 00:34:06.542
because all impure attention is self-oriented,

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.041
I-oriented.

00:34:10.417 --> 00:34:15.500
They are not “self” in the sense “spiritual-oriented.”

00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:23.583
But the idea that spirituality is love,

00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:28.208
it seems to be a new idea for many people.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:34.166
They think spirituality means a person who is just

00:34:34.417 --> 00:34:38.625
absolutely dry like a beanstalk

00:34:40.375 --> 00:34:42.041
and

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.041
nobody can go near that person,

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.709
nobody can communicate

00:34:50.041 --> 00:34:55.458
with such a person because that person is “too pure.”

00:34:56.667 --> 00:35:01.166
If the soap cannot cleanse your body,

00:35:01.417 --> 00:35:04.583
what's the use of having the soap?

00:35:05.208 --> 00:35:10.250
If the soap is afraid to come near you,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.583
then it’s better not to be called as soap.

00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:20.000
So we come to the point

00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:26.542
that the creativity, if it is our aim, lakshya,

00:35:27.417 --> 00:35:32.000
for that the attention we should purify,

00:35:35.125 --> 00:35:41.291
and to be purified with love, with compassion.

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:47.709
And the same attention when it is filled with love and compassion

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:52.583
it gives you dynamism, it gives you strength,

00:35:53.083 --> 00:35:57.417
it's untiring zeal you get.

00:35:59.583 --> 00:36:05.583
And the joy of seeing your reflection into another person

00:36:06.583 --> 00:36:08.709
is very beautiful.

00:36:09.291 --> 00:36:11.667
No words can describe it.

00:36:12.542 --> 00:36:16.291
Actually when you give realization to another person,

00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:21.083
what you try to see is your image in that person,

00:36:21.291 --> 00:36:24.583
as if out of an ordinary glass

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.041
you are making it into a beautiful mirror

00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:31.250
and then you want to see that.

00:36:32.375 --> 00:36:34.375
That is how you create,

00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:39.333
you create your own reflections and

00:36:40.709 --> 00:36:45.542
through the cleansing of the reflectors,

00:36:46.417 --> 00:36:51.583
once you understand that without creativity

00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:55.041
this Guru Puja is useless for you.

00:36:56.417 --> 00:37:00.458
If you just live for yourself, for your family,

00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:05.709
for your husband or just for an ashram,

00:37:06.166 --> 00:37:08.583
then you have not expanded at all,

00:37:09.041 --> 00:37:13.709
you have not done any duty towards your Guru.

00:37:17.583 --> 00:37:23.375
Of course as soon as you take to this principle

00:37:23.583 --> 00:37:26.250
you develop so many qualities within you.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.041
The first you develop is wisdom,

00:37:31.375 --> 00:37:35.500
because you realize where you are going wrong,

00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:40.709
why this is not working out, why there's a problem,

00:37:41.417 --> 00:37:44.625
why your creativity doesn't act.

00:37:45.125 --> 00:37:50.125
It becomes evident to you, obvious to you

00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:53.166
and you start learning;

00:37:54.417 --> 00:37:58.083
and wisdom comes to you, and you understand.

00:37:58.458 --> 00:38:02.041
Wisdom is when you realize your mistakes

00:38:02.291 --> 00:38:04.709
and rectify them,

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.542
and with that you develop the balance,

00:38:10.166 --> 00:38:12.333
the understanding

00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:17.041
how to deal with another personality.

00:38:18.208 --> 00:38:22.375
I always tell the story of a car,

00:38:22.583 --> 00:38:27.291
that there's an accelerator and also there's a brake.

00:38:27.583 --> 00:38:32.041
You have to use first both of them without understanding what is it,

00:38:32.208 --> 00:38:34.500
still you are not a guru,

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.458
you are not even a driver.

00:38:37.709 --> 00:38:41.458
Then when you know then you automatically drive;

00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:46.333
then you are a driver, but still the master is sitting behind.

00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:49.625
So now you have to become the master,

00:38:50.083 --> 00:38:54.083
and when you become the master you can balance the vehicle

00:38:54.250 --> 00:39:00.458
and you can see the driver, accelerator and also the brake.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.333
And you can manage it just in a very simple manner.

00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:12.500
So this Guru Principle is limited,

00:39:14.083 --> 00:39:17.625
and goes on increasing its limitations

00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:23.583
like the horizon.

00:39:24.208 --> 00:39:29.417
As you start growing into more creativity,

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:33.291
the more people you create.

00:39:34.291 --> 00:39:38.583
And the central point of this one is the Nabhi,

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:42.083
is the center which

00:39:42.542 --> 00:39:46.166
like a big pivotal point

00:39:46.375 --> 00:39:51.041
on which the whole of this movement takes place.

00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:56.250
Nabhi Chakra as you know,

00:39:56.458 --> 00:40:00.458
you get it from your mother to begin with.

00:40:01.125 --> 00:40:04.542
So a guru has to be the mother,

00:40:06.125 --> 00:40:08.375
he must have the qualities of the mother

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.709
not the modern mothers, but in the real sense of the word.

00:40:13.458 --> 00:40:20.417
That is, a guru has to love her children

00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:26.250
and has to have strength and courage

00:40:26.417 --> 00:40:29.041
to correct her children.

00:40:30.375 --> 00:40:33.500
And the earnest desire should be

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.583
to put the children onto proper lines

00:40:36.709 --> 00:40:40.250
to guide them and to help them to rise.

00:40:42.417 --> 00:40:46.125
So the first nourishment comes to us

00:40:46.458 --> 00:40:50.667
even when we are in the womb of the mother,

00:40:51.417 --> 00:40:54.500
through the mother; and so

00:40:55.083 --> 00:40:59.041
you are the mother though you may be a man or a woman,

00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:03.041
but in quality you are the mother.

00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:07.458
And whatever you think or whatever you do

00:41:08.667 --> 00:41:12.125
has an effect on the child.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.542
The way you behave, the way you talk,

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:20.667
the way you live, everything has a bearing

00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:25.250
on the development of the child.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.250
In the same way when,

00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:32.250
supposing a Sahaja yogi who is trying to give realization

00:41:32.583 --> 00:41:38.250
is a hypocritical person, if he's a wrong type of a person,

00:41:38.583 --> 00:41:42.166
if he does not respect his own Guru,

00:41:44.166 --> 00:41:47.542
the children behave the same manner

00:41:48.041 --> 00:41:51.291
and they take to wrong things much faster,

00:41:51.583 --> 00:41:54.250
they see to wrong things first.

00:41:54.542 --> 00:41:59.208
So you have to be perfect in your behavior

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:03.250
towards your own Guru,

00:42:03.458 --> 00:42:08.083
you have to respect your own Guru in a full way.

00:42:08.417 --> 00:42:12.041
Complete surrender to your own Guru is important;

00:42:12.208 --> 00:42:16.166
then they will see how you have treated your own Guru,

00:42:16.375 --> 00:42:19.542
and that is how they will treat you.

00:42:20.583 --> 00:42:24.166
If you don’t treat your Guru with that respect,

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.542
with that understanding,

00:42:27.417 --> 00:42:29.125
with that surrendering,

00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:33.375
then don't expect your children

00:42:33.542 --> 00:42:38.500
or the people whom you are guiding are going to respect you.

00:42:39.458 --> 00:42:43.333
So this Guru Principle within us has to be

00:42:43.542 --> 00:42:48.375
like a great sage or a great seer,

00:42:49.417 --> 00:42:53.542
who is above the normal mundane people

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.041
and sees the things in a proper perspective,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.625
and delivers

00:43:02.166 --> 00:43:05.625
a proper understanding

00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:10.166
of all this perspective he sees,

00:43:10.375 --> 00:43:12.041
to his disciples,

00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:17.083
doesn't give them distorted or wrong ideas.

00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:28.166
Now one may say that, “Mother, how is it, that the love

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.125
we can express and also tell them the truth?”

00:43:34.333 --> 00:43:41.125
You have to look after the benevolence – hitha.

00:43:41.709 --> 00:43:47.709
You have to look after the benevolence of your disciple.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:50.375
It may appear that

00:43:50.583 --> 00:43:55.041
he may not like what you are telling that person today,

00:43:55.333 --> 00:43:58.583
but a day will come when he will think

00:43:59.041 --> 00:44:02.250
“Thank God your Guru has corrected you

00:44:02.417 --> 00:44:05.125
and has put you on the right path.”

00:44:05.333 --> 00:44:09.625
If the goal of the disciple is not to ascend,

00:44:11.041 --> 00:44:15.208
is just to be there for some sort of a purpose,

00:44:15.542 --> 00:44:19.375
then it’s better not to have such disciples.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.667
Not to have anyone of this kind

00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:28.000
who are not there for their own ascent,

00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:35.500
but for other gains, which are absolutely of no avail.

00:44:40.667 --> 00:44:46.417
This question arises sometimes, how to love?

00:44:47.291 --> 00:44:50.166
It’s a very funny question

00:44:51.083 --> 00:44:54.166
that we don't know how to love human beings.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:59.083
We can love our things, we can love our useless things,

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:05.041
we can love some sort of a beautiful scenery

00:45:05.166 --> 00:45:07.083
because it gives us joy.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.166
We can love some

00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:13.542
nice restaurant because you can get good food there,

00:45:13.709 --> 00:45:18.291
or some sort of a thing which is of a very baser nature.

00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:25.083
But love for love’s sake is this,

00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:32.083
that when you really love for love’s sake,

00:45:32.291 --> 00:45:35.125
then you try to put

00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:40.417
or implant that love into somebody else,

00:45:41.291 --> 00:45:47.333
that you make another person as loveable as you are.

00:45:49.125 --> 00:45:53.291
So the whole system becomes different if you understand

00:45:53.583 --> 00:45:58.041
that we have to base all our progress,

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:02.625
all our love, all our movements, all our behavior,

00:46:03.083 --> 00:46:06.375
all our understanding on love.

00:46:06.542 --> 00:46:10.041
Otherwise your Guru Principle is extremely weak,

00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:14.000
and after some time you will find you are just standing

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:18.458
out of the shores of Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:27.500
Anybody who is attached or biased and has conditionings

00:46:28.041 --> 00:46:31.125
cannot become a guru, cannot;

00:46:31.458 --> 00:46:34.500
because even if he becomes, so-called,

00:46:34.667 --> 00:46:38.542
all those things will be reflected in that person.

00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:43.709
Or say if he is very full of ego, thinks no end of himself

00:46:44.166 --> 00:46:47.208
and thinks that, “I am a great guru,”

00:46:48.125 --> 00:46:51.083
that ego also would be expressed.

00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:54.417
Supposing such a guru talks too much,

00:46:55.625 --> 00:47:01.083
also they find the disciple the same style.

00:47:01.333 --> 00:47:05.417
If he is a quiet type, you find the disciple the same style.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.458
So we reach a conclusion that first we must develop

00:47:10.709 --> 00:47:13.667
our own Guru Principle.

00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:22.542
If we cannot develop that, it is no use doing any Guru Puja

00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:28.417
because it is just temporary, it's not going to help you much,

00:47:29.041 --> 00:47:33.166
unless and until you really decide

00:47:33.667 --> 00:47:39.083
that you are going to nourish

00:47:39.333 --> 00:47:44.083
and develop and establish your Guru Principle.

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:50.083
So today when you are worshipping Me as the Guru,

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.250
you must know that any amount of My talking,

00:47:53.375 --> 00:47:59.000
any amount of My giving you blessings or anything

00:47:59.166 --> 00:48:02.208
is not going to work out, unless and until

00:48:02.375 --> 00:48:08.500
we really develop our own Guru Principle, and the depth.

00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:13.583
Because a guru

00:48:15.375 --> 00:48:19.667
makes his disciple cross the Bhavasagara,

00:48:20.166 --> 00:48:22.375
he's like the boat

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.709
who takes his disciples and crosses

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:35.250
with love and with proper direction.

00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:40.250
That has to be with all of you.

00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:43.500
As it is you are all realized souls

00:48:44.083 --> 00:48:46.667
and as I have told you, you are all angels.

00:48:47.166 --> 00:48:50.500
But if you do not establish your Guru Principle,

00:48:51.125 --> 00:48:56.417
you know of angels how they have fallen down and gone forever.

00:48:57.041 --> 00:49:01.208
So be careful: it’s easy to be an angel

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.083
but difficult to maintain it.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.583
It is difficult to be the Gods and Goddesses,

00:49:09.083 --> 00:49:12.166
but easy to maintain it.

00:49:15.458 --> 00:49:21.500
So all of you are here. I’m very happy to see

00:49:22.083 --> 00:49:25.333
that you have come to worship Me as your Guru.

00:49:25.709 --> 00:49:30.542
And I would expect that My children

00:49:31.041 --> 00:49:34.333
are after My own image.

00:49:34.709 --> 00:49:38.500
That My image should be such that My children

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:43.041
should feel that oneness with My image,

00:49:43.291 --> 00:49:48.083
and I should be a proud Mother of so many children

00:49:48.333 --> 00:49:51.291
who have come from so many countries.

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.417
May God bless you all.

00:50:05.041 --> 00:50:10.041
Now with so many people here, so many children here,

00:50:12.375 --> 00:50:16.166
we can have all the children just to wash My feet,

00:50:16.333 --> 00:50:19.125
and after that we'll need some girls

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:23.125
who are above sixteen years

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.458
to twenty-one years, we can say.

00:50:29.083 --> 00:50:32.375
And then some ladies

00:50:32.542 --> 00:50:36.041
for the purpose of

00:50:39.208 --> 00:50:43.500
worshipping Shakti, the Goddess.

00:50:43.667 --> 00:50:48.083
Without the Shakti nothing can be done.

00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:55.458
So first the children have to come up just to wash the feet.

00:51:19.375 --> 00:51:24.250
And I hope the world leaders will be here also.

00:51:25.458 --> 00:51:29.250
They are in the image of gurus now.

00:51:29.417 --> 00:51:33.125
And the leaders have to be something special.

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:35.083
You are not a leader

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:40.583
if you are such an ordinary, mundane type of a person.

00:52:17.583 --> 00:52:20.667
Now, where are the musicians?

00:52:25.583 --> 00:52:29.417
Where are the musicians?

00:52:29.583 --> 00:52:31.083
All right.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:35.667
So you have to first say the Atharva Sheersha,

00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:40.583
and then you have to sing the Ganesha Stuthi,

00:52:40.667 --> 00:52:45.166
or maybe any other thing that you know of Ganesha.
