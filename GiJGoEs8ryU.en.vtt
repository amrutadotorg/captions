WEBVTT

20:31.500 --> 20:34.625
Today we have

20:35.041 --> 20:38.583
had to spend a little more time than normal

20:39.000 --> 20:41.583
to get to the stage

20:42.125 --> 20:47.375
where we could really worship the Guru.

20:53.041 --> 20:57.333
When we worship our Guru,

20:59.375 --> 21:02.291
we have to know actually

21:02.625 --> 21:05.041
we are trying to awaken

21:05.375 --> 21:09.083
the Guru Principle within ourselves.

21:11.583 --> 21:16.041
It’s not only that you are here to worship your Guru.

21:17.041 --> 21:20.125
You may worship

21:21.166 --> 21:23.417
many-a-times,

21:23.667 --> 21:28.041
maybe the vibrations would flow,

21:28.625 --> 21:33.709
Maybe that you might get filled with that

21:35.041 --> 21:38.166
and you feel

21:39.166 --> 21:44.625
elevated, nourished.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.291
But this nourishment

21:49.375 --> 21:52.625
has to be retained within ourselves,

21:53.083 --> 21:58.250
So always remember then,

21:59.333 --> 22:03.250
whenever you are worshipping

22:03.583 --> 22:07.333
any principle

22:08.041 --> 22:11.291
outside, you are trying

22:11.625 --> 22:16.500
to worship your own principle within yourself.

22:21.417 --> 22:26.291
Within us as you know, in all of us

22:26.625 --> 22:31.125
there lies the principle of Guru.

22:34.166 --> 22:38.667
It’s very interesting to notice

22:41.333 --> 22:46.041
the Guru Principle being drawn

22:46.709 --> 22:50.500
beautifully round the Nabhi Chakra.

22:51.709 --> 22:57.375
We never see any chakras connected with the Guru Principle.

23:00.333 --> 23:04.709
You see Nabhi, and around is the Bhavasagara.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.542
So this Bhavasagara

23:12.208 --> 23:17.333
which is the Ocean of Illusion cannot be the Guru.

23:21.625 --> 23:24.458
So there are

23:26.625 --> 23:31.709
hidden chakras within this Bhavasagara

23:32.250 --> 23:35.709
within us, which are

23:37.458 --> 23:40.000
to be awakened

23:40.542 --> 23:44.291
and to be brought to light,

23:45.000 --> 23:48.166
to be manifested.

23:53.375 --> 23:56.709
As you can see that

23:58.083 --> 24:03.667
the limits of this principle

24:04.583 --> 24:08.542
are done by the movement

24:09.041 --> 24:11.291
of the Swadisthana Chakra.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.375
Swadisthan is the chakra

24:16.583 --> 24:21.333
which gives you, first and foremost thing, is

24:24.375 --> 24:26.667
the creativity.

24:29.041 --> 24:32.333
A person who is a guru

24:33.125 --> 24:36.250
has to be creative by nature.

24:39.333 --> 24:42.250
If you are not a creative person

24:42.625 --> 24:45.583
you cannot become a guru.

24:47.709 --> 24:50.250
For example,

24:55.250 --> 24:58.458
you are faced with disciples

25:00.542 --> 25:04.125
with whom you have to converse.

25:05.583 --> 25:09.000
You have to create

25:09.583 --> 25:13.709
a word of divine magic

25:15.375 --> 25:20.375
to impress on the disciples

25:20.709 --> 25:25.417
or the people who are attracted towards you as gurus,

25:28.500 --> 25:31.041
to show that

25:31.709 --> 25:37.125
you have much more divine magic than them.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.542
If you are a very mundane type of a person,

25:44.333 --> 25:46.583
very ordinary,

25:47.625 --> 25:49.542
cannot create

25:50.458 --> 25:56.291
a beautiful couplet or a beautiful sentence,

25:58.208 --> 26:01.667
or a humor or a joke,

26:03.625 --> 26:09.375
or a beautiful painting

26:12.041 --> 26:16.000
or a beautiful tapestry

26:16.458 --> 26:18.709
or a beautiful house;

26:19.500 --> 26:21.625
if you lack in creativity

26:22.125 --> 26:25.417
you will lack in your Guru Principle,

26:25.709 --> 26:28.583
because a guru has to create

26:29.083 --> 26:32.166
out of ordinary people

26:35.500 --> 26:38.250
something extraordinary.

26:40.583 --> 26:44.500
He should be able to create

26:46.500 --> 26:52.542
a new personality out of

27:00.000 --> 27:04.125
personality which is decaying.

27:07.083 --> 27:13.000
So the first principle you have to understand within yourself,

27:13.500 --> 27:16.583
that you should be able to create

27:17.083 --> 27:20.625
a new personality in a person.

27:26.208 --> 27:29.041
So how do we do it?

27:29.333 --> 27:34.166
Of course you have got powers to raise the Kundalini,

27:34.417 --> 27:39.709
you have got powers to cure people,

27:40.709 --> 27:45.333
you have got powers to talk big or talk small.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.709
Despite all that,

27:50.417 --> 27:54.417
if you cannot create a new personality

27:55.041 --> 27:58.375
out of the persons with whom you are dealing,

27:58.583 --> 28:01.500
then you are not a guru.

28:02.667 --> 28:05.333
And the new personality has to be

28:05.583 --> 28:10.125
a special personality of very unique

28:10.583 --> 28:15.709
combination of compassion and dynamism.

28:21.083 --> 28:23.542
So it is important

28:25.166 --> 28:30.125
that in your creativity

28:30.542 --> 28:36.709
you have to use the energy of compassion.

28:38.375 --> 28:42.083
You can only mold people through compassion

28:42.583 --> 28:45.500
and never through anger,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.500
never through suppression,

28:49.125 --> 28:51.625
never through showing off

28:52.083 --> 28:54.709
your powers of gurudom.

28:57.500 --> 29:02.083
Unless and until you handle the situation

29:02.583 --> 29:06.083
and the personality very carefully,

29:09.041 --> 29:11.375
showing all the respect,

29:11.625 --> 29:14.500
showing all the concern

29:15.166 --> 29:17.542
and all the love

29:18.166 --> 29:21.542
for the person whom you are giving realization.

29:22.291 --> 29:26.000
Just showing off that you are a great guru,

29:26.583 --> 29:30.041
it will only create a kind of a fear about you,

29:30.291 --> 29:34.542
and after some time people would not like to see your faces.

29:39.375 --> 29:44.208
So the most important thing about

29:46.625 --> 29:50.709
Guru Principle is that you have to create.

29:53.083 --> 29:56.333
Many people get realization, all right,

29:57.083 --> 29:59.208
they get realization

29:59.583 --> 30:02.333
and then they stay in some ashrams maybe.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.709
They come to pujas,

30:08.083 --> 30:12.041
they listen to music, they may dance,

30:12.333 --> 30:15.041
they laugh, they’re collective,

30:15.333 --> 30:19.208
but still their Guru Principle is not awakened

30:19.417 --> 30:22.458
unless and until they have created

30:23.125 --> 30:27.250
many, many more Sahaja yogis, Sahaja yogis.

30:31.417 --> 30:34.625
So the vision of a guru should be,

30:35.333 --> 30:39.041
“How many Sahaja yogis I am going to create?

30:40.208 --> 30:43.250
How am I going to use this creativity

30:44.250 --> 30:47.625
to create more Sahaja yogis?”

30:49.208 --> 30:54.417
So the basis or the essence of the Swadisthana Chakra,

30:54.667 --> 30:57.291
though is aesthetics,

30:58.166 --> 31:01.625
the force and the energy of Swadisthana Chakra

31:02.250 --> 31:04.333
is attention.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.709
If you have a wobbly attention,

31:10.291 --> 31:13.625
if your attention is one minute here, one minute there;

31:14.458 --> 31:18.542
if you have an attention by which you just can criticize others

31:19.166 --> 31:21.500
and cannot see your own faults;

31:22.041 --> 31:24.625
if you have an attention by which

31:26.417 --> 31:31.417
you show people that you are a frivolous, nonsensical person,

31:35.333 --> 31:40.000
then your Guru Principle is wasted.

31:41.375 --> 31:45.083
It is the effort of Sahaja Yoga that is wasted,

31:45.583 --> 31:48.583
and your Guru’s job is also wasted.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.417
Minimum of minimum, first the attention has to be pure.

32:02.375 --> 32:07.125
But pure attention doesn't mean harshness,

32:08.166 --> 32:10.458
it doesn't mean asceticism,

32:11.125 --> 32:13.583
it doesn't mean disciplining your eyes

32:13.709 --> 32:17.542
like a blinkers of horse,

32:18.375 --> 32:20.667
but in all freedom

32:21.125 --> 32:24.709
your attention to be concentrated.

32:26.375 --> 32:29.500
Where do we pay our attention the most?

32:30.250 --> 32:35.417
If we are honest we can think on human level

32:35.583 --> 32:38.709
we pay our attention to our children,

32:39.375 --> 32:43.709
to our wife, to our husbands, to our family,

32:44.208 --> 32:49.417
the relationships which are with love.

32:51.375 --> 32:55.542
So when your attention

32:57.417 --> 32:59.417
has got

33:02.375 --> 33:05.291
the compassion

33:06.542 --> 33:11.208
and the love for another person,

33:12.041 --> 33:17.125
then only you can work out the realization of others.

33:18.250 --> 33:21.709
If you have to work out the realization of others,

33:22.250 --> 33:27.083
it has to be an intense love

33:28.083 --> 33:30.417
for another person.

33:31.458 --> 33:35.125
If you don’t have that intensity,

33:35.583 --> 33:39.125
you are just moving your hands raising the kundalini

33:39.291 --> 33:43.166
because your Mother has given you powers, and it’s finished off.

33:43.333 --> 33:47.041
That intensity of love

33:48.041 --> 33:50.667
can only give you success

33:51.208 --> 33:53.291
with your pure attention,

33:53.542 --> 33:58.625
and I think the pure attention can only love.

33:59.709 --> 34:02.333
Impure attention cannot love,

34:02.542 --> 34:06.542
because all impure attention is self-oriented,

34:07.500 --> 34:10.041
I-oriented.

34:10.417 --> 34:15.500
They are not “self” in the sense “spiritual-oriented.”

34:18.041 --> 34:23.583
But the idea that spirituality is love,

34:24.333 --> 34:28.208
it seems to be a new idea for many people.

34:29.250 --> 34:34.166
They think spirituality means a person who is just

34:34.417 --> 34:38.625
absolutely dry like a beanstalk

34:40.375 --> 34:42.041
and

34:43.000 --> 34:46.041
nobody can go near that person,

34:46.250 --> 34:48.709
nobody can communicate

34:50.041 --> 34:55.458
with such a person because that person is “too pure.”

34:56.667 --> 35:01.166
If the soap cannot cleanse your body,

35:01.417 --> 35:04.583
what's the use of having the soap?

35:05.208 --> 35:10.250
If the soap is afraid to come near you,

35:10.500 --> 35:14.583
then it’s better not to be called as soap.

35:15.583 --> 35:20.000
So we come to the point

35:20.208 --> 35:26.542
that the creativity, if it is our aim, lakshya,

35:27.417 --> 35:32.000
for that the attention we should purify,

35:35.125 --> 35:41.291
and to be purified with love, with compassion.

35:43.041 --> 35:47.709
And the same attention when it is filled with love and compassion

35:48.250 --> 35:52.583
it gives you dynamism, it gives you strength,

35:53.083 --> 35:57.417
it's untiring zeal you get.

35:59.583 --> 36:05.583
And the joy of seeing your reflection into another person

36:06.583 --> 36:08.709
is very beautiful.

36:09.291 --> 36:11.667
No words can describe it.

36:12.542 --> 36:16.291
Actually when you give realization to another person,

36:16.625 --> 36:21.083
what you try to see is your image in that person,

36:21.291 --> 36:24.583
as if out of an ordinary glass

36:25.000 --> 36:28.041
you are making it into a beautiful mirror

36:28.291 --> 36:31.250
and then you want to see that.

36:32.375 --> 36:34.375
That is how you create,

36:34.583 --> 36:39.333
you create your own reflections and

36:40.709 --> 36:45.542
through the cleansing of the reflectors,

36:46.417 --> 36:51.583
once you understand that without creativity

36:52.083 --> 36:55.041
this Guru Puja is useless for you.

36:56.417 --> 37:00.458
If you just live for yourself, for your family,

37:00.667 --> 37:05.709
for your husband or just for an ashram,

37:06.166 --> 37:08.583
then you have not expanded at all,

37:09.041 --> 37:13.709
you have not done any duty towards your Guru.

37:17.583 --> 37:23.375
Of course as soon as you take to this principle

37:23.583 --> 37:26.250
you develop so many qualities within you.

37:26.500 --> 37:30.041
The first you develop is wisdom,

37:31.375 --> 37:35.500
because you realize where you are going wrong,

37:36.166 --> 37:40.709
why this is not working out, why there's a problem,

37:41.417 --> 37:44.625
why your creativity doesn't act.

37:45.125 --> 37:50.125
It becomes evident to you, obvious to you

37:50.583 --> 37:53.166
and you start learning;

37:54.417 --> 37:58.083
and wisdom comes to you, and you understand.

37:58.458 --> 38:02.041
Wisdom is when you realize your mistakes

38:02.291 --> 38:04.709
and rectify them,

38:05.500 --> 38:09.542
and with that you develop the balance,

38:10.166 --> 38:12.333
the understanding

38:13.333 --> 38:17.041
how to deal with another personality.

38:18.208 --> 38:22.375
I always tell the story of a car,

38:22.583 --> 38:27.291
that there's an accelerator and also there's a brake.

38:27.583 --> 38:32.041
You have to use first both of them without understanding what is it,

38:32.208 --> 38:34.500
still you are not a guru,

38:35.500 --> 38:37.458
you are not even a driver.

38:37.709 --> 38:41.458
Then when you know then you automatically drive;

38:41.667 --> 38:46.333
then you are a driver, but still the master is sitting behind.

38:47.166 --> 38:49.625
So now you have to become the master,

38:50.083 --> 38:54.083
and when you become the master you can balance the vehicle

38:54.250 --> 39:00.458
and you can see the driver, accelerator and also the brake.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.333
And you can manage it just in a very simple manner.

39:09.125 --> 39:12.500
So this Guru Principle is limited,

39:14.083 --> 39:17.625
and goes on increasing its limitations

39:20.583 --> 39:23.583
like the horizon.

39:24.208 --> 39:29.417
As you start growing into more creativity,

39:29.667 --> 39:33.291
the more people you create.

39:34.291 --> 39:38.583
And the central point of this one is the Nabhi,

39:39.250 --> 39:42.083
is the center which

39:42.542 --> 39:46.166
like a big pivotal point

39:46.375 --> 39:51.041
on which the whole of this movement takes place.

39:54.041 --> 39:56.250
Nabhi Chakra as you know,

39:56.458 --> 40:00.458
you get it from your mother to begin with.

40:01.125 --> 40:04.542
So a guru has to be the mother,

40:06.125 --> 40:08.375
he must have the qualities of the mother

40:08.500 --> 40:12.709
not the modern mothers, but in the real sense of the word.

40:13.458 --> 40:20.417
That is, a guru has to love her children

40:21.625 --> 40:26.250
and has to have strength and courage

40:26.417 --> 40:29.041
to correct her children.

40:30.375 --> 40:33.500
And the earnest desire should be

40:34.000 --> 40:36.583
to put the children onto proper lines

40:36.709 --> 40:40.250
to guide them and to help them to rise.

40:42.417 --> 40:46.125
So the first nourishment comes to us

40:46.458 --> 40:50.667
even when we are in the womb of the mother,

40:51.417 --> 40:54.500
through the mother; and so

40:55.083 --> 40:59.041
you are the mother though you may be a man or a woman,

40:59.291 --> 41:03.041
but in quality you are the mother.

41:03.417 --> 41:07.458
And whatever you think or whatever you do

41:08.667 --> 41:12.125
has an effect on the child.

41:13.250 --> 41:16.542
The way you behave, the way you talk,

41:17.041 --> 41:20.667
the way you live, everything has a bearing

41:21.166 --> 41:25.250
on the development of the child.

41:25.500 --> 41:28.250
In the same way when,

41:28.458 --> 41:32.250
supposing a Sahaja yogi who is trying to give realization

41:32.583 --> 41:38.250
is a hypocritical person, if he's a wrong type of a person,

41:38.583 --> 41:42.166
if he does not respect his own Guru,

41:44.166 --> 41:47.542
the children behave the same manner

41:48.041 --> 41:51.291
and they take to wrong things much faster,

41:51.583 --> 41:54.250
they see to wrong things first.

41:54.542 --> 41:59.208
So you have to be perfect in your behavior

42:00.417 --> 42:03.250
towards your own Guru,

42:03.458 --> 42:08.083
you have to respect your own Guru in a full way.

42:08.417 --> 42:12.041
Complete surrender to your own Guru is important;

42:12.208 --> 42:16.166
then they will see how you have treated your own Guru,

42:16.375 --> 42:19.542
and that is how they will treat you.

42:20.583 --> 42:24.166
If you don’t treat your Guru with that respect,

42:24.375 --> 42:26.542
with that understanding,

42:27.417 --> 42:29.125
with that surrendering,

42:29.333 --> 42:33.375
then don't expect your children

42:33.542 --> 42:38.500
or the people whom you are guiding are going to respect you.

42:39.458 --> 42:43.333
So this Guru Principle within us has to be

42:43.542 --> 42:48.375
like a great sage or a great seer,

42:49.417 --> 42:53.542
who is above the normal mundane people

42:54.000 --> 42:58.041
and sees the things in a proper perspective,

42:58.500 --> 43:01.625
and delivers

43:02.166 --> 43:05.625
a proper understanding

43:06.208 --> 43:10.166
of all this perspective he sees,

43:10.375 --> 43:12.041
to his disciples,

43:12.291 --> 43:17.083
doesn't give them distorted or wrong ideas.

43:21.041 --> 43:28.166
Now one may say that, “Mother, how is it, that the love

43:28.500 --> 43:33.125
we can express and also tell them the truth?”

43:34.333 --> 43:41.125
You have to look after the benevolence – hitha.

43:41.709 --> 43:47.709
You have to look after the benevolence of your disciple.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.375
It may appear that

43:50.583 --> 43:55.041
he may not like what you are telling that person today,

43:55.333 --> 43:58.583
but a day will come when he will think

43:59.041 --> 44:02.250
“Thank God your Guru has corrected you

44:02.417 --> 44:05.125
and has put you on the right path.”

44:05.333 --> 44:09.625
If the goal of the disciple is not to ascend,

44:11.041 --> 44:15.208
is just to be there for some sort of a purpose,

44:15.542 --> 44:19.375
then it’s better not to have such disciples.

44:20.250 --> 44:22.667
Not to have anyone of this kind

44:23.083 --> 44:28.000
who are not there for their own ascent,

44:28.208 --> 44:35.500
but for other gains, which are absolutely of no avail.

44:40.667 --> 44:46.417
This question arises sometimes, how to love?

44:47.291 --> 44:50.166
It’s a very funny question

44:51.083 --> 44:54.166
that we don't know how to love human beings.

44:54.500 --> 44:59.083
We can love our things, we can love our useless things,

44:59.250 --> 45:05.041
we can love some sort of a beautiful scenery

45:05.166 --> 45:07.083
because it gives us joy.

45:07.250 --> 45:10.166
We can love some

45:10.375 --> 45:13.542
nice restaurant because you can get good food there,

45:13.709 --> 45:18.291
or some sort of a thing which is of a very baser nature.

45:22.291 --> 45:25.083
But love for love’s sake is this,

45:25.291 --> 45:32.083
that when you really love for love’s sake,

45:32.291 --> 45:35.125
then you try to put

45:35.333 --> 45:40.417
or implant that love into somebody else,

45:41.291 --> 45:47.333
that you make another person as loveable as you are.

45:49.125 --> 45:53.291
So the whole system becomes different if you understand

45:53.583 --> 45:58.041
that we have to base all our progress,

45:58.250 --> 46:02.625
all our love, all our movements, all our behavior,

46:03.083 --> 46:06.375
all our understanding on love.

46:06.542 --> 46:10.041
Otherwise your Guru Principle is extremely weak,

46:10.291 --> 46:14.000
and after some time you will find you are just standing

46:14.250 --> 46:18.458
out of the shores of Sahaja Yoga.

46:22.250 --> 46:27.500
Anybody who is attached or biased and has conditionings

46:28.041 --> 46:31.125
cannot become a guru, cannot;

46:31.458 --> 46:34.500
because even if he becomes, so-called,

46:34.667 --> 46:38.542
all those things will be reflected in that person.

46:39.709 --> 46:43.709
Or say if he is very full of ego, thinks no end of himself

46:44.166 --> 46:47.208
and thinks that, “I am a great guru,”

46:48.125 --> 46:51.083
that ego also would be expressed.

46:51.333 --> 46:54.417
Supposing such a guru talks too much,

46:55.625 --> 47:01.083
also they find the disciple the same style.

47:01.333 --> 47:05.417
If he is a quiet type, you find the disciple the same style.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.458
So we reach a conclusion that first we must develop

47:10.709 --> 47:13.667
our own Guru Principle.

47:16.083 --> 47:22.542
If we cannot develop that, it is no use doing any Guru Puja

47:23.125 --> 47:28.417
because it is just temporary, it's not going to help you much,

47:29.041 --> 47:33.166
unless and until you really decide

47:33.667 --> 47:39.083
that you are going to nourish

47:39.333 --> 47:44.083
and develop and establish your Guru Principle.

47:46.250 --> 47:50.083
So today when you are worshipping Me as the Guru,

47:50.500 --> 47:53.250
you must know that any amount of My talking,

47:53.375 --> 47:59.000
any amount of My giving you blessings or anything

47:59.166 --> 48:02.208
is not going to work out, unless and until

48:02.375 --> 48:08.500
we really develop our own Guru Principle, and the depth.

48:10.667 --> 48:13.583
Because a guru

48:15.375 --> 48:19.667
makes his disciple cross the Bhavasagara,

48:20.166 --> 48:22.375
he's like the boat

48:23.500 --> 48:28.709
who takes his disciples and crosses

48:30.250 --> 48:35.250
with love and with proper direction.

48:37.041 --> 48:40.250
That has to be with all of you.

48:40.583 --> 48:43.500
As it is you are all realized souls

48:44.083 --> 48:46.667
and as I have told you, you are all angels.

48:47.166 --> 48:50.500
But if you do not establish your Guru Principle,

48:51.125 --> 48:56.417
you know of angels how they have fallen down and gone forever.

48:57.041 --> 49:01.208
So be careful: it’s easy to be an angel

49:01.500 --> 49:04.083
but difficult to maintain it.

49:04.500 --> 49:08.583
It is difficult to be the Gods and Goddesses,

49:09.083 --> 49:12.166
but easy to maintain it.

49:15.458 --> 49:21.500
So all of you are here. I’m very happy to see

49:22.083 --> 49:25.333
that you have come to worship Me as your Guru.

49:25.709 --> 49:30.542
And I would expect that My children

49:31.041 --> 49:34.333
are after My own image.

49:34.709 --> 49:38.500
That My image should be such that My children

49:38.709 --> 49:43.041
should feel that oneness with My image,

49:43.291 --> 49:48.083
and I should be a proud Mother of so many children

49:48.333 --> 49:51.291
who have come from so many countries.

49:51.500 --> 49:54.417
May God bless you all.

50:05.041 --> 50:10.041
Now with so many people here, so many children here,

50:12.375 --> 50:16.166
we can have all the children just to wash My feet,

50:16.333 --> 50:19.125
and after that we'll need some girls

50:19.250 --> 50:23.125
who are above sixteen years

50:24.000 --> 50:27.458
to twenty-one years, we can say.

50:29.083 --> 50:32.375
And then some ladies

50:32.542 --> 50:36.041
for the purpose of

50:39.208 --> 50:43.500
worshipping Shakti, the Goddess.

50:43.667 --> 50:48.083
Without the Shakti nothing can be done.

50:49.041 --> 50:55.458
So first the children have to come up just to wash the feet.

51:19.375 --> 51:24.250
And I hope the world leaders will be here also.

51:25.458 --> 51:29.250
They are in the image of gurus now.

51:29.417 --> 51:33.125
And the leaders have to be something special.

51:33.250 --> 51:35.083
You are not a leader

51:35.250 --> 51:40.583
if you are such an ordinary, mundane type of a person.

52:17.583 --> 52:20.667
Now, where are the musicians?

52:25.583 --> 52:29.417
Where are the musicians?

52:29.583 --> 52:31.083
All right.

52:31.250 --> 52:35.667
So you have to first say the Atharva Sheersha,

52:36.041 --> 52:40.583
and then you have to sing the Ganesha Stuthi,

52:40.667 --> 52:45.166
or maybe any other thing that you know of Ganesha.
