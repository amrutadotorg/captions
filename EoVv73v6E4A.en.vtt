WEBVTT

00:47.300 --> 00:51.420
Today we have gathered here

00:51.920 --> 00:55.470
to worship Shri Krishna,

00:56.920 --> 01:00.550
the one who was Virat,

01:02.670 --> 01:08.220
who fought all kinds of evil

01:11.380 --> 01:15.420
without entering into the arena.

01:16.630 --> 01:20.630
Shri Krishna’s life,

01:21.300 --> 01:27.550
it’s sense of is very ... a beautiful,

01:28.800 --> 01:36.300
creative and loving thing;

01:38.760 --> 01:44.380
but to understand Him, it is not easy.

01:46.300 --> 01:52.260
For example, in Kurukshetra,

01:53.420 --> 01:56.220
where the war was going on

01:56.880 --> 02:01.590
and Arjuna became depressed

02:03.380 --> 02:05.510
and he said that

02:05.880 --> 02:11.800
“Why should we fight, fight our own kith and kin,

02:12.590 --> 02:15.880
fight our own close relations,

02:16.420 --> 02:18.630
friends and our gurus?

02:20.760 --> 02:23.760
Is it religion? Is it dharma?”

02:25.260 --> 02:27.550
Before that, in Gita,

02:28.720 --> 02:32.880
Shri Krishna has described a personality

02:33.380 --> 02:36.920
which is a sage.

02:37.670 --> 02:41.920
We can call him a saint. Or He called it a sityapragya.

02:43.550 --> 02:49.340
So when asked what is the definition of the sityapragya,

02:49.720 --> 02:52.260
the description He gave was

02:52.840 --> 02:56.840
about a person  who is absolutely at peace with himself

02:57.550 --> 03:00.550
and at peace with his atmosphere.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.260
Is very surprising.

03:05.550 --> 03:09.760
All this knowledge He gave in the

03:10.760 --> 03:13.380
first place in Gita.

03:14.470 --> 03:16.800
That is — that is the best,

03:17.380 --> 03:19.840
that He called as the Gnyanamarga.

03:20.380 --> 03:25.380
That is Sahaj Yoga, by which you get the subtle knowledge.

03:28.840 --> 03:34.720
But at the same time, when you see Him advising Arjuna,

03:37.720 --> 03:44.300
it is very surprising that here he’s talking only of spirituality,

03:45.420 --> 03:48.880
of complete detachment

03:49.800 --> 03:55.380
and there He’s telling Arjuna  that “You go and fight.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.220
They are already dead people.

03:59.380 --> 04:00.760
Whom are you fighting?”

04:02.300 --> 04:08.340
This conflict is difficult to understand,

04:08.880 --> 04:12.760
that how could Shri Krishna, the same person

04:12.920 --> 04:17.670
who is preaching that ‘you all have to become sityapragya’,

04:18.260 --> 04:22.630
suddenly starts telling Arjuna

04:22.840 --> 04:25.630
that ‘you go and fight the force’.

04:28.510 --> 04:32.630
One side it is complete detachment

04:33.550 --> 04:35.920
and another side is the war.

04:38.220 --> 04:40.550
How will you explain this?

04:41.720 --> 04:44.510
Is Shri Krishna’s

04:46.300 --> 04:49.380
own words, one can say

04:50.590 --> 04:55.220
that “Once you are

04:55.840 --> 04:57.920
a Realised Soul

04:58.840 --> 05:03.550
and you have reached that highest position

05:04.260 --> 05:06.760
in your awareness,

05:07.420 --> 05:10.340
to you everything is futile.

05:11.630 --> 05:15.550
But just now, what you have to do

05:16.470 --> 05:19.880
is to save the dharma

05:22.590 --> 05:25.420
— not the dharma that people talk about.

05:25.800 --> 05:31.300
But the dharma  means evolutionary process of human beings,

05:32.300 --> 05:36.550
which is going on and if all the good people,

05:37.380 --> 05:40.470
those who stand for righteousness, are finished,

05:40.720 --> 05:45.840
then how will this evolutionary

05:46.670 --> 05:49.800
power will be saved?

05:50.840 --> 05:55.380
So you have to save them and for that, if you have to kill,

05:55.920 --> 05:58.510
you don’t kill anybody, they’re already dead

05:58.800 --> 06:00.880
because they’re not evolved souls

06:01.340 --> 06:03.920
and they don’t care for their Realisation.

06:07.550 --> 06:12.420
So you have to fight them. You have to fight the negative forces.

06:13.630 --> 06:16.420
You have to fight the wrongdoers”.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.220
All this He explains

06:20.630 --> 06:22.920
in a very beautiful manner,

06:24.380 --> 06:28.760
that we have within us

06:31.590 --> 06:35.260
three kinds of powers, which we also know,

06:37.630 --> 06:42.760
and by the middle one that we have,

06:43.590 --> 06:50.550
we rise above all these material,

06:51.380 --> 06:54.670
physical, mental, emotional

06:55.550 --> 06:57.920
— all these problems facing us

06:58.470 --> 07:02.880
into a new realm of spirituality.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.510
And that’s what He wanted – to save

07:10.340 --> 07:13.630
from the cruel people, from the aggressive,

07:14.510 --> 07:17.880
who were also misleading others.

07:19.550 --> 07:23.340
It’s a very good understanding,

07:24.470 --> 07:28.720
if you have, that who is your relation,

07:30.420 --> 07:33.800
who is your brother, who is your sister?

07:34.920 --> 07:39.920
Those who are evolved souls are your relations.

07:40.630 --> 07:42.590
They are your own

07:43.300 --> 07:46.630
and, for them, if you have to fight the people

07:46.920 --> 07:49.510
who are aggressive people, you better do it.

07:49.800 --> 07:54.300
You have to do it. That is the way of dharma.

07:56.630 --> 08:02.670
So we have three paths, as you know, in Sahaja Yoga.

08:04.510 --> 08:07.340
The one is of bhakti.

08:07.840 --> 08:12.380
Bhakti is where you sing the praise of God,

08:12.670 --> 08:16.920
have devotion, do all kinds of rituals, everything

08:17.840 --> 08:22.340
and you think that you are very close to God.

08:25.260 --> 08:29.260
This is one which is being accepted

08:29.470 --> 08:33.800
by many, many people and by many so-called religions,

08:35.380 --> 08:38.920
that we must have complete dedication for God.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.920
How did — you are not yet connected to God.

08:43.670 --> 08:47.920
How, what are you doing? How can you have any dedication to God,

08:48.630 --> 08:51.840
with whom you are not at all connected?

08:55.300 --> 08:59.800
The second one was the karma,

09:01.380 --> 09:03.920
that you do your work.

09:05.590 --> 09:06.920
You go on doing your work

09:07.380 --> 09:09.720
with a detached mind. I mean it’s not possible,

09:10.510 --> 09:14.720
but that’s what they say and we are doing our karmas,

09:15.300 --> 09:19.300
good karmas, we do all kinds of good things,

09:19.760 --> 09:24.760
go to various places for our cleansing,

09:25.380 --> 09:30.260
meet many great people of spirituality,

09:31.340 --> 09:36.550
go to all various places and pray.

09:37.920 --> 09:42.720
Visit all auspicious places which are being described.

09:43.630 --> 09:47.300
All kinds of rituals, we do for that.

09:47.630 --> 09:50.340
That is the karma yoga.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.800
And that is what the karma yoga, according to us, is the right side.

09:56.510 --> 09:59.800
Many people, as you know, are right-sided.

10:01.420 --> 10:06.920
Right-sided people are the people who are, as you know,

10:07.550 --> 10:10.340
full of ego, arrogance

10:10.760 --> 10:14.840
and think  no end of themselves, very difficult to correct them.

10:15.670 --> 10:18.340
They also never see anything wrong with them.

10:18.760 --> 10:22.470
Whichever way they act, they think is all right.

10:23.550 --> 10:26.760
That is the karma yoga,

10:27.510 --> 10:32.260
but He has said that

10:33.300 --> 10:35.800
whatever karmas you do,

10:37.340 --> 10:41.880
whatever its fruits are, that you cannot say.

10:43.630 --> 10:47.260
He said it in a very uncertain manner

10:48.760 --> 10:53.760
because definitely, if He had said it with certainty,

10:54.670 --> 10:57.300
people would never have understood Him.

10:57.720 --> 11:02.630
So He said it is not possible that whatever karmas you are doing

11:03.840 --> 11:06.590
could be the karmas

11:06.840 --> 11:10.840
which will get you the blessings of the Divine....

11:12.590 --> 11:16.760
(MARATHI)... He has said it.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.720
So then, which karmas we should do?

11:21.630 --> 11:23.800
Or should we give up all the karmas?

11:24.510 --> 11:26.670
All the action, we should give up?

11:27.420 --> 11:30.800
People were in two minds.

11:31.300 --> 11:36.340
This is the style of Shri Krishna, is to put people in two minds

11:36.670 --> 11:39.260
so they use their discretion.

11:39.670 --> 11:45.670
And third one is the discretion, which He calls as the Gnyanamarg,

11:46.840 --> 11:50.720
is the central path, by which you evolve.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.880
You evolve into a new state,

11:54.590 --> 11:58.880
into a new state of your mind, a new state of your being,

11:59.550 --> 12:04.510
by which you become

12:07.760 --> 12:11.880
absolutely above every nonsense.

12:12.800 --> 12:18.510
Also you are endowed with power to fight whatever is bad,

12:18.840 --> 12:24.260
whatever is corrupting, whatever is killing this one.

12:26.340 --> 12:32.510
At that stage, you are equipped with a  divine power

12:33.260 --> 12:38.260
that you can finish off anything that is negative around you.

12:41.760 --> 12:47.220
This is to be understood that that’s a state.

12:47.800 --> 12:52.920
That’s not just talking. That’s not just believing that I am that,

12:53.550 --> 12:58.880
but it’s a state. If you come up to that state

12:59.510 --> 13:02.260
where you are beyond all these things

13:03.300 --> 13:07.380
and you have all the knowledge, pure knowledge,

13:07.590 --> 13:11.800
the subtle knowledge of being, this is the Gnyanamarg.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.510
Many people say that

13:16.840 --> 13:20.300
everybody cannot go to Gnyanamarg and, for that, you have to have a

13:20.550 --> 13:22.840
special type of personality,

13:24.920 --> 13:27.550
but this is very misleading.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.510
Everyone can go into Gyanamarg.

13:32.260 --> 13:36.630
It is very, very innately built within us,

13:37.220 --> 13:40.470
this evolutionary attention, attainment.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.590
It is within us and all of us can have that.

13:45.590 --> 13:50.760
Only thing is we have no confidence perhaps

13:51.630 --> 13:54.420
that we go on avoiding it

13:54.760 --> 14:00.630
and go to cheaper things like becoming devoted to something,

14:00.880 --> 14:06.340
doing some sort of a ritual, going to some sort of a holy place,

14:06.590 --> 14:11.630
all kinds of nonsense, which doesn’t give you the evolutionary

14:12.380 --> 14:19.880
ascent by which you know the knowledge,

14:20.340 --> 14:22.800
the pure  knowledge, the real  knowledge.

14:25.510 --> 14:28.840
So far, whatever you have known was written in the book,

14:29.420 --> 14:31.630
whatever your parents told you,

14:31.920 --> 14:34.800
or whatever you have explored outside.

14:35.590 --> 14:39.630
But the knowledge which is the purest,

14:40.220 --> 14:43.630
which is the real knowledge,

14:44.800 --> 14:51.470
which is the gnyana, that you can only get through your ascent

14:51.760 --> 14:58.300
and establish in yourself properly in that state.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.260
If you go on denying it, you cannot make out.

15:02.590 --> 15:07.420
But everyone has right to get it. You need not be educated,

15:08.420 --> 15:11.300
you need not be a very simple person,

15:11.630 --> 15:14.300
you need not be very rich or poor,

15:14.470 --> 15:18.550
makes no difference,  as long as you are a human being

15:18.880 --> 15:21.220
and a humble human being,

15:21.510 --> 15:25.300
thinking that you have to achieve that state.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.670
You all can get that state, which you know very well.

15:31.300 --> 15:36.920
And at that state you become absolutely knowledgeable,

15:38.340 --> 15:41.840
knowledgeable about yourself, knowledgeable about others,

15:42.470 --> 15:45.840
knowledgeable about everything that goes around.

15:46.880 --> 15:52.720
But this state must be maintained and try to go above that state

15:53.920 --> 15:56.880
where you have no more doubts left in you.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.470
This is what Shri Krishna taught

16:01.340 --> 16:03.840
and this is what one has to achieve,

16:04.550 --> 16:08.300
but He, being a diplomat, He tried to

16:08.510 --> 16:13.510
tell you other stories. “Try this, try that, this, that.”

16:14.920 --> 16:19.420
But actually what He has praised is gnyanamarg.

16:20.670 --> 16:24.720
Ours is a gnyanamarg. That is the knowledge,

16:25.470 --> 16:29.510
the path of knowledge in which you have to know all the knowledge.

16:30.550 --> 16:33.880
Unless and until you have the whole knowledge,

16:35.260 --> 16:39.260
you are not yet a gnyani, a person who knows.

16:40.420 --> 16:45.760
In this way, He has established that our evolutionary process

16:46.550 --> 16:53.920
has to come beyond all other human awareness.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.760
Other human awareness

16:57.420 --> 17:01.840
is of a no value for a special  personality.

17:03.340 --> 17:07.720
Now he knows something, say, ‘how many miles it is

17:07.880 --> 17:12.720
from here say to New York or what trains go there’.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.800
All this knowledge is not real

17:16.800 --> 17:21.470
— ‘how much this cloth will cost, how much this carpet will cost,

17:21.720 --> 17:24.380
in what shop you can get. All this knowledge

17:24.630 --> 17:28.220
is just useless, is not the real knowledge.

17:30.760 --> 17:35.470
Such a person doesn’t know this kind of knowledge,

17:36.260 --> 17:40.880
but what he knows is the knowledge about your being,

17:42.260 --> 17:45.420
knowledge about the whole universe,

17:46.380 --> 17:51.420
which is not how many stars there are

17:52.260 --> 17:56.720
or how many universes there are. No

17:58.260 --> 18:00.920
it is the subtle inner

18:02.510 --> 18:05.760
personality of everything, he knows.

18:06.840 --> 18:12.550
In that subtlety, he discovers  so many new things

18:12.920 --> 18:15.380
which he may not even heard about,

18:15.880 --> 18:22.550
and, thus you reach a state of great knowledgeable personality.

18:23.760 --> 18:28.840
This is what we have to achieve. We are born as human beings

18:30.260 --> 18:33.340
and we know so many things already.

18:34.220 --> 18:38.300
People know so many things, but they don’t know the actual.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.670
This knowledge doesn’t come

18:41.220 --> 18:44.220
through your reading or through your

18:44.510 --> 18:48.380
intellectual pursuit or for your emotional movement — no.

18:49.590 --> 18:56.260
It is shaswat.  It is all the time there.

18:57.300 --> 18:59.880
It exists. It will exist.

19:00.670 --> 19:06.340
And it is just to be understood, just to be

19:06.840 --> 19:09.800
known to yourself what it is.

19:10.760 --> 19:15.260
It cannot change. It cannot be remoulded.

19:18.220 --> 19:21.260
It is what it is.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.840
And that is what you know now.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.420
Nobody would doubt that

19:29.880 --> 19:34.510
because those who have got this state, they may doubt,

19:35.300 --> 19:37.880
they may call you crazy, they may think anything,

19:38.550 --> 19:41.840
but with the open eyes, whatever you say (is) the truth.

19:42.630 --> 19:46.800
In the same way, with the open heart and a open brain, when you

19:47.470 --> 19:49.840
know that, that is the real truth

19:50.340 --> 19:53.380
and that is what is to be known.

19:54.380 --> 19:57.800
For that, according to Shri Krishna,

19:58.590 --> 20:04.420
you have to go through various tests.

20:04.920 --> 20:09.720
One is you go on praying to Him.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.920
He says, “You go on praying to Me

20:15.420 --> 20:19.300
and if you give Me flowers I’ll take. If you give Me water I’ll take

20:20.420 --> 20:23.510
Whatever you’ll give Me, I’ll take.”

20:24.670 --> 20:28.420
He says clearly, but

20:31.340 --> 20:37.380
what will you make out of that is very important.

20:38.220 --> 20:39.720
He doesn’t say,

20:39.920 --> 20:43.220
“If you give Me something, I’ll give you something.” That 's it.

20:44.720 --> 20:49.840
So what should be the state?

20:50.720 --> 20:54.590
What should be the condition? He said,

20:55.380 --> 20:57.880
“If you praise Me, if you do bhakti for Me,

20:58.340 --> 21:01.630
you are giving Me presents, you are doing all sorts of things,

21:02.470 --> 21:04.670
you are very dedicated, but

21:06.630 --> 21:12.220
you should do ananyabhakti. Word is ananya.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.590
Ananya means when there is not the other,

21:17.760 --> 21:22.470
when we are one, when we are connected,

21:23.760 --> 21:27.260
then the bhakti you do that time,

21:27.470 --> 21:30.340
whatever music you have of devotion,

21:30.590 --> 21:32.670
whatever flowers you give,

21:32.920 --> 21:35.590
whatever expression you have,

21:36.260 --> 21:37.840
it should be ananya”.

21:38.300 --> 21:41.260
That’s the word He said, that “Do ananya bhakti....

21:43.340 --> 21:47.340
(MARATHI) ...whatever you give Me,  I’ll take”.

21:48.380 --> 21:52.720
He’ll take everything. He’s the one who is the only,

21:53.260 --> 21:55.630
Gopta means He is the only enjoyer.

21:56.260 --> 21:59.380
“But what will you get,”

22:00.670 --> 22:05.260
He says, “when you do ananyabhakti?”

22:06.260 --> 22:08.470
Means ‘when you are one with Me.’

22:09.590 --> 22:12.720
That means you are connected with Him.

22:13.510 --> 22:19.550
That’s how He has explained bhakti, what is bhakti is very clearly.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.800
But people don’t understand.

22:22.300 --> 22:25.420
They think that bhakti means you go on singing

22:25.590 --> 22:29.630
“Hari Rama, Hari Krishna,” this and that, is bhakti. Is not.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.470
If that was real, they would have achieved something,

22:33.590 --> 22:36.880
but they did not. Now don’t blame Krishna for that.

22:37.590 --> 22:41.920
He has clearly said it should be ananyabhakti.

22:42.550 --> 22:46.510
Only by changing your dress, wearing a particular

22:46.800 --> 22:51.590
type of style, that’s not it. That’s all so outward.

22:52.260 --> 22:59.300
It’s just to show off, but actually ananyabhakti is within yourself

22:59.670 --> 23:03.840
when you are within that state when you are one with the Divine.

23:04.630 --> 23:08.760
Unless and until that state you have achieved, not only that,

23:09.300 --> 23:13.380
but have established, it doesn’t give you anything.

23:14.260 --> 23:17.510
Many people have told Me, “We are doing so much

23:17.800 --> 23:20.880
of bhakti yog, Mother. We don’t get anything.”

23:21.510 --> 23:24.260
“Really, what sort of bhakti yog?”

23:24.760 --> 23:28.840
We do — read Shri Krishna’s Gita.

23:29.300 --> 23:34.550
Every morning (we) get up at four o’clock, take bath, read Krishna’s

23:35.920 --> 23:39.670
Gita, do this, do that.Then we sing bhajans, this.

23:40.380 --> 23:42.880
We never get anything.

23:44.670 --> 23:49.720
So what is the reason?”

23:50.720 --> 23:54.760
Reason is that you are not one with God.

23:56.300 --> 24:01.720
And when you are one with God, then what does He give you?

24:03.670 --> 24:10.510
He won’t give you cheap things which will vanish in no time,

24:11.470 --> 24:15.760
but of some eternal nature. So He gives  you

24:17.340 --> 24:21.920
peace, peace of the heart.He gives you balance.

24:23.470 --> 24:29.800
Also He gives you a tranquil temperament,

24:32.380 --> 24:39.880
joy of life. All these things are there within us

24:40.720 --> 24:47.550
if we have the bhakti which is after being united,

24:48.420 --> 24:52.260
after the yoga, with the Yogeshwara.

24:54.420 --> 25:00.550
This is what one has to understand.Now, there are many karma yogis

25:01.590 --> 25:04.880
who go on working mad, absolute madly.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.840
They think we are doing, after all,

25:09.590 --> 25:15.670
without any desire we are serving people,

25:16.300 --> 25:19.840
we are serving the nation, we are serving this.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.590
Ultimately, what do you get?

25:25.760 --> 25:29.300
What you get may be money. Might be you might

25:29.510 --> 25:32.550
get a good house, maybe all these things,

25:33.720 --> 25:36.420
but you don’t get peace of heart.

25:37.300 --> 25:41.720
You don’t get peace of mind. You don’t get that joy,

25:42.630 --> 25:48.800
that joy which has no boundaries, which cannot be explained,

25:50.420 --> 25:53.630
which cannot be described,

25:54.670 --> 25:58.420
that boundless joy, you don’t have.

25:59.800 --> 26:04.340
And you don’t get that eternal peace,

26:05.420 --> 26:07.510
which can stop wars.

26:09.260 --> 26:12.550
Completely, it can abolish this

26:12.920 --> 26:15.920
cruel nature of human beings.

26:16.880 --> 26:21.300
That you don’t get.  But apart from that,

26:21.880 --> 26:25.590
you get the powers.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.260
You get the knowledge —

26:29.510 --> 26:32.760
knowledge, the subtle knowledge about everyone.

26:33.800 --> 26:38.510
You know about everyone, where are they missing the point.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.380
You know about yourself and about others.

26:44.420 --> 26:49.380
This knowledge you get, not in the college or in the schools,

26:50.220 --> 26:53.880
but within yourself is the ocean of knowledge

26:54.800 --> 26:59.800
and whichever way you want to see, whichever you want to achieve,

27:00.590 --> 27:03.920
is there, there present.

27:05.260 --> 27:09.760
That is what is the real knowledge, what we call

27:10.630 --> 27:12.880
that you achieve through the

27:13.670 --> 27:16.840
sukshagnyana means the subtle knowledge,

27:17.510 --> 27:21.550
knowledge about chakras, knowledge

27:21.760 --> 27:26.260
about the universe. Everything you can get out of this.

27:26.550 --> 27:32.420
But then you get more interested in giving knowledge to others.

27:33.470 --> 27:35.840
You don’t want to know so many thing then.

27:36.550 --> 27:40.840
What is the need to know about banking,

27:41.380 --> 27:46.470
say, about who is the richest man in the whole world?

27:46.800 --> 27:51.920
All these things you don’t want to know. Your whole attitude changes

27:52.670 --> 27:58.760
and what you get is nothing but a kind of a tranquil mind

27:59.420 --> 28:02.760
which knows everything that is to be known..

28:04.590 --> 28:06.920
That is what one has to achieve

28:07.760 --> 28:12.670
Now this country of yours, America, is very kharmakandi.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.720
It goes on doing work, work, work. They’re workaholics.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.760
They work so hard and what do you get?

28:23.470 --> 28:25.920
You get children who are drug addicts.

28:26.720 --> 28:29.470
You get wives who are running here and there.

28:29.840 --> 28:35.510
You get broken families and no peace.

28:37.260 --> 28:39.590
You support wars.

28:40.670 --> 28:47.720
Only thing is that so far this country is being protected in a way,

28:48.920 --> 28:53.420
but also you have destroyed so many aboriginals,

28:54.340 --> 28:58.720
so many fundamental things that you should have preserved.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.720
A day may come when they will realise

29:03.300 --> 29:07.340
that this is what they have been doing and this was really wrong.

29:07.800 --> 29:13.880
A day will come when we’ll have so many Realised Souls in America.

29:15.590 --> 29:21.920
But just now the situation is (that) the people are just gone

29:23.340 --> 29:26.920
mad with the idea of making money

29:28.510 --> 29:31.590
and they discover that ‘Now no more, finished.

29:33.420 --> 29:39.300
So now what to do?’ What to do? Come to Sahaja Yoga.

29:41.470 --> 29:47.550
Do Sahaj Yoga and then you will get the treasures of your being

29:48.510 --> 29:53.340
which are within you, which will give you all the comfort,

29:53.760 --> 29:59.840
all the joy and all the supremacy that any

30:00.920 --> 30:04.550
amount of money, any amount of power can’t give.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.260
This is what we have to do,

30:08.760 --> 30:13.420
is to take to Sahaja Yoga and make others also Sahaja Yogis

30:13.840 --> 30:18.760
so that they also get that peace, joy and satisfaction;

30:19.920 --> 30:23.800
and this madness of running from one thing to another

30:24.260 --> 30:29.300
will be finished because you can never be satisfied with that.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.670
Want to buy today one thing, then tomorrow want another thing,

30:34.260 --> 30:37.800
then want to doing another thing. You are never satisfied.

30:38.720 --> 30:42.380
You don’t get any joy out of what you are desiring.

30:42.880 --> 30:48.260
So your pure desire, it should be to be one with the Divine.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.470
That is how it will work out.

30:53.340 --> 30:56.300
Shri Krishna’s specialty was that

30:58.220 --> 31:01.920
He always supported people who were Realised Souls,

31:02.470 --> 31:06.420
who were on the right path, who were doing righteous things.

31:07.550 --> 31:09.920
He would never support anybody

31:10.510 --> 31:14.510
who may be well off, who may be great thing.

31:14.920 --> 31:17.800
Like a great king was Duryodhana.

31:19.550 --> 31:22.840
He invited Shri Krishna to his house,

31:23.760 --> 31:28.550
to his big palace to be his guest.

31:29.720 --> 31:35.630
Shri Krishna said, “I am sorry.” He went to Vidura,

31:35.800 --> 31:42.800
who was the son of a maid, Dasaputra,

31:44.420 --> 31:50.720
because Vidura was a Realised Soul. Because he was a Realised Soul,

31:51.300 --> 31:55.340
to Him he was much higher, much greater

31:55.550 --> 31:58.920
than Duryodhana – who was a ruler because he was a crook,

31:59.590 --> 32:01.670
because he was a bad man.

32:02.590 --> 32:06.550
So the discrimination between good and bad

32:07.470 --> 32:10.220
becomes one in your mind,

32:10.590 --> 32:16.720
becomes one of your inner temperament,

32:18.380 --> 32:21.420
then you are always very much satisfied

32:22.420 --> 32:26.630
because you know you are not been doing

32:27.380 --> 32:29.670
something that is wrong.

32:30.840 --> 32:34.920
The discrimination is the gift of Shri Krishna.

32:36.550 --> 32:42.300
Apart from anything else, He gives us the gift of discrimination.

32:43.800 --> 32:50.630
That is His style, I should say, to teach you how to discriminate

32:51.260 --> 32:56.300
and then you become experts on discrimination, on vibrations.

32:57.760 --> 33:02.380
On vibrations, you can judge everything so clearly,

33:03.300 --> 33:06.380
so beautifully.  Others may not agree with you,

33:06.550 --> 33:08.920
that’s a different point; but you know

33:09.300 --> 33:10.920
what is right and what is wrong.

33:12.260 --> 33:15.470
And that is what Shri Krishna’s gift is.

33:16.260 --> 33:21.470
As it is, you know He is controlling sixteen sub-chakras within us.

33:22.380 --> 33:28.420
He controls everything. He controls your throat, nose, eyes, ears.

33:30.840 --> 33:35.920
All these things He controls, but ultimately, what does He say?

33:38.880 --> 33:44.470
He says He is the Virat. Virat means the one who is the great,

33:44.880 --> 33:49.510
great lord,

33:51.840 --> 33:56.760
what we call “akbar” and that’s what in the Muslim

33:57.760 --> 34:01.470
thing  they accept that Allahu Akbar.

34:01.760 --> 34:04.590
I mean, because it is in a poetry, it’s partly

34:04.920 --> 34:09.550
clear, partly not clear, but He was a Virata

34:10.260 --> 34:13.840
and He showed His form to Arjuna

34:14.800 --> 34:20.470
and Arjuna was amazed to see His form, that He’s the Virata.

34:21.300 --> 34:26.720
He’s the one who is great, absorbing everything

34:27.340 --> 34:30.720
and He’s the one who is taking out everything.

34:31.380 --> 34:37.420
He’s a Yama. He is the one who is the god of death.

34:38.510 --> 34:42.880
He’s so many. You know His names are there written down.

34:43.720 --> 34:46.470
All these powers are with you,

34:46.920 --> 34:51.260
which He uses wherever it is needed.

34:52.380 --> 34:56.380
So the Sahaja Yogis first have the power of satisfaction.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.840
It’s tremendous practice, satisfaction.

34:59.380 --> 35:01.800
Imagine in this place,

35:02.340 --> 35:06.510
you are all enjoying so much, you are living here so happy.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.380
Shows what? You are so satisfied.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.420
Otherwise nobody would like.

35:11.630 --> 35:14.840
They would say, “No, we want some nice place. What is this?

35:15.300 --> 35:19.380
We don’t want to live here with everyone.” But to live with others,

35:19.510 --> 35:23.800
this collectivity also is the blessing of Shri Krishna.

35:24.920 --> 35:29.510
He teaches you to be collective, the fun of collectivity,

35:29.760 --> 35:33.920
the enjoyment of collectivity. A person who is secluded,

35:34.510 --> 35:36.840
who keeps himself off like a drunkard

35:37.300 --> 35:40.260
is not  the one who worships Shri Krishna.

35:40.510 --> 35:44.510
The one who is one with Shri Krishna enjoys everyone

35:45.340 --> 35:49.340
who are there, specially if they are all Realised Souls,

35:49.630 --> 35:52.510
that person enjoys their company very much.

35:52.920 --> 35:57.630
That is something so easily understood in your lives

35:57.840 --> 36:01.760
if you see how you live happily, morally,

36:02.300 --> 36:07.260
absolutely perfect; in no way you do anything immoral

36:07.550 --> 36:13.420
steal anything or have bad feelings for other people.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.420
It’s something surprising that has happened to you,

36:16.630 --> 36:18.920
that you are all living so happily

36:19.670 --> 36:23.800
in one place together with satya.

36:25.630 --> 36:29.510
His collectivity is to be understood

36:29.760 --> 36:32.420
because I always say

36:32.590 --> 36:35.590
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America.

36:36.670 --> 36:39.380
America is also very collective.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.920
Like it will be interested in every country.

36:43.550 --> 36:45.880
It will be bothered about everyone,

36:46.470 --> 36:48.720
but in a wrong way tries to help.

36:49.340 --> 36:52.510
Always it is never in the right way.

36:53.260 --> 36:55.420
Now, supposing there is a country where

36:55.550 --> 36:57.720
they are producing a lot of drugs.

36:57.920 --> 37:01.840
Why not invade that country, instead of invading other countries.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.260
He’s like that. Discrimination is missing.

37:06.840 --> 37:09.340
Unless and until you have that,

37:09.550 --> 37:12.670
you cannot use your power of collectivity properly.

37:13.420 --> 37:16.760
Though they are collective, but what collective work have they done?

37:17.340 --> 37:20.720
Even now, they want to say they are separate, they are different.

37:21.220 --> 37:23.550
“Whatever problems we are facing are our own.”

37:24.590 --> 37:29.630
So this collectivity has been so much minimised

37:29.920 --> 37:32.670
in a country of Shri Krishna itself.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.340
Though they have that within themselves,

37:36.630 --> 37:40.420
a feeling that they should talk about every country,

37:40.670 --> 37:43.340
they should give lead to every country,

37:43.590 --> 37:46.300
they should consult every country, but

37:46.590 --> 37:51.340
always take a wrong decision about those countries.

37:51.670 --> 37:55.260
This comes because they are not discriminating.

37:55.760 --> 37:58.260
They should be discriminating.

37:58.590 --> 38:02.880
So many things can be said about Vishuddhi chakra,

38:03.760 --> 38:09.880
but specially I am more concerned about two chakras on two sides.

38:10.340 --> 38:14.510
One of them is, as you know, is the Lalita chakra on left side

38:14.720 --> 38:17.220
and Shri chakra on the right side.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.380
I’ve always told ladies that

38:20.630 --> 38:22.760
please keep this covered.

38:23.260 --> 38:26.300
It looks so simple. It’s very important.

38:26.880 --> 38:32.630
Don’t expose this because power of this should be preserved —

38:33.380 --> 38:38.420
Shri chakra and Lalita chakra, they’re very important.

38:39.340 --> 38:41.800
They are, I should say, feminine powers

38:42.630 --> 38:46.590
and they are the feminine powers of Shri Krishna,

38:47.630 --> 38:52.920
which must be understood that whatever way you respect your body,

38:53.420 --> 38:57.880
that is the way your chakras are and that is the way you suffer.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.880
For example, (if) you do not respect Shri Ganesha, you will suffer.

39:05.550 --> 39:08.590
And if you respect Ganesha and do not behave in a manner

39:08.760 --> 39:12.550
that you should behave, you will suffer. You’ll have problems.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.720
So the whole body reacts.

39:16.880 --> 39:24.340
Body reacts to outside influences in such a manner

39:24.920 --> 39:27.760
that you start seeing there is something wrong

39:29.510 --> 39:33.470
somewhere and that’s why you behave like this.

39:39.670 --> 39:46.300
Apart from that, eyes are supplied by this chakra,

39:48.380 --> 39:55.590
so when you look at something, it should be very pure glance.

39:56.340 --> 39:59.800
The purer it is, the better you will enjoy.

40:00.670 --> 40:04.800
But if the glance is not pure,

40:05.670 --> 40:10.800
is shifty, going from here to there, there to there,

40:12.380 --> 40:18.760
then you are actually going against your dharma,

40:19.220 --> 40:23.260
against your evolutionary process and one day will come

40:23.470 --> 40:27.720
when you might become blind, you might develop cataracts.

40:28.220 --> 40:31.510
You might develop all kinds of diseases of the eyes,

40:33.470 --> 40:37.420
which are very important to pay attention to it.

40:38.470 --> 40:43.510
Then this connect(ion) also goes to the tongue.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.340
The tongue is looked after,

40:48.880 --> 40:51.380
but those people have a very bad habit

40:51.630 --> 40:56.630
of suddenly saying horrible things, of suddenly saying

40:57.260 --> 41:02.550
very bad words or sometimes getting after somebody

41:02.760 --> 41:05.380
with the very bad remarks.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.920
All such things are very bad for the tongue

41:09.630 --> 41:12.220
and this is what Shri Krishna doesn’t like.

41:12.800 --> 41:17.300
In case you use your tongue for saying harsh things to others,

41:17.510 --> 41:23.550
being sarcastic, being harsh on others,

41:24.340 --> 41:26.630
using abusive word,

41:27.510 --> 41:32.800
your tongue, one day, I don’t know how it will react.

41:34.510 --> 41:36.630
It will react in different ways.

41:37.260 --> 41:39.880
God knows, it might become thick. It won’t move.

41:40.550 --> 41:42.840
God knows, it might be sucked inside.

41:43.470 --> 41:47.470
That’s the physical side of it, but also mental side of it,

41:47.840 --> 41:50.510
that you will [not] know what you are talking about.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.670
If you say something, you’ll say something else.

41:54.550 --> 41:59.300
It’s possible with your tongue. It’s quite possible

41:59.550 --> 42:04.420
that we may not be able to talk, may not be able to say anything.

42:04.630 --> 42:11.300
Anything is possible if you try to trouble

42:11.720 --> 42:16.470
your tongue like that, using it for wrong purposes.

42:16.920 --> 42:24.300
Tongue is not for being used for

42:24.550 --> 42:30.380
abusive things,as well as for — some people try to be

42:30.590 --> 42:35.470
extra kind and gentle and this and that

42:35.920 --> 42:38.670
to achieve some ends.

42:39.630 --> 42:44.260
This kind of thing also is very, very much — is dangerous

42:44.720 --> 42:48.300
for the tongue and you might develop blisters on your tongue

42:48.800 --> 42:52.340
to such an extent that people who even

42:52.920 --> 42:56.220
go on saying harsh things to others and all that

42:57.220 --> 43:01.510
can develop a kind of a cancer.

43:02.840 --> 43:07.630
Some people think that if you bear up everything is good. Is not.

43:08.590 --> 43:12.880
If somebody is trying to oppress you, don’t try to bear it.

43:13.550 --> 43:17.550
Throw it away because if you bear also,

43:17.880 --> 43:21.800
you can move to the left and you can get horrible things

43:22.380 --> 43:26.260
like cancer. You can get cancer.

43:26.800 --> 43:29.920
Those who are aggressive, they can get also diseases;

43:30.340 --> 43:33.920
and those (who) are very much, I should say,

43:34.510 --> 43:37.510
bearing type also get into trouble.

43:38.380 --> 43:41.630
So you should be in a balanced state,

43:42.300 --> 43:44.470
should not accept anything.

43:45.380 --> 43:48.760
Supposing anybody calls you name just keep quiet look at that person

43:48.920 --> 43:51.880
that’s all. Know that he’s a stupid fool.

43:52.590 --> 43:54.420
But don’t accept it.

43:54.720 --> 43:58.670
If you accept it and go on crying about it and weeping about it,

43:59.760 --> 44:03.380
then you can get cancer. But supposing

44:03.840 --> 44:06.590
somebody says something, you should know (he) is a stupid fool,

44:06.800 --> 44:09.720
just keep out of it, then nothing can happen.

44:11.800 --> 44:16.220
So both ways one has to be careful because Krishna is

44:16.670 --> 44:20.590
playing around and He sees how far you can go.

44:23.260 --> 44:28.880
Now throat — throat is very important. We should look after it.

44:31.300 --> 44:34.470
Those people who shout,

44:36.220 --> 44:40.840
scream ultimately can lose their power of speech,

44:41.920 --> 44:48.220
can become frantic with their problems of the throat,

44:48.840 --> 44:51.840
specially throat can develop horrible disease

44:52.840 --> 44:58.340
by which you just — they can just get swollen up.

44:59.220 --> 45:02.840
We call it snake disease

45:03.720 --> 45:09.340
and you feel suffocated. So when you talk to someone, talk clearly,

45:09.800 --> 45:15.590
in a sweet manner, but don’t shout at the person, never.

45:16.420 --> 45:19.840
Neither you try to show peevishness in your speech.

45:21.380 --> 45:24.760
If you are peevish, then cancer can set in.

45:25.550 --> 45:28.840
So both ways you have to be careful, as you are Sahaja Yogis.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.220
You have to have this knowledge,

45:31.590 --> 45:35.420
that you will not do, bear anything nonsensical if anybody speaks —

45:35.840 --> 45:38.220
means you should not accept it.

45:38.380 --> 45:40.720
One may say something to you. It’s all right.

45:41.260 --> 45:43.260
And sometimes you should tell him off

45:43.470 --> 45:45.840
that “You were saying like this, (it) is not so.”

45:46.590 --> 45:50.800
It’s best is not to bear it up and to suffer.

45:51.300 --> 45:53.920
You’re not Christ. You don’t have His powers.

45:55.300 --> 45:57.880
Because if you do that, you’ll develop cancer.

45:58.800 --> 46:03.300
So try to be in a way just in the centre,

46:04.670 --> 46:07.800
watching everything, if there’s aggression

46:08.220 --> 46:12.340
or if there’s recession (reception) —one of the two things

46:12.920 --> 46:16.760
you must not give in to any of these attitudes,

46:16.880 --> 46:19.760
but develop an attitude  of standing

46:20.380 --> 46:22.920
very firmly on your own grounds.

46:23.670 --> 46:27.840
For example, there was a Chinese story I read

46:28.590 --> 46:32.380
that there once — a king wanted his

46:32.590 --> 46:35.300
two cocks to win in a race,

46:35.760 --> 46:38.840
so they said you send them to a sage and train them up.

46:39.550 --> 46:43.420
So he has sent them to a sage. They were trained very well.

46:43.920 --> 46:49.470
And when they were brought, they stood in the arena

46:50.340 --> 46:53.840
and many cocks were there, who started attacking them,

46:54.670 --> 46:57.670
but these two were standing like this, least bothered.

46:58.920 --> 47:02.550
They tried and tried, but these two were standing like this.

47:04.470 --> 47:07.220
As a result, all of them ran away.

47:07.920 --> 47:10.470
So that’s what is the character you should have.

47:10.920 --> 47:14.340
Is not to bend to something because somebody is aggressive

47:14.720 --> 47:19.920
and also not to aggress others,

47:20.840 --> 47:24.800
not to torture other, not to sit on somebody’s head.

47:24.920 --> 47:27.760
It’s very, very dangerous  for your throat

47:28.260 --> 47:31.630
and such a throat will always, will always be in danger

47:31.880 --> 47:34.420
of getting some horrible diseases.

47:35.380 --> 47:39.800
All this I’ve told you because so many things we know about,

47:40.260 --> 47:42.800
we should reach it. We have

47:43.380 --> 47:46.340
— but we have very subtle knowledge about  Vishuddhi chakra.

47:46.630 --> 47:48.590
We should also have little gross,

47:48.800 --> 47:50.920
that what can happen to our Vishuddhi chakra

47:51.510 --> 47:54.380
if we try not to look after it.

47:56.630 --> 48:01.720
So this is what is Shri Krishna’s work. Also teeth He looks after.

48:02.800 --> 48:06.470
Ears He looks after. You know what is to be done

48:06.720 --> 48:12.300
about the teeth and the ears. These are His own sixteen —

48:14.840 --> 48:19.670
we can say — works. We can call them as karias, sixteen

48:20.340 --> 48:24.380
on which He works on different, different levels.

48:24.840 --> 48:29.840
And you must try to develop our powers of our

48:31.510 --> 48:36.590
Vishuddhi chakra by so many ways and

48:36.880 --> 48:41.550
so many exercises, by understanding

48:42.300 --> 48:46.760
what goes wrong with us when we do not understand

48:46.880 --> 48:50.220
and value our Vishuddhi chakra.

48:51.220 --> 48:54.800
Now America is the Vishuddhi of the whole world,

48:55.800 --> 48:59.840
so it is very important that the people who are in charge here

49:00.550 --> 49:04.880
should know all the powers of Vishuddhi,

49:05.550 --> 49:07.920
plus how to preserve it

49:08.800 --> 49:12.880
and how to expand it

49:13.420 --> 49:16.550
to the whole world. With these two hands

49:16.840 --> 49:18.880
also are from Vishuddhi chakra

49:19.470 --> 49:23.300
and, with that, you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

49:24.300 --> 49:27.880
You have to go to different worlds, different countries,

49:28.720 --> 49:33.840
to — even to small villages you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

49:34.550 --> 49:37.920
Only in the hands first, you see the cool breeze.

49:38.670 --> 49:45.420
That means it is you feel the universal

49:47.800 --> 49:50.670
power of the Divine in your life.

49:50.920 --> 49:54.470
So this is the collective, universal love

49:54.880 --> 49:57.880
that comes to your hand and teaches you.

49:58.760 --> 50:01.760
So it’s such an important chakra is this.

50:02.300 --> 50:05.470
In the same way, America’s very important

50:05.670 --> 50:08.760
and, as citizens of America, you should try

50:08.920 --> 50:12.550
to maintain the religion the dharma here

50:12.720 --> 50:17.920
and to create a great understanding

50:18.670 --> 50:23.920
for world problems and try to give love

50:24.550 --> 50:28.920
to all the people from whatever country they will be coming.

50:30.260 --> 50:31.920
May God bless you all.
