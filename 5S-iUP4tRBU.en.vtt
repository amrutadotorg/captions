00:05:00.496 --> 00:05:06.856
I'm telling them about love, all-pervading
love of God Almighty.

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:10.826
He's created this whole thing.

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:14.786
The whole atmosphere is there.

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:19.385
The whole feeling is there of love.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:27.006
But it's possible only for people who are
innocent, like children.

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:33.176
If you are very mature in your hatred, no
one can save you.

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:38.005
You'll have ten arguments to show that your
hatred is justifiable.

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:43.566
Then you'll go to any extent to justify it.

00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:51.376
We had people in our country, which is a very,
supposed to be a very, sober country, a very

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:58.095
peaceful country, we had people who just believe
in killing - kill this, kill that.

00:05:58.095 --> 00:06:06.766
So even in this country, which didn't believe
in all these things, indulged into all kinds

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:10.446
of violence since long.

00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:21.116
But basically we are people who believe in
peace, because without peace no growth can

00:06:21.116 --> 00:06:22.216
take place.

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:24.116
There has to be complete peace.

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:32.466
If there is peace in your heart, if there
is peace surrounding you, you grow into a

00:06:32.466 --> 00:06:35.336
beautiful nation.

00:06:35.336 --> 00:06:50.636
Not out of fear, not out of pressure, but
from inside; if you are a person who has complete

00:06:50.636 --> 00:06:58.436
peace within the heart, not that he is not
afraid of anything, but he emits peace.

00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:01.406
He gives peace.

00:07:01.406 --> 00:07:07.805
Anybody who goes near such a person, gets
the peace, the feeling of peacefulness.

00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:10.826
You all are Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:13.976
You all have got your Realization.

00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:22.046
That is, your spirit is now emitting vibrations
of peace and joy.

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:29.166
Wherever you are, you will emit peaceful vibrations.

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:31.675
You will create peace.

00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:41.356
You'll find out ways of creating peace, how
to establish peaceful atmosphere.

00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:51.856
It's very important that we have to grow in
such a manner that we create peace and give

00:07:51.856 --> 00:07:56.115
peace to others and become examples of it.

00:07:56.115 --> 00:08:05.686
I cannot believe in this Delhi I could have
so many people who are realised souls.

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:08.046
I never expected.

00:08:08.046 --> 00:08:21.686
First of all, I had to wait until people got
into a proper mind to understand My work,

00:08:21.686 --> 00:08:30.826
because we had partition and so many people
lost their lives, lost their properties and

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:31.826
I have faced all that.

00:08:31.826 --> 00:08:39.925
I have seen it Myself and they just couldn't;
couldn't forgive other people.

00:08:39.925 --> 00:08:53.496
So forgiveness is a very good method of understanding
the pain of others; troubles of others, but

00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:56.466
this depth you have to develop.

00:08:56.466 --> 00:09:07.115
Instead of getting angry, getting revengeful,
if you can develop that peace within yourself,

00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:17.406
if you can manage to have the peace of your
mind through Divine love, there's no need

00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:20.966
for you to do anything extra.

00:09:20.966 --> 00:09:26.746
It's just the peace that you have, now, in
your heart.

00:09:26.746 --> 00:09:28.736
Just feel it.

00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:31.706
You are a peaceful person.

00:09:31.706 --> 00:09:37.966
You are not a person who is easily disturbed.

00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:43.489
You will never give explanations for getting
angry, for spoiling the mood of people.

00:09:43.489 --> 00:09:44.489
You will not do that.

00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:55.256
You are the ones who rise above all this anger
and this stupid revengefulness.

00:09:55.256 --> 00:10:05.006
It is difficult to explain to those people
who are not Realized Souls, because if I talk

00:10:05.006 --> 00:10:06.956
to them, they won't like it.

00:10:06.956 --> 00:10:11.515
If they get their realisation, we can talk
to them.

00:10:11.515 --> 00:10:15.355
So best thing you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:15.355 --> 00:10:24.765
Spread it among Sikhs, among Muslims, among
Christians, throughout, and especially among

00:10:24.765 --> 00:10:33.765
Hindus because nowadays I find Hindus are
also, have lost their grip over their understanding

00:10:33.765 --> 00:10:43.765
of our country and its culture and that's
how they just revenge, they take revenge.

00:10:43.765 --> 00:10:48.436
I don't understand this kind of revenge but
what to do?

00:10:48.436 --> 00:10:57.135
People are already on that level, on that
low level, where they don't understand many

00:10:57.135 --> 00:10:58.135
things.

00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:09.665
For example now, they do not want people to
build a temple of Shri Rama at a particular

00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:10.665
point.

00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:16.776
Because they are not Sahaja Yogis, I can't
talk to them that that is the place where

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:18.686
He was born.

00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:22.165
So we must pay full respect to His incarnation.

00:11:22.165 --> 00:11:32.256
If that is the place He was born, we can feel
it with the vibrations, then why deny the

00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:37.806
fact and the truth just because you don't
want it to be done?

00:11:37.806 --> 00:11:42.156
It's very difficult to talk to them.

00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:50.385
What to understand is that, what has Babar
done for us?

00:11:50.385 --> 00:11:51.676
Who was Babar?

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:58.355
He was a foreigner and this one was not even
built by Babar.

00:11:58.355 --> 00:12:01.345
No, it was not.

00:12:01.345 --> 00:12:09.445
It was somebody who was his - one of the military
man who went and built it and that's why they

00:12:09.445 --> 00:12:11.346
call it a Babri Masjid.

00:12:11.346 --> 00:12:19.165
But let us find out what happened to this
Mr. Babar.

00:12:19.165 --> 00:12:25.135
He died, but he came from abroad.

00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:28.396
He was not even an Indian.

00:12:28.396 --> 00:12:31.056
And doesn't matter, he was not born there.

00:12:31.056 --> 00:12:38.746
I mean, he had nothing to do with that place,
but definitely I know and you all will know,

00:12:38.746 --> 00:12:47.045
can feel it all on your hands just now that
it is Babri Masjid, is the place where Shri

00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:49.355
Rama was born.

00:12:49.355 --> 00:12:56.746
Now, if you want to build a temple there,
what will go wrong with people?

00:12:56.746 --> 00:13:00.075
What will happen to them if a temple is built
there?

00:13:00.075 --> 00:13:07.736
I mean it is just a question of respect and
feelings about it.

00:13:07.736 --> 00:13:15.036
I also take Rama's name; everybody takes His
name because such a solace and such a comfort.

00:13:15.036 --> 00:13:21.875
But the way people look at things, it's difficult,
you can't talk to them.

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:34.816
Now they are talking about another nonsense
that we have one hair of Mohammed-sahib in

00:13:34.816 --> 00:13:37.105
Kashmir.

00:13:37.105 --> 00:13:40.676
Now somebody said that it is not His hair.

00:13:40.676 --> 00:13:43.456
How do you know?

00:13:43.456 --> 00:13:47.976
What is your criterion to decide whose hair
it is?

00:13:47.976 --> 00:13:54.916
Actually, you will be amazed, when I went
to Kashmir; we were going somewhere in the

00:13:54.916 --> 00:13:59.856
car and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations.

00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:03.887
So I asked the driver, "Why don't you take
the car on this side?"

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:04.887
He said, "Why?"

00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:05.887
"Because I want to go."

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:12.655
He said, "It is an old road and there are
some few people living there."

00:14:12.655 --> 00:14:14.626
"It doesn't matter.

00:14:14.626 --> 00:14:15.946
Take it."

00:14:15.946 --> 00:14:26.486
We went near and nearer and there were some
houses of Muslims, so we called them and asked

00:14:26.486 --> 00:14:29.656
them, "What is here going on?"

00:14:29.656 --> 00:14:35.476
They said, "It is Hazrat Bal."

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:40.016
Even the name gives you such peace.

00:14:40.016 --> 00:14:43.446
It was the hair of Muhammed-sahib.

00:14:43.446 --> 00:14:50.686
Now Hindus don't want to know about Him and
Muslims don't want to know about Shri Ram.

00:14:50.686 --> 00:14:53.866
It's very surprising.

00:14:53.866 --> 00:15:01.446
They are all having their own shops and selling
there own things, but they don't understand

00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:07.316
that whatever they are selling is the same
which the other people are selling.

00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:09.366
For example, they say, "Allah."

00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:11.085
Who is Allah?

00:15:11.085 --> 00:15:22.416
According to Sahaj Yoga, Allah is nobody else
but Vishnu and Vishnu who came also as Shri

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:24.775
Ram.

00:15:24.775 --> 00:15:31.866
So whatever they call as Allah is Shri Ram
Himself.

00:15:31.866 --> 00:15:34.686
Only a Sahaj Yogi can understand that.

00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:40.126
If you put up your hands now when I am talking,
you will be surprised what vibrations are

00:15:40.126 --> 00:15:52.236
there because it is Shri Ram, who is Allah,
whom you are trying to insult by your stupidity.

00:15:52.236 --> 00:15:59.746
So it could be stupidity on part of Muhammed-sahib
or on part of Hindus.

00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:03.546
Hindus are also not understanding.

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:09.366
Somehow they know that is the birthplace of
Shri Ram.

00:16:09.366 --> 00:16:12.955
Somehow, I don't know, somebody must have
told them.

00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:15.746
Or maybe - I don't know how they know - they
don't know vibrations.

00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:26.186
I haven't yet met many Hindus who have vibration
- I mean those who are what you can call fundamentalist.

00:16:26.186 --> 00:16:27.566
They never have vibrations.

00:16:27.566 --> 00:16:32.936
So I used to wonder, how do they know this
is the janma bhoomi of Shri Rama?

00:16:32.936 --> 00:16:35.336
Maybe, somehow they come to know.

00:16:35.336 --> 00:16:38.246
But they have no point to prove.

00:16:38.246 --> 00:16:46.166
The problem is if they were Realized Souls,
if our high court judges were Realized Souls,

00:16:46.166 --> 00:16:53.385
if our cabinet were Realized Souls, you could
have talked to them.

00:16:53.385 --> 00:16:59.265
But they are all - what should I say?

00:16:59.265 --> 00:17:02.596
- Absolutely blocked people.

00:17:02.596 --> 00:17:06.786
How to tell them that this quarrel is a nonsense?

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:14.796
It is perfectly all right to build a temple
of Shri Ram.

00:17:14.796 --> 00:17:22.286
But whatever you may say, the trouble is first
they all should get their Self Realization.

00:17:22.286 --> 00:17:30.676
Just now, at the time when we are talking,
see, there are not sufficient people who have

00:17:30.676 --> 00:17:32.335
got Self Realization.

00:17:32.335 --> 00:17:35.366
You are all Realized Souls.

00:17:35.366 --> 00:17:45.226
There was another one who told Me, who was
giving Realization to these mahantas - mahantas

00:17:45.226 --> 00:17:52.476
are the people who are suppose to be saints
- and every one of them, when they got Realization,

00:17:52.476 --> 00:17:58.575
they got exposed, so he didn't know what to
do with them.

00:17:58.575 --> 00:18:05.645
That may happen with anyone, even in Christian
churches or you go to Jews - everywhere you'll

00:18:05.645 --> 00:18:07.856
find this is the problem.

00:18:07.856 --> 00:18:14.395
If you give them Realization, they'll get
exposed.

00:18:14.395 --> 00:18:24.266
So what's the use of disturbing all the people
who have such faith in them and think they're

00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:26.786
very great people.

00:18:26.786 --> 00:18:32.205
Now only way you can judge them is through
vibrations.

00:18:32.205 --> 00:18:38.246
But out of love, I can't tell them that "You
are not Realized Souls.

00:18:38.246 --> 00:18:43.645
You have no business to talk about Shri Ram
or about Mohammed-sahib.

00:18:43.645 --> 00:18:45.186
They're much beyond you."

00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:58.025
So the problem now is between the people who
are not knowledgeable and those who are knowledgeable.

00:18:58.025 --> 00:19:00.986
It was a very big gap before.

00:19:00.986 --> 00:19:08.236
Only one person used to be a Realized Soul;
so they used to stone him, beat him, do all

00:19:08.236 --> 00:19:09.715
kinds of things.

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:12.996
Now you are so many.

00:19:12.996 --> 00:19:21.357
So, if you put up your case anywhere, even
at this stage, nobody is going to listen to

00:19:21.357 --> 00:19:22.357
you.

00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:23.357
I would request you only one thing.

00:19:23.357 --> 00:19:33.015
Give Realization to people, as many as possible,
and not to any 'spiritual' so-called people.

00:19:33.015 --> 00:19:35.585
Because they get exposed, what's the use?

00:19:35.585 --> 00:19:39.356
This is a common thing.

00:19:39.356 --> 00:19:44.036
So many people have told Me, "We gave Realization
to one priest.

00:19:44.036 --> 00:19:45.036
He got exposed."

00:19:45.036 --> 00:19:47.296
"Means, what happened?"

00:19:47.296 --> 00:19:49.476
"He was exposed, Mother.

00:19:49.476 --> 00:19:52.195
He was put in jail."

00:19:52.195 --> 00:19:54.926
"Aiy, this is too much.

00:19:54.926 --> 00:19:58.405
After getting Realisation, he goes to jail."

00:19:58.405 --> 00:19:59.715
So this is the problem.

00:19:59.715 --> 00:20:04.346
In love, you cannot be hypocritical about
it.

00:20:04.346 --> 00:20:08.046
Love - you have to be a pure personality.

00:20:08.046 --> 00:20:10.965
Must try to purify yourself.

00:20:10.965 --> 00:20:11.965
You have to change.

00:20:11.965 --> 00:20:19.265
If you are still angry, if you are still greedy,
if you have all these things, love won't work

00:20:19.265 --> 00:20:20.265
out.

00:20:20.265 --> 00:20:21.395
It won't work out.

00:20:21.395 --> 00:20:29.715
So to love someone in a Divine way is to first
understand the value of innocence.

00:20:29.715 --> 00:20:33.525
Why I love children?

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:36.395
Because they're innocent.

00:20:36.395 --> 00:20:38.566
They don't have all these things.

00:20:38.566 --> 00:20:50.116
Like in our country these days, the epidemic
- epidemic of corruption has started - epidemic.

00:20:50.116 --> 00:20:54.335
It's not simple.

00:20:54.335 --> 00:21:02.226
Anybody you see, after every third person,
there's an epidemic of corruption.

00:21:02.226 --> 00:21:03.976
Now why?

00:21:03.976 --> 00:21:07.476
Because they want money.

00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:09.226
All right.

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:11.686
Then what do they do with their money?

00:21:11.686 --> 00:21:21.135
They don't know how to hide, so they put it
in some sort of a pot or whatever it is and

00:21:21.135 --> 00:21:25.215
the money gets lost.

00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:27.356
If not, they are caught up.

00:21:27.356 --> 00:21:30.575
That's not so important.

00:21:30.575 --> 00:21:35.976
What's important is, 'Why have this greed?'

00:21:35.976 --> 00:21:43.916
People who are rich are more greedy than the
people who are poor, because the poor people

00:21:43.916 --> 00:21:46.126
at least have some fear of God.

00:21:46.126 --> 00:21:51.486
But the rich are very greedy.

00:21:51.486 --> 00:21:54.626
They're running after this, running after
that.

00:21:54.626 --> 00:21:57.566
There's no end to it.

00:21:57.566 --> 00:22:06.506
It is very surprising that in this country
of ours this new disease has started.

00:22:06.506 --> 00:22:13.376
With this disease, even in Sahaja Yoga, there
are some people who have made a business out

00:22:13.376 --> 00:22:16.715
of Sahaj Yoga and making money.

00:22:16.715 --> 00:22:25.166
So greed is something that comes to you from
the right side and you start justifying it.

00:22:25.166 --> 00:22:30.086
There's no place for love for the right side.

00:22:30.086 --> 00:22:42.816
Now this greed has gone so far that the whole
country is getting ruined.

00:22:42.816 --> 00:22:44.916
We can never progress.

00:22:44.916 --> 00:22:50.716
We can never achieve anything because everywhere
there's greed when people are just taking

00:22:50.716 --> 00:22:51.716
it.

00:22:51.716 --> 00:23:01.295
But if you love your country, if you have
love for your country, you won't do it.

00:23:01.295 --> 00:23:03.906
But that love is missing.

00:23:03.906 --> 00:23:07.766
They love - I don't know whom do they love.

00:23:07.766 --> 00:23:13.946
They love their children in such a way that
they ruin their lives.

00:23:13.946 --> 00:23:16.966
Love is not limited.

00:23:16.966 --> 00:23:19.596
Love has to be unlimited.

00:23:19.596 --> 00:23:24.696
Unlimited love which binds the whole world.

00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:35.606
There is this force, there is already acting
this force; only thing you have to become

00:23:35.606 --> 00:23:43.416
the agents of that, to become the people who
can communicate that love.

00:23:43.416 --> 00:23:51.866
You have every right to that great wealth
of love and you can spread that all around.

00:23:51.866 --> 00:24:00.736
But I find that even here people think in
the terms of money.

00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:04.896
Money is the enemy of love.

00:24:04.896 --> 00:24:12.346
I assure you if you have interest in money,
you can never progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:12.346 --> 00:24:14.246
I'm hopeless, I agree.

00:24:14.246 --> 00:24:17.766
I don't know how to take interest even.

00:24:17.766 --> 00:24:20.626
What is so interesting about it?

00:24:20.626 --> 00:24:27.246
And people laugh at Me that "You don't know
simple things, even to count the money."

00:24:27.246 --> 00:24:29.506
I said, "I know."

00:24:29.506 --> 00:24:34.656
I can tell you like this, how much money's
there, but I'm not interested.

00:24:34.656 --> 00:24:37.496
There's so many other things to be interested.

00:24:37.496 --> 00:24:39.276
You see the children.

00:24:39.276 --> 00:24:41.295
You see nice, nice people.

00:24:41.295 --> 00:24:47.946
In the whole world, there are so many beautiful
people, beautiful things.

00:24:47.946 --> 00:24:55.545
Why pay so much attention to this useless
stuff, which comes and goes?

00:24:55.545 --> 00:25:03.636
But that is what is the most - I should say
- gripping thing that is also there.

00:25:03.636 --> 00:25:05.606
In India is the worst, I think.

00:25:05.606 --> 00:25:10.466
They say that India is the most corrupt country,
but I don't know.

00:25:10.466 --> 00:25:15.256
I have never seen that kind of thing, but
must be true.

00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:28.476
On such an occasion, it's very auspicious
that you should think that money is of no

00:25:28.476 --> 00:25:39.716
value to you, has no value, and you will be
amazed, you will have never dirth of money

00:25:39.716 --> 00:25:40.716
- absolutely.

00:25:40.716 --> 00:25:52.656
This is one thing in Sahaja Yoga you have
to get, that money is of no value.

00:25:52.656 --> 00:25:58.346
There's no interest in money.

00:25:58.346 --> 00:26:07.916
Your money is in getting how many people you
have in Sahaja Yoga, how many people you have

00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:13.946
brought in Sahaja Yoga, how many people have
got this joy.

00:26:13.946 --> 00:26:18.866
You have not purchased it.

00:26:18.866 --> 00:26:20.785
Nobody has to purchase it.

00:26:20.785 --> 00:26:23.636
It's free, flowing everywhere.

00:26:23.636 --> 00:26:26.486
It's so joy giving.

00:26:26.486 --> 00:26:29.136
What else do you want with money?

00:26:29.136 --> 00:26:30.136
Nothing.

00:26:30.136 --> 00:26:38.356
Just with money - headaches, fear and all
kinds of problems.

00:26:38.356 --> 00:26:56.155
So, parallel to our Sahaja Yoga, it should
be the life of freedom, complete freedom and

00:26:56.155 --> 00:27:02.356
enjoyment, nothing to worry about.

00:27:02.356 --> 00:27:05.435
Nothing is dependent on money.

00:27:05.435 --> 00:27:15.346
I have seen people living in very poor conditions,
extremely happy and joyous; while those who

00:27:15.346 --> 00:27:20.226
have lots of money, especially in the foreign
countries, are rich people.

00:27:20.226 --> 00:27:26.536
They have depression, all kinds of funny,
funny situations there.

00:27:26.536 --> 00:27:29.266
They commit suicides.

00:27:29.266 --> 00:27:30.266
Why?

00:27:30.266 --> 00:27:35.566
If money was everything, why all the rich
country people commit suicide?

00:27:35.566 --> 00:27:38.456
What is the gain they have?

00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:50.266
See, and all the time what they are thinking,
how to get into a kind of a fashion.

00:27:50.266 --> 00:27:57.526
Fashion, because if you have no money, you
cannot get into those fashions.

00:27:57.526 --> 00:28:04.766
The fashions are so common now, so common,
that for that people hanker.

00:28:04.766 --> 00:28:11.026
If they cannot get to the fashions, they think
that something has gone wrong with them, something

00:28:11.026 --> 00:28:15.506
is - But not you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:15.506 --> 00:28:21.756
Now you see these things happening, so what
have you to do?

00:28:21.756 --> 00:28:28.566
Have pity for such people - no contempt, but
pity - and you have to tell them that, "What

00:28:28.566 --> 00:28:29.706
are you doing?

00:28:29.706 --> 00:28:31.976
Why are you wasting your time?

00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:40.416
This is the best time for you to reach the
highest goal of your life, of Self Realization

00:28:40.416 --> 00:28:45.536
and why are you so much running after all
these things?

00:28:45.536 --> 00:28:51.236
What is it that makes you run this rat-race?"

00:28:51.236 --> 00:28:58.986
I think it's a breaking point everywhere and
people are thinking, but you are the people

00:28:58.986 --> 00:29:00.146
who should provide.

00:29:00.146 --> 00:29:05.976
In a very large scale, you can work it out.

00:29:05.976 --> 00:29:08.816
I mean, I have seen people who have nothing
in them.

00:29:08.816 --> 00:29:10.665
They are not spiritual.

00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:14.646
They are not the ones who can give Realization
or anything.

00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:22.655
But just because they are doing some social
work, they are very famous.

00:29:22.655 --> 00:29:24.618
What is the social work?

00:29:24.618 --> 00:29:27.886
Looking after the poor or something like that.

00:29:27.886 --> 00:29:39.287
Now, when your love, which is so great, which
is so effective, that starts working, you

00:29:39.287 --> 00:29:50.696
feel you should do something, then you'll
be amazed how your Sahaja Yoga will be understood.

00:29:50.696 --> 00:29:58.366
So far Sahaja Yoga is all right, people are
very nice, excellent, saintly and all.

00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:06.856
But effect of that must be seen and people
should see the effect of that, of your love.

00:30:06.856 --> 00:30:09.816
First is forgiveness.

00:30:09.816 --> 00:30:11.026
You have to forgive people.

00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:13.176
They are utterly stupid.

00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:19.576
I have just now explained to you how stupid
they are.

00:30:19.576 --> 00:30:22.746
So, nothing to worry about that.

00:30:22.746 --> 00:30:31.805
If you are such a wise personality, you should
try to judge everything with wisdom and don't

00:30:31.805 --> 00:30:44.295
fall a trap into things where you feel that
you have to do it like some fashion or some

00:30:44.295 --> 00:30:47.966
sort of a - I should say what?

00:30:47.966 --> 00:30:49.326
- some grouping.

00:30:49.326 --> 00:30:53.386
No need, we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:53.386 --> 00:30:55.416
We are self-sufficient.

00:30:55.416 --> 00:30:57.165
We don't need anything.

00:30:57.165 --> 00:31:00.396
If you are one, we are all right.

00:31:00.396 --> 00:31:02.896
If you are many, we are all right.

00:31:02.896 --> 00:31:11.756
Now you must know that you have reached a
very high state and you have touched that

00:31:11.756 --> 00:31:15.816
love, that Universal Love of God.

00:31:15.816 --> 00:31:22.096
So express more of that love in your daily
life.

00:31:22.096 --> 00:31:27.046
Express more of that love in dealing with
others.

00:31:27.046 --> 00:31:32.216
Express your love in a way that others are
made happy.

00:31:32.216 --> 00:31:36.846
It's all something to be thought of.

00:31:36.846 --> 00:31:39.785
How can you quarrel if you are real Sahaja
Yogis?

00:31:39.785 --> 00:31:43.766
How can you put down others if they are Sahaja
Yogis?

00:31:43.766 --> 00:31:45.858
How can you deceive others if you are Sahaja
Yogis?

00:31:45.858 --> 00:31:46.858
Not possible.

00:31:46.858 --> 00:31:53.316
You should have no interest in all these things.

00:31:53.316 --> 00:32:02.456
That means now you are clarified and you are
clear and you are now Nirmal.

00:32:02.456 --> 00:32:04.626
Nobody can touch you.

00:32:04.626 --> 00:32:10.696
This sort of attitude, should have respect
for yourself.

00:32:10.696 --> 00:32:17.106
This kind of understanding you should have
about yourself.

00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:18.456
What is your role?

00:32:18.456 --> 00:32:19.805
What is your position?

00:32:19.805 --> 00:32:31.655
You should know that you are Realized Souls
and what you should do as Realized Soul that

00:32:31.655 --> 00:32:32.655
you should know.

00:32:32.655 --> 00:32:42.676
You are not another sort of madman running
the rat race or also you're not in competition.

00:32:42.676 --> 00:32:47.416
You're not competitive.

00:32:47.416 --> 00:32:55.545
You are just progressing by your own love
and blessings.

00:32:55.545 --> 00:32:58.706
I know how the blessings work.

00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:07.055
But first of all, you have to be worthy of
that blessing, otherwise - can't help it.

00:33:07.055 --> 00:33:09.376
Your loving nature.

00:33:09.376 --> 00:33:21.425
That's why Christ has said that you have to
be like children to enter into the Kingdom

00:33:21.425 --> 00:33:23.165
of God.

00:33:23.165 --> 00:33:30.295
You are already in the Kingdom of God, but
you have to be like children; how innocent

00:33:30.295 --> 00:33:38.346
they are, how simple they are and they're
happy with small, small things.

00:33:38.346 --> 00:33:41.716
They don't want something very extraordinary.

00:33:41.716 --> 00:33:54.076
It's very surprising how our love, which is
actually, is enlightened by Divine Love, can

00:33:54.076 --> 00:33:57.486
change the whole world.

00:33:57.486 --> 00:34:05.856
How I had this idea and how it has prospered.

00:34:05.856 --> 00:34:15.706
If you all help Me in this, I'm sure Sahaja
Yoga can do so many things, which have not

00:34:15.706 --> 00:34:16.736
been achieved.

00:34:16.736 --> 00:34:21.836
Now you go home and think whatever I have
told you.

00:34:21.836 --> 00:34:23.366
Think about it.

00:34:23.366 --> 00:34:25.925
What you need is introspection.

00:34:25.925 --> 00:34:27.366
What you need is understanding.

00:34:27.366 --> 00:34:32.276
"What have I done out of my life as Sahaja
Yogis?"

00:34:32.276 --> 00:34:39.035
And then you will find out that you can do
a lot, a lot.

00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:44.225
And that has to be done.

00:34:44.245 --> 00:34:47.425
May God bless you.
