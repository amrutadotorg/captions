00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.410
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.579
At the very outset, we should know what is
the truth?

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.689
And what are we seeking?

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:36.480
In all the scriptures, it has been said that
“Know thyself”.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.870
You have to know yourself.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:47.531
If you do not know yourself, your seeking
will go on for ever.

00:00:47.531 --> 00:01:00.089
And that is the main problem, with the modern
seekers, who are going from places to places,

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:10.670
searching, they don’t know what, they don’t
know what they have to have.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.899
Its long they have been doing it.

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:19.580
They might have started very early and still
they are going on with their trips (this word

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.960
is not clearly audible) seeking which is not
fulfilled.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.220
What is the reason for that?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:37.619
Because they have not known the truth, the
absolute truth, and the truth about themselves.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.799
Unless and until you know that, unless and
until you have that knowledge, it is absolutely

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:54.020
useless running this race, or I’ll call
the rat race of seeking.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:05.270
The first thing you must know that knowing
yourself itself, is achieved only through

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.810
your last evolutionary process, the last jumping.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.860
Without that you cannot do it.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.100
Now let us see if there is any description
of that.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:33.691
In all the scriptures, they have talked, about
one thing, that is you have to ascend, you

00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:39.900
have to rise, you have to know yourself within
yourself.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:50.082
All the great saints have said that you have
to know your ‘Self’ which is inside, it’s

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:52.480
not outside.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.980
Not by doing outside thing that you can achieve,
is being clearly said.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.340
But what we are doing, early in the morning,
we will get up at 4 o’clock, do all kinds

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.400
of gimmicks and think that you are seeking.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:24.840
That is one thing one has to face, that now
as it is, it’s a very important time.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.610
This is the Last Judgement.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:37.950
I must tell you, this is the last judgement
and you have to find out what you have been

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.260
seeking.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:47.850
Only by that absolute knowledge, you will
rise and ascend and if you do not do that,

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.481
you’ll be left in the lurch with all others
who are still running the race.

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:56.230
They like to do, it’s a fashion.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.670
Go to one person, then to another person and
to the third person.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.820
Now I tell you very frankly, that you cannot
pay for it.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.760
You cannot pay.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:17.690
You cannot purchase the person who is going
to give you your ascent, you cannot.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.299
That is one thing we should know.

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:28.469
All this gimmicks of some people asking you
five thousand dollars for a lecture or asking

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:35.470
you give all your money, all your property,
everything to me, all such things are really

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.470
thuggery.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.780
It has no sense at all.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.580
And if you want yourself to be ruined like
that, I am really warning you, be very careful.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.560
It is important to understand the value of
your life.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.120
Why are you on this earth?

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.979
What is the speciality?

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.889
Why should you achieve your self realization?

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:12.770
You are so very important that at this time,
at this juncture, you all are suppose to get

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.300
your self realization.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:22.569
This is a special time and we’ve stories
about it that in this Kaliyuga, in this worst

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:29.020
modern times, people will achieve their self
realization.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.000
They have to achieve it.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.400
No use running after all kinds of rituals,
all kinds of readings.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.800
By reading you will not go there, by listening
to lectures you will not go there.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.221
It’s a happening that has to take place
and within you is placed this Kundalini, this

00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:56.689
power within you.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.770
Now there are people who are against Kundalini.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.979
They say it creates problems.

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:08.300
Now I have been working for thirty years in
so many countries and I have never seen anything

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.460
going wrong with people, on the contrary they
have been very much helped because this Kundalini

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:24.160
rises through six centres and these six centres
are responsible for our physical, mental,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.690
emotional and spiritual being.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.370
When she rises, she enlightens them.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:40.560
She nourishes them, also she integrates them,
that’s how we become an integrated personality.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.639
This has to happen to you, not just some sort
of a madness that people are doing in the

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.930
name of seeking.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.870
You become a saner person, you become a better
person, you become a self confident person

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:02.669
and you understand your value, what is your
value, why are you on this earth.

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:13.699
This has to be realized and at this time specially
it is the happening that has to take place,

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.540
is the Kundalini Awakening.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.449
I have to tell you very frankly about it.

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:23.249
I’ve told you some people talk against it
because they don’t know how to do it.

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:28.060
Or maybe they are not capable of doing it.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:35.710
But you people should understand your own
capabilities and should know what is your

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:41.360
due , it’s your birth right to have your
self realization because you are born at this

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.710
time.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:49.620
Formerly only one person used to get realization
among thousands and they used to select out

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.620
of I don’t know how many.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.020
This was the problem but that’s not going
to be with you.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.110
You can get your realization amass.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:06.759
It has worked wonders everywhere and is working
very well.

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:13.789
I must say, I am sorry to say but in America,
North America, people are seeking no doubt,

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:16.800
but they don’t know what they are seeking.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.389
They don’t understand.

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:21.009
If somebody comes here and says aa.

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:22.009
.

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:26.849
you pay me so much money, I’ll give your
self realization, they are quiet satisfied.

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:28.870
Because they think they are purchasing that
person.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.569
It’s a ego satisfaction.

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:33.870
It is not the reality.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:42.310
One thing you cannot market and you cannot
purchase is your spirit and this spirit has

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.730
to be awakened within you.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.000
That has to be done.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.710
We have done all kinds of gimmicks.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:53.260
I have seen people trying to tell you all
kinds of stories.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.450
But this time I’m going to tell you that
if you do not take to your self realization,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.810
it’s going to be very difficult for you.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:08.650
For example, these centres look after your
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.680
being.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:16.710
So physically if you are suffering, only Sahaja
yoga can cure you.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:22.710
So many diseases have been cured in Sahaja
Yoga, so many.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:28.490
We also have a hospital in India, where people
go there, at a very cheap price they live

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.760
there and they get cured.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.600
It can be done, it’s not difficult, but
only thing you should all understand that

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.120
you cannot pay for it.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:45.130
If you cancel only that point, most of them
who have come from all over the world to loot

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.280
you, or to cheat you, will run away.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:56.290
In every way, I’ve seen people have tried
to put absolute false ideas into your heads.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:02.640
And with that you should only understand,
what have they achieved, what have they given,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.200
what is their aim?

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:12.931
If you use your intelligence a little bit,
you can understand that this is divine and

00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:19.990
you cannot purchase divinity, you cannot pay
for it.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:26.660
This is a very important thing which is missing
because may be we are not that subtle to understand

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:33.200
that to get to that subtle point, how can
you be, pay money?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:44.211
Now I’m going to tell you as to what else
can happen to you if you have missed the point.

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:48.010
For example these are the days of terrible
times.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.310
People have lost their value system, families
are lost.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:57.210
Houses are being built according to the just
need of people.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.530
There is, many people in the whole world there
are who are just starving, there are wars

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:11.030
and there are all the time some sort of a
conflict going on right into the family.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.880
All these things have to end, we must have
our peace.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.410
And where is the peace within us?

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:25.740
The peace is absolutely within us, because
we react, we react every time and we create

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.720
a problem.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:38.460
If you can stop the reaction, if you can somehow
become thoughtlessly aware then this competition,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:50.180
this…these jealousies, this petty mindedness,
this treacheries, all will be stopped.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:59.070
Because once the Kundalini rises she reaches
you to the point of divinity.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.290
As a divine person, you drop all that is nonsensical.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:11.830
You just become a pure personality, very pure
personality, beautiful personality which does

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.610
not accept anything that is wrong.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:20.830
It happens, it has happened, to thousands
of people and why not to you.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:27.760
You just get rid of all this nonsensical ideas
which goes on reacting all the time.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:34.260
When Kundalini rises, she elongates your thoughts
and there’s a space in between and in that

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.030
thought you become thoughtless.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.970
This is the first achievement, that you become
thoughtless and you watch everything as a

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.970
witness.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.930
You see everything as a witness.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:51.980
And once you are in witness, you do not react
and you understand everything that helps you

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.090
so much.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:59.780
It helps you in so many ways because that
is what is your due, is your right as I have

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.700
said it and you all can have it.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:10.860
Whatever may be your religion, whatever may
be your colour, whatever may be your country,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:17.090
whatever it is, as long as you are a human
being, you all have this right to get it and

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.990
is working out in various places, why not
in Vancouver.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:31.300
I can’t understand that why North Americans
and Americans and all of them cannot understand

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:36.870
a small thing that you cannot pay for your
self realization.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.200
It just works out.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.160
Only thing you must know what you are.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:48.610
You must have that understanding of being
a divine personality.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.700
You can become, there’s no problem, no problem
at all.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.600
You can easily become that.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.480
Only thing you should have faith in yourself
and confidence in you.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.950
When somebody tells you that you are, you
have committed this sin, that sin, this and

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.620
that, don’t listen to all this nonsense.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.470
Alright, whatever has been the past, has been
the past.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.680
Past doesn’t exist anymore.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.660
Also the future doesn’t exist.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:26.590
Whatever it is, the present and you cannot
be in the present even if I say, be in the

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:32.400
present, you cannot be, but after self realization,
you’ll be amazed, you are always in the

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.910
present and enjoying it.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.950
So you get your peace, absolute peace within
yourself.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:44.100
If human beings are not peaceful how do you
expect peace to be in this world.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.390
It’s not possible.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:50.380
So this is a reformation, it’s a complete
change in you.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:56.120
You become a different personality by taking
to your self realization.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:03.740
Firstly you become a collective personality
like a drop falls into the ocean, it becomes

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.740
the ocean.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.610
That’s how you become.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.470
You become a collective person.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.530
You don’t have to worry about anything.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:17.400
All over the world you’ll find there are
so many people who will be your kith and kin,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.700
they’ll be your own friends and they’ll
be bothered about you.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.800
Whatever help you need, they will give you.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.740
It’s such a beautiful race, is being created
through Sahajayoga.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.310
Beautiful people.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:38.240
They don’t fight, they don’t quarrel,
they love each other and the compassion that

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.880
they have is tremendous.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:49.440
With this what happens is that because the
spirit resides in your heart, your heart expands,

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.300
your compassion expands and you become a very
loving personality.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.010
You enjoy your self, you enjoy your company.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:07.361
You understand it and that is how you can
love your children and you can save them.

00:16:07.361 --> 00:16:13.510
We do not know, we are progressing in one
manner, alright, but the other side is missing.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:22.100
Other side which is compassion, love, is missing
completely and that is how our children are

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.810
also getting spoilt.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:28.520
So many things are happening because we are
not ourselves.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.580
We have to become ourselves.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:36.480
It’s a struggle between the mind and the
brain and everything.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.810
All this gets integrated after Sahaja yoga.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:49.530
So you get your peace, you get your collective,
but the third you get, you get is the joy.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.910
Joy is singular, it is not happiness or unhappiness.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:17:00.500
Not joy in wasting your money in doing all
nonsensical thing, but joy from your own spirit

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.180
and from the spirit of others.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:11.649
It’s absolutely in a very abstract manner
that so many saints had, Sufis had, that joy

00:17:11.649 --> 00:17:16.289
which cannot be explained, also the Zen had.

00:17:16.289 --> 00:17:22.280
All that what they talked about, they didn’t
do the Kundalini awakening, that’s the point

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.280
is.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.069
They were all awakened people, wide awake
and they had a different life and they have

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.220
described it.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:34.070
We just seek them and we don’t know how
these people have lead that kind of a life.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:40.700
But they are saints, they are Sufis and they
are the people who have achieved this like

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.409
Lao Tse also has described about it.

00:17:44.409 --> 00:17:50.830
All these things become to us like a dream
but now the dream has to come true and you

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.580
have to become yourself.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:18:00.159
Tomorrow you’ll be great poets, great artist,
in every field of life, you’ll be surprised

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:08.120
how you’ll gain, how you‘ll prosper in
every way because you will become a dynamic

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.120
personality.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:17.519
Very dynamic and also you will be very compassionate,
loving and a beautiful person.

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:24.520
That has to happen not that on the street
you go on singing something or that you stand

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.110
on your heads.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.299
All these things are not necessary.

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:35.149
We must have some pity on ourselves because
I think you are seekers, that doesn’t mean

00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:39.380
that you end up into a lunatic asylum.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:46.470
No, seekers have a special position, special
understanding and a special life, so value

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.470
your life.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:54.040
This is a very important life, at this time
for you and that’s why I want to tell you

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.389
very firmly that please try to respect yourself.

00:18:57.389 --> 00:19:04.860
Try to respect, try to know that you are here
to get your self realization and for nothing

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.049
at all.

00:19:07.049 --> 00:19:11.929
Because we need people to have peace, how
will you have peace?

00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:16.330
What happens that you get connected to the
divine power of love.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.250
Through this happening it pierces through
fontanelle bone area.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:27.419
It’s an actualization I could say of Baptism
and then once it becomes one with that, then

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:29.860
the divinity starts flowing through you.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:36.510
And the experience you get is that in your
hands, on your fingertips, on your palms,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.330
you start feeling cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.210
You feel the cool breeze coming out of your
head.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:50.259
You can call it Holy Ghost, you can call it
Adishakti, you can call it by any name but

00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:57.210
is the same thing which gives you this beautiful
ascent.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:06.490
Now Kundalini is the reflection of that Holy
Ghost, or you can call it Adishakti, the Primordial

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:15.749
mother, and in the heart is reflected is the
spirit which is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:20.879
When the connection takes place, you are so
amazed at your capability.

00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:23.800
Now see this instrument, (Shri Mataji points
to the mike in front of HER) if it is not

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.619
connected to the mains, it is of no use.

00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:33.850
In the same way, if you are not connected
to the mains, you will not know what you are.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:40.640
You will not know what you are capable of
and you will be wasting your life this and

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:47.090
I don’t know what will happen by the end
because now a days horrible things are happening

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:55.119
all over and one should not be a part and
parcel of that destructive force which is

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:57.120
already working out.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.570
So I have to request you as a mother that
please pay attention to yourself and please

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.869
pay attention to your ascent.

00:21:04.869 --> 00:21:10.129
So many people get realization sometimes and
then they come to the follow up and all that

00:21:10.129 --> 00:21:13.049
and they’ll say what’s next, what’s
next.

00:21:13.049 --> 00:21:18.390
Like you see, it’s a typically American
style of asking questions.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:25.850
Now supposing you have become a professor
then what is next, is to teach other.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:33.049
Or if you have become the light and is enlightenment
then what you have to do is to give enlightenment

00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:34.049
to other.

00:21:34.049 --> 00:21:39.710
If you are being cured with Sahaja yoga then
what is your job is to cure others.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:46.509
You see that’s how they go on mentally,
what next now? we know about these centres,

00:21:46.509 --> 00:21:48.730
chakras and everything but what next?

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.029
Next is you are that, believe that you are
that.

00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:53.259
You have the power.

00:21:53.259 --> 00:21:56.580
Believe in yourself and try to help others.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:04.130
We have to do it because if we have to emancipate
humanity it’s a very big task.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.409
For that every one of you can help.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:08.799
You don’t have to give up anything.

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:14.419
Don’t have to give up your job, you don’t
have to give up your family, nothing is to

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:15.610
be given up.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:22.350
But what happens is you get those powers and
these powers must be used and experimented

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:28.529
to see for yourself how much you can do even
if you are young, old, or whatever it is.

00:22:28.529 --> 00:22:32.809
Whatever may be your personality outside is
not affected.

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:35.980
You become really a great person within yourself.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.980
You have those powers.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:44.770
With this you can help the whole world to
rise to get out of this mess that we are in.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:50.169
You see, I have given so many lectures, you
must be knowing that and am again trying to

00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:56.669
give another lecture to you, but I think it’s
time now for me to tell you that it’s important,

00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:59.440
it is very, very, aa.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440
.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:06.380
very, very important that you should take
your realization and work it out for others

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.380
also.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.679
It’s not just to take your realization and
know something about chakras and Kundalini.

00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:14.220
That’s not the point.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.179
Point is you have to become the light.

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:22.200
You have to help the people, you have to work
it out.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:27.470
It’s not by going to any temple or church
or mosque you can achieve it.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.929
The reason is they have lost the way.

00:23:29.929 --> 00:23:33.560
They don’t understand they are there to
give self realization but they don’t want

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.720
to give.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:42.390
So it’s better that you take to realization,
understand it, develop it, know it and work

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:43.390
it out.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.880
I hope next time when I come, I’ll find
all of you as great Sahaja yogis, not few

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:54.549
of you because you wanted to have to know
more, like a school or a college.

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:58.749
Once you are finished from the college then
you don’t ask to have more, do you?

00:23:58.749 --> 00:24:04.630
In the same way if your journey is over, now
give help to others.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.769
On the contrary you just don’t bother.

00:24:06.769 --> 00:24:11.029
You think that it was your due, you got it
and you don’t have to do anything about

00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:12.029
it.

00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:13.210
No, you have to help others.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.880
You have to look after them.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.559
That is why you’ve got it.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:22.521
You may think that it is all free, in a way
it is, but also it is binding that you’ve

00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:24.970
got this love, you better give it to others.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:28.789
You’ve got this knowledge, give it to others.

00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:31.740
You have got absolute truth, give it to others.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:39.720
That’s what we have to do and this is done
with such love, with such compassion.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:46.700
I am sometimes surprised to see people in
other countries like we can say like in Austria,

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:50.659
in Italy, people are doing so much there.

00:24:50.659 --> 00:24:57.889
After all why, why not, why not do it because
it cannot be marketed, it cannot be sold out,

00:24:57.889 --> 00:25:02.419
it cannot be a business but it is such a fulfilling
thing.

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:09.799
Whatever we do, like we buy some thing, it’s
for what, for joy, but the greatest joy is

00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:12.140
in giving realization to others.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.750
Nothing like that.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.140
You just try this.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:22.539
Those who have got, in Sahajayoga some knowledge,
should try to give realizations to others.

00:25:22.539 --> 00:25:25.399
You don’t have to ask for anything.

00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:32.139
Just you can give it to anybody who is suffering,
who is seeking, is a very great thing you

00:25:32.139 --> 00:25:35.289
all can do and that’s why you are here today.

00:25:35.289 --> 00:25:41.320
Not just to waste your time and it’s not
just like going from one place to another,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.739
it’s not that.

00:25:42.739 --> 00:25:50.289
You must understand your value, and you must
understand how much you can do yourself, how

00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:57.440
capable you are, all your diffidence, all
of your, may be also ego is all nonsense.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:05.129
What you have to do is to just understand
that you will become the saint, saint who

00:26:05.129 --> 00:26:10.540
will look after you, who will give realization
to people, the change, who will change the

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.200
life of people.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:19.669
Now the change, the transformation is the
point and this transformation is taking place

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:24.149
everywhere so rapidly and why not here?

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:28.690
Why not we have that transformation and settle
into it?

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.909
Because you have to be mature in it.

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:35.490
If you are not mature you cannot do it.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.489
It’s not only for you, it’s for everyone.

00:26:38.489 --> 00:26:46.789
And try to share it with others and you’ll
be amazed that it’s a great, great experience.

00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:52.570
I hope today it will work out for all of you
and you’ll understand what I have come to

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:59.749
tell you all the way, just to tell you that
be careful, should respect yourself.

00:26:59.749 --> 00:27:00.890
May God Bless You!

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:11.610
(Shri Mataji folds both Her hands, closes
HER eyes and bows down to the audience) Everyone

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:12.610
claps.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:20.860
Now one thing is there, those who do not want
to have it, cannot be forced, it cannot be

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.860
forced.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:27.549
It’s like a seed, if you put a seed in the
Mother Earth, it will sprout.

00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:30.840
But you cannot force it to sprout.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.169
In the same way I cannot force it.

00:27:34.169 --> 00:27:35.980
You have to ask for it.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:43.811
It should be your pure desire to have your
self realization because Kundalini is the

00:27:43.811 --> 00:27:51.519
power of pure desire and if you have pure
desire, you can get your self realization

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:53.029
without any trouble.

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:56.380
Of course for this, one lecture is not sufficient.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.999
I must have given thousands of lectures and
then later on you can listen to them.

00:28:00.999 --> 00:28:06.779
But no use also listening to the lecture,
main thing is you must get your realization,

00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:07.830
is the point.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:13.769
If you don’t get your realization, what’s
the use and then you must grow.

00:28:13.769 --> 00:28:19.789
Christ has said that some seeds fell on the
marshy land, some on the rocks, that he was

00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:23.460
meaning the people on whom it fell.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:32.299
But now, you are all seekers and I am sure
you will fulfill your seeking.

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:38.840
Finish it once for all and now once you become
that you can give it to others.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.340
Thank you very much.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:50.090
(Shri Mataji folds both HER hands, and bows
down to audience) The audience claps.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:54.590
So should I ask you if you want to go, you
can go away.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:59.379
Those who want self realization, can be seated.

00:28:59.379 --> 00:29:03.409
Because one should not disturb others.

00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:05.700
Alright.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:17.130
It’s a very beautiful experience.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.429
You should not be afraid of anything.

00:29:19.429 --> 00:29:23.541
Nothing to have fear, nothing can happen to
you.

00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:30.039
She is your, Kundalini is your mother, individual
mother, your own mother.

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:31.650
She knows everything about you.

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:39.320
She knows about what are your desires are,
aspirations are, everything she knows, what

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.200
mistakes you have committed, everything she
knows.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:50.239
It’s like a tape recorder of everything
and she knows how to give you your second

00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:51.239
birth.

00:29:51.239 --> 00:29:52.820
She is very anxious to give you the second
birth.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.940
But you should allow to work it out.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.100
She will take all the trouble.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:02.440
When you were born your mother took all the
trouble upon herself.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.259
You didn’t have any trouble upon yourself.

00:30:06.259 --> 00:30:09.049
In the same way she will look after you.

00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:10.429
She will do everything.

00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:12.190
Have trust in her.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:18.809
And just enjoy your self realization.

00:30:18.809 --> 00:30:30.802
Now if I request you one thing is to take
out your shoes, I hope you don’t mind.

00:30:30.802 --> 00:30:31.802
Because in England when I said that, half
of them walked out of the hall.

00:30:31.802 --> 00:30:47.350
(laughter in the audience, Shri Mataji also
laughs) suppose to be very develop people,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.220
because this Mother Earth helps us.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:54.419
You need not take out your socks but this
Mother Earth definitely helps us to suck in

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:55.830
our problems.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.610
So please give her a chance.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:03.419
Please take out your shoes and put both the
feet apart from each other because as you

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:10.669
have seen there are two, two nadis, two channels
and these two channels work, one on the right,

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:12.940
one on the left.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.019
So we have to put both the feet apart from
each other.

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:25.190
Simple and just take out your shoes, that
will help.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:44.010
Now please put both your hands towards me
like this.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:32:14.359
Alright, now please put your right hand towards
me and bend your head and see on, from your

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:24.110
fontanelle bone area if you get cool breeze
this is called as ‘Taloo’ in Sanskrit

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:29.100
language and also is the area which was soft
bone in childhood.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.769
(Shri Mataji is keeping HER eyes closed, right
hand open in lap, left hand on top of head

00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:33.294
and moving left hand above fontanelle bone
area to feel the cool breeze) Here you might

00:32:33.294 --> 00:32:39.200
feel it on the sides, you can move your hand
this way, that way or may be higher or in

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:53.029
front, just try to feel if there’s cool
breeze coming out of this fontanelle bone

00:32:53.029 --> 00:33:00.620
area, it is.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:09.960
Now please put your left hand towards me and
bend your head and see for yourself if there’s

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.801
a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:13.801
(Shri Mataji now brings HER left hand down,
keeps it open and takes HER right hand on

00:33:13.801 --> 00:33:14.801
top of HER head and moves it little above
the head to feel the cool breeze) Please bend

00:33:14.801 --> 00:33:19.489
your head, it’s easier then and see for
yourself with the right hand, if there’s

00:33:19.489 --> 00:33:28.289
a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle
bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:33:28.289 --> 00:33:39.509
It can be hot, it can be cool because you
have not forgiven yourself and you have not

00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:41.190
forgiven others.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.039
Please forgive others.

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:46.169
Please forgive others and forgive yourself.

00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:48.149
Please forgive yourself.

00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:50.130
Don’t feel guilty.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.429
You have done nothing wrong.

00:33:53.429 --> 00:33:55.270
You are not guilty.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:34:02.200
Just please have this sense of self respect
and also forgive others.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.580
You may say it’s difficult.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.620
It is not.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:11.190
Because whether you forgive or don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:16.909
Actually if you don’t forgive, then you
do harm yourself so best is to forgive everyone.

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:21.909
Just say in your heart, “ Mother I forgive
everyone.

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:28.030
” Now raise your hand and see for yourself
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze may be

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.030
coming, doesn’t matter.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.030
See for yourself.

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.480
(Shri Mataji keeps moving HER right hand above
HER fontanelle bone area and left hand is

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.480
kept open only)

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.120
(Now Shri Mataji brings HER right hand down)
Now with the right hand now again, you see

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.280
with the left hand on top of your fontanelle
bone area.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:49.899
If there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming
out of your head.

00:34:49.899 --> 00:34:51.899
Please see, please watch it.

00:34:51.899 --> 00:34:55.520
If it is hot you must know you have not forgiven
.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.140
Forgive yourself, you are not guilty, you
are not guilty at all.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:07.819
Also forgive others who might have tortured
you, troubled you but now you are troubling

00:35:07.819 --> 00:35:08.819
yourself.

00:35:08.819 --> 00:35:10.770
So better to forgive.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:14.260
Just say, “ MOTHER I forgive everyone.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.630
” That will help you a lot.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:17.630
Hmm.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:18.630
.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:24.080
(Shri Mataji brings HER left hand down now)

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:27.380
Now, again please put both the hands towards
me.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:31.920
(Shri Mataji shows both HER hands open) and
don’t think.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:45.289
Just manage, you can do it, just don’t think.

00:35:45.289 --> 00:36:03.970
All those who have felt cool breeze or hot
breeze on their palms or on their finger tips

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:10.250
or out of their fontanelle bone area, please
raise both your hands.

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:19.680
“ MY God” imagine, all of you have got
it, all of you.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:28.089
I really bow to you ( Shri Mataji folds both
HER hands) to you all who have become saints.

00:36:28.089 --> 00:36:32.530
O my, May God Bless You All.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.731
Except for one or two people, all of you have
got realization.

00:36:35.731 --> 00:36:37.920
Can you believe it?

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.640
Have faith in yourself, have faith in yourself.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:46.140
Is very important that you should know what
has happened to you.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.839
After this when you’ll go to our follow
up programs they will tell you what has happened.

00:36:50.839 --> 00:36:58.220
How will you know because on your fingertips
you can feel your own chakras, you can feel

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.700
your own centers which are responsible for
different thing.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.220
People even they become mad, they don’t
know.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.720
People who have cancer, they don’t know.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.670
They have any disease, they don’t know.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.140
You can find out on your finger tips.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.740
Not only yours, but of others.

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:22.420
If you want to feel how others are, you can
just see yourself and you are amazed how you

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.530
can find out of others.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.329
Now absolute truth you will know.

00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:32.599
Supposing there’s somebody who is cheating
you or who is a wrong type of a person, just

00:37:32.599 --> 00:37:38.000
feel his vibrations and you will know what
sort of a person he is, if he is a wrong type

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.900
you will get lot of heat, or you might even
get little blisters.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.290
So there could be tingling, of course it goes
away in no time.

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:52.170
But you see that is how you’ll judge, absolute
truth will be with you.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:56.290
For everything you will know through your
fingertips.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:38:01.660
Mohammad Sahib has said it, in the Quran,
that your hands will speak when there will

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:02.819
be a resurrection.

00:38:02.819 --> 00:38:08.109
I do not accept anybody who says I am a Muslim
and whose hands are not speaking.

00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:12.090
That’s the main things should happen to
all of you.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:17.120
Christ has talked about it, Mohammad Sahib
has talked about it, Lao Tse has talked about

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.410
it, everybody has talked about it.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.980
But so far nobody has felt it.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.109
Now all of you have felt.

00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:28.110
I really bow to you for that.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.460
May God Bless You!

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:37.341
(Shri Mataji folds HER hands, closes HER eyes
and bows down to the audience)

00:38:37.341 --> 00:38:38.450
There will be a song also.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:46.570
(Shri Mataji speaks aside something in Marathi
language) You all should go, you all should

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.570
go.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:52.809
I request you, please go there, all of you,
not three, four people but all of you should

00:38:52.809 --> 00:38:59.329
go and you see for yourself, know for yourself
what are these chakras, how they work it out

00:38:59.329 --> 00:39:04.000
and how you can work it out yourself.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.430
I think you are feeling your silence and enjoy
it but I was just thinking this, give one

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:07.880
song and if you clap with that song.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.540
That will help you to develop your sensitivity
more.

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.040
You’ll become very sensitive now.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:23.930
You’ll be surprised and you just should
know how to, how to identify everything.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:33.962
Please rise, I have given up this, I have
given up all bad things.

00:40:33.962 --> 00:40:35.230
Please rise within me and that is how they
say “Udo Udo Ambe” Ambe is the Kundalini

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.920
and they sing like this.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.980
All over Maharashtra they sing but they don’t
know what it is.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.390
Now of course they know what it is.

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.640
So this is something very important to understand.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:53.720
It is the song for the Kundalini itself made
in 12th century by this great man called Namdeva.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.200
He had written it.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.820
May God Bless You.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:45:47.650
Shri Mataji folds Her hands and says Thank
you very much.
