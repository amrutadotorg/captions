00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.090
…only thing to do is to come down as a human
being, to live like a human being, and suffer

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.180
like a human being.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.820
And He came down on this earth, to know now,
to know the world that He has created, from

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.820
inside, out.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.310
That’s how He came just to save us.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.980
But I mean, he was talking and his Agnya was
such a big catch that I was just saying ki

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.140
(that) thing he is talking about itself is
evident in him – that there is no sense

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.880
of humility left in him!

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.000
The way he was using Christ for that!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.050
And a very horrible Agnya!

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.050
And I cleared it out.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.990
And the whole thing was like a…I was thinking
he was putting up an act.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.170
And then the most miserable part was later
on when he said that, “What is your message

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.559
for the people of other communities who are
here and what do you say?”

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.379
He said that, “We should love our neighbour
and that’s how we must love you.

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.340
And it’s for the wellbeing, and that’s
why we had started a thing by which we give

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.280
people jobs and look after them."

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.540
And the thing all started with a philanthropic
thing, and then it became a union, a labour

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.359
union, and then he became a social worker,
and ultimately he ended up with an employment

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:27.529
exchange!! (laughing) And I didn’t know
what sort of a bishop is he and when is he

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:28.950
going to talk about the emancipation of the
Spirit within?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.670
When is he going to talk about the evolution?

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.159
And when is he going to talk that we have
to be aware of ourselves?

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.459
And – nothing!

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:36.509
Not a word!

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.810
What he spoke was this, and so disappointing,
I tell you.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.159
I mean, all the way Christ came only just
to give you jobs?

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.249
(laughing) And then they had a man put up
there who talked about how they give jobs

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.789
to people who don’t have jobs and how they
create jobs.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.170
So the whole thing became an economic activity!

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.740
So, [to] understand God and His humility by
saying that He should come all the way on

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.049
this earth just to give us employment exchange!

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.200
I mean this is how if you are going to judge
God’s incarnation, I don’t know what you

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.479
are going to get out of them.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.440
Because this is a wrong conception you have
about God and His ways.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
Absolutely.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.540
And people listen to him, I mean without any
questioning or anything because he was a bishop

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.080
elected by all of you, and he was on and on
and on.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.549
So this is, one has to understand, why did
Christ come on this earth?

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.349
Why did He come all the way with all humility?

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.700
Why did He come as a poor man on this earth?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:50.109
And why did He, at all, wanted to get crucified
and to sacrifice His life for the people who

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.780
were supposed to be sinners?

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.340
This is what we should find out.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.940
Not for unemployment or for getting you a
material gain because He Himself has said

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.159
that, “A rich man can never enter into the
Kingdom of God."

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:10.170
So to get jobs for people or to get them some…there
was a disabled person, and “a disabled person

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.660
should be helped, and that is the job of the
Church."

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.940
And that’s what they were describing, that
how they were helping the disabled people

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.170
in this country!!

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.099
So, because He cured certain people that doesn’t
mean that He came to look after the disabled

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.650
hospitals and things like that!

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.209
But He came on this earth for a new awareness
being shot into our being.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:42.650
He was born at a time when human beings had
no idea as to what is the eternal life, what

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.109
is the Spirit, what we call the ‘Atma’
is.

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.150
They never even thought that there is something
like that.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.180
He was born in a place where they did not
think on those lines.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.060
And though in India, we can say that people
have been thinking about Atma and Paramatma

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.349
since long; but they also achieved nothing
because all these so-called religious leaders

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.540
of India were busy collecting money.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.459
Then Christ came in, you see.

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.419
And they were – I don’t know what sort
of temples they had or what sort of pujas

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.220
they used to have, or what ideas they had
about God because He came out two thousand

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.220
years ago.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.830
And that same time Buddhism also was spreading
in India.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.669
And all these things, if you see in the collectively,
it is very disturbing to see people using

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:37.889
Buddha in that fashion.

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.990
And it was necessary that Christ should come
on this earth to tell them that it is the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.802
Spirit that you have to find out.

00:04:44.802 --> 00:04:48.130
You don’t have to worry about other things,
but it is the Spirit which is to be reborn.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.130
You are to be reborn.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.780
You are to be Christian.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.560
And that’s how we came on this earth.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.630
But He could not cross the limit of Bethlehem.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:04.550
I mean, He was just, we can say of – absolutely
gated into that place because of the ignorance

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.550
of the people.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.670
His message never spread out when He lived.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.440
So His purpose was to come on this earth,
on the Agnya chakra, as you know that, to

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.639
open it, and to give a new dimension to our
awareness by which we try to understand what

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.979
Krishna had said that, “Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavaka."

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:33.639
Krishna had said that, “The Spirit cannot
be destroyed, it cannot be killed, it cannot

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.199
be wiped out, it cannot be blown off."

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.720
“Na chainam kledayantyapo, na shosayati
marutaha."

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.129
“It cannot be sucked in by any air."

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.530
And when Krishna said that people said, “What
sort of a Spirit is that?

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.530
Where is that Atma?

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.560
What are you talking about?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.879
Which one it is?”

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.169
So Christ came on this earth because He is
the essence.

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.730
And He showed by His resurrection that Spirit
does not die.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.000
And He showed it very clearly what Krishna
had said, because, you know, He was Krishna’s

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.349
son, and that’s how He did it.

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:09.759
But before He could deliver the complete thing
to human beings they crucified Him.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.639
And that is the way they respected Him and
that is the way they came to Him.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.289
Now in Sahaja Yoga also, we must know that
if you go to Sahaja Yoga, it is not [that]

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.120
you are obliging Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.690
You see, this is how a person talks today
when Christ is no more.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.449
That, “Christ came on this earth, it was
His humility,” because you understand how

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:29.449
great He was.

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.590
I mean, at least, you try to pose that you
understand, then you say like that.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.180
But when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you think
the Sahaja Yoga should oblige you and not

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.760
you are being under the obligation of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.290
[Part 2]

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:53.770
…conditions about your spirituality through
completely humbling down yourself because

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.319
it is the grace of God that must be sought
for.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.419
And somebody’s grace you cannot force it
down.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.419
You cannot demand it.

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.800
You cannot ask for it.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.820
You cannot say that, “I am such and such
a big king”, and something like that, “so

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.060
the grace should come to me."

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.729
No, it may not come to you at all.

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:15.240
Even you may be the highest priest of the
Church of England, you may not get the grace

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240
of God.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.560
To get the grace of God you have to ask for
it, you have to be humble.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.210
It is like we expect to go to the king’s
palace and then we want that the king should

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.910
come forward, he should kneel down, and he
should take you by hand and make you sit on

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.500
the throne!

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.030
I mean, this is something absurd!

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.759
We can understand that.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:41.259
But even more than that is an incarnation.

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:48.500
An incarnation comes down in complete humility,
not to be humiliated, but to make you understand

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:57.360
that an incarnation has come all the way for
your emancipation and for your spiritual growth.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.759
Then you should with great surrendering and
great humility should accept it.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.729
But the general attitude, you have seen how
Sahaja Yogis before coming and after coming,

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:10.500
how they realise how others are behaving towards
Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.259
They have no humility about it.

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:14.469
They are thinking, “Oh, we’ll come and
judge Mataji.

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:15.490
We’ll see how she is.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.310
We’ll watch her and we’ll do this, or
we’ll come and see the Sahaja Yogis are

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.310
like this."

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.750
They never come with the idea that they have
to receive it out of their own humility, because

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.840
they have asked for it, that’s why they
are going to have it.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.130
On the contrary, they behave so funnily.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.950
Despite that, they get it.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.130
Despite that, they get their Realisation.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.510
Despite that, they get everything else.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.920
But one should know that, somehow or other
you should try to tell those who come, now

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.090
you’ll be coming down here, you see I’ll
be not here, and they’ll be coming to see

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.700
you, many people know about your address,
then you should tell them that, “We have

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.140
to realise [that] if we have to get something
then there should be an area created within

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.870
us through our humility."

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.580
Like if you throw a stone into the Ganges
you do not get any water out of it.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.150
But if you are a pitcher, if there is an area
which can take that water in then only can

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.150
you fill in the Ganges.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.620
Now, if you go to the Ganges and tell Her,
abuse Her and say, “Oh, you Ganges, come

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.490
along to my house!”

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.260
Will She come to your house?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:25.400
In the same way one has to understand an incarnation
or a blessing of God, or a grace of God.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.590
We have to ask for it and humble down for
it.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.100
They have all the rituals.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.280
For example – if you go to the church, they’ll
say, “Kneel down” and even the priest

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.860
would say, kneel down before him.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.910
Though he may not be a realised soul or anything,
this bishop of Canterbury or somebody who

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.290
spoke today, he is not a realised soul, his
Kundalini is just frozen.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.510
But the way everybody was very humbled down
before him.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:56.010
He never deserved it, according to Me, he
never deserves it, but we’ll do that.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.700
But to an incarnation not only that you are
not humble to Him, but we are extremely insulting,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.700
humiliating and we crucify.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:07.250
We have to see that human nature.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:16.420
It is such a terrible thing to do and if this
is done often then the wrath of God has to

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:25.060
come, we cannot stop it because the way we
are behaving, and the way we are looking at

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.060
it.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.160
Now, think of Christ, how He was created,
as you have seen in the Devi Mahatmyam, the

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.190
Mahavishnu stage, how He was created specially
in the heaven, and then how He was brought

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.190
in.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.010
You have read it in the Devi Mahatmyam, His
creation.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.240
With all those things which are being done
to Him, all the powers that were given to

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.660
Him, and was specially asked to come on this
earth, to live like a ordinary human being.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:57.860
Say, if you tell a king to go and live in
a shack, or you can say in a place which is

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:06.540
not meant for even human existence, in such
places, if you ask a king to go and live,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.130
it will be very difficult.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.560
But they do it, they have done it.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.940
And when they come here, the attitude of the
people should be completely surrendering;

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.940
to thank God that you have done this for us.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:22.940
Thankfulness.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.340
And the thankfulness is the way to joy, there
is no other way.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.820
We get everything but we never thank.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.390
Grudging type we are.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:37.710
Today is the day of thankfulness that He sent
His only son, as we say, and he came himself

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:44.560
so many times on this earth, and how we have
been helped by his coming here, his aspect

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.210
coming down on this earth.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:52.500
The thankfulness if you do not have, you’ll
never see the joy that you have – whatever

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:59.280
you have got, whatever God has given you out
of His grace, out of His compassion, out of

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.460
His love.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.160
There is not even a second, which you can
spare, but thank Him all the time.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.330
It’s only thankfulness.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:12.140
And when you thank Him, the waves of joy will
rise within you.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.470
Because we do not know how to thank Him for
what we have got it.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.960
There is no joy within us and we are joyless
people, we are very unhappy.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.370
Whatever we have, we are not happy about it.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.510
So, this is the point is that, Have we thanked
Him?

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:31.400
Have we thanked Him every moment of our lives,
whatever He has given us?

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.511
It’s a great thing, the greatest thing,
is that He has given us Realisation, and He

00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:44.910
has given us the way of Sahaja by which we
can now find out ourselves fully.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:50.310
And the another thing is, unless and until
that is done, we cannot perfect anything in

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.150
this world, nothing can be perfected.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.530
All your institutions, all your endeavours
are going to be imperfect.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:01.230
A human being has to be perfected and he has
to get cured and, for that, the only simple

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.840
thing is to humble down.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.820
Humbling down is the only way you can get
it.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:11.840
There is no way of arguing about it, there
is no way of talking about it, or imposing

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.380
on anyone – nothing of the kind – but
how much you are humbled down within yourself

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.380
is the point.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.010
Always look into your heart, humble down,
humble down, and humble down.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.060
And thank, every moment, every minute.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.740
And that is the key to spark the joy out of
every moment.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.780
Every moment has an ocean of joy in it but
to spark it you must thank for whatever you

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.780
have got.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:40.180
But if you are a grudging type, all the time
if you think that, “Oh, I haven’t got

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.020
this, I haven’t got this, I haven’t got
that,” then you can never enjoy whatever

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.020
you have.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:50.860
And that is what is the message for Christmas
for everyone: is that Christmas is a day of

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:57.720
thankfulness because He gave His only son
to you and He came as an extremely humble

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.990
person, in a very humble abode, in a very
humble birth.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:10.740
And that is a thing one has to know, that
we have to be thankful for what we have got,

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.580
materially, physically, emotionally, and mentally
also whatever we have learnt.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:20.490
While He lived in complete poverty, with complete
thankfulness within him.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.920
So may God bless you!

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.290
I am very much thankful for this house, that
my children have got it.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.690
I am very much thankful that my children are
all here and they are enjoying.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:38.100
I am very much thankful that I am with them
and that your problems are solved.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:46.120
I don’t know how to thank for all this,
your love that you have shown, and all the

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.120
beautiful things you have been thinking and
singing, and how you have taken to Sahaja

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.700
Yoga and working for it.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.590
There is no end to it!

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.230
But you also enjoy it by thanking all the
time.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.590
May God bless you!
