WEBVTT

00:01.090 --> 00:05.090
…only thing to do is to come down as a human
being, to live like a human being, and suffer

00:05.090 --> 00:07.180
like a human being.

00:07.180 --> 00:13.820
And He came down on this earth, to know now,
to know the world that He has created, from

00:13.820 --> 00:14.820
inside, out.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.310
That’s how He came just to save us.

00:17.310 --> 00:23.980
But I mean, he was talking and his Agnya was
such a big catch that I was just saying ki

00:23.980 --> 00:29.140
(that) thing he is talking about itself is
evident in him – that there is no sense

00:29.140 --> 00:30.880
of humility left in him!

00:30.880 --> 00:34.000
The way he was using Christ for that!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.050
And a very horrible Agnya!

00:36.050 --> 00:37.050
And I cleared it out.

00:37.050 --> 00:42.990
And the whole thing was like a…I was thinking
he was putting up an act.

00:42.990 --> 00:49.170
And then the most miserable part was later
on when he said that, “What is your message

00:49.170 --> 00:53.559
for the people of other communities who are
here and what do you say?”

00:53.559 --> 00:58.379
He said that, “We should love our neighbour
and that’s how we must love you.

00:58.379 --> 01:03.340
And it’s for the wellbeing, and that’s
why we had started a thing by which we give

01:03.340 --> 01:05.280
people jobs and look after them."

01:05.280 --> 01:12.540
And the thing all started with a philanthropic
thing, and then it became a union, a labour

01:12.540 --> 01:19.359
union, and then he became a social worker,
and ultimately he ended up with an employment

01:19.359 --> 01:27.529
exchange!! (laughing) And I didn’t know
what sort of a bishop is he and when is he

01:27.529 --> 01:28.950
going to talk about the emancipation of the
Spirit within?

01:28.950 --> 01:30.670
When is he going to talk about the evolution?

01:30.670 --> 01:34.159
And when is he going to talk that we have
to be aware of ourselves?

01:34.159 --> 01:35.459
And – nothing!

01:35.459 --> 01:36.509
Not a word!

01:36.509 --> 01:40.810
What he spoke was this, and so disappointing,
I tell you.

01:40.810 --> 01:44.159
I mean, all the way Christ came only just
to give you jobs?

01:44.159 --> 01:48.249
(laughing) And then they had a man put up
there who talked about how they give jobs

01:48.249 --> 01:50.789
to people who don’t have jobs and how they
create jobs.

01:50.789 --> 01:53.170
So the whole thing became an economic activity!

01:53.170 --> 01:59.740
So, [to] understand God and His humility by
saying that He should come all the way on

01:59.740 --> 02:02.049
this earth just to give us employment exchange!

02:02.049 --> 02:08.200
I mean this is how if you are going to judge
God’s incarnation, I don’t know what you

02:08.200 --> 02:10.479
are going to get out of them.

02:10.479 --> 02:16.440
Because this is a wrong conception you have
about God and His ways.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.440
Absolutely.

02:17.440 --> 02:22.540
And people listen to him, I mean without any
questioning or anything because he was a bishop

02:22.540 --> 02:26.080
elected by all of you, and he was on and on
and on.

02:26.080 --> 02:31.549
So this is, one has to understand, why did
Christ come on this earth?

02:31.549 --> 02:34.349
Why did He come all the way with all humility?

02:34.349 --> 02:38.700
Why did He come as a poor man on this earth?

02:38.700 --> 02:50.109
And why did He, at all, wanted to get crucified
and to sacrifice His life for the people who

02:50.109 --> 02:51.780
were supposed to be sinners?

02:51.780 --> 02:54.340
This is what we should find out.

02:54.340 --> 02:58.940
Not for unemployment or for getting you a
material gain because He Himself has said

02:58.940 --> 03:02.159
that, “A rich man can never enter into the
Kingdom of God."

03:02.159 --> 03:10.170
So to get jobs for people or to get them some…there
was a disabled person, and “a disabled person

03:10.170 --> 03:12.660
should be helped, and that is the job of the
Church."

03:12.660 --> 03:16.940
And that’s what they were describing, that
how they were helping the disabled people

03:16.940 --> 03:18.170
in this country!!

03:18.170 --> 03:25.099
So, because He cured certain people that doesn’t
mean that He came to look after the disabled

03:25.099 --> 03:28.650
hospitals and things like that!

03:28.650 --> 03:34.209
But He came on this earth for a new awareness
being shot into our being.

03:34.209 --> 03:42.650
He was born at a time when human beings had
no idea as to what is the eternal life, what

03:42.650 --> 03:47.109
is the Spirit, what we call the ‘Atma’
is.

03:47.109 --> 03:50.150
They never even thought that there is something
like that.

03:50.150 --> 03:56.180
He was born in a place where they did not
think on those lines.

03:56.180 --> 04:03.060
And though in India, we can say that people
have been thinking about Atma and Paramatma

04:03.060 --> 04:11.349
since long; but they also achieved nothing
because all these so-called religious leaders

04:11.349 --> 04:13.540
of India were busy collecting money.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.459
Then Christ came in, you see.

04:15.459 --> 04:19.419
And they were – I don’t know what sort
of temples they had or what sort of pujas

04:19.419 --> 04:25.220
they used to have, or what ideas they had
about God because He came out two thousand

04:25.220 --> 04:26.220
years ago.

04:26.220 --> 04:30.830
And that same time Buddhism also was spreading
in India.

04:30.830 --> 04:36.669
And all these things, if you see in the collectively,
it is very disturbing to see people using

04:36.669 --> 04:37.889
Buddha in that fashion.

04:37.889 --> 04:42.990
And it was necessary that Christ should come
on this earth to tell them that it is the

04:42.990 --> 04:44.802
Spirit that you have to find out.

04:44.802 --> 04:48.130
You don’t have to worry about other things,
but it is the Spirit which is to be reborn.

04:48.130 --> 04:49.130
You are to be reborn.

04:49.130 --> 04:50.780
You are to be Christian.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.560
And that’s how we came on this earth.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.630
But He could not cross the limit of Bethlehem.

04:54.630 --> 05:04.550
I mean, He was just, we can say of – absolutely
gated into that place because of the ignorance

05:04.550 --> 05:05.550
of the people.

05:05.550 --> 05:08.670
His message never spread out when He lived.

05:08.670 --> 05:14.440
So His purpose was to come on this earth,
on the Agnya chakra, as you know that, to

05:14.440 --> 05:22.639
open it, and to give a new dimension to our
awareness by which we try to understand what

05:22.639 --> 05:26.979
Krishna had said that, “Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavaka."

05:26.979 --> 05:33.639
Krishna had said that, “The Spirit cannot
be destroyed, it cannot be killed, it cannot

05:33.639 --> 05:37.199
be wiped out, it cannot be blown off."

05:37.199 --> 05:38.720
“Na chainam kledayantyapo, na shosayati
marutaha."

05:38.720 --> 05:42.129
“It cannot be sucked in by any air."

05:42.129 --> 05:45.530
And when Krishna said that people said, “What
sort of a Spirit is that?

05:45.530 --> 05:46.530
Where is that Atma?

05:46.530 --> 05:47.560
What are you talking about?

05:47.560 --> 05:48.879
Which one it is?”

05:48.879 --> 05:52.169
So Christ came on this earth because He is
the essence.

05:52.169 --> 05:56.730
And He showed by His resurrection that Spirit
does not die.

05:56.730 --> 06:01.000
And He showed it very clearly what Krishna
had said, because, you know, He was Krishna’s

06:01.000 --> 06:03.349
son, and that’s how He did it.

06:03.349 --> 06:09.759
But before He could deliver the complete thing
to human beings they crucified Him.

06:09.759 --> 06:14.639
And that is the way they respected Him and
that is the way they came to Him.

06:14.639 --> 06:19.289
Now in Sahaja Yoga also, we must know that
if you go to Sahaja Yoga, it is not [that]

06:19.289 --> 06:21.120
you are obliging Sahaja Yoga.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.690
You see, this is how a person talks today
when Christ is no more.

06:24.690 --> 06:28.449
That, “Christ came on this earth, it was
His humility,” because you understand how

06:28.449 --> 06:29.449
great He was.

06:29.449 --> 06:33.590
I mean, at least, you try to pose that you
understand, then you say like that.

06:33.590 --> 06:39.180
But when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you think
the Sahaja Yoga should oblige you and not

06:39.180 --> 06:44.760
you are being under the obligation of Sahaja
Yoga.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.290
[Part 2]

06:46.290 --> 06:53.770
…conditions about your spirituality through
completely humbling down yourself because

06:53.770 --> 06:57.319
it is the grace of God that must be sought
for.

06:57.319 --> 06:59.419
And somebody’s grace you cannot force it
down.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.419
You cannot demand it.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.800
You cannot ask for it.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.820
You cannot say that, “I am such and such
a big king”, and something like that, “so

07:05.820 --> 07:07.060
the grace should come to me."

07:07.060 --> 07:08.729
No, it may not come to you at all.

07:08.729 --> 07:15.240
Even you may be the highest priest of the
Church of England, you may not get the grace

07:15.240 --> 07:16.240
of God.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.560
To get the grace of God you have to ask for
it, you have to be humble.

07:20.560 --> 07:27.210
It is like we expect to go to the king’s
palace and then we want that the king should

07:27.210 --> 07:31.910
come forward, he should kneel down, and he
should take you by hand and make you sit on

07:31.910 --> 07:33.500
the throne!

07:33.500 --> 07:35.030
I mean, this is something absurd!

07:35.030 --> 07:36.759
We can understand that.

07:36.759 --> 07:41.259
But even more than that is an incarnation.

07:41.259 --> 07:48.500
An incarnation comes down in complete humility,
not to be humiliated, but to make you understand

07:48.500 --> 07:57.360
that an incarnation has come all the way for
your emancipation and for your spiritual growth.

07:57.360 --> 08:02.759
Then you should with great surrendering and
great humility should accept it.

08:02.759 --> 08:07.729
But the general attitude, you have seen how
Sahaja Yogis before coming and after coming,

08:07.729 --> 08:10.500
how they realise how others are behaving towards
Sahaja Yoga.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.259
They have no humility about it.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.469
They are thinking, “Oh, we’ll come and
judge Mataji.

08:14.469 --> 08:15.490
We’ll see how she is.

08:15.490 --> 08:19.310
We’ll watch her and we’ll do this, or
we’ll come and see the Sahaja Yogis are

08:19.310 --> 08:20.310
like this."

08:20.310 --> 08:25.750
They never come with the idea that they have
to receive it out of their own humility, because

08:25.750 --> 08:29.840
they have asked for it, that’s why they
are going to have it.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.130
On the contrary, they behave so funnily.

08:32.130 --> 08:33.950
Despite that, they get it.

08:33.950 --> 08:36.130
Despite that, they get their Realisation.

08:36.130 --> 08:38.510
Despite that, they get everything else.

08:38.510 --> 08:43.920
But one should know that, somehow or other
you should try to tell those who come, now

08:43.920 --> 08:48.090
you’ll be coming down here, you see I’ll
be not here, and they’ll be coming to see

08:48.090 --> 08:51.700
you, many people know about your address,
then you should tell them that, “We have

08:51.700 --> 08:57.140
to realise [that] if we have to get something
then there should be an area created within

08:57.140 --> 08:59.870
us through our humility."

08:59.870 --> 09:03.580
Like if you throw a stone into the Ganges
you do not get any water out of it.

09:03.580 --> 09:08.150
But if you are a pitcher, if there is an area
which can take that water in then only can

09:08.150 --> 09:09.150
you fill in the Ganges.

09:09.150 --> 09:12.620
Now, if you go to the Ganges and tell Her,
abuse Her and say, “Oh, you Ganges, come

09:12.620 --> 09:14.490
along to my house!”

09:14.490 --> 09:19.260
Will She come to your house?

09:19.260 --> 09:25.400
In the same way one has to understand an incarnation
or a blessing of God, or a grace of God.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.590
We have to ask for it and humble down for
it.

09:28.590 --> 09:31.100
They have all the rituals.

09:31.100 --> 09:36.280
For example – if you go to the church, they’ll
say, “Kneel down” and even the priest

09:36.280 --> 09:37.860
would say, kneel down before him.

09:37.860 --> 09:41.910
Though he may not be a realised soul or anything,
this bishop of Canterbury or somebody who

09:41.910 --> 09:46.290
spoke today, he is not a realised soul, his
Kundalini is just frozen.

09:46.290 --> 09:50.510
But the way everybody was very humbled down
before him.

09:50.510 --> 09:56.010
He never deserved it, according to Me, he
never deserves it, but we’ll do that.

09:56.010 --> 10:00.700
But to an incarnation not only that you are
not humble to Him, but we are extremely insulting,

10:00.700 --> 10:01.700
humiliating and we crucify.

10:01.700 --> 10:07.250
We have to see that human nature.

10:07.250 --> 10:16.420
It is such a terrible thing to do and if this
is done often then the wrath of God has to

10:16.420 --> 10:25.060
come, we cannot stop it because the way we
are behaving, and the way we are looking at

10:25.060 --> 10:26.060
it.

10:26.060 --> 10:30.160
Now, think of Christ, how He was created,
as you have seen in the Devi Mahatmyam, the

10:30.160 --> 10:36.190
Mahavishnu stage, how He was created specially
in the heaven, and then how He was brought

10:36.190 --> 10:37.190
in.

10:37.190 --> 10:40.010
You have read it in the Devi Mahatmyam, His
creation.

10:40.010 --> 10:43.240
With all those things which are being done
to Him, all the powers that were given to

10:43.240 --> 10:47.660
Him, and was specially asked to come on this
earth, to live like a ordinary human being.

10:47.660 --> 10:57.860
Say, if you tell a king to go and live in
a shack, or you can say in a place which is

10:57.860 --> 11:06.540
not meant for even human existence, in such
places, if you ask a king to go and live,

11:06.540 --> 11:08.130
it will be very difficult.

11:08.130 --> 11:11.560
But they do it, they have done it.

11:11.560 --> 11:16.940
And when they come here, the attitude of the
people should be completely surrendering;

11:16.940 --> 11:21.940
to thank God that you have done this for us.

11:21.940 --> 11:22.940
Thankfulness.

11:22.940 --> 11:27.340
And the thankfulness is the way to joy, there
is no other way.

11:27.340 --> 11:29.820
We get everything but we never thank.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.390
Grudging type we are.

11:31.390 --> 11:37.710
Today is the day of thankfulness that He sent
His only son, as we say, and he came himself

11:37.710 --> 11:44.560
so many times on this earth, and how we have
been helped by his coming here, his aspect

11:44.560 --> 11:47.210
coming down on this earth.

11:47.210 --> 11:52.500
The thankfulness if you do not have, you’ll
never see the joy that you have – whatever

11:52.500 --> 11:59.280
you have got, whatever God has given you out
of His grace, out of His compassion, out of

11:59.280 --> 12:00.460
His love.

12:00.460 --> 12:05.160
There is not even a second, which you can
spare, but thank Him all the time.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.330
It’s only thankfulness.

12:07.330 --> 12:12.140
And when you thank Him, the waves of joy will
rise within you.

12:12.140 --> 12:15.470
Because we do not know how to thank Him for
what we have got it.

12:15.470 --> 12:19.960
There is no joy within us and we are joyless
people, we are very unhappy.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.370
Whatever we have, we are not happy about it.

12:22.370 --> 12:25.510
So, this is the point is that, Have we thanked
Him?

12:25.510 --> 12:31.400
Have we thanked Him every moment of our lives,
whatever He has given us?

12:31.400 --> 12:34.511
It’s a great thing, the greatest thing,
is that He has given us Realisation, and He

12:34.511 --> 12:44.910
has given us the way of Sahaja by which we
can now find out ourselves fully.

12:44.910 --> 12:50.310
And the another thing is, unless and until
that is done, we cannot perfect anything in

12:50.310 --> 12:53.150
this world, nothing can be perfected.

12:53.150 --> 12:55.530
All your institutions, all your endeavours
are going to be imperfect.

12:55.530 --> 13:01.230
A human being has to be perfected and he has
to get cured and, for that, the only simple

13:01.230 --> 13:02.840
thing is to humble down.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.820
Humbling down is the only way you can get
it.

13:05.820 --> 13:11.840
There is no way of arguing about it, there
is no way of talking about it, or imposing

13:11.840 --> 13:18.380
on anyone – nothing of the kind – but
how much you are humbled down within yourself

13:18.380 --> 13:19.380
is the point.

13:19.380 --> 13:23.010
Always look into your heart, humble down,
humble down, and humble down.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.060
And thank, every moment, every minute.

13:25.060 --> 13:30.740
And that is the key to spark the joy out of
every moment.

13:30.740 --> 13:34.780
Every moment has an ocean of joy in it but
to spark it you must thank for whatever you

13:34.780 --> 13:35.780
have got.

13:35.780 --> 13:40.180
But if you are a grudging type, all the time
if you think that, “Oh, I haven’t got

13:40.180 --> 13:44.020
this, I haven’t got this, I haven’t got
that,” then you can never enjoy whatever

13:44.020 --> 13:45.020
you have.

13:45.020 --> 13:50.860
And that is what is the message for Christmas
for everyone: is that Christmas is a day of

13:50.860 --> 13:57.720
thankfulness because He gave His only son
to you and He came as an extremely humble

13:57.720 --> 14:01.990
person, in a very humble abode, in a very
humble birth.

14:01.990 --> 14:10.740
And that is a thing one has to know, that
we have to be thankful for what we have got,

14:10.740 --> 14:14.580
materially, physically, emotionally, and mentally
also whatever we have learnt.

14:14.580 --> 14:20.490
While He lived in complete poverty, with complete
thankfulness within him.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.920
So may God bless you!

14:22.920 --> 14:28.290
I am very much thankful for this house, that
my children have got it.

14:28.290 --> 14:31.690
I am very much thankful that my children are
all here and they are enjoying.

14:31.690 --> 14:38.100
I am very much thankful that I am with them
and that your problems are solved.

14:38.100 --> 14:46.120
I don’t know how to thank for all this,
your love that you have shown, and all the

14:46.120 --> 14:51.120
beautiful things you have been thinking and
singing, and how you have taken to Sahaja

14:51.120 --> 14:52.700
Yoga and working for it.

14:52.700 --> 14:54.590
There is no end to it!

14:54.590 --> 14:58.230
But you also enjoy it by thanking all the
time.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.590
May God bless you!
