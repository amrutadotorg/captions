00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.624
The prophets are born

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:15.380
and create a ripple in our consciousness,

00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:24.291
a new dimension to our understanding

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:28.437
to religion, dharma;

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.740
which has to be assimilated

00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:35.913
and has to be understood that,

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:38.880
whatever the previous prophets have said,

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:44.086
has to be culminated into something else.

00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:49.261
So as we can say Mohammed Sahib

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:54.742
has said that all these prophets

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:58.864
who have come on this earth have created

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:07.478
a new ripple and also has sustained human beings

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:13.955
with a newer evolution, a newer...

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:19.087
The idea of human beings of newness is that

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.061
we have to give up all that is old

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:24.545
and we have to become new.

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:30.767
Or they think that newness means absolutely a juxtaposition

00:01:31.313 --> 00:01:34.396
condition in which one has to rise

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.917
and this is the cause of the folly

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:43.700
of many people in the West as well as in the East.

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:52.604
Whenever a new theme started, like we can say that first of all

00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:58.090
a great saint came on this earth

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:03.230
and he found that the people are following

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.747
the idol worship in a very wrong way,

00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:11.783
because it is said in the bible that whatever is created by mother earth

00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:20.618
should be, should not be reproduced and worshipped.

00:02:22.063 --> 00:02:27.031
So they created another extreme religion out of it

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:30.234
saying that nothing should be worshipped, but it is said whatever is

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:32.718
reproduced by the mother earth.

00:02:34.234 --> 00:02:37.955
So there are so many such things all over the world

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.522
which are created by the mother earth.

00:02:42.703 --> 00:02:44.596
So they should not be worshipped

00:02:45.147 --> 00:02:49.670
by reproducing them and making images out of them.

00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:55.320
When such a prophet died

00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:59.695
saying that, "This should not be done, one should not worship images",

00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:05.286
the other side of it started, the extreme, going to the extreme that

00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:10.714
there should be no worship even if the mother earth has created.

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:18.902
So all the human beings were divided into extreme conditions.

00:03:20.562 --> 00:03:22.376
One situation comes in

00:03:22.638 --> 00:03:25.666
where one has to say that, "This should not be done."

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:32.393
So people take up that theme and just start building up onto that

00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:38.364
and saying that: "this should not be done as told by the prophet."

00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:41.502
Of course after the death of the prophet;

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:44.432
when the prophet is living nobody listens to him.

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:46.794
They all torture him, bother him,

00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:50.031
do all kinds of things and ultimately they may even kill him.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.544
Then another point is: every prophet

00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:58.689
is born at a different period of time

00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:06.419
so depending on the time when he is born he talks of a particular problem.

00:04:07.857 --> 00:04:10.360
Say when Mohammed was born.

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:16.139
Mohammed Sahib said very clearly that, "You should not drink."

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:23.116
So people said that, "All right, we will not drink, but we can smoke."

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:27.066
So he had to rectify himself.

00:04:27.513 --> 00:04:31.521
He'd said: 'I am the last who has come.' but he found that it is not so.

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:34.353
So he came back again as Nanaka

00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:38.225
to tell people that: 'do not smoke also'.

00:04:40.703 --> 00:04:47.703
Like that the persons or the group of persons who follow one incarnation

00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:50.418
go to another extreme

00:04:51.877 --> 00:04:54.344
and try to push down all the traditions,

00:04:54.847 --> 00:04:59.433
all that has come so far built up. Like cutting the whole tree

00:05:00.082 --> 00:05:02.082
and start their own tree.

00:05:02.454 --> 00:05:03.580
Which is artificial.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.851
Then the quarrel started

00:05:09.678 --> 00:05:12.516
when Mohammed Sahib was driven to another

00:05:13.315 --> 00:05:17.384
level and then Nanaka's disciples were driven to

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:19.333
another level, where they just thought

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.645
they have no relationship with each other. Which is not truth.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.015
Afterwards also you know so many such things have happened

00:05:31.046 --> 00:05:32.277
in this world we can see

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.832
that any revival starts,

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.389
people go to the extreme of it

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.749
and get completely ruined.

00:05:42.707 --> 00:05:45.538
In Christianity you will find the same thing happened,

00:05:45.964 --> 00:05:47.577
when Christ came in,

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:50.421
whatever problems He faced He talked about them.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.447
But the main thing He had to talk about the resurrection,

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.988
about the ascent and He talked about the ascent.

00:05:59.628 --> 00:06:01.207
He talked about the spirit

00:06:01.283 --> 00:06:04.059
and in His resurrection He showed that He ascended.

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:10.435
But people did not stick to that point.

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:14.367
They never thought that you have to ascend in Christianity.

00:06:15.543 --> 00:06:19.818
Nobody bothered that you have to ascend. They took a  small little

00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:21.364
things from somewhere.

00:06:21.691 --> 00:06:25.091
Also a person came later on

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:29.634
called saint Paul who was not at all with Christ or anything.

00:06:29.676 --> 00:06:31.897
He started a religion of Christianity

00:06:32.023 --> 00:06:34.315
which was all absurd, against Christ, anti-Christ.

00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:42.977
None of these prophets have discarded any prophet who came before them.

00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:50.528
Now the problem came in that one has to integrate

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.936
and Mohammed Sahib knew

00:06:56.246 --> 00:06:59.291
that a day will come when this integration problem will start

00:06:59.948 --> 00:07:03.051
and he talked a lot about Sahaja Yoga in the sense

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.048
he said when the resurrection time will come.

00:07:05.247 --> 00:07:08.223
He talked more about resurrection than about doom time,

00:07:08.284 --> 00:07:09.278
most surprising thing is.

00:07:10.086 --> 00:07:14.346
About Qiyamah(Qayamat - doomsday) he spoke very little. He spoke really about

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:21.204
the resurrection time, because that was the problem.

00:07:22.155 --> 00:07:24.241
The problem that they face they talk about.

00:07:25.018 --> 00:07:26.683
I've told you how Buddha talked

00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:28.440
only about Atma Sakshatkar

00:07:28.535 --> 00:07:31.298
and not about God because those people who went to God,

00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:33.195
or thought of God,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.574
or just studied God thought they will be gods themselves.

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.788
So he said, "You must get your self realization."

00:07:41.563 --> 00:07:45.687
Then Mahavira who talked about the hell

00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:48.039
where people can go,

00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:49.860
because that was his job,

00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:53.178
the part of it and the part of it and the part of it and the part of it.

00:07:53.712 --> 00:07:56.198
These are the different aspects of human beings

00:07:56.943 --> 00:08:00.413
which they had to awaken. Different aspects.

00:08:04.627 --> 00:08:07.345
When Mohammed Sahib started teaching people to do Namas

00:08:07.392 --> 00:08:08.425
people used to laugh at him.

00:08:08.532 --> 00:08:11.300
What is he doing? Why does he want us to put hands like this?

00:08:11.595 --> 00:08:15.806
Why does he want us to sit down or put our hands on the knees?

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.971
Now you understand as Sahaja Yogis what it means that he wanted us to

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.300
improve our nabhis first, our dharma first.

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:26.109
All this movement was to jerk out

00:08:26.226 --> 00:08:29.989
the Kundalini, but without realization being there

00:08:30.098 --> 00:08:31.381
Namas would not work out.

00:08:32.313 --> 00:08:34.387
You may break your knees you may do what you like.

00:08:36.564 --> 00:08:40.342
But the extremes people catch hold of it and not the reality.

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:44.415
And they make a fuss out of it and they make create a big

00:08:45.685 --> 00:08:48.001
organizations and things and that's how it is spoiled.

00:08:49.338 --> 00:08:50.280
So when he said

00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:53.081
that Allah ho Akbar is to be said with your

00:08:53.155 --> 00:08:55.273
fingers in your ears you all say that isn't it?

00:08:56.002 --> 00:09:00.077
All the Sahaja Yogis say with this finger in their ears Allah ho Akbar.

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:03.920
Because you know this is the finger that represents thevishuddi

00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:06.714
and the vishuddi chakras'

00:09:07.424 --> 00:09:10.831
deity Shri Krishna becomes the Virata with Akbar.

00:09:11.012 --> 00:09:12.578
So when you say about Akbar

00:09:12.697 --> 00:09:15.389
you have to put your fingers into your ears

00:09:15.546 --> 00:09:17.546
and you have to say Allah ho Akbar.

00:09:20.127 --> 00:09:22.421
Whole relationship and everything

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:24.859
was never understood.

00:09:25.144 --> 00:09:28.600
For Indians Shri Krishna was their Avatara.

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:33.852
For western people Christ was their Avatara.

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:40.225
For other people of Arabistan Mohammed was their Avatara. How can that be?

00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:42.629
They are all related to each other.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.905
So how to related to each other is a problem of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:55.781
When they come from different communities and different fixed ideas

00:09:56.433 --> 00:09:59.896
it's impossible to stir them and tell them that, "You are all one."

00:10:01.562 --> 00:10:06.119
We talk of Hindu Muslim unity for example. Mohammed Sahib

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.468
didn't know there were problems like that

00:10:09.669 --> 00:10:13.292
but Nanaka did say we have come to do Hindu Muslim unity.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:17.852
But in the outside if you do the Hindu Muslim unity or any unity,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.683
it doesn't work out. It doesn't work out in the outside relationship.

00:10:22.803 --> 00:10:25.116
Even your brother may not be your own brother,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.094
if it is working outside.

00:10:29.756 --> 00:10:33.341
But if the spirit is awakened within you,

00:10:34.609 --> 00:10:37.753
then spirit is the one which is the connection with the whole

00:10:37.809 --> 00:10:38.546
with the Virata.

00:10:41.323 --> 00:10:43.323
With the Akbar.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.562
When Akbar is to be felt

00:10:51.003 --> 00:10:53.429
you have to have your realization otherwise

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.103
you are just talking in the air.

00:10:55.915 --> 00:10:57.836
You don't know who is this Akbar.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:01.992
You have to get connected to that Virata

00:11:02.837 --> 00:11:05.684
and that Virata is the Primordial Being.

00:11:09.097 --> 00:11:09.921
We are

00:11:10.033 --> 00:11:13.991
actually not integrated at all because we have different incarnations.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.782
Even if you are not absolutely atheist,

00:11:16.904 --> 00:11:21.597
even if you don't say that you do not believe in God or believe

00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:24.442
in something else which is anti-God.

00:11:25.306 --> 00:11:28.531
Even if you believe in God, you believe in God

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:32.093
in fragmentations, in His different aspects,

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:34.843
but you don't see Him in collectivity.

00:11:36.813 --> 00:11:41.099
You have to see that He is one God. Everybody says He is one God.

00:11:41.987 --> 00:11:43.987
Of course He is one God.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:47.495
I am one person but I am also a housewife,

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:50.511
I have to do some work for My household.

00:11:50.936 --> 00:11:53.002
I am also a sister of somebody.

00:11:53.341 --> 00:11:54.897
I am also your Mother

00:11:54.961 --> 00:11:57.551
and Mother of My own children and also a grandmother.

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:02.340
So I have so many various aspects of My work

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:04.590
which I do. One person has to do it.

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:08.645
When we talk of God as One we think He is Rock of Gibraltar;

00:12:08.948 --> 00:12:11.649
just one piece. Even Rock of Gibraltar if you go and see

00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:12.876
it is not one piece.

00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:19.841
Anything in this world you cannot say is one piece.

00:12:22.945 --> 00:12:28.212
It has to be a compound or a mixture of something.

00:12:29.254 --> 00:12:33.429
Then how can God be just one piece hanging in the air like one,

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:37.026
God is One, so we'll not have any other aspect of God.

00:12:37.732 --> 00:12:40.828
God has many aspects, which one has to understand.

00:12:41.601 --> 00:12:43.601
So there are two concepts

00:12:43.926 --> 00:12:45.986
which work out in this world I feel.

00:12:46.217 --> 00:12:50.019
One is that they believe that there is only one God

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.767
and there cannot be many aspects of God. Which is wrong.

00:12:57.031 --> 00:13:00.657
Christ has said: 'those who are not against Me are with Me.'

00:13:01.398 --> 00:13:04.773
So this kind of a mental conception about God,

00:13:04.863 --> 00:13:06.730
that He is just like Rock of Gibraltar.

00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:09.926
See now this pendal you have done it - there are so many lights,

00:13:10.469 --> 00:13:12.791
they are all giving one light to all of us.

00:13:12.817 --> 00:13:14.409
They are not giving separate lights, are they?

00:13:18.323 --> 00:13:21.604
How are they fighting with each other?

00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:26.094
What is the fight going on? They are adding to the same light.

00:13:27.155 --> 00:13:30.550
This is one pendal but we have so many lights.

00:13:30.934 --> 00:13:32.451
We cannot do with one light.

00:13:32.705 --> 00:13:36.391
At different periods a person has to be born.

00:13:37.138 --> 00:13:40.638
Every period a person had to be born to

00:13:42.093 --> 00:13:46.604
enlighten one aspect of human awareness and consciousness.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.524
Variety has to be there

00:13:54.054 --> 00:13:56.339
because human beings are varied.

00:13:58.132 --> 00:14:01.232
And the variety is that supposing you are supporting

00:14:01.304 --> 00:14:04.929
somebody's right sidedness

00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:08.759
then there should be somebody who will come and support the left sidedness.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.557
And it is all done so well within us but

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.100
it is only human beings in their obstinacy

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:17.105
and in their ignorance cannot see it.

00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:23.339
We all are made the same way if you see in the whole world.

00:14:24.651 --> 00:14:26.835
Of course there is variety in appearances.

00:14:26.844 --> 00:14:28.844
Maybe an Indian looks like an Indian

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.558
and - but in India only you can see Indians have so many different faces.

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:37.308
You can find all colors and all kinds of

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.016
things on their faces.

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:42.480
In India is the only place where you find all kinds of people.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.993
You can have people like Russians,

00:14:47.032 --> 00:14:50.112
you can have people like Japanese, Chinese,

00:14:50.195 --> 00:14:53.705
you can have people like Africans. All kinds of people are

00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:55.695
in this country to show that

00:14:55.772 --> 00:14:58.522
all people can be called as one race as Indians.

00:15:02.918 --> 00:15:07.861
Now it is not always ignorance

00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:11.046
that makes people forget that we are all one.

00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:13.785
Every human being laughs the same way.

00:15:14.583 --> 00:15:16.052
Does he laugh in a different way?

00:15:17.922 --> 00:15:24.123
If he has to eat the food he masticates the same way.

00:15:25.296 --> 00:15:29.606
He cries the same way. When he cries his crying is the same.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.370
His actions are the same way.

00:15:33.003 --> 00:15:37.424
If a woman is angry with her husband...yesterday I saw [name] program

00:15:38.352 --> 00:15:39.684
with My brother

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:43.821
and I was amazed how universal we are in our expressions.

00:15:44.773 --> 00:15:46.613
He was showing how a woman gets

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.679
angry with the husband and how she behaves.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.748
If you see those actions which are depicted you'll be amazed

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:56.630
that they are done by all the women all over the world.

00:15:57.642 --> 00:16:01.820
And the reaction of man if you want to see all the men

00:16:02.522 --> 00:16:03.642
act in the same way.

00:16:05.604 --> 00:16:08.999
My husband was secretary to Shastriji, you know

00:16:09.818 --> 00:16:12.482
that and he went with Lal Bahadur Shastri

00:16:13.034 --> 00:16:16.427
to Tashkent at his last time,

00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:20.653
but also he went once to Yugoslavia and there

00:16:23.646 --> 00:16:28.455
[aside: who was General Tito was where? Yugoslav]

00:16:28.992 --> 00:16:31.157
And General Tito's wife, you see,

00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:33.289
got very friendly with Mrs. Shastri.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:34.514
Both were very friendly.

00:16:35.074 --> 00:16:38.592
So Shastriji warned his wife: 'See now! You are great friends

00:16:38.953 --> 00:16:42.463
and now don't start crying like an Indian woman when you leave.'

00:16:43.436 --> 00:16:46.104
So poor thing was controlling her tears all the time.

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:50.669
But she told Me: 'I was controlling but it is she who started crying

00:16:51.683 --> 00:16:52.962
and such a lot.

00:16:53.097 --> 00:16:55.809
And then she started crying loudly, hugging me.

00:16:56.086 --> 00:16:57.753
So I just could not control myself.

00:16:57.778 --> 00:16:59.558
I also gave in. I also started crying.

00:17:00.832 --> 00:17:04.066
And both the husbands started looking at the ground.'

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:12.149
So basically all the women,

00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:16.157
all the men in the whole world react the same way to a situation.

00:17:17.012 --> 00:17:20.070
And you can see their reactions

00:17:20.425 --> 00:17:22.425
very clearly when it comes to children.

00:17:23.198 --> 00:17:27.372
They all act in the same way, act in the same manner.

00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:31.626
Supposing they hear that two children are caught up

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.983
in the air somewhere or something is happening to them.

00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:37.321
The whole world will be worried about

00:17:38.689 --> 00:17:40.478
how they are going to be saved.

00:17:41.447 --> 00:17:42.890
Something must be done to save them.

00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:44.966
The whole world will be praying to God: 'Oh God

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.501
please save these two children are caught up there somehow or other.'

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:50.096
Everybody will be worried as if their own child is there.

00:17:50.894 --> 00:17:53.304
Even when it comes to death I have seen that.

00:17:53.642 --> 00:17:57.120
When there was a air space -

00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:00.135
the space craft was going to land

00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:02.954
and people were worried that they may be lost,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.150
I know in every masjid, in every temple,

00:18:06.206 --> 00:18:08.330
in every church and everywhere.

00:18:08.507 --> 00:18:10.851
They were Americans; nobody thought of Americans,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.932
what religion, anything.

00:18:12.006 --> 00:18:14.599
To them it was a part of human beings, you see.

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:17.467
The human bondage started acting.

00:18:17.852 --> 00:18:20.261
That time they never thought what country they were,

00:18:20.624 --> 00:18:23.537
what Americans have done to Indians, nothing of the kind.

00:18:24.131 --> 00:18:27.285
They just thought: 'Oh God! These people are, oh God please save them.'

00:18:28.013 --> 00:18:29.659
Everybody prayed to them -

00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:33.017
prayed to God and prayed for them that they should be saved.

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:36.455
That time what had happened to us? How did we forget?

00:18:36.664 --> 00:18:38.664
We touched to the reality at that time

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:43.861
and that is what it is.

00:18:46.006 --> 00:18:47.512
Anybody who tries.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.558
These Jews when they were troubled by Hitler,

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.866
everybody's sympathies were with them.

00:18:55.923 --> 00:18:58.056
But when these Jews started troubling

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.366
the Muslims there everybody's sympathies were with Muslims.

00:19:01.542 --> 00:19:03.119
Then why don't you think all religions?

00:19:03.256 --> 00:19:05.256
Even the Jews had sympathies with Muslims.

00:19:07.154 --> 00:19:09.982
Then we don't think what differences we have with them.

00:19:10.096 --> 00:19:13.016
None of them none of the people I heard said: 'all right

00:19:13.268 --> 00:19:15.494
they are punished.' Or, 'It's all right.' Not even Jews.

00:19:18.311 --> 00:19:21.324
So the part that is within us which is human

00:19:22.638 --> 00:19:26.132
becomes absolutely troubled

00:19:26.344 --> 00:19:29.240
when we see some other human being is tortured.

00:19:30.689 --> 00:19:35.113
Of course by with these horrible ideas of fanaticism

00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:39.362
or maybe fear or maybe aggressiveness or whatever it is,

00:19:39.905 --> 00:19:41.905
we may try to be cruel.

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:46.621
If you ask the people of Germany

00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:49.061
how do they feel about the massacre,

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:51.196
they just put down their heads.

00:19:51.235 --> 00:19:53.848
They said: 'we don't know. We were not ourselves.

00:19:53.976 --> 00:19:56.236
How we did it we don't know. How it happened

00:19:56.502 --> 00:19:58.502
we just don't know how it worked out.'

00:19:59.607 --> 00:20:04.333
So when the violence is over you just start feeling: 'Oh God,

00:20:05.002 --> 00:20:10.903
I am a human being, they were human beings.' So this oneness comes in,

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:16.128
the feeling the awareness comes in. It is not so in the animals so much.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.392
If they have to work, if they are to be active, they will be together

00:20:21.808 --> 00:20:23.956
but if something dies they are not bothered.

00:20:26.268 --> 00:20:31.544
Even if a child say of a monkey is sick

00:20:31.841 --> 00:20:34.078
the mother will be worried. She'll be screaming,

00:20:34.156 --> 00:20:37.310
shouting, but if the thing is dead she will just

00:20:37.395 --> 00:20:39.395
throw away the child on one side and get up.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.716
It's only the human beings who can feel that oneness.

00:20:45.341 --> 00:20:49.802
So our awareness... this was given to us by Shri Krishna's advent.

00:20:49.903 --> 00:20:51.903
He gave us this awareness

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:57.140
of human, or He keeps that awareness within us.

00:20:57.561 --> 00:21:00.291
We have to accept Him as a person

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:04.453
who gives us this awareness of human relationship.

00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:11.349
And whenever there has been problem

00:21:12.234 --> 00:21:16.063
like somebody told Me that in Somnat people believe

00:21:16.248 --> 00:21:19.005
that Shri Krishna came as

00:21:20.144 --> 00:21:22.144
to give lessons. So many Hindus believe

00:21:22.879 --> 00:21:25.572
it was Shri Krishna who came as Mohammed Kuzni

00:21:25.714 --> 00:21:27.879
to give a lesson to these horrible Brahmins

00:21:28.058 --> 00:21:32.552
who were making money out of that temple. So many Hindus believe that;

00:21:36.573 --> 00:21:40.428
that to punish these horrible Brahmins who were making money

00:21:41.112 --> 00:21:44.964
He had to come as Mohammed Kuzni to break that idol

00:21:45.443 --> 00:21:48.180
which was giving them so much money and they were making

00:21:48.394 --> 00:21:50.606
all kinds of,

00:21:53.627 --> 00:21:55.629
you can say extractions,

00:21:56.311 --> 00:21:59.624
from the poor devotees who were devoted to that temple.

00:22:01.048 --> 00:22:03.488
It was only He could do it.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:13.610
So we have to understand that when we are not integrated

00:22:14.864 --> 00:22:18.483
we cannot feel the integration of our being.

00:22:19.507 --> 00:22:22.121
We are not integrated, that we have to realize.

00:22:23.417 --> 00:22:25.735
Our mind works in one way,

00:22:27.023 --> 00:22:31.390
our heart works in another way, our liver works in another way.

00:22:32.876 --> 00:22:34.789
As I told you I am quite surprised

00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:37.219
that when they have told that: 'don't drink',

00:22:37.895 --> 00:22:40.574
those people who follow these religions still go on drinking.

00:22:41.439 --> 00:22:43.732
But apart from that religion forget it.

00:22:43.771 --> 00:22:45.771
They see a man going into a pub

00:22:45.862 --> 00:22:49.101
and falling and faltering coming out,

00:22:49.318 --> 00:22:52.271
still they enter into the same to get to the same situation. Why?

00:22:53.247 --> 00:22:55.101
Because the mind tells them not to do it.

00:22:55.622 --> 00:22:58.079
Mind says: 'don't go.' The brain says: 'don't go.'

00:22:59.457 --> 00:23:03.595
But their heart is weak. They cannot. The habits.

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:07.483
All the habits come through this kind of disintegration.

00:23:08.395 --> 00:23:10.827
We are so disintegrated within ourselves,

00:23:11.174 --> 00:23:15.209
that if a person wants to do something

00:23:15.662 --> 00:23:17.316
he just does the opposite of it

00:23:18.246 --> 00:23:19.561
and that is the reason

00:23:19.897 --> 00:23:23.370
why we accept these kind of juxtapositions in life,

00:23:23.704 --> 00:23:26.770
what was told by Him about music and about everything.

00:23:30.718 --> 00:23:34.990
Music has come out of God's love to us.

00:23:35.924 --> 00:23:39.475
Anything that is not for God's love is not music.

00:23:40.334 --> 00:23:42.332
I will give you an example. There was a lady

00:23:42.814 --> 00:23:45.830
who used to do some sort of a kawali

00:23:47.102 --> 00:23:49.539
and I was on the censor board. I censored her

00:23:50.921 --> 00:23:54.403
kawalis and I said: 'this is not a kawali.'

00:23:55.044 --> 00:23:57.646
She said: 'why?' I said: 'this is called as mujra.

00:23:58.472 --> 00:24:01.411
This is horribly sensuous and horrible thing.

00:24:01.544 --> 00:24:03.623
It's an insult of God. You can't sing like that.'

00:24:04.441 --> 00:24:07.370
So she said: 'no, this is kawali.' I said:

00:24:07.538 --> 00:24:10.032
'do you know kawali was never sung by women

00:24:10.942 --> 00:24:13.806
and was never done in this dirty fashion the way

00:24:13.942 --> 00:24:16.379
like a prostitute you are singing this kawali?'

00:24:17.257 --> 00:24:20.751
It's always all the music was in the praise of God.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.350
And that's why Mohammed Sahib said

00:24:22.562 --> 00:24:25.714
that all the music should be in the praise of God

00:24:25.933 --> 00:24:29.160
and should not be. So we had other things like nath and all that.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.378
But you find even at the time of Shri Krishna all the music

00:24:34.631 --> 00:24:38.301
was to be just done for Rasa.

00:24:38.483 --> 00:24:40.885
Ra. Ra is 'energy'. Sa means 'same'.

00:24:41.598 --> 00:24:43.797
With Radha they were playing together,

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.853
playing Rasa and that's how they were doing

00:24:48.798 --> 00:24:52.470
the circulation of the energy to integrate themselves

00:24:52.695 --> 00:24:58.518
and singing the music. It is for that. But you find that

00:24:59.256 --> 00:25:01.608
people don't understand.

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:03.733
They use music for sensuousness.

00:25:04.014 --> 00:25:06.396
Is anti-God. This music force

00:25:06.541 --> 00:25:09.494
has come to us to praise God that's all. For nothing else.

00:25:10.172 --> 00:25:12.137
For doing all kinds of dirty things and

00:25:12.443 --> 00:25:14.703
singing all kinds of funny things. Imagine.

00:25:14.734 --> 00:25:16.524
And the reaction is built in so much.

00:25:16.783 --> 00:25:18.615
When He said that all the music

00:25:19.422 --> 00:25:21.525
should be in the name of God, we have a person like

00:25:21.582 --> 00:25:23.476
Horam Zebu who would not take to any music.

00:25:24.134 --> 00:25:28.038
He was such a staunchy fellow and the other Muslims who came in

00:25:28.304 --> 00:25:31.030
would not sing anything that is kawali or anything,

00:25:31.274 --> 00:25:32.996
would sing horrible gazals

00:25:35.343 --> 00:25:37.773
which are just describing the separation

00:25:38.326 --> 00:25:41.133
of a woman and a man and all kinds of dirty things.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:49.353
With this disintegrated temperaments people took to anything

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:54.045
that came to them just to please themselves. When the advent

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.791
of this thing like Omar Khayyam.

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:58.343
Who is he? He's anti-God absolutely anti-God man.

00:25:58.862 --> 00:25:59.557
Horrible.

00:25:59.581 --> 00:26:02.737
But people appreciate him very much, Omarkhyam what a poetry it is.

00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:09.277
They appreciate - why? Because the disintegrated part of their heart

00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:11.220
likes Omarkhyam when he sings:

00:26:11.381 --> 00:26:13.114
'Oh we should drink here.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.969
What is there in this life? We don't know what is going to be there.'

00:26:16.129 --> 00:26:18.660
Because Mohammed Sahib has said not to drink,

00:26:18.716 --> 00:26:22.240
he must sing such a song. This is the poetry of Mr. Omarkhyam,

00:26:22.452 --> 00:26:24.452
who is being very much respected everywhere.

00:26:28.627 --> 00:26:32.144
And he's very much regarded as a great poet

00:26:33.054 --> 00:26:40.957
in Iraq where today Khomeini is one great horrible man is born

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.805
and he still respects this Omarkhyam; I don't know how can he respect him.

00:26:45.977 --> 00:26:50.208
What a contrast it is, just see, what a contrast this Omarkhyam

00:26:50.425 --> 00:26:51.374
singing dirty songs.

00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:55.548
They are not in praise of God.

00:26:56.095 --> 00:26:59.837
Music which is not in the praise of God is not music. Is ashleel.

00:27:00.862 --> 00:27:07.676
Is filth. Is dirt. Our classical music in India

00:27:08.084 --> 00:27:10.627
was based on AUM.

00:27:13.249 --> 00:27:15.563
Even at Kundalini when it reaches here

00:27:15.959 --> 00:27:18.169
at the vishuddhi chakra it makes all the sounds:

00:27:18.263 --> 00:27:21.557
a, A, e, E, u, U, Ey, Ai, Ru, RU,

00:27:21.949 --> 00:27:25.952
LRu, LRU, O, Au, am, aH

00:27:26.204 --> 00:27:30.688
All these sixteen vowels are coming from the sixteen chakras

00:27:32.639 --> 00:27:36.567
or the sub-chakras or the petals of this vishuddhi chakra.

00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:41.090
These are Bija mantras of the vishuddhi chakra.

00:27:41.156 --> 00:27:43.156
All the vowels come from here

00:27:44.158 --> 00:27:51.725
and when we sing dirty songs we spoil this chakra vishuddhi.

00:27:52.156 --> 00:27:54.184
That's why all the people

00:27:54.337 --> 00:27:57.803
who sing these dirty songs have to take to drinking,

00:27:57.951 --> 00:28:00.024
because I think they can't bear,

00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:03.305
or they can't do it,

00:28:04.323 --> 00:28:06.323
they can't sing these bad songs

00:28:06.638 --> 00:28:11.183
unless and until they take to some sort of an escape from God.

00:28:12.349 --> 00:28:15.809
So music and drinking started going hand in hand.

00:28:18.214 --> 00:28:21.363
In the West the music broke all its traditions

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:28.605
because they had no sense left in them

00:28:29.224 --> 00:28:31.966
to recognize that music is meant only for God.

00:28:32.309 --> 00:28:36.782
Only for hymns to be sung in the praise of God. All music

00:28:36.873 --> 00:28:38.122
should be in the praise of God.

00:28:38.255 --> 00:28:41.466
All ragas should be in the praise of God.

00:28:42.382 --> 00:28:44.977
We had no Namas system of different times,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.752
but we have a system of music in different times.

00:28:48.543 --> 00:28:51.130
At different time a certain music should be played

00:28:51.441 --> 00:28:53.069
where you describe a mood.

00:28:53.311 --> 00:28:55.311
And all the moods that are described

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.567
have to relate themselves to God.

00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:04.203
There is no other mood that is enjoyable to the spirit

00:29:05.489 --> 00:29:11.599
that does not relate to God. There's no mood

00:29:12.591 --> 00:29:17.693
which one can enjoy. Even Bhivatsa the mood of Bhivatsa is grotesque.

00:29:18.499 --> 00:29:20.326
Even that mood one enjoyed,

00:29:20.606 --> 00:29:27.003
one can listen to when they see the filth and dirt. The left side.

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:32.364
Is so scientific. Our music system is extremely scientific,

00:29:32.487 --> 00:29:39.209
because it was taken in the form of this music

00:29:39.464 --> 00:29:43.367
with actually the Kundalini moving into different these Sapta Swaras.

00:29:43.614 --> 00:29:48.613
These seven Swaras are built in our seven chakras:

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.650
It start with Sa,

00:29:53.985 --> 00:29:59.726
then Re, Ga, Ma - Mother, Pa,

00:30:00.444 --> 00:30:02.444
Dha, Ni.

00:30:02.791 --> 00:30:04.453
My name also starts with Ni.

00:30:06.953 --> 00:30:08.953
These seven Swaras

00:30:10.816 --> 00:30:15.049
are built in with seven notes and there are vrikrutis.

00:30:15.601 --> 00:30:18.639
Vrikrut Swaras which are the side other

00:30:19.289 --> 00:30:24.235
what you call chakras that we have

00:30:25.249 --> 00:30:29.270
to make about twelve Swaras.

00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:33.428
But nobody understood the real meaning of music.

00:30:35.003 --> 00:30:39.744
Sharada the Goddess of Saraswati is the one

00:30:39.948 --> 00:30:43.087
who carries the message of Virata within us

00:30:44.281 --> 00:30:46.789
and tells us how to sing.

00:30:48.937 --> 00:30:51.411
She tells us what is appealing to God.

00:30:51.695 --> 00:30:54.548
How these ragas were made also just think of it.

00:30:55.562 --> 00:30:58.141
Because first they choose the notes

00:30:58.999 --> 00:31:01.483
the aroha avrohas, the going up and down,

00:31:01.877 --> 00:31:03.458
which was appealing to God.

00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:06.594
So the melodies were created.

00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:07.976
Melodies are fixed.

00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:11.910
You cannot change the melodies the notes, because

00:31:12.073 --> 00:31:15.697
they found out that at this point the spirit awakened.

00:31:17.234 --> 00:31:18.980
On the vibrations they found out.

00:31:19.063 --> 00:31:23.638
They found out that when they sang this way it did - worked out.

00:31:24.534 --> 00:31:28.304
The Veena they played and they found out the exact Swaras.

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:36.103
Exact Swaras which would really make you feel nice.

00:31:36.514 --> 00:31:39.033
Now you know that those people who are from -

00:31:39.278 --> 00:31:40.181
have come from the West

00:31:40.635 --> 00:31:44.433
don't understand any Indian music on the mental level.

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:47.599
But they understand at the spiritual level

00:31:48.009 --> 00:31:52.049
because their spirits get filled with joy

00:31:52.227 --> 00:31:53.808
and the vibration starts flowing.

00:31:55.298 --> 00:31:59.877
The sense of music - this depiction of music was done by Shri Krishna.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.824
It is He the One who taught Tala.

00:32:05.055 --> 00:32:11.767
Of course we can say that Shiva is the One who dances the Tala,

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.055
but the One who depicted it for human beings

00:32:15.623 --> 00:32:17.614
who gave the message to the world

00:32:18.513 --> 00:32:20.513
how the Tala should be, is

00:32:20.912 --> 00:32:24.109
Shri Krishna through His dancing movements.

00:32:26.494 --> 00:32:28.290
He kept the Tala all the time,

00:32:30.036 --> 00:32:33.516
like the way He stands itself suggests how He kept the Tala.

00:32:35.699 --> 00:32:37.341
And He played the mudlhi also

00:32:37.917 --> 00:32:42.615
to suggest that music is what God's love is.

00:32:43.878 --> 00:32:46.677
His music is suggestive of God's love.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:52.221
That soothes you. That clears you. That makes you happy.

00:32:52.663 --> 00:32:54.505
That gives you joy.

00:32:55.365 --> 00:33:00.960
And that's why He suggested through His singing, through His music.

00:33:02.917 --> 00:33:04.796
He never wrote any poetry did He?

00:33:05.395 --> 00:33:09.829
He never wrote any poetry as such, but when He spoke,

00:33:10.936 --> 00:33:15.752
when He spoke in gadya in the prose it became Gita.

00:33:17.675 --> 00:33:19.971
Just when He spoke it became Gita.

00:33:20.927 --> 00:33:23.498
Of course people have tried to spoil

00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:27.472
quite a lot of it - the rhythm, which I feel sometimes when

00:33:27.724 --> 00:33:31.018
people recite it, but still

00:33:31.554 --> 00:33:34.014
we must say when He really created it, it was

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:41.407
for human beings to create poetry out of prose.

00:33:42.034 --> 00:33:43.140
Out of prose.

00:33:45.843 --> 00:33:48.066
He made it communicable.

00:33:48.628 --> 00:33:52.053
Because people could first only understand the music,

00:33:52.137 --> 00:33:54.897
the rhythm of the music. They didn't understand

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.335
much words and things but He made it possible.

00:33:59.898 --> 00:34:01.462
Even in Koran, if you read,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:06.245
the few words before starting every chapter nobody understands.

00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:08.426
They are all nothing but mantra bijas;

00:34:11.481 --> 00:34:12.498
but they put it there.

00:34:12.567 --> 00:34:13.916
They knew people won't understand,

00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:15.939
but He put it there because people would understand.

00:34:18.772 --> 00:34:21.025
All these things you may not understand.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.679
You may not understand Me either,

00:34:24.436 --> 00:34:28.973
possibly, but whatever they did was for your heetha.

00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:32.682
This is what happened, at the time of Shri Krishna

00:34:32.891 --> 00:34:36.201
that He established the concept of heeth,

00:34:37.828 --> 00:34:42.173
because it was said that you must speak the truth

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:45.996
and you must speak the thing that is sweet, Pria.

00:34:49.083 --> 00:34:53.530
It was the message of Shri Krishna that you must speak sweetly.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.410
Those people who have

00:34:58.379 --> 00:35:01.655
got a proper vishuddhi chakra speak very sweetly.

00:35:01.909 --> 00:35:04.931
Their voice has that enchanting method

00:35:05.146 --> 00:35:07.421
of capturing the hearts of people

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.770
and not debasing them, but elevating them.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.175
So He said you must do it sweetly.

00:35:15.282 --> 00:35:17.282
That was His main theme.

00:35:17.303 --> 00:35:20.931
Everything He did so sweetly that He created a leela

00:35:20.959 --> 00:35:24.023
out of His doings. It was a leela that he made.

00:35:24.118 --> 00:35:28.099
He said this world is not a place where you should be serious,

00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:30.164
you should be sharp,

00:35:30.736 --> 00:35:34.606
you should be tense, but it's a leela. Just see the leela, the drama.

00:35:35.084 --> 00:35:38.084
The whole is a drama. So the whole thing is very sweet.

00:35:38.207 --> 00:35:42.788
If you see the whole world as a drama it becomes a sweet thing.

00:35:43.662 --> 00:35:47.718
The sweetness of it, even if you see a person

00:35:47.908 --> 00:35:51.304
trying to be funny, you get a joy out of it.

00:35:53.173 --> 00:35:54.545
If you know it's a drama

00:35:54.668 --> 00:35:57.586
you don't get worried if somebody comes and murders somebody

00:35:57.617 --> 00:35:59.617
and you know it's all fake, it's a drama.

00:36:00.282 --> 00:36:04.297
It's a drama going on and that's what He told people

00:36:04.394 --> 00:36:06.182
that the whole thing is a leela

00:36:06.337 --> 00:36:09.226
so that people should not get into serious moods and

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.236
actually start acting in the drama in the real way.

00:36:12.602 --> 00:36:15.635
Like, you see, you appoint somebody as,

00:36:17.361 --> 00:36:20.621
say, Shivaji Maharaj

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.548
and there is somebody coming from the other side and he takes

00:36:25.824 --> 00:36:28.130
a sword and he really hits

00:36:28.924 --> 00:36:32.932
the fellow there and you say this Shivaji Maharaj actor is no good;

00:36:32.965 --> 00:36:36.739
he gets absolutely involved into the thing and hits the other person.

00:36:39.025 --> 00:36:42.719
So it's a drama and He made it into a leela.

00:36:43.509 --> 00:36:47.026
Leela because it's a drama no doubt. But when,

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.521
when you get realized you start seeing the drama and the play

00:36:50.767 --> 00:36:51.994
and the whole thing is,

00:36:52.433 --> 00:36:55.594
you must have seen that most of the Sahaja Yogis are always laughing,

00:36:56.173 --> 00:36:58.414
because they see the way things are happening.

00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:02.675
Even when they see a guru misbehaving or something

00:37:02.815 --> 00:37:04.980
they just feel like laughing how absurd it is.

00:37:05.929 --> 00:37:08.844
Like somebody came today to talk to Me

00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:13.125
and he told Me: 'Mother, I have been to all kinds of nonsensical things.'

00:37:13.143 --> 00:37:16.003
And he was just laughing. He said: 'I laugh at them now what I did.'

00:37:16.285 --> 00:37:19.686
He said: 'I went to one guru who is going to - who used

00:37:19.761 --> 00:37:21.334
to give name to people;

00:37:21.502 --> 00:37:22.958
say this Nama that Nam.

00:37:23.297 --> 00:37:26.503
I made such efforts, I went to people,

00:37:26.557 --> 00:37:29.540
recommended my case.' Because he was not so rich,

00:37:29.618 --> 00:37:31.722
you see, so he was never bought the name

00:37:31.943 --> 00:37:33.795
and he was saying: 'give me the name.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.472
I must have the name.' And the guru was

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.490
saying; 'No, no, no, no. You have to wait still...'

00:37:37.669 --> 00:37:40.554
He said: 'I poured so much money in his savapati

00:37:40.792 --> 00:37:44.095
and which were large savapatis were put. I did everything,

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:46.284
but he would not give me a name

00:37:46.693 --> 00:37:49.005
and ultimately when it

00:37:49.078 --> 00:37:51.484
came to that he said: 'all right I'll give you a name',

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.619
and he gave me a name

00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:56.852
which I started taking. I really became mad after that.

00:37:56.871 --> 00:37:59.171
I started getting headaches, this that.

00:37:59.623 --> 00:38:01.623
Then he said; 'all right you have to suffer.

00:38:01.977 --> 00:38:04.227
If you don't suffer you must go through it.

00:38:04.414 --> 00:38:06.546
Yes you must. You asked for the name so you have it.'

00:38:07.008 --> 00:38:08.395
And when he came to Me,

00:38:08.687 --> 00:38:11.997
he was looking like nothing on earth, I tell you.

00:38:12.164 --> 00:38:14.091
In a very funny shape he came to Me,

00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:16.550
but now he's completely cured.

00:38:16.571 --> 00:38:19.190
I could not even recognize him the other day I just saw him.

00:38:19.637 --> 00:38:21.649
I said: 'Oh God are you the same person?'

00:38:22.039 --> 00:38:24.211
So he said: 'Mother now I laugh at all these things

00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:28.147
and I just see that how people are stupid

00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:32.708
to go to these false people, follow false ideas and

00:38:33.029 --> 00:38:36.356
false conceptions and how they are missing the point.'

00:38:39.172 --> 00:38:40.540
And he asked Me a question:

00:38:40.693 --> 00:38:44.295
'have they to go to that limit of destruction to come to You?'

00:38:44.827 --> 00:38:47.554
I said: 'I don't know about them what they have decided.'

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.803
But it is true that people are so stupid

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:57.113
that they take to all these ideas and all these negative things

00:38:57.482 --> 00:39:00.263
much more easily than to the positive things,

00:39:00.944 --> 00:39:04.070
because of the vishuddhi chakra being spoilt.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.490
If your vishuddhi chakra is not spoilt, your hands are working better.

00:39:10.495 --> 00:39:12.181
Many people who get realization

00:39:13.052 --> 00:39:14.973
do not feel vibrations in the hands,

00:39:15.276 --> 00:39:18.616
because their vishuddhi chakras are not all right.

00:39:19.075 --> 00:39:22.588
Now what does that mean that your vishuddhi chakra is not all right?

00:39:22.821 --> 00:39:26.666
First of all by temperament you are not a collective person -

00:39:27.325 --> 00:39:33.639
by temperament. You are not a person who enjoys collectivity much.

00:39:33.826 --> 00:39:35.489
Like people who are fussy.

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:38.436
'I want this. I want that.

00:39:38.768 --> 00:39:42.575
I want to sleep on a proper bed.

00:39:42.651 --> 00:39:46.154
I must have this. I must do that.' This kind of an 'I'.

00:39:46.421 --> 00:39:48.758
Those who have too much 'I' in them

00:39:49.164 --> 00:39:53.104
because both the ego and super-ego start from this vishuddhi chakra.

00:39:54.053 --> 00:39:58.688
You see a man who is an egoistical person is

00:39:59.186 --> 00:40:02.458
not able to see the collectivity at all because

00:40:02.654 --> 00:40:04.303
he is separated with the rest of them.

00:40:04.831 --> 00:40:09.793
His Omkara covers his being so much that he cannot enjoy the collectivity.

00:40:11.296 --> 00:40:17.159
Now you see Shri Krishna live with whom? With gopis who little, little boys.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.647
He went and used to look after His cows. Just looking after the cows.

00:40:25.401 --> 00:40:27.737
None of these incarnations you'll find

00:40:28.176 --> 00:40:30.434
were interested in rich people or anything.

00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:35.161
He went and stayed

00:40:35.722 --> 00:40:40.852
with people who were very ordinary from the worldly point of view

00:40:42.245 --> 00:40:46.682
and there He played and there He did all these tricks of sweetness.

00:40:47.627 --> 00:40:54.307
He used to steal the butter. He used to steal the butter,

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.202
and many people who are criticizing Him

00:40:59.422 --> 00:41:01.685
always say: 'Oh He was a thief.

00:41:01.906 --> 00:41:05.641
Yes He was a thief. He was the thief of the thieves.' And so on.

00:41:06.556 --> 00:41:08.169
He used to steal the butter,

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.092
because this butter was taken to Mathura

00:41:12.457 --> 00:41:19.159
by these ladies to get some money. And that was giving more help

00:41:20.054 --> 00:41:26.436
to all these horrible rakshasas who were in Mathura.

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:33.013
So He didn't want this to go there and give them this good health.

00:41:33.978 --> 00:41:37.806
The best thing was to steal the butter so they don't get it

00:41:38.205 --> 00:41:40.034
and they starve on their,

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.045
they have their deficiencies of the vitamin A and D you can call it

00:41:44.222 --> 00:41:46.765
and that they suffer from bad throat

00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:49.005
and they have no strength in their hands

00:41:49.085 --> 00:41:51.085
when they pick up their swords.

00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:54.036
So this was the way to hit them

00:41:54.353 --> 00:41:58.485
so that they could not fight the forces of good.

00:41:59.738 --> 00:42:04.609
So in that He proved that a higher goal is to be achieved by giving up

00:42:04.869 --> 00:42:11.306
smaller, silly, stupid goals. The heetha. heetha is the main thing,

00:42:11.765 --> 00:42:17.927
because when He said that: 'You don't speak the truth,

00:42:20.043 --> 00:42:24.961
otherwise people will be hurt.'

00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:27.797
All right, so what should you do?

00:42:28.368 --> 00:42:31.702
You hurt the people so you don't speak the truth,

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.778
or you speak the truth you hurt the people. So both cannot go together.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:41.621
Like if I tell somebody: 'Oh you are so bad.' That person gets hurt.

00:42:42.134 --> 00:42:45.863
Now if I don't tell that person, that person is lost. So what to do?

00:42:47.361 --> 00:42:52.597
He found out the solution so He said: Satyam vade, Hittam vade, Priyam vade

00:42:55.570 --> 00:43:04.240
He put the word in between as heetha.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:13.628
The word heetha means 'good to your spirit;

00:43:14.401 --> 00:43:23.223
whatever is good for your spirit.' Heetha word means 'good for your spirit'.

00:43:23.674 --> 00:43:28.087
It has nothing to do with material things. It means for your spirit.

00:43:28.927 --> 00:43:30.148
For example,

00:43:30.706 --> 00:43:35.145
if I tell somebody that: 'you should not do that', he may feel bad today,

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:40.535
but if he recognizes that: 'Mother is telling me for my good',

00:43:40.942 --> 00:43:44.796
he will do it and he will gain by that in his heetha.

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:47.621
Or else if he does not do it, later on -

00:43:48.648 --> 00:43:50.861
supposing I don't tell him and if he

00:43:51.075 --> 00:43:53.788
doesn't know about it, or even if I tell him he does not do it -

00:43:53.959 --> 00:43:58.031
he is going to feel bad. So it is not priya to his spirit.

00:43:58.138 --> 00:43:59.395
It is not priya to him.

00:44:00.025 --> 00:44:04.563
So if you do something that is the heetha of a person,

00:44:04.845 --> 00:44:06.964
sometimes you have to tell a person,

00:44:09.038 --> 00:44:13.155
sometimes it may look very, very painful.

00:44:13.184 --> 00:44:14.615
The other day I told somebody that:

00:44:14.665 --> 00:44:18.671
'you don't cure anybody because you're not strong enough to cure.'

00:44:19.076 --> 00:44:20.358
He felt very hurt.

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:26.467
So then I'll say: 'all right go ahead. You better cure others,

00:44:26.653 --> 00:44:27.789
but don't come back to Me.'

00:44:29.493 --> 00:44:31.503
Then he'll land up in a lunatic asylum.

00:44:33.919 --> 00:44:36.202
But when he'll land up in the lunatic asylum

00:44:38.107 --> 00:44:41.940
then what will he say? Was that for his heetha that I said?

00:44:42.723 --> 00:44:46.720
Will he be then angry? So ultimately if you say the heetha.

00:44:47.389 --> 00:44:51.351
Say. Saying is the point. Not doing. Saying.

00:44:51.902 --> 00:44:55.328
You say the heetha with your vishuddhi chakra,

00:44:55.503 --> 00:44:59.826
then ultimately it becomes priya. Means it is liked.

00:45:02.038 --> 00:45:05.657
So you say a thing which is good for the spirit.

00:45:06.048 --> 00:45:07.593
Otherwise you just don't say.

00:45:09.023 --> 00:45:12.277
But people just say to others to correct them,

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.571
because they are aggressive. It should be done in love.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.403
Heetha means "done something in love".

00:45:20.916 --> 00:45:23.705
If you want to say something to someone in love

00:45:23.811 --> 00:45:25.503
and you feel it is necessary

00:45:25.748 --> 00:45:28.505
and the third condition you must have adhikar.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.301
You must have the right to say it to the person.

00:45:31.734 --> 00:45:33.894
If you don't have the right you just keep quiet.

00:45:34.078 --> 00:45:36.620
Let God look after. You are not in charge of anyone.

00:45:38.239 --> 00:45:40.531
But if you have to say to someone in love

00:45:40.718 --> 00:45:43.337
and if you have an adhikara then you have to say it.

00:45:43.781 --> 00:45:47.284
If you don't have the adhikar you should not say anything to anyone

00:45:47.653 --> 00:45:51.354
unless and until it is absolutely priya to that person

00:45:52.519 --> 00:45:53.969
involving his heetha.

00:45:56.647 --> 00:45:57.803
This is what He put,

00:45:58.004 --> 00:46:01.507
that you should not do any anadhikar chestha. Means you should not do

00:46:01.542 --> 00:46:02.671
something unauthorized.

00:46:03.982 --> 00:46:07.036
Like I would say somebody comes to Me and says that:

00:46:07.125 --> 00:46:09.125
'where is that person whom I want to murder?'

00:46:11.417 --> 00:46:13.371
Then what is the truth? Should I tell him: 'all right

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.796
this is the truth. You go and kill that person.' According

00:46:15.816 --> 00:46:18.989
to the strict government law it may be.

00:46:19.726 --> 00:46:23.181
I don't know if it is. I don't understand the government laws at all

00:46:23.748 --> 00:46:26.555
or the human laws. But it is not.

00:46:27.468 --> 00:46:28.823
Then what do you have to tell him?

00:46:29.546 --> 00:46:33.486
You just keep quiet. He has no Adhikar. He has no right to ask you

00:46:33.606 --> 00:46:37.378
or to get this information from you. You just keep quiet. I do.

00:46:38.363 --> 00:46:40.903
Then he may beat you - do anything. You just say: 'I don't know.'

00:46:43.888 --> 00:46:45.356
It is andikar cheestha.

00:46:53.451 --> 00:46:57.449
It is done many a times. People who are, say,

00:46:59.903 --> 00:47:05.879
great nationalists who fight for their country and

00:47:06.325 --> 00:47:08.725
people want to extract information from them.

00:47:09.404 --> 00:47:12.481
They suffer. Suffer. But they will not give the information.

00:47:13.354 --> 00:47:16.056
Not out of fear, but out of love

00:47:16.514 --> 00:47:20.418
of their fellow men who are fighting for the freedom of their country.

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:22.670
This has been done in our country many a times.

00:47:24.307 --> 00:47:26.105
So you don't speak something

00:47:26.384 --> 00:47:29.232
which is not the adhikara of another. He has no right

00:47:29.326 --> 00:47:30.244
to ask this question.

00:47:33.554 --> 00:47:36.059
Like that one has to be very discreet

00:47:36.308 --> 00:47:39.685
and that is what Shri Krishna has given us - His discretion.

00:47:41.842 --> 00:47:44.094
 Many people ask Me: 'Mother then in this situation

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:45.041
what should I do?

00:47:45.156 --> 00:47:47.000
In that situation what should I do?'

00:47:47.158 --> 00:47:49.721
That means the person has not developed a vishuddhi chakra

00:47:49.814 --> 00:47:50.633
to be discreet.

00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.893
He has not evolved. He is not mature enough.

00:47:52.912 --> 00:47:54.305
He is still asking Me questions.

00:47:55.475 --> 00:47:56.660
In the nirvikalpa state

00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:59.273
you don't ask Me any questions. You know exactly what is to be done.

00:47:59.682 --> 00:48:02.500
When to shout at somebody. When to be quiet.

00:48:02.724 --> 00:48:06.844
When to be silent. When to say something and how far to go.

00:48:09.022 --> 00:48:12.259
All these qualities develop through proper vishuddhi chakra,

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.620
because you are doing it for the heetha of another person.

00:48:15.905 --> 00:48:18.044
Sometimes it pays much more to keep quiet.

00:48:20.959 --> 00:48:22.732
This is what He has taught us.

00:48:22.972 --> 00:48:24.031
Not only taught us

00:48:24.178 --> 00:48:29.058
but He has put it within us the discretion part in our vishuddhi chakra.

00:48:31.228 --> 00:48:36.594
He has put within us the power to witness the drama. To be detached.

00:48:37.285 --> 00:48:40.205
He was Yogeshwara. He was Yogeshwara.

00:48:40.323 --> 00:48:41.995
He was the Ishwara of yoga.

00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:44.813
He was the One who was the giver of yoga.

00:48:45.076 --> 00:48:48.026
Naturally, because Shiva is the One to be achieved.

00:48:48.388 --> 00:48:52.095
But the One who helps us is Him. Is Akbar.

00:48:55.055 --> 00:49:01.447
Is the Mahalakshmi tattwa, is the central path which takes you to Shiva.

00:49:01.804 --> 00:49:03.804
So He is the One who takes us there.

00:49:05.013 --> 00:49:07.299
It is He who is supported by all the prophets.

00:49:09.322 --> 00:49:13.418
He works out this for you. This great work of evolution.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.133
So one can understand very clearly

00:49:17.832 --> 00:49:22.421
that if our vishuddhi chakra is put right, we develop exactly

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.917
how to be discreet in Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:26.994 --> 00:49:29.795
We devise a method by which we talk so much

00:49:30.925 --> 00:49:36.891
that makes people feel priye that they appreciate, they like it, priye.

00:49:37.058 --> 00:49:40.491
It's loving and also it does their heetha.

00:49:41.047 --> 00:49:44.033
Even sometimes you have to say something which is harsh

00:49:44.237 --> 00:49:47.831
or maybe your silence may make them feel a little harsh. Doesn't matter.

00:49:49.321 --> 00:49:51.715
It will give them ultimately their heetha.

00:49:51.853 --> 00:49:54.977
So the ultimate goal is heetha. That's what Krishna had

00:49:55.253 --> 00:49:57.210
in His mind to do the heetha.

00:49:59.219 --> 00:50:02.652
So His Samhara Shakti also which He had, the killing.

00:50:03.699 --> 00:50:06.799
Many people criticize Him for that.

00:50:06.924 --> 00:50:08.854
Like the Jains you see. At the time

00:50:09.044 --> 00:50:11.356
of Shri Krishna He had a cousin called Neminath

00:50:12.068 --> 00:50:14.595
and Neminath was not Shri Krishna.

00:50:14.885 --> 00:50:19.252
He was just an ordinary human being who had achieved certain

00:50:19.381 --> 00:50:20.708
heights in evolution.

00:50:21.166 --> 00:50:24.337
He just got filled up with a kind of a feeling

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:28.397
of a repulsion about killing animals.

00:50:29.016 --> 00:50:31.266
Of course killing animals is not a very good thing,

00:50:31.653 --> 00:50:35.069
but he was not killing and it was to be done for his marriage.

00:50:36.065 --> 00:50:39.358
So he developed such a strong feeling about it that he started

00:50:39.666 --> 00:50:45.225
a different thing from real Jainism, some sort of another path,

00:50:45.443 --> 00:50:49.918
in which he said that there should be no killing of animals.

00:50:50.154 --> 00:50:53.315
It so became so ridiculously funny, that

00:50:53.387 --> 00:50:57.497
it reached a stage where bugs became more important than human beings,

00:50:57.722 --> 00:51:00.230
even mosquitoes were more important.

00:51:00.583 --> 00:51:04.543
You see those people walking with this thing covered on their faces

00:51:04.626 --> 00:51:08.085
and on the street. Everything taken to the last nonsense.

00:51:11.807 --> 00:51:14.776
So Shri Krishna gives you discretion

00:51:15.045 --> 00:51:17.766
and this was very, very, very, very, very important

00:51:19.502 --> 00:51:21.156
because all our problems

00:51:21.377 --> 00:51:24.355
of disintegration disappears when we have discretion.

00:51:25.674 --> 00:51:28.676
But mostly people don't have their vishuddhi all right.

00:51:29.572 --> 00:51:33.691
On the one side there's a right vishuddhi which gives us aggressiveness.

00:51:33.799 --> 00:51:36.024
With our talk we aggress others.

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:40.175
Most of the politicians have that kind of a capacity.

00:51:41.108 --> 00:51:44.472
But if they get mediums into them like supra-conscious,

00:51:44.904 --> 00:51:49.314
like Hitler had. He learnt it from some Tibetan lamas

00:51:49.348 --> 00:51:52.916
who taught them these all dirty tricks of overpowering people.

00:51:53.047 --> 00:51:55.458
He managed to put such spirits into them,

00:51:55.598 --> 00:51:57.354
that they killed thousands and

00:51:57.482 --> 00:52:00.381
thousands and thousands and thousands of human beings.

00:52:03.963 --> 00:52:05.923
The left vishuddhi is another problem.

00:52:06.408 --> 00:52:08.216
Such people also don't have

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:11.003
a collectivity sense because they are frightened of others.

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:15.436
They are so negative they always see the negative side of another person.

00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:18.520
I have seen people who come and tell Me

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:20.190
about every Sahaja Yogi:

00:52:20.229 --> 00:52:23.358
'that's wrong with that Sahaja Yogi. This is wrong with that Sahaja Yogi.

00:52:23.411 --> 00:52:25.563
That's wrong with...' No positive points at all.

00:52:25.774 --> 00:52:27.096
They only see the negative point.

00:52:29.068 --> 00:52:31.728
So they have no collectivity. They are always have fear.

00:52:31.936 --> 00:52:33.505
All the time they are frightened

00:52:33.656 --> 00:52:36.215
of others because there's something in them that frightens them.

00:52:39.253 --> 00:52:40.944
So they have their left vishuddhi

00:52:41.135 --> 00:52:43.135
very badly caught up because they are guilty.

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:45.440
Specially in the West, you will be surprised,

00:52:45.475 --> 00:52:47.558
who are supposed to be such aggressive people.

00:52:48.941 --> 00:52:52.919
They have terrible left vishuddhi, because they,

00:52:53.645 --> 00:52:57.335
by their doing, build up a very big guilt within themselves.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.647
They see how they have been behaving.

00:53:00.662 --> 00:53:02.856
Their community has been behaving.

00:53:02.876 --> 00:53:06.425
Their country has been behaving. They develop a big guilt in their mind.

00:53:06.568 --> 00:53:11.651
Moreover, as Brian has told you, that it is cut -

00:53:13.249 --> 00:53:19.277
the roots are cut and you start behaving in an anti-God manner

00:53:19.377 --> 00:53:21.875
even without realizing that it's absolutely wrong.

00:53:22.701 --> 00:53:27.750
It's true. The left vishuddhi comes up because they feel guilty,

00:53:29.078 --> 00:53:32.413
despite their doing wrong things

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.355
with the knowledge that they are doing the right thing.

00:53:35.583 --> 00:53:37.889
They feel guilty because in the sub-conscious

00:53:39.838 --> 00:53:42.554
the conscience of a person works it out

00:53:42.603 --> 00:53:46.341
and that guilt is accumulating howsoever you may deny it,

00:53:46.755 --> 00:53:48.982
but the left side goes on catching

00:53:49.086 --> 00:53:51.564
and they have a left vishuddhi. So one has to say that:

00:53:51.601 --> 00:53:52.658
'Mother, I am not guilty.'

00:53:54.177 --> 00:53:55.652
Is another side of ego

00:53:55.825 --> 00:53:59.351
where the ego's reaction hides itself into left vishuddhi.

00:54:02.969 --> 00:54:04.610
And with that they start feeling guilty:

00:54:04.624 --> 00:54:07.146
'I should not have done that. I should not have done that.'

00:54:07.325 --> 00:54:08.892
Both attitudes are wrong.

00:54:09.862 --> 00:54:12.881
When you are on the left side you aggress yourself

00:54:13.162 --> 00:54:17.558
and torture yourself and when you are on the right side you torture others

00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:19.387
and aggress them.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:21.873
So to be in the center is only possible

00:54:22.022 --> 00:54:23.651
if your vishuddhi chakra is all right.

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:28.687
Otherwise you cannot.

00:54:29.757 --> 00:54:31.205
You have seen many people

00:54:31.543 --> 00:54:32.878
when they get realization

00:54:32.879 --> 00:54:35.390
they don't feel vibrations on both the hands equally.

00:54:35.851 --> 00:54:37.851
The reason is they have no balance.

00:54:38.454 --> 00:54:40.901
It shows on the hands. They have no balance.

00:54:40.947 --> 00:54:44.107
Now hands are very important part of human beings after Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:44.986 --> 00:54:47.375
If your hands do not have equals,

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:49.813
equal vibrations, then something wrong with you.

00:54:50.164 --> 00:54:51.899
Whatever side you do not have

00:54:53.128 --> 00:54:56.902
vibrations, say, if you don't have vibrations right side or

00:54:57.292 --> 00:55:01.249
you feel that right side is heavy, or

00:55:01.276 --> 00:55:05.491
is hot, then definitely you are right sided person.

00:55:06.152 --> 00:55:09.779
In such cases maybe left side is absolutely numb.

00:55:09.962 --> 00:55:13.339
Those people have numb left side means also they are right sided.

00:55:15.828 --> 00:55:20.689
But in the left hand if you have more vibrations and on the right hand

00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:21.831
you don't have any,

00:55:22.155 --> 00:55:25.325
then also it means that you are right sided,

00:55:28.499 --> 00:55:32.078
not that you are left sided. But on the other side

00:55:32.167 --> 00:55:35.322
if you have the other way round then you are a left sided person.

00:55:35.576 --> 00:55:37.780
That means the balance is not there. Your hand says

00:55:37.973 --> 00:55:39.196
that there should be balance.

00:55:41.197 --> 00:55:44.107
So you must know that only by thinking

00:55:44.417 --> 00:55:47.398
you are not going to get rid of your troubles in Sahaja Yoga you

00:55:47.424 --> 00:55:49.055
have to work with your hands. As I told you

00:55:49.182 --> 00:55:51.408
that just by thinking you can't drive your car,

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.495
you have to use your hands.

00:55:52.539 --> 00:55:54.539
You have to use your hands with full knowledge

00:55:54.677 --> 00:55:55.924
as to where you are,

00:55:55.974 --> 00:55:58.219
what you are and what would these vibrations mean.

00:55:58.276 --> 00:56:01.608
You have to use your hands. Now when you start using your hands

00:56:01.765 --> 00:56:03.400
for all practical purposes

00:56:03.524 --> 00:56:06.088
other people might start thinking: 'these people have gone mad.

00:56:06.122 --> 00:56:07.211
They are using their hands.'

00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:09.616
But the same way they thought when Mohammed Sahib

00:56:09.664 --> 00:56:10.918
taught them to use their hands.

00:56:12.504 --> 00:56:14.669
They all laughed at Him but now

00:56:15.488 --> 00:56:17.926
nobody is ashamed of it, nobody laughs at it

00:56:18.148 --> 00:56:21.148
but they are doing all mechanically - not the way He has said.

00:56:26.807 --> 00:56:29.735
So first of all use these hands for your own purpose.

00:56:30.158 --> 00:56:32.152
For yourself. These same hands can help you.

00:56:32.668 --> 00:56:34.478
Now the Kundalini has awakened;

00:56:34.692 --> 00:56:38.892
so it is passing through all the centers in a very thin way maybe,

00:56:38.992 --> 00:56:39.790
but it is there.

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:42.422
So first raise it more and more. You can do it with your hands.

00:56:44.137 --> 00:56:46.365
It's, it's a circle

00:56:46.717 --> 00:56:49.426
when your hands raise it it starts flowing more in your hands.

00:56:49.766 --> 00:56:52.572
Only your hands can raise it. It starts flowing in your hands.

00:56:53.043 --> 00:56:55.309
Giving yourself a Bandhan or raise yourself -

00:56:55.396 --> 00:56:58.726
raise your Kundalini. Learn all these methods carefully.

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:00.478
Your hands are very important.

00:57:01.082 --> 00:57:03.842
If your hands are not working, you be careful on that.

00:57:08.431 --> 00:57:11.531
You have to get your vibrations in your hands to begin with.

00:57:12.105 --> 00:57:14.311
Some people who have had problems with their hands,

00:57:14.838 --> 00:57:17.423
because of previous life or some sort of a thing,

00:57:17.693 --> 00:57:22.244
they feel their chakras in the - their own places.

00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:28.713
Then after some times you'll start feeling your chakras in your brain.

00:57:33.937 --> 00:57:34.758
Doesn't matter.

00:57:34.946 --> 00:57:37.465
You will never feel anything uncomfortable with it.

00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:38.720
You will be able to manage.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.573
After that you need not feel the chakras at all. You don't feel anything.

00:57:43.642 --> 00:57:47.920
You just say; 'this is it.' Finished. They just know.

00:57:49.973 --> 00:57:51.500
That also 'knowing'

00:57:51.737 --> 00:57:55.272
comes through your vishuddhi and you just say it, again say it.

00:57:57.145 --> 00:58:00.930
The most important function of the vishuddhi chakra is

00:58:01.197 --> 00:58:04.029
that it should be pure and clean because

00:58:04.082 --> 00:58:07.058
if you have to say mantras your vishuddhi has to be clean.

00:58:08.894 --> 00:58:12.388
All the mantras have to have the help of vishuddhis.

00:58:12.651 --> 00:58:14.368
When a guru gives a mantra,

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:18.593
first thing you'll find he will have a left vishuddhi catch

00:58:19.747 --> 00:58:23.337
and any other chakra whatever the chakra the guru has attacked.

00:58:23.709 --> 00:58:25.545
But first will be on the left vishuddhi

00:58:25.667 --> 00:58:28.881
so for that we use the mantra of mantrasiddhi

00:58:29.872 --> 00:58:33.368
The mantrasiddhi comes on a person when his left vishuddhi is all right

00:58:33.506 --> 00:58:35.172
otherwise he cannot be mantrasiddha.

00:58:35.593 --> 00:58:38.152
Whatever mantras they say is all mechanical.

00:58:39.922 --> 00:58:43.763
Your left vishuddhi should be all right if you have to say the mantras

00:58:43.928 --> 00:58:47.489
in a proper way to be effective to have enlightened mantras.

00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:51.101
Even Allah ho Akbar has no meaning if your left vishuddhi is not all right.

00:58:54.024 --> 00:58:57.643
So you will see how in Sahaja Yoga left vishuddhi is important

00:58:57.784 --> 00:58:59.947
and right vishuddhi is important for vibrations.

00:59:00.949 --> 00:59:09.066
So vishuddhi chakra plays a tremendous part, role in, in Sahaja Yoga

00:59:10.756 --> 00:59:14.417
because it connects you to the Virat, to the whole.

00:59:14.687 --> 00:59:16.024
So you come to the point

00:59:16.155 --> 00:59:18.792
where you know that it is trough vishuddhi chakra.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.900
You know the whole Akbar.

00:59:22.218 --> 00:59:23.539
You get connected with Him.

00:59:23.988 --> 00:59:26.398
The rapport is established through vishuddhi chakra

00:59:27.156 --> 00:59:29.156
and you can feel it, is communicated.

00:59:29.939 --> 00:59:32.374
The rapport may be, supposing the hands are cut,

00:59:32.768 --> 00:59:35.382
still you might get your Realization. Many get it.

00:59:36.009 --> 00:59:38.658
But if you do not have your hands intact,

00:59:38.914 --> 00:59:40.550
then the communication is poor.

00:59:42.785 --> 00:59:44.785
Then maybe on your chakras you will start

00:59:44.953 --> 00:59:47.261
developing the communication later on.

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:49.902
But this is the easiest way

00:59:50.031 --> 00:59:54.099
to feel the communication in your hands, if your hands are sensitive.

00:59:55.788 --> 00:59:58.806
So what should we do to keep the vishuddhi chakra is the problem.

00:59:59.144 --> 01:00:02.567
I have been told that I should finish My lecture soon and go away soon,

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:06.313
but I think I should finish this today about vishuddhi chakra.

01:00:06.896 --> 01:00:10.177
What should we do to keep our vishuddhi chakra all right?

01:00:10.512 --> 01:00:14.848
Steal the butter and eat it.

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:21.413
You must eat butter because it has vitamin A and D.

01:00:21.481 --> 01:00:24.153
Vitamin D especially. I am sorry. Vitamin D.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:29.482
So that calcium grows in your body. So you'll become a strong person.

01:00:30.317 --> 01:00:35.099
If you just take calcium without butter then there's a problem.

01:00:37.047 --> 01:00:44.450
So try to take butter whenever you have vishuddhi chakra problem,

01:00:44.514 --> 01:00:47.219
for physical side; I'm just telling about this.

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:52.479
You can take some butter in water, hot water; spread it on and take it.

01:00:53.386 --> 01:00:58.565
Vishuddhi chakra looks after the cooling side.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:03.495
Cooling side. Because the liver when it is heat, gives heat

01:01:03.748 --> 01:01:05.315
the body becomes heated up.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:10.179
Then the one that really cools it down is the vishuddhi chakra

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:17.430
and when you have a problem on the, on the drying of the epithelial

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:21.322
cells inside, the lining, then best thing is to take some butter

01:01:22.415 --> 01:01:26.070
in the water, or eat some butter during summer time.

01:01:26.669 --> 01:01:29.622
But no carbohydrates with it. No carbohydrates.

01:01:29.871 --> 01:01:32.917
Then you won't put on weight. You eat as much as you like - butter.

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:37.062
You will not put on weight. If you can give up carbohydrates completely

01:01:37.448 --> 01:01:40.333
you will have Satvikahara absolutely.

01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:42.567
You should not touch carbohydrates

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:46.993
and you will be amazed that you will have Satvikahara.

01:01:47.217 --> 01:01:49.217
Take butter and proteins.

01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:54.321
Take all fats, cream, everything. Nothing will go wrong with you.

01:01:55.219 --> 01:01:58.160
You can take for proteins all dried fruits, everything

01:01:58.776 --> 01:02:04.274
and just take this honey for sweet. No carbohydrates.

01:02:05.558 --> 01:02:08.832
Or also these days honey is made out of sugar as you know.

01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:12.057
So if you can avoid carbohydrates

01:02:12.553 --> 01:02:15.817
and just take these things your health will be all right.

01:02:15.903 --> 01:02:19.345
But we have patients. We have all kinds of imbalances.

01:02:19.518 --> 01:02:22.417
That's why I say, "All right, if you have a liver take sugar."

01:02:22.968 --> 01:02:26.007
But if you just give up sugar it is not going to help.

01:02:26.158 --> 01:02:28.699
You have to first correct your liver and then you

01:02:28.738 --> 01:02:30.974
can give up sugar very easily. No problem.

01:02:31.445 --> 01:02:32.540
But not before that.

01:02:32.564 --> 01:02:35.226
Like all the doctors in general say: 'don't take sugar.'

01:02:35.963 --> 01:02:40.458
The fat goes out of the body just giving the lining of the body,

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.527
the softness, and goes out of the body.

01:02:42.984 --> 01:02:44.168
It doesn't stay

01:02:44.248 --> 01:02:47.402
because if there is no carbohydrates it cannot be retained in the body.

01:02:50.207 --> 01:02:52.034
You can see at home.

01:02:52.319 --> 01:02:54.908
You put some butter on your hand. All right?

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.634
And wash it. It won't wash. It will just stick there.

01:02:57.804 --> 01:03:00.697
It will have no effect - nothing, but it will be just sticking out there.

01:03:00.936 --> 01:03:02.091
It cannot be consumed.

01:03:02.331 --> 01:03:03.728
But if you put some carbohydrate

01:03:03.807 --> 01:03:05.807
say put some arta or something you can take it out.

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:10.955
It dissolves. It cannot be dissolved if you do not take carbohydrates.

01:03:11.608 --> 01:03:15.059
But this is for people who do not have any imbalances in the body,

01:03:15.046 --> 01:03:16.363
who are perfectly all right;

01:03:16.615 --> 01:03:19.182
they can do it. I can do it but nobody allows Me.

01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:24.756
Everybody uses Me for feeding as if I am a wastepaper basket.

01:03:26.183 --> 01:03:29.705
If I don't eat... you see you are supposed to give Mother

01:03:29.745 --> 01:03:31.745
something like an Naivedya this much.

01:03:32.204 --> 01:03:33.954
But I have seen people when they want to give Me

01:03:33.973 --> 01:03:35.709
they'll give Me so much

01:03:36.384 --> 01:03:38.398
and if I eat a little they'll feel that:

01:03:38.424 --> 01:03:40.867
'oh what Mother is ....' I don't need it actually.

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.604
People should understand My nature.

01:03:43.467 --> 01:03:47.614
So when they serve Me, they'll serve so much that I cannot eat.

01:03:48.014 --> 01:03:49.811
I just eat little. I can manage.

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:53.867
There is no need for Me to eat carbohydrates at all, at all.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:55.650
I need not have carbohydrates.

01:03:57.383 --> 01:03:59.383
But; 'Mother I have made this.

01:03:59.438 --> 01:04:02.877
Please have it. Mother I have made these laddhus. Please have it. Mother I have...'

01:04:02.928 --> 01:04:05.992
So I say; 'All right baba now I have to suffer to please you people.'

01:04:06.482 --> 01:04:07.950
For Priya.

01:04:11.452 --> 01:04:13.817
This is what is very simple to understand

01:04:14.515 --> 01:04:16.515
that you should not force Me to eat.

01:04:16.692 --> 01:04:18.326
At all, there's no need to force Me.

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:21.800
Don't force anyone to eat 'though I do force people to eat

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:24.432
because I know they need it. But you cannot do it.

01:04:24.558 --> 01:04:27.395
You have no discretion. When you have discretion,

01:04:27.677 --> 01:04:29.851
whom to force whom not to force, then it's all right.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:34.039
Also when you force you must know that the food has to be vibrated.

01:04:34.851 --> 01:04:37.204
If it is not vibrated food if you force the person,

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:38.123
he'll have trouble.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.849
Now for all of you to understand

01:04:45.063 --> 01:04:47.368
the importance of vishuddhi chakra is

01:04:47.613 --> 01:04:49.811
first and foremost thing is that when you speak

01:04:49.861 --> 01:04:51.861
you must speak about Sahaja Yoga and nothing else.

01:04:54.397 --> 01:04:56.669
If you have to give speech - I have known many Sahaja Yogis

01:04:56.725 --> 01:04:59.470
you see who are still member of this organization,

01:04:59.498 --> 01:05:01.435
member of that organization,

01:05:01.515 --> 01:05:08.308
member of this thing of horrible organizations which are anti God.

01:05:09.634 --> 01:05:11.525
Say now for example we'll see

01:05:11.623 --> 01:05:15.865
Hari Rama Hari Krishna organization is anti Christ, anti.

01:05:15.966 --> 01:05:17.966
It is of course anti Christ openly

01:05:18.301 --> 01:05:20.995
and in the real sense is anti Krishna.

01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:22.364
Absolutely Krishna.

01:05:22.638 --> 01:05:25.116
Every person who goes there and begs

01:05:25.366 --> 01:05:27.794
in the name of God has a horrible vishuddhi

01:05:28.471 --> 01:05:31.275
and they all suffer ultimately from vishuddhi troubles;

01:05:31.445 --> 01:05:33.734
cancer - this that and they die.

01:05:35.626 --> 01:05:38.830
And the face of a person who has a good vishuddhi is blooming,

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:46.251
is wide, is full of....full, full like a full moon.

01:05:47.397 --> 01:05:50.146
And if you have a face which is all shut down

01:05:50.858 --> 01:05:52.762
that means your vishuddhi is not all right.

01:05:53.888 --> 01:05:57.484
If the vishuddhi is functioning when there has to be glow on the face.

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:02.487
The face should be full and nourished and sparkling.

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:05.715
And eyes should be sparkling because vishuddhi chakra also

01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:10.129
looks after the eyes. It looks after the neck. It looks after the ears.

01:06:10.382 --> 01:06:11.852
It looks after the nose.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.968
If your vishuddhi chakras are spoiled

01:06:14.153 --> 01:06:16.654
you have problems with all E.N.T. things.

01:06:18.906 --> 01:06:21.602
So the people who are like that;

01:06:21.783 --> 01:06:25.099
like this you see we can say the man who was the leader

01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:26.722
of that organization.

01:06:27.063 --> 01:06:29.063
They think they are doing Hari Rama Hari Krishna.

01:06:29.088 --> 01:06:32.756
Actually they are doing absolutely anti, anti Krishna activities.

01:06:32.892 --> 01:06:35.796
Absolutely. You have no business to call

01:06:35.832 --> 01:06:37.606
Krishna's name like this, like mad,

01:06:37.665 --> 01:06:41.050
standing before all the people wearing these horrible dresses

01:06:41.203 --> 01:06:44.626
of these dhoti and kurtas and which they

01:06:44.773 --> 01:06:48.120
are absolutely done in a very funny way. They don't know how to wear it;

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:49.741
the women wearing their saris

01:06:49.957 --> 01:06:52.392
and men buying those bhodis and

01:06:52.421 --> 01:06:54.925
putting them on their head and shaving their heads.

01:06:55.192 --> 01:06:56.498
Did Krishna shave His head?

01:06:57.942 --> 01:06:59.694
Did He ever shave His head? Head..

01:06:59.828 --> 01:07:03.294
the hair are actually the part of Krishna's gift.

01:07:03.492 --> 01:07:07.118
On the contrary He.. His hair are always described.

01:07:08.367 --> 01:07:09.904
Always described in the poetry.

01:07:13.891 --> 01:07:18.021
There is a story about a great Urdu poet

01:07:18.492 --> 01:07:22.463
who was an Indian.. who was a Hindu, but Urdu poet

01:07:22.596 --> 01:07:26.428
and some fanatics you see challenged him. So

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:30.418
this...they put one couplet and they said: 'you better complete this.'

01:07:31.008 --> 01:07:35.236
So he said: 'Kaafir hai woh bandhe jo nahin Islam ke'

01:07:36.917 --> 01:07:45.319
So he completed it like this: 'Islam ke mafiq hai
Yeshu mere Ghanshyam ke, Kaafir hai woh bandhe jo nahin Islam ke'

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:52.149
His hair are described in every poetry are used.

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:55.544
Here they are shaving their heads, putting these bhodis on their heads

01:07:55.841 --> 01:08:02.375
and walking about. When did Krishna had bald head?

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.193
Did He have a bald head? He is Yogeshwera with

01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:09.242
sixteen thousand wives; means sixteen thousand powers.

01:08:09.313 --> 01:08:12.490
He didn't have Sahaja Yogis to work out, so He got them as wives.

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:16.187
They were all yoginis within.

01:08:18.253 --> 01:08:22.528
He created all this drama and He got them as wives because

01:08:22.578 --> 01:08:25.748
a man, if he has any women as disciples,

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:30.334
then naturally he is blamed and as a man he has to have powers

01:08:30.465 --> 01:08:34.068
in the women. Women are always the power - the shakti.

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:36.849
So they came as His wives and He became

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:40.171
the husband of sixteen thousand wives

01:08:40.299 --> 01:08:45.021
and the five Ranis He had were the five elements within Him.

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:47.734
He played all the tricks.

01:08:47.754 --> 01:08:50.223
He created.....you you how will you know about Him?

01:08:50.483 --> 01:08:52.152
How far can you go understanding Him?

01:08:56.919 --> 01:09:01.385
So these people who are trying to call Shri Krishna every moment,

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:05.755
every minute, standing on the streets and begging in His name.

01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:07.995
All over the places begging like beggars.

01:09:09.866 --> 01:09:13.366
Krishna couldn't stand begging at all. Never. He believed in

01:09:13.594 --> 01:09:16.950
having a right. He would steal than to beg.

01:09:21.001 --> 01:09:23.768
All these beggars being created in the name of God.

01:09:23.886 --> 01:09:25.886
I think is one of the greatest sins

01:09:26.472 --> 01:09:28.237
to beg in the name of God.

01:09:28.885 --> 01:09:32.086
I have seen this happening before the temples and all that

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:35.464
and I used to think; 'before the temple in front of God

01:09:35.521 --> 01:09:41.098
to stand and beg. To be a fakir means to beg. What is this?

01:09:42.535 --> 01:09:44.535
Is this the sign of a Badshah [King].

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:48.611
Shri Krishna was a Badshah, Yogeshwera

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:52.258
and these beggars, they are the followers of Shri Krishna?'

01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:56.952
Horrible things. They look so miserable and they are

01:09:57.068 --> 01:10:00.327
absolutely like cabbages and many people believe

01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:01.824
that they are in peace.

01:10:02.504 --> 01:10:06.325
Naturally if you are living in a smashana you are in peace;

01:10:07.521 --> 01:10:12.442
in a dead condition. And our country, which is a poor country

01:10:12.493 --> 01:10:14.620
supporting all these beggars here, all our rich people

01:10:14.641 --> 01:10:15.976
have given them money and lands.

01:10:17.419 --> 01:10:20.444
Is this the way we are going to support these lamas

01:10:20.462 --> 01:10:21.856
who come down from there

01:10:22.056 --> 01:10:25.293
and these horrible people coming down

01:10:25.547 --> 01:10:30.061
from the west. All the people who cannot work.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.979
Very nice come here say: 'hari Rama hari Krishna',

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:36.624
and read Gita and say some few words by heart

01:10:36.776 --> 01:10:39.126
and then you earn your living here - nicely living.

01:10:39.332 --> 01:10:42.413
Every village there is one or two sitting there

01:10:42.461 --> 01:10:43.827
and begging. Can you believe it?

01:10:44.113 --> 01:10:46.113
And our government is not bothered about it;

01:10:47.644 --> 01:10:51.939
to find out who are these people, why are they here?

01:10:52.028 --> 01:10:54.779
In the name of God why are they begging like this?

01:10:55.019 --> 01:10:57.906
and we have so many poor people who are

01:10:57.927 --> 01:11:00.400
begging in the name of God. Why not collect them and help them

01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:02.339
instead of helping these horrible people?

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.773
Like this, you see, people have anti God activities

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.104
and anti Krishna activities.

01:11:10.248 --> 01:11:16.110
When you take the name of God in vain - vishuddhi catches.

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:21.907
I have known people sitting 'Wahguru,Wahguru,Wahguru'

01:11:22.342 --> 01:11:24.805
Is it so..Nanak Sahib is so cheap that

01:11:24.855 --> 01:11:27.079
we should go on taking His name 'warguru warguru warguru?'

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:30.132
They'll go on having the mala in the hand all the time.

01:11:30.297 --> 01:11:35.066
What is this going on? What do you think God to be? Is He in your pocket?

01:11:35.197 --> 01:11:38.829
Is He so cheaply available that you just go on

01:11:39.075 --> 01:11:42.406
doing all these things? Why? You spoil your vishuddhi completely.

01:11:44.225 --> 01:11:47.458
One must understand. When... you see, you are surprised at...

01:11:47.786 --> 01:11:50.241
It is said that: 'karka manka dar de, manka manka pher'

01:11:51.951 --> 01:11:56.554
Still people start doing it. Karaka means what? Vishuddhi chakra.

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.956
That's how you spoil your vishuddhi chakra. That's how you spoil your

01:12:01.838 --> 01:12:05.270
main chakra of attaining realization.

01:12:07.525 --> 01:12:10.104
So if you have to become one with the whole,

01:12:10.431 --> 01:12:12.758
please try to keep your vishuddhi chakra clear.

01:12:13.305 --> 01:12:16.339
Getting into colds because these days India

01:12:16.484 --> 01:12:18.484
especially...any, everywhere even in...

01:12:18.565 --> 01:12:22.504
women have a special tendency not to cover their body

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:25.610
because they think they are not looking very fashionable or whatever it is.

01:12:25.727 --> 01:12:27.392
Is a very modern stuff has started

01:12:28.392 --> 01:12:32.834
that they want to wear scanty dresses, scanty dresses. This is all anti God in both ways.

01:12:33.289 --> 01:12:35.289
Firstly it is nonsensical

01:12:35.824 --> 01:12:38.764
to show off your body. That's why Mohammed Sahib said -

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:40.996
you see He has worked so much on Vishuddhi chakra -

01:12:41.069 --> 01:12:42.502
that women should cover their body.

01:12:42.737 --> 01:12:44.446
Is a very good thing I sometimes think.

01:12:45.908 --> 01:12:49.298
This nonsense of fashion has gone to such a limit

01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:52.179
that after some time you'll find all these

01:12:52.221 --> 01:12:54.221
mosquitoes walking around without any clothes.

01:12:57.183 --> 01:13:00.169
That's the ultimate. You see is a sign of people who are,

01:13:00.246 --> 01:13:04.534
who are neither 'he' nor 'she'. The 'it' people do that way.

01:13:05.611 --> 01:13:09.973
Yes always. 'It' are the people who have qualities. That's why people like Rajneesh,

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.219
when people go to them, they become 'it'.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.511
Because that is their capacity: no shame at all left in them.

01:13:18.432 --> 01:13:21.402
And that is what it is, one has to understand that you should be

01:13:21.459 --> 01:13:22.971
careful about your throats.

01:13:24.644 --> 01:13:26.243
The fashions and all these things

01:13:26.273 --> 01:13:28.950
are not so important. What is important is your health.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.793
If you spoil your vishuddhi it's a very wrong thing

01:13:32.039 --> 01:13:34.707
and one should try to look after vishuddhi all the time

01:13:36.142 --> 01:13:39.213
and all of you should try to look after each other's vishuddhi.

01:13:39.264 --> 01:13:42.048
Because I didn't like the idea of having this pendal here

01:13:42.143 --> 01:13:44.238
and I told the organizers this was a wrong thing.

01:13:44.777 --> 01:13:46.777
So they said; 'You said it should be in the open.' I said:

01:13:46.838 --> 01:13:49.203
'now I'm not saying you go to Himalayas.'

01:13:49.837 --> 01:13:52.423
You must use discretion. That's the part missing.

01:13:54.893 --> 01:13:55.964
You must have discretion.

01:13:56.662 --> 01:14:02.202
To give people a thing in the mid-winter such a place;

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:05.396
I mean I must say you people are great seekers to be here.

01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:08.839
This is not proper thing to do. So the organizers,

01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:10.952
the people who are dealing with the collectivity,

01:14:10.999 --> 01:14:15.125
must know that they should do something to protect the throat of people,

01:14:15.385 --> 01:14:19.532
to protect the vishuddhu chakra. It's very important.

01:14:20.704 --> 01:14:23.448
Very important and you all know how I

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:27.432
care for your vishuddhi chakras; everybody's vishuddhi chakra.

01:14:27.716 --> 01:14:30.464
Because I know how important it is. Because it will

01:14:30.773 --> 01:14:33.010
make you absolutely disintegrated

01:14:34.035 --> 01:14:36.611
and it will spoil all the work of Kundalini

01:14:36.682 --> 01:14:38.198
and poor Kundalini will suffer so.

01:14:39.849 --> 01:14:42.638
So we have to take it upon yourselves

01:14:42.954 --> 01:14:44.954
that we'll keep our vishuddhi chakra clean.

01:14:45.249 --> 01:14:47.249
We'll clean ourselves properly

01:14:47.436 --> 01:14:50.235
and we'll clean our throats every morning

01:14:50.378 --> 01:14:54.189
and we'll take gargling and everything and look after our vishuddhi chakra.

01:14:54.314 --> 01:14:56.298
It looks very mundane but for a Mother

01:14:56.464 --> 01:14:59.114
mundane things are as important as higher things are.

01:14:59.422 --> 01:15:01.241
Because if there is no vishuddhi chakra

01:15:01.524 --> 01:15:06.605
what's the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga -  with a bad vishuddhi chakra?

01:15:08.262 --> 01:15:11.020
So please try to look after your vishuddhi chakra.

01:15:11.504 --> 01:15:13.504
Try to put Yogeshwera there.

01:15:14.348 --> 01:15:18.740
Try to raise Shri Krishna there, try to be like Him.

01:15:19.686 --> 01:15:23.339
Keep your understanding that

01:15:23.556 --> 01:15:26.638
you are here to witness the drama of God

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:32.512
and to be the murlee of Shri Krishna to watch

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:35.009
the beautiful melody flowing through you.

01:15:36.913 --> 01:15:39.839
May God bless you all.

01:15:46.211 --> 01:15:49.037
Now what is today also

01:15:49.267 --> 01:15:51.804
they don't want anyone to touch My feet. I hope

01:15:51.939 --> 01:15:58.177
today you will obey without any exception.

01:15:58.453 --> 01:15:59.663
Yesterday we tried

01:16:00.117 --> 01:16:02.888
but there were exceptions so today there should be no apwadas.

01:16:02.948 --> 01:16:03.678
Let us see.

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:07.335
One day we should not touch Mother's feet. Doesn't matter.

01:16:07.411 --> 01:16:08.638
You all can touch from there

01:16:08.997 --> 01:16:12.017
and there is a way of collectively touching Mother's feet

01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:14.850
is the way we do always. You can all do it

01:16:14.975 --> 01:16:18.771
just now but we need not actually touch, but you are actually touching.

01:16:19.932 --> 01:16:22.250
Even touching the mother earth you are touching.

01:16:23.372 --> 01:16:26.206
Just touch the mother earth and you are there.

01:16:33.068 --> 01:16:36.759
Just touch the mother earth; you will find the Kundalini rising.

01:16:45.208 --> 01:16:47.965
You haven't given Me any questions whatsoever

01:16:48.275 --> 01:16:51.617
and those who have questions should write questions and give it to Me,

01:16:51.928 --> 01:16:53.588
because once I'll go away then you will say:

01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:58.837
'Mother never allowed us to ask any questions.' I did say there are....
