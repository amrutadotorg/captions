1
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:19,875
And send Me the children ….

2
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,250
Now come along, wash My Feet.

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:29,166
Come along, both of you, come along.

4
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,999
Now put up your sleeves first of all,

5
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:38,458
put up your sleeves properly. Good.

6
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,959
Both the hands.

7
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,166
Salutations to the one who incarnates as the past.

8
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,000
Bhuta bhava.

9
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:59,917
All the left side. He’s at the base of the left side,

10
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,083
so you’ll understand what is he telling.

11
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,250
He’s the left side, the past.

12
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,875
“Bhuta” is “past.”

13
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:04,875
No, ... you first say the meaning.

14
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,166
Then you say this, so they will understand;

15
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,583
it goes into the head, all right? The first is the meaning.

16
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:14,125
Now, second one you say.

17
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,375
“Bhuta sangha” means the collection of all that is created.

18
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,917
“Bhuta sanghana videha manah”:

19
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,417
“videha” means “ in the body”,

20
00:11:54,917 --> 00:12:01,792
“manah” means “in the heart of that body,” in Sanskrit.

21
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:08,709
… In the heart.

22
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,709
“Bhutatmanaha”. Atmana is the Spirit.

23
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,166
“Bhut” means “created”: whatever is created,

24
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,834
He resides them as the Spirit.

25
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:50,208
“Bhutatmanaha.”

26
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:42,709
Now here I would like to say that it is Shri Ganesha

27
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,208
who is the Omkara, who is the vibrations.

28
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:50,000
So He is the truth. What He says is the truth,

29
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,834
so, what vibrations say is the truth.

30
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,208
He's truth.

31
00:17:55,834 --> 00:18:00,917
So Omkara is vibrations, that is Shri Ganesh.

32
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,834
“Paramadhama”.

33
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,959
Too much. Too much.

34
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:47,667
Better take one with ….

35
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:20,959
Now, you have to tie up those ….

36
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,375
Let them take photograph.

37
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:26,625
Now, can you come?

38
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:40,333
Be careful.

39
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:54,375
Can you tie?

40
00:52:55,959 --> 00:52:58,417
Did you avoid in the photograph these things? Did you avoid?

41
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,792
...showing?

42
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,166
No, no, take it out, that one.

43
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:13,750
It’s a good photograph, all right?

44
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,083
So that it’s a formidable photograph.

45
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,917
with the head of Shri Ganesha.

46
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:30,667
May God bless you all.

47
01:17:23,959 --> 01:17:30,750
Oh God...Wow, beautiful. Thank you.

48
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:50,583
From the italian sahaja yogis.

49
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:15,500
It is too much for Me. Thank you very much.

50
01:19:28,959 --> 01:19:30,417
What is that?

51
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:07,834
Wow, beautiful! Very nice. From where did you get it?

52
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:11,667
Oh, I see, is very good.

53
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:19,458
What is this? She's come from Austria all the way?

54
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:34,333
… Ah! From Austria! Thank you very much ….

55
01:21:01,709 --> 01:21:05,333
Thank you very much. How beautiful it is. Very beautiful.

56
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:07,542
Thank you very much.
