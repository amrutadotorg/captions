1
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:13,039
We started with various types of practices

2
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:20,022
of Ashtanga Yogas, eightfold yogas,
with a guru

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,760
and one had to go through lots
of hardships.

4
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:37,925
Nobody who was married, was allowed
into that Ashtanga yoga and they had to

5
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:44,979
give up their families, give up
their relationships.

6
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:52,867
They had to become absolutely
[ASIDE - Just a minute] -

7
00:00:53,222 --> 00:00:59,654
absolutely without any attachments
to go to a guru.

8
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:10,738
All their property, all their possessions 
were given up -

9
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:19,687
not to the guru, as is done in
modern times, but given away -

10
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:23,422
and this was called as Yoga.

11
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:34,363
The another style was called as Sankhya.
Sankhya is where

12
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:44,178
all your life you have to gather
things with detachment

13
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:51,304
and then to distribute them completely

14
00:01:55,574 --> 00:02:06,456
and take to a guru, in a way completely
surrender, and then get realization.

15
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:18,836
Sankhya is the right sided - sorry -
Sankhya was the left-sided behavior

16
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:32,969
and the yoga was the right-sided where the
Gayatri mantra was used was the Sankhya.

17
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:43,654
Because they were left-sided, 
they used to use Gayatri mantra.

18
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:53,914
They went so much to the left side, that
is to gather things, to gather possessions,

19
00:02:53,914 --> 00:03:03,859
to gather properties, to gather all kinds
of friends and relations and societies,

20
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:10,674
that they were afraid that they may be
completely lost into all those things.

21
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:23,829
They would go to Gayatri, the mantra
of Gayatri, which teaches you the

22
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,658
essences of all our chakras, the centres.

23
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:37,677
So the people who did Sankhya were sort of
not so much respected as spiritual people

24
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:42,919
because they thought these are all involved
into worldly things and worldly possessions

25
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:50,714
and worldly happenings, so they were
regarded as something secondary.

26
00:03:51,247 --> 00:04:03,142
Or those who were yogis of the gurus were
regarded higher because they had already

27
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:09,805
given up everything and they have gone to a
guru, giving up all the things that they have.

28
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:19,360
But here, these gurus had a problem
within themselves

29
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:27,021
because they found that those who
came to them gave up everything no doubt,

30
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:34,329
but still there was lurking attachments.
In their own ashramas they found

31
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:41,548
these people had their own attachments to
things. Though outwardly they had given up

32
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:47,676
but inside they had not given up. So they
were still sticking on to these ideas

33
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:55,947
that, uh, "Oh it's alright but still we
can have little things like that,

34
00:04:56,297 --> 00:05:01,688
doesn't matter," like that, there was
little compromises going on.

35
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:06,920
Like as we have here nunneries
and all that.

36
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,424
So both, in a way, were artificial.

37
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:22,824
The one side is the Sankhyas, were trying to
ascend with all the luggage they were carrying

38
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:32,919
and another were trying to descend
with all the ambitions of ascend.

39
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:48,629
So it was a very funny thing in every 
aspect, in both these styles of yoga.
