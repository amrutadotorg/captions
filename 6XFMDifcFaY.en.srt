00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,492
﻿Navaratri Puja, Just Surrender
Hampstead, London (UK), 19 October 1980

2
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:31,230
So you have already heard about the importance of today
in the life of the Goddess.

3
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:35,516
And that today is Ravana was killed

4
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:39,399
and that’s how there were celebrations.

5
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:46,917
It still reflects itself [unsure]

6
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:52,303
As you know very well

7
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:58,878
that all the satanic forces
which one had to face one at the time

8
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:06,635
are all back on the stage
and they are to be defeated.

9
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:10,933
The greatest problem of modern times is

10
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:16,622
that these satanic forces
have taken a very subtle form

11
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:22,134
and they enter into your psyches and into your egos.

12
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:27,436
And you are the saints, you are the bhaktas,
you are the devotees of the Goddess.

13
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:34,718
It’s a very delicate situation
when the confusion is there.

14
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:45,255
When the saints are attacked,
the aggressor can be removed,

15
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:54,243
but the saint becomes mixed up
or confused with negative forces,

16
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:58,510
which is very difficult to make him see the light.

17
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:02,917
And you have seen this situation very well.

18
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,660
And the subtler you grow, the subtler they became.

19
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:15,923
And they start giving you ideas
which are so negative,

20
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:18,746
but you cannot see them.

21
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:28,122
So the problem today is very delicate.

22
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:35,521
There are no absolute saints
and there are no absolute bad people.

23
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:37,598
Such a mixture, a confusion,

24
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:42,123
that is what is Kali Yuga is,
these modern times are.

25
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:49,626
The only way to get rid of them is to surrender.

26
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:55,362
That is the only way,
there is no other way around.

27
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:59,162
Because when you surrender,

28
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:06,632
the spirits, the negativities,
the satanic forces just disappear

29
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,261
because they are not effective.

30
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,736
They have no business to be there.

31
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:19,304
They have no interest in a person
who is surrendered to God.

32
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,984
They cannot surrender.

33
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:27,884
If they surrender, they’ll also become saints.

34
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:39,034
All the time to think: “What are my catches?
What are my negativities?” Is not going to help you.

35
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:42,674
Just surrender all these ideas that are coming to you

36
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:47,434
and you’ll find that all absurd ideas will run away.

37
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:54,504
This is the easiest way to get rid of your problems,
is just to surrender.

38
00:03:55,904 --> 00:04:10,626
After all, all these horrible people,
all the horrible deities, enemies,

39
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:24,212
who came forward to fight the Goddess, are there
as long as you nurture them.

40
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:30,042
As soon as you surrender yourself,

41
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,094
they find you of no
use for themselves

42
00:04:34,242 --> 00:04:37,832
and they go to other half-baked people.

43
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:45,766
The growth will only come,
when the surrender is complete.

44
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,703
One has to know that the powers are tremendous.

45
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,157
You cannot conceive it as it is said by Markandeya.

46
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:03,320
You cannot conceive it;
it is beyond your conception.

47
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:08,718
Outwardly you cannot understand,
you just cannot understand.

48
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:16,317
Under such circumstances,
the best thing is to surrender yourself.

49
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,669
Now with surrendering, what do you surrender?

50
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:25,531
What do you surrender?
It’s your ego and your super-ego

51
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,922
and it is completely cleansed and drenched
in the blessing.

52
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,539
Because you cannot give anything,

53
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:37,915
you have to receive the blessings

54
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:42,534
and to receive the blessings
you have to just surrender.

55
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,547
It is so simple.

56
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:50,452
The easiest way to solve all your problems
is to surrender.

57
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:59,617
Just say: “I surrender”.
For Realized souls this should be their mantra.

58
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:04,640
And you will be amazed
how all your problems will vanish.

59
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:10,723
Because not only that the powers are tremendous,

60
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:15,832
but as you are Realized souls

61
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:22,169
all the divine Forces, all the divine Deities,

62
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:25,536
all the Eternal Beings, Chiranjivas,

63
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:29,216
all the angels and the ganas,

64
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:32,028
all of them are looking after you.

65
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:37,439
But they know one thing, those who are surrendered
and those who are not surrendered.

66
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:41,238
You just surrender the problem,

67
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:45,751
and you will be surprised that
the answer will come in such a miraculous way.

68
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:51,933
Just surrender. Do not take any responsibility
upon yourself. Just surrender.

69
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:58,722
Because how far you can go into the solution?
Up to your rationality.

70
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:05,029
Beyond that you are your Spirit,
and the Spirit is connected to the Divine.

71
00:07:05,755 --> 00:07:07,818
So best is to surrender

72
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,415
and the whole thing will show such light
and such beauty and such meaning.

73
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:23,547
In the modern times now the work is not the same way
as it was where it is described,

74
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:32,336
when the Raudrarupa or that the Chandrarupa
you see there, was there at the back.

75
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:42,141
It’s a mine work, it’s a Mother,
it’s a simple, loving, compassionate.

76
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:51,636
For your protection, this rupa is there,
but you do not see it.

77
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:56,427
You are completely protected, be sure of it.

78
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,635
And all your powers after Realization
of giving Kundalini awakening,

79
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,318
or of curing people, or of talking about
Sahaja Yoga, or spreading it,

80
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:18,624
any, any kind of thing that you want
is all granted, is all flowing through.

81
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:24,905
And as you know, that there are many saints, who have said,

82
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:32,091
that “Why these Sahaja Yogis,
they should be granted this great boon?”

83
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:36,212
So one can say it’s a whim, all right.

84
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,932
There is one more thing.

85
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,476
I was happy to learn that the great poet of this country,
Blake, had prophesied about Me.

86
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:55,027
And it is so beautifully done, that He said that
England is going to be the Jerusalem.

87
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:57,640
This is going to be the pilgrimage.

88
00:08:58,257 --> 00:08:59,937
The venue has shifted.

89
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,741
And then He has very beautifully-

90
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:07,516
have you got the thing to read?
Oh, haven’t brought it.

91
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:10,810
But what reading, that He has said that

92
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:17,118
first the furnace will be burning in Surrey Hills,
where I came first,

93
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,645
and then He has mentioned Lambeth Vale,
where we have got our Ashram,

94
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:24,927
where the foundations will be laid,
we have laid the foundations.

95
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,035
And that Jerusalem is going to be in England, not in India.

96
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:35,342
And you are the people
responsible for this Jerusalem.

97
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:48,540
Today is the day for which
in India everybody is doing Puja.

98
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:56,617
And all the Sahaja Yogis today,
in every center there is a Puja today.

99
00:09:57,842 --> 00:10:00,422
And they are all thinking of you people.

100
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:13,820
So you have to receive the supreme bliss today,
the supreme bliss, only by surrender.

101
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:17,007
Today the vibrations are tremendous.

102
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:20,309
Keep all your doubts and all your nonsensical things outside.

103
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,308
Just receive it and get it.

104
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:27,029
These things are going to help you, nothing else.

105
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:30,336
Because you don’t have to give Me anything,
but receive it yourself.

106
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:33,029
Receive it as much as you can.

107
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:52,117
This Havan you know is a very good thing
for reciting the name of the Goddess.

108
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:56,129
Her eyes are given by fire, [Agni] as they say,

109
00:10:57,722 --> 00:11:05,029
and in that light, in that fire,
in the name of Goddess,

110
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,319
we awaken our Deities within us

111
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:16,821
and burn away all that is wrong in these particular chakras
which invoke those powers.

112
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:20,837
So with devotion and understanding you have to do it.

113
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:25,023
Because you are really privileged people, today,
extremely privileged.

114
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:30,428
Be proud of that,
and do with that devotion all these things.

115
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:34,648
Today is a very much better time

116
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:41,631
because the Dashara and the Navaratri,
both are combined at this time.

117
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,459
And so it has worked out very well.

118
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,118
We should do it with full devotion.

119
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:56,616
I think very few people can put in the fire,
but we can all do symbolically and say this.

120
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:00,138
And how many names do you want to take away?

121
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:03,333
Hundred-and-eight?

122
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:04,047
Sahaja Yogi: Thousand.

123
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,303
Shri Mataji: “What’s it?

124
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,931
Shri Mataji: You would like to thousand?
That is a good idea.

125
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:10,349
If you have that much devotion
it will be the best

126
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:12,744
because it will about take two hours
at the most, at the most.

127
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,480
Not two hours, I think one hour if we go fast.

128
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:17,560
Will you be able to say all that?

129
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:18,932
Do you think it’s easy?”

130
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:20,714
Sahaja Yogi: “Yes.”

131
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:23,697
Shri Mataji: “One thousand names.

132
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:27,040
Or else, you can give food to children.

133
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:28,675
They will be tired.

134
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:32,502
What do you think?
Let’s try it.

135
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,311
In India they would do one thousand.

136
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:43,030
Sahaja Yogi: Then we will do thousand.
