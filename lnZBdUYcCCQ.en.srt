1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,080
I have told them in Hindi language

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,760
that love, you can see one person's love

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,520
manifested in so many eyes here.

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,320
And when I saw the enthusiasm

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,880
also My heart got filled with great love, greater love.

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,760
So one can see how powerful is this love.

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,920
All kinds of bad feelings,

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,560
negative thinking

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,680
and also self-destructive elements

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,880
can be corrected and controlled

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,480
very simply in Sahaja Yoga,

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,080
if you with sincere heart meditate

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,280
morning and evening, twice.

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,800
That time you shouldn't see your watches, of course,

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,680
but enjoy, enjoy your meditation.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,760
That will give you such a strength to love others,

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,280
to forgive others;

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,880
instead of you feeling bad for small, small things,

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,520
you feeling irritated

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,680
because you think your self-respect is challenged,

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:52,160
or else sometimes we become aggressive towards some people,

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,680
very aggressive,

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,120
for no fault of theirs.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,480
Best thing is to see the vibrations of another person.

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,240
If the vibrations are bad, no use fighting,

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,720
it will create more confusions.

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,080
A person who has very bad vibrations,

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,720
you can't fight with that person,

29
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,360
you cannot control that person.

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,040
Or a person who is too much of self-importance,

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,640
you should not try to pacify him

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,680
or sort of try to negotiate with him,

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,720
or also sometimes people try to pamper his vanity.

34
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,840
By doing that you are spoiling him more.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,200
So the best thing is to show your love

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,840
in very sweet and different manner.

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,880
I'll give you an example which I've given many a times,

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,640
that I went to see this Gagangarh Maharaj

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,880
who was living on a very high mountain,

40
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,880
and there was no way of going by car or anything,

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,560
and I had to walk.

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,080
So everybody said, “Mother, why should You go there after all?”

43
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,640
I said, “You see the vibrations.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,440
Good vibrations coming, all right? That's why I'm going.”

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,400
But he had told many people about Me, and he said that

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,640
“Adi Shakti is born in Bombay, why do you come to me?”

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,320
So they told us.

48
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,640
So I said, “I must see this man,”

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,840
and that's how I went to his place to meet him.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,320
Now, he’s supposed to control the rain.

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,080
He could control the rain.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:08,160
So he was sitting there on a stone

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,640
and he was moving his head with great agitation,

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,760
when I reached there.

55
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,840
And it was raining so heavily

56
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,440
that I went up to his place when I was completely drenched.

57
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,040
So I went inside the cave where he used to live,

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:41,040
and he came back with great anger towards the rain.

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
So he said, “Mother,

60
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,040
why did You not allow me to control the rain?”

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,240
I said, “I didn't do that.”

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
“No, You did; because I can always control the rain,

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,000
and You were coming all the way with my invitation,

64
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,200
and this rain should not have misbehaved.”

65
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,960
I said, “No, no, he didn't misbehave.”

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,440
So what happened, he was quite in a temper, you know.

67
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
I said, “You settle down, I’ll tell you what has happened.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,480
See, you have bought a sari for Me

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,240
and you are a sanyasi,

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,560
and I won't take a sari from a sanyasi,

71
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,960
so the rain has made it convenient.

72
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,000
Now it's all drenched so I'll have to take your sari.”

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,920
Immediately, you see, he felt terrible love for Me,

74
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,320
started crying and he fell at My feet.

75
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,680
And then he said, “Mother, now I know

76
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,000
what is the greatness of love,

77
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,960
how it takes you away from mundane things

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,800
and dry behavior, and takes you to a place

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,880
where you can enjoy the showers of love.”

80
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,520
This is one of the stories I am telling you.

81
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,360
But the main thing behind the whole episode is this,

82
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,920
that you should try your love,

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,640
your tricks of pure love, pure love,

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,680
and it works.

85
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,960
And you must learn, gradually you will learn how to try.

86
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
You should not give up.

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,360
Some people are very difficult, I agree

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
– very, very difficult.

89
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,640
But at least try with people who are not so difficult.

90
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,880
And you'll be amazed that you'll have a good company

91
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,240
and lots of friends and friendship,

92
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,560
as we have here now in Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,120
First time when I came to Delhi I got such a fright of this place,

94
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,040
because there were very few Sahaja yogis

95
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,640
and they brought – I don't know why they wanted to do My puja,

96
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,400
might be Bombay people must have told them, something

97
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,640
– and they brought kum-kum and everything

98
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,080
in a plastic little, little bottles –

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,920
oh, ba! I really shrunk, you know, with their ignorance.

100
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,320
I said, “Now what to do? What will happen?”

101
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,360
But today, see, same Delhi which has become so great

102
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,240
and so beautiful, and so enthusiastic.

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,960
I saw them with their flags and

104
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,600
I didn't know there’s such a procession of flags will be here,

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,000
though we had once or twice, I think, in Cabella.

106
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,760
But how they were enjoying each other!

107
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,160
It's really remarkable.

108
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,760
If you can enjoy love,

109
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,520
you won't enjoy anything else

110
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,800
but love for other people, and not for yourself.

111
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,560
On the contrary you will see

112
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,240
that your body, your mind, your thoughts,

113
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,960
everything are directed towards creating love for others,

114
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,160
and not for yourself.

115
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,000
The whole attitude changes.

116
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,680
Like in the darkness you can't see anything,

117
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,560
but even there's a small light, it spreads all over.

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,920
Nobody tells the light that “You have to spread the light

119
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,360
all over,” but it does.

120
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,240
In the same way you all are enlightened people,

121
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,880
you are all enlightened with love;

122
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,960
and the light of this love spreads automatically,

123
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,200
spontaneously, sahaj.

124
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,200
I was also very much

125
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,880
enamored the way our Yuva Shakti was dancing and enjoying.

126
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,360
I think it's a very great blessing,

127
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,120
because these days our young children,

128
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,840
our young people are getting astray.

129
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,240
They are not so badly off as in other countries,

130
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
but quite a big trend is going on

131
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,720
to spoil them and to make them a, what you’d call

132
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,240
a very Westernized, spoiled personality.

133
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,480
But now I saw so many of these dancing together,

134
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,800
forgetting their caste, creed, everything,

135
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,800
and enjoying each other's company.

136
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,760
This is something has to happen

137
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,720
in this country and in every country,

138
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,320
that we should all feel oneness

139
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,080
and enjoy the oneness with each other.

140
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,240
If we do not enjoy we are like a drop outside the ocean,

141
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,520
which can be dried any time.

142
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,760
But if you are a part and a parcel of that ocean,

143
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,880
then what happens is that every movement of the ocean

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you carry with you,

145
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,040
and you are part and parcel of that ocean absolutely,

146
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,240
because you do not have separate identity.

147
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,400
All these things that make a separate identity

148
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,720
in our society or in our culture

149
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,600
or in our behavior, in personal lives,

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,880
all should be completely curbed down.

151
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,880
And this will settle many problems,

152
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,400
from family life to national life, to international life.

153
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,720
So we should curb down all such feelings

154
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
of separatedness,

155
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
that we should have a separate house,

156
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,480
separate state, separate nation.

157
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,120
Gradually all nations will become one, I am sure of that;

158
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,080
because great times are coming, and so many people

159
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,600
at the helm of affairs will take to Sahaja Yoga.

160
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,640
Once they take to Sahaja Yog,

161
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
then things will be very much different.

162
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,080
Today it is not with them,

163
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,720
Sahaja Yoga is not with them.

164
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,080
They have no knowledge of our great movement of love,

165
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,320
so they want to have separate of everything.

166
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,560
They don't know tomorrow they will be scorched away

167
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,600
with the heat around,

168
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,920
or maybe with the rain they’ll be washed away,

169
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,040
or maybe that the Mother Earth might absorb them.

170
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,720
So we all should be together,

171
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
whatever may be the differences.

172
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
In different families we are born

173
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,160
- after all, all cannot be born in one family.

174
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,320
But now you belong to Sahaja Yoga family,

175
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,480
and this Sahaja Yoga family is one.

176
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,720
It doesn't believe in having separate existence

177
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,640
or separate speciality.

178
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,880
We're all one with each other,

179
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,520
and we don't care what sort of differences are outside.

180
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,360
I was really very much touched,

181
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,960
because now the new year is coming

182
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,320
with a new challenge for all of us

183
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,800
which we have to accept,

184
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,560
that Kali Yuga is over

185
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,600
and we have to establish the Satya Yuga;

186
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,640
for which all of you from every country

187
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,760
should have thinking,

188
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,360
how you can do it in your country and in other country.

189
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,040
What are the problems in another country?

190
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,960
Put your attention outside,

191
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,320
not inside this way that you should say

192
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,840
that I need this, I need that, I need that.

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,800
We should know what other people need:

194
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,680
what is their need,

195
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,480
what the people in our society, in our nation,

196
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,120
in our world require?

197
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,640
Better write them down: what do they require?

198
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,480
It's better, it will work; might be,

199
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,120
it might be corrected.

200
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,240
It's very important for Sahaja yogis to sit down

201
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,320
and write down what the world needs,

202
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,600
and what is to be done.

203
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,120
It will be a nice idea for all of you

204
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,000
to really aspire for that kind of homogeneous society

205
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,200
that we have here today.

206
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,040
And we’ll be one day, you will be surprised

207
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,960
that we will be the ones who will guide

208
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,840
and lead the rest of the people with our love,

209
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,080
attention and care.

210
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,120
So it's very important time,

211
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,560
and at this time we should all think on those lines.

212
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,800
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
