1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:10,800
Today in the ashram I was telling you about 
our subtleties, the subtleties we have already

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,260
within us which we do not understand.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Could be from our sub-conscious mind, could 
be from our supra-conscious mind, could be

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,720
from anywhere that is unknown to us;

5
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:54,000
but the subtleties that lead us to our Universal 
Being is the one we should bother about.

6
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:02,000
We have sometimes heard about people who get 
a hunch.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,000
Like somebody says, “I must buy this house, 
I get a hunch that I should buy it."

8
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:19,000
Or sometimes people say that, “I always 
hear something, somebody tells me that this

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
should not be done."

10
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:40,020
But all such suggestions must be judged that 
they come to you to tell you about something

11
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:52,540
of the beyond or something that concerns the 
mundane life, like buying a house.

12
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,860
God is not interested, very much, in what 
house you buy, or how much money you make

13
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,480
in a race: He is not!

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,770
Because it is not important to God.

15
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,190
One can understand that, isn’t it.

16
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,450
Also that God is not interested in telling 
you against someone in the ear that, “Beware

17
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,620
of this man, he is a dangerous guy!”

18
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:28,829
For, if somebody is going to harm you physically, 
maybe to some part, we can say that God wants

19
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:37,139
to preserve your body; but this body is also 
not so important to God, because He can create

20
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,560
it again!

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:57,500
The most important thing that God has to give 
us is His love, His connection with us, His

22
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,970
Kingdom, His powers.

23
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:13,220
So, the subtleties which we should really 
accept within us, should be [those] which

24
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:22,799
take you to the realm of joy, to the realm 
of collectivity.

25
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:31,360
Like suddenly you see a little child weeping 
on the street and you feel [that] your heart

26
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
is weeping.

27
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:40,200
Not that you feel guilty about it but you 
feel one with the child and you feel you are

28
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:51,950
weeping: then definitely that subtlety of 
compassion that God is, is felt within you.

29
00:03:51,950 --> 00:04:01,919
But you don’t feel guilty about it, or you 
don’t give him 2p (£0.02) or something

30
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,989
to insult his ego.

31
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,909
You do something very constructive about it, 
extremely constructive, and you do it secretly;

32
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:14,450
you don’t like to tell anybody about it 
because you think it is vulgar to talk about

33
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,260
your compassion.

34
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,590
You do it so sweetly that the other fellow 
doesn’t feel it.

35
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:31,800
The whole act is such a beautifying thing.

36
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,590
You don’t announce it in the paper and you 
don’t publish it in “Who’s Who” or

37
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:44,860
you do not go for a Nobel Prize or something 
like that.

38
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,840
This is all very vulgar for the Subtle Thing 
that you worship within yourself, because

39
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:01,129
that element within you is so much higher 
than all these gross considerations that you

40
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,560
just care for that.

41
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,781
That is what God is.

42
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:12,400
That’s how God shines within us, even before 
our Realisation, before our connection with

43
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,720
God.

44
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:22,130
He shines in some people even before they 
have been Realised.

45
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:33,569
You see them, they are quiet people, they 
are not show-offs, but they are very sincere,

46
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,710
extremely kind-hearted.

47
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:46,379
Such people when they face Sahaja Yoga, immediately 
they get their vibrations.

48
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:53,770
They are not people who are worried about 
money, or they are worried about the gross

49
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:06,789
things of life, or achievements that are so 
stupid.

50
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:12,330
Such people may exist as very ordinary people; 
they need not be at the helm of affairs [and]

51
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,500
mostly they are not, because they are not 
ambitious.

52
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,820
They do not want much success in life.

53
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,229
They don’t see any point in being very successful.

54
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:28,050
They might be something very ordinary.

55
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,879
They might be doing something very important 
also.

56
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:43,740
But in their life, those who come in contact 
with them, remember that: “Yes!

57
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:51,420
There was a life or there is a life.

58
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,229
Definitely there is a spark."

59
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:04,020
Because such a person being so subtle does 
not assert.

60
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,520
Such a person cannot be very dominating, assertive, 
argumentative.

61
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:26,539
Such a person is quieter: his attention recedes 
from all quarrels and all squabbles of life.

62
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:35,160
But such a person has a great position in 
the domain of God.

63
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:51,210
That you have seen, how in Sahaja Yoga suddenly 
you find people manifesting their divinity.

64
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,349
Maybe such a person is too naïve for all 
practical purposes.

65
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:05,699
He might have been cheated, might have been 
misled by some horrible people who try to

66
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,990
exploit his seeking, but still it remains.

67
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:22,889
This element suddenly gets ignited in Sahaja 
Yoga and for such a person this is the most

68
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:32,740
important thing: is to feel that Being which 
always kept him away from all the rest of

69
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:44,190
the ideologies and ‘great’ things and 
have always given him strength and confidence

70
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,190
and joy.

71
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,190
He sees that clearly in Sahaj Yog.

72
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,070
He adheres to it.

73
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,839
And when he nourishes it, he’s amazed that 
he has found himself.

74
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,100
Then it becomes his life.

75
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:17,860
There are thousands and thousands of people 
everywhere.

76
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,300
I say ‘thousands’, I don’t say ‘millions’.

77
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,670
I am sorry, because they are not in millions.

78
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,380
I am sorry for that.

79
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,550
I wish they were.

80
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:40,420
They could be counted in thousands only: maybe 
twenty-one thousand, altogether, of that quality.

81
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,000
There won’t be millions.

82
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,160
But they will be making millions later on.

83
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,910
They have to be a few!

84
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:58,250
These are people of special calibre as I said.

85
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:05,360
But it is necessary that everybody must be 
given Self-realisation, every seed must be

86
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,350
germinated.

87
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:14,360
But how many would sprout into the trees and 
would render fruit is a different point altogether.

88
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,450
First and foremost thing is that, first let 
them all be germinated.

89
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,310
In due course, all those would come back.

90
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:40,579
But some would prosper into their complete 
manifestation, in their full bloom in a very

91
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:45,320
short time, and that’s what matters the 
most.

92
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,610
The Divine is not interested in useless people, 
It is interested in that special calibre.

93
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:58,250
As I have told you: such a person may not 
be at all rich, may be absolutely poor.

94
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,360
That doesn’t mean that rich cannot be so!

95
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,940
[They] can be very rich also.

96
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,199
The outward appearances and status and all 
these denominations do not matter at all.

97
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:17,800
I am talking of the spark inside.

98
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:30,790
They can be called as gentlemen, in simple 
words, or if she is [female], a lady .

99
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:38,339
A serene dignity manifests through their being.

100
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:43,140
Sometimes it happens with their lives, also, 
that they find it very difficult to keep to

101
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:50,810
the norms of the mad world, and they may be 
a little cynical sometimes, could be.

102
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:59,990
But cynicism is not that subtlety, but they 
may appear to people a little cynical.

103
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:09,449
But they have to be very delightful and extremely 
cheerful people.

104
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:16,880
They cannot be morose, sad, emitting unhappiness 
all around, and big bores with a B capital

105
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,320
and O capital, R and E, all capital.

106
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,750
That cannot be possible.

107
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:28,089
They are extremely enjoyable and magnetic 
and dynamic.

108
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:38,190
They are complete in themselves because they 
feel their subtlety, they live on that.

109
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:48,410
Still their seeking is there, and the meaning 
they try to find to their own being.

110
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:54,100
And they want to identify their subtlety with 
something that is universal.

111
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:04,320
In their expression in any field that they 
are, they appeal to the Universal Being within

112
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,790
every one of us.

113
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:18,910
Maybe, they may not get a Nobel Prize, but 
[they have] a personality that emits that

114
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,900
kind of congenial behaviour.

115
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:32,670
Now if somebody is a person who is absolutely 
satanic, he will abhor such a person, possibly.

116
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:41,360
But this does not concern to the subtler being 
because he is at a level which is not tarnished

117
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,300
by gross attacks.

118
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:56,279
That is what one has to recognise in oneself 
and one should feel very proud and fortunate

119
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,649
that that exists within us.

120
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:05,180
No more one has to feel lonely, because now 
we are so many of us, of the same creed and

121
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,500
the same type.

122
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:23,110
And so many of us who have found out what 
is the reason, what expresses it, what manifests

123
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:36,110
it within us, what are the Deities that govern 
this subtlety within us: what you may call

124
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,509
the archetype images; archetype images are 
there which are real, not imaginary, within

125
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:41,569
us.

126
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:49,000
And all these discoveries, then make you feel 
confident of all these vague subtleties you

127
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,510
have been enjoying so far.

128
00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:09,990
A long time back, I had given a simile like 
this: that a mother bird puts the little child,

129
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:20,519
or you can call, the baby bird, away from 
her.

130
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:27,780
And the baby bird feels the mother’s warmth, 
and she wants that.

131
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,290
And she is calling for the mother.

132
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,520
That calling itself is the last thing it knows 
of.

133
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,090
That’s the highest thing for the baby bird, 
nothing else matters.

134
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:47,389
You may give anything to the baby bird [but] 
it won’t be happy, it needs that.

135
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:53,000
It needs that warmth, that love.

136
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,320
And then it expresses itself by spreading 
its tiny little wings around and tries to

137
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,190
hop and to express it.

138
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:12,029
And then out of complete joy of its hopping, 
the mother bird herself comes down and engulfs

139
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:22,029
that child into the wings, giving all the 
warmth necessary.

140
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:31,480
It is that happening within us which takes 
place when the Kundalini rises.

141
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:46,700
The Kundalini is the part of that warmth within 
us, of that compassion.

142
00:16:46,700 --> 00:17:00,380
It’s a part of that beauty, it’s the part 
of that desire.

143
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,009
Desire…

144
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:04,230
What’s the matter?

145
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,439
The door is open or not.

146
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,400
Come in, come in!

147
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:34,010
They are waiting because they [don’t want 
to disturb].

148
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,010
What’s the matter?

149
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,010
Yogi: Sorry we’re late Shri Mataji.

150
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,010
Shri Mataji: No, it’s all right.

151
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,010
Come in!

152
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,140
So the desire of God is placed within us as 
Kundalini.

153
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:56,370
And when all the external desires dim out 
within us and the real desire to be one with

154
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:06,380
the Almighty remains, the Kundalini can rise 
spontaneously.

155
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:15,430
That has happened to few people, very few 
people: you can say like Buddha, Mahavira.

156
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:27,700
These people were human beings and they achieved 
godliness: not by forcing yourself to get

157
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:41,090
rid of your desires, but through wisdom, understanding 
that, “This is stupidity, this is foolishness.

158
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,390
Where am I going?”

159
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,760
Just the wisdom acting.

160
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:58,519
Not a rational understanding, but the being 
itself rejecting.

161
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:04,690
Such stages are achieved through one’s own 
evolutionary forces.

162
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:22,130
Also, there are so many other happenings, 
or the other supports, which bring forth this

163
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,240
kind of spontaneous rising of the Kundalini.

164
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,000
There is somebody who wants to come and see 
me because he said, “Mother you are an authority

165
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:46,120
on Kundalini and there are many books written 
about Kundalini, and I have to write a criticism:

166
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:54,740
that the Kundalini, when she rises, you start 
jumping and when she rises she gives you heat,

167
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:02,390
or you burn off yourself or you jump through 
the roof or something like that."

168
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:11,580
All sorts of horrifying things and nobody 
wants to listen to anything about Kundalini.

169
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,790
If you read those books, you’ll be really 
frightened.

170
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:20,429
I think it is absolutely satanic.

171
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:27,330
And he wants to know about the ‘authentic 
description’ of Kundalini.

172
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:42,290
And I told him that, “These books, all of 
them, should be thrown away into the sea!

173
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:50,870
Because they are written by people who have 
had no experience of Kundalini, of any kind."

174
00:20:50,870 --> 00:21:01,159
Because they were people who must have been 
doing some sort of an ‘adventure’ somewhere.

175
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:10,309
Like some people believe that even finding 
of God is another job: if you have no job,

176
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:15,950
better find God, at least He might help you 
to survive!

177
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:26,220
Some people do believe that instead of sitting 
idle, why not try to find God, would be a

178
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,710
good idea.

179
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:41,450
And when such a thing happens and they venture 
into the search of God then, first, they are

180
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:49,409
hit by The Guard of Holiness.

181
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:56,900
Because they are not entitled, they are not 
holy, they have no protocol about God Almighty,

182
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,110
they have no respect, they are just doing 
it because they are ego-oriented, they want

183
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:08,299
to have another ego-trip and they want to 
become ‘great explorers’ of Kundalini.

184
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:14,500
But you cannot do it.

185
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,850
You have to have proper protocol.

186
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:34,800
They lack all humility, all holiness, righteousness 
and all that is needed, to ask the help of

187
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,169
the Kundalini.

188
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:44,740
And they are hit by the first Deity, which 
sits in the triangular bone, which they can

189
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:51,090
also see sometimes — they have seen him, 
with a temper; in red colour, they call it

190
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,530
or maybe in orange colour.

191
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:10,380
Let him come, there’s somebody waiting there.

192
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:22,330
This Deity is a very powerful Deity, and it 
is the wisest Deity, because it is the Deity

193
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,240
which gives us wisdom.

194
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:34,771
You need not argue with the gentleman: It 
knows you out and out.

195
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:38,539
It knows every bit of you.

196
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:44,460
If you tell some story, It would say, “All 
right, I have heard all this story before,

197
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,929
now will you please keep to yourself!”

198
00:23:50,929 --> 00:24:00,700
It understands how genuine you are, how truthful 
you are.

199
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:08,820
And this Deity is the one which has given 
these bad experiences to these Kundalini seekers

200
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,950
and writers of Kundalini.

201
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:21,309
It’s a sad thing that a thief comes to the 
town and he’s caught up by the police, he’s

202
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:27,130
put in the jail, and when he goes back to 
the village, he tells them, “Oh God!

203
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,130
Terrible!

204
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,130
Never go to the city!

205
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,260
They catch hold of you, put you in the jail, 
don’t give you food to eat, and then you

206
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,590
cannot meet anyone for three years, and then 
they send you back!”

207
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,710
And [so] everybody is frightened of going 
to the city.

208
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,730
It is like that.

209
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:49,230
Or the thief who goes to the bank from the 
back door, or sometimes they dig a tunnel

210
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:54,220
or something like that: great people in this 
world, you know, they have time to do all

211
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:59,621
kinds of nonsensical things, to dig a tunnel 
to get some gold pieces, or something and

212
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:06,190
dig another tunnel to go to the jail directly.

213
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:21,919
So, these stupid people, when they try to 
do all these gross things, like going to a

214
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:29,100
bank through the back door and are caught 
up; if you go and ask them their experiences,

215
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,650
they say, “Oh horrible experience!

216
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,200
Never go near the bank!

217
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,260
You don’t put your money there, no, not 
at all!”

218
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,500
You ask them, “Why, what’s the matter?”

219
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,049
They say, “No they catch hold of you!

220
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:46,899
You know, terrible people in that bank!”

221
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:53,280
They could even go further with it to warn 
you.

222
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:01,850
If they are cunning, they may come by the 
front door and tell you, “Why go and put

223
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,130
money in the bank, you give it to me: I can 
look after it better.

224
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,280
It’s a better idea!

225
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:17,559
And if you want, I can you to twenty percent 
more than the bank does!”

226
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:25,039
And if you trust their cunning faces, you 
just hand over the money and you are lost

227
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,039
and the bank is lost to you.

228
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,039
And then you may say that, “What is this 
bank?”

229
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:38,440
In front of the bank there are people standing 
like this.

230
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,580
What are these religions after all?

231
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:48,669
What are these gurus in the name of God, standing 
in the front door, trying to rob others?

232
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:53,860
What sort of a God is this?

233
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,980
So you start blaming the bank for the thieves 
who have cheated you.

234
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,830
You must learn to separate both.

235
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:13,860
This discretion is important even when you 
try to know about Kundalini, that Kundalini

236
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:26,090
is the desire of God to bestow upon you His 
kingdom.

237
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,980
The prince has to become the king.

238
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:42,740
And such a beautiful desire cannot be gross, 
cannot be ugly, cannot be painful, cannot

239
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:51,110
be troublesome, cannot be hideous and heinous.

240
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:58,230
Once you understand this, then you will respect 
your Kundalini.

241
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,549
She is your Mother because She is going to 
give you your second birth.

242
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:14,480
And She has been with you for ages, in so 
many lives, just waiting for this great time

243
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,850
when She is going to give you your Realisation.

244
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:36,690
I am telling you this because I know how beautiful 
She is.

245
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:48,159
So many have really tortured Her, have frozen 
Her, made Her into a stone by cursing Her

246
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:59,500
but still She is breathing feebly, with the 
hope that a day may come when She may be able

247
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:07,370
to give you what She has been living for.

248
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,370
This is Kundalini.

249
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,740
This is Kundalini awakening.

250
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:19,769
We have to give up our gross understanding 
of Kundalini.

251
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:23,640
Like you would see in Sahaja Yoga when you 
will be coming, you have seen it all your

252
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,740
life — and you will see it more — that 
so many of them just come to me for getting

253
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,850
all right in health, only for that.

254
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,190
“I have got a back pain."

255
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,860
“I have got a stomach trouble."

256
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,610
“I have got arthritis,” or, “I have 
got diabetes."

257
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:49,570
There’s nothing that is not there, and “I 
am sure you will cure me!”

258
00:29:49,570 --> 00:30:01,760
It’s quite a queer situation!

259
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:14,730
Because the request that I should cure is 
all right, but what is the right for this

260
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,220
request?

261
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:25,720
Why do you want that Divine should cure you?

262
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,650
For what?

263
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:33,179
For what purpose?

264
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:42,779
If Divine has to only cure people, it would 
open lots of hospitals and get some Nobel

265
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,399
Prize or something.

266
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:58,360
But it is not the desire of Divine to go on 
curing people.

267
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,779
It would be stupid to just cure people who 
are good for nothing, useless, absolutely

268
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,230
useless, thoroughly wasted.

269
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,139
Why should it work [like this]?

270
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:09,600
It has intelligence.

271
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,240
It has wisdom.

272
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:21,490
Is it going to waste its energy on curing 
people who are good for nothing, useless?

273
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:30,380
Are you going to clean this lamp if you cannot 
put any light in it?

274
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:43,039
If you have no utility, in the Divine sense, 
why should Divine cure you?

275
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:49,080
So all those who believe, “Oh Mother, you 
must cure people,” and that you should cure

276
00:31:49,080 --> 00:32:00,000
people, must know that all this is the work 
of Kundalini when She rises: She nourishes

277
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:17,310
you, She cleanses you, because in this being 
of yours, God Himself is going to manifest,

278
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:27,269
because this temple of your body is to be 
cleansed, because God has to enter into it.

279
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:37,440
That’s why the Divine respects and cleanses 
you and helps you.

280
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:45,000
Even it may help yours, means say a mother 
is there and her child is not all right, she’s

281
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,120
worried, so the Divine may cure the child, 
just to give peace to the mother who is going

282
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,590
to manifest God’s powers.

283
00:32:53,590 --> 00:33:03,230
Because God’s power is the integrated power 
of all the powers.

284
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:17,460
You can see here, on the left hand side: all 
the desires are manifested; the power of desire.

285
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:26,720
That means all the desires you have can be 
fulfilled and blessed by this power.

286
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,919
Can you believe it?

287
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:42,510
It has the power to fulfil all your desires, 
but after Realisation, not before that.

288
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:50,330
And after Realisation, your priorities change 
and your desires become different.

289
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:59,990
Then you do not ask for money or for children, 
or something like that but you start asking

290
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,779
for something of a very eternal nature.

291
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,500
The priorities change.

292
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,180
You start seeing your desire in a different 
aspect because light has come now.

293
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:18,390
For example, in the darkness when you are 
walking, you find that there’s a big black

294
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,350
bang in front of you, you can’t walk, so 
you desire, “Oh this bang should be removed!”

295
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,900
But when the light comes in you find there’s 
no bang, nothing!

296
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,420
It’s all open for you.

297
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,420
So your desire is that you should be able 
to see everything.

298
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,460
The whole priority changes.

299
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:46,370
So this Left Side has the power to fulfil 
all your desires.

300
00:34:46,370 --> 00:35:01,340
And the Right Side, where you see this yellow 
line, which looks so slender, has the power

301
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:14,490
to act, to fulfil all your desires and the 
desires of God.

302
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:25,320
Here I take you a little subtler: What are 
these acting powers?

303
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,990
Tremendous!

304
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:35,670
For example, this side is manifesting all 
the five elements.

305
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:40,990
All the five elements await your asking.

306
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,950
You see this fire?

307
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,190
You ask this fire, “Take away my problem!”

308
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,570
It takes away.

309
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,700
You have seen it.

310
00:35:51,700 --> 00:36:00,420
Water element: you go to the sea, and just 
go and stand in the sea, after Realisation.

311
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,800
You find the whole thing is sucked in.

312
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,650
The Mother Earth sucks all your problems.

313
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,860
It’s so fantastic.

314
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,570
I was in Kuala Lumpur, you may write to him 
and find out.

315
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:15,990
He was the speaker of the assembly: [I was] 
at his residence, and there were at least

316
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,480
thousand people.

317
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,640
And sixty percent were sick, and forty were 
attending to them.

318
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,840
I was alone: no Sahaja Yogi, nothing.

319
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,764
Luckily, they had a big garden and it was 
quite warm day.

320
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:30,610
I said, “All right, let’s go in the garden!”

321
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:35,960
I made them sit in the garden and I asked 
the Mother Earth: I said, “You better now

322
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,960
do the job!

323
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,740
And I am sitting down."

324
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,690
And everybody started feeling better.

325
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:57,220
One thing I had never before seen being cured 
was this polio.

326
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,150
And a little boy, about eight years of age 
was sitting on the ground: his parents had

327
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,430
brought him on their back and put him down 
there.

328
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,970
He just got up and started walking!

329
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,580
And the parents suddenly realised he’s missing: 
“Where is he gone?”

330
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,580
And he was running in the garden!

331
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,040
It’s a fact!

332
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,480
Some blind started seeing things.

333
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,940
It’s most remarkable.

334
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,480
You may write to him, I will give you his 
address.

335
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
It’s a fact, it happened.

336
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,860
And for everyone the whole miracle was so 
simple that they took it for granted; they

337
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:34,470
didn’t find that there was anything so fantastic: 
“After all Mother is here, so it has to

338
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,710
work out!”

339
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,771
They did not rationalise it or anything — took 
it for granted.

340
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:52,180
And even today, if I go there, this may happen.

341
00:37:52,180 --> 00:38:03,910
All the elements are waiting for your orders.

342
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:12,940
So the great angels on the left hand side 
communicate to the right hand side angels:

343
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,990
all the angels of the world.

344
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:20,540
Though it may sound fantastic to many, but 
they exist, and you have to just ask their

345
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
help.

346
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:31,580
That is what is a mantra: is the awakened 
calling, or you can say, calling which has

347
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,580
meaning.

348
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:38,280
For example: a policeman blows his whistle, 
it has a meaning, but anybody else starts

349
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,700
whistling, people will put him in the jail.

350
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:56,360
In the same way, the mantra is the authority 
which is applied with the word.

351
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:02,970
And with this you can awaken all these forces 
within you.

352
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:08,940
They are so tremendous that I’ll take at 
least seven lectures to describe [and] which

353
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:16,390
I will describe some time; of which you are 
aware already, most of you: how they work

354
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,220
and how they help you.

355
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:30,210
Even we take them for granted, Sahaja Yogis, 
because if you notice in life, has one great

356
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:39,910
mystery, I don’t know if you are aware of 
that mystery: that whatever fantastic we get,

357
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:48,340
somehow or other, we get it in such a way 
that we take it for granted.

358
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,920
It’s very sweet, isn’t it?

359
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,280
Supposing every time we get a shock or we 
get frightened, and we say, “Oh God!”

360
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,570
We would become neurotic, or funny people.

361
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:10,280
But the way it settles down within us like 
a leaf falling from the tree and drying out

362
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,970
and just touches the ground softly, and the 
ground also takes it for granted.

363
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,620
In the same way, all this we take for granted.

364
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:24,290
For example, our eyes, our nose, our forehead, 
everything we take for granted, our human

365
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:29,080
bearing, everything we take it for granted, 
in the same way take even Sahaj Yog for granted:

366
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,880
and that’s the best way.

367
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:42,650
But do we take it for granted, the way we 
take our being for granted?

368
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,610
Is the question.

369
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:52,050
For example, we take it for granted our hand: 
so if I have to lift my purse, I lift my hand,

370
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,050
like this.

371
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:59,300
When we take Sahaja Yoga for granted, do we 
use our vibrations for everything?

372
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:05,810
Because now in our vibratory awareness, if 
we have taken it for granted, we should completely

373
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,010
stand in it and work it out.

374
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,190
I mean, I do that way.

375
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,500
To me everything is nothing but vibrations.

376
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,060
Everything I do is nothing but vibrations.

377
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:23,300
All my movements and everything is nothing 
but vibrations.

378
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,040
I take for granted Myself very well.

379
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:34,310
I wish you could take for granted all that 
is within you, the way we take [other things]

380
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,330
for granted.

381
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:41,280
Say, I give you a television and you just 
take it and you put it to the mains and you

382
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,400
see the thing.

383
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:50,230
You do not jump and say, “Oh God, look at 
the miracle!

384
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,230
Imagine!”

385
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,450
Nothing, you just take it for granted.

386
00:41:53,450 --> 00:42:00,520
Anything: computer or any marvellous thing 
that you see — you take it for granted.

387
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:11,690
In the same way, maybe in the beginning one 
feels, “How is it possible?”

388
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,670
One may start thinking like that for a while.

389
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:22,390
Too much thinking is also not good, because 
then you are not take it for granted.

390
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:28,120
But afterwards, you must use it left and right!

391
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,780
Just try!

392
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,190
You are empowered.

393
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,040
Now your television is open.

394
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,330
It has started working.

395
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:47,000
You are a great instrument and created [over] 
thousands of years with such care.

396
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:55,260
You do not know what forces have been used: 
how delicately and how dynamically.

397
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:04,310
You have no idea as to how all the stars and 
all the heavens are moved up and down to create

398
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,640
this beautiful being that is the human personality.

399
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:13,080
You have no idea of that.

400
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,800
And now, when Sahaj Yoga takes place, also 
you must know that Sahaj Yoga’s working

401
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,530
has been worked out in the very dynamic manner.

402
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:30,100
There are tremendous subtle forces which are 
working it out.

403
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:36,700
You cannot make your Kundalini pulsate without 
something special happening there.

404
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,410
Just think of a remote control that works 
out your Kundalini!

405
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,330
Just think of it!

406
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:56,190
There must be a tremendous mechanism!

407
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:02,930
Why I say, take it for granted [is] because 
if you try first to open all your remote controls

408
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:14,090
and see for yourself and then breaking all 
of them, you start starting your television,

409
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:18,170
you will find the whole thing is finished 
and you have a headache, and you don’t want

410
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,420
to see anything.

411
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,870
That’s what happens to Sahaj Yogis, specially 
in the West, because as soon as they get their

412
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:31,410
Realisation they go home and make a nice dissection 
by thinking about it.

413
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,330
They didn’t get Realisation by thinking!

414
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,930
It’s a simple thing!

415
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,300
And then they go back.

416
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,210
And then after seven months they come back 
and say, “Mother I have been to you seven

417
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:49,220
months back, now I think I was wrong."

418
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:55,630
So I say: why lose those seven months?

419
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:07,170
Today I hope you all will feel our subtleties 
flowering.

420
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:18,410
Let us take ourselves down to those subtle 
points which we respected and the Kundalini

421
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,900
will nourish it — the attention.

422
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:29,220
Wherever your attention goes now, this attention 
is enlightened attention.

423
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,900
Today I received a letter from Australia, 
somebody has written, “Mother, we had sent

424
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:43,300
you a picture of someone, husband and wife, 
and they are better since you gave them bandhan."

425
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,370
And they were very serious patients.

426
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,450
And they are really better.

427
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,920
But I did nothing!

428
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,000
Really I don’t do anything.

429
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,740
I just looked at the photograph, that’s 
all.

430
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,660
I didn’t even give bandhan, you know, to 
be very frank.

431
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,660
I just looked at it, that’s all.

432
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:09,151
I didn’t think, I just looked at it, and 
it worked.

433
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,151
Really I don’t do anything!

434
00:46:10,151 --> 00:46:11,151
You people thank me for nothing at all, you 
know.

435
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:14,650
When you don’t do anything and people thank 
you, you don’t know what to say so you go

436
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,430
on saying, “All right, thank you for thanking!” 
(laughing)

437
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:26,630
So again, thank you for being here.

438
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,020
And we’ll have some meditation.

439
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,790
I hope we’ll touch some deeper stratas within 
yourselves.

440
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,110
May God bless you all!

441
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:44,890
You have come for the first time both of you?

442
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,580
You have been once before?

443
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,830
What about you?

444
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,950
Lady: It’s my first time.

445
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,450
Shri Mataji: First time?

446
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:54,450
Good.

447
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,450
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

448
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,450
Seeker: Yes.

449
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,450
Shri Mataji: All right, so you haven’t lost 
it!

450
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,550
And what about you, are you feeling the cool 
breeze in the hand?

451
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,550
Seeker: No

452
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,700
Shri Mataji: Not yet?

453
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,751
All right, it will work out, it will work 
out.

454
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:04,751
What about you?

455
00:47:04,751 --> 00:47:08,060
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

456
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,370
No?

457
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:11,550
How are you?

458
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,970
Yogi: Feeling the cool breeze Mother.

459
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:19,460
Shri Mataji: Well good!

460
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,460
Good!

461
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,460
Good!

462
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,820
Are you all right?

463
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,860
Good.What about you?

464
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,580
Lady: I don’t feel today.

465
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,310
Shri Mataji: You are thinking!

466
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,340
Now, please!

467
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,340
Please!

468
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,430
You see, thinking stops it.

469
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:32,430
How?

470
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:35,210
Between the two thoughts — for example, 
a thought rises and falls off, and another

471
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:42,990
thought rises and falls off — between these 
two thoughts there is a little gap, that gap

472
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:43,990
has expanded.

473
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:49,720
For example, the thought that was, is the 
past and that is going to come is the future.

474
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,300
In between is the space called as vilamba.

475
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:59,160
And when you start thinking about it you jump 
onto the cusp of these thoughts.

476
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,190
You are beyond thought.

477
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:12,190
An Indian will understand it faster, because 
it’s called as Nirvichar Samadhi: is the

478
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,290
state where you become thoughtlessly aware.

479
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:16,330
They know that that’s what it is.

480
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,140
You cannot think about it, because rationality 
is a limited thing.

481
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:23,720
So you have to jump into the space.

482
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:30,980
When you are in the space then you are not 
in the capsule.

483
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:36,900
But if you are in the capsule you are not 
in the space.

484
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,250
Better now?

485
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,590
Lady: Yes.

486
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:50,060
Shri Mataji: See how it works.

487
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,780
Even your problems, I mean, I have given big 
lectures on this, how to solve your problems,

488
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,280
in your thoughtless awareness.

489
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:04,880
That’s the mouth, that’s the mouth where 
you have to put the problem in, and it works

490
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,700
in your thoughtless awareness.

491
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:13,410
It’s the most precious thing, is to keep 
it up.

492
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:19,980
Are you getting now cool breeze?

493
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,080
Correct.

494
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,280
What about you, not yet?

495
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
Now watch me here.

496
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,720
Are you thinking still?

497
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,210
All right, you watch me without thinking.

498
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,300
That’s another way you can do it.

499
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:35,210
My face is such a funny thing that if you 
watch it for a long time, you will have no

500
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:36,530
thoughts!

501
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,460
Just it is something very funny you know!

502
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,620
Today it happened: I went to the tailor and 
he just looked at me and he didn’t know

503
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,070
what he was trying to do.

504
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:53,620
And my husband said, “Is he stunned or what 
happened?”

505
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,620
(laughter)

506
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,960
Now watch me without thinking!

507
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,210
Better!

508
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,460
See!

509
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:07,820
This is the face!

510
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,020
This is needed.

511
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,100
What am I to do?

512
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,900
I mean, this is the problem with me.

513
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,470
I don’t know how to explain myself!

514
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:22,020
Aap ka aa rahe thanda?

515
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,040
Thik hai.

516
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,320
(Hindi: Are you getting cool?

517
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,320
Good!)

518
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
How are you now?

519
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,320
Better?

520
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,980
Everyday you will be better and better and 
better.

521
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,420
How are you?

522
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,810
Lady: A bit better.

523
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,840
Not so good as yesterday.

524
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,600
I felt a lot of cool breeze yesterday but 
not so much today.

525
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,140
Shri Mataji: So, that means you are going 
down a little.

526
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,140
All right?

527
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,870
So now keep it up.

528
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:57,220
You see, it is like a washing machine, I can 
say.

529
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,420
It goes round and round, a little bit, for 
cleansing.

530
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,780
All right?

531
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,780
They call it Mahamaya.

532
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,760
They call it “The Great Illusion”.

533
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,030
Mother is a great illusion, because She puts 
us into illusion.

534
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,120
I do not!

535
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,480
We tell God, “Lead us not into temptation."

536
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,690
Now why will He take you to temptation?

537
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:18,480
But you do go.

538
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,740
So you tell God that, “You keep us away 
from that!”

539
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,960
That’s all you tell God: that, “You keep 
us away from thinking!”

540
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:37,970
And it works.

541
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:43,930
Better?

542
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,000
Your face looks different immediately.

543
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,020
Keep it up!

544
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,050
Now all right.

545
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:56,080
Good, once it clicks!

546
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,760
But you must come every Monday.

547
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,910
See how people have gone up!

548
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,880
How many people they are giving Realisation?

549
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,560
All right?

550
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:10,130
You must come, this is the most pleasurable 
thing!

551
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,130
You don’t know.

552
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,840
It is little bit you have to develop the taste.

553
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,340
Because you are used to the gross stuff, you 
see.

554
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,790
Like somebody who is used to wines cannot 
give up.

555
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:26,680
But once the wine from within starts pouring 
in, you just don’t want it!

556
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,680
Better.

557
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,370
Somebody has come I believe.

558
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,370
Hmmm!

559
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,500
He’s better now.

560
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,070
All right?

561
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,420
What’s happened Gavin?

562
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:56,560
I

563
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,560
see that so clear!

564
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Why?

565
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,560
You’ve been having a holiday or what?

566
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,980
It’s horrible, absolutely!

567
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,610
Very badly caught up!

568
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,430
What’s the matter?

569
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:10,360
You had a bad cold?

570
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,130
Come here!

571
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:18,310
I have never seen you being caught that much.

572
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:35,100
You had exposed yourself I think [it was] 
the sunning or what happened?

573
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:42,300
Terrible!

574
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:49,510
Better?

575
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,510
Be careful!

576
00:53:50,510 --> 00:54:00,370
You see, these days it’s very sunny, looks 
sunny, but maybe…You have to look after

577
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,810
yourself.

578
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:19,870
This country is full of this problem.

579
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:24,750
Now better.

580
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:29,630
What’s it?

581
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,060
Vishuddhi.

582
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:42,470
It rises from Vishuddhi to this.

583
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:43,470
Haa!

584
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,470
Better now.

585
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:51,440
You sit or a while and it will work out in 
the…You see it rises from the Vishuddhi

586
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,440
to the.

587
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,820
I think you caught cold very badly.

588
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,950
What happened?

589
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:05,270
Gavin Brown: I don’t know.

590
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:14,970
Shri Mataji: I think you put your hand here.

591
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,690
Sit down!

592
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,690
Be careful.

593
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,690
Hmm!

594
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,690
Better.

595
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,690
Somebody with cold must have come or something 
you see, or the hay fever is there.

596
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,330
Gavin Brown: Might be that.

597
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:30,110
Shri Mataji: From Right Nabhi: it’s on the 
right hand side the problem is.

598
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:34,680
How are you?

599
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,030
Good!

600
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:58,180
Now close your eyes, close.

601
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:10,270
You put your hand here, the right, and the 
left there to work out the Vishuddhi.

602
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,910
Right Nabhi also.

603
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:16,860
Is it your liver coming up or what?

604
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:23,860
Gavin Brown: I don’t think so.

605
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:30,850
Shri Mataji: Quite a lot eh?

606
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,350
Gavin Brown: Hmm.

607
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:44,420
Shri Mataji: All right, move from the left 
more, from the left.

608
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:51,000
Keep your eyes shut and enjoy your Self, enjoy 
your Self.

609
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,650
Just don’t think.

610
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,760
Just don’t think.

611
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:02,220
Just enjoy your Self.

612
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:07,100
Don’t think.

613
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:11,990
Don’t think.

614
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,430
Hmm!

615
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,870
Better.

616
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:26,640
Where is it Mark?

617
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,520
Whole Left?

618
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,400
Better now?

619
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,840
Improving?

620
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,290
Heart?

621
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,730
Better.

622
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:53,490
Keep your eyes shut!

623
00:57:53,490 --> 00:58:00,820
Enjoy your Self.

624
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:07,460
You are all going down into your Self.

625
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,810
Just allow it.

626
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:10,700
Relax, relax.

627
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,580
Just relax.

628
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,470
Don’t think about anything just relax.

629
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:20,270
You are working it out.

630
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:34,160
Now just relax.

631
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:59,380
Don’t think.

632
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:24,600
Better now.

633
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:37,210
Tremendous!

634
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:49,820
Haa?

635
00:59:49,820 --> 01:00:15,040
Giving out.

636
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:27,650
Better.

637
01:00:27,650 --> 01:01:05,480
Now, better now?

638
01:01:05,480 --> 01:02:21,790
Now are

639
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:23,180
you feeling?

640
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,350
Better?

641
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:26,680
Losing again?

642
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,090
You are losing again?

643
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:31,030
What?

644
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:35,940
Come up, come here.

645
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:37,700
Sit down.

646
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,470
Sit down.

647
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:51,820
See your liver comes back again: still treating 
your liver patients there is it?

648
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,090
Come forward, come forward.

649
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:55,270
I’ll have to put my foot on your liver.

650
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:57,210
Now just see how stone-like it has become.

651
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:03,840
See now, what else do you expect but heat?

652
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:08,420
See?

653
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:26,760
That’s what it is.

654
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:35,930
Now better?

655
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:49,990
Somebody’s catching on the Back Agnya.

656
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:50,990
Hmm!

657
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:51,990
Gavin Brown: It’s moving.

658
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,990
It’s moving now.

659
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:53,990
Shri Mataji: Better?

660
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,990
Much better now.

661
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:55,990
Sorry I have to use my feet but they are very 
powerful you know.

662
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:59,040
For physical problems they are better than 
my hands are.

663
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:11,470
Poor things, they go on working morning till 
evening!

664
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:26,960
Press it hard!

665
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,120
Better!

666
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:55,890
Still you are working with the liver patients 
are they?

667
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,700
Doctor: Hmm.

668
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,340
Shri Mataji: What do you do about them?

669
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:06,100
What treatments do you give for liver patients 
in the hospitals?

670
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,070
Doctor: Special drugs.

671
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,620
Shri Mataji: What drugs?

672
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,700
Doctor: Depends what the problem is with the 
liver.

673
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:29,250
Shri Mataji: But still what drugs normally 
you use?

674
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:35,860
Doctor: The main things they use are for someone 
who is alcoholic and they start to bleed.

675
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,020
Shri Mataji: Alcohol?

676
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:41,680
Doctor: They have alcoholic cirrhosis and 
they bleed and they vomit blood.

677
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,850
Shri Mataji: Really?

678
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:43,850
That serious?

679
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:47,510
Doctor: So we have special drugs to help stop 
that.

680
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,840
Shri Mataji: Just look at this!

681
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,810
Despite that, nobody publishes these things.

682
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:58,840
You know, the other day in a very so-called 
important dinner table, there was a big argument

683
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:07,240
[that] was on that, in France, the pubs are 
open all the time, while here they open very

684
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:12,150
late, so people are very unhappy that you 
are not sufficiently alcoholic!

685
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:14,970
A big discussion is on.

686
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,570
Let them see these photographs!

687
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:23,430
Why not show them how people vomit blood and 
how people do these things.

688
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:29,109
It would be a good idea.

689
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:30,109
And the food they eat do they?

690
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:36,090
Doctor: Well, there’s so many different 
problems we have with the liver.

691
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:42,037
Say, they are alcoholic then they have intravenous 
therapy.

692
01:06:42,037 --> 01:06:43,037
Shri Mataji: They cannot eat the food?

693
01:06:43,037 --> 01:06:44,037
They vomit?

694
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:45,037
Doctor: So they put special tubes down them 
to stop them vomiting, and then they give

695
01:06:45,037 --> 01:06:45,537
them blood because they are losing so much.
