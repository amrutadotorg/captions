1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,114
So one has to understand that today's message

2
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:19,682
is that we inculcate purity.

3
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:24,120
We should not cheat ourselves. It is easy to cheat

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,815
but we should inculcate purity

5
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:34,952
within ourselves as a matter of our own maturity,

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,120
as our own decoration, as our own beauty

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,156
and not just because it's a laborious thing

8
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:50,364
or it is a very hard thing, not like that.

9
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:55,240
It should be achieved with great pleasure and happiness.

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,004
How do we like to have a bath or to be clean

11
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:01,320
and to be presentable?

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,360
In the same way we should try to clean our thoughts.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,560
Just by paying attention to them, we can clean them.

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,240
Thoughts must be made clean.

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,160
First of all why have thoughts at all.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,080
But even if you have, have clean and pure thoughts.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,400
Even if you have to have, don't have thoughts

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,880
full of arrogance, aggression or of fear.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,426
Some people think that if you have thoughts of fear

20
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:34,120
it's a very good thing: "Oh I'm frightened, I am afraid."

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,440
It's impurity. Why should you be afraid?

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
That means your left Vishuddhi is catching.

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,920
There's no need to have any fear of any kind;

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,607
no need to have any fear of any kind.

25
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:53,160
If you have to have fear that means there's something wrong.

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,080
If you believe that God is above all,

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,080
you are a realized soul and that

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,920
God is going to look after you,

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,000
that He is your father,

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,440
that He's open His gates to you,

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,600
what is there to be afraid of?

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,080
Many people think that way that if you have the fears,

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,676
you are humble. Humility is different

34
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:17,960
from a frightened person.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
It's absolutely a [INAUDIBLE] it has nothing to do with humility.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,480
So to be humble is different

37
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:29,440
and to be frightened is different.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,080
For Sahaja Yogis it is very easy to find out

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,960
through their vibratory awareness

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,160
what is fear and what is humility.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
As humility will give you vibrations

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,560
and fear will catch all your left side.

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,360
So our purification of our mind comes

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,560
through certain methods of understanding ourselves.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,120
First of the understandings one has to have

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,960
is that we are born in a family, born in a society,

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,360
born in a so-called religious sect or what.

48
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,560
So all these fixations

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,520
have put into us certain amount of impurities.

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,153
Which may give us ego, superego, anything it might give us.

51
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:46,273
So to keep it pure and simple is:

52
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:50,696
take to water element as much as you can.

53
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:54,804
It helps both ways, it helps ego, it helps superego.

54
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:56,480
Take to water element.

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,480
And that is what Lakshmi is.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,960
Lakshmi is the one that gives you the Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,120
From the Lakshmi only the Mahalakshmi's principle comes in.

58
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,080
And this is after the purification

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,840
through the Lakshmi process.

60
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
Christ has said,

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,760
"If you want I can give you gold, gold parts,

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,520
you can live with it.

63
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,280
But those who love Me will only enter

64
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,400
into the Kingdom of God. And I will eat with them,"

65
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,960
means those who are pure only I will eat with them.

66
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,640
I will not eat with people, who are impure.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,520
He was so, I mean, every,

68
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,720
all the incarnations are aware of it,

69
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,880
that they have to be with the pure people

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
and they have to help the pure people.

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,000
But He so clearly said it that if you want Lakshmi,

72
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,080
you can have it, that's money.

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,400
But that's not Mahalakshmi,

74
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,720
so from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi state.

75
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,440
You've already got your realization,

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,840
you do not know how much you have got it already.

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,200
You are already having the Mahalakshmi principle within you.

78
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,600
And what is the Mahalakshmi principle?

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,400
That's the point. Can I ask this question?

80
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,000
What is the Mahalakshmi principle within you?

81
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,160
Yogi: It's all for the Spirit.

82
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,200
Shri Mataji: No, no. But you have a power.

83
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,520
You have got MahaLakshmi's powers within you, do you know that?

84
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,840
Yogi: The pleasure it gives you.

85
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,440
Shri Mataji: The pleasure? No, no, no.

86
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,120
Yogi: The power of giving realization.

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,080
Shri Mataji: Go ahead still, little more, more.

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,800
Pleasure is not a power.

89
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,200
Pleasure is what you enjoy.

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,200
But you have a power of Mahalakshmi.

91
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Yogi: Sustaining power.

92
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,800
Shri Mataji: That's no power.

93
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,360
Power means, you have that power to do something.

94
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,760
Yogi: The power to spread Sahaja yoga.

95
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
Shri Mataji: That's rather vague, particular one.

96
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,400
Yogi: Power to give realization.

97
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,760
Yogi: To evolve.

98
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,320
Shri Mataji: But to evolve is your own.

99
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,240
Power is what you do to others.

100
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,080
The whole thing I told you just now.

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,000
Is to purify.

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,760
You have the power to purify.

103
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,840
How do you cure people?

104
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,640
By purifying them.

105
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,360
All right?

106
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,640
Now just think how you purify others,

107
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,880
by talking to others you can purify them.

108
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,840
By touching others, you can purify them.

109
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,960
By looking at them, you can purify them.

110
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,040
One person who is a realized soul, purifies the whole atmosphere.

111
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,880
The atmosphere is purified.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,680
Since I've come, it has been warm enough.

113
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,160
You purify everything.

114
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,840
You purify this light, do you notice that?

115
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,200
You've awakened the light.

116
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,800
Now what other powers you have?

117
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,840
Yogi: To raise the Kundalini.

118
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,040
Shri Mataji: That's awakening.

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
See Kundalini is many powers, is many-folded.

120
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:32,560
You purify yourselves, others and yourselves.

121
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,400
Some more powers are there. Now come along, let's have it.

122
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,360
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them

123
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,680
this is the best part of it.

124
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,880
You can't follow it. Now let's have it.

125
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:57,840
Yogi: Power over time. Arranging time to suit yourselves.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Shri Mataji: That's not a power of Mahalakshmi.

127
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,320
That's another one I'll tell you who does that.

128
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:20,240
Yogi: Balance. It gives balance between ego and superego?

129
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,840
Shri Mataji: That's true. That is one of them.

130
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,240
But that is guru power. That is the guru's power.

131
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,480
Balance comes from guru.

132
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,280
See Mahalakshmi is water, so now you tell Me.

133
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,080
Yogi: To cleanse

134
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Shri Mataji: That's done now, the cleansing is done.

135
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,240
Water is water.

136
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,072
Yogi: Satisfied.

137
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:51,512
Shri Mataji: Now coming to the part.

138
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,520
It quenches the thirst, the spiritual thirst.

139
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,280
You can quench the spiritual thirst of people, tremendous power,

140
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,120
because when you give realization

141
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,920
that the seeking is over. All right?

142
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,640
Then another one now come along.

143
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,080
What other qualities?

144
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:18,894
Think of the water,

145
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,120
nourishment, you nourish.

146
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
You give spiritual nourishment to people

147
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,680
through your power; even if you are standing there

148
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,840
you are nourishing others.

149
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,480
Then it is a solvent,

150
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,272
you dissolve their ego and you dissolve their super ego.

151
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:48,832
All these powers are you own after realization.

152
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,608
Just think of it. What else?

153
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:58,640
Yogi: Divinity.

154
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,896
Shri Mataji: That's very vague

155
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:05,200
because divinity is, how to relate it to water?

156
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,800
People won't understand it,

157
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,160
so let us put it other way round. What is it?

158
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,000
Yogi: cool down.

159
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,320
Shri Mataji: You become a cool down person.

160
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:26,920
Very good, very good.

161
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,320
You become cool, cool personality.

162
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,840
You have a cooling effect, what else?

163
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,520
Yogi: You carry others. You can carry others.

164
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,840
Shri Mataji: You can, very gentle

165
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,800
and also drown some of them.

166
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,000
Drown into the love, into the ocean of love, all right.

167
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,520
But you can also push them

168
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,040
with two running jumps, all right.

169
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,480
That also can be done.

170
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,200
It has another very great quality that water permeates

171
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,040
into the smallest particle.

172
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,600
It goes the roots,

173
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,960
I mean suck into the roots.

174
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,120
So Mahalakshmi power you just see the roots of the person.

175
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,800
You just know where the problem comes from,

176
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,320
just, actually it is the awareness,

177
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
it is the intelligence,

178
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,480
suck the truth part of it which gets enlightened.

179
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,400
And you understand that now where is the problem,

180
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,760
you just go near the root

181
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,280
and you suck and you can be easily sucked,

182
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,360
you permeate.

183
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,640
You see, when you are sitting near a person

184
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,000
then you tell Me, "Mother, this is catching at the back,

185
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,520
the person doesn't know." You have permeated.

186
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,440
Your personality has permeated into that person. He doesn't know.

187
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
You have permeated into that person

188
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,240
and you are feeling the roots, where is the problem.

189
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,840
The water is flowing into that being.

190
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,920
The divine water is flowing into that being

191
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,120
and the obstruction is felt

192
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,880
through that divine water

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,800
and you can say that this is catching that is catching.

194
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,040
So permeate, permeating

195
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,600
and the another one is the glistening

196
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,360
of the water is so your glistening

197
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,880
your skin becomes very radiant.

198
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,600
And the last of all is the reflection.

199
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,760
A person, who sees you,

200
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,240
sees his own reflection.

201
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,040
He gets frightened.

202
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,400
This happens sometimes.

203
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't mean anything bad to anyone

204
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,960
but people are unnecessarily frightened of Me

205
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,040
because they see their reflection.

206
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,120
So when they reach you they see their reflection

207
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,640
They can be very aggressive because they see their reflection.

208
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,880
They can be very hard on you

209
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,960
because they see their reflection

210
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,200
and if it is clear-cut water,

211
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,040
then you see the depth of that person.

212
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,040
If you are clear-cut sahaja yogi

213
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,800
you feel the depth clearly

214
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,040
and they can see through - the spirit shines.

215
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,080
These are the qualities of water.

216
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
If it is enough,

217
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,880
more of that I would say specially in My body

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,480
the water I have as buffer

219
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,440
because it protect the charkas.

220
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,640
If I don't have water in the body I may have problems.

221
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,600
So it acts as buffer

222
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,560
also it soothes your epithelial cells;

223
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,400
you can say it soothes your blindness.

224
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,320
You see, if you don't have moisture

225
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,080
its all being blindness/dryness in all.

226
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,960
It soothes everyone

227
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,960
and there are other types of powers of water,

228
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
which we know about

229
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,400
when it comes out of your eyes

230
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,080
it expresses your compassion,

231
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,080
your love, your emotions.

232
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,280
That is the only thing

233
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,440
out of all the elements

234
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,600
which expresses emotions,

235
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,000
Water power.

236
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,960
Water has other qualities also

237
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,720
which many people know hydrostatics water,

238
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,760
the pressure. It has a pressure

239
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,960
and a person who exists like a Sahaja yogi

240
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,440
will definitely put a pressure on others.

241
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,520
He will not, he will not aggress

242
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,000
but there will be a pressure and pressure.

243
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
And another person if he receives one

244
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,320
then he will gets the advantage of you,

245
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,160
but if he doesn't want to receive it

246
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,520
then he feel pressurized and feels little bit dominated.

247
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,840
Your neighbors, your family people at the beginning

248
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,720
they feel a pressure because

249
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,400
the body achieves a kind of a weight

250
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,960
and that's how the Guru Tattwa is formed out of you.

251
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,760
And if there is fault in Guru Principle

252
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,800
then the weight is even more.

253
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,520
So today for water should really

254
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,200
know that the water is a very holy thing

255
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,360
and in our pujas also we use

256
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,200
especially this signifies the Kundalini

257
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,240
that means the Kundalini is the water jar

258
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,280
the carrier of Aquarius.

259
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,040
And this is the age of the Aquarius.

260
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,360
So how important is this water

261
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,840
and the water is the carrier of divine love,

262
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,440
is the best carrier.

263
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,240
And this is the time of Aquarius means the Kundalini

264
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,240
is made of divine water.

265
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:51,800
So the whole idea of celebrating today the Lakshmi's day

266
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,920
is to understand that in us

267
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,280
She has become the Mahalakshmi.

268
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,960
By that we have so many powers

269
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,000
of which we are not aware, I mean we do not know that

270
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,120
we are realized souls. Some of us, we do not know

271
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,852
and that we have those powers within us

272
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,600
that we can permeate into others.

273
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,400
We can project our personalities to others.

274
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,840
We can find out what's wrong with them.

275
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,682
We can find out about ourselves. We

276
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,679
can go into ourselves, we can go into

277
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,520
our permeation is like water is moving,

278
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,115
is flowing all the time.

279
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,752
And this is a very important thing

280
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,880
that we should be aware of our powers that we have achieved.

281
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,120
Then we will start respecting ourselves

282
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,040
then the Rajalakshmi comes in and

283
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,320
then the Gruhalakshmi comes in

284
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,600
and everything comes with in when we become aware

285
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,640
of what we have achieved of our self-esteem.
