00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:06.855
What enthusiasm all over the world!

00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:15.277
The whole of Sydney, I think, has been
drenched of all their flowers.

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:20.129
And such nice things to say,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.507
the cards and the letters and the beautiful
poems,

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:32.272
the children are singing beautifully.

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:45.061
Words fail to express the feelings
of such jubilation

00:00:45.262 --> 00:00:49.760
and such sincere feeling of happiness.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.506
You needed a Mother

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.536
to look after you, to care for you

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:19.734
and to be able to transform you

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.528
with lot of wisdom.

00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:35.079
So every birthday I find

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:47.170
that Sahaja Yogis are also expanding
their hearts

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:56.832
and realizing that they are no more drops
but they are part and parcel of the ocean.

00:01:57.782 --> 00:02:07.557
And that the ocean itself is going
to strengthen them and look after them.

00:02:07.914 --> 00:02:15.630
It’s the ocean that is going to nourish
them.

00:02:18.214 --> 00:02:25.124
And the same ocean is going to guide them.

00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:29.909
So the connection between a drop
and an ocean

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.325
has to be fully established.
So the limitations of a drop

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:44.039
have to be absolutely dissolved
into the greatness of the ocean.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:58.517
With care and with nice things to say

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:04.189
we can improve the depth
of the collectivity,

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.820
and with sincere desire to be collective.

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:16.533
The desire to be collective has to be
very sincere.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:25.830
So, this expanse of your being will start.

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:31.058
The first thing is needed: a sincerity
to yourself.

00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:37.031
Of course, because we are coming
from a drop status,

00:03:37.232 --> 00:03:44.318
from a drop, a little limited drop,
from that phase,

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.969
so we get engulfed again and again
into those limitations.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.720
But we must see our own vision:
what you will be in future,

00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:04.878
what you want to be in future.

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:11.290
Thus the sincerity itself to the idea
that you want to be collective,

00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:17.836
itself, will break all barriers.

00:04:18.974 --> 00:04:24.931
If you are sincere to any purpose,
anything, then you forget the time,

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:28.893
you forget the labor, you forget
everything, you want to achieve it,

00:04:29.094 --> 00:04:32.257
even in small things.

00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:37.645
Now, this sincerity comes from where?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:42.361
There are two things which work out
sincerity.

00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:50.443
Firstly, you must see for yourself what
is Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:54.257
what it has given you.

00:04:56.054 --> 00:04:59.847
It has given you Realization,

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:06.360
it has given you that wider vision, it has
given you collective consciousness,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.468
it has given you thoughtless awareness
and doubtless awareness.

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:20.173
It has made a new personality out of you,
like an egg becoming a bird.

00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:26.347
And now you are a bird and you cannot
go back to the shell again.

00:05:28.503 --> 00:05:33.466
Once you realize what Sahaja Yoga
has done for you

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:40.354
and also realize what you have achieved
in that:

00:05:41.737 --> 00:05:49.140
that is you have achieved the knowledge,
knowledge of Kundalini

00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:54.790
which was a secret knowledge all these
years, absolutely secret knowledge.

00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:59.172
Nobody knew about it, it was all
underground.

00:05:59.373 --> 00:06:05.061
All the knowledge about Kundalini you have,
very clearly,

00:06:05.262 --> 00:06:09.387
without going to any college, school,
university, anywhere.

00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:13.694
Without going to any laboratories you have
experimented with it,

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:17.589
you’ve found out what is Kundalini.
You have seen with your own eyes,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:24.032
you’ve seen the rising of the Kundalini,
you have given Realization to people.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:29.557
Already you have experienced not only
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:06:29.758 --> 00:06:34.073
but you have also experienced your
own powers.

00:06:34.734 --> 00:06:45.116
Also you have seen that you have really
become

00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:49.823
so much different from what you were

00:06:51.044 --> 00:06:54.966
in your knowledge of understanding things.

00:06:55.167 --> 00:07:01.477
So, if your knowledge is so much with you

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:06.405
and that you are entitled to raise
the Kundalini of others,

00:07:06.606 --> 00:07:11.948
which was not done by any great saints
before

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:19.919
by any great Seers, Maharshis,
all these great people who lived.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.855
Only very, very few people had
this capacity

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:30.133
to raise the Kundalini, all these years,
that you have got it.

00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:32.654
You understand what are the chakras

00:07:32.855 --> 00:07:37.355
and you can diagnose it, even the children
can do it.

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:42.011
Which we don’t realize is something
so great!

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:50.599
At a human level we didn’t know a word
about it.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.743
We never even had heard the word
‘Kundalini’!

00:07:53.944 --> 00:07:59.800
And in such a short time you have become
so knowledgeable!

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:04.082
That’s the blessing of Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:08.221
So, when you see this: that you have
so much knowledge

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:12.589
and the light of your attention,
how it works.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.094
And then you see so many blessings
that work out

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:23.150
and how automatically, just without
doing anything, you achieve results,

00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:32.269
you are amazed and you can’t understand
how it has happened, how it has worked out.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:38.519
Suddenly I was there, this happened.
Suddenly I was there, that happened. How?

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.898
This ocean is every moment, into all
details, working out things.

00:08:48.982 --> 00:08:53.672
All these happenings should open
your eyes to the fact

00:08:53.873 --> 00:08:56.716
that you are no more like an ordinary
human being,

00:08:56.917 --> 00:09:00.853
that you are sages now, that you
are saints.

00:09:01.054 --> 00:09:04.406
So, our attitude has to be changed.

00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:08.157
So many human beings are still animals:
you can see the way they are killing,

00:09:08.358 --> 00:09:11.984
the way they are behaving - they are
not even human beings.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:15.627
We live with them, we see them every day:
they are criminals

00:09:15.828 --> 00:09:25.197
and not only that but they have very
low level of a culture in them.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.074
We can easily call them as animals.

00:09:28.275 --> 00:09:33.820
Then, we have some human beings who
are half animals and half human beings.

00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:40.844
Then, we have some human beings who
are really human beings, who are seekers.

00:09:41.268 --> 00:09:46.831
(Hindi) Let them come forward if they
want to. (Hindi)

00:09:50.593 --> 00:10:01.386
And this understanding of what you have
achieved in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:01.587 --> 00:10:08.411
should immediately make you realize
what you are.

00:10:11.624 --> 00:10:16.950
And when it all has happened to us,
automatically,

00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:21.043
you should be very sincere about it,

00:10:23.847 --> 00:10:28.093
you must feel that something really
you have achieved,

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.046
there’s something so great,

00:10:31.247 --> 00:10:38.782
so we have to be sincere, mentally also
you should feel that way.

00:10:38.983 --> 00:10:45.110
So, this is first thing you do is
to mentally feel, to mentally feel

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:54.143
that it’s so important, it is so -
it is so important,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:03.430
it is so valuable.

00:11:05.175 --> 00:11:09.103
You become very sincere about it.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:18.249
But the second part is different:

00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:25.348
where you see something, you know something

00:11:25.549 --> 00:11:30.070
and you start opening your heart about it.

00:11:30.594 --> 00:11:36.486
In the second part you have to open
your heart.

00:11:36.687 --> 00:11:41.232
So, the sincerity comes from an open heart:

00:11:42.648 --> 00:11:46.109
if your heart is not open, you cannot
be sincere.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:51.775
Now, what does it mean that your heart
is not open? Let us see.

00:11:55.592 --> 00:12:00.582
You are born again, you have got
your Realization.

00:12:00.783 --> 00:12:04.849
Also it is your birthday in a way.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:12.105
But in the growth of your knowledge
and understanding,

00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:16.872
you have not kept pace with your heart.

00:12:17.073 --> 00:12:24.366
But what is the reason for that? What is it
that keeps your heart like that?

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:32.869
You can discover very easily that
your heart rules the body,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.193
rules your brain, everything.

00:12:36.394 --> 00:12:43.600
Because if your heart stops, everything
stops.

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:48.826
But if your brain stops, heart won’t stop.

00:12:49.027 --> 00:12:55.819
So, heart is the most important thing and
it governs the whole being within you.

00:12:56.358 --> 00:13:05.960
Now, this special instrument, which is
very delicate,

00:13:06.227 --> 00:13:15.901
which circulates also, is like a stone.

00:13:16.102 --> 00:13:19.376
How will it pulsate?

00:13:21.647 --> 00:13:25.638
So, when we say ‘enlarge your heart’,

00:13:26.662 --> 00:13:32.351
it means that the stoniness of your heart
has to be melted away.

00:13:32.552 --> 00:13:39.723
But how does it become stony? We have
to go to the roots of that.

00:13:40.654 --> 00:13:48.208
It becomes like a stone because the heart
controls the brain.

00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:52.227
As there are seven auras on your brain,

00:13:52.428 --> 00:13:56.478
in the same way, there are seven auras
on your heart.

00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:05.464
And all those auras are the ones which
control the auras of the brain.

00:14:08.112 --> 00:14:16.466
Now, on the brain, as you know, there are
two institutions of ego and conditionings,

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:24.445
which starts pressing the brain too much.
As a result, all these auras get pressed.

00:14:25.934 --> 00:14:31.548
So, the auras which are surrounding
the heart also get pressed.

00:14:32.024 --> 00:14:38.299
But brain can think:

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.620
‘Yes, this is very good. I know how
to raise Kundalini, I know how to do this,

00:14:41.821 --> 00:14:45.775
everything I know’, part tells (?).

00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:51.508
It doesn’t become stony that way,
it can think.

00:14:51.709 --> 00:14:58.433
Anybody who is a stone-hearted fellow
can think. Like Hitler.

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:08.497
So, the brain does not get affected
by the conditioning or the ego

00:15:08.698 --> 00:15:13.209
to such an extent that it becomes like
a stone, it cannot think.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:18.314
If it is ego too much… (Just closer
if you bring, it would be better.

00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:21.146
It goes on falling, I’m holding it on.)

00:15:21.347 --> 00:15:28.186
If it’s an ego, then a person may become
stupid, but he thinks, he thinks all right.

00:15:28.387 --> 00:15:34.575
He really becomes stupid. Anybody
who is an egoist,

00:15:34.776 --> 00:15:41.517
whose Agnya is catching, becomes
a stupid fellow, no doubt about it.

00:15:41.718 --> 00:15:47.588
You see in his behaviour, whenever
he talks, the way he is trying

00:15:47.789 --> 00:15:54.141
to do anything, he’s such a show-off
and he becomes a stupid fellow.

00:15:54.342 --> 00:15:59.353
Any wise person can see that, that
he is such a stupid man.

00:15:59.554 --> 00:16:12.863
So, what we find, that mind is covered
with the superego

00:16:13.064 --> 00:16:20.318
but it does not make a person with
a brain which is stony.

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:32.875
On the contrary, it makes a person
a stupid person, not a stone-headed.

00:16:33.974 --> 00:16:39.348
And such a stupid man can go on
talking all kinds of things.

00:16:39.549 --> 00:16:45.778
And you can immediately recognize
such a stupid man, not difficult.

00:16:46.054 --> 00:16:49.949
The other side of this is the conditionings
in the mind.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.204
That’s even a worse thing, very sly.

00:16:53.405 --> 00:16:58.359
Because somebody has the conditionings,
he doesn’t come out of it.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.622
He doesn’t show off, but he's sly

00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:10.759
and his brain is covered with such ideas
which are asahaj.

00:17:11.081 --> 00:17:17.582
Like somebody saw Me, in a Puja, washing
My hands and giving that water;

00:17:17.804 --> 00:17:24.801
he said: ‘Why do you take the water which
is washed, which is washing Mother’s hands?’

00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:29.373
So, the other one said: ‘Mother has got
such tremendous vibrations in Her hands,

00:17:29.574 --> 00:17:35.915
that when we wash them, the vibrations
come in.’

00:17:36.116 --> 00:17:40.200
Oh, he couldn’t believe it! Because
the conditionings are

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.558
that whenever you wash your hands,
only the dirt comes out.

00:17:44.759 --> 00:17:47.691
So, they can’t think of vibrations.

00:17:47.892 --> 00:17:52.242
All such conditionings are there
in the mind of people.

00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:58.289
Because of these conditionings they
cannot take to heart.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:05.066
But what happens that they think about it
in a very sly manner,

00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:14.506
tell lies, talk nonsensical things and
try to convince you that they are right.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:22.593
They are not stupid, but they are idiotic.

00:18:23.621 --> 00:18:26.646
They talk like idiots.

00:18:26.847 --> 00:18:32.542
And that idiotic thing you accept!
There’s no wisdom in it.

00:18:32.743 --> 00:18:38.589
So, one fellow is a stupid fellow,
another one is an idiot.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.656
Between the two lies the Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:56.039
So, this conditioning makes the brain
pervert,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:05.552
but it doesn’t make it a stone.
Only what makes it a stone

00:19:07.604 --> 00:19:12.684
is that if he is born with some sort
of a mental derangement,

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:17.453
that he cannot think, otherwise the brain
goes on thinking.

00:19:17.654 --> 00:19:22.428
Whether with conditionings or with ego,
it goes on thinking.

00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:27.338
Such a brain

00:19:30.171 --> 00:19:35.413
should not affect the heart, because
heart affects the brain.

00:19:35.614 --> 00:19:41.000
But the auras which are manifested
from the heart

00:19:41.201 --> 00:19:47.089
start becoming dull or disappearing.

00:19:47.565 --> 00:19:52.584
So the auras around the heart are
very sensitive

00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:58.219
and they feel: ‘No use throwing light
on the brain’.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:06.568
They start becoming smaller and smaller
and that’s how the heart becomes small.

00:20:07.794 --> 00:20:13.631
Because they have no purpose in life there,
so they start becoming smaller and smaller.

00:20:13.832 --> 00:20:16.459
As a result, the heart becomes small.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.774
You call somebody as very small-hearted
fellow, is a chicken-hearted fellow

00:20:21.975 --> 00:20:26.693
or we always say such a man is
a ‘stone-hearted person’.

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:29.659
All this happens

00:20:30.713 --> 00:20:35.440
because of the conditionings and the ego
of the human mind

00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:46.649
and the result is felt by the heart
becoming a stone,

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:52.631
because heart is a sensitive thing.
Brain is not that sensitive.

00:20:52.832 --> 00:20:58.080
If you put something soft in the water,
it becomes hard,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:03.423
but if you put a stone in the water
and boil it, it won’t.

00:21:03.947 --> 00:21:08.239
So, heart being very sensitive and delicate
becomes like a stone,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.057
like as you boil in the heat of the brain
waves.

00:21:13.258 --> 00:21:18.474
And it becomes a very hard stone.
It does not know

00:21:18.675 --> 00:21:24.294
how to say even one word which is nice.

00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:27.999
It goes on hitting people all the time,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.747
saying things which one should not
have said,

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:39.430
all the time thinking, ‘What should we say
to hurt another person?

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.199
How should I try to really mislead
another person?’

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.542
because it’s a sly attitude.

00:21:49.585 --> 00:21:58.184
The ego part, the heart becomes again
frozen with ego

00:21:58.385 --> 00:22:02.146
and then the heart thinks - not thinks,

00:22:02.347 --> 00:22:07.520
but heart cannot emit any auras
to the brain.

00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:12.616
The brain starts thinking that, ‘Now,
the area of heart is finished.

00:22:12.817 --> 00:22:18.414
The heart cannot control us any more.’
Then heart starts thinking that,

00:22:18.615 --> 00:22:23.543
‘I will do all the work myself.’ I mean,
the head starts saying.

00:22:23.744 --> 00:22:27.309
And the heart becomes small, stony.
It doesn’t act.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:32.956
So now, the brain takes over. The brain
takes over and then brain starts.

00:22:33.157 --> 00:22:39.393
Brain starts itself acting in a manner
that we can’t understand:

00:22:39.594 --> 00:22:45.956
they behave like animals, they behave
like satanic people, they become very cruel

00:22:46.157 --> 00:22:52.940
and they do not know how to really say
something good to others.

00:22:53.141 --> 00:22:56.562
There’s a kind of a very false pride
in them

00:22:56.763 --> 00:23:02.249
and such people go on hurting others,
insulting others

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:08.569
till they meet another one like them
and then both of them collapse.

00:23:11.494 --> 00:23:14.407
That’s the only snag in the whole thing,

00:23:14.608 --> 00:23:17.242
otherwise, you would have been finished
by now.

00:23:17.443 --> 00:23:25.279
But because the two persons with ego cannot
be together, they neutralize each other.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.821
So thank God we are saved from them.

00:23:30.535 --> 00:23:37.489
So these two conditionings, which actually
are on the brain,

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:49.872
these two conditions freeze the heart and
also make the domain of heart as zero

00:23:50.073 --> 00:23:54.776
and then the brain starts asserting itself.

00:23:56.883 --> 00:24:01.963
That is how we do not know how to be
kind to others,

00:24:02.164 --> 00:24:06.385
how to be nice, how to be helpful,
how to be gentle

00:24:06.586 --> 00:24:13.382
and how to be reassuring, protecting
others.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:22.001
All this we have inherited already.

00:24:22.202 --> 00:24:25.736
We have already got a stone heart
when we come to Sahaja Yoga

00:24:25.937 --> 00:24:30.177
and we have a brain either full of ego
or superego.

00:24:30.378 --> 00:24:36.842
So now, with your Kundalini rising, you can
clear out your head, first of all.

00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:42.045
So, the sincerity will come when
the Kundalini will move

00:24:42.246 --> 00:24:49.355
and touch your Brahmarandhra, which is
the seat of your heart and will expand.

00:24:49.556 --> 00:24:53.192
Then the heart just comes back
like a king, returns back

00:24:53.393 --> 00:24:56.926
and starts dominating the brain.

00:24:57.127 --> 00:25:00.636
And when the heart comes back,
you immediately find

00:25:00.837 --> 00:25:02.735
those people with whom we were angry,

00:25:02.936 --> 00:25:06.644
we would not talk, we had nothing to do,
suddenly, we become friendly with them.

00:25:06.845 --> 00:25:13.596
There’s no problem. In many ways,
people have harmed you.

00:25:13.797 --> 00:25:18.776
All that harming and everything just
disappears.

00:25:18.977 --> 00:25:22.823
And you start becoming so nice
and beautiful.

00:25:23.024 --> 00:25:26.830
What has happened that Kundalini has
touched your Brahmarandhra,

00:25:27.031 --> 00:25:31.376
where is the seat of heart. And as soon
as that opens out,

00:25:31.577 --> 00:25:36.531
your heart also opens and it gets awakened.
It thinks, ‘Oh, what?

00:25:36.732 --> 00:25:40.493
I have allowed this brain to rule me?
How dare it rules me!’

00:25:40.694 --> 00:25:45.159
It just jumps on it. And we have seen
people:

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.951
suddenly, they’re so much transformed
that it’s remarkable.

00:25:50.152 --> 00:25:54.778
There - one gentleman in America,
he said that, ‘Mother, after Realization

00:25:54.979 --> 00:26:02.327
I was so much changed that I’ve become
a very mild person

00:26:02.528 --> 00:26:05.608
and I never used to wish my uncle
or anyone.’

00:26:05.809 --> 00:26:10.352
So he met him in some sort of a fete
and then he said, ‘Hello, uncle!’

00:26:10.553 --> 00:26:16.389
The uncle started looking at him. ‘Are you
all right?’ He would never say that.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:20.389
Then he went and saw: ‘Are you all right,
uncle? Are you keeping all right?

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.393
Can I do something for you?’
Very nice things he said.

00:26:23.594 --> 00:26:28.070
Uncle said, ‘What have you been doing?
Are you drunk or what?

00:26:28.271 --> 00:26:32.805
How can you speak so sweetly to me?
I can’t believe it.’

00:26:33.393 --> 00:26:37.220
That’s what happens. And that’s why
we have to understand

00:26:37.421 --> 00:26:41.145
that all these things can be easily
dropped out

00:26:41.346 --> 00:26:46.493
because we have acquired them. They can be
finished off because we have acquired them.

00:26:46.694 --> 00:26:51.239
They need not be all our lives,
our relations.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.343
So, ego and superego, both can be
blasted off

00:26:56.544 --> 00:26:59.070
once your heart is awakened.

00:26:59.271 --> 00:27:05.959
So, when we are dealing with people,
we have to break the ice also

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.121
by communicating with others in a very
decent manner.

00:27:10.322 --> 00:27:15.265
Like telling yourself, ‘No, I don't believe
that this man is so bad.

00:27:15.466 --> 00:27:20.673
Let me look after him, he may be all right.
You see, I don’t think he’s so bad.’

00:27:20.874 --> 00:27:24.763
So, to accept somebody as bad is very
easy for human beings

00:27:24.964 --> 00:27:27.353
and once they start accepting such a thing,

00:27:27.554 --> 00:27:30.314
then they build up a kind of a fortress
in which they live

00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:35.901
and they think they are the best people
and nobody else are good.

00:27:36.102 --> 00:27:40.142
And thus, the whole community, the whole
society,

00:27:40.343 --> 00:27:45.635
the whole humanity gets bitten
by these ideas.

00:27:49.062 --> 00:27:55.246
And Sahaja Yoga is the only way which
is going to cure it.

00:27:55.447 --> 00:28:00.845
Sahaja Yoga is the only way which is going
to finish this.

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:07.536
And that part is to be played
by you people,

00:28:07.737 --> 00:28:11.797
to understand that sincerity can only
come if you raise

00:28:11.998 --> 00:28:17.646
your Kundalini again and again and open
your Brahmarandhra.

00:28:17.847 --> 00:28:26.239
Then your heart will rise. It will become
a very awakened personality

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.538
and it will take charge of your brain,

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:32.573
which is all the time thinking, thinking,
thinking, like mad.

00:28:32.774 --> 00:28:35.824
And once that happens, then you will
realize

00:28:36.025 --> 00:28:40.385
that now you have jumped into doubtless
awareness.

00:28:42.174 --> 00:28:46.836
So, the relationship between the two
has to be fully understood.

00:28:47.042 --> 00:28:52.217
At first, the domination of the heart or,
we can say, the kinghood of heart

00:28:52.418 --> 00:28:56.799
is challenged, is put down, brought
to zero.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.269
And then this brain becomes the king,
and it starts ruling us.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:11.821
‘I think…’, ‘I feel…’ means the brain,
the ego.

00:29:12.022 --> 00:29:22.459
If you could give up ‘I think…’, ‘I want…’,
everything will be all right.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:27.983
You should say, ‘“I want…” is not
the point. This body wants it.’

00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:33.343
You separate yourself. Gradually you start
separating yourself

00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:36.357
from all such situations by never saying
‘I want…’

00:29:36.558 --> 00:29:41.876
You should say, ‘This body…’,
‘This hand…’, ‘This head…’

00:29:42.077 --> 00:29:45.078
You start separating. And once you have
separated,

00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:51.187
all these barriers of ego and superego
will disappear.

00:29:51.388 --> 00:29:57.078
But, as it is, also it’s very easy to get
rid of these two.

00:29:57.279 --> 00:29:59.871
It’s very easy to get rid of these two.

00:30:00.072 --> 00:30:06.045
Only by raising your Kundalini and breaking
your Brahmarandhra.

00:30:06.246 --> 00:30:08.985
This is the greatest achievement that
you have got,

00:30:09.186 --> 00:30:11.861
that you can break your Brahmarandhra,

00:30:12.062 --> 00:30:15.857
make your Kundalini get connected
with the All-pervading Power.

00:30:16.058 --> 00:30:18.171
That’s why I always say you must meditate

00:30:18.372 --> 00:30:21.776
and you must be in thoughtless awareness,
then it works out.

00:30:21.977 --> 00:30:24.803
Don’t pay attention to outside things
so much.

00:30:25.004 --> 00:30:36.142
Of course, you are, in a way, responsible
for Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:36.343 --> 00:30:41.724
because you are sincere about it.
You cannot force yourself.

00:30:41.925 --> 00:30:45.525
So, again and again I say, you weigh
your sincerity.

00:30:45.726 --> 00:30:49.799
‘How sincere am I to Sahaja Yoga?’

00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:58.719
And some people just take it frivolously,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:05.831
saying ‘Mother, I was silly, I was
confused.’ You cannot say that!

00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:16.805
You cannot say, because you owe
these things to Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:17.006 --> 00:31:22.324
Everything you owe to Sahaja Yoga now.
It’s a new life to you.

00:31:22.525 --> 00:31:29.465
So you cannot say, ‘I was confused’
or ‘I was silly, I was stupid, I did this.’

00:31:29.666 --> 00:31:32.088
You tell yourself you can’t do it.

00:31:32.289 --> 00:31:35.393
Mother has really worked very hard
with full sincerity

00:31:35.594 --> 00:31:40.963
and we cannot be insincere about it.
We don’t want to be hypocrites.

00:31:41.751 --> 00:31:50.598
This is hypocrisy, absolute hypocrisy.
You say something and do something.

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:56.400
If you have any sense of gratitude and
self-respect, then you should never say that

00:31:56.601 --> 00:32:02.198
‘By mistake, I did this, Mother’ or ‘I was
confused, I was silly, I was stupid.’

00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:06.393
That shows you are a very mediocre person
and you have no sense

00:32:06.594 --> 00:32:12.070
of gratitude towards Sahaja Yoga
nor towards yourself.

00:32:12.271 --> 00:32:17.414
But the best part of it, that I don’t need
Sahaja Yog

00:32:17.615 --> 00:32:23.510
and that Sahaja Yoga does not need you.
You need Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:24.391 --> 00:32:28.425
In itself, Sahaja Yoga is complete.
It does not need you.

00:32:28.626 --> 00:32:37.222
It is a complete thing, will remain
like that, absolutely.

00:32:39.154 --> 00:32:43.660
It will have its own position,

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:49.278
its own status, its own dignity,
everything intact.

00:32:49.479 --> 00:32:56.319
But if you have to get something out of it,
you have to work it out.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.209
Like from the river Ganges, if you have
to fetch the water,

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:06.140
you must have proper pitchers which are
deep enough to receive the water.

00:33:06.341 --> 00:33:09.588
But if you take a stone, what can you
bring out of it?

00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:15.722
But the Ganges flows. It is what it is.
It has its own capacities in it.

00:33:15.923 --> 00:33:20.218
It doesn’t change because you people
have taken stones.

00:33:20.419 --> 00:33:25.748
So now you have to understand that raise
your Kundalini as many times as you can.

00:33:25.949 --> 00:33:29.119
Try to put attention to your Kundalini
all the time.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.161
See where is the problem is. Get it
cleared out, absolutely cleared out.

00:33:33.362 --> 00:33:37.619
Find out where is the problem is and raise
your Kundalini many a times

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:43.230
and see that you are flowing all right
on your fontanel bone area,

00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:45.880
so that your heart expands.

00:33:46.081 --> 00:33:49.350
It’s a mechanical process in a way,
you can say.

00:33:49.551 --> 00:33:51.712
But even that you people don’t do.

00:33:51.913 --> 00:33:54.350
If you had done that, your heart would
have increased.

00:33:54.551 --> 00:34:00.499
And you yourself will say, ‘Mother,
my heart has become large like Asia.’

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.580
And then you see the miracle of the heart,
how it emits vibrations

00:34:05.781 --> 00:34:09.524
by which you become such compassionate,
such dynamic,

00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:14.456
beautiful people and so sincere
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.599
I would request you to open your heart
today for this puja.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.767
You have been very jubilant and happy.

00:34:21.968 --> 00:34:25.355
And must be your heart must have opened
because I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis

00:34:25.556 --> 00:34:30.761
have a very large heart for Me, but
for themselves they don’t have.

00:34:30.962 --> 00:34:35.743
They’ll do everything for Me, but nothing
for themselves.

00:34:35.944 --> 00:34:39.528
They’ll work morning till evening
to decorate the hall, to do everything.

00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:43.413
They must have sent all these flowers
to Me from I don’t know where.

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:48.483
But if I tell them, ‘You meditate for
yourself’, that they will not do.

00:34:49.358 --> 00:34:53.464
Or ‘You achieve this for yourself’,
that they will not do.

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:56.217
This is the situation.

00:34:56.418 --> 00:35:00.944
So, instead of wasting all your energy
for decorating all these things,

00:35:01.145 --> 00:35:04.058
you should decorate yourself
within yourself.

00:35:04.259 --> 00:35:07.197
With sincerity, with nice thoughts
about yourself

00:35:07.398 --> 00:35:11.677
that you are capable, absolutely capable
people

00:35:11.878 --> 00:35:17.365
and you can use your imagination,

00:35:17.566 --> 00:35:22.450
your intelligence, rationality, whatever
you think you have,

00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:31.300
to find the way, to find the way, again
I say, to keep your heart large.

00:35:32.895 --> 00:35:37.952
And this is the message for today’s
birthday all over the world

00:35:38.153 --> 00:35:45.134
because I felt that the whole world was
today like a big heart pulsating.

00:35:45.335 --> 00:35:50.131
I received the last phone and came here.

00:35:54.077 --> 00:35:56.998
From all over the phones coming,

00:35:57.199 --> 00:36:01.127
flowers are showering, the beautiful nice
things they are saying.

00:36:01.328 --> 00:36:06.313
Everything is there. When I am just
drenched into it,

00:36:06.514 --> 00:36:11.150
just drenched, it was too much for Me.
Such sweet, sweet things for the children,

00:36:11.351 --> 00:36:13.902
from the children, such things from
the ladies,

00:36:14.103 --> 00:36:18.924
some very, very nice from the men
and it was amazing

00:36:19.125 --> 00:36:25.670
how these people are bubbling with
enjoyment that today is My birthday.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:33.102
In the same way, please consider that
every day is your birthday,

00:36:33.303 --> 00:36:36.346
that you have to raise your Kundalini
all the time

00:36:36.547 --> 00:36:40.898
and keep the standard of your Kundalini
higher and higher.

00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:45.372
The more you open out, the more threads
of Kundalini will come up

00:36:45.573 --> 00:36:50.202
and the more your heart will open out

00:36:50.403 --> 00:36:53.858
and it will be awakened, it will become
more powerful.

00:36:54.059 --> 00:36:57.274
And with an open, big heart and a powerful
heart,

00:36:57.475 --> 00:37:02.686
you can dominate your brain, which is
giving you all these funny ideas.

00:37:02.983 --> 00:37:06.921
I hope this will happen this year here

00:37:07.122 --> 00:37:13.846
and people will try to make it a point
that we have a large heart.

00:37:14.047 --> 00:37:17.621
Large heart doesn’t mean stupidity,
doesn’t mean that.

00:37:17.822 --> 00:37:24.812
Large heart means the heart in which
you can put Me in.

00:37:26.471 --> 00:37:30.221
It’s quite a big person, Myself,

00:37:30.422 --> 00:37:34.878
so you have to have a very large heart
that I could reside into your heart.

00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:39.239
That is the large heart and that’s what
you all should have.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.854
If that happens, then everything
will work out very well.

00:37:44.055 --> 00:37:49.114
So, the surrendering part of it: you must
know how to surrender

00:37:49.315 --> 00:37:53.079
and you must know how to keep whatever
is not surrendered,

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:57.378
because you surrender yourself

00:37:57.791 --> 00:38:04.312
in such a manner that you expand
your heart absolutely.

00:38:04.513 --> 00:38:10.586
Put Me down there and then keep
your flowers with you

00:38:10.787 --> 00:38:20.177
to be given to Me at a time when you are
in complete control of yourself.

00:38:20.378 --> 00:38:25.824
So you have your emotions, your feelings
like flowers,

00:38:26.025 --> 00:38:32.331
that you have to keep to yourself, which are
the part of the same ocean of your heart.

00:38:32.532 --> 00:38:41.183
And, once you are ready, everything is
done, if the whole house is ready,

00:38:41.384 --> 00:38:44.497
now bring the flowers, the emotions,

00:38:44.698 --> 00:38:48.968
the nice things, the beautiful things
and nourish them.

00:38:49.169 --> 00:38:52.251
One must learn, I think, there should
be some books

00:38:52.452 --> 00:38:57.167
about how to say nice things to others.

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:01.696
We should try to find some books like that
or should write some books

00:39:01.897 --> 00:39:06.485
how nice things could be said, how we can
take care of others,

00:39:06.686 --> 00:39:14.385
how we can make another feel our love,
the expression of love,

00:39:14.586 --> 00:39:18.516
and that work, such a book will really
help people to understand

00:39:18.717 --> 00:39:23.458
that this is nice to say. And once you say
something nice to other,

00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:28.360
that niceness comes back, as I have
told you,

00:39:28.561 --> 00:39:31.439
like the ripples that touch the shores
come back

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:38.558
and then you feel very happy. Go on saying
things which are nice,

00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:43.160
which are pleasing, will be very much
appreciated.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.314
But if you say it with sincerity, not just
to tease someone

00:39:47.515 --> 00:39:51.536
or to say something, just to be so
superficially good,

00:39:51.737 --> 00:39:57.168
like ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you,’ but
something from your heart, as they say,

00:39:57.369 --> 00:40:01.617
then you will be surprised that the heart
of the another person will open

00:40:01.818 --> 00:40:09.315
and from that heart will flow those
beautiful flowers of emotions towards you.

00:40:09.516 --> 00:40:14.432
So, on one side, you have to expand
your heart and on another side,

00:40:14.633 --> 00:40:17.690
you have to reserve or preserve

00:40:17.891 --> 00:40:21.781
all the beautiful, nice, delicate feelings
within yourself,

00:40:21.982 --> 00:40:26.358
absorbed from everywhere and then
to pour them out at the right point.

00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:29.251
That’s the art.

00:40:30.158 --> 00:40:34.565
Like these flowers were in the garden first
to begin with, preserved, preserved.

00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:38.903
At the right time they were brought in.
So they feel more glorified

00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:41.397
that they are used at the right time.

00:40:41.598 --> 00:40:45.710
This is the way we have to be with
ourselves in our heart

00:40:45.911 --> 00:40:52.670
because human beings are very delicate,
very beautiful things

00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:56.619
and to beautify them you have to say
beautiful things.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:02.319
This tongue is not for saying harsh things,
for making fun of others,

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.550
for teasing others, but is for saying
something, such a beautiful thing

00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:13.266
that the another person also imbibes
that beauty.

00:41:14.228 --> 00:41:19.763
I’ve seen some nice things people have said
and that lingers in My mind.

00:41:19.964 --> 00:41:24.259
And I said, ‘When will I have chance to say
these things to others?’

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.796
So, think about it, that ‘Now this is
a very nice sentence,'

00:41:27.997 --> 00:41:34.738
‘This was a very sweet thing they said.
All right. So now, where should I use this?’

00:41:34.939 --> 00:41:38.393
As I go to the shops, I see something:
‘Ah, that’s good.

00:41:38.594 --> 00:41:41.803
That will be good for particular person.
Let’s buy that.’

00:41:42.004 --> 00:41:45.919
In the same way, if you find these nice
feelings

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:51.629
and nice emotions and nice things said,
then what do you do?

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:56.397
You collect them, all these things,
keep them and use them

00:41:56.598 --> 00:42:04.246
at the right time, at the right place. This
is what is the wisdom of Shri Ganesha.

00:42:04.446 --> 00:42:10.435
Innocent people are the most sincere
people, innocent people.

00:42:10.636 --> 00:42:14.415
Those who are clever and cunning cannot
be sincere

00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:16.664
because they enjoy their cunningness,

00:42:16.865 --> 00:42:22.584
they enjoy their so-called ‘brilliance”.
They can never be.

00:42:22.785 --> 00:42:31.509
Those people who are simple, who are
loving,

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:36.247
who care for love more than anything else,

00:42:36.448 --> 00:42:43.763
can only say very nice things sincerely.

00:42:43.964 --> 00:42:54.129
Today I wanted to say many things to you,
how I feel

00:42:54.330 --> 00:43:02.148
about this birthday in Australia,
but I told you the words fail.

00:43:02.349 --> 00:43:05.429
Because - see, Australia is such
a far-off country.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:12.429
To come here with so many people sitting
and singing ‘Agata Swagata’.

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:17.148
It is unbelievable, unbelievable,

00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:20.670
because I have not given you any money,
you have not given Me any money,

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.930
you are not bound to say anything
like that.

00:43:26.288 --> 00:43:31.665
But not only that you are doing it, but
you are enjoying it.

00:43:32.197 --> 00:43:35.680
It’s something great. You’re enjoying it
and that’s what it is:

00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:40.904
that when your heart is large, then
whatever you do for others, you enjoy.

00:43:41.105 --> 00:43:44.773
You enjoy doing good things. You enjoy
saying nice things.

00:43:44.974 --> 00:43:49.735
So we should have choicest flowers
of beautiful sayings,

00:43:49.936 --> 00:43:53.399
we should have choicest emotions

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.839
which we should be able to express
to each other.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.464
Now start on that from today, I have
to say: you start on this,

00:44:01.665 --> 00:44:05.716
that from 1990 we are all the time
going to speak

00:44:05.917 --> 00:44:09.919
something beautiful to each other
all the time

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:15.783
and just keep your ears open, keep your
eyes open and wherever you get a chance,

00:44:15.984 --> 00:44:21.878
wherever you hear something like that,
keep it in your mind and use it back.

00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:28.271
Today I am so enamored and it is too much
for Me, really,

00:44:28.472 --> 00:44:33.329
to believe even that there are so many
Sahaja Yogis

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:37.430
in Australia, which is so far away.

00:44:37.631 --> 00:44:42.778
Now it is your responsibility. It is
your responsibility

00:44:42.979 --> 00:44:48.548
to be sincere about Sahaja Yoga, and in all
sincerity, if you do everything,

00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:53.359
you’ll never think of such funny arguments
which I’ve heard before.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:59.028
You’ll just think that, ‘We love Mother
and we have together, to be together,

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:01.825
and we have to love each other
and all the time

00:45:02.026 --> 00:45:08.099
we have to say nice things to each other
so that the love increases.’

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:16.975
Anything else, anybody who tries to say
things

00:45:18.491 --> 00:45:25.841
or break things or breaks somebody’s heart
are doing sinful things. There’s sin.

00:45:26.042 --> 00:45:28.766
To break the heart of a saint is
the greatest sin

00:45:28.967 --> 00:45:31.886
and they’ll be punished for that.

00:45:32.087 --> 00:45:37.941
So, now you are all saints and sages,
you have to respect each other.

00:45:38.142 --> 00:45:46.832
Not only that, but you have to be enjoying
your sincerity.

00:45:47.033 --> 00:45:50.479
That’s the way, I’m trying to say,
enjoy your sincerity.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.499
And all these stupid thoughts come
into your head, throw them away.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.699
Because I heard of so many arguments
here and there and I thought,

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:02.824
‘What is this? They are Sahaja Yogis or
they are ordinary people of the street?’

00:46:03.025 --> 00:46:06.098
This is happening and then the children,
this happening, that.

00:46:06.299 --> 00:46:11.020
Now, about children also, I’ve been telling
you that: send your children to India.

00:46:11.221 --> 00:46:14.185
In any case, you have been selfish
about them.

00:46:14.386 --> 00:46:18.817
You know they are not developing all right.
So send them to India.

00:46:19.018 --> 00:46:23.220
In that you have opened your heart because
the whole world is your relation,

00:46:23.421 --> 00:46:29.183
the whole world is your family. You go
anywhere in the whole world, you will find

00:46:29.384 --> 00:46:34.627
people who’ll love you, who’ll care for
you, who’ll do everything for you.

00:46:34.828 --> 00:46:38.338
I mean, to know that in every place
there is somebody sitting

00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:43.429
just waiting to meet you as your own!

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.600
Just now I was thinking, ‘These musicians
are going to Singapore.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.244
What will happen? Where will they stay?’
Big problem,

00:46:50.445 --> 00:46:53.858
trying this and that. Suddenly, I gave
a bandhan,

00:46:54.059 --> 00:46:56.952
phone came from Bala. Bala told Me that,

00:46:57.153 --> 00:47:02.333
‘No, it’s perfectly all right. I’ll tell
my mother. She’ll look after them.’

00:47:02.947 --> 00:47:06.303
Problem solved. So, any such problems,

00:47:06.504 --> 00:47:09.767
your problems can be solved because
you are sincere,

00:47:09.968 --> 00:47:16.737
but if you’re insincere, you’ll meet only
insincere people and then you’ll go down,

00:47:16.975 --> 00:47:20.676
go down into your own estimation
and estimation of others.

00:47:20.877 --> 00:47:23.147
And you’ll have no place in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:23.348 --> 00:47:26.500
There’s no place for insincere people
in Sahaj Yoga,

00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:29.980
so try to develop your sincerity.
Raise your Kundalini

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:35.572
as many times as you can. Keep it there.
Keep it on Sahastrara

00:47:35.773 --> 00:47:39.888
and see that your heart opens.
That’s the best way.

00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:42.510
They’ve been all asking Me, ‘How to open
our heart?’

00:47:42.711 --> 00:47:46.617
I said, ‘Take the key.’ Now, I don’t know
how to tell them.

00:47:46.818 --> 00:47:50.764
‘Open your heart’ means just raise
your Kundalini,

00:47:50.965 --> 00:47:55.326
keep to the Brahmarandhra and see that
the Brahmarandhra opens.

00:47:55.527 --> 00:47:58.522
Not only that, but you see how

00:47:58.737 --> 00:48:02.690
by expanding your heart, by being nice
to others, how you feel.

00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:08.003
There are some people who do not talk
much, who do not meet others,

00:48:08.204 --> 00:48:12.430
who have reservations. They live as if they
are living in the air, sort of people,

00:48:12.631 --> 00:48:16.278
must know there must be some badhas,
some bhoots sitting on their heads,

00:48:16.479 --> 00:48:21.319
otherwise that’s a very unnatural behavior
for a Sahaja Yogi.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.841
I’ve told you so many things today because
I think the care,

00:48:26.042 --> 00:48:34.144
the love, the affection, the wisdom
and the patience is to be imbibed.

00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:42.186
If I’m your Guru, if I am your Mother,
you have to imbibe these qualities.

00:48:42.622 --> 00:48:46.554
For everything I’m worried. If somebody’s
in trouble, I’m worried.

00:48:46.755 --> 00:48:52.004
I’ll try to get the problems sorted out
of that person.

00:48:52.205 --> 00:49:00.694
Anyone who has a problem, I just - that
sticks to Me till I have solved the problem.

00:49:00.895 --> 00:49:03.559
And I tell frankly also about, say,
your children,

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.480
I tell about your wife, about your husband
that, ‘This is not all right.

00:49:07.681 --> 00:49:12.663
This must be corrected’. Because I care
for you.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:17.414
This is what should be your attitude
towards

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:24.491
Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and that will
strengthen you so much,

00:49:24.692 --> 00:49:27.727
because you care, that’s why others care.

00:49:27.928 --> 00:49:34.196
Can you imagine for an Indian woman like Me
to have so many people who care for Me?

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:40.401
Why should they care for Me, after all?
All right, you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:49:40.602 --> 00:49:44.626
but there are people who are not
Sahaja Yogis, I tell you,

00:49:44.827 --> 00:49:48.169
whom I, they are not Sahaja Yogis,
whom I have met from My childhood,

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.062
whom I know, my relations, - they all
care for Me!

00:49:51.263 --> 00:49:56.400
Just one thing, because I care for them,
I get bothered about them.

00:49:56.601 --> 00:50:03.153
Anybody who tells Me a problem, it is
in My head, sticks there like a stamp.

00:50:03.361 --> 00:50:10.004
Till I’ve solved the problem, I’ll be
looking out how to fix that problem.

00:50:10.433 --> 00:50:13.806
And I don’t have any problem of My own.

00:50:14.007 --> 00:50:17.101
In the same way, you should not have
any problems of your own.

00:50:17.302 --> 00:50:21.294
Then only you can manage. All right now?

00:50:21.495 --> 00:50:23.952
So may God bless you!
