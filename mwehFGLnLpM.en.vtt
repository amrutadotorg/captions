00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:06.063
Today we have decided

00:07:06.073 --> 00:07:10.908
to have a puja of Virata

00:07:13.073 --> 00:07:16.157
in the land of Shri Krishna.

00:07:17.532 --> 00:07:24.991
As you know, in the growth of Shri Vishnu's manifestation,

00:07:25.073 --> 00:07:30.407
He comes into ten incarnations

00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:37.199
and ultimately He manifests Himself as Virat.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:54.741
Virat is the brain of the being which can call as God Almighty,

00:07:54.866 --> 00:07:59.073
so the whole central nervous system is worked through

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:04.583
by Shri Krishna as Vishnu,

00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:08.302
then all this incarnations,

00:08:08.437 --> 00:08:14.062
then Shri Krishna and ultimately as Virat.

00:08:14.354 --> 00:08:18.770
This is the development of our brain

00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:23.354
and when we are worshipping Virat,

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:28.644
we have to know that within us also we have got

00:08:28.644 --> 00:08:34.644
the manifestation of this power of Virat.

00:08:34.644 --> 00:08:38.644
That manifestation which we have

00:08:38.644 --> 00:08:46.644
we can call it as Virat if Shri Krishna is Mahavirata.

00:08:46.686 --> 00:08:49.062
You all know about Virat

00:08:49.187 --> 00:08:52.686
much more than I can tell you today

00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:57.770
because It's the whole,

00:08:57.936 --> 00:09:00.853
It's the totality.

00:09:02.103 --> 00:09:09.437
And the totality of everything, if that is Virat,

00:09:09.562 --> 00:09:12.644
then that is in your brain,

00:09:12.644 --> 00:09:18.644
but reality is in your heart.

00:09:18.686 --> 00:09:22.853
So the totality you may see,

00:09:22.978 --> 00:09:25.062
you may witness,

00:09:25.312 --> 00:09:30.644
the reality is the subtlety behind it.

00:09:30.644 --> 00:09:34.395
So the brain which is not ruled by the heart,

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.103
which is not nourished by the heart,

00:09:37.228 --> 00:09:39.644
is a very dangerous thing,

00:09:39.644 --> 00:09:43.062
because it creates extroversion,

00:09:43.187 --> 00:09:48.604
and such a person who is without any heart

00:09:48.644 --> 00:09:54.562
tries to do things, becomes very ruthless

00:09:54.644 --> 00:09:57.103
and can be very dangerous.

00:09:57.228 --> 00:10:01.479
It could the other way also within us;

00:10:01.604 --> 00:10:05.187
that if we allow our heart to rule us,

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.644
only live with our emotions

00:10:07.644 --> 00:10:09.936
and not to use our rationality,

00:10:10.062 --> 00:10:15.811
then we can become really very dangerous people to ourselves.

00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:19.145
In the sense, we become lethargic,

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:24.604
we become indulgent into wrong sort of things.

00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:28.312
And today what one feels that in America

00:10:28.437 --> 00:10:29.895
there's more dominance

00:10:29.936 --> 00:10:34.020
of the left side than of the right.

00:10:35.604 --> 00:10:38.228
Right side is our attention

00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:41.644
and the right side of attention is we can say

00:10:41.644 --> 00:10:45.645
is the liver of God Almighty.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.562
So now when we have to talk of the totality,

00:10:48.644 --> 00:10:50.895
when we are part and parcel of the totality

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:56.145
and now we are awakened to that existence of ours

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.644
as the part and parcel of the whole,

00:10:59.644 --> 00:11:01.853
then we have to realize to become the whole

00:11:01.978 --> 00:11:04.395
we have to do something about it.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.103
Specially in the land of Shri Krishna

00:11:07.228 --> 00:11:10.312
we have to work out this tremendous task

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:14.853
of creating Viratas out of Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:16.187 --> 00:11:20.644
After going through the various experiences

00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:23.853
of American Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:23.978 --> 00:11:25.686
I've reached a conclusion

00:11:25.936 --> 00:11:29.354
that we have to talk more frankly about things

00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:31.644
than we have been talking before.

00:11:31.644 --> 00:11:36.145
Why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:40.644
while there are so many seekers.

00:11:41.644 --> 00:11:47.312
The main point is that we do not realize

00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:53.936
that the left side is overpowering this country very much.

00:11:54.644 --> 00:11:59.936
There are people who are active,

00:12:01.644 --> 00:12:06.395
but the percentage is very low

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.728
because of too much of affluence,

00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:11.437
too much of freedom,

00:12:11.562 --> 00:12:16.437
the idea of "what's wrong in anything."

00:12:16.562 --> 00:12:20.728
People are going towards shamelessness,

00:12:20.853 --> 00:12:26.312
immoral life, self-indulgent.

00:12:26.437 --> 00:12:30.520
And this self-indulgence, to protect that,

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:34.644
people always develop a kind of a ego

00:12:34.644 --> 00:12:39.562
which has no dynamism in it.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.644
So now the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis,

00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:48.103
not with Sahaja Yoga as such.

00:12:48.228 --> 00:12:51.644
When you see that the land is not so fertile

00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:54.644
and here you have to work very hard,

00:12:54.644 --> 00:12:57.936
the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis in America

00:12:58.062 --> 00:13:00.270
is to go deep.

00:13:00.562 --> 00:13:05.395
You can see wherever the land is not fertile

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.312
the trees go very deep down,

00:13:08.437 --> 00:13:14.645
they dig very deep into the Mother Earth

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.644
for the sap to be sucked in.

00:13:18.686 --> 00:13:22.604
And the same way they grow very high,

00:13:22.644 --> 00:13:28.728
because the strength of their deepening

00:13:28.853 --> 00:13:31.312
gives them this great height.

00:13:31.437 --> 00:13:33.354
So they grow very tall

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.479
and also they are very deep.

00:13:35.604 --> 00:13:38.811
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America

00:13:38.936 --> 00:13:40.354
have to work out

00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:43.103
because here it's so much superficiality

00:13:43.228 --> 00:13:45.354
and so much of frivolousness

00:13:45.479 --> 00:13:49.853
and also no meaning to their lives.

00:13:49.978 --> 00:13:51.936
They have no meanings at all

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.686
and they are just frittering away their lives

00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:58.644
with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions

00:13:58.644 --> 00:14:01.187
and their love and all those things.

00:14:01.312 --> 00:14:05.562
So what we need today are Sahaja Yogis who are right-sided,

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:08.644
those who will produce results,

00:14:08.644 --> 00:14:10.644
those who will be dynamic.

00:14:10.644 --> 00:14:14.145
They don't have to worry that somebody is right-sided

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.895
and he'll become right-sided,

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.187
actually that is what is needed today.

00:14:18.312 --> 00:14:21.644
Unless and until you have people who are dynamic

00:14:21.644 --> 00:14:23.728
we cannot work it out.

00:14:23.853 --> 00:14:26.686
It's a reaction in this country as well as in England,

00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:29.644
in many countries who dominated other people.

00:14:29.644 --> 00:14:32.437
Like you see in this place

00:14:32.562 --> 00:14:35.437
which was actually originally belonged

00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:42.145
to some tribes of Indians

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:46.644
and the English, the Spanish and all these Europeans came,

00:14:46.644 --> 00:14:48.644
killed them and occupied here.

00:14:48.644 --> 00:14:50.062
It's a highway robbery,

00:14:50.187 --> 00:14:51.686
absolutely highway robbery.

00:14:51.811 --> 00:14:58.062
Because of their arrogance and their aggressiveness,

00:14:58.187 --> 00:15:01.103
they could not see that they were doing such a horrible thing.

00:15:01.228 --> 00:15:04.437
I mean, why call any names of Hitler,

00:15:04.562 --> 00:15:06.644
they're even worse than Hitler,

00:15:06.644 --> 00:15:09.062
because at least Hitler was taken to task,

00:15:09.187 --> 00:15:12.644
he was condemned and people know that it was a mistake.

00:15:12.728 --> 00:15:15.562
But what about those who came all the way from there

00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:18.437
and killed so many people here

00:15:18.562 --> 00:15:22.103
and nicely having a very nice time everywhere

00:15:22.228 --> 00:15:23.644
as great Americans

00:15:23.644 --> 00:15:27.644
and now they are trying to show off everywhere.

00:15:27.978 --> 00:15:30.686
Actually it's such a sinful thing that is done

00:15:30.811 --> 00:15:33.644
that all these souls which have died

00:15:33.728 --> 00:15:35.644
I think have possessed them

00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:40.145
and now today America is on the left hand side.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.853
The right hand side of Americans is finished now,

00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:48.479
they are on the left hand side, guilty,

00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:51.479
feeling guilty they are taking to indulgences.

00:15:51.604 --> 00:15:53.644
Once you go to the right side, you see,

00:15:53.644 --> 00:15:54.936
you are very disciplined

00:15:55.062 --> 00:16:00.187
and you become very ascetic by temperament,

00:16:00.312 --> 00:16:04.936
I should say, and you want to dominate others

00:16:05.062 --> 00:16:06.728
and you want to capture.

00:16:06.853 --> 00:16:11.644
But today the situation of England and America is just the same.

00:16:11.644 --> 00:16:14.644
In England the same thing I find with Sahaja Yogis

00:16:14.644 --> 00:16:16.645
they are just lovey-dovey types, you see,

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:22.479
and all they love Me and love Me and love Me.

00:16:22.644 --> 00:16:25.312
And I just don't understand.

00:16:25.437 --> 00:16:26.644
What's this going on?

00:16:26.644 --> 00:16:28.354
They all love Me

00:16:28.479 --> 00:16:30.644
and they'll bring flowers for Me, finished.

00:16:30.644 --> 00:16:32.978
Is this the way we are going to work our Sahaja Yoga

00:16:33.103 --> 00:16:36.644
in that England and in this America?

00:16:36.686 --> 00:16:41.312
"Mother, I love you very much." So what?

00:16:43.811 --> 00:16:48.354
So to become one part and parcel of the whole,

00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:51.437
a drop has to become the ocean,

00:16:51.562 --> 00:16:53.853
you have to become great people,

00:16:53.978 --> 00:16:57.228
you have to be responsible.

00:16:57.354 --> 00:16:59.978
And this lovey-dovey business that you have

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:02.479
has to go out of your mind completely,

00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:05.895
otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.644
and you'll be cursed one after another.

00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:13.062
There are shocks after shocks

00:17:13.187 --> 00:17:17.562
that are coming to this country as well as to England.

00:17:17.644 --> 00:17:20.645
But people are not learning any lessons from that,

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.479
still it is all right;

00:17:23.604 --> 00:17:25.936
we get this disease, all right;

00:17:26.062 --> 00:17:27.644
then we glorify it.

00:17:27.853 --> 00:17:32.062
If we are suffering from ecological difference,

00:17:32.187 --> 00:17:33.644
still we are glorified.

00:17:33.644 --> 00:17:36.312
If you are using too much of machinery out of balance,

00:17:36.562 --> 00:17:37.978
still we are glorified.

00:17:38.103 --> 00:17:42.228
Because they just want self-indulgence.

00:17:42.479 --> 00:17:45.354
Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point

00:17:45.479 --> 00:17:49.187
that what is going wrong with this country is that,

00:17:49.312 --> 00:17:54.520
that they do not see anything that is reality.

00:17:54.644 --> 00:17:57.312
And the reality, though it is in the heart,

00:17:57.437 --> 00:17:59.312
though it works in the heart, it has to act.

00:17:59.437 --> 00:18:05.978
This has to act and if it does not act,

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.644
this kind of a passive behavior

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.228
is not going to help you.

00:18:13.354 --> 00:18:14.895
Now at this old age of Mine

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.728
I'm traveling from places to places

00:18:17.853 --> 00:18:19.645
and I'm doing so much.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:25.978
Now let us think about it: what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:26.644 --> 00:18:29.103
Those who see you,

00:18:29.228 --> 00:18:34.728
see you as sometimes as just some hippies with disheveled hairs

00:18:34.853 --> 00:18:37.644
and something that kind of a thing.

00:18:37.728 --> 00:18:39.644
This is the report I have,

00:18:39.644 --> 00:18:42.354
from people who came to your centers and things like that.

00:18:42.479 --> 00:18:44.978
"Oh, they are a set of hippies, you see," just like that.

00:18:45.103 --> 00:18:47.395
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do,

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.936
has to make up something of his personality,

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:53.187
in America is very important.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.644
They are studying, they are out of job,

00:18:56.936 --> 00:18:58.644
they are doing this, that.

00:18:58.936 --> 00:19:02.145
That sort of people are not going to help Sahaja Yoga at all,

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.145
they'll be liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.020
If you really want to do something you have to become something.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.312
You have to study, you have to become something,

00:19:10.437 --> 00:19:14.437
you have to have some sort of a degree, diploma, something

00:19:14.562 --> 00:19:17.228
attached to you, you have to mean something.

00:19:17.354 --> 00:19:20.686
Hippies cannot run Sahaja Yoga in America;

00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:28.145
they may run better in India but not here.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.644
So one has to realize that

00:19:30.686 --> 00:19:32.644
what has gone wrong with us is that

00:19:32.686 --> 00:19:36.895
we are now following a very subtle way

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.395
of the same trends that we have taken.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:20:01.604
After Realization, we think that we are realized souls,

00:20:01.644 --> 00:20:03.644
that we have become yogis now,

00:20:03.686 --> 00:20:07.354
that we are realized souls.

00:20:07.728 --> 00:20:11.062
But one should see

00:20:11.312 --> 00:20:13.728
that we have become realized souls, no doubt,

00:20:13.853 --> 00:20:19.644
but whatever bindings we had before coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:20:19.644 --> 00:20:23.728
have become subtler.

00:20:25.644 --> 00:20:34.145
They have not expressed themselves as lights,

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.936
just we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:39.644 --> 00:20:43.354
We believe that we have vibrations

00:20:43.853 --> 00:20:47.354
and also we can feel the vibrations.

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:50.686
But still we have not reached that state

00:20:50.811 --> 00:20:55.978
where we have become the totality.

00:20:56.103 --> 00:20:59.312
We have to still grow.

00:20:59.437 --> 00:21:02.562
And if you are settled down with your vibrations

00:21:02.644 --> 00:21:04.728
and thinking that you are all right,

00:21:04.853 --> 00:21:07.479
you are sadly mistaken.

00:21:07.604 --> 00:21:11.728
Whatever were our conditionings before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:11.853 --> 00:21:15.728
say you were a hippie,

00:21:15.853 --> 00:21:18.686
so the enlightenment has come,

00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:23.644
but then the idea of this love business is there.

00:21:23.728 --> 00:21:26.604
Supposing you were a business man,

00:21:26.644 --> 00:21:28.811
so the enlightenment has come to you

00:21:28.936 --> 00:21:32.853
and you think that Mother should help you in your business,

00:21:32.978 --> 00:21:34.686
that's what it is.

00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:37.644
Supposing now if you were unmarried

00:21:37.728 --> 00:21:39.437
and you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:39.562 --> 00:21:42.562
then you want that your marriage should be successful

00:21:42.644 --> 00:21:44.686
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:44.811 --> 00:21:51.644
If there has been a problem in your health or something like that,

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.936
then you have become a subtler person that you think,

00:21:55.062 --> 00:21:59.936
"I asked help from Mother for that."

00:22:00.228 --> 00:22:06.354
But we do not think that what have we contributed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:07.644 --> 00:22:11.520
We had certain things

00:22:13.312 --> 00:22:16.978
which we thought were wrong - maybe that,

00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:17.479
but in Sahaja Yoga we do not see those things are with us,

00:22:17.686 --> 00:22:23.187
still continuing with us.

00:22:23.312 --> 00:22:27.644
To become Virata we have to really examine ourselves,

00:22:27.644 --> 00:22:32.145
without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.645
I know people who are small-minded,

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:40.936
who have jealousies and their jealousies continue.

00:22:41.062 --> 00:22:44.354
Supposing there's a good musician,

00:22:44.479 --> 00:22:48.811
they'll not appreciate if the other person is a musician,

00:22:49.644 --> 00:22:51.145
he will not appreciate,

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.395
he will not encourage that person that,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.187
"Really I am a musician, he's also a musician, let me help him."

00:23:00.686 --> 00:23:05.437
So the small-mindedness that existed before

00:23:05.562 --> 00:23:08.644
still becomes in a glorified way.

00:23:08.728 --> 00:23:10.644
The person will think that

00:23:10.644 --> 00:23:13.728
"All right, I am a musician and I sing very well

00:23:13.853 --> 00:23:16.644
and I am singing Mother's praise."

00:23:16.644 --> 00:23:19.103
But anybody else who's singing

00:23:20.644 --> 00:23:23.354
will not be appreciated

00:23:23.479 --> 00:23:26.187
to that extent as you should expect

00:23:26.312 --> 00:23:32.270
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

00:23:33.562 --> 00:23:35.644
This hand, if it feels hurt,

00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:40.811
the another hand immediately helps it.

00:23:44.644 --> 00:23:49.978
In the whole body you see the system is so totally connected.

00:23:50.103 --> 00:23:56.103
As soon as you eat food, the digestive system starts working.

00:23:56.228 --> 00:23:58.562
But we should watch ourselves.

00:23:58.644 --> 00:23:59.811
If you have to become deeper,

00:23:59.936 --> 00:24:02.728
we have to watch ourselves where are we lacking.

00:24:02.853 --> 00:24:04.644
Now how does a tree grow?

00:24:04.644 --> 00:24:05.978
I have told you many times the story

00:24:06.103 --> 00:24:08.936
that there's a little cell at the end of the root

00:24:09.062 --> 00:24:11.103
and it knows,

00:24:11.228 --> 00:24:15.187
and it knows one purpose: that it has to become a tree,

00:24:15.312 --> 00:24:16.645
so it goes round.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.228
It sees a boulder or something, stone, goes round it,

00:24:20.354 --> 00:24:21.728
doesn't fight it.

00:24:21.853 --> 00:24:25.728
Because ultimately what we have to achieve

00:24:26.187 --> 00:24:28.728
is to become the tree,

00:24:28.853 --> 00:24:31.770
so we have to keep that in view,

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.686
that we have to become the tree

00:24:34.936 --> 00:24:38.562
and not some sort of a small little frog here and there

00:24:38.644 --> 00:24:41.062
croaking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:45.270
No, that's not going to work out!

00:24:45.644 --> 00:24:47.644
And this is what I find

00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:53.728
also very true about people in, say, England, same thing.

00:24:53.853 --> 00:24:55.062
The leaders are fighting,

00:24:55.187 --> 00:24:58.145
the leaders are trying to find out ways and methods

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.936
how to improve the quality of Sahaja Yogis,

00:25:01.062 --> 00:25:02.479
but it's the Sahaja Yogis

00:25:02.604 --> 00:25:05.228
who have to know that the responsibility is theirs.

00:25:05.354 --> 00:25:11.895
They have to grow, they have to become Viratas.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.644
And this is America

00:25:13.644 --> 00:25:16.644
where I told you is the place of Shri Krishna,

00:25:16.644 --> 00:25:19.686
where Shri Krishna became the Virat.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:27.728
Unless and until you see for yourself

00:25:27.853 --> 00:25:33.062
that we have to do this, we have to become this,

00:25:33.187 --> 00:25:37.686
you are still busy with our little, little silly problems.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:39.562
It's a vicious circle,

00:25:39.644 --> 00:25:42.644
as soon as you start worrying about your silly problems

00:25:42.644 --> 00:25:48.062
and your old stuffs still becoming glorified in Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:54.354
then you find the vicious circle starts working,

00:25:54.728 --> 00:25:58.437
it doesn't achieve anything,

00:25:58.562 --> 00:26:00.728
it doesn't give you good chances,

00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:05.187
it doesn't give you confidence.

00:26:05.312 --> 00:26:10.354
It's such a thing, it's like a packaging as they call it.

00:26:10.479 --> 00:26:15.062
But as soon as you decide, "No, I am going to do it,"

00:26:15.187 --> 00:26:17.103
you people are Sahaja Yogis,

00:26:17.228 --> 00:26:20.228
you know all about Kundalini,

00:26:20.354 --> 00:26:22.644
you know all about awakening,

00:26:22.686 --> 00:26:28.103
you know all about higher stages of attainment,

00:26:28.228 --> 00:26:33.644
you all, everyone is capable of giving Realization to people.

00:26:33.644 --> 00:26:36.644
You know where the thing is stuck,

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:42.644
everything you know, but now just think about it,

00:26:42.686 --> 00:26:50.936
how many of you have been able to do something about it?

00:26:51.062 --> 00:26:56.895
When people see you their idea about you is very poor.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:01.686
They think that you are stuck up with your wives,

00:27:01.811 --> 00:27:04.312
so the wife is very dominating,

00:27:04.437 --> 00:27:06.395
so this is happening.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.145
Suddenly you go off,

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.895
you see your child, worried about this one, you ...

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.686
Sometimes I am surprised that once they are married,

00:27:14.811 --> 00:27:16.644
they have a child,

00:27:16.644 --> 00:27:20.853
then they become nothing but the parents of the child, finished,

00:27:20.978 --> 00:27:23.062
Sahaja Yoga is finished.

00:27:23.187 --> 00:27:25.644
Then the child becomes important.

00:27:25.728 --> 00:27:32.187
The blessings become the bindings.

00:27:32.644 --> 00:27:36.728
So you have to watch within yourself

00:27:36.853 --> 00:27:41.020
that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.

00:27:41.437 --> 00:27:43.062
But in the subtle way

00:27:43.187 --> 00:27:45.728
all these things go on binding

00:27:45.853 --> 00:27:47.811
you and you are attached to it

00:27:47.936 --> 00:27:51.644
and you don't know how they are still tagging you down,

00:27:51.686 --> 00:27:53.437
don't allow you to fly,

00:27:53.562 --> 00:27:54.936
they don't give you the freedom

00:27:55.062 --> 00:27:59.728
that is your own right to have it.

00:27:59.853 --> 00:28:02.644
So even if I make a aeroplane,

00:28:02.644 --> 00:28:05.103
I do everything, put the fuel into it,

00:28:05.228 --> 00:28:10.811
I say everything, but doesn't want to fly.

00:28:10.936 --> 00:28:13.437
Now what do you do with such an aeroplane

00:28:13.562 --> 00:28:16.354
which doesn't want to fly?

00:28:16.479 --> 00:28:19.479
This sort of a situation is there

00:28:19.644 --> 00:28:22.853
and this situation makes you so limited

00:28:23.187 --> 00:28:27.644
and so dwarfy. How will you grow?

00:28:27.644 --> 00:28:31.978
Unless and until you grow and you show that

00:28:32.103 --> 00:28:33.644
in your day to day life

00:28:33.644 --> 00:28:36.437
into your personality, into everything,

00:28:36.562 --> 00:28:39.895
I assure you nobody is going to be impressed by you.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.811
Sahaja Yoga is not going to work by advertisement,

00:28:44.936 --> 00:28:47.479
nor by My photographs,

00:28:47.604 --> 00:28:51.936
it's going to work by your work, by your responsibility,

00:28:52.062 --> 00:28:54.479
by your shouldering Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:54.604 --> 00:28:59.437
it's your responsibility to spread Sahaja Yoga and to establish it.

00:28:59.562 --> 00:29:02.728
But first of all your shoulders should be strong.

00:29:02.853 --> 00:29:05.103
You are still out of job,

00:29:05.228 --> 00:29:08.354
you are still something, somebody hanging in the air,

00:29:08.479 --> 00:29:12.604
you are still somebody who'll not even look at you.

00:29:12.644 --> 00:29:17.103
Then how can you carry on your shoulders?

00:29:18.936 --> 00:29:23.437
So first thing is to build yourself inside

00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:25.479
as well as outside,

00:29:25.604 --> 00:29:27.354
but such a vicious circle I tell you.

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:29.644
If you do not go deep into yourself,

00:29:29.644 --> 00:29:32.437
you cannot also get the outside thing,

00:29:32.562 --> 00:29:33.978
so it works hand in hand,

00:29:34.103 --> 00:29:36.644
as soon as you start building yourself inside,

00:29:36.728 --> 00:29:39.686
you'll be amazed how things will work out,

00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:43.479
how you'll become dynamic, how you'll become great.

00:29:43.604 --> 00:29:45.062
But you get involved into things

00:29:45.187 --> 00:29:48.811
which are very small and transitory.

00:29:48.936 --> 00:29:53.187
So as I told you before, we are seeking the eternal.

00:29:53.312 --> 00:29:55.853
So the transitory things are to be only used

00:29:55.978 --> 00:30:01.020
very temporarily, what we need is not so important.

00:30:01.354 --> 00:30:04.936
If you can understand this thing clearly,

00:30:05.062 --> 00:30:11.062
that we still are not free, not detached

00:30:11.187 --> 00:30:16.644
from all the things we had before Sahaja Yoga

00:30:16.728 --> 00:30:19.811
and they have become subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:30:19.936 --> 00:30:25.145
We are still only using Sahaja Yoga for that purpose

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:31.187
and not for spreading the light.

00:30:34.354 --> 00:30:40.062
So what's going to happen?

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.145
This is absolutely,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:49.811
absolutely to be really to be understood within yourself.

00:30:49.936 --> 00:30:54.062
Sometimes My lectures, you see, are little harsh,

00:30:54.187 --> 00:30:58.062
people think that Mother had to say these things,

00:30:58.187 --> 00:31:01.145
this is also out of My love for you

00:31:01.395 --> 00:31:05.978
and out of My love for this country.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.644
You have to really see to yourself,

00:31:09.728 --> 00:31:17.644
"What are we? Where are we?"

00:31:18.686 --> 00:31:24.811
We are not going to end up because Sahaja Yogis we had

00:31:24.936 --> 00:31:33.270
were subnormal people in the society.

00:31:33.644 --> 00:31:36.644
If you see the gurus how they spread themselves,

00:31:36.644 --> 00:31:38.978
though they are false, they are useless

00:31:39.103 --> 00:31:42.811
but everybody knows about somebody who comes up. In two months time

00:31:42.936 --> 00:31:46.562
all over the world you can hear about that person.

00:31:46.644 --> 00:31:47.644
What they do,

00:31:47.686 --> 00:31:51.187
they go and first of all see the people who are successful,

00:31:51.312 --> 00:31:53.978
who are prominent in the city.

00:31:54.103 --> 00:31:57.062
They never bother about people who are drug addicts,

00:31:57.312 --> 00:32:00.479
or who are suffering from diseases, no nothing doing,

00:32:00.604 --> 00:32:03.936
they have no business with them.

00:32:04.062 --> 00:32:06.437
They'll just attack the people

00:32:06.562 --> 00:32:10.437
who are very successful, who are very rich,

00:32:11.103 --> 00:32:13.936
because they are on top of the society,

00:32:14.062 --> 00:32:15.811
so they'll go and meet people

00:32:16.103 --> 00:32:18.936
and make contacts with them and ask them and this and that

00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:21.644
and then they call them for the program,

00:32:21.686 --> 00:32:23.644
give them all the importance, everything,

00:32:23.644 --> 00:32:24.853
then people start thinking,

00:32:24.978 --> 00:32:28.312
"Oh God! What a great thing it is to be here."

00:32:28.437 --> 00:32:32.354
Then pamper their ego a little bit, this and that's how they spread.

00:32:32.479 --> 00:32:35.312
But there's no reality in it, there's nothing,

00:32:35.562 --> 00:32:36.644
nothing special about it,

00:32:36.686 --> 00:32:39.978
it's all useless, it's all artificial.

00:32:40.103 --> 00:32:42.644
But that is how they sell themselves.

00:32:42.644 --> 00:32:44.604
Though we do not want to sell ourselves,

00:32:44.644 --> 00:32:46.103
we have to know that

00:32:46.228 --> 00:32:50.644
unless and until we have some remarkable qualities,

00:32:50.853 --> 00:32:53.644
people are not going to look at us,

00:32:53.644 --> 00:32:56.270
because whatever has happened is within ourselves,

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.686
and nobody sees the light,

00:32:58.811 --> 00:33:04.644
it's like a light which is burning, which is covered completely.

00:33:06.354 --> 00:33:08.062
So I've seen that

00:33:08.187 --> 00:33:11.644
I went to Columbia. In Columbia, you'll be amazed

00:33:11.686 --> 00:33:13.853
that people had never known Me,

00:33:14.103 --> 00:33:15.644
they had never heard My name,

00:33:15.728 --> 00:33:18.728
but I don't know why but

00:33:18.853 --> 00:33:23.270
the crowds were so much that I couldn't enter into the compound

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.312
and with somehow or other I was pushed into it.

00:33:26.562 --> 00:33:28.770
Then in the hall was impossible,

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.644
people were hanging on the â€“

00:33:31.728 --> 00:33:33.437
I thought they were hanging

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:35.562
from the top, just sitting on the thing to watch Me over.

00:33:35.644 --> 00:33:38.644
So many people in every direction, in every height

00:33:38.728 --> 00:33:42.978
I found people there, I did not know how to settle them down.

00:33:43.103 --> 00:33:45.479
But they listened to Me very carefully this thing,

00:33:45.604 --> 00:33:49.062
two days we had the programmed, two days the crowds were there.

00:33:49.187 --> 00:33:52.604
And then when they had to follow-on they came,

00:33:52.644 --> 00:33:55.728
next day they disappeared.

00:33:55.853 --> 00:33:57.437
Same thing in Greece,

00:33:57.562 --> 00:33:59.644
same thing in Turkey.

00:34:00.562 --> 00:34:07.312
So there's definitely something wrong with us.

00:34:07.644 --> 00:34:09.936
Now there's a course coming up,

00:34:10.062 --> 00:34:11.853
people are trying to do the course business,

00:34:11.978 --> 00:34:17.187
but one should know it is not knowledge without love,

00:34:17.312 --> 00:34:18.978
it is love and knowledge.

00:34:19.103 --> 00:34:20.644
So how you talk to them,

00:34:20.811 --> 00:34:23.770
how you deal with them is there,

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.270
but your dynamism is going to impress them.

00:34:27.811 --> 00:34:29.936
You can see the film we saw yesterday

00:34:30.228 --> 00:34:33.103
in which the music was there. Now what was it?

00:34:33.354 --> 00:34:35.644
There the energy was dynamic,

00:34:36.644 --> 00:34:39.811
the energy was dynamic, with the music and everything

00:34:40.062 --> 00:34:41.312
and that was showing.

00:34:41.437 --> 00:34:43.811
So you see you got engrossed into it,

00:34:44.062 --> 00:34:46.770
so the movement of that energy, the dynamism of that energy

00:34:47.187 --> 00:34:49.644
really got you engrossed.

00:34:51.644 --> 00:34:55.644
But to be afraid that you'll become right-sided is nonsensical,

00:34:55.644 --> 00:35:03.020
now you are in the center, how can you become right-sided?

00:35:06.562 --> 00:35:12.395
This kind of argument is only to support lethargy,

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.062
then not to have any discipline.

00:35:15.354 --> 00:35:18.062
I was surprised that in Shudy Camp,

00:35:18.312 --> 00:35:22.811
where we have established a school for meditation,

00:35:23.103 --> 00:35:25.645
people come every week-end just to spend the week-end,

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:29.103
they get up at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

00:35:29.228 --> 00:35:30.686
whenever they feel like,

00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:33.644
they are on holidays in Shudy Camp.

00:35:33.936 --> 00:35:38.604
And two days they'll stay there without any meditation,

00:35:38.644 --> 00:35:40.103
without anything.

00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:41.811
We have come to Mother's house, finished.

00:35:41.936 --> 00:35:46.354
Mother has to do all the job for them.

00:35:47.062 --> 00:35:50.312
I mean, for a Sahaja Yogi it is minimum of minimum

00:35:50.437 --> 00:35:52.062
that they should get up early in the morning,

00:35:52.312 --> 00:35:54.686
have their bath and sit down for pujas.

00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:58.686
Is a common thing, all Indians do that way,

00:35:59.187 --> 00:36:01.062
It's a practice.

00:36:01.187 --> 00:36:03.103
Suddenly this country

00:36:03.354 --> 00:36:06.936
or these countries have gone into a kind of a lethargic

00:36:07.062 --> 00:36:08.145
nonsensical life,

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:12.604
otherwise this country also used to do the same thing.

00:36:13.228 --> 00:36:18.978
And sleeping also: you have to sleep early if you want to,

00:36:19.103 --> 00:36:24.644
but one has to think that we have to change our lifestyle,

00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:27.644
we have to change our attitudes,

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:32.228
so many things, see, like I said simple things, like I said,

00:36:32.354 --> 00:36:34.604
"The day you want to wash your hair,

00:36:34.644 --> 00:36:39.312
put lot of oil in your hair and then wash. We'll become bald."

00:36:39.437 --> 00:36:44.644
Imagine all bald Sahaja Yogis walking.

00:36:44.644 --> 00:36:50.644
They'll think your Mother has so many hair and what about your hair.

00:36:52.686 --> 00:36:56.312
In food also, too much, like

00:36:56.437 --> 00:36:59.270
I don't know here what is the situation, but in England I find

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.644
they take so much of tea,

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:05.644
all the time the tea is - the kettle is on the thing.

00:37:05.686 --> 00:37:08.354
I mean people are amazed

00:37:08.479 --> 00:37:11.728
when they, people come to Ganapatipule also in India,

00:37:11.853 --> 00:37:14.644
we don't take tea so many times,

00:37:14.686 --> 00:37:16.644
I mean twice at the most.

00:37:16.644 --> 00:37:18.644
The whole day people want tea there,

00:37:18.644 --> 00:37:19.811
they don't understand

00:37:19.936 --> 00:37:25.604
how can they go on drinking tea at one o'clock in the night.

00:37:25.936 --> 00:37:35.811
It's like the alcohol has become subtler: tea ,

00:37:35.936 --> 00:37:39.644
otherwise how do you explain?

00:37:39.644 --> 00:37:42.644
You can't take alcohol, so let's have tea,

00:37:42.644 --> 00:37:45.853
then settle down nicely, we are having cup-o-tea,

00:37:45.978 --> 00:37:47.644
in England very common:

00:37:47.644 --> 00:37:50.978
sit down nicely, cup-o-tea.

00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:56.604
What work have you done that you are settling down like that?

00:37:56.644 --> 00:38:01.437
Then whenever they'll come, "Haaa,"

00:38:01.562 --> 00:38:03.728
as if they have dug up something,

00:38:03.853 --> 00:38:08.978
or they have done the English Channel,

00:38:09.103 --> 00:38:11.644
they'll come, even on the television you'll see people,

00:38:11.644 --> 00:38:15.145
they come down, "Haa."

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:17.103
I don't understand.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.145
You'll never find any Indian doing that,

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:23.312
after all in that heat also, he'll never say that,

00:38:23.437 --> 00:38:26.728
because you think, think, think too much, just think,

00:38:26.853 --> 00:38:30.062
don't do anything about it.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.644
Like you file, you see, make a file,

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:35.562
tomorrow is Mother's puja, all right,

00:38:35.644 --> 00:38:37.644
we'll have this, this, this - filed it.

00:38:37.728 --> 00:38:42.520
At the puja it is not there, why? It's in the file.

00:38:45.811 --> 00:38:54.644
And anything that is before your Realization,

00:38:54.644 --> 00:39:00.062
like people have an idea,

00:38:58.604 --> 00:39:04.644
Labor saving is a very great asset of the Western people.

00:39:00.187 --> 00:39:00.187
like this how to avoid work, you see, labor saving.

00:39:04.686 --> 00:39:06.312
So the labor saving how they will do.

00:39:06.437 --> 00:39:08.644
Supposing, you say, "Please, telephone to such a person."

00:39:08.728 --> 00:39:11.103
"Mother, I think he may not be there."

00:39:11.228 --> 00:39:14.811
"Baba, you telephone and find out."

00:39:15.562 --> 00:39:18.644
So the explanation comes from the brain,

00:39:18.644 --> 00:39:23.145
it may not. So nothing can be achieved.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.644
So first the labor saving was that

00:39:25.644 --> 00:39:29.895
"Oh, this is anti-culture, we should be â€“

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.145
this is so bad, everything is so bad,

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.895
we should start a very natural life,

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.853
we should lead a very natural thing and that

00:39:37.978 --> 00:39:41.604
we should become primitive," and all that.

00:39:42.437 --> 00:39:47.644
From that if you grow in - from that area if you grow into Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:47.728 --> 00:39:49.936
you become subtler.

00:39:50.853 --> 00:39:55.187
So the subtler things that they become is this way:

00:39:55.312 --> 00:39:59.644
that now as it is, you see,

00:40:00.479 --> 00:40:05.145
"We should not do too much of everything, is too much, you see,

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.270
it is too much."

00:40:08.187 --> 00:40:11.228
If you talk to somebody about Sahaja Yoga, they say,

00:40:11.644 --> 00:40:13.644
"It's too much for me."

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:15.853
Hey, you have no brain or what is it?

00:40:15.978 --> 00:40:19.437
What is too much? Can't take it?

00:40:19.562 --> 00:40:21.645
"Oh it's too much."

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.312
It's a very common experience with Me,

00:40:25.437 --> 00:40:28.728
that when I talk to people they would say, "It's too much."

00:40:28.853 --> 00:40:32.312
I mean your brain, is it a limited brain

00:40:32.437 --> 00:40:37.728
or what is it that you can't listen to Me what I am trying to tell you?

00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:42.187
And once you start developing this kind of attitude,

00:40:42.604 --> 00:40:44.312
the nourishment cannot reach you,

00:40:44.437 --> 00:40:47.644
supposing the trees say, "Oh it's too much,"

00:40:47.936 --> 00:40:51.728
then what are they going to do?

00:40:53.728 --> 00:40:56.312
Nothing is too much.

00:40:56.437 --> 00:40:59.312
"I have to grow, I have to take all the nourishment,

00:40:59.437 --> 00:41:02.479
I have to become something,

00:41:02.604 --> 00:41:05.644
I have to do such a lot.

00:41:05.644 --> 00:41:06.644
What have I done?"

00:41:06.686 --> 00:41:12.187
Nothing so far. Never be satisfied with yourself.

00:41:12.312 --> 00:41:15.187
I mean, some people who saw My program

00:41:15.312 --> 00:41:18.103
they were all shocked how Mother is going to do it.

00:41:18.228 --> 00:41:23.728
I said, "I know I am going to do it, if I have to do it, I'll do it."

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.936
So this is what should be attitude:

00:41:31.062 --> 00:41:38.103
when you love Me I am your ideal. You must know that.

00:41:38.228 --> 00:41:42.562
If you love Me, then what are you doing about it?

00:41:42.644 --> 00:41:55.103
I am your ideal. You have to reach My style,

00:41:57.728 --> 00:42:01.395
otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out in these countries

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:08.062
which have taken to lethargy as a great culture.

00:42:08.437 --> 00:42:10.728
I asked somebody, "What about your bathing,

00:42:10.853 --> 00:42:12.145
why didn't you take bath?"

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.811
He said, "These days it is out of fashion to take bath."

00:42:17.437 --> 00:42:22.811
Everything seems to be out of fashion, whatever is in fashion is horrid.

00:42:23.354 --> 00:42:25.895
"It's very fashionable," is another thing people say,

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.062
"it's very fashionable,"

00:42:28.187 --> 00:42:31.978
and whatever is fashionable looks so ugly to Me.

00:42:33.728 --> 00:42:36.728
Now if you have to take to the Sahaj culture,

00:42:36.978 --> 00:42:40.811
you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life.

00:42:41.062 --> 00:42:43.228
We have to have education, we have to have a place,

00:42:43.354 --> 00:42:47.811
we have to have a position in the society.

00:42:47.936 --> 00:42:50.604
Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas,

00:42:50.644 --> 00:42:54.644
somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there

00:42:54.644 --> 00:43:00.312
and just doing our Tapasya.

00:43:00.437 --> 00:43:08.437
Tapasya is here where you live.

00:43:08.562 --> 00:43:12.604
Otherwise if you say that "All right we have to go to Himalayas

00:43:12.644 --> 00:43:16.354
and there we have to do Tapasya in the cold winds.

00:43:16.479 --> 00:43:18.103
Oh, that's very good."

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:20.228
Because that looks like something, you see,

00:43:20.354 --> 00:43:23.395
you might have a name, or something like that.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.437
But Tapasya is here,

00:43:25.562 --> 00:43:27.978
the detachment has to be worked out here.

00:43:28.103 --> 00:43:31.062
You get involved into all these things,

00:43:31.187 --> 00:43:33.895
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.145
the amount of involvement you have

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:44.354
in the things which existed in gross form,

00:43:44.479 --> 00:43:47.853
they have become subtler and you are still bound by them,

00:43:47.978 --> 00:43:52.644
there's no freedom.

00:43:56.228 --> 00:43:59.644
And that's why when you see something absurd happening,

00:43:59.644 --> 00:44:02.437
you see something funny happening in Sahaja Yoga,

00:44:02.562 --> 00:44:06.312
it's just the symptom of that thing becoming subtler

00:44:06.437 --> 00:44:11.644
within us and its expressing itself.

00:44:12.479 --> 00:44:14.562
Like sometimes you may not see fire

00:44:14.644 --> 00:44:21.644
but it exists and suddenly you find a blast.

00:44:22.103 --> 00:44:28.479
So transformation of course means evolution,

00:44:28.604 --> 00:44:29.644
it also means that whatever basis you had,

00:44:29.686 --> 00:44:31.644
you have to evolve out of it.

00:44:31.644 --> 00:44:40.479
Like a flower blossoming and then becoming the fruit,

00:44:40.604 --> 00:44:45.936
but it has to drop out many things.

00:44:47.644 --> 00:44:53.644
And then with the nature one has to see such a unison.

00:44:55.562 --> 00:45:01.853
In the nature if you see, it sucks the water.

00:45:01.978 --> 00:45:07.354
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

00:45:07.479 --> 00:45:16.644
Then it becomes a cloud and then the cloud waits,

00:45:16.644 --> 00:45:19.187
because the leaves drop out.

00:45:19.312 --> 00:45:26.187
In the winter time they nourish the tree with their nitrogen;

00:45:26.312 --> 00:45:28.644
when the time is ready,

00:45:28.644 --> 00:45:35.644
then these clouds pour down and again nourish this.

00:45:35.686 --> 00:45:41.062
Such a complete balance is in the nature.

00:45:41.187 --> 00:45:45.228
If it was not, I tell you they would, we would, have said,

00:45:45.354 --> 00:45:49.936
"all bald headed lands here."

00:45:50.853 --> 00:45:55.895
If you go to any, any forest, any forest, it's so clean,

00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.354
you never have any bad smell anywhere whatsoever.

00:46:00.479 --> 00:46:03.644
There are animals, there are tigers, that, this â€“

00:46:03.644 --> 00:46:06.354
never get any smell anywhere,

00:46:06.479 --> 00:46:08.145
you never even get the smell of a tiger.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:13.479
But if you put the tiger in a cage then he starts smelling,

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:16.895
he's so much bathed in the nature, he lives with the nature,

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.936
and in such balance.

00:46:21.062 --> 00:46:24.437
It's such an understanding among all the animals, everything.

00:46:24.562 --> 00:46:28.312
I don't know how they keep it so clean,

00:46:28.437 --> 00:46:32.145
but as soon as you get some smell,

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:38.644
you will find out there must be some human being somewhere,

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:43.312
or some untidiness.

00:46:43.437 --> 00:46:48.228
It's so organized how the leaves grow according to the sun's rays,

00:46:48.354 --> 00:46:49.978
how they organize themselves,

00:46:50.103 --> 00:46:54.604
how they build up themselves.

00:46:54.644 --> 00:46:58.479
So if you really have to get to the nature of Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:58.604 --> 00:47:03.062
we should get all these blessings

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:05.895
by which we should prosper.

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:12.853
Not, I mean in money and things, but in every way.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:19.479
So it should not be a set of people who are just sort of parasites.

00:47:21.644 --> 00:47:28.145
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:31.644
and I request you, all of you,

00:47:31.644 --> 00:47:34.645
to be alert and dynamic

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:36.936
and work it out.

00:47:37.062 --> 00:47:39.228
Each single person has to come up.

00:47:39.354 --> 00:47:42.686
It's not going to work out if you wear some saffron clothes

00:47:42.811 --> 00:47:45.728
and go on singing "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" on the street.

00:47:45.853 --> 00:47:51.978
No. It's not going to work out.

00:47:52.103 --> 00:47:54.145
Nor it is going to work out if you say,

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:57.644
"We are Sahaja Yogis, we are such people and this and that."

00:47:57.728 --> 00:48:02.395
Nothing. You have to be something.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.853
So on one side, the dynamism is to be used for yourself

00:48:06.978 --> 00:48:12.644
and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:12.644 --> 00:48:18.187
You need not now worry about right-sidedness.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.644
Is very common even in ...

00:48:20.644 --> 00:48:23.479
This happened: I found in Holland

00:48:23.604 --> 00:48:28.644
that I married one girl, very dynamic girl, to someone

00:48:28.686 --> 00:48:32.145
and the husband said, "Mother, she doesn't help me."

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:33.644
I said, "Why?"

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:36.644
"Because I'm afraid I'll become right-sided."

00:48:36.644 --> 00:48:40.811
I said, "But why did I marry you to this left-sided fellow?

00:48:40.936 --> 00:48:43.437
That you become left-sided?"

00:48:43.562 --> 00:48:45.312
Left-sided is a very good thing

00:48:45.437 --> 00:48:48.187
because you don't have to do anything, just you have to say,

00:48:48.312 --> 00:48:57.354
"I don't want to become right-sided," that's all.

00:48:57.479 --> 00:49:00.395
But right-sidedness means you have to look,

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.479
you have to be alert, you have to be clever

00:49:03.604 --> 00:49:08.644
and you have to know everything.

00:49:08.644 --> 00:49:11.728
You'll sit in the sun, burn your skins,

00:49:11.853 --> 00:49:14.312
but look at the sun.

00:49:14.437 --> 00:49:21.562
Are you on the sun line or on the moon line?

00:49:21.644 --> 00:49:27.644
So the swing of all the Western people is on the left hand side.

00:49:27.644 --> 00:49:37.562
Drinking, pubs, like in 24 hours they sleep,

00:49:37.644 --> 00:49:39.228
say maybe fourteen hours,

00:49:39.354 --> 00:49:39.354
maybe eighteen hours,

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:44.686
rest of the time they drink, that's all.

00:49:44.811 --> 00:49:49.103
We have one house being built next to us,

00:49:49.479 --> 00:49:50.811
when we shifted there, they said,

00:49:50.936 --> 00:49:53.686
"This is practically finished now" - still finishing

00:49:53.811 --> 00:49:55.978
and will take at least three years more maybe,

00:49:56.103 --> 00:49:57.644
may never finish.

00:49:57.686 --> 00:50:01.103
It's like the mathematics, you see, you have this

00:50:01.228 --> 00:50:04.644
that there was a work and somebody came,

00:50:04.728 --> 00:50:07.145
he did one tenth and ran away.

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:09.853
Then somebody came did one twentieth and ran away.

00:50:09.978 --> 00:50:12.395
Then somebody came he did one fortieth and ran away.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.644
When will the work finish? It will never finish,

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:18.644
with such running away people, never finish.

00:50:18.728 --> 00:50:20.811
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:20.936 --> 00:50:22.479
If you put mathematically,

00:50:22.604 --> 00:50:24.811
Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America,

00:50:24.936 --> 00:50:32.145
if you add up more and more of this kind of people.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:34.479
So much is happening in this country,

00:50:34.604 --> 00:50:36.228
but you have to see those people, you have to meet those people

00:50:36.354 --> 00:50:41.479
who are at the helm of affairs, who are the people who matter,

00:50:41.604 --> 00:50:46.103
who are scientific, who are talking about something sensible.

00:50:46.228 --> 00:50:50.686
You have to talk to them, get to them.

00:50:53.062 --> 00:50:55.645
We don't need cinema actors and actresses,

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:59.479
but we need people who are dynamic.

00:50:59.604 --> 00:51:01.228
And this may work out

00:51:01.354 --> 00:51:05.520
if you put your minds to it and we have something to show them.

00:51:08.437 --> 00:51:10.354
I would say that Austria is one place

00:51:10.479 --> 00:51:12.395
where Sahaja Yoga has worked very well,

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:17.853
Milan is another place and where most of them are professionals.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.644
It's very surprising, in modern times we are living.

00:51:23.728 --> 00:51:25.936
We are not living in those ancient times

00:51:26.062 --> 00:51:30.145
where the Rishi Munis used to sit under a tree

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:35.145
and the kings used to come and touch their feet.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:36.811
Is the other way round;

00:51:36.936 --> 00:51:43.644
the Rishi Munis have to go and talk to the kings.

00:51:44.936 --> 00:51:48.228
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis

00:51:48.354 --> 00:51:50.312
we have to know that in a subtle way

00:51:50.437 --> 00:51:52.187
we are still caught up into the webs of

00:51:52.312 --> 00:51:57.644
our own understanding about life. So, that we have to change.

00:51:57.644 --> 00:52:01.354
Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga

00:52:01.479 --> 00:52:11.270
and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others.

00:52:12.354 --> 00:52:16.644
So I hope you will listen to My lecture today,

00:52:16.644 --> 00:52:19.644
you will take the tapes home and listen to them

00:52:19.644 --> 00:52:21.354
again and again.

00:52:21.479 --> 00:52:24.312
Also there's a warning from people that

00:52:24.437 --> 00:52:31.604
"Mother, what they do is to take one tape for one center

00:52:31.644 --> 00:52:34.644
and everybody listens it and then finished."

00:52:34.686 --> 00:52:40.437
Meaning, you all should have one tape each.

00:52:40.562 --> 00:52:42.936
Even that, people don't do.

00:52:43.062 --> 00:52:45.644
Not only that, but now it might be after some time

00:52:45.644 --> 00:52:52.644
only one, one tape in circulation in one country.

00:52:52.728 --> 00:52:56.354
They circulate; say, today in New York, tomorrow in Boston,

00:52:56.479 --> 00:53:01.145
like that. You have to listen to it again and again.

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:03.644
Sit down with your paper and pencil,

00:53:03.644 --> 00:53:05.644
see for yourself what I am saying.

00:53:05.728 --> 00:53:08.395
Every tape should be with you.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.644
I mean, these horrible gurus' tapes

00:53:10.644 --> 00:53:14.645
you can hear them in every car, in every place,

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:17.644
everyone they have it.

00:53:17.686 --> 00:53:22.604
And why is it Sahaja Yogis don't have any tapes with them?

00:53:22.644 --> 00:53:26.644
You can make copies.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:31.562
But if you can get it free, they'll like to have.

00:53:31.644 --> 00:53:37.978
That's the first thing, what we can get free, cheaply, easily.

00:53:38.103 --> 00:53:44.437
If you try to save money, the money tries to save itself.

00:53:44.562 --> 00:53:51.103
It's a mutual understanding.

00:53:54.312 --> 00:53:57.645
It's as simple as this: supposing you open only one door,

00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:58.853
no air will come in.

00:53:58.978 --> 00:54:01.728
You open the other door the air will start flowing.

00:54:01.853 --> 00:54:06.270
It's a circulation.

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:10.395
All this can be your own knowledge too,

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.604
I need not say anything, this is all in your brains,

00:54:13.644 --> 00:54:16.645
only open out yourself, you are not free people.

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.395
If you are free like Me,

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:23.978
you'll see all these things coming from your own brains.

00:54:24.644 --> 00:54:28.895
Specially for America, really, as you know, I am working very hard

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.686
and I want to work it out because,

00:54:31.811 --> 00:54:35.187
if America is not all right, My Vishuddhi is not going to be all right.

00:54:35.312 --> 00:54:39.644
It's going to trouble Me throughout.

00:54:39.728 --> 00:54:44.853
So you have to take it up upon yourself.

00:54:44.978 --> 00:54:51.062
I don't say, "Take the cross."

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:53.853
You don't have to sacrifice anything,

00:54:53.978 --> 00:55:01.062
but you have to be just aware about what are we,

00:55:01.187 --> 00:55:04.686
what are we doing, where are we?

00:55:04.811 --> 00:55:07.228
And on top of that,

00:55:07.354 --> 00:55:13.187
Sahaja Yogis think they are obliging Sahaja Yoga and Me too.

00:55:13.644 --> 00:55:18.562
This is something. It's to be explained this way:

00:55:18.644 --> 00:55:21.187
I don't need Sahaja Yoga, you need Sahaja Yoga

00:55:21.312 --> 00:55:23.562
and everybody needs Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:23.644 --> 00:55:25.853
You had in this country people like,

00:55:25.978 --> 00:55:28.395
I mean such great, great people you had

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.853
I need not mention - persons like Abraham Lincoln

00:55:31.978 --> 00:55:38.103
who gave such great ideas to the whole world.

00:55:39.354 --> 00:55:41.686
Why not you people be great?

00:55:41.811 --> 00:55:43.644
He was a realized soul, all right,

00:55:43.644 --> 00:55:50.645
but he didn't know anything about Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.

00:55:50.770 --> 00:55:55.562
Why can't you become great like him?

00:56:00.228 --> 00:56:03.312
So on a Virata Puja we have to decide

00:56:03.562 --> 00:56:06.644
that we are all going to express

00:56:06.644 --> 00:56:12.187
the conception that was once the Virat

00:56:12.312 --> 00:56:14.644
as reality in our lives.

00:56:14.728 --> 00:56:21.644
This is what we have to pray from our heart.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:26.312
And it's a very good occasion today to do that,

00:56:26.437 --> 00:56:30.187
because we are sitting in a place where there were

00:56:30.312 --> 00:56:36.978
so many of these aboriginal people, you call them, anything.

00:56:37.103 --> 00:56:40.562
They were so sensible,

00:56:40.644 --> 00:56:44.354
as in America you say brass tacks, you see.

00:56:44.479 --> 00:56:52.644
They knew the principle how to lead a real spiritual life.

00:56:52.686 --> 00:56:57.187
They were very free people, extremely free

00:56:57.644 --> 00:57:01.312
and so detached.

00:57:01.437 --> 00:57:03.644
So if you do not correct yourself,

00:57:03.728 --> 00:57:05.978
then there will be a problem on collectivity.

00:57:06.103 --> 00:57:07.645
If there's a problem in collectivity,

00:57:07.770 --> 00:57:10.228
it will reflect on you,

00:57:10.354 --> 00:57:13.395
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:16.354
If there's a problem in the whole being

00:57:16.479 --> 00:57:18.187
there's a problem for you.

00:57:18.312 --> 00:57:20.062
And if there's a problem in one part,

00:57:20.187 --> 00:57:22.479
there's a problem for the whole being.

00:57:22.604 --> 00:57:25.645
Even Roosevelt who was your president once said that

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:29.312
"Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere."

00:57:29.437 --> 00:57:33.811
He could see this point so clearly.

00:57:33.936 --> 00:57:36.103
You see, all these sayings show us

00:57:36.228 --> 00:57:39.062
that this is a country of Virat,

00:57:39.187 --> 00:57:40.644
where they talk of collectivity,

00:57:40.644 --> 00:57:44.562
they have all the communications

00:57:44.644 --> 00:57:46.437
which are important.

00:57:46.562 --> 00:57:48.644
Every sort of communication is important,

00:57:48.686 --> 00:57:49.853
but for Sahaja Yogis

00:57:49.978 --> 00:57:53.479
it has to be very subtle, very dynamic,

00:57:53.604 --> 00:57:55.562
very beautiful, very loving,

00:57:55.644 --> 00:57:59.853
very impressive, magnetic.

00:57:59.978 --> 00:58:04.354
Then only the communications will work.

00:58:04.479 --> 00:58:08.644
There's no harm in wearing very nice dresses.

00:58:08.644 --> 00:58:13.853
There's no harm in wearing - nice doesn't mean expensive,

00:58:13.978 --> 00:58:21.644
but means which are sensible, dignified.

00:58:21.644 --> 00:58:25.103
We have to build up our personalities,

00:58:25.228 --> 00:58:33.978
that people should feel that "Oh, this is something, eh."

00:58:34.103 --> 00:58:39.936
And your children will also learn from you.

00:58:40.062 --> 00:58:42.728
There's no question of feeling that

00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:43.437
you'll be driven into ego or anything,

00:58:43.644 --> 00:58:51.686
that's finished now, ego is finished here, there's no ego.

00:58:51.811 --> 00:58:56.395
What I find here is a justification

00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.645
for doing nothing

00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:05.354
that we do not want to do anything because our ego will come up.

00:59:05.479 --> 00:59:12.312
Very clever.

00:59:15.811 --> 00:59:19.187
So with all this one has to know

00:59:19.312 --> 00:59:21.936
that we are selected people,

00:59:22.062 --> 00:59:25.354
we are chosen people of God.

00:59:25.479 --> 00:59:27.645
He must have selected us with some purpose,

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:31.354
otherwise there are so many people in this country.

00:59:31.479 --> 00:59:35.354
You are the foundation and you have to be solid people

00:59:35.479 --> 00:59:37.644
to be the foundation.

00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:41.395
Must know our own glory,

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.604
our own speciality

00:59:44.644 --> 00:59:47.187
that why we are selected,

00:59:47.312 --> 00:59:50.145
of all the people why are we there?

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:56.562
Then, what are we doing about it?

00:59:56.644 --> 00:59:58.644
Normal life you do see that way,

00:59:58.644 --> 01:00:01.936
like if somebody is selected for a post or something,

01:00:02.062 --> 01:00:04.645
out of many, many things, "Oh must be something about me,

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:07.604
I must show my worth, I must show my value,

01:00:07.644 --> 01:00:09.644
I must show my work," you see,

01:00:09.644 --> 01:00:16.437
and he works hard to prove that the selection was good.

01:00:16.562 --> 01:00:19.479
But in Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

01:00:19.604 --> 01:00:21.686
you take it for granted,

01:00:21.811 --> 01:00:24.228
"Oh, we are something great."

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:31.228
So now settle down with yourself - have a cup of tea.

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:39.187
I hope it has been understood why I am saying so,

01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:42.395
because I am really concerned about America.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.644
So many negative forces are working here

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:49.644
and we have to improve.

01:00:50.728 --> 01:00:53.853
So many things such a big responsibility,

01:00:53.978 --> 01:00:56.811
such a big country, such a vast country,

01:00:56.936 --> 01:01:05.228
so much perversion, so much nonsensical ideologies,

01:01:05.354 --> 01:01:08.562
I mean endless.

01:01:08.644 --> 01:01:14.479
Even if you get fifteen Gorbachevs, you cannot change this country.

01:01:15.312 --> 01:01:17.978
It has gone amuck.

01:01:18.103 --> 01:01:20.644
Everybody's an individual,

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:23.145
this mad place.

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:26.312
One Gorbachev can change that country

01:01:26.437 --> 01:01:28.811
which has much more population.

01:01:28.936 --> 01:01:30.853
But no one can change this country

01:01:30.978 --> 01:01:36.103
unless and until you people decide to do something about it.

01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:40.228
So I'm told some people are frustrated

01:01:40.354 --> 01:01:42.978
because there are not so many Sahaja Yogis are coming,

01:01:43.103 --> 01:01:45.437
but may be something wrong with you.

01:01:45.562 --> 01:01:47.145
Maybe that you are not deep enough

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:52.520
and that you are not so much impressive.

01:01:54.728 --> 01:01:57.062
You have to change your life style,

01:01:57.187 --> 01:02:04.978
you have to be smart people and spartan.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:11.645
I hope, I hope again and again that after this Virata's Puja

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:15.811
you all will come up on the stage as great Viratas.

01:02:15.978 --> 01:02:17.644
May God bless you all.
