WEBVTT

07:03.023 --> 07:06.063
Today we have decided

07:06.073 --> 07:10.908
to have a puja of Virata

07:13.073 --> 07:16.157
in the land of Shri Krishna.

07:17.532 --> 07:24.991
As you know, in the growth of Shri Vishnu's manifestation,

07:25.073 --> 07:30.407
He comes into ten incarnations

07:31.073 --> 07:37.199
and ultimately He manifests Himself as Virat.

07:37.657 --> 07:54.741
Virat is the brain of the being which can call as God Almighty,

07:54.866 --> 07:59.073
so the whole central nervous system is worked through

07:59.083 --> 08:04.583
by Shri Krishna as Vishnu,

08:05.093 --> 08:08.302
then all this incarnations,

08:08.437 --> 08:14.062
then Shri Krishna and ultimately as Virat.

08:14.354 --> 08:18.770
This is the development of our brain

08:19.562 --> 08:23.354
and when we are worshipping Virat,

08:23.479 --> 08:28.644
we have to know that within us also we have got

08:28.644 --> 08:34.644
the manifestation of this power of Virat.

08:34.644 --> 08:38.644
That manifestation which we have

08:38.644 --> 08:46.644
we can call it as Virat if Shri Krishna is Mahavirata.

08:46.686 --> 08:49.062
You all know about Virat

08:49.187 --> 08:52.686
much more than I can tell you today

08:52.811 --> 08:57.770
because It's the whole,

08:57.936 --> 09:00.853
It's the totality.

09:02.103 --> 09:09.437
And the totality of everything, if that is Virat,

09:09.562 --> 09:12.644
then that is in your brain,

09:12.644 --> 09:18.644
but reality is in your heart.

09:18.686 --> 09:22.853
So the totality you may see,

09:22.978 --> 09:25.062
you may witness,

09:25.312 --> 09:30.644
the reality is the subtlety behind it.

09:30.644 --> 09:34.395
So the brain which is not ruled by the heart,

09:34.520 --> 09:37.103
which is not nourished by the heart,

09:37.228 --> 09:39.644
is a very dangerous thing,

09:39.644 --> 09:43.062
because it creates extroversion,

09:43.187 --> 09:48.604
and such a person who is without any heart

09:48.644 --> 09:54.562
tries to do things, becomes very ruthless

09:54.644 --> 09:57.103
and can be very dangerous.

09:57.228 --> 10:01.479
It could the other way also within us;

10:01.604 --> 10:05.187
that if we allow our heart to rule us,

10:05.479 --> 10:07.644
only live with our emotions

10:07.644 --> 10:09.936
and not to use our rationality,

10:10.062 --> 10:15.811
then we can become really very dangerous people to ourselves.

10:15.936 --> 10:19.145
In the sense, we become lethargic,

10:19.270 --> 10:24.604
we become indulgent into wrong sort of things.

10:24.644 --> 10:28.312
And today what one feels that in America

10:28.437 --> 10:29.895
there's more dominance

10:29.936 --> 10:34.020
of the left side than of the right.

10:35.604 --> 10:38.228
Right side is our attention

10:38.644 --> 10:41.644
and the right side of attention is we can say

10:41.644 --> 10:45.645
is the liver of God Almighty.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.562
So now when we have to talk of the totality,

10:48.644 --> 10:50.895
when we are part and parcel of the totality

10:51.020 --> 10:56.145
and now we are awakened to that existence of ours

10:56.270 --> 10:59.644
as the part and parcel of the whole,

10:59.644 --> 11:01.853
then we have to realize to become the whole

11:01.978 --> 11:04.395
we have to do something about it.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.103
Specially in the land of Shri Krishna

11:07.228 --> 11:10.312
we have to work out this tremendous task

11:10.437 --> 11:14.853
of creating Viratas out of Sahaja Yogis.

11:16.187 --> 11:20.644
After going through the various experiences

11:20.686 --> 11:23.853
of American Sahaja Yoga,

11:23.978 --> 11:25.686
I've reached a conclusion

11:25.936 --> 11:29.354
that we have to talk more frankly about things

11:29.479 --> 11:31.644
than we have been talking before.

11:31.644 --> 11:36.145
Why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country

11:36.270 --> 11:40.644
while there are so many seekers.

11:41.644 --> 11:47.312
The main point is that we do not realize

11:47.437 --> 11:53.936
that the left side is overpowering this country very much.

11:54.644 --> 11:59.936
There are people who are active,

12:01.644 --> 12:06.395
but the percentage is very low

12:06.520 --> 12:08.728
because of too much of affluence,

12:08.853 --> 12:11.437
too much of freedom,

12:11.562 --> 12:16.437
the idea of "what's wrong in anything."

12:16.562 --> 12:20.728
People are going towards shamelessness,

12:20.853 --> 12:26.312
immoral life, self-indulgent.

12:26.437 --> 12:30.520
And this self-indulgence, to protect that,

12:30.604 --> 12:34.644
people always develop a kind of a ego

12:34.644 --> 12:39.562
which has no dynamism in it.

12:41.270 --> 12:45.644
So now the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis,

12:45.811 --> 12:48.103
not with Sahaja Yoga as such.

12:48.228 --> 12:51.644
When you see that the land is not so fertile

12:51.728 --> 12:54.644
and here you have to work very hard,

12:54.644 --> 12:57.936
the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis in America

12:58.062 --> 13:00.270
is to go deep.

13:00.562 --> 13:05.395
You can see wherever the land is not fertile

13:05.520 --> 13:08.312
the trees go very deep down,

13:08.437 --> 13:14.645
they dig very deep into the Mother Earth

13:14.770 --> 13:18.644
for the sap to be sucked in.

13:18.686 --> 13:22.604
And the same way they grow very high,

13:22.644 --> 13:28.728
because the strength of their deepening

13:28.853 --> 13:31.312
gives them this great height.

13:31.437 --> 13:33.354
So they grow very tall

13:33.479 --> 13:35.479
and also they are very deep.

13:35.604 --> 13:38.811
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America

13:38.936 --> 13:40.354
have to work out

13:40.479 --> 13:43.103
because here it's so much superficiality

13:43.228 --> 13:45.354
and so much of frivolousness

13:45.479 --> 13:49.853
and also no meaning to their lives.

13:49.978 --> 13:51.936
They have no meanings at all

13:52.020 --> 13:55.686
and they are just frittering away their lives

13:55.811 --> 13:58.644
with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions

13:58.644 --> 14:01.187
and their love and all those things.

14:01.312 --> 14:05.562
So what we need today are Sahaja Yogis who are right-sided,

14:05.644 --> 14:08.644
those who will produce results,

14:08.644 --> 14:10.644
those who will be dynamic.

14:10.644 --> 14:14.145
They don't have to worry that somebody is right-sided

14:14.270 --> 14:15.895
and he'll become right-sided,

14:16.020 --> 14:18.187
actually that is what is needed today.

14:18.312 --> 14:21.644
Unless and until you have people who are dynamic

14:21.644 --> 14:23.728
we cannot work it out.

14:23.853 --> 14:26.686
It's a reaction in this country as well as in England,

14:26.811 --> 14:29.644
in many countries who dominated other people.

14:29.644 --> 14:32.437
Like you see in this place

14:32.562 --> 14:35.437
which was actually originally belonged

14:35.562 --> 14:42.145
to some tribes of Indians

14:42.270 --> 14:46.644
and the English, the Spanish and all these Europeans came,

14:46.644 --> 14:48.644
killed them and occupied here.

14:48.644 --> 14:50.062
It's a highway robbery,

14:50.187 --> 14:51.686
absolutely highway robbery.

14:51.811 --> 14:58.062
Because of their arrogance and their aggressiveness,

14:58.187 --> 15:01.103
they could not see that they were doing such a horrible thing.

15:01.228 --> 15:04.437
I mean, why call any names of Hitler,

15:04.562 --> 15:06.644
they're even worse than Hitler,

15:06.644 --> 15:09.062
because at least Hitler was taken to task,

15:09.187 --> 15:12.644
he was condemned and people know that it was a mistake.

15:12.728 --> 15:15.562
But what about those who came all the way from there

15:15.644 --> 15:18.437
and killed so many people here

15:18.562 --> 15:22.103
and nicely having a very nice time everywhere

15:22.228 --> 15:23.644
as great Americans

15:23.644 --> 15:27.644
and now they are trying to show off everywhere.

15:27.978 --> 15:30.686
Actually it's such a sinful thing that is done

15:30.811 --> 15:33.644
that all these souls which have died

15:33.728 --> 15:35.644
I think have possessed them

15:35.728 --> 15:40.145
and now today America is on the left hand side.

15:40.270 --> 15:44.853
The right hand side of Americans is finished now,

15:44.978 --> 15:48.479
they are on the left hand side, guilty,

15:48.604 --> 15:51.479
feeling guilty they are taking to indulgences.

15:51.604 --> 15:53.644
Once you go to the right side, you see,

15:53.644 --> 15:54.936
you are very disciplined

15:55.062 --> 16:00.187
and you become very ascetic by temperament,

16:00.312 --> 16:04.936
I should say, and you want to dominate others

16:05.062 --> 16:06.728
and you want to capture.

16:06.853 --> 16:11.644
But today the situation of England and America is just the same.

16:11.644 --> 16:14.644
In England the same thing I find with Sahaja Yogis

16:14.644 --> 16:16.645
they are just lovey-dovey types, you see,

16:16.770 --> 16:22.479
and all they love Me and love Me and love Me.

16:22.644 --> 16:25.312
And I just don't understand.

16:25.437 --> 16:26.644
What's this going on?

16:26.644 --> 16:28.354
They all love Me

16:28.479 --> 16:30.644
and they'll bring flowers for Me, finished.

16:30.644 --> 16:32.978
Is this the way we are going to work our Sahaja Yoga

16:33.103 --> 16:36.644
in that England and in this America?

16:36.686 --> 16:41.312
"Mother, I love you very much." So what?

16:43.811 --> 16:48.354
So to become one part and parcel of the whole,

16:48.479 --> 16:51.437
a drop has to become the ocean,

16:51.562 --> 16:53.853
you have to become great people,

16:53.978 --> 16:57.228
you have to be responsible.

16:57.354 --> 16:59.978
And this lovey-dovey business that you have

17:00.103 --> 17:02.479
has to go out of your mind completely,

17:02.604 --> 17:05.895
otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries

17:06.020 --> 17:10.644
and you'll be cursed one after another.

17:11.354 --> 17:13.062
There are shocks after shocks

17:13.187 --> 17:17.562
that are coming to this country as well as to England.

17:17.644 --> 17:20.645
But people are not learning any lessons from that,

17:20.770 --> 17:23.479
still it is all right;

17:23.604 --> 17:25.936
we get this disease, all right;

17:26.062 --> 17:27.644
then we glorify it.

17:27.853 --> 17:32.062
If we are suffering from ecological difference,

17:32.187 --> 17:33.644
still we are glorified.

17:33.644 --> 17:36.312
If you are using too much of machinery out of balance,

17:36.562 --> 17:37.978
still we are glorified.

17:38.103 --> 17:42.228
Because they just want self-indulgence.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.354
Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point

17:45.479 --> 17:49.187
that what is going wrong with this country is that,

17:49.312 --> 17:54.520
that they do not see anything that is reality.

17:54.644 --> 17:57.312
And the reality, though it is in the heart,

17:57.437 --> 17:59.312
though it works in the heart, it has to act.

17:59.437 --> 18:05.978
This has to act and if it does not act,

18:09.270 --> 18:11.644
this kind of a passive behavior

18:11.770 --> 18:13.228
is not going to help you.

18:13.354 --> 18:14.895
Now at this old age of Mine

18:15.020 --> 18:17.728
I'm traveling from places to places

18:17.853 --> 18:19.645
and I'm doing so much.

18:19.770 --> 18:25.978
Now let us think about it: what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

18:26.644 --> 18:29.103
Those who see you,

18:29.228 --> 18:34.728
see you as sometimes as just some hippies with disheveled hairs

18:34.853 --> 18:37.644
and something that kind of a thing.

18:37.728 --> 18:39.644
This is the report I have,

18:39.644 --> 18:42.354
from people who came to your centers and things like that.

18:42.479 --> 18:44.978
"Oh, they are a set of hippies, you see," just like that.

18:45.103 --> 18:47.395
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do,

18:47.520 --> 18:49.936
has to make up something of his personality,

18:50.062 --> 18:53.187
in America is very important.

18:53.770 --> 18:56.644
They are studying, they are out of job,

18:56.936 --> 18:58.644
they are doing this, that.

18:58.936 --> 19:02.145
That sort of people are not going to help Sahaja Yoga at all,

19:02.270 --> 19:04.145
they'll be liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

19:04.270 --> 19:08.020
If you really want to do something you have to become something.

19:08.270 --> 19:10.312
You have to study, you have to become something,

19:10.437 --> 19:14.437
you have to have some sort of a degree, diploma, something

19:14.562 --> 19:17.228
attached to you, you have to mean something.

19:17.354 --> 19:20.686
Hippies cannot run Sahaja Yoga in America;

19:20.811 --> 19:28.145
they may run better in India but not here.

19:28.270 --> 19:30.644
So one has to realize that

19:30.686 --> 19:32.644
what has gone wrong with us is that

19:32.686 --> 19:36.895
we are now following a very subtle way

19:37.020 --> 19:42.395
of the same trends that we have taken.

19:42.520 --> 20:01.604
After Realization, we think that we are realized souls,

20:01.644 --> 20:03.644
that we have become yogis now,

20:03.686 --> 20:07.354
that we are realized souls.

20:07.728 --> 20:11.062
But one should see

20:11.312 --> 20:13.728
that we have become realized souls, no doubt,

20:13.853 --> 20:19.644
but whatever bindings we had before coming to Sahaja Yoga

20:19.644 --> 20:23.728
have become subtler.

20:25.644 --> 20:34.145
They have not expressed themselves as lights,

20:34.270 --> 20:38.936
just we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis.

20:39.644 --> 20:43.354
We believe that we have vibrations

20:43.853 --> 20:47.354
and also we can feel the vibrations.

20:47.479 --> 20:50.686
But still we have not reached that state

20:50.811 --> 20:55.978
where we have become the totality.

20:56.103 --> 20:59.312
We have to still grow.

20:59.437 --> 21:02.562
And if you are settled down with your vibrations

21:02.644 --> 21:04.728
and thinking that you are all right,

21:04.853 --> 21:07.479
you are sadly mistaken.

21:07.604 --> 21:11.728
Whatever were our conditionings before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

21:11.853 --> 21:15.728
say you were a hippie,

21:15.853 --> 21:18.686
so the enlightenment has come,

21:18.811 --> 21:23.644
but then the idea of this love business is there.

21:23.728 --> 21:26.604
Supposing you were a business man,

21:26.644 --> 21:28.811
so the enlightenment has come to you

21:28.936 --> 21:32.853
and you think that Mother should help you in your business,

21:32.978 --> 21:34.686
that's what it is.

21:34.811 --> 21:37.644
Supposing now if you were unmarried

21:37.728 --> 21:39.437
and you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

21:39.562 --> 21:42.562
then you want that your marriage should be successful

21:42.644 --> 21:44.686
in Sahaja Yoga.

21:44.811 --> 21:51.644
If there has been a problem in your health or something like that,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.936
then you have become a subtler person that you think,

21:55.062 --> 21:59.936
"I asked help from Mother for that."

22:00.228 --> 22:06.354
But we do not think that what have we contributed to Sahaja Yoga.

22:07.644 --> 22:11.520
We had certain things

22:13.312 --> 22:16.978
which we thought were wrong - maybe that,

22:17.103 --> 22:17.479
but in Sahaja Yoga we do not see those things are with us,

22:17.686 --> 22:23.187
still continuing with us.

22:23.312 --> 22:27.644
To become Virata we have to really examine ourselves,

22:27.644 --> 22:32.145
without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.

22:32.270 --> 22:35.645
I know people who are small-minded,

22:35.770 --> 22:40.936
who have jealousies and their jealousies continue.

22:41.062 --> 22:44.354
Supposing there's a good musician,

22:44.479 --> 22:48.811
they'll not appreciate if the other person is a musician,

22:49.644 --> 22:51.145
he will not appreciate,

22:51.270 --> 22:54.395
he will not encourage that person that,

22:54.520 --> 22:59.187
"Really I am a musician, he's also a musician, let me help him."

23:00.686 --> 23:05.437
So the small-mindedness that existed before

23:05.562 --> 23:08.644
still becomes in a glorified way.

23:08.728 --> 23:10.644
The person will think that

23:10.644 --> 23:13.728
"All right, I am a musician and I sing very well

23:13.853 --> 23:16.644
and I am singing Mother's praise."

23:16.644 --> 23:19.103
But anybody else who's singing

23:20.644 --> 23:23.354
will not be appreciated

23:23.479 --> 23:26.187
to that extent as you should expect

23:26.312 --> 23:32.270
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

23:33.562 --> 23:35.644
This hand, if it feels hurt,

23:35.644 --> 23:40.811
the another hand immediately helps it.

23:44.644 --> 23:49.978
In the whole body you see the system is so totally connected.

23:50.103 --> 23:56.103
As soon as you eat food, the digestive system starts working.

23:56.228 --> 23:58.562
But we should watch ourselves.

23:58.644 --> 23:59.811
If you have to become deeper,

23:59.936 --> 24:02.728
we have to watch ourselves where are we lacking.

24:02.853 --> 24:04.644
Now how does a tree grow?

24:04.644 --> 24:05.978
I have told you many times the story

24:06.103 --> 24:08.936
that there's a little cell at the end of the root

24:09.062 --> 24:11.103
and it knows,

24:11.228 --> 24:15.187
and it knows one purpose: that it has to become a tree,

24:15.312 --> 24:16.645
so it goes round.

24:16.770 --> 24:20.228
It sees a boulder or something, stone, goes round it,

24:20.354 --> 24:21.728
doesn't fight it.

24:21.853 --> 24:25.728
Because ultimately what we have to achieve

24:26.187 --> 24:28.728
is to become the tree,

24:28.853 --> 24:31.770
so we have to keep that in view,

24:32.020 --> 24:34.686
that we have to become the tree

24:34.936 --> 24:38.562
and not some sort of a small little frog here and there

24:38.644 --> 24:41.062
croaking about Sahaja Yoga.

24:41.479 --> 24:45.270
No, that's not going to work out!

24:45.644 --> 24:47.644
And this is what I find

24:47.686 --> 24:53.728
also very true about people in, say, England, same thing.

24:53.853 --> 24:55.062
The leaders are fighting,

24:55.187 --> 24:58.145
the leaders are trying to find out ways and methods

24:58.270 --> 25:00.936
how to improve the quality of Sahaja Yogis,

25:01.062 --> 25:02.479
but it's the Sahaja Yogis

25:02.604 --> 25:05.228
who have to know that the responsibility is theirs.

25:05.354 --> 25:11.895
They have to grow, they have to become Viratas.

25:12.020 --> 25:13.644
And this is America

25:13.644 --> 25:16.644
where I told you is the place of Shri Krishna,

25:16.644 --> 25:19.686
where Shri Krishna became the Virat.

25:21.270 --> 25:27.728
Unless and until you see for yourself

25:27.853 --> 25:33.062
that we have to do this, we have to become this,

25:33.187 --> 25:37.686
you are still busy with our little, little silly problems.

25:37.936 --> 25:39.562
It's a vicious circle,

25:39.644 --> 25:42.644
as soon as you start worrying about your silly problems

25:42.644 --> 25:48.062
and your old stuffs still becoming glorified in Sahaja Yoga,

25:48.520 --> 25:54.354
then you find the vicious circle starts working,

25:54.728 --> 25:58.437
it doesn't achieve anything,

25:58.562 --> 26:00.728
it doesn't give you good chances,

26:00.853 --> 26:05.187
it doesn't give you confidence.

26:05.312 --> 26:10.354
It's such a thing, it's like a packaging as they call it.

26:10.479 --> 26:15.062
But as soon as you decide, "No, I am going to do it,"

26:15.187 --> 26:17.103
you people are Sahaja Yogis,

26:17.228 --> 26:20.228
you know all about Kundalini,

26:20.354 --> 26:22.644
you know all about awakening,

26:22.686 --> 26:28.103
you know all about higher stages of attainment,

26:28.228 --> 26:33.644
you all, everyone is capable of giving Realization to people.

26:33.644 --> 26:36.644
You know where the thing is stuck,

26:36.728 --> 26:42.644
everything you know, but now just think about it,

26:42.686 --> 26:50.936
how many of you have been able to do something about it?

26:51.062 --> 26:56.895
When people see you their idea about you is very poor.

26:57.020 --> 27:01.686
They think that you are stuck up with your wives,

27:01.811 --> 27:04.312
so the wife is very dominating,

27:04.437 --> 27:06.395
so this is happening.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.145
Suddenly you go off,

27:08.270 --> 27:10.895
you see your child, worried about this one, you ...

27:11.020 --> 27:14.686
Sometimes I am surprised that once they are married,

27:14.811 --> 27:16.644
they have a child,

27:16.644 --> 27:20.853
then they become nothing but the parents of the child, finished,

27:20.978 --> 27:23.062
Sahaja Yoga is finished.

27:23.187 --> 27:25.644
Then the child becomes important.

27:25.728 --> 27:32.187
The blessings become the bindings.

27:32.644 --> 27:36.728
So you have to watch within yourself

27:36.853 --> 27:41.020
that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.

27:41.437 --> 27:43.062
But in the subtle way

27:43.187 --> 27:45.728
all these things go on binding

27:45.853 --> 27:47.811
you and you are attached to it

27:47.936 --> 27:51.644
and you don't know how they are still tagging you down,

27:51.686 --> 27:53.437
don't allow you to fly,

27:53.562 --> 27:54.936
they don't give you the freedom

27:55.062 --> 27:59.728
that is your own right to have it.

27:59.853 --> 28:02.644
So even if I make a aeroplane,

28:02.644 --> 28:05.103
I do everything, put the fuel into it,

28:05.228 --> 28:10.811
I say everything, but doesn't want to fly.

28:10.936 --> 28:13.437
Now what do you do with such an aeroplane

28:13.562 --> 28:16.354
which doesn't want to fly?

28:16.479 --> 28:19.479
This sort of a situation is there

28:19.644 --> 28:22.853
and this situation makes you so limited

28:23.187 --> 28:27.644
and so dwarfy. How will you grow?

28:27.644 --> 28:31.978
Unless and until you grow and you show that

28:32.103 --> 28:33.644
in your day to day life

28:33.644 --> 28:36.437
into your personality, into everything,

28:36.562 --> 28:39.895
I assure you nobody is going to be impressed by you.

28:40.020 --> 28:44.811
Sahaja Yoga is not going to work by advertisement,

28:44.936 --> 28:47.479
nor by My photographs,

28:47.604 --> 28:51.936
it's going to work by your work, by your responsibility,

28:52.062 --> 28:54.479
by your shouldering Sahaja Yoga,

28:54.604 --> 28:59.437
it's your responsibility to spread Sahaja Yoga and to establish it.

28:59.562 --> 29:02.728
But first of all your shoulders should be strong.

29:02.853 --> 29:05.103
You are still out of job,

29:05.228 --> 29:08.354
you are still something, somebody hanging in the air,

29:08.479 --> 29:12.604
you are still somebody who'll not even look at you.

29:12.644 --> 29:17.103
Then how can you carry on your shoulders?

29:18.936 --> 29:23.437
So first thing is to build yourself inside

29:23.562 --> 29:25.479
as well as outside,

29:25.604 --> 29:27.354
but such a vicious circle I tell you.

29:27.479 --> 29:29.644
If you do not go deep into yourself,

29:29.644 --> 29:32.437
you cannot also get the outside thing,

29:32.562 --> 29:33.978
so it works hand in hand,

29:34.103 --> 29:36.644
as soon as you start building yourself inside,

29:36.728 --> 29:39.686
you'll be amazed how things will work out,

29:39.811 --> 29:43.479
how you'll become dynamic, how you'll become great.

29:43.604 --> 29:45.062
But you get involved into things

29:45.187 --> 29:48.811
which are very small and transitory.

29:48.936 --> 29:53.187
So as I told you before, we are seeking the eternal.

29:53.312 --> 29:55.853
So the transitory things are to be only used

29:55.978 --> 30:01.020
very temporarily, what we need is not so important.

30:01.354 --> 30:04.936
If you can understand this thing clearly,

30:05.062 --> 30:11.062
that we still are not free, not detached

30:11.187 --> 30:16.644
from all the things we had before Sahaja Yoga

30:16.728 --> 30:19.811
and they have become subtler and subtler and subtler.

30:19.936 --> 30:25.145
We are still only using Sahaja Yoga for that purpose

30:25.270 --> 30:31.187
and not for spreading the light.

30:34.354 --> 30:40.062
So what's going to happen?

30:41.520 --> 30:44.145
This is absolutely,

30:44.270 --> 30:49.811
absolutely to be really to be understood within yourself.

30:49.936 --> 30:54.062
Sometimes My lectures, you see, are little harsh,

30:54.187 --> 30:58.062
people think that Mother had to say these things,

30:58.187 --> 31:01.145
this is also out of My love for you

31:01.395 --> 31:05.978
and out of My love for this country.

31:06.770 --> 31:09.644
You have to really see to yourself,

31:09.728 --> 31:17.644
"What are we? Where are we?"

31:18.686 --> 31:24.811
We are not going to end up because Sahaja Yogis we had

31:24.936 --> 31:33.270
were subnormal people in the society.

31:33.644 --> 31:36.644
If you see the gurus how they spread themselves,

31:36.644 --> 31:38.978
though they are false, they are useless

31:39.103 --> 31:42.811
but everybody knows about somebody who comes up. In two months time

31:42.936 --> 31:46.562
all over the world you can hear about that person.

31:46.644 --> 31:47.644
What they do,

31:47.686 --> 31:51.187
they go and first of all see the people who are successful,

31:51.312 --> 31:53.978
who are prominent in the city.

31:54.103 --> 31:57.062
They never bother about people who are drug addicts,

31:57.312 --> 32:00.479
or who are suffering from diseases, no nothing doing,

32:00.604 --> 32:03.936
they have no business with them.

32:04.062 --> 32:06.437
They'll just attack the people

32:06.562 --> 32:10.437
who are very successful, who are very rich,

32:11.103 --> 32:13.936
because they are on top of the society,

32:14.062 --> 32:15.811
so they'll go and meet people

32:16.103 --> 32:18.936
and make contacts with them and ask them and this and that

32:19.062 --> 32:21.644
and then they call them for the program,

32:21.686 --> 32:23.644
give them all the importance, everything,

32:23.644 --> 32:24.853
then people start thinking,

32:24.978 --> 32:28.312
"Oh God! What a great thing it is to be here."

32:28.437 --> 32:32.354
Then pamper their ego a little bit, this and that's how they spread.

32:32.479 --> 32:35.312
But there's no reality in it, there's nothing,

32:35.562 --> 32:36.644
nothing special about it,

32:36.686 --> 32:39.978
it's all useless, it's all artificial.

32:40.103 --> 32:42.644
But that is how they sell themselves.

32:42.644 --> 32:44.604
Though we do not want to sell ourselves,

32:44.644 --> 32:46.103
we have to know that

32:46.228 --> 32:50.644
unless and until we have some remarkable qualities,

32:50.853 --> 32:53.644
people are not going to look at us,

32:53.644 --> 32:56.270
because whatever has happened is within ourselves,

32:56.520 --> 32:58.686
and nobody sees the light,

32:58.811 --> 33:04.644
it's like a light which is burning, which is covered completely.

33:06.354 --> 33:08.062
So I've seen that

33:08.187 --> 33:11.644
I went to Columbia. In Columbia, you'll be amazed

33:11.686 --> 33:13.853
that people had never known Me,

33:14.103 --> 33:15.644
they had never heard My name,

33:15.728 --> 33:18.728
but I don't know why but

33:18.853 --> 33:23.270
the crowds were so much that I couldn't enter into the compound

33:23.520 --> 33:26.312
and with somehow or other I was pushed into it.

33:26.562 --> 33:28.770
Then in the hall was impossible,

33:29.020 --> 33:31.644
people were hanging on the â€“

33:31.728 --> 33:33.437
I thought they were hanging

33:33.644 --> 33:35.562
from the top, just sitting on the thing to watch Me over.

33:35.644 --> 33:38.644
So many people in every direction, in every height

33:38.728 --> 33:42.978
I found people there, I did not know how to settle them down.

33:43.103 --> 33:45.479
But they listened to Me very carefully this thing,

33:45.604 --> 33:49.062
two days we had the programmed, two days the crowds were there.

33:49.187 --> 33:52.604
And then when they had to follow-on they came,

33:52.644 --> 33:55.728
next day they disappeared.

33:55.853 --> 33:57.437
Same thing in Greece,

33:57.562 --> 33:59.644
same thing in Turkey.

34:00.562 --> 34:07.312
So there's definitely something wrong with us.

34:07.644 --> 34:09.936
Now there's a course coming up,

34:10.062 --> 34:11.853
people are trying to do the course business,

34:11.978 --> 34:17.187
but one should know it is not knowledge without love,

34:17.312 --> 34:18.978
it is love and knowledge.

34:19.103 --> 34:20.644
So how you talk to them,

34:20.811 --> 34:23.770
how you deal with them is there,

34:24.020 --> 34:27.270
but your dynamism is going to impress them.

34:27.811 --> 34:29.936
You can see the film we saw yesterday

34:30.228 --> 34:33.103
in which the music was there. Now what was it?

34:33.354 --> 34:35.644
There the energy was dynamic,

34:36.644 --> 34:39.811
the energy was dynamic, with the music and everything

34:40.062 --> 34:41.312
and that was showing.

34:41.437 --> 34:43.811
So you see you got engrossed into it,

34:44.062 --> 34:46.770
so the movement of that energy, the dynamism of that energy

34:47.187 --> 34:49.644
really got you engrossed.

34:51.644 --> 34:55.644
But to be afraid that you'll become right-sided is nonsensical,

34:55.644 --> 35:03.020
now you are in the center, how can you become right-sided?

35:06.562 --> 35:12.395
This kind of argument is only to support lethargy,

35:12.520 --> 35:15.062
then not to have any discipline.

35:15.354 --> 35:18.062
I was surprised that in Shudy Camp,

35:18.312 --> 35:22.811
where we have established a school for meditation,

35:23.103 --> 35:25.645
people come every week-end just to spend the week-end,

35:25.770 --> 35:29.103
they get up at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

35:29.228 --> 35:30.686
whenever they feel like,

35:30.811 --> 35:33.644
they are on holidays in Shudy Camp.

35:33.936 --> 35:38.604
And two days they'll stay there without any meditation,

35:38.644 --> 35:40.103
without anything.

35:40.228 --> 35:41.811
We have come to Mother's house, finished.

35:41.936 --> 35:46.354
Mother has to do all the job for them.

35:47.062 --> 35:50.312
I mean, for a Sahaja Yogi it is minimum of minimum

35:50.437 --> 35:52.062
that they should get up early in the morning,

35:52.312 --> 35:54.686
have their bath and sit down for pujas.

35:54.811 --> 35:58.686
Is a common thing, all Indians do that way,

35:59.187 --> 36:01.062
It's a practice.

36:01.187 --> 36:03.103
Suddenly this country

36:03.354 --> 36:06.936
or these countries have gone into a kind of a lethargic

36:07.062 --> 36:08.145
nonsensical life,

36:08.270 --> 36:12.604
otherwise this country also used to do the same thing.

36:13.228 --> 36:18.978
And sleeping also: you have to sleep early if you want to,

36:19.103 --> 36:24.644
but one has to think that we have to change our lifestyle,

36:24.686 --> 36:27.644
we have to change our attitudes,

36:27.686 --> 36:32.228
so many things, see, like I said simple things, like I said,

36:32.354 --> 36:34.604
"The day you want to wash your hair,

36:34.644 --> 36:39.312
put lot of oil in your hair and then wash. We'll become bald."

36:39.437 --> 36:44.644
Imagine all bald Sahaja Yogis walking.

36:44.644 --> 36:50.644
They'll think your Mother has so many hair and what about your hair.

36:52.686 --> 36:56.312
In food also, too much, like

36:56.437 --> 36:59.270
I don't know here what is the situation, but in England I find

36:59.520 --> 37:01.644
they take so much of tea,

37:01.686 --> 37:05.644
all the time the tea is - the kettle is on the thing.

37:05.686 --> 37:08.354
I mean people are amazed

37:08.479 --> 37:11.728
when they, people come to Ganapatipule also in India,

37:11.853 --> 37:14.644
we don't take tea so many times,

37:14.686 --> 37:16.644
I mean twice at the most.

37:16.644 --> 37:18.644
The whole day people want tea there,

37:18.644 --> 37:19.811
they don't understand

37:19.936 --> 37:25.604
how can they go on drinking tea at one o'clock in the night.

37:25.936 --> 37:35.811
It's like the alcohol has become subtler: tea ,

37:35.936 --> 37:39.644
otherwise how do you explain?

37:39.644 --> 37:42.644
You can't take alcohol, so let's have tea,

37:42.644 --> 37:45.853
then settle down nicely, we are having cup-o-tea,

37:45.978 --> 37:47.644
in England very common:

37:47.644 --> 37:50.978
sit down nicely, cup-o-tea.

37:51.103 --> 37:56.604
What work have you done that you are settling down like that?

37:56.644 --> 38:01.437
Then whenever they'll come, "Haaa,"

38:01.562 --> 38:03.728
as if they have dug up something,

38:03.853 --> 38:08.978
or they have done the English Channel,

38:09.103 --> 38:11.644
they'll come, even on the television you'll see people,

38:11.644 --> 38:15.145
they come down, "Haa."

38:15.270 --> 38:17.103
I don't understand.

38:18.020 --> 38:20.145
You'll never find any Indian doing that,

38:20.270 --> 38:23.312
after all in that heat also, he'll never say that,

38:23.437 --> 38:26.728
because you think, think, think too much, just think,

38:26.853 --> 38:30.062
don't do anything about it.

38:30.770 --> 38:33.644
Like you file, you see, make a file,

38:33.644 --> 38:35.562
tomorrow is Mother's puja, all right,

38:35.644 --> 38:37.644
we'll have this, this, this - filed it.

38:37.728 --> 38:42.520
At the puja it is not there, why? It's in the file.

38:45.811 --> 38:54.644
And anything that is before your Realization,

38:54.644 --> 39:00.062
like people have an idea,

38:58.604 --> 39:04.644
Labor saving is a very great asset of the Western people.

39:00.187 --> 39:00.187
like this how to avoid work, you see, labor saving.

39:04.686 --> 39:06.312
So the labor saving how they will do.

39:06.437 --> 39:08.644
Supposing, you say, "Please, telephone to such a person."

39:08.728 --> 39:11.103
"Mother, I think he may not be there."

39:11.228 --> 39:14.811
"Baba, you telephone and find out."

39:15.562 --> 39:18.644
So the explanation comes from the brain,

39:18.644 --> 39:23.145
it may not. So nothing can be achieved.

39:23.270 --> 39:25.644
So first the labor saving was that

39:25.644 --> 39:29.895
"Oh, this is anti-culture, we should be â€“

39:30.020 --> 39:32.145
this is so bad, everything is so bad,

39:32.270 --> 39:34.895
we should start a very natural life,

39:35.020 --> 39:37.853
we should lead a very natural thing and that

39:37.978 --> 39:41.604
we should become primitive," and all that.

39:42.437 --> 39:47.644
From that if you grow in - from that area if you grow into Sahaja Yoga,

39:47.728 --> 39:49.936
you become subtler.

39:50.853 --> 39:55.187
So the subtler things that they become is this way:

39:55.312 --> 39:59.644
that now as it is, you see,

40:00.479 --> 40:05.145
"We should not do too much of everything, is too much, you see,

40:05.270 --> 40:07.270
it is too much."

40:08.187 --> 40:11.228
If you talk to somebody about Sahaja Yoga, they say,

40:11.644 --> 40:13.644
"It's too much for me."

40:13.644 --> 40:15.853
Hey, you have no brain or what is it?

40:15.978 --> 40:19.437
What is too much? Can't take it?

40:19.562 --> 40:21.645
"Oh it's too much."

40:21.770 --> 40:25.312
It's a very common experience with Me,

40:25.437 --> 40:28.728
that when I talk to people they would say, "It's too much."

40:28.853 --> 40:32.312
I mean your brain, is it a limited brain

40:32.437 --> 40:37.728
or what is it that you can't listen to Me what I am trying to tell you?

40:37.853 --> 40:42.187
And once you start developing this kind of attitude,

40:42.604 --> 40:44.312
the nourishment cannot reach you,

40:44.437 --> 40:47.644
supposing the trees say, "Oh it's too much,"

40:47.936 --> 40:51.728
then what are they going to do?

40:53.728 --> 40:56.312
Nothing is too much.

40:56.437 --> 40:59.312
"I have to grow, I have to take all the nourishment,

40:59.437 --> 41:02.479
I have to become something,

41:02.604 --> 41:05.644
I have to do such a lot.

41:05.644 --> 41:06.644
What have I done?"

41:06.686 --> 41:12.187
Nothing so far. Never be satisfied with yourself.

41:12.312 --> 41:15.187
I mean, some people who saw My program

41:15.312 --> 41:18.103
they were all shocked how Mother is going to do it.

41:18.228 --> 41:23.728
I said, "I know I am going to do it, if I have to do it, I'll do it."

41:28.770 --> 41:30.936
So this is what should be attitude:

41:31.062 --> 41:38.103
when you love Me I am your ideal. You must know that.

41:38.228 --> 41:42.562
If you love Me, then what are you doing about it?

41:42.644 --> 41:55.103
I am your ideal. You have to reach My style,

41:57.728 --> 42:01.395
otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out in these countries

42:01.520 --> 42:08.062
which have taken to lethargy as a great culture.

42:08.437 --> 42:10.728
I asked somebody, "What about your bathing,

42:10.853 --> 42:12.145
why didn't you take bath?"

42:12.270 --> 42:16.811
He said, "These days it is out of fashion to take bath."

42:17.437 --> 42:22.811
Everything seems to be out of fashion, whatever is in fashion is horrid.

42:23.354 --> 42:25.895
"It's very fashionable," is another thing people say,

42:26.020 --> 42:28.062
"it's very fashionable,"

42:28.187 --> 42:31.978
and whatever is fashionable looks so ugly to Me.

42:33.728 --> 42:36.728
Now if you have to take to the Sahaj culture,

42:36.978 --> 42:40.811
you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life.

42:41.062 --> 42:43.228
We have to have education, we have to have a place,

42:43.354 --> 42:47.811
we have to have a position in the society.

42:47.936 --> 42:50.604
Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas,

42:50.644 --> 42:54.644
somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there

42:54.644 --> 43:00.312
and just doing our Tapasya.

43:00.437 --> 43:08.437
Tapasya is here where you live.

43:08.562 --> 43:12.604
Otherwise if you say that "All right we have to go to Himalayas

43:12.644 --> 43:16.354
and there we have to do Tapasya in the cold winds.

43:16.479 --> 43:18.103
Oh, that's very good."

43:18.228 --> 43:20.228
Because that looks like something, you see,

43:20.354 --> 43:23.395
you might have a name, or something like that.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.437
But Tapasya is here,

43:25.562 --> 43:27.978
the detachment has to be worked out here.

43:28.103 --> 43:31.062
You get involved into all these things,

43:31.187 --> 43:33.895
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

43:34.020 --> 43:37.145
the amount of involvement you have

43:37.270 --> 43:44.354
in the things which existed in gross form,

43:44.479 --> 43:47.853
they have become subtler and you are still bound by them,

43:47.978 --> 43:52.644
there's no freedom.

43:56.228 --> 43:59.644
And that's why when you see something absurd happening,

43:59.644 --> 44:02.437
you see something funny happening in Sahaja Yoga,

44:02.562 --> 44:06.312
it's just the symptom of that thing becoming subtler

44:06.437 --> 44:11.644
within us and its expressing itself.

44:12.479 --> 44:14.562
Like sometimes you may not see fire

44:14.644 --> 44:21.644
but it exists and suddenly you find a blast.

44:22.103 --> 44:28.479
So transformation of course means evolution,

44:28.604 --> 44:29.644
it also means that whatever basis you had,

44:29.686 --> 44:31.644
you have to evolve out of it.

44:31.644 --> 44:40.479
Like a flower blossoming and then becoming the fruit,

44:40.604 --> 44:45.936
but it has to drop out many things.

44:47.644 --> 44:53.644
And then with the nature one has to see such a unison.

44:55.562 --> 45:01.853
In the nature if you see, it sucks the water.

45:01.978 --> 45:07.354
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

45:07.479 --> 45:16.644
Then it becomes a cloud and then the cloud waits,

45:16.644 --> 45:19.187
because the leaves drop out.

45:19.312 --> 45:26.187
In the winter time they nourish the tree with their nitrogen;

45:26.312 --> 45:28.644
when the time is ready,

45:28.644 --> 45:35.644
then these clouds pour down and again nourish this.

45:35.686 --> 45:41.062
Such a complete balance is in the nature.

45:41.187 --> 45:45.228
If it was not, I tell you they would, we would, have said,

45:45.354 --> 45:49.936
"all bald headed lands here."

45:50.853 --> 45:55.895
If you go to any, any forest, any forest, it's so clean,

45:56.020 --> 46:00.354
you never have any bad smell anywhere whatsoever.

46:00.479 --> 46:03.644
There are animals, there are tigers, that, this â€“

46:03.644 --> 46:06.354
never get any smell anywhere,

46:06.479 --> 46:08.145
you never even get the smell of a tiger.

46:08.270 --> 46:13.479
But if you put the tiger in a cage then he starts smelling,

46:13.604 --> 46:16.895
he's so much bathed in the nature, he lives with the nature,

46:17.020 --> 46:20.936
and in such balance.

46:21.062 --> 46:24.437
It's such an understanding among all the animals, everything.

46:24.562 --> 46:28.312
I don't know how they keep it so clean,

46:28.437 --> 46:32.145
but as soon as you get some smell,

46:32.270 --> 46:38.644
you will find out there must be some human being somewhere,

46:39.062 --> 46:43.312
or some untidiness.

46:43.437 --> 46:48.228
It's so organized how the leaves grow according to the sun's rays,

46:48.354 --> 46:49.978
how they organize themselves,

46:50.103 --> 46:54.604
how they build up themselves.

46:54.644 --> 46:58.479
So if you really have to get to the nature of Sahaja Yoga,

46:58.604 --> 47:03.062
we should get all these blessings

47:03.187 --> 47:05.895
by which we should prosper.

47:06.020 --> 47:12.853
Not, I mean in money and things, but in every way.

47:13.270 --> 47:19.479
So it should not be a set of people who are just sort of parasites.

47:21.644 --> 47:28.145
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today

47:28.270 --> 47:31.644
and I request you, all of you,

47:31.644 --> 47:34.645
to be alert and dynamic

47:34.770 --> 47:36.936
and work it out.

47:37.062 --> 47:39.228
Each single person has to come up.

47:39.354 --> 47:42.686
It's not going to work out if you wear some saffron clothes

47:42.811 --> 47:45.728
and go on singing "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" on the street.

47:45.853 --> 47:51.978
No. It's not going to work out.

47:52.103 --> 47:54.145
Nor it is going to work out if you say,

47:54.270 --> 47:57.644
"We are Sahaja Yogis, we are such people and this and that."

47:57.728 --> 48:02.395
Nothing. You have to be something.

48:02.520 --> 48:06.853
So on one side, the dynamism is to be used for yourself

48:06.978 --> 48:12.644
and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.

48:12.644 --> 48:18.187
You need not now worry about right-sidedness.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.644
Is very common even in ...

48:20.644 --> 48:23.479
This happened: I found in Holland

48:23.604 --> 48:28.644
that I married one girl, very dynamic girl, to someone

48:28.686 --> 48:32.145
and the husband said, "Mother, she doesn't help me."

48:32.270 --> 48:33.644
I said, "Why?"

48:33.644 --> 48:36.644
"Because I'm afraid I'll become right-sided."

48:36.644 --> 48:40.811
I said, "But why did I marry you to this left-sided fellow?

48:40.936 --> 48:43.437
That you become left-sided?"

48:43.562 --> 48:45.312
Left-sided is a very good thing

48:45.437 --> 48:48.187
because you don't have to do anything, just you have to say,

48:48.312 --> 48:57.354
"I don't want to become right-sided," that's all.

48:57.479 --> 49:00.395
But right-sidedness means you have to look,

49:00.520 --> 49:03.479
you have to be alert, you have to be clever

49:03.604 --> 49:08.644
and you have to know everything.

49:08.644 --> 49:11.728
You'll sit in the sun, burn your skins,

49:11.853 --> 49:14.312
but look at the sun.

49:14.437 --> 49:21.562
Are you on the sun line or on the moon line?

49:21.644 --> 49:27.644
So the swing of all the Western people is on the left hand side.

49:27.644 --> 49:37.562
Drinking, pubs, like in 24 hours they sleep,

49:37.644 --> 49:39.228
say maybe fourteen hours,

49:39.354 --> 49:39.354
maybe eighteen hours,

49:40.644 --> 49:44.686
rest of the time they drink, that's all.

49:44.811 --> 49:49.103
We have one house being built next to us,

49:49.479 --> 49:50.811
when we shifted there, they said,

49:50.936 --> 49:53.686
"This is practically finished now" - still finishing

49:53.811 --> 49:55.978
and will take at least three years more maybe,

49:56.103 --> 49:57.644
may never finish.

49:57.686 --> 50:01.103
It's like the mathematics, you see, you have this

50:01.228 --> 50:04.644
that there was a work and somebody came,

50:04.728 --> 50:07.145
he did one tenth and ran away.

50:07.270 --> 50:09.853
Then somebody came did one twentieth and ran away.

50:09.978 --> 50:12.395
Then somebody came he did one fortieth and ran away.

50:12.520 --> 50:14.644
When will the work finish? It will never finish,

50:14.644 --> 50:18.644
with such running away people, never finish.

50:18.728 --> 50:20.811
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga.

50:20.936 --> 50:22.479
If you put mathematically,

50:22.604 --> 50:24.811
Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America,

50:24.936 --> 50:32.145
if you add up more and more of this kind of people.

50:32.270 --> 50:34.479
So much is happening in this country,

50:34.604 --> 50:36.228
but you have to see those people, you have to meet those people

50:36.354 --> 50:41.479
who are at the helm of affairs, who are the people who matter,

50:41.604 --> 50:46.103
who are scientific, who are talking about something sensible.

50:46.228 --> 50:50.686
You have to talk to them, get to them.

50:53.062 --> 50:55.645
We don't need cinema actors and actresses,

50:55.770 --> 50:59.479
but we need people who are dynamic.

50:59.604 --> 51:01.228
And this may work out

51:01.354 --> 51:05.520
if you put your minds to it and we have something to show them.

51:08.437 --> 51:10.354
I would say that Austria is one place

51:10.479 --> 51:12.395
where Sahaja Yoga has worked very well,

51:12.520 --> 51:17.853
Milan is another place and where most of them are professionals.

51:19.020 --> 51:23.644
It's very surprising, in modern times we are living.

51:23.728 --> 51:25.936
We are not living in those ancient times

51:26.062 --> 51:30.145
where the Rishi Munis used to sit under a tree

51:30.270 --> 51:35.145
and the kings used to come and touch their feet.

51:35.270 --> 51:36.811
Is the other way round;

51:36.936 --> 51:43.644
the Rishi Munis have to go and talk to the kings.

51:44.936 --> 51:48.228
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis

51:48.354 --> 51:50.312
we have to know that in a subtle way

51:50.437 --> 51:52.187
we are still caught up into the webs of

51:52.312 --> 51:57.644
our own understanding about life. So, that we have to change.

51:57.644 --> 52:01.354
Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga

52:01.479 --> 52:11.270
and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others.

52:12.354 --> 52:16.644
So I hope you will listen to My lecture today,

52:16.644 --> 52:19.644
you will take the tapes home and listen to them

52:19.644 --> 52:21.354
again and again.

52:21.479 --> 52:24.312
Also there's a warning from people that

52:24.437 --> 52:31.604
"Mother, what they do is to take one tape for one center

52:31.644 --> 52:34.644
and everybody listens it and then finished."

52:34.686 --> 52:40.437
Meaning, you all should have one tape each.

52:40.562 --> 52:42.936
Even that, people don't do.

52:43.062 --> 52:45.644
Not only that, but now it might be after some time

52:45.644 --> 52:52.644
only one, one tape in circulation in one country.

52:52.728 --> 52:56.354
They circulate; say, today in New York, tomorrow in Boston,

52:56.479 --> 53:01.145
like that. You have to listen to it again and again.

53:01.270 --> 53:03.644
Sit down with your paper and pencil,

53:03.644 --> 53:05.644
see for yourself what I am saying.

53:05.728 --> 53:08.395
Every tape should be with you.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.644
I mean, these horrible gurus' tapes

53:10.644 --> 53:14.645
you can hear them in every car, in every place,

53:14.770 --> 53:17.644
everyone they have it.

53:17.686 --> 53:22.604
And why is it Sahaja Yogis don't have any tapes with them?

53:22.644 --> 53:26.644
You can make copies.

53:28.270 --> 53:31.562
But if you can get it free, they'll like to have.

53:31.644 --> 53:37.978
That's the first thing, what we can get free, cheaply, easily.

53:38.103 --> 53:44.437
If you try to save money, the money tries to save itself.

53:44.562 --> 53:51.103
It's a mutual understanding.

53:54.312 --> 53:57.645
It's as simple as this: supposing you open only one door,

53:57.770 --> 53:58.853
no air will come in.

53:58.978 --> 54:01.728
You open the other door the air will start flowing.

54:01.853 --> 54:06.270
It's a circulation.

54:07.811 --> 54:10.395
All this can be your own knowledge too,

54:10.520 --> 54:13.604
I need not say anything, this is all in your brains,

54:13.644 --> 54:16.645
only open out yourself, you are not free people.

54:16.770 --> 54:18.395
If you are free like Me,

54:18.520 --> 54:23.978
you'll see all these things coming from your own brains.

54:24.644 --> 54:28.895
Specially for America, really, as you know, I am working very hard

54:29.020 --> 54:31.686
and I want to work it out because,

54:31.811 --> 54:35.187
if America is not all right, My Vishuddhi is not going to be all right.

54:35.312 --> 54:39.644
It's going to trouble Me throughout.

54:39.728 --> 54:44.853
So you have to take it up upon yourself.

54:44.978 --> 54:51.062
I don't say, "Take the cross."

54:51.187 --> 54:53.853
You don't have to sacrifice anything,

54:53.978 --> 55:01.062
but you have to be just aware about what are we,

55:01.187 --> 55:04.686
what are we doing, where are we?

55:04.811 --> 55:07.228
And on top of that,

55:07.354 --> 55:13.187
Sahaja Yogis think they are obliging Sahaja Yoga and Me too.

55:13.644 --> 55:18.562
This is something. It's to be explained this way:

55:18.644 --> 55:21.187
I don't need Sahaja Yoga, you need Sahaja Yoga

55:21.312 --> 55:23.562
and everybody needs Sahaja Yoga.

55:23.644 --> 55:25.853
You had in this country people like,

55:25.978 --> 55:28.395
I mean such great, great people you had

55:28.520 --> 55:31.853
I need not mention - persons like Abraham Lincoln

55:31.978 --> 55:38.103
who gave such great ideas to the whole world.

55:39.354 --> 55:41.686
Why not you people be great?

55:41.811 --> 55:43.644
He was a realized soul, all right,

55:43.644 --> 55:50.645
but he didn't know anything about Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.

55:50.770 --> 55:55.562
Why can't you become great like him?

56:00.228 --> 56:03.312
So on a Virata Puja we have to decide

56:03.562 --> 56:06.644
that we are all going to express

56:06.644 --> 56:12.187
the conception that was once the Virat

56:12.312 --> 56:14.644
as reality in our lives.

56:14.728 --> 56:21.644
This is what we have to pray from our heart.

56:22.520 --> 56:26.312
And it's a very good occasion today to do that,

56:26.437 --> 56:30.187
because we are sitting in a place where there were

56:30.312 --> 56:36.978
so many of these aboriginal people, you call them, anything.

56:37.103 --> 56:40.562
They were so sensible,

56:40.644 --> 56:44.354
as in America you say brass tacks, you see.

56:44.479 --> 56:52.644
They knew the principle how to lead a real spiritual life.

56:52.686 --> 56:57.187
They were very free people, extremely free

56:57.644 --> 57:01.312
and so detached.

57:01.437 --> 57:03.644
So if you do not correct yourself,

57:03.728 --> 57:05.978
then there will be a problem on collectivity.

57:06.103 --> 57:07.645
If there's a problem in collectivity,

57:07.770 --> 57:10.228
it will reflect on you,

57:10.354 --> 57:13.395
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

57:13.520 --> 57:16.354
If there's a problem in the whole being

57:16.479 --> 57:18.187
there's a problem for you.

57:18.312 --> 57:20.062
And if there's a problem in one part,

57:20.187 --> 57:22.479
there's a problem for the whole being.

57:22.604 --> 57:25.645
Even Roosevelt who was your president once said that

57:25.770 --> 57:29.312
"Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere."

57:29.437 --> 57:33.811
He could see this point so clearly.

57:33.936 --> 57:36.103
You see, all these sayings show us

57:36.228 --> 57:39.062
that this is a country of Virat,

57:39.187 --> 57:40.644
where they talk of collectivity,

57:40.644 --> 57:44.562
they have all the communications

57:44.644 --> 57:46.437
which are important.

57:46.562 --> 57:48.644
Every sort of communication is important,

57:48.686 --> 57:49.853
but for Sahaja Yogis

57:49.978 --> 57:53.479
it has to be very subtle, very dynamic,

57:53.604 --> 57:55.562
very beautiful, very loving,

57:55.644 --> 57:59.853
very impressive, magnetic.

57:59.978 --> 58:04.354
Then only the communications will work.

58:04.479 --> 58:08.644
There's no harm in wearing very nice dresses.

58:08.644 --> 58:13.853
There's no harm in wearing - nice doesn't mean expensive,

58:13.978 --> 58:21.644
but means which are sensible, dignified.

58:21.644 --> 58:25.103
We have to build up our personalities,

58:25.228 --> 58:33.978
that people should feel that "Oh, this is something, eh."

58:34.103 --> 58:39.936
And your children will also learn from you.

58:40.062 --> 58:42.728
There's no question of feeling that

58:42.853 --> 58:43.437
you'll be driven into ego or anything,

58:43.644 --> 58:51.686
that's finished now, ego is finished here, there's no ego.

58:51.811 --> 58:56.395
What I find here is a justification

58:56.520 --> 58:57.645
for doing nothing

58:57.770 --> 59:05.354
that we do not want to do anything because our ego will come up.

59:05.479 --> 59:12.312
Very clever.

59:15.811 --> 59:19.187
So with all this one has to know

59:19.312 --> 59:21.936
that we are selected people,

59:22.062 --> 59:25.354
we are chosen people of God.

59:25.479 --> 59:27.645
He must have selected us with some purpose,

59:27.770 --> 59:31.354
otherwise there are so many people in this country.

59:31.479 --> 59:35.354
You are the foundation and you have to be solid people

59:35.479 --> 59:37.644
to be the foundation.

59:38.811 --> 59:41.395
Must know our own glory,

59:41.520 --> 59:44.604
our own speciality

59:44.644 --> 59:47.187
that why we are selected,

59:47.312 --> 59:50.145
of all the people why are we there?

59:50.270 --> 59:56.562
Then, what are we doing about it?

59:56.644 --> 59:58.644
Normal life you do see that way,

59:58.644 --> 01:00:01.936
like if somebody is selected for a post or something,

01:00:02.062 --> 01:00:04.645
out of many, many things, "Oh must be something about me,

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:07.604
I must show my worth, I must show my value,

01:00:07.644 --> 01:00:09.644
I must show my work," you see,

01:00:09.644 --> 01:00:16.437
and he works hard to prove that the selection was good.

01:00:16.562 --> 01:00:19.479
But in Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

01:00:19.604 --> 01:00:21.686
you take it for granted,

01:00:21.811 --> 01:00:24.228
"Oh, we are something great."

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:31.228
So now settle down with yourself - have a cup of tea.

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:39.187
I hope it has been understood why I am saying so,

01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:42.395
because I am really concerned about America.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.644
So many negative forces are working here

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:49.644
and we have to improve.

01:00:50.728 --> 01:00:53.853
So many things such a big responsibility,

01:00:53.978 --> 01:00:56.811
such a big country, such a vast country,

01:00:56.936 --> 01:01:05.228
so much perversion, so much nonsensical ideologies,

01:01:05.354 --> 01:01:08.562
I mean endless.

01:01:08.644 --> 01:01:14.479
Even if you get fifteen Gorbachevs, you cannot change this country.

01:01:15.312 --> 01:01:17.978
It has gone amuck.

01:01:18.103 --> 01:01:20.644
Everybody's an individual,

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:23.145
this mad place.

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:26.312
One Gorbachev can change that country

01:01:26.437 --> 01:01:28.811
which has much more population.

01:01:28.936 --> 01:01:30.853
But no one can change this country

01:01:30.978 --> 01:01:36.103
unless and until you people decide to do something about it.

01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:40.228
So I'm told some people are frustrated

01:01:40.354 --> 01:01:42.978
because there are not so many Sahaja Yogis are coming,

01:01:43.103 --> 01:01:45.437
but may be something wrong with you.

01:01:45.562 --> 01:01:47.145
Maybe that you are not deep enough

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:52.520
and that you are not so much impressive.

01:01:54.728 --> 01:01:57.062
You have to change your life style,

01:01:57.187 --> 01:02:04.978
you have to be smart people and spartan.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:11.645
I hope, I hope again and again that after this Virata's Puja

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:15.811
you all will come up on the stage as great Viratas.

01:02:15.978 --> 01:02:17.644
May God bless you all.
