WEBVTT

01:04.239 --> 01:10.729
Today we are going to worship the Hamsa Chakra.

01:10.729 --> 01:23.970
So far we have been always worshipping a Deity
and this is the second time you are worshipping

01:23.970 --> 01:27.399
this centre of Hamsa.

01:27.399 --> 01:43.310
Now this chakra is, it is, you know, placed
between the two eyebrows and two eyes represent

01:43.310 --> 01:50.299
the left and the right side.

01:50.299 --> 02:08.950
So this centre is very much guided by our
eyes, by our ears, by our nose, tongue, teeth,

02:08.950 --> 02:11.220
throat.

02:11.220 --> 02:20.780
Is a very important centre because the Vishuddhi,
which has to look after sixteen petals, which,

02:20.780 --> 02:29.700
sixteen petals, which look after all these
ear, nose, throat, different, different organs

02:29.700 --> 02:38.090
within us, also it has to communicate with
the Viraat.

02:38.090 --> 02:46.660
So it has to pass through this centre of Hamsa
Chakra.

02:46.660 --> 03:08.680
Hamsa Chakra is the very pivotal centre, which
expresses auspiciousness in our awareness.

03:08.680 --> 03:17.959
That means, if this centre is alert and awakened,
then we immediately know what is auspicious

03:17.959 --> 03:25.190
and what is not auspicious, or we can call
it, we get the Divine Discretion.

03:25.190 --> 03:45.920
I think it is a part of the genetics that
people have discretion between good and bad,

03:45.920 --> 03:50.700
destructive and constructive.

03:50.700 --> 04:06.950
It is basically, has to be there, but we can
easily spoil it by all these organs which

04:06.950 --> 04:14.380
are collecting the conditionings and the ego
from outside.

04:14.380 --> 04:20.239
That’s why this centre is very vulnerable.

04:20.239 --> 04:28.030
Other centres are not so much connected outside
as this centre is connected, and receives

04:28.030 --> 04:31.229
all the information from, all these organs.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.260
For example, the eyes, now, we have.

04:34.260 --> 04:45.669
Eyes are very important because, they say
it, this is the window of the Spirit.

04:45.669 --> 04:53.000
And you have seen that when Kundalini rises,
and Spirit starts shining, there is a dilatation

04:53.000 --> 04:59.020
of the pupils and you look like an innocent
child and there’s a twinkle in your eyes.

04:59.020 --> 05:09.340
But the way that we play with our eyes all
the time, the way we use it indiscreetly with

05:09.340 --> 05:17.919
our lust and greed we can spoil this centre
very badly.

05:17.919 --> 05:33.930
Once we start taking to destructive things
in our life, we immediately become akin, or

05:33.930 --> 05:42.400
we start accepting, whatever is wrong, whatever
is destructive, very easily.

05:42.400 --> 05:50.620
I feel this is some sort of a genetic defect
because, in certain people, they will not

05:50.620 --> 05:56.939
accept anything that is stupid, idiotic or
destructive.

05:56.939 --> 06:06.250
But in certain people they’re very prone
and very easily can be taken to things which

06:06.250 --> 06:14.210
are absurd, which are stupid and which are
definitely destructive.

06:14.210 --> 06:26.800
This can become a very collective acceptance
also and once it becomes a collective acceptance,

06:26.800 --> 06:30.319
it starts penetrating throughout.

06:30.319 --> 06:37.759
It does not only have the effect of absorption,
but also it has an effect of affecting other

06:37.759 --> 06:39.560
things.

06:39.560 --> 06:48.490
Say a person whose eyes are what we call flirtish
or roving eyes, such a person, if he goes

06:48.490 --> 06:54.289
to one group of people who do not know what
flirting is, do not know what roving eyes

06:54.289 --> 07:04.849
is, with very steady eyes, he can influence
those people and can make some of them of

07:04.849 --> 07:07.800
the same kind.

07:07.800 --> 07:19.169
So what happens, really, is this, that, this
is a very good door for all kinds of bhoots

07:19.169 --> 07:29.879
to enter, entities to enter, and when you
start projecting it back, the same bhoots

07:29.879 --> 07:41.599
can pass into another person and can create
the same kind of vacuum or same kind of vulnerability

07:41.599 --> 07:50.809
in the Hamsa Chakra of other people.

07:50.809 --> 07:58.819
So that’s why eyes have to be very, very
clean, innocent.

07:58.819 --> 08:07.370
Another, you can see, is what you hear.

08:07.370 --> 08:12.879
Some people, if they hear something nonsensical,
they’ll just put their hands to their ears.

08:12.879 --> 08:16.729
They don’t want to hear anything.

08:16.729 --> 08:25.259
But there are some people who like it and
go on enjoying it.

08:25.259 --> 08:33.000
Ultimately, they become servile or, we can
say, conditioned, that they like all these

08:33.000 --> 08:41.289
horrible things that normally a human being
won’t like.

08:41.289 --> 08:50.470
Now, also you must have seen that people who,
like French people, I think they have no discretion

08:50.470 --> 08:51.470
of smell.

08:51.470 --> 09:02.420
They smell so awful, but they eat all rotten
food, rotten cheese, rotten, absolutely rotten

09:02.420 --> 09:06.600
wines, but they never smell it.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.170
Anybody in their company can smell it.

09:08.170 --> 09:12.620
Even their hands smell of their rotten cheese,
you can’t just [bare to] smell it.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.230
But they have lost the power.

09:15.230 --> 09:21.740
In the same way, in our country we have a
caste called sweepers who do all the cleaning

09:21.740 --> 09:24.400
of dirty things with their hands.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.690
They have no sense of smell.

09:26.690 --> 09:28.800
They have lost the sense of smell.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.440
The nose has lost that smell sense.

09:31.440 --> 09:35.140
They cannot smell anything dirty.

09:35.140 --> 09:38.709
That’s how they can do their work.

09:38.709 --> 09:47.680
So if you start also not being alert to fragrance
– I’ve seen also there are certain things

09:47.680 --> 10:00.620
people use made of tobacco, they are supposed
to be very good, very famous brands of perfumes

10:00.620 --> 10:06.009
like ‘Tabac’ and all that.

10:06.009 --> 10:11.630
So once they start liking that kind of a thing,
then they have other things like ‘Poison‘

10:11.630 --> 10:16.680
and other horrible things, which, it’s horrible
smell in it.

10:16.680 --> 10:22.699
Apart from that, first [thing] you smell is
alcohol, is a spirit!

10:22.699 --> 10:34.270
But they don’t mind because they see in
that a very congenial type of a pleasure.

10:34.270 --> 10:40.120
But these pleasures, ultimately, can kill
all the cells of the nose and afterwards one

10:40.120 --> 10:43.750
may even lose the sense of smell.

10:43.750 --> 10:48.830
One of the joy-giving organ is the sense of
smell.

10:48.830 --> 10:54.370
When the Kundalini rises in many people they
get a fragrance of many things.

10:54.370 --> 11:01.850
Some people get of guggul or sometimes they
get a fragrance of sandalwood or something,

11:01.850 --> 11:09.759
which is a very natural essence of flowers
or maybe of some woods.

11:09.759 --> 11:23.060
But these unnaturally made things which are
actually destructive to your cells of smelling,

11:23.060 --> 11:29.120
that is what they start using, and once you
start using these kind of things then what

11:29.120 --> 11:34.199
happens is that you don’t feel any bad smell
anywhere, like animals.

11:34.199 --> 11:38.940
But so many animals can smell, if not they
don’t call it bad or good, but they can

11:38.940 --> 11:41.960
smell.

11:41.960 --> 11:48.350
Even that sensitivity of good and bad smell
which we human beings have got is lost.

11:48.350 --> 11:56.149
So whatever is our ascent, as human beings,
at what a level we have gone, start completely

11:56.149 --> 12:00.960
disappearing, gradually, one by one.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.810
Then same with the throat.

12:03.810 --> 12:23.509
If the throat is using bad languages and is
being used for abusing people, showing temper

12:23.509 --> 12:36.250
on people or anything of aggression or sometimes
people take things which can also spoil the

12:36.250 --> 12:49.339
throat by their destructive qualities, like
alcohol; specially the smoking.

12:49.339 --> 12:56.389
If you smoke then the throat gets vulnerable
and the sweetness of your voice is lost.

12:56.389 --> 13:00.600
Then they speak with a hoarse voice.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.279
But this is all external.

13:03.279 --> 13:06.160
It starts becoming external.

13:06.160 --> 13:17.860
Mouth smells with that and also the teeth
react to all such things, which we take without

13:17.860 --> 13:23.861
discretion about it, because that’s the
fashion, because it is marketing well, because

13:23.861 --> 13:26.190
it is advertised!

13:26.190 --> 13:32.480
That means we have not got our own wisdom,
our own personality.

13:32.480 --> 13:40.389
But when this centre is awakened, then what
you develop is a discretion.

13:40.389 --> 13:50.630
As I was telling them yesterday how the word
Hamsa has come for this centre.

13:50.630 --> 13:58.630
Because there’s a Sanskrit, very beautiful,
couplet, which says that a swan is white and

13:58.630 --> 14:01.800
a crane is a white bird.

14:01.800 --> 14:08.760
What is the difference between the swan and
a crane?

14:08.760 --> 14:16.560
The answer is that when you mix milk with
water, the swan will just suck in the milk

14:16.560 --> 14:26.480
while the crane has no discretion, no vivek.

14:26.480 --> 14:37.420
This discretionary power, once we start losing,
we start becoming just like robots, I would

14:37.420 --> 14:41.029
say, because we have no personality.

14:41.029 --> 14:48.209
Anybody can brainwash us and the more they
tell us about our discretion we listen to

14:48.209 --> 14:49.209
them.

14:49.209 --> 14:55.360
That explains why people, so many thousands
of people, go to all these false gurus.

14:55.360 --> 15:01.430
Thousands of people, why did they take to
homosexuality and got into AIDS?

15:01.430 --> 15:10.510
Why thousands of people have taken to drugs?

15:10.510 --> 15:13.129
It is unbelievable!

15:13.129 --> 15:15.370
Incredible!

15:15.370 --> 15:19.980
Why people have taken to all these things
[and] are destroying their life.

15:19.980 --> 15:25.649
They see a man going into the pub, coming
out and falling down on the ground with all

15:25.649 --> 15:28.170
his purse being emptied.

15:28.170 --> 15:32.939
But they go with the purse, see that they
have sufficient money to go inside the pub,

15:32.939 --> 15:36.060
again come out to fall down on the street.

15:36.060 --> 15:46.550
Whatever idiotic or nonsensical [things] other
people are doing, when you see they’re idiotic,

15:46.550 --> 15:50.670
you pay money to become idiotic.

15:50.670 --> 15:57.860
One pays money to destroy oneself, go out
of the way.

15:57.860 --> 16:01.620
It is so unnatural for anyone.

16:01.620 --> 16:08.630
I mean even a dog or a cat, or any animal,
knows where is the danger is.

16:08.630 --> 16:14.569
They can smell the danger and they run away
because they have to preserve their lives.

16:14.569 --> 16:21.389
They think their lives are precious and they
must live and live well.

16:21.389 --> 16:29.460
But this ordinary, common sense starts missing
and they will say, “What’s wrong?

16:29.460 --> 16:31.550
What’s wrong in this?

16:31.550 --> 16:34.170
What’s wrong in that?”

16:34.170 --> 16:38.730
That means the genetics of the Hamsa are missing.

16:38.730 --> 16:51.680
Now you should see there is no Deity on the
Hamsa Chakra, but it is the formless energy

16:51.680 --> 17:12.290
of so many organs which are looked after by
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ, Shri Krishna – four

17:12.290 --> 17:18.060
of them, managed by Shri Ganesha.

17:18.060 --> 17:24.930
So these genetics are put by Shri Ganesha
because He is the source of the Wisdom.

17:24.930 --> 17:35.760
So first, once they spoil their Mooladhara,
the wisdom is finished: [the] basis, the fundamentals,

17:35.760 --> 17:37.240
are finished.

17:37.240 --> 17:50.740
That’s why immoral life is very detrimental
to our life because we lose our discretion,

17:50.740 --> 17:53.610
the discretion is lost.

17:53.610 --> 18:08.140
Then if you can awaken Shri Ganesha in the
Hamsa Chakra, then suddenly you belong to

18:08.140 --> 18:11.850
the higher race of Sahaja Yogis.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.880
It’s surprising.

18:13.880 --> 18:21.590
I’ve seen people overnight give up their
drugs, very immoral people become extremely

18:21.590 --> 18:31.909
moral because of this chakra being suddenly
awakened and the light of the Spirit is best

18:31.909 --> 18:44.520
expressed through this chakra in everyday
life, in the collective life also.

18:44.520 --> 18:50.190
One starts then seeing the point, as we say.

18:50.190 --> 18:55.070
Like now, in Sahaja Yogas, we have different
problems, also.

18:55.070 --> 19:03.409
Say, when people first come to Sahaja Yoga,
they start watching other people and starting

19:03.409 --> 19:07.710
finding their faults, what’s wrong with
them.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.799
They never see what they are here for.

19:10.799 --> 19:17.230
They are not here to find out faults with
others, but to correct your own defects.

19:17.230 --> 19:19.049
So they say, “Oh, this man is no good.

19:19.049 --> 19:20.100
That man is no good.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.190
This is wrong.”

19:21.190 --> 19:23.400
They start creating problems, you see.

19:23.400 --> 19:28.039
They’ll talk to each other, saying, “Oh
this man is not good.

19:28.039 --> 19:31.940
That man is not good,” try create groups
and things.

19:31.940 --> 19:36.700
They’re here to offer what?

19:36.700 --> 19:44.330
Or create a politics or for your ascent?

19:44.330 --> 19:49.600
Some of them, if they do not do all this,
then they think we should start to make some

19:49.600 --> 20:03.950
money out of it or some sort of a thing, or
some start criticising others about something,

20:03.950 --> 20:10.409
which is not their concern.

20:10.409 --> 20:15.240
So they forget because they are just now coming
to Sahaja Yoga and their genetics are not

20:15.240 --> 20:17.679
established of their wisdom.

20:17.679 --> 20:26.640
They start worrying about things, which are
not their worry, which they should not bother

20:26.640 --> 20:30.950
about.

20:30.950 --> 20:34.330
Then some of them start thinking, “Oh, I
am the leader!”

20:34.330 --> 20:39.370
or “Why am I not the leader?”

20:39.370 --> 20:42.600
So they start finding fault with the leadership.

20:42.600 --> 20:47.040
Sometimes leader also can feel, “Oh, I am
the leader.

20:47.040 --> 20:54.470
I can be very stern, very disciplinary and
I can control people.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.450
I can do this.”

20:57.450 --> 21:09.159
They have come here to learn how to love,
to be compassionate, to be tolerant.

21:09.159 --> 21:24.760
The sense of leadership and also of obedience
– both are discretionary.

21:24.760 --> 21:33.450
If somebody says something to you and if you
obey that person for your benevolence, you

21:33.450 --> 21:40.289
will subtly understand that it is for your
good.

21:40.289 --> 21:46.440
If some leader says that “This is wrong
with you,” try to see if it is wrong, instead

21:46.440 --> 21:48.620
of feeling hurt about it.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.320
“Yes, it is wrong with me.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.390
So what should I do?

21:52.390 --> 21:53.600
How can I improve myself?”

21:53.600 --> 21:56.510
Ask the leader or you can write to Me or do
anything.

21:56.510 --> 21:57.510
But no!

21:57.510 --> 21:58.510
They will not do it.

21:58.510 --> 22:02.149
Immediately they will write a letter to Me
saying, “This leader is such-and-such, bad

22:02.149 --> 22:03.149
fellow.

22:03.149 --> 22:04.149
He’s so this thing.

22:04.149 --> 22:05.169
He ate that money.

22:05.169 --> 22:06.250
He ate that thing!”

22:06.250 --> 22:09.350
and all kinds of things.

22:09.350 --> 22:14.450
Or else they may tell people, “Oh, Mother
listens to this fellow.

22:14.450 --> 22:15.450
He’s no good.

22:15.450 --> 22:17.580
He’s just telling Mother stories and Mother
listens!”

22:17.580 --> 22:20.970
Mother is not such a fool.

22:20.970 --> 22:27.450
She knows about everything.

22:27.450 --> 22:33.440
So all these things that we have gathered
from our previous life, even after our second

22:33.440 --> 22:35.049
birth we carry little bit.

22:35.049 --> 22:42.559
Like an egg becomes a bird but still lots
of things of the egg are hanging on to his

22:42.559 --> 22:44.500
body, so you have to cleanse it.

22:44.500 --> 22:49.080
So, at this point, when you have got your
realisation, the first discretion should be,

22:49.080 --> 22:55.700
“How am I going to achieve that state of
Spirit?”

22:55.700 --> 22:57.279
The Pure Spirit!

22:57.279 --> 23:05.860
Instead of that, also, people get lost because
they have no discretion.

23:05.860 --> 23:15.820
With this enlightenment, first thing that
happens, I’ve seen with people: Their eyes

23:15.820 --> 23:17.910
are fixed.

23:17.910 --> 23:21.090
They don’t rove their eyes much now.

23:21.090 --> 23:26.789
They have very innocent eyes.

23:26.789 --> 23:33.960
Otherwise they are really mad, those people
who go on looking at everything like this.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.460
There’s no difference between madman and
him.

23:36.460 --> 23:42.360
You put one madman, he does the same and a
person who is like that does the same.

23:42.360 --> 23:51.860
And it’s such a crazy thing to do, but immediately…I
mean, it is such a spontaneous thing.

23:51.860 --> 23:55.980
It’s like the light coming in the room.

23:55.980 --> 24:00.919
It is so spontaneous that you start seeing
things clearly – “No, no.

24:00.919 --> 24:06.500
This is not good!”

24:06.500 --> 24:12.500
Before in the garden, you would go and collect
all the thorns and put them in your body.

24:12.500 --> 24:15.840
That was the situation.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.440
Never looked at the flowers.

24:19.440 --> 24:24.870
And suddenly, after realisation, you will
be amazed, you just see flowers and don’t

24:24.870 --> 24:30.890
bother about thorns, or if you find you take
them out.

24:30.890 --> 24:41.230
There is joy even before realisation and after
realisation, but there is no capacity to enjoy.

24:41.230 --> 24:50.799
That capacity comes to you after realisation
and the main thing that happens to you is

24:50.799 --> 24:52.580
the discretion.

24:52.580 --> 24:58.710
Then, like the swan, you just take the milk
of everything.

24:58.710 --> 25:10.220
At everything your attitude becomes very different,
you start seeing things in a different angle.

25:10.220 --> 25:19.030
Like once we had to go to one very ancient
temple to see some art.

25:19.030 --> 25:26.370
Me, my son-in-law and my daughter, we were
walking up up, we had to walk for miles, up

25:26.370 --> 25:32.159
the hill and they were very tired so we went
into one temple and just laid down ourselves.

25:32.159 --> 25:34.519
They were so tired.

25:34.519 --> 25:40.180
At that time I said, “See these elephants,
see how beautiful they are, every one has

25:40.180 --> 25:52.159
a different type of a tail and a different
type of a trunk, the poses are different.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.260
So many of them are like that.”

25:54.260 --> 25:55.620
My son-in-law said, “Babaa!

25:55.620 --> 25:57.110
We are so tired.

25:57.110 --> 26:00.919
How are you looking at these things?”

26:00.919 --> 26:07.240
Because attention didn’t go to my tiredness
but to those beautiful things.

26:07.240 --> 26:11.360
Same thing, you start sucking in the milk.

26:11.360 --> 26:20.190
There is joy but you cannot feel the joy because
the power, that subtle power of Divine Discretion

26:20.190 --> 26:22.530
is not there.

26:22.530 --> 26:25.140
Once that comes in, you start enjoying everything.

26:25.140 --> 26:36.200
It’s just the same, [your] life is just
the same, nothing has changed: same house,

26:36.200 --> 26:41.460
same family, same city, same environment.

26:41.460 --> 26:52.960
But you start enjoying because the sensitivity
of your Hamsa Chakra is now only for Divine

26:52.960 --> 27:01.440
Discretion and you immediately know and then
you don’t want to do anything with the thorns,

27:01.440 --> 27:08.340
only want to gather flowers and you know how
to gather flowers and you are in joy.

27:08.340 --> 27:19.590
So the light of the Spirit, which shines through
your Hamsa Chakra, gives you wisdom.

27:19.590 --> 27:25.250
Wisdom doesn’t mean that you know how to
argue things or you fight with people.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.930
No, it doesn’t mean that!

27:26.930 --> 27:40.910
Wisdom means how you take to the good side
of everything, to enjoy it, this is Wisdom.

27:40.910 --> 27:48.820
And that you avoid all destructive things
and take to something constructive.

27:48.820 --> 27:56.660
Now you are going, say, on a road and is written
there – there’s danger.

27:56.660 --> 27:58.840
Before realisation they will say, “All right.

27:58.840 --> 27:59.920
Let’s see what is danger.”

27:59.920 --> 28:06.730
They’ll jump into it and say that, “We
have got nirvana” by killing themselves.

28:06.730 --> 28:08.730
Such explanations!

28:08.730 --> 28:11.220
But a sensible man will say, “All right,
danger?

28:11.220 --> 28:12.220
Go back.

28:12.220 --> 28:14.230
What’s the harm, after all?”

28:14.230 --> 28:18.520
He preserves himself.

28:18.520 --> 28:27.590
He respects his life because he knows now
[that] he has become the instrument of God.

28:27.590 --> 28:35.610
So Wisdom comes to you automatically, but
through experience.

28:35.610 --> 28:39.730
Then you know this is the right path.

28:39.730 --> 28:43.480
Through experience you start understanding.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.669
Nowadays I am telling all these things to
you.

28:45.669 --> 28:50.290
Say, if, twenty years back, I never talked
of these things to them, [it was] because

28:50.290 --> 28:54.059
I knew if I start talking, they’ll say,
“Oh, She’s talking something out of the

28:54.059 --> 28:55.059
blue.

28:55.059 --> 28:58.240
God knows if it is true or not.”

28:58.240 --> 29:07.010
But once the wisdom becomes transparent and
you start seeing through it, everything, very

29:07.010 --> 29:15.600
clearly, makes your mind absolutely clear
then, anybody who then tells things of wisdom,

29:15.600 --> 29:21.850
you never feel bad about it, on the contrary,
you thank that “I’m so lucky that I can

29:21.850 --> 29:26.289
hear about these things, such a nice things!”

29:26.289 --> 29:29.769
And also those sayings start giving you joy.

29:29.769 --> 29:35.450
So, with the ear you hear so many things.

29:35.450 --> 29:39.960
Used to hear the same things, might [be] hearing
so much music, everything – before also

29:39.960 --> 29:43.140
– but never gave you joy.

29:43.140 --> 29:51.730
Now, because of this transformation, the same
music, which you heard before, now makes you

29:51.730 --> 29:55.899
feel as if you are in the seventh heaven.

29:55.899 --> 29:57.940
It gives you ecstasy.

29:57.940 --> 30:04.880
The poetry, which was quite mundane, ordinary,
people told Me, “Mother, it was such a headache

30:04.880 --> 30:07.179
to read William Blake in those days.

30:07.179 --> 30:08.620
But now we love it.

30:08.620 --> 30:11.389
We read it like Bible!”

30:11.389 --> 30:17.950
Because now you have developed new sight,
new hearing power.

30:17.950 --> 30:24.539
All these are called in Sanskrit ‘atindrya’,
means ‘the organs which are subtle organs

30:24.539 --> 30:25.570
within us’.

30:25.570 --> 30:36.909
So eyes have a subtle organ, ears have a subtle
organ and these subtle organs then start emitting

30:36.909 --> 30:46.500
such responses to all the surroundings that
you just gather whatever is beautiful.

30:46.500 --> 30:50.970
Say it is very dark.

30:50.970 --> 30:55.470
Normally, you’ll be frightened.

30:55.470 --> 31:01.010
But if it is very dark, you say, “Oh, it’s
very good.

31:01.010 --> 31:02.520
How we are enjoying here na?

31:02.520 --> 31:04.340
It’s such venturesome thing!”

31:04.340 --> 31:08.789
You’ll go slowly, slowly holding each other’s
hands.

31:08.789 --> 31:14.730
Supposing it is very hot: Then maybe somebody
would say, people may start, I don’t know

31:14.730 --> 31:17.289
what they would do!

31:17.289 --> 31:21.721
Another would just say, “It’s quite nice
day, you see, it’s nice sometimes to also

31:21.721 --> 31:22.721
have hot.

31:22.721 --> 31:23.721
It’s also very good!”

31:23.721 --> 31:24.721
– like that.

31:24.721 --> 31:25.769
If it is cold, the other way round.

31:25.769 --> 31:32.330
So, thus you start enjoying every aspect which
is supposed to be very, very bad for others,

31:32.330 --> 31:38.679
[but] to you, you know the aspect of that,
what is to be enjoyed, that part which is

31:38.679 --> 31:48.090
to be enjoyed, and once you know how to do
it, then you say, “We are swimming in the

31:48.090 --> 31:49.870
Ocean of Joy.”

31:49.870 --> 32:02.710
The Ocean is the same, but now you just achieve
those beautiful drops of ambrosia which are

32:02.710 --> 32:10.080
in that Ocean and the rest are worried of
getting drowned.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.549
Same Ocean!

32:11.549 --> 32:12.549
Same world!

32:12.549 --> 32:16.399
That’s why they say it’s a maya.

32:16.399 --> 32:23.759
But after this discretion is shining there’s
no maya – you start enjoying.

32:23.759 --> 32:31.909
It’s like this, supposing you drop somebody
in the ocean, he’ll be so frightened and

32:31.909 --> 32:35.210
he’ll die before even he’s sunk really!

32:35.210 --> 32:41.289
But supposing a person there is, with all
his things to watch and he is the one who

32:41.289 --> 32:47.029
is going to see all the beauty of the underworld.

32:47.029 --> 32:49.799
He’s very nicely secured.

32:49.799 --> 32:55.490
He’s got big, beautiful glasses and all
that and he’s wearing nice paddles.

32:55.490 --> 32:58.179
He doesn’t have to bother.

32:58.179 --> 33:02.480
He just goes there, nicely enjoys everything,
takes photographs.

33:02.480 --> 33:10.720
The ocean is the same for him or for the one
who is dropped in the ocean.

33:10.720 --> 33:17.750
But the one who is secured, the one who has
all the equipments, the one who knows what

33:17.750 --> 33:21.759
is to be seen is enjoying it.

33:21.759 --> 33:29.480
In the same way, you are equipped with wisdom,
with security and you know what you are doing,

33:29.480 --> 33:34.450
and the same thing starts becoming so very
beautiful and enjoyable.

33:34.450 --> 33:39.080
I have seen how Sahaja Yogis enjoy everything.

33:39.080 --> 33:47.519
Even if somebody is shouting or saying something
in a hall, I’ve seen all the Sahaja Yogis

33:47.519 --> 33:49.830
start laughing, laughing, laughing, you know.

33:49.830 --> 33:55.659
He’s, poor man, trying his level best to
condemn everything, and here all the Sahaja

33:55.659 --> 34:00.220
Yogis – just laughing at him, doing nothing,
and that fellow runs away.

34:00.220 --> 34:07.299
It is something so…I mean they’re enjoying
his stupidity.

34:07.299 --> 34:17.120
So the whole attitude of life is so changed
because of this Hamsa Chakra and you are not

34:17.120 --> 34:22.570
even aware that you have developed that Wisdom…automatically!

34:22.570 --> 34:33.110
Then you start also consolidating it and making
it your own enlightened faith because every

34:33.110 --> 34:42.550
time you see [that] whatever you believe in
just works out.

34:42.550 --> 34:55.501
You see, suddenly you find that things are
brought to you without your knowledge, without

34:55.501 --> 35:00.860
any effort, which you have been trying to
get.

35:00.860 --> 35:04.960
People suddenly meet you and you are helped.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.810
So many things happen.

35:07.810 --> 35:13.230
Recently, somebody came from India and he
had said that, “I would like to meet somebody

35:13.230 --> 35:15.960
at Milan station“.

35:15.960 --> 35:20.790
So we sent somebody, but he was wearing a
very small, little badge so this gentleman

35:20.790 --> 35:29.369
couldn’t see, and he was watching for somebody
there.

35:29.369 --> 35:38.060
Suddenly, he saw one gentleman standing, like
a Sahaja Yogi, very relaxed, watching everybody,

35:38.060 --> 35:40.870
not running, not upset.

35:40.870 --> 35:43.109
He went and asked him, “Did you come for
me?”

35:43.109 --> 35:44.510
“Yes, yes, yes.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.510
I was wondering.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.410
I thought it is you only who has come.”

35:48.410 --> 35:55.920
So, you make them out because their styles
are different, their standing methods are

35:55.920 --> 36:00.180
different, their talking is different, the
way they behave.

36:00.180 --> 36:10.350
It’s all, you see, is a miracle the way
the whole life and personality is changed.

36:10.350 --> 36:20.490
Once my husband had taken a Sahaja Yogi to
a library, a British library and people are

36:20.490 --> 36:21.660
very rude there.

36:21.660 --> 36:25.960
So they were late by about one or two minutes
and it was closing time.

36:25.960 --> 36:29.530
The fellow just started shouting at him.

36:29.530 --> 36:31.020
So the Sahaja Yogi said, “Yes, I agree.

36:31.020 --> 36:36.670
You see, we are late, but these traffics don’t
understand any laws that this library closes

36:36.670 --> 36:38.430
at this time, you know.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.480
They don’t understand – the traffic, you
see.

36:40.480 --> 36:41.869
They wouldn’t listen to us.

36:41.869 --> 36:47.000
We told them the library’s closing, you
see,” Fellow started looking at them!

36:47.000 --> 36:48.641
“But they wouldn’t understand it.

36:48.641 --> 36:49.641
So important.

36:49.641 --> 36:56.440
You know, the traffic was stopping us and
we are sorry we are here so late, but next

36:56.440 --> 36:57.730
time we’ll not do like that.”

36:57.730 --> 37:06.070
The fellow got absolutely so flabbergasted
and the whole thing melted away.

37:06.070 --> 37:07.700
He said, “All right, come along.”

37:07.700 --> 37:13.940
He opened the library for one hour after that.

37:13.940 --> 37:24.240
So the wisdom of handling people, wisdom of
talking to them, wisdom of handling your jobs,

37:24.240 --> 37:26.900
everything starts working out.

37:26.900 --> 37:31.440
And if it doesn’t work, you don’t feel
bad.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.440
You think, “What to do?

37:32.440 --> 37:36.740
The other fellow is not a Sahaja Yogi”.

37:36.740 --> 37:39.420
You tried it’s…what can be done?

37:39.420 --> 37:47.770
Like this time, when we were coming, there
was a nice gentleman who is something like

37:47.770 --> 37:50.220
a manager in the KLM and all that.

37:50.220 --> 37:55.109
So he came and told Me, “There’s a little
difficulty that there’s no seat for others.

37:55.109 --> 37:58.730
Only three persons first class can go.

37:58.730 --> 38:00.150
It’s impossible.

38:00.150 --> 38:01.750
He’s a friend of mine.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.620
He just can’t help you.”

38:03.620 --> 38:05.120
I said, “All right.”

38:05.120 --> 38:06.910
I went and sat on the chair.

38:06.910 --> 38:10.770
I did like this (bandhan) only I think, three
times must have.

38:10.770 --> 38:15.089
“Oh, there are six seats already there!

38:15.089 --> 38:18.880
From where did they come up?”

38:18.880 --> 38:24.440
So then you start seeing one point very clearly
ki (that) there is this All-Pervading Power

38:24.440 --> 38:27.550
which is very active, which is watching us.

38:27.550 --> 38:33.589
All the great saints are managing things.

38:33.589 --> 38:41.450
Or sometimes you feel as if the angels are
with you, how they’re guiding things, how

38:41.450 --> 38:44.930
they’re helping us, how they’re there,
how it is working out.

38:44.930 --> 38:52.270
Then you start seeing all that, then you start
knowing it and believing in it, then this

38:52.270 --> 38:55.720
discretion settles down.

38:55.720 --> 39:02.430
Till that state it is settled down, it’s
quite possible that Sahaja Yogis might slip

39:02.430 --> 39:04.420
out of Sahaja Yoga.

39:04.420 --> 39:09.829
I have known many that, they come to Sahaja
Yoga and just slip out on small, small points

39:09.829 --> 39:11.780
like that.

39:11.780 --> 39:17.839
Some other Sahaja Yogi, of their style only,
can say something harsh to them and they slip

39:17.839 --> 39:18.839
out.

39:18.839 --> 39:23.990
Because on the periphery we have all kinds
of people and on the periphery if you stop

39:23.990 --> 39:29.359
and somebody says something to you, then they
drop out because they have not reached that

39:29.359 --> 39:35.599
state of discretion that, “This is the right
place I’m in.

39:35.599 --> 39:38.850
If another is wrong, he’ll get out.

39:38.850 --> 39:41.870
Why should I get out?”

39:41.870 --> 39:49.470
The growth is only possible when your Hamsa
is put right.

39:49.470 --> 39:55.840
Without that till you are completely there,
it’s very difficult.

39:55.840 --> 40:06.510
But once the Hamsa is established, I have
seen people become really very dedicated.

40:06.510 --> 40:09.980
As you know, it is very big organisation we
have, all over the world.

40:09.980 --> 40:16.870
I have no secretary, I have no organisation,
I have nothing like an office also.

40:16.870 --> 40:23.710
But everything, everybody’s my secretary,
everybody’s working it out on their own.

40:23.710 --> 40:25.680
They’re identified with it.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.210
They are responsible for it.

40:28.210 --> 40:30.619
I don’t have…I’m like a plug, they put
Me here, alright, there, there.

40:30.619 --> 40:34.330
It’s all right wherever they put!

40:34.330 --> 40:40.079
Only this much of discretion, that they’re
my children, they’ll not do anything to

40:40.079 --> 40:43.110
harm Me, they’ll look after Me.

40:43.110 --> 40:52.250
Sometimes, of course, it could be quite hectic,
could be very fast movement, whatever it is,

40:52.250 --> 41:00.290
but I don’t mind because they are doing
so much for Sahaja Yoga and they want to do

41:00.290 --> 41:06.400
it more and more and they are so responsible.

41:06.400 --> 41:10.839
So I respect it.

41:10.839 --> 41:14.349
Sometimes people say, “Mother, what a horrible
schedule You have.

41:14.349 --> 41:16.930
We can’t bear to see it, you see, it is
too much.

41:16.930 --> 41:17.930
How will You do this?”

41:17.930 --> 41:20.430
I can do it!!

41:20.430 --> 41:28.869
Because I have absolute faith in their identification
with Sahaja Yoga.

41:28.869 --> 41:30.290
They are not cheats.

41:30.290 --> 41:31.520
They are not hypocrites.

41:31.520 --> 41:38.100
They’re not doing for their own being, own
self, but they’re doing it to help Sahaja

41:38.100 --> 41:44.340
Yoga, to help others.

41:44.340 --> 41:50.660
So the identification that you develop with
other wrong things just drops out, then you

41:50.660 --> 41:55.940
start identifying yourself with beautiful
things because you start getting the fragrance

41:55.940 --> 41:57.750
of the beauty.

41:57.750 --> 42:05.780
Then you start enjoying that beauty and your
heart starts opening out.

42:05.780 --> 42:17.430
All this joy and all these things are not
possible if your Hamsa is still infected with

42:17.430 --> 42:21.030
ego or with conditionings.

42:21.030 --> 42:26.510
We have so many conditionings like Hindus,
like Christians, like this, like that.

42:26.510 --> 42:31.900
These conditionings are so much.

42:31.900 --> 42:37.300
Such false things we are following.

42:37.300 --> 42:45.210
But once we give up all these conditionings
in the faith that we are doing it for our

42:45.210 --> 42:51.460
benevolence, this Agnya, this chakra opens
out very well.

42:51.460 --> 42:54.920
Without this, Agnya cannot open.

42:54.920 --> 43:02.740
I mean, you see, it’s an entry to Agnya,
it’s the entry to Vishuddhi, it’s the

43:02.740 --> 43:08.230
entry to all the chakras of your head, the
peethas that are there.

43:08.230 --> 43:15.630
So it’s so important to keep your Hamsa
Chakra clean!

43:15.630 --> 43:23.900
I’ve also told lots of things that can keep
the Hamsa Chakra clean, which you all should

43:23.900 --> 43:28.260
use, I mean on the physical level.

43:28.260 --> 43:34.720
Also on the mental level I’ve told you what
you have to do: is to steady your mind, see

43:34.720 --> 43:44.849
the beauty of anything and not the vulgarity
of it, not the utility of it, but the beauty.

43:44.849 --> 43:57.359
Slowly, slowly you’ll find your eyes will
become cleaner and cleaner.

43:57.359 --> 44:07.190
People are now so much in Sahaja Yoga because
of their depth maybe, because of their seeking

44:07.190 --> 44:15.500
maybe, because of their janmas (births) maybe
or whatever it is.

44:15.500 --> 44:24.170
But this Hamsa Chakra does the greatest thing
about which, I do not know if you are aware

44:24.170 --> 44:30.829
or not, that, whatever are your karma phalas
(fruits of your actions) are finished.

44:30.829 --> 44:37.920
You are not responsible for your forefathers
karma phalas, your country’s karma phalas

44:37.920 --> 44:41.490
your own personal karma phalas.

44:41.490 --> 44:53.619
Whatever wrong you have done is finished,
as if you are cut off from your past completely.

44:53.619 --> 45:06.280
Once this is established, then all mistakes,
all wrong-doings, not only of you, of your

45:06.280 --> 45:12.980
relations, of your forefathers, of your family,
of your country, of this world, anything,

45:12.980 --> 45:13.980
doesn’t touch you.

45:13.980 --> 45:18.790
You are aloof from it.

45:18.790 --> 45:30.099
And in this Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya
is

45:30.099 --> 45:39.930
trying to expose and to punish people for
their past karmas – collectively also, country-wise

45:39.930 --> 45:52.059
also – will not be able to even touch you
because the light of this centre is extremely

45:52.059 --> 46:02.880
powerful and you will be redeemed of all the
fears of whatever you have done before.

46:02.880 --> 46:13.589
You’ll just be beautiful like lotuses, which
are come out of the mire, and you’ll emit

46:13.589 --> 46:16.250
beautiful fragrance all around the world.

46:16.250 --> 46:18.829
May God bless you all.
