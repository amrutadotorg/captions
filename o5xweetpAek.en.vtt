00:11.295 --> 00:15.433
Now, the last one should be little more
joyous note we should have,

00:15.634 --> 00:17.699
and it’s a small little drama,

00:17.900 --> 00:20.265
but I think I don’t know how much
they have expanded [it].

00:20.466 --> 00:24.865
Because I just gave them a sort of a,
you can say the framework.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.573
But they said it has now become
international,

00:27.774 --> 00:31.225
so I don’t know how many people
are acting and how it is working out.

00:31.426 --> 00:33.675
But they said that we had to go,

00:33.876 --> 00:38.029
people had to go through the false gurus
to know Mother.

00:38.254 --> 00:43.810
This was their thing they had given Me
and it has worked out well, I think so.

00:44.011 --> 00:50.388
I don’t know what they have done about it.
I just gave them the framework.
