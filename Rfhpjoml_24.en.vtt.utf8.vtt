00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.320
Alright, one. I'll speak for a five minutes.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.020
In a way our European tour

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.040
has now come up to Germany, up to Munich.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.780
And it has to spread out

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.260
to other parts of Germany, it's very essential.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.320
Specially in Bavaria, as I've heard,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.220
there's a lot of orthodoxy.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.860
And also an influence of Catholic Church.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.160
So it was necessary to start

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.000
the German center in Bavaria. In Munich.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.160
But I'm so happy the way you all have come here

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.780
and the way we have worked it out,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.040
that we have really changed the vibrations of this place. I felt,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.780
when I came here, I felt the vibrations were not so good,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.880
and many other people have used this place, I was told.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.900
But I find you all have changed the vibrations and things are

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.540
much better here. That's how,  the more you travel,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.220
the more you go, the more you talk to people,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.860
the better it is, for them, to see how vibrations change

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.360
and to feel the goodness of the saints coming in their

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.100
own glory.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.660
And the saints are recognized

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.180
by the change of the atmosphere.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.460
Now, I was thinking about, when you are going to Andorra,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.660
so many of you will be going by buses.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.840
And you can, on your buses, have

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.680
big posters put up, or maybe banners put up.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.880
You can have the photographs, you can wear the badges,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.640
you can stop at some village, some place, talk to people,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.420
sing the song. All that will change the atmosphere all the way,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.740
wherever you travel. Now the time to keep quiet has gone.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.200
Now we have to talk, we have to sing,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.140
we have to show that we are quite capable people.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.540
And that we can express ourselves

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.340
beautifully in a dignified manner.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.420
For example, it's nice when we are together in privacy

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.020
under a beautiful tent like this.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.660
We can dance, we can enjoy ourselves.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.640
But when we are outside, facing the public,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.920
we have to sing, but with dignity.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.100
That's the discretion part of it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.420
And here, we have to all enjoy among themselves, jumping,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.220
laughing, everything is there.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.680
But outside world thinks that a saint should be

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.520
a very serious personality.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.620
Even to Me they said, "Mother, is there any photograph,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.140
where You are not smiling?"

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.580
I said, "I don't know. Maybe, some of them.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.820
Quite angry also sometimes."

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.360
So they said. I said, "Why?"
"Because in America nobody likes

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.820
a saint to smile."
I said, "Really?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.260
Is it, that all the rest of the people should smile and enjoy,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.600
and the saint should sit sulking?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.840
Is that what they expect saint to do?"

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.460
Saint should be the one who should be smiling and laughing.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.680
But they haven't come to that stage of understanding

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.620
that the joy is the right of a saint

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.140
and not of an ordinary person.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.520
So when... I mean we need not look sulking and unhappy.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.020
But we need not be very exuberant with our expressions.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.040
So this is how things will work out. But I love to see you

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.180
dancing and enjoying, your body rippling with vibrations

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.160
and everything feeling so nice. It looks so nice and

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.140
everything you can express through your own body.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.660
The joy that you are feeling.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.420
Despite all that, sometimes

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.820
we find that there are some people,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.920
who cannot get over their sickening unhappiness.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.400
And they look so funny and absurd in a group of people

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.580
who are so joyous. So I have to warn all of you,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.340
because I had a case of a lady, who was from India.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.220
And she was married. Her husband was a very fine man,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.260
very happy person, very joyous and a good person.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.460
But this lady refused to assimilate herself with that group,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.740
with that society, with everything. And she just kept out.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.320
All the time. And was trying to show that she was very unhappy.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.320
She could not mix up, she could not be collective.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.520
As a result she had to go back. She has created a problem for me.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.420
But still she can't get over her stupid ideas.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.980
About her so-called unhappiness,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.140
so-called separation from her family maybe,

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.880
or so-called calamities,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.640
which are no more for a Sahaja yogi.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.600
So I have to request you that - come to your joyous condition.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.060
Be happy, that you are in that condition.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.640
Thank God, that nonsense of unhappiness is gone.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.520
That is how you can see so many miracles.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.760
You can see so many good things happening in your life.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.720
But if you are a crying baby,

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.480
and if you are always complaining, and you look so miserable,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.720
as if the whole world is falling upon you,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.640
then the whole world will fall.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.640
You have asked for it, alright! Have it.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.180
You see, all the Ganas are waiting to do, what you want.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.860
Now, you want misery? Alright! Have it.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.720
On a plate they'll give you the miseries. But if you want

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.160
to be happy, they are there to make you happy.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.760
So it's important for you to understand that we have to be

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.940
very, very happy, joyous people,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.680
welcoming what Sahaja yoga has given us.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.760
And not to be serious, unhappy, complaining, nonsensical.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.180
You are above all these things. If we cannot rise above this,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.400
then what will happen? That you'll go down,

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.380
down, and down, and down.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.480
I love to see all the Sahaja yogis enjoying music,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.260
dancing, singing. Because you are in another world.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.200
You have got rid of all that was nonsensical.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.380
All that is fallen off now. If it has not fallen,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.580
that means you need more maturity. You have to come up.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.120
If you are still serious, thinking "what, this, that," then

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.320
you require some more meditation. Shoe-beating, all kinds of things.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.760
You have to treat yourself. But you have to be in joy.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.900
All the time in joy.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.740
In joy you do not have unhappiness or happiness.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.180
It's just joy. Absolute joy.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.680
I cannot keep Myself even serious for more than one minute.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.900
I try to be serious. It's difficult.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.380
Because so much joy bubbling all the time that

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.860
I find it difficult to show that I'm not very happy

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.440
or I'm angry. Even anger is difficult to [pretend?].

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.580
So I would request you to be completely lost in the ocean of joy.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.680
Give up all your conditionings, all your nonsensical ideas.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.940
Just be joyous and be happy with yourself

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.520
and with all the rest of the Sahaja yogis and with Me.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.020
So this is the greatest discretion today, we have to learn

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.340
is to be joyous and happy. Are we happy? Are we joyous?

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.660
Or are we complaining? If you are complaining,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.180
if you are sitting like this, then you are not a Sahaja yogi.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.860
If you don't how to smile and laugh, then you are not a Sahaja yogi.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.680
Absolutely. Whatever you may say, you are not a Sahaja yogi.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.300
You must always have a smile on your face all the time

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.160
and you should be happy people. Not artificially,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.940
but from within. If you are not felt it as yet,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.700
better go into meditation, work it out.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.080
See that you don't feel guilty, see that you don't feel unhappy.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.800
Now, those who feel unhappy among you,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.060
please raise your hands.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.160
Thank you for this.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.780
Ah. Alright.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.660
Nothing like laughing.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.340
Laughs is the greatest correction.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.020
You'll laugh at yourself, you'll laugh at others.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.800
Don't make others look ridiculous,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.060
but just enjoy the way others are

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.960
and enjoy each other.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.180
They are all very beautiful people, very beautiful.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.320
It's like one beautiful flower is enjoying

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.900
the fragrance of another beautiful flower.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.720
That's what should be. One should not feel

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.180
that, "Oh, look at this flower it's so beautiful." Look at yourself!

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.580
You are so beautiful too. But unless and until you enjoy

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.540
the fragrance and the beauty of another flower, you cannot know,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.540
what you are. Because you are all just the same inside.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.940
You are all people, who's Spirit has come into their attention.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.440
Wonderful people, certified yogis.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.880
See, you all have got the light on your head. If you want to see,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.240
we have a photograph to show that you are certified yogis.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.040
And on top of your head, all of you, there's the light.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.540
So you're already certified by every camera, that you are yogis.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.940
Now whatever you may try, it is so. You're already certified.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.200
So for certified people, it's not proper to take other certificates.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.840
May God bless you all.
