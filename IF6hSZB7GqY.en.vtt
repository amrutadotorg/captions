00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.207
With love all kinds of creative action takes place.

00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:12.270
You see how Raulbai has love for Me

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:21.367
and in this place you all also got new
ideas of creating a beautiful thing.

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:28.350
And as love will increase, your creativity
will develop.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.731
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati, is love.

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:39.472
If there is no love there’s no creativity.

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.878
It’s even in the deeper sense, if you see.

00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:47.768
People who have created all the scientific things

00:00:47.793 --> 00:00:51.893
are also out of love for the masses,
not for themselves.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:54.820
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:57.239
If they make something for themselves

00:00:57.264 --> 00:01:01.515
it has to become for universal use,
otherwise it has no meaning.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.812
Even if you say atom bomb
and all these things that are created from science,

00:01:05.837 --> 00:01:08.572
they are also very protective.

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:13.968
If they had not created those, people would
not have taken out their minds from war.

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:17.085
Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.228
Of course, they are having cold wars,

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:22.921
but that also will gradually stop, when
they will be fed up of it.

00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:26.960
So, all the activity on the right hand
side, of Saraswati,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.453
basically has to end up in love; starts
with love and ends up in love.

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:37.368
Whichever does not end up in love coils
up and finishes off.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:39.067
It just disappears.

00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:44.249
So you can see that even matter, which is
not used for love,

00:01:44.298 --> 00:01:48.570
just finishes off. The basis has to be love.

00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:53.733
Otherwise all such matter that we create
which has angularity,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.784
which is not fitting into the mass media,
which is not appealing to the masses.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.706
Of course, it takes time, you have seen
that it takes time -

00:02:04.908 --> 00:02:11.053
but it does have that tendency always
to disappear in the thin air

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.951
as soon as you find it does not appeal
to the masses.

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:20.905
Now this love of, that we talk of, this
great love of God we talk of,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.569
we know it for definite through vibrations.

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:26.696
People do not have vibrations,

00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:32.315
but still they can feel the vibrations
in a very unconscious way.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:35.795
All the great paintings of the world have vibrations.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.313
All the great creative works of the world have vibrations.

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:43.705
Only those who have vibrations have been
sustained by time,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.178
otherwise all other things are destroyed.

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:50.360
There must have been monuments
and horrible statues and horrible things

00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:52.654
that have been created long time back.

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:57.580
But [they] were all destroyed by nature,
and they could not stand

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:04.765
the impact of the Kala - that is
the destructive power of time.

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:12.072
So, all that is sustaining, all that
is nurturing, all that is en-nobling,

00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:18.862
comes from this sense of love, which is
within us very much developed,

00:03:18.887 --> 00:03:22.881
but within others also, who are not yet realized.

00:03:22.906 --> 00:03:25.576
Ultimately the whole world has to realize

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:31.936
that one has to go to that ultimate love
of God, otherwise it has no meaning.

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:36.031
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods

00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:40.474
of appealing to people by using cheap
things and very vulgar things,

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.797
just to make people think that this is art.
But this will all disappear.

00:03:44.994 --> 00:03:50.143
It cannot sustain the impact of the time
as I told you, it cannot.

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:53.241
Because the time will kill it. All these
things have to disappear

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:55.243
and already you can see the result,

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.661
how things are changing everywhere,
even in the West.

00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:02.435
So there is no need to be so much
disappointed with the West

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.797
and to say that the Western world is a wasteland.

00:04:05.822 --> 00:04:09.816
It is going to be alright and it has to be done.

00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:14.490
Especially it has done lot of Puja
of Saraswati, I should say, in the West.

00:04:14.615 --> 00:04:18.570
Much more than they have done in India
because they have gone to learning

00:04:18.595 --> 00:04:21.449
and they have tried to find out so many things.

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:25.738
But only thing they forgot that it is
a Goddess, Goddess of Learning.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.963
Everything comes from the Goddess.
That’s what they’ve forgotten.

00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:31.529
And that’'s why all the problems have been created.

00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:35.326
If there is no Spirit in your learning,
if there is no source

00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.749
of the Goddess in your learning, then it is
absolutely useless.

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:44.344
If they had realized that there is
the Spirit that is working it out,

00:04:44.488 --> 00:04:47.886
they would not have gone that far.

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:52.075
And that’s what I was warning the Indians, all through,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.623
that you are now taking to industrial
revolution in a way

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:59.260
and to avoid all the complications
of industrial revolution,

00:04:59.477 --> 00:05:03.100
you must try to know the Spirit.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:07.487
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have.

00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:10.434
Because they are also human beings, you are
also human beings.

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.548
You will also go the same way. At random
you will run

00:05:13.573 --> 00:05:18.123
and there will be problems, the same
problems as the Western people have.

00:05:18.322 --> 00:05:24.890
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:30.124
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible

00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:34.479
to tell them even in one lecture, even
in ten lectures.

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:40.338
But how we go against Surya and how we go
against Saraswati,

00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:44.943
while doing the worship of Saraswati, is
to be seen very clearly within ourselves.

00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:48.371
For example the Western people are very
fond of Surya

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:53.051
because they have no Surya within. But
they go too far with it, as you know,

00:05:53.076 --> 00:05:56.721
and create complications within themselves of Surya.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.623
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within,

00:06:03.903 --> 00:06:11.586
is the light within. And if Surya chakra
at the Agnya level

00:06:11.611 --> 00:06:17.251
is occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then it is
even more essential

00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:27.417
that the purity of life, what we call
‘Niti’, is the morality of life.

00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:34.000
Now morality itself has become very much
sort of an argument in the West.

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:38.281
People don't have any sense of absolute morality.

00:06:38.374 --> 00:06:43.435
On vibrations of course you know. But
they have gone all against it.

00:06:43.524 --> 00:06:48.931
Those who are the worshippers of Jesus,
those who are the worshippers of the Surya,

00:06:49.132 --> 00:06:53.473
of the Saraswati have all gone against it.

00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:58.681
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying it.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.928
Because you cannot be a Surya if you do not have

00:07:03.144 --> 00:07:07.164
a proper sense of morality and holiness.

00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:12.987
The Surya itself brings light, to see
everything clearly.

00:07:13.093 --> 00:07:15.646
So many qualities Surya has got.

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:22.202
It dries up everything that is wet, dirty, filthy.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:26.612
It dries up all these places, which create parasites.

00:07:26.734 --> 00:07:29.489
But so many parasites are created in the West.

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:33.706
Not only parasites, but there are horrible
cults and horrible things

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:41.191
which have come into those countries
which is supposed to be full of light.

00:07:41.352 --> 00:07:48.809
And in that darkness they exist: darkness
about their Spirit,

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:54.261
darkness about their own knowledge
and darkness about love.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.836
These three things have taken over in the places

00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.506
where you are supposed to love light.
Light doesn’t mean,

00:08:01.531 --> 00:08:05.516
light doesn’t mean what you see with your gross eyes.

00:08:05.541 --> 00:08:09.625
Light means from within - the Light of Love.

00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:13.265
That one should understand - Light of Love.

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:18.358
And it's so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:24.621
it’s so abounding that unless and until
you can feel that light within you -

00:08:24.885 --> 00:08:29.443
that light which is of pure love, of purity,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.579
pure relationships, pure understanding.

00:08:32.728 --> 00:08:38.238
If you can develop that kind of a light within yourself,

00:08:39.034 --> 00:08:43.116
then the whole thing will be cleansed.

00:08:43.141 --> 00:08:48.681
'Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.'

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:53.154
This is what happens to you when you are
completely cleansed.

00:08:53.269 --> 00:09:01.815
The purest form of nature is within us.
The purest form of nature is within us.

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:06.598
Our chakras are made out of that purest
form of nature.

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:10.944
We are the only people who are spoiling it
by our mental thinking.

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:15.284
Again the same Saraswati’s work. You are
going against Saraswati itself.

00:09:15.358 --> 00:09:20.087
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,

00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:24.649
while, with our brain activity, we are
spoiling all that.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:31.481
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

00:09:31.935 --> 00:09:36.781
And that’s what one has to understand -
that this pure intelligence,

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:43.181
is not to be soiled by our thinking. Our
thinking can make us so bumptious,

00:09:43.405 --> 00:09:54.036
so ego-oriented, so impure, that we can
really eat the poison

00:09:54.134 --> 00:09:58.819
and say 'what is wrong with it'?
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

00:09:58.997 --> 00:10:03.722
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us
Subuddhi, wisdom.

00:10:03.962 --> 00:10:07.435
And that is why to worship Saraswati,
to worship Surya

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.128
we must have that clear vision as to
what we have to be,

00:10:11.153 --> 00:10:16.758
what we are doing, what filth we are
living in, what our mind is getting into.

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:21.406
After all, we are here for emancipation
and not for just for pampering our ego

00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:24.592
and living with our filth that is with us.

00:10:24.617 --> 00:10:29.441
So this light has come within us and we
should try to rise above

00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:36.580
our own mental filth, which is being
created around us.

00:10:36.893 --> 00:10:43.656
Apart from that, you have to go higher
and understand

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:50.100
that there is, within us, a thing called ego.

00:10:50.372 --> 00:10:53.880
And this ego is false, absolutely false.
You do not do anything.

00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:56.866
Actually when you turn your eyes here and there,

00:10:56.891 --> 00:11:02.587
when your attention is here and there
it is nothing but your ego is trying to overpower everyone.

00:11:02.612 --> 00:11:07.368
But actually, ego is an absolute falsehood

00:11:07.558 --> 00:11:13.747
because there is only one ego and that is
of God Almighty, Mahat-Ahamkara.

00:11:13.908 --> 00:11:19.748
There is no really any ego that exists. It's myth.

00:11:19.797 --> 00:11:24.195
It's a very big myth, because if you start
thinking you are doing everything -

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.952
you are doing this, you are doing that -
which you are not doing;

00:11:27.977 --> 00:11:32.530
then this nonsensical ego comes in an
you start working it out,

00:11:32.555 --> 00:11:34.643
it can project in every direction.

00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:38.975
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,

00:11:39.116 --> 00:11:44.883
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill
others, becomes cruel.

00:11:44.973 --> 00:11:49.191
When it moves [to the] right side,
it becomes supraconscious.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.165
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,
which are foolish, which are stupid.

00:11:54.269 --> 00:12:01.657
When it moves left side then it starts
talking - I mean, seeing things -

00:12:01.682 --> 00:12:08.520
yourself as a big man, as a big Christ
or as a big Devi

00:12:08.545 --> 00:12:13.082
or something like Adi Gurus and 'I am a very
great personality' - that is left sided.

00:12:13.136 --> 00:12:16.153
When it moves backwards, that is
the dangerous one.

00:12:16.193 --> 00:12:21.112
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people.

00:12:21.345 --> 00:12:24.749
When their ego moves backwards then they
become gurus,

00:12:24.774 --> 00:12:27.291
they themselves have lots of defects in themselves

00:12:27.316 --> 00:12:30.705
and they try to pull people into those horrible stuff,

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.546
which is described as absolute Naraka.

00:12:34.724 --> 00:12:38.465
That’s how, is the movement of ego
on all the sides.

00:12:38.572 --> 00:12:43.738
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi

00:12:43.873 --> 00:12:47.443
that is to talk about themselves,
is the worst of all.

00:12:47.597 --> 00:12:50.447
Whatever type of ego you may have,

00:12:50.568 --> 00:12:55.362
if you start boasting about it and talking
about it, then it encircles,

00:12:55.418 --> 00:13:01.486
thickens the walls of ego so much, that
it is impossible to penetrate into that.

00:13:01.664 --> 00:13:05.108
Because such a person is completely
satisfied with himself

00:13:05.133 --> 00:13:10.364
and he believes that he is so. And once he
starts believing into a nonsense like that,

00:13:10.402 --> 00:13:14.765
it's an impossibility, is an impossibility
to penetrate.

00:13:14.846 --> 00:13:21.446
So, when you boast about these things
or you talk big, be careful.

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:26.245
You see, you know what I am, but how many
times do I say 'I am that'?

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.399
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous
vibrations for you.

00:13:30.578 --> 00:13:35.469
But how many times do I say so?
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.169
But I don't say that.

00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:40.318
If I say it loudly, I don't know what may happen.

00:13:40.343 --> 00:13:43.064
The whole thing might be blasted with truth.

00:13:43.227 --> 00:13:47.118
So, one has to understand that
Mahat-Ahamkara is the one

00:13:47.143 --> 00:13:51.367
that acts, that works, that creates???.
Sometimes I shout at you.

00:13:51.392 --> 00:13:54.313
Immediately all the bhoots run away.
Just once I shout.

00:13:54.338 --> 00:13:57.866
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were
coughing, they all ran away.

00:13:57.891 --> 00:14:01.702
Yesterday just I started. So you should understand

00:14:01.727 --> 00:14:04.771
that now you are a realized souls, you can
also do the same.

00:14:04.796 --> 00:14:07.293
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,

00:14:07.318 --> 00:14:10.570
‘‘Now will you please stop boasting,
will you stop talking all this nonsense,

00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:15.423
will you stop showing off!'' Then it will stop.

00:14:15.576 --> 00:14:23.782
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active,

00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:27.327
who want to do something about it. Not that
they are not active, they want to do it.

00:14:27.352 --> 00:14:30.909
But they know only one way, is to act
through talking.

00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:34.277
They don't understand that there are inner ways

00:14:34.362 --> 00:14:38.583
by which you control it much more.

00:14:38.704 --> 00:14:43.247
Because they don't want to take to that,
they take to this talking.

00:14:43.504 --> 00:14:49.085
And once they take to talking and they talk
about it, the whole power flows away.

00:14:49.294 --> 00:14:53.439
But if they do not talk about it and keep
it within themselves.

00:14:53.782 --> 00:14:57.010
It’s alright, you can tell Me about your
experiences or anything,

00:14:57.035 --> 00:15:00.377
but if you start telling others, and
talking about it too much,

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:05.063
then the powers that you have got will be
all disappearing gradually from you.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.442
And you will just come down to absolutely lowest level.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.853
So one should not too much talk that,
“I have this power,

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:16.386
I have this power” or “I see this” or
“I do this,”

00:15:16.424 --> 00:15:20.891
which is a very wrong thing. I warn you,
don’t try to show off.

00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:23.552
Yes, you can talk about My powers.
It's all right.

00:15:23.737 --> 00:15:26.666
But don't try to talk about your powers.

00:15:26.868 --> 00:15:31.708
When it comes, of course, to talk
to somebody who is a negative person

00:15:31.827 --> 00:15:35.278
or to tell somebody, then you should say
that “we”, not “I”.

00:15:35.472 --> 00:15:41.532
“We” have, some of us have felt this power
within ourselves. We have seen people”.

00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:46.359
It may be you only, but you need not say,
'I' have. What you have to say is 'We'.

00:15:46.703 --> 00:15:52.756
Then you become the Mahat-Ahamkara. When
you say 'We', Yes, some of us', 'we do'.

00:15:52.997 --> 00:15:57.110
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it,
I saw to it,

00:15:57.135 --> 00:16:00.619
that he should not have many 'I's',
but he should have 'We'.

00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:04.674
'We think', 'we do', 'we'. Means, the whole
collective being,

00:16:04.699 --> 00:16:09.541
the whole collective organism, living
organism of Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:09.776 --> 00:16:12.221
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',

00:16:12.246 --> 00:16:15.449
that means, you put yourself down,
but put all others above you.

00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:18.332
Say: 'Yes, some of us have. I know some
people have this.'

00:16:18.357 --> 00:16:23.115
That’'s the way one should do it. Because
if you have to overpower your ego,

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.740
you must allow it to spread into everybody else.

00:16:27.824 --> 00:16:31.353
That’s how you will make it perfectly
all right, to make it spread.

00:16:31.378 --> 00:16:35.144
“We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all”.
But that pride is not there.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.710
I've seen that pride is not there.
Still it is very individualistic.

00:16:38.735 --> 00:16:43.017
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens,

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:46.317
that you become one personality,
one organization.

00:16:46.342 --> 00:16:49.729
But the person will look down upon
other people.

00:16:49.835 --> 00:16:55.203
He will see that this person is low, that
person is higher, that person is there.

00:16:55.397 --> 00:16:59.256
But he will not think, "'We' the Sahaja
Yogis, how beautiful we are.

00:16:59.456 --> 00:17:02.665
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga, how beautiful we are."

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:09.851
So always think in the words of 'we',

00:17:10.084 --> 00:17:14.917
so your ego will become much less,
much less, much less.

00:17:14.942 --> 00:17:18.692
And the same ego, which looked so funny
and absurd,

00:17:18.862 --> 00:17:23.727
will form tomorrow the Ekadesha.

00:17:25.371 --> 00:17:30.368
Today’s individual ego will merge into Ekadesha.

00:17:30.569 --> 00:17:35.797
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

00:17:35.892 --> 00:17:40.714
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change,

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:44.695
because the Sun has changed its mood, now.
Sun is coming this side.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.652
So let us welcome the Sun, coming
to the North now, this way.

00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:55.008
And for Australians to say that though
the Sun has gone,

00:17:55.033 --> 00:18:00.072
let us establish the Sun, the domain
of Sun, within ourselves.

00:18:00.275 --> 00:18:03.000
Because Sun never disappears
from our inside.

00:18:03.089 --> 00:18:08.020
So that is how we have to take a mood
by which we should think

00:18:08.045 --> 00:18:12.007
of one personality, all of us together,
all of us together.

00:18:12.032 --> 00:18:17.901
And anybody who tries to be something
separate or different, he will drop out.

00:18:17.926 --> 00:18:21.028
I will drop him out. Whatever it may be,
it will drop out.

00:18:21.053 --> 00:18:25.292
So you just don’t worry: anybody who tries
to be singled out or anything.

00:18:25.317 --> 00:18:29.128
Everybody must do whatever they like,
to nurture the whole,

00:18:29.153 --> 00:18:32.435
to help the whole, to emancipate the whole.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.482
But not to, in anyway, put anyone down. Always.

00:18:37.693 --> 00:18:41.493
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga is.

00:18:41.518 --> 00:18:44.059
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

00:18:44.084 --> 00:18:48.803
And the one who has developed
this permeating spirit,

00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:52.178
is a real Sahaja Yogi. Who has not, is not!

00:18:52.203 --> 00:18:55.610
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:59.255
But this permeating personality, which
moves from places to places,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.100
whether you talk or not. Like your Mother is.

00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:05.207
Whether I meet you or not, makes
no difference, but I am permeating

00:19:05.232 --> 00:19:09.718
through all of you, by little, little
things, also, I am there with you.

00:19:09.891 --> 00:19:13.973
So like that, try to permeate into each
other and see the beauty.

00:19:13.998 --> 00:19:18.418
And you’ll enjoy yourself the best because
that is the biggest thing.

00:19:18.635 --> 00:19:21.559
That's the biggest thing that is
to be achieved.

00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:27.501
Because this ego you know makes you like a
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport

00:19:27.526 --> 00:19:33.463
with that beauty of permeation and just see
how the notes move into each other.

00:19:33.488 --> 00:19:38.771
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today we are having Puja in Dhulia.

00:19:39.484 --> 00:19:43.452
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

00:19:43.478 --> 00:19:48.541
And one day I had written in childhood,
a poem, I remember.

00:19:48.566 --> 00:19:51.710
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know
whether it is lost -

00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:56.276
but which said that, "I want to be like
a dust particle

00:19:56.392 --> 00:20:00.212
which moves with the wind. It goes everywhere.

00:20:00.237 --> 00:20:06.136
Can go, sit on the head of a king, or can
go and fall at the feet of someone.

00:20:06.319 --> 00:20:12.499
And it can go and sit on a little flower,
and it can go and sit everywhere.

00:20:12.692 --> 00:20:17.321
But I want to be a particle of dust
that is fragrant,

00:20:17.498 --> 00:20:21.959
that is nourishing, that is enlightening."

00:20:22.232 --> 00:20:24.628
Like that, I had written a very beautiful poem,

00:20:24.653 --> 00:20:28.922
I must have been about seven years of age,
I remember - 'To be a dust particle',

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:33.038
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

00:20:33.063 --> 00:20:39.399
that "I should be a dust particle so that
I’ll permeate into people."

00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:43.383
Which is a very big thing - to become
a dust particle of that kind.

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:48.006
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes enlivened,

00:20:48.199 --> 00:20:55.982
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

00:20:56.167 --> 00:21:00.411
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:05.160
At that young age, I had this idea
of becoming a dust particle

00:21:05.227 --> 00:21:10.213
and today just while talking to you,
I remembered that I wanted to be that,

00:21:10.238 --> 00:21:14.058
and that is what this place is.
And Raulbai is like that.

00:21:14.257 --> 00:21:17.311
She’s a very simple woman, very simple woman,

00:21:17.433 --> 00:21:23.233
and she lives like a very simple person but
she has a sense of permeation.

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:26.923
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis,
yesterday who came.

00:21:26.948 --> 00:21:29.540
I am sure that they will take up Sahaja
Yoga very well.

00:21:29.565 --> 00:21:34.797
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from
Dhulia now,

00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:37.224
and I am sure there are going to be more people.

00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:40.532
I hope you have met all of them. Make
friends with all of them.

00:21:40.557 --> 00:21:43.630
Try to know them who they are. They may
not know English -

00:21:43.655 --> 00:21:47.656
so get somebody to translate. Talk to them
and be nice to them,

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:51.360
be friendly with them. I wanted you to meet
them for permeation.

00:21:51.385 --> 00:21:54.474
You should know who are the people here,
who are in Nasik.

00:21:54.499 --> 00:21:57.652
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja
Yogis, you see,

00:21:57.677 --> 00:22:00.480
who are in that particular place, and
when we go back

00:22:00.505 --> 00:22:03.094
we have only one or two addresses.
It is not a good idea.

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:08.569
Try to see how many people there are.
Ask questions about them, and all that.

00:22:08.594 --> 00:22:13.900
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around,

00:22:14.059 --> 00:22:18.524
and this is the way to overcome
the problems of the right side

00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:20.935
and that is how to worship Saraswati.

00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:23.530
Because Saraswati has a veena in Her hand

00:22:23.555 --> 00:22:27.672
and that veena is the primordial
instrument, which She plays

00:22:27.697 --> 00:22:30.618
like music, and the music penetrates
into the heart.

00:22:30.643 --> 00:22:33.269
You don't know how it goes into you and how
it works out.

00:22:33.294 --> 00:22:38.410
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi

00:22:38.435 --> 00:22:41.244
should permeate like music into other people.

00:22:41.448 --> 00:22:46.225
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

00:22:46.419 --> 00:22:54.322
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things.

00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:59.813
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.929
Music will end up into melodies,

00:23:03.954 --> 00:23:07.662
like that whatever She creates ends up
into something greater.

00:23:07.687 --> 00:23:11.715
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up
into aesthetics.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.153
If matter does not have aesthetics then it is gross.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.913
Like that everything. Now you will say,
"What is water?"

00:23:18.938 --> 00:23:24.545
Water becomes the river Ganges.
These are the subtler [things].

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.804
So the matter gets into subtler thing
because it has to permeate,

00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:33.271
it has to permeate. So everything
whatever it is.

00:23:33.388 --> 00:23:40.096
And the best of all is the air -that air
becomes the vibrations.

00:23:43.138 --> 00:23:47.310
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from this matter,

00:23:47.335 --> 00:23:52.676
from these five elements, becomes that subtle thing.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.953
Of course, the left and right side both
work it out because the love

00:23:58.185 --> 00:24:04.744
has to work on this and when love acts
on matter it becomes that,

00:24:04.922 --> 00:24:08.320
and that is how one has to look at your own lives,

00:24:08.345 --> 00:24:15.140
to make it a beautiful combination of love and matter.

00:24:15.286 --> 00:24:18.213
May God bless you!

00:24:19.096 --> 00:24:21.924
(Marathi)
