00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.795
Today we are going to worship the Devi,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.956
we call her Amba, and by many other
names.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.474
She is the last, we should say, the
''residual power''

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.513
When she has done everything

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.393
she becomes the Kundalini

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.676
and settles in the triangular bone of yours.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.359
This is the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:17.388
But actually she is expressed more on the
left side,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.310
because that time she is purely the Amba.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.114
This left side is a very, very important

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.510
thing for all the human beings.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.118
lf you have no left side,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.109
you cannot balance yourself, to begin
with.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:00.518
And it is said that she gives you a real
personality

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.478
of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.515
That is, your left side, if it is weak,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.870
then you have to worship her;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.752
and request her that ''Please enrich our
left side''.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.470
By enriching your left side,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.710
what she does, she is a comforter,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.470
So, what does she give you? First of all,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.155
she makes you rest.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.755
lt is said that she makes you rest.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.990
That is, she makes you sleep.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.993
lf you are too much thinking about future

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.758
and you are so much indulging into the
futuristic planning,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.637
you have some problems;

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.395
but the best thing is if you can sleep,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.195
then it is a great comfort,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.871
it is a very great comfort to you that you
can sleep

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.915
and that you can take some rest.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.196
Without her you cannot sleep:

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.189
absence of her, you cannot sleep.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.470
So sleeping is a very important function of
the body,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.470
which is brought forth by the left side.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.910
That's why we worship her,

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.632
because she should give us rest.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.635
She's the one who gives you peace;

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:07.879
She's the one who gives you also
illusions,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.634
called as Bhranti.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.036
She gives you all the artistic talents,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.316
she protects you.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.592
But this part that she is creating illusions
for you

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.074
that's very, very important.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.633
Because those people who are against
Divine,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.553
who are trying to be away from the reality,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.638
she creates illusions for them.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.315
So she separates you from those people,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.516
while you know the reality

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.873
and all such people who are troubling or

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.150
trying to destroy her work

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.150
She is the one who creates illusions.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.913
She is the one who resides as the
Kundalini.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:37.317
So we can say that part of her is the
Kundalini,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.631
but another part that she has

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.350
is the one which resides in the left side.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:02.671
Now there are seven levels

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.669
which she resides.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.153
Once you start enjoying her on the first
level,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.791
then She has all these qualities described
to you.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.591
That She is peace,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.353
She is the one who gives you love,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:40.075
She is the one who creates all the
beautiful things for you.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.870
She is the Mother.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.354
And what She expects you is to enjoy her
protection,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:07:00.549
enjoy her love and be always under her
complete protection.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.756
So this is a very important part of her
work.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.509
And the second one is that She is the
Kundalini.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.278
So She also acts on seven levels.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.433
Seven levels She moves, we can say
horizontally,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.837
and seven levels she moves upward.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.389
And all these seven levels, on both of the
sides.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.354
She does tremendous work for us.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.235
How she protects us through these seven
levels, is like this,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.198
that even if you start going towards the
left side,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.959
there are seven Deities

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.433
which try to throw you back into normalcy.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.433
There are Shankini, Dhankini, these are
the names.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:19.471
And by that you try to come to normal
conditions.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.876
Now for example, many psychosomatic
diseases

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.798
which come to us, like cancer and so
many others;

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:38.952
psychosomatic means it is physical as
well as it is emotional.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.878
So these psychosomatic troubles

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.874
start coming from the left side.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.832
Sometimes you are too much on the right
side,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.277
then suddenly you are thrown to the left
side, suddenly.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.557
And then the movement like a pendulum,
you can go any far.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.436
But there are seven powers on the
left-hand side

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.237
which protect you from getting into these
diseases;

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:19.397
also reducing their intensity.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.837
So at one time, she is the one who is
peace giving,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.029
she is the one who looks after you and
protects you,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.828
and she is the one who saves you

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.516
from psychosomatic diseases.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.637
ls a very powerful entity.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.315
lf she was not there l don't know what
would have happened.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.995
So we should worship her within
ourselves.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.829
We should respect her, and understand
her;

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.638
she is your Mother.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.518
As Kundalini she is your particular Mother.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.358
She is the one, Amba,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.754
who gives you your second birth.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:35.709
And as the left side goddess

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:44.753
she gives you a very good support in your
ascent.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.593
A very good support in your ascent.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.390
Without her you could not balance
yourself.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.000
This goes too far sometimes

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.479
when people are too much on the right
side.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.910
Then they get diseases which are very
funny.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.312
They can get heart-attack, they can get
paralysis.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.228
They also get the right side completely
paralysed.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.950
They can't walk, they can't lift themselves.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.479
This is too much of right side movement.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:34.390
So then she is the one who makes you
feel bad about it.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.951
She is the one who suggests that you
give up your right side

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.877
and take more to the left side.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.195
So that doesn't mean that right side,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.314
if it is cured by the left side, it is very good.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.878
For example, a person who is very
arrogant, egotistical,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.911
such a man may become absolutely
docile,

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.832
and people might think he is cured.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.278
No. He is on the left side.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.198
Though he has become docile, still he is
not normal.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.798
Still he is very much wrong because he is
on the left side.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.119
On the left side one starts getting many
diseases

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.036
like schizophrenia, on the upper level of
this group.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.030
This side these same seven centres

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.672
act to give you very serious troubles.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.475
One of them is that people become
schizophrenic.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.548
lt can be cured; it can be cured if you can

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.993
move that person to the centre.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.753
And by Kundalini awakening you can do
it.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.438
Then people also become mad, lunatic.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.069
But all the troubles of the right side
disappear.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.468
Such people who have moved to the left
side

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.911
won't have liver problems.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.993
They might have enlarged liver,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.675
but over-active liver they won't have.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.989
They won't have other symptoms like
asthma, hear-attack.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.957
They cannot have heart attack.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.072
They'll give heart attacks to others

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.988
but they themselves don't get heart
attacks.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.157
So this

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.953
sudden movement of your attention into
the left side

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.039
is all the time guarded by these seven
entities,

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.159
or goddesses,who look after you.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.510
But still if you go on with it:

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.148
for example you go to the false gurus;

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.034
then what do the false gurus do?

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.352
They put you to your left side.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.158
They'll give you a name, some name,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.074
it could be the name of a servant, or
anyone

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.479
whom they have captured and whom they
are looking after

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.636
as a kind of a possession for others.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.594
This is tantrika, they people possess

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.193
the spirits of these dead people

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.797
and use them to entice you.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:55.396
So when you start getting into the left side
by any means,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.994
you can get it by worrying too much,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.876
you can get it by feeling very sorry for
something,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.514
or crying, weeping, anything,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:14.437
then your right side problems disappear.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.278
That is why you do it.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.198
But it goes too far.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.070
The right side problems are, if they are
cured,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.870
you get the left side problems which are
much more dangerous.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.110
l told you all kinds of psychosomatic
diseases,

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.432
l don't want to give the list to frighten you,

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.509
but they all come from the left side.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.790
Now, because the right side is a sort of
completely

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.589
cured, as they say,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.269
people think that it is a very good idea

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.114
to get possessed by some spirit.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.353
So these false gurus, what they do,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:09.832
they master these dead spirits.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.952
How? l mean, they know how to do it;

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.152
l need not tell you, you are not going to do
it.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:24.038
And they master it and they tell you that
''You take this name''.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.436
You start taking the name of some sort of
a God-knows-what.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.759
They don't tell that you take the name of
any incarnation,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.469
but they'll tell you ''Take the name of
Ram''.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.949
Ram's name is not taken like that,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.319
it has to be Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Shri
Mataji.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.196
So they never put Shri, they just tell you
''Take these names'',

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.948
and by these names what happens is that
you go to the left side

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.791
because of these dead spirits, they
capture you.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.475
There are dead spirits on the left side

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.910
and there are dead spirits on the right
side.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.232
lf they are on the right side they are very
ambitious people,

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.320
and they try to capture you.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.313
lt is a very

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.394
frightening explanation of the whole thing.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.354
Once they capture you, if you go to the
right side,

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.193
you get all right side ''qualities'', you are
not normal.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:51.236
Sometimes you feel you are going in the
air somewhere,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.033
you have seen something which you
would normally not see.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.877
Like two Americans came to see me and
they were journalists.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.997
So l asked them ''Why are you here?''

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.551
They said ''Mother, you make us like
Harishchandra''.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.310
There was one fellow called
Harishchandra who was a journalist.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.598
l said, ''But, like him?''

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.069
Because he used to travel in the air, and
he used to get news,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.956
like he would tell, about what is
happening in some part

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:50.633
some part of Bombay like we have a
Juboo Beach

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.475
So one day in the newspaper

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.032
it came out what happened at Juboo
Beach

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.919
and his name was there,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.154
the one who is the correspondent was Mr
Harishchandra.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.355
So, how did Harishchandra tell you my
name?

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.595
l cured him, while you want to get into his
trouble?

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.589
So we want to have this ''astral travel'',
americans,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.554
''For what?'' ''Because we are journalists

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.548
and we'll know so much about everything

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.791
we want to travel all over''.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.396
l said ''This l don't do''.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.078
lf you are doing astral travel, of course l
can reduce it .

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:51.998
So all these gurus had mastered also this
art of astral travel,

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.513
controlling some dead spirits who were
right sided.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.280
So right sided spirits are very ambitious

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.396
So right sided spirits are very ambitious

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.279
and they do all kinds of healings,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.638
and all kinds of predictions,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.190
because they are futuristic.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.675
Sometimes they know, sometimes they
don't know.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.516
But it is all coming from a wrong source;

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.912
so getting into that trap is not a very good
thing.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.270
lf somebody is possessed like that,

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.157
then such a person starts doing all kinds
of wrong things.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.838
Like it will try to grab your house,

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.070
to grab your money, to deceive you,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.277
run away with your wife,

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.831
all kinds of things which are absolutely
wrong.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:05.270
Because the influence of the right side
increases with it.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.917
Also there are some drugs, when you
take them,

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.480
like LSD and all that,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.715
you go to the right side and then you start
seeing colours,

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.397
and people think it is a very great thing to
see colours,

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.910
because normally you don't see colours.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.435
They don't know basically what is wrong
with them.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.593
But basically what is wrong with them is
that

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.112
there is a bhoot, there is some sort of a
ghost

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.031
which is very right sided, has gone into
their being

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.311
and trying to work it out.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.955
But the left side bhoots are different then.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.870
They are sly and they teach you peevish
things.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:05.071
They may also try to entice you to such
an extent

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.115
that a person can tell lies to any limit.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.037
He tells lies,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.308
then he tries to secretly take away your
money,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.159
take away whatever you have,

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.632
all kinds of planning secretive takes place,

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.832
nothing is open,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.352
and you do it without even understanding.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.391
But all these people are more interested

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.352
in achieving some sort of a very material
advancement,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.473
whether it is on the right side or the left
side.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.114
Many things happen like fundamentalism.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.994
lf you are a fundamentalist then these
bhoots take over

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.198
and they try to overpower you.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.510
They try to teach you how to kill people

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.032
who do not belong to your religion or to
your sect.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.157
They give ideas and they fight and they
quarrel and they kill.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.998
But the Mother Earth

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.389
or the sea, anything,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.757
any one of these elements can work out
the destruction.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.831
ln such places you'll find

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.478
big earthquakes taking place and
destroying them.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.630
Or there could be a hurricane that will
come and destroy them.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.753
Of course some innocent people are also
killed with them.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.358
lt could be anything that you do wrong,

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.111
it is being corrected by all these five
elements.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:08.238
ln lndia we had a place called as Latur

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.398
where people used to drink and drink and
drink.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.480
Once they went for drinking

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:26.873
when they had immersed the statue of
Shri Ganesha.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:34.112
That we do, we put it in the sea, after
three days,

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.232
maybe seven days or ten days.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.716
And they came back from there,

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.231
and they had gone for drinking after that

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.995
and they were completely drunk

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.351
and still they were singing the praise of
Shri Ganesh

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.598
and saying all kinds of filthy things,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.596
unholy things, dirty things, we can call
them

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.231
or lots of abuses they were using.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:09.118
Fulfilling that desire to be nasty, to be bad.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.871
And suddenly an earthquake came.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.874
They were all dancing, and they all went
inside

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.915
the Mother Earth and were finished.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.634
We had a centre there, surprisingly,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.796
that centre was not touched.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:37.311
About 1 00 yards away there was a round
circle created

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.316
so nobody could go out,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.835
and they were amazed how is it

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.833
that this centre has not been touched at
all.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.673
That's the power of the goddess.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.110
At the same time,

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.469
when she sees these negative people are
coming

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.071
to torture or to trouble,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.149
it's the goddess who saves the right type
of people.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.388
As you know, normally always, if there is
one good person,

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.792
there will be a hundred bad people getting
after them.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.155
And that person feels so lost,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.832
but then the goddess helps that man,

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.789
and saves that one, or that human being,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.551
from the troubles from the negative force.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:45.072
So this mother of yours fights all kinds of
negative forces.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.432
They can be, as l told you, drunkards who
drink.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.671
So she starts destroying.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.909
At a lower level she'll destroy their liver,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.591
at an even greater level she'll destroy
their family,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.230
she'll destroy their money.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:13.032
l've not heard of anywhere a statue
erected of a drunkard, never.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.597
Nowhere where drinking is a fashion,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.474
where drinking is a daily worship in a way,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.512
but l have never seen anywhere.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.992
How is it that nobody has erected

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.358
any statue of a man who was drunk?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.190
lt would be nice to show that, but no.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.155
Because the wisdom prevails and people
understand

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.995
what is the destructive force.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:06.356
So, one can get possessed by any such
idea.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.518
See, like Hitler,

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.272
he got the idea that he is the monarch of
everything,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.558
and he has every right to destroy the
Jews.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.718
And he was destroying; he destroyed so
many people.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.676
But, what happened at the end?

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.875
He was using the swastika which is the
symbol of Shri Ganesh,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.837
and with that he was fighting.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:43.276
But luckily it so happened that the Mother
entered into his mind.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.036
By that he lost Bhranti, illusions,

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.871
he lost the power of Ganesha, how to use
it.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.392
And he was using a stencil, and because
of the stencil

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:07.916
the second, l should say, printing of the
Swastika

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.920
was the other way round

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.834
which was for destruction.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.955
So he printed the other kind of swastika.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.868
As a result he got destroyed.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.191
So this is the Bhranti part.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.588
That she enters into your mind and puts
you into a Bhranti,

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.037
means into an illusion. You commit
mistakes.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.958
lf it had not happened

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.435
so many people would have been finished
by now.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.748
So she enters into the mind of such
people

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.554
for trying to destroy human beings,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.150
for trying to destroy anything,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.116
and puts ideas in such a manner that they
die

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.198
or they get self-destruction.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.714
That is why it is written that she is a
Bhranti within us.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.280
She creates such an illusion within us

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.669
She creates such an illusion within us

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:11.912
that a person who tries to be harmful, to
be troublesome,

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.714
to be destructive, gets destroyed.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.553
All kinds of things she can put,

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.549
and that's how so many people have
survived in this world,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.678
otherwise so many would have been
finished

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.713
and there would have been the kingdom
of the Satan.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.272
But it's this goddess is the one who saves
us.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:40.517
Symbolically they have said that she has
killed so many demons.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.672
Actually she has,

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.750
it is not that she has killed them in a
symbolic way.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.199
There were demons and demons

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.233
and even today we have demonic people.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.156
And all of them will not only be killed but
will be finished forever.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.112
l have seen in Russia, l have seen in
many countries,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.070
those people once upon a time were
regarded as Gods has finished.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.874
lt happens in every country.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.677
Wherever there are wrong type of people,
they're exposed

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.476
and people don't even want to look at
their photographs.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.597
They have thrown away their statues.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.159
All this happens because this goddess is
the one

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.398
who creates an illusion for people.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.748
Now supposing there is a person who is
very demonic,

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.760
who is going to destroy everyone.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.796
Then the people who are wise will
understand,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.519
but those who are not,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.071
will take to her and get destroyed with
him.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.754
Like this thousands of people have been
destroyed.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.312
Because they didn't see the right point.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.194
They couldn't understand what is right
and what is wrong.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.154
So this idea of right and wrong also

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.628
is completely confused by her

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.470
so that those who are wrong type can be
destroyed.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.670
We don't want them on this earth.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.550
Those who are troublesome, who are
destructive,

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.992
who are argumentative, will be all
destroyed.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.278
But by themselves only they will be
destroyed.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.831
lt is not necessary for the goddess to do
that.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.390
So this is the one which many people ask
me,

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.235
Why it is said that Bhranti Rupena
Samstita?

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.632
Why does she exist as an illusion?.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.509
This is the reason that your discriminating
power is challenged.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.554
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, a real
Sahaja Yogi,

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.599
then you can feel on your fingertips

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.519
if the person whom you are following is a
good man or a bad man.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.159
And then you can tell others also that
don't

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.717
So many seekers are destroyed like that.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.510
Wrong type of gurus came, and they just
followed them.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.911
Stupid, they were absolutely stupid gurus,

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.390
and these were stupid people,

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.270
l don't know why they followed them. lt
was so obvious

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.269
that they were just after some sort of a
Rolls Royce

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.639
or something. l have seen them,

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.556
so mad that they can't get out of it.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.799
There are people now who are following

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.794
all kinds of wrong gurus;

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.757
one of them is now very much liked by the
lndians all over

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.799
when they are abroad, not in lndia so
much.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.157
So they follow that Babaji, all right.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.314
And this Babaji is the one,

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.797
he takes money, he steals money,

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.759
he steals ornaments, he does all kinds of
things.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.752
But they don't mind.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.031
Whatever he is doing is all right.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.873
And this Babaji is the one, is to be
destroyed.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.828
But the advantage of having this Babaji is
this,

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.909
that you have all kinds of stupid people on
this earth,

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:37.275
so they have no discrimination,

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.679
and they fall prey to these Babajis
finished.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.959
They'll get heart attacks, they'll become
blind, they'll get cancer,

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.471
they'll get all kinds of troubles and that
destroys them.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.236
But it is surprising, human beings are
such

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.672
that they see a person being destroyed by
a Babaji,

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.992
or some guruji lady,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.876
and still one is killed and this also goes
forward .

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.955
lt is something surprising, that human
beings don't see

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.919
that the person is destroyed.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.629
Like l have told you many a time since,

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:26.114
people who are going to the pub, they see
from the pub

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.632
people coming out and falling on the
ground.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.312
And they queue up to go inside again, to
come back and fall.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.036
lt is very surprising, isn't it?, they have no
brains.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.078
Why do they want to go to the pub?

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.193
lf they have seen already somebody
falling down.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.715
But they do it.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.635
Now this is the Last Judgement, as l told
you,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.956
and at this time

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.915
you have to see what's happening to the
person

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.914
who has gone by wrong methods

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.471
or by the help of some of these gurujis.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.316
lt is very clear, if you want to see it, very
clear.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.148
How they are destroying themselves.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.439
''ln any case'', they say, ''ln any case we
have to die,

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.798
so why not go to the pub?'' l mean,
what's this?

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.831
This kind of argument they give, so stupid

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.714
as if they have no brains, no intelligence

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.150
to understand that a person has gone

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.119
and he came back from there and he has
fallen on the ground,

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.675
and nobody to pick him up.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.076
And they are doing it.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.274
And they said that Christ did it,

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.274
that he gave wine to people.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.717
Now, no, he cannot, he is perfect.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.230
He didn't give wine, he gave them

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.793
just an ordinary juice of the grapes.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.914
How can you make wine in one second,
can you?

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.635
But that's how they explain it;

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.670
all their bad things are explained by their
stupid intelligence

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.474
and they go for destruction.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.796
And now in Kali Yuga

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.552
destruction is working very fast.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.192
Why? Because people have lost their
discrimination.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.351
They are no more discreet,

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.390
and so many people have lost it, it's not
few.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.548
And it is a fashion to become indiscreet.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.278
l said, ''Why are they doing like this?''
''Mother, this is a fashion''.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.790
Any stupid thing is a fashion.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.478
Now you take to that stupid thing and then
you are in trouble.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.753
Nowadays of course there's a fashion that
women,

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.594
especially in America l have seen,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.356
they want to wear just straps over their

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.555
frocks, whatever you may call it.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.112
Just straps, and both the chakras are left
open.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.629
They're very important chakras,

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.156
you should not even wear sleeveless,

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.238
they should be always covered.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.757
All other chakras we cover, except for
Agnya

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.514
which we also cover with kumkum.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.397
By that, how many diseases can come.
You can get sinus,

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.270
start from sinus, you can get eye trouble,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.996
you can get paralysis of both the hands.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.193
You can get also Parkinson.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.835
All sorts of diseases can come

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.192
because these are two very important
chakras,

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.717
one is the Sri Chakra, which is on the
right side

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.554
and another is the Laleeta Chakra on the
left-hand side.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.038
You should never, never expose these
chakras, also the knees.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.556
But it is a fashion nowadays to show the
knees, l don't know,

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.638
l can't understand the logic behind it.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.831
What is in the knees?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.910
Why people want to see the knees of
people?

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:26.116
l mean l just don't understand. There's no
logic, it's senseless!

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.510
At first l never understood it,

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.230
and now l have understood that they want
to attract men!

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.636
lf men are attracted by your knees,

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:37.110
what sort of men they must be?

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.075
l don't understand such men also.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.034
Men will be fully dressed

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.511
while women will expose both the Nabhis

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.595
and both the chakras which are so
important.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.116
And that is the fashion!.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.280
Tomorrow the fashion will start that you
shave your heads.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.236
Tomorrow the fashion will start that you
shave your heads.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.709
So everybody will shave.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:11.553
As if it's like a flock of sheep

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:17.391
who don't understand, they go by the
collective happening.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.758
So there's a fashion which is actually
collective.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:27.269
And that's how it finishes off their sense,
completely.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.632
You see it every day and you don't
understand.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.030
l have seen even lndian women who are
abroad,

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.391
they also try to copy the fashions.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.353
And they also expose both their chakras,

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.710
and then they get into troubles.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.151
lt's very surprising.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.512
At least in lndia it's not regarded as a

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.308
good men to see a woman like that.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.592
But when they have come abroad they
have learnt this

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.629
a great knowledge how to expose your
body.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.996
The other side of it could be even more
serious,

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.199
like you cover your face.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.677
Mohamed-Saab must have thought of the
modern times

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.313
and said, ''Cover your face.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.393
Cover your body. Cover yourself
completely,

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.838
so that you are safe as a woman and men
are safe

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.633
because they are not attracted''.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.876
l mean this is going to the extremes.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.869
And it was to be worked out that way. But
it does not.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.319
l have seen also Muslim women are so
stupid

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.517
when they are facing their husbands,

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.314
the way they behave to attract their
husbands,

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.712
and the way the husbands try to
dominate. lt is too much!

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.911
So this is the Bhranti.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:51.276
The Bhranti created by the Mother, the
Amba.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.234
She creates this Bhranti

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.798
and with this Bhranti l have seen people
can go amok

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.117
and they don't know they are going amok,

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.631
because all of them are going that side.
So what?

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:11.878
Like there's a story about a father told his
son

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:16.279
that ''Which ever way people go, you must
follow them''.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.589
So he saw many people going and he
followed them.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.110
Where does he go? To a funeral!

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.797
That doesn't mean don't use your brains!

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.230
This is said of course.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:37.590
Also you will see what they do is this,

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:47.071
that say many people are going, say, to
something wrong,

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.314
they have no brains of their own, no
individuality, nothing,

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.113
they just follow it.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.749
They don't see what they have achieved,

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.954
what have they got, what is the use,
nothing.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.878
Even when you buy something you want
to find out

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.552
what is the quality;

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.359
the person who has purchased, how is he
using,

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.039
everything you want to find out.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.796
But when it comes to following the
fashion, nobody thinks about it.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.916
And the fashion is created to be fool
people, also, l think so.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:30.994
lt is something very funny creation of the
evil force,

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.998
so that human beings should be
destroyed.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.271
lt is, they say, the designers.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.513
l say it is nothing, designers or anything,

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.311
but is their aggressive force, their
negative force

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.636
which works on you;

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.957
and who saves you is the Mother on the
left side.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.790
She has got seven curtains. Seven
boundaries

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.276
she doesn't want you to cross over.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.553
But human beings say: ''Why not? Why
not me?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.992
lf they have gone to hell, l'll also go to
hell''.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:16.236
All right. That's been made already for
you, so go ahead.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.433
So that's why she creates the Bhranti;

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:25.597
because some people have to go out, out
of this circulation,

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.230
out of this evolution process. Let them go
out.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.070
This is the Last Judgement. All right, that's
how you'll be judged,

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.478
by your own stupidity you'll be judged.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.996
l have told so many Sahaja Yogis
something small,

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.350
that you must put some oil in the nights

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.312
and the morning time you wash.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.358
But they don't do it.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.037
But by doing that what happens is that
you soothe yourself,

00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.832
you sleep well.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.395
Oiling is a very good thing. We need it all
of us,

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.320
especially in this cold weather, we need it.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.039
But they won't put it.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.551
They'll neglect themselves.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.190
Because they think they're Sahaja Yogis

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.511
they are protected, Mother can oil them.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:20.953
lt's not so. You have to look after yourself.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.428
As far as the body is concerned, the mind
is concerned,

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.920
you are responsible for your body.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.074
With Sahaja Yoga you will understand
what's wrong with you,

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.799
what you are doing wrong.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.232
l mean l tell you some things which are
very important,

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.589
but to you they may not be, but you
should try that.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.430
As it is you are Realised Souls, your spirit
is there,

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.432
you can feel the vibrations,

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.399
and you can understand what's wrong
with the person.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:15.031
Mostly what l have seen, now it is much
less,

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.468
that people only inform me always about
people who are possessed.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.553
''Mother, such and such person is
possessed''.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.189
''Mother this person has got this
possession''.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.559
l said, ''But, throw them out!'' That's all!

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.835
Why do you want me to bother about
them?

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.191
Just throw them out!

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.433
Then after going out of Sahaja Yoga they
will realise,

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.314
then they will say ''Mother we don't want
to go out of Sahaja Yoga''.

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.478
Why? Because they know that now

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.833
they are completely away

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.954
from reality and from safety.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.758
So they want to come back.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.879
Those who can come back can come
back.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.397
But those who should not come back
should never come back.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:13.871
Because they are so mad that they'll
create a fashion of madness,

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.309
and people can get influenced by that.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:22.430
So to get influenced by others is not a
sign of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.676
He can influence others,

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:31.876
but how does he get influenced by others
but for Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.596
Sahaja Yoga is the discriminating power.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.275
And who has given you this is the
Kundalini.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.160
So this Kundalini which is your mother,

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.792
the one which is now in your triangular
bone, also

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.796
gives you all the qualities and all the
beauties of your being.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.794
Of course l have told you so many things
about Kundalini

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:55.678
that l need not tell you.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:00.711
But she also can correct the left side.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.519
Some people have a habit

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.351
of all the time crying and weeping over. l
don't know.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.678
Every time you meet them they are in
tears:

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.559
''And what has happened?''

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.708
''Mother this has happened, that has
happened'' and all that.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.150
They write letters after letters to me,

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.040
telling about their woes, their troubles and
this and that.

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:27.396
Baba you are Sahaja Yogis now.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:35.633
Now you are in the Garden of Eden, you
are in the heavens.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.277
And why are they thinking about all the
hellish things

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.074
which are not important? Why?

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.592
Because you haven't got your individuality
either.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:17.673
Now as Sahaja Yogis you have to develop
your discrimination

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.789
of understanding what others are.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.590
Also about yourself.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:29.551
Why do you hanker after things? Try to
understand.

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.076
What is so great about it?

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.272
Why do you want to do it?

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:38.477
Question yourself.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.278
ls it some possession?

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.591
ls it some fashion?

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.234
Or is it your individual feeling?

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:57.194
So, l'm trying to tell you

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.880
that this left side of yours is so protective,

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.118
that this left side of yours is so protective,

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.313
at the same time

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.951
if you are very aggressive about your left
side

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.954
you are thrown from one to another to
another to another into hell.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.470
And then you suffer.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:27.069
So you must understand, your wisdom
should be there,

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.632
which you can develop very much with
the help of the left side.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.078
Wisdom can be very well developed.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.829
Now there's somebody, say a Sahaja
Yogi, so called,

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:47.435
and he is absolutely aggressive,
money-oriented, deceitful

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.949
and you get into his trap.

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:58.150
ln Hindi we call it Chakkar, Chakkar.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:04.598
And once you get involved into that you
go on drifting;

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.153
still your left side will protect, up to a point.

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:17.189
But if you are too much of it, it throws you
''Get out, get out''.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.233
Now the time has come for all of us to
understand

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.278
that you are all Sahaja Yogis

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.273
and you have a very big responsibility,

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.431
very, very big responsibility that you
should do

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.039
what your enlightened conscience tells
you.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:43.313
Take to your enlightenment and live under
that light,

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.518
and don't jump in the darkness.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.472
And by that you will also understand

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.792
who is the right person and who is not the
right person.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:59.955
Even in Sahaja Yoga this negativity can
work,

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.595
it works.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.194
And one should not get involved

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.235
into any negative thoughts of others,

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:12.995
or negative doing of others.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.517
lt's a warning today l wanted to give you
all,

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:28.669
because you people are very much there,
to enjoy.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.672
Look after your attention, where does it
go.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.070
There is so many beautiful things,

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.118
see the flowers, so beautiful!.

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.550
See this thing they have made so
beautifully.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.149
lt makes my heart jump with joy;

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.551
while some people don't even notice.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.639
The other day l asked somebody,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.753
''Who had made that flower
arrangement?'' ''Which flower?''

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.829
l said ''The one that was there'' ''Which
one?''

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.196
So l told the names of the flowers. ''We
never saw''

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.511
Where were you looking,

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.395
that you couldn't see the flowers?!

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.269
Because your eyes are so stupid

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.391
that they cannot see the beauty.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:20.669
They are engulfed with all kinds of
negative things.

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.434
So the goddess has to kill all the
rakshasas.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:31.428
l don't know how many she has killed,
and again they are back.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.994
And again people are being trapped.

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.792
This is going on.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.193
So these rakshasas are there and you
have to pin-point them.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.275
And tell people ''Where are you going?
He's a rakshasa.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.991
What he has done, what has he
achieved?''

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.795
Now you should talk like that;

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:02.190
openly.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.029
So you can save many people

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.596
who are going to these rakshasas,

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:13.159
who are coming in such clothes that you
cannot make them out.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.991
They will be destroyed, one by one,

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.438
but when they are in the heart of so many
people

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.472
how can you destroy them?

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.069
So it is for you people to tell them

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.114
what these rakshasas are doing.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.196
l know their tricks,

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.634
but the worst part is that the human
beings fall into their tricks.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:46.755
So you have to be very
self-understanding.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.916
Ask always the question ''Why?

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.635
Why am l attracted to this?

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.111
What is the gain?''

00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.835
Ask yourself this question.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.073
You'll find

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.750
that after coming to Sahaja Yoga you
have gained so much.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.832
So now, why have this false idea?

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:14.033
why go after false things, negative things?

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.076
That's what Sahaja Yogis have to do,

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.910
because not that they're responsible for
others,

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.919
they are responsible for themselves also.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.037
Now the sweetest thing said about her is

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.676
that she gives you Shraddha.

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.877
Shraddha we can translate it as faith.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:46.472
To have faith, rightly not wrongly.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:52.111
People take full advantage if you have
wrong faiths.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.999
But faith is very important, that she gives
also.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.913
And that's very joy-giving.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.159
The faith is very joy-giving.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:13.519
But when the incarnations lived, nobody
believed in them.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:16.750
They had no faith in them.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.316
Christ, they crucified,

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.752
nobody stood up to say, ''Why are you
crucifying him?''

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.554
All of them; nobody could have that faith
to stand up.

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.349
They may fight for their own country,

00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.313
they may fight for their religion or own
nonsense,

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:44.276
but, ''That a man, this man, is really the
Truth,

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:49.669
he is the one who is an incarnation'',
nobody will say it.

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.196
So yesterday l was stunned

00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:00.239
to see the drama they have shown.

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:03.115
l mean, l couldn't face myself, l should
say.

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.631
Though it's the Truth, of course, l agree.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.797
But l couldn't face myself.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.914
l am too humble to accept such a thing,

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:17.719
and it's very ingenious, it's very great to
create such a drama

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.715
and of all the things. At first l had said that

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.954
the English have such a sense of drama,

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.669
they had people like Shakespeare and all
that,

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.197
and the way they were producing drama l
couldn't understand.

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.392
But this one was the last word on
perfection.

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.997
So much so that l couldn't say a word
about it.

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.158
l was just stunned.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.358
The Truth that they have propounded.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:55.039
But in my lifetime you will have no doubts,

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.120
if you have some sense in you.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.552
Because so many miracles are taking
place.

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.996
Today only somebody told me:

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:08.756
''Somebody had cancer,

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.918
ulcer and all kinds of things,

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.749
and after Sahaja Yoga

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.680
she went to the hospital and she had
nothing''.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.077
All such miracles are taking place. Leave
alone.

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:28.229
Also there are never have happened like
this

00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:32.633
that there are photographs of mine

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:38.155
where you see, is remarkable.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.234
Even the scientists are surprised at it,

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.795
how these photographs are coming.

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:50.311
Actually there was Shri Ganesha standing
behind it actually.

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.398
Only in one camera it came.

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:57.469
lt is just for you people to have faith.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.111
Because when the person is not there,

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.636
like Christ is no more, now everybody's
going to church.

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.118
Shri Rama is not there so they are all
singing his praise.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.876
Shri Krishna is not there so they are ''Hari
Rama, Hari Krishna''.

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.355
So when there is Sakshat, when that is
before you,

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.835
you don't accept.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.554
Because perhaps you don't believe you
can deserve it, perhaps.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.031
Or may be it is, l don't know,

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.550
human beings it is very difficult to
understand them.

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.308
When you are standing before them they
don't believe.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.870
When you are no more, then they will
believe.

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:40.073
lt is a very funny thing, isn't it?

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.994
All through out if you see the history of
spirituality

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.350
this has been going on.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.790
Gyanadeva showed some miracles, still

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:55.837
only the wise, only the sensible

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.668
could understand and believe it.

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.960
And there is so few that as a result

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.597
And there is so few that as a result

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.032
such people are crucified, killed or done
anything.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.799
They have tried that with me,

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:16.029
but you know in this life l have come in all
Forms,

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.789
and nobody can destroy me:

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.233
Unless and until l want to finish myself, no
one can.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.069
The powers are of love, affection,
compassion,

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.790
but also there's a power

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.834
which completely corrects other people.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:47.752
So to you people not to have faith in
Sahaja Yoga

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.993
shows complete blankness,

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.272
you have seen the photographs,

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.638
you have seen everything, you have
known the miracles,

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.555
it has happened to you. You have the
experience of Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.599
Despite that your faith is so weak.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.469
She's the one who gives you faith,

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.276
so you have to praise her, you have to fall
at her feet,

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.799
you have to worship her and ask her ''Oh
Mother, give us that faith''.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.956
And with this faith you'll be amazed,

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.715
any person who has this kind of a faith,

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.833
he tells me ''Mother, please, do this''

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.675
lt happens. lt just happens.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:36.035
Such right they have got to ask for
anything. lt works out.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.035
But first your faith should be solid.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.471
Faith should be real.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.356
lf it is real and if it is deep,

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.436
you can achieve whatever you want.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.110
Not wrong, but good things.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.636
And so try to develop that faith

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.035
and as a faith gives you such joy and
happiness,

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.597
you get committed, you get involved,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.275
and you don't want to get out of it.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:17.955
So the greatest thing is the blessing of the
left side is the faith.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.351
Faith which is pure,

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:27.557
faith can be translated as, we can say,
Vishwas

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.839
but not. Faith is Shraddha.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.272
Shraddha means something that is within;

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.075
which has no doubts,

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.717
which has no doing as such, it is just
there.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.595
So you should now develop faith

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.277
about yourself and about Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:58.754
lf your faith is strong you will see many
miracles also.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.118
But with miracles, with everything,

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:09.477
still if you don't understand then it is your
discretion.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.836
May God Bless You.
