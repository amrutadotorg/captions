WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:08.969
We had this Ganesha Puja, and I really spoke
very nicely on equilibrium. And the rain,

01:01.370 --> 01:08.370
expressed its equilibrium, but when they were
singing, it was very quiet. And when it stopped

01:09.530 --> 01:15.720
for a short time suddenly it came with a complete
gusto and sang some songs and went away again.

01:15.720 --> 01:22.720
Just for the aarti to start with. It’s very
beautiful it was. So dramatic. Very interesting.

01:25.750 --> 01:32.750
So all preparations are done for the puja?
Maybe some people might come up from abroad,

01:41.900 --> 01:48.900
I don’t know. Maybe. Have you written to
some leaders or not, about this puja that

02:00.890 --> 02:07.890
we are going to have?
Yogi: I think yes some invitations were sent

02:08.959 --> 02:14.959
out.
Shri Mataji: Might have gone out.

02:14.959 --> 02:21.959
Yogi: There are one or two people coming.
Shri Mataji: They might come.

02:29.030 --> 02:36.030
Yogi: Only individuals. I invited a few people
at Ganapatipule and they said; ‘Oh, it’s

02:37.720 --> 02:44.720
such a long way.’ And I said: ‘But you
always expect us to come to yours.

02:47.670 --> 02:54.670
Shri Mataji: Yes. They have to move. Columbus
could go to America, why not you people go

03:14.980 --> 03:21.980
to Australia. Can’t understand.
Yogi: And a much more comfortable trip.

03:41.590 --> 03:48.590
Shri Mataji: Much more comfortable. They found
a much more comfortable place to live in.

04:21.090 --> 04:28.090
He was really lost. But in a way thank God,
you see. Otherwise there would have been no

05:25.729 --> 05:32.729
Indian left in India, if he had come here
by chance. So many flowers, beautiful. In

06:36.669 --> 06:43.669
Singapore I bought a book, very interesting,
called as: ‘Faces of Islam.’ And I was

06:47.139 --> 06:54.139
surprised that the whole concept of Islam
is Sahaja. Absolutely. And all the, authors

06:56.960 --> 07:03.960
and all the people, who have discussed there,
are saying that Muslims are not Islamic. They

07:06.479 --> 07:13.000
don’t follow Islam. That’s why their whole
thing has become so rigid. I mean so surprising

07:13.000 --> 07:17.940
that book has revealed to Me the confessions,
of these people.

07:17.940 --> 07:24.940
And the society that Mohammed Sahib has talked
about is ours. Muslims are nowhere. Absolutely

07:25.440 --> 07:32.050
the way He has described how the brotherhood
would be there, how righteousness would be

07:32.050 --> 07:38.259
there. But one thing is missing I feel, that
He said: ‘You must seek the knowledge. You

07:38.259 --> 07:44.180
must seek the Truth.’ Despite that, whatever
was Islam, they have failed to seek the knowledge,

07:44.180 --> 07:49.900
and to learn from others. Can you imagine?
And He has said how to deal with non-Muslims

07:49.900 --> 07:55.590
also. And they said that there are many who
are just minimal Muslims. Some of them are

07:55.590 --> 08:01.729
just for name’s sake, they are not Muslims.
I mean I was so amazed. We have such a misunderstanding,

08:01.729 --> 08:08.729
that I always said that all these Incarnations
and Prophets, came to establish a religion

08:08.919 --> 08:15.919
which was really Sahaja Yoga. All their expectations
were Sahaja Yoga. And they have deviated so

08:18.539 --> 08:23.860
much, that you start wondering what is this,
as in Christianity, you see. How much it has

08:23.860 --> 08:29.460
deviated, Christianity, to what level it has
gone, it is shocking, really shocking.

08:29.460 --> 08:36.460
I don’t know if you know of a book written
‘In God’s Name’. And in that book, it

08:38.599 --> 08:45.599
reads like a novel actually, I mean it’s
very interesting. In that book the writer

08:47.269 --> 08:53.449
has suggested that this present pope, is responsible
for the murder of the previous one. And there

08:53.449 --> 09:00.449
were thirteen or fourteen murders took place,
just to hide this. Can you believe it? And

09:01.629 --> 09:08.629
recently one of the persons was murdered was
Calvi. And they say, that this Calvi was murdered,

09:10.999 --> 09:17.110
I mean every week in Italy since I am there,
some new exposures are coming. But this Calvi

09:17.110 --> 09:24.110
was murdered in a way that he was hanged,
on one of the bridges of London. And if he

09:25.509 --> 09:32.509
was, he was the one, the one who murdered
him, he said that: ‘I am a member of mafia

09:36.790 --> 09:42.869
all right, but I was paid by this Vatican
by this pope, for murdering that man.’ Is

09:42.869 --> 09:49.869
a confession from him. And Mr Heard was, questioned:
‘Why didn’t you take action against this

09:51.410 --> 09:55.519
when these things happen in England?’ He
says: ‘What’s the use? Because they would

09:55.519 --> 10:02.519
kill all our lawyers, our judges everyone.
It’s all mafia.’ So the whole system of

10:02.679 --> 10:09.679
Catholic Church is nothing but mafia. Nine
million, dollars of counterfeit, were printed

10:12.679 --> 10:19.679
and were distributed through their bank, that
is Vatican Bank. Can you believe it? I mean

10:21.759 --> 10:28.759
this is Christianity. Is this what Christ
preached? Killing people, doing all kinds

10:29.019 --> 10:30.119
of things?

10:30.119 --> 10:36.199
I mean nowhere I find Mohammed decrying anyone.
He said: ‘You have to believe in everyone’.

10:36.199 --> 10:42.360
Only these people are saying, that He was
the last. He went to this limit to say that:

10:42.360 --> 10:49.360
‘I am not Divine. I follow the Divine laws
but I am not Divine.’ May be just He wanted

10:49.619 --> 10:56.619
people to follow. Surprising I was really
surprised that, if Koran is teaching such

10:59.220 --> 11:06.220
great things, the Muslims are just on the
other side of it and they admit, that Islam

11:07.269 --> 11:14.269
should not be confused with Muslims. In the
same way we can say that Christianity should

11:16.850 --> 11:23.850
not be confused with Christians. What about
Judaism? Same thing. I mean nowhere in that

11:25.559 --> 11:31.569
religion taught, to be like this the way they
are behaving. They are following Hitler, out

11:31.569 --> 11:38.569
and out. The one who killed them, tortured
them, they are becoming just like them.

11:38.699 --> 11:45.699
So what to say about these human beings as,
under the name of God, under the name of religion,

11:50.239 --> 11:55.119
behaving like this. The reason they have given
many: ‘Because of this and because of that.’

11:55.119 --> 12:02.119
So, this aspect, that they are saying that:
‘Because the people didn’t read Koran

12:10.970 --> 12:17.970
properly, they didn’t understand properly,
they should have been educated properly.’

12:19.519 --> 12:26.519
It will take thousand years to educate every
Muslim about it. And if they think that by

12:40.989 --> 12:47.670
teaching through their Book, it will be imbibed,
it’s not possible. Everybody reads Bible

12:47.670 --> 12:53.939
everybody reads Koran, but nothing goes inside
just reading reading reading. So their idea

12:53.939 --> 12:58.470
is that if they read and analyze, I mean you
have to have big universities for that, it

12:58.470 --> 13:05.470
could be taught to people and, still then
not necessary, that they would imbibe.

13:08.160 --> 13:14.649
I know of Mahatma Gandhi, see He was a Realized
soul was a, and He was of course, over-disciplined

13:14.649 --> 13:21.649
according to Me. And He put these ideas on
to His followers. As long as He lived they

13:23.709 --> 13:30.160
were all right. As soon as He died, they came
out in their true colors. Everything dropped

13:30.160 --> 13:36.689
off like some sort of a mud on their body,
and they became horrible people in India.

13:36.689 --> 13:43.689
So the thing missing is this, that, they are
not Realized souls. Because they are not Realized,

13:45.669 --> 13:50.619
all these things they cannot bear. They cannot
bear money, they cannot bear power. Now I

13:50.619 --> 13:57.619
think they cannot bear the religion. So you
have to have your Realization. Unless and

14:00.309 --> 14:03.829
until you have your Realization, you cannot
bear anything.

14:03.829 --> 14:10.829
Moreover in Sahaja Yoga I mean there are no
compulsions, no disciplines as such, I mean

14:11.029 --> 14:18.029
compared to what we see in all these religions.
Suddenly I find people coming up, to the expectations

14:21.209 --> 14:28.209
of righteousness, goodness, and they are also
very compassionate. So the change has come

14:31.959 --> 14:38.959
from inside, that means it’s the innate,
change. The innate religion has been awakened.

14:39.720 --> 14:45.259
It’s not just forced on you, that you should
be Vishwa Nirmala Dharmis but you become,

14:45.259 --> 14:51.410
you just become that. This is the point you
will see, these Prophets did not know, I think

14:51.410 --> 14:56.359
Christ did not know that these people will
never change unless and until they get their

14:56.359 --> 15:02.879
Realization. I think He knew also because
He always said that you have to be born again.

15:02.879 --> 15:09.689
So when He said: ‘You are to be born again,’
they have a, brand you see again, one are

15:09.689 --> 15:14.679
Christian, another Born Again, another are
Seventh Day, another, something. All just

15:14.679 --> 15:16.040
the same stupid people.

15:16.040 --> 15:23.040
But Sahaja Yoga is the only way. Where what
you, say that’s what you follow. Practice

15:25.829 --> 15:32.470
and precepts are just the same for Sahaja
Yogis. They just can’t do it something else.

15:32.470 --> 15:36.759
They are dreaming also that the occident had
a very bad influence on Islam and all that.

15:36.759 --> 15:42.470
I don’t think it’s that. You are coming
from the occident, still you have jumped into

15:42.470 --> 15:49.470
the right culture of religion, when you understand
what is righteousness what is good. You can

15:51.079 --> 15:58.069
bear it. You’re not to be told do this,
do that, but in the light of your Spirit you

15:58.069 --> 16:05.069
do it. And you achieve it. It’s a very,
interesting thing to note, that a little thing

16:08.749 --> 16:15.749
was missing in all of them, and they just
went away as if they never knew where to land.

16:17.279 --> 16:20.359
All these religions, one better than the other.

16:20.359 --> 16:26.499
Hindus, same thing. Hindus had of course one
advantage they were never organized, thank

16:26.499 --> 16:32.259
God, because if you are organized and misled,
then the whole party goes astray. But Hindus,

16:32.259 --> 16:39.259
Hindu scriptures were never organized into
a religion like that. But still, so many points

16:40.759 --> 16:47.079
they have missed. Like it is said that: ‘In
everyone there resides the Spirit’. Then

16:47.079 --> 16:54.079
how can you have caste system? You cannot.
But they have caste system. So, also so many

16:58.499 --> 17:05.499
other rituals and things nonsense is there,
absolutely nonsense. And Hindu religion became,

17:09.600 --> 17:16.600
a kind of a, ritualistic religion where, the
priests uneducated useless priests became

17:19.159 --> 17:25.949
in charge. And they’re so stupid, worse
than pope sometimes, that they say that if

17:25.949 --> 17:32.949
you want to have…

17:36.559 --> 17:43.559
I’ve also found out a solution for children
our western children, what is the problem.

18:06.690 --> 18:13.490
I went to Japan, and what I found there, that
till the age of twelve years, they don’t

18:13.490 --> 18:20.490
allow children to have much sports, to go
out much, and, mostly they are in the house

18:20.669 --> 18:27.669
or in the school, learning to do things with
their hands. And medically I know that, till

18:28.440 --> 18:35.440
the age of twelve years, there is myelin sheath
that grows on your nerves. And this myelin

18:36.389 --> 18:42.610
sheath gives you the deftness. Like if you
go to the villages like [SOUNDS LIKE: Saranti

18:42.610 --> 18:49.610
or all these?], where they are producing artistic
things, what happens, that the children also

18:49.730 --> 18:53.429
start doing the same. It’s so easy for them
when they grow up.

18:53.429 --> 19:00.389
So that is the time when they have to develop
that deftness. That deftness is, also makes

19:00.389 --> 19:07.389
them more concentrated, they get involved
into it, and also, that you can never acquire

19:10.509 --> 19:16.309
later. So that is just a precious time of
twelve years, that that is the time children

19:16.309 --> 19:23.309
should be made to do some drawings, not at
random, but properly, to do some carvings,

19:23.710 --> 19:30.710
to do some other clay work. You’ll be surprised
by the age of twelve years, the boys in Japan

19:32.100 --> 19:39.100
could repair a watch, could repair televisions,
and one boy produced, produced. At that time

19:39.139 --> 19:45.480
when I had gone, there were not many televisions
also. I was surprised that the boy produced

19:45.480 --> 19:51.070
a television, at the age of twelve years.
And also they are given violins in their hands

19:51.070 --> 19:57.360
when they’re about five years. They start
playing. So the music, art and all this side

19:57.360 --> 20:03.039
is developed till the age of twelve years.
And then the children are made to go out and

20:03.039 --> 20:10.039
play and do all kinds of exercises and also
sports. But they are not let loose at a young

20:11.450 --> 20:12.370
age.

20:12.370 --> 20:19.370
Now here I think about twenty years back or
may be twenty-five years back a new theme

20:19.529 --> 20:26.529
started with children that, you should allow
the children to do what they like, let them

20:27.049 --> 20:33.330
express themselves, let them be free, this
that. I think it’s not proper. Otherwise

20:33.330 --> 20:38.070
they would be hanging from some trees trying
to do without parents you see. After all this

20:38.070 --> 20:43.769
is the way the parents escape their duty I
think. You have to tell children what they

20:43.769 --> 20:50.769
have to do. You have to, talk to them, you
must have a rapport with them. You must talk

20:51.830 --> 20:58.539
to them, and you must also try to guide them,
with your experience, tell them what is good

20:58.539 --> 21:03.539
what is bad. But this kind of a, thing that
the child should be allowed to do what they

21:03.539 --> 21:10.539
like, express themselves the way they like.
I’ve seen the western children always will

21:11.309 --> 21:18.309
ask parents: ‘Why, why?’ They are not
to know, they have limitations. They can’t

21:18.559 --> 21:23.649
know every ‘why’. How can they understand?
They are limited and so, first of all, they

21:23.649 --> 21:30.649
are to build up. You can you see this aeroplane
now. Supposing it is not built up and allowed

21:31.409 --> 21:37.450
to go because: ‘It’s all right. Let it
go in the sky’. What will happen? In the

21:37.450 --> 21:43.870
same way we have to put the nuts and bolts
properly, into them, and see that they develop

21:43.870 --> 21:47.759
a personality.

21:47.759 --> 21:52.000
That doesn’t mean that you should be in
any way cruel to them. Not necessary. There’s

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
no need to beat them or do anything of the
kind. But only thing is, with love you should

21:59.100 --> 22:04.919
be able to change them. And also dignity,
sense of dignity should be there. Because

22:04.919 --> 22:09.299
if you develop their sense of dignity, they
will not misbehave. That’s very important

22:09.299 --> 22:15.600
from childhood to give them a sense of dignity,
that they are Sahaja Yogis and they have to

22:15.600 --> 22:22.600
behave. Because when we started this school
one year, first year, one month, it was such

22:22.870 --> 22:29.870
a problem I mean, impossible situation. The
teachers gave up and they wrote to me: ‘Better

22:30.169 --> 22:36.539
send typhoon take children.’ It’s terrible.
Not only that, they trouble them but they

22:36.539 --> 22:42.700
used to beat them and bite them and do all
kinds of thing and make fun of them. So wild.

22:42.700 --> 22:49.029
And that place is full of cliffs and full
of, all kinds of dangerous heights and they

22:49.029 --> 22:56.029
would just run out. Just like dogs. Dogs are
better I would say. They had no caution about

22:56.279 --> 23:00.429
themselves and for one month, they all gave
up. And the Principal has now run away he

23:00.429 --> 23:03.470
said: ‘I can’t manage these children.
They don’t want to study. They have come

23:03.470 --> 23:08.860
here to trouble us, that’s all. They don’t
want to study.’ And first thing when I met

23:08.860 --> 23:12.250
them they came and told Me: ‘Mother, we
don’t want to study.’

23:12.250 --> 23:19.250
Now we have put a one, masseur on them, who
massages their body. He was telling Me: ‘They

23:23.289 --> 23:26.360
are really funny children.’ They don’t
want to brush their teeth. If you ask them

23:26.360 --> 23:29.370
to brush their teeth they start crying. They
don’t want to have a bath. Tell them you

23:29.370 --> 23:35.809
have to have your bath, they start crying.
Anything you tell them they start doing like

23:35.809 --> 23:42.299
that.’ So we can say one thing, that disciplining
children in a indirect way is very important

23:42.299 --> 23:47.629
like that you see. Because this idea, that
you should leave the children as they are,

23:47.629 --> 23:52.269
is very wrong. You have to guide them and
tell them how to behave.

23:52.269 --> 23:58.169
Now see, you must have seen Indian children
how quiet they are. But I think the attention

23:58.169 --> 24:03.340
of children is quite a lot. And the mothers
are not working also, so they look after the

24:03.340 --> 24:10.179
children. Now in our schools that we have
here you should, train them up that way. You

24:10.179 --> 24:15.659
can talk to them that: ‘You are Sahaja Yogis,
you see, you are special people.’ The other

24:15.659 --> 24:21.799
day there was one Indian child, he’s living
in Singapore, where he has picked up all these

24:21.799 --> 24:27.659
bad habits. He came and he was talking to
Me: ‘Grandma, Grandma.’ And he said: ‘I

24:27.659 --> 24:34.659
will tell you in Your ear something’. And
he said something funny. I said: ‘Are you

24:34.879 --> 24:39.559
a servant?’ He said: ‘No.’ ‘Then only
servants talk like this. How are you talking

24:39.559 --> 24:44.320
like this?’ ‘Is it?’ I said: ‘Yes.
This is how the servants talk.’ He got such

24:44.320 --> 24:49.499
a fright. He said: ‘All right, I will never
talk like that. It’s dirty. I’ll not talk

24:49.499 --> 24:52.179
like that.’ You see, suddenly he changed.

24:52.179 --> 24:56.690
So we have to talk to them, we have to have
rapport with them. After all they are born

24:56.690 --> 25:02.820
Realized so they have special powers and they
are special children. But, one thing is definite,

25:02.820 --> 25:09.480
that children cannot be avoided, and you cannot
avoid your duty towards your children. You

25:09.480 --> 25:16.480
have to look after them because, they are
in your trust as it is. They are after all

25:16.570 --> 25:21.509
born Realized children. They are special children
with tremendous brains. They are cleverer

25:21.509 --> 25:26.759
than you and they can outwit you, because
they are so clever, so intelligent. But if

25:26.759 --> 25:29.649
they get spoiled at this age, then later on
it will be very difficult to bring them…You

25:29.649 --> 25:34.340
were better, because you were not born with
Realization. So you understood the value of

25:34.340 --> 25:37.370
Realization. But they don’t. So they are
to be told that: ‘You are Realized children,

25:37.370 --> 25:44.370
God sent you here, you are special children,’
and what should happen. Gradually they will

25:45.289 --> 25:48.289
pick up, and understand.

25:48.289 --> 25:53.309
Of course I am happy that so many marriages
are successful, and people are behaving all

25:53.309 --> 25:56.740
right. Of course there are some stray cases
of fighting going on which I hear about. This

25:56.740 --> 26:02.850
is stupid of course again, that we should
fight. When we are both Sahaja Yogis, what

26:02.850 --> 26:09.710
is there to fight? I mean, there’s no question.
We believe in all the religions, so we can’t

26:09.710 --> 26:16.710
fight on religions. On what subject can we
fight, I just don’t know. We know the ethics

26:23.570 --> 26:30.399
of Sahaja Yoga and we like it, so we cannot
fight on ethics. Economics of Sahaja Yoga

26:30.399 --> 26:36.909
we understand, we cannot fight on that. I
just don’t understand what is the, point

26:36.909 --> 26:43.389
of difference where they start fighting. On
the contrary in Sahaja Yoga, you can really

26:43.389 --> 26:50.240
be, enjoying your married life. Should be
enjoying your married life and the children

26:50.240 --> 26:54.629
should see to it, that our parents are so
nicely, quietly settled down. But if they

26:54.629 --> 26:59.309
see you quarreling, next day they’ll be
quarreling too.

26:59.309 --> 27:06.309
Then we have only monogamy. We don’t have
three wives or four wives as the Muslims have.

27:06.809 --> 27:13.730
We don’t have four husbands or something
like that. We have simple monogamy, a very

27:13.730 --> 27:19.279
peaceful life, very beautiful life, then why
should there be problem between husband and

27:19.279 --> 27:25.399
wife? Culturally we are just the same, we
believe in all the good cultures of all the

27:25.399 --> 27:32.399
world. There’s no problem. One gentleman
told Me that: ‘My wife quarrels with me

27:34.940 --> 27:38.830
on one point.’ I said: ‘Which?’ She
said: ‘You do not meditate, you must meditate

27:38.830 --> 27:45.830
more.’ I said: ‘That’s a good point’.
He thinks as well. But I told the wife that:

27:45.929 --> 27:51.490
‘You need not tell him, he’ll do it on
his own.’ Because you see cannot force things.

27:51.490 --> 27:55.999
This has to work out by themselves. You must
accept them as they are. Gradually they’ll

27:55.999 --> 28:02.999
all improve and gradually they will get there.
You cannot just force them. We cannot just

28:06.769 --> 28:11.539
tell each other, do this way or that way.

28:11.539 --> 28:18.539
Sahaja Yoga is a thing is to be imbibed. People
don’t understand that. They think by forcing

28:19.119 --> 28:26.119
people, by jumping at them, that’s not the
way. Of course if somebody is very difficult,

28:27.789 --> 28:33.779
then we have divorce in Sahaja Yoga. We have
not banned divorce as in the Catholic religion

28:33.779 --> 28:38.929
or anything. There is divorce. But there should
be something sensible about it. One has to

28:38.929 --> 28:45.090
work it out. Normally there should not be
many cases of Sahaja Yoga, of divorce. But

28:45.090 --> 28:50.059
we have because of the background certain
types of funny relations they have had or

28:50.059 --> 28:57.059
I don’t know, what to say. On the whole,
ninety percent or I should say ninety-five

28:59.929 --> 29:06.379
percent marriages are quite successful, and
will be more now the number will be much more,

29:06.379 --> 29:13.350
I’m sure. This time we had seventy-six marriages,
so you can imagine. And in this one month,

29:13.350 --> 29:17.860
Yogi was after My life with his file there.

29:17.860 --> 29:24.629
So there, also there’s some misunderstanding
that Yogi decides, he does not, poor man.

29:24.629 --> 29:30.869
He cannot. But it happens sometimes, like
at the last minute they’ll bring somebody,

29:30.869 --> 29:36.629
now we cannot locate the name of that person,
we just can’t find out if he’s there or

29:36.629 --> 29:42.499
not, or she’s there or not. Suddenly they
bring somebody, and he may say or she may

29:42.499 --> 29:47.070
say that I am there on the form and all that.
Then you have to accept it. If you accept

29:47.070 --> 29:52.669
such a thing then what happens that, you find
that person is not a Sahaja Yogi or was not

29:52.669 --> 29:57.539
a Sahaja Yogi for such a long time. Something
like that. So because of three hundred to

29:57.539 --> 30:04.539
four hundred requests you see, what can we
do. I mean after all, can’t know who is

30:07.039 --> 30:07.779
who.

30:07.779 --> 30:14.779
This is one thing that is very good. At least
we can control all that. If something is wrong

30:16.330 --> 30:23.330
we can find out, we can work it out and we
can manage things. It’s not so difficult.

30:24.070 --> 30:29.759
But the leaders must be careful because the
leaders who recommend should not, do something

30:29.759 --> 30:36.509
out of just some sort of a pity, or some sort
of a consideration. The main consideration

30:36.509 --> 30:41.710
should be, how are the vibrations and what
is the commitment in Sahaja Yoga. If they

30:41.710 --> 30:47.210
are committed to Sahaja Yoga and if their
vibrations are all right, then it’s all

30:47.210 --> 30:53.480
right it’s perfect. But sometimes, you know,
some people do have problems which do not

30:53.480 --> 30:56.190
come up and later on it is discovered.

30:56.190 --> 31:03.190
Still, I am so happy our society is so great.
There’s no such society existing in the

31:03.499 --> 31:09.289
whole world. And this is the society I think
all these Prophets and everybody dreamt of,

31:09.289 --> 31:16.289
of such love, understanding. Gradually I think
we all will, grow and grow and grow. The growth

31:21.580 --> 31:28.580
is going on, but the atmosphere I must say
is very nice, and it helps each other.

31:30.820 --> 31:37.820
In Australia we had more problems in Melbourne,
not in Sydney I must give credit to your leader

31:44.059 --> 31:51.059
here, he has managed the things well. There
are many after him also it’s rather funny

31:55.499 --> 32:01.429
but, I just don’t know, because Australia
always had a problem, this kind and gradually

32:01.429 --> 32:08.429
we have sorted it out. It’s a, leadership
means nothing but I call it hocus-pocus. It

32:09.409 --> 32:15.369
has no meaning at all. But then somebody has
to be there to contact and all that. It’s

32:15.369 --> 32:22.369
something so limited. But there is jealousy,
there is all these things still, lingering

32:23.889 --> 32:30.889
behind and then the problems come in.
Gradually I am sure all of us will grow well

32:37.999 --> 32:40.360
and everything will work out, in a proper
way. Should work out in a proper way. Our

32:40.360 --> 32:45.110
society has to show to the world that there
can be a society like this.

32:45.110 --> 32:52.110
Now there’s a good news which is very good
I think, we can start the calendar from that

32:52.529 --> 32:59.269
date perhaps because such a transformation
is coming, that the Russian Embassy has invited

32:59.269 --> 33:06.269
Me to honor Me for the work I

33:19.769 --> 33:26.059
have done in Russia. And the another good
news is that Gorbachov wants to meet Me. And

33:26.059 --> 33:33.059
you must be aware that in Tagliatti, is one
place, Tagliatti which is an industrial town

33:43.929 --> 33:49.470
where a gentleman called [SOUNDS LIKE: Pagliati]
from Italy went down, he was a revolutionary.

33:49.470 --> 33:56.470
And he started this place called as Pagliati
and the best motorcar that they make is made

33:59.489 --> 34:05.470
in this place Tagliatti, beautiful one. They
gave Me a model here, very beautiful, quite

34:05.470 --> 34:12.470
big. Looked like a limousine sort. Quite big.
And in that one city we have twenty-two thousand

34:12.710 --> 34:16.950
Sahaja Yogis practising, twenty-two thousand.
And you’ll be amazed that in Russia nowhere

34:16.950 --> 34:23.950
is less than sixteen thousand people, nowhere.
Any time you go there at least sixteen thousand

34:27.690 --> 34:31.710
people practising Sahaja Yoga, very seriously.

34:31.710 --> 34:35.929
So can imagine in that country what is going
to happen, though it hasn’t got food as

34:35.929 --> 34:42.929
you have here, too much to eat, but still
look at the way, look at the way it has worked

34:46.109 --> 34:50.919
out. How deeply they have gone into it. They
had never heard a word about Ganesha. They

34:50.919 --> 34:57.919
never believed in God. They were in a way
atheist. And how much they have achieved in

34:58.440 --> 35:04.390
just…look at that. How did they achieve
that? The depth that they have, they just

35:04.390 --> 35:11.069
touched it. And also they invited some scientist,
or two hundred scientists were there. And

35:11.069 --> 35:15.829
when I started telling about science, said:
‘Mother, don’t tell us about science,

35:15.829 --> 35:21.240
had enough of it. Now please tell us about
Spiritual science, spirituality. That’s

35:21.240 --> 35:25.140
it’. Wonderful I tell you, such experiences.
And in My lecture only, just giving a lecture

35:25.140 --> 35:29.880
at the time when there were about sixteen
thousand to eighteen thousand people, people

35:29.880 --> 35:33.290
got cured, just got cured.

35:33.290 --> 35:39.740
Such wonders. There was one lady who came
to see Me after the lecture and she was just

35:39.740 --> 35:44.609
sitting in front of Me. They brought her on
a wheelchair. She said: ‘I couldn’t even

35:44.609 --> 35:47.540
sit.’ All right. And then I said: ‘You
are all right,’ She said: ‘Really?’

35:47.540 --> 35:54.540
I said: ‘Yes. You get up.’ Got up. She
started walking and then she started running

35:55.180 --> 35:58.480
and everybody started… Such faith. Such
faith.

35:58.480 --> 36:04.500
And in Czechoslovakia, there was one old lady.
They brought her with great difficulty just,

36:04.500 --> 36:11.500
held her out and brought her on the stage
and she was trying to sit down. Then she said:

36:11.799 --> 36:18.799
‘Mother I have complete faith in You. I
know You can cure me.’ I said; ‘Really?’

36:20.480 --> 36:27.480
‘Yes. I am sure You can.’ I said: ‘You
are cured.’ She got up. Everybody was surprised.

36:28.440 --> 36:32.119
I said: ‘Now walk. Walk now.’ And then
she started walking fast, and everybody started

36:32.119 --> 36:39.119
laughing. But that faith, you see, is something
so special. I mean I have seen so many miracles

36:42.210 --> 36:44.640
happening with this faith that…

36:44.640 --> 36:51.640
There was one fellow called Mr Shukla, who
is a big boss in this hotel management of

36:51.640 --> 36:58.640
Taj Mahal. And this Mr Shukla heard that his
mother was very sick she was going to die.

37:00.240 --> 37:07.240
Very serious. So he went to Rotak which is
very far away, beyond Delhi from Bombay, and

37:07.660 --> 37:13.740
he saw his mother in a very bad condition,
very painful. The doctor said she has a galloping

37:13.740 --> 37:20.069
cancer and at the most she can live for three
days. He got very much worried. He came back

37:20.069 --> 37:25.730
home. He thought that: ‘I couldn’t even
talk to my mother, she’s in a coma, what

37:25.730 --> 37:31.829
will happen to her.’ He just sat before
My Photograph and prayed: ‘Mother, please

37:31.829 --> 37:38.089
cure my mother. I don’t want anything just
now, You just cure my mother, I know You can

37:38.089 --> 37:43.280
cure her.’ And within three days before,
instead of dying she was out of the hospital.

37:43.280 --> 37:49.460
He brought her to Bombay. They took her to
the hospital of Thata, Thata Memorial Hospital

37:49.460 --> 37:56.460
we have, and when they examined her they said
she has no cancer. He has papers. He has papers

37:57.680 --> 38:01.380
from the first hospital and from this one.

38:01.380 --> 38:06.349
Recently, Rajesh told me a story about himself.
He said: ‘Mother, You don’t know how many

38:06.349 --> 38:11.970
powers You have given me.’ I said: ‘No
it’s your faith.’ His uncle was just dying.

38:11.970 --> 38:15.530
They had removed his oxygen and everything.
His aunt sent for him and she said: ‘Now

38:15.530 --> 38:22.520
he’s about to die. You pray for his salvation,
at least to Mother. Just somehow or other

38:22.520 --> 38:29.520
try to see that he’s also gets his salvation’.
He’s not a Sahaja Yogi uncle nothing of

38:29.660 --> 38:36.660
the kind. So Rajesh just had his pendant,
just twisted it, and then closed his eyes

38:39.670 --> 38:46.589
and prayed: ‘Mother, please cure my uncle.’
That’s all. He said it was too much of a

38:46.589 --> 38:53.589
venture to say but I did say. And the uncle
who was dying got all right, went to America

38:54.119 --> 38:57.290
and he’s back and still kicking.

38:57.290 --> 39:04.290
So this is something you see. We have to go
deep down into ourselves. Superficiality is

39:05.000 --> 39:11.690
not going to help. If we are superficial by
nature, it will not help us. We have to understand

39:11.690 --> 39:17.530
ourselves. The whole mechanism is within us
to attract the attention of this all-pervading

39:17.530 --> 39:24.530
Power, to use it, to work it out. We can do
marvels. If we really go deep down, and become

39:25.790 --> 39:31.020
good vehicles of that all-pervading Power.
That’s what we have to do. Everything can

39:31.020 --> 39:36.780
work out. There are so many examples of this,
but specially these two recently I heard about

39:36.780 --> 39:43.780
and, I was amazed. We have to have that depth
within us to understand: What are we doing?

39:45.530 --> 39:52.530
Where are we? We are born at this time. It’s
an important time, and that at this time,

39:54.430 --> 39:56.089
we have got Self-realization.

39:56.089 --> 40:03.089
Very few people got it. Not only that, we
have been blessed with so many things. But

40:06.030 --> 40:13.030
above all we are so powerful. And all these
powers must be manifested, must be used, must

40:13.440 --> 40:20.440
be worked out. And this superficiality of
living on a very mundane style is not going

40:23.170 --> 40:29.369
to help us. We have to really go deep down
into ourselves. I mean you are seekers, no

40:29.369 --> 40:35.559
doubt, you are seekers of truth. And you have
found it also. How many have found it? So

40:35.559 --> 40:42.049
many are already lost if you see as hippies,
as this, as that, as TM, as another this Rajneesh.

40:42.049 --> 40:46.559
I’ve seen some other lady here, two months
she came. How much she was caught up. She

40:46.559 --> 40:53.230
was just worried. So many are lost like that.
But you are the people who have got the knowledge,

40:53.230 --> 40:57.880
you are God’s people, you have got the truth
with you, and all these powers are within

40:57.880 --> 40:59.400
you, but you must use them.

40:59.400 --> 41:04.140
But I’ve seen even after coming to Sahaja
Yoga some people get lost in the temptation

41:04.140 --> 41:08.740
because they get money. Some people get some
talents, they get lost in the talents. Some

41:08.740 --> 41:15.609
people get some powers, they’ll get lost
with them. That’s not the way. You see if

41:15.609 --> 41:22.609
God has given you this Realization, He expects
you, to give Realizations to others, to go

41:24.539 --> 41:31.539
deep down into your Self. This is what we
have to do is to really work out, our depth.

41:32.589 --> 41:34.829
It all exists within us. You never knew there
is Spirit within us. Is there. You never knew

41:34.829 --> 41:41.410
there is Ganesha within us. Is there. And
when you started awakening them, you found

41:41.410 --> 41:48.410
it works, it works. It has worked such wonders,
health wise, wealth wise, in every way. But

41:50.349 --> 41:57.349
spiritually, how far we are? How do you judge
a person who is spiritually evolved, is that,

41:59.280 --> 42:06.280
even a desire works out. Any, desire works
out. And such a person doesn’t have any

42:08.380 --> 42:15.380
funny desires. Absolutely it works out. And
that’s what I want Australians to do because

42:17.220 --> 42:24.220
you are special people born in this country
of Ganesha. Perhaps we forget sometimes that

42:24.650 --> 42:31.549
you are born in the land of Shri Ganesha.
Very special people [INAUDIBLE: you are?].

42:31.549 --> 42:38.549
Very special. So have respect for yourself.
And also must, manifest your glory. That otherwise,

42:40.880 --> 42:46.930
of all the places from Russia, Sahaja Yoga
will spread, it’s not, I mean, never expected

42:46.930 --> 42:53.859
that. But it may, it may I tell you they are
so deep, so very deep people. Extremely deep.

42:53.859 --> 43:00.859
I don’t know what has given this. Materialism
I think is responsible for our superficiality.

43:01.260 --> 43:05.900
They are not materialistic. About thirty percent
people are materialistic, the rest are not.

43:05.900 --> 43:12.900
They are all seeking the spirit in the real
sense of the word. Not just for fashion. Very

43:14.760 --> 43:21.760
remarkable. Very loving. Very beautiful. I
was there, they came. They arranged that,

43:31.770 --> 43:37.010
from one place, some people will come only
for two days then two days. And where I had

43:37.010 --> 43:42.740
purchased a little cottage, they, there are
some places where they can live in a small

43:42.740 --> 43:46.630
little huts like that. They all came and stayed
there. I didn’t know where they were living

43:46.630 --> 43:51.589
or anything. Early in the morning they would
come, bring some flowers, and plant the flowers

43:51.589 --> 43:58.589
in the garden, flowers, itself. And would
not say anything and go away. Sit down for

43:59.809 --> 44:00.440
meditation.

44:00.440 --> 44:06.839
One day suddenly I discovered all of them
sitting there meditating. So surprised. And

44:06.839 --> 44:09.869
then it was this Gorbachov problems came up.
So I said: ‘Now what are you going to do?’

44:09.869 --> 44:16.869
‘What are we doing? We are in the kingdom
of God. Why should we worry about Gorbachov

44:22.170 --> 44:26.859
or anyone, why should we?’ We are not worried.
Beautiful people. Beautiful.

44:26.859 --> 44:31.680
Very collective. Also this is the blessing
of, communism they are very collective. I

44:31.680 --> 44:36.720
have seen that also in Calcutta. People are
extremely collective. They don’t talk ill

44:36.720 --> 44:43.720
of others. Very collective people. It’s
not like: ‘Come to my house. Oh You must

44:45.670 --> 44:50.069
visit. This thing, this is my daughter...’
That ‘my-ness’ I didn’t see, in Russia

44:50.069 --> 44:54.849
and in Calcutta. I was surprised. Calcutta
also has communistic, communist government.

44:54.849 --> 44:57.770
How it has worked out, I can’t say. So are
you spreading Sahaja Yoga? How many people

44:57.770 --> 44:58.020
give Realization?

44:57.819 --> 45:01.049
Yogi: [INAUDIBLE] We all do it together collectively.

45:01.049 --> 45:08.049
Shri Mataji: Now you are doing. You all have
to do it. It’s very important. All of you

45:28.460 --> 45:35.460
should ask this question: ‘What have I done
for God?’ Look at these flowers that you

45:43.809 --> 45:50.809
brought. They are so fragrant. They are so
beautiful. They are going to live for a very

45:54.480 --> 46:01.480
short time. But what pleasure. What expression
of your love they give. How beautiful they

46:06.190 --> 46:13.190
are. Australians have a very big role to play.
As I expect from Ganesha, I expect from you

46:59.270 --> 46:59.859
also.

46:59.859 --> 47:06.859
Yogi: …from Hong Kong, from Alex and Kate.
And they managed to get some editorial in

47:13.299 --> 47:20.190
the newspaper, for their programs as a run-up
to your visit. And in the first program they

47:20.190 --> 47:22.609
got sixty Chinese people, very good quality
people.

47:22.609 --> 47:29.609
Shri Mataji: Oh Look at Alex. Alex is really
special I must say. Such a beautiful boy.

47:30.730 --> 47:37.730
When his mother died, and he was staying with
Me, so I said: ‘Alex won’t to go to your

47:38.339 --> 47:41.599
mother?’ So he said: ‘Mother, there’s
no seat available. Will take about four, five

47:41.599 --> 47:48.599
days to get a seat by the time it goes on.
So what is the need. I am with You.’ Said:

47:54.940 --> 48:01.940
‘You did try?’ Said: ‘I did little bit,
not much, because I saw You, and I knew that

48:03.250 --> 48:10.250
my mother will have Eternal life, so why should
I worry.’ Now he’s saying that Alex has

48:11.539 --> 48:18.539
got sixty Chinese people in Hong Kong. I couldn’t
get even one.

48:28.309 --> 48:35.309
Chinese are another one. If Sahaja Yoga gets
into their heads, they’re very traditional,

48:36.400 --> 48:43.400
very, very deep, very deep people, Chinese.
The Prime Minister of China, I met him when

48:48.059 --> 48:55.059
I went there, in a photograph he’s just
next to Me standing. After that he became

48:55.109 --> 49:02.109
Prime Minister, not that time. A very nice
man. And he was asking Me about spiritual

49:03.099 --> 49:08.680
life, all the time. I showed complete ignorance,
you see. I said these communists God knows

49:08.680 --> 49:14.079
what they are up to. I didn’t tell him.
But I think we can approach him now. Somehow

49:14.079 --> 49:21.079
or another they got very fond of Me, all the
Chinese government and all. Somehow. Some

49:21.869 --> 49:28.809
sort of an auspiciousness they felt about
Me. I couldn’t understand them, what made

49:28.809 --> 49:35.809
them, respect Me so much. They had one exhibition,
one which they had invited Me and My husband,

49:41.119 --> 49:47.859
and I couldn’t go at this point. And, the
next day was closed, that exhibition must

49:47.859 --> 49:54.690
be closed but they kept it open for Me alone.
And they said: ‘You must see the exhibition,

49:54.690 --> 50:01.690
it’s important.’ I don’t know, they
have their own ways of understanding.

50:03.690 --> 50:10.690
We had Confucius there. They follow more Confucius
now, our Confucius who has talked about general

50:14.369 --> 50:21.369
well-being and all that. But not so much about
Tao, that they don’t talk. But they are

50:30.160 --> 50:36.690
extremely humble Chinese. Very humble. You
try to praise them and they say: ‘No, no.

50:36.690 --> 50:43.690
We have to do much better than this, nothing.’
They can never get pampered you see, you couldn’t

50:47.109 --> 50:54.109
praise them, never. They are very much like
Russians, in so many ways. I can see Sahaja

51:12.559 --> 51:19.559
Yogis here. Any questions? Tania is very happy
with her husband. Very happy.

51:38.480 --> 51:42.710
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji she’s happy.

51:42.710 --> 51:46.240
Shri Mataji: She’s very happy.

51:46.240 --> 51:51.890
Yogi: Mother did you know she has hepatitis?

51:51.890 --> 51:58.890
Shri Mataji: She has what? She too? I’ve
told him what is the thing. Can you fax to

52:06.099 --> 52:13.099
Dr Spiro? [HINDI EXCHANGE] Faxes. She is on
the liver… or her husband, was just like

52:16.510 --> 52:23.510
a child. But see him when he sings, absolutely.
Remarkable. There’s that one with a super-

52:30.700 --> 52:37.700
intelligence I see. Wonderful. She’s happy
because she can come to pujas, we are now

52:39.880 --> 52:46.880
there. She is very happy about that. She’s
happy in Spain also. Italians are better but

52:49.549 --> 52:56.549
not Spanish people. Spanish are little [INAUDIBLE]
I think this American conquering has reflected

52:57.819 --> 53:01.760
in their character.

53:01.760 --> 53:08.760
There are also some misunderstanding of people
think that I have said that the men should

53:10.480 --> 53:17.480
dominate women. Never. I am Myself a woman
and then, if men start dominating Me what

53:22.630 --> 53:29.630
will happen? But the man is the, head of the
family. So the woman, should get her authority

53:30.819 --> 53:36.710
from him but she has her own authority, as
a mother, and the husband must respect her.

53:36.710 --> 53:43.170
Otherwise he’ll never be respected. So it’s
kind of mutual understanding between the two

53:43.170 --> 53:48.599
as I have said that, they are the two wheels
of a chariot, one on the left one on the right.

53:48.599 --> 53:55.599
If you change the wheels, then what will happen?
They are absolutely, equal no doubt. Absolutely

53:59.289 --> 54:04.760
equal. Only they are not similar, which we
must understand that we are not similar. Is

54:04.760 --> 54:11.760
nice to be a woman, I tell you, it’s much
better. Because men have to face so many people,

54:12.170 --> 54:19.170
face so many bosses. You have only one boss,
and if you know how to manage him…

54:20.950 --> 54:27.950
But should be done sweetly, with understanding.
It works out with your, wisdom. Must have

54:34.829 --> 54:41.609
the wisdom, how to manage it. But that’s
a part of the game, and one has to play it

54:41.609 --> 54:47.480
well. Not to feel any way dominated by anything,
but it’s a, kind of a framework one has

54:47.480 --> 54:53.680
to work with. Now supposing this is on our
head. This is not dominating us, but it has

54:53.680 --> 55:00.680
to be there. So a kind of a framework is there,
and that framework is to be accepted. Both

55:01.109 --> 55:08.029
of them should accept and the husband should
never make her feel that he is dominating

55:08.029 --> 55:09.049
her.

55:09.049 --> 55:15.700
Actually, in India the custom is that husbands
are also very clever, not only the women.

55:15.700 --> 55:21.230
So normally they’ll give all the money to
the wife to be managed, and later on take

55:21.230 --> 55:28.230
away all of that. And always they’ll say:
‘All right’. They’ll say: ‘All right’,

55:28.410 --> 55:35.410
the son to her, like guru and all that. Means:
‘You are my lord and this and that and…’

55:35.970 --> 55:39.900
That’s how they keep it up. Because one
thing they must understand is that if wife

55:39.900 --> 55:46.200
is all right the family is all right. If wife
is all right your life is all right. So you

55:46.200 --> 55:51.710
must look after your wife. Very important.
If you understand that point the men will

55:51.710 --> 55:55.079
never try to dominate. Is a wrong idea is
I don’t know from where it has trickled

55:55.079 --> 56:02.079
down that I have said, the men should dominate
a woman. But false prestige should not be

56:02.230 --> 56:03.619
there.

56:03.619 --> 56:10.619
Like in America we went first. You know American
women, how they are. They’ll divorce ten

56:11.809 --> 56:14.940
times, and have all the money of the men.
The men are just like beggars and they are

56:14.940 --> 56:21.940
so rich. It’s a profession with them. The
women have this profession of divorcing men.

56:23.500 --> 56:28.230
So they had cooked and all that. So I said:
‘All right let the boys eat first and then

56:28.230 --> 56:32.299
you can eat later on.’ They said: ‘Mother
this is domination.’ I said: ‘Why? Eating

56:32.299 --> 56:36.609
first is domination or later on domination.’
I think eating there, later on is domination,

56:36.609 --> 56:42.779
because you are at peace you see. Eat as much
as you like. But if somebody is eating first,

56:42.779 --> 56:49.630
then he’s in a hurry to finish for the next
lot that has to come up. But if you are the

56:49.630 --> 56:56.329
second one then you are relaxed you are eating
the way you like. There’s nothing to feed.

56:56.329 --> 57:02.220
And moreover, it’s an attitude I think that:
‘I love to cook, I love to serve I enjoy

57:02.220 --> 57:07.289
it. I enjoy.’ It’s a, temperament of a
woman. She wants to feed people, she likes

57:07.289 --> 57:14.289
it. I tell you, My grandchildren, daughters,
both of them, they were quite small, I asked

57:14.450 --> 57:20.789
them what do you want to be in life. So they
said: ‘We want to be a nurse or an airhostess.’

57:20.789 --> 57:25.849
So I said: ‘Why these two?’ ‘In these
only two professions you can give food to

57:25.849 --> 57:31.750
people. That’s why.’ And they play, you
know, they play like that. They’ll make

57:31.750 --> 57:33.960
a tray in that they will [INAUDIBLE].

57:33.960 --> 57:40.150
So this is actually innate feeling of a child.
Like once My daughter told girls, that if

57:40.150 --> 57:44.510
somebody comes from outside you must make
him sit on the sofa there. You must see that

57:44.510 --> 57:50.000
the fan is open. Give them something to eat,
take out from the fridge and all that. So

57:50.000 --> 57:54.670
one washerman, the dhobi came in. They called
for [INAUDIBLE] to sit on the sofa. Said:

57:54.670 --> 57:59.289
‘I can’t sit.’ ‘You have to sit.’
‘I’m in a hurry.’ ‘Nothing you have

57:59.289 --> 58:02.880
to sit.’ They made him sit, opened the fan,
got everything from the fridge, put it before

58:02.880 --> 58:06.819
him. ‘You have to eat, otherwise we’ll
feed,’ you see. And when My daughter entered

58:06.819 --> 58:13.150
the house she saw these girls feeding him
with their own hands. Got such a fright. He

58:13.150 --> 58:16.690
said: ‘I’m sorry these girls I don’t
know what are they are.’ They said: ‘You

58:16.690 --> 58:20.519
told us and we’re very happy we are doing
that.’ So innately children have this feeling

58:20.519 --> 58:27.519
in their hearts, as girls. And then when we
get a chance we want to do it. I mean, it’s

58:31.119 --> 58:33.880
such a pleasure, to feed someone.

58:33.880 --> 58:39.869
You must have seen with Indian women, it’s
very common they love to feed others, they’re

58:39.869 --> 58:46.869
very happy. And, I mean there’s no domination
I mean if you have to feed someone, that doesn’t

58:48.960 --> 58:54.640
mean that somebody’s dominating you these
are all nonsensical norms. On the contrary

58:54.640 --> 59:01.640
it’s a privilege. Otherwise after sometime
we’ll find, that men will be sitting at

59:01.640 --> 59:08.640
home and the women will be going out. That
will be, that’s already a situation I mean.

59:56.710 --> 01:00:03.710
[It’s hot for children I think we are in
a cabin, like the ship I think, without the

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:15.819
sea. And there’s no air-conditioning properly.
Outside is better.] So, any questions? [INAUDIBLE

01:01:15.819 --> 01:01:19.260
something about entrepreneurs and a book]
Entrepreneurs? I see. It’s quite a small

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:19.779
book I have to say.

01:01:19.779 --> 01:01:20.609
Yogini: …the entrepreneurs, plastic surgeons,
the cosmetic industry, fashion industry…

01:01:20.609 --> 01:01:20.859
Shri Mataji: So what are they saying?

01:01:20.839 --> 01:01:21.410
Yogini: I think the bottom line is that women
have got very poor, self image through those

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.809
[INAUDIBLE] It’s a multimillion dollar business
[INAUDIBLE] people are forcing women into

01:01:21.809 --> 01:01:22.059
and women are trapped…

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:22.289
Shri Mataji: So that, and then they’re saying,
so women can’t do this and...

01:01:22.289 --> 01:01:22.690
Yogini:… talk about how women are frightened
to grow old, that there is no culture…

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:24.950
Shri Mataji: You see in, I can have the book?
In Germany, when I went, there was a lady

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:28.400
and she was telling Me that in Germany, if
you get old then the men go after younger

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:28.980
girls, because you are left alone. Then you
have to marry some older man, who is left

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.769
by his wife or something. It’s a big danger.
I said: ‘Why don’t you produce children.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:33.430
I mean they get, if you have four children
they get more money than the Prime Minister.’

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:39.670
They said: ‘But then you cannot have a husband.’
Either you have children or you have a husband.

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:40.930
It’s like that.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:46.779
It is because, I tell you, it’s very superficial,
very materialistic superficial ideas, about

01:01:46.779 --> 01:01:53.779
women also. They’re a commodity. In Sahaja
Yoga woman, is a person, as equal as a man,

01:01:55.089 --> 01:02:02.089
you see. It’s very different. They are just
a commodity to be used, whenever they want

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:11.660
to. And I must say also some women know the
weaknesses of men and try to work it out in

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:19.200
such a manner. Sometimes the women only, trouble
women, also. They don’t understand that

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:24.240
she’s a woman and I’m a woman I should
not try to trouble. But in sort of competitiveness,

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:30.940
they do wrong things and try to destroy another’s
life.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:37.170
But men will have to change now, it’s coming
to that. All these tricks they have tried

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:44.170
and they are now having, lot of problem. There
are diseases that are coming up. Already there’s

01:02:44.579 --> 01:02:49.039
lots of already these secret diseases there.
Apart from these secret diseases there are

01:02:49.039 --> 01:02:55.839
diseases which are stopping them, new diseases.
So now they’ll have to come to monogamy.

01:02:55.839 --> 01:03:00.609
Once they come to monogamy, then they’ll
have to realize the value of women, what they

01:03:00.609 --> 01:03:01.130
are.

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:08.130
And in this all, quarrel about ordination.
Imagine Christianity is so stupid that they

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:19.880
can’t have women for ordination. Now I am
a Woman after all. And now as a reaction,

01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:27.549
women are so angry, that a girl came to Me
the other day I was in Perth she said: ‘Mother,

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:35.000
why did you call God as ‘He’, why don’t
you call as ‘She’?’ I said: ‘Because

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:41.920
I am ‘She’ that’s why I have to call
Him ‘He.’ But this concept is only, is

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:48.920
still there. In the Indian scriptures nowhere,
that there’s God, and His Power is Adi Shakti.

01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:58.890
But nowhere, even Islam, in Christianity,
in Judaism, in what you call, Buddhism, Jainism,

01:04:00.529 --> 01:04:07.529
nowhere. They have not talked of the woman
at all. As if the whole world is made of men.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.609
And this is surprisingly for developed countries
in Sweden countries like this, they are talking

01:04:17.609 --> 01:04:24.609
this nonsense. But the solution is only Sahaja
Yoga. There’s no other solution. Even women

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:35.630
go and fight with men what’s the use? Men
fight with women no use. So the best thing

01:04:39.259 --> 01:04:45.789
for them is to get to Sahaja Yoga to understand
the value of women. They understand what they

01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:52.789
are for, and what is our relationship means
you see. It’s such an enjoyment. Stupid

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:57.539
those people who do not want to have that
enjoyment.

01:04:57.539 --> 01:05:03.039
Also your media is responsible whenever you
open the television you just find husband

01:05:03.039 --> 01:05:08.140
wife fighting …It’s too much. All the
time fighting, fighting, they show…they

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.470
never show good relationship. Once I asked
Derek Lee: ‘Is there any novel where they

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:19.279
show the romance of husband and wife?’ He
said: ‘There’s no book’. No book in

01:05:19.279 --> 01:05:22.500
English. The whole of English language there’s
no romance of husband and wife, can you imagine.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.059
I mean that is how you get into tragedies.

01:05:26.059 --> 01:05:33.059
But in India if you see, the literature has
certain ethics. One of them is only the romance

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:42.150
between husband and wife is a romance. The
rest of it is, vulgarity. This is the concept

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:51.200
it shows. Also because mostly they are arranged
marriages, so they don’t know all this romanticism

01:05:58.289 --> 01:06:05.289
before marriage. So they are waiting for their
wife and whole thing, and the wife becomes

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:10.059
everything to the husband, and same, vice
versa. So the whole cultural concept has changed.

01:06:10.059 --> 01:06:16.960
It used to be the same way before, in every
country, but now we are advanced you see.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:23.960
In that advancement we have done this kind
of a thing, is to make antagonistic societies

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:31.109
of men and women. It’s very sad. But we
are very superficial.

01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:38.109
But the concept itself is wrong. I think the
basic fundamental thing, in the western culture

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:47.930
is, to see and to be seen. This is what I’ve
realized. That’s the culture. That people

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:55.490
should see you, and you should be able to
see others. I mean, it is so superficial.

01:06:55.490 --> 01:07:01.539
Now they see somebody’s legs and somebody’s
knees, I mean, what’s the use of a joyless

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:03.869
pursuit. That person doesn’t belong to you
nothing of the kind. What’s the use of seeing

01:07:03.869 --> 01:07:10.869
these things? But this, we have become very
superficial. And it’s going on and on. But

01:07:15.619 --> 01:07:22.099
I think this will all stop in Sahaja Yoga,
gradually we’ll start seeing the beauty

01:07:22.099 --> 01:07:23.150
inside.

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:30.150
You know Chris Marlow you know from London.
He had a wife Jane. She was quite a dry person.

01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:41.009
She herself was saying that: ‘Mother I am
no good for him.’ So they divorced. Then

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:45.690
he told Me: ‘Mother I want to marry a girl
who has lots of vibrations.’ I said: ‘What

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:51.170
about looks?’ ‘No I don’t see any looks.
I want to see a girl with vibrations.’ And

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:56.170
we had a girl from Amalhabad. Very dark, extremely
dark, and village-like, absolutely. You will

01:07:56.170 --> 01:08:03.170
never, I mean, I don’t think from your standards
she may not be beautiful from My standards

01:08:03.539 --> 01:08:08.170
she was very good. Full of vibrations. Full
of vibrations. As soon as she came on the

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:15.170
stage he jumped, said: ‘This is the one.’
He’s so tall, she’s short and [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:21.950
And he looks after her so well I tell you.
And then he went to her place, her village,

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:26.560
all the way to Amalhabad. My sister saw, she
said: ‘What a couple.’ I said: ‘The

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:33.560
couple has chosen each other, I can’t help
it.’ He’s so fond of her, he looks after

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:39.650
her. She’s very sweet, I mean I really love
with that. But I didn’t know that this fellow

01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:46.650
will have the same sort of a feeling. Because
we are superficial these things are accepred.

01:08:53.650 --> 01:09:00.270
You should see the inner being. How beautiful
it is.

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:07.270
Look at that Elizabeth Taylor, that stupid
country of America. This was her eighth divorce,

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:17.480
I mean eighth honeymoon. So they had three
thousand or four thousand people just standing

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.490
outside her house to see, she is going for
her honeymoon. Can you imagine stupid. And

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:30.490
there were ten helicopters hovering round.
And they were parachuting, and some of them

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:40.230
fell on the trees and some fell on the people
who were there. And they were quite excited,

01:09:40.230 --> 01:09:47.060
very sensational. You know such stupid people
these Americans are. I don’t know what to

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:54.060
say. And this lady had divorced eight. And
this husband of hers, this one, he’s I think,

01:09:56.050 --> 01:10:01.740
I don’t know how many years younger to her,
like her son. And also he’s an ordinary

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:08.740
man or something. But just for the heck of
it. She has no sense of marriage, nothing.

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:16.740
But what she has done is she’s operated
her eyelids and she’s put her up and all

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.600
that, and she looks younger now and she says:
‘I can…’ There’s no, in that country

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:29.520
you cannot mature. So stupid. I mean, I was
yet to come across people in a group so stupid

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:36.520
as that. Stupidest people you see. Stupidest.
You can never mature this way.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:45.280
Still Sahaja Yoga is now working. Gregoire
feels so exhausted. Every time he footsoaks

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:56.190
he just lies flat, saying: ‘Mother, please
save me from New York.’ It’s terrible.

01:10:56.330 --> 01:11:03.330
There’s no way of maturity. [INAUDIBLE]
They invited me for this Jungian Society.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.070
And I went there. Of course I didn’t read
Jung much but that day I got hold of a book

01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:15.070
and I found out the reason why Indians have
failed. So I talked to them they were very

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:21.160
much impressed and all that. Then the president
of that society is eighty years of age, and

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.500
he said that: ‘Mother I must see You I have
some private thing to talk.’ I said: ‘All

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.030
right.’ This old man came about eighty years
of age. He said: ‘I have a very serious

01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:32.030
problem.’ I said: ‘What’s the serious
problem.’ He says: ‘You see I had a keep.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:39.380
Because I am a Catholic I could not marry
the keep but I never told my wife. [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:47.930
I never told my wife.’ ‘So now what am
I supposed to do ?’ He said: ‘Now that

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:54.020
my wife is dead and I want that keep to stay
with me but she has refused. Can you do something

01:11:54.020 --> 01:12:01.020
to see that the keep stays with me.’ I said:
‘It’s all right.’ Eighty year-old man.

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:08.600
I was turning sixty by that time. An eighty
year-old man talking like this to Me. I said:

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:15.600
‘Now what is happening to this man?’ And
he is the chairman of the Jungian Society,

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:26.100
International. See the maturity of that person.
Eighty year-old.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:33.550
In America, such cases so much. Terrible.
Extremely stupid and I don’t know, they

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:43.450
have no confidence in themselves. All the
time they think we should not get old. So

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:50.450
there was, on the television they showed the
cinema actors and actresses coming for a dance

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:55.610
of ‘shake’ and they were all about ninety
years of age. Then when they got down from

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:57.890
the car only they were shaking. I said: ‘What’s
the use, of going to shake?’ In ninety years

01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:04.890
they have not grown. Funny dresses they were
wearing and all that. So when are they going

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:14.550
to grow. There’s no maturity. The atmosphere
is the other way round I think. Very stupid.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:31.800
Really mad. But people start copying them.
Whatever they say people listen to them even

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:37.460
English I’m surprised. I said that: ‘You
are sensible people. Why do you follow these

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:43.290
stupid Americans, or the French?’ English
people are rather mature. Maybe they lived

01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:46.920
in India so they have matured quickly I don’t
know why. But compared with these stupid people

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:51.950
they are much more mature. And now they are
following the American style. They used to

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:58.950
follow first the French style, now the American
style. They don’t stand on their own legs.

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:06.930
But Italians have a good sense of ridicule.
They understand what is ridiculous, that’s

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:13.930
something about them. A great sense of ridiculous.
It will all change in Sahaja Yoga it will.

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:26.890
You are in the Kingdom of God. You shouldn’t
worry about these things. But what to do,

01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:35.270
if they join us they can come up. But they
don’t want to, let them be like as they

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:47.500
are. What else?

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.440
Yogini:…lymphatic system…

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:57.440
Shri Mataji: Lymphatic system? If the lymphatic
system is under attack you may be left-sided.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:19.520
You see it is, on the whole, there are only
two types of problems actually. Third type

01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:29.310
doesn’t exist, or doesn’t bother us. One
is the left another is the right, you see.

01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:34.280
Now the lymphatic system is actually, the
combination of both. It’s a psychosomatic

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:39.790
disease. For that you have to do just three-candle
treatment. You see it is reduced to such a

01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:46.790
simple thing either you do three-candle treatment,
or you do water treatment. The third type

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:55.160
is the one where you have been to wrong gurus,
in the center. If I run some wrong type of

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:06.020
meditation [INAUDIBLE]. For that also it’s
three-candle treatment, mostly. Or maybe if

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:11.710
the [INAUDIBLE] comes there’s a little change
also sometimes. But whatever it is, this is

01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:16.960
very simple for physical. Anybody has lymphatic
system problem has to do left side first.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.860
So this is psychosomatic.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:24.860
First you must get rid of the psycho side,
so do the left side. When it is cleared out,

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:31.660
then right side is not difficult. If you are
too right-sided, then what happens, it’s

01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:38.660
like a pendulum, you move from right to left.
Then psychosomatic troubles start. The best

01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:45.910
is first to remove the left, then is look
after the right. Sahaja Yoga is a very simple

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:53.620
way of clearing. It works. Somebody should
help you in left side is to give you bandhan

01:16:54.100 --> 01:17:01.100
on your chakras with a candle. Put a candle
on one side of the left swadisthana and also

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:09.260
one before the Photograph. Because it’s
all due to viruses. And the viruses are there

01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:18.240
because your attention in the left. Once your
attention goes away from there you are rid

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:25.240
of that. All right? It’s not complicated.
Sahaja Yoga is very simple.

01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:33.710
You know we have cured people who were about
to go on the dialysis. Kidney has been cured.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.930
Can you imagine? Of course [INAUDIBLE] blood
cancer that has been cured no doubt. But imagine

01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:47.930
the kidney, people were going on the dialysis.

01:17:54.610 --> 01:18:01.610
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION] Of course. I mean, we
make the human beings. [INAUDIBLE] You first,

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:13.310
if you are evolving, you are also evolving
human beings with you. So it’s for the emancipation

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:20.960
of the whole world. It’s not only your evolution.
No no not at all. That was over. Now I have

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:34.080
told about that in [INAUDIBLE], is that, from
Buddha’s future they say there will be a

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:41.230
future Buddha who will be Maitreya. Maitreya
means Three Mothers together, will be the

01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:47.820
future Buddha. And that is called as Bodhisattva.
Now the Bodhisattva is the One, who will become

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:53.800
Buddha, means who will get Enlightened right,
and will work for the other people. So is

01:18:53.800 --> 01:19:00.390
already described, and you don’t have to
suffer, you don’t have to do anything as

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:07.390
it was before individually, but now you’ll
work with the collective. So, you have to

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:14.230
work with the collective otherwise you have
no meaning. Also you cannot be cleansed unless

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:18.150
and until you come to collective. If you say:
‘I’m staying at home and I’m doing all

01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:25.150
the puja and all that,’ doesn’t work out.
Like a nail if it is cut, it doesn’t grow.

01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:37.910
Very simple. It’s not for one person no
doubt. I mean how can it be, for one. Because

01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:51.890
the time has come for doing collective work
now. The whole world has to change.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:02.920
Yogi: Shri Mother, will we ever be able to
go to Tasmania?

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:17.930
Shri Mataji: [HINDI] That’s [INAUDIBLE].
Yes they have to come. They have to come here.

01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:25.690
Like you see, Sicily, we are now having lots
of Sahaja Yogis there. They all came down.

01:20:25.690 --> 01:20:32.570
Then I can now go to Sicily. We have very
great people in Tasmania. Now that’s the

01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:37.220
point. So when they will come and they’ll
get their Realization then I can go. You see,

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:44.220
if I go to a place it is like the, should
I say, the seeds being sprouted nobody to

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:51.520
look after.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:58.520
Yogi: There were quite a number of people
who came from Tasmania. I think some of them

01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:04.260
wonder if they could ever go back.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.760
Shri Mataji: They should. They should. They
should go with their bandhans and try to save

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.410
their country. They should. If they go and
establish it I’ll definitely go. It’s

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:15.110
quite a remarkable place that Tasmania is.
Talismad means, all these secret, magic. From

01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:21.150
that Tasmania word must have come.

01:21:21.150 --> 01:21:28.150
Yogi: How many Tasmanians are there here?

01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:36.330
Shri Mataji: Still very few, to fight those
negativities there. Very negative. Very negative,

01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:49.090
isn’t it. That’s like, we have Calcutta.
Too much of black magic. Too much. But gradually

01:21:55.710 --> 01:22:00.360
we have now, got it out. It’s changed. One
side is they are all full of black magic,

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.850
those who believe in God. The another side
are communists. But still now we have thousands.

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:10.850
It is remarkable. But people had to work very
hard for it, very hard. So many people went

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:24.850
from Nagpur, from Bombay, from Delhi to help
them. Still some places I’ve not been, like

01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:34.180
Ceylon, Assam. We have some coming from there.
I told them next year I’ll try to be there.

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:34.430
Yogi: Shri Mataji, …Photograph where Hands
are like that. Can you tell us the significance

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:39.480
of that please?

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:46.480
Shri Mataji: Hands like that. You want to
know what’s the symbol? This is for assurance.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:11.080
See this is for assurance. It has powers.
This Hand has tremendous powers. And this

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:19.140
One is for giving. You see. So these are two
aspects. But actually as you know this is

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:26.180
the, power of action. So it acts. And this
is the power of desire. So this is the Love

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:41.460
that’s flowing of your Mother, and this
is how She [INAUDIBLE] it. But now I have

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:57.540
given up. I used to do it in the beginning
it was needed, but now it’s not necessary.

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:37.020
It works even without that. They are called
as mudras which I used in the beginning. Now

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:14.360
I don’t use that, mostly.
