Kundalini: Questions & Answers

00:17.789 --> 00:24.292
[Seeker says he has studied about Kundalini

00:24.545 --> 00:33.725
and tells about his experimentations
and feelings.]

00:33.926 --> 00:37.918
Shri Mataji: You see, if you, if you try
your own self, you see,

00:38.119 --> 00:41.394
trying with the Kundalini, actually
sympathetic goes into activity.

00:41.595 --> 00:44.269
You have no right on the parasympathetic.

00:44.470 --> 00:47.810
Parasympathetic is the one which balances.
And that is the central path

00:48.011 --> 00:50.602
of Sushumna, through which the Kundalini
has to rise.

00:50.803 --> 00:55.155
But if you try anything, what you do is
always you can use sympathetic.

00:55.356 --> 00:58.494
I’ll give you an example. Supposing
you are running fast, alright?

00:58.695 --> 01:03.133
Then you can raise the rate of your heart.
But you cannot slow it down.

01:03.334 --> 01:06.205
It slows down by itself, that is
parasympathetic activity.

01:06.406 --> 01:08.598
So you just get into sympathetic activity,

01:08.799 --> 01:11.606
and by sympathetic activity, if you
overdo it,

01:11.807 --> 01:15.878
then all these symptoms happen.
And it’s not helpful.

01:16.079 --> 01:18.300
On the contrary, chakras go into - quite

01:18.469 --> 01:21.197
like, this is the left and the right
sympathetic

01:21.398 --> 01:24.230
and these are the centers. They get
pulled down like that.

01:24.431 --> 01:28.230
And if they are pulled like this, then
you are harmed.

01:28.431 --> 01:34.708
So it is, it is not an experience
of Kundalini but is of the sympathetic.

01:34.909 --> 01:51.090
[The seeker makes a comment on chakras
and then asks,

01:51.543 --> 01:55.902
“But how Kundalini went down instead
of coming up?”]

01:56.103 --> 01:58.275
Shri Mataji: No, it doesn’t go down.
Kundalini never goes down,

01:58.476 --> 02:00.845
it goes upward, always.

02:01.053 --> 02:04.540
The thing that comes down is the grace,
you see? The grace comes down,

02:04.741 --> 02:08.939
not the Kundalini. Kundalini always
goes upwards.

02:09.140 --> 02:12.478
And the grace comes on your sympathetic,
which cools you down,

02:12.679 --> 02:15.306
completely. You become absolutely
relaxed with the grace.

02:15.507 --> 02:20.159
But the Kundalini itself always goes
upward, it never comes down.

02:20.360 --> 02:23.643
But in people it so happens

02:23.844 --> 02:26.424
that Kundalini goes through
the central path.

02:26.625 --> 02:31.907
Now if it is sort of very much ragged
or if it is this extremely smooth

02:32.108 --> 02:35.954
due to the mistakes of the seekers,
then it falls down.

02:36.155 --> 02:40.214
It falls down is a different point than
going like that. It falls down.

02:40.415 --> 02:43.074
Then you have to raise it again and
tie it up, again raise it

02:43.275 --> 02:48.480
and tie it up. In many people it has
to be done, but it can work out.

02:49.355 --> 02:51.290
You’ll get the complete knowledge,
don’t you worry.

02:51.491 --> 02:55.298
Now he has been as he said 18 months,
but he is a master of Kundalini.

02:55.499 --> 02:58.876
He can raise your Kundalini, and you are
just like him, you will become the same.

02:59.077 --> 03:02.626
There’s no, no problem at all.

03:04.201 --> 03:08.643
Seeker: I’d like to know if having
a vertebrae in the spine out of place

03:08.890 --> 03:12.143
interferes with the rising
of the Kundalini?

03:12.344 --> 03:14.651
Sahaja Yogi: Does having a vertebrae
out of place in the spine

03:14.852 --> 03:16.948
interfere with the rising of Kundalini?

03:17.148 --> 03:19.437
Shri Mataji: It does to some extent,
it does.

03:19.638 --> 03:21.687
Definitely it does, but we can put it
right.

03:21.888 --> 03:24.614
The vertebrae can be put right and
the Kundalini can be brought in.

03:24.815 --> 03:29.881
It does. So many things do happen,
if you have – you are a person overread;

03:30.082 --> 03:32.444
if you have read too many books
and the books are in your head,

03:32.645 --> 03:35.983
I have to empty that also.

03:38.684 --> 03:42.851
Sahaja Yogi: I actually do this work
as a profession and I find that

03:43.052 --> 03:48.273
if the subtle center is fixed, the spinal
problems just disappear.

03:48.474 --> 03:51.538
I used to have three and four adjustments
a week,

03:51.739 --> 03:54.788
to correct my spine and now I have
none at all.

03:54.989 --> 03:59.288
So first fix the subtle within us and then
the gross part,

03:59.489 --> 04:04.073
the spinal misalignments and so on,
will just get better.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.780
Seeker: Excuse me, may I ask a question
please? Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

04:08.981 --> 04:13.273
Seeker: What is the first step
to Self-realization?

04:13.474 --> 04:17.968
Sahaja Yogi: What is the first step
to Self-realization?

04:18.169 --> 04:22.265
Shri Mataji: There is nothing like first,
second. It’s not a course, you see.

04:22.466 --> 04:26.958
The Kundalini, it’s an awakening within us
which takes place,

04:27.127 --> 04:33.149
which is like a living process. All right?
So the Kundalini rises and shoots off here.

04:33.350 --> 04:39.515
Now, some people feel the Kundalini
wobbling down there, down below.

04:39.716 --> 04:42.027
Some people feel it in the stomach.

04:42.228 --> 04:45.747
Some people feel it here; some people
feel it here;

04:45.948 --> 04:49.786
but most of them feel it here only,
jetting out like cool breeze.

04:49.987 --> 04:52.935
So you just can’t say what is
the first step,

04:53.136 --> 04:59.357
depends on how it rises. So, everybody
doesn’t feel the same way.

04:59.558 --> 05:04.565
So I can’t say that this is the first
stage. All right?

05:05.712 --> 05:08.972
Of course, first you feel thoughtlessly
aware.

05:09.173 --> 05:12.534
You become thoughtlessly aware, first
thing that should happen to you

05:12.735 --> 05:16.136
when the Kundalini crosses this center.
When it comes out of it,

05:16.337 --> 05:20.102
you start feeling the cool breeze here,
and you start feeling the cool breeze

05:20.302 --> 05:23.485
in your hands, and you start feeling
the cool breeze around.

05:23.686 --> 05:27.163
That’s the second stage where it can go.

05:27.425 --> 05:30.442
Shri Mataji: What else?
Seeker: Can anyone be realized

05:30.643 --> 05:34.325
without knowing about Kundalini?
Sahaja Yogi: Can anyone be realized

05:34.526 --> 05:37.775
without knowing about Kundalini?

05:37.976 --> 05:40.753
Shri Mataji: About mentally need not
know much,

05:40.915 --> 05:43.097
it can be realized, of course you can be.

05:43.298 --> 05:47.893
But, then you have to tell them what it is,
this thing is better to do that way.

05:48.093 --> 05:51.155
But there will be very few who will accept
such a situation

05:51.356 --> 05:54.194
because they want to know about
everything.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.819
But they need not know all that, you can
little bit say,

05:57.020 --> 06:02.365
tell them that there is a way of getting
realization and then it’s like this that

06:02.566 --> 06:05.858
when you come to Me, you want to have
the lights, I’ll say all right,

06:06.059 --> 06:10.021
go there’s a switch you put on and you
put on the switch, you get the lights

06:10.222 --> 06:13.913
without telling about it. But you would
like to know how this light is done

06:14.114 --> 06:17.717
and then that helps you to create
other lights.

06:17.918 --> 06:21.178
That’s why, it is important to know
about Kundalini.

06:21.378 --> 06:23.817
I would, I can do it without telling you
anything

06:23.994 --> 06:25.966
about Kundalini, I can raise your Kundalini

06:26.168 --> 06:29.334
but you would not know anything about it
and you would not know what it is.

06:29.535 --> 06:32.561
It has happened with many who were
born realized –

06:32.762 --> 06:35.491
they did not know they were realized souls
and they got lost.

06:35.692 --> 06:40.124
Like I would say, greatest example,
Leonardo da Vinci.

06:40.325 --> 06:44.374
Leonardo da Vinci was a realized soul
and he got lost because he didn’t know

06:44.575 --> 06:47.678
he was a realized soul, he was a higher
personality than others,

06:47.879 --> 06:51.772
he got lost. So many got lost like that.

06:51.973 --> 06:54.834
Seeker: Excuse me, if your Kundalini
was arisen,

06:55.035 --> 06:59.647
how can you be lost, I mean, you have it,
so how can you be lost?

06:59.848 --> 07:03.124
Sahaja Yogi: How can you be lost if
the Kundalini has been awakened?

07:03.325 --> 07:07.199
Shri Mataji: No, it is, because, you see,
it is, you are not yet

07:07.400 --> 07:12.303
fully developed matured person. When you
are in an immature state it does happen.

07:12.504 --> 07:15.137
Kundalini is, when it rises, you’ll be
surprised,

07:15.338 --> 07:18.178
in some people it is just a wee bit,
just like a hair,

07:18.379 --> 07:20.730
just comes up a little bit because
it’s so difficult, you see,

07:20.932 --> 07:25.028
the passage is so blocked so a little bit
comes up. This is what it is.

07:25.229 --> 07:29.489
It is, a complete realization takes place
only when you are in Nirvikalpa samadhi –

07:29.690 --> 07:33.215
that’s a higher state. So in the beginning
it’s just a little wee bit opens up

07:33.416 --> 07:37.821
and one percent people do get lost,
they do, because they have egos,

07:38.022 --> 07:42.418
they have superegos, all kinds of things –
they do get lost – so be careful.

07:43.975 --> 07:48.866
Seeker: How and where did you receive
the power to awaken the Kundalini?

07:49.171 --> 07:53.209
Shri Mataji: Me?
Seeker: In the people.

07:53.451 --> 07:57.399
Shri Mataji: How and...? Sahaja yogi: How
and where did you receive the ability

07:57.600 --> 08:02.016
to awaken the Kundalini in them?

08:02.224 --> 08:06.421
Shri Mataji: I had it born with it.

08:10.753 --> 08:13.999
One can be born with it.

08:17.076 --> 08:23.041
But I realized that to give en masse
realization,

08:23.242 --> 08:27.221
seventh center has to be open,
first of all.

08:27.422 --> 08:38.953
That I did on the fifth of May 1970
and then I realized

08:40.350 --> 08:47.196
that with this happening one can
achieve en mass Realization.

08:47.397 --> 08:54.360
But till that time I had to understand
human beings,

08:54.561 --> 09:02.797
so by My subtle methods I tried
to understand what was their problem,

09:02.998 --> 09:06.813
what chakras they had in trouble,

09:07.014 --> 09:10.969
how I have to work out the permutations
and combinations

09:11.170 --> 09:16.019
in such a way that en mass Realization
can be achieved.

09:18.743 --> 09:25.322
So this en mass Realization I started
from that day.

09:25.523 --> 09:29.454
Before that I did not speak about it

09:29.655 --> 09:34.786
because what’s the use of another Bible
or another Gita?

09:34.987 --> 09:40.411
Better to achieve the results.

09:40.939 --> 09:46.503
Unless and until human beings realize

09:46.704 --> 09:52.729
that there are higher storeys of awareness
within them,

09:52.930 --> 10:00.292
whatever you may tell them they are
not going to understand You.

10:00.493 --> 10:03.104
So first it must be done.

10:03.305 --> 10:08.479
They have to realize that there are
higher awareness states

10:08.680 --> 10:15.021
which we have to achieve, which we have
achieved - and then they can go further.

10:16.874 --> 10:22.542
My Father Himself was a very great, -
evolved soul and He told Me

10:22.743 --> 10:27.301
that those who are born on the tenth storey
shouldn’t talk about it.

10:27.535 --> 10:30.308
They should come down

10:30.620 --> 10:34.058
and try to raise the people at least
to the first or second storey

10:34.259 --> 10:37.558
so they realize there are storeys beyond

10:37.759 --> 10:39.676
because if they just talk about
the tenth storey,

10:39.877 --> 10:47.214
people will think they are crazy or they’ll
crucify them. They’ll never understand.

10:48.634 --> 10:51.785
That won’t be practical.

10:53.908 --> 10:57.165
But it took some time to understand
human beings.

10:57.366 --> 11:04.214
They are very complicated people,
must say, not easy.

11:08.395 --> 11:11.501
Seeker: In your discourse You referred
to Kundalini as ‘She’.

11:11.702 --> 11:14.956
Is that because You are a woman?
Shri Mataji: What did she say?

11:15.157 --> 11:19.360
Sahaja Yogi: In your discourse You referred
to the Kundalini as ‘She’.

11:19.561 --> 11:23.768
Is that because You are a woman?
Shri Mataji: No, no no; She is.

11:23.969 --> 11:31.082
She is the female side, you see. She is
the Shakti, She is the female side.

11:32.861 --> 11:38.106
That’s why the quarrel about women and men
is all falsehood.

11:38.307 --> 11:42.645
There’s nothing like that; they exist
together.

11:42.846 --> 11:48.317
It’s like the moon and the moonlight;
is like the sun and the sunlight;

11:48.518 --> 11:52.488
is like the God and the Kundalini;

11:55.049 --> 11:58.793
is like the word and the meaning.

12:08.519 --> 12:13.176
Seeker: Is it fair to say that
the Kundalini energy arises

12:13.377 --> 12:16.981
and meets another energy coming from above?

12:17.182 --> 12:23.145
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is all-pervading
power, all right? Now.

12:23.346 --> 12:30.063
When the Kundalini rises, what she does,
she enlightens our subtler side

12:30.264 --> 12:33.508
of our nerves, our brain and everything
she enlightens,

12:33.709 --> 12:38.360
and by that we start feeling it.
Is the enlightenment that we get

12:38.561 --> 12:41.728
because of our connection with
the all-pervading power.

12:41.929 --> 12:47.954
It exists, already it exists, but you
cannot feel it normally.

12:48.155 --> 12:55.239
When she rises, then your nerves are
so enlightened that you can feel it.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.001
All right?

12:58.764 --> 13:03.032
You might be already getting it;
I am to think so.

13:05.219 --> 13:08.964
Seeker: Could you please say what are
the dangers of Kundalini meditation?

13:09.165 --> 13:11.885
Yogi: He’s asking about any dangers
of Kundalini meditation.

13:12.086 --> 13:16.211
Shri Mataji: No, no; no, no. Not at all,
not at all; She’s your mother.

13:16.412 --> 13:20.874
She’s your individual mother, who gives you
your second birth.

13:21.075 --> 13:25.864
She knows everything about you.
She has recorded everything

13:26.065 --> 13:27.794
and she does it very gently.

13:27.995 --> 13:34.320
See, when you were born, your mother
took all the pains upon herself, isn’t it?

13:34.521 --> 13:39.007
And in the same way, this Kundalini
does the job.

13:39.208 --> 13:42.382
But people are frightened because perhaps
maybe they don’t want -

13:42.583 --> 13:46.242
it’s an evil force I think, those who are
frightened against Kundalini

13:46.443 --> 13:48.270
because they don’t know how to do it

13:48.471 --> 13:55.009
or maybe they don’t want people to achieve
their realization. I can’t understand.

13:57.431 --> 14:03.267
Those people, as I was telling you today,
in the sixteenth century Guru Nanaka,

14:03.468 --> 14:08.088
then Kabira and all these others,
Ramadasa, Tukarama, all of them,

14:08.289 --> 14:14.519
nobody has said it’s dangerous.
On the contrary, Ramadasa was asked,

14:14.720 --> 14:17.347
“How much time does it take for Kundalini
to rise?”

14:17.548 --> 14:20.526
He used the word in Sanskrit, “Takshana,
that’s the moment,

14:20.727 --> 14:26.018
that moment,” he said. “Takshana,
that moment.”

14:26.219 --> 14:30.277
So, but he said, “There’s a condition.

14:30.478 --> 14:37.222
The one who wants should be anxious
to have it

14:37.423 --> 14:41.152
and the one who gives should be
an authority,

14:41.353 --> 14:45.275
not authority from some university
or anything,

14:45.476 --> 14:49.187
but authority in spirituality.”

14:50.063 --> 14:52.152
Yes?

14:55.078 --> 15:00.336
[Question concerning the position
a person must be

15:00.537 --> 15:08.125
in order to get Kundalini awakening.]

15:09.414 --> 15:15.812
Shri Mataji: What is it? [The question is
asked to Shri Mataji by an Indian yogi.]

15:16.047 --> 15:24.476
Shri Mataji: No, you see, it is all right.
You can do it, but why do all that?

15:24.677 --> 15:27.252
You have to be comfortably sitting
in your chair

15:27.453 --> 15:30.744
and you’ll get your Realization.
You don’t have to go to Himalayas

15:30.945 --> 15:35.226
to stand on your head. It’s just
simple way.
