Kundalini: Questions &amp; Answers

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.292
[Seeker says he has studied about Kundalini

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:33.725
and tells about his experimentations
and feelings.]

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:37.918
Shri Mataji: You see, if you, if you try
your own self, you see,

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:41.394
trying with the Kundalini, actually
sympathetic goes into activity.

00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:44.269
You have no right on the parasympathetic.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.810
Parasympathetic is the one which balances.
And that is the central path

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:50.602
of Sushumna, through which the Kundalini
has to rise.

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:55.155
But if you try anything, what you do is
always you can use sympathetic.

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:58.494
I’ll give you an example. Supposing
you are running fast, alright?

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:03.133
Then you can raise the rate of your heart.
But you cannot slow it down.

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.205
It slows down by itself, that is
parasympathetic activity.

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:08.598
So you just get into sympathetic activity,

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.606
and by sympathetic activity, if you
overdo it,

00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:15.878
then all these symptoms happen.
And it’s not helpful.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.300
On the contrary, chakras go into - quite

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.197
like, this is the left and the right
sympathetic

00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:24.230
and these are the centers. They get
pulled down like that.

00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:28.230
And if they are pulled like this, then
you are harmed.

00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:34.708
So it is, it is not an experience
of Kundalini but is of the sympathetic.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:51.090
[The seeker makes a comment on chakras
and then asks,

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:55.902
“But how Kundalini went down instead
of coming up?”]

00:01:56.103 --> 00:01:58.275
Shri Mataji: No, it doesn’t go down.
Kundalini never goes down,

00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:00.845
it goes upward, always.

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:04.540
The thing that comes down is the grace,
you see? The grace comes down,

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.939
not the Kundalini. Kundalini always
goes upwards.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.478
And the grace comes on your sympathetic,
which cools you down,

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.306
completely. You become absolutely
relaxed with the grace.

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:20.159
But the Kundalini itself always goes
upward, it never comes down.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.643
But in people it so happens

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:26.424
that Kundalini goes through
the central path.

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:31.907
Now if it is sort of very much ragged
or if it is this extremely smooth

00:02:32.108 --> 00:02:35.954
due to the mistakes of the seekers,
then it falls down.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:40.214
It falls down is a different point than
going like that. It falls down.

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:43.074
Then you have to raise it again and
tie it up, again raise it

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:48.480
and tie it up. In many people it has
to be done, but it can work out.

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:51.290
You’ll get the complete knowledge,
don’t you worry.

00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:55.298
Now he has been as he said 18 months,
but he is a master of Kundalini.

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.876
He can raise your Kundalini, and you are
just like him, you will become the same.

00:02:59.077 --> 00:03:02.626
There’s no, no problem at all.

00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:08.643
Seeker: I’d like to know if having
a vertebrae in the spine out of place

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.143
interferes with the rising
of the Kundalini?

00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:14.651
Sahaja Yogi: Does having a vertebrae
out of place in the spine

00:03:14.852 --> 00:03:16.948
interfere with the rising of Kundalini?

00:03:17.148 --> 00:03:19.437
Shri Mataji: It does to some extent,
it does.

00:03:19.638 --> 00:03:21.687
Definitely it does, but we can put it
right.

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:24.614
The vertebrae can be put right and
the Kundalini can be brought in.

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:29.881
It does. So many things do happen,
if you have – you are a person overread;

00:03:30.082 --> 00:03:32.444
if you have read too many books
and the books are in your head,

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.983
I have to empty that also.

00:03:38.684 --> 00:03:42.851
Sahaja Yogi: I actually do this work
as a profession and I find that

00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:48.273
if the subtle center is fixed, the spinal
problems just disappear.

00:03:48.474 --> 00:03:51.538
I used to have three and four adjustments
a week,

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.788
to correct my spine and now I have
none at all.

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.288
So first fix the subtle within us and then
the gross part,

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.073
the spinal misalignments and so on,
will just get better.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.780
Seeker: Excuse me, may I ask a question
please? Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.273
Seeker: What is the first step
to Self-realization?

00:04:13.474 --> 00:04:17.968
Sahaja Yogi: What is the first step
to Self-realization?

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.265
Shri Mataji: There is nothing like first,
second. It’s not a course, you see.

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:26.958
The Kundalini, it’s an awakening within us
which takes place,

00:04:27.127 --> 00:04:33.149
which is like a living process. All right?
So the Kundalini rises and shoots off here.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.515
Now, some people feel the Kundalini
wobbling down there, down below.

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:42.027
Some people feel it in the stomach.

00:04:42.228 --> 00:04:45.747
Some people feel it here; some people
feel it here;

00:04:45.948 --> 00:04:49.786
but most of them feel it here only,
jetting out like cool breeze.

00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:52.935
So you just can’t say what is
the first step,

00:04:53.136 --> 00:04:59.357
depends on how it rises. So, everybody
doesn’t feel the same way.

00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:04.565
So I can’t say that this is the first
stage. All right?

00:05:05.712 --> 00:05:08.972
Of course, first you feel thoughtlessly
aware.

00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:12.534
You become thoughtlessly aware, first
thing that should happen to you

00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:16.136
when the Kundalini crosses this center.
When it comes out of it,

00:05:16.337 --> 00:05:20.102
you start feeling the cool breeze here,
and you start feeling the cool breeze

00:05:20.302 --> 00:05:23.485
in your hands, and you start feeling
the cool breeze around.

00:05:23.686 --> 00:05:27.163
That’s the second stage where it can go.

00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:30.442
Shri Mataji: What else?
Seeker: Can anyone be realized

00:05:30.643 --> 00:05:34.325
without knowing about Kundalini?
Sahaja Yogi: Can anyone be realized

00:05:34.526 --> 00:05:37.775
without knowing about Kundalini?

00:05:37.976 --> 00:05:40.753
Shri Mataji: About mentally need not
know much,

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:43.097
it can be realized, of course you can be.

00:05:43.298 --> 00:05:47.893
But, then you have to tell them what it is,
this thing is better to do that way.

00:05:48.093 --> 00:05:51.155
But there will be very few who will accept
such a situation

00:05:51.356 --> 00:05:54.194
because they want to know about
everything.

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:56.819
But they need not know all that, you can
little bit say,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.365
tell them that there is a way of getting
realization and then it’s like this that

00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:05.858
when you come to Me, you want to have
the lights, I’ll say all right,

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:10.021
go there’s a switch you put on and you
put on the switch, you get the lights

00:06:10.222 --> 00:06:13.913
without telling about it. But you would
like to know how this light is done

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:17.717
and then that helps you to create
other lights.

00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:21.178
That’s why, it is important to know
about Kundalini.

00:06:21.378 --> 00:06:23.817
I would, I can do it without telling you
anything

00:06:23.994 --> 00:06:25.966
about Kundalini, I can raise your Kundalini

00:06:26.168 --> 00:06:29.334
but you would not know anything about it
and you would not know what it is.

00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:32.561
It has happened with many who were
born realized –

00:06:32.762 --> 00:06:35.491
they did not know they were realized souls
and they got lost.

00:06:35.692 --> 00:06:40.124
Like I would say, greatest example,
Leonardo da Vinci.

00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:44.374
Leonardo da Vinci was a realized soul
and he got lost because he didn’t know

00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:47.678
he was a realized soul, he was a higher
personality than others,

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:51.772
he got lost. So many got lost like that.

00:06:51.973 --> 00:06:54.834
Seeker: Excuse me, if your Kundalini
was arisen,

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:59.647
how can you be lost, I mean, you have it,
so how can you be lost?

00:06:59.848 --> 00:07:03.124
Sahaja Yogi: How can you be lost if
the Kundalini has been awakened?

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:07.199
Shri Mataji: No, it is, because, you see,
it is, you are not yet

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.303
fully developed matured person. When you
are in an immature state it does happen.

00:07:12.504 --> 00:07:15.137
Kundalini is, when it rises, you’ll be
surprised,

00:07:15.338 --> 00:07:18.178
in some people it is just a wee bit,
just like a hair,

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.730
just comes up a little bit because
it’s so difficult, you see,

00:07:20.932 --> 00:07:25.028
the passage is so blocked so a little bit
comes up. This is what it is.

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:29.489
It is, a complete realization takes place
only when you are in Nirvikalpa samadhi –

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.215
that’s a higher state. So in the beginning
it’s just a little wee bit opens up

00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:37.821
and one percent people do get lost,
they do, because they have egos,

00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:42.418
they have superegos, all kinds of things –
they do get lost – so be careful.

00:07:43.975 --> 00:07:48.866
Seeker: How and where did you receive
the power to awaken the Kundalini?

00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:53.209
Shri Mataji: Me?
Seeker: In the people.

00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:57.399
Shri Mataji: How and...? Sahaja yogi: How
and where did you receive the ability

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.016
to awaken the Kundalini in them?

00:08:02.224 --> 00:08:06.421
Shri Mataji: I had it born with it.

00:08:10.753 --> 00:08:13.999
One can be born with it.

00:08:17.076 --> 00:08:23.041
But I realized that to give en masse
realization,

00:08:23.242 --> 00:08:27.221
seventh center has to be open,
first of all.

00:08:27.422 --> 00:08:38.953
That I did on the fifth of May 1970
and then I realized

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:47.196
that with this happening one can
achieve en mass Realization.

00:08:47.397 --> 00:08:54.360
But till that time I had to understand
human beings,

00:08:54.561 --> 00:09:02.797
so by My subtle methods I tried
to understand what was their problem,

00:09:02.998 --> 00:09:06.813
what chakras they had in trouble,

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:10.969
how I have to work out the permutations
and combinations

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:16.019
in such a way that en mass Realization
can be achieved.

00:09:18.743 --> 00:09:25.322
So this en mass Realization I started
from that day.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:29.454
Before that I did not speak about it

00:09:29.655 --> 00:09:34.786
because what’s the use of another Bible
or another Gita?

00:09:34.987 --> 00:09:40.411
Better to achieve the results.

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:46.503
Unless and until human beings realize

00:09:46.704 --> 00:09:52.729
that there are higher storeys of awareness
within them,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:10:00.292
whatever you may tell them they are
not going to understand You.

00:10:00.493 --> 00:10:03.104
So first it must be done.

00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:08.479
They have to realize that there are
higher awareness states

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:15.021
which we have to achieve, which we have
achieved - and then they can go further.

00:10:16.874 --> 00:10:22.542
My Father Himself was a very great, -
evolved soul and He told Me

00:10:22.743 --> 00:10:27.301
that those who are born on the tenth storey
shouldn’t talk about it.

00:10:27.535 --> 00:10:30.308
They should come down

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.058
and try to raise the people at least
to the first or second storey

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:37.558
so they realize there are storeys beyond

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:39.676
because if they just talk about
the tenth storey,

00:10:39.877 --> 00:10:47.214
people will think they are crazy or they’ll
crucify them. They’ll never understand.

00:10:48.634 --> 00:10:51.785
That won’t be practical.

00:10:53.908 --> 00:10:57.165
But it took some time to understand
human beings.

00:10:57.366 --> 00:11:04.214
They are very complicated people,
must say, not easy.

00:11:08.395 --> 00:11:11.501
Seeker: In your discourse You referred
to Kundalini as ‘She’.

00:11:11.702 --> 00:11:14.956
Is that because You are a woman?
Shri Mataji: What did she say?

00:11:15.157 --> 00:11:19.360
Sahaja Yogi: In your discourse You referred
to the Kundalini as ‘She’.

00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:23.768
Is that because You are a woman?
Shri Mataji: No, no no; She is.

00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:31.082
She is the female side, you see. She is
the Shakti, She is the female side.

00:11:32.861 --> 00:11:38.106
That’s why the quarrel about women and men
is all falsehood.

00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:42.645
There’s nothing like that; they exist
together.

00:11:42.846 --> 00:11:48.317
It’s like the moon and the moonlight;
is like the sun and the sunlight;

00:11:48.518 --> 00:11:52.488
is like the God and the Kundalini;

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:58.793
is like the word and the meaning.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:13.176
Seeker: Is it fair to say that
the Kundalini energy arises

00:12:13.377 --> 00:12:16.981
and meets another energy coming from above?

00:12:17.182 --> 00:12:23.145
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is all-pervading
power, all right? Now.

00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:30.063
When the Kundalini rises, what she does,
she enlightens our subtler side

00:12:30.264 --> 00:12:33.508
of our nerves, our brain and everything
she enlightens,

00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:38.360
and by that we start feeling it.
Is the enlightenment that we get

00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:41.728
because of our connection with
the all-pervading power.

00:12:41.929 --> 00:12:47.954
It exists, already it exists, but you
cannot feel it normally.

00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:55.239
When she rises, then your nerves are
so enlightened that you can feel it.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.001
All right?

00:12:58.764 --> 00:13:03.032
You might be already getting it;
I am to think so.

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:08.964
Seeker: Could you please say what are
the dangers of Kundalini meditation?

00:13:09.165 --> 00:13:11.885
Yogi: He’s asking about any dangers
of Kundalini meditation.

00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:16.211
Shri Mataji: No, no; no, no. Not at all,
not at all; She’s your mother.

00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:20.874
She’s your individual mother, who gives you
your second birth.

00:13:21.075 --> 00:13:25.864
She knows everything about you.
She has recorded everything

00:13:26.065 --> 00:13:27.794
and she does it very gently.

00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:34.320
See, when you were born, your mother
took all the pains upon herself, isn’t it?

00:13:34.521 --> 00:13:39.007
And in the same way, this Kundalini
does the job.

00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:42.382
But people are frightened because perhaps
maybe they don’t want -

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:46.242
it’s an evil force I think, those who are
frightened against Kundalini

00:13:46.443 --> 00:13:48.270
because they don’t know how to do it

00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:55.009
or maybe they don’t want people to achieve
their realization. I can’t understand.

00:13:57.431 --> 00:14:03.267
Those people, as I was telling you today,
in the sixteenth century Guru Nanaka,

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:08.088
then Kabira and all these others,
Ramadasa, Tukarama, all of them,

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:14.519
nobody has said it’s dangerous.
On the contrary, Ramadasa was asked,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.347
“How much time does it take for Kundalini
to rise?”

00:14:17.548 --> 00:14:20.526
He used the word in Sanskrit, “Takshana,
that’s the moment,

00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:26.018
that moment,” he said. “Takshana,
that moment.”

00:14:26.219 --> 00:14:30.277
So, but he said, “There’s a condition.

00:14:30.478 --> 00:14:37.222
The one who wants should be anxious
to have it

00:14:37.423 --> 00:14:41.152
and the one who gives should be
an authority,

00:14:41.353 --> 00:14:45.275
not authority from some university
or anything,

00:14:45.476 --> 00:14:49.187
but authority in spirituality.”

00:14:50.063 --> 00:14:52.152
Yes?

00:14:55.078 --> 00:15:00.336
[Question concerning the position
a person must be

00:15:00.537 --> 00:15:08.125
in order to get Kundalini awakening.]

00:15:09.414 --> 00:15:15.812
Shri Mataji: What is it? [The question is
asked to Shri Mataji by an Indian yogi.]

00:15:16.047 --> 00:15:24.476
Shri Mataji: No, you see, it is all right.
You can do it, but why do all that?

00:15:24.677 --> 00:15:27.252
You have to be comfortably sitting
in your chair

00:15:27.453 --> 00:15:30.744
and you’ll get your Realization.
You don’t have to go to Himalayas

00:15:30.945 --> 00:15:35.226
to stand on your head. It’s just
simple way.
