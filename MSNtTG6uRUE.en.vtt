WEBVTT

03:25.228 --> 03:28.523
I hope you all are meditating every morning

03:28.724 --> 03:31.736
and talking Sahaja Yoga, meeting each
other,

03:31.937 --> 03:39.159
and this is more to get together that we
should all discuss about Sahaja Yoga

03:39.360 --> 03:43.750
and find out what is the way we can do it
better.

03:43.951 --> 03:50.125
Morning time I was thinking that we can
allot it now to people

03:50.326 --> 03:52.826
who would like to have a sort of a,

03:53.027 --> 03:57.518
they call it a brain trust sort of a thing,
a conference. You could have it.

03:57.719 --> 04:02.040
Of course, day after tomorrow we are all
very free. I’m sorry,

04:02.241 --> 04:05.965
tomorrow is the Puja but day after tomorrow
we are free in the morning time

04:06.166 --> 04:10.838
and also ninth we are free. So you all
could discuss and talk about things

04:11.039 --> 04:16.843
and about what has happened in Satara
district

04:17.044 --> 04:23.678
and all those things can be discussed among
all of you and it can be established

04:23.879 --> 04:29.363
that we understand Sahaja Yoga properly
among ourselves.

04:30.931 --> 04:34.092
Many people do not know much about
Sahaja Yoga, especially ladies.

04:34.293 --> 04:36.613
I think they have to know quite a lot.

04:36.814 --> 04:40.040
They just think they are in Sahaja Yoga;
so they are floating

04:40.241 --> 04:48.200
with the big flow of water. That’s not
the way to know about Sahaja Yoga.

04:48.401 --> 04:51.869
Sahaja Yoga you must know precisely, must
know what is,

04:52.070 --> 04:55.860
what is there, what is not there. So I
would say that you could have a meeting

04:56.061 --> 05:00.296
tomorrow sometime or, I’m sorry, day after
tomorrow, sometime

05:00.497 --> 05:04.734
and could discuss about what is it and how
it helps you,

05:04.935 --> 05:09.822
what are the chakras are, any problems,
anything. We have all kinds of people here.

05:10.023 --> 05:12.869
So it should not be just entertainment
but it should be

05:13.070 --> 05:18.392
more sort of a morning session for learning
things.

05:21.741 --> 05:25.608
We have, now tomorrow is a very important
day for Puja.

05:25.809 --> 05:29.417
All of you are expected to come here for
the Puja

05:29.618 --> 05:38.700
and I’m sure that it will help you all
to achieve something in that Puja.

05:38.914 --> 05:41.855
As it is, you know that you have to go
beyond your thoughts

05:42.056 --> 05:47.520
to absorb the vibrations. In your thoughts
you get lost.

05:47.721 --> 05:51.497
but once you are above the thoughts you
get absorbed.

05:51.698 --> 05:56.753
Also most of the marriages have been fixed.
But some people unnecessarily

05:56.954 --> 06:04.777
giving way to their conditionings or maybe
unnecessary thinking and all that

06:04.978 --> 06:09.635
have tried to say “No” to certain people
without any rhyme and reason,

06:09.836 --> 06:13.086
without any rhyme and reason. So it is
nonsense.

06:14.596 --> 06:17.649
And such people, I would say, that should
not apply anymore

06:17.826 --> 06:21.222
because we have wasted so much time. Of
course, if they had some rhyme and reason

06:21.423 --> 06:24.147
one can understand but without rhyme and
reason if you say,

06:24.348 --> 06:28.560
“We don’t want to marry,” that mean it’s
quite insulting to the other party.

06:28.761 --> 06:33.723
So if you have just said “No” because you
feel it from your heart

06:33.924 --> 06:38.436
and from your brain and from your these
things, this is not the way to behave.

06:38.637 --> 06:42.961
And before saying “No” you should see Me
and I would request you, all of you,

06:43.162 --> 06:48.792
to meet your fiancés and see for yourself.
Even now there is time.

06:48.993 --> 06:53.147
But if there is no reason for saying “No”,

06:53.363 --> 07:00.504
if there is no understanding about any
point,

07:01.310 --> 07:06.199
it is better to decide it now than to decide
it later. Now I’ve been telling you.

07:06.410 --> 07:08.503
Of course, you have all the freedom
to do it.

07:08.704 --> 07:13.401
But for no rhyme and reason you have no
business to insult other people.

07:13.602 --> 07:18.648
So I would request you that even if you
have any objections, even now,

07:18.849 --> 07:21.568
please write it down and give it to Yogi
Mahajan.

07:21.769 --> 07:26.235
He has really worked very hard and you know
we have no choices.

07:26.411 --> 07:29.979
You see, it is very funny how so many
marriages have come up. I didn’t expect

07:30.180 --> 07:34.356
even to fix ten marriages,  because the age
and the heights

07:34.557 --> 07:39.711
and everything was so much from one
extreme to another extreme.

07:40.973 --> 07:45.533
Moreover, those ladies who have got
children and all that, it’s rather difficult

07:45.724 --> 07:50.517
because we find people who are not very
happy about the situation.

07:50.718 --> 07:54.773
So they should not feel bad about it.
We hope to see people

07:54.974 --> 07:59.092
who would love to have children. All such
people should come forward

07:59.293 --> 08:03.375
and they should marry women who have
children and look after them.

08:03.576 --> 08:08.580
But it’s difficult. In the same way for men
also, if they have

08:08.781 --> 08:12.568
some children or something, there is
a problem.

08:12.769 --> 08:16.385
But one should not feel bad about it.
One should know that we are here

08:16.586 --> 08:20.864
for our Sahaja Yoga, for our ascent, and we
have to rise higher.

08:21.957 --> 08:25.975
As it is, you know, one or two marriages
do fail in Sahaja Yoga

08:26.176 --> 08:30.644
and they create lot of problems for Me. But
is this the way are you helping Me?

08:30.845 --> 08:34.944
I am helping you in so many ways. Which
is the way are you going to help Me

08:35.145 --> 08:40.738
is to understand that if we are married
let us try to improve ourselves.

08:40.939 --> 08:45.698
Of course, I would say that certain
problems come only from one side,

08:45.899 --> 08:48.900
not from both the sides, but whatever it is

08:49.101 --> 08:52.716
we have to understand that these marriages
are not just for marriages

08:52.917 --> 08:58.131
but for something great, to create a new
progeny of realized souls,

08:58.332 --> 09:04.019
to emancipate human beings. There are many
saints who want to be born on this earth.

09:04.220 --> 09:12.118
So it is important that if you are married
in that understanding

09:12.319 --> 09:17.369
then you will try to see to the good points
of others and not the bad points,

09:17.570 --> 09:20.284
and should not see superficial things.

09:20.874 --> 09:23.547
If you are superficial it is better you
don’t marry.

09:23.717 --> 09:28.768
But if you have any depth then you should
understand you are marrying for something

09:28.969 --> 09:34.067
that is the concern of God’s work.

09:34.268 --> 09:38.607
I hope by this you’ll be able to sort out
many of your problems.

09:38.808 --> 09:42.196
And then some people when they get married
they just get headlong,

09:42.397 --> 09:48.603
absolutely get lost into it. This is the
another stupid conditioning of romanticism.

09:48.804 --> 09:52.654
You have married because you are in Sahaja
Yoga, you want to help the Sahaj Yoga,

09:52.855 --> 09:56.961
you would like to have a companion who
will be helpful in Sahaja Yoga.

09:57.961 --> 10:02.940
But they get so headlong into it that I’ve
seen many characters have been ruined

10:03.141 --> 10:08.033
and people have been spoilt. But in a way
it’s good because this is Last Judgment.

10:08.210 --> 10:13.499
If by marriage, by temptations, by wrong
doings, by conditionings,

10:13.700 --> 10:16.504
if you have to go out, you have to go out.

10:16.644 --> 10:22.865
I must tell you that also there’s very
little place in the kingdom of God.

10:23.066 --> 10:27.221
Unless and until you prove to be good
Sahaja Yogis there is no place for you.

10:27.422 --> 10:31.972
For mediocres there is no place. You have
to be serious, deep,

10:32.173 --> 10:37.339
seeking, dedicated Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise
you have no place.

10:37.540 --> 10:41.045
If you are playing around only with your
children, with your wife,

10:41.246 --> 10:44.999
then all right; go ahead with it. You have
to get out of that

10:45.200 --> 10:49.793
and you must know that my first and
foremost attention should be on Sahaja Yoga.

10:49.994 --> 10:51.929
That is so very important today.

10:52.130 --> 10:58.393
Formerly, that’s why people used to give
sanyasa to their disciples.

10:58.863 --> 11:03.521
No marriage, no children, no household.
Just be sanyasis.

11:03.732 --> 11:08.603
So complete dedication to the guru,
complete dedication to the work.

11:08.804 --> 11:12.945
But in Sahaja Yoga it is not so. Because
also I have given you realization

11:13.146 --> 11:16.646
so you can feel it within yourselves what
is important.

11:16.847 --> 11:21.534
If something goes wrong with you then
the vibrations also go down.

11:21.735 --> 11:27.707
Then also I have reports, say, from many
countries that people are very miserly.

11:27.908 --> 11:32.340
They do not donate for daily work.
Of course, you don’t have to pay Me

11:32.541 --> 11:35.606
but you must know that without donation
we cannot do anything,

11:35.807 --> 11:40.384
you cannot even buy a little thing like
that, and from where it has to come?

11:40.585 --> 11:44.323
Of course, as far as possible I’ve tried
to compensate

11:44.524 --> 11:47.524
but also you must know my husband is now
retiring.

11:48.154 --> 11:53.007
So I hope the whole, with his retirement,
the whole of Sahaja Yoga will not collapse.

11:53.208 --> 11:57.433
If you are such miserly people, only
worried about your money,

11:57.634 --> 12:03.183
you want to extract each and every pie you
spend, each and every

12:03.860 --> 12:09.835
little money you have given, then I must say
such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

12:10.036 --> 12:12.704
Such calculating people, nobody wants
to shell out.

12:12.896 --> 12:18.753
I mean, I’ve seen people, even if they give
a little bottle of, say, Limca to someone,

12:18.954 --> 12:22.590
they want to charge it. If you are that
miserly

12:22.791 --> 12:27.444
there is no place for miserly people
in the kingdom of God.

12:27.645 --> 12:32.406
You have to be generous, you have to look
after people, you have to love each other,

12:32.607 --> 12:37.815
you have to give presents to others and you
have to be very much giving.

12:38.016 --> 12:43.798
And in this I find that people will live in
a good house, they’ll have a good family,

12:43.999 --> 12:48.565
they will spend on their children, for
their holidays, for their education,

12:48.766 --> 12:51.882
for everything. But Sahaja Yoga, they
become very miserly.

12:52.971 --> 12:56.279
So they are still so conditioned. So this
is the Last Judgment.

12:56.480 --> 13:00.639
And you will be judged for everything
that you do for Sahaja Yoga.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.502
Is one has to be very careful as to how
you behave,

13:04.703 --> 13:08.508
what is your attitude is and how you should
change.

13:08.709 --> 13:12.555
Your attention is also very important,
if your attention is not there.

13:12.756 --> 13:17.354
I’ve seen some people still sitting
outside, talking to people, doing this.

13:17.555 --> 13:20.403
In between the program they just get up
and walk off.

13:20.604 --> 13:26.610
When there’s an, some, some artist is
sitting you are not to go like that.

13:27.100 --> 13:31.717
It’s an insult to the artist. I, I just sit
for hours together.

13:31.906 --> 13:36.115
And if I am supposed to be your Guru, you
must learn at least that much from Me,

13:36.316 --> 13:40.641
how to respect and where to respect. So
I have seen many people just getting up,

13:40.842 --> 13:44.874
walking, sleeping down, this, that. If you
are that kind

13:45.075 --> 13:47.886
then you should sit on the corner and just
disappear.

13:47.976 --> 13:51.590
Nobody should walk this way back and this
way. It’s not proper.

13:51.801 --> 13:56.752
There should be, if you go to your church,
do you do like that?

13:56.982 --> 14:03.807
Church which is based on falsehood?
While this is the church of truth.

14:04.008 --> 14:09.116
And the way people take things without
any discipline looks very funny.

14:09.317 --> 14:12.563
People start walking up and down, sitting
the way they like.

14:12.771 --> 14:16.063
There’s no alertness about them.
This is all…

14:16.264 --> 14:21.052
You must know when the music is on,
I am trying to spread

14:21.253 --> 14:25.230
vibrations through that music. But some
people are dozing off.

14:25.431 --> 14:30.233
Some people are walking about. That is not
a Sahaja Yogi.

14:30.434 --> 14:33.876
You have to be just Spartan and smart.

14:34.077 --> 14:38.278
Like any, if you see a saint, you see,
if you see old saints we had,

14:38.479 --> 14:42.348
their disciples used to be sitting straight
before him for hours together.

14:42.517 --> 14:45.534
Of course, I don’t say that you should sit
here hours together

14:45.735 --> 14:50.150
but if I am sitting here you have no
business to behave like this dog

14:50.351 --> 14:54.292
that runs about without knowing what
he’s doing.

14:57.291 --> 15:01.334
We are all human beings and there’s no,
no reasoning behind it.

15:01.535 --> 15:04.508
I don’t understand - And there’s no
explanation needed.

15:04.709 --> 15:06.689
It’s the behavior itself is wrong.

15:06.890 --> 15:11.003
Now anybody who has children and all that
should sit on the other side.

15:11.204 --> 15:14.130
I would not like you to carry your children
here and there

15:14.177 --> 15:16.478
when there is some program is going on.

15:16.478 --> 15:19.501
We have to show at least this much
of discipline.

15:19.702 --> 15:24.043
So yesterday’s program was a little bit
a farce, perhaps maybe because

15:24.244 --> 15:28.812
some people really behaved in a manner
that they should not have behaved.

15:29.013 --> 15:32.834
All such people who want to go like that
should wait

15:33.035 --> 15:37.761
because in between the program we’ll give
you some interval when you can go out.

15:37.962 --> 15:43.774
So let us have a society, a proper

15:45.261 --> 15:54.015
beautifully built-up collectivity which
shows that we are very saintly people.

15:54.216 --> 15:57.981
We have poise, we have adjustments, we have
understanding,

15:58.182 --> 16:03.063
we are doing everything in such a manner
that it is all dignified.

16:03.264 --> 16:08.648
Now also some people have a bad habit
of raising their Kundalini

16:08.849 --> 16:11.059
in the program, suddenly giving bandhans,

16:11.260 --> 16:14.955
giving bandhans to themselves, bandhans
to others. Is nonsense.

16:15.455 --> 16:19.081
Just now I am there. You don’t have to.
Just you desire.

16:19.282 --> 16:23.009
You just try to develop your desire power
and just desire.

16:23.210 --> 16:26.699
You desire something; it will work out.

16:27.455 --> 16:32.021
I mean, I work like that and you should
learn this trick, how to desire.

16:32.222 --> 16:36.827
But desire should be pure desire. Then
Kundalini works it out.

16:37.028 --> 16:41.531
I was in Kolhapur and I was telling him,
our Yogi Mahajan,

16:41.732 --> 16:46.867
I want to buy those chimtas for the,
for the,

16:49.846 --> 16:54.159
we should say all the countries, western
countries and also the leaders.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.419
And just imagine, they said that you can’t
get them in Kolhapur.

16:57.620 --> 17:00.475
And there they are; they have bought it
and brought it.

17:00.676 --> 17:03.814
I mean, it’s a small incident but there are
thousand one things I can tell you.

17:04.015 --> 17:08.640
I have to just desire. I desired that
the Eastern bloc

17:08.841 --> 17:11.815
must be cleared out, must be freed.

17:12.016 --> 17:19.080
So a program of Sahaja Yoga, of what you
call the Yoga seminar, was held in Russia.

17:19.281 --> 17:22.794
And I told My husband and I told everyone,
“I’m going there

17:22.995 --> 17:26.491
to break the Eastern bloc.” I just told.

17:26.752 --> 17:29.862
When I went there they gave Me hardly
any time.

17:30.162 --> 17:32.684
But I broke it because the people who got
realization,

17:32.885 --> 17:37.471
they were from all these countries and they
just went and triggered it.

17:37.672 --> 17:40.088
So I had told beforehand that this is
My purpose

17:40.289 --> 17:45.032
but I am so intensely desiring anything;

17:45.233 --> 17:48.458
in the same way if you have a pure desire
about it,

17:48.659 --> 17:57.393
not from any, any malicious or some sort
of a selfish attitude.

17:57.594 --> 18:02.579
Like my brother, my sister, my... this is
Indians have this greater problem…

18:02.780 --> 18:06.610
my wife, this, that. The wife will support
the husband,

18:06.811 --> 18:09.351
the husband will support the wife,
nonsensical things will go on.

18:09.552 --> 18:14.014
But by this they are really taking them
down.

18:15.430 --> 18:19.343
And you people also should not sort
of have, because somebody

18:19.544 --> 18:23.690
is from, say, Switzerland, Swiss people
will sit together.

18:23.891 --> 18:27.710
It’s a very wrong thing to do. I’ve told
hundred times, nobody from the same….

18:27.911 --> 18:31.979
Now I can see it’s even that the same thing
happening here.

18:32.339 --> 18:35.492
English must sit together. And English have
the worst habit in this,

18:35.693 --> 18:39.820
that they must form a group. That’s their
style, is to have their group.

18:40.021 --> 18:44.767
So this is all is our conditioning. You see,
why I am telling you

18:44.988 --> 18:49.973
that Sahaja Yoga is not going to benefit
by you but you have to be benefited.

18:50.193 --> 18:53.563
So all these little, little conditionings
that you have, you just judge yourself:

18:53.974 --> 18:57.783
“Are we doing like that?”; “Are we
sitting?”; “Am I sitting next to a Swiss?”;

18:57.984 --> 19:01.213
“Am I sitting next to an English?”.
Run away.

19:02.620 --> 19:05.887
And then maybe that you think you can speak
in the same language

19:06.088 --> 19:08.626
or whatever it is. No. Let us sit away.

19:08.827 --> 19:11.928
Then Delhi people will sit together, Bombay
people will sit together

19:12.104 --> 19:15.413
and you ask them, “Do you know this lady?”
“No, who was she?”

19:15.614 --> 19:18.036
“I mean, she was there.” “No, I never
met her.”

19:18.237 --> 19:23.436
Because nobody wants to meet, nobody wants
to talk, nobody wants to know.

19:24.343 --> 19:27.346
And it is to be understood that this is
a place of pilgrimage,

19:27.547 --> 19:31.214
there’s no fashion show on.  And one should
not go about putting

19:31.405 --> 19:36.086
fashionable clothes and fashionable dresses
and... Be humble about it.

19:36.226 --> 19:39.903
This is sometimes I’m really shocked
the way people are dressing up.

19:40.104 --> 19:42.650
It’s all right, for Pujas and all that,
you can come.

19:42.851 --> 19:45.815
But the way people are dressed up sometimes
it’s surprising.

19:46.016 --> 19:49.526
You are coming here, for what? For your
meditation.

19:49.727 --> 19:55.035
So be in a simpler dress, in a simpler
attitude, in a simpler mind.

19:55.236 --> 19:58.497
Today I have to tell you because I’ve been
noticing few things

19:58.698 --> 20:04.316
that you are missing the point. We are
here for our ascent.

20:04.626 --> 20:10.426
We have come all the way. Pilgrimage is
there for your ascent and for nothing else.

20:10.627 --> 20:14.866
We are here only for our ascent, for our
joy,

20:15.067 --> 20:18.664
for opening out ourselves. And that is
what we have to remember.

20:18.865 --> 20:22.154
I’m your Mother. I have to tell you
the truth because it is your benevolence

20:22.355 --> 20:26.029
that I want, that you all should become
great foundations

20:26.230 --> 20:29.621
of Sahaja Yoga which is going to emancipate
the whole world.

20:29.822 --> 20:33.407
Moreover, anybody who is sick need not come
to Me.

20:33.797 --> 20:37.163
You can cure that person with it. You can
yourself cure.

20:37.364 --> 20:44.249
This person who is a realized soul can cure
himself or herself, or you can cure.

20:44.450 --> 20:48.070
What is the need to bring everybody to Me?
This is sick, that is sick,

20:48.271 --> 20:50.569
that is there. No need.

20:50.770 --> 20:54.034
Among yourselves only you can have these
things done,

20:54.194 --> 20:58.798
and I think the doctors and all these people
can also have a little conference together,

20:58.999 --> 21:03.110
and anybody who has problems can come and
tell them what’s the problem is.

21:03.311 --> 21:06.232
And can be done. There’s also no need also
to have doctors.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.924
We have some people here, very simple
people, who can help you a lot.

21:10.125 --> 21:13.542
So among yourselves you should help and you
should learn how to do it:

21:13.743 --> 21:16.925
how to raise the Kundalini; how to tie it
up; how to clear the chakras;

21:17.126 --> 21:20.717
what’s wrong with you. Attention should be
how I am going to achieve it.

21:20.918 --> 21:23.467
But the attention is not so high.

21:23.668 --> 21:28.556
So I would request you today that you
please pay full attention to the program

21:28.757 --> 21:35.708
and enjoy and really try to develop that
sensitivity of enjoyment.

21:35.948 --> 21:40.678
This is just you are clinging onto something
which is not going to take you

21:40.879 --> 21:45.425
to the Ocean of Joy. All right?
May God bless you.
