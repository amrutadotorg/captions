00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Akbar: … Very far, for the first time.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.259
And I knew when he phoned that they found it out.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:05.786
[Unclear]

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:10.705
Shri Mataji: You know because I asked her,
“What is the temperature? Just find out.

00:00:10.705 --> 00:00:12.872
Because I just really got shocked”.

00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:20.920
We saw all the people very nicely going about
without much on them.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.120
[Laughter]

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.840
Hello!

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.258
Lady: What would you like to drink?

00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:37.848
Shri Mataji: I mean, something cold: Coca Cola?

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:39.412
Lady: Coca Cola?

00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:47.616
Akbar: This is Yilmaz [unsure], Shri Mataji,
he’s an engineer, mechanical engineer,

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:50.644
Lady: This is cherry juice, OK?

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:53.672
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:54.160
Man:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.840
How are you?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:11.840
Shri Mataji: I’m so happy to&nbsp;
come here to meet you all.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.682
Man: Nice to meet you.

00:01:12.682 --> 00:01:14.289
Shri Mataji: I was so anxious to meet you.

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.896
Akbar: Another great Sahaja Yogi in Islam.

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:16.662
Shri Mataji: Really?

00:01:16.662 --> 00:01:18.958
Akbar: This is Nowal, another&nbsp;
engineer, mechanical engineer,

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.101
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.
God has given the engineers here,&nbsp;

00:01:21.102 --> 00:01:22.365
engineers, you see, God’s ways.

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:23.475
Man: No Economist. Economist.

00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:24.240
Shri Mataji: Great.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.389
Economic. Architect?

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:27.212
Man: Economist.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.298
Shri Mataji: Economist. Ah, economist.

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:30.341
Hello, how are you?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.932
Man: Fine thank you. And you?

00:01:31.932 --> 00:01:33.633
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.280
So, she’s here for us. Good.&nbsp;

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.320
Beautiful flowers.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.000
It’s all right, it’s all right.&nbsp;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.394
She doesn’t want to give&nbsp;
because maybe of the horns.

00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:45.097
[Cut in the video]

00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:46.400
Akbar: Mary is the wife of a doctor.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.760
She couldn’t come because she said-
the husband said that she had three patients,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.240
she has to cure their teeth, so she couldn’t come.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.915
Shri Mataji: [Laughter]

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:59.686
Akbar: Her husband. She couldn’t come.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.160
This is Serine,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.600
it’s the first time she sees you.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.948
Shri Mataji: First time.

00:02:04.948 --> 00:02:05.676
Serine: Can I kiss you?

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:07.840
Shri Mataji: Please.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.640
First time I see her.
So, this is too much for me.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.500
I am so happy we have so many people here.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.280
Akbar: This is the Iranian,&nbsp;
the first, the mother of Anik.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.720
She is the first people know.
She has started Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.590
She has got five students. She says.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.562
Shri Mataji: Oh, in Iran?

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.507
Akbar: Iran.

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:43.713
Shri Mataji: Iran is the first country I visited.
Did you tell her?

00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:44.975
Akbar: Yes, yes.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:46.000
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.440
So nice to see you all here, so nice.
It’s tremendous.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:08.538
I didn’t know this country&nbsp;
had some potential, really.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:39.413
Akbar: There are a lot more, they are outside.

00:03:39.413 --> 00:03:43.440
Lady:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.840
I am really glad to see you again.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:56.996
Shri Mataji: I come also for this task.
And his mother, isn’t she?

00:03:56.995 --> 00:04:00.492
Lady: And his mother.

00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:09.983
Shri Mataji: I talked to you&nbsp;
on the phone once, remember?

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:12.480
Sahaja Yogini:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.320
Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.027
Shri Mataji: She’s so anxious.

00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:17.040
Akbar: She is, yes.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.920
Sahaja Yogini: She’s from&nbsp;
Strasbourg, there, Mother.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.200
Shri Mataji: From where?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.853
Sahaja Yogini: From Strasbourg.

00:04:22.853 --> 00:04:25.680
Shri Mataji: Oh, Strasbourg.&nbsp;
You are from Strasbourg?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.840
Sahaja Yogi: She is the wife of a doctor&nbsp;
who is also a Sahaja Yogi, this lady.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.027
Shri Mataji: So nice to see, being such,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.027 --> 00:04:33.520
wonderful.
It’s very tied,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.320
thank you.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:42.840
Please be seated, all of you please be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.981
seated.
Yes, thank you.

00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:21.440
You are so close to, Turkey is so close to India.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.728
And you had Kamel Pasha here. Long time back.

00:05:21.728 --> 00:05:21.794
I always used to read his&nbsp;
life and his ideas and things.

00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:21.873
Sahaja Yogi: We are really blessed.
It’s the second time in Turkey.

00:05:21.873 --> 00:05:22.160
Perhaps you were more in Turkey only.
Is that the second time?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.840
Sahaja Yogi: Hello

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.800
Shri Mataji: Ah, hello!&nbsp;

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.080
What about Ruslan, he is not coming?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.598
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know, I don’t think so.

00:05:34.598 --> 00:05:38.240
Shri Mataji: I see. We should&nbsp;
have telephone to him really.&nbsp;

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.120
He’s so close here.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:51.840
He’s Oman, he’s in Oman.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.017
It’s a very traditional country, that is,
I have seen where ever there has been tradition,&nbsp;

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:02.960
they have been able to see this evolution process.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.080
But without a traditional country,&nbsp;
it is very difficult to handle.&nbsp;

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.200
You cannot understand.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.189
I don’t know, the Russian is not very good with
the relationship with Turkey, Russians.

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.887
Sahaja Yogini: Bad relations. They are just-

00:06:23.887 --> 00:06:28.240
Shri Mataji: But there was a problem&nbsp;
of people who were forces to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.840
or something.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.005
Sahaja Yogi: In Greece.

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:42.598
Shri Mataji: OK.

00:06:42.598 --> 00:06:46.640
But surprisingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.280
it’s very surprising, in Russia,
thousands went on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:01.840
and all very well-educated professionals, writers,
it’s so amazing.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.880
I think they had no other freedom.
So, they developed within themselves.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.080
People are so wonderful, very nice people.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.560
And this problem is also created&nbsp;
not by the government, anything,&nbsp;

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.920
but by some bureaucrats who do not&nbsp;
want to have this freedom business.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.680
That’s why they are doing all this,&nbsp;
not to give them food in this manner.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.600
But the people they say, “We don’t want any food.
We don’t want anything.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.800
What we want is this liberation of the Spirit”.
So well read, such nice people.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.120
And there would be 2,000&nbsp;
people sitting inside the hall&nbsp;

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.240
and 2,000 outside.
[Laughter]

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.560
When I came up they would say, “Mother, we”
they had to get some tickets to come to that hall.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.520
“There are no seats, we could&nbsp;
not come, we could not hear you”.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.240
I said, “All right, then what should we do?
Can you come tomorrow morning?”

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.240
“Yes, we’ll come”.
It was raining all of them were there next day,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.240
and we had a session just outside the hall.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.320
And even now follow on is like that, in thousands.
Nothing is less than thousand.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.800
But they settled down and it’s very remarkable
how they take to it so easily.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.200
And they have had all kinds of things, you know,
Hatha Yoga, this fellow, that fellow,&nbsp;

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.920
Yoganand, Karmananda, everything has been taken.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.920
But they understand the reality so well!

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:34.000
Sahaja Yogini: They haven’t been&nbsp;
spoiled by the Western culture.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.480
Shri Mataji: I just don’t know.
This is a kind of a very deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.320
understanding what should be the truth.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.960
It is a very deep understanding.
I mean no problem of any kind.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.080
The government has accepted,
the government has accepted us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.840
as an independent organization, only we!

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.680
Otherwise, any other yoga, anything&nbsp;
else, is in a combined way.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.760
But for us, they have given an independent way.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.280
And now, one of the Ministers is coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.613
for Ganapatipule.
[Laughter]

00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:13.546
He belongs to the Council of [unclear] the topmost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.546 --> 00:09:14.240
thing.
He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:21.840
is going to come.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.320
They have no conditioning,&nbsp;
I think, except for one.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.560
And they don’t- I mean they just say that,
“We just want liberation of the Spirit”.&nbsp;

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.240
No other conditionings.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.614
And they’re not materialist,&nbsp;

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:35.840
because they have never had all&nbsp;
these nonsensical things that we had.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.640
They have one problem, their [unclear],
they do not work out outside.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.000
That’s the only problem they have.
Otherwise, so generous.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.172
Even in the hotel, the people, the maids,
everybody is anxious to just touch my shawl.

00:10:02.172 --> 00:10:02.646
I’ve been thinking, “What idea&nbsp;
of spirituality they have?”&nbsp;

00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:11.840
When they had already no religion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.480
of any kind.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.600
Christianity also it’s just like that, hanging.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:29.360
Also, some Muslims are there in this area
of this Tashkent, Samarkar and these things.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.160
But I think there’s no&nbsp;
conditioning of any kind there.&nbsp;

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.480
Just they are waiting for the spirituality.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.120
And the right time now,&nbsp;
Gorbachev has opened the doors&nbsp;

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.480
and we were 40 people, first&nbsp;
time we went, 40 people.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.240
And the way they looked after us!
We didn’t pay a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.920
single pie, 40 of us, we did not pay.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.240
So full of devotion.
That means, you see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.360
that Sahaja Yoga will be now nicely established.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.160
Because according to one of the predictions of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.160
Bhrigumuni,
in his book Nadi Granth,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.800
he says that, “One super&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.920
power will take to Sahaja Yoga”.
This is one of the super powers.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.720
And then the Sahaja Yoga, in&nbsp;
1990, will be so established&nbsp;

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.560
that they will have to have a conference&nbsp;
of people from all over the world

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.680
and they will be made in&nbsp;
charge of the whole world.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:46.880
They have used ‘Sahaja’ word in that.
I’ve got a beautiful booklet.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.760
You’ve got the green booklet where is it?

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.520
Sahaja Yogini: In your luggage.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.440
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:55.543
Sahaja Yogini: In your luggage.

00:11:55.543 --> 00:11:58.160
Shri Mataji: OK. In which&nbsp;
somebody has also seen into Quran,&nbsp;

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.320
the word Sahaja Yoga is there.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.800
Sahaja Yogini: Oh, yes.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.062
Shri Mataji: G. S.

00:12:05.062 --> 00:12:05.533
Sahaja Yogini: Y. S .

00:12:05.533 --> 00:12:05.615
Shri Mataji: Y. S .

00:12:05.615 --> 00:12:09.290
Sahaja Yogini: Cause it’s written there.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.760
Shri Mataji: You see, Y suggests ‘yoga’.&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.440
So, he’s given me that&nbsp;
booklet. You have a look at it.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.840
Sahaja Yogi: My name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.351
is also Y.S.

00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:39.770
Shri Mataji: Y.S. Really?

00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:41.528
Sahaja Yogi: Ylman Salman.Y. S.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:42.948
Shri Mataji: Y. S. Ylmas?

00:12:42.947 --> 00:12:44.990
Sahaja Yogini: Ylman Salman. Salman.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.806
Shri Mataji: Means Salam, is it?

00:12:46.806 --> 00:12:47.998
Sahaja Yogini: Maybe.

00:12:47.998 --> 00:12:49.360
Shri Mataji: [Unclear].&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.160
You know, I was sure Muhamad sahib
would have written everything definitely,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.800
because he’s one of the latest&nbsp;
ones, he must have talked about it.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.840
Also, he said, “Until the Qiyamah comes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.400
you can go with the ?”.
Otherwise, there’s no need.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.120
All these things, he has said It.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.760
And it’s very important that Islamic world&nbsp;
should now take to something like that.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.960
Because the way things are&nbsp;
going on, even in Russia,&nbsp;

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.200
there’s a big fight going on, so many&nbsp;
people getting killed for nothing at all!

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.880
Afghanistan also, such a lot&nbsp;
of people are getting killed.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.560
We met the Minister of&nbsp;
Afghanistan who came to see us.&nbsp;

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.200
And he said, “We want peace in&nbsp;
Afghanistan. How to have peace?”

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.680
I said, “You spread Sahaja Yoga”.&nbsp;

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.320
We want peace, he said, “So&nbsp;
many people are killing:&nbsp;

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:57.537
there are rebels, there are this thing”.

00:13:57.537 --> 00:14:01.840
Afghanis, those whom I’ve met&nbsp;
are really wonderful people.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.840
They were not political or anything.
They didn’t have political problems, nothing.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.920
They were just talking about this and&nbsp;
then one of the lady had some problem.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.200
So, she came and she said, “I trust&nbsp;
you all the way. I came from Kabul”.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.440
She had some problem, I cured her.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.440
And I was surprised, I mean,&nbsp;
she was just talking about,&nbsp;

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.480
“This is what it is, we have we&nbsp;
have been watering and all that”.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.320
Afghanis people say like this.
There are people all over the world like that.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.480
There are people all over the world like that.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.320
And Afghanis, I mean, I can say that it’s&nbsp;
not easy to penetrate into that area.&nbsp;

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.880
It’s so far fetch.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.600
They met me in Russia.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.800
It’s all working out so well.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.880
Sahaja Yogi: Mother sorry. Mother,&nbsp;
sorry, I did not understand.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.947
Shri Mataji: No? I’m sorry,&nbsp;
I thought you understood.

00:15:07.947 --> 00:15:09.817
Sahaja Yogi: We’ll [unclear] after this.

00:15:09.817 --> 00:15:09.855
Shri Mataji: You’d better tell them.

00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:09.879
Sahaja Yogini: Tell him.

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:10.848
Shri Mataji: Ah! [Laughter]
I was talking that side.

00:15:10.848 --> 00:15:21.294
Sahaja Yogi: This is recorded, so&nbsp;
we can show it to them after this.

00:15:21.294 --> 00:15:31.586
Shri Mataji: All right. And then&nbsp;
you can translate, yes. Good idea.

00:15:31.586 --> 00:15:36.963
Sahaja Yogi: This is audio, so yes.

00:15:36.963 --> 00:15:38.960
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.840
I think Turkish is the language&nbsp;
I can learn the fastest,&nbsp;

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.280
because so much near Urdu.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.960
So much near Urdu.
Many words are Urdu words which we use in India.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.400
Sahaja Yogini: In Sanskrit, do you mean?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.170
Shri Mataji: I’ll pick it up in no time.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.600
Sahaja Yogini: Can I ask you something?&nbsp;

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:08.221
They told me that they saw my name&nbsp;
in Sanskrit. My name is Gaiye.

00:16:08.221 --> 00:16:08.539
What?

00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:09.873
Sahaja Yogini: Gaiye.

00:16:09.873 --> 00:16:11.207
Sahaja Yogini: Gaiye.

00:16:11.207 --> 00:16:12.351
Shri Mataji: Gaie.

00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:14.003
Sahaja Yogi: Gaiye. Gaiye.

00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:15.146
Shri Mataji: G-A-I

00:16:15.146 --> 00:16:16.353
Sahaja Yogini: Y-E.

00:16:16.353 --> 00:16:19.275
Shri Mataji: GAIYE. So, you want to know what?

00:16:19.275 --> 00:16:20.800
Sahaja Yogini: [Cut]…&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.120
Sanskrit. They saw it in&nbsp;
one of the Sanskrit songs.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.725
Sahaja Yogini: She would like&nbsp;
to know the meaning of “Gaiye”.

00:16:29.725 --> 00:16:32.330
Sahaja Yogi: ‘Muslim aliyo gaye’

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:40.289
Shri Mataji: Ah! ‘Gaye’ means ‘you sing the song’.
‘Ga’ comes for singing is for singing, ‘ga’.

00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:44.847
It’s for singing, ‘gaye’.&nbsp;
it’s an Urdu word ‘gaye’.

00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:48.320
If I say ‘gaye’ means ‘you please sing’.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.240
But it could be, there was a very well-known lady,&nbsp;

00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:00.000
and also we have within us one of the&nbsp;
channels called as Gayatri Channel.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.600
Gayatri, it’s a very subtle channel&nbsp;
to invoke the five elements.&nbsp;

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.080
That’s called as Gayatri.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:17.625
Sahaja Yogi: ‘Gaye’ means the aim or the scope.
Is there a word in [Urdu language]? [Cut]

00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:24.000
Shri Mataji: Ah, yes, Urdu. If you&nbsp;
say ‘gaye’, means ‘please sing’.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.840
But what do you say to the sea here? Sea?

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.480
Sahaja Yogini: Sea is the niece.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:28.876
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:17:28.876 --> 00:17:29.458
Sahaja Yogini: The niece.

00:17:29.457 --> 00:17:31.840
Shri Mataji: No, no. Something else you told me.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.016
Sahaja Yogini: Sea is the niece.

00:17:34.016 --> 00:17:36.160
Shri Mataji: ‘Samundan’ you said?&nbsp;

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.829
Something as some word, just like&nbsp;
a Sanskrit or Urdu word. Daria.

00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:40.503
Sahaja Yogini: Ah, that’s right.

00:17:40.503 --> 00:17:41.240
Sahaja Yogi: Daria, it’s the ocean ocean.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.840
Shri Mataji: Ocean. Daria is&nbsp;
ocean in Urdu also. Daria.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.600
I’ll pick it up in no time. I’m sure,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.880
Turkish language.
[Laughter]

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.600
Even, surprisingly, there are so&nbsp;
many words in Russian language.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.640
It’s very surprising that there’s&nbsp;
something what you call [unclear]&nbsp;

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.280
that only the Maharashtra&nbsp;
from where I come, Bombay,&nbsp;

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.680
they say and Russians say and Chinese ‘tse’.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.880
Nowhere in the world they use ‘tse’.
Mao Zedong is Mao Tsedong, ‘tse’.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.360
So, the Chinese were surprised&nbsp;
how I could say ‘tse’&nbsp;

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.640
because nobody can say ‘tse’.
[Laughter]

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:37.760
And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.040
this is something surprising that only in these&nbsp;
three countries only this word ‘tse’ is there.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.520
But Sanskrit is in Chinese&nbsp;
and in Russian, full of it,&nbsp;

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:55.840
completely Sanskrit. Though&nbsp;
little derivations are there.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.200
Because you see, Sanskrit and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.240
we can say Latin [cut]
of one mother language.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.440
Sanskrit means the one which was made holy.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.360
So, that’s how the one word- Sanskrit started
and then the Latin was for the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.840
who didn’t want to use very -
because Sanskrit is a difficult language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.080
So, they used Latin.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.600
Like this, two languages were good.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.600
But sometimes these derivations go so far,&nbsp;

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.840
that the meaning say, of something&nbsp;
is in one language you say a glass’.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.040
So, the meaning of the same word in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.101
another language could be ‘table’.
but the words are there.

00:19:48.101 --> 00:19:52.659
Sahaja Yogi: Are the same. We call&nbsp;
Latin language Indo-Aryan language.&nbsp;

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:56.568
We think it comes from Sanskrit language.

00:19:56.568 --> 00:20:00.000
Shri Mataji: Aryan, yes. Aryan, yes.&nbsp;

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.320
So the Aryans had two languages:
one was the Sanskrit and another one was Latin.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.880
But it is said that they don’t know how&nbsp;
to say, but they say that, in India,&nbsp;

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.280
they say that Indians Aryans&nbsp;
who went down to Norway,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.360
because we have a book where they describe&nbsp;
that this language was made Sanskrit&nbsp;

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.240
in a place where a constellation called&nbsp;
‘Ramni’ [unsure] is at right angles.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.148
That’s the place in Norway.
So, it was made Sanskrit in Norway by the Indians.

00:20:35.148 --> 00:20:38.629
The Viking people perhaps you mean?

00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:40.418
I beg your pardon?

00:20:40.418 --> 00:20:44.694
Viking, Viking people, in Norway, are they?

00:20:44.694 --> 00:20:47.280
Shri Mataji: Vikings? Yes.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:53.120
I don’t know if Vikings are&nbsp;
but we had we had our ships&nbsp;

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.200
like that built in India&nbsp;
long time back, same style.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.560
The bulbous bows and thing coming out.
Sometimes it used to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.520
like a peacock or something.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.480
It was like that in India long time back,
about thousand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:14.470
say, 8,000 years back or so, when&nbsp;
Shri Rama lived, at that time.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.800
So, there we have been always something,
there has been a rapport going on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.920
thousands of years back
of which we are not aware historically.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.840
But certain things you discover&nbsp;
and you are quite surprised.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:37.120
Like, I went to Colombia, now where is&nbsp;
Colombia, Bogota, if you have to go, you see,&nbsp;

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.120
the height is so much that you feel little&nbsp;
giddy when the plane takes you out there.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:51.200
And in Colombia, it was very&nbsp;
surprising that I asked them,&nbsp;

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:57.280
“Why the emblem of the Navy&nbsp;
is a condor? Is a Garuda?”

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.160
So, they said that, “You see,&nbsp;
our forefathers told us”,&nbsp;

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:06.000
it’s only in Colombia you find people, and&nbsp;
Peru, their original Aboriginal people.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:13.280
“They told us that there was a god&nbsp;
called Vishnu who came on a condor”.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.080
Both of us, myself and my husband, were surprised.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.240
And from where did he come?
He came from Bharat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.480
India’s first name was Bharat.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.720
And in the museum, the fellow told me the same.&nbsp;

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:39.840
So, there was some sort of a&nbsp;
big rapport once upon a time.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.840
In Finland&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.840
now, Finland&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.949
is so far away.

00:23:35.949 --> 00:23:36.321
And in Finland, I asked the lady, I said,&nbsp;

00:23:36.321 --> 00:23:36.847
“What do they call for sugar?”
She said, “Sokeria”.

00:23:36.847 --> 00:23:37.591
It’s Sanskrit, absolute Sanskrit word for sugar.
What do you call for sugar here?

00:23:37.591 --> 00:23:37.763
Sahaja Yogi: Sheker

00:23:37.763 --> 00:23:38.362
Shri Mataji: Sheker. From the same,&nbsp;
from the same, about the same.

00:23:38.362 --> 00:23:39.242
But in Maharashtra, it is called as ‘saka’
and also in Russian ‘saka’. Exactly ‘saka’.

00:23:39.242 --> 00:23:52.080
But the word must be the&nbsp;
original Adi Shankara from where,&nbsp;

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.536
all these words have come.

00:23:53.536 --> 00:23:55.440
[Unclear conversation about sugar]

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.160
So, the mixture of Arabic and Persian,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.840
Latin and Sanskrit.
All of them are combinations.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:08.775
Sahaja Yogini: I heard that Sanskrit&nbsp;
is the mother of other languages.&nbsp;

00:24:08.775 --> 00:24:09.833
I don’t know.

00:24:09.832 --> 00:24:15.120
Shri Mataji: Quite a lot, yes, quite&nbsp;
a lot, quite a lot, no doubt about it.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.720
Like in Arabic, you call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.641
it, ‘Kulka kili’ [unsure];
‘Kulka kili’ for the lock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:26.935
and key. ‘Kulka kili’ you say.
‘Kuluk kili’ you say in Arabic language.

00:24:26.936 --> 00:24:30.330
Sahaja Yogini: In Arabic language, I don’t know.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.878
Shri Mataji: They say “Kuluk&nbsp;
kili” and that is in Marathi also,&nbsp;

00:24:34.877 --> 00:24:38.000
we say “Kuluk” and “kili”. In Marathi.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:52.710
My father was a scholar of Arabic language
and he translated Quran into Hindi. [Unsure]

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.560
Sahaja&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:10.480
Yogini: My father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:17.249
is a well [unclear sentences].

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:24.320
Sahaja Yogini: The manager&nbsp;
would like to come and greet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:24.464
you,
is it possible for you?

00:25:24.464 --> 00:25:29.390
Shri Mataji: We have had a Diwali puja.
[Laughter]

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.800
Very nice, wonderful Diwali puja.&nbsp;

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.880
They put all the lights and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.587
had lots of these fireworks.
Such nice fireworks!

00:25:35.587 --> 00:25:44.074
Sahaja Yogini: She is Cirilla. Cirilla.

00:25:44.074 --> 00:25:44.122
Sahaja Yogini: He is the manager of the airport.

00:25:44.122 --> 00:25:44.145
Shri Mataji: Thank you.

00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:44.553
Man: Thank you very much.

00:25:44.553 --> 00:25:44.880
Sahaja Yogini:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.120
He’s very happy to meet you
and also he’s very happy to see you in Turkey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.920
again.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:21.120
And while we are waiting for you, we&nbsp;
just talk about Sahaja Yoga and yourself&nbsp;

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:35.072
and he’s too much interested about this&nbsp;
subject that he’s going to join our program.

00:26:35.072 --> 00:26:50.640
Shri Mataji: Really? Good, very good.
Very kind, thank you very much. Thank you.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:58.135
It’s such a nice uh atmosphere.
This kind of a freedom [unclear]&nbsp;

00:26:58.135 --> 00:27:04.026
this sense of freedom to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:04.026 --> 00:27:10.720
Very open people I’ve met, very open. Very open.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.920
But you don’t find this in&nbsp;
other countries so called free.&nbsp;

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.640
You don’t find.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.881
There so many other things in their heads,
I cannot understand why they are like mad people.

00:27:19.881 --> 00:27:23.760
Sahaja Yogini: I didn’t say anything&nbsp;
about yourself and Sahaja Yoga.&nbsp;

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.628
He asked me the questions all the time.
[Laughter]

00:27:26.628 --> 00:27:30.434
Shri Mataji: He must be a seeker, isn’t it?
He must be a seeker of truth.

00:27:30.434 --> 00:27:31.080
Sahaja Yogini: I don’t know.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.880
Shri Mataji: But this is, I don’t understand,&nbsp;

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.440
that certain countries are&nbsp;
so much full of seekers.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.760
Actually, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.240
as if they are seeking something.
You just go there and you find them.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:49.240
And some country you break your head, you break-
all your knowledge to them is zero.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.120
It’s something surprising.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.800
Sahaja Yogini: It must be because&nbsp;
they are still traditional.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.320
Shri Mataji: With their freedom.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.080
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.840
Shri Mataji: Conditioned by&nbsp;
their so-called too much freedom.&nbsp;

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.960
“What’s wrong?” You see, you tell&nbsp;
them, they say, “What’s wrong?”

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.440
It’s terrible.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.798
[28:10 BETTER SOUND]

00:28:10.798 --> 00:28:15.840
Shri Mataji: I’m sorry, I have to talk&nbsp;
this side and you are on this side.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.016
Sahaja Yogi: Any side is OK Shri Mataji.
[Laughter]

00:28:20.016 --> 00:28:23.920
Shri Mataji: The whole video&nbsp;
team wanted to come really.&nbsp;

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.840
I said, No, it’s all right now.&nbsp;
Don’t trouble them too much.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.880
How much time does it take from here to Bombay?

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.440
Sahaja Yogini: It must be 3 hours, 4 hours.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.000
Shri Mataji: 4 hours.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.105
Sahaja Yogini: Yes. [Unclear]

00:28:46.105 --> 00:28:48.800
Sahaja&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.800
Yogi: No, no. My wife went&nbsp;
to India Tour to New Delhi.&nbsp;

00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:03.120
And she left at 10:05 in the evening and&nbsp;
she was arriving at 7:35 in New Delhi.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.395
Shri Mataji: New Delhi, that’s&nbsp;
far away, Bombay is closer.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:13.600
Sahaja Yogini: A local time you mean or?

00:29:05.395 --> 00:29:08.377
Sahaja Yogi: Closer, yes.

00:29:08.377 --> 00:29:11.360
Shri Mataji: Bombay is much closer.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:13.673
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:29:13.673 --> 00:29:13.784
Sahaja Yogini: Local time.

00:29:13.784 --> 00:29:15.680
Shri Mataji: I think Bombay&nbsp;
would be nearer because&nbsp;

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.560
you take one and a half hour&nbsp;
to go to Deli from Bombay.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:26.320
Sahaja Yogini: And from Italy, here,&nbsp;
it’s for 3 hours or 2 hours and a half.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.185
Shri Mataji: It’s very close.

00:29:29.185 --> 00:29:32.000
Sahaja Yogini: From here to Bombay how much?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.120
Akbar: 8 hours.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:38.560
Sahaja Yogini: So, it’s about&nbsp;
6 hours. Five or six hours yes.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.960
Shri Mataji: But you don’t go&nbsp;
via- that’s what I was saying,&nbsp;

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.440
if they go to Istanbul, it would be easier.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.960
I was telling them, “You go via Istanbul “.
Because I don’t know how they go normally.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:59.160
Akbar: They go- I don’t know Shri Mataji.
Sometimes through Kuwait or through Egypt.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.720
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:07.520
That’s why. You see, if you go via the north side,
then to come to Bombay is much more.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:12.960
But if you go directly from Istanbul it’s -
because this is also in the South and Bombay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.960
also in the South,
so it’s quite close.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:21.920
I was looking at the map today&nbsp;
to find out an easier way.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.200
So, they are coming now and&nbsp;
Russians were saying that,&nbsp;

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.560
“All our, this thing is booked,&nbsp;
we don’t how we’ll go to there”.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.960
So, then I found out a way&nbsp;
to come here from Tabriz.&nbsp;

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.600
They have to go to Tabriz,&nbsp;
Ryad, Bombay, it’s straight.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.440
But otherwise, they would go to&nbsp;
Delhi from the north from Tashkent,&nbsp;

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.680
Delhi then to Bombay. It’s too much. Yes.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.840
Moscow is, this way, much easier.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.640
Sahaja Yogini:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.840
Mother, would you let me translate your&nbsp;
last word regarding Turkey to my friends?

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:00.640
Shri Mataji: All right, please.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:36.880
Shri Mataji: There&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.600
must be something about Turkey, I should say,
that there are so many seekers.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.480
There must be something, you must find out.&nbsp;

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.920
Maybe there have been some&nbsp;
great Saints living here.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.920
Do you think that’s the reasons?
There have been lots of saints living in Turkey.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.832
Kahlil Gibran was here in Turkey?
Kahlil Gibran, he’s from Lebanon. He was a saint.

00:32:00.832 --> 00:32:03.313
Or Sufi people?

00:32:03.313 --> 00:32:09.929
Sahaja Yogi: Sufi people, yes. [Unclear]

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.080
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.025
That’s it.

00:32:15.025 --> 00:32:20.160
Sahaja Yogi:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.809
There are many. Dervish.

00:32:20.809 --> 00:32:20.832
Shri Mataji: Dervish.

00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:20.907
Sahaja Yogini: And though they&nbsp;
[unclear] they are close to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:20.907 --> 00:32:20.925
Shri Mataji: Yes?

00:32:20.926 --> 00:32:20.946
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:32:20.946 --> 00:32:27.840
Shri Mataji: There is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:41.440
something.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:49.280
Sahaja Yogini: And then the Virgin Mary&nbsp;
was born in Ephesus which is Turkey.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.197
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:32:50.197 --> 00:32:54.080
Sahaja Yogini: The Virgin Mary was&nbsp;
born in Ephesus which is Turkey also.&nbsp;

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:54.759
It’s near here.

00:32:54.759 --> 00:33:00.107
Sahaja Yogi: Ephesus in West&nbsp;
Turkey. Her grave is also there.

00:33:00.107 --> 00:33:08.640
Sahaja Yogini: Garve?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.400
It’s not a grave because it’s a church.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.269
Shri Mataji: Really?

00:33:11.268 --> 00:33:16.159
Sahaja Yogini: They said there&nbsp;
is the house where she was born.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:23.840
Shri Mataji: Yes she was born, but at that&nbsp;
time it was not Turkey, some other name.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.085
Sahaja Yogini: No maybe yes, because the.

00:33:26.085 --> 00:33:27.805
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:30.400
Sahaja Yogi: I think she died there.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.120
Shri Mataji: She died in-&nbsp;
they say she died in Kashmir.&nbsp;

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.040
She died in Kashmir that’s what they say.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.560
So many people, I don’t know&nbsp;
why, at the end of their lives,&nbsp;

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.680
they say Moses was in Kashmir&nbsp;
and so many Jews came to Kashmir.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.760
Like, I don’t know why they came to Kashmir?
Maybe it’s a very peaceful place for retirement.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.720
And they died there.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.360
Many Romans came there after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:05.840
they lost their empire.
And they died in Kashmir.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.855
Sahaja Yogini: Because the mountains.

00:34:06.855 --> 00:34:09.200
Shri Mataji: Mountains, it’s a&nbsp;
very peaceful, beautiful place.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.840
So, it was nice meeting you all here.
May God bless you.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:33.840
I hope we get more people tomorrow and day after.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:17.920
[Shri Mataji goes out.]

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.840
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.880
The way Muslims are greeting is much better than-
from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:17.280
the heart. It’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:31.840
from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:36.560 --> 00:39:08.655
the heart, you know, they wish.

00:39:08.655 --> 00:39:12.880
Man:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.840
Yes.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.760
Shri&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:57.995
Mataji: Or they do it like this. [Unclear]

00:39:57.995 --> 00:40:37.200
Sahaja Yogini: And also we&nbsp;
greet people like this with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:37.840
heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:17.308
It’s a custom.

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:22.600
Shri Mataji: I know, I know. It’s very&nbsp;
good instead of shaking hands, you know.&nbsp;

00:41:22.599 --> 00:41:24.886
It’s terrible this shaking hands.

00:41:24.886 --> 00:41:29.067
Because in Asia, we put both&nbsp;
hands together, it’s much better.

00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:33.444
One hand shaking is very bad. Two&nbsp;
hands shaking is better, I think.

00:41:33.444 --> 00:41:34.685
Guido: It’s good.

00:41:34.685 --> 00:41:36.710
Sahaja Yogini: Balance shaking.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.082
Shri Mataji: Balance.

00:41:38.082 --> 00:41:42.394
Sahaja Yogi: We put it in the heart&nbsp;
and really it gives a meaning.

00:41:42.394 --> 00:41:44.681
Shri Mataji: Really from the heart.

00:41:44.681 --> 00:41:47.360
[Conversation with few Yogis downstairs.]
