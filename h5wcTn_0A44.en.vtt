00:03.030 --> 00:12.570
Today it's a different day altogether for all of you,

00:13.570 --> 00:22.370
because this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

00:23.847 --> 00:31.079
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,

00:31.680 --> 00:38.413
it's not only the left side that you know.

00:39.380 --> 00:46.079
You all know only the left side, from Shri Ganesha

00:47.647 --> 00:55.413
through the ascent of different, different chakras on the left side.

00:56.280 --> 01:02.179
I didn't want to tell you about the right side to begin with,

01:03.113 --> 01:11.113
because those who have gone through the right side got just lost.

01:14.213 --> 01:23.246
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings

01:25.113 --> 01:28.046
but they didn't know what it was about,

01:28.780 --> 01:35.179
they just used to learn it by heart.

01:36.346 --> 01:40.113
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

01:41.113 --> 01:47.113
and that is how they moved on the right side

01:48.346 --> 01:53.413
and, I don’t know, they landed up at the Agnya;

01:56.246 --> 02:00.613
and then they were trying for the Self-realization.

02:01.213 --> 02:07.113
They were promised that if you do this right side properly,

02:08.213 --> 02:14.280
you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realization.

02:15.413 --> 02:18.079
But none of them reached there.

02:18.613 --> 02:22.113
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

02:22.680 --> 02:29.113
terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

02:29.446 --> 02:37.280
All these things they learnt through their right-side movement.

02:39.313 --> 02:42.113
There was no kundalini awakening,

02:43.113 --> 02:51.113
and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya Chakra,

02:52.113 --> 02:59.213
and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

03:02.647 --> 03:10.813
All these books were written without understanding

03:11.346 --> 03:15.546
that it's not easy to go via right side,

03:17.346 --> 03:23.580
but best was to awaken your kundalini.

03:24.546 --> 03:30.079
The kundalini directly takes you up in the center of all the chakras,

03:30.647 --> 03:37.113
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya

03:37.580 --> 03:44.113
into the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

03:44.713 --> 03:51.213
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra, from where it pierces?

03:52.146 --> 03:54.346
I never told you about it.

03:55.113 --> 03:59.346
But now I think for most of you the time has come.

04:00.647 --> 04:06.213
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,

04:06.313 --> 04:11.613
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating always.

04:12.246 --> 04:19.179
It is pulsating because the spirit entered through that area,

04:20.446 --> 04:26.313
and when you close it, it settles in the heart.

04:28.213 --> 04:34.113
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented person,

04:34.513 --> 04:41.313
but how to enter into the Sahasrara was the problem.

04:42.780 --> 04:46.546
The tantrikas who were there, they went through the right, left side,

04:47.146 --> 04:57.380
and they developed all the practices of black – we should say, the left side.

04:59.179 --> 05:06.613
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, I should say,

05:06.713 --> 05:12.346
extremely ambitious, ferocious,

05:14.113 --> 05:22.513
and they started killing people on the basis of cursing.

05:23.146 --> 05:25.446
They are very good at cursing people;

05:26.546 --> 05:31.546
to be always forward, push back all the people,

05:32.179 --> 05:36.179
and override everybody's rights.

05:36.580 --> 05:43.246
They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

05:44.113 --> 05:50.346
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,

05:50.780 --> 05:53.213
they then took the right side.

05:54.113 --> 05:58.179
Because of the right side they became very powerful, no doubt.

05:59.113 --> 06:02.146
They got all the powers over the world

06:02.680 --> 06:12.380
and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people,

06:12.546 --> 06:16.647
but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.680
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

06:21.413 --> 06:26.079
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving,”

06:26.280 --> 06:33.480
and the seven chakras were described, on the right side.

06:35.179 --> 06:41.313
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

06:42.079 --> 06:46.280
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

06:46.680 --> 06:52.613
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha.

06:53.546 --> 06:59.079
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;

06:59.546 --> 07:05.313
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside,

07:05.346 --> 07:12.213
is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

07:13.046 --> 07:21.046
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

07:23.647 --> 07:35.079
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

07:35.546 --> 07:41.413
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,

07:41.813 --> 07:46.246
go to the people – janah.

07:47.546 --> 07:52.346
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

07:53.647 --> 07:59.146
In tapah we have Christ in the center;

08:00.546 --> 08:10.079
left side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

08:12.413 --> 08:16.246
They were not actually ascending path,

08:17.113 --> 08:22.580
they were just side outlets, we can say,

08:23.179 --> 08:29.747
for the energy of people who were trying to seek the truth.

08:32.546 --> 08:39.213
Now this happened for ages in India.

08:39.647 --> 08:42.246
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

08:43.313 --> 08:46.280
all the big tapassvis, all of them did this.

08:46.713 --> 08:49.113
But where did they reach?

08:49.480 --> 08:54.747
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses –

08:55.113 --> 09:00.146
kshu, shapah – to people, they could curse somebody.

09:01.380 --> 09:09.346
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye they could kill somebody,

09:10.113 --> 09:15.213
they could burn something; all right-sided powers they had.

09:15.713 --> 09:20.713
And with these right-sided powers, where did they reach?

09:21.580 --> 09:27.480
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not, in the limbo, as you call it.

09:29.113 --> 09:32.280
There nobody got Self-realization.

09:33.513 --> 09:43.113
You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks;

09:45.213 --> 09:51.580
and then we had Egyptians, English

09:52.546 --> 09:59.213
and all kinds of aggressive people, Germans

09:59.513 --> 10:09.847
– all of them were aggressive – Catholics, and also you had Romans.

10:10.613 --> 10:12.647
All of them were aggressive,

10:13.179 --> 10:18.747
and were taking the land and property of other countries;

10:19.480 --> 10:25.346
extremely aggressive, they believed in the killing of the people -

10:28.580 --> 10:32.680
extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

10:33.713 --> 10:42.246
So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path?

10:45.813 --> 10:54.113
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv, swaha, swadha,

10:54.580 --> 10:59.213
it’s consumption – this was done by Guru Principle.

11:00.680 --> 11:07.113
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

11:07.480 --> 11:11.446
They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful

11:12.079 --> 11:21.413
that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

11:21.813 --> 11:25.413
With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people

11:25.413 --> 11:27.346
and were oppressing them.

11:29.113 --> 11:34.113
All this kind of … generation came in the history,

11:34.113 --> 11:37.246
as you know, and then it disappeared.

11:39.446 --> 11:47.280
Wars were created, then so many people were killed.

11:48.446 --> 11:54.113
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

11:55.113 --> 11:59.113
They never cared for humanity.

12:00.146 --> 12:03.747
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

12:04.413 --> 12:14.246
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ.

12:15.313 --> 12:19.113
They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints

12:19.213 --> 12:25.146
through the central path – some were incarnations –

12:25.446 --> 12:27.413
and they destroyed them.

12:28.847 --> 12:37.480
All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened.

12:39.213 --> 12:43.647
And one after another so many rakshasas came,

12:44.446 --> 12:50.113
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world;

12:51.546 --> 12:57.413
extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them,

12:58.179 --> 13:00.546
very aggressive people.

13:01.580 --> 13:10.446
And this aggression came, came with such a great force,

13:11.580 --> 13:14.113
and followed one after another.

13:17.246 --> 13:20.179
It went up to a point.

13:20.513 --> 13:28.280
When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed.

13:34.113 --> 13:38.246
So horrible people were created;

13:45.213 --> 14:00.113
all these people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

14:03.280 --> 14:11.413
This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided.

14:12.546 --> 14:23.313
All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others.

14:24.647 --> 14:30.246
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth.

14:31.647 --> 14:34.713
They wanted to have spirituality,

14:35.346 --> 14:45.647
but with this kind of behavior they had developed, spirituality ran away.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.146
We had so many incarnations.

14:50.613 --> 14:55.446
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

14:57.413 --> 15:06.380
There was no possibility of saving human beings in general.

15:08.580 --> 15:11.747
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

15:12.680 --> 15:17.046
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,

15:17.113 --> 15:21.780
all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

15:23.246 --> 15:30.613
All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement

15:31.380 --> 15:35.380
which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not.

15:36.513 --> 15:42.079
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage

15:42.613 --> 15:49.613
that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas,

15:50.113 --> 15:54.680
without realizing that human beings are rakshasas,

15:55.580 --> 15:58.280
that's what they become.

16:01.713 --> 16:04.613
Even their gurus were like that,

16:05.346 --> 16:13.280
and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations,

16:13.613 --> 16:16.647
all the incarnations were tortured by them.

16:17.613 --> 16:22.113
It was really – how they saved themselves is remarkable,

16:22.780 --> 16:28.079
but ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

16:29.513 --> 16:36.613
So the first thing I tried was to study about the kundalini,

16:38.446 --> 16:41.546
that I should be able to raise the kundalini.

16:41.813 --> 16:44.213
And I knew I had come for that,

16:44.480 --> 16:49.313
not for anything else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

16:49.546 --> 16:56.613
so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left.

16:57.413 --> 17:03.513
But I told you the knowledge of the left side, plus raising your kundalini.

17:04.380 --> 17:09.480
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,

17:10.613 --> 17:22.280
and you entered into the realm of real joy, of reality.

17:23.847 --> 17:29.446
All these bad qualities started falling out.

17:31.113 --> 17:34.246
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

17:35.380 --> 17:39.380
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path,

17:40.213 --> 17:45.113
you became very pure people.

17:45.747 --> 17:50.513
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away,

17:51.113 --> 17:56.046
your cheapness went away and you became very, very –

18:00.413 --> 18:03.613
I think we should call them the holy people.

18:04.380 --> 18:09.079
Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

18:09.680 --> 18:14.513
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish,

18:14.780 --> 18:20.546
you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that,

18:21.046 --> 18:25.380
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

18:26.213 --> 18:28.346
So all such people were thrown out.

18:28.613 --> 18:32.179
Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say.

18:32.413 --> 18:35.179
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

18:35.413 --> 18:41.079
But they understand now, some of them, that “we have made mistakes.”

18:41.413 --> 18:48.480
So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity,

18:49.446 --> 18:53.079
respect it and enjoy it.

18:53.546 --> 18:58.546
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

18:59.513 --> 19:07.313
That's the first chakra on the left side, where you have Shri Ganesha.

19:08.580 --> 19:12.280
But on the right side also we have deities.

19:12.413 --> 19:18.280
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,

19:19.046 --> 19:22.580
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

19:23.613 --> 19:30.313
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity,

19:31.113 --> 19:35.146
and we started understanding the beauty of purity,

19:35.480 --> 19:38.280
the power of purity.

19:41.513 --> 19:46.446
That's how our right side we finished off.

19:47.113 --> 19:53.413
Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger.

19:55.613 --> 19:58.580
There was no peace for these people.

19:59.280 --> 20:06.079
The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

20:07.580 --> 20:16.079
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level of Swadisthan.

20:17.146 --> 20:21.213
In Swadisthana they rose,

20:21.647 --> 20:28.246
and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.346
Even now we have many.

20:31.546 --> 20:36.647
They create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque,

20:37.113 --> 20:46.546
also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name.

20:47.446 --> 20:51.146
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

20:51.280 --> 20:56.179
people who wanted to have a name, a position –

20:57.413 --> 21:00.413
that came from right Swadisthana.

21:01.346 --> 21:07.647
Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi Chakra.

21:08.413 --> 21:12.446
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make money,

21:12.513 --> 21:18.346
not Lakshmi but money, money by any means,

21:19.546 --> 21:23.346
and they cheated the whole world.

21:23.647 --> 21:31.046
With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things.

21:33.647 --> 21:39.446
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

21:40.647 --> 21:47.113
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India,

21:48.413 --> 21:52.613
and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

21:55.213 --> 22:02.246
In the center, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness:

22:02.747 --> 22:06.513
creative of art, which is very beautiful,

22:06.613 --> 22:11.546
which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

22:12.380 --> 22:16.280
That vanished, and people started showing

22:16.313 --> 22:20.413
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

22:21.513 --> 22:25.613
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.780
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

22:31.413 --> 22:39.113
In Nabhi people got after money.

22:40.747 --> 22:43.113
Left-sided people were making money,

22:43.179 --> 22:45.647
right-sided were aggressive with their money.

22:45.713 --> 22:49.380
If they were earning they thought they’re on top of the world.

22:50.213 --> 22:54.280
If they had money they thought, “Nobody is better than us.”

22:55.580 --> 23:00.780
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.546
It will come to that point where they will realize

23:05.079 --> 23:10.280
that money is not for destroying but for construction:

23:10.813 --> 23:15.179
constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together

23:15.346 --> 23:18.213
to bring peace and love among them,

23:19.313 --> 23:25.513
for helping, for doing all kinds of good things.

23:27.380 --> 23:38.380
Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother,

23:40.213 --> 23:45.246
and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children,

23:45.480 --> 23:52.480
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children.

23:53.246 --> 23:56.380
We have had enough of these women

23:56.713 --> 24:01.280
who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children.

24:02.113 --> 24:06.446
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

24:08.113 --> 24:13.113
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw,

24:13.346 --> 24:17.446
and I was shocked – what sort of human beings are those?

24:17.747 --> 24:20.146
What am I going to do with them?

24:20.513 --> 24:23.179
How will I awaken their kundalini?

24:24.113 --> 24:27.179
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost,

24:28.213 --> 24:31.079
but now it is the Mother's chakra.

24:31.413 --> 24:36.713
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they drove out their children –

24:37.413 --> 24:42.446
very selfish, self-centered, dominating parents.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.480
This was the Heart Chakra.

24:53.179 --> 24:57.380
Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi.

24:58.179 --> 25:03.246
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world.

25:04.313 --> 25:13.446
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors,

25:13.680 --> 25:18.546
and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent

25:19.113 --> 25:22.113
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

25:22.246 --> 25:24.413
They really were rakshasas, I should say,

25:24.613 --> 25:27.480
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

25:28.179 --> 25:32.313
In their behavior, in everything you can see how they behave

25:32.480 --> 25:37.146
towards people, treating them like that,

25:37.613 --> 25:44.446
creating people who are against spirituality,

25:45.113 --> 25:48.113
and those who are aggressive.

25:49.380 --> 25:53.680
Well, these became like a two-sided world

25:53.813 --> 25:58.346
where there are people who are aggressive,

25:59.113 --> 26:01.313
and the people who are tortured.

26:01.580 --> 26:11.213
This two-sided world exists even now, but is much less.

26:12.513 --> 26:16.313
Thanks to the collective understanding

26:16.380 --> 26:21.179
there are many good institution that were established

26:21.513 --> 26:26.113
but they are not working out, they are not so successful,

26:26.546 --> 26:32.346
because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what?

26:32.613 --> 26:35.613
Not themselves – controlling others,

26:36.113 --> 26:41.313
and all their behavior has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

26:43.113 --> 26:47.113
Collectively you have, if you see around now today

26:47.313 --> 26:54.246
everywhere there’s war going on, fights going on, killing going on,

26:54.246 --> 26:59.613
destruction going on. How is it?

27:00.346 --> 27:05.213
There are so many spiritual people here now on this world.

27:05.546 --> 27:10.046
So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet,

27:10.413 --> 27:13.480
very much enjoying their spiritual life,

27:14.213 --> 27:20.113
have become very quiet and very peaceful people.

27:20.580 --> 27:23.480
But that doesn't bring peace.

27:24.313 --> 27:29.179
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world,

27:29.313 --> 27:31.246
you have to do something about it.

27:31.580 --> 27:34.313
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

27:34.580 --> 27:39.580
but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done,

27:40.280 --> 27:43.346
how far they have gone, where can we meet them,

27:43.513 --> 27:45.280
what can we change them.

27:45.380 --> 27:47.847
At My level I can change many things,

27:48.213 --> 27:51.313
but at your level how many people have you changed?

27:51.680 --> 27:55.079
What have you done? That has to be said.

27:55.179 --> 27:59.313
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,

28:00.580 --> 28:03.246
and you are very happy with your peace,

28:03.380 --> 28:06.179
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

28:06.480 --> 28:10.380
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today,

28:10.680 --> 28:15.613
that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights

28:15.713 --> 28:19.446
are least bothered as to what good has to be done.

28:19.813 --> 28:23.713
What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality,

28:24.513 --> 28:28.113
come to the puja, have more and more of it.

28:28.246 --> 28:34.380
But they have done no collective work to change people.

28:34.513 --> 28:37.346
Some of them are working, one or two,

28:37.647 --> 28:40.213
but the rest of them are having a good time

28:40.446 --> 28:44.113
enjoying themselves in such a manner

28:44.580 --> 28:50.413
that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.780
I would like you to now introspect

28:54.146 --> 28:57.179
and find out how much collective work you have done,

28:57.446 --> 29:01.680
how many people you have got – like that.

29:02.113 --> 29:04.313
With whom are you talking?

29:04.580 --> 29:07.580
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

29:08.146 --> 29:10.113
Only so many are there.

29:10.346 --> 29:15.280
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

29:15.780 --> 29:18.346
So now you should take to the right side.

29:19.246 --> 29:23.113
And when you take to the right side we'll create dynamic people,

29:23.613 --> 29:32.513
not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.146
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

29:35.380 --> 29:40.513
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.613
And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them.

29:45.213 --> 29:49.813
But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing.

29:50.313 --> 29:53.780
In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

29:54.113 --> 29:58.179
Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

29:58.380 --> 30:03.380
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the left side,

30:03.413 --> 30:06.580
where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.546
I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

30:10.246 --> 30:15.747
But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great;

30:16.179 --> 30:19.113
but how many people have they given realization?

30:19.280 --> 30:22.680
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

30:23.213 --> 30:26.213
I have said even in the aeroplane also you go,

30:26.446 --> 30:30.179
you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

30:30.480 --> 30:35.146
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

30:35.380 --> 30:39.713
for our understanding of ourselves.

30:40.146 --> 30:43.413
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

30:44.079 --> 30:50.213
It has been brought to you for giving realizations to many people.

30:51.313 --> 30:53.380
I request all the younger people, younger generation

30:53.413 --> 30:57.113
not to waste their Sahaj energies

30:57.213 --> 30:59.480
on nonsense as the old people have done.

31:00.113 --> 31:03.246
You’d better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yog,

31:03.380 --> 31:05.246
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

31:05.546 --> 31:11.246
They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitute,

31:11.246 --> 31:13.446
doing this, - doing that – that's not your job.

31:13.780 --> 31:18.713
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more Sahaja yoginis.

31:18.847 --> 31:23.280
But that is not there, what I find is it's not there.

31:23.613 --> 31:27.480
The right side is missing. You should come to the right side.

31:27.780 --> 31:34.079
Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you,

31:34.346 --> 31:38.246
nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

31:38.513 --> 31:43.346
You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

31:44.747 --> 31:48.647
That is why we have come to the stagnated point

31:49.146 --> 31:52.246
that we should know we have to use our right side.

31:52.513 --> 31:55.313
Right side is very important.

31:56.213 --> 32:00.480
Next time I'll tell you about right side, what right-sided things you have.

32:00.613 --> 32:03.546
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try;

32:03.647 --> 32:08.446
so you use your right side in the right direction

32:08.747 --> 32:15.079
with the right understanding, not as some sort of,

32:15.179 --> 32:22.480
I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.280
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

32:26.513 --> 32:29.380
But now the time has come for you

32:29.780 --> 32:33.580
to do something more than what the saints have done before,

32:34.213 --> 32:37.480
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself

32:37.647 --> 32:42.113
that you have a family, you have very nice children,

32:42.113 --> 32:45.380
having, enjoying, all that – that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

32:46.847 --> 32:51.680
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

32:52.580 --> 32:57.546
You have to think about it: what are you doing, where are you,

32:58.280 --> 33:02.246
and what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

33:02.647 --> 33:06.346
Then we come to the Agnya.

33:07.580 --> 33:12.780
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis are become, they have,

33:13.146 --> 33:19.146
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything – that's not we want.

33:20.046 --> 33:23.546
What we want, to remove the sufferings of others,

33:24.280 --> 33:26.446
remove the aggression of others.

33:26.680 --> 33:31.413
So we don't, that kind of organization we don't have,

33:32.113 --> 33:34.513
that kind of understanding we don’t have.

33:34.847 --> 33:39.480
And if that works out, you will be different people.

33:40.113 --> 33:46.413
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls,

33:46.413 --> 33:51.280
something like that, not more than that.

33:52.113 --> 33:57.680
So better try to do something positive, without aggression.

33:57.847 --> 34:04.113
I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that.

34:05.346 --> 34:12.613
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

34:13.413 --> 34:17.613
then you will realize what mistakes you have,

34:18.713 --> 34:24.580
still what is lacking in your personality – that is very important.

34:24.847 --> 34:28.613
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,

34:30.179 --> 34:32.680
I don't know what happens to them.

34:33.413 --> 34:36.613
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

34:37.213 --> 34:41.446
But that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.580
Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight,

34:45.613 --> 34:49.546
not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive – no.

34:50.380 --> 34:57.680
You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong.

35:00.246 --> 35:02.146
You have to face it.

35:03.146 --> 35:08.313
If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people.

35:08.813 --> 35:12.580
What's the use of you people getting your realization?

35:14.280 --> 35:19.680
So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations,

35:19.680 --> 35:22.146
that we are all right,

35:22.246 --> 35:26.413
that you can cure some people is the last word – no.

35:27.313 --> 35:30.146
You have to spread it, you have to go in the public,

35:30.246 --> 35:33.246
you have to be collective on this point

35:33.280 --> 35:34.546
and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

35:35.046 --> 35:41.246
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much.

35:42.146 --> 35:46.580
So now it is you have to plan what you want to do,

35:46.680 --> 35:50.313
how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

35:50.613 --> 35:53.613
It's very important.

35:55.113 --> 36:02.113
Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga,

36:02.113 --> 36:06.580
singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until

36:06.580 --> 36:12.280
you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.546
In a small country like Turkey

36:16.146 --> 36:19.680
we have 25000 Sahaja yogis, what do you say?

36:20.179 --> 36:28.079
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis,

36:28.446 --> 36:34.113
while you find that number is very small in any other country.

36:35.246 --> 36:40.413
They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realization

36:40.613 --> 36:43.513
and for toward giving Self-realizations to others.

36:44.113 --> 36:49.413
It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

36:50.313 --> 36:58.680
So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers,

36:59.113 --> 37:01.313
think of giving power to others

37:01.513 --> 37:05.413
and making them Sahaja Yoga – it's very important.

37:06.179 --> 37:10.313
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all the powers.

37:11.413 --> 37:14.313
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

37:14.513 --> 37:16.580
what's the use of getting realization?

37:16.847 --> 37:20.446
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

37:20.713 --> 37:29.613
So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name,

37:30.113 --> 37:33.713
please try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

37:34.313 --> 37:37.580
Go into a very dynamic force.

37:38.346 --> 37:40.480
So many people have complained to Me

37:41.079 --> 37:44.546
that Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

37:45.580 --> 37:48.380
Is that what you are?

37:49.413 --> 37:55.380
Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people?

37:56.280 --> 37:59.413
In your country have you worked it out all over?

38:00.113 --> 38:01.680
Just think about it.

38:02.213 --> 38:06.146
And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna,

38:06.179 --> 38:07.380
you are not complete,

38:07.613 --> 38:12.580
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

38:13.446 --> 38:17.079
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day

38:17.113 --> 38:19.346
that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

38:19.546 --> 38:23.213
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

38:23.546 --> 38:26.680
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

38:28.246 --> 38:31.480
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

38:31.680 --> 38:38.346
It's like any other getting any other realization – that's not so important.

38:39.346 --> 38:41.146
Not only that you should spread,

38:41.313 --> 38:45.580
but also you should make them, and realize it.

38:53.213 --> 38:58.446
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you;

38:59.280 --> 39:03.580
but try to understand. All right?

39:04.246 --> 39:07.046
Thank you very much.
