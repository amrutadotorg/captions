00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:12.570
Today it's a different day altogether for all of you,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:22.370
because this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:31.079
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.413
it's not only the left side that you know.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.079
You all know only the left side, from Shri Ganesha

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:55.413
through the ascent of different, different chakras on the left side.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.179
I didn't want to tell you about the right side to begin with,

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:11.113
because those who have gone through the right side got just lost.

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:23.246
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings

00:01:25.113 --> 00:01:28.046
but they didn't know what it was about,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.179
they just used to learn it by heart.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:40.113
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:47.113
and that is how they moved on the right side

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:53.413
and, I don’t know, they landed up at the Agnya;

00:01:56.246 --> 00:02:00.613
and then they were trying for the Self-realization.

00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:07.113
They were promised that if you do this right side properly,

00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:14.280
you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realization.

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:18.079
But none of them reached there.

00:02:18.613 --> 00:02:22.113
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.113
terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:37.280
All these things they learnt through their right-side movement.

00:02:39.313 --> 00:02:42.113
There was no kundalini awakening,

00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:51.113
and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya Chakra,

00:02:52.113 --> 00:02:59.213
and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

00:03:02.647 --> 00:03:10.813
All these books were written without understanding

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:15.546
that it's not easy to go via right side,

00:03:17.346 --> 00:03:23.580
but best was to awaken your kundalini.

00:03:24.546 --> 00:03:30.079
The kundalini directly takes you up in the center of all the chakras,

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:37.113
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.113
into the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:51.213
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra, from where it pierces?

00:03:52.146 --> 00:03:54.346
I never told you about it.

00:03:55.113 --> 00:03:59.346
But now I think for most of you the time has come.

00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:06.213
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,

00:04:06.313 --> 00:04:11.613
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating always.

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:19.179
It is pulsating because the spirit entered through that area,

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:26.313
and when you close it, it settles in the heart.

00:04:28.213 --> 00:04:34.113
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented person,

00:04:34.513 --> 00:04:41.313
but how to enter into the Sahasrara was the problem.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.546
The tantrikas who were there, they went through the right, left side,

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:57.380
and they developed all the practices of black – we should say, the left side.

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:06.613
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, I should say,

00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:12.346
extremely ambitious, ferocious,

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:22.513
and they started killing people on the basis of cursing.

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:25.446
They are very good at cursing people;

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:31.546
to be always forward, push back all the people,

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:36.179
and override everybody's rights.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.246
They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:50.346
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.213
they then took the right side.

00:05:54.113 --> 00:05:58.179
Because of the right side they became very powerful, no doubt.

00:05:59.113 --> 00:06:02.146
They got all the powers over the world

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:12.380
and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people,

00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:16.647
but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.680
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:26.079
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving,”

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.480
and the seven chakras were described, on the right side.

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:41.313
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:46.280
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.613
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha.

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:59.079
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;

00:06:59.546 --> 00:07:05.313
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside,

00:07:05.346 --> 00:07:12.213
is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

00:07:13.046 --> 00:07:21.046
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

00:07:23.647 --> 00:07:35.079
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

00:07:35.546 --> 00:07:41.413
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,

00:07:41.813 --> 00:07:46.246
go to the people – janah.

00:07:47.546 --> 00:07:52.346
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

00:07:53.647 --> 00:07:59.146
In tapah we have Christ in the center;

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:10.079
left side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

00:08:12.413 --> 00:08:16.246
They were not actually ascending path,

00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:22.580
they were just side outlets, we can say,

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:29.747
for the energy of people who were trying to seek the truth.

00:08:32.546 --> 00:08:39.213
Now this happened for ages in India.

00:08:39.647 --> 00:08:42.246
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

00:08:43.313 --> 00:08:46.280
all the big tapassvis, all of them did this.

00:08:46.713 --> 00:08:49.113
But where did they reach?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.747
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses –

00:08:55.113 --> 00:09:00.146
kshu, shapah – to people, they could curse somebody.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:09.346
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye they could kill somebody,

00:09:10.113 --> 00:09:15.213
they could burn something; all right-sided powers they had.

00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:20.713
And with these right-sided powers, where did they reach?

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:27.480
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not, in the limbo, as you call it.

00:09:29.113 --> 00:09:32.280
There nobody got Self-realization.

00:09:33.513 --> 00:09:43.113
You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks;

00:09:45.213 --> 00:09:51.580
and then we had Egyptians, English

00:09:52.546 --> 00:09:59.213
and all kinds of aggressive people, Germans

00:09:59.513 --> 00:10:09.847
– all of them were aggressive – Catholics, and also you had Romans.

00:10:10.613 --> 00:10:12.647
All of them were aggressive,

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:18.747
and were taking the land and property of other countries;

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.346
extremely aggressive, they believed in the killing of the people -

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.680
extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:42.246
So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path?

00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:54.113
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv, swaha, swadha,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.213
it’s consumption – this was done by Guru Principle.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:07.113
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.446
They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:21.413
that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

00:11:21.813 --> 00:11:25.413
With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people

00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:27.346
and were oppressing them.

00:11:29.113 --> 00:11:34.113
All this kind of … generation came in the history,

00:11:34.113 --> 00:11:37.246
as you know, and then it disappeared.

00:11:39.446 --> 00:11:47.280
Wars were created, then so many people were killed.

00:11:48.446 --> 00:11:54.113
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

00:11:55.113 --> 00:11:59.113
They never cared for humanity.

00:12:00.146 --> 00:12:03.747
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

00:12:04.413 --> 00:12:14.246
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ.

00:12:15.313 --> 00:12:19.113
They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints

00:12:19.213 --> 00:12:25.146
through the central path – some were incarnations –

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:27.413
and they destroyed them.

00:12:28.847 --> 00:12:37.480
All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened.

00:12:39.213 --> 00:12:43.647
And one after another so many rakshasas came,

00:12:44.446 --> 00:12:50.113
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world;

00:12:51.546 --> 00:12:57.413
extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them,

00:12:58.179 --> 00:13:00.546
very aggressive people.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:10.446
And this aggression came, came with such a great force,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.113
and followed one after another.

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:20.179
It went up to a point.

00:13:20.513 --> 00:13:28.280
When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed.

00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:38.246
So horrible people were created;

00:13:45.213 --> 00:14:00.113
all these people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:11.413
This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided.

00:14:12.546 --> 00:14:23.313
All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others.

00:14:24.647 --> 00:14:30.246
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth.

00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:34.713
They wanted to have spirituality,

00:14:35.346 --> 00:14:45.647
but with this kind of behavior they had developed, spirituality ran away.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.146
We had so many incarnations.

00:14:50.613 --> 00:14:55.446
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

00:14:57.413 --> 00:15:06.380
There was no possibility of saving human beings in general.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.747
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:17.046
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,

00:15:17.113 --> 00:15:21.780
all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

00:15:23.246 --> 00:15:30.613
All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.380
which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not.

00:15:36.513 --> 00:15:42.079
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage

00:15:42.613 --> 00:15:49.613
that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas,

00:15:50.113 --> 00:15:54.680
without realizing that human beings are rakshasas,

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.280
that's what they become.

00:16:01.713 --> 00:16:04.613
Even their gurus were like that,

00:16:05.346 --> 00:16:13.280
and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations,

00:16:13.613 --> 00:16:16.647
all the incarnations were tortured by them.

00:16:17.613 --> 00:16:22.113
It was really – how they saved themselves is remarkable,

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:28.079
but ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

00:16:29.513 --> 00:16:36.613
So the first thing I tried was to study about the kundalini,

00:16:38.446 --> 00:16:41.546
that I should be able to raise the kundalini.

00:16:41.813 --> 00:16:44.213
And I knew I had come for that,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.313
not for anything else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

00:16:49.546 --> 00:16:56.613
so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left.

00:16:57.413 --> 00:17:03.513
But I told you the knowledge of the left side, plus raising your kundalini.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.480
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:22.280
and you entered into the realm of real joy, of reality.

00:17:23.847 --> 00:17:29.446
All these bad qualities started falling out.

00:17:31.113 --> 00:17:34.246
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.380
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path,

00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:45.113
you became very pure people.

00:17:45.747 --> 00:17:50.513
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away,

00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:56.046
your cheapness went away and you became very, very –

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.613
I think we should call them the holy people.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.079
Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.513
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish,

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:20.546
you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that,

00:18:21.046 --> 00:18:25.380
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:26.213 --> 00:18:28.346
So all such people were thrown out.

00:18:28.613 --> 00:18:32.179
Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say.

00:18:32.413 --> 00:18:35.179
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

00:18:35.413 --> 00:18:41.079
But they understand now, some of them, that “we have made mistakes.”

00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:48.480
So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity,

00:18:49.446 --> 00:18:53.079
respect it and enjoy it.

00:18:53.546 --> 00:18:58.546
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:07.313
That's the first chakra on the left side, where you have Shri Ganesha.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.280
But on the right side also we have deities.

00:19:12.413 --> 00:19:18.280
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,

00:19:19.046 --> 00:19:22.580
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

00:19:23.613 --> 00:19:30.313
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity,

00:19:31.113 --> 00:19:35.146
and we started understanding the beauty of purity,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.280
the power of purity.

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:46.446
That's how our right side we finished off.

00:19:47.113 --> 00:19:53.413
Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger.

00:19:55.613 --> 00:19:58.580
There was no peace for these people.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:06.079
The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:16.079
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level of Swadisthan.

00:20:17.146 --> 00:20:21.213
In Swadisthana they rose,

00:20:21.647 --> 00:20:28.246
and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.346
Even now we have many.

00:20:31.546 --> 00:20:36.647
They create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque,

00:20:37.113 --> 00:20:46.546
also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name.

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:51.146
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.179
people who wanted to have a name, a position –

00:20:57.413 --> 00:21:00.413
that came from right Swadisthana.

00:21:01.346 --> 00:21:07.647
Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi Chakra.

00:21:08.413 --> 00:21:12.446
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make money,

00:21:12.513 --> 00:21:18.346
not Lakshmi but money, money by any means,

00:21:19.546 --> 00:21:23.346
and they cheated the whole world.

00:21:23.647 --> 00:21:31.046
With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things.

00:21:33.647 --> 00:21:39.446
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

00:21:40.647 --> 00:21:47.113
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India,

00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:52.613
and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

00:21:55.213 --> 00:22:02.246
In the center, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness:

00:22:02.747 --> 00:22:06.513
creative of art, which is very beautiful,

00:22:06.613 --> 00:22:11.546
which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.280
That vanished, and people started showing

00:22:16.313 --> 00:22:20.413
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

00:22:21.513 --> 00:22:25.613
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:30.780
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

00:22:31.413 --> 00:22:39.113
In Nabhi people got after money.

00:22:40.747 --> 00:22:43.113
Left-sided people were making money,

00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:45.647
right-sided were aggressive with their money.

00:22:45.713 --> 00:22:49.380
If they were earning they thought they’re on top of the world.

00:22:50.213 --> 00:22:54.280
If they had money they thought, “Nobody is better than us.”

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:00.780
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:04.546
It will come to that point where they will realize

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:10.280
that money is not for destroying but for construction:

00:23:10.813 --> 00:23:15.179
constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together

00:23:15.346 --> 00:23:18.213
to bring peace and love among them,

00:23:19.313 --> 00:23:25.513
for helping, for doing all kinds of good things.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:38.380
Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother,

00:23:40.213 --> 00:23:45.246
and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children,

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:52.480
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children.

00:23:53.246 --> 00:23:56.380
We have had enough of these women

00:23:56.713 --> 00:24:01.280
who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children.

00:24:02.113 --> 00:24:06.446
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

00:24:08.113 --> 00:24:13.113
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw,

00:24:13.346 --> 00:24:17.446
and I was shocked – what sort of human beings are those?

00:24:17.747 --> 00:24:20.146
What am I going to do with them?

00:24:20.513 --> 00:24:23.179
How will I awaken their kundalini?

00:24:24.113 --> 00:24:27.179
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost,

00:24:28.213 --> 00:24:31.079
but now it is the Mother's chakra.

00:24:31.413 --> 00:24:36.713
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they drove out their children –

00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:42.446
very selfish, self-centered, dominating parents.

00:24:49.113 --> 00:24:51.480
This was the Heart Chakra.

00:24:53.179 --> 00:24:57.380
Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi.

00:24:58.179 --> 00:25:03.246
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world.

00:25:04.313 --> 00:25:13.446
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.546
and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent

00:25:19.113 --> 00:25:22.113
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

00:25:22.246 --> 00:25:24.413
They really were rakshasas, I should say,

00:25:24.613 --> 00:25:27.480
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

00:25:28.179 --> 00:25:32.313
In their behavior, in everything you can see how they behave

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.146
towards people, treating them like that,

00:25:37.613 --> 00:25:44.446
creating people who are against spirituality,

00:25:45.113 --> 00:25:48.113
and those who are aggressive.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.680
Well, these became like a two-sided world

00:25:53.813 --> 00:25:58.346
where there are people who are aggressive,

00:25:59.113 --> 00:26:01.313
and the people who are tortured.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:11.213
This two-sided world exists even now, but is much less.

00:26:12.513 --> 00:26:16.313
Thanks to the collective understanding

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:21.179
there are many good institution that were established

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:26.113
but they are not working out, they are not so successful,

00:26:26.546 --> 00:26:32.346
because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what?

00:26:32.613 --> 00:26:35.613
Not themselves – controlling others,

00:26:36.113 --> 00:26:41.313
and all their behavior has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

00:26:43.113 --> 00:26:47.113
Collectively you have, if you see around now today

00:26:47.313 --> 00:26:54.246
everywhere there’s war going on, fights going on, killing going on,

00:26:54.246 --> 00:26:59.613
destruction going on. How is it?

00:27:00.346 --> 00:27:05.213
There are so many spiritual people here now on this world.

00:27:05.546 --> 00:27:10.046
So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet,

00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:13.480
very much enjoying their spiritual life,

00:27:14.213 --> 00:27:20.113
have become very quiet and very peaceful people.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.480
But that doesn't bring peace.

00:27:24.313 --> 00:27:29.179
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world,

00:27:29.313 --> 00:27:31.246
you have to do something about it.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.313
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:39.580
but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.346
how far they have gone, where can we meet them,

00:27:43.513 --> 00:27:45.280
what can we change them.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.847
At My level I can change many things,

00:27:48.213 --> 00:27:51.313
but at your level how many people have you changed?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.079
What have you done? That has to be said.

00:27:55.179 --> 00:27:59.313
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.246
and you are very happy with your peace,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.179
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.380
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today,

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.613
that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights

00:28:15.713 --> 00:28:19.446
are least bothered as to what good has to be done.

00:28:19.813 --> 00:28:23.713
What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality,

00:28:24.513 --> 00:28:28.113
come to the puja, have more and more of it.

00:28:28.246 --> 00:28:34.380
But they have done no collective work to change people.

00:28:34.513 --> 00:28:37.346
Some of them are working, one or two,

00:28:37.647 --> 00:28:40.213
but the rest of them are having a good time

00:28:40.446 --> 00:28:44.113
enjoying themselves in such a manner

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:50.413
that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all.

00:28:51.313 --> 00:28:53.780
I would like you to now introspect

00:28:54.146 --> 00:28:57.179
and find out how much collective work you have done,

00:28:57.446 --> 00:29:01.680
how many people you have got – like that.

00:29:02.113 --> 00:29:04.313
With whom are you talking?

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.580
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:10.113
Only so many are there.

00:29:10.346 --> 00:29:15.280
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.346
So now you should take to the right side.

00:29:19.246 --> 00:29:23.113
And when you take to the right side we'll create dynamic people,

00:29:23.613 --> 00:29:32.513
not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:35.146
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.513
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.613
And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them.

00:29:45.213 --> 00:29:49.813
But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing.

00:29:50.313 --> 00:29:53.780
In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:54.113 --> 00:29:58.179
Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:03.380
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the left side,

00:30:03.413 --> 00:30:06.580
where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing.

00:30:06.847 --> 00:30:09.546
I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

00:30:10.246 --> 00:30:15.747
But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great;

00:30:16.179 --> 00:30:19.113
but how many people have they given realization?

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.680
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:23.213 --> 00:30:26.213
I have said even in the aeroplane also you go,

00:30:26.446 --> 00:30:30.179
you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.146
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:39.713
for our understanding of ourselves.

00:30:40.146 --> 00:30:43.413
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:50.213
It has been brought to you for giving realizations to many people.

00:30:51.313 --> 00:30:53.380
I request all the younger people, younger generation

00:30:53.413 --> 00:30:57.113
not to waste their Sahaj energies

00:30:57.213 --> 00:30:59.480
on nonsense as the old people have done.

00:31:00.113 --> 00:31:03.246
You’d better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yog,

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.246
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:11.246
They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitute,

00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:13.446
doing this, - doing that – that's not your job.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.713
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more Sahaja yoginis.

00:31:18.847 --> 00:31:23.280
But that is not there, what I find is it's not there.

00:31:23.613 --> 00:31:27.480
The right side is missing. You should come to the right side.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:34.079
Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you,

00:31:34.346 --> 00:31:38.246
nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

00:31:38.513 --> 00:31:43.346
You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

00:31:44.747 --> 00:31:48.647
That is why we have come to the stagnated point

00:31:49.146 --> 00:31:52.246
that we should know we have to use our right side.

00:31:52.513 --> 00:31:55.313
Right side is very important.

00:31:56.213 --> 00:32:00.480
Next time I'll tell you about right side, what right-sided things you have.

00:32:00.613 --> 00:32:03.546
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try;

00:32:03.647 --> 00:32:08.446
so you use your right side in the right direction

00:32:08.747 --> 00:32:15.079
with the right understanding, not as some sort of,

00:32:15.179 --> 00:32:22.480
I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.280
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

00:32:26.513 --> 00:32:29.380
But now the time has come for you

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.580
to do something more than what the saints have done before,

00:32:34.213 --> 00:32:37.480
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself

00:32:37.647 --> 00:32:42.113
that you have a family, you have very nice children,

00:32:42.113 --> 00:32:45.380
having, enjoying, all that – that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

00:32:46.847 --> 00:32:51.680
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:57.546
You have to think about it: what are you doing, where are you,

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.246
and what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:06.346
Then we come to the Agnya.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:12.780
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis are become, they have,

00:33:13.146 --> 00:33:19.146
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything – that's not we want.

00:33:20.046 --> 00:33:23.546
What we want, to remove the sufferings of others,

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.446
remove the aggression of others.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.413
So we don't, that kind of organization we don't have,

00:33:32.113 --> 00:33:34.513
that kind of understanding we don’t have.

00:33:34.847 --> 00:33:39.480
And if that works out, you will be different people.

00:33:40.113 --> 00:33:46.413
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls,

00:33:46.413 --> 00:33:51.280
something like that, not more than that.

00:33:52.113 --> 00:33:57.680
So better try to do something positive, without aggression.

00:33:57.847 --> 00:34:04.113
I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that.

00:34:05.346 --> 00:34:12.613
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

00:34:13.413 --> 00:34:17.613
then you will realize what mistakes you have,

00:34:18.713 --> 00:34:24.580
still what is lacking in your personality – that is very important.

00:34:24.847 --> 00:34:28.613
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.680
I don't know what happens to them.

00:34:33.413 --> 00:34:36.613
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

00:34:37.213 --> 00:34:41.446
But that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.580
Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight,

00:34:45.613 --> 00:34:49.546
not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive – no.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:57.680
You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong.

00:35:00.246 --> 00:35:02.146
You have to face it.

00:35:03.146 --> 00:35:08.313
If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people.

00:35:08.813 --> 00:35:12.580
What's the use of you people getting your realization?

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:19.680
So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations,

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.146
that we are all right,

00:35:22.246 --> 00:35:26.413
that you can cure some people is the last word – no.

00:35:27.313 --> 00:35:30.146
You have to spread it, you have to go in the public,

00:35:30.246 --> 00:35:33.246
you have to be collective on this point

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.546
and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:35.046 --> 00:35:41.246
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much.

00:35:42.146 --> 00:35:46.580
So now it is you have to plan what you want to do,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.313
how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:50.613 --> 00:35:53.613
It's very important.

00:35:55.113 --> 00:36:02.113
Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:02.113 --> 00:36:06.580
singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:12.280
you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.546
In a small country like Turkey

00:36:16.146 --> 00:36:19.680
we have 25000 Sahaja yogis, what do you say?

00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:28.079
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis,

00:36:28.446 --> 00:36:34.113
while you find that number is very small in any other country.

00:36:35.246 --> 00:36:40.413
They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realization

00:36:40.613 --> 00:36:43.513
and for toward giving Self-realizations to others.

00:36:44.113 --> 00:36:49.413
It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

00:36:50.313 --> 00:36:58.680
So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers,

00:36:59.113 --> 00:37:01.313
think of giving power to others

00:37:01.513 --> 00:37:05.413
and making them Sahaja Yoga – it's very important.

00:37:06.179 --> 00:37:10.313
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all the powers.

00:37:11.413 --> 00:37:14.313
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:14.513 --> 00:37:16.580
what's the use of getting realization?

00:37:16.847 --> 00:37:20.446
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

00:37:20.713 --> 00:37:29.613
So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name,

00:37:30.113 --> 00:37:33.713
please try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:34.313 --> 00:37:37.580
Go into a very dynamic force.

00:37:38.346 --> 00:37:40.480
So many people have complained to Me

00:37:41.079 --> 00:37:44.546
that Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.380
Is that what you are?

00:37:49.413 --> 00:37:55.380
Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people?

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.413
In your country have you worked it out all over?

00:38:00.113 --> 00:38:01.680
Just think about it.

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:06.146
And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna,

00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:07.380
you are not complete,

00:38:07.613 --> 00:38:12.580
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

00:38:13.446 --> 00:38:17.079
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day

00:38:17.113 --> 00:38:19.346
that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

00:38:19.546 --> 00:38:23.213
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

00:38:23.546 --> 00:38:26.680
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

00:38:28.246 --> 00:38:31.480
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:38.346
It's like any other getting any other realization – that's not so important.

00:38:39.346 --> 00:38:41.146
Not only that you should spread,

00:38:41.313 --> 00:38:45.580
but also you should make them, and realize it.

00:38:53.213 --> 00:38:58.446
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you;

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.580
but try to understand. All right?

00:39:04.246 --> 00:39:07.046
Thank you very much.
