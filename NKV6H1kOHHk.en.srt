1
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,840
Today, you are all here to worship your Guru.

2
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,480
It is

3
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,400
a common practice, specially in India,

4
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,760
that you must

5
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,000
worship your guru,

6
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,120
and the guru has to

7
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:02,600
fully be in control of his disciples.

8
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,120
Guru Principle is

9
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,680
extremely strict,

10
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,880
and the strictness made many people

11
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,080
could not conform to the ideals of a disciple.

12
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,320
In those days the guru had to be,

13
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,120
absolutely, the authority

14
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,480
and it was

15
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,960
the guru who would decide

16
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,080
which disciples he’ll have.

17
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,520
And one had to go into great tapasya,

18
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,640
to great penances, to even become a disciple.

19
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,560
And this hardship

20
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,480
was the only way the guru used to judge.

21
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,880
Gurus would always live in jungles

22
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,440
and they would select their disciples, very few, very, very few

23
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,000
and they had to go and beg food

24
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,960
from the neighboring villages,

25
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,560
and cook food for their guru with their own hands,

26
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,760
and feed the guru.

27
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,600
That sort of

28
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,760
guru business is not in Sahaja Yoga.

29
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,880
That basically we must understand

30
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,760
that the difference between those styles

31
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,880
of guruship and

32
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,320
that we have now is this,

33
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,640
that very few individuals

34
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,960
were given the chance to become the guru, very few.

35
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,280
And these few also were selected out of

36
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,400
quite a lot of people and they felt

37
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,760
that they were something really special that they are being selected,

38
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,000
chosen, and that whatever

39
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,800
they will have to go through is all welcome.

40
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,640
With this idea, they became the disciples.

41
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,920
But Sahaja Yoga is a very different thing.

42
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,280
I would say just the opposite.

43
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,080
First of all, your Guru is a Mother

44
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,720
and who suffers from Sandrakaruna.

45
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,640
At the slightest things that happen to you

46
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,520
My eyes get filled with tears.

47
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,040
So as a Mother

48
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,040
to be a Guru is a very difficult thing.

49
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,080
At the same time, for you to achieve heights is also difficult.

50
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,240
Because you get lost

51
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,080
when I love you so much

52
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,040
and in that love you forget sometimes,

53
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,920
that the progress in your being is very slow.

54
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,080
It is important

55
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,160
that in Sahaja Yoga you have to be strict with yourself.

56
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,680
That’s why I said that you have to be your own guru,

57
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,400
which people do not understand what it means.

58
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,920
You have to be your own guru means you have to guide yourself;

59
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:05,480
you have to treat yourself as your disciple

60
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,800
and you have to trim yourself.

61
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,040
If you do not understand

62
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,920
the responsibility as Sahaja Yogi,

63
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,800
of working it out yourself everything,

64
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,800
you cannot move very fast,

65
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,280
because

66
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,200
it is a different type

67
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,640
of relationship between the Guru and the disciples.

68
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,520
So first I have always said you become your own guru.

69
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,520
So you have to make

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,960
a lot of introspection

71
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,600
and fix your ideals.

72
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,720
Before you I am sitting.

73
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,840
You have seen Me how I am.

74
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,880
I can eat anything;

75
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,120
I need not eat at all for days together.

76
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,840
I can sleep anywhere;

77
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,520
I may not sleep at all.

78
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,880
I travel for miles together untiringly.

79
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:47,000
I have this energy because

80
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,680
I’m a Guru of Myself also.

81
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,400
So the first thing is that there should be lot of introspection,

82
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,720
“What’s wrong with me?” Not wrong with others.

83
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,960
“What’s wrong with me?

84
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,480
Am I seeking the comfort of my body?

85
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,680
The attention, is it on my body or on my spirit?

86
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,160
If so, what am I doing?”

87
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,520
I think best thing is to write it down.

88
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,360
“Can I sleep on the grass?

89
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,960
Can I sit on the stone?”

90
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,240
You have to make this body work.

91
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,440
“Can I sleep anytime I like,

92
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,600
and can I keep awake anytime I like?”

93
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,680
I have seen people doze off.

94
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,400
The reason is this, not that they are bad

95
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,400
or in any way indisciplined people

96
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,720
but because inside they are tired.

97
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:13,440
If you are tired inside then you feel tired all the time.

98
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,360
You’ll see on the television, if you see people in the West,

99
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,440
they’re always sitting like this.

100
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,400
Because they are so very tired.

101
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Why are they so tired? They don’t work so hard.

102
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,880
So introspect how you behave.

103
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,840
Now when you start introspecting yourself,

104
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,440
you’ll also start introspecting your surroundings

105
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
and your styles
and your methods,

106
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,000
and what you are doing to yourself

107
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,200
because of the conditionings of the outside.

108
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,520
Now the conditionings of the outside in the West,

109
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,400
are of a psychological nature.

110
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,600
Indians have other conditionings which are also quite surprising,

111
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,720
or we should say the Western  people,

112
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,160
they must wash their hand ten times,

113
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,840
even if their skin comes out, they’ll go on washing like mad.

114
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,440
They must have a bathroom attached to them all the time.

115
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,560
They must have their baths.

116
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,880
If they don’t have bath they are not comfortable.

117
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,880
They have other conditionings also.

118
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,531
All kinds of stupid conditionings they have

119
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,280
but the conditionings that we have in the West

120
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,240
are more psychological and that’s why

121
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,880
you cannot find out what’s wrong with you.

122
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,200
The physical conditionings are not so dangerous,

123
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,800
you can get over them or you can manage.

124
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,280
But when you have conditioning of your psychology

125
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,480
you cannot understand what’s wrong with you.

126
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,280
Now if you see, if you introspect around,

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,960
what you will find is a very subtle thing.

128
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,760
Firstly, that

129
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,840
because of the wars maybe, I don’t know why

130
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,080
but everybody is afraid of everyone.

131
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,680
Specially I think, Freud.

132
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Because of Freud, even the mother is afraid of the child,

133
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,960
and all these things to Indians are absolutely

134
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,520
they can’t understand this.

135
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,160
But, you people know that very well.

136
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,000
They won’t touch anybody;

137
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,880
they won’t hug anyone.

138
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,680
First of all when they used to play football, they used to hug.

139
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,280
But now I see they don’t hug they just touch hands like this.

140
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,880
After sometime I think they may

141
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,280
just do like that or something.

142
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,640
So frightened that nobody, even the children I’ve seen,

143
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,880
are frightened of hugging their parents.

144
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,840
So the expression of love is not there

145
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,920
and when there is no expression there is no love inside

146
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,400
and that’s how it goes on drying you up and drying you up and drying up.

147
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,240
There was a little girl in Sahaja Yoga

148
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,840
and I had some present for that child.

149
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,440
She was quite young, must have been about ten years of age.

150
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,280
So I gave it to one Sahaja yogi, Western Sahaja yogi,

151
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,360
that you go and give it to her and say that I have given.

152
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,840
“No Mother. I won’t give.” I said, “Why?”

153
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,680
“She’ll misunderstand me.” I said, “What will she misunderstand?”

154
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,720
It has gone so much into the heads of people.

155
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,600
And this has created really

156
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,840
the psychological insecurity within you.

157
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,760
From very childhood this insecurity has been working,

158
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,960
and that’s why you are frightened of each other.

159
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,840
Even of your parents, of your brothers, your sisters.

160
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,120
Psychologically you are suffering.

161
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,640
And when first I came to England they used to say

162
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,480
it is the insecurity. I said, “What insecurity?

163
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,880
The whole world is afraid of the Western world.”

164
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,840
And what are they suffering from insecurity?

165
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,200
They have made everybody insecure all over the world.

166
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,680
And why, what are they insecure?

167
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,040
They are insecured within themselves

168
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,480
in their own society, in their own family,

169
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,760
in their own groups.

170
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,960
They are so much frightened of each other.

171
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,080
So the first thing, you should be fearless.

172
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,280
You are a Sahaja Yogi, you are no more immoral,

173
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,120
cannot be immoral.

174
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,080
If all the time if you start thinking that you are immoral,

175
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,560
and if you do something it is immoral,

176
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,040
and that you have to go and do some confession somewhere,

177
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,120
then what is going to happen to you?

178
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,840
What sort of a personality you will have?

179
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,840
We have to change this by changing ourselves.

180
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,520
So among Sahaja yogis there should be

181
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,880
no insecurities but maryadas.

182
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,040
You must know how to respect each others privacy.

183
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,880
The second thing that if you find with the Western mind,

184
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,440
which is a very common thing,

185
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,160
that they are bombarded by criticism.

186
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,920
There are so many critics

187
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,560
that now there are no more artists left.

188
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,680
Only critics are criticizing critics.

189
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,760
All artists are finished.

190
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,160
They are all the time criticized.

191
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,640
Somebody will come in – there’s an education on criticism –

192
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,600
they may not know how to play any instrument,

193
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
they may not know how to sing,

194
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,160
but they can criticize all right.

195
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,680
So all the time in your mind, is a way

196
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,680
that you always feel that somebody will criticize if you do this.

197
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,360
All the time the fear is there that somebody will criticize.

198
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,720
So, “Should I say or not?”

199
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,320
As Sahaja yogis, you shouldn’t worry about

200
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,760
these stupid people because they are blind.

201
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,760
And if they want to criticize you, let them criticize.

202
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,800
What does it matter? Makes no difference.

203
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,160
But this you have to build up within yourself.

204
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,040
Now the third is even worse,

205
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,360
which I don’t know if you have noticed or not.

206
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:48,280
I don’t know how it has gone into the heads of the Western minds

207
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,960
that you must always see

208
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,960
to the other side of the bank,

209
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,920
even if you are standing on this side,

210
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
to be fair

211
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,880
and never to say something that you are sure of.

212
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,040
Like you ask anyone, “How are you?” He’ll say …

213
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,040
Always.

214
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,240
Nobody say, will say, “I am perfectly all right,

215
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,840
nothing wrong with me.”

216
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,160
“What’s wrong?”

217
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,640
“Perfectly all right, thank you very much.”

218
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,280
But it is never.

219
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,720
They are not sure of themselves, all the time, is shaking.

220
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,320
And this shaking inside

221
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,880
gives you a personality which can never progress.

222
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,320
Progress comes when you put your step forward,

223
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,760
you put your foot firmly on that point

224
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,520
and then put the second step forward,

225
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,280
like as you climb on a mountain.

226
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,200
But in the first place only if you are still thinking

227
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,240
that it’s half way through,

228
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,400
then how can you go further?

229
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,000
You’ll only move on two steps, this or that or this or that.

230
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,040
This is another very big psychological

231
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,840
deterrent I should call it,

232
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,000
or detrimental thing for your progress.

233
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,800
Now the third thing you have learned

234
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,800
which is also, third or fourth maybe,

235
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,320
that you must argue out yourself.

236
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,600
Like you have a problem,

237
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,320
you’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, this problem I have got.”

238
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,960
This is very common with everyone,

239
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,360
“I have this problem.”

240
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,240
I’ll say, “All right, this is the solution.”

241
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,880
Then you’ll come out, “No, no, no. But in this, this will happen.”

242
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,240
Then You tell another solution,

243
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,840
“No, no, no, no, no Mother, this can't be this way.”

244
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,560
All right, You tell third solution,

245
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
“No Mother, in this, this can happen.”

246
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,040
Tell fourth, “This can happen.”

247
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,920
You are standing against yourself all the time.

248
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,840
Then I have to say, “This is your problem, not Mine,

249
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,720
and I am giving you the solutions

250
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,680
and if you want to solve your problem,

251
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,320
better take a positive attitude.”

252
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,000
The brain is this way.

253
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,360
In our Hindi language it’s called “ulti khopdi.”

254
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,000
You are all the time arguing against yourself.

255
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,440
So how can you progress?

256
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,120
This is another great problem of the Western mind

257
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,280
that it doesn’t

258
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,920
try to face any problem as your own,

259
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,040
but go on arguing with yourself like a lawyer.

260
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,080
You see. there are two lawyers:

261
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,920
one yourself, another lawyer – go on arguing.

262
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,040
So is a double personality in the body, being;

263
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,160
is not a single personality.

264
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,160
As I said, it is very, very psychological

265
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,760
that people have to

266
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,680
take to this kind of a turn suddenly,

267
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,560
without understanding how dangerous it is.

268
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,960
With the enlightenment of your brain, this should disappear.

269
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,520
On the contrary in Sahaja Yoga, it’s very dangerous.

270
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,560
Because you say something, you are all Sahaja yogis,

271
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,120
you are connected with the all-pervading power.

272
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,960
Whatever you say gets connected

273
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,680
and it acts.

274
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,120
Is very dangerous

275
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,280
for you people not to realize that you are realized souls,

276
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,480
and not to assume your own powers.

277
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,520
Like you see, I have to say something secretly

278
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,920
then I must put My hand here and then say it

279
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,360
because it is connected to the mains.

280
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,840
But supposing I keep it open like this and say something,

281
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,080
it goes to everyone.

282
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
In the same way

283
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,120
whatever the Sahaja yogis say or desire or want,

284
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,160
there are just people sitting there, see here and here,

285
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,400
you have put them there.

286
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,240
They are listening to you all the time.

287
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,880
They are so anxious to do your work,

288
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,120
“All right, you say so, done.”

289
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,920
So whatever you think or whatever you desire

290
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,480
or whatever you say, you have to be extremely careful.

291
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,880
And when, now, I mean, old people, all right,

292
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,720
I can say that very conditioned, they have problems and all,

293
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,680
but the generation that is here, most of them,

294
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,760
are all capable of improving yourself

295
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,560
and making your brain straight

296
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,880
by bringing it backwards to the forward.

297
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,200
This psychological problem you do not say.

298
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,480
The another psychological problem is,

299
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,880
which you do not know, which is very surprising,

300
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,120
that whatever is the

301
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,720
entrepreneur’s ideas

302
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,040
you must act,

303
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,520
because the whole fundamentals of Western life

304
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,240
is to see and to be seen.

305
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,320
So, “Oh that’s the fashion so we should do like that.

306
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,000
This is the fashion so we do like that.”

307
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,800
Like the other day, about a year back,

308
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,120
I went to England and I found all the Sahaja Yoginis having their hair here

309
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,880
I said, “What’s this?”

310
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,560
So I asked an Indian girl, I said, “What is this supposed to be?”

311
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,560
“This is a new fashion.” I said, “What new fashion?”

312
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,920
Called as “ziprya” in Marathi you know, we call it ziprya fashion.

313
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,480
The Maharashtrians can ….

314
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,960
And they all had their hair here you know, like this, all.

315
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,680
I said, “My God, this is Agnya, this they are covering,

316
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,000
their eyes will become squinty.”

317
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,320
But the fashion if it comes,

318
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,680
and the whole fashion is with the hair alone.

319
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,120
Hair I don’t know what.

320
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,920
There’s so much interest in the hair.

321
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,560
And they lose the hair so fast in these countries,

322
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,600
without using the oil, which they should use.

323
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,920
They lose their hair very fast.

324
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,920
Starting from the hair, the Sahasrara.

325
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,600
Then fashion means –

326
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,880
What is this these entrepreneurs,

327
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,200
these stupid people are creating ideas

328
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,320
and there why should we follow?

329
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,640
I don’t say that Sahaja yogis should all look alike, not at all.

330
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,920
You can dress up the way you like; you can live the way you like

331
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,200
but you should not get yourself enslaved by any entrepreneurs.

332
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,600
You are free people now – know that very well.

333
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,400
Know that you are absolutely free

334
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,640
and your freedom is absolutely in the light of your enlightenment.

335
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,960
You can never do wrong.

336
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,360
But first of all, have that confidence within yourself

337
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,200
that whatever you have to do,

338
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,680
you are not going to enslave yourself to entrepreneurs,

339
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,760
what people have to say, how you will look,

340
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,400
how you will appear before.

341
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,800
This is a very important point

342
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,520
that half of the time we are laboring just to look like many others.

343
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,400
It’s very surprising

344
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,360
how these entrepreneurs have befooled the Western people.

345
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,440
In India it won’t work, won’t work –

346
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
specially the Indian women.

347
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,560
This “in-between” came, a mini sari,

348
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,440
came up to Bombay for about four-five days, I think, disappeared.

349
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,000
No Indian woman would wear a mini-sari, finished.

350
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,480
Nothing doing.

351
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,960
Any sort of fashion now, comes in India, doesn’t stay

352
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,000
because whatever clothes we have now in India -

353
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,760
is traditionally - has been there,

354
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,280
has been tested and error and trial and error and trial,

355
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,640
and we know now this is the best, now stop it.

356
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,000
At certain age you stop.

357
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,960
This is the style that suits us the best.

358
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,120
But anything goes on and the styles go on changing.

359
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,680
And this is what you have to be very careful to see

360
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,720
that you do not take to stupid things,

361
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,200
which are being created by entrepreneurs,

362
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,320
but to sensible things, which are required for you.

363
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,440
So one of the enslavement I feel, is

364
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,720
that you have to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

365
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,360
But a slavery is very deep and is so psychological;

366
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:16,240
in so many ways it is extremely hidden

367
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,960
and so subtle that you cannot make it out.

368
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,560
So, in the introspection you find out

369
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,040
what’s gone wrong with you,

370
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,160
how you are made this way.

371
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,400
“What’s wrong in my own personality –

372
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,040
it has come from all the surroundings

373
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,480
and the way people have been putting ideas into my head.”

374
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,400
You should have your own ideas.

375
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,240
You shouldn’t worry what Plato said

376
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,640
and what Socrates said and what this thing said.

377
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,880
What do you think?

378
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,920
After all, you are enlightened people.

379
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,640
But then there is another psychological thing,

380
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
which is even the worst.

381
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,680
And that “Mother, if we are very sure,

382
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,000
then we are putting up our ego.”

383
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,320
They are so much afraid of their ego

384
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,200
that as if after some time they’ll take off.

385
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,040
“The ego will bloat so much that we’ll take off.”

386
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,760
This is another fear people have, that if we assert,

387
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,640
“All right this is what I want, this is the right thing to do,

388
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,600
then I’ll get off so I don’t want to say such a thing;

389
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,400
I have an ego.”

390
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,760
So, with Sahaja Yoga also, certain fears have crawled in.

391
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,760
One of them is that “Mother, I should not have any ego.”

392
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,440
Now, what is the problem of ego?

393
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,360
That also surprising despite all fear and everything.

394
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,320
As a reaction to it people have developed

395
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,640
a kind of a protesting character.

396
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,800
But again these entrepreneurs have pampered your ego.

397
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,880
Like, in the morning you ask the child, “What will you have?”

398
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,680
Then child will say, “I’ll have this.”

399
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,960
The mother has to run and get it,

400
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,840
or she must keep everything in the fridge.

401
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,920
In India that’s not the case.

402
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,160
Whatever is cooked in the house, you better have.

403
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,200
If there is no salt, all right without salt, come along.

404
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,160
Otherwise don’t eat, doesn’t matter.

405
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,400
In any case you will eat.

406
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,000
So when the disciplining comes within yourself

407
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,560
and you understand this,

408
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,120
then you do not say, “I desire only this, I desire only this.”

409
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,480
What you desire, you tell yourself:

410
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,560
“All right, you’ll not have it for one month, let’s see.”

411
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,400
Once I must tell you about Myself that

412
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,400
little bit comfort grew upon Me, sometimes, I think.

413
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,680
So, we had, had a transfer,

414
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,320
and My family was not with Me at that time.

415
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,960
We had only one small little bed where My husband slept.

416
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,040
And I slept just on the bare cement on the earth,

417
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,440
and next day I started getting the pain in the body.

418
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,800
I said, “All right.” I slept on the cement for one month.

419
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,880
“On the cement you get pain? All right. Sleep now.

420
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,680
One month,” I said, “I’m going to sleep on the cement.”

421
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,800
Then cement lost its power on Me.

422
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,200
Then, might be the cement might be feeling the pain.

423
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,960
So, that’s what you have to do, is to master your mind.

424
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,120
Now the problem only will come:

425
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,960
"What is the discretion? - This ego will come up Mother.”

426
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,440
Because, your ego, as I said, is developed by reactions,

427
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,040
by protesting against things,

428
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,680
and also by the pampering of the entrepreneurs.

429
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,120
All right, whatever may be the reason,

430
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,880
we are not going to psychoanalyze ourselves.

431
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,960
But the fact is, also we have a ego problem.

432
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,000
Why?

433
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,520
I have already told you that, if a balloon is bloated many a times,

434
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,040
it can easily be bloated.

435
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,920
At the slightest air, it bloats.

436
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,320
And that’s why you are afraid that suddenly

437
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,360
my ego might become so big

438
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,480
that I may be like a balloon in the air, somewhere moving.”

439
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,560
But, how to get rid of this is to know that

440
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,240
you are an enlightened soul.

441
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Respect yourself.

442
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,160
Once you start respecting yourself,

443
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,320
you will not fall into any traps of ego.

444
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Very simple.

445
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,480
Respect yourself.

446
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,400
You have to say,

447
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,760
“I am a Sahaja yogi.

448
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,400
how can I behave like this?

449
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
After all, I am a Sahaja yogi.”

450
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,560
A kind of a dignity that develops,

451
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,680
and then you will start feeling shy

452
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
of doing something that is stupid,

453
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,760
because ego makes you stupid, that’s the point is, absolutely.

454
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,600
So now, if you develop this respect for yourself,

455
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,880
“I’m a Sahaja yogi,

456
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,160
so I can’t behave like this.

457
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,880
I’m a Sahaja yogi.”

458
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,120
If you say like that to yourself,

459
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,240
then you will be amazed

460
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,880
that the dignity of a Sahaja yogi

461
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,960
will definitely keep you down to earth.

462
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,720
You will not get into the trap of your ego.

463
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,200
So one side is the conditioning, another side is this ego.

464
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,640
Simple thing is ego.

465
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,280
That dignity has to be developed.

466
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,080
You’ll be surprised – among animals there are maryadas.

467
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,600
Like a tiger won’t behave like a snake

468
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,480
and snake won’t behave like a tiger.

469
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,120
So we are now Sahaja yogis.

470
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,160
We are tigers among human beings, we are lions among humans,

471
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,520
the highest; we are the highest human beings.

472
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,600
It’s not necessary to have ten, what you call,

473
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,760
medals on your body to show that you are something great

474
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,840
but you are Sahaja yogis, you are Mahayogis.

475
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,520
So, develop that

476
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
respect

477
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,960
and you will be surprised the humility

478
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,400
will immediately came into you,

479
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,520
I mean will walk into you, humility.

480
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,680
I have seen some Sahaja yogis sit like this,

481
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,360
sometimes sit like this,

482
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,800
sometimes they,

483
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,200
one, if the Left Vishuddhi is there, like this,

484
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,520
Right Vishuddhi is there, like this.

485
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,200
But then you see yourself.

486
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,240
Like a bridegroom has to dress up

487
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,760
and he remembers, “I am the bridegroom,

488
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,880
I cannot behave like other younger boys who will be there.

489
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:07,080
I have to have my own personality.

490
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,520
I am the bridegroom;

491
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,800
I am going for my wedding.

492
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,680
I cannot behave like all my other friends are there.”

493
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,640
You have to behave in a particular manner.

494
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,720
So assume this.

495
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,960
Still we do not know that we are Sahaja yogis.

496
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,720
Once we know we are Sahaja yogis,

497
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,560
that dignity will develop within us,

498
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,680
and with that dignity you’ll be amazed

499
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,680
you’ll also see what is wrong in your own country,

500
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,640
what is indignified.

501
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,720
Now with the whatever has happened in France,

502
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,960
you can find out what’s wrong with French laws.

503
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,480
But French are more interested in drinking and eating

504
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,680
and other things. So they never paid -

505
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,400
“Oh, let it be, what do we care for laws, let it be as it is,

506
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,880
doesn’t matter, who should bother about these things,

507
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,760
is nothing important.

508
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,040
After all, if you can get something to drink .…”

509
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,280
You go to any French village, at seven time,

510
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,840
you cannot meet anyone, even a drunkard.

511
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,960
They are sitting inside and drinking, drinking.

512
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,920
I mean that’s the main religion, main pastime.

513
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,160
Next day with a hangover they come,

514
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,200
so they see everything the other way round.

515
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,000
Like this fellow, these journalist who went to India,

516
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,400
they saw an iron gate

517
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,080
and they thought this was the iron curtain of Hitler.

518
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,720
Everything expanded, you know, so big,

519
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,720
crooked because hangover, you know.

520
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,680
So the whole life in the West like a hangover.

521
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,400
Either they see things too big or too small,

522
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,120
they don’t see things as they are.

523
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,160
Now most of these things are written, which you will read,

524
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,400
the psychology and all those things and the books,

525
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,720
mostly they are drunkards.

526
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,760
If you see their lives, they have been drunkards.

527
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,720
So whatever they have written,

528
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,000
why should we take them so seriously?

529
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,440
Except for very few who were realized souls,

530
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,840
most of them were drunkards.

531
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,680
Like those who wrote about Greek tragedies

532
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,680
must have been really drunkard people

533
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,520
In – they must be taking lot of things

534
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,920
inside and then must be writing something like that.

535
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,160
Because most of the drunkards,

536
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:56,160
when they write, they say that “Why, why should I live, I must die.”

537
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,120
And like that we too have in India

538
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,880
many people who have written ghazals who always say that

539
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,960
“Why should we live, we should die.”

540
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,320
So if there’s one poet who has said,

541
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,480
“Now you are talking of dying, why don’t you die once for all?”

542
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,080
So, you will realize that

543
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,760
what you will write,

544
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,680
what you will say is higher than all these people.

545
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,760
But Sahaja Yoga has worked so smoothly in you

546
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,040
that you do not know what you are.

547
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,400
Today, on Guru Puja, you are worshiping your Guru.

548
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,840
At the same time I bow to your guru within yourself.

549
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,880
Let your guru come up and show itself.

550
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,840
Specially the kind of a Guru you have –

551
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,360
I am not strict with you, I am very gentle.

552
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,080
Because, as I told you, fundamentally is a different thing

553
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,280
is that it is not for an individual, but it is for the collective.

554
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,600
And if something has to spread collectively,

555
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,760
then you have to understand

556
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,720
that it has to be only love that is going to work it.

557
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,600
There is no other way we can spread Sahaja Yoga

558
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,440
because we cannot be like Hitler giving wrong ideas of hatred.

559
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,160
Either it could be hatred or love.

560
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,880
You teach people we hate this one – fundamentalism,

561
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,160
this, that – you’ll get thousands ready to fight.

562
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,360
You can elevate their baser self and say,

563
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,920
“All right, come along, let us fight.”

564
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,120
Racialism, this, that, anything, even nationalism.

565
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,360
All right, they are people.

566
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,800
But when I say love, is very different.

567
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,360
Try to understand.

568
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,080
And because of our collective work, we have to know

569
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:23,600
that love is a source of energy

570
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,160
that makes things grow

571
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,800
in a living manner.

572
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,080
It is the energy which is a living energy.

573
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,120
Try to understand now. This is, people don’t understand.

574
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,920
Love doesn’t mean that you hug somebody or do something,

575
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,120
but living energy that understands,

576
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,200
that makes you grow.

577
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,320
I hope you have seen My books, and I hope you have read it.

578
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,360
In that I have described you to you very clearly

579
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,640
what is the living energy within us that works,

580
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,600
and anything that is working. For example see this flower.

581
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,760
Now, I cannot order this one to go straight.

582
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,880
It’s moving in its own way – let it be.

583
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:18,160
It looks nice because no flower should look like another flower.

584
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,680
Living energy never creates the same thing exactly than another.

585
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,400
Only plastics can be done.

586
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,240
Now, when it is growing, it is growing in its own way.

587
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,360
So whatever is built in within you, which is a living energy,

588
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,680
built in, but living energy, and a living thing that works –

589
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,760
it blossoms by itself.

590
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,920
The water of pure love is to be given.

591
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:57,320
In pure love what you see in another person, as a guru,

592
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,520
“What’s the matter with myself

593
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,880
where it is obstructing me to go further.”

594
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,240
In another person, as a guru, what you see

595
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,800
is how to handle this man, with love,

596
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,040
so that he comes closer to reality.

597
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,840
Is a very gentle process

598
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,960
is very loving process,

599
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,040
and nothing like really enjoying your love.

600
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,360
Just to know that I love so many people itself is so great.

601
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,720
And you too see feel that “I love so many.”

602
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,000
But it should be samadrishti – means:

603
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,240
With the same eyes you should see everyone.

604
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,560
You see everybody with the same eyes, isn’t it?

605
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,880
Only two eyes are there.

606
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,880
But, you see everyone with the same eyes – they are different.

607
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,960
All right, you see them as different.

608
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,240
But you do not … your eyes do not discriminate.

609
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,680
Your eyes do not see somebody black, somebody white,

610
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,040
somebody blue.

611
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,800
They see what they are.

612
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,520
When you start seeing with samadrishti, means the same eyes,

613
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,440
same sight,

614
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,680
not to change your ideas.

615
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,760
Because, what happens that your own mind twists it,

616
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,880
and you start seeing somebody as different, somebody as different.

617
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,520
Now, with the eyes I see the fan.

618
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,720
But supposing My mind is off, I might see as a human being.

619
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,080
So if you are a sane person,

620
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,040
then you will see everyone as they are.

621
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,840
This is samadrishti is that

622
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,680
you have the same eyes for everyone.

623
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,560
Do not get twisted, so that you cannot have:

624
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,160
somebody is your special friend,

625
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,720
somebody is number two friend, somebody as number ten friend

626
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,760
and some as your enemy.

627
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,760
Once you start looking at things like that,

628
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,200
everything will get into proper shapes.

629
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,440
Otherwise, one can go crazy.

630
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,720
Also, it should be samyak.

631
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,520
Samyak means “integrated”.

632
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,200
There should be an integrated knowledge.

633
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,240
Like the eyes when they see,

634
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,360
they see where you are sitting, where you are,

635
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,240
where is this person, where is that person,

636
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,880
what is the relationship.

637
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,000
So the knowledge about others

638
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,040
is in relationships with each other.

639
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,840
Now supposing there’s a gentleman who has a child,

640
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,320
and there’s a problem between that gentleman and the child.

641
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,760
To approach that person,

642
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,160
you must know that he has a child;

643
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:44,280
not to just make him separated from others, singularizing.

644
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,840
You take somebody, say, he is from, say from England

645
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,360
or he is from Italy.

646
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,080
Then try to understand him

647
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,680
that he is from that particular background

648
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,800
and that background is around him, so he is like that.

649
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,880
If you can have this kind of a full knowledge of others,

650
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,800
there will be no problems, no quarreling, nothing.

651
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,440
Otherwise there is a conflict all the time

652
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,760
and that’s how one feels very tired.

653
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,840
Eyes do not react; eyes just see;

654
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,120
whatever is there, they just see.

655
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,640
Eyes never react,

656
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,200
but the mind reacts.

657
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,320
And this reaction is the one which is responsible

658
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,760
for spoiling your attitude towards people.

659
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,400
So now,

660
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,680
you should have a witness state.

661
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,200
As Gyaneshwara said, “Niranjan pahane. –

662
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,640
Niranjan pahane”

663
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,920
To see somebody without any reaction.

664
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,720
Just to see and you’ll know everything about that person,

665
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,040
as soon as you see that person.

666
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,680
"Niranjan pahane”

667
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,680
Because, as long as your brain is there

668
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,120
you do not see that person as he is.

669
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,480
But as soon as you see that person,

670
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,000
you just know what it is.

671
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,760
And then, immediately you will know

672
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,280
his chakras, his kundalini, everything you’ll penetrate.

673
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,240
But your mind, which is loaded with nonsense,

674
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,200
will not allow you to go to that level.

675
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,240
So the niranjan pahane, the one where you just see something,

676
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:53,480
that kind of a eye we have to develop it.

677
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,560
So, with that a detachment starts,

678
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,000
automatically you do not criticize anybody

679
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,320
because your mind is like this against that person;

680
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,800
you do not love somebody because your mind thinks this way;

681
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,520
you too cannot form groups;

682
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,760
you cannot have some people who are dear to you, some are not.

683
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,000
Sometimes, if I do not smile at some people

684
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,600
then they grumble and say,

685
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,080
“This time Mother didn’t smile at me.”

686
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,200
I mean, I cannot keep all the time a smile, you see.

687
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,840
You must also think of My muscles.

688
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,200
All the time how can I keep My smile on, you know?

689
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,120
But there are people who feel very bad that

690
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,640
“You see, this time Mother didn’t smile.”

691
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,880
So I have to go on smiling all the time at every one.

692
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,800
I try.

693
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,520
So the

694
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,120
attitude towards others

695
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,480
has to be with niranjan

696
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
attitude, because it’s a collective work.

697
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,360
It’s not strict;

698
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,200
it is not in any way clamping anything

699
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,240
because it’s a living work,

700
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,560
absolutely it’s living, we cannot.

701
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,600
But it is definitely the work, which

702
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,440
creates harmony, love,

703
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,680
affection, feeling of oneness.

704
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,360
Imagine, to think about someone

705
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:09,320
who is not kind to you or he’s … is a horrible thing.

706
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,480
Better think how nice you could be to that person.

707
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,280
So the attitude should be that

708
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,360
how nice I am going to be with that person, you know.

709
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,360
See, somebody is angry with you,

710
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,160
is easy to fight, “Come along. You are angry, I am angry.”

711
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,640
No. Go and just tickle.

712
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,840
Simple thing like that,

713
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,040
and enjoy.

714
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,520
Because you cannot enjoy hatred;

715
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,880
you cannot enjoy rivalry;

716
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,400
you cannot enjoy separatedness.

717
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,120
Like this hand has to enjoy this hand,

718
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,480
in the same way you have to enjoy each other.

719
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,840
If you cannot enjoy then you have lost the point,

720
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,160
lost the point.

721
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,560
So, in the collective progress we have to know that we cannot

722
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,280
progress if we have no sense of collectivity,

723
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,720
that we are part and parcel of one person.

724
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,160
If I pull My one ear, it’s not that My ear will come out

725
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,800
but it will give pain to the whole body.

726
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,560
That’s why I say pull both is better.

727
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:50,080
And when you start, you see, seeing this way yourself,

728
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,720
then you’ll be amazed a kind of a sweet humor about yourself develops.

729
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:02,360
And you really become a very interesting, magnetic personality,

730
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,200
and a very enjoyable person, extremely enjoyable.

731
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,600
Everybody will seek your company.

732
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:19,960
This is what is the sign of your Guru Principle being enlightened.

733
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,720
Of course, they have said that you should get detachment;

734
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,600
you should not have any attachment to this and that and that and that.

735
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,760
This is all talking.

736
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,600
But actually, only introspection

737
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,440
and assumption

738
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,000
or, we can say,

739
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,640
the knowledge of your own depth,

740
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,920
itself, will give you that feeling.

741
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,200
If you have that knowledge that I am a Sahaja Yogi,

742
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,480
and my depth of divinity is so great.

743
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,080
That itself will be more than sufficient

744
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,120
for you to exist as the topmost guru.

745
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,160
Actually, I am no more a Guru, I was never a Guru –

746
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,360
I am a Mother; I am hopeless Guru.

747
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,200
Because, a Guru who cannot be strict is useless,

748
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,760
and I have to prepare Myself to say things, you know.

749
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,240
If there’s problem between two people,

750
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,800
and then if there’s some gap of time

751
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,520
when I have to say to them, then I start,

752
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,600
“How to become strict?” I tell Myself.

753
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,600
“Hah” spontaneously if something comes,

754
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,400
then I say, “Why are doing like this?” At the most. Spontaneously.

755
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:56,720
So, you have to develop this special style of guruship

756
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,640
within yourself, which is for the collective working.

757
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:05,480
Again, remember it is for the collective working.

758
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,480
So today, you worship your Guru Principle within yourself

759
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,320
when you are worshiping Me.

760
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,400
I would not say that you should try to follow Me,

761
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,920
because I am hopeless in many things.

762
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,280
Say, banking I don’t understand, money I don’t understand,

763
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,280
I mean there’s so many things I don’t know, really.

764
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,560
I am hopeless, law I don’t understand.

765
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,160
I mean, you should not be like Me, agreed.

766
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,760
But,

767
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,120
you should be able to say as I say that

768
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,400
“You see, I have these problems.”

769
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:56,360
But one thing for sure you must have

770
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,760
complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

771
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:06,600
or desire to know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

772
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,360
If that works out,

773
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:21,640
then you will swim into this ocean of knowledge,

774
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,920
like a jet.

775
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,240
And whatever you want,

776
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,880
whatever you want to know, you will know.

777
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,840
But there should be a desire to know.

778
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,440
Never get satisfied

779
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,160
that I know sufficiently enough about Sahaja Yoga, no never.

780
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,600
In all other things you can be satisfied.

781
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,320
But only on one thing, that's Sahaja Yoga, still,

782
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,760
I have to know through my brains,

783
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,480
and my heart

784
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,120
should have that knowledge.

785
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,360
It should be in my heart, not only in my brain.

786
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:08,400
I should know through my brain, it should be in my heart.

787
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,880
Like when you see a film, you see King Kong.

788
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,360
Then you know it’s King Kong,

789
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,840
all right, this is a film, doesn’t matter.

790
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,040
Normally our knowledge is like that.

791
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,320
But if you see Mr. King Kong standing here,

792
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,600
“Oh my God,

793
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,680
he’s already here.”

794
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,760
In the same way, when our knowledge is in the brain,

795
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,880
it is just like a film, is away from … it’s not in our heart.

796
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:51,120
But when it is heart, it acts, it works.

797
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,360
It doesn’t work through brain.

798
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,120
In the brain it just stays but in the heart it works.

799
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,480
And in the heart resides the spirit.

800
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,200
Is very simple, that

801
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,920
we are people

802
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:14,480
who are more living with our brains, not with our heart.

803
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,360
But know that we are in reality.

804
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,520
You see, King Kong is standing before us.

805
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,840
You are not seeing a film; it’s in reality.

806
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,400
And in reality,

807
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,360
the heart has to work, not the brain,

808
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,000
because reality is only through the heart,

809
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,520
not through the brain.

810
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,520
Once you understand this,

811
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,120
then you’ll open your heart, enlarge it,

812
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,200
“Now this is in my heart.”

813
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,760
So the whole thing will be so clear-cut in your head

814
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,240
you will know everything clearly.

815
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,040
What is to be done, how to react, how to work it out.

816
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,280
If you put all this knowledge of Sahaja Yoga into your heart –

817
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,520
first of all you’ll have to enlarge your heart

818
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,640
otherwise you can’t put this ocean –

819
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,560
and then you see, “This is Sahaj Yoga.”

820
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,800
To Me everything seems to be Sahaj Yoga,

821
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,200
buying this house, coming to this place,

822
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,880
all this is Sahaj Yoga. I can see clearly.

823
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,680
Anything that I see, I connect it to Sahaj Yoga immediately,

824
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,320
“This is Sahaja Yoga.”

825
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,000
Why this is so? This is because of Sahaj Yoga.

826
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,840
This is Sahaj Yoga.

827
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,560
So everywhere you start seeing Sahaja Yoga,

828
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,200
when your heart knows what your brain knows.

829
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,080
I have known people who know all the mantras very well,

830
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,240
everything very well and all that but in the heart.

831
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,720
So put it in the heart.

832
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,200
In Sahaja Yoga the guru is not

833
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,080
through his brain but through his heart.

834
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,440
May God bless you all.

835
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,200
For the Guru Puja

836
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,120
- Mother speaks HINDI -

837
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,080
first he’ll read it out.

838
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,800
You see now this Guru Gita business

839
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,440
I never gave it to anyone of you to read.

840
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,400
The reason is not that it’s not truth. They say it’s truth.

841
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,120
But

842
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,880
it was told by Shiva to Parvati, what is a guru.

843
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,320
But why I didn’t give you: because all these gurus

844
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,080
in the market they say, “All right, I am your guru

845
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,160
and this is Guru Gita.”

846
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,480
In the Guru Gita is written, give all your money,

847
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,680
all your belongings, all your self –

848
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,520
prana, mana, dana – your body, your mind,

849
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,120
everything to the guru and become a stupid fool;

850
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,880
so they give it to them.

851
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,560
That’s why I didn’t give it to you.

852
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,280
But today Rajesh – I’ve told him for the first time –

853
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,520
but that doesn’t mean that you should follow the way

854
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,880
it has been described by Shiva.

855
02:57:52,885 --> 02:57:56,516
I have to make an announcement today

856
02:57:56,716 --> 02:58:00,328
That we have already three of our leaders

857
02:58:00,528 --> 02:58:03,567
Dr. David Spirow

858
02:58:03,767 --> 02:58:08,012
then Gregoire de Kalbermatten,

859
02:58:08,707 --> 02:58:10,708
Guido

860
02:58:10,908 --> 02:58:18,784
and now today  I would like to appoint Rajeshwaha as one of them.

861
03:50:45,232 --> 03:50:49,778
Hello, please keep quiet. Please keep quiet.

862
03:50:49,978 --> 03:50:53,012
Nobody can hear anything. Just now...

863
03:50:53,212 --> 03:50:58,192
Just now you had such a big lecture from your Guru.

864
03:50:58,407 --> 03:51:03,373
Now will you please be dignified and keep quiet and don’t talk

865
03:51:03,962 --> 03:51:07,203
Please be seated. All of you.

866
03:51:07,404 --> 03:51:09,966
Please be seated!

867
03:51:10,211 --> 03:51:13,600
Those, who are bringing presents, please also please be seated

868
03:51:13,863 --> 03:51:17,507
One by one, please. Please.

869
05:02:46,825 --> 05:02:50,553
The Guru Puja is over now

870
05:02:51,029 --> 05:02:54,360
and we all have to depart.

871
05:02:59,087 --> 05:03:02,209
We decided to have more Pujas in this place

872
05:03:02,804 --> 05:03:05,894
because it is very

873
05:03:06,878 --> 05:03:09,294
lonely and nobody to disturb us

874
05:03:09,555 --> 05:03:12,842
and the people here are very nice

875
05:03:13,084 --> 05:03:16,363
and have been very kind to us.

876
05:03:17,831 --> 05:03:24,534
Moreover I think with my age I shouldn't also travel too much in Europe

877
05:03:24,734 --> 05:03:28,335
If possible I would like to have most of the Pujas here

878
05:03:28,535 --> 05:03:33,176
It is quite close to all the European countries at least.

879
05:03:33,381 --> 05:03:36,475
But America - of course I will go to America

880
05:03:36,675 --> 05:03:39,608
and all to South America.

881
05:03:39,815 --> 05:03:43,321
So the new program for me:

882
05:03:43,580 --> 05:03:45,930
My Qawwali goes on -

883
05:03:48,551 --> 05:03:55,379
for not only 24 hours, for the whole year, the life long.

884
05:03:57,178 --> 05:04:00,367
I must thank you all of you

885
05:04:00,644 --> 05:04:04,450
for coming here and

886
05:04:06,027 --> 05:04:09,816
living here under all kinds of circumstances.

887
05:04:10,016 --> 05:04:14,352
I hope next time - by next time, we  will have better arrangements made

888
05:04:14,567 --> 05:04:17,173
because there was hardly any time

889
05:04:17,373 --> 05:04:20,163
but very suitable for Guru Puja

890
05:04:21,524 --> 05:04:24,457
That we had to learn

891
05:04:24,663 --> 05:04:29,793
how to achieve the state of Guru.

892
05:04:31,545 --> 05:04:36,270
There are so many false people in this world now, you know that

893
05:04:36,502 --> 05:04:40,247
and as Babamama has said in the last

894
05:04:42,096 --> 05:04:44,647
Qawwali very beautifully

895
05:04:44,847 --> 05:04:51,253
That is the personality of a person makes

896
05:04:53,746 --> 05:04:56,889
the personality of the place.

897
05:04:57,139 --> 05:05:00,754
Like the roses are growing

898
05:05:01,056 --> 05:05:03,804
in the thorns

899
05:05:04,004 --> 05:05:06,673
but where the roses grow they don`'t say:

900
05:05:06,873 --> 05:05:09,464
"This is the place where the thorns are growing"

901
05:05:09,664 --> 05:05:12,347
but they say: "The roses are growing."

902
05:05:12,547 --> 05:05:16,360
So whatever maybe the conditions that I told you today

903
05:05:17,134 --> 05:05:21,503
to understand under what circumstances we are

904
05:05:22,261 --> 05:05:25,102
born and surrounded by

905
05:05:25,302 --> 05:05:28,469
and what psychological problems we arrived so far.

906
05:05:28,986 --> 05:05:32,064
Whatever it was, you have now

907
05:05:32,285 --> 05:05:35,661
to know that you have to enter into the Kingdom of God,

908
05:05:36,763 --> 05:05:42,015
where none of these bad things even

909
05:05:42,890 --> 05:05:44,865
can enter.

910
05:05:46,114 --> 05:05:48,308
and the enjoyment that we have had

911
05:05:48,508 --> 05:05:53,656
is absolute pure enjoyment of our Spirit dancing.

912
05:05:53,964 --> 05:05:59,359
I hope this time my lecture should not in any way depress you

913
05:06:00,287 --> 05:06:05,437
but on the contrary introspection is very good.

914
05:06:06,383 --> 05:06:09,482
Without that we can not understand

915
05:06:09,682 --> 05:06:13,367
there are so many things which I have discovered myself

916
05:06:13,567 --> 05:06:16,540
which are to be seen little

917
05:06:16,740 --> 05:06:20,988
carefully, why do we behave in such a manner.

918
05:06:21,188 --> 05:06:25,027
and I have tried to point it out to you, what our subtler

919
05:06:25,791 --> 05:06:28,467
badhas we have within ourselves.

920
05:06:28,667 --> 05:06:32,340
So please again and again you can listen to my tape

921
05:06:33,381 --> 05:06:36,167
and try to understand what I have said.

922
05:06:36,367 --> 05:06:42,270
I am sure next Guru Puja you all will be coming here as great gurus.

923
05:06:45,254 --> 05:06:47,485
All the best

924
05:06:47,685 --> 05:06:51,012
for - till the next Guru Puja I should say "All the best!"

925
05:06:51,212 --> 05:06:55,928
This year we all should work out to come out of the

926
05:06:57,000 --> 05:07:01,532
thoughts (thorns) and become the flower of fragrance,

927
05:07:01,732 --> 05:07:06,585
so that when people see us, they know now we have created here

928
05:07:06,785 --> 05:07:09,517
the World of God.

929
05:07:12,227 --> 05:07:15,610
There are obstacles, there are problems

930
05:07:15,810 --> 05:07:19,342
whenever there is truth there is always

931
05:07:19,542 --> 05:07:23,938
somebody to come on you, no doubt

932
05:07:24,138 --> 05:07:27,204
but truth will be successful,

933
05:07:27,404 --> 05:07:30,457
it will be victorious, be sure of that!

934
05:07:30,657 --> 05:07:33,764
With that surety, if you work it out

935
05:07:33,964 --> 05:07:35,951
it is all going

936
05:07:36,151 --> 05:07:38,391
to overcome all these little little hurdles,

937
05:07:38,591 --> 05:07:41,044
little little incidents that you have faced

938
05:07:41,244 --> 05:07:43,419
in a very beautiful manner.

939
05:07:43,645 --> 05:07:45,969
So never forget the enjoyment of tonight

940
05:07:46,169 --> 05:07:48,392
whenever you are depressed think of that

941
05:07:48,592 --> 05:07:52,542
and just start saying that we are not

942
05:07:52,759 --> 05:07:55,890
living our thorns, we are flowers

943
05:07:56,090 --> 05:08:00,261
we are roses. That's you are, you are more than that.

944
05:08:00,731 --> 05:08:06,689
You are more than that - the whole atmosphere is fragrant by your goodness.

945
05:08:06,892 --> 05:08:10,943
So keep to that and enjoy yourself.

946
05:08:11,185 --> 05:08:15,219
There is no place for depression for all of us.

947
05:08:15,564 --> 05:08:18,819
How many people have such joy in their lives

948
05:08:19,019 --> 05:08:22,636
to think about the memories of these beautiful nights

949
05:08:22,862 --> 05:08:27,829
that we have spent together enjoying ourselves and enjoying everybody else

950
05:08:28,103 --> 05:08:32,152
without thinking about race and all that, about...

951
05:08:32,354 --> 05:08:37,740
... The power of God's Love is going to completely help us

952
05:08:37,974 --> 05:08:42,684
I assure you, and I verily say to you

953
05:08:42,884 --> 05:08:48,763
that good will be victorious righteous will be victorious

954
05:08:48,974 --> 05:08:53,459
and we establish a new style of life

955
05:08:53,659 --> 05:08:56,624
where there is no hatered , there is no killing

956
05:08:56,826 --> 05:09:01,191
there is no jealousy but all love and love and love.

957
05:09:01,357 --> 05:09:03,751
May God bless you.
