1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:06,250
Today we have come here

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:12,208
to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,166
It's such a coincidence

4
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,458
that the Mother of Christ

5
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,166
came and stayed in Turkey.

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,333
Isn't it surprising

7
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,333
that She should come here

8
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:33,041
after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here.

9
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:37,959
I wonder if He also came with Her later on?

10
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,709
But they say then He went to Kashmir

11
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:42,834
and She was also there.

12
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:46,083
Quite possible, on their way

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,500
they might have gone there.

14
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:54,834
So we are here to worship Him.

15
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,250
According to Sahaja Yoga,

16
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,542
She was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi

17
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:15,834
and She's the one who sacrificed Her Son

18
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:21,250
for the sake of religion.

19
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:25,250
But unfortunately,

20
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,959
nobody understood Her value.

21
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,041
Nobody saw

22
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:37,375
that She was such a great spiritual personality.

23
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,125
Only through Sahaja Yoga

24
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,792
you can understand that She was

25
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,834
a very great personality

26
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:50,125
who gave birth to Christ.

27
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,959
It is very unfortunate

28
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,417
that She was not respected,

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,166
specially in the Islamic world.

30
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,083
Because of that,

31
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,458
the women in the Islamic culture have no place.

32
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:24,250
My experience is very sad about them.

33
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,750
We have started an organization

34
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,250
for the rehabilitation of women

35
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:36,417
who are destitutes and all of them

36
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,208
who have applied are Muslim ladies - very sad.

37
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,875
While Muhammed Sahib has said

38
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,959
that "you must look after your mother"

39
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,250
despite that all these women

40
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:56,750
some of them have eight children, ten children

41
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,792
- have come to this destitute home.

42
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,750
Of course, we have to give them place.

43
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:06,333
We have to look after them

44
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,667
because we don't believe in all these

45
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,750
small type of ideas about religion.

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,667
Most important is 'human' religion.

47
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,792
We have to combine all these religions together.

48
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,333
It's a terrible task

49
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,166
because Muslim won't respect Muslim.

50
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,625
Christians - Christians won't respect Hindus.

51
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:37,291
I mean it's a funny thing that's going on.

52
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,583
They all are for God

53
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,917
and for God's work and His love.

54
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,625
Despite that, there's no respect.

55
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:49,458
There's no love.

56
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,166
On the contrary, they're all quarrelling, fighting,

57
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,125
killing everywhere.

58
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,667
It's very sad

59
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,750
that in the name of religion and God,

60
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:08,333
people should become so cruel and so absurd.

61
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,792
This is the only solution-

62
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,959
is to give them Self Realization,

63
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:21,291
which is the Realization

64
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:27,291
was called as miraj in the Koran.

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,709
It's called as miraj.

66
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,250
But they have said that nobody can get miraj.

67
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,250
Muhammed-sahib got it, but nobody else

68
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:39,959
- like they have banned people

69
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,083
from getting Self Realization,

70
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,667
which is not true.

71
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:49,000
All human beings can get Self Realization.

72
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,166
Whether they are from Africa,

73
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,417
England, America, India, anywhere.

74
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,792
They all can get their miraj.

75
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:07,125
One should understand that no human being

76
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,959
is created in this world to fight,

77
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:11,875
to fight each other.

78
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,834
Even the animals don't fight.

79
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,625
Why should human beings fight

80
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,709
- that, too, in the name of religion.

81
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,542
In the name of God,

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,792
Christ came on this Earth

83
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,166
just to create oneness of religion,

84
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,959
but even the Christians, they only started fighting,

85
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,250
dominating others.

86
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,875
It's a big world of turmoil,

87
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,750
where everybody is fighting in the name of God

88
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,625
and in the name of religion.

89
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,291
So our religion is global,

90
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,709
is one religion.

91
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,583
We respect all the Deities,

92
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,125
all the Gods and Goddesses

93
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,625
- respect Them and worship Them.

94
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:08,291
We are not so stupid

95
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:12,834
not to understand that They are all one.

96
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,041
Also, after getting Realization,

97
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,625
you realize that all these exist

98
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:22,250
on our central nervous system.

99
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,250
They exist on our chakras.

100
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,083
They are not there

101
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,250
just because people have told us in history and all that,

102
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,333
but actually in that's a fact,

103
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,834
that all of them are there together,

104
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,417
working out the resurrection of the whole world.

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,250
So the greatest thing that Christ has done

106
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,542
is the resurrection part

107
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,875
and in this resurrection, He suffered a lot.

108
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,000
He had to go through lots of ordeals

109
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,500
and then His body itself was resurrected.

110
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,792
On the same lines, Sahaja Yoga is working out

111
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,750
- that you get your Realization

112
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,792
means your resurrection.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,125
All your wrong ideas disappear.

114
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,291
All your nonsense disappears

115
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,667
and nothing but love,

116
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,208
understanding comes in.

117
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,166
It was difficult, I know, in the beginning

118
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:31,000
to start this work in India or otherwise, also everywhere

119
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,625
I found people are so ignorant

120
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,333
and human beings hate each other.

121
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,500
With some excuse, ......... with

122
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,458
some sort of a - I don't know what ideas they have,

123
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,166
historical ideas, and they hate.

124
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,583
This hating in India has been there,

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,709
but also abroad, like Hitler came in.

126
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,500
Hitler came because he hated human beings.

127
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,834
He was a satanic force who incarnated

128
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,709
and did all kinds of horrible things.

129
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,875
The way he has killed people,

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,542
you can't imagine a human being can do that.

131
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,750
He killed children.

132
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:23,417
He killed grown-up people in the gas chambers and

133
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,792
- such a horrible thing.

134
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:27,959
When I went to Germany,

135
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,166
they wanted Me to see all that.

136
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:35,250
I said, "I can't see. I will not be able to see it."

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,625
But My husband went there

138
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,542
and when he came back, he was sick for seven days.

139
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:44,583
It's so sickening.

140
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,375
It's so inhuman to behave like that,

141
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,291
to kill people, under some circumstances,

142
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:56,458
under certain conceptions and wrong ideas.

143
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:01,959
I don't know what sort of idea this Hitler had

144
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,125
that he got after the Jews and started killing them.

145
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:11,291
All kinds of things have happened on this Earth,

146
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,375
all in the name of religion. This is the worst part of it.

147
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,250
Throughout, people have been killing

148
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:20,834
in the name of religion.

149
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,542
Religion teaches you to love,

150
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,709
to love God and love each other.

151
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,959
How can it teach you to hate and to kill?

152
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,000
I mean, it's very surprising, still going on.

153
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,041
This kind of a nonsense is still going on.

154
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,917
It's only Sahaja Yoga that can stop this nonsense

155
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:47,000
and it should because, after all,

156
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,792
we are all human beings.

157
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,166
For that, you have to have your resurrection,

158
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,083
as Christ had.

159
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,500
And this resurrection is possible on this Earth,

160
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,166
very easily now with Sahaja Yoga.

161
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,500
Muhammad-sahib has called it has miraj.

162
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,500
He's described it very well, very clearly.

163
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,917
But who wants that?

164
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,125
They don't want to have their miraj.

165
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,709
If somebody tries to work it out,

166
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,959
they get after that person, saying

167
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,208
that  "This is something ridiculous."

168
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,333
It's all wrong.

169
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,750
I mean this has happened with all of them.

170
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,500
All of them have suffered

171
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,834
because of the ignorance  of human beings - all of them.

172
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,250
And also with Me, they are criticizing and this and that.

173
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,000
But I am much more powerful,

174
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,291
because love is much more powerful than anything else.

175
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,625
And it's working out all over the world now,

176
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:59,333
everywhere people are realizing that this kind of a hatred,

177
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:03,667
this kind of a wrong idea about others

178
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,917
is absolutely dangerous.

179
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:14,000
And so, once large number of people know this,

180
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,166
I'm sure it will all finish off.

181
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,458
We have lots of incidents like that, even recently.

182
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,709
That just because you follow a particular religion,

183
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,250
people hate you.

184
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,667
I mean I can't understand.

185
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,792
You cannot explain why, why it is done,

186
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:41,875
but it's done and very wrong to hate any human being

187
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:46,750
in the name of God, who has created you.

188
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,417
They don't understand God and His love.

189
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:57,583
For example, Christ's life - just see it.

190
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,500
He was hardly thirty-three years of age

191
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:04,291
when He was crucified.

192
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,333
His mother had to suffer so much.

193
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:13,083
Why? Why did they crucify Him?

194
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,375
Because He was teaching about love.

195
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,875
None of them liked this idea of loving each other.

196
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,542
How can you help people if you don't love?

197
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:32,792
Under what premises do you help others?

198
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,792
Because you love,

199
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,834
that's why you want to enjoy others

200
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,709
and to understand.

201
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,250
Once you start loving others,

202
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:49,166
then this myth finishes off.

203
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:52,583
Supposing you are born as a Christian

204
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:55,125
or a Muslim or a Hindu, or whatever it is,

205
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,250
what makes you think that you are different from others?

206
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,333
You are born the same way.

207
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,917
You are conceived by your mother the same way.

208
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,291
You look the same way.

209
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,834
Your nose, eyes, everything is the same.

210
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,417
What makes you different?

211
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,667
I think it's something political about it,

212
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,041
something very mean

213
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:30,166
to separate people in the name of God and religion.

214
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,542
On the contrary, Sahaja Yoga is to

215
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,458
unite all the people in the name of God,

216
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,375
to make them one in the name of God.

217
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,875
Supposing there is somebody living,

218
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,250
say, in South Africa

219
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:53,041
or say, in a far-fetched place like Benin and all that

220
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,917
- has become a Sahaja Yogi.

221
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,792
There are thousands who have become Sahaja Yogis there.

222
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,291
They are all your bothers and sisters.

223
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,625
They're your own.

224
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,625
You go there and they will

225
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,709
treat you just like their own children, their own relations.

226
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,583
They will never think what religion you come from

227
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,583
or what sect you come from, nothing.

228
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,083
I was surprised the way they have love.

229
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,291
Actually, loving is an innate quality of human beings.

230
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,875
It's an innate quality. Every human being has been

231
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,875
given this treasure of loving, loving capacity.

232
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,792
But that capacity has become so much less,

233
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:45,333
so much minimum, that, with that capacity,

234
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:50,417
people fight and kill each other.

235
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:56,625
It's a greatest sin to kill people in the name of religion.

236
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:00,709
I don't know what - how they believe

237
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,875
that, by killing each other, we can go to heaven.

238
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,750
They will go to the worst hell.

239
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,375
This idea has now, of course, subsided a little,

240
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,709
but still existing.

241
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,291
They see it happening every day,

242
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:24,917
this kind of a nonsense, but still they are continuing with it.

243
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,250
Now what can we Sahaja Yogis do about it?

244
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,542
We should think.

245
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:34,041
Let us see, whatever religion we are born, that's what.

246
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,667
You have to be born in some religion.

247
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,041
You cannot drop from heaven.

248
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:45,959
So whatever religion you are born, you are not bound by that.

249
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:51,834
You are bound by the religion of love and joy.

250
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,750
And then you go on crying and weeping

251
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:02,917
and teaching and … of unhappiness, of fighting.

252
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,458
How can that be? We are human beings.

253
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,959
They are not animals.

254
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,041
Even the dogs don't do that way.

255
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,500
Why should we human beings kill each other

256
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:21,959
and make a miserable life for others and for yourself?

257
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,083
Because if you hate others,

258
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,041
you will also become hateful.

259
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:33,417
A will hate the B and then the B will hate the A,

260
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:36,959
so the whole human life and civilization

261
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,583
has nothing to do but to hate!

262
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,834
Sahaja Yoga is such a blessing to you, I must say,

263
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,709
because it has given to you all the Deities within you, enlightened

264
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,792
and now you know you are belong to the whole.

265
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,208
You know you are not belonging to some stupid ideas.

266
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,709
It's very remarkable when I came here.

267
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,250
I knew Mary lived here. I knew Mother Mary lived here.

268
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,625
There is a house of Mother Mary.

269
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:20,333
That gave Me a very great joy to know that She had lived here

270
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,375
and so I said we must worship Her.

271
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,500
After all, She was a mother of Christ!

272
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,625
Mother is a mother.

273
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,208
What does it matter whether She was a Christian, Hindu, Muslim?

274
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:35,750
It doesn't matter.

275
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,333
And for Her love, She allowed Her son to be sacrificed

276
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,291
for the whole world and for the universe - what a mother!

277
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,750
Can you find such a mother in this world

278
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:52,500
who will allow Her own son to be crucified -

279
00:17:55,208 --> 00:18:01,125
such a courageous, loving and global personality.

280
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,291
Here we are. It's a coincidence, as I said,

281
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,375
because She lived here.

282
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,125
Why did She come?

283
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,875
Why did She come here? She could have gone directly.

284
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:20,792
She came here and lived and we have a house of Her.

285
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,750
Now with this house only,

286
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:25,083
the Christians will start a cult.

287
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,709
They'll fight with the Muslims

288
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,500
and the Muslims will fight with the Christians.

289
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,875
Anything you do, they will fight.

290
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:39,333
That's the main character is to fight,

291
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:43,834
not to help others, not to help each other - no, not at all.

292
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,709
They're just trying to be very, very funny and nasty.

293
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:55,917
In India we have had so many nice people

294
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,250
who taught that we must love each other.

295
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,792
Despite that, in India people are fighting.

296
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,417
They have had so many Sufis in this country.

297
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,792
In the same way, in India also,

298
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:13,709
we have had very great saints, very great - everywhere.

299
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,959
Some of them were Muslims,

300
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,083
some of them were Hindus

301
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,333
and people sing their songs; everything's there.

302
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:27,667
But, they're worshipped separately

303
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,250
and people fight even in their names.

304
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,959
They want to find something to fight.

305
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,667
Real fighting cocks, I tell you they are.

306
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,583
They haven't got a human quality within them,

307
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:43,792
which is love, which is affection-

308
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,750
must enjoy your love for each other.

309
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:52,166
That's the thing they have lost their capacity to love.

310
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,542
What does it matter if somebody is born

311
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:59,208
in China or in India or anywhere?

312
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,333
He is a human being.

313
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,750
He, too, has the capacity to love

314
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,417
and you should also have capacity to love.

315
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,709
My experience is different.

316
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,083
I went to China with My husband.

317
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:17,959
In China

318
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,959
that time, they didn't have any good feelings for Indians,

319
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,125
I don't know why.

320
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,792
But they were so kind to Me, you won't believe,

321
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,542
so nice to Me

322
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,250
and the way they treated Me,

323
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,750
everybody was surprised, " What's the matter?  "

324
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,959
"How are they so kind to you? "

325
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,500
"In China they don't like Indians."

326
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,583
I said, "It's a myth. "

327
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:45,333
"I don't think I have seen that with the Chinese. "

328
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:52,125
"They're extremely, extremely kind and respectful to Me. "

329
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,291
"What have I done for them? Nothing."

330
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,417
Well, you'll be surprised, in one of the hotels,

331
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,834
one of My ankle ornament[s] had fallen down - silver.

332
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,667
It did happen and then I went away to a very far fetched place

333
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:17,250
and they sent it in an envelope, those anklets.

334
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:18,875
Can you imagine?

335
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,959
All the way - I was so much full of tears.

336
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,500
So I said "These Chinese are also very loving people,

337
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:31,542
extremely loving."

338
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,125
I went for My program.

339
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,709
We had a women's conference.

340
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,500
So I don't know why,

341
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,625
but at the airport only these Chinese boys arrived.

342
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:50,125
They took all My luggage. I was so late!

343
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:55,834
The function was at ten o'clock and I reached about 8:30.

344
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,083
They put Me in the car.

345
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,250
They put My luggage there

346
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,208
and they said, "We have to directly

347
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:05,000
go to the conference." I said, "All right."

348
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,875
I went there and in this short time,

349
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,250
these boys were really so attached to Me.

350
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,166
When I finished the conference, they're waiting outside

351
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:18,917
- can't believe it -

352
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,834
the same Chinese people who are against Indians.

353
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,208
And then, after that, it didn't stop.

354
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,667
They brought two cars -

355
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,709
one for My wheelchair, one for Me

356
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,458
- and they took Me to the best shopping places.

357
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,625
But I said, "What will you do?"

358
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,333
They said, 'We'll carry your wheelchair upstairs.

359
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,875
Can you imagine?

360
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,542
They were no relation of mine.

361
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,667
I've never seen them before.

362
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,500
So one of them said,

363
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:56,208
"Tomorrow, Mother, I won't be able to come." I said, "Why?"

364
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,291
He said, "I'm getting married tomorrow."

365
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:00,959
And I said, "What have you been doing all this day?"

366
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,166
He said, "I enjoyed your company so much"

367
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,959
I'm such an old woman like Me - young people.

368
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,333
"No, no, no, no, I've enjoyed.

369
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:14,083
I'll also bring my bride for You to be seen."

370
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,375
I tell you,

371
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,583
tears came into my eyes.

372
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,208
I said, "Such love, such kindness."

373
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,750
I didn't do anything for them, nothing.

374
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:26,208
I didn't give them any money, nothing.

375
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,500
My goodness, till the end they were so much attentive to Me

376
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:36,083
- very young boys, all below twenty-five years of age.

377
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,083
And they carried My Wheelchair

378
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,500
up three storeys with their hands.

379
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,667
I said, "Don't do it, I don't want …"

380
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,792
(They said,) "No, no, no, no, we want You to see."

381
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,458
"We want You to come."

382
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:51,625
I said, "Why?"

383
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,417
[They] said, "It would be nice for all of them."

384
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,208
I don't know what made them think like that.

385
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,250
Such enlightened people, I tell you.

386
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,709
With love, you get enlightened.

387
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,667
With love, you get understanding.

388
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,667
And such deep love exists within you.

389
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,291
Now the politicians will come

390
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,834
and tell you a story.

391
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,041
Then somebody else will tell you,

392
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,959
"Come and fight" and all that.

393
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,083
That's how they have managed in Germany, young people.

394
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:27,667
But now, now they're changing.

395
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,917
All this world has to change

396
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:33,333
because it has suffered a lot.

397
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,542
This is no religion.

398
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,291
This is not the teachings of the saints - no.

399
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,291
It is not.

400
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:46,291
It is devilish, that teaches you to hate others,

401
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,208
is the worst thing.

402
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:52,750
I mean all the enjoyment of love,

403
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:58,542
all the enjoyment of affection, you don't know.

404
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,750
Nowadays, you see the problem of the churches, this, that.

405
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,083
I can't understand, stupid people.

406
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,208
They have done so many laws

407
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,375
and with that laws, whatever it is, whatever may be the causes,

408
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:20,250
but what's happening is that poor children are suffering.

409
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,333
They have no sense of pure love.

410
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:29,333
Nobody understands what is poor love is.

411
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:33,041
Which is actually their innate quality, their innate -

412
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,667
I should say the 'property'.

413
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:41,375
But they don't know how you can love somebody purely!

414
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:48,166
It's all something very, very wretched.

415
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:51,208
It doesn't behove human beings to be like that.

416
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,542
Even the animals are not like that,

417
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:57,500
but human beings can go to any extreme.

418
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,959
The whole wealth of beauty,

419
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,417
the whole wealth of creativity,

420
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,250
the whole wealth of art, artistic temperament,

421
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,083
the whole wealth of enjoying life is finished.

422
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,250
If you are a fighting cock,

423
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:20,375
you can't see anything, any good in anyone, in anything.

424
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:23,000
They will fight others

425
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,875
and they'll fight among themselves also - is a fact.

426
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:29,208
They might say, "We must fight." All right,  fight.

427
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:32,750
But then they fight among themselves also.

428
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:36,750
They will torture their own brothers and sisters.

429
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:41,458
I mean, they don't love anyone. This is the main thing is.

430
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,667
Why take the name of religion?

431
00:26:44,834 --> 00:26:46,583
What the religion has done?

432
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,333
How could the religion teach you such a

433
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:52,917
horrible thing like hatred for your own?

434
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:58,750
It's not only among Christians, Hindus, Muslims, but

435
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:05,417
everywhere human beings have become very dirty and filthy.

436
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,083
They say it is Kali Yuga.

437
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,542
I can't understand.

438
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,750
How can you lose the power to love?

439
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,709
That's what Christ has talked about.

440
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,709
He's talked about love very clearly.

441
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,667
He said, "Love thy neighbour as thyself."

442
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,709
Have you found anyone like that?

443
00:27:29,458 --> 00:27:31,250
You don't find all such people.

444
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:36,500
The Christians who followed Christ, what did they do?

445
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,166
Muslims who followed Mohammed-sahib, what did they do?

446
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:45,750
And Hindus who followed Shri Rama, what did they do?

447
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,667
Are they anywhere near their leaders?

448
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:53,500
Are they anywhere near those Incarnations of the Divine?

449
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:54,709
Nowhere.

450
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,625
The reason is - I don't blame them

451
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,041
- because they had no Realization.

452
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,041
They didn't know their spirit.

453
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,375
If you have no Realization,

454
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,333
you cannot understand anything,

455
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:12,834
you cannot understand any enjoyment or anything.

456
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,542
I mean,

457
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,250
if you go to Germany,

458
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:22,959
you can't go and see all the things they have done.

459
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:27,125
You'll faint, if you have any human qualities.

460
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:30,417
Even you go to Japan

461
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,709
and they way they had put this Hiroshima,

462
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,208
this - my goodness,

463
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:39,583
I started trembling, I couldn't bear it.

464
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:43,333
I said,  "How could human beings be that cruel?"

465
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,542
Horrible!

466
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,583
I mean now the days have come that

467
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,291
they're killing their own children.

468
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,542
Extreme is this.

469
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,959
The other side of it is Sahaja Yoga,

470
00:28:56,792 --> 00:29:00,375
in which you love all human beings

471
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,041
because they're human beings.

472
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:07,750
They're born with you in this time.

473
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,500
You have to help each other

474
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,333
and love each other.

475
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,000
This is the main thing.

476
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,125
If you can develop this,

477
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,000
you'll be very, very strong Sahaja Yogis

478
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:23,959
and you will be supported and blessed by the Divine.

479
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,917
Divine will help you

480
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,709
and take you out of all troubles

481
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:33,875
and tribulations and all kinds of difficulties,

482
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:38,083
if you are a loving personality.

483
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:41,375
This is what the blessing of Kali Yuga.

484
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,792
It didn't exist (like this before.)

485
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:47,583
Now, if you are a loving person,

486
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,583
the Divine will go out of the way to help you,

487
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,166
to sort out your problems,

488
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,750
to punish those who are troubling you.

489
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,417
I mean, it's My own experience like that.

490
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,834
I never do anything. I never curse anybody.

491
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,500
I don't fight. I don't shout.

492
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,041
Automatically, it works.

493
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:11,291
I don't even tell the Divine to do anything.

494
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,875
The Divine is at the greatest, just personality,

495
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:22,542
I should say. That is the one who does all the justice.

496
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:28,542
Nobody can suffer under the guidance and love of Divine,

497
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:29,750
take it from Me.

498
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,291
This is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

499
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,709
I agree Kali Yuga is horrible.

500
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,458
People are horrible. This is that.

501
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,041
But there's one thing

502
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:45,875
that this Divine has become very alert.

503
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,500
It was never that alert.

504
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,500
If Christ was born at this time,

505
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,583
He could not have been crucified.

506
00:30:55,792 --> 00:31:00,083
It's only because He was not born during Kali Yuga.

507
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,208
That's a very big blessing for us.

508
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,291
Nobody can be tortured.

509
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,917
Nobody can be troubled.

510
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:12,375
Only thing, you have to be a humble person.

511
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,417
You have to have a good character

512
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:20,583
and you have to have a very loving personality.

513
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,083
That's all.

514
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,625
You'll enjoy the loving personality.

515
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,291
You'll get the blessings

516
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,667
because [of] you're loving personality.

517
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,583
I mean, the way the Divine looks after you,

518
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,542
there are so many miracles people tell Me.

519
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,125
I'm not surprised because I know

520
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:41,625
the Divine has become extremely alert

521
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:45,458
towards human beings who are good and nice.

522
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,166
It will look after.

523
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,709
It will support. It will do everything.

524
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:54,542
It's very surprising that it has become so alert.

525
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,375
Like Muahmmed-sahib suffered so much.

526
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:01,083
Everybody suffered so much, but not now.

527
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:03,208
Now the Sahaja Yogis won't suffer.

528
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,709
Take it from Me.

529
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:08,500
They're looked after by the Divine itself.

530
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:11,750
Everything is looked after. I will tell you,

531
00:32:11,917 --> 00:32:15,083
people have written letters after letters all over the world,

532
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,166
how they have been supported,

533
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,417
how they have been helped.

534
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:24,041
Very surprising how they have been rescued.

535
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:32,917
So we have to trust in ourselves

536
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:37,208
and we have to really love people.

537
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,834
We should be humble and love.

538
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:45,333
All this love will help you all your life.

539
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,750
This is the message of Christ.

540
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,542
Christ has said, "Forgive them."

541
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,166
How lovingly He said,

542
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:56,208
"But they don't know what they're doing."

543
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,166
Very lovingly He pleads

544
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:02,208
for all the bad people who crucified Him,

545
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,542
that "Oh, Lord, please forgive them

546
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,208
because they don't know what they are doing."

547
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:11,083
Can you imagine such a loving character of Christ?

548
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:17,625
And now, when we are celebrating and worshipping Him,

549
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,625
we have to worship that character within us,

550
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,083
that we are also loving people.

551
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:24,583
We love each other.

552
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:28,542
All over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis love each other.

553
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,834
Of course, there could be one or two who are not so good,

554
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:36,041
but mostly, ninety-nine percent Sahaja Yogis love each other.

555
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:39,375
My blessings to you is this -

556
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:44,250
on this day may God give you lots of love,

557
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:48,041
and loving capacity within you,

558
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,333
that you should have,

559
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:53,250
which will change your life completely

560
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,709
and you'll become such a powerful personality,

561
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:59,834
very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

562
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:04,208
You can do marvels and miracles

563
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:09,208
if you have developed the understanding of love.

564
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:12,208
May God bless you
