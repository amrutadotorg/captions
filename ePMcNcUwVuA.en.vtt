00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:24.949
I would like to have some questions from you
about it.

00:39:24.939 --> 00:39:28.179
And then we’ll see how it works out.

00:39:28.179 --> 00:39:29.719
All right?

00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:34.788
And not to be afraid, there’s nothing to
have any fear about kundalini.

00:39:34.788 --> 00:39:38.538
Because you must have read such big, big books
saying that kundalini burns you, kundalini

00:39:38.538 --> 00:39:39.538
does this.

00:39:39.538 --> 00:39:41.108
No she is your own mother.

00:39:41.108 --> 00:39:42.348
She doesn’t do anything of the kind.

00:39:42.348 --> 00:39:45.319
These are the people who have never known
what kundalini is.

00:39:45.319 --> 00:39:54.999
It’s like somebody putting the fingers into
the plug and saying electricity burns you.

00:39:54.999 --> 00:40:04.619
They are unauthorized people who have done
all this, and that’s how they have suffered.

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:09.708
So any questions please?

00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:19.048
Can’t think; if the kundalini rises above
this you become thoughtless just can’t think.

00:40:19.048 --> 00:40:22.539
And when she gets out from here you start
feeling the cool breeze from your head.

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:25.578
Really a cool breeze you feel it and from
your fingers.

00:40:25.652 --> 00:40:27.518
As simple as that

00:40:27.569 --> 00:40:29.828
You are still doubting something.

00:40:29.868 --> 00:40:31.238
Ask a question.

00:40:32.658 --> 00:40:34.105
Can’t hear.

00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:35.398
Loudly.

00:40:37.658 --> 00:40:39.515
Come, come, come here.

00:40:39.579 --> 00:40:40.818
Come

00:40:45.258 --> 00:40:47.729
(Lady inaudible)

00:40:58.576 --> 00:41:03.783
All right All right May God bless you sit.

00:41:03.796 --> 00:41:07.083
She is saying that have you to pray to kundalini?

00:41:07.149 --> 00:41:10.620
No nothing you don’t have to.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:19.119
You see prayer before realization has no meaning
it’s like telephoning without connection.

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:27.009
There’s nothing to pray nothing to pray
nothing to pray.

00:41:27.009 --> 00:41:36.300
(Lady inaudible) Can you come here?

00:41:36.300 --> 00:42:05.540
(Man: I think everybody has got a question
to ask but they don’t know how to ask you)

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.140
They don’t want to?

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.840
What, What Questions?

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.350
Ask now What is there?

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.430
What is you don’t know?

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.280
I know English at least so ask me any question
in English.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.480
Now what did you say?

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.480
(Lady)

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.670
Oh very good question.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.230
That’s a good question.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.780
That’s a good one.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.260
Yes sit down sit down sit down.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:43.320
She asked me a question if it is awakened
can it die out?

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.360
It doesn’t.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:49.150
Once it is awakened it goes up it opens out.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.190
But, but is there.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:58.662
At the first shot you see it goes really in
a big way you get it in a really big way.

00:42:58.662 --> 00:42:59.662
You remember.

00:42:59.662 --> 00:43:06.810
But then it goes back and looks after other
parts where there’s a problem so the force

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:07.860
is reduced.

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:17.520
But then you have to learn how to keep the
force there and how to raise it and this is

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.740
called as vidya, called as the knowledge.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.930
How to raise the kundalini….

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:29.440
Side B: ….What is all this about?

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.340
So that part you have to know.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.000
I am here to decode it.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.720
Somebody come and told me, Mother I feel here
tickling, all the time tickling, I said this

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.189
centre is not all right you have to open this
centre.

00:43:43.189 --> 00:43:48.170
Now how to open this centre then I had to
tell that person you have to do this very

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.170
simple method.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:52.920
You see certain movements, because it is flowing
from your hands, certain movements how to

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.600
do it, which are the deities on different
centers if you come to know about it.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.470
For example this centre is the centre of Christ.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:05.910
Between the optic chiasm is placed a very
subtle centre of Christ.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:09.730
In the Indian scriptures He is called as Maha
Vishnu.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:14.899
Now He was born on this earth to suck the
ego and superego.

00:44:14.899 --> 00:44:21.429
His crucifixion was there to suck our sins
means the ego and the superego.

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:22.990
But He is to be awakened.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:29.730
Unless and until He’s awakened it cannot
happen you go to church or you pray to Him

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:30.730
nothing will happen.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:35.980
But if kundalini goes and stops there, and
if you say Lord’s Prayer, it will rise.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:40.390
Is the proof that it is Christ’s centre.

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:47.619
Now this very important point that He should
be awakened that Christ was for this was never

00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:49.769
known to Christians.

00:44:49.769 --> 00:44:52.190
It’s a living process.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.700
He said I’m a living God.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:45:02.010
And when they went to India the way they talked
about Christianity was something absurd.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:06.399
So Hindus still believe that this one who
has to redeem us has to come.

00:45:06.399 --> 00:45:11.100
They don’t know that He’s already born
and crucified and He’s the one.

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:15.820
He is Maha Vishnu who is described in Devi
Mahatmyam very, very clearly.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.339
He was specially made.

00:45:18.339 --> 00:45:22.790
Who was His father; who was His mother all
described.

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:28.869
But the people who know English have no repor
with our ancient scriptures and those who

00:45:28.869 --> 00:45:35.029
went from here have no repor with Christ.

00:45:35.029 --> 00:45:37.050
That He’s to be awakened within us.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.529
He said I am to be born.

00:45:39.529 --> 00:45:45.959
And how to awaken it nobody knew only through
kundalini you can do it.

00:45:45.959 --> 00:45:51.190
He said, it’s said in the bible I’ll appear
before you like tongues of flames.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:53.149
Now what are these tongues of flames?

00:45:53.149 --> 00:45:58.139
Go and ask these people.

00:45:58.139 --> 00:46:01.510
These Jews do they know?

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:09.200
Mohammed has very clearly said that you are
to become a peer; you have to be born again.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:17.579
I mean namas is one of the very good ways
of raising the kundalini, if you are using

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:19.600
the Sahaja Yoga method.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.520
Means you get your realization and then you
do namas.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.430
You’ll be amazed.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:28.510
Everything has a meaning only when it is a
living thing.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:29.919
Otherwise it’s dummy.

00:46:29.919 --> 00:46:32.470
Everything is a dummy stuff you see like this
is a dummy thing.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:36.989
I shout at it or do whatever you like its
not going to work.

00:46:36.989 --> 00:46:44.220
That’s why everything is a dummy and that’s
why people say oh Christianity is wrong.

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:48.079
If you go to the Muslims they will say the
Jews are wrong.

00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:51.180
The Jews will say the Muslims are wrong, the
Hindus are wrong.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.580
I mean they are all blaming each other.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.890
If you have to learn about yourself better
go to the other party.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:01.470
But they are all dummies.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:06.579
Once you get realized you will know they are
all connected with each other absolutely one

00:47:06.579 --> 00:47:09.260
there’s complete harmony and concord.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:13.019
Christ Himself has said those who are not
against Me are with Me.

00:47:13.019 --> 00:47:19.380
Now go and ask these priests who are those
who are not against Him; who are with Him.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:26.829
I mean, He was not even given sufficient time
only for four years He could talk and He was

00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:27.829
killed.

00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:32.889
Everywhere they have done a nice pickling
up of all these great people.

00:47:32.889 --> 00:47:45.660
But Sahaja Yoga completely exposes their advents,
their purpose, their places within us and

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:51.740
also establishes all the fundamental things
that are described in all the scriptures and

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:53.709
their core relationships.

00:47:53.709 --> 00:47:58.040
It’s such a fantastic thing.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.230
How it establishes?

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:01.320
By proving it.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.400
I’ll tell you one example, a simple example.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.901
There was a gentleman from Iran he was a doctor
he came to see me.

00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:11.960
I mean it is now we cannot contact him because
he’s in Iran.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.620
But he came to see me he was a Muslim.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:20.140
And I told him that Mohammed Sahib was born
as Nanak Sahib in India.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.140
He could not believe it.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.140
He said how can it be?

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:27.500
Though Nanak Sahib had said it in a way, because
Nanak Sahib was sleeping and somebody told

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:31.760
Him that you are placing your feet towards
Mecca he said all right I’ll turn my feet

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.880
to other side and the Mecca came that side.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.930
He said I can’t believe it’ I can’t
believe it.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:42.400
I said but Mohammed Sahib Has said that He
is the last.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:48.310
I said I’m not sure of that but maybe He
must have decided to come back the way people

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.310
are.

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:50.310
He could not believe it.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:58.870
And he had stomach cancer, which is caused
by one of the reasons is fanaticism.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.090
I told him you have to believe in Him.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:07.240
He was one of the incarnations of the Primordial
Master and He was the same Abraham was the

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.260
same Moses was the same Socrates was the same.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.570
And you have to believe it.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:12.890
He said I can’t believe it.

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:14.210
I said I can’t cure you.

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:16.180
Then he went back and he was very sick.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:20.690
His wife said now what is there after all,
you see, we became Muslims because our parents

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:23.180
were Muslims and they told us Mohammed Sahib
was the last.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.900
After all you are to be saved.

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:30.650
Then he came and said all right Mother whatever
you say I’m going to say.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:33.890
I said now you pray to Nanak Sahib instead
of Mohammed Sahib because it is Mohammed Sahib

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:36.380
who’s angry with you.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:40.120
He got cured; he’s still living.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.120
He got cured.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.120
It’s so simple.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.120
We can’t believe it; it is so fantastic.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.010
It is worth seeing yourself with your own
eyes.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:52.420
The other day only, in Scotland, there was
a Gentleman was suffering from terrible, terrible

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.420
arthritis.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:58.060
He got completely cured and he came to see
me in Edinburgh.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:04.870
Arthritis absolutely curable; Diabetes is
absolutely curable; paralysis is absolutely

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:05.870
curable.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.620
These all come out of your imbalances.

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:15.500
If you want to treat a tree and if you just
treat a flower or a leaf you cannot treat

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.500
the tree.

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.110
You have to go through the sap.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:23.120
Sahaja Yoga is a system by which you go through
the sap of a personality and treat the whole

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.360
body as a whole.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:31.281
Because the whole is the one, which is to
be looked after and not a part of it, because

00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:33.940
you are a part of the whole.

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:39.440
And once you get connected with the whole
that whole that primordial being looks after

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.870
you.

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:46.180
And this is what has exactly happened to us
that we are all separated from the whole and

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:51.230
we have to become one with that with all our
awareness and understanding; so that that

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.430
whole looks after us.

00:50:55.430 --> 00:51:01.780
So coming back to your question about kundalini
that it falls off is a true thing with some

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.540
people it does go down.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:06.650
But all the forces that are divine are looking
after you.

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:13.290
You have to little bit cooperate with your
kundalini and she comes up she makes you beautiful,

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:18.840
absolutely beautiful.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.100
Now any more questions?

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:24.700
Man: Could you explain what exactly you have
to do?

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.870
That’s the exact point.

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.330
You don’t have to do anything.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:32.120
You see I have to do something about it not
you.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.970
In the beginning then you can do it.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:36.650
Like this light is here all right?

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:37.690
This is enlightened.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:43.040
Now there’s another candle, which is not
enlightened that candle has to sit straight

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.190
just keep the wick out that’s all.

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:51.040
And this candle has to just go near that and
that gets enlightened.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.211
I mean, I’m not doing anything about it
that also I must say because sometimes the

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:56.360
ego gets challenged; you know somebody says,
why Mother you?

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.900
I said you better do it.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:03.780
I’ll be very happy to be replaced.

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:07.651
If you can come and do it, nothing like it.

00:52:07.651 --> 00:52:08.651
You see it’ll be such a change.

00:52:08.651 --> 00:52:09.651
But what can I do?

00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:12.900
I have to do it.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:19.270
Otherwise I’m a happily married woman; I
have my children, grandchildren, everyone

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.800
there, I have no problems.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:28.000
But I see your problems, and I see that spirit
in you, and I just feel in all my love and

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.100
compassion that you must know it; that’s
all.

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.500
And once you know it you can do it yourself.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.170
Like one light can enlighten many.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:38.170
Isn’t it?

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:39.270
It’s as simple.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:40.530
You become that.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.070
You don’t have to do anything about it;
you have to just put your fingers like this

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:44.960
and the power flows into you.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.030
It’s that simple.

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:50.090
You won’t believe but it is so because you
are ready.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:52.750
You are just ready to be enlightened.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:57.850
Now this instrument is made, if it is not
put to the mains what’s the use?

00:52:57.850 --> 00:52:58.850
But how do you put to the mains?

00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:01.120
Just put to the mains, that’s all.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.690
The mains are there and this is ready you
just put to the mains.

00:53:03.690 --> 00:53:04.690
You are just there.

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:10.690
Like a television set to a villager if you
tell, he won’t believe that it is so fantastic.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:13.430
That there are all things around you; he will
say I can’t see anything.

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:14.490
How can he believe it?

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:18.520
When you put to the mains and you start seeing
the television manifesting, which is so fantastic.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.870
In the same way, you are a special instrument
created by God.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:25.490
You are just put to the mains.

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:27.050
You don’t have to do anything.

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:28.770
What did you do for your evolution?

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:33.520
When we became human beings from a monkey
what did we do?

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:39.830
Nothing, we did not cut our tail or anything
it just dropped off.

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.880
In the same way, we don’t do anything for
this also; it’s just there; you are just

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.000
ready; you just get it like that.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.540
You don’t know how fantastic you are.

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.570
You don’t know that, na?

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:48.700
I know that.

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.210
But you will also know very soon.

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:54.130
When you know you will be amazed how fantastic
you are within.

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:58.590
It’s said all ways, all the scriptures,
all the great people have described you as

00:53:58.590 --> 00:53:59.590
very great.

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:02.000
All of them have described.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.390
But you must have faith in yourself that you
are great, no doubt.

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.650
And that instrument is ready, just ready.

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:11.520
It is to be applied to the mains and once
you start manifesting you can give it to others.

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.980
It’s that simple.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:18.190
You can’t believe it I know, but it is so,
you will see that very soon.

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.080
Do not doubt it too much all right?

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.390
Otherwise this brain will be working khat
khat khat.

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:30.010
That’s why I’ve said for a while you should
stop thinking about it then it will work out.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:33.900
Because I’ve seen people who go on doubting
very much they take time.

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:42.390
Just open, open out yourself, you must open
yourself fully and it will work out.

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.620
After all you want to have your realization
isn’t it?

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.240
What else you want?

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.790
You don’t want to doubt for doubting sake.

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:51.950
What’s the use of doubting also?

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:54.800
I mean if there is supposing I say there’s
a diamond here.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:59.640
You will all run not only you but people from
Australia will come if I say it is free available.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.210
Don’t you think so?

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:07.830
They will say worth going by plane, if there’s
such a big diamond available.

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:08.900
So no use doubting.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:09.900
Just have it.

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.200
You have a diamond in your heart.

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:16.110
No doubt it will spark.

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.320
Do not doubt.

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.790
This mind has been doubting all the time,
what has it given you?

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:25.600
Nothing it will give you problems and headaches.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:33.920
Don’t be doubting Thomas’s; be trusting.

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:39.540
Come here; come.

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:49.970
Lady: do you find people’s problems stop
them getting realization?

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:55.000
Problems it stops a little sometimes little
bit.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.990
But I know all the permutations, combinations
now.

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:02.630
So I can get over all the problems; I think
so.

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.310
All right?

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:07.050
I know many permutations and combinations
now of problems.

00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:13.450
In the beginning you’ll be amazed in this
England I came here when my husband got elected

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:14.590
to this job.

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:21.150
For four years I worked on six people, for
four years, can you imagine?

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.540
And now they just get it like that.

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:27.830
Now I know all the permutations, combinations
of English people and England and western

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:28.830
people.

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:33.749
Now I’m going to America and I’ve been
there before also; so keep your fingers crossed;

00:56:33.749 --> 00:56:37.870
I’m sure I’ll work it out there also.

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:41.230
Everybody’s an interesting sample of some
combination.

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:46.210
But I know all the keys somehow; I’ve studied
it and I’ve put all attention to it.

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:51.270
It has worked out and all these problems I
know what you all have.

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:54.370
Somehow it works out so don’t you worry
about that.

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:57.950
If there were no problems, there was no need
to do this.

00:56:57.950 --> 00:57:00.159
I mean you would be just there.

00:57:00.159 --> 00:57:04.070
There has to be problems.

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:10.070
Any other problem?

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:20.320
Man: We’ve got seven chakras over there;
can you please tell us what part each one

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.320
plays?

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320
That’s good.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.820
Now all that is so elaborate I may not be
able to tell you today; but can you come and

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:26.820
show?

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.180
But I will be able to say in short, all right?

00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:33.919
Now he is coming; he will show you.

00:57:33.919 --> 00:57:46.320
Now the first chakra which is below the kundalini
the first one is the very important centre,

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:55.270
which is bestowed by a deity, which is the
embodiment of innocence.

00:57:55.270 --> 00:58:00.210
Is the centre of innocence, the first chakra.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:06.629
To explain it more we can say when we were
at the carbon stage, carbon stage.

00:58:06.629 --> 00:58:10.610
Now Carbon is a very important element, you
know that.

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:16.900
In the periodical laws it is placed in the
centre; it is tetravalent means it has four

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:20.010
hands either it can give four hands or take
four hands.

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:25.659
And at that stage only the nature started
producing life.

00:58:25.659 --> 00:58:28.980
So that is the stage where we were at carbon
level.

00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:34.220
And nature is innocent a chair doesn’t get
angry with you.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.380
Its only we can get angry.

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:43.509
So the nature that we are, is innocent our
basis is innocence.

00:58:43.509 --> 00:58:45.889
We are surrounded first by innocence.

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:48.630
We are basically innocent people.

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:51.560
So this is the first centre, is of innocence.

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.739
Then the second centre that you see.

00:58:54.739 --> 00:58:56.680
Actually the Nabhi we can take it.

00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.379
Is the second centre and the third centre
are connected.

00:59:00.379 --> 00:59:04.960
From the second centre arises the third centre.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:13.769
The second centre is the centre of our seeking.

00:59:13.769 --> 00:59:16.980
This one manifests our solar plexus.

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:21.570
And this caters to our seeking.

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:28.129
As amoeba we were seeking our food through
our stomach; it is in the stomach we can say.

00:59:28.129 --> 00:59:32.190
Actually they are all placed in the medulla
oblongata; they are placed in the spinal chord.

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:34.860
But they manifest outside the plexuses.

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:43.659
For example, the first one manifests the plexus
called as pelvic plexus, which is responsible

00:59:43.659 --> 00:59:45.680
for our excretory functions.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:46.710
All right?

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:52.609
Now the second one, which is the one I told
you just now, manifests the solar plexus,

00:59:52.609 --> 00:59:54.350
is for our seeking.

00:59:54.350 --> 01:00:00.529
And now you are at a stage where you are seeking
the ultimate the beyond.

01:00:00.529 --> 01:00:04.820
But there are people who are still seeking
money, there are people who are still seeking

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.580
other things.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:12.180
But I take if for granted that you are seeking
divine.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.889
So the seeking reaches that state at that
centre.

01:00:15.889 --> 01:00:20.669
The other centre that comes out of it is the
centre of action.

01:00:20.669 --> 01:00:23.800
The seeking has to put into action.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.159
Otherwise supposing you are hungry you have
to go into action to get it.

01:00:27.159 --> 01:00:34.149
So this is the centre of action within us,
which works within us all the activities for

01:00:34.149 --> 01:00:35.149
the future.

01:00:35.149 --> 01:00:46.359
It thinks and all the activities that we require
for our mental or our physical needs.

01:00:46.359 --> 01:00:49.430
So this is a center of the creator.

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:57.639
The above centre to that is the centre which
is the centre of Heart as we call it.

01:00:57.639 --> 01:01:02.490
Is the centre which represents your sense
of security.

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:10.580
When the child is about twelve years of age
this centre creates anti bodies in your sternum

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:16.100
bone and these antibodies by the time the
child is about twelve years of age go into

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:23.630
the whole body and they are the ones who react
to any invasion on the body.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:31.039
And these antibodies react; say for example,
all our injection system works on that.

01:01:31.039 --> 01:01:38.129
We put a little virus, which is an outsider
invader inside the body and when you put that

01:01:38.129 --> 01:01:40.380
they get energetic to fight.

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:44.289
And because of their energies they fight the
disease and we get cured.

01:01:44.289 --> 01:01:46.619
This is the principle of that is.

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:49.680
This is the center of our sense of security.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:56.529
When we are insecure then this centre starts
pulsating and emitting more antibodies and

01:01:56.529 --> 01:01:57.529
looking after us.

01:01:57.529 --> 01:01:59.789
And this is a very important centre within
us.

01:01:59.789 --> 01:02:04.550
But there are other two other centers on sides
of it; one is of the mother, one of the father;

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:05.550
on both sides.

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:07.870
I mean they have sub centers also.

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:11.749
Now this one can be called as the one which
manifests cardiac plexus.

01:02:11.749 --> 01:02:19.050
Then above that is the centre which is behind
here, is the centre of our collectivity.

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:22.759
Is the centre where we become one with the
whole.

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:26.100
Is the centre which gives us the idea that
we are one.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:31.970
By this centre we become also the witness
of the play of the divine later on when it

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:32.970
is enlightened.

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:37.970
It is a very important centre by which we
talk to others, we communicate to others on

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:39.239
the right hand side.

01:02:39.239 --> 01:02:45.550
On the left hand side emotionally we become
attached to people.

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:52.090
Then above that is the centre as I told you
of Christ or we can say the centre of ascent.

01:02:52.090 --> 01:03:00.129
There is the door, which goes into this area
of limbic area, which is grossly known as

01:03:00.129 --> 01:03:02.279
limbic area, which is the kingdom of God.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:06.840
And above is the last one here where this
point.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.220
The whole thing is one centre the limbic area
and this point.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:15.050
When the ego and superego are sucked in, the
kundalini rushes through, and this fontanel

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:20.489
bone area becomes very soft and you start
getting the cool breeze from that part.

01:03:20.489 --> 01:03:24.940
Now in short I’ve told you but in details
you can go through the book it’s all written

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:26.349
down about these centers.

01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:32.349
Which are the basic seven centers but there
are many other centers, which are sub plexuses

01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:33.560
of this.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.950
Amazingly there’s one thing that all these
centers are manifesting the plexuses outside

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:40.919
and all these plexuses.

01:03:40.919 --> 01:03:46.629
For example here, the plexus is the one that
looks after the pituitary and the pineal,

01:03:46.629 --> 01:03:48.250
these two things.

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:55.099
So it is related absolutely with the gross
as well but we go from inside outward while

01:03:55.099 --> 01:03:57.000
the doctors go from outward inside.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.190
Which you cannot go you cannot enter into
a tree through a leaf you can enter only through

01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:03.050
the sap into it.

01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:05.409
These are in short I have told you.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:09.081
But there are all these things are clearly
written down in a book that they will give

01:04:09.081 --> 01:04:10.081
you.

01:04:10.081 --> 01:04:11.081
They have got it.

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:12.081
Have you got that book?

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.081
You can get.

01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:14.081
It’s a very small booklet.

01:04:14.081 --> 01:04:15.240
Do you charge any money for that?

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.240
No?

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240
It’s free?

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240
You charge a little.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.240
How much?

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.860
Man: Ten pie or something.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.259
Ten pie or something they charge.

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:29.399
You see because maybe, so far all these boys
have been printing it and paying for it for

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:30.399
the whole also.

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:34.140
I mean this thing requires money no doubt,
but these boys have been doing it.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.269
And it’s all right not much you see.

01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:42.749
Birmingham is a cheep place that way I must
say compared to some places I went to.

01:04:42.749 --> 01:04:48.980
Also everybody is trying to fund it so that,
I mean there is no sort of any profit basis

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.980
or anything.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:55.180
But like ashram we have got we have got say
ten people they take a house they live there,

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.480
look after it and that’s an ashram.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:02.500
There’s no sort of a profit making or any
fees or anything.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.899
Because they live there, they have a house,
they live there that’s all.

01:05:04.899 --> 01:05:05.919
It’s as simple as that.

01:05:05.919 --> 01:05:10.289
We do not have any such organization; there
is nobody who is organized in it.

01:05:10.289 --> 01:05:12.029
You cannot organize God.

01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:16.789
So there’s no organization they are there
because of their free will, because of their

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:21.550
freedom and because of their love and because
they feel responsible that they should do

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.550
it.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:27.909
There’s no force on you; there’s no compulsion;
there’s no money taking; there’s no membership.

01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:42.928
Man: Is it also possible please for any of
those centers to awaken without the knowledge

01:05:42.928 --> 01:05:45.838
of the individual?

01:05:45.888 --> 01:05:55.119
You see, sometimes it happens, that a person
can be attacked from the sides and then that

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:57.549
centre can go on emitting too much.

01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:59.599
Like in cancer it happens.

01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:03.118
That one of the centers you see, say for instance
the stomach.

01:06:03.118 --> 01:06:10.248
If you are eating say something which is irritating
the stomach centre, then what happens that

01:06:10.248 --> 01:06:16.888
this centre receives all the energies from
everywhere, all the stored up energy and starts

01:06:16.888 --> 01:06:18.049
working very hard.

01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:21.368
When it starts working very hard, it gets
dislocated.

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:26.399
When it gets dislocated, what happens that
there is no relationship left with the whole

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:33.098
and the cells starts growing more than in
relation to the whole.

01:06:33.098 --> 01:06:35.689
And we say malignancy has been set in.

01:06:35.689 --> 01:06:38.828
And like that can happen they can get over
excited.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:44.169
But the energy from other centers is brought
in one and they get over excited with out

01:06:44.169 --> 01:06:46.078
any relationship to the whole.

01:06:46.078 --> 01:06:47.828
And that’s a very dangerous situation.

01:06:47.828 --> 01:06:53.309
Such a thing can happen and sometimes it can
happen on certain centers where people just

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:54.309
get possessed.

01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:56.299
And they think they have got some sort of
a great experience.

01:06:56.299 --> 01:06:57.299
Is not so.

01:06:57.299 --> 01:07:01.519
Like there was a lady who always felt she’s
getting out of her body.

01:07:01.519 --> 01:07:02.998
Ultimately she got her cancer.

01:07:02.998 --> 01:07:05.329
Now, of course, she is cured; she’s all
right.

01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:10.008
But these all such experiences come from the
left and the right side.

01:07:10.008 --> 01:07:11.008
Not from the superior.

01:07:11.008 --> 01:07:16.179
The one experience on the left hand side is
of the collective subconscious because on

01:07:16.179 --> 01:07:21.208
the left hand side of this channel that you
see is the collective subconscious.

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:26.089
Now we do not know because these are unknown
areas for us; the collective subconscious

01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:28.988
on this area and the collective supraconscious
on this area.

01:07:28.988 --> 01:07:32.659
Now, for example, spiritualists they work
from the collective subconscious; very dangerous

01:07:32.659 --> 01:07:34.008
thing to do.

01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:37.128
We have nothing to do with spirits, nothing
to do with them.

01:07:37.128 --> 01:07:39.789
We are in the centre and the present.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:45.138
If you indulge into spiritualism, you’ll
find you develop a very funny situation and

01:07:45.138 --> 01:07:47.118
I don’t know how they end it up.

01:07:47.118 --> 01:07:53.478
Apart from mental trouble, you’ll be amazed,
I’m amazed at it myself, that all the cancer

01:07:53.478 --> 01:07:58.963
patients I’ve seen so far are all attacked
from the left side not from the right side.

01:07:59.043 --> 01:08:03.043
Those who are attacked from the right side
is the supraconscious the collective supraconscious

01:08:03.043 --> 01:08:04.534
are the people like Hitler.

01:08:04.534 --> 01:08:12.343
Who get possessed by very, you can say very,
very dominating personalities who are dead

01:08:12.343 --> 01:08:15.943
or those who lived in the future great planners
this that they get attacked.

01:08:15.943 --> 01:08:20.784
And once they get attacked there’s an outlet.

01:08:20.784 --> 01:08:25.063
For example you can say Hitler was like a
medium and he transformed other people into

01:08:25.063 --> 01:08:28.463
that kind of a frantic temperament.

01:08:28.463 --> 01:08:33.423
I mean it took him eleven years to build up
that kind of a domain of Satans you see but

01:08:33.423 --> 01:08:34.524
it took eleven years.

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:39.894
And I would blame then the people who allowed
this to grow and once this grew up and suddenly

01:08:39.894 --> 01:08:43.644
it blew up them then they realized; oh God
where are we?

01:08:43.644 --> 01:08:48.904
So these attacks can come from these two areas
they are called as Adiboutic and Adidevic

01:08:48.904 --> 01:08:50.454
in Sanskrit language.

01:08:50.454 --> 01:08:57.303
But this is, is the spirit; is the Atma; is
the superior; is the super most experience

01:08:57.303 --> 01:09:03.463
where you become the spirit itself, your spirit
not somebody else’s.

01:09:03.463 --> 01:09:09.423
So all these experiences are not healthy;
they should be avoided for all those who are

01:09:09.423 --> 01:09:10.423
seeking reality.

01:09:10.423 --> 01:09:14.665
I mean if you want to have some jugglery,
then it’s a different thing but it is a

01:09:14.665 --> 01:09:16.813
very dangerous thing to play with it.

01:09:16.813 --> 01:09:20.413
All these gurus are using only this either
left or the right side.

01:09:20.413 --> 01:09:24.075
They use the spirits and that’s how they
mesmerize.

01:09:25.705 --> 01:09:27.805
That’s a very dangerous state.

01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:33.019
The other day Sahaja Yoga has become so powerful
now that they these people gave realization

01:09:33.059 --> 01:09:35.810
to an archbishop of black magic.

01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:36.810
Can you imagine?

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:38.360
I was amazed.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:43.150
And this fellow was quite all right then he
went home and he found everything was moving

01:09:43.150 --> 01:09:44.150
around.

01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:46.919
This all the things that were there were moving
around.

01:09:46.919 --> 01:09:51.760
Now the spirits were tempting him back they
thought if we show some sort of this jugglery

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.399
he will be back again.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.490
And they telephoned to me Mother now what
to do.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:56.789
I said why did you give him realization?

01:09:56.789 --> 01:09:58.819
There was no need to give him realization.

01:09:58.819 --> 01:10:00.730
He said just he came and he got it.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:02.539
I said leave him alone I’ll look after him
you don’t worry.

01:10:02.539 --> 01:10:05.809
It happens now.

01:10:05.809 --> 01:10:10.769
This Sahaja yoga is so great imagine giving
realization to the archbishop of black magic.

01:10:10.769 --> 01:10:12.919
I mean this is too much.

01:10:12.919 --> 01:10:14.209
It’s doing.

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:23.290
It’s happening.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:28.192
Man: May I say by the way that um I can see
a white aura around your head for the last

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.210
hour.

01:10:29.256 --> 01:10:32.542
Yes it’s true, but I would say don’t see
that.

01:10:32.592 --> 01:10:36.181
You’ll see many things because I’m something
more; there’s no doubt.

01:10:36.181 --> 01:10:37.181
Quite a lot I am.

01:10:37.181 --> 01:10:39.962
That you have to discover later.

01:10:39.962 --> 01:10:41.451
You can see many things.

01:10:41.451 --> 01:10:46.681
But I would say don’t say anything because
this also seeing is not the thing experiencing

01:10:46.681 --> 01:10:51.321
is the thing and that’s why you must experience
your being.

01:10:51.321 --> 01:10:53.771
And People have seen me in many forms many
things.

01:10:53.771 --> 01:10:55.331
That’s not important.

01:10:55.331 --> 01:10:56.892
That’s not important.

01:10:56.892 --> 01:11:01.071
Important is that you must get your realization.

01:11:01.071 --> 01:11:03.821
I must be something isn’t it to do it?

01:11:03.821 --> 01:11:05.811
No doubt there must be something about me.

01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:07.951
But I don’t want to talk about it just now.

01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:11.352
I’m very tactful; you better find out.

01:11:11.352 --> 01:11:14.624
Lady: Why is peace and tranquility adjusted
on your face?

01:11:14.624 --> 01:11:21.311
On my face?

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:22.561
You are also going to get it.

01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:24.321
That’s all I can say.

01:11:24.321 --> 01:11:26.911
It is there inside.

01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:31.291
It is all whatever is inside comes out isn’t
it?

01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:36.331
You are all peace, tranquility everything
inside you are also the same not only me.

01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:39.691
You have to just feel it.

01:11:39.691 --> 01:11:46.122
You will, you will no doubt, you will no doubt.

01:11:46.122 --> 01:11:47.122
I assure you.

01:11:47.122 --> 01:11:48.791
That’s why I’m here; I want you to enjoy
that what I am enjoying.

01:11:48.791 --> 01:11:49.872
That’s all.

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:52.462
You see it’s like a drunkard who cannot
enjoy his drink.

01:11:52.462 --> 01:11:55.889
That’s why I say that I am a capitalist
because I have all these powers and I am the

01:11:55.921 --> 01:11:57.989
greatest communist because I must share.

01:11:58.049 --> 01:12:00.768
I can’t help it without sharing.

01:12:00.768 --> 01:12:06.258
So this such a combination, all right?
