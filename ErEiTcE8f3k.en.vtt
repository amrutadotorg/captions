WEBVTT

01:31.360 --> 01:42.530
So now we have here one of the most ancient
places called Nasik.

01:42.530 --> 01:51.310
I think you must have heard about what happened
when Shri Rama and Sita were staying here,

01:51.310 --> 01:55.950
why this place was called as Nasik that I
will tell you in short.

01:55.950 --> 02:06.390
This is the place where Shri Rama and Sita
and Lakshmana were staying and the sister

02:06.390 --> 02:13.930
of Ravana, because Ravana’s some of the
empires, a part of the empire was very close

02:13.930 --> 02:16.900
to this place.

02:16.900 --> 02:23.720
She came down to entice Shri Rama.

02:23.720 --> 02:31.000
So Shri Rama smiled at her He said that, “It
is not possible with Me because I have a very

02:31.000 --> 02:40.250
nice wife” in His own sweet ways and He
is known for His formals, formal is not the

02:40.250 --> 02:44.080
word but for a sweet formalities, and we call
it Sankocha.

02:44.080 --> 02:51.410
He said, “You better try your hand on My
brother”, because He knew His brother is

02:51.410 --> 02:54.299
a terrific fellow.

02:54.299 --> 03:02.780
So this is all rakshasi, it’s all qualities
of rakshashas that women who are rakshasinis

03:02.780 --> 03:04.570
try to entice men.

03:04.570 --> 03:06.820
Men who are rakshasas try to entice woman.

03:06.820 --> 03:10.660
It’s a quality of rakshashas not human beings.

03:10.660 --> 03:13.370
And of course not of the Devas.

03:13.370 --> 03:16.310
So this rakshasini wanted to try her luck.

03:16.310 --> 03:23.400
With her ego she went down to Lakshmana and
she told Him that you are now living without

03:23.400 --> 03:30.370
your wife for 14 years and this 14 years are
going to be very heavy for you.

03:30.370 --> 03:32.220
So I think you better marry me.

03:32.220 --> 03:36.360
I am a good lady why don’t you marry me?

03:36.360 --> 03:39.440
So she said I have got a beautiful nose.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
I have got beautiful eyes.

03:40.440 --> 03:54.060
I am very beautiful, must be artificial, I
am sure or might have been to some sort of

03:54.060 --> 04:01.959
a Beauty Parlor or something, God knows what
she must have tried but she was trying to

04:01.959 --> 04:02.980
impress.

04:02.980 --> 04:05.280
And the fellow was getting infuriated.

04:05.280 --> 04:11.420
You see, He could not see it, to see that
look at this lady coming and trying to challenge

04:11.420 --> 04:16.410
My chastity and He got ultimately very angry.

04:16.410 --> 04:17.890
He told her, “You get out from here.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.690
I have nothing to do with you.

04:19.690 --> 04:20.690
You are useless.

04:20.690 --> 04:23.150
Don’t try this trick with Me.

04:23.150 --> 04:27.541
” But she would not go she was so enchanted
by Him and she, her ego was hurt.

04:27.541 --> 04:31.630
She said no, not to accept any defeat.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.710
She went on.

04:33.710 --> 04:37.780
Then He got very angry and He cut her nose.

04:37.780 --> 04:40.660
Of which she was very proud that I have a
beautiful nose.

04:40.660 --> 04:41.780
He cut her nose.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.810
And nose represents ego.

04:43.810 --> 04:50.060
See when people have ego, you see their nose
go like that.

04:50.060 --> 04:55.160
Like we have, you must have seen while coming
from Runala they said Duke’s nose because

04:55.160 --> 05:00.990
such a big nose they start it cannot be an
Englishman’s nose it must be Duke of some

05:00.990 --> 05:01.990
place.

05:01.990 --> 05:03.620
Otherwise cannot be such a big nose, see.

05:03.620 --> 05:07.470
So Indians call it as Duke’s nose.

05:07.470 --> 05:10.630
So the big nose, such a big nose she had.

05:10.630 --> 05:19.830
He cut her nose showing that he tried to destroy
her ego of her beauty.

05:19.830 --> 05:30.530
It’s very significant, very significant
that this Lakshmana resides in the stomach

05:30.530 --> 05:34.340
we can say on the right side.

05:34.340 --> 05:43.970
He looks after our right side which is the
liver, which gives us the ego part and it

05:43.970 --> 05:47.560
is He only who destroys it.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.130
So He is the big destroyer of our ego.

05:50.130 --> 05:54.120
It’s significant that destroyed the ego
of this woman.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.480
She could not entice anyone by cutting her
nose.

05:57.480 --> 06:02.730
Nose is a word call Nasika in Sanskrit language.

06:02.730 --> 06:09.560
That’s why this place was named after that
cutting of the nose, as Nasik.

06:09.560 --> 06:16.380
But as in every religious places we gather
all kinds of negativity, lots of negativity

06:16.380 --> 06:23.389
gathered also in Nasik and the people who
in the name of God thought that they were

06:23.389 --> 06:28.600
great place as we have in every religion,
you know in Christianity or in Islam, in all

06:28.600 --> 06:31.200
religious we have the same problem.

06:31.200 --> 06:36.840
The started their shops here so this one of
the shopping centers of God.

06:36.840 --> 06:44.160
Those who are interested in shopping of gurus
can come nicely to Nasik and empty their pockets

06:44.160 --> 06:45.870
nicely.

06:45.870 --> 06:48.760
So this one of the troubles of this place.

06:48.760 --> 06:52.510
And that’s why Sahaja Yoga takes time to
root itself.

06:52.510 --> 07:00.820
We have already given up Kolapur, which is
another great place we have given up.

07:00.820 --> 07:06.100
Pandapur and also in a way Thirujapur because
there they have all these negative forces

07:06.100 --> 07:12.710
acting and they are all making money though
the place is so vibrated, it’s so great

07:12.710 --> 07:14.920
because Shri Rama came here.

07:14.920 --> 07:19.930
He was not wearing His slippers, and His wife
also came bare feet.

07:19.930 --> 07:25.710
They all touched this Mother Earth so this
place must be very vibrated, no doubt, but

07:25.710 --> 07:34.610
all these nagativites are here as we are very
susceptible when we are superficial, people

07:34.610 --> 07:39.860
catch negativity first and the positivity
comes later on.

07:39.860 --> 07:45.950
Thus this Nasik place was contaminated by
those people who wanted to make money in the

07:45.950 --> 07:48.140
name of God.

07:48.140 --> 07:55.610
Now we have come here, one may say that Mother
we don’t get many people here or also you

07:55.610 --> 07:59.270
can say that Sahaja Yoga is very slowly moving,
I agree.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.219
It’s moving faster anywhere else.

08:02.219 --> 08:06.919
Despite the fact Dr Sangi and his family are
such strong people and we have some very strong

08:06.919 --> 08:08.409
Sahaja Yogis here.

08:08.409 --> 08:13.250
But that’s why we need very strong people
over here to work out these negativities and

08:13.250 --> 08:16.639
a day will come when they will all run away.

08:16.639 --> 08:21.979
Your coming helps a lot because you also channel
the Divinity and then you come to this country,

08:21.979 --> 08:27.560
this part of the country or to this place
which is full of negativity.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.280
Your vibrations help a lot.

08:29.280 --> 08:34.820
That’s why I always ask you to do some shopping
in Nasik and today if possible for an hour

08:34.820 --> 08:39.899
if you could do it would be nice but in any
case if you want to go to Saptha Shringi also

08:39.899 --> 08:41.130
you can go.

08:41.130 --> 08:46.390
Now continuing with the lecture I gave you
the other day about the beautiful mirror God

08:46.390 --> 08:48.090
created to see Himself.

08:48.090 --> 08:56.720
But after creating the whole universe He created
the Mother Earth.

08:56.720 --> 09:02.230
Then He took the Mother Earth towards the
moon so that it cools down and then He moves

09:02.230 --> 09:07.980
the Mother Earth towards the Sun and brought
it to a point where the life could be sustained.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.040
That is how the life started on Earth.

09:10.040 --> 09:19.700
In the Puranas it’s described that there
were Avatars of Shri Vishnu on this Earth

09:19.700 --> 09:24.350
who one by one lead for the evolution.

09:24.350 --> 09:31.260
Like that you have seen we have Macha Avatar,
Kurma Avatar and all those things about which

09:31.260 --> 09:35.150
you know and the new Sahaja Yogis should be
told about.

09:35.150 --> 09:40.840
Ultimately this is the situation now at the
Sahasrara where I had to come.

09:40.840 --> 09:49.390
At this stage the main job is to give Realization,
to raise your Kundalini, that is My main job.

09:49.390 --> 09:53.660
And that’s what has to happen in a very
large scale.

09:53.660 --> 09:58.550
In this country there isn’t such a problem
because very few places are like this where

09:58.550 --> 10:04.259
there is negativity, in the villages you have
seen how in that fisherman’s place so many

10:04.259 --> 10:09.899
people came who were simple hearted, how beautifully
they sang to you, they sang to Me and they

10:09.899 --> 10:11.480
were so nice.

10:11.480 --> 10:15.710
So this country is not such a difficult thing
to give Realization and to settle them in

10:15.710 --> 10:22.260
Sahaja Yoga because they immediately jump
to joy of Sahaja Yoga while in the West as

10:22.260 --> 10:28.610
you know we do not jump into the joy but we
first start seeing it through our rational

10:28.610 --> 10:29.610
being.

10:29.610 --> 10:32.540
Rationality then develops into what we call
the Chitta.

10:32.540 --> 10:39.230
Then we start using our attention for different
places seeing vibrations this and that but

10:39.230 --> 10:44.660
the joy part comes later on and that’s why
it doesn’t settle in many people.

10:44.660 --> 10:53.769
To begin with they have to be little bit,
ah, told and made to settle down because the

10:53.769 --> 13:12.270
nature of the Kundalini is such
(May God bless you, May god bless you, come

13:12.270 --> 13:38.749
in time – Shri Mataji is talking to someone)
All right God created this universe to see

13:38.749 --> 13:50.480
His image and as I told you that gold cannot
see its beauty, nature can not see its beauty,

13:50.480 --> 13:52.980
the Sun cannot see its beauty.

13:52.980 --> 14:02.730
So they have to express themselves, manifest
themselves to see their own image.

14:02.730 --> 14:10.779
Now God has created human beings ultimately
as I told you and now He wants to see His

14:10.779 --> 14:13.889
beautiful image in you people.

14:13.889 --> 14:19.810
So first of all to know that your mirror is
your Spirit.

14:19.810 --> 14:27.209
That is the mirror you have got which you
can see, which does not know its greatness,

14:27.209 --> 14:34.600
does not know its beauty, does not know anything,
in the sense that it reflects the beauty of

14:34.600 --> 14:36.759
God within you.

14:36.759 --> 14:44.209
Now you have to create an image or you can
say we have to manifest our work in such a

14:44.209 --> 14:53.120
manner that we see our image of this mirror
of God that we have got within ourselves.

14:53.120 --> 15:02.430
So when Sahaja Yogis start manifesting themselves,
ascerting themselves, projecting themselves,

15:02.430 --> 15:08.139
then they can see their own image and they
are surprised how can we (be) so beautiful?

15:08.139 --> 15:10.759
How can we be so nice?

15:10.759 --> 15:15.040
How can we be so powerful?

15:15.040 --> 15:19.449
How can we be the universal power?

15:19.449 --> 15:21.279
How we are helped?

15:21.279 --> 15:27.329
This is very surprising and that is how
(Please keep your eyes open otherwise your

15:27.329 --> 15:28.740
Chakras won’t be all right – Shri Mataji
is talking to someone)

15:28.740 --> 15:42.100
So when you get all these experiences of your
goodness, of your greatness, of your glory,

15:42.100 --> 15:44.309
you start manifesting God.

15:44.309 --> 15:47.300
So now for God your mirror is ready.

15:47.300 --> 15:50.709
For Him you are His mirror.

15:50.709 --> 15:54.470
And He wants to see Himself through you.

15:54.470 --> 15:59.519
So all the beauty that you have, all the powers
you have are within you.

15:59.519 --> 16:06.110
But most of the religions which are established
by great saints who wanted to help in this

16:06.110 --> 16:11.529
procedure have been just reversed that you
are told that you are the worst, you are the

16:11.529 --> 16:14.620
sinners, you are the hopeless people, good
for nothing.

16:14.620 --> 16:19.999
So that you will go and give more money and
more money and that’s another stupidity.

16:19.999 --> 16:24.370
You can see so clearly how stupid the whole
effort is.

16:24.370 --> 16:27.330
By doing that you make people look ugly, sickly,
useless.

16:27.330 --> 16:35.259
The whole system, the whole civilization works
in the other way round.

16:35.259 --> 16:42.851
For example, if nowadays I have seen in the
West that if you look like a TB patient you

16:42.851 --> 16:49.022
are regarded as beauty or some sort of a bhoot
you are regarded as beauty.

16:49.022 --> 16:55.670
On the contrary, you have to look healthy,
blossoming like a flower, fresh, that is the

16:55.670 --> 17:05.410
sign of a person who is beautiful, not a person
who is all the time sighing and who is about

17:05.410 --> 17:13.140
to shift into the hospital or into a grave
yard, that sort of an idea God never had in

17:13.140 --> 17:14.140
His mind.

17:14.140 --> 17:21.740
This the idea which has come to you through
the clever management of some of the evil

17:21.740 --> 17:22.819
doers.

17:22.819 --> 17:26.709
And they have given you these ideas and you
are working them out.

17:26.709 --> 17:33.660
So the sense of beauty that you have has to
be a little different, much different as it

17:33.660 --> 17:36.360
absolutely just opposition.

17:36.360 --> 17:41.059
The face of a person who is a Realized soul
is very different from faces of others.

17:41.059 --> 17:47.450
To them he may not be beautiful because they
see the ugliness while we see the real beauty

17:47.450 --> 17:49.120
that pleases God.

17:49.120 --> 17:53.620
It should please God to see your faces, reflecting
His manifestation.

17:53.620 --> 18:00.410
Like you see the flowers, you like the flowers
which are fresh, you look at them with great

18:00.410 --> 18:01.410
admiration.

18:01.410 --> 18:08.740
In the same way when God see His reflection
among Sahaja Yogis, He will very much fulfilled.

18:08.740 --> 18:13.559
And that’s what I felt yesterday when you
all sang together with all the East and the

18:13.559 --> 18:16.390
West combine together with such beauty.

18:16.390 --> 18:23.530
I felt that I was fulfilled within Myself
that something has been happening and something

18:23.530 --> 18:25.050
has shown the results.

18:25.050 --> 18:28.650
The beauty is showing now on the faces of
My children.

18:28.650 --> 18:32.740
We should please God.

18:32.740 --> 18:35.980
We should please Me very much.

18:35.980 --> 18:39.740
So this is a very great thing that has happening
in Nasik I think.

18:39.740 --> 18:49.779
This gratitude of yours and My own gratification,
I felt very gratified.

18:49.779 --> 18:52.720
I felt very satisfied and fulfilled.

18:52.720 --> 19:03.640
And that is the thing in a place like this
where Sita had to suffer so much, where Lakshmana

19:03.640 --> 19:05.440
had to do all these ugly things.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.450
It was terrible thing that happened in Nasik.

19:08.450 --> 19:14.659
And then if you get in that background, like
in a drama you see, you show a climax and

19:14.659 --> 19:16.770
then the anticlimax like that.

19:16.770 --> 19:19.680
Yesterday I felt the drama is complete now.

19:19.680 --> 19:25.299
I was really very much satisfied what happened
last night, the oneness with which we sang,

19:25.299 --> 19:29.090
the oneness we felt and the oneness we had
about ourselves.

19:29.090 --> 19:31.280
We are universal beings.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.870
We do not belong to any country.

19:32.870 --> 19:37.409
We do not belong to any cast, community or
so called religions.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.210
We are all universal people.

19:39.210 --> 19:45.080
We have no such bondages, which keep us separate
from each other.

19:45.080 --> 19:52.100
All this love, all this affection and all
this is going to transform this horrible world

19:52.100 --> 19:58.309
into the right path, into the righteous path,
into the path of benevolence.

19:58.309 --> 20:01.399
So Nasik has done something good to Me.

20:01.399 --> 20:06.680
Last time I had tears in My eyes and you have
taken the photograph of this Sandra Karuna

20:06.680 --> 20:10.440
and today I have got the feeling of great
joy within Myself.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.280
May God bless you all. Thank you.
