1
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:12,745
Today it's a different day altogether for all of you,

2
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:22,665
because this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

3
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:31,364
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,

4
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:38,698
it's not only the left side that you know.

5
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:46,364
You all know only the left side, from Shri Ganesha

6
00:10:47,932 --> 00:10:55,698
through the ascent of different, different chakras on the left side.

7
00:10:56,565 --> 00:11:02,464
I didn't want to tell you about the right side to begin with,

8
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:11,398
because those who have gone through the right side got just lost.

9
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:23,531
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings

10
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:28,331
but they didn't know what it was about,

11
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:35,464
they just used to learn it by heart.

12
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:40,398
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

13
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:47,398
and that is how they moved on the right side

14
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:53,698
and, I don’t know, they landed up at the Agnya;

15
00:11:56,531 --> 00:12:00,898
and then they were trying for the Self-realization.

16
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:07,398
They were promised that if you do this right side properly,

17
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:14,565
you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realization.

18
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:18,364
But none of them reached there.

19
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:22,398
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

20
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:29,398
terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

21
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:37,565
All these things they learnt through their right-side movement.

22
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:42,398
There was no kundalini awakening,

23
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:51,398
and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya Chakra,

24
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:59,498
and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

25
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:11,098
All these books were written without understanding

26
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:15,831
that it's not easy to go via right side,

27
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:23,865
but best was to awaken your kundalini.

28
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:30,364
The kundalini directly takes you up in the center of all the chakras,

29
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:37,398
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya

30
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:44,398
into the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

31
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:51,498
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra, from where it pierces?

32
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,631
I never told you about it.

33
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:59,631
But now I think for most of you the time has come.

34
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:06,498
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,

35
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:11,898
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating always.

36
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:19,464
It is pulsating because the spirit entered through that area,

37
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:26,598
and when you close it, it settles in the heart.

38
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:34,398
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented person,

39
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:41,598
but how to enter into the Sahasrara was the problem.

40
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:46,831
The tantrikas who were there, they went through the right, left side,

41
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:57,665
and they developed all the practices of black – we should say, the left side.

42
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:06,898
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, I should say,

43
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:12,631
extremely ambitious, ferocious,

44
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:22,798
and they started killing people on the basis of cursing.

45
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:25,731
They are very good at cursing people;

46
00:15:26,831 --> 00:15:31,831
to be always forward, push back all the people,

47
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,464
and override everybody's rights.

48
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:43,531
They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

49
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:50,631
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,

50
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:53,498
they then took the right side.

51
00:15:54,398 --> 00:15:58,464
Because of the right side they became very powerful, no doubt.

52
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:02,431
They got all the powers over the world

53
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:12,665
and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people,

54
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:16,932
but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered.

55
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:20,965
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

56
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:26,364
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving,”

57
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:33,765
and the seven chakras were described, on the right side.

58
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:41,598
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

59
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:46,565
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

60
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:52,898
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha.

61
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:59,364
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;

62
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:05,598
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside,

63
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:12,498
is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

64
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:21,331
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

65
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:35,364
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

66
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:41,698
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,

67
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:46,531
go to the people – janah.

68
00:17:47,831 --> 00:17:52,631
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

69
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:59,431
In tapah we have Christ in the center;

70
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:10,364
left side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

71
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:16,531
They were not actually ascending path,

72
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:22,865
they were just side outlets, we can say,

73
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:30,032
for the energy of people who were trying to seek the truth.

74
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:39,498
Now this happened for ages in India.

75
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:42,531
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

76
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:46,565
all the big tapassvis, all of them did this.

77
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:49,398
But where did they reach?

78
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:55,032
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses –

79
00:18:55,398 --> 00:19:00,431
kshu, shapah – to people, they could curse somebody.

80
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:09,631
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye they could kill somebody,

81
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:15,498
they could burn something; all right-sided powers they had.

82
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:20,998
And with these right-sided powers, where did they reach?

83
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:27,765
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not, in the limbo, as you call it.

84
00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:32,565
There nobody got Self-realization.

85
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:43,398
You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks;

86
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:51,865
and then we had Egyptians, English

87
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:59,498
and all kinds of aggressive people, Germans

88
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:10,132
– all of them were aggressive – Catholics, and also you had Romans.

89
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:12,932
All of them were aggressive,

90
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:19,032
and were taking the land and property of other countries;

91
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:25,631
extremely aggressive, they believed in the killing of the people -

92
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:32,965
extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

93
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:42,531
So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path?

94
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:54,398
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv, swaha, swadha,

95
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:59,498
it’s consumption – this was done by Guru Principle.

96
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:07,398
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

97
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:11,731
They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful

98
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:21,698
that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

99
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:25,698
With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people

100
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,631
and were oppressing them.

101
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:34,398
All this kind of … generation came in the history,

102
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:37,531
as you know, and then it disappeared.

103
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:47,565
Wars were created, then so many people were killed.

104
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:54,398
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

105
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,398
They never cared for humanity.

106
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:04,032
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

107
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:14,531
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ.

108
00:22:15,598 --> 00:22:19,398
They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints

109
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:25,431
through the central path – some were incarnations –

110
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:27,698
and they destroyed them.

111
00:22:29,132 --> 00:22:37,765
All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened.

112
00:22:39,498 --> 00:22:43,932
And one after another so many rakshasas came,

113
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:50,398
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world;

114
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:57,698
extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them,

115
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:00,831
very aggressive people.

116
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:10,731
And this aggression came, came with such a great force,

117
00:23:11,865 --> 00:23:14,398
and followed one after another.

118
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:20,464
It went up to a point.

119
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:28,565
When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed.

120
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:38,531
So horrible people were created;

121
00:23:45,498 --> 00:24:00,398
all these people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

122
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:11,698
This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided.

123
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:23,598
All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others.

124
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:30,531
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth.

125
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:34,998
They wanted to have spirituality,

126
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:45,932
but with this kind of behavior they had developed, spirituality ran away.

127
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:50,431
We had so many incarnations.

128
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:55,731
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

129
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:06,665
There was no possibility of saving human beings in general.

130
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:12,032
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

131
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:17,331
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,

132
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:22,065
all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

133
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:30,898
All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement

134
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:35,665
which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not.

135
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:42,364
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage

136
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:49,898
that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas,

137
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:54,965
without realizing that human beings are rakshasas,

138
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:58,565
that's what they become.

139
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:04,898
Even their gurus were like that,

140
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:13,565
and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations,

141
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:16,932
all the incarnations were tortured by them.

142
00:26:17,898 --> 00:26:22,398
It was really – how they saved themselves is remarkable,

143
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:28,364
but ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

144
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:36,898
So the first thing I tried was to study about the kundalini,

145
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:41,831
that I should be able to raise the kundalini.

146
00:26:42,098 --> 00:26:44,498
And I knew I had come for that,

147
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:49,598
not for anything else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

148
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:56,898
so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left.

149
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:03,798
But I told you the knowledge of the left side, plus raising your kundalini.

150
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:09,765
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,

151
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:22,565
and you entered into the realm of real joy, of reality.

152
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:29,731
All these bad qualities started falling out.

153
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,531
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

154
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:39,665
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path,

155
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:45,398
you became very pure people.

156
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:50,798
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away,

157
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:56,331
your cheapness went away and you became very, very –

158
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:03,898
I think we should call them the holy people.

159
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:09,364
Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

160
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:14,798
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish,

161
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:20,831
you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that,

162
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:25,665
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

163
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,631
So all such people were thrown out.

164
00:28:28,898 --> 00:28:32,464
Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say.

165
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:35,464
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

166
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:41,364
But they understand now, some of them, that “we have made mistakes.”

167
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:48,765
So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity,

168
00:28:49,731 --> 00:28:53,364
respect it and enjoy it.

169
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:58,831
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

170
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:07,598
That's the first chakra on the left side, where you have Shri Ganesha.

171
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:12,565
But on the right side also we have deities.

172
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:18,565
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,

173
00:29:19,331 --> 00:29:22,865
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

174
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:30,598
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity,

175
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,431
and we started understanding the beauty of purity,

176
00:29:35,765 --> 00:29:38,565
the power of purity.

177
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:46,731
That's how our right side we finished off.

178
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:53,698
Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger.

179
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:58,865
There was no peace for these people.

180
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:06,364
The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

181
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:16,364
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level of Swadisthan.

182
00:30:17,431 --> 00:30:21,498
In Swadisthana they rose,

183
00:30:21,932 --> 00:30:28,531
and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something.

184
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:31,631
Even now we have many.

185
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:36,932
They create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque,

186
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:46,831
also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name.

187
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:51,431
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

188
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:56,464
people who wanted to have a name, a position –

189
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:00,698
that came from right Swadisthana.

190
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:07,932
Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi Chakra.

191
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:12,731
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make money,

192
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:18,631
not Lakshmi but money, money by any means,

193
00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:23,631
and they cheated the whole world.

194
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:31,331
With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things.

195
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:39,731
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

196
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:47,398
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India,

197
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,898
and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

198
00:31:55,498 --> 00:32:02,531
In the center, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness:

199
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:06,798
creative of art, which is very beautiful,

200
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:11,831
which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

201
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:16,565
That vanished, and people started showing

202
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:20,698
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

203
00:32:21,798 --> 00:32:25,898
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

204
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:31,065
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

205
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:39,398
In Nabhi people got after money.

206
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:43,398
Left-sided people were making money,

207
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:45,932
right-sided were aggressive with their money.

208
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:49,665
If they were earning they thought they’re on top of the world.

209
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:54,565
If they had money they thought, “Nobody is better than us.”

210
00:32:55,865 --> 00:33:01,065
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

211
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:04,831
It will come to that point where they will realize

212
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:10,565
that money is not for destroying but for construction:

213
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:15,464
constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together

214
00:33:15,631 --> 00:33:18,498
to bring peace and love among them,

215
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:25,798
for helping, for doing all kinds of good things.

216
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:38,665
Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother,

217
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:45,531
and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children,

218
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:52,765
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children.

219
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,665
We have had enough of these women

220
00:33:56,998 --> 00:34:01,565
who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children.

221
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,731
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

222
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,398
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw,

223
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:17,731
and I was shocked – what sort of human beings are those?

224
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:20,431
What am I going to do with them?

225
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:23,464
How will I awaken their kundalini?

226
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:27,464
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost,

227
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:31,364
but now it is the Mother's chakra.

228
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:36,998
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they drove out their children –

229
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:42,731
very selfish, self-centered, dominating parents.

230
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:51,765
This was the Heart Chakra.

231
00:34:53,464 --> 00:34:57,665
Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi.

232
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:03,531
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world.

233
00:35:04,598 --> 00:35:13,731
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors,

234
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:18,831
and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent

235
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:22,398
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

236
00:35:22,531 --> 00:35:24,698
They really were rakshasas, I should say,

237
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:27,765
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

238
00:35:28,464 --> 00:35:32,598
In their behavior, in everything you can see how they behave

239
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:37,431
towards people, treating them like that,

240
00:35:37,898 --> 00:35:44,731
creating people who are against spirituality,

241
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:48,398
and those who are aggressive.

242
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:53,965
Well, these became like a two-sided world

243
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:58,631
where there are people who are aggressive,

244
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:01,598
and the people who are tortured.

245
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:11,498
This two-sided world exists even now, but is much less.

246
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:16,598
Thanks to the collective understanding

247
00:36:16,665 --> 00:36:21,464
there are many good institution that were established

248
00:36:21,798 --> 00:36:26,398
but they are not working out, they are not so successful,

249
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:32,631
because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what?

250
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:35,898
Not themselves – controlling others,

251
00:36:36,398 --> 00:36:41,598
and all their behavior has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

252
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:47,398
Collectively you have, if you see around now today

253
00:36:47,598 --> 00:36:54,531
everywhere there’s war going on, fights going on, killing going on,

254
00:36:54,531 --> 00:36:59,898
destruction going on. How is it?

255
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:05,498
There are so many spiritual people here now on this world.

256
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:10,331
So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet,

257
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:13,765
very much enjoying their spiritual life,

258
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:20,398
have become very quiet and very peaceful people.

259
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:23,765
But that doesn't bring peace.

260
00:37:24,598 --> 00:37:29,464
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world,

261
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:31,531
you have to do something about it.

262
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:34,598
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

263
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:39,865
but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done,

264
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:43,631
how far they have gone, where can we meet them,

265
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:45,565
what can we change them.

266
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:48,132
At My level I can change many things,

267
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:51,598
but at your level how many people have you changed?

268
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:55,364
What have you done? That has to be said.

269
00:37:55,464 --> 00:37:59,598
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,

270
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:03,531
and you are very happy with your peace,

271
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:06,464
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

272
00:38:06,765 --> 00:38:10,665
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today,

273
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:15,898
that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights

274
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:19,731
are least bothered as to what good has to be done.

275
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:23,998
What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality,

276
00:38:24,798 --> 00:38:28,398
come to the puja, have more and more of it.

277
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:34,665
But they have done no collective work to change people.

278
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:37,631
Some of them are working, one or two,

279
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:40,498
but the rest of them are having a good time

280
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:44,398
enjoying themselves in such a manner

281
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:50,698
that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all.

282
00:38:51,598 --> 00:38:54,065
I would like you to now introspect

283
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:57,464
and find out how much collective work you have done,

284
00:38:57,731 --> 00:39:01,965
how many people you have got – like that.

285
00:39:02,398 --> 00:39:04,598
With whom are you talking?

286
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:07,865
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

287
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,398
Only so many are there.

288
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:15,565
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

289
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:18,631
So now you should take to the right side.

290
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:23,398
And when you take to the right side we'll create dynamic people,

291
00:39:23,898 --> 00:39:32,798
not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

292
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,431
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

293
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:40,798
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many.

294
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:44,898
And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them.

295
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:50,098
But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing.

296
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:54,065
In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

297
00:39:54,398 --> 00:39:58,464
Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

298
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:03,665
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the left side,

299
00:40:03,698 --> 00:40:06,865
where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing.

300
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:09,831
I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

301
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:16,032
But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great;

302
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:19,398
but how many people have they given realization?

303
00:40:19,565 --> 00:40:22,965
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

304
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:26,498
I have said even in the aeroplane also you go,

305
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:30,464
you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

306
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:35,431
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

307
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:39,998
for our understanding of ourselves.

308
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:43,698
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

309
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:50,498
It has been brought to you for giving realizations to many people.

310
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,665
I request all the younger people, younger generation

311
00:40:53,698 --> 00:40:57,398
not to waste their Sahaj energies

312
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,765
on nonsense as the old people have done.

313
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:03,531
You’d better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yog,

314
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:05,531
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

315
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:11,531
They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitute,

316
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:13,731
doing this, - doing that – that's not your job.

317
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:18,998
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more Sahaja yoginis.

318
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:23,565
But that is not there, what I find is it's not there.

319
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,765
The right side is missing. You should come to the right side.

320
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:34,364
Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you,

321
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:38,531
nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

322
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:43,631
You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

323
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:48,932
That is why we have come to the stagnated point

324
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:52,531
that we should know we have to use our right side.

325
00:41:52,798 --> 00:41:55,598
Right side is very important.

326
00:41:56,498 --> 00:42:00,765
Next time I'll tell you about right side, what right-sided things you have.

327
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,831
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try;

328
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:08,731
so you use your right side in the right direction

329
00:42:09,032 --> 00:42:15,364
with the right understanding, not as some sort of,

330
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:22,765
I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers.

331
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:26,565
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

332
00:42:26,798 --> 00:42:29,665
But now the time has come for you

333
00:42:30,065 --> 00:42:33,865
to do something more than what the saints have done before,

334
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:37,765
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself

335
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:42,398
that you have a family, you have very nice children,

336
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:45,665
having, enjoying, all that – that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

337
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:51,965
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

338
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:57,831
You have to think about it: what are you doing, where are you,

339
00:42:58,565 --> 00:43:02,531
and what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

340
00:43:02,932 --> 00:43:06,631
Then we come to the Agnya.

341
00:43:07,865 --> 00:43:13,065
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis are become, they have,

342
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:19,431
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything – that's not we want.

343
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,831
What we want, to remove the sufferings of others,

344
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:26,731
remove the aggression of others.

345
00:43:26,965 --> 00:43:31,698
So we don't, that kind of organization we don't have,

346
00:43:32,398 --> 00:43:34,798
that kind of understanding we don’t have.

347
00:43:35,132 --> 00:43:39,765
And if that works out, you will be different people.

348
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:46,698
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls,

349
00:43:46,698 --> 00:43:51,565
something like that, not more than that.

350
00:43:52,398 --> 00:43:57,965
So better try to do something positive, without aggression.

351
00:43:58,132 --> 00:44:04,398
I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that.

352
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:12,898
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

353
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:17,898
then you will realize what mistakes you have,

354
00:44:18,998 --> 00:44:24,865
still what is lacking in your personality – that is very important.

355
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:28,898
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,

356
00:44:30,464 --> 00:44:32,965
I don't know what happens to them.

357
00:44:33,698 --> 00:44:36,898
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

358
00:44:37,498 --> 00:44:41,731
But that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things.

359
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:45,865
Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight,

360
00:44:45,898 --> 00:44:49,831
not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive – no.

361
00:44:50,665 --> 00:44:57,965
You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong.

362
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,431
You have to face it.

363
00:45:03,431 --> 00:45:08,598
If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people.

364
00:45:09,098 --> 00:45:12,865
What's the use of you people getting your realization?

365
00:45:14,565 --> 00:45:19,965
So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations,

366
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:22,431
that we are all right,

367
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:26,698
that you can cure some people is the last word – no.

368
00:45:27,598 --> 00:45:30,431
You have to spread it, you have to go in the public,

369
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:33,531
you have to be collective on this point

370
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:34,831
and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

371
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:41,531
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much.

372
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:46,865
So now it is you have to plan what you want to do,

373
00:45:46,965 --> 00:45:50,598
how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

374
00:45:50,898 --> 00:45:53,898
It's very important.

375
00:45:55,398 --> 00:46:02,398
Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga,

376
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:06,865
singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until

377
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:12,565
you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

378
00:46:13,765 --> 00:46:15,831
In a small country like Turkey

379
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:19,965
we have 25000 Sahaja yogis, what do you say?

380
00:46:20,464 --> 00:46:28,364
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis,

381
00:46:28,731 --> 00:46:34,398
while you find that number is very small in any other country.

382
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:40,698
They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realization

383
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,798
and for toward giving Self-realizations to others.

384
00:46:44,398 --> 00:46:49,698
It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

385
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:58,965
So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers,

386
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:01,598
think of giving power to others

387
00:47:01,798 --> 00:47:05,698
and making them Sahaja Yoga – it's very important.

388
00:47:06,464 --> 00:47:10,598
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all the powers.

389
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:14,598
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

390
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,865
what's the use of getting realization?

391
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:20,731
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

392
00:47:20,998 --> 00:47:29,898
So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name,

393
00:47:30,398 --> 00:47:33,998
please try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

394
00:47:34,598 --> 00:47:37,865
Go into a very dynamic force.

395
00:47:38,631 --> 00:47:40,765
So many people have complained to Me

396
00:47:41,364 --> 00:47:44,831
that Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

397
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:48,665
Is that what you are?

398
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:55,665
Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people?

399
00:47:56,565 --> 00:47:59,698
In your country have you worked it out all over?

400
00:48:00,398 --> 00:48:01,965
Just think about it.

401
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:06,431
And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna,

402
00:48:06,464 --> 00:48:07,665
you are not complete,

403
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:12,865
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

404
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:17,364
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day

405
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:19,631
that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

406
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:23,498
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

407
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:26,965
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

408
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,765
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

409
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:38,631
It's like any other getting any other realization – that's not so important.

410
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:41,431
Not only that you should spread,

411
00:48:41,598 --> 00:48:45,865
but also you should make them, and realize it.

412
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:58,731
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you;

413
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:03,865
but try to understand. All right?

414
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:07,331
Thank you very much.
