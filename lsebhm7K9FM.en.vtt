00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:04.708
It is such a pleasure to meet so many Sahaja yogis

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:12.338
from all over the world, and to be able to talk to them.

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:16.787
They understand Me the best, in this whole world.

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:20.228
It’s impossible to have a rapport

00:01:20.268 --> 00:01:24.778
with a person who is not a Sahaja yogi.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:27.455
Even if you give them realization,

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:30.434
if they have not become Sahaja yogis,

00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:34.333
then it is very difficult to make them understand

00:01:34.373 --> 00:01:39.234
the subtleties of their own being also.

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:47.003
Today, as we are all Sahaja yogis here,

00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:53.753
I would like to tell you about the growth

00:01:53.793 --> 00:01:58.644
of the being on the subtler plane.

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:15.183
All the time, as we have been doing anything,

00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:21.903
we have been thinking what is to be done?

00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:24.594
“What is to be done to be realized?”

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:27.234
was the first question people asked Me,

00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:29.694
when they were not realized.

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:32.444
“What should we do Mother to get realized?”

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:35.413
Then I had to tell them, “Nothing,

00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:39.793
just spread your hands towards Me, and it will work out.”

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:44.644
It’s true, it works out that way. Now after realization,

00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:48.353
you have to do something, as they say.

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:49.564
But still what have you to do?

00:02:49.604 --> 00:02:52.523
Again, the question comes in, “What should we do for this

00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:54.334
to remove this chakra, that chakra;

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:58.004
what is the technique, what is the thing?”

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:01.213
The trouble with Sahaja yogis as they are today,

00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:07.114
they are all technocrats already.

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:10.204
They have done so much of technical things,

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:12.174
that it is better that they should forget about technique

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:14.204
and worry more about spontaneity.

00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:19.793
The technique is so much, that the technique

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:25.814
has killed the spontaneity, and a balance has to be struck

00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:28.543
between technique and the spontaneity.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:36.314
First you get your realization by spontaneity -sahaja.

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:42.584
Then you have to have – naturally, by temperament

00:03:42.624 --> 00:03:45.814
you are technocrats – want to have a technique,

00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:50.364
the tantra, the mechanism, how to work out the mechanism.

00:03:50.404 --> 00:03:56.543
Thank God, we are not so bad now, otherwise, normally

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.763
I have seen, I was giving lectures

00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:00.704
and people were giving bandhans to them

00:04:00.744 --> 00:04:04.523
and raising their Kundalini – all mad people around,

00:04:04.563 --> 00:04:08.403
and others who were newcomers would be frightened at such Sahaja yogis

00:04:08.443 --> 00:04:10.103
that “What is the matter with these people?

00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:12.954
They are so abnormal.”

00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:18.114
And if you tell them that you should not do it,

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:20.054
you should just listen to the lecture, they would say,

00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:22.704
“No, no, Mother, we were catching, so we were trying

00:04:22.744 --> 00:04:32.104
to put ourselves right.”

00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:38.114
Now one has to realize that you have to become subtler.

00:04:38.154 --> 00:04:44.234
Then again the question, “How to become?”

00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:48.754
How to become subtler is the problem.

00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:52.944
For example, today, there was a question of having a puja

00:04:52.984 --> 00:04:57.504
in the morning time – today. They said that there is a

00:04:57.544 --> 00:05:01.694
Suryagrahana, means the eclipse of the sun

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:04.314
and if today is such a great date,

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:10.954
that if you do the worship or the puja

00:05:10.994 --> 00:05:15.924
you get blessings of thousands of such pujas

00:05:15.964 --> 00:05:20.334
on an eclipse day of the sun.

00:05:20.374 --> 00:05:27.644
Now, if you look at it, it looks very fine,

00:05:27.684 --> 00:05:32.304
good, yes it’s true, it is written in the astrological survey

00:05:32.344 --> 00:05:34.344
and all that – is a very great thing,

00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:36.564
and we start following it.

00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:43.954
You being Sahaja yogis, you must attack it from a subtler point.

00:05:43.994 --> 00:05:48.438
That is how your wisdom will also become subtler;

00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:52.059
your attitude also will become subtler.

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.549
To attack such a question from subtle point of view,

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:57.989
we have to first of all know that we are Sahaja yogis.

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:01.570
No technique is needed,

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.359
just see your vibrations on this question, to begin with

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:09.638
– it’s very simple. Subtler things are the simpler things;

00:06:09.678 --> 00:06:12.038
gross things are complicated –

00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:15.758
it is very simple, very simple equation.

00:06:15.798 --> 00:06:19.577
Simple thing is to feel the vibrations on this point

00:06:19.617 --> 00:06:24.978
– whether today’s puja, is it really worth something or not.

00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:28.238
You’ll be amazed that your right side

00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:31.788
will become hot on this point.

00:06:31.828 --> 00:06:38.738
So, this intellect, which is now being enlightened,

00:06:38.778 --> 00:06:42.208
prabuddha you have become,

00:06:42.248 --> 00:06:45.328
you must use it in a subtler way.

00:06:45.368 --> 00:06:49.818
Why, that for Sahaja yogis, it is not necessary

00:06:49.858 --> 00:06:53.858
to do the puja today?

00:06:53.898 --> 00:06:58.088
You have already become thoughtless,

00:06:58.128 --> 00:07:02.498
so I will not ask you to answer the question.

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:09.168
The reason is, as you are all technocrats,

00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:11.998
you are right-sided.

00:07:12.038 --> 00:07:15.848
This was all right thousands of years back,

00:07:15.888 --> 00:07:17.798
when the Vedas started,

00:07:17.838 --> 00:07:21.708
and the Vedas have given us the science.

00:07:21.748 --> 00:07:27.658
All the excitement about Vedas was all right at that time

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:32.188
when they worshipped the Surya or the right-sided things.

00:07:32.228 --> 00:07:36.018
In Greece, these things reached such a height

00:07:36.058 --> 00:07:37.568
that all the Gods had to fall

00:07:37.608 --> 00:07:41.618
just like human beings and become just like human beings.

00:07:41.658 --> 00:07:43.888
For them now, everybody has weaknesses;

00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:45.448
every God has a weakness.

00:07:45.488 --> 00:07:48.438
This weakness one has, that weakness another has,

00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:52.248
they don’t understand Gods anymore in Greece.

00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:54.618
They just think that they are some sort of entities

00:07:54.658 --> 00:07:58.558
with all the weaknesses of human beings burdened on them.

00:07:58.598 --> 00:08:01.338
So, this right side movement has been bit too much

00:08:01.378 --> 00:08:05.908
since the time of Vedas.

00:08:05.948 --> 00:08:09.208
Worshipping of Surya has been too much;

00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:10.958
you have worshipped too much.

00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:13.698
It was so much so, that Christ had to come on this Earth

00:08:13.738 --> 00:08:18.538
and tell people that you better forgive.

00:08:18.578 --> 00:08:23.398
His advent should have made people more in the centre

00:08:23.438 --> 00:08:26.928
but it did not. On the contrary all the Christian nations

00:08:26.968 --> 00:08:31.408
went onto right side and we Indians are also following you out.

00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:35.208
So, we are very right-sided people.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:42.378
All the Sahaja yogis today are, 99.9 percent are, right-sided,

00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:46.878
even Indians are.

00:08:46.918 --> 00:08:52.418
The bhakti people are lost; they are not yet here.

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:55.948
They are another mad people.

00:08:55.988 --> 00:09:00.388
They are going to this Pandhari temple,

00:09:00.428 --> 00:09:03.938
praying to God, they are in the churches,

00:09:03.978 --> 00:09:06.348
they are in the temples, they are in the mosques,

00:09:06.388 --> 00:09:07.488
everywhere they are lost.

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:14.248
So, those who worship the moon, worship the bhakti,

00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:16.658
the so-called love of God,

00:09:16.698 --> 00:09:19.588
are lost to Sahaja Yoga for the time being.

00:09:19.628 --> 00:09:24.748
More the intellectuals are here.

00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:30.268
Because they really lead others into another.

00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:36.778
They sound more sane than the other.

00:09:36.818 --> 00:09:43.458
But this movement towards the right is overdone.

00:09:43.498 --> 00:09:50.988
So now, to bring Sahaja yogis to normalcy

00:09:51.028 --> 00:09:55.648
is to bring them to the left side,

00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:57.058
as they are today – as they are today.

00:09:57.098 --> 00:10:00.388
That’s why I took you down to villages,

00:10:00.428 --> 00:10:04.408
where people are very simple, very loving, very affectionate.

00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:08.597
With right-sided people, the brain is so wobbly

00:10:08.637 --> 00:10:10.978
that you can’t bear any discomfort

00:10:11.018 --> 00:10:13.008
you can’t bear any discomfort.

00:10:13.048 --> 00:10:17.058
If there is any discomfort, you just can’t bear it

00:10:17.098 --> 00:10:20.638
because all your energies are spent in your brain activity,

00:10:20.678 --> 00:10:24.208
which is useless and thoroughly rubbish, absolutely

00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:26.968
creating nothing. But it makes you so tired

00:10:27.008 --> 00:10:31.068
that a slight discomfort in the body

00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:34.908
makes you very, very upset,

00:10:34.948 --> 00:10:38.838
and you can’t bear any physical discomfort.

00:10:38.878 --> 00:10:46.508
Now we Indians are so enamored by your progress

00:10:46.548 --> 00:10:48.668
that we are also trying to follow your footsteps,

00:10:48.708 --> 00:10:55.838
and with a double march.

00:10:55.878 --> 00:11:01.678
Under these circumstances, one has to think of those people

00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:08.738
who really love God. There is bhakti, there is devotion.

00:11:08.778 --> 00:11:13.168
They don’t think, they don’t worry;

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:16.868
they are blindly following God.

00:11:16.908 --> 00:11:19.988
They know there is God and they said,

00:11:20.028 --> 00:11:21.948
“We will meet God sometime.”

00:11:21.988 --> 00:11:23.347
Whatever mistakes they are creating,

00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:26.778
as you have committed mistakes with your right-sided behavior,

00:11:26.818 --> 00:11:29.448
with the left-side also, they are committing lots of mistakes,

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:36.328
no doubt. But they are to be brought in.

00:11:36.368 --> 00:11:40.088
You have to meet them, and they have to meet you.

00:11:40.128 --> 00:11:45.318
They’ll have a good effect on you, I know they will have.

00:11:45.358 --> 00:11:48.918
To become the moon now, is not so easy,

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.818
because once you have become the sun, rather difficult

00:11:50.858 --> 00:11:56.078
you have gone a little ahead.

00:11:56.118 --> 00:12:01.428
But to become the moon, you have to develop

00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:18.808
that shraddha, that faith, that non-thinking faith, that love.

00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:22.478
One may ask, “From where do you start

00:12:22.518 --> 00:12:24.518
when you sit for meditation?”

00:12:24.558 --> 00:12:25.678
I asked Modi what were the questions.

00:12:25.718 --> 00:12:33.198
“From where to start and where to end?”

00:12:33.238 --> 00:12:36.948
It’s all again technique.

00:12:36.988 --> 00:12:41.708
Only one technique I would prescribe for you people,

00:12:41.748 --> 00:12:44.118
every group requires a different type of a technique, you see,

00:12:44.158 --> 00:12:45.448
the kind of problems they face,

00:12:45.488 --> 00:12:51.198
is that you start with your heart and end there only.

00:12:51.238 --> 00:12:54.678
It starts from your heart, from your Atma,

00:12:54.718 --> 00:13:04.907
and ends in your Atma.

00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:14.618
Just give up talking about it, just start feeling your heart;

00:13:14.658 --> 00:13:19.148
just start feeling your heart, opening it out

00:13:19.188 --> 00:13:28.758
not your mouth so much as your heart.

00:13:28.798 --> 00:13:31.218
What do we do when we love?

00:13:31.258 --> 00:13:35.008
What is the sign and symptom?

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:39.868
I don’t know, in the West,

00:13:39.908 --> 00:13:47.028
if that glimpse of love is also there or not.

00:13:47.068 --> 00:13:52.388
But you can see in this country, still.

00:13:52.428 --> 00:13:57.148
Say a mother, if her child is sick.

00:13:57.188 --> 00:14:05.268
I’ve known My own mother, when My brother was very sick with

00:14:05.308 --> 00:14:07.618
typhoid, for twenty-one days and nights

00:14:07.658 --> 00:14:15.038
she did not sleep a wink, she did not.

00:14:15.078 --> 00:14:26.858
If you have seen that kind of love, then you can understand

00:14:26.898 --> 00:14:31.828
what wonders… she never thought of her comfort,

00:14:31.868 --> 00:14:37.678
nothing, what time she slept, what time she got up.

00:14:37.718 --> 00:14:41.708
She didn’t think of her food, nothing.

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:48.988
She was just wanting that her son should be alright.

00:14:49.028 --> 00:14:51.248
Now, they said that twenty-one days

00:14:51.288 --> 00:14:53.128
he has to be sick whatever it is;

00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:55.328
if you try to cure it earlier,

00:14:55.368 --> 00:14:59.168
it will have a relapse on him or some problem.

00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:02.258
So, twenty-one days, really I’ve seen,

00:15:02.298 --> 00:15:08.008
that she didn’t eat any food.

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:10.378
She didn’t know what she was eating;

00:15:10.418 --> 00:15:13.028
anybody who offered her food, she would eat little bit

00:15:13.068 --> 00:15:16.618
and then she would not; she had no desire left

00:15:16.658 --> 00:15:22.228
but to see that her child is cured.

00:15:22.268 --> 00:15:31.538
How much can we sacrifice for Sahaj Yoga?

00:15:31.578 --> 00:15:35.768
Then I’ll give you another example,

00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:40.717
which I’ve seen Myself in My childhood.

00:15:40.757 --> 00:15:44.097
Now Indians are very different people,

00:15:44.137 --> 00:15:48.108
but I have seen very great Indians in this country.

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:49.568
When the Britishers were here,

00:15:49.608 --> 00:15:52.178
they were another type of Britishers also.

00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:56.368
Now you don’t find them anywhere.

00:15:56.408 --> 00:15:59.788
Only thing, that Gandhiji said that you’ll get Swaraj,

00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:01.368
you’ll get independence.

00:16:01.408 --> 00:16:05.168
Swaraji is actually – swa means your Spirit,

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:07.558
and the reign of the Spirit.

00:16:07.598 --> 00:16:13.578
But when he said swaraji, he meant political independence.

00:16:13.618 --> 00:16:16.768
And how much people sacrificed for that,

00:16:16.808 --> 00:16:20.128
which they did not enjoy themselves.

00:16:20.168 --> 00:16:24.488
In My own family, My own father who had houses,

00:16:24.528 --> 00:16:28.628
cars, everything. He was a titleholder,

00:16:28.668 --> 00:16:36.178
he used to get his clothes stitched from England,

00:16:36.218 --> 00:16:37.777
everything was taken away from him,

00:16:37.817 --> 00:16:38.847
everything that he had, everything.

00:16:38.887 --> 00:16:50.148
And we stayed in very ordinary huts on the soil itself.

00:16:50.188 --> 00:16:52.938
There was nothing between us and the Mother Earth.

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:59.118
But what we felt, that our father was doing it

00:16:59.158 --> 00:17:01.858
for such a great purpose – we were very proud of it.

00:17:01.898 --> 00:17:06.237
We never felt we were sacrificing anything;

00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:09.987
we were very much respected everywhere

00:17:10.027 --> 00:17:14.257
and people offered us free things but we would not accept.

00:17:14.297 --> 00:17:22.687
Such pride that we are doing it, such a great thing,

00:17:22.727 --> 00:17:26.788
for our own country, for our countrymen,

00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:29.668
for such a wider interest.

00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:41.178
In Sahaja Yoga, you don’t have to sacrifice anything.

00:17:41.218 --> 00:17:54.658
Neither money, nor your sleep, which is very important,

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:57.967
nor your comforts, nothing.

00:17:58.007 --> 00:18:05.357
Everything you get cheap, you see this blessing.

00:18:05.397 --> 00:18:09.408
And what is promised to you is swaraj in the real sense,

00:18:09.448 --> 00:18:14.967
is the domain of your Spirit.

00:18:15.007 --> 00:18:18.307
The liberation of the highest type is promised,

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:22.977
which you have achieved.

00:18:23.017 --> 00:18:30.447
And sacrifice is zero. You can’t even sacrifice your time.

00:18:30.487 --> 00:18:32.587
On top of that, some people think

00:18:32.627 --> 00:18:38.437
that they are obliging Sahaja Yoga, specially Me.

00:18:38.477 --> 00:18:42.087
It is the absurdity of the whole thing.

00:18:42.127 --> 00:18:45.467
It was not definite also

00:18:45.507 --> 00:18:48.717
that we’ll get independence at that time – nothing definite.

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:51.697
They went to jail – my mother went to jail 5 times

00:18:51.737 --> 00:18:53.898
with 11 children in the family, only we

00:18:53.938 --> 00:18:57.148
and our relations, everybody, staying in the house,

00:18:57.188 --> 00:19:00.367
all still not educated.

00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:04.908
Now we are other way round;

00:19:04.948 --> 00:19:08.417
today’s politicians are busy making money

00:19:08.457 --> 00:19:11.567
– it is just the other way around system; other way around –

00:19:11.607 --> 00:19:13.747
it is just the other way around. I mean, I can’t understand

00:19:13.787 --> 00:19:18.827
from where these people have come.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:26.638
So, you don’t have to sacrifice anything

00:19:26.678 --> 00:19:32.658
nothing is to be sacrificed.

00:19:32.698 --> 00:19:42.028
Always, you get an added advantage in this way or that way

00:19:42.068 --> 00:19:53.518
you are blessed every moment. Count your blessings.

00:19:53.558 --> 00:19:57.087
And then, one should start understanding

00:19:57.127 --> 00:20:02.237
that these blessings are for us to become more loving,

00:20:02.277 --> 00:20:08.877
more generous and sacrificing.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:16.508
The idea that we are sacrificing itself is an ego-oriented idea.

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:22.807
What do you sacrifice? What do we have, to sacrifice?

00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:25.937
I mean, supposing I say “I am sacrificing,”

00:20:25.977 --> 00:20:29.577
it’s nonsense, because that’s My nature.

00:20:29.617 --> 00:20:34.298
I have to jolly well do it, can’t help it, I can’t run away.

00:20:34.338 --> 00:20:38.067
If I run away from you,

00:20:38.107 --> 00:20:40.627
My vibrations will make Me, bloat Me like this.

00:20:40.667 --> 00:20:49.908
I won’t be able to even walk. I have to give.

00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:52.367
In the same way, you have to give realization.

00:20:52.407 --> 00:20:56.278
If you think that “In my house, Oh, I do lots of meditation

00:20:56.318 --> 00:20:59.557
Mother, I give exclusively, I am exclusive” – finished.

00:20:59.597 --> 00:21:03.057
You cannot go further. You may have your own conception

00:21:03.097 --> 00:21:09.127
that you are going further with it – you are absolutely wrong.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.427
I allow you to continue with your myths.

00:21:11.467 --> 00:21:18.898
That doesn’t mean that it is true.

00:21:18.938 --> 00:21:25.008
People ask Me, “How many times should we attend the program?

00:21:25.048 --> 00:21:31.217
How many times should we meditate?”

00:21:31.257 --> 00:21:35.977
Every moment.

00:21:36.017 --> 00:21:42.607
You have to take responsibility of Sahaja Yoga now.

00:21:42.647 --> 00:21:47.597
You have to become responsible for it in your own way.

00:21:47.637 --> 00:21:53.638
You have to do it because you are doing it for the greater good.

00:21:53.678 --> 00:21:55.997
The more you think of the greater good it is doing,

00:21:56.037 --> 00:21:58.278
the better it would be for you.

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:04.577
All these are the qualities of the left side, heart,

00:22:04.617 --> 00:22:13.367
the Atma. Atma is all the time giving, it cannot receive.

00:22:13.407 --> 00:22:19.258
That is why it is untarnishable, it is unsurmountable.

00:22:19.298 --> 00:22:23.788
Who can surmount it? – because it is the king of itself.

00:22:23.828 --> 00:22:27.707
Nobody can dominate, nothing; no material wealth

00:22:27.747 --> 00:22:32.437
nothing can dominate it – it is above.

00:22:32.477 --> 00:22:39.557
So, to get to subtler life, “Take to spiritual life,” they say.

00:22:39.597 --> 00:22:42.457
But spiritual life means what – they don’t understand.

00:22:42.497 --> 00:22:48.398
And ‘spirit’ in English language – it is such a misnomer

00:22:48.438 --> 00:22:50.337
that for three things they use one word ‘spirit’,

00:22:50.377 --> 00:22:52.247
can you imagine? For the dead,

00:22:52.287 --> 00:22:57.127
for the spirit that they drink, and the Spirit that,

00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.997
so called, exists within them.

00:23:00.037 --> 00:23:05.727
It is absurd isn’t it, to give such a name

00:23:05.767 --> 00:23:07.947
one name to the three things,

00:23:07.987 --> 00:23:12.158
which are absolutely contradicting each other?

00:23:12.198 --> 00:23:20.038
So, to get to subtler life, one has to get to the Spirit,

00:23:20.078 --> 00:23:23.307
to the subtleties of everything.

00:23:23.347 --> 00:23:27.967
Now, I’ll give you a concrete example.

00:23:28.007 --> 00:23:34.918
You need not pull your ears for that – see to the subtleness.

00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:43.758
In Pune, people wanted to give you some presents.

00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:47.747
They said, “What should we give?”

00:23:47.787 --> 00:23:53.477
I said, “Give them the soil of Maharashtra.”

00:23:53.517 --> 00:24:02.138
Every particle is vibrated here – clay of Maharashtra.

00:24:02.178 --> 00:24:07.957
Last time if you remember, they gave you a incense-burning

00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:15.057
what we call – Dhupat in Marathi.

00:24:15.097 --> 00:24:17.107
I don’t know what you call in English,

00:24:17.147 --> 00:24:18.268
there is no name for such a thing

00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:20.047
but you know what they gave you.

00:24:20.087 --> 00:24:24.148
This time I said give some symbolic and I chose that for you.

00:24:24.188 --> 00:24:29.168
I wanted to see your reactions. What reactions you will have.

00:24:29.208 --> 00:24:30.727
It was chosen with a purpose.

00:24:30.767 --> 00:24:33.607
It is a very important thing you are taking with you.

00:24:33.647 --> 00:24:43.487
Is a very important thing, is vibrated clay from Maharashta.

00:24:43.527 --> 00:24:50.077
It’s a very great thing. Though in Pune,

00:24:50.117 --> 00:24:53.627
people are very miserly – agreed;

00:24:53.667 --> 00:24:57.187
they always make a mess of many things – agreed;

00:24:57.227 --> 00:25:09.617
but the soil is vibrated – is punyas there.

00:25:09.657 --> 00:25:12.347
And out of that soil, I wanted to find out something

00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:15.508
that would be symbolic.

00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:20.497
I myself went before the Puja to select it.

00:25:20.537 --> 00:25:29.077
Now, what you have made out of it is not so satisfactory.

00:25:29.117 --> 00:25:32.577
That is the most important thing, you are taking from here.

00:25:32.617 --> 00:25:42.788
All other things are of utility of a very gross nature.

00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:46.408
You may try;

00:25:46.448 --> 00:25:52.217
you can put a plant in it which will give vibrations.

00:25:52.257 --> 00:25:57.617
So, I was told that they were asked to send it by ship.

00:25:57.657 --> 00:25:59.668
It is very wrong.

00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:02.057
But if I give you a silver thing, you will carry it with you.

00:26:02.097 --> 00:26:11.447
Will you send it by ship?

00:26:11.487 --> 00:26:13.927
Nothing to pull your ears for.

00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:17.528
But to get to subtler things is to understand

00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:28.658
the subtler values of everything.

00:26:28.698 --> 00:26:32.477
It cannot be weighed or understood through money.

00:26:32.517 --> 00:26:36.148
Because in the West, you know,

00:26:36.188 --> 00:26:39.127
people buy everything as an investment, – everything.

00:26:39.167 --> 00:26:44.377
I don’t know how they don’t buy even their nose for an investment.

00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:46.547
Everything – they must be standardized,

00:26:46.587 --> 00:26:48.557
because it should have a resale value.

00:26:48.597 --> 00:26:52.987
I mean, imagine to have everything which is saleable

00:26:53.027 --> 00:26:59.388
means there is no feeling for that thing.

00:26:59.428 --> 00:27:02.477
They would buy even a certificate the same way;

00:27:02.517 --> 00:27:04.758
even the bed they sleep in, everything should be saleable,

00:27:04.798 --> 00:27:05.567
resalable I mean.

00:27:05.607 --> 00:27:12.967
And this is the curse of that country.

00:27:13.007 --> 00:27:19.447
In this country, it is not so.

00:27:19.487 --> 00:27:22.538
For them, silver need not be so much standardized

00:27:22.578 --> 00:27:25.317
and gold need not be so much standardized.

00:27:25.357 --> 00:27:27.587
Gold they may like to have pure gold

00:27:27.627 --> 00:27:29.888
because it is good for vibrations.

00:27:29.928 --> 00:27:34.288
But such standardization in these things – it’s all right

00:27:34.328 --> 00:27:38.087
for, say, bathroom pipes you should have standard;

00:27:38.127 --> 00:27:44.077
but for these small-small things there should be no standardization.

00:27:44.117 --> 00:27:48.528
Because they do not feel the vibrations.

00:27:48.568 --> 00:27:54.997
If you start understanding things that have vibrations,

00:27:55.037 --> 00:27:56.898
then you will be amazed that the things,

00:27:56.938 --> 00:28:01.937
that they look so insipid, so useless, not resalable at all

00:28:01.977 --> 00:28:07.388
you can say worthless, you can call it from all

00:28:07.428 --> 00:28:10.167
our standards absolutely worthless

00:28:10.207 --> 00:28:13.947
could be so much useful.

00:28:13.987 --> 00:28:16.268
Like one hair of Mohammed sahib, imagine

00:28:16.308 --> 00:28:21.557
one hair of Mohammed sahib; shroud of Christ

00:28:21.597 --> 00:28:24.398
shroud of Christ, but that also they are selling now,

00:28:24.438 --> 00:28:26.427
they are making money out of that also. I mean,

00:28:26.467 --> 00:28:32.577
thanks to these Western people, everything is saleable.

00:28:32.617 --> 00:28:38.687
So, once you start going to the subtler side

00:28:38.727 --> 00:28:43.888
of the physical things – not only aesthetics

00:28:43.928 --> 00:28:49.758
(aesthetics are also saleable) –

00:28:49.798 --> 00:28:56.997
but things that cannot be sold: you cannot sell your spirit.

00:28:57.037 --> 00:29:00.587
They should be the most precious things for you,

00:29:00.627 --> 00:29:06.138
which is the most precious energy for you.

00:29:06.178 --> 00:29:12.617
Our values are changed. We are different people.

00:29:12.657 --> 00:29:16.857
Which is the most precious energy for us?

00:29:16.897 --> 00:29:20.158
Is the living energy.

00:29:20.198 --> 00:29:26.408
The synthesized energy of all the energies is the living energy.

00:29:26.448 --> 00:29:32.158
But we believe in money energy or destructive energies

00:29:32.198 --> 00:29:38.727
or atomic energies, electrical energies, now petrol energies

00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:42.327
and all these points will be hit,

00:29:42.367 --> 00:29:46.648
to understand that you have to do without them.

00:29:46.688 --> 00:29:57.947
So, the greatest thing for a Sahaja yogi is the living energy,

00:29:57.987 --> 00:30:02.237
and the sign of living energy is that it grows

00:30:02.277 --> 00:30:07.367
and discards all that is useless for it.

00:30:07.407 --> 00:30:11.047
It knows how to work it out.

00:30:11.087 --> 00:30:15.658
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi should know what is important,

00:30:15.698 --> 00:30:22.697
what is unimportant. You are judged every moment, naturally,

00:30:22.737 --> 00:30:31.187
because you have entered into the judgment of God.

00:30:31.227 --> 00:30:50.957
This understanding of becoming subtler comes through love.

00:30:50.997 --> 00:30:59.417
What is love, is hard to describe. You can only enjoy it.

00:30:59.457 --> 00:31:05.437
I enjoy it, when a villager brings something so simple,

00:31:05.477 --> 00:31:08.537
and makes Me eat that.

00:31:08.577 --> 00:31:16.927
Like the small little fruits called ber were given to Shri Rama.

00:31:16.967 --> 00:31:21.417
Shri Rama Himself was born on the right side.

00:31:21.457 --> 00:31:23.967
Great example for all of you is Shri Ram

00:31:24.007 --> 00:31:29.008
who was on the right side, who works the right side.

00:31:29.048 --> 00:31:34.987
When He was born and He was a child… He is a Suryavanshi,

00:31:35.027 --> 00:31:38.977
He is the son of Surya. I mean Surya,

00:31:39.017 --> 00:31:41.258
everything comes from the Sun to Him.

00:31:41.298 --> 00:31:46.237
When He was born and was a little child,

00:31:46.277 --> 00:31:50.447
He asked His mother that “I would like to have the Moon.”

00:31:50.487 --> 00:31:56.367
He started crying, and nobody knew how to satisfy.

00:31:56.407 --> 00:31:59.937
He said “I want to have the Moon.”

00:31:59.977 --> 00:32:02.427
They gave him any toys – he’d throw away.

00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:05.638
They said, “What a child it is, funny thing…

00:32:05.678 --> 00:32:14.537
He wants to have the moon, now how to get Him the moon?”

00:32:14.577 --> 00:32:16.268
They did not know how to solve the problem.

00:32:16.308 --> 00:32:18.167
He said, “Somehow you get Me the moon.

00:32:18.207 --> 00:32:19.807
I don’t want to eat or anything, I want to have the moon.”

00:32:19.847 --> 00:32:29.388
Here the moon represents the Atma, the cooling capacity.

00:32:29.428 --> 00:32:31.667
He asked for the moon.

00:32:31.707 --> 00:32:36.667
You are all on the right side, so ask for the moon.

00:32:36.707 --> 00:32:40.908
Ask for the Spirit.

00:32:40.948 --> 00:32:43.437
And they didn’t know how to satisfy this Shri Rama,

00:32:43.477 --> 00:32:47.268
who was the incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

00:32:47.308 --> 00:32:55.187
asking for the moon of all the things, not for anything else.

00:32:55.227 --> 00:32:57.268
What is so important?

00:32:57.308 --> 00:33:04.518
So, the mother has always a intuition.

00:33:04.558 --> 00:33:08.947
She brought a… it’s a, it’s a maya, it is a beautiful drama.

00:33:08.987 --> 00:33:12.447
She brought a mirror and showed Him the moon in the mirror.

00:33:12.487 --> 00:33:19.008
He said, “Now you can get the moon here.”

00:33:19.048 --> 00:33:23.018
So sweet! And He was satisfied.

00:33:23.058 --> 00:33:26.687
Even the reflection of that can satisfy.

00:33:26.727 --> 00:33:28.487
You are like the mirrors

00:33:28.527 --> 00:33:31.947
and I want to see the reflection of moon in you.

00:33:31.987 --> 00:33:45.447
The love we talk of, is to be subtler.

00:33:45.487 --> 00:33:53.817
It becomes really subtler when you really enjoy.

00:33:53.857 --> 00:33:55.217
Like giving something to someone

00:33:55.257 --> 00:34:01.697
is one of the ways of judging it.

00:34:01.737 --> 00:34:05.067
When you start to enjoy giving

00:34:05.107 --> 00:34:09.607
– not taking, just giving –

00:34:09.647 --> 00:34:15.237
then you should know on material level you have felt,

00:34:15.277 --> 00:34:17.818
you have touched that shore of subtlety

00:34:17.858 --> 00:34:23.588
on material level only.

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:28.328
On emotional level you can

00:34:28.368 --> 00:34:31.097
– in India, I mean, everybody loves their children,

00:34:31.137 --> 00:34:33.107
I mean it’s a bit too much, going too far.

00:34:33.147 --> 00:34:35.227
I mean, they can even sell their country

00:34:35.267 --> 00:34:39.538
in the name of their children. It is going too far,

00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:43.338
their wives – I mean, it is a trip – their husbands,

00:34:43.378 --> 00:34:49.008
is a bit too much. The other side is in the West,

00:34:49.048 --> 00:34:54.288
where they don’t believe in all this nonsensical love.

00:34:54.328 --> 00:35:04.318
In between, the subtlety of love is that love a person,

00:35:04.358 --> 00:35:13.558
not with any reasoning, with any way of gain

00:35:13.598 --> 00:35:23.508
or any relationship whatsoever, just emit love.

00:35:23.548 --> 00:35:29.437
Whether you are recognized or not,

00:35:29.477 --> 00:35:34.738
just emit love is the subtler way of loving.

00:35:34.778 --> 00:35:44.258
That love cures people, that love comforts

00:35:44.298 --> 00:35:50.107
– that’s the comforting side, it comforts.

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:53.357
To begin with, we should see to the comforts of others.

00:35:53.397 --> 00:36:00.597
Self-indulgence is against that love.

00:36:00.637 --> 00:36:04.208
People would like to make My bed. All right.

00:36:04.248 --> 00:36:09.218
They love Me I know. But it must permeate to others.

00:36:09.258 --> 00:36:12.937
They love Me, and second they love themselves.

00:36:12.977 --> 00:36:16.058
That’s no good.

00:36:16.098 --> 00:36:18.677
Between Me and them there is a big gap.

00:36:18.717 --> 00:36:24.058
All that is filled by others. Who are the others?

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:25.748
Are the Sahaja yogis.

00:36:25.788 --> 00:36:29.117
We would never make a bed of another Sahaja yogi,

00:36:29.157 --> 00:36:34.948
out of love also- very difficult – it’s too much.

00:36:34.988 --> 00:36:37.887
But to find out the faults with other Sahaja yogis,

00:36:37.927 --> 00:36:41.407
“You got up very early, you opened the tap bit loudly,

00:36:41.447 --> 00:36:46.157
I couldn’t sleep.” This is a very common complaint.

00:36:46.197 --> 00:36:49.808
“They banged the door early in the morning, they made a noise.”

00:36:49.848 --> 00:36:58.298
Because your brains are out now, with thinking.

00:36:58.338 --> 00:37:02.117
You are so much strained here

00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:04.698
that you can’t bear any sounds anywhere.

00:37:04.738 --> 00:37:12.137
I mean, people can only live in a churchyard happily I think,

00:37:12.177 --> 00:37:15.167
if that is the situation.

00:37:15.207 --> 00:37:19.288
While in India, you see, we don’t mind any kind of noise anywhere.

00:37:19.328 --> 00:37:23.008
I mean, as it is, wherever I have stayed

00:37:23.048 --> 00:37:26.218
there has been a railway station around.

00:37:26.258 --> 00:37:29.437
We could hear all the shunting, everything going on

00:37:29.477 --> 00:37:34.347
and I enjoyed really all that.

00:37:34.387 --> 00:37:42.808
So, when we start comforting others,

00:37:42.848 --> 00:37:47.698
to give comfort to their physical body,

00:37:47.738 --> 00:37:49.558
to their mental body,

00:37:49.598 --> 00:37:52.758
that is also a very farfetched thing.

00:37:52.798 --> 00:37:54.907
Because to say comforting things,

00:37:54.947 --> 00:37:57.517
to say beautiful things to others, is regarded

00:37:57.557 --> 00:37:59.528
– I don’t know what. In the West

00:37:59.568 --> 00:38:03.508
it is very hard to find people who can find out words

00:38:03.548 --> 00:38:09.518
to say sweet things to others. Same in India,

00:38:09.558 --> 00:38:23.847
specially in Maharashtra. Marathi language can be very harsh.

00:38:23.887 --> 00:38:28.097
Speak sweet words,

00:38:28.137 --> 00:38:32.357
say something sweet,

00:38:32.397 --> 00:38:35.657
be kind and nice.

00:38:35.697 --> 00:38:43.578
It is so nice to hear that you are sweet to each other.

00:38:43.618 --> 00:38:46.597
When people come and tell Me that

00:38:46.637 --> 00:38:51.657
“Such and such Sahaja yogi came and comforted me,

00:38:51.697 --> 00:38:52.828
and was very kind,”

00:38:52.868 --> 00:39:00.528
I really feel Sahaja Yoga is working in a big way.

00:39:00.568 --> 00:39:02.917
I feel it in a very big way.

00:39:02.957 --> 00:39:06.157
You may have thousands of them, what is it?

00:39:06.197 --> 00:39:08.427
There is no quality there.

00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:12.498
Try to mold your Vishuddhi in a proper way,

00:39:12.538 --> 00:39:17.728
otherwise you will have Vishuddhi troubles, I must say.

00:39:17.768 --> 00:39:21.788
Try to use language which is extremely sweet.

00:39:21.828 --> 00:39:24.828
It doesn’t mean hypocrisy.

00:39:24.868 --> 00:39:29.867
No, you are great inside, you want to love.

00:39:29.907 --> 00:39:32.458
But there is a barrier of your ego.

00:39:32.498 --> 00:39:35.718
When your light of love passes through that ego,

00:39:35.758 --> 00:39:40.847
It gets falsified, it gets ruined, it gets spoilt

00:39:40.887 --> 00:39:52.318
and then you say harsh words to others.

00:39:52.358 --> 00:40:00.117
Try to be sweet, through your Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:40:00.157 --> 00:40:01.468
Once you start doing that,

00:40:01.508 --> 00:40:04.958
you will develop your witness state very well.

00:40:04.998 --> 00:40:06.927
Because, first of all, you witness yourself,

00:40:06.967 --> 00:40:10.117
which is trying to be nasty to others and enjoy that nastiness.

00:40:10.157 --> 00:40:17.367
There is a Hitler sitting in your Vishuddhi

00:40:17.407 --> 00:40:23.028
and that Hitler you start seeing, “All right, Mr. Hitler.”

00:40:23.068 --> 00:40:28.238
It wants to say something very harsh, you see,

00:40:28.278 --> 00:40:31.097
because that appeals to your ego,

00:40:31.137 --> 00:40:34.748
which we call as intelligence.

00:40:34.788 --> 00:40:37.818
You see our misidentifications are, you see,

00:40:37.858 --> 00:40:40.738
” You are very intelligent, very sharp.”

00:40:40.778 --> 00:40:44.538
That’s only ego, one of the agents of ego.

00:40:44.578 --> 00:40:51.038
So try to be sweet in your tongue.

00:40:51.078 --> 00:40:54.357
It is very easy to make fun of people

00:40:54.397 --> 00:41:00.198
for small things here and there, anything making easy.

00:41:00.238 --> 00:41:09.778
In Maharashtra, people are known for such a thing

00:41:09.818 --> 00:41:13.518
how to make fun of everyone.

00:41:13.558 --> 00:41:15.238
But when we start making fun of others,

00:41:15.278 --> 00:41:21.548
we also become a target of fun.

00:41:21.588 --> 00:41:23.887
English also are like that, very much.

00:41:23.927 --> 00:41:32.048
Everyone, I should say, but English are quite special,

00:41:32.088 --> 00:41:33.627
to make fun of everyone.

00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:38.478
Of course, Sahaja yogis are now realizing.

00:41:38.518 --> 00:41:42.958
Everyone has their own style of dealing with things.

00:41:42.998 --> 00:41:46.897
Like, I would say Americans are

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:48.468
they have no respect of themselves,

00:41:48.508 --> 00:41:50.647
no respect for themselves.

00:41:50.687 --> 00:41:53.518
I mean, they have no respect at all,

00:41:53.558 --> 00:41:56.708
for themselves or anybody else’s life or any…

00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:01.857
They have no respect of any kind.

00:42:01.897 --> 00:42:06.357
Indians are hypocritical, very hypocritical people.

00:42:06.397 --> 00:42:09.157
Like that, everybody has problem.

00:42:09.197 --> 00:42:12.528
Now you have become Sahaja yogis,

00:42:12.568 --> 00:42:15.558
you are no more English, Indians, Americans – nothing.

00:42:15.598 --> 00:42:18.818
You are Sahaja yogis. You belong to a great

00:42:18.858 --> 00:42:21.907
very, very great organization of God.

00:42:21.947 --> 00:42:26.687
And Sahaja Yoga is the place where you have to learn,

00:42:26.727 --> 00:42:37.357
in every way. For Indians have to learn how to be honest

00:42:37.397 --> 00:42:40.058
and English have to learn how to love.

00:42:40.098 --> 00:42:42.518
Americans have to learn how to be self-respecting.

00:42:42.558 --> 00:42:51.347
All of us have to learn, give up what we had, our identifications,

00:42:51.387 --> 00:42:55.078
and have to become subtler and universal

00:42:55.118 --> 00:43:00.927
and people of such values that anybody who sees will say

00:43:00.967 --> 00:43:08.318
that in America Mother has created Abraham Lincolns,

00:43:08.358 --> 00:43:12.528
in Russia Tolstoys, in Maharashtra Shivajis.

00:43:12.568 --> 00:43:21.698
I’m too ambitious, I should say,

00:43:21.738 --> 00:43:26.387
but I see reality in you and reality in Myself.

00:43:26.427 --> 00:43:30.867
On that basis, I say, one has to create

00:43:30.907 --> 00:43:35.627
people of that special quality which they have sterling qualities,

00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:38.637
sterling qualities, spiritual qualities

00:43:38.677 --> 00:43:44.147
which are so subtle, so beautiful,

00:43:44.187 --> 00:43:47.087
so sweet, so understanding.

00:43:47.127 --> 00:43:49.667
And still, just like steel,

00:43:49.707 --> 00:44:00.347
nobody can budge them from their own principles, tatwas.

00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:04.288
That is what it is, so simple as that.

00:44:04.328 --> 00:44:08.728
And then you start enjoying your love, enjoying your virtues,

00:44:08.768 --> 00:44:14.708
enjoying everything and having compassion for others.

00:44:14.748 --> 00:44:16.667
Then you don’t catch;

00:44:16.707 --> 00:44:20.177
you catch because you don’t have compassion.

00:44:20.217 --> 00:44:23.917
In compassion you’ll never catch, never.

00:44:23.957 --> 00:44:26.387
A mother never gets a disease from her child.

00:44:26.427 --> 00:44:34.078
She never gets a disease from her child, it’s a fact.

00:44:34.118 --> 00:44:39.998
Child may be a tuberculosis patient or could be any patient,

00:44:40.038 --> 00:44:49.097
she never catches because she loves.

00:44:49.137 --> 00:44:52.377
In the same way, when you really love,

00:44:52.417 --> 00:44:54.228
you’ll never catch anything.

00:44:54.268 --> 00:44:56.107
Then what is the question of what is to clear,

00:44:56.147 --> 00:44:58.397
where to clear, what to do – what does it matter?

00:44:58.437 --> 00:45:00.887
You are just flowing your heart.

00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:04.778
At this moment, My children, My Sahaja yogis

00:45:04.818 --> 00:45:09.377
are at that level that they can completely open their heart

00:45:09.417 --> 00:45:15.558
without any fear.

00:45:15.598 --> 00:45:19.377
It’s a very different stage you have reached now;

00:45:19.417 --> 00:45:23.548
you are at a different stage. Just assume your powers.

00:45:23.588 --> 00:45:29.367
Know that you are that. Just open your heart.

00:45:29.407 --> 00:45:33.677
Like, the other day I saw somebody, he was caught up very badly

00:45:33.717 --> 00:45:36.117
from all the sides – not Sahaja yogi, somebody else.

00:45:36.157 --> 00:45:37.298
And I asked him,

00:45:37.338 --> 00:45:41.268
“How did you manage to get so many bhoots into yourself?”

00:45:41.308 --> 00:45:44.978
Every, every guru you name, he is there.

00:45:45.018 --> 00:45:48.828
I said, “How did you manage?”

00:45:48.868 --> 00:45:53.968
He said, “I have a very open heart.”

00:45:54.008 --> 00:45:56.538
“Oh God,” I said.

00:45:56.578 --> 00:46:01.788
I said, “It’s like an open window in a dirty place. Y

00:46:01.828 --> 00:46:11.488
ou get every smell, every mosquitoes and bugs walking into it.”

00:46:11.528 --> 00:46:16.357
So, the fear of opening your heart to that extent,

00:46:16.397 --> 00:46:19.218
comes from that, from that experience.

00:46:19.258 --> 00:46:25.828
But now, you are at such a stage that, open your heart.

00:46:25.868 --> 00:46:33.568
There should be no fear; there will be no problem,

00:46:33.608 --> 00:46:37.818
material problems are not difficult to be solved.

00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:42.127
Like, somebody was taking My photograph

00:46:42.167 --> 00:46:46.198
which was in a silver frame,

00:46:46.238 --> 00:46:50.187
and she was rather worried because the customs may stop her

00:46:50.227 --> 00:46:53.808
not taking. Of course, photograph they can’t stop,

00:46:53.848 --> 00:46:58.958
but maybe the silver frame.

00:46:58.998 --> 00:47:03.187
And this gentleman told Me that he was taking it

00:47:03.227 --> 00:47:06.568
with him with a frame, silver frame

00:47:06.608 --> 00:47:09.467
and he thought people will object.

00:47:09.507 --> 00:47:11.798
But as soon as they saw the photograph

00:47:11.838 --> 00:47:16.815
they said namaskar to the photograph, forgot about the frame.

00:47:23.867 --> 00:47:26.818
So many problems can be solved,

00:47:26.858 --> 00:47:32.558
material problems – is so simple to be solved, so simple.

00:47:32.598 --> 00:47:40.468
Is the easiest to be solved, physical problems also.

00:47:40.508 --> 00:47:43.417
I have known of some Sahaja yogis

00:47:43.457 --> 00:47:46.318
who have been in Sahaja Yoga six, seven years.

00:47:46.358 --> 00:47:48.248
But still they are frightened about their body,

00:47:48.288 --> 00:47:51.367
their physical body, the troubles they have had

00:47:51.407 --> 00:47:55.488
and this and that. If they can just leave that fear,

00:47:55.528 --> 00:47:57.587
they’ll get out of it.

00:47:57.627 --> 00:48:01.258
It is such a vicious circle built in.

00:48:01.298 --> 00:48:04.347
And the same thing works out with our open heart surgery,

00:48:04.387 --> 00:48:09.637
as we call it. We are afraid that our heart will be again

00:48:09.677 --> 00:48:11.147
be caught up into nonsensical things,

00:48:11.187 --> 00:48:14.097
so we don’t want to open our heart.

00:48:14.137 --> 00:48:15.897
That fear I can understand.

00:48:15.937 --> 00:48:21.718
But now you are Sahaja yogis, finished.

00:48:21.758 --> 00:48:25.448
Ask all these people to get lost.

00:48:25.488 --> 00:48:32.177
All these fears, you should ask them to get lost.

00:48:32.217 --> 00:48:37.827
When you discover that you are the Spirit,

00:48:37.867 --> 00:48:42.948
you are that powerful Spirit, just try to steady.

00:48:42.988 --> 00:48:46.907
How it feels happy. It’s very simple.

00:48:46.947 --> 00:48:50.927
When do you feel really happy? Is when you give something,

00:48:50.967 --> 00:48:55.558
not to Mataji only. To Me you are, I know.

00:48:55.598 --> 00:48:59.808
If I take something from you, you will feel very happy about it,

00:48:59.848 --> 00:49:08.077
I know. But to somebody else; give some love, comfort.

00:49:08.117 --> 00:49:17.607
What a great power this voice and this vani has,

00:49:17.647 --> 00:49:23.847
that you can comfort others by saying good things.

00:49:23.887 --> 00:49:28.617
Can you imagine what a power God has given you?

00:49:28.657 --> 00:49:32.147
Without spending a single pi, you can comfort others,

00:49:32.187 --> 00:49:35.847
only by saying good things. If you say a vmantra,

00:49:35.887 --> 00:49:38.877
you’ll comfort them more in a subtle way.

00:49:38.917 --> 00:49:47.278
If you instill love of God within them, it is even greater.

00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:57.548
And the joy of that is so much because the Spirit is joy.

00:49:57.588 --> 00:50:02.038
The more you open it out, the more light comes in,

00:50:02.078 --> 00:50:08.417
more it works out. So give up that fear

00:50:08.457 --> 00:50:09.988
which is placed within you in your experiences.

00:50:10.028 --> 00:50:15.798
Now, this is a new experience of a new life,

00:50:15.838 --> 00:50:20.248
where your energy comes from the Spirit, which is love.

00:50:20.288 --> 00:50:23.708
In one word it is love.

00:50:23.748 --> 00:50:30.867
And in three words, it is truth, it is attention and it is joy.

00:50:30.907 --> 00:50:33.877
All put together it is love.

00:50:33.917 --> 00:50:40.837
When you mix them up, it becomes love.

00:50:40.877 --> 00:50:44.657
And that is what you have – it’s the great power of love.

00:50:44.697 --> 00:50:49.337
Through your attention you love others,

00:50:49.377 --> 00:50:52.728
even attention is sufficient.

00:50:52.768 --> 00:50:55.978
To be attentive…. see, I needed a handkerchief, all right.

00:50:56.018 --> 00:51:01.448
That’s true. I needed a handkerchief. I forgot.

00:51:01.488 --> 00:51:03.538
I mean, usually I forget all these things.

00:51:03.578 --> 00:51:10.488
Then they felt the need, “Mother needs just a handkerchief.”

00:51:10.528 --> 00:51:13.387
They brought the handkerchief;

00:51:13.427 --> 00:51:22.097
a very simple action, you know, but the attention is on Me.

00:51:22.137 --> 00:51:27.198
With little things like handkerchief you can comfort people.

00:51:27.238 --> 00:51:30.857
For a Sahaja yogi, even to give a handkerchief,

00:51:30.897 --> 00:51:33.478
itself is so vibrated, itself.

00:51:33.518 --> 00:51:37.948
To win over other people is also this way:

00:51:37.988 --> 00:51:45.508
to be kind to them, to give them.

00:51:45.548 --> 00:51:50.748
But to give them realization is the highest thing.

00:51:50.788 --> 00:51:55.397
Now, when you become subtler and subtler,

00:51:55.437 --> 00:51:59.677
you will see that you will not have sympathies with people

00:51:59.717 --> 00:52:03.427
who are afflicted, not sympathies,

00:52:03.467 --> 00:52:08.238
but you will have love for them.

00:52:08.278 --> 00:52:13.187
There is a big difference between sympathy and love.

00:52:13.227 --> 00:52:18.437
When you have sympathy means what? You share pathos.

00:52:18.477 --> 00:52:22.768
Pathos. If you want to share pathos, share.

00:52:22.808 --> 00:52:28.258
Very good idea is to share pathos.

00:52:28.298 --> 00:52:33.177
But if you want to share joy,

00:52:33.217 --> 00:52:38.397
you will not have sympathy, you’ll have love.

00:52:38.437 --> 00:52:41.927
You want to share your joy of your Spirit with another person,

00:52:41.967 --> 00:52:44.808
so you may talk to that person in a way

00:52:44.848 --> 00:52:49.137
that may not look so much pleasing and falling at his feet,

00:52:49.177 --> 00:52:51.018
and – you see, this is the work of politicians

00:52:51.058 --> 00:52:51.308
or business people, not yours.

00:52:51.308 --> 00:52:56.847
You are not seeking any business out of them;

00:52:56.887 --> 00:52:59.198
you want them to come to realization.

00:52:59.238 --> 00:53:04.288
So, you have to say things which are wrong very firmly.

00:53:04.328 --> 00:53:10.778
With a real firm hand you have to say,

00:53:10.818 --> 00:53:11.978
“This is absolutely wrong, absurd.”

00:53:12.018 --> 00:53:16.448
You have to convince on that point,

00:53:16.488 --> 00:53:19.657
on that if you go on saying, like this, like that,

00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:24.687
it will never go into their heads because they are bhoots

00:53:24.727 --> 00:53:29.827
and you have to hit them hard. That is also love.

00:53:29.867 --> 00:53:35.798
So, love is the strongest thing and the sweetest thing.

00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:39.337
Is such a beautiful combination

00:53:39.377 --> 00:53:43.397
and the one who has the wisdom, that subtler wisdom,

00:53:43.437 --> 00:53:48.318
can only achieve it. Now again the mind will work,

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.897
“How to do it?”

00:53:49.937 --> 00:53:57.218
So, I think all of you should put this word “how” into the sea.

00:53:57.258 --> 00:54:02.788
There is another very good word in English language,

00:54:02.828 --> 00:54:03.657
which you should use: “why not!”

00:54:03.697 --> 00:54:14.558
That’s the way you can assure yourself, ascertain yourself,

00:54:14.598 --> 00:54:21.607
work it out that way into complete blessing of God.

00:54:21.647 --> 00:54:30.587
You have to just pass those blessings to others,

00:54:30.627 --> 00:54:35.427
that’s all. Nothing more is to be done,

00:54:35.467 --> 00:54:39.077
just pass that light to others.

00:54:39.117 --> 00:54:42.278
For that, what you need

00:54:42.318 --> 00:54:48.857
is a man who has accepted love as his career,

00:54:48.897 --> 00:54:53.587
a man who worships love,

00:54:53.627 --> 00:55:02.498
a person who thinks love is above all.

00:55:02.538 --> 00:55:09.627
So today, to save the Surya from grahana,

00:55:09.667 --> 00:55:16.488
we extend our love to Him

00:55:16.528 --> 00:55:22.228
and ask Him to create love

00:55:22.268 --> 00:55:29.298
in the hearts of people who worship Him.

00:55:29.338 --> 00:55:32.917
Those who worship Surya,

00:55:32.957 --> 00:55:37.258
must know that Christ resides in that center,

00:55:37.298 --> 00:55:41.687
who was nothing but love. All His life He loved.

00:55:41.727 --> 00:55:45.357
He sacrificed Himself

00:55:45.397 --> 00:55:51.087
because He loved you so much that He wanted

00:55:51.127 --> 00:55:54.728
you all to get into the kingdom of God.

00:55:54.768 --> 00:56:01.738
He sacrificed Himself at the altar of God’s forbidden territories.

00:56:01.778 --> 00:56:05.008
He made it possible for you to go there

00:56:05.048 --> 00:56:08.887
by sucking your ego and superego.

00:56:08.927 --> 00:56:12.927
He is the messenger of love who was born on the Surya.

00:56:12.967 --> 00:56:20.107
So, to do the greatest justice to Surya is to decide today

00:56:20.147 --> 00:56:31.558
that you will take up love as your worshipping, as your Puja.

00:56:31.598 --> 00:56:39.028
May God bless you all!

00:56:39.068 --> 00:56:41.278
Any questions?

00:56:41.318 --> 00:56:43.448
Yes.

00:56:43.488 --> 00:56:58.317
Q: What about the Australians, Mother?

00:56:58.357 --> 00:57:11.177
They are rather safe people, but they have to be deeper.

00:57:11.217 --> 00:57:17.768
They still are under a shock, I would say

00:57:17.808 --> 00:57:20.887
that they think that they are away from the whole world,

00:57:20.927 --> 00:57:28.278
separated and they have to get into deeper ways of life.

00:57:28.318 --> 00:57:35.587
They are loving people compared to other countries, no doubt,

00:57:35.627 --> 00:57:41.907
but one has to go deep down, deep down.

00:57:41.947 --> 00:57:47.698
You have to be very deep, very deep.

00:57:47.738 --> 00:57:50.198
You should know that Australia was once placed

00:57:50.238 --> 00:57:58.577
between Africa and India. I am going to Perth, the African side

00:57:58.617 --> 00:58:03.667
and then to Indian side which is Sydney and all these places.

00:58:03.707 --> 00:58:07.258
But you must not be satisfied

00:58:07.298 --> 00:58:11.208
with all the Western culture you have imbibed,

00:58:11.248 --> 00:58:11.707
the Western things you have,

00:58:11.707 --> 00:58:17.238
you are not in the West, you are in the East.

00:58:17.278 --> 00:58:20.458
Because you are not on the West, if you try to follow them,

00:58:20.498 --> 00:58:24.067
it’s just mimicry, it’s very superficial.

00:58:24.107 --> 00:58:26.577
So, not the Sahaja yogis I am saying, but otherwise,

00:58:26.617 --> 00:58:31.067
the people, Australians are very superficial people.

00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:34.228
They drink much more than the Scotland people drink,

00:58:34.268 --> 00:58:39.327
I mean in every way, they are very, very too much

00:58:39.367 --> 00:58:42.548
and that’s how they are wrong.

00:58:42.588 --> 00:58:47.548
So they have to get to the subtler side

00:58:47.588 --> 00:58:50.988
by developing deeper understanding

00:58:51.028 --> 00:58:57.847
into the aesthetics of life, into the beauties of life,

00:58:57.887 --> 00:58:59.577
the beauties of language, all right?

00:58:59.617 --> 00:59:08.558
This is how if they go about, it would be wonderful place.

00:59:08.598 --> 00:59:11.798
English are very developed that way.

00:59:11.838 --> 00:59:15.488
They have lots of beauties,

00:59:15.528 --> 00:59:18.788
understanding of beauties, this thing, that thing.

00:59:18.828 --> 00:59:20.528
But they have become, sort of,

00:59:20.568 --> 00:59:25.448
they think they are the wisest of all, they are stupid.

00:59:25.488 --> 00:59:29.508
And they think they are the wisest.

00:59:29.548 --> 00:59:33.728
Australians, on the whole do not think they are the wisest,

00:59:33.768 --> 00:59:37.298
but they should know they can become the wisest.

00:59:37.338 --> 00:59:38.528
Because you live on superficial level,

00:59:38.568 --> 00:59:40.867
you see you think that everything

00:59:40.907 --> 00:59:44.377
should be tackled on superficial level, that’s not the point.

00:59:44.417 --> 00:59:47.948
You can be the wisest. As English could be, you could be,

00:59:47.988 --> 00:59:53.847
anybody could be. And as it is the Mooladhara,

00:59:53.887 --> 01:00:05.778
you should be the first to become the wisest.

01:00:05.818 --> 01:00:08.857
Maybe that the message of Sahaja Yoga

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:11.387
should start more from Australia.

01:00:11.427 --> 01:00:16.698
So, go deep into yourself. Depth must be developed.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:21.587
They are still very fond of the sea and the sun,

01:00:21.627 --> 01:00:24.067
this they will do all their lives,

01:00:24.107 --> 01:00:27.427
there’s no need to worry about anything like that,

01:00:27.467 --> 01:00:30.877
it’s nothing important. The sea is within you,

01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:33.238
the sun is within you, the Atma is within you,

01:00:33.278 --> 01:00:36.377
everything is within you. Try to enjoy within.

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:41.637
Give up the idea of going to the nature for it or anywhere,

01:00:41.677 --> 01:00:45.058
it’s within yourself, it’s all within.

01:00:45.098 --> 01:00:49.387
That is what I mean that if you look at things superficially,

01:00:49.427 --> 01:00:50.847
you take it from other people,

01:00:50.887 --> 01:00:54.437
now the craze of going out is finished in England,

01:00:54.477 --> 01:00:56.558
practically people don’t move out that way.

01:00:56.598 --> 01:01:01.738
Or they don’t go to the sea also to that extent.

01:01:01.778 --> 01:01:09.157
But, still in Australia, you have to learn all that.

01:01:09.197 --> 01:01:10.698
Instead of learning the hard way,

01:01:10.738 --> 01:01:14.627
it’s better to do it in a shorter way,

01:01:14.667 --> 01:01:20.067
is to become deeper and deeper.

01:01:20.107 --> 01:01:23.798
Cut down your activities, become deeper,

01:01:23.838 --> 01:01:28.397
meditate more than going to the sea.

01:01:28.437 --> 01:01:32.617
Sea visits are bit too much I think,

01:01:32.657 --> 01:01:38.367
also the sun bathing is also too much,

01:01:38.407 --> 01:01:40.238
is all very superficial.

01:01:40.278 --> 01:01:43.937
They all have liver problems, you shouldn’t go

01:01:43.977 --> 01:01:47.677
to the sun anymore, you should actually shut all your houses

01:01:47.717 --> 01:01:51.278
and sit down inside and meditate.

01:01:51.318 --> 01:01:53.808
What a problem we have of liver.

01:01:53.848 --> 01:01:57.617
So, do not treat any question superficially

01:01:57.657 --> 01:02:01.577
because God has given you, basically you are made of wisdom.

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:05.857
You know, the whole soil has wisdom in it.

01:02:05.897 --> 01:02:08.738
But where is it, do you find it anywhere in Australia?

01:02:08.778 --> 01:02:11.307
It’s hard to find wise people, isn’t it?

01:02:11.347 --> 01:02:16.728
Sahaja yogis can’t talk to other Australians, poor things.

01:02:16.768 --> 01:02:18.657
The reason is, you are following other people

01:02:18.697 --> 01:02:23.437
who are not all right. Follow yourself only.

01:02:23.477 --> 01:02:29.187
Go deep down, is wisdom there, lot of wisdom.

01:02:29.227 --> 01:02:31.827
Find out yourself, because you are wisdom,

01:02:31.867 --> 01:02:34.057
you will give wisdom to the whole world,

01:02:34.097 --> 01:02:37.627
it’s all like that you know, everywhere upside down conditions.

01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:38.847
In Australia, it should be wisdom personified;

01:02:38.887 --> 01:02:43.948
they are the most unwise people.

01:02:43.988 --> 01:02:46.288
They will always support the wrong type of people

01:02:46.328 --> 01:02:50.228
in their diplomacy. I mean all sorts of unwise things they do.

01:02:50.268 --> 01:02:52.407
Why? Because they have not gone to their own depths

01:02:52.447 --> 01:02:54.157
of finding out their wisdom.

01:02:54.197 --> 01:02:59.478
Like Maharashtrians have got Kundalini, they are sleeping.

01:02:59.518 --> 01:03:09.377
They are busy with this movement of going to this temple,

01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:13.187
for one month they will walk down to that temple

01:03:13.227 --> 01:03:15.807
and worship Shri Krishna there.

01:03:15.847 --> 01:03:20.008
They don’t want to see. And to add up to it,

01:03:20.048 --> 01:03:22.448
they take lot of tobacco in different ways.

01:03:22.488 --> 01:03:30.627
You see, even they use manjan,

01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:34.347
a kind of a powder made out of tobacco to rub their teeth,

01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:35.597
can you believe it?

01:03:35.637 --> 01:03:38.387
I mean teeth, which is Shri Krishna’s place.

01:03:38.427 --> 01:03:40.907
They rub it with this finger nicely

01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:45.468
and go to worship Shri Krishna there in the temple, absurd people.

01:03:45.508 --> 01:03:50.698
They take a little bit of this tobacco, to make it stronger,

01:03:50.738 --> 01:03:56.347
mix it up with a kind of a chuna, what you call,

01:03:56.387 --> 01:04:01.988
calcium carbonate kind of a thing and put it here

01:04:02.028 --> 01:04:05.718
near these gums which is also Shri Krishna

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:09.258
and go on singing for one month, not eat any food,

01:04:09.298 --> 01:04:10.847
do anything and go there

01:04:10.887 --> 01:04:15.998
and get their heads broken by these horrible Brahmins there.

01:04:16.038 --> 01:04:20.897
And this is Kundalini’s place, just imagine.

01:04:20.937 --> 01:04:26.587
Same in Europe which is the liver, which is the Nabhi.

01:04:26.627 --> 01:04:30.288
And they are the people who drink and eat.

01:04:30.328 --> 01:04:32.807
They consume more food

01:04:32.847 --> 01:04:35.327
than anybody else in the whole world can consume.

01:04:35.367 --> 01:04:41.127
You go to Spain, you are amazed, they can devour everyone.

01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:49.407
Then Americans, they also eat a lot.

01:04:49.447 --> 01:04:51.827
But Americans are, as I told you, they have no self-respect.

01:04:51.867 --> 01:04:54.278
No self- respect.

01:04:54.318 --> 01:04:58.557
They’ll give you five rupees and tell you hundred times,

01:04:58.597 --> 01:05:02.187
we have given you five rupees, five rupees, it is horrible.

01:05:02.227 --> 01:05:08.097
Those who do not have self-respect cannot respect another person.

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:16.038
And they themselves can be parasitic, very parasitic,

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:19.187
extremely parasitic people.

01:05:19.227 --> 01:05:23.988
There was an organization who wrote to Gavin,

01:05:24.028 --> 01:05:26.708
he was so angry with them. They said,

01:05:26.748 --> 01:05:31.298
“Mother is such a rich lady, why shouldn’t She pay

01:05:31.338 --> 01:05:36.427
for Her travel to America and also pay for their halls?

01:05:36.467 --> 01:05:41.317
We’ll give Her food.” So [ ] got very angry.

01:05:41.357 --> 01:05:46.198
I said, “No, tell them also I will pay for My food

01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:49.788
and yours also.”

01:05:49.828 --> 01:05:54.117
And also get some nice presents for you.

01:05:54.157 --> 01:05:59.867
It’s all right. And they asked Me that,

01:05:59.907 --> 01:06:01.518
I went to a church and they said,

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:04.288
“No, no we have to give You some money after all.”

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:07.577
I said, “Why?” They said, “It is a custom to have a collection.”

01:06:07.617 --> 01:06:09.948
I said, “No, please don’t have.” They had a collection,

01:06:09.988 --> 01:06:14.117
it was I think three dollar and two cents,

01:06:14.157 --> 01:06:17.218
three dollar, two cents they collect.

01:06:17.258 --> 01:06:21.708
I mean, no self-respect of any kind.

01:06:21.748 --> 01:06:27.097
They think whatever they do is all right,

01:06:27.137 --> 01:06:29.397
so ego-oriented, horrible.

01:06:29.437 --> 01:06:34.107
Always support wrong nations, always support wrong policies.

01:06:34.147 --> 01:06:37.107
Like they’ll support Argentina,

01:06:37.147 --> 01:06:40.427
Chileans who are horribly oppressive people.

01:06:40.467 --> 01:06:43.087
They have killed thousands and thousands

01:06:43.127 --> 01:06:46.577
of their civilians, simple people and just they are autocrats.

01:06:46.617 --> 01:06:49.288
All the Germans have reached there

01:06:49.328 --> 01:06:51.837
and the Germans are teaching them the fascism,

01:06:51.877 --> 01:06:53.887
the fascism is going to grow in these countries

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:59.927
and take over these so-called peanut people.

01:06:59.967 --> 01:07:04.738
But they will support them and not Cuba, because it is communism.

01:07:04.778 --> 01:07:07.917
All right, communism is bad, democracy is good,

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:11.347
what are you doing as democrats?

01:07:11.387 --> 01:07:15.357
You are supporting autocrats, always support wrong things.

01:07:15.397 --> 01:07:19.018
Made a mess in Vietnam, made a mess there, everywhere.

01:07:19.058 --> 01:07:22.528
They don’t know how to witness things properly.

01:07:22.568 --> 01:07:25.218
But they had Abraham Lincoln,

01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:29.116
so for that you have to excuse the whole country,

01:07:29.156 --> 01:07:34.708
but you can’t live with one Abraham Lincoln.

01:07:34.748 --> 01:07:38.948
These days Indians are horrible.

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:42.048
I mean, you can kill somebody here

01:07:42.088 --> 01:07:44.008
and can pay some money and get out of it.

01:07:44.048 --> 01:07:47.687
This is what it is.

01:07:47.727 --> 01:07:51.627
The politicians put money when they want to have elections,

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.887
so all wasters, all useless people

01:07:53.927 --> 01:07:56.508
are supported by business people here.

01:07:56.548 --> 01:07:59.298
The business people give money,

01:07:59.338 --> 01:08:02.498
the politicians fight elections and the whole

01:08:02.538 --> 01:08:04.837
is under the control of few business people

01:08:04.877 --> 01:08:07.127
who are miserly, horrible,

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:11.048
absolutely useless, self-indulgent people.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:15.107
And these politicians take over, they are wasters,

01:08:15.147 --> 01:08:19.128
briefless lawyers, wasters, useless people

01:08:19.168 --> 01:08:22.018
who have no brains, they become ministers,

01:08:22.058 --> 01:08:30.578
it’s such a mess, everything for money.

01:08:30.618 --> 01:08:33.838
Anybody who is intelligent, cannot have much money, is a fact.

01:08:33.878 --> 01:08:37.168
It doesn’t go hand in hand.

01:08:37.208 --> 01:08:41.818
A person who is a worshipper of Saraswati

01:08:41.858 --> 01:08:45.598
doesn’t get so much Lakshmi.

01:08:45.638 --> 01:08:53.927
Always, you will find. You talk to a businessman,

01:08:53.967 --> 01:08:57.568
immediately you know, something is little loose.

01:08:57.608 --> 01:09:01.118
That’s true with Americans also, little loose.

01:09:01.158 --> 01:09:06.918
And if you talk to an intellectual, you find something very tight.

01:09:06.958 --> 01:09:12.858
This is the problem.

01:09:12.898 --> 01:09:17.598
And because of this, the money-oriented people

01:09:17.638 --> 01:09:20.528
in this country are stupid people.

01:09:20.568 --> 01:09:23.638
So you have to play into the hands of stupid people.

01:09:23.678 --> 01:09:28.978
Now, this is the country where the Yogeshwara lived.

01:09:29.018 --> 01:09:31.677
Great saints lived,

01:09:31.717 --> 01:09:35.927
they didn’t care for all the styles and all that.

01:09:35.967 --> 01:09:39.458
What is the need for Indians to have all these styles,

01:09:39.498 --> 01:09:43.538
they should live well, they should be clean, neat,

01:09:43.578 --> 01:09:46.878
they should not be insipid, because Lakshmi stays here.

01:09:46.918 --> 01:09:50.338
But the way they are becoming modern, you see,

01:09:50.378 --> 01:09:53.688
wearing nylons and having stainless steel in the house.

01:09:53.728 --> 01:09:57.458
For them, when I told them

01:09:57.498 --> 01:09:59.538
that I am going to make huts for your ashram,

01:09:59.578 --> 01:10:06.208
they were little bit [UNCLEAR].

01:10:06.248 --> 01:10:12.628
We are not going to have cements; I know Australians hate cement.

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:19.058
We are not going to have cement, that’s one thing I am sure of.

01:10:19.098 --> 01:10:22.798
We can have stones, but no cements.

01:10:22.838 --> 01:10:27.068
You see, our ashram is going to be an ideal for everyone.

01:10:27.108 --> 01:10:28.968
It cannot be like any other.

01:10:29.008 --> 01:10:32.228
So don’t try to give Me examples of other ashrams.

01:10:32.268 --> 01:10:37.308
I am not going to take any hints from anyone.

01:10:37.348 --> 01:10:42.598
We are going to live in beautiful huts,

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:49.208
very comfortably under the protection of Mother’s love.

01:10:49.248 --> 01:10:53.208
So, any other questions?

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:55.098
From Australians, I had to drag in everybody,

01:10:55.138 --> 01:10:58.878
because I don’t want anybody to feel hurt.

01:10:58.918 --> 01:11:19.718
Never scold one person, scold at least ten then it’s all right.

01:11:19.758 --> 01:11:24.648
I am not going to say anything to him.

01:11:24.688 --> 01:11:33.368
Now what is it, what is the other question?

01:11:33.408 --> 01:11:45.008
What to do with France, Mother?

01:11:45.048 --> 01:11:51.268
I have already told you, France is a drunkard.

01:11:51.308 --> 01:11:57.688
And all the drunkards have no values left in them.

01:11:57.728 --> 01:12:01.948
They have no values about morality, no values at all.

01:12:01.988 --> 01:12:05.388
I mean, they are drunkards you see, no chetana,

01:12:05.428 --> 01:12:07.958
they are not aware, they are not human beings,

01:12:07.998 --> 01:12:09.698
they are drunk. That’s what they are.

01:12:09.738 --> 01:12:18.108
They are drunkards and they are supposed to be the Nabhi,

01:12:18.148 --> 01:12:22.678
the liver. Imagine, liver being drunk, horrible.

01:12:22.718 --> 01:12:26.697
But you don’t run away from France, all right?

01:12:28.321 --> 01:12:35.446
I know why he asked this question, they all want to run away.

01:12:42.438 --> 01:12:49.888
If you are a real French, you have to look after French people;

01:12:49.928 --> 01:12:53.458
it’s your duty, you are duty bound.

01:12:53.498 --> 01:12:56.188
If you are a Brahmin, you have to correct all the Brahmins,

01:12:56.228 --> 01:12:58.618
if you are Maratha, you have to correct all the Marathas.

01:12:58.658 --> 01:13:02.908
If you are really that,

01:13:02.948 --> 01:13:05.268
if I am an Indian, I have to correct Indians.

01:13:05.308 --> 01:13:09.319
I have to correct them; I have to bring them to the right path.

01:13:09.359 --> 01:13:14.228
Or should I also help them to go to hell?

01:13:14.268 --> 01:13:21.018
We have to look after them; they are your own people.

01:13:21.058 --> 01:13:24.698
To pull them out, even if you have one little bit

01:13:24.738 --> 01:13:30.958
of a sari in your hand, you can pull out the whole sari.

01:13:30.998 --> 01:13:34.588
Keep your grip there. That is wisdom.

01:13:34.628 --> 01:13:38.588
Nobody has to get out from anywhere; you settle down everywhere,

01:13:38.628 --> 01:13:41.008
I have settled you down for some purposes.

01:13:41.048 --> 01:13:45.338
Don’t have to shift; there is no need to shift.

01:13:45.378 --> 01:13:47.168
Nobody has to shift.

01:13:47.208 --> 01:13:55.368
What about South America, Africa, China?

01:13:55.408 --> 01:14:10.148
You see, I would suggest that all these countries

01:14:10.188 --> 01:14:14.248
are their part and parcel. But, as it is,

01:14:14.288 --> 01:14:18.358
we have many centers in our body, isn’t it? Not only seven.

01:14:18.398 --> 01:14:22.468
But we have to concentrate on first of all the seven major ones.

01:14:22.508 --> 01:14:25.308
So let us concentrate on these seven

01:14:25.348 --> 01:14:29.188
because we can operate also there, those we have already got.

01:14:29.228 --> 01:14:32.198
Once you start working in those countries,

01:14:32.238 --> 01:14:34.768
I will talk about that also.

01:14:34.808 --> 01:14:36.008
Because at their back, I shouldn’t say anything.

01:14:36.048 --> 01:14:41.388
When they will be here, I will tell all about them.

01:14:41.428 --> 01:14:46.328
Africa is, God save them. I don’t know.

01:14:46.368 --> 01:14:49.108
As it is they were very good,

01:14:49.148 --> 01:14:51.568
but you people went and put your ideas into their heads.

01:14:51.608 --> 01:14:54.968
So, they are lost cases, absolutely lost cases.

01:14:55.008 --> 01:14:58.228
I don’t know. They have such organized religions

01:14:58.268 --> 01:15:01.728
and for primitive people, if you give them any organized religion;

01:15:01.768 --> 01:15:03.088
like Indian Christians are.

01:15:03.128 --> 01:15:11.168
They are one of the worst people we can think of, the Jews,

01:15:11.208 --> 01:15:16.338
Indian Jews, Indian Muslims, they are extremely fanatic,

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:19.858
I mean extremely fanatic.

01:15:19.898 --> 01:15:21.958
Even you all Christians become Sahaja yogis,

01:15:21.998 --> 01:15:24.078
the Indian Christians will not.

01:15:24.118 --> 01:15:27.278
For them, dog of the missionary is also to be worshipped,

01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:29.138
yes, this is the case.

01:15:29.178 --> 01:15:38.188
That’s why I took My birth in that community.

01:15:38.228 --> 01:15:39.358
So this is what is.

01:15:39.398 --> 01:15:42.048
You have gone and converted them into Christianity.

01:15:42.088 --> 01:15:46.028
And there are, others are Muslims.

01:15:46.068 --> 01:15:49.398
They are very fanatic you see. A new Muslim eats

01:15:49.438 --> 01:15:53.818
lot of onions they say, because Indians don’t eat so much onions

01:15:53.858 --> 01:15:58.868
you see, so he eats more onions to prove that he is a good Muslim.

01:15:58.908 --> 01:16:01.458
That’s what it is. And you have harmed them very much

01:16:01.498 --> 01:16:07.778
by giving them Christianity, so called.

01:16:07.818 --> 01:16:11.218
I hope they will realize. The things will work out.

01:16:11.258 --> 01:16:14.708
We are working through Algeria; Algeria is taking shape,

01:16:14.748 --> 01:16:19.228
but it’s a autocratic country, all sorts of things are there.

01:16:19.268 --> 01:16:24.678
Let’s see, we have to depend on Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja yogis.

01:16:24.718 --> 01:16:28.357
Sahaja yogis more than anything. All right?

01:16:28.397 --> 01:16:30.897
May God bless you all!

01:16:49.148 --> 01:16:51.912
What is Anaadi and Anahada?

01:16:51.958 --> 01:16:54.588
(Hindi): When you become the Spirit,

01:16:54.628 --> 01:17:02.498
then nothing should be visible to you. You become that.

01:17:02.538 --> 01:17:07.218
When you come inside this, then nothing outside

01:17:07.258 --> 01:17:10.698
will be visible to you. The seeing of colors,

01:17:10.738 --> 01:17:20.168
when there is a movement to the right side of the Agnya,

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:23.298
then you see start seeing the colors.

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:27.748
The hearing of the sound or Anahada, that is talked about,

01:17:27.788 --> 01:17:31.278
this is also to be understood.

01:17:31.318 --> 01:17:35.618
The hearing of Anahad does not happen through these ears (external ears).

01:17:35.658 --> 01:17:41.878
When the ears inside us open, the sound of that

01:17:41.918 --> 01:17:47.178
is like the sound of sweet music.

01:17:47.218 --> 01:17:52.468
And that which is heard by external ears is not Anahad,

01:17:52.508 --> 01:17:56.688
it means that there is a problem of some kind.

01:17:56.728 --> 01:18:01.538
What this means is that either you have done lot of worship,

01:18:01.578 --> 01:18:04.363
for example, like chanting of the Gayatri mantra,

01:18:04.403 --> 01:18:06.583
then you will hear that sound,

01:18:06.623 --> 01:18:09.798
because by chanting of the Gayatri mantra,

01:18:09.838 --> 01:18:13.775
your movement is to the right side.

01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:16.489
Movement to the right side generates heat in you.

01:18:16.529 --> 01:18:20.096
Because of this heat, your nerves start getting dry.

01:18:20.136 --> 01:18:26.236
And when the nerves of the ear and nose become dry,

01:18:26.276 --> 01:18:29.912
because of this drying, these type of sounds start coming.

01:18:29.952 --> 01:18:36.842
That is entirely physical, and there is no joy in it.

01:18:36.882 --> 01:18:42.962
But when Anahad is heard internally, then in a way,

01:18:43.002 --> 01:18:45.252
it is not heard, but it is felt,

01:18:45.292 --> 01:18:46.232
for all things the rhythm manifests itself.

01:18:46.272 --> 01:18:48.472
It is not heard. Because of that a type of peace is felt within,

01:18:48.512 --> 01:18:50.630
a type of rhythm is felt within.

01:18:50.670 --> 01:18:53.401
Like when you hear some music, you start walking

01:18:53.441 --> 01:18:56.172
with a kind of a rhythm. In the same way,

01:18:56.212 --> 01:19:00.493
when the music inside starts, then it is not visible to you,

01:19:00.533 --> 01:19:03.952
but it actually happens in you.

01:19:04.437 --> 01:19:09.593
The rhythm starts manifesting in your talking

01:19:09.633 --> 01:19:14.578
and speaking, sweetness manifests. This is the difference.

01:19:14.618 --> 01:19:18.399
[NOT CLEAR]. Colors also should not be visible.

01:19:18.439 --> 01:19:20.170
Nothing should be visible.

01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:24.632
Understood? It has to be corrected, it will happen.

01:19:24.672 --> 01:19:30.040
I will tell you, it is because of the Agnya chakra.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.463
It will happen by correcting the Agnya chakra.

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:38.386
[English] She asked Me a question that you hear Anahad noises.

01:19:38.426 --> 01:19:42.039
She hears noises in her ear
