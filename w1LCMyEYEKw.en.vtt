00:01.960 --> 00:08.840
Today we are going to do the worship of Shri Krishna.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.600
Shri Krishna came at a time on this earth

00:12.800 --> 00:23.640
when in India the people were very much ritualistic.

00:24.640 --> 00:31.480
They had become slaves of the so-called Brahmins

00:31.680 --> 00:35.760
who had no idea about God at all

00:35.960 --> 00:39.640
because they started a theme

00:39.840 --> 00:44.640
that a Brahmin can have a Brahmin son.

00:44.840 --> 00:52.040
So the birth determined the caste of a person.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.200
Before that,

00:54.400 --> 01:01.480
it was not that a Brahmin would have a Brahmin as his son.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.280
It’s also true that if you are a Realized soul,

01:04.520 --> 01:06.960
in the real sense, if you are a really Realized soul,

01:07.160 --> 01:12.080
then you must have a child which is a Realized soul.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.600
And that is how also

01:16.800 --> 01:20.640
if it was said that if the father is a Brahmin, is a Realized soul,

01:20.840 --> 01:23.440
his son also becomes a Brahmin.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.120
Because you are a Sahaja Yogi now you can understand

01:27.360 --> 01:32.040
that a Sahaja Yogi’s son normally becomes a Sahaja Yogi.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.840
So it was agreed that

01:36.040 --> 01:41.200
children of a Brahmin will be called as a Brahmin.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.400
Gradually, it amounted to this

01:43.560 --> 01:46.240
that any child born out

01:46.440 --> 01:48.560
of a Brahmin was called as Brahmin.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.440
Now, we have seen that many Sahaja Yogis also don’t have

01:52.640 --> 01:55.160
Realized souls as their children.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.440
Maybe their own karmas,

01:57.640 --> 02:00.760
maybe the child, anything it is,

02:00.960 --> 02:05.120
but even I have seen some Sahaja Yogis having horribly

02:05.280 --> 02:08.520
devilish children.

02:08.720 --> 02:18.200
So, it shows that it is not through your birth

02:18.440 --> 02:22.680
you can claim that you are a Brahmin

02:22.880 --> 02:26.160
or the one who has known the Brahma.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.000
Brahma is the All-pervading power.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.520
So you have to be a Brahmin by your karma,

02:33.720 --> 02:35.360
by what you do.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.800
That is how we have got Valmiki who was just a fisherman.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.545
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

02:42.666 --> 02:45.732
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

02:45.853 --> 02:52.826
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

02:53.306 --> 02:59.906
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

03:00.466 --> 03:04.946
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

03:05.146 --> 03:08.146
who can only worship God.

03:08.546 --> 03:14.346
So to put another extreme

03:14.586 --> 03:18.546
to what Rama has created,

03:19.226 --> 03:21.466
to bring people into the centre,

03:21.666 --> 03:25.506
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

03:25.826 --> 03:27.906
and rigidity of ritualism

03:28.226 --> 03:33.986
and too much of fundamentalism.

03:34.306 --> 03:35.986
So to put an end to that

03:36.226 --> 03:39.026
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

03:39.226 --> 03:45.066
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

03:45.426 --> 03:49.826
So he started a new theme of,

03:50.026 --> 03:56.266
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

03:56.466 --> 03:58.866
that such a new theme should come up.

03:59.106 --> 04:04.066
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

04:04.746 --> 04:07.266
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

04:07.506 --> 04:11.026
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

04:11.226 --> 04:17.706
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

04:18.026 --> 04:20.426
So the whole thing is a Leela.

04:20.666 --> 04:25.026
And on this theme he worked out everything

04:25.346 --> 04:28.386
to establish that it is a play.

04:29.066 --> 04:32.026
And that is what you see in America,

04:32.226 --> 04:35.386
very common that for people it has become a joke,

04:35.626 --> 04:38.146
life has become a joke.

04:38.426 --> 04:41.106
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

04:41.346 --> 04:45.386
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

04:45.626 --> 04:51.506
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

04:51.746 --> 04:57.226
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

04:57.586 --> 05:00.466
But it is a myth with Americans now

05:00.666 --> 05:03.506
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

05:03.746 --> 05:05.546
you have to have realisation.

05:05.786 --> 05:08.586
Like if you are standing in the water,

05:08.866 --> 05:15.786
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

05:16.986 --> 05:21.706
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

05:22.386 --> 05:25.826
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

05:26.026 --> 05:28.106
by asserting itself.

05:28.346 --> 05:30.226
But if you're in the boat

05:30.506 --> 05:34.386
then the water that is around is an illusion.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.066
So it's the state at which you are.

05:37.346 --> 05:41.746
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

05:41.946 --> 05:46.346
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

05:46.586 --> 05:50.426
It is a reality. So what they forgot this point,

05:50.626 --> 05:53.666
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

05:53.946 --> 05:57.786
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

05:58.226 --> 05:59.546
thinking that it's an illusion

05:59.746 --> 06:03.746
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

06:05.106 --> 06:07.866
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

06:08.066 --> 06:09.426
this thing should be so

06:09.626 --> 06:12.986
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

06:13.186 --> 06:16.426
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

06:16.626 --> 06:20.426
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

06:20.706 --> 06:22.826
And some people go to that limit to say

06:23.026 --> 06:25.786
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

06:26.026 --> 06:28.306
nothing like a evil force.

06:28.586 --> 06:32.226
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

06:32.466 --> 06:38.306
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

06:39.026 --> 06:43.586
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

06:44.426 --> 06:48.346
In that play he was to be destroyed.

06:48.986 --> 06:54.426
So he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

06:54.626 --> 06:57.026
what not to be destroyed.

06:57.226 --> 07:00.666
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

07:00.906 --> 07:03.506
So to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

07:03.706 --> 07:06.866
Like even if you think everything is a play,

07:07.066 --> 07:11.306
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

07:11.586 --> 07:14.346
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

07:14.586 --> 07:16.106
like in a drama you sit down

07:16.346 --> 07:18.426
and you watch everything as a spectator,

07:18.666 --> 07:24.586
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

07:24.986 --> 07:29.066
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

07:29.306 --> 07:32.466
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

07:32.746 --> 07:35.106
You have a sense of discretion to know

07:35.306 --> 07:37.866
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

07:38.106 --> 07:42.666
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

07:43.186 --> 07:47.666
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

07:47.906 --> 07:51.066
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

07:51.306 --> 07:54.386
you're involved in it. So it is not,

07:54.706 --> 07:56.426
for you do not know the discretion

07:56.626 --> 07:58.226
between the tragedy and the comedy.

07:58.426 --> 08:01.506
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

08:01.746 --> 08:05.226
if you do your job well, then it's a comedy,

08:05.426 --> 08:08.306
otherwise it's a tragedy.

08:08.826 --> 08:12.586
So there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

08:12.826 --> 08:16.426
another of the one who is in it.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.386
So one has to understand in that light,

08:19.666 --> 08:22.546
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

08:22.746 --> 08:27.786
he was meaning for him, not for others.

08:28.346 --> 08:29.786
For him it is a play.

08:29.986 --> 08:33.786
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

08:33.986 --> 08:37.146
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

08:37.346 --> 08:40.146
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

08:40.346 --> 08:45.666
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

08:46.026 --> 08:49.306
So to him it was a play, everything was a play

08:49.506 --> 08:54.226
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

08:54.706 --> 08:59.546
So the first thing if you are

08:59.866 --> 09:02.026
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

09:02.226 --> 09:06.546
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

09:07.066 --> 09:11.626
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

09:11.826 --> 09:14.186
You cannot say what is wisdom.

09:14.426 --> 09:18.306
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

09:18.506 --> 09:21.866
Wisdom is a temperament,

09:22.106 --> 09:25.346
is a quality of a personality

09:25.706 --> 09:30.706
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

09:30.946 --> 09:34.946
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

09:35.186 --> 09:36.946
who are not traditional.

09:37.186 --> 09:40.066
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

09:40.266 --> 09:43.386
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

09:43.626 --> 09:47.626
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

09:47.826 --> 09:50.346
so he did not need any tradition at all.

09:50.546 --> 09:53.706
But for you, you have to understand from the people

09:53.906 --> 09:56.066
who have tradition what is wisdom.

09:56.306 --> 10:00.506
So we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

10:00.746 --> 10:06.026
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

10:06.226 --> 10:10.906
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,¨

10:11.146 --> 10:17.786
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

10:17.986 --> 10:19.826
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

10:20.066 --> 10:24.466
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

10:24.826 --> 10:28.546
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

10:28.906 --> 10:31.946
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

10:32.146 --> 10:34.706
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

10:34.906 --> 10:36.346
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

10:36.546 --> 10:39.786
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

10:40.146 --> 10:44.106
So because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

10:44.386 --> 10:48.906
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

10:49.106 --> 10:52.066
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

10:52.266 --> 10:53.186
instead of

10:53.386 --> 10:55.546
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

10:55.746 --> 10:58.346
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

10:58.546 --> 11:02.226
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

11:02.426 --> 11:05.466
spoiling the other chakra also.

11:05.706 --> 11:13.386
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

11:13.906 --> 11:16.226
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

11:16.466 --> 11:20.426
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.186
That's the best way to escape it.

11:23.466 --> 11:27.866
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

11:28.186 --> 11:30.786
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

11:30.986 --> 11:33.746
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

11:33.946 --> 11:37.666
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

11:37.946 --> 11:38.986
Now the another side

11:39.186 --> 11:42.026
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

11:42.226 --> 11:44.306
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

11:44.546 --> 11:48.866
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.426
So, "What's wrong?"

11:54.106 --> 11:57.826
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

11:58.386 --> 12:00.786
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

12:01.026 --> 12:05.426
So it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

12:05.626 --> 12:07.786
for example they paint their hair.

12:08.026 --> 12:11.426
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

12:11.626 --> 12:16.586
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

12:16.906 --> 12:19.306
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

12:19.506 --> 12:22.506
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

12:22.746 --> 12:29.226
They cannot even create a little ant,

12:29.506 --> 12:33.146
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.906
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

12:36.146 --> 12:37.586
So this is the right side thing

12:37.826 --> 12:44.106
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

12:45.746 --> 12:49.426
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

12:49.706 --> 12:54.026
that eyes are the ones

12:54.226 --> 12:57.066
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

12:57.546 --> 12:58.866
the power of Shri Krishna.

12:59.146 --> 13:04.386
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

13:04.586 --> 13:07.346
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

13:07.546 --> 13:09.226
if he has Krishna consciousness,

13:09.426 --> 13:12.186
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

13:12.386 --> 13:15.786
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

13:16.026 --> 13:17.466
should be able to cure anyone.

13:17.706 --> 13:20.346
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

13:20.586 --> 13:22.386
if it has Krishna consciousness,

13:22.626 --> 13:26.466
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

13:26.706 --> 13:30.986
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

13:31.226 --> 13:35.506
So on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

13:35.746 --> 13:36.786
When you feel guilty,

13:37.026 --> 13:40.026
they try to find out some method of expression.

13:40.226 --> 13:42.026
So they say they go to some guru

13:42.226 --> 13:44.826
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

13:45.066 --> 13:47.506
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

13:47.706 --> 13:51.426
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

13:51.626 --> 13:54.666
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

13:54.866 --> 13:57.186
you get completely caught-up.

13:57.386 --> 13:59.586
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

13:59.826 --> 14:03.266
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

14:03.506 --> 14:07.026
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

14:07.226 --> 14:12.426
who get anginas and also who get cancer

14:12.626 --> 14:14.786
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

14:14.986 --> 14:17.666
without the connection with the Divine.

14:17.906 --> 14:20.546
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

14:20.746 --> 14:23.546
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

14:23.746 --> 14:27.066
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

14:27.306 --> 14:32.466
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

14:32.666 --> 14:37.146
without feeling the power of that mantra.

14:37.826 --> 14:39.986
So in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

14:40.186 --> 14:42.946
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.546
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

14:45.786 --> 14:49.066
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

14:49.306 --> 14:50.986
They think they're very responsible people

14:51.186 --> 14:53.306
and do all irresponsible things.

14:53.506 --> 14:56.026
So when you want to spoil that chakra,

14:56.226 --> 15:00.226
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

15:00.426 --> 15:04.866
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

15:05.106 --> 15:10.986
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.786
When you start saying in the ego form that,

15:15.026 --> 15:20.226
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

15:20.506 --> 15:24.586
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

15:24.826 --> 15:28.666
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

15:28.946 --> 15:30.546
then the whole thing disappears

15:30.786 --> 15:34.826
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

15:35.066 --> 15:37.506
Islam is nothing but surrender.

15:37.746 --> 15:41.546
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

15:41.786 --> 15:46.506
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

15:46.746 --> 15:49.546
So you play the melody of God.

15:49.746 --> 15:54.026
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

15:54.266 --> 15:56.586
Every time you go back to discretion.

15:56.786 --> 15:59.226
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

15:59.466 --> 16:02.506
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

16:02.746 --> 16:04.346
Like somebody wants to drink.

16:04.546 --> 16:09.866
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

16:10.826 --> 16:13.826
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

16:14.106 --> 16:18.906
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

16:19.586 --> 16:24.346
So this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

16:24.666 --> 16:30.386
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

16:30.586 --> 16:33.626
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

16:33.866 --> 16:35.586
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

16:35.826 --> 16:38.706
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

16:38.906 --> 16:41.826
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

16:42.066 --> 16:44.746
And then whatever you do has a justification.

16:44.986 --> 16:50.226
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

16:50.426 --> 16:52.346
they actually robbed the other people of their land

16:52.546 --> 16:54.906
and now very nicely settled down.

16:55.146 --> 16:56.386
Now, when I say that,

16:56.626 --> 16:59.106
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

16:59.346 --> 17:03.346
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

17:03.626 --> 17:05.866
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

17:06.106 --> 17:08.506
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

17:08.746 --> 17:11.506
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

17:11.746 --> 17:17.026
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

17:17.226 --> 17:19.786
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

17:19.986 --> 17:22.506
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

17:22.746 --> 17:25.906
This is the way you face and not just to say,

17:26.106 --> 17:30.386
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

17:30.626 --> 17:32.866
But what are you doing about it?

17:33.106 --> 17:36.666
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

17:36.866 --> 17:40.386
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

17:40.626 --> 17:42.706
I said, "What did you do there?

17:42.946 --> 17:45.346
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

17:45.586 --> 17:47.986
at least you did not go to fight there.

17:48.186 --> 17:49.826
Why did you feel guilty about it."

17:50.066 --> 17:52.186
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

17:52.386 --> 17:57.346
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

17:57.626 --> 17:59.986
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

18:00.186 --> 18:04.586
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

18:04.786 --> 18:09.706
that we suddenly become a personality

18:09.946 --> 18:13.066
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

18:13.346 --> 18:18.106
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

18:18.306 --> 18:21.346
Alright, how?

18:21.706 --> 18:26.546
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

18:26.826 --> 18:30.466
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

18:30.706 --> 18:33.226
Both are headaches to the whole world.

18:33.466 --> 18:36.626
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

18:36.986 --> 18:40.786
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

18:41.106 --> 18:47.546
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

18:47.986 --> 18:52.746
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

18:53.026 --> 18:55.426
Children and father cannot live together.

18:55.626 --> 18:57.386
Mother cannot live with the children.

18:57.586 --> 19:00.666
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

19:00.906 --> 19:04.946
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

19:05.186 --> 19:10.066
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

19:10.346 --> 19:12.346
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

19:12.546 --> 19:14.826
There's no unison, there is no concord.

19:15.066 --> 19:18.746
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

19:18.946 --> 19:23.346
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

19:23.546 --> 19:28.986
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

19:29.226 --> 19:32.426
Even the destruction of evil is important,

19:32.746 --> 19:35.826
even the killing of the evil is important.

19:36.066 --> 19:39.506
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

19:39.706 --> 19:41.106
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

19:41.306 --> 19:45.426
and should have been put in charge of God?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.866
He's saved by killing him.

19:49.106 --> 19:50.866
Because he was destroyed,

19:51.066 --> 19:55.986
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

19:56.466 --> 19:59.746
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

19:59.946 --> 20:03.226
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

20:03.426 --> 20:05.746
evil is to be finished.

20:06.026 --> 20:07.106
So what you have to pray

20:07.306 --> 20:10.106
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

20:10.346 --> 20:14.826
all the destruction of the world,

20:15.026 --> 20:18.586
all the minds which build up our destruction,

20:18.786 --> 20:21.426
please try to neutralise it."

20:21.626 --> 20:23.946
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

20:24.146 --> 20:24.946
Instead of that,

20:25.146 --> 20:30.106
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

20:30.346 --> 20:32.466
That's not correct . You have to stand up

20:32.706 --> 20:34.626
and you have to say that it's wrong,

20:34.866 --> 20:38.226
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

20:38.466 --> 20:39.746
we have no right."

20:39.946 --> 20:44.506
So when Krishna told Arjuna that "You kill everyone

20:44.746 --> 20:47.266
who are related to you, who are your friends

20:47.506 --> 20:52.546
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

20:52.746 --> 20:54.906
It was Shri Krishna who said,

20:55.186 --> 20:59.426
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

20:59.666 --> 21:01.946
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

21:02.146 --> 21:07.226
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

21:08.306 --> 21:12.306
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

21:12.506 --> 21:14.546
which started killing everyone,

21:14.746 --> 21:18.786
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

21:19.146 --> 21:20.746
You have no sense of right and wrong.

21:20.986 --> 21:24.426
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

21:24.626 --> 21:26.906
First of all try to save instead of killing.

21:27.146 --> 21:31.626
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

21:31.826 --> 21:33.146
people are getting drowned

21:33.346 --> 21:35.506
and you find that you have to save the people.

21:35.746 --> 21:39.586
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

21:39.786 --> 21:41.706
There is no occasion for killing now.

21:41.906 --> 21:44.946
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

21:45.146 --> 21:47.626
What you have to do is to save people,

21:47.826 --> 21:51.906
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

21:52.146 --> 21:56.706
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

21:56.946 --> 22:00.146
You just move them out. Take them away.

22:00.426 --> 22:01.546
Have nothing to do with them.

22:01.746 --> 22:04.906
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

22:05.146 --> 22:08.786
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

22:09.026 --> 22:12.626
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

22:12.866 --> 22:16.546
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

22:16.786 --> 22:20.106
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

22:20.466 --> 22:23.466
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

22:23.666 --> 22:27.906
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

22:28.106 --> 22:30.466
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

22:30.666 --> 22:31.386
you don't take up

22:31.586 --> 22:35.266
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

22:35.506 --> 22:38.426
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

22:38.626 --> 22:40.746
I've seen people become very aggressive,

22:40.946 --> 22:42.586
they talk very aggressively.

22:42.786 --> 22:45.906
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

22:46.146 --> 22:49.986
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

22:50.186 --> 22:52.706
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

22:52.946 --> 22:55.746
Very common.

22:56.946 --> 23:01.386
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

23:01.826 --> 23:04.226
Then you start aggressing each other also,

23:04.426 --> 23:07.266
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

23:07.466 --> 23:08.386
You're not to aggress.

23:08.586 --> 23:11.346
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

23:11.546 --> 23:14.666
What is discretion is diplomacy.

23:14.946 --> 23:18.066
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

23:18.306 --> 23:20.346
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

23:20.546 --> 23:22.266
this man is dangerous,

23:22.506 --> 23:23.866
he is troubling you,

23:24.066 --> 23:25.746
now if you have a proper sense,

23:25.946 --> 23:29.386
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

23:29.626 --> 23:34.426
that there won't be any more discussion, or destruction.

23:34.626 --> 23:39.266
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

23:39.506 --> 23:42.226
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

23:42.466 --> 23:46.786
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

23:47.146 --> 23:49.146
So must have discretion, must understand.

23:49.346 --> 23:52.346
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

23:52.546 --> 23:54.426
where you find somebody is telling you,

23:54.626 --> 23:57.346
"You see, this person has said this about you."

23:57.586 --> 24:00.066
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

24:00.306 --> 24:02.786
"That person has said this about you."

24:02.986 --> 24:04.706
Then you start quarelling.

24:04.906 --> 24:09.066
Instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

24:09.226 --> 24:12.186
"Why, why this is happening,

24:12.426 --> 24:14.866
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

24:15.106 --> 24:16.666
We were friends, what has happened?"

24:16.866 --> 24:19.786
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

24:19.986 --> 24:26.346
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

24:26.586 --> 24:31.346
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

24:31.586 --> 24:33.626
delicate, beautiful.

24:33.826 --> 24:37.506
Nobody should notice

24:37.706 --> 24:43.786
that you have been in any way effective,

24:45.386 --> 24:47.706
and that's how you'll work it out.

24:47.906 --> 24:50.746
So the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

24:50.946 --> 24:54.506
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

24:54.906 --> 24:57.386
So he plays.

24:57.586 --> 24:59.626
Give you an example how he plays.

24:59.826 --> 25:05.186
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

25:05.586 --> 25:10.666
who had a blessing from Shiva

25:10.906 --> 25:16.986
that nobody can kill him.

25:17.986 --> 25:23.786
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

25:24.146 --> 25:27.546
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

25:27.986 --> 25:32.466
So there was a saint who had a blessing

25:32.786 --> 25:36.386
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

25:36.586 --> 25:40.506
sleep in your yoga sleep,

25:40.706 --> 25:43.586
and once you open your eyes

25:43.786 --> 25:49.266
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

25:51.506 --> 25:54.746
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

25:55.026 --> 25:57.906
He was fighting this devil

25:58.106 --> 26:01.786
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

26:01.986 --> 26:05.826
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

26:06.226 --> 26:08.986
So he started running away from the field,

26:09.226 --> 26:11.226
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

26:11.426 --> 26:13.986
the one who runs away from the battle field,

26:14.226 --> 26:16.826
is regarded as something really derogatory,

26:17.026 --> 26:20.666
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

26:20.906 --> 26:21.786
So he didn't mind,

26:21.986 --> 26:25.626
he ran away and then this devil started following him

26:25.826 --> 26:26.946
And he went into the cave

26:27.146 --> 26:31.306
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

26:31.946 --> 26:34.906
And he removed his shawl

26:35.106 --> 26:39.226
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

26:39.506 --> 26:41.186
and hid himself.

26:41.426 --> 26:43.466
So this rakshasa came behind him.

26:43.666 --> 26:47.346
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

26:47.586 --> 26:51.226
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

26:51.466 --> 26:53.506
Come along now, open your eyes!"

26:53.746 --> 26:59.706
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

26:59.946 --> 27:02.746
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

27:02.946 --> 27:05.986
and he just was burnt.

27:08.986 --> 27:12.786
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

27:13.066 --> 27:16.386
That is the sign of diplomacy.

27:16.586 --> 27:21.786
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

27:21.986 --> 27:24.586
the whole discretion, what he should do,

27:24.786 --> 27:26.506
what is right, what is wrong,

27:26.746 --> 27:30.306
is he doesn't have this problem.

27:30.586 --> 27:35.426
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

27:35.666 --> 27:37.146
So he played a trick .

27:37.346 --> 27:43.106
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

27:43.666 --> 27:49.346
And he made one king - you see-

27:50.306 --> 27:57.586
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

27:57.786 --> 28:00.306
But he could never touch them.

28:00.506 --> 28:03.346
So Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

28:03.546 --> 28:05.466
He has to have justification also,

28:05.666 --> 28:08.266
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

28:08.586 --> 28:11.146
So he killed this king, brought all these women

28:11.386 --> 28:17.226
and they all became his wives, so-called.

28:18.786 --> 28:20.906
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

28:21.106 --> 28:23.626
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

28:23.826 --> 28:27.066
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

28:27.346 --> 28:30.266
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

28:30.546 --> 28:34.546
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

28:34.786 --> 28:38.226
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

28:38.426 --> 28:42.586
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

28:42.786 --> 28:46.906
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

28:47.146 --> 28:50.226
meaning the power of creation,

28:50.466 --> 28:52.546
because creation has been done already.

28:52.786 --> 28:55.746
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

28:55.946 --> 28:57.786
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.946
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

29:00.146 --> 29:03.386
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

29:03.586 --> 29:06.586
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

29:06.826 --> 29:09.946
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

29:10.186 --> 29:11.906
and she opens her left side.

29:12.146 --> 29:13.986
And in front of her

29:14.226 --> 29:18.226
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

29:18.466 --> 29:21.106
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

29:21.306 --> 29:23.586
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

29:23.786 --> 29:28.026
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

29:28.226 --> 29:31.146
But in this one, the one that they have here

29:31.386 --> 29:33.306
is the child is kept underneath this,

29:33.546 --> 29:36.826
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

29:37.026 --> 29:41.026
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

29:41.226 --> 29:44.026
So I'll tell you the last story about her

29:44.226 --> 29:50.666
which will conclude this talk about

29:50.906 --> 29:52.626
Radha and Shri Krishna.

29:52.866 --> 29:55.306
That one day,

29:56.106 --> 30:01.746
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

30:01.986 --> 30:03.706
and Narada said, "See,

30:03.946 --> 30:06.426
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

30:06.626 --> 30:08.906
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

30:09.106 --> 30:13.746
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

30:13.986 --> 30:18.666
So the rumour, you see, went into the women.

30:18.906 --> 30:22.626
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

30:22.826 --> 30:25.866
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

30:26.066 --> 30:28.986
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

30:29.186 --> 30:30.866
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

30:31.066 --> 30:34.146
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

30:34.346 --> 30:35.746
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

30:35.946 --> 30:39.666
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

30:39.866 --> 30:41.626
so don't listen to him."

30:41.826 --> 30:43.946
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

30:44.186 --> 30:45.746
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

30:45.946 --> 30:47.906
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

30:48.106 --> 30:51.466
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

30:51.666 --> 30:55.226
They said, "What's the matter, what sort of a pain it is,

30:55.466 --> 30:58.426
what can we do to overcome this pain."

30:58.626 --> 31:00.386
He said, "There's very simple thing that

31:00.586 --> 31:05.306
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

31:05.546 --> 31:09.066
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

31:09.306 --> 31:10.866
then I'll be saved."

31:11.066 --> 31:14.506
So these ladies used their brains. They said that

31:14.706 --> 31:16.226
"Already he doesn't love us

31:16.466 --> 31:18.466
and then if we give him the dust of our feet

31:18.666 --> 31:22.426
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

31:22.626 --> 31:25.506
So what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

31:25.706 --> 31:27.146
it's better to forget about it."

31:27.346 --> 31:29.666
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

31:29.866 --> 31:33.266
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

31:33.466 --> 31:36.466
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

31:36.666 --> 31:39.706
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

31:39.906 --> 31:42.186
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

31:42.426 --> 31:44.706
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

31:44.906 --> 31:47.266
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

31:47.466 --> 31:50.106
and this is the medicine." So he went to Radhaji

31:50.306 --> 31:53.346
and he said to her that,

31:53.546 --> 31:56.626
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

31:56.826 --> 32:01.826
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

32:02.386 --> 32:04.866
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

32:05.186 --> 32:07.906
for that pain, of course, why not?"

32:08.706 --> 32:14.346
So he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

32:14.586 --> 32:16.546
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

32:16.786 --> 32:18.866
She said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

32:19.106 --> 32:20.866
he has no sense of sin at all.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.146
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

32:23.386 --> 32:24.706
what am I to worry about sins.

32:24.906 --> 32:28.066
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

32:28.266 --> 32:29.386
this is his worry."

32:29.666 --> 32:32.186
So he took the dust of Radha's feet

32:32.386 --> 32:34.706
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

32:34.946 --> 32:37.746
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

32:37.946 --> 32:40.106
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

32:40.346 --> 32:43.626
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

32:43.866 --> 32:46.706
He said, "That I know." So he said, "But how do you explain it?"

32:46.906 --> 32:48.626
He said, "You'll understand just now."

32:48.906 --> 32:51.186
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

32:51.426 --> 32:56.426
you see Radha's feet were dusted

32:56.626 --> 32:58.626
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

32:58.826 --> 33:05.066
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

33:05.266 --> 33:07.746
you see, the soil is yellowish

33:07.946 --> 33:12.106
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

33:12.306 --> 33:14.586
which she removed and took it.

33:14.786 --> 33:19.826
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

33:20.306 --> 33:23.866
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

33:24.066 --> 33:28.826
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

33:29.066 --> 33:31.106
on the lotus of his heart.

33:31.306 --> 33:37.306
The lotus had the pollen,

33:37.786 --> 33:39.826
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

33:40.026 --> 33:41.706
and was making it yellow.

33:42.026 --> 33:45.426
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

33:45.626 --> 33:51.626
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

33:53.746 --> 33:58.266
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

33:58.506 --> 34:01.466
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.026
They have to be Radha to understand him.

34:05.266 --> 34:07.506
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

34:07.746 --> 34:10.466
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

34:10.706 --> 34:16.346
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

34:16.546 --> 34:19.746
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

34:20.026 --> 34:23.146
So he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

34:23.386 --> 34:25.946
give him the the power and everybody danced.

34:26.186 --> 34:29.746
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

34:30.026 --> 34:33.466
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

34:33.666 --> 34:37.706
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

34:37.946 --> 34:39.786
For a minute you abandon everything."

34:40.026 --> 34:42.866
And that abandonment has now become a,

34:43.106 --> 34:44.986
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

34:45.186 --> 34:48.986
here it has become a year-long Holi.

34:49.226 --> 34:51.066
So people are busy with a year-long Holi

34:51.266 --> 34:52.946
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

34:53.186 --> 34:56.426
So what will be the situation of such a place?

34:56.626 --> 34:59.226
And that's why I think, what happens that

34:59.426 --> 35:03.306
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

35:03.546 --> 35:06.546
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

35:06.786 --> 35:09.786
And once they get into you, you get funny,

35:09.986 --> 35:11.506
you don't know why you behave like this,

35:11.706 --> 35:14.066
why things work out that way.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.226
This is why we have to understand

35:16.426 --> 35:19.066
that we have to be attractive to God.

35:19.306 --> 35:23.626
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

35:23.906 --> 35:27.626
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

35:28.106 --> 35:30.786
So May God Bless You.
