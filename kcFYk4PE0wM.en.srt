1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:22,718
Today is the day of worshipping your guru:

2
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:25,425
that is your Mother.

3
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:30,742
And as I told you, it’s a very unique
happening

4
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:34,040
that Mother, Herself, has to become your
Guru.

5
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:40,510
And also you know that it is a very
difficult task for a Mother to be a guru,

6
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:49,243
because her love is so overflowing

7
00:00:49,444 --> 00:00:56,132
that it is difficult for Her to give any
discipline to Her children.

8
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:58,764
She cannot discipline her own love,

9
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:02,663
how can she discipline her own children?

10
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:10,710
Being [like] that, the responsibility
on the disciples is much more.

11
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:19,246
If the guru is a person who can discipline
you

12
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:30,984
without feeling anything hurting to him,

13
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:36,916
he is much more capable, and he can do it.

14
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:45,289
But for a Mother it is a very, very, very
difficult,

15
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:58,469
I must say, a very difficult job to be
the guru.

16
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,448
She does not know how to balance,

17
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,947
and She is extremely forgiving because
She is the Mother.

18
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:12,912
While the guru, from the very beginning,
does not forgive.

19
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:17,854
But mother, till the end, she’ll go
to the last end.

20
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:23,099
Even if the child has forsaken her, even
if he has beaten her up,

21
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,410
even if he’s willing to kill her, still she
will be saying that,

22
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:31,750
“My child, are you hurt?”

23
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,266
Then the responsibility of the disciples is
much more,

24
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:43,564
to see that they do not hurt Her,

25
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,417
and they do not take my love for granted.

26
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:50,715
For they must know that they have
to prove themselves

27
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,766
and they have to improve themselves.

28
00:02:56,364 --> 00:03:00,451
That is why this day is a very unique
combination

29
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:05,533
of tremendous love overflowing me,

30
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:13,471
and also the thought, I would say,
the divine inspiration,

31
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,950
that tells me that you have to be
disciplined.

32
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:24,712
You have to be disciplined sahaja, not
by another person.

33
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:32,411
That has to be, because if a ship is not
properly tied up

34
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:39,130
and it is not seaworthy it cannot go very
far.

35
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:51,062
If you want to enjoy the ride in the ocean
of His grace

36
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:57,096
and compassion, His bliss and kindness,

37
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:03,554
then you must build up yourself fully.

38
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:09,089
Now we have seen we have chakras, and we
can excite them,

39
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,319
we can awaken them by awakening
the Deities.

40
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,701
But is it not a mechanical process.

41
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:21,232
Deity has got a subtle point behind it,

42
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:26,737
which is a very subtle being within you.

43
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,554
You know them, one by one. And you know
why these chakras are catching —

44
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:39,250
because you lack that thing.

45
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:42,755
There’s nothing to feel bad about it.
As I told you

46
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:46,645
this is like your motor car outside. This
is your instrument.

47
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:52,098
But the instrument has to be properly
harmonised and cleaned.

48
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:57,417
Today I want certain promises by you
to be made.

49
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:00,833
And the foremost of all,

50
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,369
as Christ has said, “Love thy neighbour
as thyself.”

51
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,702
I would say, one step ahead of that:

52
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:17,498
“Love thy neighbour, a Sahaj Yogi, more
than yourself.”

53
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:28,572
Let us start here. I don’t ask you to do
for the whole universe: among yourselves.

54
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:33,583
First of all decide: what have you done
for others?

55
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:38,292
Second promise you have to make that you
will never say a harsh word

56
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:45,224
to any other sahaj yogi, even if he beats
you hollow.

57
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:48,725
You can tell me about it.

58
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:52,925
That is the greatest sin you would be
committing from today.

59
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:56,463
Don’t try to correct others!

60
00:05:56,664 --> 00:06:01,055
If he asks you to check him, then tell
that, “This is the thing.”

61
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:05,950
But do not be harsh! Use your tongue for
saying something sweet.

62
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:08,247
I am telling you again and again and again.

63
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:12,584
Otherwise I will put some sort of
a restriction on you.

64
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:16,095
Try to control your tongue.

65
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,524
It’s very essential to put sweetly
something, you can, you are sahaj yogis,

66
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,039
it’s very easy to put it sweetly something.

67
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:30,015
It’s such an attractive thing. Why do you
say harsh things?

68
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:34,058
For what? To create enemies?

69
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:38,032
If you want to have enemies, you can have
so many:

70
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:41,206
for that you need not say harsh things.

71
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,856
Very easy to gather enemies. Difficult
to get friends.

72
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:47,931
And difficult to get your own kith and kin.

73
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:52,149
But Sahaj Yogis, you have one Mother.

74
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:55,205
And that hurts me the most.

75
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:59,213
Any, any, thing that tries to break you

76
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:04,011
will take out my heart into many parts.

77
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:10,169
And this body will become divided into
many parts.

78
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,272
So don’t do that to me.

79
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,743
This is the greatest suffering I can have
from you.

80
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:20,625
I request you not to do that because I have
taken you into my Being,

81
00:07:20,826 --> 00:07:22,730
and you are part and parcel of me.

82
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:28,267
You are one of the thousand petals of my
Sahasrara,

83
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:37,213
and I don’t want these petals to be broken
by you and to be trampled by others.

84
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:41,122
You have your own dignity, and respect
the dignity of others.

85
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:46,048
And you are Sahaj yogis, realised-souls,
you must know that now.

86
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,447
You are not ordinary people.

87
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:53,738
As you respect yourself, you’ll respect
others.

88
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,786
This is one thing I must tell you: that
among yourselves you should be

89
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:04,315
very humble and very friendly and
extremely sweet.

90
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:07,336
Also when you will start doing that,
gradually you will learn

91
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,899
a method by which you’ll be very sweet.

92
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:15,698
It is better to be sweet than to be harsh.

93
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,140
It is better to be beaten up than to be
beating others.

94
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:26,232
It is better to be simple and deceived than
to be deceiving others.

95
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:38,171
We are like the shield and the shield has
to fight the sword.

96
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:42,805
Sword doesn’t fight a sword, it’s a shield
that has to fight it.

97
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:49,537
This you must understand, that for
anything,

98
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,155
no harsh words is to be said.

99
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:57,060
Keep quiet! Just keep quiet.

100
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,210
Try to keep control of your tongue.

101
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,772
That is one thing: that there should be
no disunity

102
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:07,325
because you are collectively conscious
among yourselves.

103
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:10,674
If there is disunity among you, you cannot
be one:

104
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,142
then how can we think of the whole world
being one? Just think of it!

105
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:17,625
And your responsibility is much greater
because you are the first people

106
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:25,297
who have got it in the whole of Europe and
the whole of England.

107
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,369
Respect each other.

108
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,958
Think of the good points that everyone has.
Try to love.

109
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:46,070
If I were like you… you know I am complete,
I have no problem —

110
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:52,117
why am I bothering? Because I love you.

111
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:57,497
If you love each other, you will see

112
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:03,740
the good points of another person, and you
will imbibe them.

113
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:11,048
Try to love each other. But do not confuse
this love with the carnal love.

114
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:15,028
This is Divine love: absolutely pure,

115
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:20,644
elevating, helping you to ascend.

116
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:26,648
Tonight you promise me that you will look

117
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:35,624
at every Sahaj Yogi as a person in bondage
in love and not in hatred.

118
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,273
And if somebody you think is not doing
right

119
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,570
or going bad, then you cure that person.

120
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:45,619
Sitting in the house, you know how
to do that.

121
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:48,243
But don’t be harsh. By talking ill

122
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:52,125
you are not going to do anything to help
that person.

123
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:57,703
You use your methods which you know
very well. This is one point.

124
00:10:57,904 --> 00:11:01,456
And that will give me the greatest
pleasure, the greatest of all:

125
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:04,997
when I will see all my children loving each
other,

126
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,800
and being kind to each other, running to do
for everyone,

127
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:15,304
trying to help each other and extremely
humbled down.

128
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:19,275
Some of you are better off, some of you
are more intelligent,

129
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:23,548
some of you have got more heart qualities.

130
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,963
Don’t try to show down somebody who lacks
a little bit in intelligence,

131
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:30,545
or somebody who has little less of love.

132
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:35,108
Maybe that person just wants more love.

133
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:39,811
But try to give, than to expect others
to give.

134
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:47,039
Then the second one: I want you, all
of you, today, to know

135
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,272
that you are the people who have to build
up Sahaj Yoga

136
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:55,749
in this country and also in other countries
wherever you go.

137
00:11:55,981 --> 00:12:01,449
So you are like seeds, and the seed which
has to grow the whole tree.

138
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,378
You have to bear all other trees, so how
important you are!

139
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,717
So today you have to resolve that, in your
personal life,

140
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:12,999
you are going to be honest. You are going
to watch yourself.

141
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,955
You are going to introspect yourself.
You are not going to tell lies.

142
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:19,805
And you are going to look after your
chastity,

143
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:23,934
look after your life as a very precious
thing.

144
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:28,593
And you are not going to cheat yourself.
And you are not going to debase yourself.

145
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:32,335
And you are not going to denigrate
yourself, in your own eyes,

146
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:37,587
but develop those eyes which criticise
all these things and can see yourself.

147
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:41,820
Today you must promise me that you will
meditate,

148
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:48,236
you’ll introspect, then getting into your
Self.

149
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:56,535
Thirdly, you will not criticise Sahaj Yog —

150
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:59,483
that is God’s own method — at any cost!

151
00:12:59,684 --> 00:13:01,538
If you do not understand a part of Sahaj
Yog,

152
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,338
you can come and ask me, but don’t
criticise.

153
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,529
This you must promise me.

154
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,422
So far whatever has happened, has happened.

155
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,015
It’s finished. It’s forgiven.

156
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,734
But don’t criticise His ways now anymore,

157
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:17,744
because now you are put into a higher
position.

158
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:21,615
You are put into a higher position, today.

159
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:28,210
No more criticism of Sahaj Yog, at any
cost! At any cost.

160
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,961
Because then you criticise the God Himself.

161
00:13:33,002 --> 00:13:35,941
If you don’t understand, ask me.

162
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,226
And now you know you are the people,

163
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:46,241
God has sent only those who really know
that Sahaj Yoga is the Truth.

164
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:49,804
It is the only way, it is revealed to you
only, very few people,

165
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,623
that this is the Truth.

166
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:55,169
And this is going to save the whole
humanity and all the people.

167
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,550
And God can be only understood through
Sahaj Yog.

168
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,265
So nobody is going to decry Sahaj Yoga.

169
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:08,432
Nor anyone is going to say that, “I am
the Sahaj Yoga!”

170
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:13,855
Anybody who thinks like that has been
always, so far, we have seen

171
00:14:14,055 --> 00:14:18,216
in our practices in Sahaj yoga for the last
now so many years,

172
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:21,702
that anyone who takes upon to themselves
that, “I am the Sahaj Yoga!”

173
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,835
has had the worst possible falls of all
Sahaj Yogis.

174
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:29,199
So don’t do that. We are a part and parcel

175
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,809
of that Sahaj Yoga: harmonising people,
being one with people.

176
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:40,987
So nobody should criticise Sahaj Yog,

177
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:44,488
nobody should take chances with Sahaj Yog.

178
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:49,535
And fourth, you have to be obedient to me.

179
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:55,332
I have been telling you, in a different way
and in every way

180
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:59,409
that you should understand. Now,
this stops.

181
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,750
Today you have done this puja,

182
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:06,425
I want to tell you that on your own,
on your free will,

183
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:10,336
with your own understanding you have
to be obedient to me.

184
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,038
This is your own decision.

185
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:14,324
I cannot force obedience onto you,

186
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:17,515
but you must understand it is for your
good.

187
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,634
Because every minute I can see your
future, I can see

188
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:24,056
your past, I can see your ascent, I can see
everything.

189
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,229
If I say anything at that moment, it may
appear

190
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,910
a little [bit] unreasonable, but just obey
me, what I tell you!

191
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,669
I am not asking too much, you have seen:
not much, as other gurus do.

192
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,680
You don’t know other gurus what do they do:

193
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:40,039
they will hang the disciple in the well
halfway down.

194
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,739
He is just there and from his waist they
will be hanging a rope up.

195
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,766
They take seven parikshas (परीक्षा — trial,
test) like this, horrible ones.

196
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,456
They will throw him into some place.

197
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:57,106
Seven like this. There are, altogether,
108 parikshas.

198
00:15:57,307 --> 00:16:00,338
And then they say, “Come along!” Then
they will try [to teach] you.

199
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:03,924
It starts after that. I am not taking
your test.

200
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:11,357
But obedience is very necessary because
I know everything.

201
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,801
I can’t help it. You cannot have

202
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:18,196
You cannot have another opinion about
myself because that’s a fact.

203
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,934
And if I say something, I would not say
normally,

204
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:24,529
I will not hurt you, you know that. I hate
to hurt you.

205
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,116
After any hurt I cause you I weep and cry.

206
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:35,557
But I have to do it, because you are my
dearest children and you are my will.

207
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:39,843
And you have to do the most important thing
on Earth,

208
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:44,003
so be careful. Whatever I have told you,
you have to obey.

209
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:52,169
For today, for this place, and today’s
function, I bless you –

210
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,342
these are the things you must do.

211
00:16:55,543 --> 00:17:01,055
I haven’t asked for much. But they are very
difficult things.

212
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:04,030
They are difficult.

213
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:09,429
So, look after yourself. Try to be good
Sahaj Yogis.

214
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,947
Be sweet to each other, kind to each
other. Don’t deceive yourself.

215
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:19,225
Look after your vibrations and everything
will be alright.

216
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:28,650
May God bless you.
