00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:08.865
A month back, I told Rustom,

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.723
that you must have a Puja arranged,

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:20.911
this Sunday.

00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:27.339
It’s a full moon day, and he asked Me
what should you call, is it a Guru Puja,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.950
or is it a Puja for Mahalaxmi, or Ganesha’s
Puja.

00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:39.526
So I told him call it a Guru Puja.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.917
And he asked Me later on, much later -

00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:50.839
when I was going to India -

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.250
that why not also have the Christmas Puja
over here.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.410
Today is a very important day.

00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:18.894
Because, long time back,

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:24.852
when Christ was just a child,

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:36.887
He read from the Scriptures, and declared
to the multitudes,

00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:40.984
that He was the Advent –

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:47.601
the incarnation, who is the Savior.

00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:57.561
They believed that a Savior is going
to come.

00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:04.681
Today, long time back, on a Sunday,

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:09.872
He said, He declared that He was
the Savior.

00:02:10.073 --> 00:02:14.863
That’s why today is the Advent Sunday.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.047
He had to live very...

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:31.716
for a very, very short time.

00:02:32.338 --> 00:02:40.332
So at a very young age He had to declare
that He was the Advent.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:45.667
Now it is remarkable to see, that before
this,

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:50.841
no incarnation said publicly,

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:57.477
that they were incarnations.

00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:07.994
Rama, of course, had forgotten that He was
an incarnation.

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:13.591
In a way, He made Himself to forget, played
His maya upon Himself

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:21.900
to become a complete human being – Maryada
Purushottama,

00:03:22.446 --> 00:03:29.547
and Shri Krishna also only told one person,
Arjuna,

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:37.233
just before he was to start the war.

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:43.352
Abraham never said that He was
the incarnation, though He was

00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:46.975
the incarnation of Primordial Master.

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:54.383
Dattatreya Himself never said that He was
the incarnation of the Primordial Master.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:58.346
With all these three forces,

00:03:59.308 --> 00:04:06.085
acting through innocence, came on this
earth to guide.

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:13.538
Moses never said that… though they knew He
was great,

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:23.194
He had overpowered Nature, but He never
said that He was the incarnation.

00:04:30.387 --> 00:04:33.558
At the time of Christ,

00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:41.593
one felt it was necessary to say, otherwise
people won’t understand.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.653
If at that time they had recognized Christ,

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:58.183
there would have been no problem. But still,
human beings had to evolve further.

00:04:58.384 --> 00:05:06.508
Somebody had to cross the Agnya Chakra
in the Virata, to go through that door.

00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:13.132
That’s why Christ came on this Earth.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:21.950
It is most surprising,

00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:27.714
that in this tree of Life,

00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:38.182
when the roots give out the shoot, and
the shoot gives out the branches,

00:05:38.447 --> 00:05:43.906
and the branches give out the leaves,

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:51.010
and the flowers also blossom out
of the same tree,

00:05:53.192 --> 00:06:00.261
those who know the roots do not want to know
the shoot,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.158
those who know the shoot do not want
to recognize the flowers.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:10.584
This is typical human nature.

00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:22.827
I never said about Myself.

00:06:24.372 --> 00:06:30.128
Because it was felt,

00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:39.368
that human beings have now achieved another
dimension of ego.

00:06:40.653 --> 00:06:46.625
Even worse, than at the time of Christ.

00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:53.900
May you blame anything, you can call it
Industrial Revolution

00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:59.308
because you were away from nature, or
whatever you may call it.

00:07:00.925 --> 00:07:07.831
But human beings had lost all contact with
reality.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:14.624
They were identified with artificiality,

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:21.725
and to accept such a great reality is going
to be impossible for them,

00:07:21.926 --> 00:07:27.554
that’s why I never said a word about
Myself -

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:36.668
till of course some of the saints told
about Me,

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:42.949
some of the possessed people also told
about Me;

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:48.253
and also people started wondering,

00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:54.784
that how the most difficult thing
of Kundalini awakening takes place,

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:59.090
with that speed in the presence of Mataji.

00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:10.679
There was a temple in India

00:08:12.276 --> 00:08:18.898
and nobody knew about it, but they found
that the ships which went near

00:08:19.099 --> 00:08:26.192
a particular spot, were drawn towards
the shore.

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:34.386
And it was difficult to ply them back and
they had to put double force

00:08:34.587 --> 00:08:41.119
to take out of that attraction, and they
did not know that,

00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:50.220
there was some thing that was acting.
They thought there was something wrong,

00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:55.753
with the depth of the sea…

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:02.451
But invariably it happened to many ships.

00:09:02.652 --> 00:09:07.312
Then they wanted to find out, after all
what is happening to those ships.

00:09:07.513 --> 00:09:13.498
Why all the ships suddenly start getting
attracted towards the shore?

00:09:14.803 --> 00:09:19.978
So they tried to find out, and when they
went into the jungles

00:09:20.179 --> 00:09:24.222
they found a big temple, and on top
of the temple

00:09:24.423 --> 00:09:30.957
was kept a huge mass of magnet.

00:09:34.334 --> 00:09:42.703
So, through rational understanding, people
reached the point,

00:09:42.904 --> 00:09:50.200
that Mataji has to be something exceptional,
because nowhere in the scriptures

00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:56.654
written down anywhere, that such
an incarnation came on this Earth –

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.799
whose mere glance, even thought, can raise
the Kundalini.

00:10:09.323 --> 00:10:17.369
Many saints, who are away from the madding
crowd, sitting in the jungles,

00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:25.103
on the Himalayas, all know about it.

00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:36.937
Because their awareness is at a point,
where they understand.

00:10:43.228 --> 00:10:52.477
They understand much more than you do,
because you are still children, newly born.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:55.996
They are grown up.

00:11:06.106 --> 00:11:17.105
But today is the day, I declare that I am
the One who has to save the humanity.

00:11:24.113 --> 00:11:30.305
I declare I am the One who is Adishakti,

00:11:30.609 --> 00:11:38.645
who is the Mother of all the Mothers, who
is the Primordial Mother,

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:47.629
the Shakti, the Desire of God, who has
incarnated on this Earth

00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:54.468
to give its meaning to itself,

00:11:55.571 --> 00:12:00.023
to this creation, to human beings,

00:12:02.435 --> 00:12:10.351
and I’m sure through My love and patience
and My powers, I am going to achieve it.

00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:29.780
I was the One who was born again and again,

00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:39.064
but now in My complete form and complete
powers,

00:12:41.231 --> 00:12:44.729
I have come on this Earth,

00:12:46.101 --> 00:12:51.161
not only for salvation of human beings,

00:12:51.362 --> 00:12:55.453
not only for their emancipation,

00:12:55.654 --> 00:13:04.616
but for granting them the Kingdom
of Heaven, the Joy, the Bliss,

00:13:06.171 --> 00:13:12.615
that your Father wants to bestow upon you.

00:13:28.265 --> 00:13:32.511
These words are to be kept

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:39.540
within the bounds of Sahaja Yogis only,
for the time being.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:59.609
And today is the day of Guru Puja, not
My Puja, but your Puja as Gurus.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:04.138
I anoint all of you as Gurus,

00:14:06.084 --> 00:14:11.697
and today I will tell you what I have
bestowed upon you

00:14:11.898 --> 00:14:17.075
and what great powers you already have
within you.

00:14:29.653 --> 00:14:34.846
Among you, there are people who are still
not...

00:14:38.005 --> 00:14:41.755
been able to recognize.

00:14:52.049 --> 00:15:00.967
My announcement will work it out within
them – the recognition.

00:15:01.474 --> 00:15:05.786
Without recognition you cannot see
the play,

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:11.979
without play, you cannot have confidence
within yourself,

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.544
without confidence you cannot become Guru,

00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:21.110
without becoming Guru you cannot help
others,

00:15:21.311 --> 00:15:26.967
and without helping others you are not
going to be in any way happy.

00:15:27.168 --> 00:15:31.007
So, to break the chain

00:15:35.204 --> 00:15:42.406
is very easy, but to build the chain one
after another

00:15:44.366 --> 00:15:47.896
is what you have to do.

00:15:51.031 --> 00:15:56.475
This is what you were all wanting to be.

00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:09.047
So, be confident and be joyous, and be
happy

00:16:09.248 --> 00:16:15.997
that all My powers will protect you,

00:16:16.198 --> 00:16:23.830
My Love will nourish you,

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:39.397
and My nature will fill you with peace and
joy.

00:16:42.256 --> 00:16:44.587
May God Bless You.
