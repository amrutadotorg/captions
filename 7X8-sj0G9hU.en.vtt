00:02.007 --> 00:08.865
A month back, I told Rustom,

00:09.499 --> 00:13.723
that you must have a Puja arranged,

00:18.416 --> 00:20.911
this Sunday.

00:21.872 --> 00:27.339
It’s a full moon day, and he asked Me
what should you call, is it a Guru Puja,

00:27.540 --> 00:33.950
or is it a Puja for Mahalaxmi, or Ganesha’s
Puja.

00:36.221 --> 00:39.526
So I told him call it a Guru Puja.

00:41.979 --> 00:45.917
And he asked Me later on, much later -

00:47.531 --> 00:50.839
when I was going to India -

00:51.040 --> 00:57.250
that why not also have the Christmas Puja
over here.

01:01.720 --> 01:07.410
Today is a very important day.

01:14.348 --> 01:18.894
Because, long time back,

01:20.921 --> 01:24.852
when Christ was just a child,

01:30.105 --> 01:36.887
He read from the Scriptures, and declared
to the multitudes,

01:37.088 --> 01:40.984
that He was the Advent –

01:41.893 --> 01:47.601
the incarnation, who is the Savior.

01:51.708 --> 01:57.561
They believed that a Savior is going
to come.

02:00.168 --> 02:04.681
Today, long time back, on a Sunday,

02:05.484 --> 02:09.872
He said, He declared that He was
the Savior.

02:10.073 --> 02:14.863
That’s why today is the Advent Sunday.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.047
He had to live very...

02:26.546 --> 02:31.716
for a very, very short time.

02:32.338 --> 02:40.332
So at a very young age He had to declare
that He was the Advent.

02:40.533 --> 02:45.667
Now it is remarkable to see, that before
this,

02:46.265 --> 02:50.841
no incarnation said publicly,

02:51.042 --> 02:57.477
that they were incarnations.

03:03.208 --> 03:07.994
Rama, of course, had forgotten that He was
an incarnation.

03:08.195 --> 03:13.591
In a way, He made Himself to forget, played
His maya upon Himself

03:13.792 --> 03:21.900
to become a complete human being – Maryada
Purushottama,

03:22.446 --> 03:29.547
and Shri Krishna also only told one person,
Arjuna,

03:30.766 --> 03:37.233
just before he was to start the war.

03:39.467 --> 03:43.352
Abraham never said that He was
the incarnation, though He was

03:43.553 --> 03:46.975
the incarnation of Primordial Master.

03:47.176 --> 03:54.383
Dattatreya Himself never said that He was
the incarnation of the Primordial Master.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.346
With all these three forces,

03:59.308 --> 04:06.085
acting through innocence, came on this
earth to guide.

04:06.286 --> 04:13.538
Moses never said that… though they knew He
was great,

04:14.665 --> 04:23.194
He had overpowered Nature, but He never
said that He was the incarnation.

04:30.387 --> 04:33.558
At the time of Christ,

04:35.116 --> 04:41.593
one felt it was necessary to say, otherwise
people won’t understand.

04:42.070 --> 04:46.653
If at that time they had recognized Christ,

04:50.549 --> 04:58.183
there would have been no problem. But still,
human beings had to evolve further.

04:58.384 --> 05:06.508
Somebody had to cross the Agnya Chakra
in the Virata, to go through that door.

05:09.155 --> 05:13.132
That’s why Christ came on this Earth.

05:18.375 --> 05:21.950
It is most surprising,

05:24.137 --> 05:27.714
that in this tree of Life,

05:29.971 --> 05:38.182
when the roots give out the shoot, and
the shoot gives out the branches,

05:38.447 --> 05:43.906
and the branches give out the leaves,

05:45.544 --> 05:51.010
and the flowers also blossom out
of the same tree,

05:53.192 --> 06:00.261
those who know the roots do not want to know
the shoot,

06:00.470 --> 06:06.158
those who know the shoot do not want
to recognize the flowers.

06:06.399 --> 06:10.584
This is typical human nature.

06:18.933 --> 06:22.827
I never said about Myself.

06:24.372 --> 06:30.128
Because it was felt,

06:32.232 --> 06:39.368
that human beings have now achieved another
dimension of ego.

06:40.653 --> 06:46.625
Even worse, than at the time of Christ.

06:49.036 --> 06:53.900
May you blame anything, you can call it
Industrial Revolution

06:54.101 --> 06:59.308
because you were away from nature, or
whatever you may call it.

07:00.925 --> 07:07.831
But human beings had lost all contact with
reality.

07:09.459 --> 07:14.624
They were identified with artificiality,

07:15.919 --> 07:21.725
and to accept such a great reality is going
to be impossible for them,

07:21.926 --> 07:27.554
that’s why I never said a word about
Myself -

07:29.419 --> 07:36.668
till of course some of the saints told
about Me,

07:38.315 --> 07:42.949
some of the possessed people also told
about Me;

07:44.067 --> 07:48.253
and also people started wondering,

07:48.875 --> 07:54.784
that how the most difficult thing
of Kundalini awakening takes place,

07:54.985 --> 07:59.090
with that speed in the presence of Mataji.

08:07.251 --> 08:10.679
There was a temple in India

08:12.276 --> 08:18.898
and nobody knew about it, but they found
that the ships which went near

08:19.099 --> 08:26.192
a particular spot, were drawn towards
the shore.

08:28.342 --> 08:34.386
And it was difficult to ply them back and
they had to put double force

08:34.587 --> 08:41.119
to take out of that attraction, and they
did not know that,

08:42.785 --> 08:50.220
there was some thing that was acting.
They thought there was something wrong,

08:51.685 --> 08:55.753
with the depth of the sea…

08:57.709 --> 09:02.451
But invariably it happened to many ships.

09:02.652 --> 09:07.312
Then they wanted to find out, after all
what is happening to those ships.

09:07.513 --> 09:13.498
Why all the ships suddenly start getting
attracted towards the shore?

09:14.803 --> 09:19.978
So they tried to find out, and when they
went into the jungles

09:20.179 --> 09:24.222
they found a big temple, and on top
of the temple

09:24.423 --> 09:30.957
was kept a huge mass of magnet.

09:34.334 --> 09:42.703
So, through rational understanding, people
reached the point,

09:42.904 --> 09:50.200
that Mataji has to be something exceptional,
because nowhere in the scriptures

09:50.401 --> 09:56.654
written down anywhere, that such
an incarnation came on this Earth –

09:57.760 --> 10:03.799
whose mere glance, even thought, can raise
the Kundalini.

10:09.323 --> 10:17.369
Many saints, who are away from the madding
crowd, sitting in the jungles,

10:19.551 --> 10:25.103
on the Himalayas, all know about it.

10:30.309 --> 10:36.937
Because their awareness is at a point,
where they understand.

10:43.228 --> 10:52.477
They understand much more than you do,
because you are still children, newly born.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.996
They are grown up.

11:06.106 --> 11:17.105
But today is the day, I declare that I am
the One who has to save the humanity.

11:24.113 --> 11:30.305
I declare I am the One who is Adishakti,

11:30.609 --> 11:38.645
who is the Mother of all the Mothers, who
is the Primordial Mother,

11:39.288 --> 11:47.629
the Shakti, the Desire of God, who has
incarnated on this Earth

11:50.601 --> 11:54.468
to give its meaning to itself,

11:55.571 --> 12:00.023
to this creation, to human beings,

12:02.435 --> 12:10.351
and I’m sure through My love and patience
and My powers, I am going to achieve it.

12:25.112 --> 12:29.780
I was the One who was born again and again,

12:31.971 --> 12:39.064
but now in My complete form and complete
powers,

12:41.231 --> 12:44.729
I have come on this Earth,

12:46.101 --> 12:51.161
not only for salvation of human beings,

12:51.362 --> 12:55.453
not only for their emancipation,

12:55.654 --> 13:04.616
but for granting them the Kingdom
of Heaven, the Joy, the Bliss,

13:06.171 --> 13:12.615
that your Father wants to bestow upon you.

13:28.265 --> 13:32.511
These words are to be kept

13:32.712 --> 13:39.540
within the bounds of Sahaja Yogis only,
for the time being.

13:52.650 --> 13:59.609
And today is the day of Guru Puja, not
My Puja, but your Puja as Gurus.

13:59.810 --> 14:04.138
I anoint all of you as Gurus,

14:06.084 --> 14:11.697
and today I will tell you what I have
bestowed upon you

14:11.898 --> 14:17.075
and what great powers you already have
within you.

14:29.653 --> 14:34.846
Among you, there are people who are still
not...

14:38.005 --> 14:41.755
been able to recognize.

14:52.049 --> 15:00.967
My announcement will work it out within
them – the recognition.

15:01.474 --> 15:05.786
Without recognition you cannot see
the play,

15:06.105 --> 15:11.979
without play, you cannot have confidence
within yourself,

15:12.180 --> 15:16.544
without confidence you cannot become Guru,

15:16.745 --> 15:21.110
without becoming Guru you cannot help
others,

15:21.311 --> 15:26.967
and without helping others you are not
going to be in any way happy.

15:27.168 --> 15:31.007
So, to break the chain

15:35.204 --> 15:42.406
is very easy, but to build the chain one
after another

15:44.366 --> 15:47.896
is what you have to do.

15:51.031 --> 15:56.475
This is what you were all wanting to be.

15:59.794 --> 16:09.047
So, be confident and be joyous, and be
happy

16:09.248 --> 16:15.997
that all My powers will protect you,

16:16.198 --> 16:23.830
My Love will nourish you,

16:30.490 --> 16:39.397
and My nature will fill you with peace and
joy.

16:42.256 --> 16:44.587
May God Bless You.
