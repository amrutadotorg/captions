00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.030
But you have a new dimension;

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.010
you have to use your powers

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.990
for the benevolence of the people.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.890
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.030
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.900
So this time, we should say,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.930
your Kundalini can only be nourished

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.870
if you develop within yourself

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.950
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.950
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.900
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.900
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.820
maybe with your lust.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.870
Maybe your love might be directed

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.900
towards some person, only.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.960
Kundalini is not like that.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.960
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.930
She doesn't get involved into any,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.010
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.950
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.820
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.910
should not get involved

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.820
into any relationship as such.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.870
Is possible.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.870
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.910
For example, as I have always told you,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.020
the sap in the tree rises

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.020
and goes to various parts of the tree

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.840
and then evaporates or comes back.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.880
So this passage should be kept open,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.960
and once this passage is kept open

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.900
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.040
But this passage can be closed,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.850
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.910
because there are some people

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.810
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.900
All right, in the beginning I know,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.930
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.910
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.900
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.820
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.850
They'll write long, long letters

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.950
describing the relationship

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.820
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.960
Without writing the names

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.820
they will give all the connections that they have.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.010
These are all artificial connections.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.850
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.880
these relationships are of no use;

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.950
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.980
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.980
in what family you were born,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.880
in what religion you were born,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.980
in what country you are born,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.980
because now you are a universal being.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.020
So you are no more related

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.880
through these artificial relationships

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.010
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.810
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.990
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.010
give up your wife, give up your children,

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.040
nothing of the kind;

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.810
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.980
we have to give up all these things.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.880
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.960
If there are some good conditionings,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.960
still we should give up

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.960
in the sense they should not be conditionings

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.040
but we should be master of them.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.870
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.960
in their own country,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.930
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.930
I used to do the same.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.930
Then England is horrible for that.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.930
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.980
it's a cursed country,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.010
you just can't do that.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.950
You have to take your bath in the night

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.010
otherwise give up bathing;

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.930
and one has to change.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.860
But if you have that conditioning,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.920
then you will feel very sad,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.970
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.880
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.920
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.000
So whether it is good or bad,

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.000
if it is a conditioning

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.940
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.810
That doesn't mean that you should go

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.880
in the opposite direction,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.820
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.810
that's not the way.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.820
It is that,

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.820
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.920
I'll have it in the evening,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.980
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.930
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.344
Nothing should control you,

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.920
then the Kundalini moves for us,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.930
because you must have complete liberty.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.960
If you do not have complete liberty

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.820
then the Kundalini won't move.

00:06:25.783 --> 00:06:28.207
We have conditionings of our families,

00:06:28.328 --> 00:06:31.820
of our religion,

00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:34.543
of our country.

00:06:35.743 --> 00:06:39.663
These conditionings, as far as possible,

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:44.633
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

00:06:47.513 --> 00:06:48.583
family.

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:50.683
If you are born a Christian

00:06:51.573 --> 00:06:54.523
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

00:06:55.523 --> 00:06:56.633
Christ you have not seen,

00:06:56.663 --> 00:06:58.663
you don't know whether He existed or not,

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:00.653
whether this Bible is true or not

00:07:00.693 --> 00:07:02.693
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:05.276
Now if you are a Hindu,

00:07:05.395 --> 00:07:09.553
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

00:07:09.733 --> 00:07:13.523
This creates imbalance,

00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:18.513
because we must have the same attitude

00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:21.693
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

00:07:21.723 --> 00:07:24.653
that's the sign of a saint.

00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:31.583
So this conditioning has to go.

00:07:32.543 --> 00:07:36.653
In what country you are born is another conditioning

00:07:36.693 --> 00:07:38.663
which has to be fought out;

00:07:39.513 --> 00:07:41.543
very important it is.

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:45.513
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

00:07:45.553 --> 00:07:48.553
of different countries but you know very well.

00:07:48.603 --> 00:07:51.543
After Realization when you rise higher

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:53.713
than your society which is surrounding you,

00:07:54.553 --> 00:07:58.583
you start understanding and you start describing.

00:07:58.663 --> 00:08:01.427
I've come to know about the stupidity

00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:03.663
of all these countries through the people

00:08:03.693 --> 00:08:05.663
who belong to that country.

00:08:05.713 --> 00:08:07.663
For example a Frenchman will say,

00:08:07.693 --> 00:08:11.653
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.553
he's a French otherwise born.”

00:08:14.663 --> 00:08:16.513
Or a Hindu will say,

00:08:16.573 --> 00:08:19.513
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

00:08:19.543 --> 00:08:20.713
he will do like this.”

00:08:21.623 --> 00:08:24.683
So then you understand that you are not typifying

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:26.583
that country,

00:08:26.653 --> 00:08:28.543
you are a universal being

00:08:28.603 --> 00:08:31.513
and you are living like a universal being.

00:08:34.603 --> 00:08:36.723
Once you become the universal being

00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:41.713
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

00:08:41.743 --> 00:08:44.513
makes no difference in the world.

00:08:45.713 --> 00:08:49.573
So then you don't start hating somebody

00:08:49.623 --> 00:08:53.603
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:55.543
both ways it works.

00:08:55.623 --> 00:09:01.405
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.683
but “darkers” also hate equally.

00:09:04.653 --> 00:09:08.283
And mutually they believe that they are all

00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:10.623
absolutely wrong.

00:09:11.553 --> 00:09:14.633
If you ask a fanatic

00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:19.513
about another religion he'll say,

00:09:19.553 --> 00:09:21.693
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

00:09:22.523 --> 00:09:25.543
And you ask the another fanatic,

00:09:25.623 --> 00:09:30.573
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.683
That means all of them are the worst,

00:09:32.743 --> 00:09:34.623
in a general opinion.

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:36.523
Everybody seems to be the worst,

00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:37.693
all the fanatics are the worst,

00:09:38.523 --> 00:09:40.713
if you take a general consensus, you see.

00:09:41.683 --> 00:09:43.518
Nobody will say that,

00:09:43.543 --> 00:09:44.663
"All right, my religion is all right

00:09:44.713 --> 00:09:47.733
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:52.553
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

00:09:52.573 --> 00:09:56.583
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

00:09:57.623 --> 00:10:00.633
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

00:10:00.663 --> 00:10:02.583
with the other English for misbehaving

00:10:02.623 --> 00:10:05.623
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

00:10:05.653 --> 00:10:07.693
because they are blind.

00:10:08.528 --> 00:10:11.638
So here the compassion should come within you,

00:10:11.663 --> 00:10:13.317
as a universal being,

00:10:13.342 --> 00:10:16.693
that by God's grace you have risen higher

00:10:16.713 --> 00:10:18.623
in the real sense of the word.

00:10:18.653 --> 00:10:20.583
It is not just you are certified,

00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:22.543
you are realized souls, no.

00:10:22.633 --> 00:10:28.713
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:33.688
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:35.743
that you are realized souls.

00:10:36.733 --> 00:10:39.683
Naturally you must change everything.

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:46.583
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

00:10:49.553 --> 00:10:54.683
with something that is now, you have given up.

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:57.693
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

00:10:58.543 --> 00:11:02.603
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:05.623
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

00:11:05.683 --> 00:11:08.543
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

00:11:08.693 --> 00:11:12.513
In the same way we should accept our position.

00:11:12.683 --> 00:11:17.583
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

00:11:17.623 --> 00:11:20.663
with self-esteem and understanding

00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:23.603
as to what is our purpose of life now;

00:11:23.633 --> 00:11:25.693
it is changed completely, entirely.

00:11:26.683 --> 00:11:29.583
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

00:11:29.633 --> 00:11:32.603
innately, not outside because I am saying,

00:11:32.653 --> 00:11:34.513
or is a mental process,

00:11:34.543 --> 00:11:37.543
but inside you feel responsible.

00:11:37.583 --> 00:11:41.653
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

00:11:41.693 --> 00:11:44.633
and to emancipate the whole world.

00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:47.713
Once you realize this point

00:11:48.623 --> 00:11:51.573
then automatically you take up responsibilities

00:11:51.623 --> 00:11:53.633
and the Kundalini will rise.

00:11:55.513 --> 00:11:57.573
I know of many people who said,

00:11:57.603 --> 00:12:00.523
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

00:12:00.573 --> 00:12:02.683
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

00:12:04.573 --> 00:12:07.693
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

00:12:10.683 --> 00:12:12.633
There are many who said that,

00:12:12.663 --> 00:12:15.573
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

00:12:15.603 --> 00:12:16.743
we cannot sing.”

00:12:17.593 --> 00:12:20.543
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

00:12:20.683 --> 00:12:22.603
that people had to tell her that you…

00:12:22.673 --> 00:12:24.603
because she would always go out of tune

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:26.593
and very loudly she would sing;

00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:28.488
then they had to tell her,

00:12:28.513 --> 00:12:29.573
“Now you better keep at the back

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:31.573
and don't sing now any more.”

00:12:31.683 --> 00:12:35.733
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

00:12:37.513 --> 00:12:40.543
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.563
which you should accept that they have come to you,

00:12:44.593 --> 00:12:49.533
and give up all that you call as fear.

00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:54.603
All kinds of fear we have.

00:12:55.513 --> 00:12:59.543
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

00:12:59.573 --> 00:13:01.563
left-sided man what he should do.

00:13:02.673 --> 00:13:07.513
But what a left-sided man has to know

00:13:07.573 --> 00:13:10.713
that he is now an enlightened soul

00:13:11.683 --> 00:13:16.653
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

00:13:17.603 --> 00:13:20.653
No saint will be destroyed.

00:13:20.723 --> 00:13:23.753
Those who will try to destroy you

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:28.573
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:31.753
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:35.573
very jocular manner.

00:13:35.643 --> 00:13:37.603
You'll laugh at

00:13:37.693 --> 00:13:40.753
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

00:13:41.603 --> 00:13:43.573
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

00:13:43.633 --> 00:13:45.633
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

00:13:45.683 --> 00:13:48.613
means their destruction will start

00:13:48.663 --> 00:13:51.683
by their own stupid methods.

00:13:52.543 --> 00:13:54.523
They'll become stupid.

00:13:54.643 --> 00:13:57.683
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:01.633
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

00:14:01.663 --> 00:14:03.633
You don't have to worry about that part.

00:14:03.713 --> 00:14:06.533
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

00:14:06.683 --> 00:14:12.523
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

00:14:12.743 --> 00:14:15.264
So that part you have to give up.

00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:18.573
You just forgive that person.

00:14:19.723 --> 00:14:21.753
As soon as you forgive,

00:14:23.723 --> 00:14:26.643
the responsibility from you shifts

00:14:28.523 --> 00:14:30.633
and then Kundalini rises.

00:14:31.613 --> 00:14:35.613
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

00:14:35.663 --> 00:14:39.553
but just laugh because they are blind,

00:14:39.723 --> 00:14:41.753
because they are stupid,

00:14:42.553 --> 00:14:43.693
they are foolish.

00:14:45.543 --> 00:14:48.573
What do we do if you see an idiot?

00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:51.643
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

00:14:51.683 --> 00:14:55.643
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

00:14:56.683 --> 00:14:59.683
So they become idiotic

00:15:00.613 --> 00:15:04.543
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

00:15:04.583 --> 00:15:06.344
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:08.633
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

00:15:09.663 --> 00:15:12.573
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

00:15:12.613 --> 00:15:14.533
behaving in that manner

00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:19.663
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

00:15:20.693 --> 00:15:24.663
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

00:15:25.693 --> 00:15:28.573
same about organizations or anything.

00:15:28.613 --> 00:15:30.713
Naturally you have to know one thing:

00:15:31.573 --> 00:15:33.573
that as you are Realized souls,

00:15:33.753 --> 00:15:35.613
you have seen the truth,

00:15:35.663 --> 00:15:37.693
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

00:15:37.723 --> 00:15:39.663
they are going to oppose you.

00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:44.703
They did this, isn't it, to others;

00:15:45.603 --> 00:15:48.663
everybody suffered so much.

00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:53.613
But now no more sufferings to you,

00:15:53.723 --> 00:15:57.673
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

00:15:59.573 --> 00:16:01.663
Just understand this point,

00:16:01.733 --> 00:16:05.653
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:10.593
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.142
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

00:16:14.543 --> 00:16:17.553
all this fear and left side will go away.

00:16:18.743 --> 00:16:22.683
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

00:16:22.733 --> 00:16:25.633
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.663
You are so powerful.

00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:29.653
Just with one glance

00:16:29.703 --> 00:16:32.513
you can see them dancing on their heads,

00:16:32.653 --> 00:16:34.593
the other way round.

00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:38.623
As long as you'll have fear

00:16:38.663 --> 00:16:43.543
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:45.573
who are cowards.

00:16:46.523 --> 00:16:48.713
Cowardice She is not going to support.

00:16:49.523 --> 00:16:51.683
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

00:16:53.623 --> 00:16:55.653
You are walking on the street,

00:16:55.743 --> 00:16:59.633
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

00:16:59.693 --> 00:17:03.543
afraid that somebody might attack,

00:17:03.653 --> 00:17:05.603
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

00:17:05.653 --> 00:17:06.663
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

00:17:06.713 --> 00:17:09.573
because he knows there are ganas

00:17:09.623 --> 00:17:11.543
and there are angels around him.

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:13.523
No one can touch him,

00:17:13.663 --> 00:17:15.623
and the one who will try,

00:17:16.523 --> 00:17:19.518
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

00:17:19.543 --> 00:17:21.633
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

00:17:23.623 --> 00:17:25.593
Now you watch and see.

00:17:26.743 --> 00:17:31.713
So this left side or this fear should go.

00:17:31.743 --> 00:17:35.513
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

00:17:35.573 --> 00:17:41.713
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

00:17:43.733 --> 00:17:48.523
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.
