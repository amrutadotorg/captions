WEBVTT

00:07.960 --> 00:10.030
But you have a new dimension;

00:10.890 --> 00:15.010
you have to use your powers

00:16.900 --> 00:19.990
for the benevolence of the people.

00:21.810 --> 00:28.890
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

00:31.900 --> 00:36.030
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

00:38.810 --> 00:40.900
So this time, we should say,

00:40.950 --> 00:43.930
your Kundalini can only be nourished

00:44.040 --> 00:48.870
if you develop within yourself

00:50.870 --> 00:56.950
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

00:58.930 --> 01:02.950
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

01:04.810 --> 01:08.900
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

01:09.030 --> 01:16.900
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

01:16.930 --> 01:19.820
maybe with your lust.

01:21.050 --> 01:24.870
Maybe your love might be directed

01:24.900 --> 01:28.900
towards some person, only.

01:29.810 --> 01:31.960
Kundalini is not like that.

01:32.020 --> 01:35.960
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

01:36.010 --> 01:37.930
She doesn't get involved into any,

01:37.960 --> 01:41.010
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

01:41.820 --> 01:44.950
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

01:45.990 --> 01:49.820
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

01:49.980 --> 01:52.910
should not get involved

01:53.810 --> 01:57.820
into any relationship as such.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.870
Is possible.

02:00.910 --> 02:04.870
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

02:04.990 --> 02:07.910
For example, as I have always told you,

02:07.950 --> 02:09.020
the sap in the tree rises

02:09.820 --> 02:12.020
and goes to various parts of the tree

02:12.050 --> 02:15.840
and then evaporates or comes back.

02:16.980 --> 02:20.880
So this passage should be kept open,

02:22.960 --> 02:25.960
and once this passage is kept open

02:26.850 --> 02:32.900
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.040
But this passage can be closed,

02:37.880 --> 02:41.850
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

02:41.950 --> 02:46.910
because there are some people

02:50.820 --> 02:54.810
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.900
All right, in the beginning I know,

02:56.950 --> 02:58.930
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

02:58.960 --> 03:02.910
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

03:03.840 --> 03:07.900
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

03:08.010 --> 03:11.820
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.850
They'll write long, long letters

03:13.900 --> 03:14.950
describing the relationship

03:14.980 --> 03:20.820
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

03:20.870 --> 03:21.960
Without writing the names

03:21.990 --> 03:24.820
they will give all the connections that they have.

03:24.870 --> 03:27.010
These are all artificial connections.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.850
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

03:32.010 --> 03:35.880
these relationships are of no use;

03:35.910 --> 03:38.950
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

03:40.010 --> 03:42.980
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

03:43.050 --> 03:44.980
in what family you were born,

03:45.010 --> 03:46.880
in what religion you were born,

03:46.910 --> 03:48.980
in what country you are born,

03:50.010 --> 03:52.980
because now you are a universal being.

03:53.980 --> 03:58.020
So you are no more related

03:58.990 --> 04:01.880
through these artificial relationships

04:01.960 --> 04:07.010
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

04:08.900 --> 04:13.810
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

04:13.990 --> 04:15.990
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

04:16.810 --> 04:18.010
give up your wife, give up your children,

04:18.030 --> 04:20.040
nothing of the kind;

04:20.980 --> 04:25.810
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

04:25.950 --> 04:28.980
we have to give up all these things.

04:31.990 --> 04:34.880
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.960
If there are some good conditionings,

04:40.870 --> 04:41.960
still we should give up

04:41.990 --> 04:44.960
in the sense they should not be conditionings

04:45.020 --> 04:47.040
but we should be master of them.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.870
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

04:50.920 --> 04:51.960
in their own country,

04:51.990 --> 04:54.930
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.930
I used to do the same.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.930
Then England is horrible for that.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.930
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

05:05.010 --> 05:06.980
it's a cursed country,

05:07.810 --> 05:09.010
you just can't do that.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.950
You have to take your bath in the night

05:10.980 --> 05:13.010
otherwise give up bathing;

05:14.840 --> 05:15.930
and one has to change.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.860
But if you have that conditioning,

05:17.920 --> 05:19.920
then you will feel very sad,

05:19.950 --> 05:21.970
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

05:22.020 --> 05:26.880
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

05:26.940 --> 05:30.920
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.000
So whether it is good or bad,

05:34.050 --> 05:36.000
if it is a conditioning

05:36.920 --> 05:40.940
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.810
That doesn't mean that you should go

05:45.840 --> 05:46.880
in the opposite direction,

05:46.920 --> 05:48.820
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

05:48.850 --> 05:50.810
that's not the way.

05:53.930 --> 05:55.820
It is that,

05:55.900 --> 05:58.820
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

05:58.870 --> 05:59.920
I'll have it in the evening,

05:59.960 --> 06:01.980
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

06:02.010 --> 06:05.930
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

06:07.870 --> 06:09.344
Nothing should control you,

06:09.369 --> 06:11.920
then the Kundalini moves for us,

06:11.980 --> 06:14.930
because you must have complete liberty.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.960
If you do not have complete liberty

06:18.040 --> 06:20.820
then the Kundalini won't move.

06:25.783 --> 06:28.207
We have conditionings of our families,

06:28.328 --> 06:31.820
of our religion,

06:32.513 --> 06:34.543
of our country.

06:35.743 --> 06:39.663
These conditionings, as far as possible,

06:39.733 --> 06:44.633
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

06:47.513 --> 06:48.583
family.

06:48.633 --> 06:50.683
If you are born a Christian

06:51.573 --> 06:54.523
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

06:55.523 --> 06:56.633
Christ you have not seen,

06:56.663 --> 06:58.663
you don't know whether He existed or not,

06:58.723 --> 07:00.653
whether this Bible is true or not

07:00.693 --> 07:02.693
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.276
Now if you are a Hindu,

07:05.395 --> 07:09.553
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

07:09.733 --> 07:13.523
This creates imbalance,

07:14.623 --> 07:18.513
because we must have the same attitude

07:18.573 --> 07:21.693
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

07:21.723 --> 07:24.653
that's the sign of a saint.

07:28.583 --> 07:31.583
So this conditioning has to go.

07:32.543 --> 07:36.653
In what country you are born is another conditioning

07:36.693 --> 07:38.663
which has to be fought out;

07:39.513 --> 07:41.543
very important it is.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.513
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

07:45.553 --> 07:48.553
of different countries but you know very well.

07:48.603 --> 07:51.543
After Realization when you rise higher

07:51.583 --> 07:53.713
than your society which is surrounding you,

07:54.553 --> 07:58.583
you start understanding and you start describing.

07:58.663 --> 08:01.427
I've come to know about the stupidity

08:01.633 --> 08:03.663
of all these countries through the people

08:03.693 --> 08:05.663
who belong to that country.

08:05.713 --> 08:07.663
For example a Frenchman will say,

08:07.693 --> 08:11.653
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

08:12.425 --> 08:14.553
he's a French otherwise born.”

08:14.663 --> 08:16.513
Or a Hindu will say,

08:16.573 --> 08:19.513
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

08:19.543 --> 08:20.713
he will do like this.”

08:21.623 --> 08:24.683
So then you understand that you are not typifying

08:24.733 --> 08:26.583
that country,

08:26.653 --> 08:28.543
you are a universal being

08:28.603 --> 08:31.513
and you are living like a universal being.

08:34.603 --> 08:36.723
Once you become the universal being

08:37.553 --> 08:41.713
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

08:41.743 --> 08:44.513
makes no difference in the world.

08:45.713 --> 08:49.573
So then you don't start hating somebody

08:49.623 --> 08:53.603
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

08:53.633 --> 08:55.543
both ways it works.

08:55.623 --> 09:01.405
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

09:01.430 --> 09:03.683
but “darkers” also hate equally.

09:04.653 --> 09:08.283
And mutually they believe that they are all

09:08.583 --> 09:10.623
absolutely wrong.

09:11.553 --> 09:14.633
If you ask a fanatic

09:16.573 --> 09:19.513
about another religion he'll say,

09:19.553 --> 09:21.693
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

09:22.523 --> 09:25.543
And you ask the another fanatic,

09:25.623 --> 09:30.573
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.683
That means all of them are the worst,

09:32.743 --> 09:34.623
in a general opinion.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.523
Everybody seems to be the worst,

09:36.553 --> 09:37.693
all the fanatics are the worst,

09:38.523 --> 09:40.713
if you take a general consensus, you see.

09:41.683 --> 09:43.518
Nobody will say that,

09:43.543 --> 09:44.663
"All right, my religion is all right

09:44.713 --> 09:47.733
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

09:50.573 --> 09:52.553
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

09:52.573 --> 09:56.583
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

09:57.623 --> 10:00.633
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

10:00.663 --> 10:02.583
with the other English for misbehaving

10:02.623 --> 10:05.623
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

10:05.653 --> 10:07.693
because they are blind.

10:08.528 --> 10:11.638
So here the compassion should come within you,

10:11.663 --> 10:13.317
as a universal being,

10:13.342 --> 10:16.693
that by God's grace you have risen higher

10:16.713 --> 10:18.623
in the real sense of the word.

10:18.653 --> 10:20.583
It is not just you are certified,

10:20.633 --> 10:22.543
you are realized souls, no.

10:22.633 --> 10:28.713
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

10:29.518 --> 10:33.688
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

10:33.713 --> 10:35.743
that you are realized souls.

10:36.733 --> 10:39.683
Naturally you must change everything.

10:42.583 --> 10:46.583
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

10:49.553 --> 10:54.683
with something that is now, you have given up.

10:54.733 --> 10:57.693
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

10:58.543 --> 11:02.603
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

11:02.633 --> 11:05.623
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

11:05.683 --> 11:08.543
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

11:08.693 --> 11:12.513
In the same way we should accept our position.

11:12.683 --> 11:17.583
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

11:17.623 --> 11:20.663
with self-esteem and understanding

11:20.713 --> 11:23.603
as to what is our purpose of life now;

11:23.633 --> 11:25.693
it is changed completely, entirely.

11:26.683 --> 11:29.583
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

11:29.633 --> 11:32.603
innately, not outside because I am saying,

11:32.653 --> 11:34.513
or is a mental process,

11:34.543 --> 11:37.543
but inside you feel responsible.

11:37.583 --> 11:41.653
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

11:41.693 --> 11:44.633
and to emancipate the whole world.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.713
Once you realize this point

11:48.623 --> 11:51.573
then automatically you take up responsibilities

11:51.623 --> 11:53.633
and the Kundalini will rise.

11:55.513 --> 11:57.573
I know of many people who said,

11:57.603 --> 12:00.523
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

12:00.573 --> 12:02.683
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

12:04.573 --> 12:07.693
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

12:10.683 --> 12:12.633
There are many who said that,

12:12.663 --> 12:15.573
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

12:15.603 --> 12:16.743
we cannot sing.”

12:17.593 --> 12:20.543
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

12:20.683 --> 12:22.603
that people had to tell her that you…

12:22.673 --> 12:24.603
because she would always go out of tune

12:24.633 --> 12:26.593
and very loudly she would sing;

12:26.733 --> 12:28.488
then they had to tell her,

12:28.513 --> 12:29.573
“Now you better keep at the back

12:29.623 --> 12:31.573
and don't sing now any more.”

12:31.683 --> 12:35.733
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

12:37.513 --> 12:40.543
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

12:40.593 --> 12:43.563
which you should accept that they have come to you,

12:44.593 --> 12:49.533
and give up all that you call as fear.

12:51.683 --> 12:54.603
All kinds of fear we have.

12:55.513 --> 12:59.543
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

12:59.573 --> 13:01.563
left-sided man what he should do.

13:02.673 --> 13:07.513
But what a left-sided man has to know

13:07.573 --> 13:10.713
that he is now an enlightened soul

13:11.683 --> 13:16.653
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

13:17.603 --> 13:20.653
No saint will be destroyed.

13:20.723 --> 13:23.753
Those who will try to destroy you

13:24.553 --> 13:28.573
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

13:29.523 --> 13:31.753
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

13:31.823 --> 13:35.573
very jocular manner.

13:35.643 --> 13:37.603
You'll laugh at

13:37.693 --> 13:40.753
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.573
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

13:43.633 --> 13:45.633
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

13:45.683 --> 13:48.613
means their destruction will start

13:48.663 --> 13:51.683
by their own stupid methods.

13:52.543 --> 13:54.523
They'll become stupid.

13:54.643 --> 13:57.683
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

13:58.633 --> 14:01.633
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

14:01.663 --> 14:03.633
You don't have to worry about that part.

14:03.713 --> 14:06.533
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

14:06.683 --> 14:12.523
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

14:12.743 --> 14:15.264
So that part you have to give up.

14:15.431 --> 14:18.573
You just forgive that person.

14:19.723 --> 14:21.753
As soon as you forgive,

14:23.723 --> 14:26.643
the responsibility from you shifts

14:28.523 --> 14:30.633
and then Kundalini rises.

14:31.613 --> 14:35.613
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

14:35.663 --> 14:39.553
but just laugh because they are blind,

14:39.723 --> 14:41.753
because they are stupid,

14:42.553 --> 14:43.693
they are foolish.

14:45.543 --> 14:48.573
What do we do if you see an idiot?

14:49.523 --> 14:51.643
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

14:51.683 --> 14:55.643
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

14:56.683 --> 14:59.683
So they become idiotic

15:00.613 --> 15:04.543
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.344
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

15:06.369 --> 15:08.633
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

15:09.663 --> 15:12.573
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

15:12.613 --> 15:14.533
behaving in that manner

15:14.633 --> 15:19.663
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

15:20.693 --> 15:24.663
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

15:25.693 --> 15:28.573
same about organizations or anything.

15:28.613 --> 15:30.713
Naturally you have to know one thing:

15:31.573 --> 15:33.573
that as you are Realized souls,

15:33.753 --> 15:35.613
you have seen the truth,

15:35.663 --> 15:37.693
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

15:37.723 --> 15:39.663
they are going to oppose you.

15:41.673 --> 15:44.703
They did this, isn't it, to others;

15:45.603 --> 15:48.663
everybody suffered so much.

15:50.693 --> 15:53.613
But now no more sufferings to you,

15:53.723 --> 15:57.673
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

15:59.573 --> 16:01.663
Just understand this point,

16:01.733 --> 16:05.653
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

16:05.733 --> 16:10.593
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.142
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

16:14.543 --> 16:17.553
all this fear and left side will go away.

16:18.743 --> 16:22.683
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

16:22.733 --> 16:25.633
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.663
You are so powerful.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.653
Just with one glance

16:29.703 --> 16:32.513
you can see them dancing on their heads,

16:32.653 --> 16:34.593
the other way round.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.623
As long as you'll have fear

16:38.663 --> 16:43.543
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

16:43.603 --> 16:45.573
who are cowards.

16:46.523 --> 16:48.713
Cowardice She is not going to support.

16:49.523 --> 16:51.683
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

16:53.623 --> 16:55.653
You are walking on the street,

16:55.743 --> 16:59.633
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

16:59.693 --> 17:03.543
afraid that somebody might attack,

17:03.653 --> 17:05.603
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

17:05.653 --> 17:06.663
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

17:06.713 --> 17:09.573
because he knows there are ganas

17:09.623 --> 17:11.543
and there are angels around him.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.523
No one can touch him,

17:13.663 --> 17:15.623
and the one who will try,

17:16.523 --> 17:19.518
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

17:19.543 --> 17:21.633
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

17:23.623 --> 17:25.593
Now you watch and see.

17:26.743 --> 17:31.713
So this left side or this fear should go.

17:31.743 --> 17:35.513
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

17:35.573 --> 17:41.713
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

17:43.733 --> 17:48.523
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.
