00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:32.734
I had a special purpose in coming to Ganpatipule,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.634
apart from that it was a very beautiful place

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:39.667
and very relaxing for all of you.

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:49.334
The reason is – I found this place had vibrations

00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:53.734
which will clear you out very easily, first of all.

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:58.500
But you have to desire it, really, ardently.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.133
You should have that desire otherwise the Kundalini may not rise.

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:05.734
That is a very important point;

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:09.167
that you have to desire your ascent, nothing else.

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:12.033
It’s not a place you have come for a holiday

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.033
or just for some sort of a relaxation or for

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:19.067
some enjoyment or sleeping or anything,

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:24.334
but you have come here for a penance, for a tapasya,

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:29.334
to clear out yourself completely.

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:35.000
This is a place of Shri Ganesha’s temple

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:39.434
which is not very much frequented by people

00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:41.467
and it’s still very, very pure.

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:47.033
And I thought that the Ganesh principle will be awakened in you

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.701
which is the source of everything.

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.801
Shri Ganesha’s principle, as you know,

00:03:56.534 --> 00:04:02.267
in a very large way or expansive way, we call it ‘the innocence’,

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:07.167
but we do not know the intricacies and the details

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:11.133
to which it can go and work it out.

00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:17.033
Shri Ganesha’s innocence has a tremendous power

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:22.200
to purify people, to make you holy, to make you auspicious.

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:25.701
A person who has got Shri Ganesha’s principle awakened

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.634
is auspicious in his presence.

00:04:29.133 --> 00:04:31.133
Such a person, whenever he moves,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.701
things move in a direction that the coefficience works out,

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:38.033
it becomes absolutely auspicious;

00:04:38.534 --> 00:04:44.267
auspiciousness which cannot be achieved without Shri Ganesha’s help.

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:48.367
Now this auspiciousness, now we Sahaja Yogis believe into;

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:51.500
that there is something like auspiciousness

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.467
by which everything works out smoothly.

00:04:54.634 --> 00:04:58.334
Everything we feel is done by God’s power,

00:04:58.534 --> 00:05:02.300
that we are all the time wanted by nature,

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:07.200
loved by surroundings and the atmosphere.

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:10.067
But this understanding can only come

00:05:10.267 --> 00:05:14.267
if you have that pure desire within you, that you have to ascend.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.067
You have come here to ascend,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.367
not to enjoy yourself or a place of resort or something like that.

00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:30.400
This principle is very much awakened, as you see, in the local people here.

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:34.267
And how spartan they are, how hard working.

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.267
They’ve been awake for days together and nights together

00:05:37.267 --> 00:05:44.400
but still they are very, very relaxed and they do not need any help.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.234
Just in that enthusiasm they are working out!

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.400
So the second blessing of Ganesha is that He’s playful,

00:05:53.367 --> 00:05:57.500
He’s prasanna, He’s always a pleasing personality.

00:05:57.767 --> 00:05:59.334
He dances.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.500
He pleases you.

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:04.300
He has ways and methods of pleasing you.

00:06:04.734 --> 00:06:09.567
And in the same way, a person who has that awakened Ganesha within him

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.067
is all the time a very pleasing personality,

00:06:13.334 --> 00:06:17.334
not a drawn-out face, not a face that repels you,

00:06:17.467 --> 00:06:20.133
the face that makes you feel unhappy,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:29.200
but is a personality that makes you very easy, very understandable,

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:35.234
likeable: that sort of a personality you develop.

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:39.200
But, so far as the life has been abroad,

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:43.200
I have seen that the situation has been very different.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.267
And the aggressiveness and the quarrelsomeness,

00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:54.033
we can say, the hurting capacity, is so over-developed

00:06:54.167 --> 00:07:01.000
that you have to somehow or other, succumb completely

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:03.400
to the auspiciousness of Shri Ganesha.

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:09.567
Because all the instruments that were to be used for spreading Sahaja Yoga

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.234
or for spreading the love of God, for spreading auspiciousness of God,

00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:17.000
working out His designs and plans

00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:24.133
and adjusting yourself to the laws of God’s desires –

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.634
it was very important that we should have had our instruments done

00:07:30.534 --> 00:07:34.734
in such a way that they were absolutely useful.

00:07:35.133 --> 00:07:38.200
On the contrary we have misused them, spoiled them

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.467
and have completely made them unholy.

00:07:44.367 --> 00:07:47.467
So that’s another point: we have to look at ourselves here,

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.634
what have we been doing to ourselves,

00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:53.400
what is the need for us to make ourselves unholy

00:07:55.767 --> 00:07:57.601
and why should we be unholy.

00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:02.234
When Shri Ganesha is there, we can make ourselves very holy, auspicious.

00:08:02.367 --> 00:08:04.634
Now no use believing that we are perfect!

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.067
Those who believe like that cannot ascend.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.033
Everybody must know there are lots of imperfections and,

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:12.133
“These imperfections in me that are

00:08:12.133 --> 00:08:15.200
[there] should be conquered and [are] to be found out."

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.334
Only in the light of Shri Ganesha’s innocence you can see.

00:08:18.734 --> 00:08:27.334
A little child can show you how we are stupid and foolish and how we behave.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.367
So many times you must have seen [that] children come out

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.067
with such utterances that the elders are put to shame!

00:08:35.467 --> 00:08:41.400
So the child-like temperament can be developed

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.400
if we awaken the Shri Ganesha’s principle within ourselves;

00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:55.267
which is a very, very powerful, very, very powerful Deity.

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:57.267
A very powerful Deity.

00:08:57.534 --> 00:09:02.133
Because a child, supposing one child is lost,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:10.100
say a child runs away or if a child is hanging somewhere on a tree –

00:09:10.434 --> 00:09:14.567
the whole community will rush to take out the child,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.500
the concern will be there.

00:09:16.734 --> 00:09:20.734
Even in the Western countries, I have seen, if one little girl is tortured,

00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:24.534
everybody is worried about the child, everybody opposes that.

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:27.500
Maybe there are some horrible people, no doubt,

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:32.567
maybe there are more than they are here, but one gets concerned.

00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:41.234
So a child, itself, is a very sort of a source

00:09:41.467 --> 00:09:45.000
of getting all the protection from everywhere.

00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:49.367
Because the child is growing, the child is growing.

00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:52.234
Everybody wants to help the child.

00:09:52.534 --> 00:09:57.234
So in the same way when this Ganesha principle is developed into you,

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.667
you realise that you have to grow, you are still growing.

00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:05.167
A little child learns so many words in such a short time

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.000
that we cannot learn afterwards when we are grown up.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.467
Say, after sixty, if you have to learn even three sentences, it’s impossible!

00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:19.067
So the child is growing and his curiosity and his capacity

00:10:19.167 --> 00:10:23.300
to know more things is also very much sharp

00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:27.067
and he starts learning more. He doesn’t think he knows everything.

00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:31.400
The ones who think like that are not yet born properly.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.300
“I don’t know anything! I have to know this, I have to know that.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.067
I have to know that. I don’t know anything so far."

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.067
And the children do it so easily you must have seen.

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:49.467
A little bit you do this way or that way, they immediately follow you.

00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:53.234
So what you have to do is to know that you are

00:10:53.334 --> 00:10:55.801
still in a child stage, you are growing.

00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:59.234
We have to humble down and we have to know a lot.

00:10:59.434 --> 00:11:03.133
And from wherever we have to know, we have to know.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.567
The arrogance, the idea that we know a lot itself

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:13.000
is very, very dangerous for the growth, very dangerous.

00:11:13.234 --> 00:11:15.467
And that is what one has to give up and should know

00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:18.234
that we do not know anything but we have to know.

00:11:18.434 --> 00:11:21.234
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga settle down as,

00:11:21.367 --> 00:11:24.300
“We are Sahaja Yogis,” but don’t know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:27.367
So many of them! Specially the ladies, I am surprised.

00:11:28.033 --> 00:11:31.267
They know very little about Sahaja Yoga. It’s rather surprising.

00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:34.100
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s nothing like women or men,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.801
everybody has equal rights.

00:11:36.067 --> 00:11:40.067
It’s not the job of women just to sing songs. No! It’s not!

00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:43.200
They have to know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.200
They have to know what are the diseases, how they are cured,

00:11:46.267 --> 00:11:49.067
what are the mental problems, how are these chakras are made.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.400
Everything they have to know.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.367
The medicines they have to know, the psychology.

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:54.701
They have to know the Divine powers.

00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:58.300
Everything they have to know, how it works out.

00:11:59.067 --> 00:12:01.434
And that ignorance will never be forgiven

00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:05.300
because you are the ones who have to talk about it to others.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:10.300
The third thing is: a child is never a silly person, never silly.

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:12.801
He never does something in a silly way.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.200
While you see many people who are brought up in a very strict way

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.601
become suddenly very silly at an old age.

00:12:19.767 --> 00:12:24.234
Very silly. This phenomenon I see much more in the West.

00:12:24.534 --> 00:12:28.200
Suddenly they become, trying to be very youngish-type

00:12:28.267 --> 00:12:31.234
and just they’ll clap like this and start

00:12:31.234 --> 00:12:32.667
behaving in a very funny manner.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.400
I used to wonder, “What’s wrong with them?

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.667
Why are they behaving like this?”

00:12:37.067 --> 00:12:39.067
But it is, I think they have bottled up.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.334
And then suddenly they try to behave.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.667
But they (children) are not.

00:12:44.067 --> 00:12:46.334
A child is never a silly person.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.067
On the contrary, if there’s somebody silly they said, “He’s a clown!”

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.400
They’ll come and tell me, “He’s a clown, you know.

00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:57.400
He’s not all right!” or, “He’s a buffoon!”

00:12:57.534 --> 00:13:00.334
Whatever words they know they’ll express. They don’t like [it].

00:13:00.567 --> 00:13:04.067
They start wondering, “What’s the matter with this person?”

00:13:04.634 --> 00:13:08.567
So all these things come to us because we have no idea

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:17.100
that we have to grow in a steady, understanding awareness, awareness.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.234
Not in how you express yourself in Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:20.334 --> 00:13:23.400
how you do things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.067
It is how you are aware of it inside.

00:13:29.701 --> 00:13:35.334
In the same way emotionally: when I say something,

00:13:35.567 --> 00:13:38.200
I don’t think people understand what I mean.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.234
Now I said that, “You put on bindis."

00:13:40.434 --> 00:13:43.200
Again I find you are just the same!

00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:45.267
At least here you should.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.100
This is Ganesha’s mark.

00:13:47.367 --> 00:13:50.033
They would not put it.

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:52.067
It’s so many times I have said it.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.067
I mean, how much time does it take to put it on?

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:59.100
Now this is a very common things that are going on.

00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:04.234
Now another thing is that a child doesn’t want to be dishevelled at all.

00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:08.100
Today one child had gone for a bath and was coming back.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.334
His father wanted him to see me, he said, “No, my clothes are not all right.

00:14:11.334 --> 00:14:13.033
my hair are all dishevelled.

00:14:13.067 --> 00:14:14.601
How can I see Mother?”

00:14:15.067 --> 00:14:20.067
So he went back, he put some oil on his hair, properly he dressed up, smartly.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.234
When we were young, we always knew

00:14:22.267 --> 00:14:26.033
all the Western people were very smartly dressed, properly groomed.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.167
They would never come with dishevelled hairs.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:32.100
But he said, “No, my hair [is] all dishevelled, how can I go and see Mother?”

00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:36.067
So we have to give up these funny ideas of fashions and all that,

00:14:36.067 --> 00:14:37.400
because this will all go away,

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.400
you’ll lose your hair, you’ll all become bald-headed to look very funny.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.400
There’s no wisdom in it.

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:45.634
But a child has wisdom! He wouldn’t come.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.467
He dressed up himself properly, then he came and stood before me.

00:14:51.534 --> 00:14:54.567
And this is what we have to understand: that

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.634
our appearances are the expression of our inner being

00:14:59.267 --> 00:15:03.467
and we have to do certain things because we do not know to accept things,

00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:06.000
how to do things like a child does.

00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:10.267
A child if you tell him anything, he obeys and he listens.

00:15:11.334 --> 00:15:14.100
Otherwise the child is not a normal child.

00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:16.500
In India if there’s a child who doesn’t obey,

00:15:16.634 --> 00:15:20.367
they just thrash him nicely, put him in the room for three days,

00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:25.000
make him starve and put him right; nothing doing!

00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:29.167
That doesn’t mean the people are harsh here with children.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.400
Nobody kills children or anything.

00:15:30.634 --> 00:15:33.534
But you have to be very, very careful with your children,

00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:38.300
you shouldn’t allow them to be lousy, to be untidy,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.767
to be languid, like lotus-eaters

00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:50.400
or like people who have no smartness about them.

00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:54.367
You are all Sahaja Yogis and you have to be like that in that way.

00:15:56.167 --> 00:16:02.067
A child’s another attribute is that he hits always the principle of everything.

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:04.367
Always the principle.

00:16:04.634 --> 00:16:07.133
A child sees to the principle of everything.

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:11.701
And the questions they ask sometimes are so remarkably collective

00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:15.234
that I am surprised how they go to that point.

00:16:15.601 --> 00:16:19.067
They never waste time in frivolous things, never.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.701
Never waste time in frivolous things, talking of frivolous things.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.067
Nothing of the kind.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.067
I haven’t seen children talking about their clothes

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:28.767
or about the seats they have got or

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.267
the houses – nothing of the kind.

00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:33.767
They are busy doing some construction!

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.133
Very busy, you see. You ask them, “What are you doing?”

00:16:36.234 --> 00:16:39.667
“You see, we are trying to tie up the whole of the airport,”

00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:42.334
or the whole of Bombay, like that they will tell you.

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:44.067
They are very busy people.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.234
If you see Realised souls who are children,

00:16:46.334 --> 00:16:48.601
they are always worried about the collective.

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:51.434
And that’s what should be your situation

00:16:51.467 --> 00:16:54.400
that you should be all the time worried about

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.234
the collective as a child is: that,

00:16:57.467 --> 00:17:01.033
“How I will help the collective?”

00:17:01.234 --> 00:17:05.400
But not worried about yourself, “What is my personality, am I that impressive?

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.200
If I go to people, will they believe that I’m something? A Realised-soul?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.133
Or I am like other women or other men who are going to the hairdressers

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.400
and having all kinds of hairdressing up

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.334
and wearing all kinds of funny dresses to impress others?

00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:23.267
Am I looking like a saint?

00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:26.367
Am I behaving like a saint?”

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.334
These things should come to you very easily.

00:17:29.334 --> 00:17:31.734
If you tell a child, “You are a Sahaja Yogi,”

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:37.200
they say so, “I am a Sahaja Yogi, I can’t do that!”

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.234
All the nonsense starts after they develop their ego.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.234
And then they start behaving in a funny way

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.567
and it develops much more in the West earlier,

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:52.267
but here it takes time.

00:17:52.567 --> 00:17:57.701
And the children are just accepting whatever God gives them.

00:17:58.133 --> 00:18:02.200
To them alertness is so natural.

00:18:02.234 --> 00:18:05.467
If there’s an aeroplane that’s going, they’ll say, “Bye bye aeroplane."

00:18:05.801 --> 00:18:07.701
Then there are ships are going, “Bye bye."

00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:11.067
To the sea they’ll say, “All right, sea, we’ll come and see you tomorrow!”

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:12.601
Everything is within their mind.

00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:14.200
To them everything is there.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.000
They’ll come, you ask them, “How did you like it?”

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.400
“Oh, we liked the grass very much.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.033
It was nice,” and everything they will tell you, the details about everything.

00:18:24.167 --> 00:18:25.767
So alert!

00:18:26.133 --> 00:18:28.067
And then they will say, “Oh, Why didn’t you do this?

00:18:28.167 --> 00:18:29.567
You could have put some flowers here,

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:34.334
you could have done some flowers, would have looked nice for the hut."

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.400
Or something, a suggestion they will give.

00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:40.467
Very particular on cleanliness, anything.

00:18:40.567 --> 00:18:43.300
And in childhood children get up very early.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.267
All the children in childhood get up very early.

00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:50.200
It’s a nuisance for mothers but they get up very early

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.400
and that’s how I also get up very early.

00:18:53.234 --> 00:18:56.033
Getting up early is a child-like behaviour.

00:18:56.133 --> 00:19:00.167
Because the birds are singing, the sun is rising,

00:19:00.334 --> 00:19:03.267
such beauty in the sky and, “And Why am I sleeping?”

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.067
They’ll wake up the whole house!

00:19:05.167 --> 00:19:08.500
But people don’t like it, sometimes they beat, not in India.

00:19:08.801 --> 00:19:11.100
In India people try to get up early in the morning.

00:19:11.133 --> 00:19:14.334
It’s regarded as something very dharmic and good.

00:19:15.067 --> 00:19:18.067
Even if we sleep late, we’ll get up early in the morning,

00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:21.534
that’s one thing. Then you can sleep in the daytime.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.234
But nobody sleeps over this thing like nine o’clock, ten o’clock,

00:19:26.267 --> 00:19:28.133
nobody sleeps like that.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.267
I mean, I have a problem, I don’t know what to do with myself.

00:19:33.367 --> 00:19:35.267
You can sleep in the daytime for a while

00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:37.634
if you want to overcome the night sleep and all.

00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:39.601
And you can be quite fresh.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.334
And you can be quite all right in the evening if you sleep for a while.

00:19:44.133 --> 00:19:48.200
But a child doesn’t think too much, he doesn’t plan too much.

00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:50.133
He makes fun out of everything.

00:19:50.234 --> 00:19:52.701
You take them anywhere, say, you take them to an airport.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.267
There’s nothing to be played about [there]!

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.334
They’ll find out some groove somewhere, they’ll jump in that,

00:19:57.367 --> 00:19:59.067
they’ll hide there, play there.

00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:03.234
They can make play out of any gross stuff that we think is useless,

00:20:03.267 --> 00:20:05.234
they’ll make out of it.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.534
They’re very constructive and playful and that is what we have to be,

00:20:10.734 --> 00:20:13.267
Make play out of your life. Everything!

00:20:13.334 --> 00:20:15.200
You see, meeting people, talking to them:

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.067
it should come naturally, not artificially.

00:20:18.367 --> 00:20:20.634
Also some people, I have seen, have a habit of putting up

00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:25.300
an expression all the time, like a smile or a frown or this thing.

00:20:25.467 --> 00:20:28.334
Children are never like that. Their muscles are so supple.

00:20:28.467 --> 00:20:29.801
They react all the time.

00:20:30.067 --> 00:20:35.400
Sometimes when they are happy, when they are unhappy, everything.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.434
The muscles all the time are acting like that.

00:20:38.467 --> 00:20:39.667
Nobody is tense.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.300
That’s why we have problems with our faces,

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.234
because we keep them in one style.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.667
And these days the more miserable, you are regarded as more handsome!

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.067
That’s finished!

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.200
Or else some people just go on smiling all the time like this, it’s very bad.

00:20:58.267 --> 00:21:01.100
Or all the time absolutely feeling unhappy.

00:21:01.334 --> 00:21:09.133
You should allow the action of your emotions

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.234
to be expressed on your face.

00:21:11.367 --> 00:21:15.400
I am told that it is said that, “There should be no emotions shown on your faces."

00:21:15.634 --> 00:21:17.701
I mean, I can’t understand!

00:21:18.067 --> 00:21:22.067
What is the use of such a personality who doesn’t show any emotions?

00:21:22.167 --> 00:21:25.367
I mean, you are not a stone are you?

00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:30.334
So all these foolish, stupid ideas which are given to us should be given up.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.067
And we should smile, we should laugh, naturally.

00:21:34.334 --> 00:21:37.200
We should talk to people in a natural way.

00:21:37.334 --> 00:21:40.167
And the child is extremely dignified.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.100
Shri Ganesha dances with His dignity.

00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:45.467
He doesn’t do frivolous, nonsensical things.

00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:49.534
In His rise and in His fall and in His movements and His steps,

00:21:49.634 --> 00:21:54.334
He’s nothing but His weight.

00:21:55.467 --> 00:21:57.467
So something cheapish He doesn’t do.

00:21:57.534 --> 00:22:00.234
In the same way there should be dignity throughout.

00:22:00.434 --> 00:22:03.234
Dignified behaviour should be within us.

00:22:03.334 --> 00:22:06.567
Now you have to judge yourself, how far you have become Shri Ganesha

00:22:06.767 --> 00:22:09.200
within yourself. Are you innocent?

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.267
You think of cheating others, spoiling others.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.334
Like my television, I was amazed!

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.133
I mean, I can never think of spoiling a television and this and that.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.434
These ideas, from where do they come into your heads?

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:23.567
Why should we?

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.133
I have never done it all my life, something like that.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.067
You know that I have always paid every duty, everything.

00:22:30.133 --> 00:22:32.400
Why should we do such a nonsensical [thing],

00:22:32.567 --> 00:22:37.167
to spoil the television and spoil it, make it look cheaper, for what?

00:22:37.267 --> 00:22:40.334
How much are you going to save out of it?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.334
But all these ideas come into your heads, I just don’t know from where.

00:22:44.567 --> 00:22:47.067
Why cheat? We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.667
We cannot cheat anyone.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.133
I mean, you can tell the customs, “This is the situation is.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.434
If you allow we’ll go, otherwise we’ll stay."

00:22:56.467 --> 00:22:59.234
It’s a negative attitude. Never comes to children.

00:22:59.267 --> 00:23:01.434
They are so plain and simple.

00:23:01.667 --> 00:23:05.200
Once we had gone, I must tell you how children are so simple.

00:23:05.434 --> 00:23:09.400
Once we had gone inside a port and

00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:12.667
my nephew gave me two tins of cheese

00:23:14.033 --> 00:23:16.000
and we were bringing it out.

00:23:16.067 --> 00:23:18.601
So my daughter who was a very small girl,

00:23:18.701 --> 00:23:22.467
so when we were coming and he asked, “Do you have anything?”

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.667
I said, “We have some two tins of cheese."

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.100
“Yes, yes and we’re going to eat it also.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.467
See we have opened one and we are eating!”

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.200
The customs fellow was so impressed by her innocence.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.100
He says, “For your eating?”

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.667
“Yes, yes for our eating, we have taken it. Is it all right?”

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:41.267
He said, “It’s all right."

00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:48.400
You see, the simplicity and innocence is itself a certificate for you,.

00:23:49.133 --> 00:23:52.033
Not this cunning methods. What is there?

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.234
I mean, precisely on the phone I tell them, “Oh baba, for heaven’s sake!

00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:58.334
I’ll pay every duty, you don’t have to do anything.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.701
Just put this thing there, tell that it is mine.

00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:07.801
You don’t have to do anything. Declare it, this that." Why?

00:24:11.634 --> 00:24:15.667
Where is our mind going? It’s all right!

00:24:16.133 --> 00:24:18.400
How much are we going to lose in there?

00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:23.067
How much have we gained so far in money? What do we have?

00:24:26.033 --> 00:24:27.801
Saving money here, saving money there.

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:33.067
Children don’t do like that! No, they don’t.

00:24:34.367 --> 00:24:38.467
Like my grandson, he was saying, “Why do you stay in this wretched place?

00:24:38.567 --> 00:24:40.467
Very bad vibrations in London!”

00:24:40.601 --> 00:24:45.067
I said, “You see, your grandfather has to stay here for earning money."

00:24:45.167 --> 00:24:47.367
He said, “Money? Why do you need so much money for,

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.067
why do you need money, why don’t you come to India?”

00:24:50.167 --> 00:24:51.367
I said, “You need money."

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.400
So when my husband came back, he took out a two-p,

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.500
he said, “You want money? Have it! Now put it on your head!

00:24:56.534 --> 00:25:00.000
Why do you want to have money?”

00:25:00.534 --> 00:25:02.734
And my husband didn’t know where to look.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.267
“You want money, all right, have it, put it on your head!”

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.500
He was a little boy, you see!

00:25:09.534 --> 00:25:12.200
But interest in money starts later on.

00:25:12.534 --> 00:25:14.534
As soon as there’s money we start looking at it,

00:25:14.567 --> 00:25:17.267
when we grow up, otherwise we don’t.

00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:20.300
All this money interest starts going later on.

00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:24.367
What is for Ganesha? Money is the dust of His feet.

00:25:24.701 --> 00:25:27.234
What for Him gold? What for Him anything?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:32.167
Whether He wears a crown of gold or He doesn’t wear anything makes no difference!

00:25:32.167 --> 00:25:34.701
He’s is there! His head is just the same.

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:37.000
Out of respect, out of adoration,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.334
people might give Him gold or anything just to feel satisfied,

00:25:39.334 --> 00:25:43.033
it’s alright. For Him what does it matter?

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:50.500
And any child who is a real child will not accept anything from anybody else, nothing.

00:25:50.734 --> 00:25:54.133
But if he takes, he will think, “How should I return it back?”

00:25:54.267 --> 00:25:58.400
Always! I know my own grandchildren have done it.

00:25:58.467 --> 00:26:04.033
If you give them something, they’ll make a heart, put inside that, write it down nicely

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.601
and when I come out of my bathroom, they’ll give me that heart,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.400
you see, that, “Thank you very much,” for this and that.

00:26:11.534 --> 00:26:14.500
But when we grow up we even forget to thank people,

00:26:15.367 --> 00:26:18.300
we take everything for granted, we don’t have that.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.601
We just think we have to judge everyone all the time,

00:26:20.701 --> 00:26:23.534
“That’s not good, this is not good, could have been better!”

00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:26.434
We never think, “This is given to us, be thankful!”

00:26:26.667 --> 00:26:29.267
Count your blessings.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.167
But for children it’s not so.

00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:34.567
If you give them a small thing, they’ll keep it,

00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:38.500
“This is given to me by my grandmother!”

00:26:40.267 --> 00:26:42.801
I have seen this in my own grandchildren.

00:26:43.033 --> 00:26:45.601
The eldest one when she was small I gave her a little sari,

00:26:45.634 --> 00:26:48.067
a very small one just for her to wear.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.167
So when I went there she said, “You see, nani,

00:26:51.234 --> 00:26:54.000
I must tell you one thing serious is happening." I said, “What?”

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.400
“You see, the sari you gave me, I’ve kept it very carefully

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.067
but my mother is trying to be funny!” I said, “What happened?”

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.367
“You know, she didn’t give it to anyone but she showed it to some people,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.234
she should not have shown it!”

00:27:06.367 --> 00:27:08.601
Very seriously!

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.701
They are so sweet and so beautiful when they say things.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.267
Like once I had given her a Wendy house

00:27:16.367 --> 00:27:19.300
and a Wendy house she made it nicely, she called

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.601
her mother, “I have made a very nice house for you, come along!”

00:27:23.033 --> 00:27:25.067
So my daughter is rather tall.

00:27:25.133 --> 00:27:28.567
She found it difficult, she went inside the Wendy house and sat there

00:27:28.634 --> 00:27:31.300
and she said, “Haa! So what have you got for me to eat?”

00:27:31.534 --> 00:27:37.400
She said, “Mummy, when you go to somebody’s house you don’t say such a thing!”

00:27:38.133 --> 00:27:39.601
And she laughed.

00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:42.267
And she laughed so much that she broke all her Wendy house.

00:27:42.434 --> 00:27:44.400
So she came out and she told Me,

00:27:44.434 --> 00:27:49.467
“Grandma, you have not given any good training to your daughters!

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:52.601
First of all, she comes to my house, asks funny questions

00:27:52.601 --> 00:27:57.467
and then she breaks my house, do you do like this to anyone else?”

00:27:58.434 --> 00:28:02.367
How innocent and simple they are!

00:28:03.033 --> 00:28:06.601
Like that there are so many things I can tell you [that] I have seen.

00:28:06.734 --> 00:28:09.067
The way they talk and say things, and all that.

00:28:09.067 --> 00:28:15.400
So simple and so good and so collective and so beautiful.

00:28:16.267 --> 00:28:18.734
In the same way we have to be.

00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:23.467
Another thing, a child doesn’t have any fear.

00:28:23.567 --> 00:28:25.267
A child doesn’t have any fear.

00:28:25.467 --> 00:28:27.467
Ganesha has no fear at all.

00:28:27.701 --> 00:28:31.500
In the same way you should have no fear, no fear at all, no fear.

00:28:32.067 --> 00:28:35.234
As long as your Mother is with you why should you have any fear?

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.567
Fear of this, fear of that, “I am frightened."

00:28:37.567 --> 00:28:40.701
“I can’t do this,” “I can’t do that." That children never do.

00:28:41.033 --> 00:28:44.367
They’ll try everything, if you tell them.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:51.400
You should have no fear. I don’t know what fear is.

00:28:51.767 --> 00:28:56.167
In the same way you should have no fear, no fear of anything.

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:59.300
Nothing is going to go wrong with you. But don’t do wrong things.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.200
If you do wrong things it will repel, it will work out on you.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.801
But don’t do wrong things, be straight forward

00:29:06.267 --> 00:29:09.267
and nothing can harm you, nothing can harm you.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.033
We have had so many experiences of this,

00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:16.667
how everywhere laid down for you, everybody is looking after you.

00:29:17.167 --> 00:29:20.067
There are so many Deities who are working out things out for you.

00:29:20.267 --> 00:29:25.300
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely careful

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.234
that you do not develop this fear business.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.300
Because fear takes you to the Left side

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.067
and once you go to the left side, you know the

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.067
problems of the Left side is – first of all -you go against Ganesha.

00:29:36.067 --> 00:29:39.601
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

00:29:40.133 --> 00:29:44.267
And then you develop cancers, you develop all these things, fear, fear, fear

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.500
and emotional problems and all these things come.

00:29:48.033 --> 00:29:51.400
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

00:29:51.734 --> 00:29:55.634
Joy is your emotion.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.000
In action you should be thoughtless.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.267
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

00:30:07.033 --> 00:30:10.767
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras are very simple for children.

00:30:11.033 --> 00:30:14.067
They are like that.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:24.067
Today at the base of the Shri Ganesha’s hill,

00:30:24.467 --> 00:30:29.300
we have to think of awakening the Ganesh tattwa within us.

00:30:29.434 --> 00:30:33.300
For that we have to meditate. We have to think about it.

00:30:33.601 --> 00:30:35.400
We have to put our time to it.

00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:39.534
Actually if I were you, I may not sleep at all,

00:30:39.601 --> 00:30:43.567
I will go to the seashore, sit down there, meditate the whole time!

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:47.667
Before breaking the Sahastrara I kept awake for two nights

00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:52.400
and I was just all alone, all alone near the sea,

00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:57.200
all alone the whole night, working it out, for two nights.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.133
But what do we do?

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.434
We think about our comforts, we think about this, about that.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.601
It’s not so! You are here! Such a chance!

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:12.400
We get tired because we think too much.

00:31:12.567 --> 00:31:16.634
We know how to get out of this tiredness and this and that.

00:31:18.067 --> 00:31:21.400
So this is a very good chance for you [that] we have come here.

00:31:21.434 --> 00:31:23.267
Of course it’s a beautiful place and all that.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.100
But it’s mainly the thing why I thought of bringing you here [is]

00:31:27.234 --> 00:31:30.033
that it may suddenly give you a big boost up

00:31:30.267 --> 00:31:35.667
and you might rise very high; for which I may not be able to

00:31:35.767 --> 00:31:42.167
really arrange otherwise, this kind of ascent which is possible.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.534
Many of the Indians have not even seen this place before.

00:31:47.667 --> 00:31:49.467
It’s such a beautiful place and they are surprised

00:31:49.467 --> 00:31:52.267
that in India we have such beautiful places!

00:31:52.634 --> 00:31:59.634
And after coming here they have felt the beauty, the auspiciousness,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.334
the wisdom of choosing this place.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.601
It’s so lovable, so beautiful.

00:32:09.734 --> 00:32:16.000
But I hope I see the effects of that in you.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.067
Now you have to go and have your food.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.100
We have a very generous man who is cooking for you.

00:32:22.434 --> 00:32:28.133
Be careful!

00:32:38.067 --> 00:32:40.567
You shouldn’t spoil your health!

00:32:41.467 --> 00:32:44.734
Specially for those who have to go with us ahead.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.133
So be careful! They’re very generous people.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.067
My brother and the gentleman who is cooking for you –

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:52.067
both are competing in generosity.

00:32:53.234 --> 00:32:54.534
So you be careful!

00:32:54.634 --> 00:32:57.400
Now only the Sahaja Yogis from abroad

00:32:57.434 --> 00:33:02.567
and non-vegetarians have to go first and then the vegetarians will go

00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:07.400
and after that we’ll have some music program.

00:33:08.167 --> 00:33:09.534
That’s how it is going to be.

00:33:09.567 --> 00:33:14.667
Tomorrow morning I expect you to go for meditation about five o’clock in the morning.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.033
Then have your bath in the sea.
