WEBVTT

02:28.367 --> 02:32.734
I had a special purpose in coming to Ganpatipule,

02:33.100 --> 02:35.634
apart from that it was a very beautiful place

02:35.801 --> 02:39.667
and very relaxing for all of you.

02:42.267 --> 02:49.334
The reason is – I found this place had vibrations

02:49.701 --> 02:53.734
which will clear you out very easily, first of all.

02:54.334 --> 02:58.500
But you have to desire it, really, ardently.

02:59.200 --> 03:03.133
You should have that desire otherwise the Kundalini may not rise.

03:03.701 --> 03:05.734
That is a very important point;

03:06.067 --> 03:09.167
that you have to desire your ascent, nothing else.

03:09.334 --> 03:12.033
It’s not a place you have come for a holiday

03:12.200 --> 03:16.033
or just for some sort of a relaxation or for

03:16.067 --> 03:19.067
some enjoyment or sleeping or anything,

03:19.167 --> 03:24.334
but you have come here for a penance, for a tapasya,

03:26.033 --> 03:29.334
to clear out yourself completely.

03:31.033 --> 03:35.000
This is a place of Shri Ganesha’s temple

03:35.133 --> 03:39.434
which is not very much frequented by people

03:39.434 --> 03:41.467
and it’s still very, very pure.

03:42.133 --> 03:47.033
And I thought that the Ganesh principle will be awakened in you

03:47.300 --> 03:49.701
which is the source of everything.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.801
Shri Ganesha’s principle, as you know,

03:56.534 --> 04:02.267
in a very large way or expansive way, we call it ‘the innocence’,

04:02.701 --> 04:07.167
but we do not know the intricacies and the details

04:07.734 --> 04:11.133
to which it can go and work it out.

04:12.334 --> 04:17.033
Shri Ganesha’s innocence has a tremendous power

04:17.167 --> 04:22.200
to purify people, to make you holy, to make you auspicious.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.701
A person who has got Shri Ganesha’s principle awakened

04:26.033 --> 04:28.634
is auspicious in his presence.

04:29.133 --> 04:31.133
Such a person, whenever he moves,

04:31.300 --> 04:34.701
things move in a direction that the coefficience works out,

04:35.234 --> 04:38.033
it becomes absolutely auspicious;

04:38.534 --> 04:44.267
auspiciousness which cannot be achieved without Shri Ganesha’s help.

04:44.634 --> 04:48.367
Now this auspiciousness, now we Sahaja Yogis believe into;

04:48.767 --> 04:51.500
that there is something like auspiciousness

04:52.000 --> 04:54.467
by which everything works out smoothly.

04:54.634 --> 04:58.334
Everything we feel is done by God’s power,

04:58.534 --> 05:02.300
that we are all the time wanted by nature,

05:02.634 --> 05:07.200
loved by surroundings and the atmosphere.

05:07.467 --> 05:10.067
But this understanding can only come

05:10.267 --> 05:14.267
if you have that pure desire within you, that you have to ascend.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.067
You have come here to ascend,

05:16.100 --> 05:23.367
not to enjoy yourself or a place of resort or something like that.

05:24.067 --> 05:30.400
This principle is very much awakened, as you see, in the local people here.

05:30.601 --> 05:34.267
And how spartan they are, how hard working.

05:34.701 --> 05:37.267
They’ve been awake for days together and nights together

05:37.267 --> 05:44.400
but still they are very, very relaxed and they do not need any help.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.234
Just in that enthusiasm they are working out!

05:47.300 --> 05:52.400
So the second blessing of Ganesha is that He’s playful,

05:53.367 --> 05:57.500
He’s prasanna, He’s always a pleasing personality.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.334
He dances.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.500
He pleases you.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.300
He has ways and methods of pleasing you.

06:04.734 --> 06:09.567
And in the same way, a person who has that awakened Ganesha within him

06:10.000 --> 06:13.067
is all the time a very pleasing personality,

06:13.334 --> 06:17.334
not a drawn-out face, not a face that repels you,

06:17.467 --> 06:20.133
the face that makes you feel unhappy,

06:20.300 --> 06:29.200
but is a personality that makes you very easy, very understandable,

06:29.267 --> 06:35.234
likeable: that sort of a personality you develop.

06:36.067 --> 06:39.200
But, so far as the life has been abroad,

06:39.234 --> 06:43.200
I have seen that the situation has been very different.

06:43.500 --> 06:48.267
And the aggressiveness and the quarrelsomeness,

06:48.467 --> 06:54.033
we can say, the hurting capacity, is so over-developed

06:54.167 --> 07:01.000
that you have to somehow or other, succumb completely

07:01.067 --> 07:03.400
to the auspiciousness of Shri Ganesha.

07:04.067 --> 07:09.567
Because all the instruments that were to be used for spreading Sahaja Yoga

07:10.000 --> 07:14.234
or for spreading the love of God, for spreading auspiciousness of God,

07:14.334 --> 07:17.000
working out His designs and plans

07:17.133 --> 07:24.133
and adjusting yourself to the laws of God’s desires –

07:24.400 --> 07:29.634
it was very important that we should have had our instruments done

07:30.534 --> 07:34.734
in such a way that they were absolutely useful.

07:35.133 --> 07:38.200
On the contrary we have misused them, spoiled them

07:38.300 --> 07:43.467
and have completely made them unholy.

07:44.367 --> 07:47.467
So that’s another point: we have to look at ourselves here,

07:47.667 --> 07:49.634
what have we been doing to ourselves,

07:50.067 --> 07:53.400
what is the need for us to make ourselves unholy

07:55.767 --> 07:57.601
and why should we be unholy.

07:57.734 --> 08:02.234
When Shri Ganesha is there, we can make ourselves very holy, auspicious.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.634
Now no use believing that we are perfect!

08:05.067 --> 08:07.067
Those who believe like that cannot ascend.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.033
Everybody must know there are lots of imperfections and,

08:10.167 --> 08:12.133
“These imperfections in me that are

08:12.133 --> 08:15.200
[there] should be conquered and [are] to be found out."

08:15.200 --> 08:18.334
Only in the light of Shri Ganesha’s innocence you can see.

08:18.734 --> 08:27.334
A little child can show you how we are stupid and foolish and how we behave.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.367
So many times you must have seen [that] children come out

08:30.400 --> 08:35.067
with such utterances that the elders are put to shame!

08:35.467 --> 08:41.400
So the child-like temperament can be developed

08:42.200 --> 08:46.400
if we awaken the Shri Ganesha’s principle within ourselves;

08:47.367 --> 08:55.267
which is a very, very powerful, very, very powerful Deity.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.267
A very powerful Deity.

08:57.534 --> 09:02.133
Because a child, supposing one child is lost,

09:02.300 --> 09:10.100
say a child runs away or if a child is hanging somewhere on a tree –

09:10.434 --> 09:14.567
the whole community will rush to take out the child,

09:15.000 --> 09:16.500
the concern will be there.

09:16.734 --> 09:20.734
Even in the Western countries, I have seen, if one little girl is tortured,

09:20.801 --> 09:24.534
everybody is worried about the child, everybody opposes that.

09:24.667 --> 09:27.500
Maybe there are some horrible people, no doubt,

09:27.667 --> 09:32.567
maybe there are more than they are here, but one gets concerned.

09:33.067 --> 09:41.234
So a child, itself, is a very sort of a source

09:41.467 --> 09:45.000
of getting all the protection from everywhere.

09:45.367 --> 09:49.367
Because the child is growing, the child is growing.

09:49.567 --> 09:52.234
Everybody wants to help the child.

09:52.534 --> 09:57.234
So in the same way when this Ganesha principle is developed into you,

09:57.300 --> 10:00.667
you realise that you have to grow, you are still growing.

10:00.801 --> 10:05.167
A little child learns so many words in such a short time

10:05.400 --> 10:09.000
that we cannot learn afterwards when we are grown up.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.467
Say, after sixty, if you have to learn even three sentences, it’s impossible!

10:14.234 --> 10:19.067
So the child is growing and his curiosity and his capacity

10:19.167 --> 10:23.300
to know more things is also very much sharp

10:23.601 --> 10:27.067
and he starts learning more. He doesn’t think he knows everything.

10:27.133 --> 10:31.400
The ones who think like that are not yet born properly.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.300
“I don’t know anything! I have to know this, I have to know that.

10:35.300 --> 10:38.067
I have to know that. I don’t know anything so far."

10:38.400 --> 10:42.067
And the children do it so easily you must have seen.

10:42.133 --> 10:49.467
A little bit you do this way or that way, they immediately follow you.

10:50.167 --> 10:53.234
So what you have to do is to know that you are

10:53.334 --> 10:55.801
still in a child stage, you are growing.

10:56.133 --> 10:59.234
We have to humble down and we have to know a lot.

10:59.434 --> 11:03.133
And from wherever we have to know, we have to know.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.567
The arrogance, the idea that we know a lot itself

11:08.701 --> 11:13.000
is very, very dangerous for the growth, very dangerous.

11:13.234 --> 11:15.467
And that is what one has to give up and should know

11:15.601 --> 11:18.234
that we do not know anything but we have to know.

11:18.434 --> 11:21.234
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga settle down as,

11:21.367 --> 11:24.300
“We are Sahaja Yogis,” but don’t know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

11:24.567 --> 11:27.367
So many of them! Specially the ladies, I am surprised.

11:28.033 --> 11:31.267
They know very little about Sahaja Yoga. It’s rather surprising.

11:31.467 --> 11:34.100
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s nothing like women or men,

11:34.200 --> 11:35.801
everybody has equal rights.

11:36.067 --> 11:40.067
It’s not the job of women just to sing songs. No! It’s not!

11:40.267 --> 11:43.200
They have to know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.200
They have to know what are the diseases, how they are cured,

11:46.267 --> 11:49.067
what are the mental problems, how are these chakras are made.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.400
Everything they have to know.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.367
The medicines they have to know, the psychology.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.701
They have to know the Divine powers.

11:54.801 --> 11:58.300
Everything they have to know, how it works out.

11:59.067 --> 12:01.434
And that ignorance will never be forgiven

12:02.033 --> 12:05.300
because you are the ones who have to talk about it to others.

12:06.267 --> 12:10.300
The third thing is: a child is never a silly person, never silly.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.801
He never does something in a silly way.

12:13.100 --> 12:17.200
While you see many people who are brought up in a very strict way

12:17.300 --> 12:19.601
become suddenly very silly at an old age.

12:19.767 --> 12:24.234
Very silly. This phenomenon I see much more in the West.

12:24.534 --> 12:28.200
Suddenly they become, trying to be very youngish-type

12:28.267 --> 12:31.234
and just they’ll clap like this and start

12:31.234 --> 12:32.667
behaving in a very funny manner.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.400
I used to wonder, “What’s wrong with them?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.667
Why are they behaving like this?”

12:37.067 --> 12:39.067
But it is, I think they have bottled up.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.334
And then suddenly they try to behave.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.667
But they (children) are not.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.334
A child is never a silly person.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.067
On the contrary, if there’s somebody silly they said, “He’s a clown!”

12:50.200 --> 12:52.400
They’ll come and tell me, “He’s a clown, you know.

12:52.567 --> 12:57.400
He’s not all right!” or, “He’s a buffoon!”

12:57.534 --> 13:00.334
Whatever words they know they’ll express. They don’t like [it].

13:00.567 --> 13:04.067
They start wondering, “What’s the matter with this person?”

13:04.634 --> 13:08.567
So all these things come to us because we have no idea

13:08.767 --> 13:17.100
that we have to grow in a steady, understanding awareness, awareness.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.234
Not in how you express yourself in Sahaja Yoga,

13:20.334 --> 13:23.400
how you do things in Sahaja Yoga.

13:23.400 --> 13:28.067
It is how you are aware of it inside.

13:29.701 --> 13:35.334
In the same way emotionally: when I say something,

13:35.567 --> 13:38.200
I don’t think people understand what I mean.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.234
Now I said that, “You put on bindis."

13:40.434 --> 13:43.200
Again I find you are just the same!

13:43.701 --> 13:45.267
At least here you should.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.100
This is Ganesha’s mark.

13:47.367 --> 13:50.033
They would not put it.

13:50.267 --> 13:52.067
It’s so many times I have said it.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.067
I mean, how much time does it take to put it on?

13:55.267 --> 13:59.100
Now this is a very common things that are going on.

13:59.267 --> 14:04.234
Now another thing is that a child doesn’t want to be dishevelled at all.

14:04.601 --> 14:08.100
Today one child had gone for a bath and was coming back.

14:08.300 --> 14:11.334
His father wanted him to see me, he said, “No, my clothes are not all right.

14:11.334 --> 14:13.033
my hair are all dishevelled.

14:13.067 --> 14:14.601
How can I see Mother?”

14:15.067 --> 14:20.067
So he went back, he put some oil on his hair, properly he dressed up, smartly.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.234
When we were young, we always knew

14:22.267 --> 14:26.033
all the Western people were very smartly dressed, properly groomed.

14:26.100 --> 14:28.167
They would never come with dishevelled hairs.

14:28.434 --> 14:32.100
But he said, “No, my hair [is] all dishevelled, how can I go and see Mother?”

14:32.601 --> 14:36.067
So we have to give up these funny ideas of fashions and all that,

14:36.067 --> 14:37.400
because this will all go away,

14:37.500 --> 14:41.400
you’ll lose your hair, you’ll all become bald-headed to look very funny.

14:42.300 --> 14:43.400
There’s no wisdom in it.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.634
But a child has wisdom! He wouldn’t come.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.467
He dressed up himself properly, then he came and stood before me.

14:51.534 --> 14:54.567
And this is what we have to understand: that

14:55.100 --> 14:58.634
our appearances are the expression of our inner being

14:59.267 --> 15:03.467
and we have to do certain things because we do not know to accept things,

15:03.567 --> 15:06.000
how to do things like a child does.

15:06.367 --> 15:10.267
A child if you tell him anything, he obeys and he listens.

15:11.334 --> 15:14.100
Otherwise the child is not a normal child.

15:14.367 --> 15:16.500
In India if there’s a child who doesn’t obey,

15:16.634 --> 15:20.367
they just thrash him nicely, put him in the room for three days,

15:20.467 --> 15:25.000
make him starve and put him right; nothing doing!

15:25.701 --> 15:29.167
That doesn’t mean the people are harsh here with children.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.400
Nobody kills children or anything.

15:30.634 --> 15:33.534
But you have to be very, very careful with your children,

15:33.601 --> 15:38.300
you shouldn’t allow them to be lousy, to be untidy,

15:39.000 --> 15:45.767
to be languid, like lotus-eaters

15:46.701 --> 15:50.400
or like people who have no smartness about them.

15:50.601 --> 15:54.367
You are all Sahaja Yogis and you have to be like that in that way.

15:56.167 --> 16:02.067
A child’s another attribute is that he hits always the principle of everything.

16:02.467 --> 16:04.367
Always the principle.

16:04.634 --> 16:07.133
A child sees to the principle of everything.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.701
And the questions they ask sometimes are so remarkably collective

16:12.067 --> 16:15.234
that I am surprised how they go to that point.

16:15.601 --> 16:19.067
They never waste time in frivolous things, never.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.701
Never waste time in frivolous things, talking of frivolous things.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.067
Nothing of the kind.

16:23.100 --> 16:26.067
I haven’t seen children talking about their clothes

16:26.133 --> 16:28.767
or about the seats they have got or

16:29.100 --> 16:30.267
the houses – nothing of the kind.

16:30.567 --> 16:33.767
They are busy doing some construction!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.133
Very busy, you see. You ask them, “What are you doing?”

16:36.234 --> 16:39.667
“You see, we are trying to tie up the whole of the airport,”

16:39.801 --> 16:42.334
or the whole of Bombay, like that they will tell you.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.067
They are very busy people.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.234
If you see Realised souls who are children,

16:46.334 --> 16:48.601
they are always worried about the collective.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.434
And that’s what should be your situation

16:51.467 --> 16:54.400
that you should be all the time worried about

16:54.400 --> 16:57.234
the collective as a child is: that,

16:57.467 --> 17:01.033
“How I will help the collective?”

17:01.234 --> 17:05.400
But not worried about yourself, “What is my personality, am I that impressive?

17:06.067 --> 17:09.200
If I go to people, will they believe that I’m something? A Realised-soul?

17:09.200 --> 17:13.133
Or I am like other women or other men who are going to the hairdressers

17:13.200 --> 17:15.400
and having all kinds of hairdressing up

17:15.400 --> 17:19.334
and wearing all kinds of funny dresses to impress others?

17:19.701 --> 17:23.267
Am I looking like a saint?

17:24.033 --> 17:26.367
Am I behaving like a saint?”

17:27.200 --> 17:29.334
These things should come to you very easily.

17:29.334 --> 17:31.734
If you tell a child, “You are a Sahaja Yogi,”

17:32.067 --> 17:37.200
they say so, “I am a Sahaja Yogi, I can’t do that!”

17:40.500 --> 17:45.234
All the nonsense starts after they develop their ego.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.234
And then they start behaving in a funny way

17:48.367 --> 17:50.567
and it develops much more in the West earlier,

17:50.667 --> 17:52.267
but here it takes time.

17:52.567 --> 17:57.701
And the children are just accepting whatever God gives them.

17:58.133 --> 18:02.200
To them alertness is so natural.

18:02.234 --> 18:05.467
If there’s an aeroplane that’s going, they’ll say, “Bye bye aeroplane."

18:05.801 --> 18:07.701
Then there are ships are going, “Bye bye."

18:08.033 --> 18:11.067
To the sea they’ll say, “All right, sea, we’ll come and see you tomorrow!”

18:11.133 --> 18:12.601
Everything is within their mind.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.200
To them everything is there.

18:14.200 --> 18:18.000
They’ll come, you ask them, “How did you like it?”

18:18.000 --> 18:19.400
“Oh, we liked the grass very much.

18:19.400 --> 18:24.033
It was nice,” and everything they will tell you, the details about everything.

18:24.167 --> 18:25.767
So alert!

18:26.133 --> 18:28.067
And then they will say, “Oh, Why didn’t you do this?

18:28.167 --> 18:29.567
You could have put some flowers here,

18:29.667 --> 18:34.334
you could have done some flowers, would have looked nice for the hut."

18:34.400 --> 18:37.400
Or something, a suggestion they will give.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.467
Very particular on cleanliness, anything.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.300
And in childhood children get up very early.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.267
All the children in childhood get up very early.

18:47.367 --> 18:50.200
It’s a nuisance for mothers but they get up very early

18:50.234 --> 18:52.400
and that’s how I also get up very early.

18:53.234 --> 18:56.033
Getting up early is a child-like behaviour.

18:56.133 --> 19:00.167
Because the birds are singing, the sun is rising,

19:00.334 --> 19:03.267
such beauty in the sky and, “And Why am I sleeping?”

19:03.400 --> 19:05.067
They’ll wake up the whole house!

19:05.167 --> 19:08.500
But people don’t like it, sometimes they beat, not in India.

19:08.801 --> 19:11.100
In India people try to get up early in the morning.

19:11.133 --> 19:14.334
It’s regarded as something very dharmic and good.

19:15.067 --> 19:18.067
Even if we sleep late, we’ll get up early in the morning,

19:18.601 --> 19:21.534
that’s one thing. Then you can sleep in the daytime.

19:22.200 --> 19:26.234
But nobody sleeps over this thing like nine o’clock, ten o’clock,

19:26.267 --> 19:28.133
nobody sleeps like that.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.267
I mean, I have a problem, I don’t know what to do with myself.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.267
You can sleep in the daytime for a while

19:35.267 --> 19:37.634
if you want to overcome the night sleep and all.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.601
And you can be quite fresh.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.334
And you can be quite all right in the evening if you sleep for a while.

19:44.133 --> 19:48.200
But a child doesn’t think too much, he doesn’t plan too much.

19:48.234 --> 19:50.133
He makes fun out of everything.

19:50.234 --> 19:52.701
You take them anywhere, say, you take them to an airport.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.267
There’s nothing to be played about [there]!

19:54.300 --> 19:57.334
They’ll find out some groove somewhere, they’ll jump in that,

19:57.367 --> 19:59.067
they’ll hide there, play there.

19:59.067 --> 20:03.234
They can make play out of any gross stuff that we think is useless,

20:03.267 --> 20:05.234
they’ll make out of it.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.534
They’re very constructive and playful and that is what we have to be,

20:10.734 --> 20:13.267
Make play out of your life. Everything!

20:13.334 --> 20:15.200
You see, meeting people, talking to them:

20:15.200 --> 20:18.067
it should come naturally, not artificially.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.634
Also some people, I have seen, have a habit of putting up

20:21.033 --> 20:25.300
an expression all the time, like a smile or a frown or this thing.

20:25.467 --> 20:28.334
Children are never like that. Their muscles are so supple.

20:28.467 --> 20:29.801
They react all the time.

20:30.067 --> 20:35.400
Sometimes when they are happy, when they are unhappy, everything.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.434
The muscles all the time are acting like that.

20:38.467 --> 20:39.667
Nobody is tense.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.300
That’s why we have problems with our faces,

20:43.500 --> 20:46.234
because we keep them in one style.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.667
And these days the more miserable, you are regarded as more handsome!

20:50.000 --> 20:52.067
That’s finished!

20:54.400 --> 20:58.200
Or else some people just go on smiling all the time like this, it’s very bad.

20:58.267 --> 21:01.100
Or all the time absolutely feeling unhappy.

21:01.334 --> 21:09.133
You should allow the action of your emotions

21:09.434 --> 21:11.234
to be expressed on your face.

21:11.367 --> 21:15.400
I am told that it is said that, “There should be no emotions shown on your faces."

21:15.634 --> 21:17.701
I mean, I can’t understand!

21:18.067 --> 21:22.067
What is the use of such a personality who doesn’t show any emotions?

21:22.167 --> 21:25.367
I mean, you are not a stone are you?

21:26.267 --> 21:30.334
So all these foolish, stupid ideas which are given to us should be given up.

21:30.500 --> 21:34.067
And we should smile, we should laugh, naturally.

21:34.334 --> 21:37.200
We should talk to people in a natural way.

21:37.334 --> 21:40.167
And the child is extremely dignified.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.100
Shri Ganesha dances with His dignity.

21:43.267 --> 21:45.467
He doesn’t do frivolous, nonsensical things.

21:45.534 --> 21:49.534
In His rise and in His fall and in His movements and His steps,

21:49.634 --> 21:54.334
He’s nothing but His weight.

21:55.467 --> 21:57.467
So something cheapish He doesn’t do.

21:57.534 --> 22:00.234
In the same way there should be dignity throughout.

22:00.434 --> 22:03.234
Dignified behaviour should be within us.

22:03.334 --> 22:06.567
Now you have to judge yourself, how far you have become Shri Ganesha

22:06.767 --> 22:09.200
within yourself. Are you innocent?

22:09.500 --> 22:13.267
You think of cheating others, spoiling others.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.334
Like my television, I was amazed!

22:15.400 --> 22:19.133
I mean, I can never think of spoiling a television and this and that.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.434
These ideas, from where do they come into your heads?

22:21.667 --> 22:23.567
Why should we?

22:24.200 --> 22:27.133
I have never done it all my life, something like that.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.067
You know that I have always paid every duty, everything.

22:30.133 --> 22:32.400
Why should we do such a nonsensical [thing],

22:32.567 --> 22:37.167
to spoil the television and spoil it, make it look cheaper, for what?

22:37.267 --> 22:40.334
How much are you going to save out of it?

22:41.000 --> 22:44.334
But all these ideas come into your heads, I just don’t know from where.

22:44.567 --> 22:47.067
Why cheat? We are Sahaja Yogis.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.667
We cannot cheat anyone.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.133
I mean, you can tell the customs, “This is the situation is.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.434
If you allow we’ll go, otherwise we’ll stay."

22:56.467 --> 22:59.234
It’s a negative attitude. Never comes to children.

22:59.267 --> 23:01.434
They are so plain and simple.

23:01.667 --> 23:05.200
Once we had gone, I must tell you how children are so simple.

23:05.434 --> 23:09.400
Once we had gone inside a port and

23:09.601 --> 23:12.667
my nephew gave me two tins of cheese

23:14.033 --> 23:16.000
and we were bringing it out.

23:16.067 --> 23:18.601
So my daughter who was a very small girl,

23:18.701 --> 23:22.467
so when we were coming and he asked, “Do you have anything?”

23:22.567 --> 23:24.667
I said, “We have some two tins of cheese."

23:25.000 --> 23:27.100
“Yes, yes and we’re going to eat it also.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.467
See we have opened one and we are eating!”

23:30.200 --> 23:33.200
The customs fellow was so impressed by her innocence.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.100
He says, “For your eating?”

23:35.100 --> 23:37.667
“Yes, yes for our eating, we have taken it. Is it all right?”

23:38.033 --> 23:41.267
He said, “It’s all right."

23:43.033 --> 23:48.400
You see, the simplicity and innocence is itself a certificate for you,.

23:49.133 --> 23:52.033
Not this cunning methods. What is there?

23:52.200 --> 23:56.234
I mean, precisely on the phone I tell them, “Oh baba, for heaven’s sake!

23:56.267 --> 23:58.334
I’ll pay every duty, you don’t have to do anything.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.701
Just put this thing there, tell that it is mine.

24:01.801 --> 24:07.801
You don’t have to do anything. Declare it, this that." Why?

24:11.634 --> 24:15.667
Where is our mind going? It’s all right!

24:16.133 --> 24:18.400
How much are we going to lose in there?

24:18.701 --> 24:23.067
How much have we gained so far in money? What do we have?

24:26.033 --> 24:27.801
Saving money here, saving money there.

24:28.033 --> 24:33.067
Children don’t do like that! No, they don’t.

24:34.367 --> 24:38.467
Like my grandson, he was saying, “Why do you stay in this wretched place?

24:38.567 --> 24:40.467
Very bad vibrations in London!”

24:40.601 --> 24:45.067
I said, “You see, your grandfather has to stay here for earning money."

24:45.167 --> 24:47.367
He said, “Money? Why do you need so much money for,

24:47.400 --> 24:50.067
why do you need money, why don’t you come to India?”

24:50.167 --> 24:51.367
I said, “You need money."

24:51.400 --> 24:53.400
So when my husband came back, he took out a two-p,

24:53.400 --> 24:56.500
he said, “You want money? Have it! Now put it on your head!

24:56.534 --> 25:00.000
Why do you want to have money?”

25:00.534 --> 25:02.734
And my husband didn’t know where to look.

25:03.100 --> 25:05.267
“You want money, all right, have it, put it on your head!”

25:05.400 --> 25:08.500
He was a little boy, you see!

25:09.534 --> 25:12.200
But interest in money starts later on.

25:12.534 --> 25:14.534
As soon as there’s money we start looking at it,

25:14.567 --> 25:17.267
when we grow up, otherwise we don’t.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.300
All this money interest starts going later on.

25:20.601 --> 25:24.367
What is for Ganesha? Money is the dust of His feet.

25:24.701 --> 25:27.234
What for Him gold? What for Him anything?

25:27.400 --> 25:32.167
Whether He wears a crown of gold or He doesn’t wear anything makes no difference!

25:32.167 --> 25:34.701
He’s is there! His head is just the same.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.000
Out of respect, out of adoration,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.334
people might give Him gold or anything just to feel satisfied,

25:39.334 --> 25:43.033
it’s alright. For Him what does it matter?

25:45.300 --> 25:50.500
And any child who is a real child will not accept anything from anybody else, nothing.

25:50.734 --> 25:54.133
But if he takes, he will think, “How should I return it back?”

25:54.267 --> 25:58.400
Always! I know my own grandchildren have done it.

25:58.467 --> 26:04.033
If you give them something, they’ll make a heart, put inside that, write it down nicely

26:04.100 --> 26:07.601
and when I come out of my bathroom, they’ll give me that heart,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.400
you see, that, “Thank you very much,” for this and that.

26:11.534 --> 26:14.500
But when we grow up we even forget to thank people,

26:15.367 --> 26:18.300
we take everything for granted, we don’t have that.

26:18.300 --> 26:20.601
We just think we have to judge everyone all the time,

26:20.701 --> 26:23.534
“That’s not good, this is not good, could have been better!”

26:23.667 --> 26:26.434
We never think, “This is given to us, be thankful!”

26:26.667 --> 26:29.267
Count your blessings.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.167
But for children it’s not so.

26:32.267 --> 26:34.567
If you give them a small thing, they’ll keep it,

26:34.601 --> 26:38.500
“This is given to me by my grandmother!”

26:40.267 --> 26:42.801
I have seen this in my own grandchildren.

26:43.033 --> 26:45.601
The eldest one when she was small I gave her a little sari,

26:45.634 --> 26:48.067
a very small one just for her to wear.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.167
So when I went there she said, “You see, nani,

26:51.234 --> 26:54.000
I must tell you one thing serious is happening." I said, “What?”

26:54.100 --> 26:57.400
“You see, the sari you gave me, I’ve kept it very carefully

26:57.500 --> 27:01.067
but my mother is trying to be funny!” I said, “What happened?”

27:01.200 --> 27:04.367
“You know, she didn’t give it to anyone but she showed it to some people,

27:04.400 --> 27:06.234
she should not have shown it!”

27:06.367 --> 27:08.601
Very seriously!

27:09.100 --> 27:13.701
They are so sweet and so beautiful when they say things.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.267
Like once I had given her a Wendy house

27:16.367 --> 27:19.300
and a Wendy house she made it nicely, she called

27:19.300 --> 27:22.601
her mother, “I have made a very nice house for you, come along!”

27:23.033 --> 27:25.067
So my daughter is rather tall.

27:25.133 --> 27:28.567
She found it difficult, she went inside the Wendy house and sat there

27:28.634 --> 27:31.300
and she said, “Haa! So what have you got for me to eat?”

27:31.534 --> 27:37.400
She said, “Mummy, when you go to somebody’s house you don’t say such a thing!”

27:38.133 --> 27:39.601
And she laughed.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.267
And she laughed so much that she broke all her Wendy house.

27:42.434 --> 27:44.400
So she came out and she told Me,

27:44.434 --> 27:49.467
“Grandma, you have not given any good training to your daughters!

27:50.133 --> 27:52.601
First of all, she comes to my house, asks funny questions

27:52.601 --> 27:57.467
and then she breaks my house, do you do like this to anyone else?”

27:58.434 --> 28:02.367
How innocent and simple they are!

28:03.033 --> 28:06.601
Like that there are so many things I can tell you [that] I have seen.

28:06.734 --> 28:09.067
The way they talk and say things, and all that.

28:09.067 --> 28:15.400
So simple and so good and so collective and so beautiful.

28:16.267 --> 28:18.734
In the same way we have to be.

28:20.601 --> 28:23.467
Another thing, a child doesn’t have any fear.

28:23.567 --> 28:25.267
A child doesn’t have any fear.

28:25.467 --> 28:27.467
Ganesha has no fear at all.

28:27.701 --> 28:31.500
In the same way you should have no fear, no fear at all, no fear.

28:32.067 --> 28:35.234
As long as your Mother is with you why should you have any fear?

28:35.400 --> 28:37.567
Fear of this, fear of that, “I am frightened."

28:37.567 --> 28:40.701
“I can’t do this,” “I can’t do that." That children never do.

28:41.033 --> 28:44.367
They’ll try everything, if you tell them.

28:45.100 --> 28:51.400
You should have no fear. I don’t know what fear is.

28:51.767 --> 28:56.167
In the same way you should have no fear, no fear of anything.

28:56.367 --> 28:59.300
Nothing is going to go wrong with you. But don’t do wrong things.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.200
If you do wrong things it will repel, it will work out on you.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.801
But don’t do wrong things, be straight forward

29:06.267 --> 29:09.267
and nothing can harm you, nothing can harm you.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.033
We have had so many experiences of this,

29:12.167 --> 29:16.667
how everywhere laid down for you, everybody is looking after you.

29:17.167 --> 29:20.067
There are so many Deities who are working out things out for you.

29:20.267 --> 29:25.300
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely careful

29:25.400 --> 29:28.234
that you do not develop this fear business.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.300
Because fear takes you to the Left side

29:31.400 --> 29:33.067
and once you go to the left side, you know the

29:33.200 --> 29:36.067
problems of the Left side is – first of all -you go against Ganesha.

29:36.067 --> 29:39.601
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

29:40.133 --> 29:44.267
And then you develop cancers, you develop all these things, fear, fear, fear

29:44.400 --> 29:47.500
and emotional problems and all these things come.

29:48.033 --> 29:51.400
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

29:51.734 --> 29:55.634
Joy is your emotion.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.000
In action you should be thoughtless.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.267
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

30:07.033 --> 30:10.767
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras are very simple for children.

30:11.033 --> 30:14.067
They are like that.

30:17.500 --> 30:24.067
Today at the base of the Shri Ganesha’s hill,

30:24.467 --> 30:29.300
we have to think of awakening the Ganesh tattwa within us.

30:29.434 --> 30:33.300
For that we have to meditate. We have to think about it.

30:33.601 --> 30:35.400
We have to put our time to it.

30:35.467 --> 30:39.534
Actually if I were you, I may not sleep at all,

30:39.601 --> 30:43.567
I will go to the seashore, sit down there, meditate the whole time!

30:43.667 --> 30:47.667
Before breaking the Sahastrara I kept awake for two nights

30:48.467 --> 30:52.400
and I was just all alone, all alone near the sea,

30:52.467 --> 30:57.200
all alone the whole night, working it out, for two nights.

30:58.100 --> 30:59.133
But what do we do?

30:59.200 --> 31:02.434
We think about our comforts, we think about this, about that.

31:02.500 --> 31:06.601
It’s not so! You are here! Such a chance!

31:09.734 --> 31:12.400
We get tired because we think too much.

31:12.567 --> 31:16.634
We know how to get out of this tiredness and this and that.

31:18.067 --> 31:21.400
So this is a very good chance for you [that] we have come here.

31:21.434 --> 31:23.267
Of course it’s a beautiful place and all that.

31:23.400 --> 31:27.100
But it’s mainly the thing why I thought of bringing you here [is]

31:27.234 --> 31:30.033
that it may suddenly give you a big boost up

31:30.267 --> 31:35.667
and you might rise very high; for which I may not be able to

31:35.767 --> 31:42.167
really arrange otherwise, this kind of ascent which is possible.

31:44.200 --> 31:47.534
Many of the Indians have not even seen this place before.

31:47.667 --> 31:49.467
It’s such a beautiful place and they are surprised

31:49.467 --> 31:52.267
that in India we have such beautiful places!

31:52.634 --> 31:59.634
And after coming here they have felt the beauty, the auspiciousness,

32:00.200 --> 32:05.334
the wisdom of choosing this place.

32:07.400 --> 32:09.601
It’s so lovable, so beautiful.

32:09.734 --> 32:16.000
But I hope I see the effects of that in you.

32:16.300 --> 32:19.067
Now you have to go and have your food.

32:19.300 --> 32:22.100
We have a very generous man who is cooking for you.

32:22.434 --> 32:28.133
Be careful!

32:38.067 --> 32:40.567
You shouldn’t spoil your health!

32:41.467 --> 32:44.734
Specially for those who have to go with us ahead.

32:45.100 --> 32:47.133
So be careful! They’re very generous people.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.067
My brother and the gentleman who is cooking for you –

32:50.067 --> 32:52.067
both are competing in generosity.

32:53.234 --> 32:54.534
So you be careful!

32:54.634 --> 32:57.400
Now only the Sahaja Yogis from abroad

32:57.434 --> 33:02.567
and non-vegetarians have to go first and then the vegetarians will go

33:03.033 --> 33:07.400
and after that we’ll have some music program.

33:08.167 --> 33:09.534
That’s how it is going to be.

33:09.567 --> 33:14.667
Tomorrow morning I expect you to go for meditation about five o’clock in the morning.

33:16.300 --> 33:20.033
Then have your bath in the sea.
