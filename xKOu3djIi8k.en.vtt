01:41.628 --> 01:46.698
1995-08-24 Public Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

01:47.043 --> 01:51.910
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:54.824 --> 02:01.713
At the very outset, I have to say truth is what it is.

02:01.914 --> 02:07.691
You cannot change it; you cannot transform it.

02:07.892 --> 02:14.059
You cannot describe it, but you have to experience it.

02:19.497 --> 02:22.827
Whatever I am going to tell you here today,

02:23.028 --> 02:27.821
you need not take it for granted.

02:28.022 --> 02:34.741
We have had lots of problems with blind faith.

02:34.942 --> 02:39.312
So, whatever I am saying, if it is proved,

02:39.513 --> 02:43.826
then you have to accept it.

02:44.027 --> 02:48.540
Because it is for your benevolence,

02:48.741 --> 02:54.895
for the benevolence of your family, benevolence of your country

02:55.096 --> 03:00.382
and benevolence of the whole World.

03:04.275 --> 03:12.106
If you see in modern times, people are very restless.

03:12.307 --> 03:15.919
And there is no peace within.

03:16.695 --> 03:23.281
This restlessness starts when you try to find the truth.

03:24.166 --> 03:28.021
You may not be aware of it.

03:28.222 --> 03:32.104
But it exists.

03:33.509 --> 03:39.327
I am very happy to see so many people here in Brazil,

03:39.527 --> 03:44.775
in Rio, who are seeking the truth.

03:45.656 --> 03:54.244
At the very outset, again, I would
like to tell you what is the truth.

03:54.445 --> 03:59.031
The first thing is when you say this is my body,

03:59.232 --> 04:02.626
these are my hands, this is my intelligence,

04:02.827 --> 04:07.788
we talk of ‘my, my, my!’

04:08.154 --> 04:12.824
But who is the owner of this 'I'.

04:13.025 --> 04:18.314
This owner is your spirit.

04:24.275 --> 04:29.154
Actually, you are not this body, this mind, you are not your emotions,

04:24.511 --> 04:30.094
your intelligence, you are not your ego and your conditionings

04:30.302 --> 04:35.392
but you are pure spirit.

04:35.593 --> 04:39.252
Unless and until you become,

04:39.453 --> 04:47.790
unless and until you become the
spirit, you are going to be restless.

04:47.991 --> 04:54.454
That is what Christ has said, that you have to be born again.

04:54.655 --> 05:02.245
It is not like branding yourself "I am
born again", but it’s an experience.

05:02.446 --> 05:06.448
And you become the spirit.

05:06.649 --> 05:12.863
And you get all the powers of the spirit.

05:13.064 --> 05:18.494
There is another truth, which we have to know about.

05:18.695 --> 05:24.946
You see all this beautiful flowers, it’s a miracle.

05:25.147 --> 05:31.240
But they take it, take them for granted, you take them for granted.

05:32.966 --> 05:37.865
And we never think how they have been created.

05:38.438 --> 05:44.076
We don’t know anything about the living process.

05:44.630 --> 05:52.303
For example, if you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

05:52.511 --> 05:58.288
he’ll say it is an autonomous nervous system.

06:45.326 --> 06:51.146
So, you can ask who is this auto?

06:51.625 --> 06:56.094
In the same way, I have to tell you that

06:56.295 --> 07:03.480
there is all pervading power of divine love,

07:04.135 --> 07:07.982
which is a subtle energy.

07:08.208 --> 07:12.068
Which does all the living work.

07:12.269 --> 07:20.233
It has also done our evolution and we have come to this human level.

07:20.434 --> 07:26.296
But at this human level, we live in a world which is relative,

07:26.497 --> 07:30.570
it is not absolute.

07:31.405 --> 07:36.622
Why we have to know the absolute truth?

07:36.823 --> 07:41.709
Once we have an absolute truth, then there will be no quarrel,

07:41.910 --> 07:45.962
no fights, no wars.

07:46.507 --> 07:55.200
And all of them, all of you, will know the same truth.

07:55.401 --> 08:00.505
This is what has happened so far that everybody thinks

08:00.706 --> 08:03.455
this is the truth and another one thinks this is the truth,

08:03.656 --> 08:07.593
and they are just fighting.

08:08.286 --> 08:13.980
No religion is exclusive, you should understand this point.

08:14.181 --> 08:20.995
When Christ came, He talked about Abraham and about Moses.

08:21.196 --> 08:26.167
So it was not exclusive religion He established.

08:26.368 --> 08:30.071
Then came Mohammed Sahib, he talked about Abraham,

08:30.272 --> 08:37.835
about Moses, about Christ, also about
the Mother of Christ with great respect.

08:38.036 --> 08:42.935
So, Islam is also not an exclusive religion.

08:43.159 --> 08:50.870
The growth of spiritual life is described in every incarnation like that.

08:51.071 --> 08:57.095
But now we are fighting in the name of God.

08:57.296 --> 09:03.254
Not only that, but among the Christians, among the Muslims,

09:03.455 --> 09:08.881
among the Jews, they are fighting among each other.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.155
But once you know the absolute truth,

09:11.356 --> 09:17.082
then you realize that all these religions came on this Earth,

09:17.283 --> 09:22.740
as beautiful fowers of one tree of spirituality,

09:22.941 --> 09:26.733
at different times.

09:26.934 --> 09:34.918
And now we have plucked the flowers
and fighting with the dead flowers,

09:35.119 --> 09:38.658
bringing bad name to all those great incarnations

09:38.859 --> 09:44.127
who came on this Earth to save us.

09:46.661 --> 09:54.773
So, as it is, [inaudible]

09:54.974 --> 10:03.472
you have been already described about the
subtle system we have within ourselves.

10:03.680 --> 10:08.334
That works out this ascent.

10:08.535 --> 10:18.185
This triangular bone is called as the sacrum,
where this power of Kundalini resides.

10:18.386 --> 10:24.783
That means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone.

10:24.984 --> 10:31.072
Now, this resides in every individual.

10:31.273 --> 10:35.632
She is your own individual mother.

10:35.833 --> 10:40.519
She knows everything about you.

10:40.720 --> 10:47.689
Like a tape recorder, she has taped all that you have aspired,

10:47.890 --> 10:53.669
all that was your past.

10:54.716 --> 10:58.936
So, it’s your own power,

10:59.137 --> 11:03.151
which is to be awakened.

11:03.352 --> 11:11.988
It is like a seed which is put in the
Mother Earth and sprouts by itself.

11:13.636 --> 11:22.993
Now, the problem is that you have to understand that

11:23.194 --> 11:28.622
what life we are having today is extremely chaotic.

11:28.811 --> 11:31.665
Chaotic.

11:31.866 --> 11:33.973
You don’t know about your children,

11:34.174 --> 11:38.349
what drugs they will take. You don’t know about anyone,

11:38.557 --> 11:43.246
what wrong life they have lived.

11:43.447 --> 11:50.090
By forcing people to take to morality doesn’t work out at all.

11:50.291 --> 11:53.536
So something more has to happen to us

11:53.737 --> 11:58.588
that we develop our own personality.

11:58.789 --> 12:03.403
That we have our own identity.

12:03.604 --> 12:07.768
That we know why are we on this Earth.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.937
So, I was telling you about the second proof that

12:12.138 --> 12:17.537
there’s an all pervading power of divine love.

12:18.927 --> 12:26.711
In the Bible, it is said ‘Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost’, is called as.

12:26.912 --> 12:31.461
In the Koran, it is called as ‘Ruh’.

12:31.662 --> 12:38.488
And in the Indian scripture it is called as ‘Paramchaitanya’.

12:38.689 --> 12:44.108
Whatever you may call it, it exists.

12:44.309 --> 12:55.670
It thinks, it organizes, understands, it works out..works out,

12:55.871 --> 13:01.133
controls the nature,

13:01.334 --> 13:04.998
ultimately it loves.

13:06.056 --> 13:09.657
So you might find many coincides happening in your life,

13:09.858 --> 13:14.038
which you cannot explain.

13:14.239 --> 13:18.070
And you are surprised,

13:18.271 --> 13:22.660
these coincides happen because of the guidance

13:22.861 --> 13:28.829
of this all-pervading power of divine love.

13:29.291 --> 13:34.607
So, when this power rises within us into six centres,

13:34.808 --> 13:37.736
it pierces through our fontanelle bone area

13:37.937 --> 13:43.193
and becomes one with the all-pervading power.

13:43.394 --> 13:47.809
This union is the yoga,

13:48.010 --> 13:51.443
where you become one with this power

13:51.644 --> 13:59.067
and from your hands cool breeze like vibrations start flowing.

13:59.268 --> 14:01.634
In…with these vibrations

14:01.835 --> 14:07.575
you can know what’s wrong with your centres.

14:07.776 --> 14:10.888
You know about yourself,

14:11.089 --> 14:14.732
that means this is self-knowledge.

14:14.933 --> 14:19.827
Then you can know about others also,

14:20.028 --> 14:25.677
because you become collectively conscious.

14:25.878 --> 14:28.819
Your awareness gets a new dimension

14:29.020 --> 14:34.175
that you can feel the centres of others.

14:34.376 --> 14:44.137
These centres, are there which cater to our
physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual being.

14:44.338 --> 14:47.701
When they get exhausted or weaken,

14:47.901 --> 14:54.806
then you develop all kinds of physical, mental, emotional diseases.

14:55.007 --> 15:03.053
So when the Kundalini rises she nourishes
all these centres and corrects them,

15:03.272 --> 15:11.635
and connects you to that all-pervading
power, the source of vital energy.

15:11.848 --> 15:21.196
So, you get rid of your diseases and you become healthy person.

15:21.397 --> 15:25.182
In India, we have got four doctors now,

15:25.383 --> 15:30.725
who have got MD for curing people

15:30.934 --> 15:37.660
with Sahaja Yoga of their diseases, which are incurable.

15:38.737 --> 15:43.033
So, you know how to cure others,

15:43.234 --> 15:47.148
you know how to cure yourself,

15:47.395 --> 15:50.516
you become extremely dynamic with this force,

15:50.717 --> 15:54.916
also extremely compassionate.

15:55.117 --> 15:59.714
Many children who were very bad students have suddenly become

15:59.915 --> 16:04.556
extremely intelligent and successful.

16:04.757 --> 16:10.982
Thus all your problems, even financial problems are solved.

16:11.183 --> 16:15.892
It is fantastic, the way I am saying things to you,

16:16.093 --> 16:21.078
you might think that is something out of the blue,

16:21.279 --> 16:25.701
but you don’t know you are fantastic,

16:25.902 --> 16:28.499
you are glorious.

16:28.700 --> 16:33.164
You are glorious.

16:33.365 --> 16:37.626
But unless and until, you are connected to the mains,

16:37.827 --> 16:41.164
you don’t know yourself.

16:41.365 --> 16:45.198
Supposing this thing is not connected to the mains,

16:45.399 --> 16:50.744
it has no identity.

16:50.952 --> 16:57.423
Moreover, you give up all that is destructive.

16:57.632 --> 17:01.740
We have in America, if you see people ideas

17:01.941 --> 17:07.978
that you should enjoy every moment of your life.

17:08.179 --> 17:13.093
And all their enjoyments are self-destructive.

17:13.294 --> 17:16.633
They are saying that within ten years’ time,

17:16.834 --> 17:23.137
65% of Americans will be mad or schizophrenic.

17:23.345 --> 17:29.242
Or they will have other horrible diseases which are incurable.

17:29.443 --> 17:36.088
Because their lifestyle is absolutely unwise, immature.

17:37.077 --> 17:41.541
But if I say that, they won’t listen to me.

17:41.742 --> 17:47.678
If I tell them, they won’t listen to me.

17:47.879 --> 17:54.374
But if they get connected and the light
of the spirit comes in their attention,

17:54.575 --> 17:59.332
then they are completely transformed.

17:59.533 --> 18:05.536
I am talking of global transformation.

18:05.737 --> 18:09.597
Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.

18:09.798 --> 18:16.459
In Russia, in one program you cannot get less than 16,000 people.

18:16.660 --> 18:21.014
On the whole, they are not so materialistic.

18:21.215 --> 18:28.383
And at least, I would say 60% people are extremely spiritual.

18:28.584 --> 18:34.937
I just don’t understand how they have such deep spirituality.

18:35.138 --> 18:39.971
All other false gurus have been banned.

18:40.172 --> 18:43.245
That’s also very wise thing to do…

18:43.446 --> 18:47.902
that’s also very wise thing to do.

18:48.103 --> 18:52.130
Because there are so many seekers and they fall into traps

18:52.331 --> 18:57.477
of these people who just want to make money.

18:57.678 --> 19:03.499
You cannot pay for God or for spirituality.

19:03.700 --> 19:12.699
What do we pay to this Mother Earth,
which gives us such beautiful flowers?

19:12.900 --> 19:16.148
It is all built-in within you.

19:16.349 --> 19:20.789
And it just works spontaneously, Sahaja,

19:20.990 --> 19:25.802
you don’t have to pay for it.

19:26.003 --> 19:31.969
It is something so invaluable.

19:32.170 --> 19:38.196
As a result of this happening, you become enlightened.

19:38.397 --> 19:42.420
Your attention becomes enlightened.

19:42.831 --> 19:54.108
And if you pay attention to anything, you can solve the problem.

19:54.309 --> 20:02.578
You must know that this all- pervading power is full of blessings.

20:02.779 --> 20:09.561
It guides you, and it protects you.

20:09.762 --> 20:16.570
It is to be in the Kingdom of God.

20:16.771 --> 20:26.865
And the government of God is extremely alert and is very efficient.

20:27.066 --> 20:31.980
You jump into the ocean of joy.

20:32.181 --> 20:36.831
And you feel extremely secure.

20:37.046 --> 20:43.201
Once Sahaja Yogis meet together

20:43.402 --> 20:47.489
they have nothing but pure love.

20:47.690 --> 20:53.194
There is no greed and there is no lust.

20:53.406 --> 20:58.360
Sahaja Yoga has created many beautiful families.

20:58.561 --> 21:03.116
And also the children are very beautiful.

21:03.317 --> 21:07.022
So, this is the judgement time.

21:07.223 --> 21:13.584
You have to judge, yourself.

21:13.785 --> 21:20.631
And you will know whether you want the truth or falsehood.

21:20.832 --> 21:28.382
It’s working out everywhere and I am happy now in Brasil, in Rio,

21:28.583 --> 21:32.900
there are so many people who are seeking.

21:33.101 --> 21:40.846
So we'll have today here, tonight, the experience.

21:41.047 --> 21:47.839
But, you must have a pure desire to get it.

21:48.040 --> 21:52.418
That’s all is needed.

21:52.619 --> 21:59.005
And it will work for all of you, I promise.

21:59.206 --> 22:09.069
But if you are rude, adamant, and
don’t want it, it cannot be forced.

22:09.270 --> 22:14.287
It will take hardly ten minutes.

22:14.488 --> 22:21.652
But I request that nobody should walk out during that time.

22:21.853 --> 22:27.635
I have already told you that I cannot force it on you.

22:27.836 --> 22:31.844
Actually you have to ask for it.

22:32.045 --> 22:37.494
If you want, you will get it.

22:38.128 --> 22:41.665
So for ten minutes you have to keep quiet

22:41.866 --> 22:48.680
and if you do not want to have it, you should leave the hall.

22:48.881 --> 22:55.632
I have already told you it is your own power,

22:55.856 --> 23:00.690
there is no obligation.

23:14.435 --> 23:20.480
If you can all be seated, it would be better.

23:48.987 --> 23:55.517
There are very simple three conditions.

23:56.582 --> 24:06.999
The first one is that all of you have to be very confident about it,

24:07.200 --> 24:12.676
that means you must forgive yourself,

24:12.877 --> 24:17.117
you should not feel guilty at all.

24:17.318 --> 24:20.909
At this moment, please remember that

24:21.110 --> 24:28.341
this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness.

24:28.542 --> 24:33.905
And you cannot do anything that cannot be

24:34.106 --> 24:41.811
completely dissolved by the power of this ocean of love.

24:42.250 --> 24:47.450
So, please forgive yourself.

24:47.651 --> 24:49.810
Don't believe in people who say that you are sinners

24:50.011 --> 24:54.543
or something like that. Just don't believe in them.

24:54.744 --> 24:56.406
Because if you feel guilty,

24:56.607 --> 25:01.783
then the centre on the left hand side catches very much.

25:01.984 --> 25:08.318
And physically you are hurt,

25:08.519 --> 25:16.442
you get what you call Angina as one of the diseases.

25:17.185 --> 25:21.997
Or you might get Spondylitis.

25:22.198 --> 25:29.979
Or you might get what you call the lethargic organs.

25:31.684 --> 25:35.984
So why have this guilt?

25:36.185 --> 25:41.878
Actually you have to respect yourself.

25:42.779 --> 25:50.896
The third condition is you have to forgive everyone.

25:51.097 --> 25:57.051
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

25:57.252 --> 26:06.750
But if you don’t forgive, then you fall into bad hands

26:06.951 --> 26:11.876
because you torture yourself.

26:12.827 --> 26:18.024
While the person who has troubled you is a happy person.

26:18.225 --> 26:24.035
So don’t also think about them, because it’s a headache.

26:24.236 --> 26:30.139
And you will feel very relaxed with that.

26:31.568 --> 26:40.510
So again, these are the three simple
conditions that you have to follow.

26:40.711 --> 26:46.034
It will help if you can take out the shoes.
