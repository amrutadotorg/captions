00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
It’s such a great Sahaj Yogi, that he must have&nbsp;
really blasted you all, with so many expositions,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.960
which normally, we resist, very much.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:28.200
So, I have to say one thing, that,&nbsp;
this work is, of Mother’s Love,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.700
and Mother can never demand anything from you,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
least of all the reverence,&nbsp;
that is, due to a mother,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.160
only thing she can do, is&nbsp;
to love you, care for you,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.460
to guide you, to proper understanding.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.580
Sometimes suppose she has to take the&nbsp;
cane in the hand, for a very short time,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:09.420
but this overpowering love&nbsp;
cannot demand anything from you.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:20.100
Actually, sometimes I wonder, why should&nbsp;
they at all think of giving anything to Me,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.620
because they do not know I’m so helpless,&nbsp;
that I really cannot take anything, at all,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.860
it re bounce back, and, it is a very&nbsp;
different phenomena with Me which have faced,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.320
sometimes with people when I tell them,&nbsp;
that Love can only be returned in one way,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.520
that is only by assimilating it within yourself.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.540
Just by sucking it into your being,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.960
just by fulfilling yourself with it,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.400
to be, absolutely satisfied,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.100
to be transformed into a new&nbsp;
being of joy and happiness.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.760
To be the Lotus of your being, to be&nbsp;
the fragrant personality of this earth.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.320
If that happens to a Mother, is the biggest thing,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.220
She may be the most powerful or&nbsp;
whatever you may call her by,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.580
her only joy is in seeing what&nbsp;
she has, to be given completely,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.860
fully to the children Sampurna.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.940
Because anything that she tries&nbsp;
to retain, doesn’t make her happy,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.340
so everything has to be imparted, given to you.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.880
But sometimes as, Yogi has said&nbsp;
that people are not hungry,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.900
till a mother can’t bear her children starving,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.860
so she too create also the hunger, in her heart,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.800
in the heart of her children.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.220
A mood has to be set in, and thus&nbsp;
today we had a very nice program,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.180
describing the different deities,&nbsp;
awakening them within ourselves,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.900
setting you for your transformation.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.060
I am very much thankful to&nbsp;
Shrimati Urmila Devi Vardhan for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.620
giving such a beautiful&nbsp;
exposition of bharatanatyam,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.400
and also to all her accompanying artist.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.400
They have been very kind&nbsp;
to us. Thank you very much.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.980
Now, today as I told you, I have&nbsp;
to talk to you about the Shaktis,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.680
the powers that already exist&nbsp;
within us, and manifest within us,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.280
and when we start misusing them, how we&nbsp;
fall a prey, to some sort of maladjustment

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.900
and as a result, we become&nbsp;
sick or, we become, imbalanced,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.600
full of tension, temper, and all sorts of&nbsp;
abnormal behaviours come into our being.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.400
This subject is to be understood&nbsp;
better, if you had the book you can,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.680
you must have done some homework I am sure today,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:40.200
that within us lies, the power of Shiva,&nbsp;
the power of our atma in our heart.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:52.440
And this power of atma, is the witness,&nbsp;
which watches, the, clay of the power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.920
of the Holy Ghost.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.780
The atma is the reflection of&nbsp;
the God Almighty, and His power,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.280
is this all pervading power of&nbsp;
God, which is the Adi Kundalini,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.340
which is manifested within us as Kundalini.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.800
This, Kundalini, resides in the triangular bone.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:40.080
Reflection of God Almighty, Paramatma the&nbsp;
atma, watches the play, of the power, of Love,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:51.600
Love of God, power of Adi Shakti, his&nbsp;
own power of Love which is immeasurable.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.940
Which is Anand, which is, in destructive,

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.420
which does everything in this world,&nbsp;
which is called as Brahma Shakti.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:14.100
That’s the truth, the rest of it&nbsp;
is not, but still we are sleeping,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.060
still we are not aware of that&nbsp;
power, that is all pervading,

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.600
we have heard about it, in all the scriptures&nbsp;
that there is the all pervading power.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.120
Yesterday, I told you that this&nbsp;
Power is doing all the living work.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.300
Despite all this, we cannot feel&nbsp;
that Power, and we do not know,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.520
whether we should believe in this&nbsp;
great power that is surrounding us,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.300
whether such a power really exists or not.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.500
The reason is we are still, as a&nbsp;
human being, we are in a transition.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:02.040
We are not yet become that for which we were made.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:10.440
I would say that this instrument which is here&nbsp;
being made is not put to the mains, is of no use.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.820
Unless and until it is put to&nbsp;
the mains it doesn’t work out.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.500
Whatever it works out so caused&nbsp;
supposing somebody pushes it down and out

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.400
maybe also speaking on this or doing anything&nbsp;
is not being the real think is just false,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.780
it’s just artificial.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:36.660
So whatever we have been so far, without, the&nbsp;
connection with the, all pervading, connection,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.460
with the God Almighty, is&nbsp;
all absolutely artificial.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.900
It’s just mental thing that we are&nbsp;
doing, so this yoga must be established.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:01.920
Yoga means the union with God&nbsp;
Almighty for all understand,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.760
but it just doesn’t mean that you&nbsp;
take a plug and put to God Almighty,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.780
it doesn’t mean that way, but&nbsp;
it means that within ourselves,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.220
the whole instrument is made&nbsp;
and built-in in such a way,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:24.540
that only a Guru or an enlightened soul, knows&nbsp;
how to connect this instrument with God Almighty,

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.820
so that you become an instrument of God’s love.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:38.220
Now this happening is called as Yoga,&nbsp;
but Yoga also has another meaning,

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.560
“Yoga Kaushalyum Yukti”, that the&nbsp;
word yukti comes from that Yoga,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.020
means, with deafness how&nbsp;
to handle this instrument.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.160
It’s not sufficient for&nbsp;
anyone to get an instrument.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.700
Supposing you are given a car,&nbsp;
and the machinery is opened up,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.780
still if you don’t know how to drive the car.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.080
You cannot drive it, it is useless for you.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.160
And if try to do anything, you may spoil the car.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.980
Before starting the car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.920
if you start turning the parts like the&nbsp;
tyres or something like that or the wheels

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.900
the car won’t move.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:31.800
In the same way, without having the Yoga if&nbsp;
you try to do anything in the name of God,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.480
you are doing it artificially.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:43.500
So the yukti, the Kaushalyum to handle&nbsp;
this instrument, is also to be learnt.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.440
So first part, this is the Yoga, is the&nbsp;
sprouting of the Kundalini, the awakening of it,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:57.660
and breaking of the Sahasrara, I should say is&nbsp;
the job of a Sahaj Yogi or your Divine Mother,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:10.500
but afterwards to learn, the yukti, the&nbsp;
Kaushalyum, the kushalta, the debtness,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:18.600
how to develop this awareness,&nbsp;
into that stillness,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.900
and this awareness into that higher awareness&nbsp;
which you call it vibratory awareness.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.540
How to station it there is&nbsp;
the job of an awakened soul.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.960
So we have two different functions to&nbsp;
do, first is to awaken the Kundalini.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:44.940
That I know sometimes can be difficult, can be&nbsp;
easy depending on the sadhaka, on the seeker,

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.320
but the other part of it becomes much&nbsp;
easier for a person who is awakened,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.480
if he has real bhakti for himself,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:02.280
real understanding that he&nbsp;
is a person of some value.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:09.960
He has come on this earth, not to just waste&nbsp;
his precious human life and fritter it away,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.540
but for a very, very special purpose.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:20.880
All such people will dedicate themselves&nbsp;
completely to master the art of Yoga.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:28.680
Now many people ask a question that what is the&nbsp;
difference between Sahaja Yoga and other Yogas.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.740
There is no difference at all, because&nbsp;
if you see the Yogas which are described,

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.320
say Hathya Yoga is.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:46.320
Hathya Yoga was practiced in our country&nbsp;
when we had a very different of society.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.940
The children from about five years to&nbsp;
about twenty five years at the most,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.140
would go and live with their&nbsp;
Gurus who were all realised souls.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.660
In those days we didn’t have such Gurus as we&nbsp;
are having these days, all kinds of funny things.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:12.060
They were realised souls, absolutely detached,&nbsp;
of course married, living with their wives,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.280
and looking after the children who&nbsp;
went there for their education,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.720
and at that time this kind&nbsp;
of Hathya Yoga was practiced,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.620
where people lead a complete Brahmachari’s life.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.200
Today such a situation doesn’t exist at all,

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.400
so much so that the Gothra was&nbsp;
nothing but the University.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.660
Say supposing my Gothra is Shandileya Gothra.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.660
The university where the children studied&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.320
could not marry each other not in&nbsp;
one generation, ten generation,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:43.980
but till today.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:49.980
So the Gothra which are started that is&nbsp;
Brahmachari’s must be kept absolutely pure.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.140
But modern times are such that even&nbsp;
if you want to know your Gothra

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.860
I think perhaps that very few people&nbsp;
really know what is their Gothra is.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.680
So when this is the situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:09.180
of today’s society where the purity of&nbsp;
life is so much challenged every moment

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.720
where there is no sense of&nbsp;
Brahmachari among the children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.300
to practice that kind of Hatha Yoga&nbsp;
is going to be rather difficult

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:26.520
where you have to spend all your life in a&nbsp;
school under a realised soul who is a Guru

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.300
these days you see the quality of&nbsp;
Gurus and the quality of students,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:36.360
but in that also the first change&nbsp;
is that change is not only – making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.060
yourself thin or making yourself&nbsp;
of making yourself like an actress

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.980
it was not only a viyama&nbsp;
systems it was a ashtangas

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.940
out of ashtallas the first and&nbsp;
foremost was Ishwara Pranithan

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.100
means first is the Realization&nbsp;
establishment of God within yourself,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.540
and absolutely it is logical&nbsp;
and sensible to understand this

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:03.720
why Ishwara was to be established first because&nbsp;
unless and until Kundalini starts moving

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.320
you will not know what is your problem is.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:14.280
For example with your naked eyes you can&nbsp;
see the Kundalini pulsating in many people

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.160
if you come to our regular&nbsp;
programs you will be surprised

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.100
it pulses just like the&nbsp;
heart in the triangular bone

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.820
when it goes upward you can&nbsp;
see its pulsation passing

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.780
if you put your stethoscope you can&nbsp;
see the pulsation moving up to the head

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:33.480
where on to the top of your head in the Fontanel&nbsp;
bone area you can feel the throbbing clearly

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.047
which Kabira has described as&nbsp;
shunyeshikarapara anahathabaji

00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:46.560
and anahatha is that sound of the heart lub du,&nbsp;
lub du you can clearly hear on top of your head

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.440
and when it breaks that sound then you start&nbsp;
getting that cool breeze of the holy ghost

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.480
the Chaitanya Lahari coming out of your head.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:01.560
Now this is what one has to&nbsp;
understand is the beginning of Yoga.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.320
This is where the awakening has taken&nbsp;
place and Brahmarandra has been broken,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.940
but still it is to be fully established.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:17.340
This is the second part of&nbsp;
Yoga which is [coushallop ].

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.000
No in those days when Ishwara&nbsp;
Pranitana was so important

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:27.540
these days those people who are teaching&nbsp;
yoga don’t even talk of Ishwara.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.420
They lead a horrible life there is no&nbsp;
question of Brahmachari and all that

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.000
and then what diseases such people can&nbsp;
develop, if I tell you you’ll be shocked.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:47.220
Those people who do such asanas and&nbsp;
such things which are only physical

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.720
develop their physical being.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.020
Such people can be very hot&nbsp;
tempered, extremely dry,

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:03.360
without any sense of innocence&nbsp;
and of purity and auspiciousness.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:13.860
Such people can be extremely cruel&nbsp;
and can even beat their wives,

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.940
beat their children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:23.520
and can be so dry that if a Sahaj Yogi tries&nbsp;
to raise the Kundalini of such a person

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.640
they might get blisters on their hands.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:34.740
These people may end up with so many diseases&nbsp;
which may not be cured by the Viyamas they do.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:41.820
These people become very right sided ego oriented&nbsp;
people and they think no end of themselves.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:48.420
At the most if they go beyond the&nbsp;
limits they can become so cruel

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:54.420
that they can easily achieve&nbsp;
the personality of Hitler.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.060
I would say Hitler is one of&nbsp;
the examples of the extremes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.920
to which a man who is working out his right side

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:12.180
as we call it the physical side the&nbsp;
right side, the Pingala Nadi, can reach.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:23.340
Hitler should really warn you all off such&nbsp;
a great attachment to your body development.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.440
You are not only your body.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:34.860
Many people who come to Me I have seen&nbsp;
come for sickness and want Me to cure them.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.200
But one has to know that God has common sense,

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.680
He is the source of all the common senses.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:54.900
Those people who want to get cured if they are not&nbsp;
the ones who are going to carry the light of God

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.380
then why should God cure them?

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.360
The light that we have in our house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:11.400
which is just a lamp and cannot be&nbsp;
useful for producing light as such,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.620
are we going to repair it?

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.960
If we cannot repair it, the&nbsp;
great economist who is God

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.780
is he going to do such a thing as to cure&nbsp;
a person who has nothing to do with God

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.040
who is not going to work out&nbsp;
anything who is a ball case.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:36.600
Know at the very outset if you read Gita you&nbsp;
will find that Shri Krishna has clearly said,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.740
“They are already dead people.”

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:48.000
He asked also Arjuna that you have to kill your&nbsp;
relations even people like Bhishma pitamaha

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.540
and his Guru also watch,&nbsp;
because they are already dead.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.740
That means whatever is dead is always dead&nbsp;
and whatever is living is always living

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:04.320
as He Himself has said that nanium&nbsp;
chidantish shastrani nanium dhathipahavaka.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.160
That spirit that atma within&nbsp;
you cannot be destroyed.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.960
So such people if they have a body&nbsp;
which is absolutely incapacitated,

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:19.080
or they have a mind which does not&nbsp;
want to receive anything about God

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:26.940
then the Gods forces recede back&nbsp;
and such people may not be cured.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:36.420
But a time has come where I feel God Himself in&nbsp;
His all graciousness and sweetness is so gracious,

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.740
He is so kind.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.240
I have seen in Sahaj Yoga that&nbsp;
people who are supposed to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.220
just directly going to hell&nbsp;
are getting Realization.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.240
It’s amazing! I am amazed at Sahaja Yoga!

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.580
That’s why I call it a Mahayoga.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:59.460
People told Me about man, that he is the&nbsp;
one who has done all kind of bad things.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.880
Even his wife has committed suicide.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.320
He is a man who drinks and&nbsp;
who plays this and does that

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.220
and he has done all sorts of things and now&nbsp;
he is absolutely finished and fagged out

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.880
he has no money left and he came to Me

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.740
and of course with great&nbsp;
difficulty he got his Realization.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.220
They didn’t tell Me beforehand&nbsp;
but the way he was difficult I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.740
was wondering what sort of a person is this.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.960
He had no diseases as such very&nbsp;
healthy person extremely ego oriented

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:41.040
but he got his Realization and when he got&nbsp;
his Realization he was a transformed man.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:47.700
All his shedrupules had fallen down he was&nbsp;
a different man his face was different.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.720
He was so beautiful and so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.620 --> 00:21:00.360
stunningly changed that even his own wife&nbsp;
could not believe that it is the same gentleman

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:08.940
because he had one wife had committed suicide&nbsp;
he had another wife who was absolutely pestered

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.980
and was about to commit suicide and she&nbsp;
herself said that, “Look at this man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.400
how has he changed what has happened?”

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:26.880
So that it is proved that God has really&nbsp;
become extremely gracious, extremely kind

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:34.620
and that is why yesterday I asked you to say&nbsp;
again and again that, “Mother, I am not guilty”,

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:40.740
not to feel guilty really don’t feel guilty&nbsp;
at all because whatever you have done

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.760
whatever may be your mistake&nbsp;
against God whatever anti God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.800
things you have done to others or to yourself,

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:53.940
forget it, it is time for you to get&nbsp;
Realization and all of you are going to get it.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.200
Another Yogas are Raj Yoga&nbsp;
and other Yogas are there.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:04.380
Now Raja Yoga is another thing which means&nbsp;
that you have to do kumbaka means holding up

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.260
and that you have to do&nbsp;
kaycherrie and all those things.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.720
Actually it is brought out in such&nbsp;
a funny way that you’ll be amazed

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.540
that the way people follow it is something like&nbsp;
before starting the car you start moving the wheel

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:25.140
the, the, what you call – – – the steering&nbsp;
wheel and you start pulling the choke

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.980
in the same we follow Raga Yoga these days.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.980
There was a gentleman who use&nbsp;
to cut the tongue in America

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.360
who use to cut the tongue of people and&nbsp;
used to push them back here mechanically

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.470
to call it a kaycherrie.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:45.240
Kabira is his exposition has&nbsp;
clearly absolutely condemned it

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.680
and he said this kind of nonsense&nbsp;
is not going to take you to God.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:57.060
Also like shaving your head or wearing a&nbsp;
kashiya vastra and all that kind of a show,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:03.060
is not going to take you to Got, he said it that,&nbsp;
“If shaving your head is going to take you to God,

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.280
then what do you think about the sheep&nbsp;
that is shaved every year, twice.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.780
It must go to God first.”

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:16.440
So all these nonsensical ideas&nbsp;
about Yoga are to be canceled

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:22.320
because Raga Yoga is the thing that actually&nbsp;
happens within us when the Kundalini rises,

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:33.240
it’s a tremendous happening, and there are so&nbsp;
many activities that come into going to play

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:38.220
that is impossible to describe&nbsp;
in one lecture what all happens,

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:45.780
but imagine an energy going up and all the&nbsp;
centres going into motion and commotion

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.320
fixing up the Kundalini in its&nbsp;
proper place supporting it,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.460
they have to do so many things simultaneously as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.460
we cannot describe even a simple&nbsp;
thing like digestion of food

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.480
which is so autonomous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:04.440
we cannot describe that happening which&nbsp;
is so subtle and so quick and so alert.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.420
But by putting your tongue in your throat and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.440
wagging it all your life you are&nbsp;
not going to go near God at all.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.320
On the contrary God is going to be very angry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.960
with you for being cruel to&nbsp;
yourself for nothing at all.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.740
This concept comes from I don’t know from where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.760
that you can do all the Yogas&nbsp;
without really being the Yoga.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.320
The real Yoga is spontaneous is living process.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:38.820
Is a process which is the Sahaja,&nbsp;
Saha means “with”, ja means “born”,

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.980
is born with you.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.740
We never think how we digest our food do we?

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.060
We don’t know how we see things/ it’s the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:53.040
wonderful intricate camera that&nbsp;
God has build in our sockets.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:25:00.180
Now do we ever understand that this complicated&nbsp;
body was created by some energy within us,

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.980
and that energy is still there which has to give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:10.200
us this last jump into the new&nbsp;
awareness of self-Realization.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:18.960
Why should we not think that whatever we&nbsp;
have got so far has been absolutely free.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.660
You didn’t become human being by&nbsp;
paying anything to the monkeys did you?

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.440
How did you become human beings – spontaneously!

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.100
How did this evolution come up – spontaneously!

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:38.100
You did do anything about it, did you&nbsp;
stand on your head to become a human being?

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.180
Did you go to any school or to&nbsp;
any University to read about it?

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:47.880
All that is [white] for human beings&nbsp;
is absolutely free and has to be free.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.640
Not only free from money but also from breathing&nbsp;
and all those things like breathing now.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:26:00.240
Supposing if you have to breathe. First you&nbsp;
have to go to school and find out how to read,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.520
how [many] will exist even for a second.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.120
Reading has nothing to do with&nbsp;
God! Please remember this.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.200
Reading books doesn’t take you to God at all,

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:19.500
only thing is that if you read something&nbsp;
you may reach a logical conclusion

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.360
like when you come here and&nbsp;
you see an advertisement

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.460
you see that there is a&nbsp;
program of Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:34.620
If you think that by reading that advertisement&nbsp;
you have got your self Realization

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.140
then what should I call you.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.520
In the same way if you just read books and think,

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.100
“Oh I have read Gita, I have read this and I&nbsp;
have read that and now I have become viyasa”,

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.840
you are sadly mistaken.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.500
Even to understand Gita or to&nbsp;
understand Bible or to understand Koran

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:01.140
you have to have your self Realization otherwise&nbsp;
you can never understand these books also.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.560
So you cannot do it by reading on the contrary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.900
sometimes too much reading&nbsp;
can create a big problem

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:13.260
what Adi Shankaracharya has&nbsp;
called it as a sabdhachala.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.580
The right sided man who works with his Ida nadi on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.040
the right side on the right&nbsp;
sympathetic nervous system

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:28.620
is the one who works his physical side more&nbsp;
and his mental side he uses his kriya shakti.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.360
Especially in Delhi the kriya shakti&nbsp;
is overworked, everybody is planning.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.980
Planning what God only knows.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.200
With all this planning if this is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.020
be the situation it is better&nbsp;
that they stop the planning.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.600
Planning for the future! Future&nbsp;
doesn’t exist, so why should you plan?

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.360
Now anybody would say, “Mother, supposing you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.960
to go day after tomorrow then&nbsp;
you must book your – ticket.”

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.660
Yes then go and book it! Why are you planning?

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.280
You will plan up to the point let the car come in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.660
let this would happen then somebody&nbsp;
will open the door up to that point

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.240
and you find your car is punctured.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.180
Today the same thing happen, I started from My&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.360
house and the president was passing&nbsp;
through and every car was stopped.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:20.160
Why do you plan everything, make it so timely&nbsp;
you see that you should be absolutely timely,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.860
after all in living processes there is no time.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:29.160
Supposing somebody ask Me how much time&nbsp;
will it take for a Kundalini to be awakened,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.800
actually it only takes the split of the moment.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.017
Split of the moment! Really! [Shadhn]!

00:28:34.017 --> 00:28:41.100
Is less than a shadhn. Just a&nbsp;
wee piece of at time is needed.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.540
And it shoots up and it just&nbsp;
breaks through in some people.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.860
But in some people it comes up,&nbsp;
goes down, comes up, goes down,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.040
in some people it takes time even to wake.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.500
So under these circumstances&nbsp;
you cannot just say exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.160
what time a – a flower is going to become a fruit,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.880
can you say that?

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.360
Any living process you cannot time it.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.640
Only dead things you can time it all right.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.440
If I was supposing a dead person&nbsp;
and everybody was dead then there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.640
would have been no problem of&nbsp;
My arriving here on a dead car

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.140
because nobody would have acted – objected&nbsp;
or there would have been no problem

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:27.360
but as human beings are living as&nbsp;
everything is living there can be a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.900
problem in anyway no use planning for the future.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.440
That is how we have faith in our planning.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.900
God has all plans for us!

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.840
He has made all plans which&nbsp;
you can see within yourself.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:47.220
Beautifully He has planned all this and&nbsp;
this time also He has planned very well.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.200
The time has come!

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:57.840
This is the time of resurrection which was&nbsp;
announced by such a great rishi like Brigu

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:04.020
who was living thousands of years&nbsp;
back he wrote a book called Nadigranth

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.860
he has clearly stated about Sahaja Yoga what&nbsp;
will happen and how people will be cured

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.900
and how the Kundalini will be awakened.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:21.240
Not only that but when about three hundred years&nbsp;
this was one gentleman called as Bujander, he,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:29.100
he tried to bring it to the modern language&nbsp;
he said that this will start in 1970

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.460
exactly Sahaja Yoga started in 1970.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:39.180
So it is all planned in God’s&nbsp;
own ways He has planned it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:43.200
in that planning we have to see how we fit in,

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.800
how many can be saved that is very important,

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.220
this is the time when we call&nbsp;
it the time of judgement.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:54.960
The time of judgement has come, this is&nbsp;
the time you are all going to be judged.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.060
Now many people will say that, “Mother we don’t&nbsp;
think this is the way we are going to be judged”,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.120
if I ask them what is your&nbsp;
concept of your judgement?

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:10.380
I would say Michelangelo has done a&nbsp;
very great painting in Sistine Chapel

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.220
where you can see very clearly how&nbsp;
he has shown the whole Kundalini

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.220
and in Mahavishnu standing at Christ here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.100
throwing the people at Agnya&nbsp;
chakra on left and right,

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.640
they are coming down from left&nbsp;
and right and how those who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.010
saved are going above with the help of the Angels.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:30.600
It is so clearly how he saw the vision&nbsp;
he was a great thrastha and he saw it.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:36.420
Afterwards we can see in England, which is a&nbsp;
place you would not believe of Rishis or Munis

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:45.660
a great saint and a great poet who is not very&nbsp;
well know to us Indians called William Blake,

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:51.780
was born about a hundred years back and&nbsp;
he has written, so clearly, so clearly,

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.740
that it is amazing to see how these Saints knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.920
all these things so clearly&nbsp;
about Sahaja Yoga to come,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:05.280
that even where I will be staying in Surrey Hills&nbsp;
first, first because responsibilities are here,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.700
then the foundations will&nbsp;
be laid in Lambeth ville,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.460
actually all these things were discovered&nbsp;
when the things have been done,

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:17.340
so the, our Ashram is in Lambeth&nbsp;
ville where we have put the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.480
foundation and there it is written clearly

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.020
even the house that I am occupying now is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.580
on the Tyburn Brook and is all&nbsp;
clearly written to the last word

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.880
where the such and such person&nbsp;
will be living, can you believe it.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.660
And an Englishman saying that Jerusalem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.640
the place where people should go&nbsp;
for their pilgrimage will be London

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.440
I been after knowing the English&nbsp;
as they have been it is impossible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.620
for Indians to believe that a such a day will come

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:54.780
that Yogis will be settled in London but they are.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:00.720
There are great Yogis in London today.&nbsp;
Now all these thing have happened to us.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.220
God has organized everything.&nbsp;
God has managed everything.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.300
Inside yourselves also He has&nbsp;
managed everything very well.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:15.120
So beautifully that it is only&nbsp;
to be seen after Realization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.300
how things are beautifully done within ourselves.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:26.700
But is it the human ignorance&nbsp;
and freedom put together

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.820
because animals are pashus&nbsp;
there are impartial of God

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:34.500
but human beings with their freedom and&nbsp;
ignorance have created some mistakes,

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:39.000
doesn’t matter, doesn’t matter,&nbsp;
as long as you are seeking God,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.240
you will get your Realization&nbsp;
you are beautifully made inside.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:52.020
There is a beautiful picture which we will show&nbsp;
you tomorrow as to what the chakras there are

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:57.600
and how the Kundalini resting in&nbsp;
the triangular bone rises gradually

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:04.780
and passes through these chakras and&nbsp;
crosses over and breaks this Sahasrara.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:12.360
It was said since long, because even&nbsp;
Indra was given Realization so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.240
can imagine how old is this&nbsp;
custom of giving Realization.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.880
At the time of Janaka who was&nbsp;
the father in law of Shri Rama&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.620
it is mentioned that Nachiketha&nbsp;
got Realization, one person.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:34.200
Now that time one person all right on the tree&nbsp;
of life there are few flowers at the beginning

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.780
but as the blossom time comes&nbsp;
there are so many flowers and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.980
all these flowers are to become the fruits.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.460
But if the flowers turn their face away from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:52.380
sun, you can’t help it because these&nbsp;
flowers are not like ordinary flowers.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:59.580
They have freedom to choose either the&nbsp;
God’s Kingdom or the satanic Kingdom.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:07.740
It is their choice and ardent desire to be in&nbsp;
the Kingdom of God which is going to work it out.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:14.700
So it is left to us to decide&nbsp;
within our heart to know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.820
everything is done beautifully within yourselves.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.600
We have three powers already&nbsp;
manifesting within us.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:31.680
The first power as I told you yesterday when we&nbsp;
were doing the action of raising the Kundalini&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.220
is the left side power of desire.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:41.160
Desire. But all of our desires&nbsp;
are weak root, are perverted,

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:48.120
because whatever desire we have does not&nbsp;
give you full satisfaction disaffection.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:55.260
Now the principle of economics that once&nbsp;
in general is not they are not satiable,

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.700
in particular there for example&nbsp;
if I want to have a little house,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.180
you will have the house but you are not satisfied

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.860
the house does not satisfy so will you want&nbsp;
to buy carpets so want buy the carpets,

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.240
then you try to furnish the house&nbsp;
still your are not satisfied,

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.820
now you want to have a car, and get a car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.820
then you want to start a factory,&nbsp;
still you are not satisfied,

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.300
means none of these things give&nbsp;
you satisfaction these material&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.520
things which you have changed from one to another.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:32.460
So it is proved by economics itself that&nbsp;
material goals are not satiable in general

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.000
so why run after such a thing&nbsp;
which is never satiable like mad.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.220
If it is said by economics itself&nbsp;
let us turn to something else,

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:52.920
and the else is nothing but, is sent,&nbsp;
the controlling power of all the natures,

00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:01.440
and of all the beings within this&nbsp;
creation and that is God himself.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:07.200
That God resides within us as&nbsp;
spirit so we have to turn to Him,

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.800
as I said we have to go to the roots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.240
and know the knowledge of the roots&nbsp;
which is absolutely different,

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.080
absolutely different, from what knowledge&nbsp;
you have had so far, absolutely different

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.260
but you have to see for yourself with open mind.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.360
So we have three powers, the left&nbsp;
side power is the power of desire,

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.580
and as I said all the desires that we know of are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:39.540
weak rooted because they do not give&nbsp;
you the satisfaction of the desires.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.980
So there has to be something shuddha&nbsp;
desire there has to be some pure desire

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:54.480
and what is this Kundalini, and this&nbsp;
Kundalini is the one which is waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:59.460
for that day when as a Mother she&nbsp;
will give you your Realization.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.220
She is your Mother, and she is the one&nbsp;
who has been with you all your lives

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:11.940
and she is the one who wants all the time&nbsp;
that My child should get the Realization

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:18.060
and now this Mother is an individual Mother&nbsp;
she has no other child, you are the only child.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:25.260
She is very tender kind and extremely&nbsp;
knowledgeable she knows all about you

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:30.360
she knows all the mistakes you have committed&nbsp;
she knows that you have done wrong to yourself

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.800
but still she is so powerful that&nbsp;
she know that if she is awakened

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.720
she will throw away all other desires&nbsp;
and will come up and will make you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.660
meet your ultimate own which is your spirit.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:53.700
So we have the Shuddha Iccha. The&nbsp;
Shuddha Iccha is your Kundalini.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.800
Now the other side we have another&nbsp;
power, which is the power of action.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.940
This power of action we put into wrong thing.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:12.540
Always our action lead us into troubles as&nbsp;
I told you about science you take any action

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:18.120
you take first of all you are not&nbsp;
sure as to what you are doing,

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.240
now take to the ultimate which we think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:25.920
as the most noble thing human&nbsp;
being do, is to help others.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.660
Now, this at least you would think,&nbsp;
“Why should Mother challenge?”

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:42.120
This action also comes to you out of&nbsp;
complete ignorance, complete ignorance.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.300
I would say who is the other? Who is the other?

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.100
If you are the part and parcel&nbsp;
of the whole, who is the other?

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.160
Whom are you helping if this&nbsp;
finger is feeling the pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.660
and if I am trying to soothe&nbsp;
it am I obliging the finger?

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.400
Am I doing anything for the finger?

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.840
It comes out of ignorance and ego&nbsp;
that we are trying to help others,

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.160
actually you are helping yourself.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.200
Perhaps also you are doing it to pamper your ego,

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:25.140
I have seen people who have got big&nbsp;
awards for being very helpful to the poor.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:32.820
I have seen the temperament such hot&nbsp;
tempered horrid absolutely thin like sticks

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.320
horribly place about their own position.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:43.560
Such people what good can they do even&nbsp;
their own personality is abhorrent

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.180
I mean people when they see such a person&nbsp;
are really frightened and are overawed,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.880
what a matron this lady is as she is supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.060
to be helping people in some&nbsp;
sort of a nonsensical thing.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:01.080
Like somebody says you take hundred rupees,&nbsp;
I’ll give you hundred rupees I’ll help you.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.900
All right you have helped the man&nbsp;
by a hundred rupees, Forget it!

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.560
What is a hundred rupees? Forget it!

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.680
Just you have not helped, just given it.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.500
I would quote My father in this, because My father&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.700
was a another great Realized Soul&nbsp;
which we really, can be legendary,

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.680
I know that he was an extremely&nbsp;
generous man, extremely generous man

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:28.320
and he gave everything that he&nbsp;
had for the struggle of India.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.100
But his generosity was so great that every Sunday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.040
he used to distribute some&nbsp;
blankets and things like that

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.620
sitting outside in My house just passing over&nbsp;
like that and his head always bent like that.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.980
So one day a friend a gentleman&nbsp;
said, “Sir, what are you dong?”

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:49.560
You are giving two blankets to one person, and&nbsp;
some people are running away with three blankets,

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:55.260
he said [sela] “I am not giving. If you&nbsp;
think I am giving you are sadly mistaken.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.980
I am just an instrument I am sitting&nbsp;
here and I am just passing it.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.980
Now if somebody wants to take more,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.680
let the organizer see it, I have&nbsp;
nothing to do, I am just passing it.

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.420
That’s not my job. My job is just to stand&nbsp;
here and give it to people who want it.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.140
I don’t see who is rich or poor, who&nbsp;
wants it or not, that is not my job.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:18.600
That is the job of the organizer who wants&nbsp;
to do this. That kind of a thing it was.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.660
So what is that you have give a hundred or a lakh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.360
of rupees may be you might have&nbsp;
done it just for your names sake?

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.920
It has no value intrinsically of any punyas.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.840
You have won no punyas at all.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.860
The punyas are only won when you&nbsp;
just do it without looking at it.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:42.660
But it is very difficult, very difficult,&nbsp;
only a realised soul can do it.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.240
Who gives away without even&nbsp;
knowing he has given away.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.340
Only a realised soul is like that.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.280
You will be amazed that I don’t know how many&nbsp;
people I must have cured I have no idea at all.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.920
But one day I was sitting next to a gentleman&nbsp;
in a dance like this and he touched My feet.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.700
I said, “Who are you?”

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.800
He said, “Mother, don’t you&nbsp;
know you have saved your life.”

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.260
I said, “Saved your life! All&nbsp;
right forget it forget it.”

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.580
I said, “Sit down let’s see the dance.”

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.960
And I was trying to remember when did I&nbsp;
meet this fellow, I just could not remember.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.780
“But”, I said,” You were never sick?” “How can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.720
you be sick?” he said,” No I got my&nbsp;
Realization and now I am all right.”

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.940
His face was changed he was so transformed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.140
I just could not place him, I&nbsp;
could not understand who he was.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:26.460
So you can imagine, what a change a&nbsp;
person can achieve through Realization,

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:31.380
and a person who is supposed&nbsp;
to be kind and obliging just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.660
is flabbergasted and ashamed and embarrassed

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:38.100
that the kind of a memory one has&nbsp;
because you just don’t remember all this.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.320
It is not important to be remembered.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.080
It is not important at all&nbsp;
to remember these things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:48.720
and such a person has no value&nbsp;
for things that are so important.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.320
I tell you can live much better if you don’t&nbsp;
worry about so many things that you have to do.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:04.500
So with this right power of action we try to&nbsp;
do things which are really anti God activities.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.460
First of all that we buy something&nbsp;
and we think, “This is mine.”

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.620
If you say anything is mine that means&nbsp;
it is not I as I told you yesterday,

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:20.100
but this feeling that this is mine,&nbsp;
this is my possession, this is my thing,

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:27.900
I must look after it, is absurd I just&nbsp;
don’t understand that you all know,

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.420
you have seen that everyone dies.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:34.320
Anyone who does not know this, I&nbsp;
have not known anyone like that.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.080
Now when you die, you don’t take anything with&nbsp;
you, this you have known also, or have you not.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.520
No one takes anything.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:48.720
What you take is the kindness, the&nbsp;
fragrance you have spread on this earth.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:54.240
Even the people today who think I am&nbsp;
such and such, I am a king, I am this,

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.860
when they die people say, “Oh God,&nbsp;
thank God he died, horrible king.”

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.040
It is better that he died; we&nbsp;
prayed for his death thank God&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.840
he is gone and finished, he was good for nothing.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:11.700
All these selfish things we do with the idea&nbsp;
that, by that people will have respect for us.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:18.840
Somebody told Me that I accumulate money&nbsp;
because without money nobody has respect for us.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.173
I said “Really!”

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.720
I did not know people respect&nbsp;
anyone for money’s sake

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.040
if they do you shouldn’t care for such&nbsp;
respect because money is outside you.

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.120
You leave the money tomorrow; supposing&nbsp;
you loose the money you loose the respect,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:35.220
so why do you have such added mud on your&nbsp;
body of which people are giving you respect,

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:40.620
and such artificial respect, why&nbsp;
should you be so proud, “Throw away!”

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.820
People should respect you because you&nbsp;
are you not because you have money,

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.540
because you are today a big&nbsp;
man and tomorrow a small man.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.880
But that you are you is your spirit.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:58.020
The problem is unless and until you know&nbsp;
the spirit you may divulge or get in,

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:08.259
attached to possessions which are&nbsp;
attachments most artificial, most artificial

00:46:08.259 --> 00:46:08.272
END OF SIDE A

00:46:08.272 --> 00:46:10.440
Putting her finger on that&nbsp;
I hope it is not spoilt.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.180
But we worry it should not be lost before&nbsp;
Mother disappears I must get hold of this ting

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:22.560
but I am just enjoying it without&nbsp;
possessing it I am enjoying it.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.820
So what’s this of possessing, better give&nbsp;
the headache to someone and enjoy it,

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.620
other peoples things is the best.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:36.900
Actually I do that, to be very frank, I do&nbsp;
not possess even a single thing in life.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:42.360
I have told My husband please do not put&nbsp;
anything in My name because just I can’t possess.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:46.260
I mean if you want to put it, put it&nbsp;
but I have no understanding of it.

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:53.760
And those who possess I know such headaches they&nbsp;
have of possession that they can never enjoy it,

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.940
they can never enjoy it, the&nbsp;
point is as soon as the idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:01.140
comes into your head that it’s a&nbsp;
possession you cannot enjoy it.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:06.060
This thought itself is a disturbing thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:10.080
which takes you away from the&nbsp;
joy of that beautiful thing.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:17.940
So what is the thing that you have to&nbsp;
see in matter is the joy of [esthetity].

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:21.900
First of all the joy of esthetity which we do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.280
at all think that aesthetics are&nbsp;
possible without possessing it.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:33.300
We cannot think that anything can have aesthetics&nbsp;
until and unless and until you possess it.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.360
You cannot enjoy the aesthetics&nbsp;
unless and until you possess it.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.560
Thank God there are now museums, most of the&nbsp;
aesthetic things have gone into the museums

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.240
and headache is over for many, But still&nbsp;
people want to smuggle these things,

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:50.520
to buy these things, to possess these things,&nbsp;
to have such a big headache, what’s that need.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:56.400
There is no need to waste your energy in&nbsp;
possessing things which are headaches,

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.300
if they are not headache it’s all right,&nbsp;
but we don’t possess them let them be there.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:04.020
I tell you if you don’t worry&nbsp;
about it they will be there,

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:09.360
and they will give something more than&nbsp;
what is expected of material things.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.800
[Tape cut for 2m 07 in?]

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:20.940
Of the material – a thing, the value of that,&nbsp;
is the joy of giving material things to others.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.400
That’s the only thing I feel any matter has.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.980
There is no other value in&nbsp;
things which we can possess,

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:35.220
so must be the value in giving&nbsp;
the headache to somebody else.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.480
I tell you nothing like it. Try it!

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.260
Try to give away all the headache&nbsp;
to others and you will feel so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.840
relieved you sleep standing while you are horse,

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.740
as you say, “Holy base to solve”!

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:54.120
In the same way, if you try to pay&nbsp;
attention to somebody because he is rich,

00:48:54.120 --> 00:49:00.240
say he has diamonds or he has, I don’t know&nbsp;
some big car “Oh what a car it is this”,

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.220
England is very good for that.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:11.220
If you wear real silver, real – real&nbsp;
pearls, they start call you Madam,

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.240
and if you wear artificial&nbsp;
ones, they just bark at you.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.060
They know – all of them know, but&nbsp;
you see I am wearing it not you.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:26.040
But when if you call me Madam or even the&nbsp;
Queen Elizabeth I am not going to give you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.080
So why should you call?

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:39.960
The whole system is so artificial and so stupid,&nbsp;
it’s so stupid that for a person like Me,

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.940
I just don’t understand why should&nbsp;
we waste our energy after people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.700
who are not going to shell out even this much,

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.260
even if you give them the respect&nbsp;
for these possessions of theirs.

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.120
Once you start giving no respect for possessions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.500
those people who believe in&nbsp;
possessions will rise above

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.400
and will try to imbibe something higher.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:13.620
I have had lots of – complains about people&nbsp;
taking bribes, making big money, this that,

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:17.340
having – this big thing, and all – for themselves.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:22.980
Now the reason is, people are impressed by that!

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:27.300
People are only impressed by those&nbsp;
things so people try to acquire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.340
whatever you are impressed by,

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.720
people try to do that.

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.160
I’ll give you a concrete example when&nbsp;
My husband got transferred in Bombay.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:44.580
We were all simple ladies from all over, educated,&nbsp;
and we were all decently dressed Indian style,

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.560
we used to live in a very decent way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.000
good wives and all the way that we&nbsp;
had come from say good families.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.280
So we tried to keep the corner of a family.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:51:01.080
But then one lady came, and she was quite&nbsp;
– according to be a strange woman, you see,

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.780
and most surprising was the way she dressed.

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.800
Strangely and funnily all men&nbsp;
started getting impressed by her.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.920
I mean this woman would not even look at them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.440
she would talk to them rudely&nbsp;
she was such a funny woman,

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:17.160
but all men were attracted to&nbsp;
her, something must be possessed.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.300
I don’t know what was the reason,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.800
but the ladies who were so good and&nbsp;
nice started changing just like that.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:29.280
And they said if their husbands are interested in&nbsp;
such a particular type of a dress why not I do it,

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.500
and they all started changing themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.160
so fast that suddenly I found&nbsp;
Myself surrounded by all this

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.720
and they thought I am a stupid woman.

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:45.240
The trouble is, unless and until you&nbsp;
the Sahaja Yogis of course you’ll do,

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.940
but the people who are not even Sahaj Yogis,&nbsp;
must know that after coming to Sahaj Yoga,

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:54.180
your priorities are so changed, that you do not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:58.140
care for all other things which&nbsp;
are called to be positioned,

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:05.400
or big personalities, or you can call it – big&nbsp;
educated man, or some rich rajah and all that

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.220
but it cares for the Kundalini itself.

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.360
The Kundalini will judge you.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:18.840
We have one very ordinary boy, who&nbsp;
is a poor boy, his name is Morisho.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:24.180
Of course, by the help of Kundalini, of&nbsp;
course, your Lakshmi tattwa is improved,

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.640
so he has improved in his Lakshmi tattwa also.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.180
But he is a very great Sahaj Yogi.

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:39.720
I mean he is really -very great soul, and he is&nbsp;
respected much more, than any big man coming,

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:48.480
because we understand the intrinsic value of&nbsp;
a person is how far he is a realisied soul.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.900
So the whole system that we have built here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:56.280
which is responsible today for a&nbsp;
shock for us is going to change

00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:01.380
,and all the priorities are going to&nbsp;
change, our idealism is going to come up

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:11.160
and we are going to look at people for their&nbsp;
intrinsic value and not for their outside value.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.460
I don’t know how many of&nbsp;
you have met Mahatma Gandhi.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:22.080
I’ve lived with him in My childhood, and&nbsp;
though he was a very dry person, extremely dry

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:27.900
and he made us like scouts you see, and he&nbsp;
took us to task because it’s so necessary,

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.160
but the thing I learnt from him was, that the way,

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.000
I mean he was particular on&nbsp;
correcting himself every moment,

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.560
and saying things which will correct yours.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.720
This was the beauty of his leadership.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:47.820
We had a program something in Molanazas&nbsp;
all of them when I was a little girl,

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:54.420
and we were giving water and this supplying&nbsp;
to them prank, and then Gandhiji said,

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.160
“Better not go for lunch,&nbsp;
you better have lunch here.”

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.160
They said, “All right, whatever&nbsp;
you say”, very obedient people.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:04.740
So he got out he had the keys with him&nbsp;
because the bar, his wife, had gone out,

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:09.960
so he took out the keys, opened&nbsp;
the thing and took out, all rice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.320
wheat – what you call the atta, everything,

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:18.240
according to the people there were measured&nbsp;
them, put them, took about fifteen minutes.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.660
When he came back to, everybody&nbsp;
was very embarrassed and –

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:27.180
I think it was Colonassad said “Bapu, we&nbsp;
did not know you had to go to this extent?”

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.380
Ah “for us I mean! It’s too much!”

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.880
“What too much! Do you know, this&nbsp;
is the blood of my countrymen”.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:44.400
“I’m just a trustee. I cannot allow&nbsp;
even a drop of that blood to flow out.”

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.100
Can you imagine! That’s why he is a marvel.

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.700
He has detachment, was so&nbsp;
great that it impressed people

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.780
everybody was literally frightened&nbsp;
of him I had seen, except for Me,

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.800
because I was his favorite I think&nbsp;
and he used to call Me Nepali.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.840
And when I told him one day, that ah&nbsp;
“Bapu you are very strict with everyone.”

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.720
“I can get up at four o’clock&nbsp;
because I used to get up.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:13.920
I can do anything with My body it is very&nbsp;
good, but everybody is not like that,” he said,

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.660
“You are the old mother! I am not! I am&nbsp;
a father! I am going to put them right!”

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:22.680
And in a very strict way he also&nbsp;
used to treat children also,

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:29.340
but the best part of it is this, that his people&nbsp;
at that time when he created that atmosphere,

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:35.460
he created people without Realization I must say&nbsp;
with his own character with his own sublimity.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.780
He created characted characters who&nbsp;
respected people because of their quality,

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.200
and not because of their falsehood.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.700
But in Sahaj Yoga you don’t&nbsp;
have to give any lectures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.280
you don’t have to be strict like Gandhiji,

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.900
nothing has to be done.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:55.320
You are just given awakening and it happens.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:01.140
You are just a changed person, you&nbsp;
get that transformation automatically.

00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:07.260
Nobody has to do anything about it; all your&nbsp;
actions become directed towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.680
Now when a Sahaja Yogi meets&nbsp;
Me, he is always talking to Me,

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:15.960
“Mother that day I saw such and such&nbsp;
thing and my Sahasrara opened out.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:21.900
And then I went to a shop and what happened I&nbsp;
saw something and it emitted such vibrations,

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:25.020
that I felt tremendous love for that artist.”

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:31.440
The whole shop the whole system, the whole&nbsp;
thing changes and he talks like an, a, karmic,

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.120
because he does not do any karma the whole&nbsp;
thing flows, he becomes a third person.

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.660
He talks like a sakshi; he&nbsp;
talks like a third person.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:42.240
He doesn’t say, “I have cured somebody.”

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.520
He says, “Sahaja Yoga has cured that person.”

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.680
So he becomes separated from Sahaja Yoga,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.920
he is not Sahaj Yoga is the sense&nbsp;
that Sahaja Yoga is doing its job

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.080
I, the one, the ego is separate.

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:56.520
The Sahaja Yoga is doing this.&nbsp;
Sahaja Yoga has worked out this way.

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.200
Sahaja Yoga where does it exist.

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:04.320
It exist it in the Sahaja Yogis. In the hearts&nbsp;
of Sahaja Yogis, in the hands of Sahaj Yogis,

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:08.460
in their Kundalini, it exists&nbsp;
within them, in their spirits,

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:11.760
and from that spirit the&nbsp;
Sahaj Yoga is working out.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.720
So when they say that Sahaja Yoga is&nbsp;
working it out, they are actually saying,

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.520
the spirit is working out, a spirit&nbsp;
is detached, so they never say,

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:23.640
“I have done so, I have arranged. Mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.500
Sahaja is so great that as soon as we&nbsp;
went there the Sahaja worked it out.”

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.540
Now where is this Sahaja standing outside?

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:34.260
It is within your heart this Atma works it out.

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:39.600
After Realization you become really dynamic,&nbsp;
believe Me you become absolutely dynamic.

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:50.220
So far we have never known God’s real miracles,&nbsp;
His real way of dealing with human beings.

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:58.560
Some Sahaj Yogis who cannot receive the message&nbsp;
that I have come dream about it in the night.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:04.980
Because they are collectively conscious,&nbsp;
not only when the Realization comes through

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:10.680
they can feel your chakras on their fingers they&nbsp;
can feel it – properly what chakras are catching,

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.960
where is the problem, they decode it and cure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:17.520
it in collective consciousness&nbsp;
which is an actualisation in,

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:23.640
is an actualisation it is not a mental thing, that&nbsp;
we are our brothers and sisters. Nobody is other.

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:30.360
They can feel what is wrong with others,&nbsp;
they can know what is wrong with them

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:37.920
because the light has come within them, and&nbsp;
when that happens, then, you cannot help it.

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:42.480
You see, sometimes I am late for a program,&nbsp;
so people say Mother why are you late.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.820
Now somebody I see who is a great person who&nbsp;
has come to Me may be poor or rich I don’t know,

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:52.860
but he deserves attention, so My attention&nbsp;
starts going towards him like water,

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.340
it till he settle down, it goes on working.

00:58:56.340 --> 00:59:02.400
And when it works out, when it works&nbsp;
out, then only I leave the place.

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:07.020
Time, everything is for whom, for us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:12.480
not for use to be slaves of time&nbsp;
but we have to master the time.

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:17.880
Even in Sahaja Yoga there are so many&nbsp;
ways we can see how we master the time.

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:22.440
Like one day we were going to have a&nbsp;
Puja at about ten o’clock in the morning,

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.260
but I could not take My bath till eleven,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:28.620
and everybody said, “Mother better go&nbsp;
for a bath now it’s eleven o’clock.”

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:31.260
I said, “Still the time till then.” At eleven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:34.620
o’clock I went for a bath and&nbsp;
arrive at about twelve o’clock.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.040
So I said please open the&nbsp;
panchang [moon calendar] see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:41.640
when amavasya [new moon] finishes&nbsp;
they said at twelve, all right.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.200
So I am here at the right time, during&nbsp;
Amavasya you do not do any puja.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:52.080
So the whole planning, the whole system&nbsp;
of all telecommunication everything,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.180
of the Brahma you achieve it

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:59.040
and you master it and you know how&nbsp;
to handle it, Sitting down here,

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:05.700
you can know the vibrations of the&nbsp;
president of America, sitting down here,

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:11.220
you can communicate with a friend of&nbsp;
yours who is across thousand of miles.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:19.800
But this is not so important, what you can&nbsp;
do is the communication of Sahaja system

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:28.140
through this all pervading ether that is there,&nbsp;
so that you can work out so many things that,

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:31.680
it cannot be explained on&nbsp;
the ordinary human level.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.560
Now I will tell you one of&nbsp;
them which you cannot explain,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.240
and I cannot explain to you because&nbsp;
of difference in our understanding.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:45.900
I was giving a lecture in Bedford to at least&nbsp;
double the number of people that are here,

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.440
and when I was talking to&nbsp;
them about eight o’clock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.560
or so, the lecture finished about ten o’clock,

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:57.420
a boy fell down about three four miles&nbsp;
away, from that place, from a bridge.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:04.260
Fell very deep, and people saw him falling&nbsp;
down so they sent for a ambulance which came,

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:09.240
but this boy when they lifted him up, took him&nbsp;
to the hospital, found was all hale and heart.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.840
So they asked him what happened.&nbsp;
Nothing happened to you nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.580
broken, nothing hurt, what’s the problem.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:22.080
He said, “A lady wearing a white sari, came&nbsp;
down from a white car,” I have a white car,

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.300
“and touched me all over the places&nbsp;
I was hurt and I got cured by her

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:31.620
and she a little place she has left and&nbsp;
she told me that you come for this to me.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.700
And then she went away and&nbsp;
afterwards the ambulance came.”

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:40.320
When he saw My photograph&nbsp;
after two days, he told this,

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.140
because this was out in the newspapers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:46.350
first of all this was given in the news&nbsp;
that something miraculous has happened ,

01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:51.060
this man has seen a lady, who is&nbsp;
this lady? After two days, this,

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.270
they thought is was still some&nbsp;
actual lady who must have come there.

01:01:54.270 --> 01:02:01.380
He saw My photograph in the newspaper and&nbsp;
he said.” This is the lady who had come.”

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:03.660
So the gentleman was quite worried and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:08.640
he telephoned to the organiser Mr&nbsp;
Gavin Brown, to find out about Me.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:16.020
So Gavin Brown wrote an article, say – he said yes&nbsp;
it is so Havia word many such cases in India also

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.880
but to, to us to Indians we are more&nbsp;
modern in this, we don’t believe,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.760
but it has happened here also,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.860
so he wrote a complete article as to&nbsp;
what things have happened in India also&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.160
and they published it and they were amazed.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.960
So you can imagine what things&nbsp;
God can do and how He helps you,

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.120
and why should you worry about anything when&nbsp;
He is the one who is going to protect you

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:46.860
look after you and do everything&nbsp;
under the sun to make you happy.

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:51.300
This belief in God is now vanishing in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.920
thin air, but believe Me that&nbsp;
once you get your Realization

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:03.060
all His angels and Ganas are&nbsp;
looking [after you after you.]

01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:09.780
Ah, anybody who tries to trouble&nbsp;
the Sahaja Yogis, have a bad time,

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.260
and now the Sahaj Yogis have to hold Me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:17.280
“Mother please forgive them because&nbsp;
they have so much of bad time

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.100
that we ourselves will, that&nbsp;
it is too much.” I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.200
“Well I am not doing anything these are the Ganas.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.680
They won’t spare these people now&nbsp;
any more if they try to trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.700
you because no more anybody is&nbsp;
going to trouble the Saints;

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:36.240
they have done it with too much of it now the&nbsp;
time has come where no Saint can be troubled.”

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.660
Of course all the people who are fake. who&nbsp;
are anti God people they’ll be destroyed

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:50.880
and their images will be ruined but no Saint who&nbsp;
so ever he me be can be harassed by any bad power,

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.240
all of them will be punished severely and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:59.400
can be proved by many experiences of the&nbsp;
SahajaYogis who will tell you about it,

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.080
so all the protection is there.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.420
So many incidences that we&nbsp;
are thinking of publishing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.360
a regular book of the incidents that took place

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.920
and you all can verify if you&nbsp;
are rather doubtful about it.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:21.600
This is the blessing of getting Sahaja Yoga on&nbsp;
the right hand side when you believe in God.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:27.780
He does everything actually He does everything&nbsp;
as I told you that all living things has does.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:31.320
But in our ignorance we feel that we are doing it.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:36.120
As I told many a time that some&nbsp;
villagers were asked to go by plane

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.940
and they felt that if they have to take&nbsp;
less luggage better put it on their heads.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:45.180
So they put all their luggage on&nbsp;
their heads and they were believing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.280
that they are reducing the weight of the aeroplane

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:52.260
in the same way we believe that we are&nbsp;
reducing the weight that God has to carry.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.520
It is He who has created you, it&nbsp;
is He who has made you human being,

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:01.260
it is He who has to give you Realization,&nbsp;
it is He who has to give the joy

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:06.120
and it is He who has to give you the&nbsp;
citizenship of His great Kingdom.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:11.160
Is all a desire of a Father, who&nbsp;
loves, loves and loves his children.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:16.620
He adores his children, he adores creation&nbsp;
and that’s what he has tried to create,

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.600
an atmosphere today where people&nbsp;
will have to take to Sahaj Yoga

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.100
if they are not little bit frightened&nbsp;
they won’t come to Sahaja Yoga

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:32.640
so don’t be worried all these are just a fake&nbsp;
frightening things they will all disappear.

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.797
There is nothing to worry about it, as you&nbsp;
call in Hindi language a bandar bhakti hai.

01:05:35.797 --> 01:05:41.100
We just don’t worry, this is&nbsp;
just a fake warning for all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.860
the people so that they can come to Sahaj Yoga,

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.740
get their Realization and&nbsp;
settle down with in accessory.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:55.380
Now! Yesterday I was little on a very serious&nbsp;
mood and I warned you all people of Delhi,

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:59.880
because what I find that Delhi&nbsp;
is the weakest centre we have.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.960
The weakest of all.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.780
Ah people come to Sahaja Yoga just for treatment,

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:09.600
and even if they come for Sahaja Yoga&nbsp;
they just come and take it very easy

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:14.580
as if they have been to some – one of the&nbsp;
groups or ashrams or things like that.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:20.340
Sahaj Yoga is a person, is a, is&nbsp;
a thing for very serious workers.

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:25.560
It’s not meant for useless,&nbsp;
horrible unstable peoples,

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.000
and I don’t think that in Delhi you have&nbsp;
many people who are really steady to do it,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.280
I have en experience like that.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.540
I have tried everything, I have been&nbsp;
coming here for last eleven years

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:41.580
but the amount of great people I have&nbsp;
got in the villages of Maharashtra,

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:47.220
or in Bombay, or in Puna, or in Sulapur&nbsp;
and Kolapur and all that I tell you,

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:52.140
the, this is not even one hundredth of&nbsp;
that, that we could achieve in Delhi.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:55.260
Of some of the Sahaj Yogis&nbsp;
are very great, but very few,

01:06:55.260 --> 01:07:01.380
and the rest often are just absolutely&nbsp;
mediocre do not take it up seriously

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:04.140
that this is the only way&nbsp;
you can solve the problems,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:06.480
of this country and of the whole universe.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:15.000
For us, the Western ideas are very enamouring,&nbsp;
especially, I don’t know why in Delhi.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:25.020
And this kind of behaviour is leading them to&nbsp;
frivolous understanding of their own being.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:36.420
The whole thing is that Delhi is the&nbsp;
Dehlich of God’s kingdom or of hell.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:43.200
It is for you to decide now what you want to&nbsp;
create, hell for your children or Heaven for them.

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:48.180
It is a very sad thing that Delhi&nbsp;
people of course come in thousands.

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:53.580
In one of My lectures we had such a big&nbsp;
crowd that I could not get out of this place,

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:58.860
but it was just a crowd, a mob, it&nbsp;
had nothing, no quality of any kind,

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:03.180
I was amazed that all the muck of the&nbsp;
world has gathered in this Delhi crowd.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:07.080
It was so shocking that they&nbsp;
are not bothered at all,

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:11.220
they talk big about politics, they talk&nbsp;
this is happening, that is happening,

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:18.360
but how many of them really take up&nbsp;
seriously that there is a solution,

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:24.120
and let us all take to the roots, let us&nbsp;
cure ourselves it’s our responsibilities.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.200
Tomorrow, the residents of Delhi&nbsp;
will be blamed the most of all.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.940
Sometimes I feel like&nbsp;
cancelling all the, North India,

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.700
because this is the Dehlich of North India and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:39.900
if this is the case of the people&nbsp;
living on threshold of the North,

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:43.920
what is going to happen to the&nbsp;
rest of it, God only knows.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.580
So I today I’m again warning you&nbsp;
as I warned you again, yesterday,

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:53.940
that we have so many beautiful projects,&nbsp;
are starting in the Maharashtra area,

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:58.380
you can come and see for yourself with&nbsp;
your own eyes, which is so tremendous.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.480
Even the scientist then so many&nbsp;
philosophers, doctors, they have approached,

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.340
I have visited, of course all your institutions&nbsp;
not that I have refused to do that,

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:15.660
I have also spoken, to the – Doctors&nbsp;
– association, in this your institute,

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:22.080
but what they came out was so funny that they have&nbsp;
you got a file on how many people you have cured.

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:26.220
Imagine, I told them, do&nbsp;
you understand this is Love,

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.200
and you don’t get, keep files of Love.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.460
First of all you become realised,&nbsp;
why do you ask Me such a question,

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.000
am I asking any money, what&nbsp;
is there to doubt Me so much?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.040
You are asking Me as if I am a criminal.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.020
If you want to have Realization, please&nbsp;
have your Realization, and help your people.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.860
So, I have to tell you that be careful.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:57.300
The beginning and the end is going&nbsp;
to start from this particular Delhi,

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.080
and that’s why this name is given to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:08.040
so the people, who are on this borderline,&nbsp;
must know that you have to come up.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:11.880
You have to come up to the expectation of God,

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.800
who has brought such great&nbsp;
things for you on this earth.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.140
Who has created this Mahayoga first?

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:26.460
Please remember that you will be held responsible&nbsp;
later on and you should not reject it.

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.980
I hope you will make it a point tomorrow to come.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:36.300
As a mother I can only request you from My&nbsp;
heart that My children try to be chivalrous,

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:41.940
great as so many have been in this&nbsp;
country and stand up to it, and get to it.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:47.040
Know it is you who are the foundation&nbsp;
of this great work, of God’s work,

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:58.200
so spare no effort to get to this&nbsp;
great tremendous blissful work of God.

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:01.860
I am always at your disposal.

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.620
Those who have come to Me have gained in help.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:11.100
Today I say a lady, you wont believe that&nbsp;
woman was nothing in bone when I had seen her,

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:17.340
when I saw her, how she has changed,&nbsp;
and she is such a Sahaja Yogini today.

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:21.540
She said, “Mother now I have got a&nbsp;
new birth now forgotten my religion,

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:24.420
I have forgotten so called religion, I&nbsp;
have forgotten my country everything.

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.980
I’m beyond it. Use me whatever way you like.”

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.800
And the whole ideology is in all that are so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.100
beautifully changed and such&nbsp;
a love giving thing it is.

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.900
So I have to again humbly&nbsp;
request you to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:44.880
that the Ganges is flowing at your lotus feet

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:56.100
just take a dip and know that your Ghagar your&nbsp;
pitcher has to be empty to fill it the Ganges.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.360
Thank you very much!

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.140
Applause

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.660
Tomorrow I will be telling you about the chakras

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.220
and now we can have a little session&nbsp;
of Realization for about ten minutes

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:10.800
and tomorrow again we will have another session.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:21.720
So far nobody has given any questions to Me

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:27.480
so I would expect you to give Me questions&nbsp;
this evening so I will answer them tomorrow.

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.485
Just put the chair there.
