00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:10.786
Today, we are celebrating the birth of Jesus
Christ.

00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:33.926
The birth of Jesus Christ is very symbolic,
because

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:44.746
he was born
in such a manner that even the poorest of

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:51.176
poor won’t be born in the stable.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:01:16.276
And he was put in the
bed which was made of dried grass.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:33.306
He came on this earth to show people that
for a person who is an incarnation or who

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:53.035
is a highly evolved soul, is not bothered
about the comfort of the body.

00:01:53.035 --> 00:02:16.146
His message was so great and so deep, but
he had disciples who were not prepared for

00:02:16.146 --> 00:02:20.845
the battle they had to fight.

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:25.916
Is the same thing that sometimes happens with
Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:43.645
He had only 12 disciples, we too have 12 types
of Sahaja Yogis, and all of them, though [they]

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:53.476
try to dedicate themselves to Christ, fell
a trap, some of them, to the worldly aspirations

00:02:53.476 --> 00:03:06.255
or to their own hankerings.

00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:15.796
His message of love and forgiveness is the
same even today.

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:24.375
Preached by all, all the saints, all the incarnations,
all the prophets.

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:33.266
They all have said about love and forgiveness.

00:03:33.266 --> 00:04:03.216
If it was challenged or people felt that this
won’t work out, they were asked to have

00:04:03.216 --> 00:04:10.896
faith in what he said.

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:21.415
But they were simple people in those days
so they obeyed him.

00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:31.435
Some of them definitely were very good, some
of them half-baked and few of them were people

00:04:31.435 --> 00:04:38.646
who were doubting.

00:04:38.646 --> 00:04:52.646
He came on this earth to prepare for us our
Agya chakra and despite all his efforts one

00:04:52.646 --> 00:05:01.746
finds very difficult and the people who follow
Christianity have the worst type of Agya.

00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:06.335
Worst type!

00:05:06.335 --> 00:05:12.225
Extremely aggressive, extremely planning type,
futuristic.

00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:26.165
I mean all the troubles of the right side
are found in those countries who claim to

00:05:26.165 --> 00:05:31.366
be Christians.

00:05:31.366 --> 00:05:37.255
Even the early Christians who were Gnostics,
‘gne’, ‘gne’ in Sanskrit means ‘know’,

00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:46.075
though [they] had the knowledge, the beginners
were also suppressed and tortured by the people

00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:53.016
who were supposed to be in charge of Christian
religion.

00:05:53.016 --> 00:06:00.365
And so many Christians were massacred by the
so-called Christian priests and Christian

00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:07.885
churches, and still it is going on.

00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:21.546
What you find in the west is a great influence
of these churches on the minds of the people.

00:06:21.546 --> 00:06:27.495
Otherwise they are supposed to be intellectuals,
otherwise they are supposed to be analytical,

00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:31.075
otherwise they are supposed to be something
very brainy.

00:06:31.075 --> 00:06:39.625
But when it comes to temples and churches,
when it come to religion, when it comes to

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:49.615
Christianity, I think their brains are blocked,
completely blocked, by some sort of a mesmerism.

00:06:49.615 --> 00:06:59.165
They just can’t think that there could be
something very wrong with these people.

00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:08.785
When living in Italy, I found or I was shocked
how this catholic church was working out and

00:07:08.785 --> 00:07:16.835
what the priests were doing and all kinds
of scandals much more than we have in our

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:17.835
country!

00:07:17.835 --> 00:07:27.686
Money bungling and molesting women and having
children – I mean every sort of dirty habit

00:07:27.686 --> 00:07:29.015
they had.

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.515
Supposed to be priests.

00:07:30.515 --> 00:07:37.755
They were called ‘fathers’, they were
called ‘mothers’, they were called ‘sisters’,

00:07:37.755 --> 00:07:40.176
they were called ‘brothers’.

00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:48.906
And to me it was really a shock – I didn’t
know that such things are happening in the

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:53.996
name of Christ.

00:07:53.996 --> 00:08:00.746
What Christ tried to show through his birth:
there is no need to have very comfortable,

00:08:00.746 --> 00:08:09.515
great birth in a big hospital in London, no!

00:08:09.515 --> 00:08:20.426
The simplicity of his birth should have made
all the Christians extremely simple and not

00:08:20.426 --> 00:08:22.796
at all money oriented.

00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:29.395
For money they went all round, crushed so
many people all over the world, when you go

00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:41.395
to Brazil or to Chile or to Argentina, you
do not find a single man belonging to the

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:48.156
aboriginal people and they’re so unkind
to them.

00:08:48.156 --> 00:08:54.926
Unbelievable how aggressive these people are.

00:08:54.926 --> 00:09:01.096
Even in England, where theres protestants
I find the same thing among them.

00:09:01.096 --> 00:09:07.426
You must go on saying “thank you, thank
you” morning till evening, otherwise you

00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:09.196
are finished.

00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:10.196
Racialism.

00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:15.386
What was the race of Christ?

00:09:15.386 --> 00:09:16.965
Was he a fair man?

00:09:16.965 --> 00:09:17.965
No!

00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:18.965
Was he a white person?

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:21.356
Not at all!

00:09:21.356 --> 00:09:22.536
What was His colour?

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:25.445
He was brown like Indians.

00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:32.575
From where does this racialism come to these
Westerners?

00:09:32.575 --> 00:09:35.236
I just don’t understand.

00:09:35.236 --> 00:09:44.215
It has nothing to do with Christ or if it
is real Christianity.

00:09:44.215 --> 00:09:52.856
You go anywhere, you’ll be surprised, how
the faithful, simple-hearted people are misused

00:09:52.856 --> 00:09:55.015
by these churches.

00:09:55.015 --> 00:10:06.546
They’re used for voting, they’re used
for money, for everything – to such an extent

00:10:06.546 --> 00:10:20.036
that money was made, artificially counterfeited
in billions, by the church itself.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:33.166
Such autocracy, such control, such authority
they had that whatever they did was, the pope

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:38.636
is infallible, whatever he does is alright.

00:10:38.636 --> 00:10:48.465
No idea of sinning, no idea of hell, no idea
of Christ – which was nothing but purity

00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:52.606
and innocence.

00:10:52.606 --> 00:11:01.556
Christ had taken a hunter and hit all the
people who were selling in front of the temple,

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:03.656
because God cannot be sold.

00:11:03.656 --> 00:11:07.616
They were not selling God, they were selling
only goods, but he said the respect of the

00:11:07.616 --> 00:11:14.406
temple, talked about the respect of the temple.

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:21.246
Another great thing Christians have done,
is to blame Jews for killing Christ.

00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:22.246
Wonderful!

00:11:22.246 --> 00:11:32.325
Put all the blame on others, this is the speciality
of Christians even today, is to put the blame

00:11:32.325 --> 00:11:35.576
of what wrong you are doing on others, very
common.

00:11:35.576 --> 00:11:45.635
And this is what you see very clearly in those
countries, who call themselves Christians.

00:11:45.635 --> 00:11:47.065
They blamed Jews.

00:11:47.065 --> 00:11:53.876
First of all, those who were Jews at that
time might have been Indians later on.

00:11:53.876 --> 00:11:56.856
Alright, so they don’t believe in reincarnation.

00:11:56.856 --> 00:12:03.515
I mean to say the same Jews who were there
are born again.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:17.156
Thirdly that the Jews never killed Christ,
never, because in the multitude how can you

00:12:17.156 --> 00:12:18.156
decide?

00:12:18.156 --> 00:12:26.265
Is the judge who decided and ordered, he was
a Roman.

00:12:26.265 --> 00:12:33.866
So the Roman empire didn’t want to take
the responsibility of His death so they said

00:12:33.866 --> 00:12:36.756
Jews have killed Him.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:46.176
So Mr Hitler got after them and he really
tortured them, really it’s too much, one

00:12:46.176 --> 00:12:56.426
can’t even understand how can – he believed
in catholic religion, how could he kill small

00:12:56.426 --> 00:13:02.145
little children, in the gas chamber?

00:13:02.145 --> 00:13:12.755
But now the same people who were tortured
are also becoming very aggressive and now

00:13:12.755 --> 00:13:20.085
they are against the Palestinians and the
Palestinians on their own are Muslims and

00:13:20.085 --> 00:13:25.056
the Muslims are playing a havoc all over.

00:13:25.056 --> 00:13:38.956
So when you go through the history, and see
the life of Christ, what do you find is aggressiveness

00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:45.996
from one to another, from that to another,
passing from one to another.

00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:55.885
If somebody slaps somebody, the another person
will try to kill that person.

00:13:55.885 --> 00:14:03.275
So this religion has created this divisiveness;
people are just killing each other in the

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:08.325
name of God, in the name of religion.

00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:13.696
Even in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be surprised,
I have seen people taking advantage of my

00:14:13.696 --> 00:14:20.135
name, and trying to get into some mesmeric
groups.

00:14:20.135 --> 00:14:23.866
I can’t understand.

00:14:23.866 --> 00:14:29.885
Using my name, using my photograph!

00:14:29.885 --> 00:14:39.156
So beware this should not happen to you people.

00:14:39.156 --> 00:14:52.695
Using the name of Christ, the Incarnation
of Divine Love, they are doing all these works

00:14:52.695 --> 00:15:01.515
of violence, hatred, of cheating, I mean very
debased people.

00:15:01.515 --> 00:15:08.226
And from one to another it passes, to the
another it passes.

00:15:08.226 --> 00:15:12.055
Same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:12.055 --> 00:15:17.895
If I told somebody that you are no more a
leader, somebody else is the leader, immediately

00:15:17.895 --> 00:15:25.995
that person gets angry, he forgets what good
sahaj has done to him, he just forgets.

00:15:25.995 --> 00:15:31.476
If I tell him the leadership should pass to
somebody else, finished!

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:38.445
Then he forgets that whatever good was done
to him, whatever Sahaja Yoga has done for

00:15:38.445 --> 00:15:43.666
him, he’s living only because Sahaj has
helped him.

00:15:43.666 --> 00:15:47.926
So this leadership goes into the heads of
people.

00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:56.286
Sahaja Yoga is not here to make leaders out
of you, no never.

00:15:56.286 --> 00:16:05.255
It is just for convenience we have leaders
and if they become inconvenient we have to

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:10.306
change it, that’s all, as simple as that.

00:16:10.306 --> 00:16:22.446
But still I find this idea of authority is
something very great and they start using

00:16:22.446 --> 00:16:29.845
it left and right, everywhere it is happening
practically in every country, has happened

00:16:29.845 --> 00:16:39.386
and still happening
which is a very sad thing.

00:16:39.386 --> 00:16:44.916
This will never bring forth my efforts.

00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:53.146
My effort is to synthesise the whole, not
to divide, by no chance to divide.

00:16:53.146 --> 00:17:06.326
Only thing, whatever is wrong, whatever is
unholy has to be brought to your notice.

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:14.335
See as a housewife, when we clean the rice,
there are some white stones in it, we take

00:17:14.335 --> 00:17:15.666
them out.

00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:19.335
We don’t cook rice with that stone, do we?

00:17:19.335 --> 00:17:21.835
And such stones have to go out.

00:17:21.835 --> 00:17:25.696
So some of them are just like stones.

00:17:25.696 --> 00:17:28.475
You cannot change them.

00:17:28.475 --> 00:17:36.946
Namadeva has said that they are like a fly,
who when lives gives us trouble by coming

00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:46.676
on our food and by making us feel nauseated
and if by mistake we take her inside in our

00:17:46.676 --> 00:17:52.335
stomach, she is dead but still she troubles
us.

00:17:52.335 --> 00:17:55.636
These are all rakshasas, I should say.

00:17:55.636 --> 00:18:01.865
They can never understand Sahaja Yoga and
they will always try to trouble us.

00:18:01.865 --> 00:18:09.636
But what must the people who have achieved
Sahaja Yoga should do.

00:18:09.636 --> 00:18:18.715
Should they also take to such methods?

00:18:18.715 --> 00:18:24.056
I have never blamed anyone for anything.

00:18:24.056 --> 00:18:28.956
Like, people say, “Mother he didn’t give
any money to Sahaja Yoga so he has lost all

00:18:28.956 --> 00:18:29.956
his money.”

00:18:29.956 --> 00:18:33.975
I never say like that “He should have donated
some money!”

00:18:33.975 --> 00:18:36.666
I never ask for donations, I never ask for
money.

00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:40.166
Every time I say it’s all sufficient.

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:41.166
Don’t need.

00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:55.235
I have never asked for a single pie from anyone
to be given to me even when I needed

00:18:55.235 --> 00:19:05.686
because I know I don’t have that problem.

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:08.835
From the life of Christ one has to understand.

00:19:08.835 --> 00:19:11.576
He had no problems.

00:19:11.576 --> 00:19:14.396
He was fearless.

00:19:14.396 --> 00:19:17.156
He knew he was the son of God.

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.245
He had no problems at all.

00:19:19.245 --> 00:19:25.016
He faced everything, even his crucifixion.

00:19:25.016 --> 00:19:30.156
And people, I think, liked his crucifixion
or what?

00:19:30.156 --> 00:19:33.406
They carry the cross.

00:19:33.406 --> 00:19:48.406
Of course is the transformed symbol of Swastika
no doubt but still.

00:19:48.406 --> 00:19:55.626
He had to sacrifice his life.

00:19:55.626 --> 00:20:07.896
He sacrificed his life for all the human being
not for only white or black, brown or blue

00:20:07.896 --> 00:20:18.916
but he sacrificed his life for all of us so
that we could cross over our agnya.

00:20:18.916 --> 00:20:26.406
The condemnation we should do is not of others
but of ourselves.

00:20:26.406 --> 00:20:36.526
We can call that as a crucifixion of ours
by which we see as Sahaja Yogis where are

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:37.526
we going.

00:20:37.526 --> 00:20:43.846
I’m told there are some 80-90 Sahaja Yogis
who have come, who were mesmerised by some

00:20:43.846 --> 00:20:44.846
people.

00:20:44.846 --> 00:20:50.206
How could Sahaja Yogis be mesmerised?

00:20:50.206 --> 00:20:56.296
Is it possible?

00:20:56.296 --> 00:21:06.345
They never must be praying, they may not be
doing meditation.

00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:09.776
How can they get into it?

00:21:09.776 --> 00:21:14.605
And now they are asking for forgiveness.

00:21:14.605 --> 00:21:19.026
I forgive but that doesn’t mean they will
be alright.

00:21:19.026 --> 00:21:23.956
We cannot fix them anymore.

00:21:23.956 --> 00:21:29.686
We do not put spoiled apples with the good
ones, do we?

00:21:29.686 --> 00:21:32.076
This [is] no wisdom.

00:21:32.076 --> 00:21:37.376
They are already spoiled, and they should
keep out till I say.

00:21:37.376 --> 00:21:43.215
They should not attend any centre, they should
not come to any puja.

00:21:43.215 --> 00:21:45.166
They should let them cleanse themselves.

00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:52.105
Though a rotten apple cannot get well they
can.

00:21:52.105 --> 00:21:58.046
They should try to understand that they were
not Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:07.715
If a Sahaja Yogi can get mesmerised, then
what’s the use of doing Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:07.715 --> 00:22:16.026
What’s the use of getting your Kundalini
raised?

00:22:16.026 --> 00:22:23.896
That means that they are very poor Sahaja
Yogis.

00:22:23.896 --> 00:22:33.436
Surprisingly I have not seen this kind of
a phenomena in the west, very surprising!

00:22:33.436 --> 00:22:40.365
Western Sahaja Yogis, whatever they were,
they are great Sahaja Yogis, I must say if

00:22:40.365 --> 00:22:46.906
you consider the number of good people there.

00:22:46.906 --> 00:22:51.416
They have given up so-called Christianity,
they have given up all this nonsense, drinking,

00:22:51.416 --> 00:22:57.705
drugs, womanising, everything they have given
up.

00:22:57.705 --> 00:23:06.455
And I haven’t met one person who has taken
to drinking again or who has taken even to

00:23:06.455 --> 00:23:08.546
smoking.

00:23:08.546 --> 00:23:14.646
This Yoga bhoomi of yours, which is India.

00:23:14.646 --> 00:23:17.835
How could it happen here?

00:23:17.835 --> 00:23:20.676
Specially in Maharashtra.

00:23:20.676 --> 00:23:27.985
I think some devilish people are born in this
Maharashtra all the time because how is it

00:23:27.985 --> 00:23:36.756
they tortured each and every saint?

00:23:36.756 --> 00:23:43.906
How?

00:23:43.906 --> 00:23:53.176
How is it, they have been so much enticed
by somebody who is saying something which

00:23:53.176 --> 00:24:00.436
I have never said?

00:24:00.436 --> 00:24:11.006
Shows a very low type of people, very low.

00:24:11.006 --> 00:24:19.816
And they must have been always being born
in this Maharashtra, I am sure and again they

00:24:19.816 --> 00:24:27.846
are born today.

00:24:27.846 --> 00:24:36.436
I never wanted to talk about this at the jubilant
time like this when Christ was born.

00:24:36.436 --> 00:24:43.526
Yes, it’s a thing of jubilation because
He came as a Saviour.

00:24:43.526 --> 00:24:47.806
He did everything that is possible under the
sun.

00:24:47.806 --> 00:25:00.306
For us it’s alright but what about Him,
what did we give Him?

00:25:00.306 --> 00:25:06.006
In the same way many Sahaja Yogis go on demanding,
Mother we can’t even meet you, we can’t

00:25:06.006 --> 00:25:11.725
even shake hands with you, we can’t even
fall at your feet.

00:25:11.725 --> 00:25:15.776
We can’t do this, we can’t do that.

00:25:15.776 --> 00:25:17.245
It surprises me.

00:25:17.245 --> 00:25:22.146
“You must do this, You must do that.”

00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:28.076
All the time lecturing to me.

00:25:28.076 --> 00:25:31.585
What you must do?

00:25:31.585 --> 00:25:42.216
You must do, is to meditate and to believe
that this Paramchaitanya is My power and that

00:25:42.216 --> 00:25:45.745
you have felt My power within you.

00:25:45.745 --> 00:25:50.036
The more you are away from you the better
you will be.

00:25:50.036 --> 00:26:02.365
Absolutely, I can’t understand the demanding
nature of some Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:02.365 --> 00:26:12.396
They have got their Jagruti (awakening of
Kundalini) which would never have happened.

00:26:12.396 --> 00:26:18.176
If Christ wanted, He would have killed all
of them and lived very well, but I think He

00:26:18.176 --> 00:26:34.906
must have been fed up with the stupidity all
around.

00:26:34.906 --> 00:26:44.186
So at this time, we have to understand that
such a great Incarnation came on this earth.

00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.866
Of course he couldn’t give Realisation.

00:26:46.866 --> 00:26:51.945
Imagine the people who were about to crucify
Him, how could he give realisation?

00:26:51.945 --> 00:26:59.526
Supposing somebody comes with the dagger at
Me, can I give them realisation?

00:26:59.526 --> 00:27:03.095
It’s all right.

00:27:03.095 --> 00:27:06.786
Nobody listened to Them, nobody thought anything
of them but not you!

00:27:06.786 --> 00:27:09.696
You people have got your realisation.

00:27:09.696 --> 00:27:11.256
You are born again people.

00:27:11.256 --> 00:27:13.115
You are great people.

00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:14.686
Your potential is there.

00:27:14.686 --> 00:27:20.425
Instead of utilising that now, what are you
doing?

00:27:20.425 --> 00:27:25.605
How many people are really involved in Sahaja
Yoga?

00:27:25.605 --> 00:27:26.605
Introspect.

00:27:26.605 --> 00:27:30.786
They have their own business, they have their
own this thing, they have – How many are

00:27:30.786 --> 00:27:33.456
really involved in Sahaja Yoga?

00:27:33.456 --> 00:27:44.855
He had only twelve disciples, except for one
or two, all of them dedicated without realisation,

00:27:44.855 --> 00:27:52.195
dedicated fully to the work of Christianity
and which spread because they had not much

00:27:52.195 --> 00:27:54.906
idea about the whole thing.

00:27:54.906 --> 00:28:03.316
The Christians that they had were just converts,
useless people

00:28:03.316 --> 00:28:10.076
and I would say that if they did not do any
justice to the birth of Christ, one can understand.

00:28:10.076 --> 00:28:14.626
But what about you people?

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:28.436
Who are born twice, who have got their self
Knowledge, who are so equipped with all the

00:28:28.436 --> 00:28:39.845
powers, who are connected with this all power,
what you can call the power of Divine Love?

00:28:39.845 --> 00:28:51.376
All your powers can be utilised, can be known.

00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:57.426
It’s like some dynamic machine which has
started.

00:28:57.426 --> 00:29:10.235
Few wheels are moving but there are so many
wheels after wheels and so much you can do.

00:29:10.235 --> 00:29:17.296
I cannot blame the Christians who are so stupid
because after all they never got their awakening.

00:29:17.296 --> 00:29:25.095
Only some priest would bring some water, put
it on their head and baptised them, finished.

00:29:25.095 --> 00:29:29.595
But what about you people?

00:29:29.595 --> 00:29:35.126
I have lived because of you, because I wanted
to see that you people mature.

00:29:35.126 --> 00:29:41.106
That’s the idea of the Mother is.

00:29:41.106 --> 00:29:49.266
There are many who are matured, I would not
say, but still many have to be matured.

00:29:49.266 --> 00:29:55.115
Doesn’t mean that you should be able to
give big lectures, or write books or anything.

00:29:55.115 --> 00:29:58.075
But within yourself you should mature.

00:29:58.075 --> 00:30:16.615
Your own personality should flower into the
fragrance of love of divinity.

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:20.676
This is what I would say is the difference
between Me and Christ.

00:30:20.676 --> 00:30:25.256
He said “Baba I had enough, No, No, No more!

00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:29.506
With these stupid people.”

00:30:29.506 --> 00:30:33.485
Not Me, I knew what was the world like.

00:30:33.485 --> 00:30:36.146
I knew what had happened to this world.

00:30:36.146 --> 00:30:42.756
Today the world is much worse, because all
the religions are fighting among themselves,

00:30:42.756 --> 00:30:44.136
firstly.

00:30:44.136 --> 00:30:52.016
All the politicians are trying to be very
badly corrupt, competing in that corruption.

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:57.986
Nobody has sense of truth and honesty.

00:30:57.986 --> 00:31:09.406
Everybody is involved in the advertisement,
newspapers, media, this, that, which is the

00:31:09.406 --> 00:31:12.146
most corrupting influence today.

00:31:12.146 --> 00:31:23.676
With all this background, I know by the year
2000, Sahaja Yoga will come out in the whole

00:31:23.676 --> 00:31:36.435
world as something very great…(applause)
– You did not allow me to complete the sentence

00:31:36.435 --> 00:31:42.306
– if you people become real Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:42.306 --> 00:31:43.386
All of you.

00:31:43.386 --> 00:31:49.485
All of you who are attending to Me here.

00:31:49.485 --> 00:31:53.196
Even this much group if it becomes real Sahaja
Yogis.

00:31:53.196 --> 00:31:57.475
It doesn’t matter if I cannot meet you personally.

00:31:57.475 --> 00:32:00.806
It doesn’t matter if I cannot go to your
places.

00:32:00.806 --> 00:32:03.705
It doesn’t matter, nothing matters.

00:32:03.705 --> 00:32:10.286
Christ’s disciples worked when he never
existed.

00:32:10.286 --> 00:32:18.896
So it’s not important, what is important
is that you are the people who are responsible

00:32:18.896 --> 00:32:24.756
for the emancipation of this world, for the
synthesis of this world, to bring peace and

00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:27.516
joy and happiness to people.

00:32:27.516 --> 00:32:33.985
Just now when I was coming, people spread
the shawls.

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:43.406
It reminded Me of Christ when he came, they
brought palms leaves to wish him and spread

00:32:43.406 --> 00:32:47.676
their shawls on the ground for him to go,
and where does he go?

00:32:47.676 --> 00:32:48.676
To Gallows.

00:32:48.676 --> 00:32:56.956
He goes to cross, he goes for his death.

00:32:56.956 --> 00:33:05.376
When you show your love for Me, you have to
know that you have to love the whole work

00:33:05.376 --> 00:33:06.656
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:14.176
It’s not some personal relationship with
Me that is going to work out.

00:33:14.176 --> 00:33:18.716
All these western countries in the influence
of Christianity will go down, you will see.

00:33:18.716 --> 00:33:22.016
They are going down already because there’s
is no morality.

00:33:22.016 --> 00:33:29.006
There’s recession, all kinds of problems,
their children are wavered, they are drinking,

00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:31.206
smoking, doing all kinds of things.

00:33:31.206 --> 00:33:34.506
Even their influence on us is corrupting us.

00:33:34.506 --> 00:33:37.746
Antichrist activity, throughout if you find.

00:33:37.746 --> 00:33:40.386
It’s nothing but antichrist activity.

00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:44.536
Who is the Antichrist?

00:33:44.536 --> 00:33:49.316
They are describing he is the antichrist,
that fellow is the Antichrist.

00:33:49.316 --> 00:33:50.686
That’s not the thing.

00:33:50.686 --> 00:34:00.556
There is an antichrist within us, who accepts
all these things which are against the purity

00:34:00.556 --> 00:34:05.926
and love of Christ.

00:34:05.926 --> 00:34:10.466
So first of all among yourselves.

00:34:10.466 --> 00:34:13.986
What is he going?

00:34:13.986 --> 00:34:16.756
Sit down!

00:34:16.756 --> 00:34:23.116
You must teach your children some manners.

00:34:23.116 --> 00:34:28.286
This girl who was drowned is because you neglected
the child.

00:34:28.286 --> 00:34:29.476
The father, where was he?

00:34:29.476 --> 00:34:30.476
I don’t know.

00:34:30.476 --> 00:34:36.616
I can’t understand how can a child be left
like that.

00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:46.606
It’s important to discipline your children.

00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:51.836
…if you have a neighbour, you’ve had it.

00:34:51.836 --> 00:34:58.817
He will try to find out where you go, what
you do.

00:34:58.817 --> 00:35:08.296
He will have a binocular to see and you make
any noise, you are finished but even if you

00:35:08.296 --> 00:35:12.176
sing, you are finished.

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:13.746
In that way, Indians are better.

00:35:13.746 --> 00:35:17.636
They don’t have that noise difficulty.

00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:19.076
We don’t have.

00:35:19.076 --> 00:35:20.416
Indians can live in the noise.

00:35:20.416 --> 00:35:25.916
I wanted to find out why Indians are so adjustable
to noise.

00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:28.806
They don’t mind noise.

00:35:28.806 --> 00:35:37.556
I found out the reason is that in the west
people are under stress and strain and that’s

00:35:37.556 --> 00:35:39.226
why they can’t bear.

00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:44.106
But in India, people don’t know what is
stress and strain is.

00:35:44.106 --> 00:35:49.638
Still that has not developed, I don’t know
how to that extent.

00:35:49.638 --> 00:35:51.726
That disease has not come.

00:35:51.726 --> 00:35:57.846
That might be the reason that they are so
much frightened of noises.

00:35:57.846 --> 00:36:00.276
People will come from villages here.

00:36:00.276 --> 00:36:04.876
They’ll sleep on the station, nothing happens.

00:36:04.876 --> 00:36:10.726
The trains are coming and going, nicely sleeping.

00:36:10.726 --> 00:36:18.056
Imagine in the west, thank God, in Italy we
have neighbours little far away, we had a

00:36:18.056 --> 00:36:19.056
little trouble.

00:36:19.056 --> 00:36:24.196
But in England, we had to go on changing our
ashram from one place to another, run away

00:36:24.196 --> 00:36:29.146
from here to there, because of great neighbours,
we had one of them had the name Mr Peace.

00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:34.796
I don’t know who gave him that name.

00:36:34.796 --> 00:36:38.026
Such contradictions in life.

00:36:38.026 --> 00:36:40.576
Such horrible contradictions.

00:36:40.576 --> 00:36:51.056
I don’t know how will they learn how to
love their neighbour.

00:36:51.056 --> 00:36:53.706
But Indians do.

00:36:53.706 --> 00:36:59.266
Somehow they don’t have this problem, not
much.

00:36:59.266 --> 00:37:01.086
Sometimes they have but not so much.

00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:11.036
But if there is a music supposing, all the
neighbours will join, bring tea, bring this,

00:37:11.036 --> 00:37:15.286
they’ll be enjoying the music.

00:37:15.286 --> 00:37:21.246
But there the collectivity is so little I
think, I can’t understand how can they call

00:37:21.246 --> 00:37:22.626
themselves Christians.

00:37:22.626 --> 00:37:33.826
Only they go to church, well dressed and our
Mayor told Me that for fifteen minutes hardly

00:37:33.826 --> 00:37:35.576
we can sit.

00:37:35.576 --> 00:37:38.736
We start looking at the watches.

00:37:38.736 --> 00:37:40.086
Fifteen minutes.

00:37:40.086 --> 00:37:48.806
And after half an hour, we all run out of
the jail and how is it these people are sitting

00:37:48.806 --> 00:37:50.706
with you for hours together.

00:37:50.706 --> 00:37:58.036
I said, I must be mesmerising them.

00:37:58.036 --> 00:38:03.846
I mean they are not so collective, unless
and until they drink, they cannot be collective.

00:38:03.846 --> 00:38:08.456
Unless and until they get intoxicated, they
cannot talk to each other.

00:38:08.456 --> 00:38:12.676
They are all the time tired.

00:38:12.676 --> 00:38:14.386
They are supposed to be Christians.

00:38:14.386 --> 00:38:23.386
They are so tired, you see them in the films
or anywhere, they come and sit down “hah!”.

00:38:23.386 --> 00:38:25.386
What has happened?

00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:27.376
Young people.

00:38:27.376 --> 00:38:32.186
All the time thinking, thinking, thinking,
which comes from Agya.

00:38:32.186 --> 00:38:41.716
Which comes from anti-Christ activity!

00:38:41.716 --> 00:38:43.806
Anti-Christ activity, thinking, thinking,
thinking.

00:38:43.806 --> 00:38:46.346
What should we do tomorrow?

00:38:46.346 --> 00:38:50.466
What is to be done and all that.

00:38:50.466 --> 00:39:04.346
Still we have to hope that this kind of religion
will finish.

00:39:04.346 --> 00:39:07.246
All such religions must finish.

00:39:07.246 --> 00:39:09.516
They have to go now, it’s too much.

00:39:09.516 --> 00:39:15.216
you cannot support them.

00:39:15.216 --> 00:39:23.096
They are so much full of anti-religious temperament
that you just can’t bear them.

00:39:23.096 --> 00:39:34.926
Better to finish Islam, Hinduism, Christianity,
Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, all isms one after

00:39:34.926 --> 00:39:38.726
another.

00:39:38.726 --> 00:39:41.906
To what religion did Christ belong?

00:39:41.906 --> 00:39:47.206
I don’t know.

00:39:47.206 --> 00:39:51.626
You belong to one religion which is Sahaj.

00:39:51.626 --> 00:39:56.286
Which is the universal religion, which is
the pure religion, which is born within you.

00:39:56.286 --> 00:40:05.426
You don’t belong to any other religion because
there is no religion in that.

00:40:05.426 --> 00:40:23.236
So by the time 2000 years, I hope all these
religions will run away from this earth.

00:40:23.236 --> 00:40:28.026
(applause).

00:40:28.026 --> 00:40:38.916
All of them fighting for nothing at all, killing
each other for nothing at all.

00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:43.506
They want, they want to fight, they like to
fight.

00:40:43.506 --> 00:40:50.466
Why blame Koran, why blame Bible, why blame
Christ, why blame anyone.

00:40:50.466 --> 00:40:51.776
They want to fight.

00:40:51.776 --> 00:40:55.176
They are of divisive nature.

00:40:55.176 --> 00:41:01.326
They want to have separate nations, separate
communities, separate this.

00:41:01.326 --> 00:41:07.096
Once you start separating you are antichrist.

00:41:07.096 --> 00:41:08.416
Absolutely.

00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:22.386
In Sahaja Yoga also I say that you are one
identity, you are not separate country, separate

00:41:22.386 --> 00:41:30.276
organisation, separate this, doesn’t exist
in my own idea.

00:41:30.276 --> 00:41:31.996
Doesn’t exist.

00:41:31.996 --> 00:41:37.126
I never thought of it.

00:41:37.126 --> 00:41:43.576
We are all children of one Father and of one
Mother.

00:41:43.576 --> 00:41:47.886
We have no business to think we are separate.

00:41:47.886 --> 00:41:51.796
Even now, I have seen groups are made very
easily.

00:41:51.796 --> 00:41:52.796
How?

00:41:52.796 --> 00:41:59.626
The groups are made.

00:41:59.626 --> 00:42:14.466
Like I find Maharashtrians

00:42:14.466 --> 00:42:23.076
are sitting together (Mother talks briefly
in Marathi.)

00:42:23.076 --> 00:42:30.776
Then we have group of the North Indians.

00:42:30.776 --> 00:42:37.366
Indians are quite separatist I tell you, somehow,
by temperament.

00:42:37.366 --> 00:42:43.746
North Indians also have separate separate
ideas.

00:42:43.746 --> 00:42:46.886
“You must come to Indore.”

00:42:46.886 --> 00:42:49.726
Why?

00:42:49.726 --> 00:42:51.606
Is it not a part of India?

00:42:51.606 --> 00:42:55.046
They can’t come to Delhi?

00:42:55.046 --> 00:43:00.046
“You must come to Kanpur, You must come
to Allahabad, you must come to Indore.”

00:43:00.046 --> 00:43:04.906
You must go to every village, every place.

00:43:04.906 --> 00:43:05.956
Why?

00:43:05.956 --> 00:43:19.436
You are born today in Delhi, tomorrow you
will be born in some horrid place, then, “This

00:43:19.436 --> 00:43:22.726
place is mine.

00:43:22.726 --> 00:43:24.986
This is my house..must come to my house.”

00:43:24.986 --> 00:43:26.346
That’s another headache.

00:43:26.346 --> 00:43:27.866
“You must come to my house.”

00:43:27.866 --> 00:43:32.526
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:46.356
Once you start that, you are finished, you
are no more belonging to Christ, no more.

00:43:46.356 --> 00:43:52.697
This is a very, very common programme – even
today that, if you see around yourself, must

00:43:52.697 --> 00:43:57.026
be people from your own country.

00:43:57.026 --> 00:44:04.506
Just see around yourself, are you sitting
with another people?

00:44:04.506 --> 00:44:06.046
Who is the other?

00:44:06.046 --> 00:44:10.616
In Sahaja Yoga, who is the other?

00:44:10.616 --> 00:44:24.616
We are all one and this unity we have to learn,
if you really love Me and Christ.

00:44:24.616 --> 00:44:31.746
All this groupism and all this has to end
now among Sahaja Yogis, must end.

00:44:31.746 --> 00:44:40.766
We are all one identity, we are all one living
body.

00:44:40.766 --> 00:44:43.936
We are all one living organism.

00:44:43.936 --> 00:44:48.106
We cannot say we are separate.

00:44:48.106 --> 00:44:57.556
Can this hand separate from the body, can
it exist?

00:44:57.556 --> 00:45:04.996
Once you start giving it up, you will be surprised,
you will have real enjoyment.

00:45:04.996 --> 00:45:16.166
But once you have all these ideas about my,
my, you can’t even enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:28.286
Cannot enjoy anybody else – “my wife,
my children, my house”, my this, my that.

00:45:28.286 --> 00:45:32.476
That awakening has to come within.

00:45:32.476 --> 00:45:36.516
“I don’t belong to this country.”

00:45:36.516 --> 00:45:42.716
Many girls you see and boys have written,
“We’ll have Indian marriage.”

00:45:42.716 --> 00:45:47.806
Only the age of the woman is 35 years.

00:45:47.806 --> 00:45:48.806
Only!

00:45:48.806 --> 00:45:57.566
Now where will I find a husband for her in
India, must be some widower or somebody.

00:45:57.566 --> 00:45:59.386
Must have an Indian marriage!

00:45:59.386 --> 00:46:03.896
Can you beat that?

00:46:03.896 --> 00:46:06.776
Such people, is impossible to marry them.

00:46:06.776 --> 00:46:12.236
I give you choice, all right have a choice.

00:46:12.236 --> 00:46:20.146
I also have a choice – I can’t marry you!

00:46:20.146 --> 00:46:22.746
That is My choice!

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:27.406
You have the freedom to say where you want
to marry – alright marry.

00:46:27.406 --> 00:46:33.116
But as far as I am concerned, I can’t marry
you like that.

00:46:33.116 --> 00:46:42.126
You have to marry wherever there is a good
match for you.

00:46:42.126 --> 00:46:48.486
Many Indian girls have married with Indians
boys, and have suffered a lot, such a lot,

00:46:48.486 --> 00:46:57.096
you won’t believe! (talks in Hindi briefly).

00:46:57.096 --> 00:46:59.906
Not in Sahaja Yoga any more!

00:46:59.906 --> 00:47:07.716
We have not been able to organise even one
marriage of a Hindustani with an Hindustani

00:47:07.716 --> 00:47:10.496
– not possible.

00:47:10.496 --> 00:47:15.156
That’s not the desire of the Divine.

00:47:15.156 --> 00:47:26.316
Why don’t you find in your own community
somewhere [the] same thing.

00:47:26.316 --> 00:47:28.716
As in India, is very particular.

00:47:28.716 --> 00:47:32.406
Very very particular.

00:47:32.406 --> 00:47:35.626
Like when my daughter was to be married, they
said “No!

00:47:35.626 --> 00:47:38.006
He his not a Shrivastava.

00:47:38.006 --> 00:47:43.096
If he is a Shrivastava also, he is not the
same Shrivastava.

00:47:43.096 --> 00:47:46.406
Even if he is the same Shrivastava, his this
thing is different!”

00:47:46.406 --> 00:47:47.406
I mean.

00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:49.006
I said, “Now this is going to finish”.

00:47:49.006 --> 00:47:55.266
Because I had all my elders living and they
were after me.

00:47:55.266 --> 00:48:01.236
I said “Whether he is a Shrivastava or not
Shrivastava I am going to marry them, finished!”

00:48:01.236 --> 00:48:03.956
My husband agreed.

00:48:03.956 --> 00:48:09.016
Same with my grandchildren.

00:48:09.016 --> 00:48:12.076
If you get Shrivastava, well and good, otherwise
forget it.

00:48:12.076 --> 00:48:14.666
Maharashtrians also same.

00:48:14.666 --> 00:48:23.736
Maharashtrians who have become Christians
[are] also the same, you be amazed, Christians!

00:48:23.736 --> 00:48:31.186
Now they are saying we are Dalit Christians,
means who were converted from the lower caste

00:48:31.186 --> 00:48:32.426
into Christianity.

00:48:32.426 --> 00:48:33.426
Now there is a new caste that’s come.

00:48:33.426 --> 00:48:38.646
Once you have become Christian, what is your
caste?

00:48:38.646 --> 00:48:42.226
You are Christian, not that.

00:48:42.226 --> 00:48:44.456
They are Dalits and they are higher Christians.

00:48:44.456 --> 00:48:52.486
They will not marry in the Dalit and Dalit
won’t marry in the higher.

00:48:52.486 --> 00:49:02.616
Supposed to be Christians, following Christ,
going to church regularly, well dressed.

00:49:02.616 --> 00:49:04.936
Even if they do not have a proper suit.

00:49:04.936 --> 00:49:10.436
They must wear like English some suit, borrow
it, and go to church because according to

00:49:10.436 --> 00:49:14.846
Indian Christians, Christ was born in England.

00:49:14.846 --> 00:49:20.506
(laughter) Really, you won’t believe.

00:49:20.506 --> 00:49:24.686
Unless and until you wear a suit and a tie,
you can’t go to the Church.

00:49:24.686 --> 00:49:36.896
Can you imagine, anybody, going with a dhoti
to church? (more laughter) Impossible situation.

00:49:36.896 --> 00:49:45.246
Even in my time, thank God I didn’t marry
a Christian, but my own sisters and all were

00:49:45.246 --> 00:49:49.956
forced to wear veils and not the saris, wear
the frocks and the veils.

00:49:49.956 --> 00:49:54.796
Can you imagine the wedding dress.

00:49:54.796 --> 00:49:58.376
We, Indian women, can’t do without the saris.

00:49:58.376 --> 00:50:00.536
But they were forced.

00:50:00.536 --> 00:50:04.306
So many women married the way English marry.

00:50:04.306 --> 00:50:11.646
And I was amazed even the Japanese who are
Christians come to Australia and dress up

00:50:11.646 --> 00:50:22.186
like these English brides and get married
– because they are Christians.

00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:27.776
That shows that they believe that Christ was
born in England or what?

00:50:27.776 --> 00:50:38.166
Actually, for Christians it’s not necessary
to worry about any dress.

00:50:38.166 --> 00:50:44.636
All this nonsense comes from the West that
you must dress up like this, you must have

00:50:44.636 --> 00:50:46.976
your spoon here, fork here.

00:50:46.976 --> 00:50:55.296
Did Christ eat with fork and spoon?

00:50:55.296 --> 00:50:59.176
He was born in the manger.

00:50:59.176 --> 00:51:04.916
It’s impossible to understand these people
are Christians.

00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:09.536
So much worried about the spoons and forks
and they came to your house for dinner, they

00:51:09.536 --> 00:51:14.726
lift the plate to see from what company you
have bought it.

00:51:14.726 --> 00:51:16.636
[That’s] very important!

00:51:16.636 --> 00:51:18.556
Such silly people!

00:51:18.556 --> 00:51:23.326
I tell you they call themselves Christians.

00:51:23.326 --> 00:51:31.436
Christ was born in the manger and [they are]
so particular about nonsensical things.

00:51:31.436 --> 00:51:41.796
You see one must understand the greatness
of His birth, in which he has shown that he

00:51:41.796 --> 00:51:46.876
was born with the cows tied there and the
calves were there.

00:51:46.876 --> 00:51:55.366
He was born in the manger.

00:51:55.366 --> 00:52:01.996
Not only the Christians abroad but they are
also in India the same – you can make out

00:52:01.996 --> 00:52:03.536
a Christian in no time.

00:52:03.536 --> 00:52:11.636
See them on a Sunday morning.

00:52:11.636 --> 00:52:20.816
That way my father opposed it – he used
to wear kurta, because Christ wore kurta.

00:52:20.816 --> 00:52:26.896
He didn’t wear suit, did he?

00:52:26.896 --> 00:52:28.916
And so superficial they are.

00:52:28.916 --> 00:52:31.506
Nothing to learn from them.

00:52:31.506 --> 00:52:40.526
They will put here on top [a label written]
“Saville Row”, On top of the suit!!

00:52:40.526 --> 00:52:48.996
Such stupid people, I tell you, and the Indians
are following them left and right, I can’t

00:52:48.996 --> 00:52:50.216
understand.

00:52:50.216 --> 00:52:51.256
They are anti-Christ.

00:52:51.256 --> 00:52:56.096
Don’t follow them on these points.

00:52:56.096 --> 00:53:03.236
Indians have at least certain sense of dignity.

00:53:03.236 --> 00:53:13.176
If you have any, why should you wear a suit
on a May day here?

00:53:13.176 --> 00:53:14.646
In this heat?

00:53:14.646 --> 00:53:17.466
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:17.466 --> 00:53:22.126
We have to wear a common dress of a common
man.

00:53:22.126 --> 00:53:29.816
Whom are we going to impress except for this
Paramchaitanya?

00:53:29.816 --> 00:53:42.426
They are extremely superficial extremely meticulously
particular about their dress, how they live

00:53:42.426 --> 00:53:46.026
and it’s really horrible.

00:53:46.026 --> 00:53:54.156
I have seen this and that is the reason I
think I should warn you.

00:53:54.156 --> 00:54:01.026
Don’t take to that culture, that is anti-Christ
culture.

00:54:01.026 --> 00:54:09.496
Absolutely anti-Christ in every way.

00:54:09.496 --> 00:54:17.166
In every way they have insulted Christ out
and out.

00:54:17.166 --> 00:54:22.196
You people should not anymore insult Christ.

00:54:22.196 --> 00:54:24.186
In a simple way you live.

00:54:24.186 --> 00:54:32.686
I mean now this sari, they forced me to wear
is like a big bag for Me but what to do.

00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:35.416
Yesterday also they forced Me, today also
they forced me.

00:54:35.416 --> 00:54:40.036
I am supposed to wear all this because I am
Adi Shakti, supposed to be.

00:54:40.036 --> 00:54:50.116
If I was Christ, I would have been better
off.

00:54:50.116 --> 00:54:53.016
He was much more free than Me!

00:54:53.016 --> 00:55:01.516
Now, with all this what we have to know, what
is the message?

00:55:01.516 --> 00:55:08.866
What is the message of Christ?

00:55:08.866 --> 00:55:17.286
That you develop your spirituality, your divinity
by which you know what is the dignity of a

00:55:17.286 --> 00:55:18.646
Sahaja Yogi is.

00:55:18.646 --> 00:55:25.546
He was your eldest brother I should say.

00:55:25.546 --> 00:55:29.356
His lifestyle you should follow.

00:55:29.356 --> 00:55:35.306
Absolutely not afraid of anything, not worried
about any job, nothing, not worried about

00:55:35.306 --> 00:55:43.996
any business anything, absolutely free from
all worries.

00:55:43.996 --> 00:55:52.136
So many examples we have, beautiful examples
of his life, but when we see Christians, we

00:55:52.136 --> 00:56:04.976
try to reflect it as an expression of the
life of Christ and that is where we make mistake.

00:56:04.976 --> 00:56:16.866
They are, by no means they are for Christ,
they are, by no means, following Christ.

00:56:16.866 --> 00:56:22.376
So as Sahaja Yogis, we have a different culture.

00:56:22.376 --> 00:56:25.266
We have a culture where we respect morality.

00:56:25.266 --> 00:56:29.666
We have dignity, we have our own personality.

00:56:29.666 --> 00:56:39.166
We are fearless, we don’t tell lies, we
don’t cheat and we can never get mesmerised.

00:56:39.166 --> 00:56:52.916
So we have to have, now we can call it “the
Mother’s culture”, and which is not in

00:56:52.916 --> 00:56:59.956
any way showing off, or in any way taking
to artificial things.

00:56:59.956 --> 00:57:07.227
The whole thing will change, the whole concept
will change, whole idea will change, once

00:57:07.227 --> 00:57:18.606
you understand that you are now in “the
Mother’s culture”.

00:57:18.606 --> 00:57:20.676
Now they have forced me, so I am wearing all
right.

00:57:20.676 --> 00:57:24.436
You want me to wear, alright I’ll wear.

00:57:24.436 --> 00:57:32.516
But normally if you leave it to Me what do
I wear, you know that.

00:57:32.516 --> 00:57:36.336
Secret is out already!

00:57:36.336 --> 00:57:41.606
If you want to give me presents, give me,
I never asked you for presents, nothing!

00:57:41.606 --> 00:57:43.466
Forcing the presents on my head!

00:57:43.466 --> 00:57:46.596
Alright, for your joy’s sake you have it.

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:48.266
What to do?

00:57:48.266 --> 00:57:51.966
But one thing I must request these Maharashtrians.

00:57:51.966 --> 00:58:00.866
They are not going to give me anymore, anymore,
again anymore what they call is the oti part.

00:58:00.866 --> 00:58:04.776
My oti is overfull.

00:58:04.776 --> 00:58:09.606
Absolutely, nobody has to give me oti.

00:58:09.606 --> 00:58:15.526
If somebody gets married, if somebody has
a child, somebody has anything, they’ll

00:58:15.526 --> 00:58:17.636
bring the oti.

00:58:17.636 --> 00:58:23.066
There is no need to give me any oti, you can
go to the temple, you give your oti there

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:30.896
it is resold and resold and resold in between
the sellers who are Gujaratis, the brahmins

00:58:30.896 --> 00:58:36.856
who are the pujaris make money.

00:58:36.856 --> 00:58:44.256
So no more oti, nobody is going to give Me
any oti whatsoever.

00:58:44.256 --> 00:58:56.416
On a Christmas day I have to say one thing
– what did we give to Christ.

00:58:56.416 --> 00:59:03.006
And the second question what are we going
to give to Mother.

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:05.246
This is very important.

00:59:05.246 --> 00:59:13.206
I don’t want anything from you, nothing.

00:59:13.206 --> 00:59:16.966
I am fully content with Myself.

00:59:16.966 --> 00:59:24.686
What I want is that you must dedicate yourself
to Sahaja Yoga, to truth and to love.

00:59:24.686 --> 00:59:40.516
I will be very happy and also not to talk
like, what you call, Christ has called them,

00:59:40.516 --> 00:59:45.236
“murmuring souls” – talking here there,
one saying there.

00:59:45.236 --> 00:59:48.486
All this.I don’t like at all.

00:59:48.486 --> 00:59:50.086
I don’t like it and it should not be done.

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:54.166
If you do like this, you will fall, fall very
badly.

00:59:54.166 --> 00:59:56.006
This is the last judgement.

00:59:56.006 --> 01:00:00.946
Either you‘ll go to heaven or you‘ll go
to hell.

01:00:00.946 --> 01:00:03.776
It’s already working out like that.

01:00:03.776 --> 01:00:06.556
So let’s see.

01:00:06.556 --> 01:00:09.336
Where are you?

01:00:09.336 --> 01:00:15.186
So I have to again and again tell you as your
mother, I have to correct you and tell you

01:00:15.186 --> 01:00:26.896
that remember this is the last judgement and
please, do not take anymore to the activities

01:00:26.896 --> 01:00:30.656
which are anti-Christ.

01:00:30.656 --> 01:00:37.326
You can judge within yourself – [whether]
whatever you are doing is not good, and for

01:00:37.326 --> 01:00:40.856
that, best thing is to dedicate yourself to
Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:40.856 --> 01:00:44.916
But not to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:48.256
Not to make politics out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:48.256 --> 01:00:57.366
But make Sahaja Yoga like a big, huge, big
tree and it will work out.

01:00:57.366 --> 01:01:00.076
I know it will work out.

01:01:00.076 --> 01:01:01.336
You have the potential.

01:01:01.336 --> 01:01:02.926
That’s why you are here.

01:01:05.206 --> 01:01:08.736
May God bless you all
