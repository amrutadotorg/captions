00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:45.720
[Music]

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.199
you know no no - the child they normally

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.440
would be replaced the prophetess turn us

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.350
into karate demand rain medicine demo

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.170
pseudo poverty spattering they were

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.610
simply genetically mediated the ProQuest

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.880
was in Jerusalem and she I'm so happy

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.509
that in Italy people have so much

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.300
respect for my dear mother and also for

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:23.810
Madonna surprising why they did not

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.280
describe about Christ's mother in the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.340
Bible the last words spoken of Christ

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.649
where he say behold the mother in all

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.569
other scriptures of the world this

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.399
primordial mother is respect and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.840
everybody has talked about that that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.840
she's the power she's the ship

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.810
[Music]

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.669
[Applause]

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:33.110
I think it's it's a little fragile it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:03:00.780
was it was repaid by misogyny and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:03:03.780
repainted it is said that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.830
in the ten commandments whatever is

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:12.270
created by the heavens and by the earth

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:17.220
should not be recreated and reproduced

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:22.050
and worshipped so the incarnations are

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.270
created by the heavens only in modern

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:29.340
times it is possible to take a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:34.459
photograph of the incarnation but in the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:38.060
former days there was no possibility now

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:42.290
whatever is created by the mother earth

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:46.560
is what has come out of the mother earth

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.530
which is the swayambhu is created by the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.150
mother earth now we have everywhere we

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.890
find the same blue things

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.720
another thing is some realized Souls

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:07.470
also have made beautiful statue

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:10.560
there was one fellow in Russia supposed

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.540
to be very intelligent he said that all

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.620
right if we keep mother's photograph and

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.209
also the icons we can get the same type

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.500
of vibration you cannot because icons

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:28.710
are made by some artists imaginary these

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.900
are not representing actually even Maria

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.400
or Christ or anyone they are all all

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.560
imaginary if an Italian once makes

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:44.640
Christ he is Italian stuff he somebody

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:49.500
French one makes is thin like French if

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.580
you get somebody say from Holland he'll

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.580
have a forehead like that

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:00.690
you see all of them

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.539
they depict Christ as they want to then

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.470
we have Maria the same way

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:10.710
her expression her photograph everything

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.860
is all according to the imagination of

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.720
the artists and to whatever country we

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.419
belong that way and they are not free

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.770
you can see they are not free because

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:29.400
all these artists have a certain style

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:33.750
now if it is a Rembrandt it's a style if

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.729
it is a Leonardo it's a style though

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.250
they are born realized still they have a

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.870
style nobody is like this that he make

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.080
today like these tomorrow like this

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.090
there's no freedom

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.090
they are bound by their own styles

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.810
everybody has one style and that is the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.349
style they follow because what is that

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.530
his reason is they must have done three

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:06.210
four times style type styles must have

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:10.020
done sure but people must have rejected

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.780
this is no good this is no good so it's

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.400
all to see opinion of the people so they

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.610
must have taken to one style all right

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.590
this is the stand so you can see Christ

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.699
if he's Japanese

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.699
he'll have [ __ ] eyes

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:34.180
if he is Chinese she'll have no nose if

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:38.949
it's Indian he'll be doubt so all kinds

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:44.379
of crisis II and I feel that how can

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:47.800
they emit vibrations tell me while with

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:50.740
my photograph our cunning company now

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.990
when we say that we should not worship

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.330
in the Bible it is written that we

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.479
should not worship anything that is

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.879
reproduced and created by the mother

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.129
earth and the heavens now what is it

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.560
what is it created by the mother earth

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:08.080
and by the heaven which we should not

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.150
reproduce this nobody tried to find out

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.599
they think that you are not allowed to

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:16.990
worship any form it's all

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:20.139
misinterpretation it's completely

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:24.879
misinterpretation I'll tell you very in

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:29.050
Paris a church called what is it called

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:33.099
them or not reserved and the under

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:35.199
statue of Mary and Christ is celebrating

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:37.419
from outside you can see the vibrations

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:40.659
are coming out now this must have been

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:41.409
made by some very great artist who was a

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:46.210
realized soul

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:51.789
for example the Sistine Chapel ego has

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:53.860
got a very beautiful frescoes of Christ

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:58.930
and all that and if you see that Christ

00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:02.020
I mean it's absolutely vibrate but down

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:06.639
below there's a big table on which to

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:10.000
have put Christ just very miserable

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:11.590
creature which is never near Christ I

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.469
mean it's impossible that Christ would

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:18.250
be like that so miserable ugly looking

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:20.469
thin burnout hopelessness

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:25.180
how can he be Christ I can't understand

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:26.830
he carried a complete huge big cross

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.169
upon himself do you think these bowls

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:32.079
could have can and this was placed just

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:35.800
below where Sistine Chapel you find the

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:38.390
Christ and energy boy how can it be

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:42.620
also the mother of Christ is always

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:46.190
shown as a fat person modern fashion

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:51.790
that should become like a mosquito you

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:56.720
will go is a famous painting Mona Lisa

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:59.590
he was a very fat is all the trace of

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.580
the intervenors you are playing into

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:07.820
they are making a fool out of everyone

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:13.580
the divine personality needs water to

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:16.250
protect the center I'll do an example of

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:19.010
Mona Lisa if you see Mona Lisa I mean I

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:21.860
don't know she cannot be an actress she

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:26.270
cannot win any beauty contests I think

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:31.130
she her face is very serene very

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:33.110
motherly very pure her eyes and why is

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.720
it that she's eternally so much

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.160
appreciated the reason is there is

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.010
Ganesh impersonator

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.070
she's a mother and the story about that

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:45.620
one is that this lady had lost her child

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.990
and she would never spoil she would

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.450
never cry and one little child was

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:53.600
brought to her when she saw the child

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:56.030
then the spine that came on her face of

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.910
that love for the child is being

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:01.190
depicted by this great artist and that's

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.630
why people are appreciating it and you

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:06.080
have seen in the West though the people

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:09.590
don't show much interest in the mother

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.950
child relationships anywhere you go is

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.090
the mother and child theme is the best

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:16.130
they'd show you photograph this is

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.290
mother and child this is Christ mother

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.240
and child when the Christ was brought

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.530
down the mother is there they have to

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.500
have mother and her child

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:27.350
principal acting otherwise that picture

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.720
is not regarded as something great or

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:34.540
you have to have actually Christ who is

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.540
a Ganesh principal himself to be sure

00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:47.160
he wants to know about the appearance of

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:50.399
Holy Mary for example in Fatima on other

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:53.790
addresses mitre is quite possible you

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:56.730
see one of my photographs where people

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:59.910
are taking photographs and she's there

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:05.790
she's appeared before me also it's

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:10.559
possible I went to Portugal and they had

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:17.129
a festival of the Lady of the rocks so I

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:21.120
went to see that place and there was a

00:11:17.129 --> 00:11:25.199
very small little statue of this diamond

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:29.420
height of the middle about say five

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:34.740
inches and the face was just like mine

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:38.850
exactly like mine they said that this

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:42.809
was found suddenly by two children who

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:47.639
were following a rabbit which hid inside

00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:49.769
a niche so these children saw some light

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:54.480
inside the niche and they started

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:56.490
following under a rock and they reached

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.180
the source of the light was the statue

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:02.430
they brought it out and in that light

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.680
they walked and when the people outside

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.120
where lots of people were gathered they

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.059
were amazed to see that they brought out

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:13.250
the statue from somewhere inside so they

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:17.250
worshiped that that statue in that place

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:22.529
now please think these statues give you

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:27.870
vibrations as I give you vibrations but

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:30.839
not so much as I give it and all the

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:35.250
other statues also there may be many who

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:38.670
might be giving you vibrations and also

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:41.670
there was an operation of her first I

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:44.999
never believed that it could be but then

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:49.110
after feeling the vibrations now I know

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:52.740
it was true that she did appear here in

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.939
an operation she appeared before me also

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:58.259
you must have seen

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:59.849
in a photograph of course I like

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:03.659
paintings very much up for a file

00:12:59.849 --> 00:13:06.149
specially because he has drawn the

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:09.959
mother's face and the child's face so

00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:15.059
exactly expressing the feeling of mother

00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:18.659
entity and imagine that picture appears

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:20.729
in the sky and I didn't tell them to

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:24.359
show that the father when I was sleeping

00:13:20.729 --> 00:13:27.539
I was not even going to look at it but

00:13:24.359 --> 00:13:31.339
at this time the hollow that was on the

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:34.079
backside of Bailey comes up on the head

00:13:31.339 --> 00:13:36.439
in Suffern himself innate or I don't

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:39.329
know how can I explain this

00:13:36.439 --> 00:13:44.159
paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of

00:13:39.329 --> 00:13:49.769
things and it does all these just to

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:52.999
convince you about sahaja yoga we have

00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:57.779
seen photographs of angels around me so

00:13:52.999 --> 00:14:03.149
try to be simple innocent not reacting

00:13:57.779 --> 00:14:05.989
and keep quiet and peaceful because here
