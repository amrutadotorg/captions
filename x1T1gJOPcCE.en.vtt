00:09:21.907 --> 00:09:29.517
I hope your journey has been comfortable so
far and will be comfortable later on, as the

00:09:29.517 --> 00:09:32.037
source of comfort is your Spirit.

00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:39.297
And more you see to the comfort of your Spirit
the problems of outside comforts drop off.

00:09:39.297 --> 00:09:45.547
You are not bothered as to where you live,
where you sleep, what you eat, what you do.

00:09:45.547 --> 00:09:54.166
So allow these gross sensitivities to drop
down so that the inner, subtler sensitivities

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:55.166
grow.

00:09:55.166 --> 00:10:02.286
That’s why you are here, to get over your
time, conditionings…l mean it is a rat-race,

00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:09.607
and the rat race has to be somehow or other
stopped, once and for all, “without”.

00:10:09.607 --> 00:10:14.876
So here we can do it “without”, and once
you start meditating, that “within” can

00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:24.447
also be achieved and you can achieve that
peace which all human beings should have,

00:10:24.447 --> 00:10:28.117
if we have to save this world from complete
destruction.

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:36.357
As you must have realized that now the Sahaja
Yoga is growing much faster, and is taking

00:10:36.357 --> 00:10:38.287
a good speed.

00:10:38.287 --> 00:10:47.987
And we all have to keep ourselves equipped
to be able to be part and parcel of this great

00:10:47.987 --> 00:10:54.007
evolutionary and revolutionary process which
is going to stir up the whole world.

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:59.877
For that, it is important also to see that
we take ourselves to task and don’t get

00:10:59.877 --> 00:11:02.947
into mediocre living and mediocre thinking.

00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:08.767
We are people of very great potential.

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:13.596
Not only that, but we are blessed by God’s
Divine Power.

00:11:13.596 --> 00:11:19.507
Try to use that power within yourself and
try to be one with it.

00:11:19.507 --> 00:11:26.497
A little bit, you have to see that you beat
up your body, beat up your mind, beat up your

00:11:26.497 --> 00:11:34.196
ego, and chisel it out so that it is beautifully
made, in such a way that you grow into that

00:11:34.196 --> 00:11:38.587
image for which you are made.

00:11:38.587 --> 00:11:50.627
Regarding other things, like my tours in your
countries; I think, the greatest good is done

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:57.386
to you when you come to ‘this’ country;
as if you belong to this country and you were

00:11:57.386 --> 00:11:59.717
uprooted in some other country.

00:11:59.717 --> 00:12:05.987
And, when you come here you prosper so well
! And in that country I try so hard, I work

00:12:05.987 --> 00:12:11.167
so hard, do all kinds of things, all the time
I spend with you, I do everything, day and

00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:23.538
night, all the time—I find it’s impossible
to achieve much, that I see happening to you

00:12:23.538 --> 00:12:24.538
here.

00:12:24.538 --> 00:12:33.157
As if here you take absolutely with great
ease the divinity of this place.

00:12:33.157 --> 00:12:37.196
And I think this uprootedness has to be given
up.

00:12:37.196 --> 00:12:44.457
I think as if you had immigrated into those
countries and now you are back in your own!

00:12:44.457 --> 00:12:48.506
You are not found out by immigration laws,
I think !

00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:56.007
Now, under these circumstances we should change
our tactics and start to establish our ashrams

00:12:56.007 --> 00:13:05.707
here, and our own projects here, so that you
people should come down ‘here’ and achieve

00:13:05.707 --> 00:13:06.717
more.

00:13:06.717 --> 00:13:08.277
You can earn your living there.

00:13:08.277 --> 00:13:13.756
But you should come here and spend some lime
for two or three months ‘continuously’

00:13:13.756 --> 00:13:15.897
and establish yourself and grow.

00:13:15.897 --> 00:13:19.287
Because I don’t think it can be achieved
there that good.

00:13:19.287 --> 00:13:21.437
Because we’ve tried everything.

00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:26.187
So this is the ultimate outcome of our trips
all over.

00:13:26.187 --> 00:13:35.887
Despite all kinds of hazardous routes and
hazardous life here, we are doing very well.

00:13:35.887 --> 00:13:43.647
I must say when I see you I find you are all
very good and you are very much better and

00:13:43.647 --> 00:13:44.967
it’s all improved.

00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:51.457
‘Like watches, you see, when you have to
make them immuned, you put them under absurd

00:13:51.457 --> 00:13:53.267
conditions and they get alright.

00:13:53.267 --> 00:14:02.237
Like that, now you are immuned ! They are
put into troughs which are shaken very thoroughly

00:14:02.237 --> 00:14:06.947
as yesterday you were shaken in the buses.

00:14:06.947 --> 00:14:11.367
Then they are made to pass through water which
is running very fast on them.

00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:16.787
And all this we are trying here; and I think
your immunity is growing very fast to outward

00:14:16.787 --> 00:14:24.937
things, and you are becoming really solid
eternal time pieces, the way you are created

00:14:24.937 --> 00:14:27.197
here, and I’m so very happy to see the development.

00:14:27.197 --> 00:14:31.157
-That’s the main point which we have achieved
here.

00:14:31.157 --> 00:14:32.347
So the attention should be.

00:14:32.347 --> 00:14:34.597
out-away from money; first of all.

00:14:34.597 --> 00:14:36.297
That is one of the biggest problems.

00:14:36.297 --> 00:14:40.717
Actually nobody can believe that affluent
countries are much more money-minded than

00:14:40.717 --> 00:14:42.837
Indians are, ‘though they are so developed.

00:14:42.837 --> 00:14:47.477
You see, the developed countries are ‘much
more’ money minded, than the Indians are-its

00:14:47.477 --> 00:14:48.617
very surprising!

00:14:48.617 --> 00:14:52.687
When you see the way they count their pennies
it is impossible to believe that these are

00:14:52.687 --> 00:14:53.687
really developed people.

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:55.807
They are worse than beggars sometimes.

00:14:55.807 --> 00:15:00.117
So that is what you should get out of-the
money part.

00:15:00.117 --> 00:15:03.557
Money is horrible stuff that people count.

00:15:03.557 --> 00:15:09.477
I mean-it is better to count the names of
God than count the money-horrible coins .

00:15:09.477 --> 00:15:14.337
Then we have other things like gross attachment
to comfort.

00:15:14.337 --> 00:15:17.617
I don’t think it’s a very comfortable
life there.

00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:20.157
Because here you can move in the night, anytime.

00:15:20.157 --> 00:15:24.337
You won’t meet anybody who will snatch your
purse or snatch your bangles.

00:15:24.337 --> 00:15:27.837
You can move about the way you like and nobody’s
going to bother.

00:15:27.837 --> 00:15:32.737
You won’t meet 2 or 3 drunkards beating
each other-nothing of the kind.

00:15:32.737 --> 00:15:33.737
So it’s a very pure life here.

00:15:33.737 --> 00:15:37.537
That’s a very big achievement.

00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:43.117
And the comforts that you want you can create
later on, if you want to have them.

00:15:43.117 --> 00:15:47.647
At least I personally think that too much
modernisation won’t suit this place.

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:53.387
So you should not give them these useless
ideas which makes your body slaves to your

00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:58.577
own comforts and ideas of enslavement.

00:15:58.577 --> 00:16:05.677
In any case personal cleanliness is very good
here, but the general cleanliness has to be

00:16:05.677 --> 00:16:07.357
taught to these people.

00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:13.327
All this giving and taking process will work
out very well, I’m sure.

00:16:13.327 --> 00:16:21.798
And the way things are moving within yourself,
I have great hopes that you will really grow

00:16:21.798 --> 00:16:29.767
much faster if you come to this country and
stay here for some time, in a settled way,

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:32.177
and then go back to your countries.

00:16:32.177 --> 00:16:40.527
That would be much better than to have a visit
to your countries, which I feel sometimes

00:16:40.527 --> 00:16:46.037
is just bombarded by negativity.

00:16:46.037 --> 00:16:54.726
The other point which I wanted to tell you
is that you must learn to understand that

00:16:54.726 --> 00:16:57.397
you have come here to gain something.

00:16:57.397 --> 00:17:00.427
Nobody is going to gain anything out of you.

00:17:00.427 --> 00:17:02.047
So you have to gain something here.

00:17:02.047 --> 00:17:11.577
You are students and so you have to learn
something, and try to develop a sense of discipline.

00:17:11.577 --> 00:17:16.057
Like a disciple who receives all that is around-“What’s
that?

00:17:16.057 --> 00:17:17.157
How is it?

00:17:17.157 --> 00:17:20.177
This is the house, that’s nice”, you see,
like that.

00:17:20.177 --> 00:17:26.777
But if you go on seeing the thing which is
of no importance and loose talking about things

00:17:26.777 --> 00:17:28.607
that do not matter with you.

00:17:28.607 --> 00:17:30.317
All these have to be given up.

00:17:30.317 --> 00:17:37.236
Because you have so much time there that people
sit down and jabber; talk, loose talks, ugly

00:17:37.236 --> 00:17:38.907
talks, useless talks.

00:17:38.907 --> 00:17:41.226
That’s not needed at all.

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:47.607
On the contrary it’s better to be quiet,
and assimilate more within yourself.

00:17:47.607 --> 00:17:52.007
Because here the people don’t have time,
so they can’t talk, they have to work.

00:17:52.007 --> 00:17:56.917
But while you have lime thereto talk, also
here, so we start like that; and that’s

00:17:56.917 --> 00:17:58.397
a ‘very’ wrong thing.

00:17:58.397 --> 00:18:02.917
Another talking is done with yourself also,
quite a lot.

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:08.987
like you start analysing, criticising and
finding faults and all the time thinking “Oh,

00:18:08.987 --> 00:18:13.647
this could have been better-I’ve harmed
very much here…that has happened”, all

00:18:13.647 --> 00:18:16.047
those things come into your heads.

00:18:16.047 --> 00:18:22.157
So this kind of a inner talk also should be
stopped; they are called as “murmuring souls”

00:18:22.157 --> 00:18:25.337
by Christ, who said “Beware of murmuring
souls”.

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:28.297
But these murmuring souls exist within us.

00:18:28.297 --> 00:18:33.787
So beware of them and don’t listen to all
nonsensical talks, and try to keep a good

00:18:33.787 --> 00:18:40.287
eye on that and be alert, so it will help
you.

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:46.437
On the whole, I must say that this trip and
the last trip, I am overjoyed and I am ,very’

00:18:46.437 --> 00:18:54.577
happy that it has brought forth ‘so many’
possibilities before me and your potential.

00:18:54.577 --> 00:19:04.257
I am very happy about it, that somehow, in
this year, we have achieved a new type of

00:19:04.257 --> 00:19:14.317
atmosphere among all of you, which is humble,
which is quiet, which is peaceful, which is

00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:23.827
absorbing the Divine, which is a very, very
great, joyous thing for me.

00:19:23.827 --> 00:19:25.957
So I thank you very much for all that.

00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:30.317
I hope you keep up your progress this way.
