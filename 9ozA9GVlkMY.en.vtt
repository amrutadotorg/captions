36:00.148 --> 36:16.128
The organizers and the members of the Medical
Association in Sholapur, its such a pleasure

36:21.676 --> 36:27.403
to talk to (* inaudible text) because you
have also heard that I did some medicine.

36:27.428 --> 36:30.311
Just to talk to doctors about it.

36:30.613 --> 36:39.302
Because in the realm of the divine, there
are no names given to any plexuses.

36:39.961 --> 36:46.251
It’s difficult to talk to doctors unless
and until you know their language.

36:46.251 --> 36:59.350
Now the main thing we have to understand about
Sahaja yogi is this that when we are trying

36:59.350 --> 37:09.061
to analyze or find out through scientific
methods anything, we can only do it when that

37:09.061 --> 37:16.371
part is available to us, apparent to us, that
we can see it, we can feel it, we can analyze

37:16.371 --> 37:17.371
it.

37:17.371 --> 37:21.501
Like a tree, we see the tree on top of the
Mother Earth.

37:21.501 --> 37:25.181
For us it is easy to see the tree.

37:25.181 --> 37:32.100
But supposing we have to go deep down into
the roots.

37:32.100 --> 37:36.181
So Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of the roots
and not of the tree.

37:36.181 --> 37:41.240
Of Course, the tree is very important because
root has no meaning if there is no tree.

37:41.240 --> 37:50.861
But tree is more important when it can tell
you that there are roots to it.

37:50.861 --> 37:57.761
So all our knowledge of science whatever it
is, whatever discoveries we have made, how

37:57.761 --> 37:58.761
far we have gone?

37:58.761 --> 38:01.451
I mean we can go very deep into it, I know
that.

38:01.451 --> 38:04.721
But still, you can not reach the absolute.

38:04.721 --> 38:10.851
Because “absolute” is that point where
you have to dissolve.

38:10.851 --> 38:18.311
We have one scholar here, who is doing his
P.H.D from Brighton and he has a subject how

38:18.311 --> 38:22.821
to establish an absolute zero point in temperature.

38:22.821 --> 38:24.571
You can not.

38:24.571 --> 38:25.821
Nobody can.

38:25.821 --> 38:27.701
Its a fact.

38:27.701 --> 38:32.491
You can go up to a point but you can not become
the absolute.

38:32.491 --> 38:38.021
Through your mental projection because the
mind is a limited thing.

38:38.021 --> 38:39.550
We must understand the mind is limited.

38:39.550 --> 38:44.311
Like I came by car, I had to leave my car
behind to come inside.

38:44.311 --> 38:49.871
In the same way this limited mind can not
take you to something that is unlimited.

38:49.871 --> 38:52.190
Because absolute has to be unlimited.

38:52.190 --> 38:57.121
So to reach the absolute point what should
be done.

38:57.121 --> 39:00.621
That’s the main problem with all of us.

39:00.621 --> 39:07.220
All those who are seekers, whether they are
scientists or psychologists or anyway.

39:07.220 --> 39:11.610
They have one point if they see correctly
that we have not reached the absolute.

39:11.610 --> 39:18.421
That is why we do not understand “why are
we made human beings from amoeba state?”

39:18.421 --> 39:22.651
We should ask ourselves a simple question,”why
are we human beings?

39:22.651 --> 39:28.741
What was the purpose of this evolution that
we were made human beings?

39:28.741 --> 39:34.580
So, as we can’t answer this question it
is not answerable.

39:34.580 --> 39:42.750
We have to know that we are in a transition
state and this human awareness has to achieve

39:42.750 --> 39:50.000
another awareness which is dynamic, which
is collective in nature and many people I

39:50.000 --> 39:54.181
would say like you, who has talked of collectivity.

39:54.181 --> 40:04.791
Who has talked of collective awareness that
a man, if he evolves, will become a collectively

40:04.791 --> 40:05.791
conscious.

40:05.791 --> 40:09.731
He could see that but he did not know how.

40:09.731 --> 40:14.641
Even if you have to say that if you have to
go to Sholapur you better take this road or

40:14.641 --> 40:20.441
that road but if you can not reach Sholapur
then you are not there in Sholapur.

40:20.441 --> 40:26.411
So even if you say this is the way it has
to be, unless and until somebody does it in

40:26.411 --> 40:31.120
a practical way, in actualization you have
to achieve it.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.300
This is the problem.

40:32.300 --> 40:37.951
Actual this is the problem, that exist between
all the people who are seeking, between all

40:37.951 --> 40:43.201
the enterprises, between all the moment we
have.

40:43.201 --> 40:47.111
There is no quarrel between God and Science.

40:47.111 --> 40:51.651
One thing one should remember that Science
has come from God to you.

40:51.651 --> 40:53.571
It has not come from you.

40:53.571 --> 40:55.851
For example, if you say there is gravity.

40:55.851 --> 40:59.911
Now, you have not put gravity in the Mother
Earth, did you?

40:59.911 --> 41:05.001
We can not even transform one flower into
a fruit.

41:05.001 --> 41:06.811
Not one flower into fruit.

41:06.811 --> 41:08.171
Can you imagine?

41:08.171 --> 41:12.240
So there is some living power which is doing
this living job.

41:12.240 --> 41:18.830
Now think an Indian has a child he is an Indian,
this sorting out is done.

41:18.830 --> 41:24.541
You know that any foreign matter that goes
into the body is thrown away.

41:24.541 --> 41:25.650
Has to be thrown away.

41:25.650 --> 41:31.281
But when the fetus is conceived, then it is
kept, nourished, properly looked after and

41:31.281 --> 41:35.561
is thrown out at the right time.

41:35.561 --> 41:37.221
Who does that job?

41:37.221 --> 41:39.471
We must think.

41:39.471 --> 41:47.291
There are so many things for example acidic
(* unclear text- some medical name) of course

41:47.291 --> 41:51.221
doctors, I must say or scientists are honest.

41:51.221 --> 41:54.631
So they say, their mode of action in human
body they can not explain.

41:54.631 --> 41:58.321
They just openly say if they can not.

41:58.321 --> 42:02.001
Because it may augment or it may not.

42:02.001 --> 42:05.680
But Sahaja yoga can explain, why it happens.

42:05.680 --> 42:10.311
Why it has to happen like that.

42:10.311 --> 42:18.120
Now the jumping from this knowledge from the
mind into the knowledge of the eternal is

42:18.120 --> 42:19.341
a difficult task.

42:19.341 --> 42:20.341
To accept it.

42:20.341 --> 42:26.640
Because as doctor (*unclear text) has told
you that when we get education we think we

42:26.640 --> 42:29.071
know quite a lot.

42:29.071 --> 42:30.900
Not that you do not know.

42:30.900 --> 42:32.532
Not that, this knowledge is not needed.

42:32.532 --> 42:33.532
Its very important.

42:33.532 --> 42:35.990
If you are a doctor, you will be a great sahaja
yogi.

42:35.990 --> 42:36.990
No doubt.

42:36.990 --> 42:43.330
But something is not known to you which is
much greater than what is known to you.

42:43.330 --> 42:51.830
So this human awareness, this “chetna”
that is within you today has to rise to that

42:51.830 --> 42:58.360
level or you have to become that subtle that
you can enter into your roots.

42:58.360 --> 42:59.360
Alright?

42:59.360 --> 43:05.761
So on this point we start moving further that
you are paying attention to me but if I say

43:05.761 --> 43:07.881
pay attention to yourself.

43:07.881 --> 43:09.591
You can not.

43:09.591 --> 43:12.430
How will you do it.

43:12.430 --> 43:13.430
You can not do it.

43:13.430 --> 43:15.941
You can not see your self, you can not see
your organs, you can not see your body, you

43:15.941 --> 43:20.420
can not see anything, you can not see your
mind.

43:20.420 --> 43:24.031
You can not feel it.

43:24.031 --> 43:27.071
So what should happen?

43:27.071 --> 43:31.580
Say something falls down, immediately our
attention goes there.

43:31.580 --> 43:38.120
Some happening has to take place within ourselves
and that happening is nothing but kundalini

43:38.120 --> 43:40.890
awakening.

43:40.890 --> 43:47.511
Now this kundalini is a force which is lying
in the triangular bone which is called as

43:47.511 --> 43:48.511
sacrum.

43:48.511 --> 43:55.511
(Shri Mataji asks for some water in hindi/marathi)
I have been speaking and speaking and hours

43:55.511 --> 44:04.441
and hours together.

44:04.441 --> 44:08.191
Now this triangular bone is called as sacrum.

44:08.191 --> 44:10.091
Sacrum means sacred.

44:10.091 --> 44:12.031
In greek language, sacrum means sacred.

44:12.031 --> 44:17.490
When I went to Greece, I asked them why do
you call it sacrum?

44:17.490 --> 44:25.621
So they told me that they had a rapport with
Indians much much before, Alexander came here

44:25.621 --> 44:31.761
and the Indians told them that there is a
power in this triangular bone.

44:31.761 --> 44:33.111
Can you imagine?

44:33.111 --> 44:40.711
We have forgotten it, we have lost it because
we have studied only the british or whatever

44:40.711 --> 44:44.801
is english or you can call it a western medical
science.

44:44.801 --> 44:50.611
But in our science, you will be surprised,
fourteen thousand years back Markandeya has

44:50.611 --> 44:52.501
talked about it.

44:52.501 --> 44:59.991
We Indians are best suited to understand this.

44:59.991 --> 45:05.771
Now many people say that Mahasrashtra has
got three and a half “pithas”.

45:05.771 --> 45:11.461
Many people must have heard there are three
and a half “pithas” one of them is “Mahalaxmi”,

45:11.461 --> 45:20.631
then another is “Tulzapur Bhavani” then
third one is “Mahur” and half one is “Chaturshringi”.

45:20.631 --> 45:23.541
Now (*unclear text) something so funny and
stupid.

45:23.541 --> 45:27.891
I mean, I can undertand as doctors.

45:27.891 --> 45:29.751
But its not.

45:29.751 --> 45:30.991
Believe me.

45:30.991 --> 45:35.141
These are the three and a half coils of the
kundalini of the whole universe placed in

45:35.141 --> 45:36.701
your Maharashtra.

45:36.701 --> 45:51.131
They are the source of that power within your
own country this great Maharashtra.

45:51.131 --> 45:55.111
Now people may not believe it.

45:55.111 --> 45:59.771
But how will you know?

45:59.771 --> 46:06.351
Now, somebody says “this is a “jagrut
sthana” (means awakened place) I mean doctors

46:06.351 --> 46:07.351
do namaskar to Ganesha and they go to temple
and all.

46:07.351 --> 46:16.511
But they do not know that Ganesha is placed
within us and he controls our prostate and

46:16.511 --> 46:18.791
he controls all our pelvic plexuses.

46:18.791 --> 46:21.891
We do not know this.

46:21.891 --> 46:26.641
But he resides there.

46:26.641 --> 46:37.181
So to jump from that to this is rather difficult
for a medical man, I understand that.

46:37.181 --> 46:42.611
(unclear/inaudible text) who were studying
with me I never talk to them about Kundalini

46:42.611 --> 46:43.611
or anything.

46:43.611 --> 46:46.361
I just wanted to be like them to understand
how their brains have worked.

46:46.361 --> 46:50.511
For them, this is knowledge, this is everything,
nothing beyond.

46:50.511 --> 46:56.051
And anybody who talks about it they turn faces
like that.

46:56.051 --> 47:02.301
Now I do not want you to come to any conclusion
by saying of course Gyaneshwara has talked

47:02.301 --> 47:07.331
about it so he can not be wrong and this and
that.

47:07.331 --> 47:09.551
Not at all.

47:09.551 --> 47:19.561
But scientifically, we have to understand
that we have not got answers to many questions.

47:19.561 --> 47:24.541
That means there is no sufficient light, in
our knowledge.

47:24.541 --> 47:29.481
If you are coming in this room in darkness
you might find a mic, you might find a table,

47:29.481 --> 47:30.991
you might find something.

47:30.991 --> 47:32.781
This becomes the truth.

47:32.781 --> 47:36.151
Because the eyes are not yet opened or the
light is not there.

47:36.151 --> 47:41.231
But supposing by any chance, somebody can
open the light, you can see all the things.

47:41.231 --> 47:42.231
Isn’t it?

47:42.231 --> 47:47.701
That what doctor Berjodi ji is talking about
the integration part.

47:47.701 --> 47:49.631
Now this light is nothing but your auto.

47:49.631 --> 47:53.361
Which you talk of as “Autonomous Nervous
System”.

47:53.361 --> 47:55.781
You just give the name, Auto.

47:55.781 --> 47:57.391
Now, who is auto?

47:57.391 --> 47:58.601
We accept it.

47:58.601 --> 48:04.381
When we get the names, we just accept the
name, we never ask why it is called auto.

48:04.381 --> 48:11.221
Because it is “swayamchalit” (which runs
by itself) who is the swayam?

48:11.221 --> 48:13.771
Who is the “sw” is the spirit.

48:13.771 --> 48:19.361
In a way, we have accepted because we have
to fix somebody as auto otherwise we don’t

48:19.361 --> 48:20.361
know what to do.

48:20.361 --> 48:25.811
I mean, we see parasympathetic working, sympathetic
working so we have to fix up somebody as a

48:25.811 --> 48:29.571
person behind the two.

48:29.571 --> 48:32.891
But that auto is the spirit, is the “atma”,
we do not want to accept.

48:32.891 --> 48:33.891
Alright.

48:33.891 --> 48:34.891
We will call it auto if you don’t like it.

48:34.891 --> 48:38.711
For the scientist, if they don’t like it
we will call it auto only.

48:38.711 --> 48:43.141
So this Mr. auto, is the atma according to
Sahaja Yoga.

48:43.141 --> 48:45.631
We call it atma, you call it auto.

48:45.631 --> 48:49.661
That’s the only difference of names.

48:49.661 --> 48:52.541
Now this auto exists within us.

48:52.541 --> 48:57.001
But this auto is not in our central nervous
system.

48:57.001 --> 48:58.001
That is true.

48:58.001 --> 49:01.201
Because we can not control our parasympathetic.

49:01.201 --> 49:08.991
We may be able to excite our sympathetic but
not the parasympathetic, that’s the fact.

49:08.991 --> 49:12.271
Sympathetic, if we excite, it, we can work
out.

49:12.271 --> 49:14.771
But parasympathetic we can not work out.

49:14.771 --> 49:17.151
It works automatically.

49:17.151 --> 49:22.801
So somehow or other, if you can bring that
auto in your attention or in your central

49:22.801 --> 49:28.071
nervous system then you can manage the show
better.

49:28.071 --> 49:29.851
Scientifically.

49:29.851 --> 49:32.071
I am just going scientifically.

49:32.071 --> 49:33.071
Alright.

49:33.071 --> 49:36.791
Now, how to bring this auto in your attention?

49:36.791 --> 49:38.021
How to control this auto?

49:38.021 --> 49:40.611
Is the problem.

49:40.611 --> 49:42.251
You can not do through science.

49:42.251 --> 49:44.131
You can not do through medical science.

49:44.131 --> 49:46.321
Through any science you can not do.

49:46.321 --> 49:50.541
Because this will only happen when you will
evolve to another stage.

49:50.541 --> 49:52.711
And science can not bring in evolution.

49:52.711 --> 49:53.711
Can it?

49:53.711 --> 49:58.141
It can not give you wisdom and it can not
give you evolution.

49:58.141 --> 50:01.281
Evolution it can not give.

50:01.281 --> 50:03.311
Why?

50:03.311 --> 50:13.641
It can not even create life, I would say.

50:13.641 --> 50:21.201
So this auto, to be in your central nervous
system we should look inside ourselves.

50:21.201 --> 50:30.301
There could be some arrangement and for that
the knowledge is in your great country.

50:30.301 --> 50:32.221
Already there.

50:32.221 --> 50:36.071
You are the one who have inherited that (unclear
text).

50:36.071 --> 50:39.791
This is what you have inherited.

50:39.791 --> 50:44.131
It is your inheritance which is lost.

50:44.131 --> 50:50.171
But one must know that when the tree grows
too high it must have roots.

50:50.171 --> 50:54.651
And that is how, whatever they are saying
about me..I am the tap root, I must say.

50:54.651 --> 50:59.851
Who has done the seeking inside perhaps or
I have reached at source and that’s how

50:59.851 --> 51:02.831
I know what is the root.

51:02.831 --> 51:10.181
In our country, many saints have tried to
go through that path and have found out.

51:10.181 --> 51:14.801
They have tried to express it in many ways
but they kept it a secret till the sixth century

51:14.801 --> 51:18.551
when Adi Shankaracharya came and he talked
about it very clearly.

51:18.551 --> 51:24.201
He talked about kundalini, he talked about
all the chakras, he talked about everything.

51:24.201 --> 51:26.811
But who reads Adi Shankaracharya.

51:26.811 --> 51:30.581
Atleast the medical man does not.

51:30.581 --> 51:38.861
I mean, I don’t blame them because they
are so busy.

51:38.861 --> 51:40.921
And after that it was all exposed.

51:40.921 --> 51:43.871
Then Kabira clearly, clearly, clearly absolutely
clearly talked about it.

51:43.871 --> 51:47.311
So Sahaja yoga is not a new system.

51:47.311 --> 51:49.371
It is “Anadi”, it is old.

51:49.371 --> 51:53.811
Only thing, what has happened to Sahaja Yoga
today that it has become a “Mahayoga”.

51:53.811 --> 51:58.121
That there are many many thousands can get
realization.

51:58.121 --> 51:59.581
That was not possible and feasible.

51:59.581 --> 52:05.871
This is the only thing that has happened that
today the blossom time has come and many flowers

52:05.871 --> 52:08.741
can become fruits.

52:08.741 --> 52:12.061
And that’s how even an ordinary person gets
self realization.

52:12.061 --> 52:16.731
A poor man can get realization, a doctor can
get realization.

52:16.731 --> 52:20.461
Anybody can get realization.

52:20.461 --> 52:22.431
And sooner you get the better it is.

52:22.431 --> 52:26.271
So now the first thing what will happen to
you.

52:26.271 --> 52:28.831
Supposing you get the light within yourself
and you can see within yourself.

52:28.831 --> 52:32.421
Say you have an X-ray to see yourself within
yourself.

52:32.421 --> 52:36.421
So first thing that should happen to you is
that you should know about yourself, what’s

52:36.421 --> 52:38.951
the problem with you.

52:38.951 --> 52:45.321
You’ll be amazed people end up in lunatic
asylums and till they are absolutely gone

52:45.321 --> 52:48.851
cases people do not know that they are mad.

52:48.851 --> 52:49.851
Same about cancer.

52:49.851 --> 52:55.011
I would say, cancer can be detected much earlier
than doctors can detect it.

52:55.011 --> 52:58.570
Very simple it is.

52:58.570 --> 53:01.731
Any disease connected with liver is another
thing.

53:01.731 --> 53:07.410
I would say even liver problems are not detected
till a patient gets a cirrhosis or some sort

53:07.410 --> 53:15.510
of a disease which is absolutely fatal and
you declare alright, now you go into coma.

53:15.510 --> 53:16.510
Finished!

53:16.510 --> 53:21.451
These can be detected through Sahaja Yoga
very well because once you are enlightened,

53:21.451 --> 53:22.581
your fingers.

53:22.581 --> 53:26.650
These five fingers, six and seven (ShriMataji
describes the chakras on her palm) They start

53:26.650 --> 53:27.650
denoting the centers.

53:27.650 --> 53:29.030
And on these fingers you can know.

53:29.030 --> 53:35.900
Now according to Sahaja Yoga left side deals,
left side sympathetic deals with your emotional

53:35.900 --> 53:39.731
side and right side deals with physical and
mental side.

53:39.731 --> 53:40.731
Clearcut.

53:40.731 --> 53:45.900
So now you see a person who is very busy.

53:45.900 --> 53:49.240
Who is a doctor, say for example.

53:49.240 --> 53:56.071
He is a very busy man and he has no time at
all.

53:56.071 --> 53:59.020
He is always looking at his watch, naturally.

53:59.020 --> 54:00.061
So what happens to him?

54:00.061 --> 54:03.571
He becomes a right sided person.

54:03.571 --> 54:07.491
Because he is using his physical being and
also he is mental being.

54:07.491 --> 54:10.870
But the emotional becomes little dried out.

54:10.870 --> 54:13.770
So emotionally he is not so good.

54:13.770 --> 54:15.341
Emotionally, he goes off.

54:15.341 --> 54:18.171
As a result, you won’t believe.

54:18.171 --> 54:23.001
As a result of this imbalance what disease
one can get to being with.

54:23.001 --> 54:26.660
According to Sahaja Yoga, this is another
principle.

54:26.660 --> 54:30.390
According to Sahaja Yoga because I will not
say that medical people will agree to it or

54:30.390 --> 54:31.400
they have found out.

54:31.400 --> 54:35.270
They might find out later on but just now
they have not found, so far.

54:35.270 --> 54:38.321
Because I did medicine, because you are all
younger to me in age.

54:38.321 --> 54:41.780
So when i did my medicine you might have been
just young boys.

54:41.780 --> 54:44.701
So may be my terminology may be little different.

54:44.701 --> 54:46.731
But does not matter.

54:46.731 --> 54:51.551
So according to Sahaja Yoga the brain is made
of fat cells.

54:51.551 --> 54:54.101
That is according to medical science also.

54:54.101 --> 55:01.640
Now these fat cells, when they are used too
much they are replaced, they are replaced

55:01.640 --> 55:05.581
by the fat of the stomach.

55:05.581 --> 55:11.971
And the conversion for the use of the brain
of the special cells is created by a center

55:11.971 --> 55:16.770
we call at “Swadhisthana Chakra” which
actually on the physical level you can say

55:16.770 --> 55:18.551
is aortic plexus.

55:18.551 --> 55:19.551
On the physical.

55:19.551 --> 55:22.691
In the “Sukshama” (subtle) is swadhisthana
Chakra.

55:22.691 --> 55:30.121
So one of the jobs of the swadhisthana chakra
is to convert these cells for the use of the

55:30.121 --> 55:31.121
brain.

55:31.121 --> 55:38.880
And the other job is to look after your liver,
look after your pancreas, look after your

55:38.880 --> 55:43.390
spleen and your kidneys and in ladies, uterus.

55:43.390 --> 55:45.130
Part of it.

55:45.130 --> 55:50.591
So when you think too much or plan too much
and you are futuristic.

55:50.591 --> 55:56.471
Most of the time this poor one, swadhistahana
chakra is busy coping with that thinking process

55:56.471 --> 55:58.520
and replacing the brain cells.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.520
Alright.

55:59.520 --> 56:04.481
So it neglects all these organs which are
very vital and important to us.

56:04.481 --> 56:13.811
So the first trouble one many get by thinking
too much is diabetes.

56:13.811 --> 56:18.311
Now, if you ask a doctor, he will say don’t
eat sugar.

56:18.311 --> 56:21.630
But this is no cure of the disease.

56:21.630 --> 56:26.061
But you see villagers eat at least five spoons
in one cup of tea.

56:26.061 --> 56:28.081
At least five spoons.

56:28.081 --> 56:30.101
They never get diabetes.

56:30.101 --> 56:36.260
It’s only the people who think and plan
too much for the future get it.

56:36.260 --> 56:39.640
First is diabetes.

56:39.640 --> 56:44.691
The another is very dangerous is leukemia.

56:44.691 --> 56:51.311
Leukemia also one gets from the same type
of life style.

56:51.311 --> 56:52.980
Believe me.

56:52.980 --> 56:59.741
Because you know at emergencies, this spleen
has to produce new RBCs(red blood corpuscles)

56:59.741 --> 57:01.790
that is accepted.

57:01.790 --> 57:02.790
Alright.

57:02.790 --> 57:10.681
Now, a person who is getting up in the morning,
see rushing up, just, its very interesting

57:10.681 --> 57:11.681
how it is.

57:11.681 --> 57:13.331
Just think of it.

57:13.331 --> 57:17.211
Everybody does that but we never see ourselves
how we behave.

57:17.211 --> 57:21.901
And he goes to the bathroom and comes out
with his pants just being tied up and the

57:21.901 --> 57:25.490
wife is there to give him breakfast and one
side he is eating the breakfast.

57:25.490 --> 57:30.010
Then is reading the newspaper getting another
shocks after shocks from the newspaper then

57:30.010 --> 57:34.231
he gets into the car and there is jam and
he does not know how to drive and all that.

57:34.231 --> 57:37.851
He is a sure patient for leukemia.

57:37.851 --> 57:46.280
Because poor this spleen has to produce new
blood corpuscles all the time and it becomes

57:46.280 --> 57:47.280
hectic.

57:47.280 --> 57:48.280
Now you may question me, why the children
get it?

57:48.280 --> 57:49.280
Because the parents must be like that.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.601
This is the parents also who can make the
children hectic.

57:51.601 --> 57:57.181
Get up in the morning, go to the school, what
are you doing, this, that..all the time if

57:57.181 --> 58:03.770
you are after your child with a stick in your
hand, the child is due for it.

58:03.770 --> 58:09.091
A mother, who is you see too clever, at home
and very particular about her kitchen and

58:09.091 --> 58:15.441
cleanliness of the whole thing and she can
get after her child.

58:15.441 --> 58:21.360
And such a thing completely upsets that poor
spleen.

58:21.360 --> 58:24.931
And the production of RBCs use their cells
of proportion.

58:24.931 --> 58:27.381
Of Course there is a trigery.

58:27.381 --> 58:33.561
And the trigering takes place as the doctors
call it, I mean recently i saw it that they

58:33.561 --> 58:36.270
call it by Proteins 52 and Proteins 58.

58:36.270 --> 58:39.030
That they call it, these are attacks.

58:39.030 --> 58:44.321
This recently I saw it in England, the research,
the cancer research people had given this

58:44.321 --> 58:46.770
(unclear text) explanation.

58:46.770 --> 58:52.880
And they said it comes from the areas built
within us from of our creation.

58:52.880 --> 58:55.740
And we call it collective subconsious.

58:55.740 --> 58:59.571
In Sahaja Yoga we call it collective subconsious.

58:59.571 --> 59:05.390
Beyond our conscious mind there is subconscious
mind and beyond the subconsious mind there

59:05.390 --> 59:11.081
is collective subconscious mind on the left
hand side.

59:11.081 --> 59:15.130
Now, according to them these are Proteins
52 and 58 whatever you may call it.

59:15.130 --> 59:21.381
Whatever you may call it but we call it a
“bhoot badha”(posession), a simple word.

59:21.381 --> 59:24.431
Or you may call it a “kali-vidya” (black
magic or false knowledge) or whatever it is.

59:24.431 --> 59:31.801
But it is nothing but it is an attack of a
dead soul on a person.

59:31.801 --> 59:33.530
Absolutely, it exists.

59:33.530 --> 59:36.601
And that is how it triggers.

59:36.601 --> 59:48.061
Now virus infection is also the attack of
the vegetables, we can or the vegetations

59:48.061 --> 59:52.671
which have gone out the circulation of your
evolution.

59:52.671 --> 59:54.061
That’s virus infection.

59:54.061 --> 59:58.780
I mean, if you know the source from where
it is coming, you can stop it, isn’t it?

59:58.780 --> 01:00:02.071
Now, doctors can’t believe a bhoot but once
they are caught up with a bhoot, they know

01:00:02.071 --> 01:00:03.761
it is a bhoot.

01:00:03.761 --> 01:00:08.451
Like a met a doctor, was a in in charge of
the hospital and his son was possessed.

01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:11.951
So he came to me and said, “Mother, please
somehow or the other, save my son.

01:00:11.951 --> 01:00:14.691
I don’t know what to do.” and I cured
him.

01:00:14.691 --> 01:00:16.010
He said, “how did you cure?”.

01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:18.711
I said its simple, he is possessed.

01:00:18.711 --> 01:00:21.530
And he was possessed by something and is removed.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:22.530
Its simple.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:25.861
But to tell a doctor, I mean you are in for
trouble.

01:00:25.861 --> 01:00:27.421
But its a fact.

01:00:27.421 --> 01:00:29.361
Believe me, it’s a fact.

01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:34.941
The triggering they have said about 52 and
58, I mean call it anything like auto to call

01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:36.551
to “Atma” you call it auto.

01:00:36.551 --> 01:00:37.551
Alright.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:38.551
So what can we do about it?

01:00:38.551 --> 01:00:44.581
Or if you call it to a “bhoot-badha” as
protein 52 and 58, what should we do?

01:00:44.581 --> 01:00:51.250
I mean you have more sophisticated names perhaps
but its simple like that.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:58.751
So once a person has that kind of wobbly spleen,
he is a good case.

01:00:58.751 --> 01:01:02.540
He is a good case for getting leukemia.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:09.701
Now let’s come to the best part of it, what
one can get ultimately.

01:01:09.701 --> 01:01:16.001
That, when your attention is so much outside
then your spirit in the heart gets upset and

01:01:16.001 --> 01:01:20.841
you get a heart attack.

01:01:20.841 --> 01:01:23.251
All heart attacks are due to this kind of
thing.

01:01:23.251 --> 01:01:29.510
There are two types of hearts; Heart diseases
according to Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:30.551
It’s very simple.

01:01:30.551 --> 01:01:33.731
One is a lethargic heart and one is over active
heart.

01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:42.500
The over active heart gets a heart attack
when, whether you are thin or fat makes no

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.500
difference.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:49.611
The lethargic heart may be from the fat but
the active heart, the one who is extremely

01:01:49.611 --> 01:01:50.611
active.

01:01:50.611 --> 01:01:55.160
All the time thinking of the future and all
that is in for a heart attack.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.591
It’s so simple as that.

01:01:58.591 --> 01:02:01.640
So now, you have to just give a balance to
a person.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.510
Who is a right sided, you give him a balance.

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:08.801
Make left and right, he is cured.

01:02:08.801 --> 01:02:15.581
When you know the “tatwa”, the principle-how
you get diseases then can you not cure it,

01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:17.350
if you know how to cure the “tatwa”?

01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:20.321
Sahaja yoga is like that.

01:02:20.321 --> 01:02:25.461
Sahaja yoga knows the principle and principles
are a few.

01:02:25.461 --> 01:02:27.431
Like colors are very few.

01:02:27.431 --> 01:02:28.431
Isn’t it?

01:02:28.431 --> 01:02:29.431
The mixtures are there.

01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:30.961
Permutations and combinations are there.

01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:37.051
But if you know the principle, you just put
the principle right and the person is alright.

01:02:37.051 --> 01:02:44.660
Like the person (unclear text) was going to
Houston for a By-pass(surgery) and I was speaking

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.211
in a Rotary Club, in Delhi.

01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:50.730
There were about two thousand people.

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:54.630
Suddenly he (text1-shot up/text2- stood up)
came to me and said, “Mother I have to go

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.630
to Houston”.

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:58.141
I said but I am flying out today to Bombay
to go to Pune.

01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.171
I have to go to Pune.

01:02:59.171 --> 01:03:00.461
He said, “I live in Pune”.

01:03:00.461 --> 01:03:02.040
I said, Alright, I’ll meet you there.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:07.311
He came to see me twice, I think and I gave
him vibrations then he went back to Bombay

01:03:07.311 --> 01:03:08.821
and all the doctors said, “Oh!

01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:09.821
What happened?

01:03:09.821 --> 01:03:13.451
These were not your, perhaps these were not
your X-rays or what?

01:03:13.451 --> 01:03:14.451
Its completely cured.

01:03:14.451 --> 01:03:18.191
100% and all that By-pass and all that is
over.

01:03:18.191 --> 01:03:22.600
And for this, what are you going to pay?

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.571
This is just flowing.

01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:26.400
I mean you are also not obliging anyone.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.381
That’s the worst part of it that people
think I am obliging.

01:03:30.381 --> 01:03:31.381
No.

01:03:31.381 --> 01:03:36.691
See, if you are part and parcel of me, say
for example My finger is something wrong and

01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:41.030
I just rub it then I am obliging my finger?

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:43.321
I mean if you are part and parcel of me how
can I oblige you?

01:03:43.321 --> 01:03:52.630
That’s what they were saying that you have
to become the part and parcel of the whole.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:54.691
You just become part and parcel of the whole.

01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:58.010
The arbitrary behaviour becomes malignant.

01:03:58.010 --> 01:04:05.171
Arbitrary behaviour of a cell becomes malignancy.

01:04:05.171 --> 01:04:09.120
Because the centers, now I will tell you about
cancer also on the same simple way.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:12.561
See, its a simple way of explaining cancer.

01:04:12.561 --> 01:04:13.561
Any cancer.

01:04:13.561 --> 01:04:19.931
Now, we can say that, with my hands I might
be able to show you that left hand and right

01:04:19.931 --> 01:04:23.563
hand are two sympathetic nervous systems and
these are the centers in between.

01:04:23.563 --> 01:04:24.563
You can see that.

01:04:24.563 --> 01:04:25.563
(Shri Mataji makes a pyramid with her fingers
and joins the thumbs and index fingers of

01:04:25.563 --> 01:04:26.563
both the hands to show the position.)

01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:27.563
Alright.

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:28.563
These are the centers.

01:04:28.563 --> 01:04:32.721
Now, what happens..a person starts a doing
something extraordinary.

01:04:32.721 --> 01:04:35.410
Something emergency he creates within himself.

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:37.390
It can be with anything.

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:42.711
Now he creates an emergency uses too much
of his sympathetic supposing he uses the right

01:04:42.711 --> 01:04:43.711
side too much.

01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:47.231
Then what happens is this starts wobbling
like that.

01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:48.601
(Shri MAtaji shows this with her hands) this
center.

01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:56.520
And the center starts wobbling and the, there
is a deity inside this which keeps the relationship

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.520
with the whole.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.620
The deity just sleeps off and the relationship
is broken.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:07.611
The relationship with the whole is broken
because the medulla oblongata has got you

01:05:07.611 --> 01:05:13.380
see, inside though to the physical mind it
has not broken but to the subtle thing, is

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.380
finished.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.380
There is no relationship with the whole.

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.461
So what happens, the cells here have no messages.

01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:20.921
So they become on their own.

01:05:20.921 --> 01:05:23.171
And they start becoming bigger and bigger.

01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:24.171
They become on their own.

01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:28.681
You see, they become very ambitious.They start
growing bigger and bigger.

01:05:28.681 --> 01:05:30.081
That’s how you get malignancy.

01:05:30.081 --> 01:05:31.081
Simple thing as that.

01:05:31.081 --> 01:05:33.572
Now what do we do for Sahaja Yoga. it is very
simple.

01:05:33.572 --> 01:05:38.410
If you are a realized soul what you have to
do is very simple is to just put your hand

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:39.730
to the center at the back.

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:43.431
So by giving vibrations you awaken the deity
and its again sucked back.

01:05:43.431 --> 01:05:48.770
You have put together in relationship with
the whole.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:54.270
I mean, I must tell you I cured Mr. Sanjeev
Reddy, you may write to him and ask him.

01:05:54.270 --> 01:06:00.171
Now he had come from America he had gone for
an operation and the operation was a failure.

01:06:00.171 --> 01:06:01.451
And he was in a horrible mess.

01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:05.481
He could not sleep and he was in a big pain
and they tried all kinds of injections and

01:06:05.481 --> 01:06:10.801
I mean you can imagine Sanjeev Reddy (unclear
text) I went with my husband to see him because

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:11.801
he knew my husband.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.010
He knew me also.

01:06:14.010 --> 01:06:17.671
But our high commissioner was * Nehru and
I don’t know why he said to his wife, “you

01:06:17.671 --> 01:06:22.240
know, this is Mataji Nirmala Devi” She had
heard my name in Delhi.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:27.100
She said, “Mataji please cure my husband”
otherwise my husband is not going to say anything.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.611
So I just put my hand on his back, for ten
minutes.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.421
You won’t believe, in ten minutes.

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:32.421
Oh God!

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:35.280
I am feeling so relaxed, let me sleep now.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.211
He slept off and they were thinking...I mean
it was all last thing.

01:06:39.211 --> 01:06:44.951
See, so they had prepared everything that
they didn’t expect him to come alive.

01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:47.211
And when walked out they got a shock of their
lives.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:50.360
You see, they had brought ambulances, he said
“I don’t need any ambulance, nothing.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.691
And just walked off,you see.

01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:54.571
And then he went on for a tour.

01:06:54.571 --> 01:06:56.980
And then when i went to see him, he showed
me his back.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:04.571
He said, “even the scratches, which one
should see atleast a scratch of the operation.

01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:08.000
Even there is not even a scratch, you can’t
see.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Imagine.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.620
The kundalini has done it.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.410
The kundalini is your mother.

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:17.691
She is the one, sitting down there.

01:07:17.691 --> 01:07:19.860
Just waiting this thing to happen.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.280
Because she is your “Shudha icha” (pure
desire).

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.441
She is the pure desire.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:26.380
The rest are “Vikrutas”.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.831
They are perverted.

01:07:27.831 --> 01:07:32.510
The real desire one has is to become one with
God.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:36.660
unless and until that desire is fulfilled
you are not going to be happy.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:39.231
So that desire is sitting down there.

01:07:39.231 --> 01:07:40.620
She is your mother.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.900
Everybody has individual mother.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:47.441
And when this pure desire rises, she integrates
all these centers.

01:07:47.441 --> 01:07:50.750
That’s how you get integrated.

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:55.071
And then she comes upto here (Shri Mataji
touches her Sahastrara) and you can even feel.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.441
In many people the “lup-dup” you see.

01:07:57.441 --> 01:08:00.941
“Anahat”, anahat means without percussion.

01:08:00.941 --> 01:08:05.850
The sound you hear on the head.

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:09.520
You can even see in many people the kundalini
pulsating.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.040
Actually with naked eyes you can see.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:19.250
Today only, we had somebody who had a kundalini
which was just pulsating at the base.

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:22.400
If there is no way of getting out, pulsates.

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.860
Poor thing, you know it just...some people
have just kundalini that just goes on tossing

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:33.150
that “oh God, when I am going to give birth
to my child.”

01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:34.371
and then.

01:08:34.371 --> 01:08:36.601
If you can smooth it out, bring it out.

01:08:36.601 --> 01:08:37.601
It just comes up.

01:08:37.601 --> 01:08:41.120
And then you feel a cool breeze coming out
of your head.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.061
Which is not possible medically.

01:08:43.061 --> 01:08:44.990
Is it possible?

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:51.351
You feel a cool breeze coming out of your
head, you feel cool breeze blowing into your

01:08:51.351 --> 01:08:52.351
hands.

01:08:52.351 --> 01:08:53.351
Then, this is the power.

01:08:53.351 --> 01:08:54.351
Which is the all-pervading power.

01:08:54.351 --> 01:08:57.591
The “Brahma-tatwa” which you can use.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.831
Which is all integrated.

01:08:59.831 --> 01:09:05.431
In Sahaja Yoga language we call it Mahakali,
Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati.

01:09:05.431 --> 01:09:10.660
Then you understand, what was Mohammed Saa’b,
what was Zoraster, what was Christ, who they

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.660
are.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.660
Everything we understand.

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:17.921
They are all integrated, we are only people
fighting among ourselves.

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:20.760
And it works out so beautifully you can’t
imagine.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.071
I wish, all of you get your realization and
work it out.

01:09:25.071 --> 01:09:28.561
I would like to answer your questions, if
you have any please ask me.

01:09:28.561 --> 01:09:32.660
And then let’s have it.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:10:02.811
(Shri Mataji finishes her lecture and sits
down at the chair)

01:10:02.811 --> 01:10:03.811
Someone from the audience:- Inaudible text.

01:10:03.811 --> 01:10:04.811
Shri Mataji in hindi:- What are they saying?

01:10:04.811 --> 01:10:05.811
Yogi:- Can any accidents can occur in Kundalini?

01:10:05.811 --> 01:10:07.051
Shri Mataji:- No, no not in this.

01:10:07.051 --> 01:10:11.761
You see, now there are people who have written
books and books about kundalini.

01:10:11.761 --> 01:10:14.691
I was myself shocked you know when I read
them.

01:10:14.691 --> 01:10:15.691
It’s all absurd.

01:10:15.691 --> 01:10:19.921
You see a person who does not know how to
handle even a scalper and tries to operate

01:10:19.921 --> 01:10:22.061
someone, what will happen?

01:10:22.061 --> 01:10:24.191
That’s what it is.

01:10:24.191 --> 01:10:25.251
Audience:- Inaudible.

01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:29.401
Shri MAtaji:- No, kundalini process there
are no accidents, nothing.

01:10:29.401 --> 01:10:31.150
Nothing happens like that.

01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:41.491
I am just telling that these are Naive people
who do not know how to handle it.

01:10:41.491 --> 01:10:43.261
Alright!

01:10:43.261 --> 01:10:55.251
Audience:- They are saying now that guru is
needed for all this yoga and (* unclear text.)

01:10:55.251 --> 01:11:01.121
Shri MAtaji:- They are saying because they
don’t know how to do it.

01:11:01.121 --> 01:11:07.281
Supposing somebody says, “oh you see, Medical
Science is horrible, don’t go near it.”

01:11:07.281 --> 01:11:11.121
Because they don’t about it what can you
do?

01:11:11.121 --> 01:11:15.771
It’s like putting your fingers in the plug
and saying that electricity is shocking.

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.141
You must know the thing.

01:11:17.141 --> 01:11:27.521
First of all and secondly such a person has
to be a person of character.

01:11:27.521 --> 01:11:37.511
You see a man who is taking money from you,
God does not give blessings to such a man.

01:11:37.511 --> 01:11:38.511
Isn’t it?

01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:56.741
Or he is trying to make money out of you or
he is trying to be...he is a bad character

01:11:56.741 --> 01:12:13.591
man, is a horrible man and he has….you know
“paapi man” (sinner) you can call it.

01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:19.171
Such a person can not do it.

01:12:19.171 --> 01:12:20.691
He doesn’t do it.

01:12:20.691 --> 01:12:23.201
These are all money making propositions.

01:12:23.201 --> 01:12:27.481
And it is only Shri Ganesha who gets angry.

01:12:27.481 --> 01:12:28.561
Not kundalini.

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:44.111
Poor thing she does not do anything but it
is the anger of Shri Ganesha which works on

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:45.111
the sympathetic.

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:46.111
That also you will know, what happens.

01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:47.111
Audience:- (Unclear text) bhakti in Sahaja
Yoga?

01:12:47.111 --> 01:12:48.111
Shri Mataji:- Bhakti?

01:12:48.111 --> 01:12:49.111
Bhakti is very important.

01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:50.111
I mean if you believe in God, then God looks
after you.

01:12:50.111 --> 01:12:51.111
But Bhakti can be an extreme step also.

01:12:51.111 --> 01:12:52.111
Like you are calling, “God, God” when
the God stands before you still you are calling

01:12:52.111 --> 01:12:53.111
God.

01:12:53.111 --> 01:12:54.111
You see that is too much.

01:12:54.111 --> 01:12:55.111
Isn’t it?

01:12:55.111 --> 01:12:56.111
Like, Tulsidasa he wrote so much about Ramayana
and all that.

01:12:56.111 --> 01:13:01.121
But when Shri Rama came to him and he also
gave him a (unclear) still he could not recognize

01:13:01.121 --> 01:13:02.121
him.

01:13:02.121 --> 01:13:03.121
So what’s the use of such a blind bhakti.

01:13:03.121 --> 01:13:04.121
It should not be blind.

01:13:04.121 --> 01:13:05.121
It should be from heart.

01:13:05.121 --> 01:13:06.121
Very important.

01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:07.121
If somebody is a man who has done bhakti from
his heart he gets Sahaja Yoga very fast.

01:13:07.121 --> 01:13:08.121
But actually, now I have seen in Sahaja Yoga
has become so powerful that everyone gets

01:13:08.121 --> 01:13:09.121
realization.

01:13:09.121 --> 01:13:10.121
Not difficult.

01:13:10.121 --> 01:13:11.121
Everyone gets it, not difficult.

01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:12.121
In the villages if you see six thousand people
sitting, all will raise hands.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:13.121
But the complicated and rather difficult (unclear
text) or if you have some disease.

01:13:13.121 --> 01:13:14.121
That also you can make out on the kundalini
but and also there kundalini stops.

01:13:14.121 --> 01:13:15.121
You’ll be amazed if there is somebody.

01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:16.121
Say comes to me and he has a liver problem
then the kundalini goes and she goes on hitting

01:13:16.121 --> 01:13:17.121
the liver you see.

01:13:17.121 --> 01:13:20.381
And even a person who does not understands
that liver is there, he puts his hand and

01:13:20.381 --> 01:13:22.951
there because he sees the kundalini hitting
there.

01:13:22.951 --> 01:13:26.021
So it just shows where the problem is.

01:13:26.021 --> 01:13:30.561
Even if you don’t understand any medicine
you will know where the problem is because

01:13:30.561 --> 01:13:32.881
you know the kundalini will go and start hitting
that point.

01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:39.471
And you will see with your naked eyes.

01:13:39.471 --> 01:13:46.531
Audience: How would you explain the pulsation
of the head in kundalini, please?

01:13:46.531 --> 01:13:49.631
Shri MAtaji:- Sahastrara you mean?

01:13:49.631 --> 01:13:54.601
Audience:- According to A* (unclear text)
because as we know in case of an adult…

01:13:54.601 --> 01:13:56.591
Shri Mataji:- See, I’ll tell you.

01:13:56.591 --> 01:14:01.741
In the brain you see, where the pituitary
and pineal body, in the center of that you

01:14:01.741 --> 01:14:03.891
can say the optic chaisma.

01:14:03.891 --> 01:14:06.061
There is a very subtle center called Agya
Chakra.

01:14:06.061 --> 01:14:07.891
Which is very important.

01:14:07.891 --> 01:14:11.301
Which goes on working when you think too much.

01:14:11.301 --> 01:14:19.361
And the backside is the one which is surrounded
by, you see..I would say that the limbic area

01:14:19.361 --> 01:14:20.361
has got all the seven chakras.

01:14:20.361 --> 01:14:21.701
All the seven chakras within it.

01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:24.231
All the seven chakras limbic area has.

01:14:24.231 --> 01:14:25.711
But they are called as the “Pithas”.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:28.221
Pitahs means the seats of the chakras.

01:14:28.221 --> 01:14:30.231
So all these chakras are represented in our
brain.

01:14:30.231 --> 01:14:31.231
Alright.

01:14:31.231 --> 01:14:32.381
In the limbic area.

01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:39.701
Now out of that this agya chakra is genuinely
here and the pitha is also here.

01:14:39.701 --> 01:14:45.301
The outside, this is the window of that agya
chakra which is in the center of pitutary

01:14:45.301 --> 01:14:48.791
and pineal and it controls pituitary and pineal.

01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:49.791
Alright.

01:14:49.791 --> 01:14:57.891
Now, at the back side of it, it has only two
windows so it is here and here at the back.

01:14:57.891 --> 01:15:02.261
And surrounding that, surrounding is Swadhisthana
Chakra.

01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:06.361
The same one i told you about working poor
thing which has to work very hard.

01:15:06.361 --> 01:15:12.341
Now this one, when you get diabetes what happens
that the swadhisthana goes out of order and

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.171
that’s how you get blind.

01:15:15.171 --> 01:15:17.991
Because swadisthana is surrounding this.

01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:18.991
Here.

01:15:18.991 --> 01:15:21.341
so all the seven chakras are in the limbic
area.

01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:22.341
Is very interesting.

01:15:22.341 --> 01:15:26.071
Yogi:- He said that how do you get the pulsation
here? (he points his hand to sahastrara)

01:15:26.071 --> 01:15:27.071
Shri Mataji:- Pulsation here?

01:15:27.071 --> 01:15:28.071
Pulsation you said?

01:15:28.071 --> 01:15:29.071
Yogi:- Yes.

01:15:29.071 --> 01:15:31.701
Shri Mataji:- because the kundalini rises,
she crosses through this (Shri MAtaji points

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:34.011
to the Agya Chara) and then you start feeling
the pulsation.

01:15:34.011 --> 01:15:35.641
Because it is trying to break through.

01:15:35.641 --> 01:15:40.145
When it breaks, then you get the, that’s
how you get the pulsation.

01:15:40.145 --> 01:15:43.921
You can even with the stethoscope hear the
pulsation on the different chakras to begin

01:15:43.921 --> 01:15:46.311
with then ultimately here you get the pulsation.

01:15:46.311 --> 01:15:47.311
Then it breaks, you see.

01:15:47.311 --> 01:15:51.801
The thing it becomes, you know fontanelle
bone area becomes soft.

01:15:51.801 --> 01:15:53.711
Just like a child’s fontanelle bone.

01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:58.971
In a person who is bald headed, sometimes
you see the whole thing opening out like that

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:04.581
and then you feel the cool breeze coming out.

01:16:04.581 --> 01:16:12.971
Pause
Shri MAtaji:- So should we have realization?

01:16:12.971 --> 01:16:15.071
Let’s try.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:18.221
(unclear text) Alright.

01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:24.511
Take out your shoes, that’s it.

01:16:24.511 --> 01:16:26.861
Because the Mother Earth helps us.

01:16:26.861 --> 01:16:27.861
You see these are all the five elements which
have gone upside down.

01:16:27.861 --> 01:16:28.861
That’s all.

01:16:28.861 --> 01:16:29.861
Just take out your shoes.

01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:30.861
That’s all.

01:16:30.861 --> 01:16:31.861
Is very simple.

01:16:31.861 --> 01:16:32.861
Anybody can get no problem.

01:16:32.861 --> 01:16:33.861
According to these western people, Indians
are very easy.

01:16:33.861 --> 01:16:45.581
They are a very quality of people.

01:16:45.581 --> 01:16:51.501
They are dharmic and they are very great,
according to them.

01:16:51.501 --> 01:16:57.611
And I must also confess that I really break
my hands in the west.

01:16:57.611 --> 01:16:59.091
In India, I must say, they know it very well.

01:16:59.091 --> 01:17:00.741
They have to break also.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.191
Not only me.

01:17:02.191 --> 01:17:03.191
They have to do the same.

01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:07.151
So they are very happy here because giving
realization to Indians is very easy.

01:17:07.151 --> 01:17:09.701
But giving realization to western people is
very difficult.

01:17:09.701 --> 01:17:11.241
So they also have suffered all of them.

01:17:11.241 --> 01:17:13.941
So they will stand by me.

01:17:13.941 --> 01:17:15.792
(unclear text) they all have, they all know
that this is the (bhoot?/Unclear) because

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:17.781
they are very complicated.

01:17:17.781 --> 01:17:20.871
Extremely complicated.

01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:24.861
So many attacks have come to them that they
are complicated, thinking is too much.

01:17:24.861 --> 01:17:28.356
Like this fellow “Freud” has to (Unclear)wrong
ideas into their heads.

01:17:28.356 --> 01:17:35.281
And there is “Bawa” and all this nonsense
and who was that...what was the unholdy trinity

01:17:35.281 --> 01:17:37.031
you were talking about?

01:17:37.031 --> 01:17:38.351
Where is he?

01:17:38.351 --> 01:17:39.351
Bryan?

01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:40.541
“Freud nature of (God/gardener)..

01:17:40.541 --> 01:17:44.971
{Laughter, Shri MAtaji laughs then says a
sentence in Marathi}

01:17:44.971 --> 01:17:47.721
Shri Mataji:- Ah, that’s it.

01:17:47.721 --> 01:17:51.613
You see, that’s it, that’s how they have
been attacked.

01:17:51.613 --> 01:17:52.701
And they accepted all this.

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:58.311
You see, we may be educated in western education
but we don’t forget about God.

01:17:58.311 --> 01:18:04.091
I mean think about God as a part of us and
dharma is within us.

01:18:04.091 --> 01:18:10.621
(Shri Mataji says something in Marathi) and
even Indians if they take to adharmic life

01:18:10.621 --> 01:18:13.801
they still remember that this is adharmic.

01:18:13.801 --> 01:18:18.081
But for them it has become so difficult to
remember that this is dharmic, adharmic.

01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:21.091
That’s an another world.

01:18:21.091 --> 01:18:22.151
Another world, you (unclear) with them nothing
is dharma.

01:18:22.151 --> 01:18:23.151
Is poor thing you know.

01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:28.111
They have been attacked so much and they are
all saints born.

01:18:28.111 --> 01:18:30.872
Surprising part is that they have been saints
they were born in such countries where there

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:36.991
was affluence and they are attacked.

01:18:36.991 --> 01:18:41.071
These are saints, definitely.

01:18:41.071 --> 01:18:44.311
And those who are seekers there are tremendous
seekers.

01:18:44.311 --> 01:18:50.171
I mean you will be amazed these people, they
have been druggists and alcoholics and all

01:18:50.171 --> 01:18:51.171
sorts of people.

01:18:51.171 --> 01:18:52.171
But the day they get realization next day
they give up.

01:18:52.171 --> 01:18:53.171
Indians don’t.

01:18:53.171 --> 01:18:54.171
(Everyone laughs.)

01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:55.171
Indians are chickens.

01:18:55.171 --> 01:18:56.171
They don’t.

01:18:56.171 --> 01:18:57.171
(Laughter, everyone laughs with Mother) I
must say.

01:18:57.171 --> 01:18:58.171
Na, Indians don’t you know so easily.

01:18:58.171 --> 01:18:59.201
They do it, they are saints.

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:06.391
(pointing towards western yogies) this is
the quality that way is very good.

01:19:06.391 --> 01:19:09.391
But on the whole, you see totality.

01:19:09.391 --> 01:19:13.321
I am saying, in general, it’s horrible.

01:19:13.321 --> 01:19:14.321
But they are saints.

01:19:14.321 --> 01:19:17.981
Because the way they give up their things
is amazing.

01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:19.101
Here, you give realization.

01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:21.821
(Marathi sentence something about the habit
of having tobacco) it’s like that.

01:19:21.821 --> 01:19:24.081
You see, they stick on to something.

01:19:24.081 --> 01:19:27.361
I don’t know why, these people just give
up.

01:19:27.361 --> 01:19:28.361
Overnight!

01:19:28.361 --> 01:19:29.361
They are very determined.

01:19:29.361 --> 01:19:31.731
That’s how thing is there.

01:19:31.731 --> 01:19:36.551
I mean that goes in their favour and this
goes in your favour.

01:19:36.551 --> 01:19:40.841
My condition is that some people don’t have
teeth, and some people don’t have “chanas”

01:19:40.841 --> 01:19:44.031
(roasted chickpeas) and some people don’t
have chanas and they have teeth.

01:19:44.031 --> 01:19:45.231
It’s like that.

01:19:45.231 --> 01:19:47.241
So it’s a funny situation.

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:48.241
Alright.

01:19:48.241 --> 01:19:49.241
So let’s have it.

01:19:49.241 --> 01:19:54.141
Now you don’t have to be serious about it,
nothing but it is a very serene thing.

01:19:54.141 --> 01:19:56.351
It’s not serious but serene.

01:19:56.351 --> 01:19:57.351
Just put your hands like this.

01:19:57.351 --> 01:20:01.401
(Shri Mataji opens her palms to show) that’s
all and close your eyes that’s all.

01:20:01.401 --> 01:20:02.941
That’s all.

01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:08.351
Just put your hands straight like this.

01:20:08.351 --> 01:20:09.351
Straight!

01:20:09.351 --> 01:20:11.061
I think better to take out your spectacles
put them.

01:20:11.061 --> 01:20:12.061
This also helps your eyes very much.

01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:13.061
Spectacles you may remove later on.

01:20:13.061 --> 01:20:18.421
Just, it’s so fantastic to (continue/unclear
text) It’s another world I am talking about.

01:20:18.421 --> 01:20:19.421
Hmm…

01:20:19.421 --> 01:20:23.261
Just close your eyes please.
