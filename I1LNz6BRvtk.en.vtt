WEBVTT

05:28.206 --> 05:30.546
Shri Mataji: Be seated.

05:52.484 --> 05:57.587
What’s that?
Yogi: Little Ganeshas, You know.

05:57.796 --> 06:03.707
Yogi 2: Little Ganeshas. The gift.
Shri Mataji: Can you lift this?

06:08.980 --> 06:11.868
Please be seated.

07:05.151 --> 07:11.290
What is shaking?
Yogi: I think it’s the stage.

07:11.491 --> 07:16.028
Shri Mataji: What’s shaking here?
Yogi: The stage, Shri Mataji, I think.

07:16.229 --> 07:18.663
Shri Mataji: Is the energy?! Yogi: I think,
it’s me moving. Shri Mataji: Eh?

07:18.864 --> 07:24.238
Yogi: I think it’s the stage.
Shri Mataji: Yeah…

07:51.794 --> 07:59.714
It was very beautiful of [the] children
to come and receive Me

08:00.857 --> 08:04.292
in this beautiful manner.

08:05.828 --> 08:11.855
It can take you back to the days of Krishna

08:12.898 --> 08:21.452
when, in His childhood, He was very much
respected by His friends

08:21.922 --> 08:29.841
and they tried to do all the honour
that was possible.

08:30.705 --> 08:34.402
You know the story of His birth.

08:35.099 --> 08:38.780
Also you know the story –

08:39.461 --> 08:44.738
[I think if you stop the water then -
otherwise, My speech might be little bit…]

08:51.680 --> 08:54.129
You know the story of His birth.

08:54.330 --> 09:00.163
And here we have the flowing of water,
both the sides.

09:00.654 --> 09:07.556
The way He used to play His flute,
along the Yamuna River.

09:08.944 --> 09:16.359
The whole thing looks, sometimes, so human,
but it is not.

09:16.560 --> 09:24.610
And, at the right time, whenever He needed,
as a child, He manifested His powers:

09:24.811 --> 09:31.212
that He killed a woman who was a devil

09:31.413 --> 09:35.257
[and] ultimately He killed Kansa.

09:37.218 --> 09:44.950
After that you know that He preached Gita,

09:45.151 --> 09:48.894
but it’s not so fast as that.

09:49.095 --> 09:55.911
After killing Kansa, He went down
to Dwarika to rule there.

09:56.768 --> 10:03.165
And there He had to marry five more wives.

10:03.953 --> 10:09.085
First He had sixteen thousand wives.
So then many people can ask a question,

10:09.294 --> 10:13.360
“Mother, what sort of a husband
He must be?”

10:14.013 --> 10:22.954
These sixteen thousand should explain
that He has sixteen petals

10:26.260 --> 10:33.219
on His domain of Vishuddhi chakra

10:35.054 --> 10:42.884
and theses sixteen petals, multiplied
by the one thousand petals

10:43.599 --> 10:46.853
of the Sahastrara become sixteen thousand.

10:47.054 --> 10:54.876
So these are sixteen thousand powers,
which are available to us also.

10:55.483 --> 11:03.099
These sixteen thousand powers are working
in the brain.

11:06.035 --> 11:11.187
These powers could not come
as Sahaja Yogis,

11:11.622 --> 11:15.258
so they came as women

11:15.459 --> 11:20.491
who were entrapped by a king – exactly
sixteen thousand –

11:20.692 --> 11:28.737
and He married them because by marriage,
it was all very dharmic.

11:28.938 --> 11:36.509
Also He married five wives later, who
represented the five elements.

11:40.516 --> 11:47.956
Incarnations cannot be understood
from human angle –

11:48.459 --> 11:52.620
can never be understood, I should say –

11:53.837 --> 12:00.756
because their ways and methods
are different.

12:01.793 --> 12:04.900
They have ways and methods of their own

12:05.101 --> 12:11.765
and they do not expose them to other
people.

12:11.966 --> 12:18.408
Not that they are afraid to expose
or they don’t want to expose,

12:18.609 --> 12:25.623
but it will not be intelligible, it cannot
be understood by human beings.

12:26.608 --> 12:30.522
If you ask Me a question, say, “Mother,
how do you manage that?”

12:30.730 --> 12:35.732
I may just change the topic very cleverly.

12:43.461 --> 12:51.687
So now, I am going to tell you about
sixteen thousand petals of the Sahastrara

12:51.888 --> 12:55.865
and now we can start the translation.

12:56.872 --> 13:00.091
[To the translator: “In gist you can
tell them.”]

14:50.089 --> 14:56.550
So now, to understand the sixteen thousand
powers that you have got

14:56.751 --> 15:02.147
in your brain, already manifesting:
As soon as you get your Realisation

15:02.348 --> 15:08.933
those sixteen thousand powers start
manifesting.

15:20.299 --> 15:35.786
Every petal of Sahastrara has got sixteen
powers.

15:43.162 --> 15:55.370
And these are – I mean the petals -
are made of the five elements.

15:58.908 --> 16:09.996
So these five elements, who create these
one thousand petals,

16:15.020 --> 16:21.702
have got sixteen powers on every petal.

16:24.631 --> 16:32.719
Now the five elements is the right side,

16:34.233 --> 16:45.711
which is the content or, we can say,
the matter of the brain.

16:50.861 --> 17:01.147
The matter of the brain is created
in such a manner

17:01.673 --> 17:05.190
that it has a protective matter also.

17:05.391 --> 17:09.945
So we have grey matter and also

17:10.146 --> 17:15.709
the white matter which is outside
to protect the grey matter.

17:28.692 --> 17:40.004
Now these sixteen powers which are
expressed in every petal

17:43.559 --> 17:47.607
are coming from the left side.

17:49.935 --> 17:54.836
Shri Krishna is an Incarnation of the left
side.

17:57.133 --> 18:04.669
So the sixteen powers which are coming
from the left side

18:04.870 --> 18:13.938
adorn the petals which are made
of five elements.

18:22.757 --> 18:29.320
But these powers already exist
in the brain.

18:31.435 --> 18:44.344
By these five, plus sixteen, powers we do
all our nervous system work.

18:51.041 --> 18:56.775
For example, if you have to lift your hand
like this,

18:58.176 --> 19:05.889
then it is worked, first of all, through
the left side

19:06.090 --> 19:10.417
which desires that it should be lifted.

19:16.643 --> 19:26.512
And then is ordered to the five powers
or five elements: they go into the action.

19:32.217 --> 19:36.539
Also we have in our system

19:37.385 --> 19:47.026
a special type of arrangement where
there is a reflex action,

19:52.153 --> 19:58.710
which is built earlier in our evolution.

20:01.410 --> 20:12.506
So, in a human consciousness whatever
works is not a reflex action.

20:18.594 --> 20:24.451
But now, when your Sahastrara is
enlightened with the Kundalini,

20:24.620 --> 20:35.180
all these one thousand powers multiply it
into sixteen thousand.

20:40.976 --> 20:45.673
So all the nerves in the body get
enlightenment.

20:48.438 --> 20:53.416
Your attention becomes enlightened.

20:55.232 --> 21:03.585
With these one thousand dimensions you
become collectively conscious.

21:06.670 --> 21:15.398
We can say like this: if there are sixteen
people staying in five houses

21:19.881 --> 21:23.567
and they are working separately

21:23.768 --> 21:27.212
and sometimes coordinating.

21:27.940 --> 21:31.360
But [then] a flood comes in.

21:33.827 --> 21:36.507
[Aside to the translator: “Flood, flood.”]

21:38.885 --> 21:45.632
As a result of the flood all these houses
are brought together

21:48.008 --> 21:53.137
and get enveloped into the energy
of that flood.

21:55.078 --> 21:58.777
Then they join hands together.

22:00.574 --> 22:04.244
They forget their houses

22:05.147 --> 22:12.553
and they start using now a new energy
of collective consciousness.

22:15.559 --> 22:19.593
This is exactly what has happened in you,

22:20.701 --> 22:26.999
that as soon as the Kundalini has risen
within you and given you Realisation,

22:27.200 --> 22:36.618
the flood has brought these dormant
energies in you into play.

22:45.746 --> 22:49.881
You don’t have to think that you have
to hold each other’s hand

22:50.082 --> 22:55.107
when there’s a flood, you just hold it
automatically, spontaneously.

23:01.841 --> 23:08.822
So all the energies suddenly start getting
into motion.

23:12.594 --> 23:21.518
So this power where the one thousand
energies of the brain

23:21.719 --> 23:29.240
[are] suddenly awakened, is the power
called as Viratangana.

23:37.316 --> 23:42.181
That is - she is the power of the Virat.

23:45.159 --> 23:53.376
She is the power which makes Shri Krishna
a Virat.

23:57.697 --> 24:06.962
So the sixteen thousand powers which
He achieves in your being

24:10.398 --> 24:15.034
is done through the power of Viratangana.

24:19.250 --> 24:25.761
And at these modern times you know
who is that.

24:28.715 --> 24:33.940
So the Adi Shakti takes the form
of Viratangana.

24:37.413 --> 24:46.358
With that enlightenment you achieve
your Realisation.

24:50.012 --> 24:54.933
So the Kundalini passing through different
centres,

24:55.134 --> 24:59.743
enlightening the different energies,
ultimately comes to the brain

24:59.944 --> 25:04.691
and enlightens the Viratangana power.

25:14.070 --> 25:21.081
At this point, at the brain point,
the Kundalini starts spreading in the head.

25:24.791 --> 25:30.905
She, of course, shoots off from the
Sahastrara but also she trickles down

25:31.106 --> 25:38.584
through this plate of the brain (medha)
downwards on the sympathetic.

25:48.313 --> 25:52.969
That relaxes you. That’s why you feel
relaxed.

25:53.269 --> 25:56.737
It relaxes the sympathetic.

25:57.388 --> 26:02.876
That enlarges the centres.

26:03.320 --> 26:09.807
It brings it back to its normal positions.

26:11.711 --> 26:15.065
The enlargement of the parasympathetic,
or Sushumna,

26:15.266 --> 26:20.230
makes the Kundalini rise in more quantum.

26:27.631 --> 26:34.070
It is all done by a reflex action
of Kundalini.

26:35.972 --> 26:40.615
So the Kundalini is already built in such
a manner that, when she rises,

26:40.816 --> 26:45.669
she automatically does all these things.

26:50.433 --> 26:56.624
So your Kundalini has got the power
to enlighten all your centres,

26:56.825 --> 27:04.293
and to enlighten your brain, and
to relax you,

27:04.494 --> 27:13.517
to increase the size of the centres, and
make the Kundalini rise again!

27:29.053 --> 27:35.214
But the Kundalini has a very special power:

27:36.687 --> 27:42.667
that every human being’s Kundalini
knows Me.

27:46.323 --> 27:48.839
Many people who have just seen
My photograph

27:49.040 --> 27:53.277
have got their Kundalini awakened.

27:58.193 --> 28:03.918
But if your centres are very clouded,
or exhausted,

28:04.119 --> 28:10.214
or jammed together, or separated away
from each other,

28:10.415 --> 28:14.563
then the Kundalini stops there.

28:26.541 --> 28:33.427
That’s why some people get Realisation
very fast and some take time.

28:38.366 --> 28:43.509
These conditioned minds are the most
difficult.

28:46.579 --> 28:48.832
Shri Mataji: What’s happening?
Yogi: I don’t know.

28:49.033 --> 28:52.184
Shri Mataji: Is it touching each other?

28:56.930 --> 29:00.328
Energy joined together.

29:00.688 --> 29:03.990
Yogi translator: But not in the central
way.

29:13.037 --> 29:15.719
Shri Mataji: What’s happening?

29:18.764 --> 29:21.297
Yogi translator: OK? No.

29:25.206 --> 29:34.100
Now the rising of the Kundalini is achieved
better in a place

29:34.301 --> 29:45.995
which is frequented or visited
or lived into by saints,

29:54.340 --> 29:59.781
also for people who are not so complicated.

30:04.799 --> 30:08.669
For example, today only, I discovered

30:08.870 --> 30:14.541
that the Catholic Church has complicated
your lives so much.

30:20.173 --> 30:26.578
I did not know that they have been
preaching that sex is a sin!

30:31.625 --> 30:34.665
Then, if that is so,

30:34.866 --> 30:41.445
that means only Adam and Eve, two
would have lived on this Earth.

30:46.192 --> 30:52.035
And these people were not with Adam and Eve
to know what they did!

30:58.319 --> 31:01.034
And this absurd idea

31:01.235 --> 31:07.655
was very much there also at the time
of Shri Krishna among Indians.

31:11.651 --> 31:18.721
And as a result of that, we had ascetics
who were very hot-tempered.

31:24.774 --> 31:31.909
They developed one-sided personality,
of say, a sun-like,

31:32.110 --> 31:39.299
if they looked at somebody, they could just
burn him off – bhasma (ashes).

31:44.671 --> 31:49.724
And such austerity they had that,
if you had to talk to them,

31:49.925 --> 32:01.491
you had to use at least a distant,
some pole, hollow pole -

32:05.265 --> 32:08.450
such horrid people.

32:11.890 --> 32:15.069
But Shri Krishna when He was born,

32:15.270 --> 32:20.318
He found out this imbalance is being
created.

32:24.697 --> 32:29.829
At the same time His cousin, whose name
was Neminath,

32:30.030 --> 32:37.506
who was a Jain Tirthankara, developed
an aversion to meat eating.

32:37.707 --> 32:40.743
(Aside to the translator: “Meat eating”).

32:50.483 --> 32:56.092
As a result of that, another extreme nature
started,

32:58.632 --> 33:04.263
and people thought that eating meat
is a sin.

33:06.552 --> 33:12.191
All kinds of varieties of ‘sins’ started
prospering.

33:14.183 --> 33:17.011
And they had brands [of sins]; this brand,
that brand.

33:17.212 --> 33:19.818
As you have brands like Christian Dior,
this, that –

33:20.019 --> 33:24.591
like that: this sin, this sin, this sin,
like that.

33:30.467 --> 33:38.790
But underneath, they were very much
infatuated by sex.

33:44.606 --> 33:52.741
They are the ones who started these
erotic temples in India – Jains.

33:56.349 --> 34:04.317
Now the other side of it is that
the horrible Hindu ‘saints’ –

34:04.539 --> 34:07.714
not saints I should say, what should we
call them? – ascetics,

34:07.915 --> 34:13.984
and the terrible, these Jain people,
all put together,

34:14.185 --> 34:20.785
formed a formidable idea about religion.

34:28.231 --> 34:32.798
So Krishna took an Incarnation.

34:34.671 --> 34:39.123
It was not only to kill Kansa

34:41.925 --> 34:49.691
but to tell people that this kind of stupid
conditioning is not religion.

34:53.987 --> 34:59.579
Religion can never be against the natural
laws.

35:02.106 --> 35:12.133
But the ascent starts moving from a sex
which has no maryadas –

35:12.334 --> 35:16.103
or in the lower animals it is even worse
than that –

35:16.304 --> 35:21.196
going up to a point in human beings where
it has to have maryadas:

35:21.397 --> 35:28.915
to be devoted to one person, and be
faithful to that person.

35:52.338 --> 36:03.976
And then He brought forth the religion
of natural maryadas.

36:13.876 --> 36:19.368
You have to marry the person.
Yogi translator: You have to marry.

36:19.569 --> 36:26.742
Shri Mataji: Marry. You had to marry
the person. Marriage.

36:26.943 --> 36:31.569
Yogi translator: Marry? Yes? Shri Mataji:
He gets nervous with the word!

36:39.616 --> 36:44.717
All right. Yes, people do get nervous!

36:51.632 --> 36:59.549
Now, He had married five wives and sixteen
more, sixteen thousand more.

37:01.208 --> 37:06.570
So they challenged (Him), “What do you
say of one marriage with one person?

37:06.771 --> 37:10.449
You already have so many wives!”

37:13.886 --> 37:20.897
Then, I have told you already a story [of]
how He proved that He was a Yogeshwara.

37:25.709 --> 37:30.190
He was beyond all these relationships.

37:32.415 --> 37:41.633
And this shows that, for Yogeshwaras, it
does not matter how many times He married

37:45.850 --> 37:51.538
or, for a Yogeshwari like Me, how many
children I have!

38:15.829 --> 38:22.273
So the times – or what we call
the samayachar –

38:22.474 --> 38:29.168
makes a person behave in a particular
manner which is an Incarnation.

38:35.981 --> 38:46.640
There was a murder case for a man who was
following Hare Rama Hare Krishna [cult].

38:50.294 --> 38:55.239
Of course, it was not established, but
he felt that, after all, he’s Krishna,

38:55.440 --> 38:58.469
so he can kill people.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.760
Now, Krishna was an Incarnation,

39:13.443 --> 39:17.766
He knew whom to kill and how to kill.

39:19.034 --> 39:25.229
He said that, “Nobody is living, now I’ve
already killed them.”

39:30.752 --> 39:36.200
The discretion of an Incarnation is
perfect.

39:37.647 --> 39:43.852
So one should not immediately think that
because an Incarnation has done like this,

39:44.053 --> 39:46.885
so we can also do.

39:51.508 --> 39:55.657
But human beings always take over.

39:58.879 --> 40:04.674
That’s the stupidity part of all the human
beings, I must say.

40:07.670 --> 40:13.524
Like the Christians, all of them believe
they must get crucified

40:16.188 --> 40:18.849
and they must suffer.

40:19.010 --> 40:21.509
Are you Christ?

40:21.710 --> 40:28.771
By so many crucifixions of so many
stupid Christians

40:31.176 --> 40:34.611
what are we going to achieve?

40:35.721 --> 40:42.691
All sorts of complicated ideas come out
of all this kind of a nonsensical thing,

40:44.997 --> 40:49.659
just to say [that] there has to be gloom.

40:51.947 --> 40:58.977
Like yesterday as I told you, is
a miserable people.

41:02.250 --> 41:06.170
Christ crucified Himself so that your Agya
could be cleared

41:06.379 --> 41:09.784
and that you enjoy life,

41:14.535 --> 41:18.627
because Christ Himself was an Incarnation,

41:18.828 --> 41:24.560
and whether you crucify Him or do not
crucify Him makes no difference to Him.

41:28.464 --> 41:32.604
So the difference between the Incarnation
and a human being

41:32.805 --> 41:38.034
is to be understood, first of all,
in Krishna’s life.

41:44.734 --> 41:49.105
When it started raining heavily and when
Indra wanted

41:49.306 --> 41:54.495
to put down Shri Krishna, the rains
were so strong.

41:54.696 --> 42:02.030
He just lifted one mountain, Govardhan,
on His one finger.

42:13.909 --> 42:19.329
So the others, who were His followers,
His Gopas,

42:19.530 --> 42:25.175
they also had some sticks with them,
so they also put some sticks, you see.

42:34.452 --> 42:37.234
But they were children!

42:37.435 --> 42:45.549
Now, I don’t understand the people who
are so grown up, who look grown up,

42:46.025 --> 42:50.627
and behave worse than children!

42:57.060 --> 43:01.516
Nature teaches us all the time.

43:02.751 --> 43:06.224
See now, people are understanding that
whatever they have done,

43:06.425 --> 43:09.254
as far as the marriage is concerned,
is a wrong thing

43:09.455 --> 43:14.261
and now they are coming down to what
Shri Krishna had said.

43:27.113 --> 43:30.839
Shri Mataji: What did you say?
Translator: As far as what is concerned.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.114
Shri Mataji: Again marriage.
Translator: Marriage again!

43:37.991 --> 43:42.842
It’s like a red rag [to a bull] to him!
And to many!

43:43.043 --> 43:48.838
That’s also, I think, is this Catholic
Church.

43:53.492 --> 43:57.624
But why did Christ attend a wedding?

43:59.965 --> 44:04.163
I mean, this should be understood:
if He was against marriage

44:04.364 --> 44:11.106
why did He attend a wedding and also
made wine for them?

44:22.044 --> 44:28.013
But they used that incident just because
they want to drink wine!

44:34.155 --> 44:37.695
But even there, Christ was very careful,

44:37.896 --> 44:42.376
what He did, He made water into wine,
in a second like that.

44:42.577 --> 44:47.296
But to make an alcohol, you must
ferment it.

44:55.441 --> 44:59.458
I can also do that, so what?

44:59.659 --> 45:05.053
But I can’t make an alcohol, I‘ll have
to put some fungus into it.

45:11.128 --> 45:19.981
So, this is what it is: how people have
made God or Incarnations into –

45:20.182 --> 45:26.766
according to their small minds and
according to their selfish ends.

45:32.168 --> 45:35.761
Because if you say that you are originally
a sinner,

45:35.971 --> 45:39.208
then you say, “Now what do we do?”

45:42.689 --> 45:47.232
“Now for atonement, you give lots
of money,”

45:49.861 --> 45:54.326
and God doesn’t understand money –
what’s the use?

45:57.528 --> 46:02.510
Is all wrong, absolutely wrong.

46:02.711 --> 46:04.939
You have committed no sins.

46:05.148 --> 46:09.987
These are all non-existent things
they are talking about.

46:12.915 --> 46:16.555
But I've seen in the West, people would
say, “How can our Kundalini rise?

46:16.756 --> 46:19.679
We are sinners."

46:24.741 --> 46:29.539
Better give up all these conditionings.

46:31.955 --> 46:35.553
Nobody is a sinner:

46:35.754 --> 46:39.178
that’s what Shri Krishna said.

46:39.566 --> 46:45.294
Of course, He divided people into three
categories, basically.

46:48.405 --> 46:54.042
But He said that anybody can get
Self-realisation

46:55.654 --> 46:59.141
and could be enlightened.

47:00.102 --> 47:07.357
If He had believed that people are sinners
He would not have said this.

47:10.535 --> 47:17.979
This is absolutely anti-God and anti-Christ
and anti-Krishna.

47:20.137 --> 47:25.123
Here you are, the Virata has created you,

47:25.324 --> 47:29.309
up to a point, brought you to a point.

47:32.126 --> 47:37.039
Now you are just about to flower out

47:39.912 --> 47:46.397
and already you are told that, as seeds,
you had some disease in you.

47:50.488 --> 47:53.551
So all the great work of evolution,

47:53.752 --> 48:01.469
the great work of taking you to the Kingdom
of God is completely cut out.

48:11.240 --> 48:15.603
So today is the day to be joyous,

48:18.662 --> 48:21.412
to be happy –

48:21.821 --> 48:28.895
but not jumping in the sea [but] keeping
to your boat of maryadas –

48:34.441 --> 48:41.973
because you have got now your brain
enlightened.

48:43.810 --> 48:49.999
This brain is now, such a powerful thing
you have got,

48:50.200 --> 48:55.381
that it pierces through all the five koshas
you have around you,

48:55.582 --> 49:02.543
all the five auras around you, made
by the five elements.

49:11.020 --> 49:16.517
This brain touches the subtle of the ether,

49:20.869 --> 49:24.399
the subtle of the Mother Earth,

49:26.679 --> 49:30.922
the subtle of all the elements.

49:32.422 --> 49:37.214
By this enlightenment you have become
subtle.

49:38.872 --> 49:43.378
So we have to forget about the gross
things.

49:44.539 --> 49:55.084
Gross things just follow anything that is
subtle just like a magnet attracts.

50:01.564 --> 50:10.543
Once in Australia, it was a puja
of Shri Ganesha.

50:12.539 --> 50:19.996
And the hibiscus, red flower, is the flower
for Shri Ganesha.

50:22.918 --> 50:25.657
And when we were going for the puja,
all around

50:25.858 --> 50:29.682
I saw this hibiscus flower coming out.

50:33.470 --> 50:36.406
So I told Sahaja Yogis, “Better stop
the car somewhere,

50:36.607 --> 50:41.902
and get hold of some of these flowers
for the puja."

50:45.223 --> 50:48.509
But then they forgot!

50:50.004 --> 50:56.455
You know the mantra, “Ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu bhranti rupena samsthita”.

50:58.524 --> 51:00.529
So the illusion.

51:00.730 --> 51:06.827
And then, they suddenly remembered, “Oh
Mother, we’ve forgotten the flowers!”.

51:11.056 --> 51:16.391
I said, “It’s nice you’ve forgotten,
somebody has taken over from you.

51:18.183 --> 51:21.322
That’s why you have forgotten."

51:21.819 --> 51:26.795
When we reached the puja thing, the whole
place was filled

51:26.996 --> 51:32.396
with baskets and baskets
of those flowers!

51:37.730 --> 51:43.190
So when you forget, don’t think that
you have forgotten something,

51:43.391 --> 51:46.967
so something has gone wrong with you.

51:52.145 --> 51:57.217
No, it has gone to your subtle
understanding,

51:59.571 --> 52:03.992
which works out in a reflex manner,

52:04.367 --> 52:10.012
but into sixteen thousand dimensions.

52:11.282 --> 52:16.934
Can you imagine an instrument with sixteen
thousand wires

52:17.135 --> 52:20.673
connected with another sixteen thousand
wires

52:20.874 --> 52:28.955
with another sixteen thousand wires, and
all the time working so efficiently?

52:36.237 --> 52:39.800
This is the work of Virata

52:40.337 --> 52:44.973
and this is the work of this enlightened
mind.

52:47.325 --> 52:52.331
So you don’t have to worry about the gross
part.

52:53.145 --> 52:56.914
You want an ashram, you’ll have it.

53:16.221 --> 53:23.213
Anything gross, mundane, will work out.

53:24.986 --> 53:28.021
But, at this stage, you must remember

53:28.222 --> 53:34.739
that you have to just put your
attention to it for a minute.

53:37.771 --> 53:44.433
Just an attention – what we say is
the bandhan – and it works.

53:47.749 --> 53:49.782
But the main thing one has to remember [is]

53:49.983 --> 53:55.001
that we are Yogis, we are enlightened
souls.

53:57.263 --> 54:02.355
We are specially blessed people with
special powers.

54:04.188 --> 54:08.441
And there are very simple ways by which
we can control

54:08.651 --> 54:12.335
all these mundane things.

54:15.223 --> 54:21.274
And the whole thing will happen so
beautifully that you’ll be surprised!

54:25.266 --> 54:32.238
That is what one has to realise: the powers
of your Sahastrara.

54:34.688 --> 54:40.340
I’ve told you that sixteen powers already
were there.

54:41.579 --> 54:46.658
So, sixteen powers that were there,
were twelve of the heart

54:46.859 --> 54:52.712
and four of Shri Ganesha, were
in your brain already.

54:58.317 --> 55:01.253
And that is how you were an emotional
person

55:01.454 --> 55:07.160
and you had relationships of emotions
and also relationships

55:07.361 --> 55:15.663
with others of innocence as well
as of relationship of marriage.

55:24.324 --> 55:29.677
This was all built-in within you.

55:32.244 --> 55:38.544
But because of these kind of stupid ideas,
all these natural feelings were suppressed,

55:38.753 --> 55:43.839
that nobody was a sister, nobody was
a child, nobody was a brother,

55:44.040 --> 55:50.725
and all these stupid ideas have finishes
those beautiful feelings

55:50.926 --> 56:03.192
of flowers, of fragrance – completely
destroyed.

56:23.084 --> 56:29.566
The false fears and the false ideas
and the false prohibitions,

56:29.767 --> 56:35.345
all have ruined that part of the brain.

56:43.658 --> 56:47.071
The ‘gauche’, correct.

56:48.507 --> 56:52.823
Aand the right side started working.

56:53.998 --> 56:57.676
Only the right side working.

56:58.040 --> 57:01.931
Then left side doesn’t exist,

57:02.132 --> 57:07.244
all the values of the left side do not
exist.

57:08.220 --> 57:14.559
Only the right side and the connection
with the right side,

57:14.943 --> 57:19.390
with the things that we do with the right
side.

57:25.412 --> 57:29.775
Also to add it up, so many things came
like industrial revolution

57:29.976 --> 57:36.522
and the war and all that, so the right side
became the dominant part

57:40.821 --> 57:44.284
and this ego developed.

57:44.593 --> 57:50.785
Ego makes you feel very important
and you just -

57:50.954 --> 57:56.239
love becomes nothing but egocentric.

58:02.339 --> 58:07.132
In addition to that, when money became
important,

58:09.061 --> 58:17.238
then it is like somebody who is already
a drunk man, and a scorpion bites him.

58:19.048 --> 58:23.078
The situation was very bad.

58:24.284 --> 58:31.844
All the ways and methods, permutations
and combinations,

58:32.045 --> 58:41.040
of escalating this situation, escalating
this ego was created by the same ego.

58:50.057 --> 58:55.985
This is the most dangerous thing we have
in the West.

58:57.286 --> 59:04.036
For them, even a love for the wife

59:04.237 --> 59:09.580
(Aside: “Thank you. Thank you very much.
It’s alright.”)

59:10.025 --> 59:19.057
is a thing to be valued in money.

59:25.748 --> 59:29.376
Everything is business,

59:29.577 --> 59:36.235
whether it is church, whether it is mafia,

59:36.675 --> 59:39.481
whether it is politics,

59:39.682 --> 59:43.591
everything is money.

59:44.218 --> 59:47.714
Money becomes the power.

59:49.222 --> 59:53.593
Then, if money is everything, why care
for chastity?

59:53.794 --> 59:57.702
Why care for innocence?

01:00:01.822 --> 01:00:06.076
Why care for art?

01:00:07.141 --> 01:00:11.391
Whatever can sell is art.

01:00:13.307 --> 01:00:18.104
Whatever can fetch money is a relationship.

01:00:19.485 --> 01:00:24.014
So the whole dryness on the left hand side

01:00:24.692 --> 01:00:38.038
created a problem again for the left-sided
extremes to be sucked in.

01:00:45.881 --> 01:00:50.879
So the Collective Subconscious was sucked
into your subconscious mind

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.539
and then to your conscious mind.

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:09.189
And you can say that the ego reached
such a point into your brain

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:15.362
that it started getting into superego,

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:27.218
and a very messy personality was created.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.020
So I have to tell you one thing:

01:01:35.221 --> 01:01:39.572
you are in for your ascent,

01:01:41.236 --> 01:01:45.887
you are in for getting all your powers,

01:01:50.163 --> 01:01:57.145
and you are in for your Kingdom of God,

01:01:58.439 --> 01:02:04.701
but you must work out your left side

01:02:06.464 --> 01:02:13.083
with understanding of purity,

01:02:14.693 --> 01:02:18.246
pure relationships,

01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:23.198
and the right side by facing it,

01:02:25.214 --> 01:02:30.037
the facing [of] your plastic ego.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:39.128
When you don’t want to do something,
ask yourself, "Why am I not doing it?"

01:02:43.454 --> 01:02:52.696
And when the left side is sucked in,
a lethargy, an inertia sets in.

01:02:57.503 --> 01:03:05.121
All the right side gets completely drenched
or completely overpowered

01:03:05.322 --> 01:03:11.257
by the left side powerful entities.

01:03:19.794 --> 01:03:23.999
People feel very tired all the time

01:03:24.425 --> 01:03:31.134
and they want always to drink or to take
drugs to go to the left side

01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:36.694
and the inertia sets in.

01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:41.406
That’s why there’s a problem.

01:03:41.843 --> 01:03:46.554
But collectively, if we understand this is
the problem,

01:03:50.567 --> 01:03:54.538
we all can work it out together.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:04:00.013
Not despising anyone,

01:04:00.489 --> 01:04:04.104
not correcting anyone,

01:04:04.726 --> 01:04:08.134
but correcting yourself

01:04:08.335 --> 01:04:12.137
and not correcting your leaders.

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:16.892
It will work out, I'm sure it will
work out.

01:04:17.093 --> 01:04:20.036
Today is a great day,

01:04:20.237 --> 01:04:24.730
and I remember this France,

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:31.831
such inertia like rock of Gibraltar.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:38.283
I didn’t know how to move their brains;

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:43.099
brains were made of plastic –

01:04:43.337 --> 01:04:45.901
what to do with them?

01:04:46.102 --> 01:04:50.892
Can you believe, in the first year I came
three times!

01:04:52.139 --> 01:04:57.425
I went on banging in France and even
English people said,

01:04:57.626 --> 01:05:01.458
“Mother, why do you go to France so often?”

01:05:07.329 --> 01:05:13.138
Now, even the English are comparable!

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:21.337
I should have been equally dynamic
about them,

01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:24.810
and I was.

01:05:25.574 --> 01:05:30.856
It was a work of tremendous patience,
and love,

01:05:33.546 --> 01:05:40.738
of understanding that they are deserving
cases

01:05:42.965 --> 01:05:47.325
lost in the wilderness of ego.

01:05:51.262 --> 01:05:57.376
But they are the ones who will save Europe,

01:05:57.965 --> 01:06:02.002
England and America.

01:06:02.203 --> 01:06:05.139
May God bless you.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:18.977
You just can - you can remove it
(the microphone).

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:30.816
Now. Is Gavin here? Gavin is good. Just…

01:06:31.017 --> 01:06:35.858
Yogi: Gavin. Gavin.

01:06:39.277 --> 01:06:42.612
Shri Mataji: Also Guido has to...
Yogi: Guido.

01:06:42.813 --> 01:06:47.141
Shri Mataji: All the leaders must come,
I think, it’s better that they come…

01:06:51.843 --> 01:06:54.335
What is that?

01:06:57.316 --> 01:07:03.184
Who made it? Good, thank you.

01:07:17.656 --> 01:07:21.156
Come front to this side, hallo, come along.

01:07:29.898 --> 01:07:33.637
Where is Gavin?
Yogi: Gavin.

01:07:39.868 --> 01:07:46.453
Shri Mataji: Come (Conversation aside
with Gavin, not completely audible)…

01:07:47.854 --> 01:07:52.253
Say the Atharva Sheersha, I hope some
people know by heart.

01:07:52.454 --> 01:07:54.682
Gavin: They’ve got it in their hands now.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:07:54.883 --> 01:07:56.815
Gavin: Everybody has it in their hands.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:07:57.016 --> 01:07:59.640
Gavin: They’ve got five hundred copies.

01:07:59.841 --> 01:08:01.564
Shri Mataji: All right. So you can do
Atharva Sheersha.

01:08:01.765 --> 01:08:07.548
And you could get children to wash My feet,
they are quite a lot.

01:08:07.749 --> 01:08:12.974
Too many! Big problem.

01:08:13.175 --> 01:08:18.328
Alright. You can have them. With three
Atharva Sheersha we should finish all…

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:23.607
you look after, say, “Now it’s over time”.

01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:33.751
Then you have – already you have done
the hundred and eight names of Vishnu.

01:08:33.965 --> 01:08:37.251
Gavin: Yes, we take the names and…
Shri Mataji: Only the twenty-one names

01:08:37.452 --> 01:08:40.978
which they do before the puja, you know
that? Gavin: Yes.

01:08:41.179 --> 01:08:45.778
Shri Mataji: And then you can do the Devi’s
names, I think. Gavin: It’s fine.

01:08:46.273 --> 01:08:52.579
Shri Mataji: But - while doing
the Krishna’s names

01:08:57.095 --> 01:09:03.376
you can wash the hands and the Feet.
While doing the Devi’s names,

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:12.330
you can dress Me up, it’s possible;

01:09:15.074 --> 01:09:19.005
or if you know some songs of Krishna,
instead of taking His names,

01:09:19.206 --> 01:09:21.864
you can sing it.

01:09:22.065 --> 01:09:23.453
Gregoire: "Radha Krishna Bajile"?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:09:23.654 --> 01:09:25.526
Gregoire: "Radha Krishna Bajile"?
Shri Mataji: You have?

01:09:25.727 --> 01:09:27.531
Gregoire: If people know.
Shri Mataji: Some fews.

01:09:27.732 --> 01:09:30.691
Gavin: People are there. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Gavin: The music people are there.

01:09:30.892 --> 01:09:34.059
Shri Mataji: All right, is all right.

01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:43.230
You see, could be better to have it,
music, a little.

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:47.500
Again it becomes very serious, you see.

01:09:58.848 --> 01:10:03.122
All right. So you can sit next to the
thing. Gavin: Yes.

01:10:03.323 --> 01:10:09.126
Shri Mataji: And who else knows the
mantras? I think, Guido can come.

01:10:09.723 --> 01:10:12.823
Here, here, this side.

01:10:27.443 --> 01:10:31.492
Otherwise, I - today let the leaders wash
the Feet, it’s better.

01:10:31.693 --> 01:10:38.506
Gavin? Let the leaders wash the Feet.
It’s better because they’ll cleanse out.

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:45.004
From where did you get this one?
Pujari: I don’t know, we had…

01:10:45.205 --> 01:10:47.550
Shri Mataji: It’s poisonous!
Yogi: Which one?

01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:54.311
Shri Mataji: This Datura. This is
for Shankara.

01:10:54.512 --> 01:10:59.718
[Yogi: Shri Shiva] For Shankara,
it’s all right.

01:11:04.472 --> 01:11:08.903
Krishna’s flower is called as Krishna
kamal.

01:11:09.127 --> 01:11:12.963
That type don’t grows here. It’s
a beautiful flower,

01:11:13.164 --> 01:11:19.200
called as Krishna kamal. Is a colour
of that, that sky colour.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:22.266
That’s Shri Krishna colour. (Hindi)

01:11:22.467 --> 01:11:29.042
Possibly, possibly, I think I saw it
in Switzerland in your house,

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:32.145
first house, a Krishna kamal flower.
You had it there?

01:11:32.346 --> 01:11:36.726
Yogi: Yes…
Shri Mataji: Is a kind of a creeper.

01:11:36.927 --> 01:11:44.023
But that was not very unique, because you
had all kinds of … (indistinct), isn’t it?

01:11:44.224 --> 01:11:47.286
Yogi: Just see if it is hot, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Mm? It’s all right.

01:11:48.098 --> 01:11:52.695
Now. Make them start. Now, one person
should be in charge of water.

01:11:52.896 --> 01:11:54.951
Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: And lastly
that person... Accha.

01:11:55.152 --> 01:11:59.467
Now, they want to keep the water here,
handy, or you may - closer.

01:11:59.668 --> 01:12:05.065
Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: One by one, you
have to come and wash My feet. All right?

01:12:09.596 --> 01:12:14.231
Now. You start it. Now. Water - you could
be in charge for the time being.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.183
Have you washed My feet, ah? Start it.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:20.943
[Yogis recite Ganesha Atharva Sheersha]

01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:29.448
Shri Mataji: Somebody should… (unclear).

01:12:59.703 --> 01:13:02.037
Good.

01:13:54.156 --> 01:13:57.828
Good. May God bless you.

01:15:46.399 --> 01:15:48.828
Good.

01:16:46.253 --> 01:16:49.302
May God bless you.

01:17:04.201 --> 01:17:09.377
May God bless you. Looking like a gopa!

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.264
May God bless you.

01:18:17.578 --> 01:18:20.300
Good.

01:18:21.193 --> 01:18:24.057
Good!

01:18:41.286 --> 01:18:45.040
Now, it’s done. Good!

01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:05.944
Same water you can you this also.

01:19:09.315 --> 01:19:12.531
[Not clear]… you can use the same water.

01:19:20.549 --> 01:19:22.961
Rub it hard.

01:19:32.124 --> 01:19:35.903
Rub your hand. Moving.

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:45.326
Good.

01:21:03.766 --> 01:21:07.112
All right. All right.

01:21:07.313 --> 01:21:09.751
May God bless you.

01:21:22.359 --> 01:21:25.371
May God bless you.

01:22:08.219 --> 01:22:12.560
May God bless you. Good. Excellent.

01:22:34.522 --> 01:22:38.048
All right. Excellent.

01:22:52.907 --> 01:22:56.594
You can sing the song of Ganesha now,
it’s all right. You can sing the song.

01:22:56.795 --> 01:23:00.195
Yogi: Shri Ganesha?
Shri Mataji: It’s good.

01:23:00.404 --> 01:23:02.957
They can sing the song
of Shri Ganesha’s song.

01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:10.076
It is – will be better. Should be more
music in Shri Krishna’s…

01:23:29.502 --> 01:23:36.260
Yogi 1: Which song? Yogi 2: Shri Ganesha.
Yogi 3: Shri Ganesha.

01:23:46.997 --> 01:23:51.433
[“Om Bhur Bhuvah Swaha” is sung]

01:28:10.403 --> 01:28:14.301
Done. Exactly at the right time.

01:28:14.598 --> 01:28:20.006
All right. Now the second one – I mean,

01:28:22.185 --> 01:28:26.395
the hundred and eight names of the Goddess;

01:28:26.596 --> 01:28:32.697
but also there’s a better way, is
to sing it, because they have got –

01:28:33.118 --> 01:28:37.635
Gavin, they have got it in music?

01:28:38.035 --> 01:28:42.936
All the songs of – first of all

01:28:43.137 --> 01:28:49.436
the Adi Shankaracharya’s song would be
good idea.

01:28:49.637 --> 01:28:52.463
It flows the vibrations very well.

01:28:52.664 --> 01:28:57.904
Now. Christine? Christine?

01:28:59.098 --> 01:29:04.307
You get about six ladies from France.

01:29:09.133 --> 01:29:11.991
Married ladies.

Yogi: Catherine from Mulhouse, Catherine
from Mulhouse.

01:29:42.523 --> 01:29:46.550
Shri Mataji: …here should not be seated
that side, they should be able to see Me.

01:29:46.751 --> 01:29:50.116
Let’s push a little that side.

01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:16.689
Pujari: The amrut, Shri Mataji?

01:30:17.146 --> 01:30:24.828
[Tere Hi Guna Gate Hai, the song with
the 108 names of Shri Mataji is sung]

01:32:11.512 --> 01:32:14.431
It’s quite hot for Me...

01:32:17.802 --> 01:32:22.628
If they can … little more, then it won’t
be that hot.

01:34:42.236 --> 01:34:45.195
Pujari: Yogurt or more of this?

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:22.329
Pujari: Yogurt?

01:39:38.461 --> 01:39:41.080
Shri Mataji: Water.

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.429
Good.

Shri Nirmala Devi ki!

Yogis: Jai!

01:43:25.402 --> 01:43:28.981
Shri Mataji: And leave the other hand
still…

01:43:35.277 --> 01:43:37.880
Then water.

01:43:58.627 --> 01:44:03.708
This is the - Adi Shankaracharya’s this
thing is very important.

01:44:05.514 --> 01:44:09.356
We have seen Adi Shankaryacharya's.

01:44:09.564 --> 01:44:12.703
Some girls have sung, I don’t know.

01:44:16.606 --> 01:44:18.232
Pujari: More milk, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Ah?

01:44:18.433 --> 01:44:21.568
Pujari: More milk, or sugar?
Shri Mataji: More milk.

01:44:21.769 --> 01:44:24.729
Pujari: Can you put more milk
in this?

01:44:48.242 --> 01:44:51.650
Shri Mataji: Good. More milk.
Absolutely cold.

Let's put some water in...

Christian has still not come?
Yogi: Christian is on the way what’s -

01:45:27.169 --> 01:45:30.840
he left immediately after the talk,
Shri Mataji.

01:52:46.991 --> 01:52:51.745
Any other songs that you would like
to sing? "Amhi Mataji".

01:52:51.946 --> 01:52:54.710
Guido: "Amhi Mataji". Yogi: "Amhi Mataji".

01:53:00.337 --> 01:53:03.297

["Amhi Mataji" is sung]

Shri Mataji (to the ladies about the sari):
Double, double.

Get some more ladies, you see? Get some
more ladies from France.

02:04:47.806 --> 02:04:52.575
Yes. It’s all right. The swastika –
on this one.

02:04:54.708 --> 02:04:56.819
Yeah.

02:05:27.912 --> 02:05:30.044
Yeah.

02:05:32.051 --> 02:05:37.304
Just - just put it here - down below.

02:05:37.514 --> 02:05:41.508
Still swastika is to be created.

02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:46.067
Keep it in the center. (Yogini: Yes)
Good.

02:05:50.255 --> 02:05:55.206
No, no, you have to put that also.

02:05:55.707 --> 02:05:58.057
Put on this one also.

02:05:59.513 --> 02:06:03.983
Put some red at the end of it.

02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:28.899
Put the swastika on it.

02:06:29.885 --> 02:06:33.404
Yogi: May we sing Radha Krishna?

02:06:40.794 --> 02:06:44.699
Shri Mataji: (Aside to lady) It’s all right.
Yogi: May we sing "Radha Krishna"?

Krishna Bajare".

02:06:58.344 --> 02:07:03.204
Shri Mataji: Or should be sung the hundred
and eight names, would be all right, or…

02:07:04.349 --> 02:07:07.812
Or "Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu".

02:07:09.102 --> 02:07:14.374

put … sufficiently?

way round.

Very big head.
Yogini: Put it here, like that...

02:17:50.077 --> 02:17:54.759
Shri Mataji: Still tighter, for a small
head!

02:17:57.885 --> 02:18:00.181
Ladies laugh: We are sorry, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Forgot.

02:18:00.422 --> 02:18:03.938
They always make the big heads for Me.

02:18:06.053 --> 02:18:10.620
All right now. Somehow, it’s still little
bit… all right. This I'll manage.

Take out this, put some other cloth.
No, not that…

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:42.185
So fragrant. Coloured one, yellow one.

02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:57.282
All right, what I’ll do, I’ll put this
shawl, My shawl.

02:18:57.490 --> 02:19:01.960
It’s better with My shawl. But this won’t
show, you see, the colour.

02:19:02.851 --> 02:19:09.000
It’s all right. All right. That’s better.

02:19:16.898 --> 02:19:19.900
Now. Put all these flowers.

02:19:21.976 --> 02:19:25.930
What you can do is to put the shawl
and put all the flowers around.

02:19:26.131 --> 02:19:28.783
You should put all these…

All right?

I think, let the men do it.  Eh? Let
them put the sari on.

02:19:50.187 --> 02:19:53.524
And let them garland Me with the sari.

02:19:55.106 --> 02:19:58.155
Come, you have to be putting the sari.

you can say? All right.

to decorate something else?

This side? You can remove that.

02:29:39.301 --> 02:29:41.760
Hm, finger.

02:31:07.088 --> 02:31:09.577
Take a full (picture).

02:31:15.545 --> 02:31:19.563
Just pull this out a little bit. Loosen
it out. Yes.

02:31:19.764 --> 02:31:23.106
Little bit, yes. Yes.

02:31:31.331 --> 02:31:35.961
Take one full photograph, the full.

02:32:11.096 --> 02:32:14.526
Yogi: The present from the Austrian
sahaja yogis but for all of us.

02:32:14.727 --> 02:32:17.735
It’s pure silver, and we want all to become
pure like this.

02:32:17.936 --> 02:32:19.675
And hollow like this. Shri Mataji: It’s pure
silver! Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

02:32:19.876 --> 02:32:23.029
Shri Mataji: Oh God! So I just don’t know
this one how to play,

02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:26.357
you see, I know Indian ones! All right.

02:32:30.384 --> 02:32:34.973
It won’t work out with Me. All right,
I’ll have to learn.

02:32:42.357 --> 02:32:44.930
May God bless you.

02:32:56.589 --> 02:33:01.573
Hm, put like that.

02:33:42.397 --> 02:33:47.970
Beautiful. This is a modern one.

02:33:53.264 --> 02:33:58.087
Could be better. Thank you…

02:34:04.508 --> 02:34:08.127
Give the photograph for all.

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:13.357
All right. Yogi: Vibrated Prasad, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

02:34:13.611 --> 02:34:16.310
Yogi: Vibrated Prasad?
Shri Mataji: Yes, vibrated.

02:34:18.871 --> 02:34:22.817
Good! Ah, that’s a good idea.

02:34:24.183 --> 02:34:30.887
No... That’s all, it’s too much for Me
to eat everything.

02:34:39.482 --> 02:34:42.474
Krishna never had cakes.

02:34:45.219 --> 02:34:50.544
Hm. I wish Krishna had all this!

02:34:55.108 --> 02:34:59.095
Yogi: Sweet, sweet honey.
Shri Mataji: Accha.

02:34:59.469 --> 02:35:02.917
This is small, good.

02:35:06.818 --> 02:35:09.467
Yogi: This is a present from the yogis
of Canada (a small elephant).

02:35:09.707 --> 02:35:12.676
This is for Shri Mataji.

02:35:12.969 --> 02:35:15.163
Shri Mataji: You are going to give
to all of them? Yogi: Yes.

02:35:15.369 --> 02:35:19.794
Shri Mataji: Beautiful, isn’t it? Made
so beautifully.

02:35:19.995 --> 02:35:24.332
How did you make it so well? Yogi:
All of the sahaja yogis did the frame…

02:35:24.533 --> 02:35:28.311
Shri Mataji: Hm?
Yogi And the...

02:35:33.097 --> 02:35:37.116
Shri Mataji: Beautiful, thank you.
So I’ll keep one.

02:35:39.572 --> 02:35:43.389
This is the Ganesha present for all of you.

02:36:02.366 --> 02:36:04.737
Now the Aarti is to be made.
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

02:36:04.938 --> 02:36:08.474
Shri Mataji: Already made it warm.

02:36:11.671 --> 02:36:14.489
These are endless, I think.
Yogi: Yes.

02:36:16.483 --> 02:36:18.683
Few will do!...

02:36:40.537 --> 02:36:43.066
What’s that?

02:36:59.942 --> 02:37:03.111
Yogi: Basilic for all the centers.
Shri Mataji: Baltus?

02:37:03.343 --> 02:37:07.136
Yogi: Basilic, basil.
Shri Mataji: Oh, good!

02:37:07.337 --> 02:37:10.594
Other yogi: Tulsi.
Yogi: Tulsi, yes.

02:37:15.746 --> 02:37:18.309
Shri Mataji: Oh, this is too much.

02:37:19.152 --> 02:37:22.050
All right for the seeds.

02:37:23.574 --> 02:37:25.943
All right.
Pujari: This is betel leaves, Shri Mataji.

02:37:26.153 --> 02:37:29.653
Shri Mataji: Eh? Pujari: Comes from India.
It comes from India.

02:37:38.792 --> 02:37:42.444
Shri Mataji: The leaves – one should be
eating, is it?

02:37:45.259 --> 02:37:49.882
It’s too much. Guido: There are twenty
more, little more.

02:37:50.691 --> 02:37:55.888
Shri Mataji: Oh, I think you mix them up,
isn’t it? It’s too much.

02:37:59.607 --> 02:38:01.934
It’s all right.

02:38:03.079 --> 02:38:05.539
Get off.

02:38:26.725 --> 02:38:30.265
Better all of you go.
Yogi: All of you.

02:38:34.476 --> 02:38:39.723
Just (Hindi) - touch each other
is the best.

02:38:40.450 --> 02:38:46.084
That you can hold it separately, yes.
Yes.

02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:51.642
You know, you do it this way and this way.

02:38:51.843 --> 02:38:56.587
And when you take it down, three times.
Start.

02:38:58.718 --> 02:39:02.211
[Aarti]

02:45:36.298 --> 02:45:39.863
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

02:45:40.064 --> 02:45:45.199
Beautiful, everybody's beautiful.

02:45:46.376 --> 02:45:52.953
Christine? Take out this. Beautiful
vibrations. Beautiful, beautiful.

02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:56.419
Yogini: Thank you, Shri Mataji.

02:46:09.424 --> 02:46:14.810
Shri Mataji: There’s - give her a plate,
for Christine also.

02:46:16.860 --> 02:46:19.046
Beautiful.

02:46:25.761 --> 02:46:30.524
As they count their money, give it
to Gavin, I have to give it to Antonio.

02:46:30.725 --> 02:46:33.084
This one also.

02:47:06.344 --> 02:47:10.297
I think better is wash My feet,
is better. Pujari: Yes.

02:47:24.507 --> 02:47:28.142
Shri Mataji: This is other sweets I brought
for children.

02:47:30.313 --> 02:47:34.003
Put them in a - one big…

02:47:36.954 --> 02:47:43.485
Now. Please keep it here, please.
Put it on…

02:47:58.756 --> 02:48:04.330
Big and small. Children big and small.

02:48:14.734 --> 02:48:19.499
Wah wah, the heat!

02:48:21.239 --> 02:48:25.876
When the energy flows, too much heat
is always.

02:48:29.739 --> 02:48:34.996
It’s all right, in My – it’s in My purse.

02:48:40.083 --> 02:48:45.640
You have to use it, washing it.

02:48:46.936 --> 02:48:49.400
Oh!

02:48:50.336 --> 02:48:52.784
I’ve got...
Yogi: There is the true one from Belgium.

02:48:52.985 --> 02:48:59.571
Shri Mataji: Oh, you already bought it!
Oh, that’s very good.

02:49:00.177 --> 02:49:05.369
Thank you very much, thank you. I have
one in My purse, but it’s all right.

02:49:10.486 --> 02:49:15.554
Very good. It’s tremendous, eh?
Yogi: He is a specialist, Mother.

02:49:17.249 --> 02:49:19.884
I must say!

02:49:28.177 --> 02:49:33.210
Ah, what a nice one. From Belgium.

02:49:36.414 --> 02:49:40.502
You see? Thank you.

02:49:40.703 --> 02:49:45.762
High timing, high timing, Belgium!

02:49:48.038 --> 02:49:51.731
I want to give it to all of you.

02:49:57.724 --> 02:50:00.113
This is a cake.

02:50:00.757 --> 02:50:04.951
(To Christine) You washed all right,
cleaned out quite a lot.

02:50:09.991 --> 02:50:12.539
Thank you. Done? Or not? Still more?

02:50:12.745 --> 02:50:15.121
I don’t think. That’s all.

02:50:15.322 --> 02:50:20.885
It should be all… just wipe it.
One go the whole lot.

02:50:34.136 --> 02:50:38.365
Children have made it? Yogi: Yes, Shri
Mataji, and they have written on the thing,

02:50:38.566 --> 02:50:43.072
“May our heart be a cushion for Your Feet”.

02:51:03.736 --> 02:51:07.477
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. What an idea!

02:51:08.447 --> 02:51:09.957
It’s done? I think it’s all done.

02:51:10.158 --> 02:51:11.938
Pujari: We wonder should we give
water for the centers?

02:51:12.139 --> 02:51:14.617
Shri Mataji: Eh? Pujari: Should we give
water for the centers?

02:51:14.818 --> 02:51:17.092
Shri Mataji: Eh? Water? Pujari: We keep
that water for the centers?

02:51:17.293 --> 02:51:22.115
Shri Mataji: Yes, some water is to be…
Yogi: This is tulsi leaves, basilic,

02:51:22.316 --> 02:51:25.508
and there is one basket per country.
When – one basket.

02:51:25.709 --> 02:51:27.878
Shri Mataji: Yes.

02:51:47.889 --> 02:51:50.532
Are you going to distribute to everyone?
Yogi: Pardon?

02:51:50.733 --> 02:51:53.702
Shri Mataji: They can come this way and
you can pass on when they are going out.

02:51:53.903 --> 02:51:56.529
Would be better.

02:51:56.730 --> 02:51:59.932
I would suggest that when they are
going out, you can give them one each,

02:52:00.133 --> 02:52:01.694
will be easier.
Yogi: We'll do.

02:52:01.895 --> 02:52:06.251
Shri Mataji: Otherwise, everybody coming
will be too much time.

02:52:13.934 --> 02:52:16.384
What’s that?

02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:23.190
Yogi: Is a collective… Shri Mataji: What?
Yogi: … offering for…

02:52:23.391 --> 02:52:27.578
Shri Mataji: Collective offering, what is
that?

02:52:29.253 --> 02:52:34.067
Collective... like a big Krishna’s flute,
or what?

02:52:34.268 --> 02:52:37.644
Yogi (joking): A big sweet, a long sweet.

02:52:43.184 --> 02:52:49.187
Shri Mataji: [What] you’ve given Me?
Oh oh oh.

02:52:50.635 --> 02:52:56.199
That’s the limit, I tell you, really!
What a beauty.

02:52:56.400 --> 02:53:00.138
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Beautiful.

02:53:02.683 --> 02:53:04.758
This is the largest one I've ever had.

02:53:04.959 --> 02:53:09.740
Thank you very much, very great.
Beautiful, is such a beauty.

02:53:19.366 --> 02:53:22.431
Very beautiful.

02:53:22.632 --> 02:53:26.870
It’s Chinese, is it?
Yogi: Chinese style, yes, Shri Mataji.

02:53:27.071 --> 02:53:29.904
Shri Mataji: Very beautiful colours.

02:53:30.105 --> 02:53:33.813
All Krishna’s colours, beautiful,
beautiful.

02:53:34.014 --> 02:53:40.155
Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful.

02:53:40.410 --> 02:53:45.234
Yogi: For the new house, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: For the new house, all right.

02:53:45.435 --> 02:53:48.411
Ah! Who’s made this?

02:53:48.612 --> 02:53:51.866
Child: From all the children. Shri Mataji:
Who? Child: From all the children.

02:53:52.067 --> 02:53:54.752
Shri Mataji: All the children! Thank you
very much,

02:53:54.959 --> 02:53:57.982
and giving Me one child more, all right?
Thank you, thank you very,

02:53:58.183 --> 02:54:02.392
beautifully done it with hand. It's done
so well! Beautiful!

02:54:02.593 --> 02:54:05.495
Show them, show them.

02:54:20.238 --> 02:54:22.986
I think, you should put carefully to...

02:54:23.187 --> 02:54:27.177
I think, best is to give it to him.

02:54:27.378 --> 02:54:30.106
Yogi: Shri Mataji, many times You…

02:54:30.307 --> 02:54:34.347
Shri Mataji: I mean, everybody’s giving now
is it, it’s going to be too much!

02:54:34.548 --> 02:54:43.074
Yogi: Shri Mataji, many times You told us
that Lakshmi are our Shaktis,

02:54:43.291 --> 02:54:49.822
and this present is a collective work
of all the Lakshmi of France.

02:54:50.023 --> 02:54:53.478
Shri Mataji: Oh, wah!

02:54:57.540 --> 02:55:02.112
Thank you very much! What is it?

02:55:02.313 --> 02:55:05.918
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

02:55:06.119 --> 02:55:08.320
May God bless you all. Thank you.

02:55:08.521 --> 02:55:13.785
Yogi: I must say, Shri Mataji, each one of
them did a piece, did one of these works.

02:55:13.986 --> 02:55:19.710
Shri Mataji: I see. Yogi: And it was quite
funny when the whole thing was assembled…

02:55:19.911 --> 02:55:21.808
Shri Mataji: Yes.
Yogi: … they tried to find their one,

02:55:22.009 --> 02:55:30.348
they never found the one they’ve done, it
was absolutely mixed into the collective.

02:55:37.365 --> 02:55:43.401
Shri Mataji: Very beautiful. Excellent!
Yogi: And…

02:55:43.602 --> 02:55:51.763
Shri Mataji: Remarkable, beautiful. Very
beautiful, like the feathers of a peacock.

02:55:51.964 --> 02:55:54.387
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

02:55:54.588 --> 02:55:58.625
Thank you very much, thank you.
May God bless you. Thank you.

02:55:58.826 --> 02:56:02.775
What a design. What a design, beautiful.

02:56:02.997 --> 02:56:08.406
Is a Sahastrara design, in the Sahastrara
ego and superego like that.

02:56:10.282 --> 02:56:13.031
Yes.

02:56:14.486 --> 02:56:20.085
Beautiful. Thank you very much, thank you.

02:56:21.833 --> 02:56:24.599
First class.

02:56:32.671 --> 02:56:38.677
How much time they must have taken.

02:56:42.353 --> 02:56:46.167
Yogi: And when they started to work on it,
it was very pleasant to see, Shri Mataji:

02:56:46.368 --> 02:56:49.744
some Lakshmi, You know, who had been
fighting in the past, You know, with ego,

02:56:49.966 --> 02:56:53.818
and they were just discussing in a sweet
way, when they were sewing.

02:56:54.019 --> 02:56:55.888
It was absolutely wonderful!

02:56:56.089 --> 02:57:01.793
Shri Mataji: This is your leader’s trick

02:57:12.039 --> 02:57:15.663
to end up the problem.

02:57:19.877 --> 02:57:23.782
Should I tell them?
Yogi: Why not?

02:57:26.057 --> 02:57:30.893
Shri Mataji: Patrick tells Me that it was
very surprising that all of them

02:57:31.094 --> 02:57:35.455
used to quarrel among themselves and
used to be little differences.

02:57:35.673 --> 02:57:39.356
But when they started - yes.

02:57:43.163 --> 02:57:47.507
Little girl: For you, Shri Mataji!
Shri Mataji: Thank you!

02:57:50.792 --> 02:57:56.540
And when they started working… From whom
is this? From whom is this one?

02:57:56.741 --> 02:58:00.569
Yogini: From Alsace. Yogis: From Alsace.
Thait's right. From the East of France.

02:58:00.792 --> 02:58:03.271
Shri Mataji: Oh, thank you, thank you.
Yogi: Strasbourg and Nantes.

02:58:03.472 --> 02:58:10.518
Shri Mataji: So, then he, he said that
they started working on the pattern

02:58:10.719 --> 02:58:14.616
and the making of the quilt,  and they were
very friendly

02:58:14.817 --> 02:58:20.008
and were delicately doing it, and very
sweetly talking to each other

02:58:20.209 --> 02:58:25.573
and he was amazed. So I said:
“This is their leader’s trick!”

02:58:38.482 --> 02:58:41.715
Trick of the leader.

02:58:45.114 --> 02:58:50.841
Always a leader should never discuss
the problems of the followers:

02:58:51.042 --> 02:58:54.349
but give them problems!

02:59:05.109 --> 02:59:08.697
For example, if the children are fighting,
so you tell them,

02:59:08.906 --> 02:59:15.883
“We have to go for picnic, next year.
Can you plan it now?”

02:59:23.124 --> 02:59:28.300
Yogi: All right, Michel, will you take care
of it? I said, "Yes, Michel..."

02:59:28.501 --> 02:59:34.490
Yes, that’s it. That’s how it works,
that’s the leadership.

02:59:36.111 --> 02:59:39.489
Oh, oh, oh, oh, beautiful.

02:59:41.626 --> 02:59:47.839
What a beauty, I tell you. Very beautiful
it is.

02:59:50.380 --> 02:59:53.038
Very sweet.

02:59:56.440 --> 02:59:58.745
Very beautiful. Thank you very much!

02:59:58.946 --> 03:00:02.111
You must put the name here, whosoever has
given. Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

03:00:02.312 --> 03:00:06.632
Shri Mataji: Should be the name always
with that, you see, so that I know.

03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:19.035
This is from? Yogis: Marseille.
Yogi: Marseille.

03:00:19.236 --> 03:00:24.602
Shri Mataji: Oh I see, thank you very much,
thank you.

03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:33.271
Marseille.

03:00:35.638 --> 03:00:38.455
Beautiful.

03:00:42.835 --> 03:00:50.154
Have you got Prasad or not? All the leaders
haven’t got any Prasad! Yogis: No.

03:00:50.672 --> 03:00:53.735
Shri Mataji: Poor. Yogi: They are already
getting problems, Shri Mataji!

03:01:08.911 --> 03:01:12.426
Shri Mataji: Oh, why it won’t work out?

03:01:13.933 --> 03:01:17.561
Beautiful!
Yogi: It is Notre Dame de belle Garde...

03:01:17.762 --> 03:01:21.550
Yogi 2: De la Garde. Yogi: ...de la Garde -
the virgin which is at the top,

03:01:21.751 --> 03:01:24.493
which is dominating on Marseille,
the cathedral of Marseille.

03:01:24.704 --> 03:01:27.207
Shri Mataji: I see. Yogi: And there is
absolutely nice vibrations

03:01:27.408 --> 03:01:30.065
when we are in Marseille… Shri Mataji:
Beautiful, this one is such a beautiful one.

03:01:30.266 --> 03:01:32.808
Very beautiful.

03:01:34.980 --> 03:01:37.956
Thank you very much!

03:01:46.378 --> 03:01:49.818
Jyst hand it over to - I think

03:01:50.375 --> 03:01:53.432
Dr. Spiro should keep all these things,
look at these things. Yogi: Yes.

03:01:53.665 --> 03:01:57.296
Shri Mataji: Thank you. It was a wonderful
thing.

03:01:57.511 --> 03:02:01.439
Yogi: (In French) Any other presents
from Provence?

03:02:04.941 --> 03:02:08.878
Montpellier.
Shri Mataji: (Hindi)

03:02:10.986 --> 03:02:19.022
Oh oh oh. Shukriya. (Hindi)  Thank you,
it's beautiful, very.

03:02:23.379 --> 03:02:26.792
Other yogi: This is a present from
Montpellier. Shri Mataji: From Montpellier.

03:02:26.993 --> 03:02:30.593
Oh, beautiful!
Yogi: Table set, table set.

03:02:31.332 --> 03:02:34.158
Shri Mataji: Tell them.

03:02:35.986 --> 03:02:38.627
Beautiful, see.
Yogi: The tissue is from Provence.

03:02:38.828 --> 03:02:41.676
Another yogi: It’s a traditional design.
Shri Mataji: Is a traditional design,

03:02:41.877 --> 03:02:46.486
from Montpellier. Beautiful. Oh, very
beautiful.

03:02:46.687 --> 03:02:51.908
Thank you very much. You see, all they too
traditionally following our patterns,

03:02:52.116 --> 03:02:55.222
isn’t it? Just open it.

03:02:55.423 --> 03:02:59.910
(The translator explains that the patterns
of Provence resemble those of Kashmir

03:03:00.111 --> 03:03:04.832
and have some small Kundalinis)
Shri Mataji: Same, same designs.

03:03:07.114 --> 03:03:11.278
Thank you very much, thank you, beautiful,
thank you.

03:03:17.491 --> 03:03:23.004
There’s no - beautiful. How many centers
you have?

03:03:23.205 --> 03:03:25.944
Yogi: Let’s start: in the center of France
there is Paris... Shri Mataji: Ah.

03:03:26.145 --> 03:03:31.186
Yogi: ...and all the other centers are
at the border: Rouen, Reims, Nantes,

03:03:31.386 --> 03:03:37.921
Montpellier, Marseille, Lyon, Mulhouse,
Strasbourg, and Nîmes.

03:03:38.130 --> 03:03:40.296
Shri Mataji: From Strasbourg she’s not
come? Yogini: Yes.

03:03:40.497 --> 03:03:44.410
Shri Mataji: She’s here, Ruth? Yogi: Ruth
is no more in Strasbourg. She is in Bern.

03:03:44.611 --> 03:03:47.640
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Oh wah!

03:03:47.841 --> 03:03:54.574
This is for Germany! Good idea.
Beautiful!

03:03:56.762 --> 03:04:03.686
It’s very beautiful. Really, beautiful.
May God bless you.

03:04:03.887 --> 03:04:06.895
All right. Such a nice one, just have
a look.

03:04:07.096 --> 03:04:12.767
Just show them – it’s quite heavy though –
show them. Is the Mother.

03:04:13.859 --> 03:04:17.645
German yogi: And this one is the collective
present for all the nations from Germany.

03:04:17.846 --> 03:04:20.005
Shri Mataji: From all the?
German yogi: Sorry?

03:04:20.206 --> 03:04:22.955
It’s the present from Germany for all
the different countries.

03:04:23.156 --> 03:04:29.219
And we will distribute to every national
leader a poster like this after the puja.

03:04:29.420 --> 03:04:33.734
It’s from the Indian tour.
Shri Mataji: Oh!

03:04:43.606 --> 03:04:46.955
Yogi from the public (shouts jokingly):
On the bus!

03:04:51.001 --> 03:04:53.987
Shri Mataji: This is for Me? German yogi:
Sorry? Shri Mataji: This is for Me?

03:04:54.195 --> 03:04:56.917
German yogi: Yes, this is for You.
Shri Mataji: All right, thank you very much.

03:04:57.118 --> 03:05:05.496
Beautiful. Is a very nice one. All of you
there, I can see them at a glance.

03:05:09.673 --> 03:05:11.847
Yogi: Embroideries from the children.
Shri Mataji: From where?

03:05:12.048 --> 03:05:15.255
Yogi: From the children of the camp, of the
holiday camp. Shri Mataji: Oh, how sweet.

03:05:15.456 --> 03:05:19.205
Thank you very much, thank you.

03:05:30.927 --> 03:05:33.340
Oh, I’ll have to put them
in the exhibition,

03:05:33.541 --> 03:05:37.827
but you must – you have not signed
your names!

03:05:38.740 --> 03:05:41.608
Yogi: It’s collective, Shri Mataji!
Shri Mataji: All right. Thank you.

03:05:41.809 --> 03:05:46.153
In the collective they don’t write names,
that’s true.

03:05:47.942 --> 03:05:52.690
Thank you very much. Yogi: They’ve done it
during the camp, Shri Mataji.

03:05:52.891 --> 03:05:55.267
Shri Mataji: What’s that?
Boy: From Switzerland.

03:05:55.468 --> 03:05:58.593
Shri Mataji: From where?
Boy: Switzerland.

03:05:58.794 --> 03:06:04.101
Shri Mataji: Oh, thank you. Now, everybody
need not give. See?

03:06:04.302 --> 03:06:10.919
First of all French centers, then all the
other centers, it’s going to be too much.

03:06:12.736 --> 03:06:18.385
You see, this is what (unclear)?
Gregoire: It comes from France, Shri Mataji!

03:06:18.586 --> 03:06:22.127
Shri Mataji: Comes from France!
Gregoire: Yes, it's French!

03:06:22.328 --> 03:06:26.664
(A yogi says in French that it is a Swiss
gift bought in France.

03:06:26.865 --> 03:06:29.565
Then somebody replies that it is a French
gift bought in Switzerland)

03:06:29.765 --> 03:06:33.513
Shri Mataji: No no no, cannot be, this
cannot be, this is Swiss!

03:06:33.721 --> 03:06:37.541
Yogi: This is Saint Louis crystal - crystal
from Saint Louis.

03:06:37.742 --> 03:06:41.491
And maybe the watch is Swiss.
Shri Mataji: Oh, combination.

03:06:41.692 --> 03:06:43.280
Yogi: That’s a good combination,
Shri Mataji!

03:06:43.481 --> 03:06:47.165
Shri Mataji: So beautiful, but I mean,
every time Swiss people need not

03:06:47.366 --> 03:06:49.966
give Me presents.

03:06:50.167 --> 03:06:55.001
Thank you very much, it’s beautiful,
I needed one, very much,

03:06:55.202 --> 03:06:59.515
I really needed one. What’s that?

03:06:59.775 --> 03:07:01.985
Yogi: It’s for Your bed, Mother.
Shri Mataji: For My bed!

03:07:02.186 --> 03:07:06.046
Yogi: This is our gratefulness for all
Your blessings, Shri Mataji.

03:07:06.374 --> 03:07:09.695
Shri Mataji: Ah, now, how is the house
coming up?

03:07:09.896 --> 03:07:13.846
Well?
Yogi: This is it, Mother.

03:07:14.047 --> 03:07:18.290
Ah ah ah! Oh, beautiful!

03:07:19.825 --> 03:07:26.709
Really? So kind of you! That’s the ashram!
Oh beautiful!

03:07:29.096 --> 03:07:34.829
Oh! Done so well, I must say!

03:07:35.540 --> 03:07:40.147
Beautiful, beautiful, what an ashram!

03:07:40.363 --> 03:07:44.561
I may settle down in Switzerland!

03:07:47.926 --> 03:07:52.150
Yogi: Shri Mataji, may this house stay
in your house,

03:07:52.359 --> 03:07:54.870
so that we get the protection of You
all the time.

03:07:55.071 --> 03:07:58.634
Shri Mataji: All right, thank you
very much.

03:08:09.323 --> 03:08:16.238
Beautiful, eh? How far is it now?
Started?

03:08:16.439 --> 03:08:19.634
Yogi: The floor’s basement is done already.
Shri Mataji: Oh oh!

03:08:19.835 --> 03:08:21.366
Other yogi: The concrete is put,
Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: Good, good.

03:08:21.567 --> 03:08:23.614
Yogi: It’s going to be finished this week.

03:08:23.815 --> 03:08:26.300
...are going to come on the seventh
of September.

03:08:26.501 --> 03:08:28.516
Shri Mataji: Oh, I... Yogi: So when You
come to Switzerland, Shri Mataji,

03:08:28.717 --> 03:08:31.058
we’ll show You already the house half –
half finished.

03:08:31.259 --> 03:08:35.225
Shri Mataji: Good. [Yogi: Yes] You see,
what a miracle:

03:08:35.426 --> 03:08:39.882
this one we planned in five minutes,
didn’t we? Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

03:08:40.298 --> 03:08:45.315
Shri Mataji: Better show Mister Shrivastava
[to] see how I planned it.

03:08:45.516 --> 03:08:50.049
They were all struggling with planning,
planning, planning:

03:08:51.543 --> 03:08:54.920
and really, in really five minutes.
Yogi: I’m sorry, Mother…

03:08:55.121 --> 03:09:01.901
Shri Mataji: Eh? No, no it’s all right,
see, everybody had to learn through that.

03:09:06.657 --> 03:09:12.035
What’s that? Now. Guido: Some presents
from Italy. Shri Mataji: Why, from Italy?

03:09:12.236 --> 03:09:19.238
I’ve not been to Italy so far, so much,
you see, it’s too much for Me.

03:09:27.349 --> 03:09:31.620
I don’t want to break it, it’s so nicely
done.

03:09:48.152 --> 03:09:49.898
That’s too much.
Guido: No, no, no.

03:09:50.099 --> 03:09:53.567
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, what, it’s too
much. It’s too much, just see, imagine.

03:09:53.775 --> 03:09:58.582
Just imagine, this is too much. How could
you give such a lot to Me?

03:09:58.783 --> 03:10:01.663
See this.

03:10:02.847 --> 03:10:06.890
It’s too much. Oh God.

03:10:07.821 --> 03:10:11.293
Are diamonds? These are diamonds?
Guido: Yes, yes, Shri Mataji.

03:10:11.494 --> 03:10:15.282
Shri Mataji: Oh God, I mean, I just
imagine, this is too much.

03:10:15.483 --> 03:10:19.077
Can you do that? Oh God.

03:10:19.342 --> 03:10:22.842
But you need money for your ashram!

03:10:23.043 --> 03:10:27.220
No, it’s too much, I mean, it’s too much
really.

03:10:27.450 --> 03:10:30.533
Yogi: Mother, he needs the blessings
of Lakshmi for his ashram!

03:10:30.734 --> 03:10:35.412
You need, definitely you need, isn’t it?

03:10:35.978 --> 03:10:40.363
Guido: We had to thank (?) the great
Architect, who planned the ashram.

03:10:40.588 --> 03:10:44.532
Shri Mataji: Ah, this is for architectural
work!

03:10:46.570 --> 03:10:50.803
Everybody - everybody asked Me, “Why did
You change the plans?”

03:10:51.004 --> 03:10:55.624
So then I had to admit, I said:
“I’m the best Planner”.

03:10:55.825 --> 03:10:58.906
Thank you very much, thank you,
it’s beautiful, it’s too much.

03:10:59.107 --> 03:11:03.322
Guido: This is for France.
Shri Mataji: Ah! This is the gratitude.

03:11:03.531 --> 03:11:07.987
Guido: This was taken the night You were
talking about the Atma and Jivatma,

03:11:08.195 --> 03:11:12.581
and the seven chakras are there, and just
the Void is…

03:11:12.782 --> 03:11:14.192
Shri Mataji: Really, from where do they
come in?

03:11:14.393 --> 03:11:16.248
Guido: standing in the water element.
From Volterra.

03:11:16.449 --> 03:11:22.113
Shri Mataji: Eh God, just imagine! Let Me
have a pair - just now from there.

03:11:22.314 --> 03:11:26.083
Guido: You were talking about koshas and -
Atma and Jivatma.

03:11:26.284 --> 03:11:30.598
Shri Mataji: Can you imagine such a thing?
Who did that?

03:11:30.799 --> 03:11:34.172
Guido: It’s Parvati.

03:11:37.433 --> 03:11:42.618
Shri Mataji: But I’m surprised, yes!
Just imagine!

03:11:42.834 --> 03:11:49.923
Guido: All seven then. With the Gods,
the petals, from Mooladhara.

03:11:50.494 --> 03:11:52.028
Shri Mataji: Can you imagine!

03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:54.905
Guido: And You were talking about this
glass, saying that we have to become…

03:11:55.106 --> 03:11:59.915
Shri Mataji: And this is like a…
Guido: … pure, to reflect the Atma.

03:12:01.499 --> 03:12:07.589
Shri Mataji: I didn’t have anything
in My hand! Haven’t. Nothing.

03:12:10.279 --> 03:12:16.099
That’s like a Kundalini, is like.
Cannot be My bangles, were here.

03:12:16.300 --> 03:12:19.279
Guido: No, no, no, Shri Mataji, just You
were talking about this glass,

03:12:19.480 --> 03:12:26.092
and how we have to be like this water
to reflect Atma.

03:12:26.293 --> 03:12:30.045
Shri Mataji: Yes, I tell you. Really!
Can’t believe it!

03:12:30.246 --> 03:12:34.896
Show this one, this is a remarkable
photograph, I must say.

03:12:35.534 --> 03:12:39.261
No no, just tell them, what you said.

03:12:40.269 --> 03:12:43.875
Seven chakras on My hand.

03:12:44.464 --> 03:12:50.264
There are seven chakras on My hand,
showing.

03:12:50.465 --> 03:12:56.119
Guido: Exactly at that time, Shri Mataji
was talking about Atma and Jivatma.

03:12:56.320 --> 03:13:01.395
And She was saying that we, the Sahaja
Yogis, have to be pure and transparent

03:13:01.596 --> 03:13:04.552
like that glass to reflect the Atma.

03:13:04.753 --> 03:13:13.685
And all the seven chakras are showing then,
in this picture, through the glass.

03:13:29.930 --> 03:13:34.585
Shri Mataji: What is this? Oh.

03:13:34.856 --> 03:13:37.465
Yogi: ...from Sudan.

03:13:37.666 --> 03:13:40.511
Shri Mataji: Sudan? Yogi: Yes, I've been
in Sudan for six years.

03:13:40.712 --> 03:13:43.005
Shri Mataji: I know. [Yogi: Yes.] Have you
finished with Sudan?

03:13:43.206 --> 03:13:46.709
Yogi: Yes, I’ve finished with Sudan, so now
I’m going to Madagascar.

03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:49.632
And I need Your blessings, Mother,
to go to Madagascar.

03:13:49.833 --> 03:13:52.985
Shri Mataji: May God bless you. May God
bless you. I’ll be seeing you in Madras.

03:13:53.186 --> 03:13:55.844
Beg your pardon?

03:13:56.147 --> 03:14:01.079
[Yogi: says something indistinct]
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Beautiful.

03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:04.362
May God bless you. Hope to see you
in Madras.

03:14:04.563 --> 03:14:09.900
I’m going to Madras for a programme.
Do you know the address of Mr. Murthy?

03:14:10.101 --> 03:14:12.354
Yogi: I can find out, Mother. Shri Mataji:
Eh? Yogi: I can find out.

03:14:12.555 --> 03:14:16.706
Shri Mataji: Find out. (Hindi)

03:14:19.293 --> 03:14:22.595
This is from Sudan he's brought it for Me.
Beautiful piece.

03:14:22.810 --> 03:14:25.280
And this is a perfume from his wife.

03:14:25.542 --> 03:14:30.139
Yogi: Mother, a little present from Spain.
Shri Mataji: Ah, ah, beautiful!

03:14:30.348 --> 03:14:36.761
Very beautiful, very, very. Thank you very
much. From Spain. Beautiful.

03:14:36.962 --> 03:14:39.200
Thank you.

03:14:53.336 --> 03:14:56.700
Yes. Have you given something
to Mr. Shrivastava?

03:14:56.908 --> 03:15:00.116
Yogi: Yes, we did.
Shri Mataji: To eat?

03:15:05.849 --> 03:15:09.788
Look at these angels. What have you got?

03:15:09.989 --> 03:15:13.629
Ah, from all the children?
Girls: Yes.

03:15:13.830 --> 03:15:15.958
Shri Mataji: Children from where?
Girls: From Italy.

03:15:16.159 --> 03:15:18.826
Shri Mataji: Eh? Girls: From Italy.
Shri Mataji: From Italy!

03:15:19.027 --> 03:15:22.765
Thank you very much, thank you.

03:15:33.098 --> 03:15:37.646
Ah, look at that! Show them.

03:15:37.847 --> 03:15:44.405
This is from the school, look at that,
how beautiful they are!

03:15:58.988 --> 03:16:04.115
Yes, keep it carefully. Thank you.
This can go with the English, yes.

03:16:04.362 --> 03:16:07.074
What this one is?

03:16:21.425 --> 03:16:23.520
Sorry.

03:16:31.825 --> 03:16:39.228
Ah, beautiful! The day of Raksha Bandhan,
from children!

03:16:56.104 --> 03:16:59.716
You must see this one: “Uncle Guido
and uncle Leo

03:16:59.917 --> 03:17:04.298
giving the garland to Shri Mataji”.
This is the best part.

03:17:15.967 --> 03:17:17.920
Oh, thank you very much.

03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:21.485
Yogi: Uncle Guido and uncle Leo giving
the garland to Shri Mataji.

03:17:21.686 --> 03:17:24.802
It was the legend of the joint. Shri Mataji:
Beautiful, I mean, the idea is good,

03:17:25.003 --> 03:17:30.581
they have just put a photo in a line, like
that, this expression is very strong.

03:17:33.082 --> 03:17:35.577
What’s that?
Yogini: Shri Mataji, this is from America.

03:17:35.778 --> 03:17:38.815
Shri Mataji: From America. Oh!

03:17:43.718 --> 03:17:46.702
What is that?

03:17:46.999 --> 03:17:50.149
Yogi: It’s a vase. Yogi 2: It’s a vase.
Shri Mataji: It’s a vase!

03:17:55.246 --> 03:18:02.857
Yogini: It's a white horse. Shri Mataji:
Ah, beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.

03:18:03.830 --> 03:18:08.222
It’s a very humble white horse.

03:18:10.156 --> 03:18:14.450
Beautiful. Thank you very much, thank you.

03:18:18.022 --> 03:18:22.593
Yogi: This is, these are photographs from
the holiday camp of the French children.

03:18:22.820 --> 03:18:26.297
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Thank you very
much.

03:18:29.152 --> 03:18:33.393
But I can see, I can see, I was trying
to just…

03:18:39.981 --> 03:18:44.524
Ah, very nice, it’s beautiful. Where did
they have it?

03:18:44.725 --> 03:18:48.807
Yogi: In Nantes. In a farm in Brittany.
Shri Mataji: Aha. Yogi: Nearby Nantes.

03:18:49.037 --> 03:18:52.763
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful. Yes.

03:18:53.334 --> 03:18:59.330
Oh, thank you very much, thank you.
Very good idea.

03:19:00.177 --> 03:19:03.702
Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is the first issue
of the German ... speaking

03:19:03.911 --> 03:19:07.319
Sahaja Yoga magazine, with all Your
puja speeches.

03:19:07.549 --> 03:19:11.373
Shri Mataji: Ah. Yogi: … with Your
blessings. Shri Mataji: From where?

03:19:11.574 --> 03:19:16.865
Yogi: From German-speaking countries,
Germany and Austria, Switzerland.

03:19:29.778 --> 03:19:33.083
Shri Mataji: This is in German language.
Yogi: In German language, yes.

03:19:33.284 --> 03:19:36.203
Other yogi: But it’s done in Austria.

03:19:38.542 --> 03:19:42.171
Shri Mataji: Austrians are Germans,
aren’t they?

03:19:43.602 --> 03:19:45.493
You are Austrians. Other yogi
as above: The Germans are Austrians!

03:19:45.694 --> 03:19:48.686
Shri Mataji: That’s correct.

03:19:56.518 --> 03:20:05.801
Yes, you see, because, you know, you had
a Queen who ruled there,

03:20:06.002 --> 03:20:10.959
your Queen ruled in Germany; it was one
country, Prussia, isn’t it? Yes.

03:20:11.160 --> 03:20:15.528
So it was one country; so we can say
all of them are Prussians.

03:20:15.729 --> 03:20:20.382
Pr is good, pr means ‘enlightened’.

03:20:20.583 --> 03:20:24.941
Pr-ussians, Prussians is a good idea.

03:20:27.610 --> 03:20:30.400
Thank you, thank you very much,
beautiful idea.

03:20:30.638 --> 03:20:34.553
I’ll see this. This should be…
is a good idea.

03:20:37.426 --> 03:20:42.006
Now, I hope – still? Wah wah wah.

03:20:42.667 --> 03:20:45.770
Yogi 1: Next ashram? Amsterdam ashram?
Yogi 2: Vermeer.

03:20:45.971 --> 03:20:50.609
Yogi: No, painting from Vermeer.
Shri Mataji: Painting?

03:20:50.810 --> 03:20:54.691
Yogi: Yes, it's a reproduction of a very
famous painting.

03:20:54.892 --> 03:20:57.786
Shri Mataji: What’s the name?
Yogi: Vermeer. Shri Mataji: Vermeer.

03:20:57.987 --> 03:21:01.183
Yogi: Same painter as we gave to You
in the last Puja. It’s the “Coronation”.

03:21:01.384 --> 03:21:05.020
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, yes. Yogi: Together.
Shri Mataji: Ah. That's good.

03:21:05.221 --> 03:21:08.935
Just now everything is in Shudy Camps,
so we’ll see.

03:21:09.136 --> 03:21:12.248
Beautiful. How detailed working,
I must say.

03:21:12.449 --> 03:21:14.755
You see, these days the artists are
all lazy lumps,

03:21:14.956 --> 03:21:19.710
they’ll just put a line and say it is art.
Look at this (side?).

03:21:19.911 --> 03:21:22.585
Let them have a look, beautiful.

03:21:23.719 --> 03:21:27.598
Yogi: Shri Mataji, this (on the painting)
is the ashram in Amsterdam.

03:21:27.883 --> 03:21:30.318
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?
Yogi: This is the ashram in Amsterdam.

03:21:30.519 --> 03:21:36.572
This is the ashram in Amsterdam…
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. Yes. You can…

03:21:36.773 --> 03:21:42.704
Other yogi: Shri Mataji, this is a small
present from Swiss for people to France.

03:21:43.092 --> 03:21:46.496
Shri Mataji: Ah. Thank you.

03:21:49.893 --> 03:21:51.919
You brought the presents I gave you
to show them?

03:21:52.120 --> 03:21:56.262
We should have brought the presents, to
show them, that I gave you, both of you.

03:21:56.487 --> 03:21:58.633
Yogi: Oh, yes... Shri Mataji: The leaders.
You have got it? Yogi: No.

03:21:58.834 --> 03:22:01.221
Shri Mataji: No? All right.

03:22:01.882 --> 03:22:05.685
Yes, we could show them later on.

03:22:13.204 --> 03:22:18.571
Gavin, you must be tired now. You can
give it to somebody else.

03:22:24.534 --> 03:22:27.781
Yogi (joking): So hot vibrations…

03:22:32.606 --> 03:22:35.551
Shri Mataji: Could be…

03:22:37.896 --> 03:22:40.707
This is true!

03:22:54.224 --> 03:23:00.689
This is for fanning Me, sir. You have
to fan Me, that’s why.

03:23:05.742 --> 03:23:11.478
Ah, beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you.

03:23:11.733 --> 03:23:16.086
The right time, right thing. Right time,
right thing.

03:23:16.444 --> 03:23:23.812
Right time, right thing. Very spontaneous.
Yes.

03:23:25.710 --> 03:23:30.769
Beautiful. Because you had no fan,
so they brought one.

03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:34.404
(The yogi translator mixes up the word “fan”
in French so that that it sounds like:

03:23:34.612 --> 03:23:41.077
“We had no elephant for the puja and
now we have” – everybody laughs)

03:23:41.450 --> 03:23:44.323
Yogi translator: Fan.

03:23:45.198 --> 03:23:50.622
Shri Mataji: What’s he telling? Yogi: He
said, “They had no elephant for the puja…”

03:23:50.902 --> 03:23:54.220
Shri Mataji: All right, take it.

03:24:04.735 --> 03:24:09.419
Yogi: As Guido asked: “Do you feel
the cool breeze now, of our Mother?

03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:12.012
Shri Mataji: I know, when I’m perspiring,
you are feeling cool breeze,

03:24:12.213 --> 03:24:15.403
of that I’m very sure.

03:24:20.268 --> 03:24:23.498
Yes, what is that now?

03:24:24.501 --> 03:24:26.733
Yogi: A present from Belgium for the French
people.

03:24:26.934 --> 03:24:35.258
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s beautiful!
Yogi: Easter puja in Rome.

03:24:35.459 --> 03:24:37.942
Shri Mataji: This one is?
Yogi: Easter puja in Rome.

03:24:38.143 --> 03:24:41.709
Yogi 2: Easter puja in Rome.

03:24:42.013 --> 03:24:45.347
Shri Mataji: Easter? Belgium puja?
Yogi: No, Easter puja in Roma.

03:24:45.548 --> 03:24:48.540
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.
Yogi: In Italy.

03:24:48.978 --> 03:24:51.726
Shri Mataji: This side.

03:25:02.716 --> 03:25:05.297
Beautiful.

03:25:07.240 --> 03:25:12.912
Very beautiful. Very beautiful it is,
really.

03:25:13.231 --> 03:25:16.250
Really, very beautiful photograph.

03:25:17.300 --> 03:25:21.580
Very symmetrical, beautiful, beautiful.

03:25:21.781 --> 03:25:25.498
This last – this time when we had puja?
This, in Easter?

03:25:25.699 --> 03:25:28.857
Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Ah. Really?

03:25:43.677 --> 03:25:47.566
Beautiful, very beautiful.

03:25:48.458 --> 03:25:52.714
Yogi: Havan in Alpe Motta. The havan
in Alpe Motta.

03:25:52.915 --> 03:25:56.625
Yogi: Of the havan of this year
on Sahastrara Day, in Alpe Motta.

03:25:56.826 --> 03:26:00.247
Shri Mataji: In? Yogi: Alpe Motta.
Yogi 2: In Italy. Shri Mataji: In Italy.

03:26:00.448 --> 03:26:03.754
Yogi 2: It’s a Havana, yes, during
the Sahastrara Day seminar in Italy.

03:26:03.955 --> 03:26:06.301
Shri Mataji: Ah.

03:26:16.108 --> 03:26:19.394
Beautiful! And what is that?

03:26:23.766 --> 03:26:28.453
Beautiful it is, isn’t it? What dimensions
they have taken.

03:26:28.654 --> 03:26:34.170
All the deities are sitting here, and
blessing them.

03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:38.160
May God bless you. Beautiful.

03:26:40.101 --> 03:26:47.121
Yes. Arneau: Shri Mataji, just would like
to show You the poster we put in Geneva…

03:26:47.322 --> 03:26:53.287
… of Geneva for the exhibition.
And it was very nice.

03:26:55.680 --> 03:27:00.017
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful! Arneau: It’s
huge! It’s bigger than any other exhibition.

03:27:00.218 --> 03:27:03.249
Shri Mataji: Ah? Arneau: It’s bigger than
any other exhibition...

03:27:03.450 --> 03:27:05.902
Shri Mataji: But they want to have
a objection to Shri Ganesh!

03:27:06.103 --> 03:27:09.143
Arneau: I mean, no Shri Mataji, absolutely
not. On the contrary,

03:27:09.344 --> 03:27:13.713
people at the place of the exhibition, they
congratulated us for the posters.

03:27:13.914 --> 03:27:16.649
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. That’s good that.
Arneau: It’s quite unusual in Geneva,

03:27:16.850 --> 03:27:20.728
I must say, but there’s a lot of France,
Shri Mataji.

03:27:22.750 --> 03:27:28.659
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. It’s very nice.
Beautiful.

03:27:29.645 --> 03:27:33.870
Very remarkable. Very balanced.

03:27:34.149 --> 03:27:37.229
The yogi translator explains: The deities
in the history of spiritual evolution –

03:27:37.430 --> 03:27:40.458
exhibition by Sahaja Yoga.
Shri Mataji: Who has drawn that?

03:27:40.659 --> 03:27:44.447
Arneau: This is Pascal, and Richard and
Christian, there were three of them.

03:27:44.648 --> 03:27:47.981
Shri Mataji: Very nice. It’s beautiful.
Really.

03:27:50.604 --> 03:27:55.979
Now, I hope the list is over, and I…

03:28:08.481 --> 03:28:12.044
Yogi: What would you like to do,
Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: I’ll go home,

03:28:12.245 --> 03:28:16.351
but the food is brought here. We’ll -
can eat it there. Yogi: We can,

03:28:16.552 --> 03:28:18.800
there is a point to eat for You and Mr C.P.
if You want, [Shri Mataji: Eh?]

03:28:19.001 --> 03:28:22.011
or we’ll go to the hotel. Shri Mataji: He
would like to have it there I know.

03:28:22.212 --> 03:28:26.399
Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: So we’ll go back,
let us, so the food can go with us,

03:28:26.600 --> 03:28:28.653
they can heat it and give it to us there.

03:28:28.854 --> 03:28:31.430
Yogi: Yes, good. Shri Mataji: All right.
Would be better.

03:28:31.631 --> 03:28:36.339
Shri Mataji: But I also, you know – puja
means My situation is bad.

03:28:36.540 --> 03:28:38.889
May God bless you.

03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:56.561
There’s a sweater also.

03:28:59.161 --> 03:29:02.091
The sari, sort of - lots of things.

03:29:24.269 --> 03:29:26.813
May God bless you.

03:29:27.014 --> 03:29:29.240
Don’t go in the sun now.

03:29:29.441 --> 03:29:32.750
Today it’s horrible, I mean, one should not
go in the sun.

03:29:36.647 --> 03:29:41.052
It was good, very good.

03:29:43.548 --> 03:29:46.478
(Aside to a Yogini) Christine, you’ll have
to help Me out.

03:29:47.282 --> 03:29:54.261
I can’t, it’s too much. I’m just shaking.
Can you help Me out?

03:29:54.462 --> 03:29:57.756
Yogi: Can you move?

03:30:06.303 --> 03:30:08.319
Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

03:30:11.381 --> 03:30:16.603
You need many soldiers to do puja.

03:30:17.632 --> 03:30:20.062
May God bless you.

03:30:23.194 --> 03:30:26.830
Thank you for all the presents! Thank you.
