00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:09.550
Now I have been already with your fiancés
and I talked to them.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.740
I have praised you a lot.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.640
Now first thing we have to know that this
marriage ceremony that we have organised with

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.680
a purpose.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.130
The first purpose is that regard marriage
is very essential for Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.500
If somebody doesn’t want to marry, we say
alright you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.540
It’s alright.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:47.150
Now why marriage is important, because a marriage
is like a big Yagnya, it’s like a big Tapasya,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.010
you can call it, or it’s a great experience.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.500
How to achieve balance, how to become a witness
and how to become a spirit.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500
It’s very important.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:11.750
Now the first and foremost thing we have to
know (is) that he is your husband and nobody

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.380
else is your husband.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.990
Nobody is more important than he is.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.190
See men are very easy to be controlled.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.860
If you can make them feel they are the most
important people for you, then you can manage

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.160
them very well.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.409
But the first foremost ambition should be
or the idea should be that I will make my

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.900
married life extremely happy.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.200
Because if the married life is happy you will
be happy.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.760
Now men have a habit of sometimes losing temper.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.689
Doesn’t matter that’s their habit.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.159
So you shouldn’t immediately become the
same type.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:02:05.439
But you can little bit in a womanly way try
to put your sweet device of smiling it or

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.849
laughing it out or little bit [showing you
nice?] somehow.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.870
But not to make it serious.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.319
It’s very important.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.700
So how to handle the men.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.530
Especially your husbands is an art and that
art you will achieve gradually when you start

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.590
seeing.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.180
But if you start finding faults with the men
and start saying you can’t do this, you

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.689
can’t do this, you don’t know how to drive
or how to do this, or this things.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.489
Then you are finished.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.489
You must say you are the best driver.

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.590
You are the best.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.984
That’s the way you have to deal with him.

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:44.984
But not that you are befooling them.

00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:47.540
Because you say this because you love.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.170
And love is the basis between you and him.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.170
Nothing else.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.170
Not Money.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.139
Not what you have got for him or he has brought
for you.

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.349
Nothing of that.

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.060
All these things are not materialistic.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.329
They have nothing to do with matter.

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:08.709
Love is something which you can express also
through matter, sometimes by giving some nice

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.530
presents or nice food or something.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.560
But the most important thing is your heart.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.219
You should not cheat.

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:21.559
In anyway you should not be hypocritical,
and you should not try to do something that

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.269
is not pure.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:31.209
So in Sahaja Yoga, the purpose of these marriages
is to have you connected internationally.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.859
So you all transcend all the barriers of your
nationality, the barriers of our racialism,

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:45.400
barriers of caste, barriers of so much materialism.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.359
So you should not compare your husband with
anyone.

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.450
He is Your husband and you shouldn’t expect
too much from him.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.849
He’s not given me this, he has not done
that for me, he’s like this.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.650
This is not necessary.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.879
You must always think what I have done for
him.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.939
Also what’s wrong with me?

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.639
Now some people, especially in the west it’s
very common, that after marriage they think

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.120
that they have to work out marriages, no working
out.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.600
You see like they think that as you work out
your kitchen or work out your things.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.730
It’s not like this.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.270
Spontaneously between the two human beings
who are realised souls.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.970
It is not that you are working out anything,
but spontaneously you are going to enjoy,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:31.970
spontaneously.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:39.100
Now if you become extremely critical and try
to show you are very brilliant and this.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.760
It’s not going to work.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.500
To be humble.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.190
Keep quiet.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.820
Those who are really intelligent always keep
quiet and watch things.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.820
But those who are not, are bumptious.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:59.390
The more you are in Sahaja Yoga, the more
you will be respected by him and by everybody.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.060
Apart from that, there are so many saints
who want to be born.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.660
Once you have very happy married life among
yourselves, those saints will be born to you,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.990
and it will be such a blessing and joy for
you.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.250
So try to understand not to boss your husband
or try to put him right or do things and in

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.250
a very.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.560
I have seen some ladies who are extremely
tense, very tense type.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.810
They can never give joy.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.340
They are themselves not in joy, how can they
give joy, are themselves not in joy.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.940
So the tension should not be there.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.610
At all of any kind.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.690
Be relaxed.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:42.170
You are the other side of SahajaYoga, which
gives peace, joy, nourishment and also complete

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.490
tranquillity.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.150
In the family you are responsible for tranquillity.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.970
Even if husband is angry, children are fighting,
if the mother is tranquil you can control

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.350
all the situation.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:01.180
So the situation has to be controlled in a
way that you make life happy for everyone.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.370
Sometimes women feel very angry when I tell
them that first feed your children, your husband

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.860
and then you eat yourself.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.620
Because that is the job of a woman.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.340
Like a man should go, earn living, do what
he wants to do, job and all that.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.150
But the woman has to really look after the
husband, look after the family, look after

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.150
everything.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.750
Also you will find our Indian husbands not
so good, as far as gardening is concerned,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:39.800
or you can say, they don’t know how to mend
anything like cars or your plumbing, they

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.800
don’t know.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.270
So doesn’t matter, take it easy.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.430
Gradually they will pick up and they’ll
learn and they’ll do it.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.270
But don’t become impatient with them.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.630
Just make fun of it, you see, just make fun.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:57.530
That the best way to manage it and that don’t
expect too much, that they will do this nicely.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.630
Sometimes they cannot clean the utensils properly,
they don’t know how to do it.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.630
So alright.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.160
Just make fun of it and just enjoy it because
they have [unclear].

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.010
You see in England or America I have seen
anywhere, they have no servants at all.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.430
While we have servants here so all these boys
are spoiled by the servants.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.600
So they are absolutely good for nothing as
far as these things are concerned.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.750
But if you just try to teach them and help
them, they will definitely go all out to do

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.750
it.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.960
So the only thing you have to do is to love
them with a clear heart.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.620
And all the time forgive and let them know
that that she is the only one I have in the

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.530
whole world apart from the Holy Mother.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:49.330
Of course, I’m not against divorce, but
I’m not for it.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.410
In the sense that I don’t like people when
they divorce.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:58.610
But when things are impossible and difficult
and one has to go in for such a thing, doesn’t

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.610
matter.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.610
Sometimes one has to do it.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.280
But it should be very rare.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.710
One should not think of a divorce at all.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.610
People think of divorce in the west mostly
because of the laws, because the wife gets

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:11.480
the money or the husband gets the money.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.230
But in SahajaYoga if you are marrying, all
these things even if you are divorced, I will

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.740
not support.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.980
Moreover, another thing is that the wives
should not take money from the husband and

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.470
send it to her relations.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.470
Never.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:35.439
It’s a very very wrong thing, is to support
your family through the money of their husband

00:08:35.439 --> 00:08:36.439
Absolutely not allowed.

00:08:36.439 --> 00:08:37.529
That should not be done.

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:42.779
They.., you should not put the pressure of
your family on your husband.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:48.750
You see there has to be a clear cut understanding
for all of you.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.550
That you will not take.you must keep your
self respect.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.680
Don’t ask for anything.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.449
If he gives you anything [unclear] well and
good.

00:08:58.449 --> 00:09:00.060
But don’t ask, don’t demand.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.480
That means you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.149
If you are a satisfied soul why should you
ask for anything?

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.930
Or somebody gets something, she has got this,
she has …Nothing of that kind.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:18.170
You be satisfied and this is how some girls
nag the husbands very much.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.959
Most important thing is that you should not
talk about your past, at all.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:23.959
Because past is finished.

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:24.959
Now you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:28.069
You are all realised souls.

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:30.740
So you don’t have to say a word about your
past.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:36.870
Even if husband starts talking you just stop,
and tell him we are to live in the present.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.879
Don’t tell us about your past.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:43.399
I don’t know why people think that they
will look more attractive if they talk about

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.559
all the past nonsense they did.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:47.829
Or say that my mother was so bad.

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:51.300
All psychological nonsense.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:57.129
Not to put your parents into jeopardy by saying
that they are very bad, they are no good.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.129
This, that..

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:07.089
Just forget the past and live in the present
because in the present resides the reality

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:12.059
and the reality is the ocean of joy.

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:14.630
You should not nag him for anything.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.439
Supposing he didn’t like something, you
shouldn’t do it.

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:22.389
Whatever he doesn’t like, small things,
you know like, I was married in a family which

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:25.749
was culturally very different, very different.

00:10:25.749 --> 00:10:27.630
And they don’t wear flowers.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:33.399
You see, and in India all the married ladies,
I mean down south, I’m saying in my community,

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:39.899
all wear garlands around their buns and [unclear].

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:41.649
Always wear.

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:43.230
My husband said no better not do it.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:49.689
Because you know here in our community only
the bad women wear that to attract man.

00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:53.069
Since that day I have never worn it.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.970
Doesn’t matter, not important.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:00.930
So, also you must understand now you have
to take to the style of life of your husband.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.760
He is fond of entertaining, look after that.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.160
Women should be entertaining, they should
look after.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.329
They should not mind if somebody comes to
stay with them or lives with them.

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:12.750
They should not try to show.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:17.619
On the contrary they should be happy they
are able to look after someone who is a Sahaja

00:11:17.619 --> 00:11:18.619
Yogi.

00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:23.170
So, for the Sahaja Yogis, you must keep always
your heart open, your house open.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:28.560
There are so many things which I would like
to tell you but in this short time, I have

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:37.040
to just say that it is the responsibility
of the women to make their marriages happy.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:45.690
Depends on their intelligence and on their
dedication to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.560
It’s your responsibility.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:56.550
And if you see in a wider sense the responsibility
of making a good society is that of a woman.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.170
Even if she has to suffer she can.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.420
She is like this mother Earth.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.949
She can suffer anything She never feels she
suffers.

00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:03.209
She is so great.

00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:05.019
You are Shaktis.

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:09.290
So as Shaktis if you have to suffer, you don’t
mind.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:17.439
And what you have to feel is that we are responsible
for making our Sahaja Yoga society a perfect

00:12:17.439 --> 00:12:18.439
society.

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:21.160
That’s our responsibility.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:31.519
All your greed, all your ambitions, everything
should be directed towards making a very very

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:32.819
happy married life.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:49.669
I wish, I wish all, all of you, a very happy
and prosperous married life.
