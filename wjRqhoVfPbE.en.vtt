WEBVTT

00:00.789 --> 00:09.550
Now I have been already with your fiancés
and I talked to them.

00:09.550 --> 00:13.740
I have praised you a lot.

00:13.740 --> 00:22.640
Now first thing we have to know that this
marriage ceremony that we have organised with

00:22.640 --> 00:24.680
a purpose.

00:24.680 --> 00:31.130
The first purpose is that regard marriage
is very essential for Sahaja Yoga.

00:31.130 --> 00:36.500
If somebody doesn’t want to marry, we say
alright you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.540
It’s alright.

00:37.540 --> 00:47.150
Now why marriage is important, because a marriage
is like a big Yagnya, it’s like a big Tapasya,

00:47.150 --> 00:54.010
you can call it, or it’s a great experience.

00:54.010 --> 01:00.500
How to achieve balance, how to become a witness
and how to become a spirit.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.500
It’s very important.

01:01.500 --> 01:11.750
Now the first and foremost thing we have to
know (is) that he is your husband and nobody

01:11.750 --> 01:13.380
else is your husband.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.990
Nobody is more important than he is.

01:16.990 --> 01:21.190
See men are very easy to be controlled.

01:21.190 --> 01:26.860
If you can make them feel they are the most
important people for you, then you can manage

01:26.860 --> 01:29.160
them very well.

01:29.160 --> 01:36.409
But the first foremost ambition should be
or the idea should be that I will make my

01:36.409 --> 01:38.900
married life extremely happy.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.200
Because if the married life is happy you will
be happy.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.760
Now men have a habit of sometimes losing temper.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.689
Doesn’t matter that’s their habit.

01:47.689 --> 01:51.159
So you shouldn’t immediately become the
same type.

01:51.159 --> 02:05.439
But you can little bit in a womanly way try
to put your sweet device of smiling it or

02:05.439 --> 02:09.849
laughing it out or little bit [showing you
nice?] somehow.

02:09.849 --> 02:11.870
But not to make it serious.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.319
It’s very important.

02:13.319 --> 02:15.700
So how to handle the men.

02:15.700 --> 02:21.530
Especially your husbands is an art and that
art you will achieve gradually when you start

02:21.530 --> 02:22.590
seeing.

02:22.590 --> 02:28.180
But if you start finding faults with the men
and start saying you can’t do this, you

02:28.180 --> 02:34.689
can’t do this, you don’t know how to drive
or how to do this, or this things.

02:34.689 --> 02:36.489
Then you are finished.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.489
You must say you are the best driver.

02:38.489 --> 02:40.590
You are the best.

02:40.590 --> 02:43.984
That’s the way you have to deal with him.

02:43.984 --> 02:44.984
But not that you are befooling them.

02:44.984 --> 02:47.540
Because you say this because you love.

02:47.540 --> 02:50.170
And love is the basis between you and him.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.170
Nothing else.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.170
Not Money.

02:52.170 --> 02:55.139
Not what you have got for him or he has brought
for you.

02:55.139 --> 02:56.349
Nothing of that.

02:56.349 --> 02:58.060
All these things are not materialistic.

02:58.060 --> 03:01.329
They have nothing to do with matter.

03:01.329 --> 03:08.709
Love is something which you can express also
through matter, sometimes by giving some nice

03:08.709 --> 03:11.530
presents or nice food or something.

03:11.530 --> 03:13.560
But the most important thing is your heart.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.219
You should not cheat.

03:15.219 --> 03:21.559
In anyway you should not be hypocritical,
and you should not try to do something that

03:21.559 --> 03:23.269
is not pure.

03:23.269 --> 03:31.209
So in Sahaja Yoga, the purpose of these marriages
is to have you connected internationally.

03:31.209 --> 03:37.859
So you all transcend all the barriers of your
nationality, the barriers of our racialism,

03:37.859 --> 03:45.400
barriers of caste, barriers of so much materialism.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.359
So you should not compare your husband with
anyone.

03:47.359 --> 03:51.450
He is Your husband and you shouldn’t expect
too much from him.

03:51.450 --> 03:54.849
He’s not given me this, he has not done
that for me, he’s like this.

03:54.849 --> 03:56.650
This is not necessary.

03:56.650 --> 04:00.879
You must always think what I have done for
him.

04:00.879 --> 04:03.939
Also what’s wrong with me?

04:03.939 --> 04:09.639
Now some people, especially in the west it’s
very common, that after marriage they think

04:09.639 --> 04:13.120
that they have to work out marriages, no working
out.

04:13.120 --> 04:18.600
You see like they think that as you work out
your kitchen or work out your things.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.730
It’s not like this.

04:19.730 --> 04:24.270
Spontaneously between the two human beings
who are realised souls.

04:24.270 --> 04:30.970
It is not that you are working out anything,
but spontaneously you are going to enjoy,

04:30.970 --> 04:31.970
spontaneously.

04:31.970 --> 04:39.100
Now if you become extremely critical and try
to show you are very brilliant and this.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.760
It’s not going to work.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.500
To be humble.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.190
Keep quiet.

04:44.190 --> 04:47.820
Those who are really intelligent always keep
quiet and watch things.

04:47.820 --> 04:51.820
But those who are not, are bumptious.

04:51.820 --> 04:59.390
The more you are in Sahaja Yoga, the more
you will be respected by him and by everybody.

04:59.390 --> 05:03.060
Apart from that, there are so many saints
who want to be born.

05:03.060 --> 05:08.660
Once you have very happy married life among
yourselves, those saints will be born to you,

05:08.660 --> 05:11.990
and it will be such a blessing and joy for
you.

05:11.990 --> 05:19.250
So try to understand not to boss your husband
or try to put him right or do things and in

05:19.250 --> 05:20.250
a very.

05:20.250 --> 05:25.560
I have seen some ladies who are extremely
tense, very tense type.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.810
They can never give joy.

05:26.810 --> 05:30.340
They are themselves not in joy, how can they
give joy, are themselves not in joy.

05:30.340 --> 05:31.940
So the tension should not be there.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.610
At all of any kind.

05:33.610 --> 05:34.690
Be relaxed.

05:34.690 --> 05:42.170
You are the other side of SahajaYoga, which
gives peace, joy, nourishment and also complete

05:42.170 --> 05:44.490
tranquillity.

05:44.490 --> 05:48.150
In the family you are responsible for tranquillity.

05:48.150 --> 05:52.970
Even if husband is angry, children are fighting,
if the mother is tranquil you can control

05:52.970 --> 05:54.350
all the situation.

05:54.350 --> 06:01.180
So the situation has to be controlled in a
way that you make life happy for everyone.

06:01.180 --> 06:08.370
Sometimes women feel very angry when I tell
them that first feed your children, your husband

06:08.370 --> 06:10.860
and then you eat yourself.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.620
Because that is the job of a woman.

06:12.620 --> 06:18.340
Like a man should go, earn living, do what
he wants to do, job and all that.

06:18.340 --> 06:24.150
But the woman has to really look after the
husband, look after the family, look after

06:24.150 --> 06:25.150
everything.

06:25.150 --> 06:30.750
Also you will find our Indian husbands not
so good, as far as gardening is concerned,

06:30.750 --> 06:39.800
or you can say, they don’t know how to mend
anything like cars or your plumbing, they

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
don’t know.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.270
So doesn’t matter, take it easy.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.430
Gradually they will pick up and they’ll
learn and they’ll do it.

06:46.430 --> 06:48.270
But don’t become impatient with them.

06:48.270 --> 06:50.630
Just make fun of it, you see, just make fun.

06:50.630 --> 06:57.530
That the best way to manage it and that don’t
expect too much, that they will do this nicely.

06:57.530 --> 07:02.630
Sometimes they cannot clean the utensils properly,
they don’t know how to do it.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.630
So alright.

07:03.630 --> 07:07.160
Just make fun of it and just enjoy it because
they have [unclear].

07:07.160 --> 07:12.010
You see in England or America I have seen
anywhere, they have no servants at all.

07:12.010 --> 07:16.430
While we have servants here so all these boys
are spoiled by the servants.

07:16.430 --> 07:21.600
So they are absolutely good for nothing as
far as these things are concerned.

07:21.600 --> 07:27.750
But if you just try to teach them and help
them, they will definitely go all out to do

07:27.750 --> 07:28.750
it.

07:28.750 --> 07:32.960
So the only thing you have to do is to love
them with a clear heart.

07:32.960 --> 07:38.620
And all the time forgive and let them know
that that she is the only one I have in the

07:38.620 --> 07:43.530
whole world apart from the Holy Mother.

07:43.530 --> 07:49.330
Of course, I’m not against divorce, but
I’m not for it.

07:49.330 --> 07:52.410
In the sense that I don’t like people when
they divorce.

07:52.410 --> 07:58.610
But when things are impossible and difficult
and one has to go in for such a thing, doesn’t

07:58.610 --> 07:59.610
matter.

07:59.610 --> 08:00.610
Sometimes one has to do it.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.280
But it should be very rare.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.710
One should not think of a divorce at all.

08:05.710 --> 08:09.610
People think of divorce in the west mostly
because of the laws, because the wife gets

08:09.610 --> 08:11.480
the money or the husband gets the money.

08:11.480 --> 08:16.230
But in SahajaYoga if you are marrying, all
these things even if you are divorced, I will

08:16.230 --> 08:17.740
not support.

08:17.740 --> 08:22.980
Moreover, another thing is that the wives
should not take money from the husband and

08:22.980 --> 08:25.470
send it to her relations.

08:25.470 --> 08:26.470
Never.

08:26.470 --> 08:35.439
It’s a very very wrong thing, is to support
your family through the money of their husband

08:35.439 --> 08:36.439
Absolutely not allowed.

08:36.439 --> 08:37.529
That should not be done.

08:37.529 --> 08:42.779
They.., you should not put the pressure of
your family on your husband.

08:42.779 --> 08:48.750
You see there has to be a clear cut understanding
for all of you.

08:48.750 --> 08:53.550
That you will not take.you must keep your
self respect.

08:53.550 --> 08:55.680
Don’t ask for anything.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.449
If he gives you anything [unclear] well and
good.

08:58.449 --> 09:00.060
But don’t ask, don’t demand.

09:00.060 --> 09:02.480
That means you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

09:02.480 --> 09:06.149
If you are a satisfied soul why should you
ask for anything?

09:06.149 --> 09:09.930
Or somebody gets something, she has got this,
she has …Nothing of that kind.

09:09.930 --> 09:18.170
You be satisfied and this is how some girls
nag the husbands very much.

09:18.170 --> 09:22.959
Most important thing is that you should not
talk about your past, at all.

09:22.959 --> 09:23.959
Because past is finished.

09:23.959 --> 09:24.959
Now you are Sahaja Yogis.

09:24.959 --> 09:28.069
You are all realised souls.

09:28.069 --> 09:30.740
So you don’t have to say a word about your
past.

09:30.740 --> 09:36.870
Even if husband starts talking you just stop,
and tell him we are to live in the present.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.879
Don’t tell us about your past.

09:38.879 --> 09:43.399
I don’t know why people think that they
will look more attractive if they talk about

09:43.399 --> 09:45.559
all the past nonsense they did.

09:45.559 --> 09:47.829
Or say that my mother was so bad.

09:47.829 --> 09:51.300
All psychological nonsense.

09:51.300 --> 09:57.129
Not to put your parents into jeopardy by saying
that they are very bad, they are no good.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.129
This, that..

09:58.129 --> 10:07.089
Just forget the past and live in the present
because in the present resides the reality

10:07.089 --> 10:12.059
and the reality is the ocean of joy.

10:12.059 --> 10:14.630
You should not nag him for anything.

10:14.630 --> 10:17.439
Supposing he didn’t like something, you
shouldn’t do it.

10:17.439 --> 10:22.389
Whatever he doesn’t like, small things,
you know like, I was married in a family which

10:22.389 --> 10:25.749
was culturally very different, very different.

10:25.749 --> 10:27.630
And they don’t wear flowers.

10:27.630 --> 10:33.399
You see, and in India all the married ladies,
I mean down south, I’m saying in my community,

10:33.399 --> 10:39.899
all wear garlands around their buns and [unclear].

10:39.899 --> 10:41.649
Always wear.

10:41.649 --> 10:43.230
My husband said no better not do it.

10:43.230 --> 10:49.689
Because you know here in our community only
the bad women wear that to attract man.

10:49.689 --> 10:53.069
Since that day I have never worn it.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.970
Doesn’t matter, not important.

10:54.970 --> 11:00.930
So, also you must understand now you have
to take to the style of life of your husband.

11:00.930 --> 11:04.760
He is fond of entertaining, look after that.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.160
Women should be entertaining, they should
look after.

11:07.160 --> 11:11.329
They should not mind if somebody comes to
stay with them or lives with them.

11:11.329 --> 11:12.750
They should not try to show.

11:12.750 --> 11:17.619
On the contrary they should be happy they
are able to look after someone who is a Sahaja

11:17.619 --> 11:18.619
Yogi.

11:18.619 --> 11:23.170
So, for the Sahaja Yogis, you must keep always
your heart open, your house open.

11:23.170 --> 11:28.560
There are so many things which I would like
to tell you but in this short time, I have

11:28.560 --> 11:37.040
to just say that it is the responsibility
of the women to make their marriages happy.

11:37.040 --> 11:45.690
Depends on their intelligence and on their
dedication to Sahaja Yoga.

11:45.690 --> 11:48.560
It’s your responsibility.

11:48.560 --> 11:56.550
And if you see in a wider sense the responsibility
of making a good society is that of a woman.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.170
Even if she has to suffer she can.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.420
She is like this mother Earth.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.949
She can suffer anything She never feels she
suffers.

12:01.949 --> 12:03.209
She is so great.

12:03.209 --> 12:05.019
You are Shaktis.

12:05.019 --> 12:09.290
So as Shaktis if you have to suffer, you don’t
mind.

12:09.290 --> 12:17.439
And what you have to feel is that we are responsible
for making our Sahaja Yoga society a perfect

12:17.439 --> 12:18.439
society.

12:18.439 --> 12:21.160
That’s our responsibility.

12:21.160 --> 12:31.519
All your greed, all your ambitions, everything
should be directed towards making a very very

12:31.519 --> 12:32.819
happy married life.

12:32.819 --> 12:49.669
I wish, I wish all, all of you, a very happy
and prosperous married life.
