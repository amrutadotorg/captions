00:00.041 --> 00:00.417
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

03:23.660 --> 03:26.660
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

03:28.540 --> 03:34.750
where the evil has been suppressed.

04:06.620 --> 04:14.580
The evil that spreads its power all over

04:15.540 --> 04:19.830
is only because of two factors.

04:21.540 --> 04:27.660
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

04:29.660 --> 04:32.580
you are still blind,

04:33.750 --> 04:37.870
and you follow things

04:38.700 --> 04:41.620
which are not right but you think are powerful.

04:44.500 --> 04:51.540
This illusion creates not only problems,

04:52.660 --> 04:56.870
but absolute destruction.

04:59.910 --> 05:03.790
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

05:06.540 --> 05:12.660
and it was easily solved.

05:17.540 --> 05:20.620
It was based on all wrong basis,

05:21.750 --> 05:24.660
just to create a problem.

05:27.540 --> 05:32.830
Problem was created with a purpose,

05:38.830 --> 05:41.700
and nobody could imagine

05:43.540 --> 05:47.910
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

05:49.910 --> 05:55.870
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

06:15.540 --> 06:21.540
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

06:22.660 --> 06:26.660
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

06:27.620 --> 06:32.660
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

06:33.580 --> 06:37.660
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

06:38.750 --> 06:42.660
and they cling on to the fact

06:43.620 --> 06:46.540
that they know everything.

06:46.910 --> 06:49.750
With all this happening,

06:50.660 --> 06:53.500
there have been so many fractions,

06:53.750 --> 06:55.870
so many stupid people

06:57.620 --> 07:04.540
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

07:06.910 --> 07:09.660
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

07:10.750 --> 07:16.540
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

07:17.540 --> 07:21.830
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

07:22.700 --> 07:24.700
it is very subtle.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.910
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

07:29.620 --> 07:33.830
they fall into the wrong path of,

07:34.700 --> 07:39.660
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

07:40.540 --> 07:42.500
the people who are doing good.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.540
But above all is the power of God.

07:49.910 --> 07:55.580
All this drama is played to prove the existence

07:55.790 --> 07:57.750
of that great Power.

07:58.910 --> 08:01.790
It has all worked out so well,

08:02.620 --> 08:04.870
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

08:05.750 --> 08:10.500
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

08:11.790 --> 08:14.830
Many people who have achieved

08:15.540 --> 08:17.830
so-called success cannot see that point,

08:18.870 --> 08:23.540
but you can see it because you are spectators.

08:24.660 --> 08:30.500
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

08:30.910 --> 08:33.830
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

08:34.620 --> 08:38.950
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

08:39.790 --> 08:41.950
that would finish before Diwali.

08:43.620 --> 08:46.620
So it goes like this, the stupidity

08:47.620 --> 08:49.700
which is being created;

08:50.540 --> 08:54.000
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

08:54.620 --> 08:58.910
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

09:00.750 --> 09:05.540
If you see among all these people who have lost,

09:06.700 --> 09:09.660
what impression have they created?

09:10.540 --> 09:13.700
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

09:14.830 --> 09:19.580
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.000
But what impression they have created?

09:24.750 --> 09:27.700
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

09:29.540 --> 09:33.580
they can see that it’s a miracle,

09:34.660 --> 09:37.830
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

09:44.620 --> 09:48.660
Now the new phase has started.

09:51.620 --> 09:57.660
You all have a very, very open challenge

09:58.830 --> 10:01.870
to get people into enlightenment.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.950
People are not so ignorant now,

10:07.660 --> 10:09.830
they are not so much blasted.

10:10.830 --> 10:14.660
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

10:15.040 --> 10:21.540
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

10:21.950 --> 10:23.830
and they understand

10:24.540 --> 10:27.830
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

10:28.910 --> 10:30.700
It’s very important,

10:31.540 --> 10:37.540
because if a human being starts thinking

10:37.790 --> 10:40.750
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

10:41.830 --> 10:44.620
At any cost, whatever may happen,

10:45.540 --> 10:47.950
he’ll go on sticking to that.

10:49.700 --> 10:54.580
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

10:55.660 --> 11:00.910
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

11:01.790 --> 11:06.910
to smell the evil – innate.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.950
We cannot, human beings cannot.

11:11.870 --> 11:15.000
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

11:16.790 --> 11:22.660
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.750
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

11:28.950 --> 11:34.950
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

11:35.830 --> 11:38.660
who is a thief and who is not?

11:40.580 --> 11:42.950
We have a higher awareness.

11:43.830 --> 11:48.540
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

11:49.830 --> 11:54.870
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.790
We cook our food – they don’t.

11:59.830 --> 12:04.660
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

12:06.790 --> 12:10.580
because the way people behave

12:11.870 --> 12:17.500
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.910
All this happening

12:21.750 --> 12:24.830
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

12:25.870 --> 12:28.040
and apply it to yourself, and see

12:28.620 --> 12:31.870
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.950
For that, you have to rise higher.

12:38.830 --> 12:40.660
You have to rise higher

12:41.830 --> 12:47.580
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

12:49.750 --> 12:52.910
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

12:54.620 --> 12:58.540
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.660
Why my attention is like that?

13:01.950 --> 13:04.580
What is the main reason

13:05.910 --> 13:10.580
for my own

13:12.540 --> 13:15.700
possession, I should say, or my own

13:16.660 --> 13:21.910
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

13:24.750 --> 13:26.750
Once you’ll start seeing that,

13:26.950 --> 13:29.950
and if you find even a wee bit of such

13:30.660 --> 13:33.500
nonsensical understanding within you,

13:33.910 --> 13:36.580
then you can forgive also people

13:36.830 --> 13:40.620
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

13:41.870 --> 13:44.040
absolutely brainwashed,

13:44.790 --> 13:48.910
and they did everything under that influence.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.830
As it is now you have risen much higher

13:56.870 --> 13:59.540
than all these people,

14:00.950 --> 14:06.620
and much more aware than all of them.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.540
So you have to just understand this point,

14:12.910 --> 14:17.540
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

14:20.700 --> 14:26.660
And for the people who are actually bad,

14:27.950 --> 14:29.950
you don’t have to worry.

14:30.950 --> 14:35.750
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.750
But watch yourself and see for yourself

14:42.700 --> 14:48.950
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.870
You should try to cleanse the mirror

14:56.540 --> 15:01.790
so you see your complete image

15:03.500 --> 15:08.620
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

15:11.540 --> 15:16.700
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

15:22.950 --> 15:28.830
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

15:29.910 --> 15:32.500
I simply pity them.

15:33.540 --> 15:38.040
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

15:38.660 --> 15:40.660
to see what they have been doing.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.830
Why have they been doing like that?

15:44.790 --> 15:46.870
What is the need to do that?

15:50.700 --> 15:56.040
All this introspection will work out so well.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.790
Then your real powers will come out

16:01.000 --> 16:07.750
– your powers of giving realization,

16:09.660 --> 16:16.660
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

16:18.750 --> 16:21.830
of the whole world.

16:22.660 --> 16:28.040
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

16:28.870 --> 16:31.700
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

16:32.750 --> 16:34.870
then things will work out.

16:35.500 --> 16:40.830
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

16:42.540 --> 16:48.080
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

16:48.580 --> 16:52.540
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

16:54.580 --> 17:01.910
Of course, with that beautiful idea

17:03.040 --> 17:09.660
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

17:10.830 --> 17:14.160
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

17:14.620 --> 17:18.160
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.660
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

17:24.200 --> 17:28.620
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

17:29.870 --> 17:34.620
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

17:36.540 --> 17:43.200
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

17:43.950 --> 17:50.040
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

17:51.700 --> 17:54.540
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

17:55.540 --> 17:59.120
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

17:59.700 --> 18:01.660
and that you cannot do it.

18:05.200 --> 18:09.830
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

18:10.830 --> 18:15.750
because looks there’s a very little distance

18:16.120 --> 18:21.660
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

18:21.910 --> 18:25.080
It is a very difficult task sometimes

18:25.830 --> 18:33.700
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.160
At that point I find some of you fail.

18:40.830 --> 18:44.700
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.580
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

18:50.040 --> 18:53.830
it’s best is to introspect,

18:55.200 --> 18:58.200
“Am I doing everything right?

18:59.700 --> 19:05.040
How am I working for my betterment?”

19:06.660 --> 19:08.790
The illusion is such

19:09.540 --> 19:11.750
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.870
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

19:16.040 --> 19:18.620
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

19:19.870 --> 19:25.620
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

19:25.870 --> 19:28.700
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.000
The purpose should be

19:33.160 --> 19:35.910
that you should be able to see yourself within.

19:37.080 --> 19:41.660
You must see what is the problem inside,

19:44.910 --> 19:48.200
and you can very well understand

19:49.660 --> 19:55.500
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

19:57.200 --> 20:03.540
For example, there’s a very big building,

20:06.000 --> 20:10.580
and all the buildings in the nearby area

20:10.910 --> 20:15.870
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

20:16.830 --> 20:22.830
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

20:23.580 --> 20:27.160
is constructed on very solid grounds.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.700
In the same way

20:29.870 --> 20:33.080
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

20:34.040 --> 20:38.950
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

20:39.870 --> 20:42.910
and every person has to do that.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.120
For example, some people told Me,

20:46.500 --> 20:48.910
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

20:49.200 --> 20:51.660
they are big show-offs and that.”

20:52.830 --> 20:56.950
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

20:58.080 --> 21:01.160
that they could be like that.

21:02.080 --> 21:05.830
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

21:14.750 --> 21:19.160
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

21:19.830 --> 21:24.200
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

21:25.620 --> 21:29.080
I said, “Myself I know everything,

21:30.870 --> 21:33.660
but I want you to know everything.”

21:35.200 --> 21:40.200
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

21:40.950 --> 21:43.910
– but find out faults within yourself.

21:45.750 --> 21:48.580
What are these things that are strangling us?

21:53.000 --> 21:59.200
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

22:00.200 --> 22:07.660
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

22:09.580 --> 22:12.620
you have to know how you are driving,

22:13.080 --> 22:15.790
you have to see what are the problems.

22:16.910 --> 22:19.950
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
– it won’t work out.

22:24.660 --> 22:29.870
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

22:30.200 --> 22:34.830
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

22:38.000 --> 22:40.080
joyous thing.

22:42.080 --> 22:48.660
But this joy is not for ourselves;

22:48.950 --> 22:51.620
this joy is for the whole world.

22:52.540 --> 22:55.200
We have to work for the whole world.

22:55.910 --> 23:01.160
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

23:02.080 --> 23:06.540
but what are you doing for others?

23:07.790 --> 23:10.620
That you should see for yourself,

23:11.160 --> 23:17.950
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

23:19.700 --> 23:24.040
because they have concern, they have care,

23:24.540 --> 23:27.000
and they are doing something for others.

23:28.700 --> 23:33.500
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

23:35.540 --> 23:39.870
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

23:40.580 --> 23:45.620
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

23:45.910 --> 23:48.830
that we have to do something ourselves

23:49.750 --> 23:54.000
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

23:56.540 --> 24:03.120
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

24:04.950 --> 24:10.910
to make this light unshaky

24:12.950 --> 24:17.500
and full of enthusiasm.

24:18.950 --> 24:24.660
It’s there. It is you who are

24:25.620 --> 24:30.080
anxious to fill your pitchers.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.750
You can do it.

24:35.620 --> 24:39.870
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

24:41.120 --> 24:44.910
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

24:47.950 --> 24:50.660
complete picture about yourself,

24:52.080 --> 24:58.540
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

25:00.580 --> 25:04.200
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

25:10.870 --> 25:15.160
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

25:16.040 --> 25:19.160
what is the aim of our lives?

25:21.620 --> 25:28.160
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

25:31.950 --> 25:35.000
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

25:35.750 --> 25:42.120
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

25:42.870 --> 25:46.910
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

25:47.910 --> 25:50.500
then can you imagine what will happen?

25:50.910 --> 25:53.040
Think of that dream I have,

25:53.830 --> 26:00.660
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

26:01.660 --> 26:05.700
and we have to transform them into good people.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.660
If they are not transformed

26:08.790 --> 26:11.200
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

26:11.950 --> 26:16.750
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

26:17.500 --> 26:24.200
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

26:25.910 --> 26:29.870
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

26:30.660 --> 26:33.040
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

26:36.870 --> 26:40.500
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

26:41.000 --> 26:43.500
– you have now overcome it.

26:44.040 --> 26:48.580
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

26:48.870 --> 26:55.500
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

26:55.910 --> 27:02.500
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

27:06.200 --> 27:08.660
your method of working it out,

27:09.040 --> 27:11.200
your anxiety to work it out.

27:11.750 --> 27:15.910
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

27:19.160 --> 27:21.000
You can transform anyone.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.910
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

27:25.790 --> 27:27.870
Like when we came in the plane,

27:28.870 --> 27:31.750
I found at the airport so many people

27:32.000 --> 27:34.580
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

27:34.910 --> 27:38.660
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

27:39.660 --> 27:44.540
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

27:45.540 --> 27:48.540
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.080
” They didn’t know anything about it,

27:51.500 --> 27:53.700
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

27:53.870 --> 27:55.870
Then what is this cool coming?

27:56.830 --> 28:01.660
That basically they are there to get their realization,

28:02.620 --> 28:05.580
only we have to extend our ideals,

28:05.830 --> 28:09.080
we have to extend our love to them.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.080
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

28:14.910 --> 28:17.700
better is to give them a chance

28:18.790 --> 28:24.870
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

28:25.660 --> 28:30.200
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

28:31.540 --> 28:34.950
It’s over now. You will be amazed

28:35.160 --> 28:39.950
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

28:40.620 --> 28:45.910
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

28:50.040 --> 28:53.540
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

28:54.910 --> 28:57.910
You have to have more and more of candles,

28:58.660 --> 29:00.790
and that’s what is your job.

29:01.540 --> 29:05.040
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

29:07.000 --> 29:12.040
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

29:13.910 --> 29:16.120
at any cost, at any place?

29:19.160 --> 29:22.870
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

29:24.870 --> 29:28.540
I asked them, “What did you do?”

29:29.160 --> 29:30.870
They said, “No, nothing.”

29:31.750 --> 29:33.540
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

29:34.620 --> 29:35.750
“No, nothing.”

29:37.000 --> 29:40.200
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

29:41.540 --> 29:43.120
If you have done nothing,

29:43.950 --> 29:46.700
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

29:47.040 --> 29:51.160
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

29:52.750 --> 29:56.580
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

29:57.660 --> 30:01.870
we are coming from a program.”

30:03.580 --> 30:05.080
“How are you so late?”

30:06.160 --> 30:09.790
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

30:10.200 --> 30:12.620
“So you were waiting outside?”

30:12.750 --> 30:13.950
“Yes.” “How many?”

30:14.120 --> 30:17.660
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.790
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.750
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

30:24.120 --> 30:26.120
“But you were realized souls?”

30:26.750 --> 30:28.910
“No, we had our realization,

30:29.200 --> 30:31.950
that sometimes we have to wait too.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.620
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

30:37.160 --> 30:40.700
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

30:40.910 --> 30:43.040
Only we do it to ourselves.”

30:43.660 --> 30:46.500
So again I will say introspection

30:46.910 --> 30:49.910
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

30:50.620 --> 30:54.950
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

30:57.500 --> 31:02.950
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

31:04.080 --> 31:09.870
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

31:11.750 --> 31:16.000
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

31:16.700 --> 31:20.500
– how timely they were! It never happened,

31:21.120 --> 31:24.790
in the history of this world it never happened;

31:24.950 --> 31:29.950
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

31:30.910 --> 31:34.700
give a new experience of the showers?

31:35.700 --> 31:38.910
All this is a time, we should say,

31:39.660 --> 31:46.500
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

31:47.200 --> 31:50.950
that this is the time for a special thing.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.000
Normally I get letters

31:55.870 --> 32:00.580
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

32:00.910 --> 32:02.870
this is sick, all kinds of things.

32:03.620 --> 32:05.950
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

32:06.580 --> 32:10.000
then somebody has children, they are sick –

32:10.620 --> 32:15.040
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

32:16.870 --> 32:18.000
The reason is they

32:18.160 --> 32:20.620
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

32:21.040 --> 32:23.870
or maybe they are halfway,

32:24.700 --> 32:26.660
because they could themself say

32:26.870 --> 32:28.750
that “Why should we write to Mother?

32:29.580 --> 32:31.910
We can get it done ourselves.”

32:33.660 --> 32:36.580
Instead of that, one has to write

32:37.080 --> 32:40.540
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

32:40.870 --> 32:44.660
how they have got love from others,

32:45.580 --> 32:49.950
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

32:50.950 --> 32:53.080
All this is much better to write,

32:53.660 --> 32:56.950
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

32:57.580 --> 33:02.870
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

33:03.910 --> 33:06.950
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

33:08.660 --> 33:11.830
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

33:12.870 --> 33:16.660
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

33:16.950 --> 33:20.950
So let it be. That’s not your job,

33:21.950 --> 33:23.950
you don’t have to work it out.

33:24.540 --> 33:27.950
Even before coming I got letters like that:

33:28.910 --> 33:31.790
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

33:32.620 --> 33:35.700
So I asked this lady, I said,

33:36.080 --> 33:38.790
“Why do you write all these things

33:39.200 --> 33:42.500
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

33:42.830 --> 33:45.580
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

33:45.750 --> 33:46.950
“How?”

33:47.160 --> 33:51.200
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

33:52.040 --> 33:55.120
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.580
This looks like advertising or something,

33:59.830 --> 34:03.200
speciality that you should cure somebody,

34:03.660 --> 34:06.040
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

34:06.700 --> 34:09.200
We just don’t want such people to come.

34:10.830 --> 34:15.000
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

34:15.540 --> 34:18.660
and understanding, and the wisdom.

34:19.620 --> 34:21.910
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

34:22.120 --> 34:26.080
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

34:27.540 --> 34:31.000
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.580
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

34:36.540 --> 34:42.080
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

34:42.660 --> 34:44.120
You have to respect yourself.

34:45.160 --> 34:48.540
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.790
Like understanding,

34:54.750 --> 35:01.200
wisdom that we have come here for a

35:01.700 --> 35:06.200
very,  very special work of very high quality:

35:07.830 --> 35:12.750
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

35:13.660 --> 35:16.580
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

35:18.080 --> 35:21.950
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

35:23.080 --> 35:26.000
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

35:27.120 --> 35:29.870
And all my relations are now saying,

35:30.120 --> 35:32.950
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

35:33.200 --> 35:36.750
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

35:38.540 --> 35:42.950
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

35:44.160 --> 35:47.500
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

35:47.950 --> 35:50.870
that “all my family people are saying ...

35:51.000 --> 35:53.160
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

35:55.580 --> 35:57.830
If this marriage doesn’t become

35:58.120 --> 35:59.910
all right, then they will say there’s

36:00.080 --> 36:02.080
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.700
We have not committed that way.

36:11.160 --> 36:14.700
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

36:14.870 --> 36:15.910
father, this, that.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.540
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

36:22.660 --> 36:24.950
You yourself can cure them

36:26.580 --> 36:28.830
you can work it out yourself.

36:29.750 --> 36:33.830
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.660
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

36:39.870 --> 36:40.870
“Mother?" " No.”

36:41.160 --> 36:43.500
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

36:44.200 --> 36:49.500
So why are you asking Me?

36:50.160 --> 36:52.660
What relationship I have with them?

36:53.500 --> 36:56.950
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.910
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

37:03.830 --> 37:06.540
It is impossible to understand.

37:08.200 --> 37:12.120
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

37:13.200 --> 37:18.500
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

37:18.950 --> 37:22.620
you can give them and fix them properly.

37:23.160 --> 37:27.120
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

37:27.790 --> 37:31.580
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

37:31.750 --> 37:33.120
all kinds of things

37:33.830 --> 37:38.700
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

37:39.700 --> 37:43.700
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.580
What you should do is to see

37:47.750 --> 37:51.080
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

37:52.870 --> 37:54.000
And you must tell them,

37:54.160 --> 37:57.580
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

37:59.540 --> 38:01.540
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

38:01.660 --> 38:04.660
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

38:07.000 --> 38:09.750
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

38:11.080 --> 38:13.200
so everybody comes there.

38:14.620 --> 38:17.040
I would request you on a Diwali day

38:17.540 --> 38:22.000
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

38:22.540 --> 38:24.790
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

38:28.660 --> 38:30.160
” It’s very important,

38:31.120 --> 38:34.200
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

38:37.160 --> 38:39.040
and on wrong basis.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.580
If you have some intelligence

38:42.910 --> 38:46.000
you must know that now you belong

38:46.950 --> 38:53.870
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

38:55.660 --> 39:00.080
which are very few. In this world

39:01.620 --> 39:06.950
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

39:08.160 --> 39:14.120
to see that this quality

39:16.000 --> 39:18.200
must be in so many people,

39:18.790 --> 39:22.200
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

39:22.870 --> 39:26.080
Find out such people, tell them

39:26.700 --> 39:29.040
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

39:30.830 --> 39:34.080
But don’t worry about things

39:34.540 --> 39:37.160
which are of no value to us.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.580
You must know you are a special race.

39:41.830 --> 39:43.870
You are special soldiers

39:44.870 --> 39:49.950
who have been trained

39:51.660 --> 39:53.700
for doing Sahaj work only.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.910
So wasting energy on your relations

39:59.040 --> 40:03.080
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

40:06.790 --> 40:08.910
It is to be understood now

40:10.580 --> 40:15.120
that you have your own energy reserved

40:16.790 --> 40:20.830
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

40:23.500 --> 40:28.540
You should help everyone

40:28.910 --> 40:31.700
who is a Sahaja yogi

40:31.870 --> 40:34.200
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.700
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

40:39.200 --> 40:43.160
you must help them; because we are one Personality

40:44.870 --> 40:47.870
and these are all the different hands

40:49.200 --> 40:52.660
of one Personality, one God.

40:54.830 --> 40:58.750
So this oneness must be established

40:59.700 --> 41:06.120
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.660
There are some people who are very active.

41:12.700 --> 41:17.620
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.580
All that will work out, I’m sure,

41:25.870 --> 41:31.790
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

41:32.790 --> 41:36.910
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

41:37.700 --> 41:39.790
nothing will work out.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.870
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

41:48.040 --> 41:52.790
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

41:53.540 --> 41:57.160
All the armament they have, everything they have;

41:57.910 --> 41:59.750
but we need more.

42:01.160 --> 42:05.160
And for that we have to work out collectively,

42:06.160 --> 42:08.830
must plan what should we do.

42:10.830 --> 42:14.000
Recently there has been a big

42:15.790 --> 42:19.790
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

42:20.910 --> 42:24.620
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

42:26.160 --> 42:33.660
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

42:34.620 --> 42:38.200
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

42:39.080 --> 42:43.160
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

42:43.950 --> 42:46.620
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

42:47.160 --> 42:51.200
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

42:53.870 --> 42:56.910
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

42:58.500 --> 43:01.750
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

43:02.870 --> 43:05.950
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

43:06.700 --> 43:13.040
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

43:14.700 --> 43:19.120
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

43:19.870 --> 43:25.120
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

43:25.790 --> 43:31.120
And you will definitely try to correct it,

43:31.660 --> 43:33.160
if you love them

43:34.580 --> 43:36.750
– or you give up.

43:38.200 --> 43:42.160
These are special people, specially selected

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
for a very special cause,

43:45.500 --> 43:49.620
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.790
That is one thing you should know.

43:53.750 --> 43:56.040
On this Diwali day you have to know

43:56.790 --> 43:59.700
that you have to burn yourself

44:00.580 --> 44:07.040
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

44:09.870 --> 44:12.160
But don’t do it too much.

44:12.620 --> 44:14.830
Like some people came and told Me,

44:15.160 --> 44:17.790
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

44:17.910 --> 44:20.120
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

44:20.790 --> 44:22.790
Still we are not good.”

44:23.200 --> 44:25.870
So I said, “Why should you give up?

44:26.660 --> 44:29.870
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

44:30.580 --> 44:33.540
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

44:33.950 --> 44:39.000
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

44:39.750 --> 44:44.870
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

44:46.540 --> 44:49.500
Such half-baked people are no good,

44:50.870 --> 44:53.620
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

44:54.660 --> 44:56.870
They don’t deserve any attention.

44:58.200 --> 45:02.700
That is very much to be understood,

45:03.580 --> 45:05.700
that you should not be also like that,

45:06.200 --> 45:08.910
nor you should have friends like that,.

45:09.080 --> 45:12.120
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

45:12.950 --> 45:16.620
Sahaja yogi is a special character

45:16.830 --> 45:20.580
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

45:23.080 --> 45:29.080
That kind of a personality when you will have,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.750
there will be lights all over.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.750
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

45:43.620 --> 45:46.620
and I want you to respect yourself

45:47.660 --> 45:51.620
and understand what is the position of

45:52.000 --> 45:54.540
your being in this

45:58.000 --> 46:03.040
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.950
And how are we working it out?

46:08.700 --> 46:10.750
The attention should move from

46:11.040 --> 46:14.950
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

46:16.750 --> 46:20.580
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.700
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

46:27.910 --> 46:33.750
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

46:35.700 --> 46:38.660
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.830
May God bless you.
