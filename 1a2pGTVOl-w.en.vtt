00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.417
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.660
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.750
where the evil has been suppressed.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:14.580
The evil that spreads its power all over

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.830
is only because of two factors.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.660
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.580
you are still blind,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.870
and you follow things

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.620
which are not right but you think are powerful.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.540
This illusion creates not only problems,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.870
but absolute destruction.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.790
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.660
and it was easily solved.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.620
It was based on all wrong basis,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.660
just to create a problem.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.830
Problem was created with a purpose,

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.700
and nobody could imagine

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.910
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.870
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:21.540
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.660
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.660
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.660
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.660
and they cling on to the fact

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.540
that they know everything.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.750
With all this happening,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.500
there have been so many fractions,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.870
so many stupid people

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.540
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.660
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.540
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.830
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.700
it is very subtle.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.910
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.830
they fall into the wrong path of,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.660
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.500
the people who are doing good.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.540
But above all is the power of God.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:55.580
All this drama is played to prove the existence

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.750
of that great Power.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.790
It has all worked out so well,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.870
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.500
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.830
Many people who have achieved

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.830
so-called success cannot see that point,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.540
but you can see it because you are spectators.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.500
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.830
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.950
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.950
that would finish before Diwali.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.620
So it goes like this, the stupidity

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.700
which is being created;

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.000
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.910
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.540
If you see among all these people who have lost,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.660
what impression have they created?

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.700
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.580
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.000
But what impression they have created?

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.700
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.580
they can see that it’s a miracle,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.830
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.660
Now the new phase has started.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:57.660
You all have a very, very open challenge

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.870
to get people into enlightenment.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.950
People are not so ignorant now,

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.830
they are not so much blasted.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.660
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:21.540
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.830
and they understand

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.830
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.700
It’s very important,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:37.540
because if a human being starts thinking

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.750
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.620
At any cost, whatever may happen,

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.950
he’ll go on sticking to that.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.580
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.910
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.910
to smell the evil – innate.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.950
We cannot, human beings cannot.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.000
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:22.660
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.750
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:34.950
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.660
who is a thief and who is not?

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.950
We have a higher awareness.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.540
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.870
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.790
We cook our food – they don’t.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.660
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.580
because the way people behave

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:17.500
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.910
All this happening

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.830
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.040
and apply it to yourself, and see

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.870
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.950
For that, you have to rise higher.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.660
You have to rise higher

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:47.580
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.910
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.540
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.660
Why my attention is like that?

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.580
What is the main reason

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:10.580
for my own

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.700
possession, I should say, or my own

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.910
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.750
Once you’ll start seeing that,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.950
and if you find even a wee bit of such

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.500
nonsensical understanding within you,

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.580
then you can forgive also people

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.620
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.040
absolutely brainwashed,

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.910
and they did everything under that influence.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.830
As it is now you have risen much higher

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.540
than all these people,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:06.620
and much more aware than all of them.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.540
So you have to just understand this point,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.540
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:26.660
And for the people who are actually bad,

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.950
you don’t have to worry.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.750
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.750
But watch yourself and see for yourself

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:48.950
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.870
You should try to cleanse the mirror

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:01.790
so you see your complete image

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.620
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:16.700
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:28.830
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.500
I simply pity them.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.040
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.660
to see what they have been doing.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.830
Why have they been doing like that?

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.870
What is the need to do that?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:56.040
All this introspection will work out so well.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.790
Then your real powers will come out

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.750
– your powers of giving realization,

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:16.660
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.830
of the whole world.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:28.040
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.700
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.870
then things will work out.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:40.830
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:48.080
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.540
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:17:01.910
Of course, with that beautiful idea

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:09.660
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.160
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.160
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.660
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.620
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.620
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:43.200
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:50.040
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.540
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.120
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.660
and that you cannot do it.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.830
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:15.750
because looks there’s a very little distance

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.660
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.080
It is a very difficult task sometimes

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:33.700
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.160
At that point I find some of you fail.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.700
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.580
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.830
it’s best is to introspect,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.200
“Am I doing everything right?

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:05.040
How am I working for my betterment?”

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.790
The illusion is such

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.750
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.870
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.620
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:25.620
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.700
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.000
The purpose should be

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.910
that you should be able to see yourself within.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.660
You must see what is the problem inside,

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.200
and you can very well understand

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.500
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:03.540
For example, there’s a very big building,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.580
and all the buildings in the nearby area

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:15.870
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:22.830
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.160
is constructed on very solid grounds.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.700
In the same way

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.080
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.950
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.910
and every person has to do that.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.120
For example, some people told Me,

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.910
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.660
they are big show-offs and that.”

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:56.950
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.160
that they could be like that.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.830
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:19.160
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:24.200
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.080
I said, “Myself I know everything,

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.660
but I want you to know everything.”

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.200
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.910
– but find out faults within yourself.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.580
What are these things that are strangling us?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.200
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:07.660
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.620
you have to know how you are driving,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.790
you have to see what are the problems.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.950
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.040
– it won’t work out.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.870
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.830
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.080
joyous thing.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.660
But this joy is not for ourselves;

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.620
this joy is for the whole world.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.200
We have to work for the whole world.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:01.160
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.540
but what are you doing for others?

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.620
That you should see for yourself,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:17.950
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.040
because they have concern, they have care,

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.000
and they are doing something for others.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.500
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.870
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.620
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.830
that we have to do something ourselves

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:54.000
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:03.120
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:10.910
to make this light unshaky

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:17.500
and full of enthusiasm.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:24.660
It’s there. It is you who are

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.080
anxious to fill your pitchers.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.750
You can do it.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.870
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.910
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.660
complete picture about yourself,

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:58.540
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.200
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.160
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.160
what is the aim of our lives?

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:28.160
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.000
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:42.120
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.910
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.500
then can you imagine what will happen?

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:53.040
Think of that dream I have,

00:25:53.830 --> 00:26:00.660
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.700
and we have to transform them into good people.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.660
If they are not transformed

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:11.200
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.750
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:24.200
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.870
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.040
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.500
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.500
– you have now overcome it.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.580
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:55.500
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:02.500
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.660
your method of working it out,

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.200
your anxiety to work it out.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:15.910
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.000
You can transform anyone.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.910
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.870
Like when we came in the plane,

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.750
I found at the airport so many people

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.580
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.660
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:44.540
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.540
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.080
” They didn’t know anything about it,

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.700
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:55.870
Then what is this cool coming?

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.660
That basically they are there to get their realization,

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.580
only we have to extend our ideals,

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.080
we have to extend our love to them.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.080
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.700
better is to give them a chance

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:24.870
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:30.200
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.950
It’s over now. You will be amazed

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.950
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:45.910
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.540
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.910
You have to have more and more of candles,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.790
and that’s what is your job.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.040
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.040
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.120
at any cost, at any place?

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.870
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.540
I asked them, “What did you do?”

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.870
They said, “No, nothing.”

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.540
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.750
“No, nothing.”

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.200
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.120
If you have done nothing,

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.700
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.160
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.580
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.870
we are coming from a program.”

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.080
“How are you so late?”

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.790
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.620
“So you were waiting outside?”

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.950
“Yes.” “How many?”

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.660
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.790
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.750
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.120
“But you were realized souls?”

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.910
“No, we had our realization,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.950
that sometimes we have to wait too.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.620
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.700
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.040
Only we do it to ourselves.”

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.500
So again I will say introspection

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:49.910
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.950
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:02.950
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.870
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.000
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.500
– how timely they were! It never happened,

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.790
in the history of this world it never happened;

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:29.950
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:34.700
give a new experience of the showers?

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.910
All this is a time, we should say,

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:46.500
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.950
that this is the time for a special thing.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.000
Normally I get letters

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:00.580
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.870
this is sick, all kinds of things.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.950
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.000
then somebody has children, they are sick –

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:15.040
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.000
The reason is they

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.620
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.870
or maybe they are halfway,

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.660
because they could themself say

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.750
that “Why should we write to Mother?

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.910
We can get it done ourselves.”

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.580
Instead of that, one has to write

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.540
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:44.660
how they have got love from others,

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.950
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.080
All this is much better to write,

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.950
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:02.870
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.950
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.830
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:16.660
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:20.950
So let it be. That’s not your job,

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.950
you don’t have to work it out.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.950
Even before coming I got letters like that:

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.790
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:35.700
So I asked this lady, I said,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.790
“Why do you write all these things

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.500
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:45.580
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.950
“How?”

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.200
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.120
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.580
This looks like advertising or something,

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:03.200
speciality that you should cure somebody,

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.040
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.200
We just don’t want such people to come.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:15.000
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.660
and understanding, and the wisdom.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.910
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.080
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.000
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.580
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:42.080
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.120
You have to respect yourself.

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.540
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.790
Like understanding,

00:34:54.750 --> 00:35:01.200
wisdom that we have come here for a

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:06.200
very,  very special work of very high quality:

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:12.750
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.580
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.950
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.000
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.870
And all my relations are now saying,

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.950
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.750
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.950
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.500
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.870
that “all my family people are saying ...

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.160
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.830
If this marriage doesn’t become

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.910
all right, then they will say there’s

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.080
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.700
We have not committed that way.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.700
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:15.910
father, this, that.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.540
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:24.950
You yourself can cure them

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.830
you can work it out yourself.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.830
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.660
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:40.870
“Mother?" " No.”

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.500
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.500
So why are you asking Me?

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.660
What relationship I have with them?

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.950
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.910
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.540
It is impossible to understand.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.120
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.500
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.620
you can give them and fix them properly.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.120
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:31.580
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.120
all kinds of things

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:38.700
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.700
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.580
What you should do is to see

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.080
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.000
And you must tell them,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.580
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.540
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.660
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.750
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.200
so everybody comes there.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.040
I would request you on a Diwali day

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:22.000
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.790
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.160
” It’s very important,

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.200
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.040
and on wrong basis.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.580
If you have some intelligence

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.000
you must know that now you belong

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:53.870
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:00.080
which are very few. In this world

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:06.950
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:14.120
to see that this quality

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.200
must be in so many people,

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.200
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.080
Find out such people, tell them

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.040
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:34.080
But don’t worry about things

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.160
which are of no value to us.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.580
You must know you are a special race.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.870
You are special soldiers

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:49.950
who have been trained

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.700
for doing Sahaj work only.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.910
So wasting energy on your relations

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.080
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.910
It is to be understood now

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:15.120
that you have your own energy reserved

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:20.830
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.540
You should help everyone

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.700
who is a Sahaja yogi

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.200
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.700
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.160
you must help them; because we are one Personality

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.870
and these are all the different hands

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.660
of one Personality, one God.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.750
So this oneness must be established

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:06.120
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.660
There are some people who are very active.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.620
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.580
All that will work out, I’m sure,

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:31.790
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:36.910
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.790
nothing will work out.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.870
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:52.790
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.160
All the armament they have, everything they have;

00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:59.750
but we need more.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.160
And for that we have to work out collectively,

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.830
must plan what should we do.

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:14.000
Recently there has been a big

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.790
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:24.620
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:33.660
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:38.200
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.160
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.620
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.200
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:56.910
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.750
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:05.950
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:13.040
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:19.120
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:25.120
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:31.120
And you will definitely try to correct it,

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.160
if you love them

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.750
– or you give up.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.160
These are special people, specially selected

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
for a very special cause,

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.620
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.790
That is one thing you should know.

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:56.040
On this Diwali day you have to know

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.700
that you have to burn yourself

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:07.040
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.160
But don’t do it too much.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.830
Like some people came and told Me,

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.790
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:20.120
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.790
Still we are not good.”

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.870
So I said, “Why should you give up?

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.870
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.540
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:39.000
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:44.870
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.500
Such half-baked people are no good,

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:53.620
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.870
They don’t deserve any attention.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.700
That is very much to be understood,

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.700
that you should not be also like that,

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.910
nor you should have friends like that,.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.120
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:16.620
Sahaja yogi is a special character

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:20.580
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:29.080
That kind of a personality when you will have,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.750
there will be lights all over.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.750
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.620
and I want you to respect yourself

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.620
and understand what is the position of

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.540
your being in this

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.040
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.950
And how are we working it out?

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.750
The attention should move from

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.950
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:20.580
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.700
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:33.750
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.660
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.830
May God bless you.
