00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.170
When Warren talks about other gurus I can't help laughing.

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.042
It's beyond me to understand

00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:25.554
why people get stuck up with them, it's really beyond that

00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:28.604
because it is so obvious

00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:33.213
that God cannot be bought,

00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:38.256
you cannot pay for God, it is absolutely obvious

00:01:38.756 --> 00:01:41.474
for any intelligent man, it should be obvious.

00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:50.112
How much did you pay to become a human being from say monkeys,

00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:56.031
or what did we do, did we cut our tails or anything to become human beings?

00:01:57.603 --> 00:02:00.281
We have become by the grace of God.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.359
What can we pay for the grace of God?

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:10.381
It is very simple you cannot,

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:12.881
God doesn't understand money.

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:16.263
It is human beings who have created money and all these things

00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:19.238
and economic wants and all this economic problem.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:22.230
God doesn't understand any economics that you have made.

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:23.667
He doesn't understand!

00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:27.818
This is all your own doings.

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.182
Your own projections and complications

00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:33.044
and you are entangled into it.

00:02:33.544 --> 00:02:34.860
It is as simple as that.

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:38.605
I mean, you have seen these people

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:44.789
who live on other people's money,

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.781
I call it OPM, are parasites.

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:53.787
You won't live on other people's money; will you, any one of you.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.668
So they do not have even a simple self-respect.

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:03.800
Not only that, but these parasites are thriving.

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:08.685
It is so obvious, so very obvious,

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:13.162
that we like befooling.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:17.008
The more one is able to befool us, the better we are.

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.922
I went to Calcutta once for a program

00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:27.129
and I had many programs,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.256
but one of them was in a very posh place as they call it, in a

00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:36.908
hotel they arranged the program. I said this hotel people, you see.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.682
These rich people they will not be interested in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.742
They have been too rich.

00:03:41.714 --> 00:03:42.851
From all over the world

00:03:45.274 --> 00:03:48.443
overly rich people can never understand this you see,

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:52.063
they want somebody who will take money from them,

00:03:52.213 --> 00:03:53.751
and they can show off their money.

00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:57.749
And we had a program and there were two halls.

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:02.510
I told them take a very small one because I know them too well,

00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:07.748
and the bigger hall was occupied by another fellow

00:04:07.994 --> 00:04:12.671
who was with some sort of a show on,

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:17.518
stuff, and we were amazed that, except for two people,

00:04:18.018 --> 00:04:20.861
most of them who came inside went to his program

00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:26.707
and after eight days he was arrested in Poona for robbing people.

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:32.526
But all of them went to his program and not to mine.

00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:35.973
When it was written not a single pie will be charged and it's all-free

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:37.242
and all those things

00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:42.331
and he looked so dishonest for me from his own photographs, if you

00:04:42.402 --> 00:04:44.402
could see him, he was so dishonest to look at

00:04:45.078 --> 00:04:48.490
and people could not see that, I mean it was so simple to see.

00:04:49.575 --> 00:04:52.295
See, that shows that you have lost every sensitivity

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:58.135
to know what is plastic and what is real.

00:05:01.463 --> 00:05:03.463
It makes me laugh sometimes, the way

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.963
today only I was discussing in the aero plane with somebody

00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:09.300
He was seriously telling me how much he was tortured by

00:05:10.054 --> 00:05:12.620
another group where he paid three thousand pounds

00:05:13.218 --> 00:05:16.159
just to get some sort of a horrible mantra which has no meaning

00:05:17.888 --> 00:05:20.715
and where he worked very hard for days together

00:05:22.258 --> 00:05:26.029
and he broke his back and he broke his every part of his

00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:31.536
bone in the backbone area, and all sorts of things he did and

00:05:32.036 --> 00:05:34.405
I mean he became so nervous,

00:05:34.788 --> 00:05:35.917
recluse,

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.716
they are even frightened of a garlic, if they see one garlic, I mean

00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:45.204
after getting realization you have to become a person who is absolutely powerful

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.091
in control of yourself

00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:49.805
not aggressive but not to be

00:05:50.305 --> 00:05:53.137
such a cowardly recluses

00:05:56.236 --> 00:05:59.206
and he told me all these things and I did not know what to do

00:05:59.823 --> 00:06:04.496
because it was such a description

00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:06.996
They don't know whether to laugh or to cry

00:06:07.105 --> 00:06:10.860
really because this thing behind it

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.153
is all hocus pocus absolutely hocus pocus,

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.760
I think this world must have started after the fact that I'm coming into this world

00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:21.865
absolutely absurd is to say that you will fly or

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.171
you will see the light and all these nonsenses,

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.289
and on top of that

00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:32.909
the suffering of a person,

00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:35.917
of a person who is a genuine seeker,

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:37.862
who is a seeker of the truth.

00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:41.026
He is a man of God

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.268
and he's being tortured like this you see

00:06:44.768 --> 00:06:45.873
makes you so unhappy.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.095
You just don't know what to say about the whole thing that's happening.

00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:51.689
You have to wake up

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:55.975
to your self-esteem and know that you are created human beings

00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:57.027
for a special thing,

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.741
and not to be bounced and cheated by these horrible fake people.

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:06.935
One has to understand the innate nature of God

00:07:07.435 --> 00:07:09.435
to understand what should happen to you

00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:14.195
as realized souls, if you become abnormal and freaky

00:07:14.793 --> 00:07:17.501
then it is not that you have got your realization,

00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:19.688
on the contrary a person

00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:25.173
who is realized becomes extremely normal, is the most normal person.

00:07:28.738 --> 00:07:32.092
Apart from these things there are some reasons

00:07:32.293 --> 00:07:36.141
built-in within us which make us so stupid.

00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:40.524
Really built-in I should say, because we have come from matter,

00:07:41.874 --> 00:07:45.917
we are gross, our origin has been gross,

00:07:46.417 --> 00:07:50.030
we came from matter and we grew up

00:07:51.155 --> 00:07:53.462
to see that there is something beyond the matter

00:07:53.962 --> 00:07:56.413
that is the spirit and we are the spirit,

00:07:57.063 --> 00:07:59.489
but we get dominated by this matter,

00:07:59.989 --> 00:08:03.720
we really get dominated by matter, all through in our ventures,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.365
for example, if you are sitting in a chair,

00:08:07.465 --> 00:08:10.952
for example you make a chair out of some matter, you cannot sit on the ground,

00:08:12.277 --> 00:08:15.873
you form a habit of matter, matter starts growing on you,

00:08:16.798 --> 00:08:21.404
you become such a slave, such a slave of matter

00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:24.171
that you cannot get over it,

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:27.493
any matter you start using, for example you use a car

00:08:27.668 --> 00:08:28.923
then you cannot do without a car,

00:08:30.423 --> 00:08:32.831
you use electricity which is a material power,

00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:35.431
if it fails everything goes out,

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:37.508
you cannot do without it.

00:08:38.008 --> 00:08:41.021
So matter is all the time trying to overpower the spirit,

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:44.901
but the beauty is, through your evolution,

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:49.094
you evolve to a stage

00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:52.388
where you are a human being and you start seeing the matter

00:08:53.113 --> 00:08:57.044
cannot dominate your spirit. This should be the self-estimation,

00:08:58.819 --> 00:09:02.475
there should be understanding that you are the spirit and not the matter.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.602
When you see this simple point

00:09:09.702 --> 00:09:13.419
then you understand that you cannot purchase God.

00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:21.207
Then another point also one understands that it is not the way,

00:09:22.532 --> 00:09:25.857
materially uses somebody you should accept

00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:31.084
but spiritually, if he does something spiritually to you

00:09:32.262 --> 00:09:33.274
then you should accept

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.324
for example seeing the light,

00:09:36.824 --> 00:09:39.735
say they say you see the light, why see the light myself, yes

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:45.395
but to see the light I have to be away from the light,

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:47.873
do you see the point?

00:09:49.998 --> 00:09:51.998
You have to be the light.

00:09:57.723 --> 00:10:01.714
So it's a very simple thing, if you understand it's commonsense,

00:10:02.339 --> 00:10:04.339
that if you have to be the light,

00:10:05.764 --> 00:10:07.764
then you have to be inside the light,

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:11.639
part and parcel of the light.

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:14.539
But to see the light you have to go further.

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:16.714
Actually from this distance I can't even see

00:10:17.214 --> 00:10:20.357
if I have to really see the light I have to go much further to see this light.

00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:24.342
All these things that they are talking

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:30.177
and telling you is such a camouflage

00:10:31.227 --> 00:10:33.432
and they have been very good at befooling you.

00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:42.482
It is impossible to convince people who want to be befooled.

00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:49.222
It is impossible. It is easy to befool them

00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:52.844
because they are anxious to be befooled, so alright,

00:10:54.894 --> 00:10:56.894
but those who want

00:10:58.694 --> 00:11:01.812
that they should really realized it, they should get it

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:06.050
then their attitude is very different, they would like to go and see.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.860
what the disciples have got,

00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:10.785
these people who have paid so much money,

00:11:10.985 --> 00:11:13.636
there have been people for fifteen years, twenty years, go and see them,

00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:15.159
what have you got?

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:21.911
If they say, "alright, I am feeling very much better in health",

00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:26.661
you look at the face and you will know that they are not.

00:11:28.736 --> 00:11:31.751
Supposing they say "I feel relaxed", so what?

00:11:32.676 --> 00:11:34.676
What is so great that you are feeling relaxed,

00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:38.673
so called relaxation, you can feel relaxed even with the dope

00:11:40.448 --> 00:11:43.930
even going to a pub you might feel relaxed,

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.181
in some company you might feel relaxed, so what?

00:11:46.306 --> 00:11:48.686
What is so great, is that something God's work?

00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:51.518
Just to relax you?

00:11:53.592 --> 00:11:55.592
Some people say

00:11:56.092 --> 00:11:58.911
"I feel better" this might be ego pampering.

00:11:59.392 --> 00:12:02.753
But what powers did you get yourself? If you become the Spirit

00:12:03.553 --> 00:12:06.829
then you have to have powers of the spirit flowing through you, isn't it?

00:12:07.054 --> 00:12:10.340
It should be a common, logical conclusion.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.190
'What is the power, you have got?

00:12:18.665 --> 00:12:20.665
What have I got from them?

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.590
They have taken all my purse, my money.

00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:26.474
Thousands of pounds have gone to him, everything done?

00:12:26.624 --> 00:12:31.598
What did I get from him? "We should have an understanding,

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:36.376
but this nobody asks

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.876
because there is a big mafia in all these organizations,

00:12:39.151 --> 00:12:41.653
you are not supposed discuss, you are not supposed to talk.

00:12:42.478 --> 00:12:45.960
You are put in different compartments; it's a big secret going on,

00:12:47.035 --> 00:12:49.464
If you tell some Indian, he just laugh,

00:12:50.614 --> 00:12:52.614
because he knows the meanings of these words,

00:12:53.414 --> 00:12:54.277
are so stupid.

00:12:55.327 --> 00:12:57.327
Some of the words of the mantras means

00:12:57.527 --> 00:13:01.238
this showing this, some of the words means scorpion,

00:13:02.693 --> 00:13:08.186
some of them means the serpent,

00:13:08.686 --> 00:13:13.429
all kinds of things, and some of them means the siren.

00:13:16.804 --> 00:13:18.804
In a very ridiculous way

00:13:19.754 --> 00:13:22.399
these people have befooled you.

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:24.649
A sort of a respite they are taken I think,

00:13:25.624 --> 00:13:26.687
or is it a respite

00:13:28.937 --> 00:13:34.558
of the satanic on the divine people who have come on this earth to seek God?

00:13:35.633 --> 00:13:37.862
Is that attack of these negative people

00:13:38.362 --> 00:13:40.744
who are trying to divide you completely and

00:13:41.894 --> 00:13:43.894
ruin your images on this earth,

00:13:44.819 --> 00:13:47.945
you have to be aware of that. We are very vulnerable

00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:50.176
because you are seeking,

00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:55.046
you are more vulnerable because you have no self esteem,

00:13:56.013 --> 00:13:58.013
you treat yourselves so cheaply.

00:13:58.913 --> 00:14:01.971
You do not judge into what lions' den you are entering into

00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:04.471
and you get be so badly hurt,

00:14:05.396 --> 00:14:01.341
with all your sincerity, with all that,

00:14:07.896 --> 00:14:10.882
you do not give a second thought to think that

00:14:11.107 --> 00:14:12.930
even if there are thousands of them going

00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:15.082
before I going there I should find out

00:14:15.232 --> 00:14:18.158
what sort of a nonsense is going on there.

00:14:19.032 --> 00:14:21.578
If you go there as an ordinary visitor,

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.151
you will immediately find out

00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:25.651
that this is a fake and a false thing going on,

00:14:25.826 --> 00:14:28.385
you have been warned in the bible

00:14:32.443 --> 00:14:33.454
it has been warned

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.215
that there will be fake and false people coming on this earth.

00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:43.956
Now there are another type of people also,

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:45.114
I will cover

00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:49.106
the chakras later little, because giving little introduction to the subject

00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:51.531
about how to avoid this thing,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.776
who are bound by ritualistic ideas, as he said about Christianity,

00:14:59.238 --> 00:15:02.007
of giving very subtle forms of things.

00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:06.431
But we must see what it is doing,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.868
like Church of England,

00:15:09.692 --> 00:15:12.529
can you imagine, Church of England owns the whole of Soho.

00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:17.609
And the question was raised, "how can you own this Soho,

00:15:17.652 --> 00:15:19.844
where all the prostitutes are earning their livings?"

00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:21.727
And the answer came in

00:15:21.827 --> 00:15:25.299
that Christ looked after Mary Magdalene, who was a prostitute, see,

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:32.811
you can see, and the people accepted this answer.

00:15:38.149 --> 00:15:40.955
Then the whole thing of a ritual starts, you see,

00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:43.287
"come along here and sit down,

00:15:43.463 --> 00:15:45.599
and bring the child and we will baptize it."

00:15:47.318 --> 00:15:48.392
It's a joke,

00:15:51.788 --> 00:15:53.289
it's a very big joke.

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:58.036
Baptism is a living process within you,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.818
it's a living happening.

00:16:01.347 --> 00:16:03.347
Did Christ baptize anyone of them?

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.547
Did He put His hand on anybody's head and say "you are baptized by Me"?

00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:16.533
Ask the question, did He do it?

00:16:20.004 --> 00:16:21.389
Then how are these people doing it?

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:23.631
They have taken Christ into their hands

00:16:23.941 --> 00:16:26.268
as if they found Him somewhere in the storm somewhere.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.142
What right have they got to say they are baptizing?

00:16:33.194 --> 00:16:38.682
It is a living force of God, which resides within you

00:16:39.334 --> 00:16:42.344
He said that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames."

00:16:42.882 --> 00:16:44.538
Let them explain this point only.

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:48.358
Then they say He is Alpha and Omega

00:16:48.858 --> 00:16:49.663
what does that mean?

00:16:50.163 --> 00:16:52.836
For all practical purposes what does that mean to you?

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.604
For that you have to read Devi Bhagvatam.

00:17:01.723 --> 00:17:03.723
What was Christ? Who is He?

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:06.050
How He is Alpha and He is Omega

00:17:06.912 --> 00:17:09.680
Why He came on this earth? Really, what was His purpose?

00:17:09.723 --> 00:17:12.544
There is nothing there. Just some few people who were not realized

00:17:12.682 --> 00:17:14.682
saw Him and wrote it down, finished.

00:17:18.611 --> 00:17:21.505
How can that become such an authority for anyone whatsoever,

00:17:21.662 --> 00:17:22.585
that you are fighting.

00:17:24.266 --> 00:17:27.838
It's very deep; it is because it is so narrow it is extremely deep.

00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:30.068
You have to widen to see.

00:17:30.568 --> 00:17:32.568
For example, you are standing on a well

00:17:32.706 --> 00:17:33.717
which is very narrow,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.953
and just hardly you can see anything inside,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.530
you can just see something flickering.

00:17:39.309 --> 00:17:42.111
To see the complete vision of that well

00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:43.963
you have to increase the narrowness of it,

00:17:47.073 --> 00:17:50.449
and that this we are not prepared to do because, you see Bible is the last one.

00:17:50.873 --> 00:17:52.873
Now I would say any other person

00:17:53.563 --> 00:17:55.500
would come and say, "what is the authority of Bible?",

00:17:55.515 --> 00:17:56.933
now what authority will you give?

00:17:57.627 --> 00:17:59.875
if say Christ is the authority of Bible. Take it like that,

00:18:00.223 --> 00:18:01.389
Christ never wrote Bible,

00:18:02.556 --> 00:18:06.128
He never wrote a word, so how you do connect?

00:18:07.028 --> 00:18:09.241
Could be some journalist, who could write about Him,

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:11.265
could be anything absurd.

00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:18.146
If they Hindu say the Gita,

00:18:19.884 --> 00:18:21.253
ask them "who wrote Gita?"

00:18:23.429 --> 00:18:26.832
Krishna never wrote Gita; never did he write it?

00:18:29.237 --> 00:18:30.529
So what is the authority of it?

00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:35.562
Nothing! Gita has no authority as such,

00:18:35.986 --> 00:18:38.860
how do you say that Gita was the one written by Krishna?

00:18:39.265 --> 00:18:42.039
He had nothing to do. Anybody, supposing you see me today

00:18:42.177 --> 00:18:44.969
and you write about me, you can write anything,

00:18:45.259 --> 00:18:46.212
anything you feel like,

00:18:48.255 --> 00:18:49.524
like a journalist came

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.203
just to sort of

00:18:51.341 --> 00:18:53.532
find false with me. She was paid by some fake guru

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:57.002
and she wrote that I eat betel nuts, which I have never eaten all my life

00:18:59.235 --> 00:19:01.820
I wish I could because that pleases some people,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.130
but I never eat I mean, I should have eaten but

00:19:04.325 --> 00:19:06.096
I never eat and she said that she saw

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:09.305
betel nut, I don't know from which angle she saw me eating betel nuts

00:19:11.252 --> 00:19:13.252
If she had written Bible about me

00:19:13.562 --> 00:19:15.293
it would have been something funny

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.965
than that is not the authority either.

00:19:20.541 --> 00:19:22.539
Moreover they did not have tape recorders to

00:19:22.553 --> 00:19:24.355
tape anybody's lectures or anything,

00:19:25.903 --> 00:19:27.660
even His photograph was not there,

00:19:27.663 --> 00:19:29.615
that is today all these things are available

00:19:31.077 --> 00:19:32.205
so what is the authority?

00:19:37.657 --> 00:19:39.657
This is the problem with us is that

00:19:39.719 --> 00:19:43.234
we accept certain thing as an authority because we think we can control

00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.507
people

00:19:46.502 --> 00:19:49.954
by this misappropriation of authority to ourselves.

00:19:54.949 --> 00:19:56.450
And there have been people who have said

00:19:56.645 --> 00:20:00.466
"I am the Christ". I said "alright, walk on the water"

00:20:00.973 --> 00:20:03.495
first sign of Christ is see will He walk on the water because

00:20:03.633 --> 00:20:05.860
He was Omkara itself, He is Omkara

00:20:05.998 --> 00:20:09.061
He can walk on it, He has no body as such He can walk on the water,

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.924
alright, "walk on the water", and first step

00:20:12.843 --> 00:20:14.611
maybe in the water, the second he will go down.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.231
All such hocus pocus could be found out. If somebody says

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.350
"that, you give me money I will make you fly",

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.852
let him go off this leaning tower of Pisa

00:20:24.352 --> 00:20:27.337
what it is meant for, after all it must be used also sometimes,

00:20:27.647 --> 00:20:29.857
and throw him down, see how far he goes with flying.

00:20:33.709 --> 00:20:35.043
Have a nice show for him.

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:39.568
That's how you can find out these people whether it happens or not.

00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:49.504
So this is how I find in this country also in wagon of negativity

00:20:50.556 --> 00:20:54.463
of these people who are here to spoil your chances of realization.

00:20:55.725 --> 00:20:58.127
And it's very difficult to give realization to people

00:20:58.398 --> 00:21:00.805
who have been to these people,

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:02.172
have been initiated,

00:21:02.481 --> 00:21:05.536
have been really spoiled in their Kundalini is rather difficult.

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:12.698
I have worked day in and day out to neutralize it,

00:21:14.874 --> 00:21:19.442
and I have been working. But the interest in your Self can only come

00:21:19.733 --> 00:21:21.330
when you will have self esteem

00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:25.341
that is very important and that is the center of Vishudhi chakra.

00:21:27.518 --> 00:21:27.923
This center.

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:31.680
I came up to the Heart chakra the other day

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.610
And now today I'm going to talk to you about the Vishudhi

00:21:36.591 --> 00:21:40.534
Vishudhi is this centre placed at the back of the backbone here

00:21:42.313 --> 00:21:44.835
which has given a human being a specialty,

00:21:45.775 --> 00:21:50.797
which separates him from animals, that he raises his head upward.

00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:54.242
By raising his head upward

00:21:56.076 --> 00:21:57.002
he has been able

00:22:01.807 --> 00:22:04.731
to create a new dimension for his brain.

00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:08.693
And this new dimension is a dimension by which

00:22:08.904 --> 00:22:10.669
he creates ego within himself.

00:22:15.694 --> 00:22:18.314
Before becoming a human being

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:24.328
I hope you can see all of you. Can I? Can you move this?

00:22:27.172 --> 00:22:29.198
Before becoming a human being

00:22:31.761 --> 00:22:33.097
your brain was flat

00:22:34.642 --> 00:22:36.642
and all covered with the super ego.

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:42.226
At the most like dogs, or you can say the horses,

00:22:42.726 --> 00:22:43.566
they have the super ego.

00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:51.356
And when you became a human being,

00:22:54.511 --> 00:22:57.268
a locking system took place by which

00:22:59.487 --> 00:23:03.009
you started developing, or you can say a twist took place by which

00:23:03.096 --> 00:23:05.096
you started developing your action.

00:23:06.628 --> 00:23:09.701
For example an animal

00:23:10.916 --> 00:23:14.128
does not know how to make a chair out of wood,

00:23:17.191 --> 00:23:17.758
an action

00:23:19.358 --> 00:23:23.100
physically, at the most it might carry this chair which is made,

00:23:23.545 --> 00:23:25.682
put it there and mimic you sit on that.

00:23:26.485 --> 00:23:29.062
but it cannot make anything with his hand

00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:34.769
maybe it can weave a small little nest or something like that

00:23:35.063 --> 00:23:37.063
for it to live at the most.

00:23:38.058 --> 00:23:43.948
So you with your action can overpower the matter.

00:23:45.934 --> 00:23:47.934
You have been able to achieve

00:23:49.287 --> 00:23:51.549
great heights in overpowering

00:23:53.438 --> 00:23:57.409
all the five elements by using them as

00:23:58.377 --> 00:24:00.473
power for your everyday use also

00:24:01.152 --> 00:24:04.661
like, electricity, magnetism, sound, everything, ether.

00:24:06.922 --> 00:24:07.408
But

00:24:12.145 --> 00:24:12.908
animals

00:24:15.196 --> 00:24:17.377
when they come in contact with human beings

00:24:18.358 --> 00:24:20.122
they also can be conditioned

00:24:21.805 --> 00:24:23.265
as far as

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.494
their understanding of relationship with human beings is concerned, but

00:24:27.554 --> 00:24:29.595
it is not that they could be made to act

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.097
on to some matter, and this

00:24:35.927 --> 00:24:37.542
action, the physical action

00:24:38.357 --> 00:24:40.042
has given a by-product

00:24:41.409 --> 00:24:42.859
which is called as ego.

00:24:44.106 --> 00:24:44.904
This is the beginning.

00:24:46.326 --> 00:24:48.326
Then the second action is

00:24:49.869 --> 00:24:50.468
the thinking.

00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:53.889
The animal doesn't think of the future,

00:24:54.689 --> 00:24:56.389
he doesn't have any insurances.

00:24:57.082 --> 00:24:59.082
Animal is not bothered about insurance,

00:24:59.692 --> 00:25:02.474
of what will happen to my great grandchildren when I die,

00:25:03.193 --> 00:25:09.325
what part of my house will be going to which of my children,

00:25:09.825 --> 00:25:11.825
he is not bothered about all these things

00:25:12.699 --> 00:25:14.325
and he does not even have

00:25:14.536 --> 00:25:16.689
such a sense of possession as human beings have,

00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:20.839
so it so happens

00:25:21.256 --> 00:25:23.256
that we start developing our ego

00:25:23.467 --> 00:25:25.467
when we start planning for the future,

00:25:25.541 --> 00:25:28.148
thinking of the future, going into the future

00:25:28.648 --> 00:25:32.190
and also when we use our physical being

00:25:32.346 --> 00:25:37.212
to create something or to do any physical work

00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:40.634
If an animal

00:25:42.017 --> 00:25:46.372
goes and attacks a cow or something, say a tiger,

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.962
and brings it home for his family,

00:25:52.462 --> 00:25:55.758
he is not proud, he is not egoistical like human beings are.

00:25:56.918 --> 00:25:59.568
While human beings, if they earn about say

00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:02.772
five hundred dollars they become very egoistical,

00:26:03.781 --> 00:26:05.781
they think we have earned such a lot of money

00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:09.660
and we have done so much, we have every right to dominate the wife

00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:10.772
and vice versa.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.047
But an animal doesn't think he has the right to dominate,

00:26:15.547 --> 00:26:20.420
see whatever he does in the nature of his own personality,

00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:24.978
he doesn't do it as an idea that he has to do this

00:26:25.175 --> 00:26:28.909
and he is very important and he doesn't have this ego,

00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:32.027
so he does not even think that this is karmas

00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:35.134
that I have to face for it and I have done something wrong

00:26:35.263 --> 00:26:39.164
I've killed a cow so I must go a Brahmin and pay him a lot of money

00:26:39.224 --> 00:26:40.615
"because I have done such a sin",

00:26:41.335 --> 00:26:43.873
these ideas do not come into the heads of an animal

00:26:44.951 --> 00:26:47.102
because he is not used to that dimension.

00:26:47.382 --> 00:26:50.577
A new dimension of karmas to which human beings are

00:26:50.857 --> 00:26:52.857
because of this two creations,

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.084
because of ego, you feel you have done bad karmas or good karmas

00:26:57.158 --> 00:26:59.158
if you had no ego you would never have felt that.

00:27:03.069 --> 00:27:05.069
These two things starts at this point

00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:07.416
and you see it very clearly should start from there

00:27:07.723 --> 00:27:10.849
but it's put down there, actually this start maneuvering

00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:12.604
from this point,

00:27:13.324 --> 00:27:16.190
and you start developing ego and super ego in your head

00:27:17.378 --> 00:27:20.053
and you developed a triangular brain

00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:25.205
a prism like brain and when such a brain has developed

00:27:25.969 --> 00:27:31.053
then a new problem starts that through this prism

00:27:32.007 --> 00:27:34.154
whatever energy passes into it

00:27:35.166 --> 00:27:36.598
most of it goes out

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.714
according to the parallelogram of forces

00:27:40.726 --> 00:27:42.726
that I have no time just now to tell you.

00:27:43.226 --> 00:27:46.279
Because of that your attention is all the time outside

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.130
you can only do something outside

00:27:49.381 --> 00:27:51.115
you cannot take your attention inside.

00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:53.808
Now supposing I say, "you put your attention inside"

00:27:54.689 --> 00:27:56.738
because you have to go inside you cannot do it

00:27:57.792 --> 00:27:59.009
you just can't do it.

00:27:59.509 --> 00:28:01.039
your attention is always outside

00:28:01.173 --> 00:28:03.599
"I have to do this this, I have to go there, I have to get it"

00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:06.540
But you cannot put your attention inside, that's not possible.

00:28:07.889 --> 00:28:10.727
I cannot just order you that you put your attention inside,

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:13.624
some happening has to take place within you.

00:28:14.124 --> 00:28:17.184
Supposing something is suddenly falls of then your attention goes there

00:28:17.684 --> 00:28:20.914
In the same way when the happening of the Kundalini awakening takes place,

00:28:21.414 --> 00:28:26.441
then your attention goes through that

00:28:26.765 --> 00:28:30.121
which is awakened there and you just start seeing the awakening,

00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:32.266
or, you can say, the feel the awakening,

00:28:33.438 --> 00:28:34.811
but it is such a quick thing,

00:28:35.825 --> 00:28:36.772
a split of a second,

00:28:37.272 --> 00:28:38.650
that sometimes you miss everything

00:28:38.683 --> 00:28:41.507
except that you see the cool breeze has started flowing through you.

00:28:42.768 --> 00:28:44.624
Sometimes you do feel, it's here,

00:28:44.852 --> 00:28:46.938
it's here, so many people feel that way also

00:28:47.438 --> 00:28:49.808
it's come up now, and it's here throbbing,

00:28:50.094 --> 00:28:52.223
now its alright, it has started working.

00:28:53.209 --> 00:28:56.053
It depends on what sort of runway you have,

00:28:56.696 --> 00:28:58.127
if the runway is horrid,

00:28:59.398 --> 00:29:03.249
then you see you go on feeling all the bumps and the dumps and everything.

00:29:04.263 --> 00:29:06.575
Sometimes the runways are so badly spoiled

00:29:08.204 --> 00:29:11.974
that it takes sometimes months for the Kundalini to rise,

00:29:13.188 --> 00:29:14.204
but now I think

00:29:15.218 --> 00:29:18.117
in Sahaja Yoga we have developed such methods and techniques,

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.260
of such permutations and combinations,

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.182
that nowadays it's much easier to raise the Kundalini

00:29:24.282 --> 00:29:27.249
than it was, about say, ten years back.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.852
Then I had about twenty disciples

00:29:33.006 --> 00:29:35.606
with whom I worked for two years to give them realization.

00:29:36.249 --> 00:29:39.847
In London I had six disciples for four years I have worked on them

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.657
to give them realization. But today we have thousands in UK

00:29:43.943 --> 00:29:45.943
and we have lots of them in Sydney also

00:29:46.043 --> 00:29:47.757
And in India also we have thousands.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.342
Where they just get it in a second,

00:29:51.542 --> 00:29:54.259
but it is a different thing now because it has evolved so well.

00:29:56.016 --> 00:29:58.160
But this happening is a living happening,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.108
this you cannot do, you can jump, you can stand on your heads

00:30:02.151 --> 00:30:05.925
take off your clothes, wear some badges, wear some clothes, you can do all that

00:30:06.696 --> 00:30:07.700
but you cannot make

00:30:07.699 --> 00:30:10.918
the Kundalini rise in the sense you see the pulsation there at the

00:30:11.001 --> 00:30:13.290
triangular bone, you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini there,

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.779
actual pulsation, you can see the rising of the Kundalini.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.258
You see it.

00:30:19.501 --> 00:30:21.889
You also feel the cool breeze rising,

00:30:22.603 --> 00:30:28.957
you can also with a stethoscope feel the sound, lap lap lap lap

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.578
coming up to here which Kabir has very clearly said

00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:34.849
/?/

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.694
at the apex of the /?/ zero apex of your head.

00:30:42.194 --> 00:30:46.216
You hear first the anahata. Anahata is this

00:30:46.359 --> 00:30:48.446
sound of the heart without percussion,

00:30:49.775 --> 00:30:52.060
and that is how you feel the Kundalini there

00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:54.694
and then it breaks through you feel it

00:30:54.794 --> 00:30:56.794
actually on your fingers,

00:30:56.865 --> 00:30:58.865
it is an actualization of the experience.

00:30:59.365 --> 00:31:01.365
This is what the baptism is.

00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:06.177
When Warren said that

00:31:06.334 --> 00:31:08.334
you have never had your real baptism,

00:31:08.563 --> 00:31:09.414
do not be angry.

00:31:11.214 --> 00:31:12.058
Because it is a fact,

00:31:13.287 --> 00:31:15.501
you have not got your realization.

00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:19.583
Christ has said that you have to be born again, hundred times He said,

00:31:20.154 --> 00:31:22.154
so now they are started saying we are born again,

00:31:22.654 --> 00:31:23.976
it's again self certification.

00:31:24.762 --> 00:31:26.559
First of all is to use your baptism,

00:31:26.773 --> 00:31:29.586
now there is this another thing started, that we are born again.

00:31:31.143 --> 00:31:35.181
Now they come and ask, these people they change from one to another.

00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:38.848
That how is it through Christ,

00:31:40.719 --> 00:31:42.732
you have to get trough and you will see,

00:31:42.749 --> 00:31:44.624
only in Sahaja Yoga you will understand that,

00:31:44.661 --> 00:31:47.998
ultimately you have to pass through the gate of Christ only,

00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:50.966
to enter into the Kingdom of God. It is a fact,

00:31:51.466 --> 00:31:53.251
what He said, He never told lies.

00:31:54.537 --> 00:31:56.537
He told the complete truth,

00:31:57.037 --> 00:31:59.887
nothing but the truth. But the way you interpret it,

00:32:00.087 --> 00:32:02.174
the way you understand it, it is so narrow,

00:32:02.674 --> 00:32:04.232
that you do not want to accept it.

00:32:07.016 --> 00:32:10.535
This is the gate about which He has talked

00:32:11.406 --> 00:32:13.867
and this is the greatest thing He has done to us.

00:32:15.853 --> 00:32:21.276
Now this Vishudhi chakra is the centre of Shri Krishna.

00:32:22.247 --> 00:32:24.247
If I say this is the centre of Shri Krishna

00:32:25.233 --> 00:32:27.390
you may start doubting me.

00:32:27.504 --> 00:32:28.682
You should doubt me also,

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:32.866
it is not problem, with Indians because they know it is the centre,

00:32:33.888 --> 00:32:36.444
they know about centres they know where Krishna resides.

00:32:37.315 --> 00:32:39.586
and they know there are sixteen petals to this

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.697
and that they know that he is

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:45.476
called as the complete incarnation of the sixteen petals, and all that they know,

00:32:45.676 --> 00:32:47.676
I do not have to quarrel with them.

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:52.474
And the centre here of Christ

00:32:52.588 --> 00:32:55.421
is actually a little bit confusing because it is called as Mahavishnu.

00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:59.344
In Indians literature is called as Mahavishnu,

00:32:59.844 --> 00:33:02.646
not as Christ, and He is also

00:33:03.375 --> 00:33:06.329
is Bodha not Buddha, but Bodha,

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.600
which they got a little bit confused

00:33:09.644 --> 00:33:15.569
in our old scriptures it is a difference of language.

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:19.328
In one of my lectures on Christ

00:33:19.828 --> 00:33:21.828
you will find out about His origin,

00:33:22.085 --> 00:33:25.151
why He was called Jesus, why He was called Christ

00:33:25.651 --> 00:33:29.335
and what is the origin of these things,

00:33:29.477 --> 00:33:31.953
why He arrived, who was His mother

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:36.164
and everything you will find out from that lecture that I have got for you.

00:33:36.893 --> 00:33:38.994
It is better that you go through that lecture

00:33:39.152 --> 00:33:41.500
and see for yourself. We have lots of these tapes

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.062
already in Sydney they can sent it over to you, you can look at it

00:33:47.276 --> 00:33:49.276
from that angle I mean in this

00:33:49.433 --> 00:33:54.102
small little time I cannot elaborately talk about Krishna,

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:56.070
and about Christ,

00:33:56.985 --> 00:33:59.822
but the only thing I have to tell that

00:33:59.893 --> 00:34:02.280
there is a very great relationship between both of them,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.204
and Krist is the word that comes from the word Krishna,

00:34:06.888 --> 00:34:08.704
and Kist in India is means

00:34:09.004 --> 00:34:10.717
the agriculture and Krishna

00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:14.112
also come from Krishi which also means agriculture.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.731
Agriculture means the one where you sow,

00:34:18.059 --> 00:34:24.911
and they are the sowers of the seed. They have sown the seed in the fields.

00:34:26.455 --> 00:34:32.014
So the sowing of the seed is done by Shri Krishna,

00:34:32.314 --> 00:34:34.314
and the Gita that he has described

00:34:34.499 --> 00:34:38.602
is also another very interesting thing about which we are very much confused.

00:34:40.289 --> 00:34:44.354
Krishna never wrote Gita, first of all,

00:34:44.854 --> 00:34:49.198
it was never written by an absolute Brahmin or anything who was a born brahmin,

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.458
it was written by the illegitimate child of a fisher woman.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:35:01.636
How can he write, a man like that that you are born as a Brahmin

00:35:02.966 --> 00:35:06.217
you are to be born as a Brahmin what he was meaning,

00:35:06.717 --> 00:35:08.717
that when you are born as a Brahmin

00:35:09.374 --> 00:35:11.489
then you have the aptitude to see God.

00:35:11.532 --> 00:35:13.989
For example you are all Brahmins in his own words.

00:35:14.117 --> 00:35:15.714
That means you are the seekers of God,

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:18.618
all the seekers of God are Brahmins

00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:21.178
and the seekers of power are /?/,

00:35:21.478 --> 00:35:24.982
and the seekers of money are /?/,

00:35:25.625 --> 00:35:30.288
it meant the aptitude, but Hindus as usual

00:35:30.988 --> 00:35:34.896
have made like all others, have made a mess of all that philosophy.

00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:38.097
According to them if you are born a Brahmin,

00:35:38.368 --> 00:35:42.209
even if you are the greatest crook of the world, you are a Brahmin.

00:35:44.783 --> 00:35:48.798
And even if you are a person who is a

00:35:50.056 --> 00:35:52.685
very highly evolved person, if you are not

00:35:53.071 --> 00:35:55.387
born in a Brahmin family, then you are good for nothing.

00:35:57.518 --> 00:36:01.125
This caste system is such a horrible thing in India,

00:36:01.482 --> 00:36:04.344
which has no explanation at all in the scriptures because

00:36:04.844 --> 00:36:07.580
it is written that in everyone resides the spirit,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.080
there is spirit in everyone of you,

00:36:10.365 --> 00:36:12.693
how can you have caste system you can have aptitudes,

00:36:13.865 --> 00:36:17.386
but as usual people have escapes for everything,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.561
this point that everybody has the spirit within yourself.

00:36:22.061 --> 00:36:27.108
Gita has described it, that everyone has the spirit within,

00:36:27.808 --> 00:36:31.421
but one has to know when he says there is spirit within you

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:35.542
that means his meaning the human being have the spirit, not the devils.

00:36:37.644 --> 00:36:42.068
Because Krishna himself has killed so many devils in his lifetime,

00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:44.905
his one of the powers was /?/, means killing

00:36:45.276 --> 00:36:48.235
He used to kill so many devils so there are devils also

00:36:49.164 --> 00:36:51.820
on this principle that there is spirit in everybody

00:36:51.848 --> 00:36:53.977
why did he kill so many devils?

00:36:54.305 --> 00:36:56.257
The devils do not have spirit in them.

00:36:56.875 --> 00:36:58.875
There are devils, and devils and devils,

00:36:59.189 --> 00:37:01.189
for example say, Hitler

00:37:01.373 --> 00:37:03.861
if he comes to ask for a realisation,

00:37:04.061 --> 00:37:06.061
do you think he can get it or he should get it?

00:37:07.434 --> 00:37:11.268
His greatest reward would be

00:37:12.512 --> 00:37:15.245
a rigorous imprisonment into hell

00:37:15.745 --> 00:37:17.745
or all his lives to come.

00:37:25.283 --> 00:37:31.055
how can you be so sure that he wasn't Krishna casting out devils, more devils?

00:37:32.217 --> 00:37:33.002
he was not

00:37:33.183 --> 00:37:38.549
how can you be so sure that Hitler was not Krishna casting out devils?

00:37:40.068 --> 00:37:43.119
For that you must get your realization. That's why,

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:46.634
you see, the surety will only will come then you become your absolute.

00:37:47.134 --> 00:37:48.392
Just now, you cannot be sure.

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:51.712
For example I'll tell you, when you get your realization,

00:37:51.854 --> 00:37:55.234
you get your vibrations, alright? Now with these vibrations

00:37:55.463 --> 00:37:58.039
you can find out what is true and what is not true.

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:00.070
Now you may say this maybe is all the myth.

00:38:01.017 --> 00:38:04.742
For example we had some Brahmins in one of the programs I had first arranged,

00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:07.892
and I didn't know they had a fight with this organizers

00:38:08.106 --> 00:38:11.445
but they said, "She is not a Brahmin, how can have they a program here", or something like that.

00:38:11.945 --> 00:38:13.188
And they were sitting in the front row

00:38:13.366 --> 00:38:15.977
I did not know that they had a quarrel I just asked them

00:38:16.477 --> 00:38:17.846
I said,

00:38:19.705 --> 00:38:25.381
"who is Brahmin among you, who thinks he is a Brahmin, just come forward",

00:38:25.738 --> 00:38:30.110
so five, six of them, you see, like great wrestlers came and sat before me,

00:38:30.324 --> 00:38:32.324
I said "alright please be seated" very arrogant

00:38:32.591 --> 00:38:35.654
I said "sit down", I said "put your hands towards me like this"

00:38:36.601 --> 00:38:38.601
and they started shaking their hands,

00:38:39.602 --> 00:38:42.105
they got little frightened. I said, "why are you shaking?",

00:38:42.605 --> 00:38:46.413
they said, "because we are Brahmins, and you are the power, that's why we are shaking."

00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:48.609
I said, see your neighbors, "they are also shaking"

00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:51.745
"yes yes they are also shaking, they might be also Brahmins."

00:38:52.138 --> 00:38:53.417
I said, "please ask them what are they",

00:38:53.971 --> 00:38:57.585
they are some people, they said "these are the people who had come from a lunatic asylum".

00:39:00.894 --> 00:39:03.094
These were the only two people where shaking there,

00:39:03.594 --> 00:39:05.594
I said "now relatively you can see now

00:39:06.398 --> 00:39:12.657
that when you thought you are the Brahmin, you are mad too to believe into such a thing".

00:39:14.123 --> 00:39:16.249
Now to believe that Hitler was also good,

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.160
is a typical sign of escaping,

00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:22.770
in life horrible things,

00:39:26.794 --> 00:39:31.417
you see, just to have an idea that everything is fine,

00:39:31.632 --> 00:39:33.935
is the best way of jumping into the devils' den.

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:40.769
And that's what has happened with people, that they never doubted anyone.

00:39:41.859 --> 00:39:44.524
And I don't know from where do people get these ideas

00:39:44.684 --> 00:39:46.987
everybody's life, even Christ,

00:39:47.881 --> 00:39:50.663
he too a hinter in His hand and He was whipping all the people.

00:39:53.542 --> 00:39:57.160
He was love, He was compassion, no doubt, but He did whip them,

00:39:58.071 --> 00:40:00.942
He also said that "don't throw pearls before the swines".

00:40:02.158 --> 00:40:06.237
His compassion had a special purpose, which I will tell you just now, why

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.737
He got himself crucified also,

00:40:08.987 --> 00:40:10.574
which is a very important thing,

00:40:10.949 --> 00:40:14.685
but when we just say that everything is fine, everything is good,

00:40:15.793 --> 00:40:18.325
the reason is we do not want to face the reality.

00:40:20.256 --> 00:40:23.932
Because, perhaps maybe we cannot understand

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:25.680
that there could be anything bad,

00:40:26.717 --> 00:40:28.663
but after realization, you will discover

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.020
that yourself there are problems,

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.437
yourself there is something wrong with you, leave alone others!

00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:39.085
There are problems within you which you have not seen and faced.

00:40:39.835 --> 00:40:43.974
Perhaps there are problems within you, which you have not wanted to see in others

00:40:44.295 --> 00:40:46.654
because then you will not be able to justify them.

00:40:47.189 --> 00:40:49.350
But after realization you get out of yourself.

00:40:49.725 --> 00:40:50.986
Like this sari I am wearing,

00:40:51.486 --> 00:40:52.984
if I am not identified with it,

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:55.396
I see a spot I would like to clean it,

00:40:55.966 --> 00:40:57.384
I see it I want to clean it

00:40:57.797 --> 00:40:59.797
I don't say it is a good thing to have the spots there,

00:41:00.193 --> 00:41:02.193
but supposing I am identified, I'll hide it.

00:41:02.972 --> 00:41:05.423
I'll say, "oh, there's nothing, nothing wrong, everything is alright".

00:41:09.082 --> 00:41:11.362
There are evil doers, not one,

00:41:11.548 --> 00:41:15.611
but so many these days, that you have not at all any idea, if you had

00:41:15.727 --> 00:41:17.164
you would not have lost so much.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.486
Beg pardon.

00:41:25.644 --> 00:41:30.546
Would you be able to just leave your questions till the end. Mataji will invite questions at the end.

00:41:30.557 --> 00:41:30.976
Alright?

00:41:33.937 --> 00:41:35.937
Now the thing is

00:41:36.437 --> 00:41:39.832
whatever happens to us in our consciousness,

00:41:40.786 --> 00:41:43.174
is only limited to our human awareness,

00:41:44.459 --> 00:41:46.581
whatever we see in our human awareness,

00:41:46.854 --> 00:41:49.593
at the time when Krishna came, we got our human awareness,

00:41:50.826 --> 00:41:53.479
in that what do we have? only two points,

00:41:54.276 --> 00:41:57.611
one is our super ego, which is our conditioning,

00:41:58.373 --> 00:41:59.619
another is our ego,

00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:03.263
which we have achieved as a myth that

00:42:03.763 --> 00:42:07.918
we have done this, I am this, I am that, I like this, you like this.

00:42:09.448 --> 00:42:12.454
So we are only two things, either super ego, or ego.

00:42:13.734 --> 00:42:15.566
We wobble between the two.

00:42:15.803 --> 00:42:21.833
The third thing, which should be within us, is our spirit in the heart.

00:42:23.171 --> 00:42:28.452
And for that the central point is the point, by which we balance,

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:31.938
between these two, between the desire and the action.

00:42:34.096 --> 00:42:40.050
We go on balancing in the center, by understanding what is the best.

00:42:40.114 --> 00:42:41.707
For example a person drinks a lot,

00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:44.019
he kills himself by drinking.

00:42:44.624 --> 00:42:46.624
He certainly not read any book

00:42:46.949 --> 00:42:49.661
to know that drinking is bad, he knows that this is bad

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:51.653
his father is killed because of drinking, so

00:42:52.005 --> 00:42:58.736
he takes a life which is very much with moderation towards it.

00:42:59.428 --> 00:43:01.934
You start learning by so many experiences,

00:43:02.434 --> 00:43:06.708
right and wrong, how to be in the centre, that's all you can learn with human awarenes,

00:43:06.894 --> 00:43:09.362
if you can only learn how to be in the centre.

00:43:11.921 --> 00:43:14.112
Now, you have to go beyond this human awareness

00:43:15.082 --> 00:43:16.612
to be the awareness of the spirit,

00:43:17.967 --> 00:43:20.073
and when you become the awareness of the spirit,

00:43:20.957 --> 00:43:22.328
that you should become

00:43:23.055 --> 00:43:26.060
that you should ask for, that should be our goal,

00:43:27.258 --> 00:43:30.865
when you become that then the whole picture becomes different.

00:43:32.063 --> 00:43:35.033
Because you can feel it yourself, and understand

00:43:35.708 --> 00:43:37.120
what is right and wrong.

00:43:37.428 --> 00:43:40.413
On your vibratory awareness, which is a new dimension within you.

00:43:42.135 --> 00:43:46.143
Even children. Say, take ten children who are realized souls.

00:43:46.887 --> 00:43:49.114
If you ask them what is the matter with another person,

00:43:51.254 --> 00:43:53.952
they will immediately raise the same finger and say this is the matter.

00:43:54.906 --> 00:43:57.045
And you ask the person "have you got a very bad

00:43:57.073 --> 00:43:59.545
cold, cough or something bronchitis", and he will say, "yes".

00:44:02.366 --> 00:44:05.332
If this hand is shows that means all the left side,

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.376
that means he suffering from emotional trouble.

00:44:08.138 --> 00:44:11.711
You do not know anything about your chakras at all before realization.

00:44:13.939 --> 00:44:16.409
One must accept this one has to accept

00:44:16.752 --> 00:44:19.956
whatever it is there is nothing wrong in it, it is only your ego which stops that,

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:20.874
not accepting.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.852
And then once you get your realization you start feeling your

00:44:26.352 --> 00:44:29.587
different centres, you start feeling it actually you start feeling it

00:44:30.362 --> 00:44:32.762
and you start feeling the centres of others.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.430
Anyone who wants to know whether this person is evil or not

00:44:36.529 --> 00:44:38.096
is only to ask the question

00:44:38.195 --> 00:44:41.239
and you can feel it, you can't even bear some of those,

00:44:42.681 --> 00:44:44.328
horrible vibrations you get from people.

00:44:44.968 --> 00:44:47.304
Some of the Sahaja yogis try for

00:44:48.153 --> 00:44:50.378
asking for some devilish people and they got

00:44:50.424 --> 00:44:52.988
actual blisters, especially Mr. Hitler,

00:44:53.226 --> 00:44:54.187
whom you are supporting now.

00:44:58.003 --> 00:45:01.124
actual blisters on a finger, actual blisters.

00:45:02.008 --> 00:45:04.501
This is what it is. After realization

00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:08.070
your real absolute self comes in because you become spirit

00:45:08.169 --> 00:45:09.041
which is in the heart.

00:45:10.937 --> 00:45:12.397
The spirit resides in the heart

00:45:13.298 --> 00:45:15.298
but this is the place of its' seat.

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:16.798
There are seven seats in the head,

00:45:17.734 --> 00:45:20.552
and the seat of the spirit is here.

00:45:20.703 --> 00:45:23.494
When the Kundalini goes, it is just a very

00:45:23.819 --> 00:45:26.973
small thread of Kundalini rises because there are lots of problems

00:45:27.229 --> 00:45:30.694
and a very small through the Brahma nadi, the centre most

00:45:31.072 --> 00:45:34.204
channel, which rises and opens this

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:36.620
when it opens it the grace comes down,

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.505
and when the grace comes down

00:45:39.005 --> 00:45:41.888
you get completely relaxed, because it falls on the both the sides

00:45:42.388 --> 00:45:48.136
on the ida and pingala nadi, which are manifesting our left and right
sympathetic nervous system.

00:45:50.346 --> 00:45:54.091
By which you first feel relaxed, thoughtless, and then

00:45:54.382 --> 00:45:56.382
when it is little bit established

00:45:56.568 --> 00:45:58.342
you start feeling the cool breeze,

00:45:58.446 --> 00:46:00.842
because your spirit has started manifesting

00:46:01.028 --> 00:46:03.363
and you just feel a cool breeze,

00:46:03.863 --> 00:46:05.372
like a wind coming into you.

00:46:05.872 --> 00:46:07.872
First you may feel tingling, heat,

00:46:07.936 --> 00:46:09.185
all that is going out,

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:12.404
sometimes people a little bit shake also, because if the nerves are not

00:46:14.488 --> 00:46:15.644
properly built up,

00:46:15.708 --> 00:46:18.213
if they do not have the strength to bear it,

00:46:18.538 --> 00:46:22.378
then it sometimes happens that you shake a little bit, doesn't matter.

00:46:22.878 --> 00:46:24.911
after some time you start sustaining it.

00:46:25.248 --> 00:46:27.478
It takes time in some people

00:46:27.978 --> 00:46:29.978
in some people it doesn't take time at all.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:34.617
It is the quality of your central path of Sushumna is important.

00:46:35.117 --> 00:46:38.396
If it is very simple,

00:46:38.948 --> 00:46:41.827
there is no problem, then the Kundalini takes no time

00:46:41.911 --> 00:46:44.327
She is anxiously waiting, She is your mother,

00:46:45.281 --> 00:46:48.101
She is the pure desire within you, the power

00:46:48.252 --> 00:46:50.497
to become one with your spirit.

00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:54.168
Unless and until you achieve it, whatever you may try,

00:46:54.267 --> 00:46:56.548
you do anything you like, you spoil your Sushumna,

00:46:57.048 --> 00:47:00.686
but you'll have to get it otherwise your seeking will not be over,

00:47:01.535 --> 00:47:04.173
you have to reach the place where you should say "I have found it."

00:47:04.952 --> 00:47:07.979
If you have not found the spirit,

00:47:08.479 --> 00:47:12.224
you will never be happy with anything sort of thing you do.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.756
Anything you do. Be kind to yourself.

00:47:16.256 --> 00:47:19.338
Be gracious to yourself and get your realization.

00:47:19.594 --> 00:47:22.255
This is the simple thing as a mother I would like to tell you.

00:47:23.401 --> 00:47:26.394
There is nothing to be done except by getting realisation.

00:47:26.754 --> 00:47:28.101
But if you are an adamant person,

00:47:28.601 --> 00:47:31.234
and if you are employed by some of the gurus to come here,

00:47:31.594 --> 00:47:33.345
or you are running a

00:47:33.618 --> 00:47:36.924
lawyers job for other gurus and all that, you cannot get realization.

00:47:37.826 --> 00:47:40.652
I am sorry if you cannot get it, I cannot help it.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.247
But you have to identify with yourself

00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:45.485
and see to it that you want to have it

00:47:45.653 --> 00:47:48.603
then only you will get it, if you do not have a desire to have it

00:47:48.823 --> 00:47:51.105
you will not get it, at any cost.

00:47:52.129 --> 00:47:53.754
You are not to be forced into it,

00:47:54.034 --> 00:47:56.248
your freedom is completely respected.

00:47:57.675 --> 00:48:00.510
If your freedom is not respected, how are you going to enjoy

00:48:00.574 --> 00:48:02.309
the freedom of your spirit.

00:48:02.896 --> 00:48:07.499
So it is completely in your hands, to be free

00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:10.872
to accept, whether to get realization or not.

00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:14.576
Now this chakra of Vishudhi is very important

00:48:15.531 --> 00:48:19.221
because there are sixteen sub-plexuses which are looked after by it,

00:48:19.319 --> 00:48:21.319
for example ear, nose, throat,

00:48:21.819 --> 00:48:27.422
all these things are looked after by this centre of Shri Krishna,

00:48:28.936 --> 00:48:34.217
and this centre has got two sides, one is the left, and one is the right side,

00:48:36.255 --> 00:48:39.904
I have to talk about it because most of the people in the West

00:48:40.177 --> 00:48:42.670
somehow suffer from the left Vishudhi,

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:45.170
one of them is the reason maybe smoking,

00:48:46.334 --> 00:48:50.042
right is more affected by smoking, but later on it goes to the left also.

00:48:50.769 --> 00:48:53.401
But I think. The more important is that,

00:48:54.216 --> 00:48:57.413
you people have developed a theory, I don't know how,

00:48:57.721 --> 00:48:59.880
that you have to be guilty for everything.

00:49:00.642 --> 00:49:02.642
Maybe it is from your childhood,

00:49:03.422 --> 00:49:06.940
you are brought up this way, don't spoil the carpet, don't spoil that,

00:49:07.125 --> 00:49:09.125
don't do this and don't do that,

00:49:09.415 --> 00:49:12.976
maybe your confessions in the churches maybe, I don't know what to blame

00:49:13.266 --> 00:49:18.380
but it is a very good indulgence for people to sit down "so I shouldn’t have done this

00:49:18.425 --> 00:49:22.127
I should not have done that" criticizing yourself and analyzing yourself.

00:49:24.393 --> 00:49:27.768
This is also a very good escape of egoistical people.

00:49:29.474 --> 00:49:32.412
They are egoistical they dominate others,

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.774
and then they sit down and weep on their left Vishudhi.

00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:38.359
This left Vishudhi is such a dangerous thing,

00:49:39.104 --> 00:49:43.106
that it creates problems of the worst nature in human beings.

00:49:43.606 --> 00:49:47.019
For example, if you have say,

00:49:47.519 --> 00:49:49.519
any cancerous growth within you

00:49:49.757 --> 00:49:53.399
and if you have left Vishudhi, it is going to be difficult to cure you.

00:49:53.963 --> 00:49:58.194
Because the escape of the Kundalini has to be through the Vishudhi chakra,

00:49:58.287 --> 00:50:03.006
and the Vishudhi chakra on left hand side is very

00:50:03.056 --> 00:50:06.766
important for the escape of all these tensions of the cancer.

00:50:06.891 --> 00:50:10.784
And if you have this kind of a bad habit of sitting down and indulging

00:50:10.834 --> 00:50:14.903
into this kind of a nonsensical thing, like sitting down like Lord Byron

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:19.871
and reading some sort of a tragedy and making it a tragedy out of you, it is a drama going on!

00:50:19.971 --> 00:50:24.070
What is there to be tragic about you? What is wrong with you?

00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:28.422
You are very rich people, you have everything, still why do you want to cry and weep

00:50:28.497 --> 00:50:32.086
all the time you are in a crying mood, why? God has given you so much.

00:50:33.114 --> 00:50:36.845
do you ever said that, count your blessings one by one?

00:50:37.441 --> 00:50:41.361
How many blessings you have got? You don't know. You are specially blessed people, especially

00:50:41.436 --> 00:50:45.398
in this Australia, I think you are specially blessed. But you want to show that you are

00:50:45.473 --> 00:50:48.986
extremely miserable. The worst at this are the French I would say.

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:50.903
Because when I went to France, they said,

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:54.394
"Mother never say that you are a happy person because they will think you are not sensitive",

00:50:54.623 --> 00:50:55.589
I said, "Really?",

00:50:57.568 --> 00:51:01.475
you think this French are very sensitive people, to what?

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.921
Not to holiness,

00:51:04.692 --> 00:51:05.666
not to purity,

00:51:06.166 --> 00:51:09.779
they are sensitive to God knows what. Ten feet you walk and you find a prostitute

00:51:09.862 --> 00:51:10.788
standing on the road,

00:51:12.371 --> 00:51:16.180
and about ten feet you walk and you find three alcoholics lying on the street,

00:51:16.534 --> 00:51:19.508
these are sensitive people? Are they sensitive to their spirit?

00:51:19.654 --> 00:51:22.336
What are they sensitive to? And what are the crying about?

00:51:22.565 --> 00:51:25.191
This a very good thing that in the night you drink a lot,

00:51:25.399 --> 00:51:27.963
sleep with ten women and in the morning you feel guilty.

00:51:30.255 --> 00:51:32.858
Who has asked them to go into this kind of a mess

00:51:33.025 --> 00:51:37.309
and then to come and sit down and cry "Oh I'm so guilty, I have done so wrong and so wrong."

00:51:38.622 --> 00:51:42.017
That is why I have to talk about it, that this centre,

00:51:42.163 --> 00:51:46.209
is very important also because it is the sister of Shri Krishna,

00:51:46.272 --> 00:51:47.876
Vishnumaya who rules it.

00:51:48.876 --> 00:51:50.876
The relationship between brother and sister

00:51:51.043 --> 00:51:54.151
is absolutely gone haven in this country.

00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:55.686
In all the Western countries,

00:51:55.874 --> 00:51:57.874
for us Indians we do not understand,

00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.347
really we cannot understand.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.058
And we cannot explain what it is, the other day only

00:52:02.183 --> 00:52:03.741
we had a very interesting talk,

00:52:03.845 --> 00:52:05.845
because two Indians have come with me, very

00:52:06.012 --> 00:52:07.397
very great Sahaja yogis they are,

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:09.308
they said "Mother, why did you say

00:52:09.412 --> 00:52:12.505
why did they said, that the girl cannot hold the hand of a girl?"

00:52:13.943 --> 00:52:17.200
I said, "you won't understand." They said, "no, no, but we would like know,

00:52:17.263 --> 00:52:20.200
we went to say we should close all our girls' schools

00:52:20.221 --> 00:52:21.505
girls schools in India?

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:25.601
I mean a girl can easily hold the hand of a girl, it is much better."

00:52:25.643 --> 00:52:26.372
I said " why

00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:29.846
this people say, you see is rather difficult for you to understand."

00:52:30.257 --> 00:52:32.257
Now, he said, "but one thing I can't understand

00:52:32.757 --> 00:52:38.254
that if a girl holds the hand of a man will that be a holier relationship?"

00:52:39.571 --> 00:52:40.445
See the accept.

00:52:42.049 --> 00:52:43.497
They think will it be holy

00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:46.559
to hold the hand of a man, it won't be.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:50.278
But the girl is a holy relationships.

00:52:50.937 --> 00:52:52.937
To this holy relationship is lost,

00:52:53.702 --> 00:52:56.928
in the so called ventures of the brains, you see

00:52:57.088 --> 00:53:00.299
like, you see if you go and see

00:53:01.192 --> 00:53:03.608
the zoo. If there is a wombat,

00:53:04.108 --> 00:53:06.365
it behaves like a wombat, you see,

00:53:06.865 --> 00:53:09.099
if there is a monkey, it behaves like a monkey,

00:53:09.429 --> 00:53:12.509
if there is a tiger, it behaves like a tiger,

00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:14.564
but a human being if you put him in the zoo,

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.486
you will see, he will eat up all the fruits,

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.047
he will cut down all the trees, he will go to all the depths of it,

00:53:23.377 --> 00:53:27.259
and he will break his nose, he will lose his ears,

00:53:27.377 --> 00:53:31.156
he will spoil his eyes, he cannot sit quietly.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:35.307
You will give him a tree, he will eat the fruit,

00:53:37.272 --> 00:53:38.951
he will eat the seed

00:53:39.164 --> 00:53:41.037
he will have a bark inside himself,

00:53:41.166 --> 00:53:43.060
he will have all the roots inside himself,

00:53:43.188 --> 00:53:47.514
he will do whatever is possible, it's so horrid with this brain the way it is moving,

00:53:47.653 --> 00:53:50.205
all the time in this direction, that direction, that direction

00:53:50.397 --> 00:53:52.397
it wants to bang on all the sights.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:53.252
For what?

00:53:54.505 --> 00:53:57.285
it cannot sit right, you see, when he is sitting

00:53:58.337 --> 00:54:01.426
for five minutes he thinks it is a jail, it is so boring,

00:54:01.491 --> 00:54:03.702
so he must go and do something very important.

00:54:03.788 --> 00:54:06.012
And what is the important thing he does?

00:54:06.098 --> 00:54:08.098
Is to really ruin himself.

00:54:08.513 --> 00:54:11.624
He must go to a pub, he must go to a friend,

00:54:11.901 --> 00:54:13.208
he must go somewhere

00:54:13.326 --> 00:54:15.876
he will really ruin himself for his holiness

00:54:15.973 --> 00:54:17.603
and all his sense of self esteem.

00:54:19.355 --> 00:54:22.704
That's why we have no sense as to what is a sister.

00:54:23.618 --> 00:54:25.820
the relationship of a sister with other women.

00:54:26.957 --> 00:54:32.477
This is so much missing that to talk about it in England was impossible; they said this is a Victorian

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.116
even an early lady talking

00:54:34.328 --> 00:54:37.520
you see, they brand it, you are Victorian, you are Georgian

00:54:37.604 --> 00:54:41.033
or you are...anyway everything moves according to the kings that rule that

00:54:41.192 --> 00:54:42.015
horrible England

00:54:42.185 --> 00:54:45.113
and the kings themselves being so horrible,

00:54:46.596 --> 00:54:49.440
and the kings themselves were such horrible things.

00:54:49.527 --> 00:54:51.527
I mean. I don't know how they were for them.

00:54:51.693 --> 00:54:54.998
So you are branded a Georgian or this or that,

00:54:55.085 --> 00:54:58.417
whatever you say, they cannot see the integration of anything,

00:54:58.524 --> 00:55:02.472
they just, one center they will catch "oh this is absolutely Victorian",

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:05.333
I said "alright, doesn't matter, but is good

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:09.558
whether you like it or not". As if Victorian everything to be condemned,

00:55:09.822 --> 00:55:11.822
there must be something good about it also.

00:55:12.322 --> 00:55:15.357
This is how the whole outlook is of the people

00:55:15.405 --> 00:55:18.240
all the time trying to brand others, what about yourself?

00:55:18.897 --> 00:55:21.114
What brand are you to give to yourself?

00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:23.241
That's the point nobody wants to see.

00:55:23.387 --> 00:55:24.716
What brand am I?

00:55:25.314 --> 00:55:28.519
What is my brand? I’m a brat. That's what you are.

00:55:28.783 --> 00:55:31.678
You see, sometimes I feel so many people the way they think

00:55:32.001 --> 00:55:35.835
they have no sense, like in the night like nocturnal animals would

00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:37.902
dash into that and that into that,

00:55:37.989 --> 00:55:41.920
that's how they have broken themselves completely like mad, for what?

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:45.564
Keep quiet. Be in the centre.

00:55:45.808 --> 00:55:50.079
You had to just wait, it was going to happen, this is your own,

00:55:50.162 --> 00:55:52.576
you are the people who are searching the truth,

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.756
for which it is all created, the whole scene is there,

00:55:55.777 --> 00:55:59.277
you are just get it, why are you breaking everything that

00:55:59.402 --> 00:56:02.651
God has given you, it is such a beautiful being He has created,

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.151
you are the most beautiful person,

00:56:05.651 --> 00:56:09.359
have you seen that when you go to the zoo all the animals are looking at you?

00:56:17.213 --> 00:56:19.770
In the same way they are looking forward to you,

00:56:20.603 --> 00:56:23.045
what have you got to give to them, I don't know.

00:56:24.566 --> 00:56:26.566
But once you have your realization

00:56:27.191 --> 00:56:30.922
then you will know the meaning of your being, then you will know what you are.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.130
And this is what one has to establish.

00:56:34.005 --> 00:56:36.790
We have really done lots of wrongs to ourselves

00:56:37.082 --> 00:56:39.496
by not understanding really, self estimation.

00:56:41.579 --> 00:56:44.143
One must know that you are a diamond,

00:56:45.497 --> 00:56:47.497
that you are the spirit,

00:56:48.122 --> 00:56:51.095
that you have to rise into the Kingdom of God,

00:56:51.595 --> 00:56:54.244
you are specially made for this purpose,

00:56:56.327 --> 00:56:58.810
right royal people you are,

00:56:58.956 --> 00:57:01.609
that you have to climbed up there, instead of that

00:57:01.692 --> 00:57:04.202
you are lost into your egos and super egos

00:57:04.285 --> 00:57:08.577
and frantically what you are doing is completely destroying

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.640
all the chances of your ascent

00:57:10.807 --> 00:57:13.832
which is so easily to be done. It is such a living force

00:57:14.332 --> 00:57:18.494
which is going to work out, it is not going to harm you in any way

00:57:18.765 --> 00:57:20.911
it is for you only,

00:57:21.224 --> 00:57:24.895
it is all there, it is Sahaja, it is within you, it is spontaneous,

00:57:25.103 --> 00:57:28.636
and it is going to work out, only thing we have to know

00:57:28.699 --> 00:57:31.671
that you have not to treat yourself so shabbily

00:57:31.817 --> 00:57:34.742
and with such hatred towards yourself.

00:57:36.055 --> 00:57:39.338
There is no need to have such a low opinion about yourself.

00:57:40.713 --> 00:57:46.416
This is the left side, the right side of course is of the people who talk big,

00:57:46.479 --> 00:57:50.422
you see, who say this

00:57:51.797 --> 00:57:55.222
who say, the great politicians, things who just

00:57:55.285 --> 00:57:59.178
talk down people, when they speak they just dominate

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.497
and by their speech they control people.

00:58:03.414 --> 00:58:07.783
This centre, right side people have who are hot tempered and

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:12.191
who lose temper and frighten people with their tempers, you see, they say such horrible things

00:58:12.212 --> 00:58:15.546
that people are just frightened of them and just to keep them quiet

00:58:15.629 --> 00:58:16.753
they manage somehow.

00:58:17.253 --> 00:58:19.357
This type of people have the right Vishudhi

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.803
they also have when they have the colds, coughs and all that it is a balance come to them,

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:28.705
when they have to talk too much also they have to have this problem of right Vishudhi

00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:30.737
and sometimes some people

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.568
suddenly lose their voices, you see

00:58:32.822 --> 00:58:37.060
when they talk too much also they lose voices because the balance is created within them.

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:40.516
Now the centre one is of Shri Khrishna.

00:58:41.745 --> 00:58:46.146
Shri Krishna is the one who creates the witness within us,

00:58:46.334 --> 00:58:49.593
He is the one who refuted all kinds of

00:58:50.843 --> 00:58:54.025
formal ritualistic things in religion.

00:58:54.108 --> 00:58:56.956
But He didn't become a hippie, that's one thing one should understand,

00:58:57.227 --> 00:58:59.227
that He didn't go to another extreme.

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:03.337
You see when He said that all these junks and formal things that are there,

00:59:04.129 --> 00:59:07.770
He didn't say that you take to drugs, another nonsensical formal thing,

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:11.421
He said that if you have to get over these things,

00:59:11.713 --> 00:59:13.713
you have to see it as a drama,

00:59:13.921 --> 00:59:17.339
the whole thing is a joke going on, it is a drama going on,

00:59:17.631 --> 00:59:20.103
but for that you have to become,

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:24.288
it's not a question of your achieving it by rational thinking,

00:59:24.788 --> 00:59:27.627
you have to go beyond your mind to achieve it,

00:59:27.835 --> 00:59:30.868
and that going beyond is done by the Kundalini.

00:59:31.097 --> 00:59:34.825
Now He did not do it does not mean He was not in it,

00:59:34.867 --> 00:59:38.761
He was very much there, like a painting you have first you have the background,

00:59:39.053 --> 00:59:42.125
then you have another color, then you have your third color,

00:59:42.229 --> 00:59:44.584
now the fourth color, and now the time has come

00:59:44.855 --> 00:59:46.855
for the whole picture to be ready.

00:59:47.397 --> 00:59:51.540
Everybody has played their part, a very important part in our evolution,

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.522
everyone is needed, among you may be many

00:59:54.918 --> 00:59:56.918
who might be having a problem with Shri Krishna

00:59:57.939 --> 01:00:00.713
especially Hare Rama Hare Krishna people, they suffer

01:00:00.838 --> 01:00:03.782
mostly from throat cancers, you can go and find out.

01:00:04.136 --> 01:00:07.289
Because they go against Shri Krishna,

01:00:07.539 --> 01:00:10.794
by taking His name so vainly on Oxford street, they will stand

01:00:10.836 --> 01:00:12.836
with those things they get in the market,

01:00:13.024 --> 01:00:15.615
put them here, attached it here, and go on dancing.

01:00:16.386 --> 01:00:18.808
Making mockery out of Shri Krishna's dignity

01:00:19.058 --> 01:00:23.420
like that and apart from that they take a name unauthorized.

01:00:23.628 --> 01:00:26.648
Who has given them authority to take the name of Shri Krishna?

01:00:28.065 --> 01:00:29.874
They spoil this chakra doubly

01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:33.016
because if you take to mantras you spoil left Vishudhi very badly.

01:00:34.162 --> 01:00:36.806
All those who have taken these so-called mantras

01:00:37.994 --> 01:00:39.621
have spoiled their left Vishudhi,

01:00:40.621 --> 01:00:45.986
because these mantras are not like one mantra to someone.

01:00:46.194 --> 01:00:49.321
I mean, are we only one chakra, or part of a chakras?

01:00:50.154 --> 01:00:52.754
And that too like Tinga means this,

01:00:52.962 --> 01:00:55.615
and all these things, where are they within us?

01:00:58.532 --> 01:01:00.532
They ran short of the names I think

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:03.522
so they started getting hold of any names that they felt like,

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:06.457
or they were sinister to give such horrible names to you.

01:01:06.707 --> 01:01:08.707
Left Vishudhi you catch so badly.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:12.363
Mostly people who take to mantras you will find when they speak

01:01:12.634 --> 01:01:16.964
their lower jaw moves like this, they have difficulty in talking.

01:01:17.902 --> 01:01:19.273
They cannot talk properly.

01:01:21.231 --> 01:01:22.893
This is one of the things you will find with them

01:01:23.393 --> 01:01:27.206
they have pain in the left hand side, they have pain at the back,

01:01:29.331 --> 01:01:34.699
this is the beginning of it. Any mantra given to you has to have logical meaning.

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:38.103
It's a big science of mantra, it is not something nonsensical,

01:01:38.245 --> 01:01:40.603
that you come here, I will give you a flower, finished.

01:01:40.749 --> 01:01:42.959
It is a big science, you see how many deities there are.

01:01:44.272 --> 01:01:48.668
You must know where the problem is, it is like a Kundalini

01:01:49.543 --> 01:01:54.084
rising in its living power you know that here is an obstruction,

01:01:54.459 --> 01:01:57.506
and you want to get rid of that obstruction, then you say there

01:01:57.819 --> 01:01:59.819
the password, and you pass trough

01:02:00.173 --> 01:02:03.477
but then Kundalini has not started, what is the use of having a mantra?

01:02:04.623 --> 01:02:06.396
The Kundalini is frozen out there,

01:02:07.229 --> 01:02:10.692
and you are saying a mantra for a chakra, now it would be something like this,

01:02:10.838 --> 01:02:12.838
"that I am frozen in England"

01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:15.338
and I'm saying a password for a bridge here.

01:02:17.671 --> 01:02:21.319
It is absurd. Because you are so naive about it,

01:02:22.215 --> 01:02:23.772
our Indian modern

01:02:23.835 --> 01:02:27.090
people also who think they are very westernized and sophisticated,

01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:29.590
they also are equally naive,

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.532
they don't want to read anything about the scriptures,

01:02:32.678 --> 01:02:34.404
they are not translated in English

01:02:35.404 --> 01:02:37.404
they do not know anything about mantra Vidya

01:02:38.319 --> 01:02:39.988
the mantra has to be

01:02:40.113 --> 01:02:43.552
connected with your development in your Kundalini.

01:02:43.636 --> 01:02:45.636
Not only that, but it should relate

01:02:45.967 --> 01:02:47.206
to the movement of the Kundalini.

01:02:48.644 --> 01:02:51.252
It should be given by a person who is a realized soul.

01:02:52.044 --> 01:02:55.479
Jagrut, awakened, mantra has to be awakened.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:03:02.064
And that you will find in Sahaja Yoga that it is such a temporary thing.

01:03:02.564 --> 01:03:06.684
For example, the Kundalini is stopping at this point, now what is the mantra for this point,

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:12.822
Lord's prayer, or "I forgive", to make it shorter.

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:17.783
That is the weapon Christ has given us of forgiveness, at this point,

01:03:18.012 --> 01:03:19.178
which stops your thinking.

01:03:19.511 --> 01:03:23.027
If any Dick, Tom and Harry cannot do it, you have to have realization first,

01:03:23.173 --> 01:03:27.275
then only because the Kundalini has reached there, you know that it is stopping there

01:03:27.317 --> 01:03:30.115
then you have to say that, alright, this is Lord's Prayer,

01:03:30.178 --> 01:03:31.558
you say Lord's Prayer, it opens out.

01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:34.281
What is the mantra over here?

01:03:34.781 --> 01:03:37.904
It's Allah Akbar, you put these fingers are of this center,

01:03:38.175 --> 01:03:41.557
put them here and say "Allah Akbar" three times, it will open out

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.398
But you have to be a realized soul, to begin with or the one who is telling you has to be a realized soul.

01:03:46.711 --> 01:03:50.678
There has to be some authority from God, not from theological college or anything.

01:03:51.657 --> 01:03:56.257
It is a mockery, to get knowledge of God in a theological college.

01:03:57.528 --> 01:03:59.882
I mean you must enter into the Kingdom of God

01:04:00.028 --> 01:04:02.028
to know what He is, what He is like,

01:04:02.278 --> 01:04:05.616
what is His whole vidya, His knowledge.

01:04:05.949 --> 01:04:09.054
Divine knowledge is very different from the knowledge you have.

01:04:09.158 --> 01:04:11.390
Have you ever known that this is the Vishudhi chakra before?

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.372
You have never known this before, it is not written anywhere.

01:04:20.955 --> 01:04:23.461
Some things had to be told by me also,

01:04:23.794 --> 01:04:25.794
so this was left for me to be told.

01:04:27.377 --> 01:04:28.651
Now this chakra,

01:04:30.401 --> 01:04:34.067
of Vishudhi chakra, gives you the witness state

01:04:34.359 --> 01:04:37.319
that Krishna has described that you become the sakshi

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:39.672
I would like you to also listen to my tape

01:04:39.776 --> 01:04:42.220
on Shri Krishna which is very good,

01:04:42.553 --> 01:04:48.943
recently I spoke about Him in a very detailed manner about Gita also.

01:04:49.235 --> 01:04:52.760
You can have all these tapes brought down here to Melbourne,

01:04:52.906 --> 01:04:57.426
and listen to them, but only listening to them is of no use

01:04:57.739 --> 01:05:01.755
is no use it will give you ideas and you will start behaving again in a funny way.

01:05:02.255 --> 01:05:06.748
I do not want you to make the same pickle out of me as you have pickled out
other people.

01:05:08.123 --> 01:05:11.679
Put it to practice. Because when I spoke in America

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:12.960
they were all taping me down,

01:05:13.752 --> 01:05:16.251
and everybody said "Mother you should not allow them to tape

01:05:16.459 --> 01:05:20.266
because you see these are all writers and this and that and they will use your knowledge

01:05:20.308 --> 01:05:23.212
and spread the thing, I said "let them do it,

01:05:23.233 --> 01:05:25.676
after all Kundalini I have to awaken, the cannot do it

01:05:25.697 --> 01:05:27.697
if they could do I would be very happy to sit down

01:05:27.828 --> 01:05:29.550
let them do it, I will be very happy."

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:33.494
Anybody who says that "why should you" I said "very good you come along and do it"

01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:35.619
I will be very happy to settle down,

01:05:35.869 --> 01:05:38.138
because I gain nothing, what is my gain?

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:47.287
Anybody who is willing to do it, I will be very happy to retire, absolutely.

01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:51.514
Because by God's grace I am a married woman, and very happily married,

01:05:51.639 --> 01:05:53.949
I have my own children and grand children,

01:05:54.199 --> 01:05:55.883
why should I bother my head,

01:05:55.966 --> 01:05:58.112
of going around the people travelling like this?

01:05:58.862 --> 01:06:04.308
Yesterday in Sydney, here in Melbourne today, again go back Sydney then to India, why should I do it?

01:06:04.808 --> 01:06:05.539
For what?

01:06:07.727 --> 01:06:11.854
Only because I love, because I know this is my mission, I have to do it, I'm suppose to do it

01:06:13.153 --> 01:06:14.354
this is the job I have,

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:17.294
but if anybody else can do it I will be very happy for them to do it.

01:06:19.002 --> 01:06:23.992
Now when it comes to all these awakening, and all that,

01:06:24.096 --> 01:06:26.096
it is the thing that happens to you,

01:06:27.325 --> 01:06:29.325
it is the thing that moves within you,

01:06:29.825 --> 01:06:33.071
and you have to feel the movement, it is not a blind lane

01:06:33.134 --> 01:06:36.992
where you just pay some money into a counter and say "now we are entering to the blind lane"

01:06:37.846 --> 01:06:38.847
And do what you like.

01:06:38.889 --> 01:06:42.081
Somebody says you jump, somebody says you do this and do that. Nothing.

01:06:42.102 --> 01:06:43.414
Everything is logical.

01:06:44.247 --> 01:06:45.953
First your Kundalini must arise,

01:06:46.078 --> 01:06:48.629
if it does not arise I cannot give you a certificate,

01:06:48.733 --> 01:06:52.756
you cannot give a certificate, nobody can give you a certificate, nothing artificial.

01:06:54.152 --> 01:06:57.439
So in America when I went and told them all they had tape recorders and all that

01:06:58.356 --> 01:07:01.497
something bad has also come out of it, it is Born Again.

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:04.569
All these things have come from there, only from my lectures.

01:07:05.173 --> 01:07:07.467
Because I told the Christians, when they called me,

01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:11.998
thinking they'd be Christians in the churches, you see they thought this is bonafide

01:07:12.498 --> 01:07:17.223
because I was baptized according to them, so I should be baptised by these people

01:07:17.348 --> 01:07:19.348
so I'm alright, I was bonafide.

01:07:19.423 --> 01:07:21.078
They called me in the churches, you see

01:07:21.453 --> 01:07:23.453
and they also collected a collection for me,

01:07:23.503 --> 01:07:24.450
very interesting.

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:32.277
But best part of it, some of them

01:07:32.327 --> 01:07:33.585
caught up certain words

01:07:33.635 --> 01:07:39.415
I said you are to be born again. You are to be born again, so they have got now a cult called Born Again, finished.

01:07:41.693 --> 01:07:44.766
It is very difficult to talk to these mad people,

01:07:44.841 --> 01:07:47.093
anything you tell them they make a cult out of it.

01:07:47.168 --> 01:07:48.894
Anything you don't they want to pickle up,

01:07:49.019 --> 01:07:51.625
you see it is such a difficult thing with human beings.

01:07:51.675 --> 01:07:53.675
They don't want to take to reality,

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:57.101
they want to have their ego everywhere asserting by which

01:07:57.201 --> 01:07:58.897
they pluck out all that is living

01:07:58.972 --> 01:08:03.068
and make that dead, ugly and say "this is mine, this is mine, this is mine."

01:08:04.068 --> 01:08:08.896
Absurd. But this is what happens to us. Now about Christ,

01:08:11.396 --> 01:08:12.302
I think

01:08:14.827 --> 01:08:17.278
greatest message of Christ is His resurrection,

01:08:18.153 --> 01:08:22.434
this is resurrection, that He showed what Krishna has said in His lifetime,

01:08:22.934 --> 01:08:26.821
that the spirit doesn't die, it cannot be killed,

01:08:27.546 --> 01:08:33.517
it cannot be blown out, it has to rise, and it rises.

01:08:34.392 --> 01:08:37.200
Whatever you may try, it is eternal,

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.790
and that is what Christ has proved by His resurrection.

01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:44.184
But by His resurrection He has achieved a great thing,

01:08:44.684 --> 01:08:46.014
which Hindus do not know

01:08:46.114 --> 01:08:49.399
and the Christians have not carried the message because they also do not know.

01:08:50.574 --> 01:08:52.574
But the greatest thing He has done,

01:08:52.949 --> 01:08:54.949
to our awareness is that,

01:08:55.174 --> 01:08:57.674
that if you pass through that centre

01:08:58.174 --> 01:09:01.825
your karmas are sucked, your sins are forgiven.

01:09:03.575 --> 01:09:05.921
This is the beauty He has created within us,

01:09:06.046 --> 01:09:10.499
by which our ego is sucked in self, He sucks in our ego, He is the sucker of our ego.

01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:15.575
And all the Christian nations are the greatest ego orientated people.

01:09:15.868 --> 01:09:17.593
It's very difficult to talk to them.

01:09:17.768 --> 01:09:19.768
First thing they will do is to box your nose.

01:09:22.343 --> 01:09:23.636
If not crucify you.

01:09:25.611 --> 01:09:30.228
They are extremely aggressive people, extremely aggressive and very ignorant.

01:09:30.503 --> 01:09:32.503
They are so naive, so naive,

01:09:32.778 --> 01:09:33.837
In India

01:09:33.987 --> 01:09:37.120
it is not so difficult to talk to them because they know what is knowledge.

01:09:37.195 --> 01:09:41.217
I mean they know what is Kundalini, they know. They know what is the rising of the Kundalini,

01:09:41.242 --> 01:09:42.883
they know who can do this,

01:09:43.608 --> 01:09:49.313
it's not difficult to talk to them, because the people are so naive in spiritual life,

01:09:50.138 --> 01:09:54.052
and then they are so ego orientated, despite the fact that Christ

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.267
is the one who is the sucker of your ego,

01:09:57.381 --> 01:09:59.162
He is the one who sucks your ego,

01:09:59.207 --> 01:10:01.662
so there is no karmas after realization.

01:10:02.162 --> 01:10:06.967
You become the spirit, spirit does not have any karma, it is a myth,

01:10:07.635 --> 01:10:10.209
it is sucked and this is what Christ has done for us.

01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:14.013
So, when Christians, so called, came to India,

01:10:14.242 --> 01:10:18.006
they converted people in such a crude method

01:10:18.305 --> 01:10:20.305
by putting a loaf in a well

01:10:20.872 --> 01:10:25.470
which the poor Indians ate - they are naive as far as Christianity was concerned -

01:10:25.551 --> 01:10:27.751
they said this was the meat of the cows,

01:10:27.832 --> 01:10:29.832
you are all finished, you are Christians,

01:10:29.916 --> 01:10:32.332
so the whole village became Christians.

01:10:32.832 --> 01:10:36.862
Like that they tried all dirty tricks on Indians and they all became Christians

01:10:36.926 --> 01:10:38.926
so Indian Christians are the worst of all,

01:10:40.265 --> 01:10:44.675
poor things, they think they are so condemned forever, now they can never be reconverted,

01:10:44.755 --> 01:10:49.542
they can never be realized, they cannot be resurrected, they are doomed people,

01:10:50.042 --> 01:10:53.584
who have eaten the cows' meat, not they, but their forefathers might.

01:10:55.661 --> 01:10:57.068
It is such a wretched state.

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:02.516
But if any realized soul had come

01:11:05.063 --> 01:11:07.860
they would have seen that this is what

01:11:07.907 --> 01:11:12.339
Christ was supposed to do, which is written in the Devi Bhagavatam,

01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:18.537
that He is the support of the universe.

01:11:21.168 --> 01:11:23.168
But the narrow visions of Christians

01:11:24.087 --> 01:11:28.239
and the narrow visions of Hindus, and the narrow visions of Muslims

01:11:29.561 --> 01:11:33.381
have made such a mess, that the time has come to get the whole picture,

01:11:33.428 --> 01:11:35.141
the complete integration,

01:11:35.305 --> 01:11:38.145
of all these great incarnations, who are within you

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:40.410
and to understand them in reality,

01:11:40.574 --> 01:11:41.607
what they are,

01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:45.495
and becoming yourself such a wider personality as a collective being

01:11:47.992 --> 01:11:51.535
About Christ, I don't know, I must have spoken

01:11:52.723 --> 01:11:56.477
hours and hours, about Krishna I must have spoken for hours and hours.

01:11:56.843 --> 01:12:00.171
In England also we have got about 300 to 400 tapes

01:12:00.352 --> 01:12:03.220
on different subjects which you should get them and listen to them.

01:12:03.287 --> 01:12:08.016
But again do not make it a big library for you please

01:12:08.348 --> 01:12:14.219
it is to be actualized, it is to be felt, it is to be practiced within yourself.

01:12:14.937 --> 01:12:17.757
It is not for giving you any big knowledges.

01:12:17.972 --> 01:12:25.384
We have a book called Advent, which is written by a French Sahaja yogi.

01:12:25.733 --> 01:12:27.733
Which is a very beautiful book,

01:12:27.981 --> 01:12:31.709
but we do not sell it to people who are not realized, we do not,

01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:35.757
because it is very difficult for a person who is not realized to bear the truth,

01:12:36.257 --> 01:12:39.687
that is why they crucified Christ. That is why they tortured Mohammed.

01:12:39.801 --> 01:12:43.508
That is why they tortured all the saints, because they could not bear the truth,

01:12:43.605 --> 01:12:45.185
their ego could not bear it.

01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:48.568
So we do not give those books to people who are not realized,

01:12:49.001 --> 01:12:51.522
if you are realized then you can order for you a copy,

01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:54.325
you can get the book, but otherwise you cannot get it.

01:12:54.406 --> 01:12:58.323
I am sorry we have certain experiences,

01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:00.539
and we deal on those experiences

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:03.039
that unless and until human beings are realized

01:13:03.371 --> 01:13:05.942
they are not going to value the Divine life,

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:08.962
they value anything else but their divinity,

01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:13.865
and here you do not pay a single pai, so there is no binding force.

01:13:13.895 --> 01:13:17.121
Like many people say, I said "why are you still doing these things?",

01:13:17.319 --> 01:13:19.757
they said "we have paid for it, so let us go through it",

01:13:19.888 --> 01:13:21.888
even if it is hell you go through it?,

01:13:22.757 --> 01:13:26.015
that's the mentality. Now here there is nothing paid,

01:13:26.314 --> 01:13:28.958
there's on attachment, it is your freedom seeking

01:13:29.659 --> 01:13:32.398
which is the attachment, if you are really a seeker

01:13:32.713 --> 01:13:35.287
you will go deep into it and have the blessings,

01:13:35.737 --> 01:13:39.546
have the beauty of that spirit

01:13:39.845 --> 01:13:41.088
which is within you,

01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:44.588
which you can have. The time has come, this was the time was promised,

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:49.806
this was talked about in John's Revelation.

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:55.582
Also in many of the Indian scriptures it is described.

01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:01.272
But the best is William Blake, who has described it very beautifully

01:14:02.191 --> 01:14:06.230
in his book called "Milton, even the place where I lived first,

01:14:06.394 --> 01:14:10.619
Surrey Hills, he has said, the first beacons will be lit in Surrey Hills,

01:14:10.834 --> 01:14:12.834
he has also said where our ashram is,

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:17.785
that in the ruins of Lambeth Way, the foundations will be laid

01:14:18.033 --> 01:14:20.284
come to Lambeth Way and he says

01:14:20.398 --> 01:14:22.884
that it will be a Jerusalem one day

01:14:23.384 --> 01:14:25.384
England will be a Jerusalem

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:27.354
That's what he has said

01:14:27.468 --> 01:14:30.093
it is a very interesting book "Milton" if you can get

01:14:30.224 --> 01:14:33.048
hold of it please read it, it's all described

01:14:33.112 --> 01:14:35.112
He describes everything even the vibrations

01:14:35.427 --> 01:14:38.547
that Her looms vibrate the sinuous

01:14:39.383 --> 01:14:42.891
it's a Jerusalem now, because people come for Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:43.139 --> 01:14:45.139
There are some very good

01:14:45.639 --> 01:14:47.639
Muslims we have young people

01:14:47.736 --> 01:14:49.736
who just found in their own country

01:14:49.968 --> 01:14:51.968
that fundamentalists are taking

01:14:52.468 --> 01:14:56.025
the rule and they are behaving in such a fanatic manner

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:58.090
they thought that if God is

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.321
such a fanatic nonsense then better give Him up

01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:04.178
and they wanted to become communists and they have taken to communism

01:15:04.292 --> 01:15:04.967
to a point.

01:15:05.115 --> 01:15:09.146
When one of them came down to London and somehow he happened to come to us

01:15:09.411 --> 01:15:10.650
there he got his realization

01:15:11.469 --> 01:15:13.017
after realization he knew

01:15:13.098 --> 01:15:16.772
that it's one extreme is fanaticism, another extreme is deny of God

01:15:16.886 --> 01:15:18.886
God is there but in the center.

01:15:19.134 --> 01:15:24.151
He went back, he got 500 people realized who are Muslims

01:15:24.299 --> 01:15:25.783
and now they come to London

01:15:26.166 --> 01:15:28.301
his mother wanted to go to Mecca.

01:15:28.667 --> 01:15:29.990
Mecca is also

01:15:30.154 --> 01:15:32.778
according to us is a very great pilgrimage no doubt

01:15:32.926 --> 01:15:35.060
because Mohammed Sahib was really very great

01:15:35.158 --> 01:15:37.644
and he was the incarnation of Primordial Master

01:15:37.691 --> 01:15:39.691
which can be proved on your Kundalini.

01:15:40.342 --> 01:15:43.056
All things that I'm saying can be proved on your Kundalini

01:15:43.321 --> 01:15:46.558
and you can see for yourselves absolutely practical for you to see.

01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:49.390
Now when he came to

01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:53.201
his mother wanted to come go to Mecca she told

01:15:54.221 --> 01:15:55.953
that now why I do want to go to Mecca

01:15:56.009 --> 01:15:58.621
now Mecca has shifted to London, better go to London

01:15:59.691 --> 01:16:01.691
that's what it is one has to realize

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:04.892
that when we talk of anyone

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.819
like Christ or Moses or Abraham

01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:11.926
or Mohammad or anyone, you should know they are all related to each other.

01:16:12.862 --> 01:16:15.480
While we are identified with one or the other.

01:16:16.215 --> 01:16:20.243
Let us identify ourselves with all of them to understanding of Kundalini

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.664
you'll be amazed, when the Kundalini rises,

01:16:22.795 --> 01:16:25.569
if somebody's a Muslim he has to take the name of Nanaka

01:16:25.616 --> 01:16:27.616
otherwise the Kundalini doesn't rise.

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:31.555
All the fanatics have to give up their fanaticism

01:16:31.619 --> 01:16:33.183
before the Kundalini rises.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:36.009
And even if their Kundalini rises and gives them realization

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.765
then again suck back into their fanatic paunches

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:42.118
So all these things will only disappear,

01:16:42.165 --> 01:16:44.031
all these relative things will disappear

01:16:44.179 --> 01:16:47.299
as soon as you find your absolute, that is your spirit.

01:16:47.581 --> 01:16:52.180
About the spirit, I'm sorry I cannot talk in such a small time,

01:16:52.462 --> 01:16:56.384
but there's a very good tape on Sat-Chit-Anand,

01:16:56.481 --> 01:16:59.106
is that is the spirit and it's best is

01:16:59.791 --> 01:17:02.991
to listen to that because I would

01:17:03.239 --> 01:17:05.745
do no honor to your spirit if I

01:17:05.909 --> 01:17:08.467
just finish it in two minutes or three minutes like that.

01:17:08.648 --> 01:17:11.217
It's a very wide subject and very beautiful.

01:17:11.314 --> 01:17:14.317
Most enjoyable to know about your own spirit,

01:17:14.381 --> 01:17:16.381
about yourself, that, truly you are

01:17:16.663 --> 01:17:19.315
not this body, not this mind, not this ego.

01:17:19.479 --> 01:17:21.479
Neither these conditionings and these

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.196
old ideas you have, conceptions. You are what you are.

01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:27.134
Thank you very much.

01:17:28.288 --> 01:17:30.288
Now I'm going away to India

01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:33.372
on the 8th, and tomorrow there's a good program

01:17:34.375 --> 01:17:38.952
in Sydney and 8th I'll be leaving up and

01:17:39.033 --> 01:17:42.323
then I'll be in India for a short time and going back to London.

01:17:42.521 --> 01:17:44.521
Maybe next year I'll be coming here.

01:17:44.652 --> 01:17:47.515
I would request you that you must attend your

01:17:47.612 --> 01:17:49.612
collective programs because

01:17:49.927 --> 01:17:52.211
the message of Sahaja Yoga is collectivity.

01:17:52.359 --> 01:17:54.526
If you take my photograph and meditate at home

01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:57.957
after some time you'll find you'll lose vibrations. You will not grow.

01:17:58.256 --> 01:18:00.040
You have to grow collectively.

01:18:00.269 --> 01:18:01.275
It's very important

01:18:01.926 --> 01:18:05.338
that all of you should grow together collectively.

01:18:05.519 --> 01:18:07.031
Collectiveness must be developed

01:18:07.078 --> 01:18:10.112
otherwise you must work it out, how it works on others

01:18:10.209 --> 01:18:14.028
and how you cures others and how you help others, is to be seen.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.360
Some people will be coming from Melbourne,

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.390
or from Sydney to Melbourne,

01:18:18.722 --> 01:18:21.612
in the beginning till you understand Sahaja Yoga

01:18:21.877 --> 01:18:23.199
and then they will go away.

01:18:23.548 --> 01:18:26.790
Of course there is no money, nothing involved as you see,

01:18:26.988 --> 01:18:28.988
we have started in a very small way.

01:18:30.008 --> 01:18:32.008
Now when next time I come

01:18:32.089 --> 01:18:33.919
I'm sure Melbourne will be

01:18:34.016 --> 01:18:36.016
a seed of very good Sahaja yogis.

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:39.254
Not doubting, but understanding,

01:18:39.687 --> 01:18:41.687
doubting doesn't give you much chance,

01:18:41.734 --> 01:18:43.868
you see, what is there to doubt, is nothing but

01:18:44.032 --> 01:18:45.664
your ego is doubting something.

01:18:45.896 --> 01:18:50.206
There's nothing to doubt, just come and see this is a new university into which you have entered,

01:18:50.236 --> 01:18:52.236
you don't have to pay anything - that's all.

01:18:52.887 --> 01:18:57.773
When you have to pay, you do not doubt and ask questions, I know you'll go head
long, but here

01:18:57.819 --> 01:19:00.126
you are free, you have freedom to doubt

01:19:00.324 --> 01:19:02.677
but do not pull it too fast

01:19:02.741 --> 01:19:05.392
because it you will spoil your chances of realization.

01:19:05.473 --> 01:19:07.257
May God bless you.
