00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:21.389
Face yourself for becoming.

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:41.666
Then the preparation is done to become
something

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:48.765
and on the whole, when you know that
it is your ego and superego

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.567
which are loading you up,

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:58.476
you have to scan them out with vibratory
awareness.

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:15.686
Now there are two types of attention
we have to pay.

00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:22.518
First is a constant attention that is
a routine of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.848
and the second one is the emergency
attention.

00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:38.009
I have been saying that all the Sahaja
Yogis must start writing their diaries:

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.884
one with every day’s experiences,

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:49.677
if you know that you have to write a diary,
you’ll keep your mind alert,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.223
and another one whenever you get

00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:57.487
any special idea of the past or
of the future, also to jot it down.

00:01:57.688 --> 00:02:00.886
So, like that, you should have two diaries.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:05.042
For your constant attention, you have
to fix up your mind

00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:12.604
on certain facts. The first one, as I
said, that if you keep a diary

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:18.368
then you will know that you have to remember
what important things have happened.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.189
So your attention will be alert and you
will be looking out for such points,

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.433
where, what is the thing you see.

00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:29.669
And you’ll be amazed, if you make
your attention alert,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.783
what new things come to you – very
brilliant ideas.

00:02:37.984 --> 00:02:45.902
And the miracles of life and the miracles
of God’s beauty and His auspiciousness,

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:49.133
His greatness, His kindness, His
blessings –

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:51.523
how they work out if you start writing
every day

00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:54.752
even two lines about it.

00:02:54.953 --> 00:02:59.742
It will make your mind constantly involved
with it.

00:02:59.943 --> 00:03:03.767
That’s a human style of doing things.

00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:09.645
Also you can mention in the diary

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:13.864
what happened: did you, could you do
your meditation?

00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:16.625
Did you get your time for meditation
or not?

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:23.674
A little bit as if you are appearing for
some sort of a examination or something,

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:29.269
you prepare a little note like that: “Did I
get up in the morning? Did I?”

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.719
Then any special path

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:40.273
or any special movement in the centre
or left or right also should be mentioned

00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:42.839
so that you keep a watch on your mind.

00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:46.546
It’s a very good thing to maintain a diary.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.021
Also, you will see progressively how
your ideas are changing,

00:03:52.222 --> 00:03:54.817
how new priorities are settling down,

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:59.212
how you give more importance to real things

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:03.442
and very little to unreal things.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.604
I think this is a very, very practical side
of human beings

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:10.143
that one should have a diary.

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:15.374
[The] same diaries, after some times,
will become historical things

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:19.216
and people would like to see what you
all have written.

00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:24.627
Not to be hypocritical about it or
deceptive about it,

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:28.718
but quite truthful and understanding.

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.758
You should jot down few lines just
before sleeping.

00:04:36.612 --> 00:04:44.638
Now we have to see that we have problems
for superego and ego.

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:48.930
Now superego is the left side, is darkness,

00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:53.601
tamo guna and our past.

00:04:53.802 --> 00:04:57.996
Those who have left side problems should
think of the future,

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:01.779
it gives them balancing if they think
of the future.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:11.229
For example, a person who is lethargic
should take to working.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.382
Put your mind into working for the future
planning:

00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:17.373
what to do, where to go, how to do.

00:05:17.574 --> 00:05:25.215
That will keep you away from [the] drag
of the left side

00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:31.543
and gradually then you can balance
yourself also.

00:05:35.132 --> 00:05:45.559
Now the right side of a person, when it is
activated very much,

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:55.181
he has to balance it, not with the left
side but with the centre.

00:05:55.381 --> 00:06:00.175
That is, a person who is very hard-working

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.833
must develop a witness state.

00:06:07.799 --> 00:06:12.323
You try to do a work, any work,

00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:19.841
indulge into work in thoughtless awareness,
as a witness.

00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:26.795
Whatever work you are doing you just say
that: “I am not doing it.”

00:06:26.996 --> 00:06:29.283
This you can do it after Realisation.

00:06:29.484 --> 00:06:34.080
You become thoughtlessly aware and start
doing your work.

00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:38.852
So the compensation of the left side is
done by movement to the right,

00:06:39.053 --> 00:06:41.624
and of the right side [by] movement
in the centre.

00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:45.168
Left side is the tamo guna, right side
is the rajo guna,

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:50.161
and the centre is the sattwa guna. But
still these are three gunas.

00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:53.541
That’s not the state which you have
to achieve.

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:58.538
About this I’ll tell you tomorrow more,
how to go further then.

00:06:59.157 --> 00:07:03.179
After scanning out which side is weak,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.170
you should plan out your style of life.

00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:11.671
For example, if you are extremely lethargic,
you cannot get up in the morning,

00:07:11.872 --> 00:07:15.748
you feel very sleepy in the night, you do 
not feel alerted,

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.846
then start planning as to what will you do,
how will you get up.

00:07:20.047 --> 00:07:22.498
Even puja is a good idea, hom [homa,
havan] is a good idea.

00:07:22.698 --> 00:07:26.133
Do something like that, you see, so that
you have to do something,

00:07:26.334 --> 00:07:29.865
what you call the kriya, is the action,
get into the action.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:34.498
Some sort of an action you go into
in Sahaja Yoga

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:37.648
as well as in your daily life,

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:41.931
[then] you’ll be able to change that mood
and come to the right side.

00:07:42.132 --> 00:07:46.899
And then you go to the, your movement
should be towards the sattwa guna,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.143
is to watch everything.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:55.567
Now at the sattwa guna point, where you
are in the centre,

00:07:56.948 --> 00:08:03.874
you have to see how much you are
misidentified.

00:08:04.075 --> 00:08:10.128
Say, supposing you are at the first stage
of left side,

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:14.776
then you will just do daydreaming, “Oh!
This person is so much identified,

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:17.645
that one is so much identified,” as if you
are the best.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.892
It’s just human nature, you see.

00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:22.176
“Oh, that person is like that, he is like
that,

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:26.882
this is very bad in the society, that is
going bad in the society. It’s better…”

00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:30.334
Then we can also go to this limit is to,
“That guru is very bad

00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:34.120
and that one is another madcap.” Like that,
you see, is all daydreaming going on.

00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:37.604
How far it is affecting you, how far are
you improving by that is not…

00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:42.436
It’s just, you see, thinking, analysing.
See, it’s a lazy stuff,

00:08:42.637 --> 00:08:45.959
sitting down and just analysing, it’s
a lazy stuff.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.848
The second thing could be

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:52.793
when you come to the second side of it,
is the kriya.

00:08:52.994 --> 00:08:56.520
Then what happens when you start doing it,

00:08:56.721 --> 00:08:59.813
then at least your attention is on what
you are doing.

00:09:00.014 --> 00:09:03.994
It’s not allowed to drift into something
and which goes into any nonsense and can -

00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:08.029
I mean, then you don’t know from where
the funny thoughts are coming.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.642
So, you start doing something.

00:09:09.843 --> 00:09:14.543
You can go and plant some trees, or you
can go and plant some flowers,

00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:17.238
or if you want you can do some cooking,
you can do some work.

00:09:17.439 --> 00:09:21.462
Take to work! That will help you. Any work.

00:09:21.663 --> 00:09:26.522
But while doing the work the problem
will be, you’ll develop ego.

00:09:26.723 --> 00:09:31.986
That’s why when you are developing the ego
you have to tell yourself,

00:09:32.187 --> 00:09:34.974
“You are not doing, mister. This you are
not doing,

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.116
this is not doing, you are not doing.”

00:09:37.317 --> 00:09:39.148
If you go on suggesting to yourself
[like this],

00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:42.349
Mr. Ego will not come up. And then many
things, you see,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.568
which normally trouble you and trouble
others –

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:47.527
like you have cleaned the room, all right.

00:09:47.728 --> 00:09:51.541
Then [if] somebody comes and spoils it,
you get angry with that person.

00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:54.914
Naturally! Because you think ‘you’ have
done.

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:58.078
First of all, you don’t clean the room.
If you clean the room then you be prepared,

00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:02.273
it will be dirtied, otherwise why should
you clean?

00:10:02.957 --> 00:10:09.020
Now, if it is dirty, well and good; if it
is not dirtied, well and good.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.787
This type of an attitude you should take

00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:17.719
to jump on to sattwa guna. On sattwa
guna you start accepting it.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.890
You become extremely mild. You become
a mild personality.

00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:28.056
Then at that time you do not discuss as to,
“Oh, I don’t like it;

00:10:28.257 --> 00:10:30.280
this was wrong; this should not have been.”

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.783
All these things do not come to you
in sattwa guna.

00:10:32.983 --> 00:10:36.529
You start seeing it. That time you see
[it] that,

00:10:36.731 --> 00:10:39.436
“All right, doesn’t matter. It’s done,
it’s done.”

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.637
On the contrary, you feel hurt, if you are
a sattwa guni,

00:10:43.838 --> 00:10:50.419
that by any suggestion you have suggested
your ego.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.735
Can you get that point?

00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:56.522
You feel ashamed of your ego, I mean
to say, if you are a sattwa guni.

00:10:56.723 --> 00:11:00.217
For example, even to say that, “This is
my car,” you will feel shy.

00:11:00.418 --> 00:11:02.465
That’s a sattwa guni style.

00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:04.705
Or even to say, “Why did you spoil
my carpet?”

00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:07.058
I mean in India nobody will say, I can tell
you this [much].

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:09.925
Is regarded [as] bad manners, absolute
bad manners.

00:11:10.126 --> 00:11:11.807
If anybody comes to your house and
the carpet is spoiled,

00:11:12.008 --> 00:11:13.072
they say, “Let it be, doesn’t matter.”

00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:17.335
Even it is burnt, “I don’t know. Let it be.
Are you burnt?”

00:11:17.536 --> 00:11:20.699
They’ll never say that, “You have burnt
my carpet, or done anything to my…”

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.310
Is regarded [as] bad manners.

00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:28.050
Like here, you see, if somebody’s sleeping
[and] somebody makes the noise.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.922
The person who is sleeping will never
say that,

00:11:30.123 --> 00:11:32.845
“You are making noise, and let me get in”.

00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:36.898
He’ll just get up and ask, “Do you need
anything?”

00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:39.967
That’s difficult for people here
to understand

00:11:40.168 --> 00:11:44.881
because ego is just sitting on the head.
But is bad manners there.

00:11:45.082 --> 00:11:47.574
You will find when you’ll go to India,
you’ll find this.

00:11:47.784 --> 00:11:53.129
These are bad manners to say that. Or
to say, “Oh, I, I feel very comfortable.”

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.795
I mean, to say “I feel comfortable” is bad
manners.

00:11:55.996 --> 00:11:59.090
I mean, they never say “I like it.”

00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:02.408
So what? All these words are not to be
said.

00:12:02.609 --> 00:12:05.552
If you are a sattwa guni then you just
don’t say.

00:12:05.753 --> 00:12:11.896
You will say, “Do you like it? Is it
comfortable? Would you like to have this?”

00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:20.174
The whole attention goes from your side.
Do you understand that?

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.192
That is the style one has to develop.
Then you are a sattwa guni.

00:12:24.393 --> 00:12:27.284
Otherwise, you are still on an ego trip. 
You see, whatever you may say:

00:12:27.485 --> 00:12:32.655
“I don’t like that, I don’t…” “I” - who are
you?

00:12:33.449 --> 00:12:36.206
First of all, ask the question, “Who are
you?”

00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:41.275
If God says, “I don’t like you,” I can
understand, He has the reasons,

00:12:41.476 --> 00:12:43.504
but for you to say, “I don’t like it” …

00:12:43.705 --> 00:12:47.622
After all, how did you come on this earth?

00:12:49.173 --> 00:12:52.262
How did you get a human birth?

00:12:52.463 --> 00:12:56.503
How did you get all these things? Now
think like that.

00:12:56.704 --> 00:12:59.351
“Who am I?

00:13:01.787 --> 00:13:04.316
I am nothing.”

00:13:04.674 --> 00:13:07.498
Anybody who thinks, “I am something,”
he should know

00:13:07.699 --> 00:13:09.797
that he’s nothing; makes no difference
to God

00:13:09.998 --> 00:13:16.091
whether he exists or does not exist,
you see, he’s nothing, he’s just a drop.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.694
So, this point if you understand, that even
if you do something,

00:13:20.895 --> 00:13:23.577
any work you do or anything you are doing:

00:13:23.778 --> 00:13:29.477
you are just doing it because you want
to do it.

00:13:31.538 --> 00:13:34.554
That is how you come on to sattwa guna.

00:13:34.755 --> 00:13:37.687
But normally it doesn’t happen. It happens
the other way round.

00:13:37.888 --> 00:13:46.862
For example a person is, say, doing
something;

00:13:47.063 --> 00:13:49.090
[if] by any chance he feels hurt

00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:51.590
or he thinks that whatever he has done
is no good,

00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:54.742
people don’t appreciate, or maybe he might
think that,

00:13:54.943 --> 00:13:58.800
“Oh, it’s not up to the point,” or whatever
it is.

00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:02.909
Then the reaction for him is not that he
does not try to rise to sattwa guna,

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:08.121
but he goes back to tamo guna. “All right,
I’ll not do it.

00:14:08.322 --> 00:14:13.316
I’ll sleep over it. Let them do it, why
should I do it?”

00:14:13.517 --> 00:14:20.007
So the training that you have to have
through your rajo guna goes a-waste.

00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:25.608
It’s just a training period that you are
with rajo guna. You are doing something.

00:14:25.809 --> 00:14:33.014
Now in that training period you have to
learn only how to come in the centre.

00:14:33.215 --> 00:14:36.832
For example now, water is required for you
to swim.

00:14:37.033 --> 00:14:40.600
If there is no water you cannot swim.

00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:47.425
All right? In the same way, rajo guna is
required for you to come to sattwa guni.

00:14:47.626 --> 00:14:52.343
If you do not do any work, you cannot
come to sattwa guna.

00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:57.634
So you are just working just to train
yourself to be a witness.

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:01.853
Now do you follow that point? You are not
doing it because you like particular thing,

00:15:02.054 --> 00:15:04.990
you are used to particular thing, because
you want to be this.

00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:08.248
This is not the way it is.

00:15:09.068 --> 00:15:13.479
You are just doing it to learn how to be
patient.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.944
To practice your patience. To see how
much patient you are.

00:15:20.145 --> 00:15:22.791
Once you start doing it, you’ll be amazed

00:15:22.992 --> 00:15:27.084
that you will never feel the burden
of the work.

00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:31.812
But it never happens. Most of the people,

00:15:32.013 --> 00:15:37.358
if they find their work is not effective,
they’ll go back to tamo guna.

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:40.013
There are many attitudes. Say, somebody
is working,

00:15:40.222 --> 00:15:43.383
then he thinks, “Why should I do all
the work? Others are not doing!”

00:15:43.584 --> 00:15:47.529
He’ll go back to their stage. But those who
are not working will not think that,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.967
“This person is working, let me also work.”

00:15:51.168 --> 00:15:54.265
It’s other way round, you see.

00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:56.209
This can be an attitude of some people,
that:

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:01.797
“If this person is working, let him work.”

00:16:01.998 --> 00:16:06.033
This is even a meaner stuff, [to] avoid,
just.

00:16:06.234 --> 00:16:08.936
You go to a restaurant and somebody
takes out the purse,

00:16:09.137 --> 00:16:12.204
others start looking this side – is very
mean,

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:17.168
it’s a very mean thing to do. Everybody
should come forward

00:16:17.369 --> 00:16:19.339
and once you have paid, you have paid it,
finished.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.362
Then you just don’t start counting, “Why
did I pay?”

00:16:23.563 --> 00:16:27.817
Once you try [to do this]. Or any work has
to be done,

00:16:28.018 --> 00:16:31.011
go forward with it, do it with your heart.

00:16:31.212 --> 00:16:34.284
Don’t worry if others have not done it.

00:16:34.485 --> 00:16:37.688
Just do it for its pleasure, and
the pleasure only you will get

00:16:37.889 --> 00:16:41.748
when you will do it with the understanding
that it’s a training period,

00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:45.858
you are better trained than the other
one is.

00:16:46.455 --> 00:16:48.745
You are at a higher class than the other
one is.

00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:53.424
So we have to be at a higher class.

00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:56.911
For that, this is just a training on.

00:16:57.112 --> 00:17:00.164
And that’s how we can really put

00:17:00.365 --> 00:17:03.950
our preparation into practice, into
all details

00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:09.002
to see how we work out our ego and
superego..

00:17:09.203 --> 00:17:11.987
Today, in the morning, I have told you that
your intellect

00:17:12.188 --> 00:17:16.901
must imbibe this within itself, all right?

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:24.936
And now I’m telling you that your action,
action that you do,

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.926
must be every time branded by you

00:17:30.127 --> 00:17:39.059
as just your training – any action you do.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:44.028
Supposing you have to drive for miles
together, you are trying your patience.

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:47.278
You see, they’ll do in everything. Say they
have to go for, say,

00:17:47.479 --> 00:17:51.309
helicopter, or say if they have to drop
from the…

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.256
what you call them, they drop down?

00:17:53.419 --> 00:17:55.048
Sahaja Yogis: Parachutes.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:57.142
Sahaja Yogis: Parachutes.
Shri Mataji: Parachuters.

00:17:57.343 --> 00:18:00.407
Or helicopter you take away or whatever
it is.

00:18:00.608 --> 00:18:04.880
You go on doing it again and again,
isn’t it? You practice it again and again.

00:18:05.081 --> 00:18:07.628
You drop many-a-times, you break your
legs, you break your hands,

00:18:07.829 --> 00:18:13.857
you do this and do that, till you become
a master. Do you understand My point?

00:18:14.058 --> 00:18:16.999
Driving – same way, till you become
a master, you go on.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.502
In the same way, you are doing this work
just to master your patience.

00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:29.501
And then your love, is your love – how
much you love really.

00:18:29.702 --> 00:18:34.688
If you really love someone, you are never
tired of working.

00:18:37.196 --> 00:18:39.733
You are never upset with work.

00:18:39.934 --> 00:18:42.566
But if you don’t love, you’ll start
counting,

00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:48.298
“How much money, how much work, how
many hours, how much to be paid?”

00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:54.193
All artificiality comes because there is
no love involved in your work.

00:18:54.394 --> 00:19:00.319
Whatever you don’t want to do, you don’t
do it, to begin with.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.896
To begin with, you just don’t do what
you don’t like – to begin with.

00:19:06.097 --> 00:19:09.745
But once you have mastered that, then
you have to master it

00:19:09.946 --> 00:19:13.632
that you do something that you don’t like.

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:16.439
Like meeting some bhooties, for example.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.748
You don’t want to meet, you want to run
away,

00:19:19.949 --> 00:19:23.083
but you go little nearer it, you see.

00:19:23.284 --> 00:19:25.397
Then develop an immunity for these
bhooties.

00:19:25.598 --> 00:19:29.170
After some time, you’ll not catch them.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.227
You have to develop the immunity, isn’t it?

00:19:32.436 --> 00:19:37.336
Otherwise one person comes here and
everybody’s head goes out.

00:19:38.098 --> 00:19:41.800
Instead of the fellow improving, you all
go out.

00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:49.354
So all these things are, all these events
are for your training, your immunity.

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:53.237
Your immunity is to be trained,

00:19:53.966 --> 00:19:59.860
and when it is so, when we are training
ourselves, we should take it as a job.

00:20:01.132 --> 00:20:06.758
But the attitude should be extremely
positive,

00:20:06.968 --> 00:20:09.760
extremely positive

00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:15.088
and all that should be expressed in your
notebook:

00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:20.858
whether you got dejected or you got upset
and disgusted,

00:20:21.058 --> 00:20:28.237
you want to run away from it – all sorts of
things. It’s just a training to your mind.

00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:34.725
Whatever is the situation, wherever one
has to live,

00:20:34.926 --> 00:20:40.877
whatever one has to do, we should do.

00:20:41.078 --> 00:20:46.147
Whatever may be the circumstances,
conditions, you’ll be amazed,

00:20:46.348 --> 00:20:48.553
you will not even know what you have
eaten in the morning,

00:20:48.754 --> 00:20:53.534
what you have eaten in the evening, whether
you have eaten or not you will not know.

00:20:53.735 --> 00:21:01.480
You’ll not fuss about it, you’ll not worry
about it, you’ll not think about it.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:10.365
But this being the aim, is to reach
to sattwa guna,

00:21:10.566 --> 00:21:14.667
every other thing becomes zero.

00:21:15.995 --> 00:21:19.192
It’s the greatest hurdle comes to Sahaja
Yogis I’ve seen,

00:21:19.393 --> 00:21:22.856
when they start organising.

00:21:23.057 --> 00:21:27.259
 They start organising something. Now
somebody wants something,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.114
so they’ll run up to get the thing for that
person.

00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:34.924
Now, just now I’ve said that you must look
after the needs of others.

00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:37.289
But if I am sitting here and there’s
a lecture on,

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.631
then you’d better be just listening to Me.

00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:44.495
You see, this also is there that: how
to have your priorities,

00:21:44.696 --> 00:21:49.354
at this time when something [is] working
on you,

00:21:49.555 --> 00:21:52.100
this is the first thing you have to do.

00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:57.220
Not that at this time you go and cook.

00:21:57.421 --> 00:22:03.465
You have known the story of two sisters
attending on Christ. All right?

00:22:03.666 --> 00:22:08.976
So at this time, what is your first job

00:22:09.177 --> 00:22:13.075
is to try to be more exposed to Me

00:22:13.305 --> 00:22:16.362
so that automatically you’ll go into your
sattwa guna.

00:22:16.563 --> 00:22:19.140
This is the best!

00:22:19.341 --> 00:22:21.591
But if I am not there,

00:22:21.792 --> 00:22:26.303
and when you are alone or when you are
with the other Sahaja Yogis,

00:22:26.504 --> 00:22:31.093
you must now compete in rising higher
and higher:

00:22:31.307 --> 00:22:35.571
from tamo guna to rajo guna and from rajo
guna to sattwa guna.

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:40.656
But actually, by Realisation you have gone
beyond these three gunas.

00:22:40.857 --> 00:22:47.099
You have gone beyond it. Actually, that is
what has happened to you.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:52.644
But, like clouds, they cover you again
and again.

00:22:53.162 --> 00:22:57.197
And when the sky is covered with those
clouds,

00:22:57.398 --> 00:23:02.996
you cannot see the sun, you cannot see
the moon, you cannot see the stars.

00:23:03.197 --> 00:23:06.576
So we have to know how these clouds
are coming into us

00:23:06.777 --> 00:23:10.243
and that’s how we go into our complete
analysis.

00:23:10.444 --> 00:23:12.725
How these clouds are coming to us,

00:23:12.926 --> 00:23:16.764
we find out about our different chakras,

00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:20.596
what are the chakras we are catching.

00:23:20.985 --> 00:23:27.364
Here comes the another constant attention,
towards our chakras.

00:23:27.565 --> 00:23:33.338
Are our vibrations all right or not? Are we
getting our vibrations?

00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:37.858
If not, what chakra am I catching, what
must be the catch?

00:23:38.059 --> 00:23:42.269
I must raise my Kundalini, see for myself,
where is the catch.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.545
Do I do my meditation or not? If I do it,
am I doing it just dozingly

00:23:46.746 --> 00:23:49.220
or am I really in it?

00:23:49.421 --> 00:23:53.837
Am I really feeling it or not? Am I alert
or not?

00:23:54.038 --> 00:23:58.519
All this is to be assiduously, sincerely,

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.995
absolutely, truthfully should be worked
out.

00:24:02.196 --> 00:24:07.009
Because it is a process between your self –

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.400
‘Atmanyeva Atmana tushta’ [The Spirit
is satisfied with Itself].

00:24:09.601 --> 00:24:13.694
You see, it’s a very funny, it is so funny
relationship

00:24:13.895 --> 00:24:21.055
that it is the Atma is satisfied with Atma!

00:24:21.256 --> 00:24:24.495
You have to be satisfied with your Self.

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:27.106
There’s nobody, Mataji is not concerned,
nobody is concerned.

00:24:27.307 --> 00:24:31.937
It is you who is concerned with your Self.
