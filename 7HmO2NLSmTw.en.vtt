WEBVTT

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:10.938
…wobbling too much and how to fix the attention.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:23.867
Now the quality of attention changes according

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.218
to the state of your evolution.

00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:36.421
For example, in an animal…

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:54.611
So where is the attention placed in the human being?

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.088
It is not a fixed point.

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:09.392
You can say, attention is the surface or the edge of awareness.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:26.888
Wherever we are made aware, the attention gets diverted to that point.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.603
If you can find some analogy,

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:51.577
all the files (filings) of iron

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:59.252
have got a power to be attracted towards the magnet.

00:02:04.314 --> 00:02:08.298
Where is that power, you cannot locate – it is all over.

00:02:09.376 --> 00:02:14.536
Wherever the magnet is placed, the files are attracted.

00:02:16.776 --> 00:02:20.410
Our attention is also like that,

00:02:22.284 --> 00:02:26.987
that wherever we are attracted, our attention goes there.

00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:36.714
It is existing in the whole body,

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:42.550
in the sense that it can be diverted anywhere, outside the body.

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:45.370
Also inside the body,

00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:50.445
in case if there is any pain or there is any trouble.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.617
It floats over the nerves, it floats over the nerves

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:10.680
It floats over the whole nervous system,

00:03:14.515 --> 00:03:21.609
but there is a controlling centre in the brain.

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:34.014
If it is hit then we can remain conscious,

00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:38.804
but without any attention.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.015
Also, if somebody is hit on the Vishuddhi Chakra, it can happen.

00:03:52.477 --> 00:03:56.990
It can happen even in the lower chakras if somebody is hit.

00:03:57.556 --> 00:04:04.165
That portion will lose its attention because you cannot feel,

00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:12.556
in that part.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.353
The difference is this, that you can pay attention

00:04:23.102 --> 00:04:26.885
to those points, if you want to, even if they are numbed.

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:30.609
For example, if my hand is numb I can pay attention to that,

00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:35.303
means I can look at it, I can think of it,

00:04:35.716 --> 00:04:42.286
but there is a point in our being,

00:04:43.373 --> 00:04:47.572
if that is hit then we cannot even think,

00:04:48.193 --> 00:04:51.966
we are just lying unconscious they say,

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:56.528
but eyes are open, hands are moving, legs are moving.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:04.633
That point is at the point of Vishuddhi Chakra here.

00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:09.779
And if you can draw a line from here

00:05:10.663 --> 00:05:14.474
to the point where is the peetha of

00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:22.511
Vishuddhi Chakra is inside, inside the brain;

00:05:24.743 --> 00:05:28.621
along that line if you are hit anywhere

00:05:29.534 --> 00:05:34.892
you become attention-less, you cannot pay attention anywhere.

00:05:48.907 --> 00:05:52.134
This line passes through,

00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:00.486
also, Agya Chakra.

00:06:01.098 --> 00:06:05.460
Because when this point is connected

00:06:05.856 --> 00:06:10.132
with Vishuddhi Chakra at the back,  in here,

00:06:10.444 --> 00:06:16.256
and at the peetha inside, then a kind of a triangle is formed

00:06:16.465 --> 00:06:22.311
and all this line or this area can affect your attention.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.984
Your heart is moving, your limbs are moving

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:33.561
but you are not paying attention anywhere.

00:06:48.124 --> 00:06:52.523
So when you pay attention to something,

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:59.460
actually you pay attention, normally

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.923
– when you are not realised – through your brain centres.

00:07:11.946 --> 00:07:14.497
After realisation,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.341
you can pay attention through your other centres also.

00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:21.997
You do pay.

00:07:24.157 --> 00:07:26.270
This is a very big difference between a person

00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:29.326
who is realised and who is not realised.

00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:38.113
Or you can say that you can become effective

00:07:38.314 --> 00:07:42.348
through your other centres by paying attention to them.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.725
You can feel the centres which are obstructed

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:53.464
in your body, which you never felt before.

00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:59.912
Not only that, but you can feel the centres of other people.

00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:04.818
That means your central nervous system

00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:12.876
is being blessed by a new awareness

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:19.087
by which it can convey to you, communicate to you,

00:08:19.704 --> 00:08:21.806
the attention paid by your centres

00:08:22.007 --> 00:08:25.182
and also it can take your attention

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:30.111
in a subtler way into the centres of others.

00:08:31.572 --> 00:08:34.150
So, first thing that happens to you

00:08:34.351 --> 00:08:37.908
is that your attention becomes subtler.

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:45.424
Attention becoming subtler means

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:53.346
you start understanding deeper things.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.689
For example, a bird can see a flower

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.908
but cannot feel the beauty of a flower.

00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:14.166
And a unrealised person can see the beauty of a flower,

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:17.875
but cannot see the vibrations of the flower.

00:09:20.507 --> 00:09:27.311
So you become subtler, your attention becomes subtler.

00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:38.025
You definitely are at a higher evolutionary stage

00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:41.060
than the other people are.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:53.611
Now we have to see how we use our attention.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:04.103
You have seen, even when you were not realised,

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:09.161
that supposing you start developing

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:13.404
an art in your hand from your very childhood,

00:10:15.099 --> 00:10:22.020
then you develop the deftness of that particular art,

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:27.052
because a kind of a myelin sheath grows on the nerves.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.329
In the same way, when you are realised,

00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:37.955
I would say when you are a newly born person,

00:10:38.156 --> 00:10:42.225
if you start respecting your attention

00:10:46.954 --> 00:10:53.702
then gradually you develop a deftness for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:56.326 --> 00:11:00.451
But so many people, when they get realised,

00:11:00.802 --> 00:11:04.060
they hardly come second time.

00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:11.154
Even if they come second time, they do not develop

00:11:11.874 --> 00:11:14.966
the feeling of vibrations more,

00:11:18.927 --> 00:11:23.673
they still go on being busy with their day-to-day work,

00:11:23.874 --> 00:11:27.334
wasting their attention on

00:11:28.216 --> 00:11:33.198
things which do not give you the subtler feeling.

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:43.467
So the subtleness, the deftness

00:11:44.498 --> 00:11:54.349
of the art of Sahaja does not develop.

00:12:01.695 --> 00:12:07.115
For example, I would say a person who is over-read,

00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:11.209
as soon as he gets his realisation

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:16.443
he starts tallying it with what he has read,

00:12:18.349 --> 00:12:22.240
this makes his attention again wasted.

00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:27.588
As it is, his attention has been fixed

00:12:28.106 --> 00:12:31.363
by these conventional ideas; some of them are correct,

00:12:31.564 --> 00:12:36.186
some are incorrect, some are absolutely faulty, some are useless.

00:12:36.387 --> 00:12:38.738
Some are only because they wanted to make money,

00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:41.690
they have published some trash.

00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:48.731
As soon as you get realisation,

00:12:49.637 --> 00:12:52.363
you go back to your own

00:12:56.308 --> 00:13:03.261
gross awareness and start tallying this subtle with the gross,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.074
so you start again losing the vibrations.

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:15.277
Actually after getting realisation I have seen, with small children,

00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:20.183
they sleep for very long hours.

00:13:20.918 --> 00:13:24.535
They become little inactive for some time.

00:13:26.054 --> 00:13:29.433
But if an elder gets it he will immediately go to the book store,

00:13:29.634 --> 00:13:33.073
buy one book on Kundalini and start reading about it.

00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:44.271
Then some of you,

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:48.853
not understanding that you have become somebody else,

00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:53.621
take it for granted, “Alright, Mataji has been very kind;

00:13:53.822 --> 00:13:57.907
She says I am far, but how am I to believe?”

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:01.668
As if by believing it they are going to give some

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:05.136
money to Me or I don’t know what they are going to give.

00:14:05.403 --> 00:14:08.318
“I can see the vibrations coming, but what’s the use of getting the vibrations?

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:10.741
Why did She give us vibrations?”

00:14:10.957 --> 00:14:14.348
Again come back to the gross idea of utility,

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:18.316
because that’s human nature, has been so far,

00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:21.100
to make everything into utility.

00:14:21.807 --> 00:14:25.207
Everything must be utilised, you see.

00:14:25.408 --> 00:14:27.977
Man thinks no end of himself.

00:14:29.714 --> 00:14:34.876
So he starts putting his realisation into utility.

00:14:35.077 --> 00:14:38.617
“What utility it has? How many people are going to get it?

00:14:39.071 --> 00:14:40.749
What is going to happen?

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.663
What is the ratio? What is the schedule? What is this? What is that?”

00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:50.561
You have been given this subtleness to enjoy.

00:14:52.755 --> 00:15:00.952
Like, if we enjoy the beauty of flower, we just enjoy.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.782
Do we go to the books and find out:

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.285
“What we should do about with this enjoyment of ours?

00:15:07.486 --> 00:15:10.126
How to enjoy this flower?” And then “what to do?”

00:15:10.327 --> 00:15:12.439
and who has described about the flowers,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.181
so let us see if this is fitting into that?”

00:15:23.236 --> 00:15:25.243
But is done very commonly and

00:15:25.444 --> 00:15:29.403
I really don’t knowhow to say, because it’s such a foolish thing.

00:15:30.467 --> 00:15:34.709
And I am only afraid that, sometimes, if I say they will feel hurt,

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.254
and, as human beings are, they get hurt for nothing at all.

00:15:37.455 --> 00:15:38.996
That’s very foolish.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.449
Children are very sensible that way.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.969
Once they get it they start enjoying it. They just enjoy it.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.266
They just sleep off! They are not bothered.

00:15:48.467 --> 00:15:51.020
They think, that it’s something that is to be enjoyed,

00:15:51.221 --> 00:15:52.988
“Let us enjoy it.”

00:15:53.214 --> 00:15:56.196
So at the very outset it happens like that.

00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:04.150
And the man doesn’t know that how he has made himself even

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:09.576
much more gross than he was ever in this kaliyuga,

00:16:10.107 --> 00:16:12.677
in these modern times:

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:19.849
by organising things according to his own ideas and conceptions.

00:16:20.334 --> 00:16:24.865
He has become so unnatural, so foolish

00:16:27.888 --> 00:16:31.255
that discrimination between joy

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:43.029
and ugliness, he does not have.

00:16:43.939 --> 00:16:46.103
He’s so confused.

00:16:47.727 --> 00:16:50.861
So, first of all, it is not only

00:16:51.062 --> 00:16:53.490
one reason but there are many reasons.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:58.564
And as I described to you, inherently, it is

00:16:59.908 --> 00:17:08.759
the human, gross activities before realisation.

00:17:17.966 --> 00:17:20.755
If you understand the disease, from where it has come,

00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:23.625
sometimes it’s easier to correct it.

00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:25.137
You cannot just correct the disease

00:17:25.338 --> 00:17:28.801
without understanding the history behind it.

00:17:31.247 --> 00:17:32.630
If you are a student of history

00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:35.473
you will know how human beings have behaved.

00:17:35.726 --> 00:17:39.700
I mean, you just start wondering, what’s wrong with these people?

00:17:40.618 --> 00:17:42.028
God created one world!

00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:45.085
I mean just think, a person like Me coming on this earth,

00:17:45.286 --> 00:17:48.673
suddenly you find there are so many countries being created.

00:17:49.272 --> 00:17:51.676
Alright created, you can have separate countries

00:17:51.877 --> 00:17:54.365
if you cannot manage the whole world together,

00:17:54.566 --> 00:17:57.997
but then the fighting going on, killing each other.

00:18:00.176 --> 00:18:01.698
All kinds of problems

00:18:01.899 --> 00:18:05.542
for nothing at all, I mean it’s such a madhouse!

00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:11.113
So historically if you see how man has made himself mad

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:17.872
it’s not easy to compile all that in one lecture,

00:18:18.135 --> 00:18:19.602
you’ll have to write volumes.

00:18:19.803 --> 00:18:23.070
I think there are already written volumes.

00:18:24.338 --> 00:18:26.737
So, there is [a] historical background,

00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:29.765
which has spoilt your attention.

00:18:37.466 --> 00:18:42.151
Physically, those who come for physical handicap

00:18:42.352 --> 00:18:45.433
or physical trouble or something like that because they are sick,

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.714
are sometime little better than the people who do not have this,

00:18:50.915 --> 00:18:54.745
because they definitely get the relief part of the joy.

00:18:55.409 --> 00:18:58.378
If they get their relief, there is a little shadow of joy

00:18:58.579 --> 00:19:00.706
that they feel and, then they start understanding

00:19:00.907 --> 00:19:02.957
that it is to be enjoyed.

00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:07.198
But I would say, they too once they get the relief

00:19:07.401 --> 00:19:09.406
they just disappear.

00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:18.979
Not understanding that there is something greater than this

00:19:20.276 --> 00:19:23.987
to be tasted and enjoyed.

00:19:27.112 --> 00:19:31.902
And the physical enjoyment in Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:38.061
itself, is sufficient to keep your attention subtler.

00:19:38.354 --> 00:19:40.671
You do not have to fix your attention

00:19:40.872 --> 00:19:44.524
but you have to get subtler and subtler in your attention.

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:50.553
Fixing up of your attention, as you know, is a very wrong method.

00:19:54.162 --> 00:19:57.996
That was done by some yogis and you know what is the result of that:

00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:00.176
their chakras were all broken and finished.

00:20:00.377 --> 00:20:03.074
When they fixed their attention onto Agya Chakra,

00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:05.387
you have seen that Agya Chakra is broken.

00:20:05.722 --> 00:20:07.739
You are not to fix any attention

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.954
but you have to make your attention subtler and subtler.

00:20:15.165 --> 00:20:19.550
As I told you that a magnet, when brought say near the stones

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:22.101
nothing happens to the stones, they are just there;

00:20:22.302 --> 00:20:24.394
you move the magnet any way you like.

00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:27.953
But when you take it to the iron filings, only,

00:20:28.273 --> 00:20:33.991
the filings are attracted towards the magnet.

00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:38.631
In the same way the attention of a Sahaja Yogi

00:20:38.919 --> 00:20:46.068
should be so subtle that he should feel the vibrations,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.029
he should think of vibrations,

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.814
he should eat vibration, drink vibration and enjoy them.

00:20:59.187 --> 00:21:01.296
On the physical side,

00:21:01.497 --> 00:21:03.880
many people tell Me that, “We went to their house

00:21:04.081 --> 00:21:06.716
and they offered me laddoos and I had to eat.

00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:09.859
What can you do, Mataji?” Actually, you see, they felt attracted

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.132
towards the shape of the laddoos.

00:21:12.473 --> 00:21:16.518
They ate it, but they didn’t see the vibrations of those laddoos,

00:21:16.719 --> 00:21:20.244
they just ate it off and then they had a stomach trouble.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.548
When they have a stomach trouble,

00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:25.282
then they said, “Mataji, we have lost our vibrations,

00:21:25.483 --> 00:21:27.413
now what to do? We ate the laddoos.

00:21:27.724 --> 00:21:31.435
”But if you had seen that there are no vibrations in that laddoo,

00:21:31.636 --> 00:21:34.354
you should have said that, “Today I am not supposed to eat anything,”

00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:38.305
or something like that, and you should not have eaten them!

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.219
If you see a born-realised child, he will never eat.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.777
Even the mother beats the child,

00:21:43.978 --> 00:21:46.308
he’ll say, “Alright, beat me but I’m not going to eat it!”

00:21:46.777 --> 00:21:48.739
Because they are not going to eat the filth,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.067
such children are supposed to be very obstinate,

00:21:52.268 --> 00:21:54.637
they think they are obstinate. Because they know, “There is no vibration,

00:21:54.838 --> 00:21:57.540
so why should we eat because we are not going to enjoy.”

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:04.590
So on the physical side, there are so many such mistakes you have committed.

00:22:06.043 --> 00:22:10.958
If you take to now, say habits you have, supposing you have a habit of say,

00:22:11.973 --> 00:22:14.509
pulling your hair.

00:22:16.554 --> 00:22:19.681
There was some lady who had a habit of pulling her hair and

00:22:19.882 --> 00:22:22.673
she used to become bald here, then bald here, then bald here

00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:25.690
and the hair used to grow this side, then she used to have a bald head here.

00:22:25.891 --> 00:22:28.791
Then she will pull her hair here.

00:22:29.127 --> 00:22:36.142
Such a person! So she came to Me for treatment. Imagine!

00:22:38.108 --> 00:22:40.065
So I told her, “Why do you do like this?” She says,

00:22:40.266 --> 00:22:42.728
“Now my attention is like that, it always

00:22:42.978 --> 00:22:45.603
starts pulling my hair.”

00:22:45.804 --> 00:22:48.447
“What to do? Such an attention you have got!”

00:22:50.556 --> 00:22:53.306
So, you know her elder sister used to beat her on her hand,

00:22:53.507 --> 00:22:55.416
any time she put her hand. She said, “You must beat me

00:22:55.617 --> 00:22:57.103
if you don’t beat me I’ll beat you.

00:22:57.304 --> 00:22:59.487
”But the beating was on and everybody used to look at them,

00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:02.441
“What are they doing between each other?”

00:23:02.706 --> 00:23:05.010
And still, you see, she could not stop it!

00:23:05.211 --> 00:23:08.102
All habits are like this monkey business.

00:23:08.532 --> 00:23:10.683
All of them are like that,

00:23:10.884 --> 00:23:13.753
because the matter is trying to sit on top of our attention,

00:23:13.954 --> 00:23:16.586
all the time, and so we form habits.

00:23:16.787 --> 00:23:21.046
Certain habits are alright, convenient, and convenience like that.

00:23:21.247 --> 00:23:23.718
I mean some people to break habits, you know,

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.984
they say “We’ll not sit on the ground nor sit on the chair.”

00:23:27.193 --> 00:23:29.437
“So where will you sit?” “We’ll sit in a sitting pose

00:23:29.638 --> 00:23:31.460
and we’ll practice that sort of a thing.

00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:33.870
”I mean you need not do such a nonsense.

00:23:34.071 --> 00:23:38.805
I’m meaning that certain things are alright, don’t go to extremes.

00:23:39.124 --> 00:23:43.456
But certain habits that we acquired, is mostly because of fashions.

00:23:44.395 --> 00:23:47.487
And we start, because somebody’s smoking,

00:23:47.688 --> 00:23:49.646
he forces you, he says “Alright”,

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.846
and one bad habit we have got, is not to say no to anyone.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.432
“How to say ‘No’, you see, they were all drinking and

00:23:57.633 --> 00:24:00.495
they offered us drinks and we said ‘No,

00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:02.331
but they were just forcing us.

00:24:02.532 --> 00:24:06.484
Then it looked very bad, you know, not to drink and…

00:24:07.544 --> 00:24:11.170
And they offered one cup, glass of drink to me

00:24:11.371 --> 00:24:14.991
and then I said,  ‘Alright, I’ll have very little sip,’

00:24:15.192 --> 00:24:18.996
you know one day and then I had it like that.

00:24:19.325 --> 00:24:23.864
And then my relations, you see, they came

00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:28.626
and they invited us for dinner and we had to go,

00:24:28.827 --> 00:24:30.842
and then they started a cabaret dance,

00:24:31.043 --> 00:24:33.320
you know, and we had to see after all,

00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:36.735
it would look very bad not to see a naked woman.”

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.991
“Oh, we are very innocent people!”

00:24:42.192 --> 00:24:43.882
So we go on explaining,

00:24:44.083 --> 00:24:47.539
“What to do now, this is the society, this is the fashion,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.610
this is the style, this is how it is.”

00:24:55.828 --> 00:25:00.359
But a Sahaja Yogi is a special one,

00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:03.362
he’s a chosen one.

00:25:03.563 --> 00:25:07.288
Because you haven’t got your own value.

00:25:07.489 --> 00:25:10.142
tumala kimat nai sataji (Mарати).

00:25:10.702 --> 00:25:15.686
You have not valued yourself as I have valued you.

00:25:15.887 --> 00:25:20.405
This is a fact

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:30.584
which very few realise really, that to get realisation like this,

00:25:32.606 --> 00:25:37.118
there must be something tremendous that Mataji must have done.

00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:41.535
She must have put in lot of labour,

00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:45.106
to work this out Herself;

00:25:45.307 --> 00:25:48.997
She must have done tremendous tapasyas in all Her lives.

00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:50.948
And even in this life

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:54.632
She must have worked very hard, day in and day out.

00:25:55.331 --> 00:25:57.182
And here we are when we get it,

00:25:57.383 --> 00:26:02.358
how common place the whole thing is, how we are about it.

00:26:04.982 --> 00:26:09.905
I thought by giving realisation you will immediately see your value

00:26:10.106 --> 00:26:12.554
and you’ll think that you are something great

00:26:12.755 --> 00:26:16.046
and that you have got this realisation and the sakshatkar,

00:26:18.875 --> 00:26:21.898
but it is not so.

00:26:23.787 --> 00:26:30.971
And you start compromising with gross things in life.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:37.419
There is a huge populace

00:26:39.351 --> 00:26:44.593
which is to be led by one of you.

00:26:45.134 --> 00:26:48.499
One of you can lead all of them.

00:26:48.976 --> 00:26:52.039
Leaders do not compromise.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:58.499
leaders do not solve the problems of the people whom they lead,

00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:02.504
but they give them problems to be solved.

00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:05.418
They stand above them,

00:27:06.207 --> 00:27:10.981
they are much above them, they do not compromise, they do not bend.

00:27:11.182 --> 00:27:14.394
Others bend before them.

00:27:19.785 --> 00:27:25.457
If the light starts falling and faltering on the roads,

00:27:25.816 --> 00:27:31.059
what will the person do who is carrying the light in the hand?

00:27:32.441 --> 00:27:35.920
You all are lighters, torches

00:27:36.537 --> 00:27:39.076
and what kind of life you should have

00:27:39.277 --> 00:27:44.381
and a personality you should have, it is for you to decide.

00:27:52.092 --> 00:27:56.514
That’s the attention – gives the priorities.

00:27:58.396 --> 00:28:04.748
When you understand how your physical being, presence,

00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:09.464
this body of yours, has to be clean,

00:28:11.504 --> 00:28:18.090
has to be beautiful, has to be soft, kind,

00:28:19.113 --> 00:28:21.956
has to be elegant, dignified.

00:28:27.614 --> 00:28:33.144
I have seen people in groups,  when they are sitting down,

00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:38.881
behaving in a manner

00:28:39.082 --> 00:28:42.838
even an ordinarily educated person won’t behave.

00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:49.110
The reason is, you have not yet realised that you are the leaders

00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:52.732
and people are watching.

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:11.444
There should be kind of a masti… you might say, call it, masti(hindi

00:29:12.076 --> 00:29:16.674
should be satisfied with yourself.

00:29:17.574 --> 00:29:22.434
So on the physical aspect, what you eat, what you see,

00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:26.871
what you like, the whole priorities must change.

00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:32.543
What should be most important is Sahaja;

00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:39.188
in every circumstance, in every method, a habit – sahaja.

00:29:40.516 --> 00:29:44.561
Sahaja means is born with you, Sahaja doesn’t mean easy.

00:29:44.762 --> 00:29:47.045
Many people confuse.

00:29:48.295 --> 00:29:53.350
You have now got your right; that one was born with you.

00:30:02.693 --> 00:30:07.819
So for you, it is necessary to know that you are a Sahaja

00:30:08.115 --> 00:30:14.559
and that you are not going to accept anything that is asahaja.

00:30:15.483 --> 00:30:18.022
Sahaja means that!

00:30:20.337 --> 00:30:23.096
Sahaja means that you take

00:30:24.173 --> 00:30:27.552
the light of Sahaja above everything else over the darkness

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.118
and not to accept darkness which is asahaja.

00:30:31.992 --> 00:30:37.025
So how can you have any habits which give you sympathetic bondage?

00:30:43.861 --> 00:30:51.525
Sahaja means you have a special, subtle awareness.

00:30:51.978 --> 00:30:58.211
A king doesn’t clean the streets.

00:31:05.812 --> 00:31:09.703
On the physical side your attention is lost like that,

00:31:09.904 --> 00:31:15.273
because you indulge into all asahaja methods that you had before,

00:31:16.485 --> 00:31:18.508
that others have.

00:31:19.039 --> 00:31:22.443
You get lost into the asahaja system of life.

00:31:22.644 --> 00:31:25.632
You have to change the complete system of the whole world

00:31:25.888 --> 00:31:31.042
in which people become Sahaja and not asahaja.

00:31:32.565 --> 00:31:37.167
Then only the whole thing will become a Sahaja for you.

00:31:37.368 --> 00:31:40.667
It is a big misunderstanding about Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:40.887 --> 00:31:44.686
They think “Oh! When it will come sahaja, then we will do this work,

00:31:44.887 --> 00:31:48.031
then we’ll go around and talk to people, it should come sahaja,”

00:31:48.232 --> 00:31:49.750
nothing doing.

00:31:50.694 --> 00:31:52.906
This is a very wrong attitude.

00:31:53.107 --> 00:31:59.301
‘Sahaja’ means that you have got the light of Sahaja within you

00:31:59.609 --> 00:32:01.880
and how can you tolerate anything…

00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:05.726
…of your life is concerned, means

00:32:05.927 --> 00:32:12.106
you must know what to dress up, how to talk, where to go,

00:32:12.307 --> 00:32:14.950
whom to meet, who are your brothers,

00:32:15.151 --> 00:32:20.434
who are your sisters, who are your sons and who are your parents.

00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:28.309
That is how your attention is lost. Then your gross habits:

00:32:29.871 --> 00:32:31.918
Your old life that was there

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:34.692
which has to be just chiseled out, is to be finished.

00:32:34.856 --> 00:32:38.319
And you cannot go on, because if you go on,

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.741
you will catch up here and catch up there, then you’ll break your neck,

00:32:41.942 --> 00:32:43.975
you’ll come to Me, “Mother, I have broken my back

00:32:44.176 --> 00:32:45.913
and this has happened, that has happened,

00:32:46.114 --> 00:32:49.373
it’s paining, I’m getting hot, I’m getting headache, I am doing this.”

00:32:49.574 --> 00:32:52.522
Till you become Sahaja it will go on working on you.

00:32:52.723 --> 00:32:54.560
But why not become your Self?

00:32:54.845 --> 00:32:58.310
For example a human being cannot sleep like a dog, for example.

00:32:58.932 --> 00:33:02.383
If he starts sleeping like a dog because there are all dogs around,

00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:04.974
then he is going to get the pain.

00:33:05.349 --> 00:33:07.693
In the same way if you are going to be asahaja

00:33:07.894 --> 00:33:11.412
because all are asahajas, you are going to get into trouble.

00:33:11.643 --> 00:33:13.532
Because the dog doesn’t feel,

00:33:13.733 --> 00:33:16.719
though he might be getting pain, but he doesn’t feel it.

00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:20.914
But you definitely feel it.

00:33:21.172 --> 00:33:27.078
The person who is not yet to reborn, doesn’t feel it,

00:33:27.355 --> 00:33:30.415
he gets the problem but he doesn’t feel it, you can feel it,

00:33:30.616 --> 00:33:34.227
and you jolly-well have to give it up, sooner the better!

00:33:34.428 --> 00:33:37.374
If you don’t give it up then you are

00:33:38.076 --> 00:33:42.921
again going back to the same darkness and this new darkness

00:33:43.511 --> 00:33:48.330
may be hellish, it can be terrible.

00:33:49.345 --> 00:33:52.538
It’s better to die as human beings then,

00:33:53.006 --> 00:33:57.405
because then you can go on being born again as animals, this, that.

00:33:57.814 --> 00:34:04.850
But to be born again and knowing

00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:11.866
you go on back again to your former habits,

00:34:15.366 --> 00:34:18.608
it can be very dangerous.

00:34:23.491 --> 00:34:29.569
That’s how I fix your attention, with little fear into your mind,

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.566
to your subtler being.

00:34:32.767 --> 00:34:37.026
The subtler being can only enjoy.

00:34:37.383 --> 00:34:41.308
In the morning you did enjoy the meditation,

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:45.813
you had become subtler, I pushed you down there.

00:34:46.081 --> 00:34:50.589
But you have to keep yourself subtler by remembering,

00:34:50.894 --> 00:34:56.676
by remembering what has happened, how physically you felt nice.

00:34:59.723 --> 00:35:04.430
One of the worst habits that human beings have is to see the watch.

00:35:05.092 --> 00:35:07.039
It’s so painful to Me when I’m talking,

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.243
people see the watch. I just can’t bear it!

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.250
Because now you are beyond time, beyond space.

00:35:17.194 --> 00:35:21.788
What are you going to do by saving time? What have you done so far?

00:35:26.374 --> 00:35:32.420
That shows your priorities. Our priorities must change

00:35:32.977 --> 00:35:36.304
and you can change them easily once you start enjoying.

00:35:36.505 --> 00:35:44.835
Once you have tasted the nectar of Divine Love, the Amruta,

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.741
then you are not going to drink dirty water.

00:35:51.356 --> 00:35:55.483
But you first of all remember that, the joy that you enjoyed.

00:35:55.702 --> 00:36:01.062
That is one way of fixing, so-called fixing, your subtleties.

00:36:03.946 --> 00:36:07.592
It’s the attention which gets covered by gross things of life,

00:36:07.914 --> 00:36:12.670
even in the emotional side of it, for example, you have relationships.

00:36:13.865 --> 00:36:18.218
We have seen some Sahaja Yogis being lost like that.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.340
They had some very gross relationships with people,

00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:25.859
even gurus and some of them were friends

00:36:26.068 --> 00:36:29.086
and some other dirty relationships, you can say,

00:36:30.603 --> 00:36:35.406
and they couldn’t give up and they are lost.

00:36:37.484 --> 00:36:41.094
So you have to sit down and find out.

00:36:42.697 --> 00:36:46.976
“Why am I not enjoying myself? I am the loser.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.461
Because those things, if they were joy-giving,

00:36:52.662 --> 00:36:56.389
I would not have run towards them from one to another.

00:36:57.474 --> 00:37:03.740
They never satisfied me fully; so why to go back to them again?”

00:37:05.873 --> 00:37:10.373
The emotional enjoyments,

00:37:10.574 --> 00:37:16.068
which you regard as something very important,

00:37:16.269 --> 00:37:20.912
are also to be weighed in the new dimension of your

00:37:21.716 --> 00:37:25.179
attention and the subtleties.

00:37:30.861 --> 00:37:34.209
You consider somebody as your very-near-and-dear

00:37:34.451 --> 00:37:37.943
and you have a business relationship, or some sort of a…

00:37:38.144 --> 00:37:41.592
I don’t know, what sorts of human relations people have.

00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:45.238
You must know that it is very superficial

00:37:45.439 --> 00:37:47.854
and you cannot have any joy out of it.

00:37:48.189 --> 00:37:51.816
Like you drink water from a cup,

00:37:52.965 --> 00:38:00.246
now the cup itself is superficial, the water is superficial;

00:38:00.684 --> 00:38:05.581
the most important thing is your tongue which can feel the water.

00:38:06.518 --> 00:38:09.557
If the tongue cannot feel the water

00:38:09.758 --> 00:38:15.643
and if the water feels like stones, what’s the use of taking water?

00:38:15.844 --> 00:38:20.971
So the most important thing is the taste in the tongue, in the essence.

00:38:21.243 --> 00:38:26.721
In the same way the essence of our enjoyment is the joy

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:31.174
and the joy is in feeling the vibrations.

00:38:31.565 --> 00:38:36.768
So wherever you get the joy, you should have it.

00:38:37.432 --> 00:38:42.081
But the new awareness

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:46.283
is not so much gone into your being, that’s why this is a problem.

00:38:46.484 --> 00:38:50.298
Otherwise for human beings it is not difficult to tell him that,

00:38:50.499 --> 00:38:54.174
“This is nice, you drink.” He takes it and he knows it is nice.

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:56.737
He won’t eat something that is bitter.

00:38:56.954 --> 00:38:59.494
If you have to give him something horrible tasting,

00:38:59.695 --> 00:39:02.713
you’ll have to give him chocolate first and chocolate later.

00:39:03.532 --> 00:39:06.344
But human beings, when they become evolved,

00:39:06.545 --> 00:39:10.078
I have seen that they are more prone towards the horrible things

00:39:11.353 --> 00:39:14.885
because of their previous attractions.

00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:19.415
So, put your attention fully towards divine,

00:39:20.607 --> 00:39:23.623
pull it out, completely towards It.

00:39:23.886 --> 00:39:27.846
So that there is no attention left towards the gross side.

00:39:29.757 --> 00:39:32.466
Even now I find people coming and asking Me,

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:35.951
“Mataji, I have a problem, I want a job, what should I do?

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.569
Mother, this is to be done, that is to be done?”

00:39:39.998 --> 00:39:42.508
Of Course that is by-the-way is alright.

00:39:42.709 --> 00:39:44.813
But if that attracts your attention,

00:39:45.188 --> 00:39:49.704
means you have lost sense of your understanding

00:39:50.177 --> 00:39:54.046
that you are a sahaja yogi and that your joy

00:39:54.359 --> 00:39:58.798
is in the subtler side, and you can enjoy it.

00:39:58.999 --> 00:40:01.338
So these gross things are never going to give you joy,

00:40:01.539 --> 00:40:04.463
so why not ask for something that is going to give you

00:40:04.664 --> 00:40:09.925
that subtle joy which you can enjoy; only you can enjoy.

00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:15.199
So this is what happens to our attention.

00:40:15.784 --> 00:40:19.700
We get lost because of our previous ideas

00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:21.945
and our emotional bindings.

00:40:22.146 --> 00:40:24.860
And we can also say that

00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:30.367
our spiritual bindings, so-called, “We are Hindus, Muslims, Christians;

00:40:30.568 --> 00:40:35.919
we are vegetarians, non-vegetarians; we are

00:40:37.755 --> 00:40:40.653
”I don’t know, “We are Brahmins, non-Brahmins,

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.302
and all kind of things we are”, but we are not what we are.

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:50.053
And, all these things again also come back to you that,

00:40:50.254 --> 00:40:53.240
“We are Jains, so we are Jains, so we are very great people.”

00:40:53.445 --> 00:40:56.808
You get Me any Jain from anywhere or anyone from anywhere,

00:40:57.009 --> 00:40:59.333
does he have the sense of vibrations?

00:40:59.534 --> 00:41:02.045
Then how is it that person becomes your guru

00:41:02.246 --> 00:41:04.954
or that person can teach you about these things.

00:41:05.155 --> 00:41:08.029
You are now a master.

00:41:08.247 --> 00:41:10.095
Does the headmaster comes and learns

00:41:10.296 --> 00:41:12.875
from the boys who are admitted in the schools?

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:16.826
I have seen even a newcomer who comes in, if he has a badha,

00:41:17.027 --> 00:41:20.769
he can entice away at least 5% of Sahaja Yogis, easily.

00:41:21.406 --> 00:41:25.222
He will talk big, he will show-off and he can bring some guru inside

00:41:25.423 --> 00:41:28.433
and five percent will run after that, minimum.

00:41:29.871 --> 00:41:32.215
How do you explain it?

00:41:32.714 --> 00:41:35.550
Only thing is that you should not be one of them.

00:41:35.751 --> 00:41:38.558
Everyone should think for oneself and not for others.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.418
You should think that this, you are capable of or not?

00:41:43.128 --> 00:41:46.773
So in spiritual bindings also your attention is lost like that

00:41:46.974 --> 00:41:51.353
and all these dimensions are outside.

00:41:52.095 --> 00:41:59.504
Now in a description of Gokul, of Vrindavan,

00:42:01.456 --> 00:42:06.191
you must have read that when Krishna used to play His flute,

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.152
all the women who were working – the gopis in the household

00:42:10.353 --> 00:42:12.621
would leave every work, everything.

00:42:12.822 --> 00:42:17.925
The milk would be while boiling and they

00:42:22.647 --> 00:42:26.562
work was half-done or full-done;

00:42:26.827 --> 00:42:28.695
they were eating their food

00:42:28.896 --> 00:42:33.401
or in whatever pose they were sitting, they would just get up and run

00:42:33.852 --> 00:42:36.510
towards that murli (flute).

00:42:37.299 --> 00:42:42.080
And when they would go there; they would stand just like a picture,

00:42:44.529 --> 00:42:47.834
just like a picture, no movement in the body, nothing,

00:42:48.035 --> 00:42:52.476
just standing and listening  with full attention.

00:42:52.896 --> 00:42:55.131
What was so…?

00:42:56.701 --> 00:42:58.927
He was not even speaking.

00:42:59.128 --> 00:43:03.082
Just a murli being played and all of them just listening,

00:43:03.283 --> 00:43:06.871
like a picture. What was it?

00:43:08.709 --> 00:43:12.250
The enjoyment that they were feeling;

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:18.008
the enjoyment they were enjoying within themselves,

00:43:18.209 --> 00:43:21.198
the joy that was pouring into them with that murli

00:43:21.818 --> 00:43:25.854
just standing and listening, that’s all.

00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:28.299
What is that?

00:43:29.182 --> 00:43:33.698
That is the subtleness of that enjoyment.

00:43:40.963 --> 00:43:45.143
Just like meditation they would stand.

00:43:45.604 --> 00:43:51.993
In the same way your attention and mind should be

00:43:53.288 --> 00:43:59.838
on Sahaja, on your being, one with God.

00:44:01.267 --> 00:44:07.080
You are one with God; put your centrifugal force

00:44:07.297 --> 00:44:10.689
towards God, completely.

00:44:11.189 --> 00:44:16.346
Put yourself in connection, all the time, with God

00:44:16.547 --> 00:44:18.783
and the rest of the work is done,

00:44:19.132 --> 00:44:24.619
yantrawat, just like instruments, the whole thing, will start working.

00:44:27.132 --> 00:44:33.455
The human mind is used to do things in a ritual way.

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:36.486
That they think that, if you have to raise this house

00:44:36.703 --> 00:44:40.056
and you have to dig the… first the foundation,

00:44:40.299 --> 00:44:44.350
then the pile, piling up and then you have those pillars

00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:47.310
and then you have to have the roof.

00:44:48.614 --> 00:44:52.242
And, that is how, one after another they plan out things.

00:44:52.443 --> 00:44:58.092
But in God’s own kingdom there is no planning,

00:44:58.293 --> 00:45:01.529
you just sit down and you just enjoy!

00:45:03.179 --> 00:45:06.990
If your attention is there, all the work is done.

00:45:07.326 --> 00:45:09.873
Full attention and then He takes out work.

00:45:10.074 --> 00:45:13.066
And give full priority to that!

00:45:13.267 --> 00:45:15.754
Do not compromise your way through.

00:45:16.409 --> 00:45:21.144
You have to help others also to come up, so must remember,

00:45:21.361 --> 00:45:25.902
for that also, your attention should be on your Atma,

00:45:26.192 --> 00:45:33.508
on your Spirit, on God – completely one with Him in that joy.

00:45:35.393 --> 00:45:39.525
The whole heart is there and with your both hands and with your both feet,

00:45:40.182 --> 00:45:42.650
with all your attention you can pull out people,

00:45:42.851 --> 00:45:46.837
because your attention is all the time fed, nurtured and looked after.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.595
Then you will enjoy also the lifting of the people.

00:45:50.837 --> 00:45:55.118
Nothing can be alright, unless and until

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:59.186
you develop the subtleties of your attention.

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.704
And, they develop, by receding your attention from all that is gross.

00:46:05.283 --> 00:46:08.782
Recede your attention! whenever it goes too much into any thought like that,

00:46:08.983 --> 00:46:10.509
“Oh, Forget it!”

00:46:10.811 --> 00:46:14.548
But into vibrations pay full attention.

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:18.720
Seeing vibrations, you pay full attention;

00:46:19.298 --> 00:46:22.509
seeing your own vibrations, pay full attention.

00:46:22.711 --> 00:46:26.970
Other things you need not worry, they will be all looked after.

00:46:27.305 --> 00:46:33.836
That is how your attention is subtler in the Kingdom of God.

00:46:34.272 --> 00:46:36.681
The style is different.

00:46:36.882 --> 00:46:42.040
When the lotus is in the mud and it has to come out.

00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:47.493
It finds its way through many crevices and many

00:46:48.157 --> 00:46:52.587
holes in that mud,

00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:56.986
but when it is out, out in the open,

00:47:01.155 --> 00:47:04.586
absolutely liberated, free,

00:47:04.972 --> 00:47:07.572
then it does not go on dashing here and there,

00:47:07.773 --> 00:47:13.954
but just opens out and receives the beautiful dew.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:20.259
And the dew melts the fragrance in the lotus;

00:47:20.767 --> 00:47:23.118
automatically the fragrance starts flowing.

00:47:23.319 --> 00:47:26.759
It’s a different style altogether, its different method;

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.970
it’s a different way of life – that is being Sahaja.

00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:39.013
Just whether you are sleeping or you are awake, keep your attention…
