00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:15.410
…wobbling too much and how to fix the attention.
Now the quality of attention changes according

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:27.269
to the state of your evolution. For example,
in an animal…

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:52.850
So where is the attention placed in the human
being? It is not a fixed point. You can say,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:20.180
attention is the surface or the edge of awareness.
Wherever we are made aware, the attention

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:53.700
gets diverted to that point. If you can find
some analogy, all the files (filings) of iron

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:07.049
have got a power to be attracted towards the
magnet. Where is that power, you cannot locate

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:19.550
– it is all over. Wherever the magnet is
placed the files are attracted. Our attention

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:33.220
is also like that, that wherever we are attracted,
our attention goes there.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.730
It is existing in the whole body, in the sense
that it can be diverted anywhere, outside

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:57.820
the body. Also inside the body, in case if
there is any pain or there is any trouble.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:18.840
It floats over the nerves, it floats over
the whole nervous system, but there is a controlling

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:41.550
centre in the brain. If it is hit then we
can remain conscious, but without any attention.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:54.390
Also, if somebody is hit on the Vishuddhi
Chakra, it can happen. It can happen even

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:03.030
in the lower chakras if somebody is hit. That
portion will lose its attention because you

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:12.150
cannot feel, in that part.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:26.669
The difference is this, that you can pay attention
to those points, if you want to, even if they

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.780
are numbed. For example, if my hand is numb
I can pay attention to that, means I can look

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:45.949
at it, I can think of it, but there is a point
in our being [which], if that is hit then

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:56.509
we cannot even think, we are just lying unconscious
they say, but eyes are open, hands are moving,

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:07.889
legs are moving. That point is at the point
of Vishuddhi Chakra here. And if you can draw

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:21.749
a line from here to the point where is the
peetha of Vishuddhi Chakra is inside, inside

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:34.870
the brain; along that line if you are hit
anywhere you become attention-less, you cannot

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:55.110
pay attention anywhere. This line passes through,
also, Agya Chakra. Because when this point

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:13.229
is connected with Vishuddhi Chakra at the
back, in here, and at the peetha inside, then

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:25.120
a kind of a triangle is formed and all this
line or this area can affect your attention.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:42.909
Your heart is moving, your limbs are moving
but you are not paying attention anywhere.

00:06:42.909 --> 00:07:02.319
So when you pay attention to something, actually
you pay attention, normally – when you are

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:17.039
not realised – through your brain centres.
After realisation, you can pay attention through

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:31.789
your other centres also. You do pay. This
is a very big difference between a person

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:38.370
who is realised and who is not realised. Or
you can say that you can become effective

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:49.360
through your other centres by paying attention
to them. You can feel the centres which are

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:57.319
obstructed in your body, which you never felt
before. Not only that, but you can feel the

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:13.479
centres of other people. That means your central
nervous system is being blessed by a new awareness

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:22.120
by which it can convey to you, communicate
to you, the attention paid by your centres

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:30.729
and also it can take your attention in a subtler
way into the centres of others.

00:08:30.729 --> 00:08:40.979
So, first thing that happens to you is that
your attention becomes subtler. Attention

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:58.260
becoming subtler means you start understanding
deeper things. For example, a bird can see

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:13.490
a flower but cannot feel the beauty of a flower.
And a unrealised person can see the beauty

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:27.570
of a flower, but cannot see the vibrations
of the flower. So you become subtler, your

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:38.080
attention becomes subtler. You definitely
are at a higher evolutionary stage than the

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.710
other people are.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:10:00.430
Now we have to see how we use our attention.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:09.350
You have seen, even when you were not realised,
that, supposing you start developing an art

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:20.300
in your hand from your very childhood, then
you develop the deftness of that particular

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:31.940
art, because a kind of a myelin sheath grows
on the nerves. In the same way, when you are

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:44.070
realised, I would say when you are a newly
born person, if you start respecting your

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:58.500
attention then gradually you develop a deftness
for Sahaja Yoga. But so many people, when

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:08.560
they get realised, they hardly come second
time. Even if they come second time, they

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:23.340
do not develop the feeling of vibrations more,
they still go on being busy with their day-to-day

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:38.950
work, wasting their attention on things which
do not give you the subtler feeling. So the

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:58.450
subtleness, the deftness of the art of Sahaja
does not develop itself.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:12.990
For example, I would say a person who is over-read,
as soon as he gets his realisation he starts

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:24.170
tallying it with what he has read, this makes
his attention again wasted. As it is, his

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:32.260
attention has been fixed by these conventional
ideas; some of them are correct, some are

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:38.190
incorrect, some are absolutely faulty, some
are useless. Some are only because they wanted

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:50.390
to make money, they have published some trash.
As soon as you get realisation, you go back

00:12:50.390 --> 00:13:04.020
to your own gross awareness and start tallying
this subtle with the gross, so you start again

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:15.280
losing your vibrations. Actually after getting
realisation I have seen, with small children,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:26.630
they sleep for very long hours. They become
little inactive for some time. But if an elder

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:33.590
gets it he will immediately go to the book
store, buy one book on Kundalini and start

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:37.390
reading about it.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:49.650
Then some of you, not understanding that you
have become somebody else, take it for granted,

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:57.770
“Alright, Mataji has been very kind; She
says I am far, but how am I to believe?”

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:06.200
As if by believing it they are going to give
some money to Me or I don’t know what they

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.230
are going to give. “I can see the vibrations
coming, but what’s the use of getting the

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:15.980
vibrations? Why did She give us vibrations?”Again
come back to the gross idea of utility, because

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:22.820
that’s human nature, has been so far, to
make everything into utility. Everything must

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:31.540
be utilised, you see. Man thinks no end of
himself. So he starts putting his realisation

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:40.850
into utility. “What utility it has? How
many people are going to get it? What is going

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.320
to happen? What is the ratio? What is the
schedule? What is this? What is that?”

00:14:42.320 --> 00:15:00.350
You have been given this subtleness to enjoy.
Like, if we enjoy the beauty of flower, we

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:06.710
just enjoy. Do we go to the books and find
out: “What we should do about with this

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.330
enjoyment of ours? How to enjoy this flower?”
And then “what to do?” And, “Who has

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:23.320
described about the flowers, so let us see
if this is fitting into that?” But is done

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:29.410
very commonly and I really don’t know how
to say, because it’s such a foolish thing.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:35.970
And I am only afraid that, sometimes, if I
say, they will feel hurt, and, as human beings

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.790
are, they get hurt for nothing at all. That’s
very foolish.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.450
Children are very sensible that way. Once
they get it they start enjoying it. They just

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:50.410
enjoy it. They just sleep off! They are not
bothered. They think, that it’s something

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:59.000
that is to be enjoyed, “Let us enjoy it.”
So at the very outset it happens like that.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:08.160
And the man doesn’t know that how he has
made himself even much more gross than he

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:17.230
was ever in this kaliyuga, in these modern
times: by organising things according to his

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:29.550
own ideas and conceptions. He has become so
unnatural, so foolish that discrimination

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:46.390
between joy and ugliness, he does not have.
He’s so confused.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:55.060
So, first of all, it is not only one reason
but there are many reasons. And as I described

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:18.909
to you, inherently, it is the human, gross
activities before realisation. If you understand

00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:24.709
the disease, from where it has come, sometimes
it’s easier to correct it. You cannot just

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:30.149
correct the disease without understanding
the history behind it. If you are a student

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:38.029
of history you will know how human beings
have behaved. I mean, you just start wondering,

00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:43.350
what’s wrong with these people? God created
one world! I mean just think, a person like

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:49.590
Me coming on this earth, suddenly you find
there are so many countries being created.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:54.860
Alright created, you can have separate countries
if you cannot manage the whole world together,

00:17:54.860 --> 00:18:02.149
but then the fighting going on, killing each
other. All kinds of problems for nothing at

00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:06.860
all, I mean it’s such a madhouse!

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:19.179
So historically if you see how man has made
himself mad – it’s not easy (laughing)

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:31.649
to compile all that in one lecture, you’ll
have to write volumes. I think there are already

00:18:31.649 --> 00:18:39.620
written volumes.So, there is [a] historical
background, which has spoilt your attention.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.120
Physically, those who come for physical handicap
or physical trouble or something like that

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:51.159
because they are sick, are sometime little
better than the people who do not have this,

00:18:51.159 --> 00:18:56.860
because they definitely get the relief part
of the joy. If they get their relief, there

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:02.899
is a little shadow of joy that they feel and,
then they start understanding that it is to

00:19:02.899 --> 00:19:14.129
be enjoyed. But I would say, they too once
they get the relief they just disappear. Not

00:19:14.129 --> 00:19:27.470
understanding that there is something greater
than this to be tasted and enjoyed.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:36.899
And the physical enjoyment in Sahaja Yoga,
itself, is sufficient to keep your attention

00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:44.059
subtler. You do not have to fix your attention
but you have to get subtler and subtler in

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:45.159
your attention.

00:19:45.159 --> 00:19:55.340
Fixing up of your attention, as you know,
is a very wrong method. That was done by some

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.960
yogis and you know what is the result of that:
their chakras were all broken and finished.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.720
When they fixed their attention onto Agya
Chakra, you have seen that Agya Chakra is

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:12.440
broken. You are not to fix any attention but
you have to make your attention subtler and

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.179
subtler.

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:21.259
As I told you that a magnet, when brought
say near the stones nothing happens to the

00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:25.460
stones, they are just there; you move the
magnet any way you like. But when you take

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:36.200
it to the iron filings, only, the filings
are attracted towards the magnet. In the same

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:47.350
way the attention of a Sahaja Yogi should
be so subtle that he should feel the vibrations,

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:59.529
he should think of vibrations, he should eat
vibration, drink vibration and enjoy them.

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:04.649
On the physical side, many people tell Me
that, “We went to their house and they offered

00:21:04.649 --> 00:21:09.580
me laddoos and I had to eat. What can you
do, Mataji?” Actually, you see, they felt

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:15.279
attracted towards the shape of the laddoos.
They ate it, but they didn’t see the vibrations

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:22.019
of those laddoos, they just ate it off and
then they had a stomach trouble. When they

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:25.809
have a stomach trouble, then they said, “Mataji,
we have lost our vibrations, now what to do?

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:31.309
We ate the laddoos.” But if you had seen
that there are no vibrations in that laddoo,

00:21:31.309 --> 00:21:35.330
you should have said that, “Today I am not
supposed to eat anything,” or something

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:43.860
like that, and you should not have eaten them!
If you see a born-realised child, he will

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:49.330
never eat. Even the mother beats the child,
he’ll say, “Alright, beat me but I’m

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.360
not going to eat it!” Because they are not
going to eat the filth, such children are

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.350
supposed to be very obstinate, they think
they are obstinate. Because they know, “There

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:04.340
is no vibration, so why should we eat because
we are not going to enjoy.”

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.409
So on the physical side, there are so many
such mistakes you have committed. If you take

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:16.919
to now, say habits you have, supposing you
have a habit of say, pulling your hair. There

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:21.580
was some lady who had a habit of pulling her
hair and she used to become bald here, then

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:31.360
bald here, then bald here and the hair used
to grow this side, then she used to have a

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:39.950
bald head here. Then she will pull her hair
here. Such a person! So she came to Me for

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.919
treatment. Imagine! So I told her, “Why
do you do like this?” She says, “Now my

00:22:42.919 --> 00:22:46.940
attention is like that, it always starts pulling
my hair.” I said, “What to do? Such an

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:53.210
attention you have got!” So, you know her
elder sister used to beat her on her hand,

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.600
any time she put her hand. She said, “You
must beat me, if you don’t beat me I’ll

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.799
beat you.” But the beating was on and everybody
used to look at them, “What are they doing

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:06.389
between each other?” And still, you see,
she could not stop it! All habits are like

00:23:06.389 --> 00:23:12.610
this monkey business. All of them are like
that, because the matter is trying to sit

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:18.320
on top of our attention, all the time, and
so we form habits. Certain habits are alright,

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.399
convenient, and convenience like that.

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:25.830
I mean some people to break habits, you know,
they say “We’ll not sit on the ground

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.350
nor sit on the chair.” “So where will
you sit?” “We’ll sit in a sitting pose

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.700
and we’ll practice that sort of a thing.”
I mean you need not do such a nonsense. I’m

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:40.899
meaning that certain things are alright, don’t
go to extremes. But certain habits that we

00:23:40.899 --> 00:23:47.690
acquired, is mostly because of fashions. And
we start, because somebody’s smoking, he

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:54.769
forces you, he says “Alright”, and one
bad habit we have got, is not to say no to

00:23:54.769 --> 00:23:54.989
anyone.

00:23:54.989 --> 00:23:58.980
“How to say ‘No’, you see, they were
all drinking and they offered us drinks and

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:04.730
we said ‘No,’ but they were just forcing
us. Then it looked very bad, you know, not

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:12.830
to drink and… And they offered one cup,
glass of drink to me and then I said, ‘Alright,

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:20.159
I’ll have very little sip,’ you know one
day and then I had it like that. And then

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:28.799
my relations, you see, they came and they
invited us for dinner and we had to go, and

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:33.429
then they started a cabaret dance, you know,
and we had to see, after all it would look

00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:42.419
very bad not to see a naked woman.”(laughing)
“Oh, we are very innocent people!” So

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:46.519
we go on explaining, “What to do now, this
is the society, this is the fashion, this

00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:54.850
is the style, this is how it is.”

00:24:54.850 --> 00:25:05.330
But a Sahaja Yogi is a special one, he’s
a chosen one. Because you haven’t got your

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:16.230
own value. tumala kimat nai sataji (Marathi)
You have not valued yourself as I have valued

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:30.299
you. This is a fact which very few realise
really, that to get realisation like this,

00:25:30.299 --> 00:25:39.730
there must be something tremendous that Mataji
must have done. She must have put in lot of

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:48.999
labour, to work this out Herself; She must
have done tremendous tapasyas in all Her lives.

00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:56.610
And even in this life She must have worked
very hard, day in and day out. And here we

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:06.230
are when we get it, how common place the whole
thing is, how we are about it.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:11.259
I thought by giving realisation you will immediately
see your value and you’ll think that you

00:26:11.259 --> 00:26:23.100
are something great and that you have got
this realisation and the sakshatkar, but it

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:34.950
is not so. And you start compromising with
gross things in life.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:46.850
There is a huge populace which is to be led
by one of you. One of you can lead all of

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:58.299
them. Leaders do not compromise, leaders do
not solve the problems of the people whom

00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:06.690
they lead, but they give them problems to
be solved. They stand above them, they are

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:14.179
much above them, they do not compromise, they
do not bend. Others bend before them.

00:27:14.179 --> 00:27:27.369
If the light starts falling and faltering
on the roads, what will the person do who

00:27:27.369 --> 00:27:38.269
is carrying the light in the hand? You all
are like the torches and what kind of life

00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:51.049
you should have and a personality you should
have, it is for you to decide. That’s the

00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:58.700
attention – gives the priorities.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:11.720
When you understand how your physical bringing,
presence, this body of yours, has to be clean,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:25.980
has to be beautiful, has to be soft, kind,
has to be elegant, dignified.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:39.149
I have seen people in groups, when you are
sitting down, behaving in a manner [that]

00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:45.460
even an ordinarily educated person won’t
behave. The reason is, you have not yet realised

00:28:45.460 --> 00:29:12.480
that you are the leaders and people are watching
you. There should be a kind of a masti, should

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.519
be satisfied with yourself.

00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:25.429
So on the physical aspect, what you eat, what
you see, what you like, the whole priorities

00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:36.299
must change. What should be most important
is Sahaja; in every circumstance, in every

00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:44.249
method, a habit – sahaja.
Sahaja means is born with you, Sahaja doesn’t

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:55.619
mean easy. Many people confuse. You have now
got your right; that one was born with you.

00:29:55.619 --> 00:30:11.070
So for you, it is necessary to know that you
are a Sahaja and that you are not going to

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:23.909
accept anything that is asahaja. Sahaja means
that! Sahaja means that you take the light

00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:31.169
of Sahaja above everything else over the darkness
and not to accept darkness which is asahaja.

00:30:31.169 --> 00:30:44.809
So how can you have any habits which give
you sympathetic bondage? Sahaja means you

00:30:44.809 --> 00:31:01.409
have a special, subtle awareness. A king doesn’t
clean the streets.

00:31:01.409 --> 00:31:12.629
On the physical side your attention is lost
like that, because you indulge into all asahaja

00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:22.399
methods that you had before, that others have.
You get lost into the asahaja system of life.

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:27.899
You have to change the complete system of
the whole world in which people become Sahaja

00:31:27.899 --> 00:31:36.639
and not asahaja. Then only the whole thing
will become a Sahaja for you.

00:31:36.639 --> 00:31:42.549
It is a big misunderstanding about Sahaja
Yogis. They think “Oh! When it will come

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:47.749
sahaja, then we will do this work, then we’ll
go around and talk to people – it should

00:31:47.749 --> 00:31:55.919
come sahaja,” nothing doing. This is a very
wrong attitude. ‘Sahaja’ means that you

00:31:55.919 --> 00:32:01.159
have got the light of Sahaja within you and
how can you tolerate anything…

00:32:01.159 --> 00:32:02.239
(break in recording)

00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:11.509
…of your life is concerned, means you must
know what to dress up, how to talk, where

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:18.159
to go, whom to meet, who are your brothers,
who are your sisters, who are your sons and

00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:31.029
who are your parents. That is how your attention
is lost.Then your gross habits: Your old life

00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:36.700
that was there which has to be just chiseled
out, is to be finished.And you cannot go on,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.549
because if you go on, you will catch up here
and catch up there, then you’ll break your

00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:44.950
neck, you’ll come to Me, “Mother, I have
broken my back and this has happened, that

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:49.350
has happened, it’s paining, I’m getting
hot, I’m getting headache, I am doing this.”

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:54.609
Till you become Sahaja it will go on working
on you. But why not become your Self?

00:32:54.609 --> 00:32:59.570
For example a human being cannot sleep like
a dog, for example. If he starts sleeping

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:05.269
like a dog because there are all dogs around,
then he is going to get the pain. In the same

00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:13.369
way if you are going to be asahaja because
all are asahajas, you are going to get into

00:33:13.369 --> 00:33:15.460
trouble. Because the dog doesn’t feel, though
he might be getting pain, but he doesn’t

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:26.470
feel it. But you definitely feel it. The person
who is not yet to reborn, doesn’t feel it,

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:32.629
he gets the problem but he doesn’t feel
it, you can feel it, and you jolly-well have

00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:39.470
to give it up, sooner the better! If you don’t
give it up then you are again going back to

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:46.820
the same darkness and this new darkness may
be hellish, it can be terrible.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:55.929
It’s better to die as human beings then,
because then you can go on being born again

00:33:55.929 --> 00:34:07.929
as animals, this, that. But to be born again
and knowing [the Truth], [if] you go on back

00:34:07.929 --> 00:34:25.879
again to your former habits, it can be very
dangerous. That’s how I fix your attention,

00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:37.530
with little fear into your mind, to your subtler
being. The subtler being can only enjoy. In

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:45.760
the morning you did enjoy the meditation,
you had become subtler, I pushed you down

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:54.159
there. But you have to keep yourself subtler
by remembering, by remembering what has happened,

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.909
how physically you felt nice.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:06.150
One of the worst habits that human beings
have is to see the watch. It’s so painful

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:17.520
to Me when I’m talking, people see the watch.
I just can’t bear it! Because now you are

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:29.849
beyond time, beyond space. What are you going
to do by saving time? What have you done so

00:35:29.849 --> 00:35:34.780
far? That shows your priorities. Our priorities
must change and you can change them easily

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:45.700
once you start enjoying. Once you have tasted
the nectar of Divine Love, the Amruta, then

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:53.510
you are not going to drink dirty water. But
you first of all remember that, the joy that

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:58.520
you enjoyed. That is one way of fixing, so-called
fixing, your subtleties.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:09.069
It’s the attention which gets covered by
gross things of life, even in the emotional

00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:17.230
side of it, for example, you have relationships.
We have seen some Sahaja Yogis being lost

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:24.650
like that. They had some very gross relationships
with people, even gurus and some of them were

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:32.849
friends and some other dirty relationships,
you can say, and they couldn’t give up and

00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:35.460
they are lost.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:47.890
So you have to sit down and find out. “Why
am I not enjoying myself? I am the loser.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:55.099
Because those things, if they were joy-giving,
I would not have run towards them from one

00:36:55.099 --> 00:37:06.770
to another. They never satisfied me fully;
so why to go back to them again?”

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:17.770
The emotional enjoyments, which you regard
as something very important, are also to be

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:32.109
weighed in the new dimension of your attention
and the subtleties. You consider somebody

00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:37.599
as your very-near-and-dear and you have a
business relationship, or some sort of a…I

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:44.750
don’t know, what sorts of human relations
people have. You must know that it is very

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:55.119
superficial and you cannot have any joy out
of it. Like you drink water from a cup, now

00:37:55.119 --> 00:38:02.400
the cup itself is superficial, the water is
superficial; the most important thing is your

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:11.150
tongue which can feel the water. If the tongue
cannot feel the water and if the water feels

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:19.260
like stones, what’s the use of taking water?
So the most important thing is the taste in

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.460
the tongue, in the essence.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:29.880
In the same way the essence of our enjoyment
is the joy and the joy is in feeling the vibrations.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:44.390
So wherever you get the joy, you should have
it. But the new awareness is not so much gone

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:51.020
into your being, that’s why this is a problem.
Otherwise for human beings it is not difficult

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:55.339
to tell him that, “This is nice, you drink.”
He takes it and he knows it is nice. He won’t

00:38:55.339 --> 00:39:00.510
eat something that is bitter. If you have
to give him something horrible tasting, you’ll

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:05.890
have to give him chocolate first and chocolate
later. But human beings, when they become

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:13.210
evolved, I have seen that they are more prone
towards the horrible things because of their

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:22.109
previous attractions. So, put your attention
fully towards divine, pull it out, completely

00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:29.020
towards It. So that there is no attention
left towards the gross side.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:35.150
Even now I find people coming and asking Me,
“Mataji, I have a problem, I want a job,

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:41.619
what should I do? Mother, this is to be done,
that is to be done?” Of Course that is by-the-way

00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:50.309
is alright. But if that attracts your attention,
means you have lost sense of your understanding

00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:58.319
that you are a sahaja yogi and that your joy
is in the subtler form, and you can enjoy

00:39:58.319 --> 00:40:03.010
it. So these gross things are never going
to give you joy, so why not ask for something

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:09.420
that is going to give you that subtle joy
which you can enjoy; only you can enjoy.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:19.859
So this is what happens to our attention.
We get lost because of our previous ideas

00:40:19.859 --> 00:40:27.599
and our emotional bindings. And we can also
say that our spiritual bindings, so-called,

00:40:27.599 --> 00:40:35.740
“We are Hindus, Muslims, Christians; we
are vegetarians, non-vegetarians; we are -” I

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:42.950
don’t know, “We are Brahmins, non-Brahmins,
and all kind of things we are”, but we are

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:48.970
not what we are.
And, all these things again also come back

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:53.990
to you that, “We are Jains, so we are Jains,
so we are very great people.” You get Me

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:59.960
any Jain from anywhere or anyone from anywhere,
does he have the sense of vibrations? Then

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:05.230
how is it that person becomes your guru or
that person can teach you about these things.

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:12.049
You are now a master. Does the headmaster
comes and learns from the boys who are admitted

00:41:12.049 --> 00:41:15.549
in the schools?
I have seen even a newcomer who comes in,

00:41:15.549 --> 00:41:21.240
if he has a badha, he can entice away at least
5% of Sahaja Yogis, easily. He will talk big,

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:26.279
he will show-off and he can bring some guru
inside and five percent will run after that,

00:41:26.279 --> 00:41:36.279
minimum. How do you explain it? Only thing
is that you should not be one of them. Everyone

00:41:36.279 --> 00:41:40.680
should think for oneself and not for others.
You should think that this, you are capable

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:47.980
of or not? So in spiritual bindings also your
attention is lost like that and all these

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.359
dimensions are outside.

00:41:52.359 --> 00:42:04.119
Now in a description of Gokul, of Vrindavan,
you must have read that when Krishna used

00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:10.390
to play His flute, all the women who were
working – the gopis in the household – would

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:24.130
leave every work, everything. The milk would
be while boiling and they – work was half-done

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:31.240
or full-done; they were eating their food
or in whatever pose they were sitting, they

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:39.430
would just get up and run towards that murli
(flute). And when they would go there; they

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:46.210
would stand just like a picture, chitrawat
se thade – just like a picture, no movement

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:57.230
in the body, nothing, just standing and listening
with full attention. What was so…? He was

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:05.700
not even speaking. Just a murli being played
and all of them just listening, like a picture.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:17.210
What was it? The enjoyment that they were
feeling; the enjoyment they were enjoying

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:23.160
within themselves, the joy that was pouring
into them with that murli – just standing

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:39.930
and listening, that’s all. What is that?
That is the subtleness of that enjoyment.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:53.559
Just like meditation they would stand. In
the same way your attention and mind should

00:43:53.559 --> 00:44:00.109
be on Sahaja, on your being, one with God.

00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:12.109
You are one with God; put your centrifugal
force towards God, completely. Put yourself

00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:22.770
in connection, all the time, with God and
the rest of the work is done, yantrawat, just

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:27.779
like instruments, the whole thing, will start
working.

00:44:27.779 --> 00:44:35.490
The human mind is used to do things in a ritual
way. That they think that, if you have to

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:42.609
raise this house now you have to dig the…first
the foundation, then the pile, piling up and

00:44:42.609 --> 00:44:50.690
then you have those pillars and then you have
to have the roof. And, that is how, one after

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:57.520
another they plan out things. But in God’s
own kingdom there is no planning, you just

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.099
sit down and you just enjoy!

00:45:00.099 --> 00:45:09.839
If your attention is there, all the work is
done. Full attention and then He takes out

00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:17.589
work. And give full priority to that! Do not
compromise your way through. You have to help

00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:24.010
others also to come up, so [you] must remember,
for that also, your attention should be on

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:36.279
your Atma, on your Spirit, on God – completely
one with Him in that joy. The whole heart

00:45:36.279 --> 00:45:41.750
is there and with your both hands and with
your both feet, with all your attention you

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:48.369
can pull out people, because your attention
is all the time fed, nurtured and looked after.

00:45:48.369 --> 00:45:51.640
Then you will enjoy also the lifting of the
people.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:59.789
Nothing can be alright, unless and until you
develop the subtleties of your attention.

00:45:59.789 --> 00:46:06.609
And, they develop, by receding your attention
from all that is gross. Recede your attention!

00:46:06.609 --> 00:46:12.730
whenever it goes too much into any thought
like that, “Oh, Forget it!” But into vibrations

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:19.819
pay full attention. Seeing vibrations, you
pay full attention; seeing your own vibrations,

00:46:19.819 --> 00:46:27.529
pay full attention. Other things you need
not worry, they will be all looked after.

00:46:27.529 --> 00:46:37.380
That is how your attention is subtler in the
Kingdom of God. The style is different.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:45.819
When the lotus is in the mud and it has to
come out. It finds its way through many crevices

00:46:45.819 --> 00:47:04.859
and many holes in that mud, but when it is
out, out in the open, absolutely liberated,

00:47:04.859 --> 00:47:12.869
free, then it does not go on dashing here
and there, but just opens out and receives

00:47:12.869 --> 00:47:24.260
the beautiful dew. And the dew melts the fragrance
in the lotus; automatically the fragrance

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:32.289
starts flowing. It’s a different style altogether,
its different method; it’s a different way

00:47:32.289 --> 00:47:40.829
of life – that is being Sahaja. Just whether
you are sleeping or you are awake, keep your attention…
