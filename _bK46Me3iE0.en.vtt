WEBVTT

00:53.000 --> 00:56.800
I am very happy to see you all here.

00:56.800 --> 01:12.390
I went to Iran in the year 1971, and I was
surprised that the people there were just

01:12.390 --> 01:20.090
prepared to get their realization; and at
that time, you had this king ruling there.

01:20.090 --> 01:27.000
We had a program in some hall and many people
got their realization.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.759
And after that, all these problems came in
and I couldn’t keep contact with them at

01:34.759 --> 01:41.899
all; but they must be somewhere, all of them
who got their realization at that time.

01:41.899 --> 01:50.659
Also some people were cured with Sahaja Yoga.

01:50.659 --> 01:58.159
Now the time has come for us to be awakened.

01:58.159 --> 02:05.289
All these problems of fundamentalism, which
have not only troubled you – they have fundamentalism

02:05.289 --> 02:13.470
everywhere, the whole world – there are
Christians who are fundamentalists, there

02:13.470 --> 02:19.750
are Jews who are fundamentalists, all kinds
of things they are doing.

02:19.750 --> 02:31.019
As you have seen that, how so many Muslims
were killed in Yugoslavia, and now many Muslims

02:31.019 --> 02:32.550
are killing.

02:32.550 --> 02:39.329
It’s going on between this and that area.

02:39.329 --> 02:44.909
Nobody has business to kill anyone, but it
is happening.

02:44.909 --> 02:51.940
The reason is that it has gone into their
heads that they are perfect, they have got

02:51.940 --> 02:52.940
everything.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.799
This is the worst thing that has happened
in the name of God.

02:56.799 --> 03:08.790
God can never make some people available to
religion and others not.

03:08.790 --> 03:20.409
These are all great saints, seers, prophets,
incarnations, born on the same tree of life.

03:20.409 --> 03:28.580
Only people pluck those flowers, and they
are fighting with these dead flowers.

03:28.580 --> 03:31.750
Everybody is in danger of this.

03:31.750 --> 03:32.750
Everybody.

03:32.750 --> 03:44.930
Now these Shias who are in Iraq are in danger;
they are hounded out by this Saddam Hussein.

03:44.930 --> 03:47.670
For no reason.

03:47.670 --> 03:58.519
Kurds are in another trouble; it is impossible
to understand that they never see that they

03:58.519 --> 04:03.400
are doing such horrible things in the name
of God.

04:03.400 --> 04:07.200
So, awakening is needed.

04:07.200 --> 04:12.969
Unless and until you are awakened, you never
understand it.

04:12.969 --> 04:19.070
Now there’s a Sahaja Yogi who is a Muslim,
and his wife is a French lady.

04:19.070 --> 04:25.090
They have written a very nice book explaining
Koran very clearly.

04:25.090 --> 04:40.509
We had about 62 people from different countries,
like Algeria, all these other countries around

04:40.509 --> 04:51.720
Mediterranean Sea, African countries – Senegal
– who were communists, and they think now

04:51.720 --> 05:01.520
they have lost their faith in communism, so
maybe the people might fall into fundamentalism,

05:01.520 --> 05:06.060
and they are very much worried about it.

05:06.060 --> 05:12.750
So they are all coming to India for about
five days, they are going to have a proper

05:12.750 --> 05:15.560
understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

05:15.560 --> 05:21.760
Sahaja Yoga is the culmination of all the
religions.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.060
As Mohammed Sahab has said, “You have to
be a wali."

05:26.060 --> 05:31.360
He has talked about resurrection, Kiyama,
a complete chapter is there.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.380
But they don’t want to talk about it.

05:34.380 --> 05:41.229
And the shariat that they are using is actually
from the five angels from the five books.

05:41.229 --> 05:48.740
The third book of Jeremiah, where in English
they call it Jeremiah, where Moses is the

05:48.740 --> 05:56.919
one who talked of this shariat because when
He came from the mountain of Toor he found

05:56.919 --> 06:06.520
the people were absolutely getting into complete
decadence conditions, absolutely.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.940
All kinds of horrible things they were doing.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.060
He got a fright.

06:11.060 --> 06:16.210
He said, “How can I tell them about these
Ten Commandments; they will never listen to

06:16.210 --> 06:20.360
Me, they have gone beyond any redemption."

06:20.360 --> 06:25.699
So then, because they were so badly o , He
made these rules of shariat.

06:25.699 --> 06:31.590
For the Jews, not for the Muslims.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.789
That time there were no Muslims.

06:34.789 --> 06:41.849
But the Muslims took all these five angels
as a part of their religion.

06:41.849 --> 06:49.600
Out of that, they picked up this and they
started using this shariat.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.060
Shariat is not in Koran.

06:51.060 --> 06:55.569
Mohammed Sahab did not take a note of it,
I think.

06:55.569 --> 07:03.720
Shariat is in this another five books of the
Old Testament.

07:03.720 --> 07:12.310
So this was taken over so much by the Muslims
because other religions are more money-oriented.

07:12.310 --> 07:14.940
Christian religion is more money-oriented.

07:14.940 --> 07:17.639
They want to make money in the name of God.

07:17.639 --> 07:22.240
But Muslims thought better to take to power.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.560
So they made it power-oriented.

07:24.560 --> 07:29.009
To make it power-oriented, they had to suppress
the people, they had to tell them that, “You

07:29.009 --> 07:33.360
can’t do this, you can’t do that, this
is not proper, that is not proper, otherwise

07:33.360 --> 07:41.229
if you do like this, we’ll cut your throat
or your hands will be cut."

07:41.229 --> 07:45.130
And they do all these things, no doubt, because
I’ve been to Iraq.

07:45.130 --> 07:54.449
On every Friday people are buried alive in
the hot sand.

07:54.449 --> 07:59.900
Only their heads are kept out, and so may
people go to watch it.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.250
They really enjoy watching them.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.690
So horrible it is.

08:03.690 --> 08:11.139
They are just burning inside, the hot sand
is burning them, they can’t get out, and

08:11.139 --> 08:16.050
only you can see their faces and then they
ultimately die.

08:16.050 --> 08:22.250
This kind of cruelty, how can’t be possible
for God to do, because He is Rahimmath, He

08:22.250 --> 08:27.300
is Rahim.

08:27.300 --> 08:34.219
And it is even worse than gas chamber I can
tell you, because you see in front of you

08:34.219 --> 08:37.419
somebody dying like that.

08:37.419 --> 08:43.240
But when they are there, they don’t drink,
they don’t smoke.

08:43.240 --> 08:47.360
They do it; secretly they do.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.970
Once I was traveling from Riyadh to London
and I slept o .

08:51.970 --> 08:54.670
When I opened My eyes they were all in burka.

08:54.670 --> 08:57.840
They had come in burka, they had covered themselves
up and everything.

08:57.840 --> 09:04.690
When I got up I saw very fashionable ladies,
very fashionable.

09:04.690 --> 09:06.550
I thought we stopped somewhere, or what.

09:06.550 --> 09:11.459
So I asked the air hostess, “Did we stop
somewhere?”

09:11.459 --> 09:14.170
Said, “No, it’s a direct fight."

09:14.170 --> 09:17.920
I said, “How these ladies, how have they
come in?”

09:17.920 --> 09:19.110
They said, “They are the same.

09:19.110 --> 09:21.700
You see they are wearing the burka and all
that."

09:21.700 --> 09:28.440
Now see, this is what, they were painting
themselves, they were all doing everything.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.310
So this is unnatural.

09:30.310 --> 09:33.630
Mohammed Sahab was a very practical man.

09:33.630 --> 09:37.060
He would never have said something unnatural.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.890
Is very unnatural.

09:38.890 --> 09:42.740
Of course, he asked the women to cover themselves
up.

09:42.740 --> 09:46.710
Also one of the reasons is that the place
is full of dust.

09:46.710 --> 09:50.649
Even the men cover their heads bound like
that.

09:50.649 --> 09:52.240
So full of dust.

09:52.240 --> 09:58.930
And He respected women so much.

09:58.930 --> 10:07.810
He thought that the women should not be abused
as prostitutes, so He said whatever it is

10:07.810 --> 10:10.769
because there were very few men, very few.

10:10.769 --> 10:13.300
Most of the young men had died.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.300
And so many women.

10:14.300 --> 10:17.650
He said, “You marry five times will be alright,
but marry.

10:17.650 --> 10:23.579
Don’t have women who are like prostitutes."

10:23.579 --> 10:29.120
So, to give importance to marriage, He married
himself.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.800
And He made others also marry.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.529
But it’s not compulsory that you should
marry.

10:33.529 --> 10:38.430
Under those circumstances –in Sanskrit we
call it samayachar, the time, that was the

10:38.430 --> 10:44.700
time – and according to the time, these
people found out things, what is to be done

10:44.700 --> 10:46.620
for that particular time.

10:46.620 --> 10:50.720
Now for example, now we have drugs.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.860
They didn’t have drugs at that time.

10:53.860 --> 10:57.709
Even Mohammed Sahab time, there was no smoking.

10:57.709 --> 11:04.310
He, of course, He knew about the alcohol,
so He said no more alcohol.

11:04.310 --> 11:09.950
But there was no smoking, so Muslims think
that if you smoke, it’s alright because

11:09.950 --> 11:11.080
it’s allowed.

11:11.080 --> 11:15.600
It’s an escape, you know, just an escape.

11:15.600 --> 11:21.760
Now the drugs also, I was surprised in these
Arabic countries they’re taking drugs.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.529
Young people are taking drugs.

11:23.529 --> 11:25.630
Quite a lot.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.290
Even ladies take drugs there.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.269
It’s very surprising.

11:29.269 --> 11:35.850
The reason for that is again, that in the
Koran there’s no word of drugs.

11:35.850 --> 11:39.920
Now Koran itself was not written at the time
of Mohammed Sahab as you know very well.

11:39.920 --> 11:46.690
There’s a very great scholar who has written
about it, that Mohammed Sahab got all these

11:46.690 --> 11:52.269
inspirations, and He told people to write
who were of His age group, his friends and

11:52.269 --> 11:54.240
things, very reliable people.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.870
But they couldn’t write anything.

11:55.870 --> 11:58.490
So they remembered everything by heart.

11:58.490 --> 12:00.380
Forty years, they didn’t write.

12:00.380 --> 12:06.180
Then they were getting old, so they asked
their children to learn how to write, and

12:06.180 --> 12:07.769
they told the children.

12:07.769 --> 12:14.070
So now from Mohammed Sahab to these people,
which was kept in their memory, then it was

12:14.070 --> 12:17.010
even to the children.

12:17.010 --> 12:24.010
So you can imagine there is authenticity of
Koran could be also little bit doubted, because

12:24.010 --> 12:26.579
maybe there are certain things that have gone
wrong.

12:26.579 --> 12:32.839
I tell you, the biggest mistake was this,
that it was said that Mohammed Sahab said

12:32.839 --> 12:34.970
that I am the last prophet.

12:34.970 --> 12:37.070
He never said that.

12:37.070 --> 12:43.200
If He had said it, why should He talk about
Kiyama?

12:43.200 --> 12:44.300
About the future?

12:44.300 --> 12:48.420
If He was the last, He should have done with
the Kiyama part, why did He keep it hanging

12:48.420 --> 12:51.750
in the air?

12:51.750 --> 12:54.110
That shows He never said it.

12:54.110 --> 13:01.410
But apart from that, their word is that He
was the seal.

13:01.410 --> 13:04.040
It means also stamp.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.100
Even in Arabic language it means stamp.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.050
So He is one of the stamps.

13:10.050 --> 13:17.590
Like in the Indian scriptures, we have the
Primordial Master.

13:17.590 --> 13:27.430
Then we have this Master incarnates, like
in Iran, you had Zoroaster.

13:27.430 --> 13:31.540
According to Sahaja Yog, Zoroaster was the
same.

13:31.540 --> 13:39.399
Five Zoroasters came there to preach about
God and religion.

13:39.399 --> 13:45.070
These were the people who are now in India,
who ran away from there, we call them Iranians,

13:45.070 --> 13:46.070
you see.

13:46.070 --> 13:47.070
They ran away.

13:47.070 --> 13:57.420
This is Persepolis, you know that where Shiraz,
near Shiraz, where the capital was there,

13:57.420 --> 14:00.000
at that time.

14:00.000 --> 14:10.920
Now all that was over and then they didn’t
want to say that Mohammed Sahab was one of

14:10.920 --> 14:14.540
the incarnations of the Primordial Master.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.920
They wouldn’t say that.

14:15.920 --> 14:21.880
What they said, that He was the last.

14:21.880 --> 14:27.800
Now logically we must understand, if He was
the last, then why did He talk about resurrection?

14:27.800 --> 14:34.149
About the future?

14:34.149 --> 14:38.730
Also He showed tremendous respect for Christ
and His Mother.

14:38.730 --> 14:41.649
Even in the Bible there is no respect at all.

14:41.649 --> 14:42.960
She is called as a ’woman’ in the Bible.

14:42.960 --> 14:47.720
But He said that nobody dare say anything
against Her character.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.100
Because He knew what She was.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.639
Many things could not be explained that time.

14:55.639 --> 14:59.802
Also all the time the war was going on, you
know that, and there were tribes who were

14:59.802 --> 15:04.959
attacking them; He had to go from here to
there and they were all destroyed.

15:04.959 --> 15:09.009
Quite a lot of people were destroyed there.

15:09.009 --> 15:17.750
So many people were destroyed in these wars
and in these big invasions of the other people.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.730
Even Mohammed Sahab was given poison.

15:20.730 --> 15:23.470
All the time people were after His life.

15:23.470 --> 15:26.430
And in that whatever was possible, He has
explained it, whatever was possible in that

15:26.430 --> 15:27.430
short time.

15:27.430 --> 15:28.660
Beautiful things.

15:28.660 --> 15:34.140
I mean Islam is one of the highest things
you can think of.

15:34.140 --> 15:38.220
But, Muslims are nowhere near Islam.

15:38.220 --> 15:40.829
Muslims are here, Islam is there.

15:40.829 --> 15:43.130
Like in any religion.

15:43.130 --> 15:46.850
I will tell you about Christianity.

15:46.850 --> 15:51.769
Christianity, when Christ died, this fellow
Mr.

15:51.769 --> 16:05.199
Paul, who was a Roman executive, or bureaucrat,
working with the government.

16:05.199 --> 16:14.980
So, he thought that all the blame of the death
of Christ will fall upon the Roman government.

16:14.980 --> 16:19.990
So first thing He said, that Christ was killed
by Jews, so condemn them.

16:19.990 --> 16:26.940
Poor things, for years together, these Jews
were condemned, and every action has a reaction:

16:26.940 --> 16:33.320
because they were condemned, so now they have
become aggressive.

16:33.320 --> 16:38.720
Then this Paul thought that this is a very
good platform, he can jump on it.

16:38.720 --> 16:47.310
And he found this fellow whose name was Peter,
who was the weakest disciple of Christ.

16:47.310 --> 16:54.680
Christ had said that the Satan will take you
over.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.680
Had said it.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.149
In the Bible it is.

16:57.149 --> 17:03.490
So he got hold of this fellow, Peter, and
both have joined hands, and they re-edited

17:03.490 --> 17:04.490
Bible.

17:04.490 --> 17:09.661
Despite that there are lots of truths there
left, but they re-edited, and in that, He

17:09.661 --> 17:19.430
said that Christ said that Peter will establish
a church, and I give him the key.

17:19.430 --> 17:20.430
It’s impossible.

17:20.430 --> 17:23.290
See now, we have so many Sahaja Yogis.

17:23.290 --> 17:29.740
Among them, the one who is the weakest, good
for nothing, for whom I say that Satan will

17:29.740 --> 17:34.460
take over, do you think he will be appointed
as the head?

17:34.460 --> 17:35.460
Not possible!

17:35.460 --> 17:40.860
That’s how this horrible Roman Catholic
church started.

17:40.860 --> 17:50.080
Now the less said the better about Roman Catholic.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.320
They are, firstly, very money-oriented people.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.730
So many things are coming out about them that’s
shocking.

17:58.730 --> 18:04.100
Very licentious, horrible people; they have
been abusing children, their priests have

18:04.100 --> 18:14.720
been doing all kinds of things, and their
church itself has counterfeited ten million

18:14.720 --> 18:16.290
dollars.

18:16.290 --> 18:17.850
Counterfeited.

18:17.850 --> 18:20.290
And distributed this through their bank.

18:20.290 --> 18:25.350
Why should any divine person think of having
a bank?

18:25.350 --> 18:28.160
They have a bank of their own.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.160
Can you imagine?

18:29.160 --> 18:33.050
And in the bank they use the counterfeited
money.

18:33.050 --> 18:36.180
And that counterfeited money is distributed.

18:36.180 --> 18:45.180
I have now, recently, living in Italy, so
many things are coming out about this church.

18:45.180 --> 18:51.680
Now the latest is that this Pope has taken
five hundred thousand pounds as a kickback

18:51.680 --> 18:53.600
from one man.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.430
This man was arrested.

18:55.430 --> 18:59.790
And he said that, “This man has taken a
kickback from me, but I have been giving him

18:59.790 --> 19:02.270
since long."

19:02.270 --> 19:08.320
And now, it was also said that, I mean it’s
there, that he has a keep.

19:08.320 --> 19:15.950
He had her there in Warsaw, and he has brought
her here.

19:15.950 --> 19:21.910
And this book, there is one book, ‘In The
Name of God’ where this author, English

19:21.910 --> 19:31.190
author, American, he’s American, he has
pointed out that this Pope murdered the previous

19:31.190 --> 19:33.290
Pope.

19:33.290 --> 19:38.480
He has been a politician, he has sent lots
of, of course it was in time also, lots of

19:38.480 --> 19:46.140
bombs and things to Warsaw, to Poland, and
many people were killed.

19:46.140 --> 19:56.520
I mean a divine person, why should any divine
person do all these things?

19:56.520 --> 20:00.960
This shows that all these, even Hindus are
terrible people if you want to hear about

20:00.960 --> 20:04.180
them also, it’s terrible.

20:04.180 --> 20:10.250
I don’t know how they are Hindus, because
it’s written in the Gita, that in everybody’s

20:10.250 --> 20:13.260
heart, there is the Spirit.

20:13.260 --> 20:15.870
So how can you have caste system?

20:15.870 --> 20:23.600
And his own book, that is Gita, was written
by an illegitimate child of a sherwoman.

20:23.600 --> 20:28.380
So this caste system was created later on
by these so-called Brahmins who never knew

20:28.380 --> 20:30.070
what is Brahma is.

20:30.070 --> 20:36.080
Then Buddhists, another nonsense they are,
terrible.

20:36.080 --> 20:40.170
Recently this Dalai Lama, he’s a beggar,
he’s begging everywhere money, you see,

20:40.170 --> 20:48.000
he has got so many wrinkles that you can count
them.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.591
He said, surprisingly, that we cannot have
one universal religion because we are all

20:54.591 --> 20:55.591
different people.

20:55.591 --> 21:00.470
Because they want to fight.

21:00.470 --> 21:03.940
Because if you are one religion, then who
will fight?

21:03.940 --> 21:07.250
They want to fight and kill others.

21:07.250 --> 21:12.830
So this great power of killing others will
be lost once you become one religion.

21:12.830 --> 21:15.440
So he says, we don’t believe in universal
religion.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.480
We are all different people.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.980
How are we different?

21:19.980 --> 21:29.559
See, if you cut your hand, the same bone,
the same nerves, the same arteries, veins,

21:29.559 --> 21:34.000
everything in everyone, whether you are Irani,
India, English, America.

21:34.000 --> 21:43.850
There is no difference at all, it is skin
deep, absolutely skin deep.

21:43.850 --> 21:46.220
What is the difference?

21:46.220 --> 21:50.550
We laugh the same way, we cry the same way.

21:50.550 --> 21:53.990
We don’t cry from our ears.

21:53.990 --> 21:56.600
We cry from our eyes only.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.350
All of us.

22:00.350 --> 22:02.150
What is the difference is?

22:02.150 --> 22:06.000
All our hair, you see, grow out of our head.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.460
They don’t grow through our nose or something
like that.

22:10.460 --> 22:14.700
It’s a funny thing, you know, that “we
are different."

22:14.700 --> 22:16.160
We are not.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.390
I mean it’s surprising.

22:17.390 --> 22:24.180
How can they say such a thing about God that
He created us different?

22:24.180 --> 22:26.660
Of course, there’s a skin difference.

22:26.660 --> 22:32.040
It is, after all, supposing you wear all just
the same.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.530
It would have been so boring.

22:34.530 --> 22:41.050
Everybody looks the same like a laboratory,
you see, there’s no expression of anything,

22:41.050 --> 22:50.350
the same nose, the same eyes, and you wouldn’t
be able to make out who is who.

22:50.350 --> 22:57.300
So the variety was created, the variety was
created, just to create beauty.

22:57.300 --> 23:01.010
Is important that there should be variety.

23:01.010 --> 23:05.370
Whatever God has done for our good, we always
make a mess out of it.

23:05.370 --> 23:07.860
That’s specialty of human beings.

23:07.860 --> 23:12.910
Whatever good things He creates or does that,
we can easily make a mess out of it.

23:12.910 --> 23:16.980
So it’s important we all should get our
realization first.

23:16.980 --> 23:20.230
We all have to become the ‘wali.’

23:20.230 --> 23:23.180
Wali you have to be.

23:23.180 --> 23:28.060
And once that happens, then you will be surprised,
you will know Mohammed Sahab much better,

23:28.060 --> 23:36.600
you know Islam much better, and you know all
the religions, that are contained together.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.010
So many things happen now.

23:38.010 --> 23:42.240
Tomorrow’s lecture I am going to tell you
all about it, what great things are going

23:42.240 --> 23:50.800
to come once we all become one with this Ruh,
with all this All-pervading.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.910
They have talked about Ruh.

23:53.910 --> 24:00.980
But Islam is only nothing but Ruh, while the
Muslims [are] least bothered.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.750
Where is the Ruh?

24:02.750 --> 24:03.830
They never find out.

24:03.830 --> 24:07.490
Only thing they know is to kill somebody,
or to … this thing.

24:07.490 --> 24:13.380
Really, it is impossible to understand this
fighting business – is so much.

24:13.380 --> 24:16.930
Go on fighting.

24:16.930 --> 24:24.370
They are, actually I should say, little naive,
so their fundamentalism is open.

24:24.370 --> 24:26.080
Christians are no less fundamentalists.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.010
Tremendous fundamentalists they are.

24:29.010 --> 24:36.470
In England, there’s only one religion, is
this Church of England.

24:36.470 --> 24:42.500
Other religions are not religions at all,
only Church of England.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.670
Great fundamentalists.

24:45.670 --> 24:46.840
Apart from Catholic Church.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.300
Now, how far they are going, they are very
liberal.

24:50.300 --> 24:55.100
First they said, some of them said, that Christ
was a homosexual.

24:55.100 --> 24:59.630
Can you imagine such a thing to be said?

24:59.630 --> 25:00.630
Alright.

25:00.630 --> 25:05.590
So now they are having homosexual marriages.

25:05.590 --> 25:11.540
In the Church.

25:11.540 --> 25:16.380
This is the situation of all the religions
today.

25:16.380 --> 25:23.080
All kinds of stupid things they are doing
in the name of God.

25:23.080 --> 25:30.430
How can in the church you marry such things,
and then you can adopt a child and do like

25:30.430 --> 25:31.430
that?

25:31.430 --> 25:34.550
Because, reason is, they want money.

25:34.550 --> 25:43.470
So, now, if you want to have money, you have
to, it’s like an election, you, like the

25:43.470 --> 25:44.470
votes.

25:44.470 --> 25:48.561
So far, these votes, you have to accept whatever
they say.

25:48.561 --> 25:55.290
There are no fundamental principles, there
is no fundamental value system.

25:55.290 --> 26:01.430
Whatever people say, “Alright, we’ll do
that."

26:01.430 --> 26:05.280
This is how the religion has been to this
time.

26:05.280 --> 26:09.540
And I don’t know how many more stupid things
they are going to do, and how many people

26:09.540 --> 26:11.410
they are going to kill in the name of God.

26:11.410 --> 26:14.600
All of them think that God is in their pocket.

26:14.600 --> 26:19.390
Whether you are Christian, Hindu, Muslim,
anything.

26:19.390 --> 26:21.770
One can commit any sin.

26:21.770 --> 26:24.310
There’s no restriction.

26:24.310 --> 26:28.550
But a Sahaja Yogi cannot.

26:28.550 --> 26:33.180
Sahaja Yogi has to practice what he preaches.

26:33.180 --> 26:39.510
If he doesn’t do it, he gets out of Sahaja
Yoga.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.070
But he does it.

26:41.070 --> 26:45.710
I don’t have to say, “These are Ten Commandments,”
nothing.

26:45.710 --> 26:52.640
You get the light of your spirit, and you
yourself look after yourself, I don’t have

26:52.640 --> 26:53.640
to bother.

26:53.640 --> 26:57.120
You become your own masters, your prophets,
and you look after yourself.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.510
I don’t have to bother about it.

26:59.510 --> 27:04.900
It is as simple as that.

27:04.900 --> 27:11.950
And nowhere, in all these religions, there
is even an essence of love that is God.

27:11.950 --> 27:16.180
Whether it is this or that.

27:16.180 --> 27:22.150
They are all full of greed and lust.

27:22.150 --> 27:23.150
Absolutely.

27:23.150 --> 27:29.580
Sometimes I feel at the helm of a airs, we
have people who are much worse than us.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.720
Much worse than even ordinary people.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.300
They do all kinds of nonsensical things.

27:34.300 --> 27:38.160
In Riyadh, you have todo five times namaz.

27:38.160 --> 27:49.140
These mutawahs, they are standing with hunters,
you see, they close all the shops, five times.

27:49.140 --> 27:59.290
Now, if any lady is there or somebody, if
she doesn’t cover her head fully, they’ll

27:59.290 --> 28:03.410
come and hit you.

28:03.410 --> 28:07.720
They may not be Muslims, but you are supposed
to cover your head.

28:07.720 --> 28:13.320
Such injustice, and no freedom of any kind.

28:13.320 --> 28:18.520
While the prince and princess with their horrible
life they are leading, horrible.

28:18.520 --> 28:26.301
And the other people also, the sheiks, are
… you know what kind of people they are.

28:26.301 --> 28:29.000
They have no right to call themselves Islamic.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.920
No right.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.799
No character, nothing.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.460
Horrible people.

28:35.460 --> 28:42.740
So now, we have to understand now that all
of us should take to something that is reality,

28:42.740 --> 28:47.000
and must awaken ourselves to that reality,
to enjoy life.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.690
Now time has come for you to enjoy.

28:49.690 --> 28:52.200
We have had enough of this nonsense.

28:52.200 --> 29:01.200
Now we can stop it and finish it o .
Doctor must have told you how physical, emotional,

29:01.200 --> 29:05.300
mental problems can be solved so easily with
this.

29:05.300 --> 29:11.190
Also material problems can be solved.

29:11.190 --> 29:19.160
All of you understand the importance of your
own personalities, because you are Iranians

29:19.160 --> 29:20.630
here.

29:20.630 --> 29:28.450
If you want to save your people, you have
to work it out yourself.

29:28.450 --> 29:32.540
We have already some Iranians who are Sahaja
Yogis.

29:32.540 --> 29:34.660
I don’t know if you have met them.

29:34.660 --> 29:43.710
There are some Sahaja Yogis already – Iranians
– they come to Turkey and go back.

29:43.710 --> 29:51.500
We are going to have a Diwali Pūjā in Turkey,
where all these Eastern Block and Russians

29:51.500 --> 29:55.850
are going to come, and all these Muslims might
come also.

29:55.850 --> 30:04.230
They have given us a very nice place also,
might have that there.

30:04.230 --> 30:09.290
Will be a good idea to meet all of the people
who are enlightened.

30:09.290 --> 30:15.700
One good thing about Russians and these Communist
countries is that their government may be

30:15.700 --> 30:17.850
bad, but you see, they are very open-hearted.

30:17.850 --> 30:25.570
I mean they are so sensitive to spirituality.

30:25.570 --> 30:32.540
In one place called Togliatti, there are 22,000
Sahaja Yogis practicing.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.920
Just like that.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.000
Spreading so fast.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.140
They are so open-minded.

30:39.140 --> 30:45.860
They are so susceptible, they are so sensitive.

30:45.860 --> 30:51.210
Just seeing My photograph, can you imagine,
thousands of them came.

30:51.210 --> 30:52.210
I said how?

30:52.210 --> 30:57.140
They said it is, you can see Mother.

30:57.140 --> 31:01.410
And all these people, Rajneesh, they just
threw them out.

31:01.410 --> 31:02.870
Except for these Azerbaijanis.

31:02.870 --> 31:06.630
Poor things, they smuggle Koran there.

31:06.630 --> 31:10.110
And this is, Americans are doing this trick.

31:10.110 --> 31:14.740
You see, Americans are very clever, they want
to create problems.

31:14.740 --> 31:20.450
So they gave them these Korans, and they were
smuggling.

31:20.450 --> 31:24.940
Saddam Hussein they are trying to reclaim
somehow or other.

31:24.940 --> 31:30.340
They could have arrested him long time back.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.620
But he’s still there.

31:31.620 --> 31:35.140
What are they up to, these Americans?

31:35.140 --> 31:40.920
They themselves gave him so many ships and
things, and later on they are bombarding their

31:40.920 --> 31:41.920
own ships.

31:41.920 --> 31:51.590
The Germans built his bunk, and they said
this bunk, you cannot destroy because we have

31:51.590 --> 32:00.770
built it, we know what it is.

32:00.770 --> 32:04.030
So all the European countries have this Mr.

32:04.030 --> 32:06.350
Saddam Hussein, and now he is on their back.

32:06.350 --> 32:14.450
So, it’s a big game of politics – nonsense
that’s going on.

32:14.450 --> 32:21.370
All these things will soon be disappearing
because people know now.

32:21.370 --> 32:23.680
Everybody’s getting exposed.

32:23.680 --> 32:29.370
And I’m sure some sensible people will stand
up and say that stop all this nonsense now,

32:29.370 --> 32:32.120
let’s stick to reality.

32:32.120 --> 32:38.420
If you have any questions, I would like to
answer you also.

32:38.420 --> 32:42.480
Man spoke.

32:42.480 --> 32:58.590
Was worried that
the situation in Iran is affecting the people’s

32:58.590 --> 32:59.590
spirituality.

32:59.590 --> 33:04.730
They no longer believe in Koran.

33:04.730 --> 34:00.680
A woman he knows whose children and grandchildren
were killed has stopped praying altogether.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.600
Actually you must get your connection.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.930
You should get connected to God Almighty.

34:05.930 --> 34:09.419
Then there’s no need even to pray, just
you desire, it works out.

34:09.419 --> 34:18.330
I want you Iranians to really get in connection
with God Almighty, and all your desires will

34:18.330 --> 34:19.330
be fulfilled.

34:19.330 --> 34:21.200
But first the connection must be there.

34:21.200 --> 34:33.170
Without the connection, if you are praying,
what’s the use?

34:33.170 --> 34:37.940
Many people in Iran also think the same way
as you are saying, very much.

34:37.940 --> 34:59.950
But they are little helpless because they
are not free, you see.

34:59.950 --> 35:14.240
I have this great feeling for Iran.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.210
Fatima was there.

35:16.210 --> 35:20.760
Her two children were killed there.

35:20.760 --> 35:25.960
That’s a very sad story.

35:25.960 --> 35:35.880
And now, despite all oil and everything, I
have heard that people are getting very poor

35:35.880 --> 35:42.390
there, and even small children of 12 years
or so are carrying guns in their hands.

35:42.390 --> 35:46.210
It’s a mad world.

35:46.210 --> 35:51.640
We have a company of shipping, Indo–Iran.

35:51.640 --> 35:56.200
And the officers who go there and come tell
us the story about it.

35:56.200 --> 36:02.910
Already there is one doctor who has married
an Indian girl who is a Sahaja Yogi.

36:02.910 --> 36:05.400
But they are all afraid to talk about Sahaja
Yoga.

36:05.400 --> 36:10.100
Because, you see, it’s a military rule there.

36:10.100 --> 36:13.840
You cannot say anything.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.970
But there are.

36:15.970 --> 36:21.150
But outside Iran, you can work it out.

36:21.150 --> 36:29.570
It’s a very silent revolution that’s going
on in the whole world.

36:29.570 --> 36:34.170
Now in Sahaja Yoga there are fifty-five countries.

36:34.170 --> 36:39.119
Fifty-five countries.

36:39.119 --> 36:43.100
And they all love each other.

36:43.100 --> 36:50.050
Never a problem of any quarreling, fighting,
nothing.

36:50.050 --> 36:55.370
Tremendous love.

36:55.370 --> 37:03.360
So all this racialism, all these artificial
barriers which separates human beings, is

37:03.360 --> 37:09.380
absolutely finished, and you will be amazed
that you have friends everywhere.

37:09.380 --> 37:17.190
We have one Iranian girl who came from Iran
to Rome.

37:17.190 --> 37:19.460
She went to the ashram.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.460
Immediately they said, “Yes, yes, come along."

37:22.460 --> 37:25.370
She’s staying there.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.530
And then she met Me.

37:27.530 --> 37:32.090
Because she had her realization in, I think,
in Turkey.

37:32.090 --> 37:37.170
Then she went back, then she came, and she
came to this ashram.

37:37.170 --> 37:41.150
She is very nicely settled there.

37:41.150 --> 37:49.660
So, all over the world, people are there,
your brothers and sisters will be very happy

37:49.660 --> 38:00.870
to help you in every way that is possible.

38:00.870 --> 38:23.960
It is not for any money, for any favor, anything,
but it is for love.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.980
Any other question?

38:25.980 --> 38:31.980
They have all got realization!

38:31.980 --> 38:38.640
Your namaz is nothing but realization, that’s
what it is.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.350
Islam means surrender.

38:42.350 --> 38:45.270
Islam itself means surrender.

38:45.270 --> 38:53.500
And the whole namaz is nothing but awakening
of the Kundalini.

38:53.500 --> 38:58.580
But they don’t understand.

38:58.580 --> 39:03.560
Like a physical exercise they do namaz.

39:03.560 --> 39:07.070
Nothing goes in the heart.

39:07.070 --> 39:11.820
The religion is not inside.

39:11.820 --> 39:17.720
It’s all outside.

39:17.720 --> 39:21.230
Without love, what is religion?

39:21.230 --> 39:22.600
Because God is love.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.950
He is truth.

39:24.950 --> 39:50.430
But truth

39:50.430 --> 39:52.450
is love.

39:52.450 --> 40:00.290
Everywhere we are getting one or two Iranians
coming to the program.

40:00.290 --> 40:01.350
Everywhere.

40:01.350 --> 40:04.170
But in Turkey we had many.

40:04.170 --> 40:09.600
They come to Turkey – they’re allowed
– I think, to come for holidays or something.

40:09.600 --> 40:12.500
So we had many there and now they have gone
back.

40:12.500 --> 40:27.370
And secretly they are spreading Sahaja Yoga
there, giving realizations to people.

40:27.370 --> 40:32.810
Also in ancient times, the son of Rama went
through Iran.

40:32.810 --> 40:34.790
His name was Luv.

40:34.790 --> 40:37.420
He went to Caucasus.

40:37.420 --> 40:40.860
That’s why the Russians are called as Slavs.

40:40.860 --> 40:45.440
You see, his name was Luv – slav – with
love.

40:45.440 --> 40:53.750
Now this is said in our Puranas, that when
He went there, there was a temple of a Goddess

40:53.750 --> 41:02.100
called Hindulika, on the way, in Iran itself,
there was this temple but I don’t know the

41:02.100 --> 41:10.190
exact spot where it is, and they used to worship
the goddess in those days.

41:10.190 --> 41:19.410
But then the whole thing was very different.

41:19.410 --> 41:43.210
They used to worship women, mothers, very
much in those days.

41:43.210 --> 41:47.410
Question: Is there a center in Israel?

41:47.410 --> 41:52.080
Shri Mataji: We have a center in Israel.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.930
There is a center in Israel.

41:54.930 --> 41:58.870
There are 20 people who are Sahaja Yogis.

41:58.870 --> 42:06.630
What happened, from Russia, those Jews who
went there, they started a center.

42:06.630 --> 42:18.060
Lady: [worried about the problems in that
region affecting people, in the same way as

42:18.060 --> 42:19.580
in Iran.]

42:19.580 --> 42:26.760
Shri Mataji: They have gone o their heads,
I think.

42:26.760 --> 42:34.100
They have suffered so much, and that reaction
is there.

42:34.100 --> 42:37.170
And so many bad things they are doing, you
see.

42:37.170 --> 42:44.430
So what happens, always anger always begets
anger.

42:44.430 --> 42:50.420
They got it from Hitler, so now they are giving
it back.

42:50.420 --> 42:52.530
Horrible things are happening there.

42:52.530 --> 42:58.520
But gradually I’m sure the election was
good they said, the Premier is a good person.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.710
But it’s wrong.

43:00.710 --> 43:11.460
It’s wrong to behave like that.

43:11.460 --> 43:16.910
They also suffered a lot.

43:16.910 --> 43:19.660
All the sufferings are now coming out.

43:19.660 --> 43:27.360
It’s all human creation, this kind of hatred.

43:27.360 --> 43:32.640
First of all, that they killed Christ, so
they were treated as something very low.

43:32.640 --> 43:37.619
Also they were regarded as a low race.

43:37.619 --> 43:41.170
They suffered a lot.

43:41.170 --> 43:45.480
This Freud, he was a Jew.

43:45.480 --> 43:52.811
And what he did, that he thought that in Christian
religion, there is this original sin, so he

43:52.811 --> 43:55.230
started his own theory.

43:55.230 --> 43:59.700
So many jumped on him and they started worshipping
him.

43:59.700 --> 44:04.360
Of all kinds of things, it is very difficult.

44:04.360 --> 44:10.680
But do you know that the Jews ultimately lost
everything.

44:10.680 --> 44:14.730
They came to India and settled in Kashmir.

44:14.730 --> 44:17.520
And they are even now called as Kashman Jew.

44:17.520 --> 44:25.120
Their surnames are ‘Jew.’

44:25.120 --> 44:30.190
And also Moses died in India.

44:30.190 --> 44:59.950
He died in India.

44:59.950 --> 45:57.350
So I’ll take your leave now.

45:57.350 --> 46:00.050
May God bless you.

46:00.050 --> 46:01.380
Very nice to have met you.

46:01.380 --> 46:04.310
Now I can see great hope for Iran.

46:04.310 --> 46:05.539
Very great hope.
