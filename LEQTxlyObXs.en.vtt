00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.090
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:27.300
to this great country of yoga.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:37.280
Today first of all we have to establish

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.120
our desire within ourselves

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.130
that we are seekers

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.809
and that we have to achieve our full growth
and maturity.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.110
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:05.740
The whole universe

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.930
should be enlightened with your desires.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.929
Your desires should be so intense

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:19.119
that they should emit out

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.700
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.470
which is the pure desire

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.759
of attaining the spirit.

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.250
That's the real desire.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:47.860
All the other desires are like mirage.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.929
You are the people who are chosen by God.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:06.860
Specially, first to express your desire,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.539
and then to achieve it.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:22.370
And by intense 
desire of purity

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.200
you have to purify the whole world.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.959
Not only the seekers,

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:37.930
but even those who are not seekers.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:46.220
You have to create an aura around this universe,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.260
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:03.670
the spirit.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.700
Without desire this universe would not have
been created.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.170
This Desire of God is the one that is the
Holy Ghost,

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.189
is this all-pervading power,

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.670
is the Kundalini within you.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.500
Kundalini has only one desire,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.209
is to be the spirit

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:46.540
and anything else if you desire the Kundalini
doesn't rise.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.810
Only when it knows

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:00.599
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:08.989
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.849
it is awakened.

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:21.690
If you do not have the desire,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.470
no-one can force you.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.210
Sahaja Yogis should never try

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.990
to force this desire on other people.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.289
The first ordeal we face,

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.860
as soon as you get your Realization,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.380
is that you just start thinking of your family.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.120
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got
it,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.430
my father has not got it,

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.200
my wife has not got it,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.729
my children have not got it.'

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.770
You must know that these relations are worldly.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.091
Sanskrit is loukik.

00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:10.620
They are not aloukik,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.430
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.020
These are worldly relations,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.700
and these attachments are worldly.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.790
So if you play into that of course as you
know,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.930
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with
that.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.530
You go ahead, as long as you like.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.349
People bring Me all their relations,

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.050
parents, this and that --

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.319
and ultimately they discover

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:49.990
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.069
They lost so many precious moments,

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.280
so many hours, so many years,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.560
wasting their energy on people

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.200
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:12.550
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.629
may be within you,

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:23.159
and may not be in anyone of your so-called
worldly relations.

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:28.560
Makes no difference.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.580
As Christ was told

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.860
that His brothers and sisters are waiting
outside,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:42.900
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are
My sisters?'

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.849
So one has to realize that those people who
involve themselves

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:50.639
into the problems of their family all the
time,

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.610
and attract My attention,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.569
you must know that I am just playing about.

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.889
It is of no value to you.

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:05.139
For your ascent it is important first of all

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.400
to have no desires

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.439
to create desire in your kith and kin.

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:24.930
This is the first principle of establishment
of Mahakali Power.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.189
Specially in India

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:31.310
where people are too much attached to their
family,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.300
it's a very big problem.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.530
If you give Realization to one person,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:43.150
you are amazed to see that all relationship
they have

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.789
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:52.690
And once you give Realization to one person
you are in for trouble.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.169
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:00.889
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:05.190
and absolutely disgusting.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.060
It should happen to you to understand

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.150
that this is not auspicious.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.599
If you want to waste your time,

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:18.130
I will allow you to waste your time.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:24.319
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:26.340
first of all one must remember

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.629
that these are relations which are absolutely
worldly relations

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:35.760
and this is not your pure desire.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.090
So try to separate your pure desire

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.310
from your worldly desires.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:48.640
It does not by any means,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.900
suggest that you give up your family,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.480
you give up your mother or give up your sister
- nothing.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.850
But you witness them

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.920
and see, as you would see anybody else,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.830
and see for yourself,

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:15.410
whether they are really desirous or not.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.710
If they are - well and good.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.950
They should not be disqualified because they
are your relations.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.940
It works both ways.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.450
As they cannot be qualified because they are
your relations,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.580
they cannot be disqualified because they're
your relations.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:41.820
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure
desire,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.480
you have to get out of so many things.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.010
But for people who are attached to their family,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.840
are bound by their family,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.100
they have to see to it

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.410
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone
of their relations,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.530
at least don't force them on Me.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:11.940
Now this desire within us,

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:18.660
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.890
comes to us in so many ways.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.330
As I told you first of all,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.040
it comes to us after Realization,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.430
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:35.170
to do something about our relations.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.790
Then the second desire that comes to us,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.780
that let us try to cure people,

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.820
who are our relations.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.460
This is the second desire,

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.900
you should face yourself and see,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.650
that this has happened to many of you.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:11:01.260
So, right from leprosy

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.560
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.840
whatever they have,

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:16.760
you think you should bring to Mother.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.360
And all the worries of your families should
be brought to Mother.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.280
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.830
very simple things - which are so natural
--

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:40.080
are brought into your attention.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.550
So when you have them in your attention I
say:

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.300
'All right, go ahead with it.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.100
Try to solve it, if possible.'

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.990
But if you do not have them in your attention

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:56.950
they are in My attention.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.730
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage
that.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.030
But then it's a vicious circle.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:09.550
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.310
that thinks: 'All right,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.310
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.350
You'd better look after it."

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.370
That's not the way.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.660
You should have only one intense desire within
yourself:

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.700
"Have I become the spirit?

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.660
Have I achieved my ultimate?

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.740
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.830
Purify it.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.190
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.510
I'll look after that.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:58.060
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:06.270
If it deserves My attention I will definitely
look after you.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:16.870
You have to value your attention as I value
My attention.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:22.630
I think you have to value much more of your
attention

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:28.200
than Me, because I can manage,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.140
many more things within Myself,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:36.790
because everything is in My attention.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.970
But you try to purify your desires,

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:46.850
away from the worldly problems that are facing
you.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.150
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.950
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

00:13:53.950 --> 00:14:04.850
All right, give Me the map of your country
- finished.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:12.350
That's more than sufficient.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.530
Then purify yourself.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:21.810
The desire that you have, you leave it.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.540
And once you are purified

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.430
that area will be covered through your attention,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.550
it's very interesting.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:37.980
When you get over it then only you can throw
light,

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.430
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.970
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.990
You all rise above that desire.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.010
Every time you get a desire you rise above
it,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:55.300
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.380
that you are facing

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.990
which you think should be solved by Me.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:08.370
These are all My headaches which you are taking
on yourself.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.290
You have to do only one thing is to become
the spirit

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.290
that's all.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.290
Is a simple thing.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:18.030
The rest of it is My headache.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:27.290
Now the problems

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:34.600
that should take your desire on the collective

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:43.100
should be very different.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:48.170
To substantiate your purity,

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.310
to be fragrant with your purity,

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.380
your attention should be on the other side.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.550
Now you are not facing Me,

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.820
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.660
See, the whole attitude will change.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.610
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:15.090
How can I give?

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.280
What is my mistake in giving?

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.760
I have to be more alert.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.760
Where is my attention?

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.561
I have to be more alert towards myself

00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:32.720
what am I doing?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:39.340
What's my responsibility?'

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:45.190
You must desire that you should be pure.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.500
You should be pure desire.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.410
That means you should be the spirit.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:57.370
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:04.039
You should desire that your responsibility
to yourself

00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:07.560
should be manifested,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.680
should be complete.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:18.029
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:21.089
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.669
which is the work of God,

00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:32.649
which has started and you are My hands.

00:17:32.649 --> 00:17:35.720
You have to do the work of God,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:41.309
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

00:17:41.309 --> 00:17:42.700
the satanic elements.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.330
You are not responsible for your family any
more,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.140
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.559
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:56.970
All such will drop out, their families will
suffer,

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.590
I know this is going to happen.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.840
Because now the forces are gathering in such
a way

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.600
that sorting out will start.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.299
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the
spirit,

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:18.460
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.470
your responsibility to understand Me,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:26.150
better and better and better.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.049
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

00:18:30.049 --> 00:18:32.549
that is within you,

00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:37.790
your responsibility to understand how this
mechanism

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:38.790
works out everything.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:49.110
The responsibility is to how to become a guru
yourself.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:53.779
Your responsibility to be a dignified and
a glorified personality.

00:18:53.779 --> 00:18:57.240
A responsibility to be a respectable person

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.960
and not a cheap personality.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.309
Every one of you

00:19:05.309 --> 00:19:14.179
is worth the whole universe.

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:20.879
If you want to rise to that height.

00:19:20.879 --> 00:19:27.190
Universes of universes can be thrown away
at your feet.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.590
If you want to rise to that height,

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:35.700
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.250
But those people,

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:49.789
who still want to live on a very low level
cannot rise.

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:54.710
For example,

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.900
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:08.190
of committing the sin against the Mother,

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.870
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:15.340
of committing sin against the Father.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:22.830
It's not difficult at all

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:36.720
for you to get out of it.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.269
The attention is to be kept pure.

00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:49.169
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

00:20:49.169 --> 00:20:53.249
how the attention one can keep it pure.

00:20:53.249 --> 00:20:56.509
If the attention is not pure

00:20:56.509 --> 00:20:59.860
then this desire

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.720
will be always attacked

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.679
by all petty nonsensical things

00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:11.940
which has no meaning in your ascent.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.539
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:17.399
is not bothered about clothes, what others
say to him

00:21:17.399 --> 00:21:19.590
or what others are talking to him,

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.101
how they are behaving towards him and

00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:25.559
the attention is not on that,

00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:31.140
criticism that this person is like this, that
person is like that.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.570
Nor there is the aggressiveness

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:42.779
of anyone else,

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:46.030
because nobody is the other.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:51.059
But the problem is when I say that,

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:57.040
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each
persons.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.490
Those who are aggressive take the other role

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:08.409
and those who are non-aggressive think the
other way.

00:22:08.409 --> 00:22:11.660
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.759
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the
person who is aggressive,

00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:17.669
not about himself.

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:22.490
You immediately start shifting your mind to
other person,

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:29.460
finding faults with other people.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.759
So this desire becomes

00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:39.240
gradually lower and lower and lower

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.440
because of the loads that are put onto it.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.179
So the alertness is very important,

00:22:47.179 --> 00:22:49.539
complete alertness - satarkata,

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:55.830
that we should keep our attention

00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:08.790
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.249
Desire comes from your heart

00:23:12.249 --> 00:23:13.950
and you are so built

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.720
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.769
If you don't have a clean heart,

00:23:21.769 --> 00:23:25.019
this won't keep clean.

00:23:25.019 --> 00:23:29.120
There are people

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.929
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

00:23:31.929 --> 00:23:35.530
and all that, they are all right.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.179
They are cheating themselves.

00:23:38.179 --> 00:23:42.159
If the heart is not open

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:46.150
then this is closed.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:53.549
So try to open your heart by projecting.

00:23:53.549 --> 00:24:01.549
Projecting it.

00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:06.019
I hope today when you do this puja

00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:10.100
and you do the worship of Mahakali

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.440
and this special yagya,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:20.000
we will definitely establish this aura,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.769
and enlighten the universe.

00:24:24.769 --> 00:24:26.509
But your outlook should be:

00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:31.389
'How much I have contributed to this.

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:35.320
Am I still thinking of other people,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.110
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:46.730
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:54.879
So, the left side

00:24:54.879 --> 00:25:00.559
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:08.429
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

00:25:08.429 --> 00:25:11.240
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.929
He does not know any other God,

00:25:14.929 --> 00:25:17.020
He does not even know His Father.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.409
He only knows His Mother

00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:29.679
and completely surrendered to Her.

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:38.409
But this pure desire has to have the action,

00:25:38.409 --> 00:25:40.519
and about which I'll tell you later

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:45.049
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:52.269
But today let us establish ourselves

00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:59.190
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:09.900
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll
say: 'How?'

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.090
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:18.429
Should I tell you?

00:26:18.429 --> 00:26:20.940
It's very simple.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.110
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.990
and so many other books of treaties,

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:37.850
and then all these big intellectuals got after
his life.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.850
And they said:

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:43.029
'How this and how that and how?'

00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:46.019
He said: 'Forget these people.'

00:26:46.019 --> 00:26:49.340
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.889
it's just a description of his Mother

00:26:52.889 --> 00:26:55.529
and his devotion to Her

00:26:55.529 --> 00:27:05.529
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:07.179
It is not the surrender

00:27:07.179 --> 00:27:12.920
of your mind through your mind,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:18.889
but the surrender of your heart.

00:27:18.889 --> 00:27:26.580
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.779
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:33.549
how there have been attacks

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:38.250
and attacks of negativity on them,

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.650
specially when horrible people like Freud

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:52.419
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:57.919
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

00:27:57.919 --> 00:28:03.110
and put them on the path of hell.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:06.740
All that has to be brought out.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.130
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:16.350
against God, it's anti-God activity.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.350
Then you will realize

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:28.129
that you will fight fully, by saying,

00:28:28.129 --> 00:28:33.769
"This is the destruction of our basics, our
roots,

00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:36.190
when our Mother is the source

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:41.789
of everything that is sublime, noble,

00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:43.590
all that is nourishing,

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:50.240
all that is elevating, emancipating.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.980
You have cutting us from our roots.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.129
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like
creatures

00:28:57.129 --> 00:29:02.929
and he wants all of you to go down to that
low level

00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:09.159
of human beings,

00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:18.559
which exist as pathological cases, I don't
know.

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:22.100
So it is important for you to understand all
the attacks

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.950
that came on you,

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.389
and be alert

00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:28.850
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:34.429
Last I would say you have come to this country

00:29:34.429 --> 00:29:38.539
to see the roots and not the shoot.

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:43.009
Change your attitude of western style.

00:29:43.009 --> 00:29:44.330
Telephones are no good.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:47.690
You cannot get any telephones done here.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.509
Postage is horrible.

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:52.820
Railways are worst.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:30:02.940
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:10.149
But, the people are excellent.

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:13.110
They know what is dharma.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.080
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.169
because it being the Kundalini.

00:30:17.169 --> 00:30:20.700
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody
attack?

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:27.409
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:28.409
protecting them.

00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:32.759
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know
this fact.

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:35.070
And so many marutis,

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.940
so who can attack this country?

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.039
There is no negative attack

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:44.769
except that they themselves are rather money-minded
sort.

00:30:44.769 --> 00:30:48.239
That's the only curse they have, if they can
get out of it

00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:53.619
they are great people.

00:30:53.619 --> 00:30:59.860
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy
the comfort

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:07.190
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:12.609
So to change your attitude towards India

00:31:12.609 --> 00:31:17.869
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

00:31:17.869 --> 00:31:20.499
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air
India

00:31:20.499 --> 00:31:21.950
because you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.019
Not at all.

00:31:23.019 --> 00:31:26.649
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:26.649 --> 00:31:28.440
All our railways, all our everything,

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.950
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:35.799
so far.

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:40.720
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.840
for heaven's sake.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.249
But when you arrive here

00:31:47.249 --> 00:31:49.999
you will see that the people are too innocent,

00:31:49.999 --> 00:31:52.980
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk
to them,

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.759
it's beyond them.

00:31:55.759 --> 00:31:58.059
They are a higher type of people in this respect

00:31:58.059 --> 00:31:59.600
now because they are not attacked,

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.019
while you are higher in a way that though
you are attacked

00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:06.340
you've come out of it.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.320
You just turn your faces and you are on the
other way.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.519
That's something great.

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:18.100
So you would also have a confidence

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.379
there are many people who believe the same
way as you believe,

00:32:21.379 --> 00:32:26.989
in this big country where there's such a big
population to support you.

00:32:26.989 --> 00:32:29.720
So you shouldn't feel lost.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:37.899
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

00:32:37.899 --> 00:32:42.309
on Mahakali Day.

00:32:42.309 --> 00:32:46.299
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

00:32:46.299 --> 00:32:48.389
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:56.239
though according to the schedule time it may
not be.

00:32:56.239 --> 00:32:57.850
But according to Me,

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:02.759
let us establish within ourself on a subtler
level

00:33:02.759 --> 00:33:08.299
the desire to be pure,

00:33:08.299 --> 00:33:16.200
and to be cleansed out.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:22.580
All the barriers and unclean things that are
within us,

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:29.029
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:34.859
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

00:33:34.859 --> 00:33:41.289
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

00:33:41.289 --> 00:33:42.289
It's not difficult.

00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:45.609
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

00:33:45.609 --> 00:33:47.239
because what you surrender,

00:33:47.239 --> 00:33:49.070
I don't want an ything from you,

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:54.990
except that you accept My Love.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:59.730
Surrendering just means you open your heart
to accept My Love.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:03.970
Give up this ego.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.889
That's all and it will work out.

00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:10.040
I'm sure it's going to work out.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.710
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.840
and I'll definitely settle down there.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:24.270
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.270
because She is left-sided.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.040
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.820
She weeps.

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:32.870
This is the only manifestation

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.640
of Mahakali is that She desires,

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.940
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:41.940
then She just weeps,

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.490
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness,
isn't it.

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:49.920
And sometimes when She's full of Love

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.679
as I've seen you today all of you coming down
here

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.010
and all these people sitting down here.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.400
When She cannot express Herself fully,

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.290
with full heart,

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:08.690
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:13.820
May God bless you for today's puja,

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.740
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.240
that the subtlest of subtle

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.920
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.180
every way, and the Love,

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.520
which culminates into joy.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.640
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.690
will manifest in today's puja.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.590
May God bless you!
