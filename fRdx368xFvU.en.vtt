00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.560
So the balancing comes through Nabhi

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.640
and Nabhi looks after you and teaches you how to behave.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.240
For example, now your left Nabhi is Gruha Lakshmi.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.320
Gruha Lakshmi is the Deity of the household.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.960
But if you have too much outward type, you're running a madness.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.640
So early in the morning you get up, read the newspapers.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.640
Is against Sahaja Yoga again.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.160
Not to read newspapers in the morning time.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.080
You can read it in the night,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.880
but not in the morning. Because if you read it in the morning,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.720
you'll get upset.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.720
And poor this spleen has to pour in more red blood corpuscles

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.080
and it becomes mad and fails you.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.640
On the contrary, in the morning talk to your wife,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800
talk to your children, look after your Gruha Lakshmi Tattwa.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.160
The wife also has to be a Gruha Lakshmi as I told you.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.000
Then you have your food properly.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.720
Sit down and eat properly.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.800
But no, just after that, upsetting that Nabhi,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.640
you jump into your car,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.640
taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.480
honking at people, getting angry with them,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.720
the wife is calling, “Come along you have your breakfast!”

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.960
Nothing doing. You are on your way on a special work,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.160
you end up with leukemia at least, minimum of minimum,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.320
if not with heart attack.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.960
Leukemia comes from left Nabhi, when your Gruha Lakshmi is ruined.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.960
The Deity of Gruha Lakshmi is Fatimabai,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.240
the daughter of Mohammed Sahib,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.080
while the sister

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.000
of Nanak Sahib is on the left Vishuddhi. You'll see that.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.800
Nanaki.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.960
Now this aspect of life we never think about.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.400
When you get leukemia, then you'll come to Mother, “please cure me.”

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.080
And if you are rich, you will see to it that I cure that person.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.880
If I don't cure you will sit on My head.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.640
You'll be in ten times on My head

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.640
unless and until I cure your leukemia.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.400
But if I tell you, “My son, you take it easy,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.960
life is not for getting wretchedness out of you.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.160
What have you gained out of all this running about?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.160
Nothing. But this horrible left Nabhi

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.400
by which you are suffering, your family people are suffering.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.080
Only person who has gained is the doctor

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.640
or the doctors or the hospitals.”

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.160
They won't listen.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.160
And you know leukemia is such a fast developing disease of cancer

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.080
that one can pass out within one month,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.480
doctors will tell you,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.880
at the most you'll live for one month, that's all.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.560
They'll take all the money to give this certificate, very nicely.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.480
But why have that?

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.880
Be patient with yourself.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.560
Be kind to your Nabhi, look after your Gruha Lakshmi.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.800
All kinds of diseases of the stomach

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.720
come from this imbalance this way or that way.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.080
All these great gurus came on this earth

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.320
to give us balance, to teach us balance and tell us,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.320
“Don't do this and don't do that.” All the Ten Commandments.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.800
But to us these Ten Commandment have no meaning.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.640
Now I’ll touch a point which is very important today

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.960
for you people to understand

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.320
about non-vegetarianism and vegetarianism.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.880
Because this subject I wanted to handle,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.960
because if they are vegetarians they can’t bear to see

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.800
that Mother says it doesn't matter if you are a non-vegetarian,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.800
because it doesn’t go against your awareness. It does not.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.880
But drinking does.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.880
Drinking does go against your awareness.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.720
But not eating meat or not eating meat.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.000
But one has to understand.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.320
Now somebody told Me that in Gita it is written that

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.400
those who eat meat are Tamo Gunis.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.320
I am surprised at Gita itself.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.800
Because Shri Krishna Himself in the very beginning,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.400
has told Arjuna that you should go all out to kill all these people,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.320
even your relations, kill, actually kill human beings.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.480
Your relations and your guru also is to be killed,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.400
because I have already killed.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.800
Nothing is going to be killed by you

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.160
because they are already killed.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.560
And He gives so many explanations that it should not be done,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.080
but He said, “No, I tell you, you have to go and kill.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.480
Surrender yourself to Me and I'll take care of them.”

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.320
So how did He preach this, I just don’t understand, in Gita.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.640
Now this seems to be a new introduction

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.880
that the people who eat (meat) are Tamo Gunis. They are not,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.080
they are never. They are Rajo Gunis.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.320
If you eat meat you become Rajo Gunis not Tamo Gunis.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.880
Tamo Gunis are the people who eat carbohydrates,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.800
we have seen it in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.800
We have two types of diseases,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.240
one is lethargic organs and one is active organs.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.800
So those who are lethargic having too much carbohydrates

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.320
and those who are overactive are having too much proteins in them.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.400
I mean if you take proteins, in the science, scientifically,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.400
will you become lethargic? I mean ask any doctor.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.640
And then the doctor says Gita is all humbug

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.880
because it doesn't understand what it is saying.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.560
And while you say like this that “We must follow Gita.”

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.880
I think somebody has gone wrong there

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.480
and has written something wrong in Gita

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.880
as they have written in Bible, they have written in every book.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.480
I'll tell you what they have written wrong in

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.400
Bible later on when it comes to Christ.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.960
I think just some people have put it there for oppose.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.720
If you eat too much meat you get Raj Gunis

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.640
and Raj Gunis become as I have told you right-sided people,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.320
become very aggressive

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.240
and they become ahamkaris and they can harm.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.720
But the people who just eat grass can become

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.720
lethargic, absolutely lethargic.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.320
They will have lethargic heart, not active heart,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.480
they will also get heart attack.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.160
They will have lethargic intestines by which they will get

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.720
tremendous all the time passing out of the stools,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.880
they'll never be able to digest any food,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
they'll be very weak people.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.480
So those people who have a lethargic heart or a lethargic

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.480
liver or lethargic intestines should take to proteins.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.720
I'm not saying meats, but proteins.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.240
But a vegetarian doesn't take so much proteins.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.240
It's easier to take meat, there's no harm.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.800
But those who are active people should take

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.560
more to vegetables. It’s sensible.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.160
Guru Nanaka ate all the meats, was he a bad man?

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.800
These Maarwadis who are supposed to be absolutely abstaining

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.240
from even from lahasoon (garlic) and pyaj (onion).

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.640
Was He worse than them by any chance?

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800
What about Buddha, Himself? He ate meat

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.080
because He died of eating raw meat, Himself.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.560
Only thing you should not eat the meat

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.560
of animals which are bigger than you,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.560
and not of a cow which is an Indian cow.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.240
Specially Indian cow.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.080
Also bigger cows are not good

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.400
because they give you a problem on the teeth.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.880
But smaller animals, even with Jainism

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.720
they said that you must save the bullocks, the cows,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.400
and you must save other animals,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.000
but they never said you must save goats

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.160
and you must save chickens.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.960
Because Mahavira knew we cannot give Realization to chickens.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.640
What is the use of saving chickens and mosquitoes

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.400
and also bugs?

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.240
Of course they are doing like that.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.640
Some Jain people save bugs and

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.400
put it on a human being, and they take the blood of those

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.880
human beings and they are paid for it.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.640
It's absurd but they do it.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.880
For them bugs are more important than human beings.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.560
Billions and billions of bugs cannot make a human being.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.320
All these absurd ideas we have in this country.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.560
So when I say you are not to be a vegetarian

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.880
or non-vegetarian, you have to see what you need and eat that.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.240
But all the time your attention is in food itself is wrong.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.960
So there is no good in you people

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.880
getting into these problems of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.080
Of course in the Western countries people should take

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.800
to vegetarian food, not absolutely, but more than what they have,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.160
while the people who are in India who are vegetarians

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.320
will have to later on take to meat. Otherwise

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.160
they will have lethargic heart.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.640
I’ll cure them once again they will have problem,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.240
then they will have to go for a by-pass. Save money there?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.160
You cannot. You will have lethargic intestines,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.960
then you will have lethargic liver. You will have all kinds of

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.000
cirrhosis, or maybe on the hand you might get

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:37.240
all kinds of rashes and things like that, allergies,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.880
all these problems will come. And then ultimately such people

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.000
look so peaceful because you see, they are like cabbages.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.240
Yes. If somebody is like a cabbage

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.720
then how do you give him Realization?

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.960
You can't give Realization to cabbages can you?

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.000
We have to have here chivalrous people,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.480
brave people, warriors.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.560
You have to fight the evil forces, and what can

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.400
these people who are cabbages going to do for it?

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.960
One has to understand yatharth, the reality

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.560
and not put your conception. Because you are born in a Jain family

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:38.480
and that's why you want everybody to eat grass, is wrong , is wrong.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.960
The one who has to eat protein must eat protein.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.880
Now what is the food for Sattvic people?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.320
That one should eat. You can’t live with it.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.000
So what I eat? Channa.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.720
Can you live with channa? Is protein.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.480
Channa, or you can eat meat.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:08.000
But not very heavy meats, lean meats and ghee,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:21.400
and what I eat the most is honey.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.240
That's My food. Honey I eat, you know that, honey I drink.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.720
That's. But you can't live with that can you?

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.000
So you have to eat little carbohydrates. Doesn't matter,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.000
but you balance yourself in Nabhi Chakra

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.560
But there should be no attention on food at all.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.160
Actually if you ask Me what I ate

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.880
in the morning, I won't be able to tell you.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.960
Really I'm very bad

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.720
because I have no attention on it.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.240
Whatever one gets, eat it, and you don't feel like eating, don't eat.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.560
What's so important

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.000
is to enjoy every moment of your life.
