00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:05,501
TV Reporter: Work stress has become a
modern day epidemic but trials have shown

2
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:11,156
an ancient practice could be the best way
to beat it. Meditation is proving effective

3
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:15,131
and it costs, virtually, nothing.
Health Reporter: Henry Viana was so

4
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:19,546
stressed running his previous business with
clients not paying, working long hours.

5
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:22,472
He nearly threw the towel in.
Stress Survivor: In the most, men are the

6
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:26,924
typical male. Now I have no problems,
I'm fine, you know. And then, next thing

7
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:30,695
you know, you know, that done something
silly like jump off on a bridge.

8
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:35,522
Health Reporter: Henry wasn't alone. 25% 
of the population is depressed. Half of us

9
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:41,147
are very unhappy and stress now
costs Australia $15 billion a year.

10
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:44,597
Dr. Ramesh Manocha: Experts are 
calling this an epidemicive stress.

11
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:48,006
Health Reporter: But Dr. Manocha, Sydney
university team, in one of the most

12
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:53,564
rigorous trials ever conducted, has proven
traditional meditation can eliminate rapid

13
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:57,547
thoughts that keep you wide and stressed.
Dr. Manocha: In what is showed quite

14
00:00:57,547 --> 00:01:02,632
clearly, was that a meditation technique
that focuses on the experience of mental

15
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:08,999
silence, in this case, a technique called
Sahaja yoga, significantly reduced stress

16
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:12,440
and depressive feelings.
Health Reporter: Meditation costs, virtually,

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,398
nothing to learn and Henry's also taught friends to
meditate, the required 10 minutes, twice a day.

18
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:22,700
Stress Survivor: Huge benefits, if it's changed
a lot so in effect that saved a lot two of them

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,073
Health Reporter: Doctors caution is this
is not an overnight solution and those,

20
00:01:26,073 --> 00:01:29,830
who are really depressed should be seeking
medical advice. The point is, if you

21
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,573
take up meditation early, it can prevent
stress leading to mental health issues.

Stress Survivor: I was always angry and
