1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:21,910
In Sahaja Yoga the Guru puja has a very different
significance from any other guru puja.

2
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:37,870
When you worship your Guru you are also worshiping
the Guru within you.

3
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:58,929
This is not in any other guru-disciple system
because, in you, the Guru, the Master has

4
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:01,600
been awakened.

5
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:12,750
And so, when you are worshipping your Guru,
then this Master within you is also worshipped,

6
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:20,780
you respect it, you glorify it, you awaken
it, and you manifest it.

7
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:32,260
This we have to realise that – in Sahaja
Yoga – if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

8
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:46,410
Now, the quality of Guru, first and foremost,
is that he makes you meet God: means he raises

9
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:56,230
the Kundalini and establish the relation between
the All-pervading Power.

10
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:05,960
And as your Guru is Adi Shakti, you make that
person meet, also, the Adi Shakti.

11
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:14,850
So you have a double advantage that, at the
same time, when you give them Realisation,

12
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:24,450
not only that you make them feel the union
with the Divine Power, but you can make them

13
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,060
meet the Divinity Itself, the source of Divine
Power.

14
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:37,621
So your responsibility, as Sahaja Yogis, is
very great because in you is there is the

15
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:38,621
Guru.

16
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:47,319
Now in our mantras we say that, “Mother,
I am my own Guru."

17
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:54,760
But, saying that, do we realise that: if I
am my own Guru, this “I” and “my Guru,”

18
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,920
between the two, what have I achieved?

19
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,900
Where am I?

20
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Can I guide myself?

21
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:15,030
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my attention
so well established and manifested that I

22
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,810
can guide myself and guide others later on?

23
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:29,180
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important that you see to yourself – the

24
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,190
introspection: Can I be my own Guru?

25
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,870
Have I become my own Guru?

26
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:54,060
Now, in your case, your Guru is a Mother,
a woman, so, it has to be among women that

27
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,390
the development of their Guru qualities have
to be very well manifested.

28
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,550
But it’s just the way it is not.

29
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:15,220
For them, they are still the mothers or they
are the wives or they are Sahaja Yoginis.

30
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,329
But they don’t realise that you are also
the Gurus.

31
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:33,810
And, because your Mother is a Guru, because
She is a woman; and you have to be also of

32
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,810
that quality, that people should say, “Look
at this woman, she’s such a Guru."

33
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,490
But still, as I hear from the different leaders
that the ladies are absolutely still very

34
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,470
much far away and are very few who can be
called as real Sahaja Yoginis.

35
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,550
It’s a sad thing to hear.

36
00:04:51,550 --> 00:05:02,280
Because if you still keep to all these mundane
things of womanhood and the drawbacks of womanhood,

37
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,090
which has come out of domination maybe, because
of always they were shown to be something

38
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,090
lower.

39
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:15,150
Specially in the Christian religion they were
never regarded as something holy.

40
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:24,200
They have this kind of a diffidence in them
that they don’t understand that dharma can

41
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,750
be established more by women than by men.

42
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:43,390
And the Guru’s work is to establish the
dharma – in the society, in the family,

43
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,390
in relationships.

44
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,390
All these Gurus, which are representing all
these great symbols here, have done nothing

45
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,570
but have established dharma.

46
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,710
But, first of all, before establishing the
dharma, we should watch ourselves – have

47
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:00,000
we got dharma within ourselves or not?

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:14,190
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma is that he listens to others, he

49
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,830
obeys.

50
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,521
And this is something [that] has gone wrong
with the Western women, I think, that they

51
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:24,550
have forgotten how to listen to others, how
to obey others.

52
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:32,430
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

53
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,460
Obedience, if you do not have, nobody’s
going to obey you.

54
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,450
First, you must learn to obey.

55
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:49,889
A person like Kabira, because he was born
of a unknown cast, people didn’t know what

56
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:59,120
he was born from, and he could not go directly
to any Guru.

57
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:09,550
So, he heard about Ramanand, a great Guru
of those days, who used to go to the river

58
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,160
Ganges every morning to have his bath.

59
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:22,300
So one day on his steps Kabira kept lying,
and in the darkness the Guru could not see,

60
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,860
and he touched him with his feet.

61
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,310
He said, “Who are you?”

62
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,450
So he said, “I’m Kabir, and I’m your
disciple."

63
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,020
And he caught hold of his feet.

64
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,990
And when he caught hold of his feet, he [Ramanand]
said, “Alright, come along!”

65
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:46,550
And then he became such a great saint in India.

66
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,780
People know him more than they know his Guru;
he became so great.

67
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,270
The basic thing is humility.

68
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,720
Yesterday you saw how the musician (Nishat
Khan) was humble.

69
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,979
All the time he was humble.

70
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,430
He didn’t know how to express his humility
every time.

71
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,860
All the time he was humble.

72
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:15,490
Because in humility only you can receive the
blessings, you can receive the quality that

73
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,539
is of your Guru.

74
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:29,150
Now, for a Guru as you have seen that, in
My own way, in My own image, you have to come

75
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,460
up.

76
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,349
First of all your life should be absolutely
transparent.

77
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,800
Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

78
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,890
Everybody should know what you are doing,
where you are going, what is the way you live,

79
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,830
what is the way you are behaving.

80
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:54,230
I have seen people, who are gurus, also in
the sense that we call them leaders, or we

81
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:00,200
can call them sub-gurus, or they can not be
called as priest, but I can say ‘communication

82
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,760
centres’ as they are.

83
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,000
In them you find that they are very fussy
type of people.

84
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,750
Always think about their body, always think
about their comfort, always grudge about – nobody

85
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,350
looked after them – as if they suffer from
persecution-mania!

86
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,640
Or they will grudge about food, “I didn’t
eat my food for one day!”

87
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,100
Doesn’t matter!

88
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,610
For a Guru it’s better to starve for about
three, four days nicely, so that you get over

89
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,820
this idea of hunger.

90
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,700
You’ll be surprised since I’m here I have
not eaten anything much, and just drinking

91
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,380
something, because just the Guru has no hunger.

92
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:52,600
Because it is in your stomach the Guru, vibrations,
are so much that you don’t feel like eating

93
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,730
anything.

94
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,140
So then, what do you eat and how do you eat
and all these things that we have given up

95
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,980
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

96
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,910
So even if leaders have this nonsense in their
head [like] what do you get to eat!

97
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,290
I mean, this is the basics, absolutely!

98
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:15,930
And when I hear some people telling Me, oh,
what did they eat and how did they eat and

99
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,930
all!

100
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,950
It’s like I feel they are like tourists
in Sahaja Yoga.

101
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:25,790
Just come in Sahaja Yoga like tourists, you
see, to see places and go round and to know

102
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,459
where you get, in what restaurant, you get
good food and cheaply.

103
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:42,860
All this is so basically, absolutely not a
manifestation of Guru Principle.

104
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,050
Now you have seen your Guru as She is.

105
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:54,290
I do not know what I eat, what they give Me,
what I want.

106
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,390
They go on giving Me whatever they think I
like, and I just don’t know if I like that

107
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,330
thing or not, or what is it.

108
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,000
If they ask Me, “Mother, what will You have?”

109
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,090
I said, “What will I have, I don’t know
really, what will I have?

110
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,120
Anything!”

111
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,490
So there has to be no choices.

112
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,590
First of all not to waste your attention on
choices.

113
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,740
Of course, only on vibrations.

114
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,060
I mean, supposing, you go to a restaurant,
find all kinds of funny vibrations there,

115
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,300
people are getting drunk or anything, then
of course you should say.

116
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,440
But all the choices must be based on vibrations
and not on material things.

117
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,410
That you get something nice there, “Let’s
go there,” and they’ll travel for fifty

118
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,060
miles to go eat something nonsensical.

119
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,660
It should be all nonsense for all Sahaja Yogis.

120
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,709
And when I said “Sahaja Yogi” it means
also Sahaja Yoginis.

121
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:52,180
So the food part of it is aswadha.

122
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,850
You should not have any taste for any special
food.

123
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:03,370
Specially in France to say that people may
not like, but French are very, very conscientious

124
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,800
or aware about the food part.

125
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:14,680
I don’t know how far they make really good
food, but at least they think they eat very

126
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
good food.

127
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,160
So, the eating of good food is a kind of a
addiction.

128
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,029
It’s a kind of an addiction; it’s something
like drug – that you must have good food.

129
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:33,610
So Zen started this system of what they call
the tea ceremony.

130
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:40,769
In the tea ceremony what they did, I mean,
I have been through that and it’s really

131
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,220
quite a test of people.

132
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,570
With Me it was alright, but the rest of them
got really frightened.

133
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:55,610
That in the tea ceremony whatever rituals
they do they give you a tea, which is so bitter,

134
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,250
and we can say [like] quinine raised to power
108!

135
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,220
It’s like that.

136
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:06,589
And they give you very nicely, handle you
with such ritual that you have to take it.

137
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:12,279
So first they say, “You see the cup without
thinking."

138
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,960
So he tried to make thoughtless awareness
through the cup.

139
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,890
I don’t know how much one can achieve with
that.

140
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:26,190
But that tea if you take once, your tongue
is good for anything.

141
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:36,459
And to compensate it they give you something
sweet, which is again sweetness raised to

142
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:41,500
power 108, so sweet that it becomes bitter!

143
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,800
So sweet.

144
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,970
So this is just to conquer the tongue [that]
Zen must have thought that better give them

145
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:59,860
this tea ceremony where there is no tea, there’s
nothing but just you really give such shocks

146
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,190
to your tongue, so that after that you can
eat whatever you get.

147
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,839
And that’s why you must know that Japanese
can eat anything.

148
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,480
They have solved their food problem because
they can eat anything!

149
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:26,600
They can just fish out some crabs or could
be some prawns, just peel them out like peanuts

150
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,089
and eat them like that.

151
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,930
I think Zen has solved this problem for them,
because they have food shortage and this is

152
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,220
how they can eat everything: they can eat
the bark of the tree, they can eat the snake,

153
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,510
they can eat the lizards, they can eat the
frogs, everything they can eat, so all their

154
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:51,940
eating problems are solved in that country
by Zen, I think, because you have no taste.

155
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:58,930
But in this I think the worst are, in the
whole world are Indians.

156
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,440
They are the fussiest people for food.

157
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,959
Because their women have spoiled them.

158
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,920
They know very good cooking and they know
how to handle their husbands by cooking very

159
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
well.

160
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,440
And the way they cook food for them, you see,
the men have to go back to Indian food.

161
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,120
Even if they travel the whole world, they’ll
need Indian food, they can’t get over their

162
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
tongues.

163
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,959
It is such a big conditioning in India of
food that I just don’t know how will they

164
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,880
get out, the, absolutely, the basics which
are important.

165
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,860
Gandhiji tried that very much in the ashram
(laughing).

166
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:42,380
He used to give horrid food, boiled food with
the oil of mustard on top and then nobody

167
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,310
could eat that.

168
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,310
Raw!

169
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,320
And he used to make everybody eat that.

170
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:54,089
Not only that, he would make them clean the
bathrooms, WC’s, everything so that you

171
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,510
get rid of your nose also, that you need everything.

172
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,779
Because so many people you will, while eating
also in India will put something to their

173
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,329
noses, and they smell everything.

174
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,760
So they are oversensitive to their tongue
and to their nose.

175
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,010
But not to their eyes, to eyes they are not.

176
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:17,019
For eyes I would say the most sensitive people
are Japanese and Chinese and also the Western

177
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:21,410
people are very much sensitive because they
don’t like to see anything dirty, filthy

178
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,410
or ugly.

179
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:31,959
Indians won’t mind any dirt, filth, anything,
just like dogs and what you call, horses or

180
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:32,959
buffalos!

181
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,399
They can walk through any dirt, filth – anything!

182
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,170
Nothing matters to them, anything ugly, any
ugly building or an ugly dress or anything

183
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,170
is alright for them.

184
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,910
It doesn’t matter, to their eyes it doesn’t
matter at all.

185
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,870
Only thing [is that] kitchen should be clean
and they are all the time in the kitchen.

186
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,760
So we don’t have to learn all these bad
things from Indians.

187
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,649
There are some good things they have, but
there are certain things [which] are very

188
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,649
bad conditionings.

189
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:01,550
And the next to that are, I think, the French.

190
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:12,589
But if you eat English food you can become
quite good because there’s no taste in English

191
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,709
food (laughter and applause).

192
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:26,600
So, I have no problem anywhere because I think
I have no taste at all and I can eat anything

193
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:33,179
any way it is cooked, it’s alright, I don’t
bother about what is cooked, what is not cooked.

194
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,540
But if you have some French people for a dinner
in a restaurant they will spend forty-five

195
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,239
minutes deciding what they are going to eat,
and what a waste of energy!

196
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,690
Forty-five minutes just to decide what they
are going to eat!

197
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,960
After all what is so great, what you are going
to eat?

198
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
It’s all there.

199
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,370
Just one thing that everybody should have.

200
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,869
So for Sahaja Yogis it’s important to give
up this idea, “I will have this."

201
00:17:55,869 --> 00:18:01,580
First of all nobody should ask, “What will
you have?”

202
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,940
To Me also.

203
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,019
I do not like people asking Me questions [like],
“What will You have?”

204
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:19,470
Because I’ve to think about it and I want
to be in Nirvichara (laughter and applause).

205
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:37,250
So, this is a, one, big ordeal, which we do
not understand: how much we are attached to

206
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,809
food.

207
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:40,609
And food goes in the stomach.

208
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:47,299
And not only that it spoils our guru system,
but also spoils our physical system.

209
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:50,470
So we should try not to look at food.

210
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:57,179
That’s why fasting was told to the all the
people who wanted to develop their Gurupada,

211
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,809
so that they should not fast.

212
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:07,870
But they do not fast normally because they
think of food, so there’s no fasting.

213
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,909
I mean, fasting means that you go into nirvichara
and don’t think of food.

214
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:17,729
But they are all the time thinking of food,
so it has no meaning and you are just the

215
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:21,109
same whether you eat it or not, your mind
is eating it all the time.

216
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:30,149
Then you start thinking, “When will I end
my fast and know where will I go to have what?”

217
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:35,679
So this is a very basic thing that we should
get rid of our habits, of our conditionings

218
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,609
– what we are going to have and what food
we are going to have.

219
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:46,399
Our children also should be given a proper
training about it that – it’s alright,

220
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:50,419
sometimes there is no salt, sometimes there’s
no sugar, doesn’t matter.

221
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:52,979
And sometimes there’s nothing, doesn’t
matter.

222
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:57,029
Nothing [is] important for a Sahaja Yogi,
you can live without food for days together,

223
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,720
no problem.

224
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:08,559
So for a Sahaja Yogi there’s nothing like
taste of food and hunger.

225
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,539
There’s only one hunger is to be purified,
to be clean.

226
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:23,059
This is one of the things that dirties our
mind, we should say, that we think about food

227
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:27,519
all the time.

228
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,860
Even in Russia I found people carried all
Indian things there, they were cooking all

229
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,090
Indian things, and I am, poor thing, I can’t
eat anything.

230
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,419
So they cooked, brought everything for Me,
thinking I’m an Indian, but they don’t

231
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,940
know I am Zen – I cannot, I do not, have
sense of taste.

232
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,809
So once, to get over taste one has to work
out.

233
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:51,370
It’s an experiment you have to do with ourselves.

234
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,429
Unless and until we introspect ourselves and
do experiments we cannot rise.

235
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,620
Because though the Kundalini is trying her
level best, but your conditionings are so

236
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,379
great that it cannot pierce through and cannot
make you onto that Guru level.

237
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:14,340
If you see the lives of all these Gurus: they
were married, they had children, they lived

238
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:21,889
a normal life but in their own personal life
they were absolutely detached people.

239
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:27,849
So, first detachment should come from food.

240
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,989
And there whatever you like you just don’t
eat.

241
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,359
That’s the best way.

242
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,990
Because already because of liking something…supposing
if somebody’s fond of ice-cream.

243
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:42,119
He must have already spoiled his liver; so
then, give [it] up now.

244
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:45,590
If you like pasta, give up pasta.

245
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:50,950
If you like something else, just give up,
don’t ask for it and don’t eat it at all;

246
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,609
so that, you see, your mind will get little
bit detached from it.

247
00:21:55,609 --> 00:22:04,749
It’s very easy to achieve this detachment,
I think, if you work it out in a sensible

248
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:05,749
way.

249
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:07,309
Just try to punish your body.

250
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:12,249
You see, if you are your Guru, you better
take hold of first of all your body and your

251
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,249
conditionings.

252
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,999
You have to treat your body with this thing.

253
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:21,029
I am told many girls who have married abroad
are still making their Indian food and eating

254
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,029
that.

255
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:23,029
It’s horrible it is!

256
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:24,080
They should starve.

257
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,519
If they starve for say about five, six days
or maybe eight days, then they’ll eat any

258
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,120
food in any case.

259
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,529
That’s why the fasting is given.

260
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:38,739
So one should adjust oneself to any kind of
food you can have.

261
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:44,740
And if you want to survive then you eat anything,
so just make it a point that you get rid of

262
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:52,909
this very simple conditioning you have – of
liking the food that you want to eat and you

263
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:54,019
don’t want to have anything else.

264
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:59,289
I think as Sahaja Yogini or Sahaja Yogi who
cannot get rid of this little thing, then

265
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:01,309
how can you call him a Sahaja Yogi?

266
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:02,309
I don’t know.

267
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:03,309
He’s very asahaj.

268
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,419
Because the other day I met one lady.

269
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,879
I said, “What is the matter, where have
you been?”

270
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:11,049
She said, “I have been looking out for some
sort of an Indian ingredient."

271
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,019
I said, “How can you get it here in this
Spain?

272
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,019
You cannot."

273
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,019
“Why?”

274
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,919
“Because they asked me to make Indian food."

275
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:18,919
“Alright.

276
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,529
Then without that can’t you make Indian
food?

277
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:24,059
What is the need to run all the way, whole
day for a one small little thing called hing

278
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,059
(asafoetida)?”

279
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:28,049
There’s a big name for that, it’s a small
little thing.

280
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:32,590
Just to get that she had to run all over the
places to get it!

281
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:40,349
So for people who are Sahaja Yogis if they
are sahaj, whatever is available you can make

282
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:44,250
something nice out of it and eat it.

283
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,159
So that shows what?

284
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,659
It shows sagacity, shows trupti (तृप्ति
– contentment), shows your satisfaction.

285
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,469
And that is one of the manifestations of a
Guru that he’s a satisfied soul.

286
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,320
He’s just self-contained, he doesn’t bother.

287
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:07,970
Now, for example, some people, specially in
the West, thank God, they are not spoiled

288
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,409
by their wives so much.

289
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:12,210
They don’t have so much of conditioning,
they can eat anything.

290
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:17,600
I’ve seen that when they come on the India
tour, all the Indians say, “Horrid food

291
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,960
was given and the poor things were eating
that horrid food and this and that."

292
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,279
And I asked them, “Which place you like
the best?”

293
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,279
They said, “Brahmapuri."

294
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,279
I said, “Eh?

295
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:31,129
They were saying Brahmapuri had the worst
food and everybody is complaining."

296
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:32,129
“No, no.

297
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:37,149
Brahmapuri was the best, because we could
bathe in the river and we could sing and we

298
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,149
could enjoy it!”

299
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:45,200
You see, that’s the sign of one thing, to
get rid of your bad habits of food business.

300
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,489
Now the second part is for the body you need
comforts.

301
00:24:51,489 --> 00:25:00,330
I must congratulate the Western Sahaja Yogis
that they may be coming from any walk of life

302
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:06,259
– I must say, the Indians have to learn
from them – they may be coming from any

303
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,649
position or status.

304
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:15,279
All of them enjoy the comfort of the Spirit
when they travel in the Tour.

305
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,979
They do not ask for, “I haven’t got a
chair, I haven’t got a bed, I haven’t

306
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:23,129
got a proper things here."

307
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:31,460
In this way, you see, you will realise that
the body comfort is of no importance.

308
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,979
It’s, we have just spoilt our body, there’s
no need, no need.

309
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:37,820
Body you put it anywhere, will sleep in any
case.

310
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,649
If you cannot sleep for two nights, alright,
put on some music for one night or two nights

311
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:43,649
as we had here, you will sleep anyway! (laughter
and applause as everybody fell asleep during

312
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:57,929
the Nishat Khan performance the night before)

313
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:06,340
So this is the second point is that we have
to give up body comfort.

314
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:15,830
But the third point where I think the Western
people falter is their materialistic attitude.

315
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:22,139
Materialistic attitude and their fondness
of their eyes.

316
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:24,379
So one of them is the worst of all.

317
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:30,570
I mean, the worst in worst of all is that
you can never have, that’s such a big blot

318
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:36,309
if you have that is to have a roving eye and
things like that.

319
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,309
It’s out of question.

320
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:39,379
That’s out of question for women or for
men.

321
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:42,669
They are not Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

322
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:47,989
They have to have very clean eyes.

323
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:50,149
That part is alright.

324
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:53,919
And the second part is the greed, lust and
greed.

325
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:02,840
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga maybe the lust
part is over, but greed is still there with

326
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,980
so many who get lost.

327
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,749
So I would say Indians do not have this lust
problem, but they still have greed, greed

328
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:19,820
problem – means they want to buy something
like a radio or some electrical stuff they

329
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
must buy.

330
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,440
If they come abroad they must buy something.

331
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,489
It’s alright, if you get it, well and good,
if they don’t get it, well and good.

332
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:27,519
It should be [that attitude].

333
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:33,450
But for a Westerner, you see, he would not
like to give up his furniture, which his great

334
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,639
grandmother had it.

335
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:37,820
Though he can’t sit on it because it’s
so old.

336
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,369
If he sits on it, it will be break.

337
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:44,609
But he must keep it to show off that, “I
had a great grandmother who gave this unique

338
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:45,609
chair."

339
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,469
According to Indian standards it’s junk!

340
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:50,190
Absolute junk.

341
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,200
Because it is good for nothing you put it
in the drawing room, nobody can sit on it

342
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,159
and it looks junky.

343
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,450
But according to the Western mind the older
it is, the better – whether it is a junk

344
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,799
or anything – he’ll have so many junks
in the house and they will sell like hot cakes.

345
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,009
Because there’s a very subtle materialistic
attitude towards matter that, “This will

346
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:14,749
sell like hot cakes if I sell it,” because
there must be another mad Westerner who would

347
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:16,220
like to buy that junk.

348
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,320
You see?

349
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,529
So this junk that you have in the house it’s
better to get rid of, because God knows how

350
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:24,970
many people must have used [it].

351
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,559
It’s like a grave in the house.

352
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,029
It’s a grave.

353
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:30,669
So to have then also the antique jewellery.

354
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:41,289
Antique jewellery is another mad, antique
is a – what you can say – is the fad or

355
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,159
addiction of the Western people – antique.

356
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:47,960
For us nothing is antique because we still
produce antique things, beautiful things so

357
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,169
Indians don’t understand the value of antiques.

358
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:55,809
They don’t understand how these people are
so mad after torn things and broken things

359
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:58,539
and dirty things and filthy things!

360
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:01,889
But the Western mind has been brought up that
way.

361
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:06,549
Now, in these antique things I have seen that,
once I went to somebody’s house, you see,

362
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:09,639
and he asked Me with very great honour to
sit on his chair.

363
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:14,740
And as soon as I sat on the chair I thought
there were snakes and there were scorpions

364
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,359
all biting Me.

365
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,149
I got a fright, I got up.

366
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:19,450
I said, “What is it?”

367
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,580
He said, “This is from great, great, great
grandmother, you see, she gave us this thing."

368
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,460
I said, “It will break, I better sit outside."

369
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,460
(laughter)

370
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:36,129
So this also madness of this antique is so
much that it is unbelievable how people go

371
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:37,129
into it.

372
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:43,279
So there’s a joke in India there’s a very
great writer called as Premchand, he wrote

373
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:51,950
about two Englishmen going on the road of
Benares when they were hit by a lota (metal

374
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:57,589
pot), that they use for their bathrooms, fell
on their feet.

375
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,830
And it fell on their feet.

376
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:05,450
And jokingly he says, “on the feet where
all the bureaucrats fall."

377
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,970
Means, all Indian bureaucrats used to fall
at the feet of the English at that time!

378
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,399
So he made a joke.

379
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,399
But doesn’t matter.

380
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,159
Then the English, you see, looked at that
thing and they were very angry and immediately

381
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:19,200
they took to law, “You have to come to the
courts, you have to come to the police and

382
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,629
we’re going to report this has fallen there,
it has hit us,” and all that.

383
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:30,739
So there was a clever man, he knew the English
or the Western mind, he said, “Sir, do you

384
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:33,409
know this, this lota has very valuable!”

385
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,539
He said, “Why?”

386
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:39,089
“Because this one was used by Akbar the
Great.

387
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:40,259
So ancient it is.

388
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:41,289
” He said, “Really?”

389
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:45,190
“Yes it is and, you know, you just don’t
quarrel with them.

390
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,089
And ask them for this lota."

391
00:30:47,089 --> 00:30:50,999
And he told in Indian language to them that,
“I have befooled these people, I have told

392
00:30:50,999 --> 00:31:01,489
them that this lota belonged to Akbar and
you have to take this lota and use this lota

393
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:04,769
to just to befool them."

394
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:08,820
So then they asked, “But alright, we’ll
forgive you, we’ll not take you to any courts

395
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,059
or anything, but you just give us this lota."

396
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:13,539
They said, “No, we can’t."

397
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,539
He said, “Why?”

398
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,629
“Because it’s such an antique piece, you
see."

399
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:21,159
In India you won’t find anybody respecting
antique pieces, especially in Benares nobody

400
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:22,159
bothers.

401
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,959
(Laughter) So they said, “Really?”, “Yes,
it belonged to Akbar and, you know, my father

402
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:30,299
was, my forefathers worked with him, so he
gave us this lota, we can’t give you, we

403
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:31,299
are sorry, you see."

404
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:36,999
“No, no, no, no, please give us, you see,
and we’ll no take you to the police."

405
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:39,779
“Alright, you charge us, whatever money
you charge us,” and all that.

406
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,669
In those days they paid one thousand rupees,
you see, this is equal to, now, one crore

407
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,019
(10 million), I think.

408
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:51,119
They gave, these English paid them and bought
that lota, which had nothing to do with Akbar

409
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,809
or anyone.

410
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:56,769
So this madness of antique has to go away
from our minds.

411
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:02,919
It’s such a built-in thing within us, that
we always talk of antiquities.

412
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:07,929
Perhaps maybe because of wars everything was
destroyed and whatever was in the olden times

413
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:12,169
was something very beautiful and good and
now we are not making very good things, perhaps,

414
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:13,200
maybe that is the reason.

415
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,820
But now we are making nice things, we can
make.

416
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,850
Now in England I was surprised the old crafts
are coming up, everywhere I go the old crafts

417
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,979
are coming up.

418
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:30,049
So to respect antiques means you just stop
making the old craft revive.

419
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:36,320
Because you pay so much to the antiques, the
same thing made today won’t fetch the same

420
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,229
price as it was.

421
00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:44,889
Now this has ruined our creativity, ruined
our handwork and it has ruined our whole – I

422
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:50,679
think the quality of our life, because the
way we are mad after antiques.

423
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,739
So this also should go from your head that
anything antique is something good.

424
00:32:56,739 --> 00:33:01,109
It’s a very superficial value – if you
see to it.

425
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:04,919
Because people think that antique is something
expensive.

426
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,720
It’s just a marketing style that people
have felt that this is expensive, that is

427
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,169
expensive, so it’s something great to wear
something stupid and to say that, “this

428
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:17,509
is antique jewellery,” and go about.

429
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:23,299
I mean, God knows how many people must have
used it and must have worn it and what must

430
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:25,659
be the feelings of that person.

431
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:32,639
So we have to understand that this conditioning
that we have in our heads, that we must have

432
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:40,339
something antiques with us, keep something
of such value.

433
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:44,519
I mean, these questions never arose before,
so it’s not written in any books.

434
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,359
Anyone of the books of the Gurus is not written
that, “Don’t care for antiques."

435
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,690
They have written, “Don’t drink, don’t
smoke,” all other things which spoils your

436
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,690
Nabhi.

437
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,149
They’ve written all these things.

438
00:33:56,149 --> 00:34:01,070
But they have not written that, “Don’t
worry about antiques so much."

439
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:08,020
You see, and I find that’s a craze nowadays
and so we have to tell people that we have

440
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
to be careful.

441
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,819
Moreover I feel the way people have gone to
drugs and that, maybe that because they used

442
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:17,929
so much antiques that the bhoots from the
antiques must have caught them.

443
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:21,859
Can’t understand that why people are so
melancholy, all the time crying, weeping,

444
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,089
and all that.

445
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:30,580
So the conditionings of these matter as we
think it to be is to be absolutely taken out.

446
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,240
Of course, I mean in certain countries we
should say that the antique things [that]

447
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,669
were made were good and nice.

448
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:40,889
But, only because something is antique it
should not be respected, [but] because of

449
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:47,369
its intrinsic value of aesthetics, it’s
alright.

450
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:51,560
But one has to see first of all the vibrations
of everything.

451
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,279
If the vibrations are good then you should
accept, otherwise not, because we have the

452
00:34:57,279 --> 00:35:05,269
language of vibrations and we have to use
the language of vibrations.

453
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:11,470
Once you start using the language of vibrations
you’ll be surprised how you will get the

454
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:19,869
complete picture as to what is to be done.

455
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:27,270
So to get rid of these three conditionings
too, for our body is very important.

456
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:35,450
And the worst thing for a Sahaja Yogi [is]
to think that he’s sick: is a, sort of a,

457
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,329
tarnishing the name of Sahaja Yoga.

458
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:43,420
If you still feel you are sick you better
get out of Sahaja Yoga!

459
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:50,980
Because either you get well or you are not
a Sahaja Yogi, one of the two things.

460
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:56,150
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to see that
you get well and if there are certain problems

461
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,240
also – doesn’t matter.

462
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,040
Now, for example, supposing, I have certain
problems, which I know, because of Sahaja

463
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:11,410
Yoga, because of My position as the Mother,
position as Adi Shakti: certain physical things

464
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,140
I have to face, parasympathetic working I
have to face, but I go through it!

465
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
Is accepted.

466
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,779
You have to accept your body as it is and
you are not to sort of say that, “I’m

467
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:26,610
not well,” and “There’s something wrong
with me,” and go on complaining like some

468
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,820
old hag!

469
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,529
Never think you are old, first of all.

470
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:35,990
Never think that you have gone old or you
are no good.

471
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,200
Look at your Mother.

472
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,480
I never think that way.

473
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,630
Yesterday half of you were sleeping, still
I was alert and listening to the music and

474
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,250
today I’m again alert here.

475
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,820
So if you have a Guru then that image should
be with you that: “Look at our Mother.

476
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,400
She’s so old, how much She travels, how
much She does!”

477
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,500
Alright, you might say, She’s the Adi Shakti!

478
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,160
But little bit of shakti you too have.

479
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,670
And that shakti is to be shown by your full
dynamism.

480
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:12,309
If you have no dynamism and if you still feel
very weak that means you are not a Sahaja

481
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:13,309
Yogi.

482
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:18,619
So just ask for, ask for any amount of energy
– it can come to you.

483
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:20,130
That dynamism, it should be there.

484
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:25,779
Now this I would say, for the physical self
that one has to know that you are all younger

485
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:31,769
and getting younger and younger, but not the
stupidity of youth, but gravity, the gravity

486
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:33,770
of the age.

487
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:40,450
Actually I have seen children who are born
realised, they are very grave, they won’t

488
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,430
do anything that is not dignified.

489
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:50,390
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to some of – the Sahaja Yoginis

490
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,480
have a bad habit of talking, “tuk, tuk,
tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,” among themselves.

491
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,630
It’s a very bad habit.

492
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,089
Which shows that they [are] still very much
lacking.

493
00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:02,900
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis you do
not become a Sahaja Yogini.

494
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,440
First of all, what is the gravity?

495
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,520
You should only speak whenever it is necessary.

496
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,230
So I have seen these Sahaja Yogis who are
born realised children they stand like this

497
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,230
before Me.

498
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,290
And they say very few words, but beautiful
words they speak.

499
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:22,859
And say things, which you can remember all
the time.

500
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:26,470
They just do not go on wasting anything.

501
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,589
And they are extremely obedient.

502
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:34,390
So from them one can learn that these are
born realised and the way their Guru principle

503
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,990
is acting, are we also acting the same way?

504
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,650
Or we are doing something that is not good
for our ascent?

505
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,950
So even after coming to Sahaja Yoga if you
do not try hard to introspect yourself, you

506
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,400
have missed the point that you compare yourself
with your Guru – all the time.

507
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Now.

508
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,270
Then everything has to be understood in the
right perspective that we are Sahaja Yogis.

509
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:03,150
Now for a Sahaja Yogi first and foremost thing
[is] that he has to have love.

510
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,150
First.

511
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,220
For others, not for himself.

512
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,089
If you are all the time worried about yourself,
“My body is such, my this thing such, and

513
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:15,500
I have to do this and that,” then you don’t
love others.

514
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,170
But do you see to the comfort of others?

515
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,680
Do you feel the compassion of other Sahaja
Yogis?

516
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,099
Do you feel, “What have I to bring for them?

517
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,099
What is missing in them?”

518
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:26,430
Do you work it out?

519
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,180
Do you go out of the way to help them?

520
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,740
First of all Sahaja Yogi s.

521
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,340
Now Sahaja Yogis are different things.

522
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:42,230
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis will go and
take the side of the non-Sahaja Yogis and

523
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,030
try to debase the Sahaja Yogis.

524
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,210
Is a very wrong thing.

525
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:52,180
You belong to this new race and the people
who do not belong to this new race and if

526
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,260
they are attacking anybody: these are your
hands, your feet, your head, and if they attack

527
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,069
it, it is duty bound that you help them instead
of helping the others.

528
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:05,309
Maybe something wrong with this person, doesn’t
matter.

529
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:07,910
You need not show all the fair play there.

530
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:11,980
In that place you should support a Sahaja
Yogi out and out.

531
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,660
Later on you may correct and you may tell
that person, “You should not have done like

532
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,619
this, it was wrong."

533
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:23,530
So this dignity and this understanding comes
only through silence.

534
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:29,079
But if you are chirping all the time, talking
“tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,”

535
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,009
it can never, never can make you a deeper
person.

536
00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:35,579
You’ll be just flying in the air with all
that.

537
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:41,289
So for women now is best is to take to mauna,
is to keep quiet, just keep quiet.

538
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:43,160
They all the time want to talk.

539
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,940
This I’ve heard from all the leaders that
is a big problem with women.

540
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,750
They just go on talking stories, telling stories.

541
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:58,500
But if you ask them to come and speak, they
will start shaking.

542
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,500
How many can give speeches?

543
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,190
Women?

544
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:12,109
If you understand that if you cannot give
a speech, you better not talk also.

545
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,990
You should be able to give a speech because
your Mother is a woman, She gives speeches.

546
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,809
Why can’t you give some speech?

547
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,809
You cannot.

548
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,569
If I make you stand here, you’ll be shaking,
I know that.

549
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:25,089
But if it comes to murmuring souls, you are
there.

550
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:28,180
So that is one thing women have to be very
careful [about].

551
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,200
And as today is the Guru puja I have to tell
you things, not as a Mother but as your Guru.

552
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,150
That, if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

553
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,170
“Maunam sarvatha sadhanam."

554
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,400
‘Maun’ means to keep quiet.

555
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,619
It gives you all kinds of facilities, just
keep quiet.

556
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,859
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

557
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:54,880
If somebody’s trying to criticise, keep
quiet.

558
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,519
That’s your silence, that’s your right,
that’s your domain that you can keep silent.

559
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,450
Just watch that person.

560
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:08,200
If it comes then to answer, then you can answer
better.

561
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,710
But if somebody’s trying to attack ,you
just keep silent.

562
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:18,710
But this silence has to be established and
one should only establish by not talking too

563
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,710
much.

564
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:24,349
I have seen also when I am sitting here, I
have seen women talking among themselves,

565
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:25,969
and this is very wrong.

566
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:27,560
You must learn the silence.

567
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,970
Like yesterday I saw so many ladies also were
walking out, walking in.

568
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,400
In the church will you do that?

569
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,250
You won’t do it.

570
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,830
In the church there is no Christ, there’s
a horrible priest sitting there, but you cannot

571
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:40,830
do it.

572
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,549
You all keep quiet, you sit there nicely.

573
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:48,609
I’ve never seen anybody walking out here
and there and doing all kinds of things, putting

574
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:50,559
the children in front like that, making them
sleep.

575
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,559
Never!

576
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,000
Can you do that in the church?

577
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,240
What a discipline people observe in that church,
which is an artificial place.

578
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:07,869
And where you are now, that kind of a silence
has to be there and that kind of understanding,

579
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:10,319
that depth, that awe has to be there.

580
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,869
But because we have not yet developed that
Guru thing.

581
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:16,109
If we had developed it then immediately it
will work out.

582
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:20,730
You will see your gravity will show in your
behaviour.

583
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:34,630
So this is for our attention not to be wasted.

584
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,369
To discuss somebody, to discuss about others’
characters, we have no business.

585
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:40,200
Do we discuss the character of one hand to
another hand?

586
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,099
To discuss about what has happened about marriages,
things like that.

587
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:50,460
Also marriage is just…in Sahaja Yoga it’s
not such an important thing.

588
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,829
Some people pay too much attention to marriage,
you see, and marriage becomes a headache.

589
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:55,680
Also then, “What about my marriage?”

590
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,529
Then again ten minutes you see that person,
“What about my marriage?”

591
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:01,540
Again after ten minutes, “What about my
marriage?”

592
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,030
You want to run away.

593
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,940
I mean, you see, it’s something becomes
like a mania for people, “What should we

594
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,940
do?”

595
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,049
And the whole thing is, all depends, and the
whole programming depends on how you are going

596
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:14,500
to get married.

597
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:21,730
So you have come to Sahaja Yoga, you are sanyasis.

598
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,589
You are not married people in a way.

599
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:29,559
You are married only to Sahaja Yoga, that’s
your husband, that’s your wife.

600
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:33,359
And the so-called husband and wife are there.

601
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,099
But if they are not Sahaja Yogis then you
are unmarried, definitely.

602
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:41,299
So too much attention is paid in Sahaja Yoga
to marriages.

603
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:48,420
I have seen that before, marriage, before
Sahaja Yoga, marriage was a joke; every third

604
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:56,259
day there was a divorce and people would run
away and do all kinds of things.

605
00:44:56,259 --> 00:45:02,490
Then when they got married after Sahaja Yoga
they are the greatest romantic people ever

606
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,869
known in the whole world!

607
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,910
I mean, all ‘Romeo, Juliets’ going about.

608
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,280
I just don’t understand.

609
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,900
Even in the Indian villages people complain
that, “What sort of these people are?

610
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,920
I mean, they have no sense at all and the
way they go round, are they the saints?”

611
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:25,680
So that saintliness, that sanyasta, that asceticism
has to be expressed in our married life.

612
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,440
I don’t mean that you don’t have relationship
with your husband but in a very private way.

613
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,609
It’s has to be extremely private and it
should not be such a great thing to go into

614
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,609
romanticism.

615
00:45:38,609 --> 00:45:43,400
You’ll ruin the whole of Sahaja Yoga in
the West if you start doing that nonsense!

616
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:49,180
Because also there’s an idea about it that,
you see, you fall in love.

617
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,180
But then you’ll fall!

618
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,460
That’s the first point is.

619
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,160
You will fall [but] you want to rise.

620
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,690
So this attachment and this worry about the
husband and this and that, I mean, you can

621
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,440
carry on with any kind of a husband and wife
if you are a Sahaja Yogi, should be able to.

622
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,820
I mean, I know that’s very simple.

623
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,910
It’s a…your husband is a study, wife is
a study, that’s all.

624
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:12,500
You study a person, what sort of a person
he is.

625
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,849
But for that you have to have the witness
state and you have to see, you have to be

626
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:17,849
detached.

627
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:19,180
So in marriages one has to be detached.

628
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:26,319
But, on the contrary, I find that just after
the marriage they want to organise some special

629
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,849
thing for them to go to some sort of a honeymoon
or some sort of a thing!

630
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:35,633
I don’t know how these ideas crawl up.

631
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:40,160
These are coming from the old conditionings
of things and after honeymoon they come and

632
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,259
say, “Mother, this marriage is not going
to work out."

633
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:46,519
So it’s better to do slow and steady and
then decide.

634
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,099
Because you just jump into honeymoon mood
and come back and say, “Mother, this, I

635
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:54,530
have started thinking and I don’t think."

636
00:46:54,530 --> 00:47:01,060
I know of a lady who was jumping with a Indian
gentleman and she was on her way to Australia.

637
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,559
In Singapore, she telephones that, “Mother,
I don’t think this marriage will work out."

638
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:10,119
And here everybody complained to Me, “Mother,
these two are behaving in such a manner that

639
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,359
Indians are rather embarrassed."

640
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,730
So the sense of shame you must learn from
Indians.

641
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:22,630
They never… husband and wife never sit together
in India, is regarded as bad manners and it

642
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:23,970
should be with you also.

643
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:30,349
That, even in the puja, even in anything they
are sitting in the public, what is the need

644
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,279
to show your relationship in the public?

645
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:35,040
It’s only in the private.

646
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:41,119
This is one of the things one, if you start
understanding, there will be a proper adjustment.

647
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,579
Men should be with men in the public, women
should be with the women together.

648
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:56,859
But the women or men, whatever they are, whatever
are their bad, bad points should not be brought

649
00:47:56,859 --> 00:47:57,859
back.

650
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:06,230
Like, I would say the men have jealousies
and they have power orientation and they discuss

651
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:12,069
about leadership and they, every, they get
a shock if you tell them that you are not

652
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:16,280
going to be a leader, as if they think leadership
is something very concrete.

653
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,970
It’s the greatest myth ever going, is this
leadership!

654
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,580
There’s nothing like leaders in this Sahaja
Yoga, it’s just a joke.

655
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:29,230
And your Mother is very good at playing serious
jokes.

656
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,200
So be careful!

657
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,019
Don’t be childish about it.

658
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:39,900
You have to understand that this is a big
joke going on and it’s just a testing point

659
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,480
and if I test you wrong, you can tell Me,
but I think this has worked well, because

660
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,990
I can test people very well on that level
and immediately I know when the person gets

661
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,609
onto the horse of ego.

662
00:48:51,609 --> 00:49:00,400
So, for your mental attitude, has to be different
and our priorities have to change.

663
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,619
Our priorities have to change.

664
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:04,210
What are our priorities?

665
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,589
First and foremost thing is our ascent, is
the first priority.

666
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:12,009
For our ascent whatever is needed has to be
done.

667
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:14,369
If you have to punish your body, alright.

668
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,849
If you have to punish yourself, alright.

669
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:20,960
If you have a conditioning, get rid of it.

670
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,420
Just introspect yourself, that is Self-realisation,
is to know yourself.

671
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:33,240
When you know yourself and know what is clinging
onto it, just to remove it completely.

672
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,839
Work it out the way you like.

673
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:36,940
Work it out the way you like.

674
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:52,390
You see, it is very important that the body,
mind, everything should be your slaves.

675
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,069
Nothing should dominate you.

676
00:49:55,069 --> 00:49:57,249
You should be on top of everything.

677
00:49:57,249 --> 00:50:00,210
How dare your body ask for anything?

678
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,940
How dare your mind tells you anything?

679
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,280
How this conditioning works on you?

680
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,099
“I am a Sahaja Yogi, I’m above everything."

681
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:13,759
Like the lotuses have come out of the ponds,
you have come out of it.

682
00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:18,910
We have so many proofs to show that you are
realised souls.

683
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,059
I’ll show you some photographs that I have
to show that there is light.

684
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:27,410
I can put light into you, they are all enlightened
people.

685
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:31,700
But in My presence if you become the light,
you must carry the light outside.

686
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,460
Not only in My presence, but when you go out.

687
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,769
But one of the reasons, I think, when I tell
something people just start thinking about

688
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:42,289
whom Mother is talking, they never think,
“She is talking about me."

689
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:48,660
That’s the only way you can penetrate within
yourself when you see that, “Mother is talking

690
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:52,760
about me, She’s correcting me all alone
and She’s telling me."

691
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,710
Then only it will penetrate and it will work
out.

692
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:02,990
The priorities have to be changed and the
first and foremost is your ascent and the

693
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:04,480
Spirit and Sahaja Yoga.

694
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:11,700
The rest is negligible, nothing important.

695
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:21,789
Then the faith that there is this All-pervading
Power, which is looking after us, is very

696
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:22,789
important.

697
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:25,630
This time the musicians came all the way.

698
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,430
I must tell you the story of their travel.

699
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:32,960
They came and they said that there’s a train
from Kiev and they also bought the tickets

700
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,599
so got into the train and they were off-loaded
before the Hungarian border.

701
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:44,579
They didn’t know what to do, they had no
visas, nothing and not so much money also.

702
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:45,579
They thought, “We are on the train."

703
00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:50,660
They said, “No, you have to go cross over
and go to Budapest,” and they didn’t know

704
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,150
where, they were standing on the road.

705
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:58,299
And, but they were all laughing and enjoying,
“must be something in store for us."

706
00:51:58,299 --> 00:52:01,480
Nobody felt that they were in trouble or in
anything.

707
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,480
So surrendered.

708
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,470
“So, suddenly,” they said, “the custom
people came and surrounded them,” and they

709
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:10,500
said, “What’s the matter, how are you
here with all these bags and baggages?”

710
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,079
So they said, “Why are you here?”

711
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,049
They said, “We have come for a concert and
this, and musicians we are and all."

712
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:18,799
And some or other they started melting away.

713
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:20,130
And then they gave them Realisation!

714
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:22,089
Six of them got Realisation.

715
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:25,289
Now can you believe: the power of love.

716
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:30,960
And the custom officers they offered their
own cars, took them down to the other side.

717
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,269
It’s never happened with custom officers!

718
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:34,269
Imagine!

719
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:39,440
It would be like shaving their teeth off,
I tell you, the way (laughing) if you can

720
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,890
do that to the custom officer!

721
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:44,269
But it happened.

722
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:47,119
And they came to the other side and left them
there.

723
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:48,290
Now they didn’t know what to do.

724
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:53,140
They wanted to go to Budapest, they had to
walk about two miles or something to the station.

725
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:59,980
So they were waiting there well, they said
that, “Mother, You sent maybe, two Yugoslavs

726
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:04,400
came in a big bus of 49 people – all vacant."

727
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,569
They stopped the bus and said, “What is
it, why are you here?”

728
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:10,309
So they said, “This is our problem and we
have to go."

729
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:11,430
So they got into the bus.

730
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:16,380
When he was driving them down, they thought
of talking to him that, “Why not you take

731
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,810
us to Milan?”

732
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:25,000
And they managed! (laughter) And they were
in Milan.

733
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,260
It’s so remarkable.

734
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:32,630
So to have faith completely in yourself and
in that Power, which is surrounding you.

735
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:41,590
And once you have that faith you will realise
that, though it is so helpful to you, it is

736
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:49,549
so kind to you, on the same level if you think
it, it can be very harmful.

737
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:58,390
So then never listen to the Guru ninda, means
anybody talks anything ill about your Guru,

738
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:02,549
just put your hands to your ears, absolutely
immediately.

739
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:08,690
I have known of a person who did that [and]
got cancer, another now in jail, another one

740
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:09,690
there.

741
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,359
So anybody is saying like that, just put your
hands.

742
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:16,480
Because now you know that – what is your
Guru.

743
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,520
So you should never hear anything against
your Guru from anyone.

744
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,069
The other day one gentleman asked Me a question,
a newsman.

745
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:28,450
He said that, “I am told you have made a
castle for Yourself."

746
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:31,200
I said, “I have paid for it, I have made
it also.

747
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,749
It was a horrid place, no doubt.

748
00:54:32,749 --> 00:54:36,059
But there are only Sahaja Yogis staying there,
I am not staying there.

749
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:37,059
That’s the best part."

750
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:38,089
But that’s all I said.

751
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:43,089
But on the contrary, they never go and ask
these questions to any gurus on anything.

752
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:45,240
Because the disciples say, “Yes, so what?

753
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,290
We want to give to our guru money and this
and that."

754
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,290
They never ask.

755
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:54,510
But, through Sahaja Yoga, or [by] Myself,
I have cured so many people of incurable diseases

756
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,200
– I could have minted money.

757
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,339
For curing one cancer patient I could have
made a castle, Myself.

758
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:06,349
So when people say like that you should say,
“Do you know how many people She has cured?

759
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:13,549
How much money She could have taken from them
if She was a doctor or She was a false Guru?

760
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:16,380
How much money She would have made out of
all of them?”

761
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,650
Then they will understand.

762
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,609
You see, because they are being materialistic
they talk like that.

763
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:26,960
And their attitude is very different and so,
to tell them off is the best way.

764
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,670
Because I have seen that these press people
are absolutely harassed by the disciples of

765
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,739
the false Gurus.

766
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:40,220
Just they cannot criticise, they cannot say
a word against such false Gurus.

767
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:48,880
While I find that Sahaja Yogis still lack
that complete faith in themselves and complete

768
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,880
assertion.

769
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,780
Where you have to assert you must assert.

770
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:59,140
For example, anybody says something wrong
against Me, you have to assert; must say,

771
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:00,740
“No, not possible.

772
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,740
It’s not!”

773
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:06,279
But I have seen some people asking Me funny
questions who are ‘Sahaja Yogis’ also!

774
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:10,503
So the first part is that to see how much
we are sensitive to spirituality.

775
00:56:10,503 --> 00:56:18,619
I have seen Sahaja Yogis supporting somebody
who is so negative, you can’t even bear

776
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:24,410
that person and, [to them], such a person
is something great, while somebody who is

777
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,410
so good they cannot make it out.

778
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,650
So what’s the use?

779
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:32,069
Your computer is so faulty, you’ll do…I
mean, the planes will have to run up and down

780
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:35,150
if you have such a computer as Sahaja Yogis
are!

781
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,920
Because they just judge the other way round.

782
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,910
A person who is good in Sahaja Yoga, who has
got vibrations, he may be simple, he may be

783
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:47,980
unassuming, he may not be so rich, he may
not be so educated, may not be from some good

784
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:53,130
universities or anything, but you must see
the vibrations of that person!

785
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:56,410
What sort of vibrations that person has, and
then you should judge.

786
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:03,299
Instead of that if you judge that person only
because he’s very good to talk and he talks

787
00:57:03,299 --> 00:57:06,519
well and very scholarly or something like
that, that’s not the point.

788
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:07,519
The point is what are his vibrations!

789
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:14,259
And once you see those vibrations and judge
them on vibrations, then you are a Sahaja

790
00:57:14,259 --> 00:57:16,589
Yogi, otherwise I would not call you at all
a Sahaja Yogi.

791
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:18,289
But for a Guru it is very important.

792
00:57:18,289 --> 00:57:23,220
I have seen sometimes even the leaders supporting
somebody who is absolutely horrid!

793
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:27,269
I can’t bear that person even for five minutes!

794
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:33,470
But here the Guru sends him over to Me, “Oh,
Mother, he’s so good, you know, he donated

795
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:34,470
so much money."

796
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,470
It doesn’t matter.

797
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:36,950
You donated money, so what?

798
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,520
Who asked him to donate money?

799
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,829
But he should not donate his bhoots to us
now anymore!

800
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:44,950
We don’t want his bhoot!

801
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:45,950
So that’s what it is.

802
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:50,359
So the judgment should be correct about a
person when you say that this man is not good

803
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:52,029
or that is not good.

804
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:57,690
But mostly ‘gurus’ themselves are caught
up and then they are ambitious and if somebody

805
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:02,239
doesn’t listen to them or somebody wants
to give a lecture at a wrong time and somebody

806
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:05,990
says, “You shouldn’t talk like this,”
or something, then they get angry.

807
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:10,640
They are very hot tempered and they provoke
people, they say things sometimes.

808
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,720
And then when people react they say, “You
are a bad Sahaja Yogi."

809
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
That’s not the way.

810
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:23,260
First of all a guru or a leader has to be
himself a very mild, gentle, and a good person.

811
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:28,309
He has to be in such a way [that] he should
not demand anything, should not ask for anything.

812
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:29,770
Never demand anything!

813
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:35,150
Anybody who demands can not be a guru.

814
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,589
Respect is to be commanded and not to be demanded.

815
00:58:38,589 --> 00:58:47,050
And so, everything works out well if you understand
that – once you rise in your ascent, in

816
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:51,700
your wisdom, in your awareness and in your
Spirit – automatically all these things

817
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
happen!

818
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:57,380
You don’t have to ask for anything, you
don’t have to plead for anything, you don’t

819
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,859
have to complain for anything, everything
works out.

820
00:58:59,859 --> 00:59:04,160
You are looked after by all the ganas, by
all the angels.

821
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,400
They are there.

822
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,940
You are on the stage.

823
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,799
But if you are halfway then they play tricks
with you.

824
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:15,249
You see, they play tricks, they make you falter,
you have problems, you go here, you go there,

825
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:19,809
all these things happen and then you say,
“Mother, how is it this happened?”

826
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:25,300
Because they are also jokers, so they play
jokes with you and they make problems for

827
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,099
you just to make you understand that you are
doing wrong.

828
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:34,710
So we are on a stage where there’s a beautiful
security, everything is there and we have

829
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:40,890
to give to the world such a great thing like
Sahaja Yoga, which is for the emancipation

830
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:46,200
of the whole world, as you realise, and so
also I hope you realise your responsibilities.

831
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:52,279
There are so many things one has to understand,
how one has to be as a guru, how he has to

832
00:59:52,279 --> 00:59:54,640
act and how he has to work out.

833
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,009
Now I have given so many lectures on Guru
things, but, for today’s lecture, only I

834
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:08,339
have to say that, first thing, to have a guru
system, you must have complete humility.

835
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:18,130
Now, with Me, I would say, I am too simple
and I am Mahamaya, so you be very careful.

836
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:21,519
You cannot take liberties with Me.

837
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:22,790
You cannot take.

838
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:28,059
If you try to take too much liberties that
means you are not a disciple.

839
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:31,749
A disciple has to keep a distance from the
Guru.

840
01:00:31,749 --> 01:00:36,440
You cannot just take liberties, walk into
My room every time, sit there for hours together,

841
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,029
chit-chat with Me – nothing!

842
01:00:38,029 --> 01:00:40,140
You have no right.

843
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:46,411
Only when I call you, when I ask for you,
you should come.

844
01:00:46,411 --> 01:00:50,319
Then you should not force things on the Guru
that, “Please, come and listen to this,”

845
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,999
or, “Do this!” that should not be said.

846
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:58,849
For example, yesterday nobody told Me there
are going to be these music programs or everything

847
01:00:58,849 --> 01:00:59,849
arranged.

848
01:00:59,849 --> 01:01:05,609
So we have to report everything to your leader,
or to Me, all those things that you want to

849
01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:06,609
do.

850
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:07,609
And it should be really transparent.

851
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:11,680
Like this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing, and this hand knows everything

852
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,869
that this hand is doing.

853
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:15,890
In the same way everybody should know each
other.

854
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:20,519
Then the gurus should not have jealousies
for each other.

855
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:26,369
This I’m just telling you because also I
found out that there are certain jealousies.

856
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:34,140
And when they talk there is a little bit of,
“Ha, he’s good, but this, this, this."

857
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:39,700
When they enjoy each other’s company because
they have reached a certain state and they

858
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,250
understand, “This is the state we are in."

859
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:46,890
When they enjoy each other’s company fully
and appreciate each other much more than anybody

860
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:50,999
else – the guru’s company.

861
01:01:50,999 --> 01:02:00,200
All the company of the leaders, if they enjoy
each other and there’s no jealousy, there’s

862
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,809
no fight, there’s no problem but just the
enjoyment of the company, then they should

863
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:06,210
know that they have become a guru.

864
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:08,470
Now all of them never fought with each other.

865
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,470
They supported.

866
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:13,460
Actually it is one Principle was born again
and again.

867
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:19,589
But only the satanic people – they’ll
fight among themselves, not the godly.

868
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:27,420
And also they will talk against the person
who is a realised soul or who is an Incarnation,

869
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,479
but never against themselves.

870
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:34,329
It’s very surprising that the satanic people
though they fight among themselves, there

871
01:02:34,329 --> 01:02:37,819
are jealousies, they’ll never talk of each
other.

872
01:02:37,819 --> 01:02:41,310
But here I find that in Sahaja Yoga we have
freedom.

873
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:46,049
But freedom is not abandonment, is the freedom
with complete rules and regulations of the

874
01:02:46,049 --> 01:02:51,650
Divine, with us, and we have to know them
that this is the Divine Law.

875
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:57,913
So all of us are now sitting like in a big
vimana, like an aeroplane, and we all have

876
01:02:57,913 --> 01:02:59,599
to land into the beautiful area.

877
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:11,400
But first of all we have to develop that humility
in your heart; complete humility and surrender,

878
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,400
that’s very important.

879
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Unless and until you have that humility and
surrender in your heart, Guru principle can

880
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,710
not be awakened.

881
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:22,319
First you have to be the disciple and then
the guru.

882
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,370
So you have to develop that humility.

883
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:31,410
And that humility comes very easily if you
love Me, respect Me.

884
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,430
It’s not only love, but respect.

885
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:42,480
That respect has to be there and then people
will respect you.

886
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,480
May God bless you
