00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,160
Mahakali Puja
France

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,180
July 11, 1993

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,950
Today we have decided to have the Puja of
the Devi. This time we are not talking about

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:30,270
Adi Shakti, about Kundalini or about Saraswati,
Mahalakshmi. We are talking about the Mahakali.

5
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:48,510
That's the Goddess which is the first one,
which comes first and establishes Shri Ganesha

6
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,910
in the form of Gauri. She’s the complete
form of Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi. Out

7
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:36,640
of Her only these energies emit.

8
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,640
So She’s the one who is the Power of desire
of God. Within us also She creates desires.

9
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:07,890
These desires within us start emitting outside
and we develop a kind of a reaction to all

10
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:28,380
our desires. The first and foremost desire,
as you know very much, the most primitive,

11
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:38,670
is to feed yourself. And this is given to
us by the Goddess. She gives us the desire

12
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:57,410
to feed ourselves. Now if we don't feed ourselves,
then we cannot survive, we have to have food.

13
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:06,510
It is very important that we should feed ourselves
sufficiently enough to exist on this Earth.

14
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:17,730
And also we have seen that when this kind
of desire grows very much more than normal,

15
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:32,910
then you become slaves of this desire and
any amount of food cannot satisfy you. All

16
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:45,310
the time you think of nothing else but food.

17
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,310
I have told you many a times that the French
are very particular as to what they should

18
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:59,930
eat. You see, they take at least forty-five
minutes on a dinner table to decide what they

19
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,930
will eat. Ultimately, it's just the same.
I mean, I don't understand how can you need

20
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,620
forty-five minutes to decide what you want
to eat. But this desire starts acting through

21
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:24,190
your ego. So it satisfies you. And also those
people who are manufacturing food or who are

22
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:37,520
supplying food in hotels and all that know
how to satisfy your desires. So they bring

23
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,440
it in a way, show it round and then place
it before you, so that you approve of it and

24
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,440
when you approve of it then they serve. They
know how to befool you and you feel quite

25
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,600
happy, “Oh, it’s very good.” Even the
wine is given for testing first of all and,

26
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,139
whether you like it or not, you have to say,
“It's very good,” and you better show

27
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,650
that you like it.

28
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,650
So this desire gets completely controlled
by your ego and when it becomes a kind of

29
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,500
a collective desire and a collective ego expression,
then we become like gluttons, you see, I would

30
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:42,270
say sophisticated. They are sophisticated,
but we are gluttons. Now with that, other

31
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,460
things also people want to have, like proper
sort of a table lying and linen, this, that.

32
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:02,090
Of course, if ego is not there, then people
would like to see, to please others by feeding

33
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:13,940
them. This desire reacts. And then the new
desire comes in through the blessings of the

34
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Mahakali that you like to see others eating
the food. You enjoy when others eat the food

35
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:37,270
cooked by you, served by you, given by you.
Just want to watch. That gives you satisfaction.

36
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:46,699
But food, to any extent you may go, you will
never be satisfied. Today you’ll ask for

37
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,530
this, tomorrow for that. This, that.

38
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,430
Now, in the Western life today, it has become
very important to ask the child every day,

39
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:01,520
“What will you have?” In olden days the
food was cooked for all the family, everybody

40
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,080
would eat the same food. But now you must
ask the child, “What will you have?” Then

41
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,250
the child has to say, “I'll have this.”
Now, supposing you don't have that in the

42
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:18,250
fridge, you are finished. Early in the morning
there will be no shop open, nothing. How will

43
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,430
you please that boy in his ego because he
wants a particular thing, so gradually we

44
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:32,430
build up even the ego of our children. We
have to say, “This is cooked, this is nice

45
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:41,110
and you eat this.” Is the duty of parents
not to allow children to grow their ego by

46
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,110
what they want. You should know what they
have to have. Then it starts growing and growing

47
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:55,419
and growing till they become quite grown up,
but very primitive.

48
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:03,860
So, actually, the blessings of the Devi on
this point is that She gives you a desire

49
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:14,169
that you should serve others. Also you then
get concerned about people who are starving,

50
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:22,669
want to find out why they are starving. The
another extreme of this could be that some

51
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:29,900
people think we should not eat so much, a
kind of a sacrificing nonsense. Whatever one

52
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:39,769
has to eat, one should eat. Then they say,
“Why should we eat so much, Mother? After

53
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:45,959
all, there are people who are starving.”
By your eating less or more, you cannot save

54
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:52,959
those who are starving, can you? So there’s
no wisdom in this kind of austerity. And when

55
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:00,110
the people enter into this kind of austerity,
then they have sufferings and troubles and

56
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,379
such people become extremely, I should say,
ascetic and hot-tempered and you should never

57
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:14,189
go near a person who is of that kind without
a barge pole. God knows when he’ll jump

58
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:21,189
on you. So a person who is hungry is as bad
as a person who is overfed. I think hungry

59
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,290
is worse.

60
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:34,290
Now if you look at yourself, the second desire
that comes to you is that everyone should

61
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,839
love you. This comes because that makes you
good person. You know that everybody likes

62
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:59,540
goodness. So people try to be good to others,
nice to others, say a hundred times, “Thank

63
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:08,769
you,” do all kinds of things to please others.
By pleasing others, they think others will

64
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:17,939
like us very much. But then it develops again
out of bounds and then all the time you try

65
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:25,189
to please others so that you become absolutely
slavish. You become so artificial that people

66
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:34,209
can make out that it’s nothing natural is
this gentleman. He’s just trying to please

67
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,360
us.

68
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Now, with that, the pleasing behind is some
sort of an advantage out of it. If you please

69
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:56,670
another one with a detached mind, not expecting
anything that should be done for you or that

70
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,449
could be achieved through that pleasing, is
very pure pleasing and is very good. That

71
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:09,449
makes you really righteous and good. But supposing
you try to please others only just to take

72
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,519
advantage of that person, then you develop
hypocrisy – hypocrisy of the worst type.

73
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:26,249
And you get lost. People mock at you, laugh
at you. They are never pleased. They know

74
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:34,319
that you are a hypocrite and you are doing
it for some sort of an advantage or an exploitation.

75
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:40,529
You are not doing it because you want to be
good really, to be nice.

76
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:47,529
A person who is good, automatically pleases
others. But he doesn’t try to please. He’s

77
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:55,079
just – his nature is such, his temperament
is such that he just pleases people. This,

78
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:03,929
when taken over again by Mister Ego, then
really you can't beat it. Such … then they

79
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:13,660
become diplomats, you see, could be politicians,
all these doomed classes they become and they

80
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,739
cannot get out of it. They get so much used
to it, that they cannot get out of it.

81
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:26,739
Now what does the Devi do? She brings the
truth before them. She shows that what you

82
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,519
have been doing for a particular exploitation
doesn’t work out. Up to a point it does.

83
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,049
She exposes them. The exposure starts and
with that exposure, they are surprised, “How

84
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:45,049
am I exposed? How am I caught, how people
know?” This is the job of the power of Mahakali.

85
00:12:53,049 --> 00:13:00,049
She exposes all that is wrong, all that is
falsehood, that is untruth, She exposes.

86
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:10,509
Then the third desire people have is to possess
material things, from which materialism has

87
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:19,589
come. But there’s no end to it. End can
never come because they have no satisfaction

88
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,759
in getting one thing. Supposing today, “ I
want to have this carpet. All right, I'll

89
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,730
get this one.” Then I want to have another
one. Then want to have another one. Then I

90
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,489
want to have a car and then I want to have
a helicopter, then an aeroplane. I don't know

91
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:37,989
what I want to have then.

92
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:44,989
So it goes on and on and on and on until you
reach a time where people start thinking,

93
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:51,910
“What's the matter with him?” And you
cannot enjoy anything that you get. This is

94
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,869
also a human failing and this human failing
creates economics, you know that. Economics

95
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:04,839
is created because wants, in general, are
not satiable. They are not satiable. So what

96
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:11,839
happens, we go on from jumping from one to
another to another to another 
and another. So then you become slaves of

97
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:26,350
entrepreneurs, so much so, that you lose your
individuality completely.

98
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:33,350
For example, an entrepreneur produces a funny
kind of a dress, one, one year. So everybody

99
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:41,739
wants to wear the same, without thinking,
if it is necessary or not. Then he brings

100
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:50,299
in another form. Next year everything is given
up, buy the another one. Third year another

101
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,160
one. So, pile of all these clothes are there,
and nicely the manufacturer has become a great

102
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:05,910
man of designs – he’s very good designs,
how to befool human beings. He has become

103
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:12,910
a rich man and you have become poor with all
these kind of clothes which has no meaning

104
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,639
for you anymore.

105
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:22,639
About the same thing, about everything, something
is fashionable. That means you have no individuality.

106
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:31,879
We talk of individuality, but we want to do
things which everybody is doing. I mean, you

107
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:40,019
know that all kinds of absurd things people
have done in the name of fashion and specially

108
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,379
people who are not traditionally bound, who
have had no traditions like Americans, I would

109
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:51,379
say. They go on changing after every six months.
Every year you go, you find a new type of

110
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,519
people there, new type of clothes. It's very
surprising how they change so fast without

111
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:08,939
even thinking whether this will suit me or
not. Somebody says wear tight clothes, they’ll

112
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:15,939
go with tight clothes. Then they develop varicose
veins, so they wear with the holes. Then they

113
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,230
develop some other problem, then they wear
another kind. Nobody wants to think, “Why

114
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:28,230
should I change my dress?” Like, say, in
India we wear saris, finished. Nothing doing.

115
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,350
No problem with the tailor, nothing doing.
Whatever sari we like, we’ll buy. And a

116
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:43,350
sari came called as mini sari in India, which
was up to here maybe, I don't know, not six

117
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,319
inches, but at least up to the knee. It came
for about, I think, eight, seven days in Bombay

118
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:56,540
and went back. People said, “Get lost. We
don't want it.”

119
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:03,540
So this headache of all the time getting into
a fashion like herds without any sense in

120
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,520
the head has to be understood properly. Why
people do it? Because they have no brains.

121
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,280
They are brainless people. They’re not intelligent
to see that we are befooled every year. But,

122
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:34,630
for Sahaja yogis, the Mahakali power works
and She teaches them that “All right, this

123
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:41,630
dress suits you. Have this one.” And it's
the best for you. Once for all, your lifelong

124
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:52,280
problem is solved. With this kind of blouse,
I started wearing from the very beginning

125
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:59,280
perhaps and I've been wearing it and now I
find everybody wears the same style.

126
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,490
Why to waste your energy in changing every
day this blouse starting from here to here,

127
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:12,490
to here and going back again like this, you
see. Is such a waste of energy, such a waste

128
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,190
of cloth. And we make ourselves so cheap running
with this race of reducing the sleeves, reducing

129
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,190
this, reducing that – or increasing. Is
all a desire to impress people that we are

130
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,880
very up-to-date. Who wants to know? Who wants
to find out that you are up-to-date or not?

131
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,320
And we have no courage to keep to our own
dress that we have purchased. Why to waste

132
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:59,870
so much money? We never even think, go on
changing, changing, changing for nothing at

133
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:07,460
all. So this is desire is there to impress
others with our outside things. So many things

134
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:16,210
like dress there are, which we try to impress.

135
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:25,570
Now, hairstyle: I read an article. They said
that these hairstyles are responsible for

136
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:35,300
many divorces. I was wondering, “How can
it be hairstyles be responsible for divorces?”

137
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Because they had made a survey: a man had
liked a hairstyle of his fiancée and then

138
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:52,650
she changed her hairstyle, so he divorced
her. And the other way round. When it is so

139
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,440
cheap way of disposing of such a deep relationship
of husband and wife.

140
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:21,190
Now certain fads start. I also saw one documentary
about a lady who’d said that – it was

141
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,920
in the one of the advertisements, something,
sort of a thing appeared that your legs should

142
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:36,210
be of this shape and what you should do. So
poor thing spent so much time, energy, ran

143
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,300
up and down to make the legs. I mean what
is the importance of these legs, except for

144
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:46,630
walking? So, she went to make the shape like
that, you see. She used to measure it – would

145
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:53,610
be always something missing here or there.
Then many people joined. They had a class

146
00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:00,610
for it. And a group joined to make legs like
that. And, ultimately, they found out that

147
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:08,290
that leg was made out of wood. And they spent
so much money, so much energy to make legs

148
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:19,130
like that. For what? What is the purpose?
If anybody says, “You run like this,”

149
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:28,590
they start running. They say, “Jump like
this,” they start jumping. But why? Have

150
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:36,690
we gone all nuts in our heads that we should
accept whatever one says, we start doing that.

151
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,910
What is the purpose?

152
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:47,880
So this kind of stupidity comes in our heads
when we start using our ego. With the ego

153
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,880
a person becomes absolutely stupid. Because
he’ll say, “What's wrong? What's wrong

154
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:02,970
if I have just a little hair here? What's
wrong?”

155
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:13,730
“If I just try to wear a very short dress
here, what's wrong?”

156
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:27,570
The wrong is, why are you wearing? Why don't
you ask a question? Why are you wearing? If

157
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:36,630
you ask a question to yourself,” Why do
I have this kind of hairstyle? Why do I do

158
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:43,630
like this?” It is really difficult to tell
people to do right things, but wrong things

159
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:54,990
people take to like that. For example, I told
everyone that you put oil, if not every day,

160
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:03,420
just before bath, lot of oil in your head
and wash. Now I find many people getting bald.

161
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,440
But they didn't put the oil. What can I do
about it? But such a simple thing they won't

162
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:19,140
have. Such a simple thing they would not believe,
that you need something for your nourishment.

163
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,760
But they will do something which is absurd,
nonsensical without even thinking, “What

164
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:28,870
is going to harm us?”

165
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:35,770
Here the Mahakali, what does She do? She punishes
you. Your body is punished. If you wear very

166
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:50,460
tight clothes, you develop problems of your
legs. If you wear holey pants, then you get

167
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,760
cramps. Anything you do abnormal, you have
to pay for it. First you have to pay for doing

168
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:09,410
it and then you have to pay for it physically.
So many things can be avoided if we just have

169
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:19,650
a simple life, decide once for all that, “I
will have this kind of dress for this lifetime,”

170
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,640
finished. Every day to change, itself, is
a headache. But that satisfies the ego, not

171
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,790
your Self.

172
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:42,790
So the Mahalakshmi Principle in us raises
higher and higher. Despite that, we are pulled

173
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,460
down. Then this Mahakali, She comes forward
and shows what wrong we have done, how we

174
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,600
have gone wrong, how we have missed the point.
Instead of think, “What is wrong?” She

175
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,840
teaches you it is wrong.

176
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Then another thing She does, which is a very
beautiful thing She does, I think sometimes,

177
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:23,810
that She creates a illusion to test your intelligence,
to test your sensibility, She creates an illusion,

178
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:30,810
Bhranti rupena samstita. She makes a bhranti
in your head. Illusion. So you become illusive

179
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,560
or others become illusive or a situation becomes
illusive. And you are lost in it. Then you

180
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:56,820
really did understand that “It's wrong thing
I have done.”

181
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,080
It's a very nice story about Narada. Narada
was under an impression about himself and

182
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:16,870
ultimately he became ego-oriented and he started
saying, “Oh, look at me. I’m never enticed

183
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:29,110
by any woman. Even Shiva was enticed by Cupid.
I am never enticed. I am the highest, of highest,

184
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,740
brahmachari.” So Vishnu sent two gandharvas
to entice him. So they met him in a forest

185
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:55,690
and told him, “Oh, Narada, you are such
a handsome man, such a beautiful man and all

186
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,320
your beauty’s wasted. You must test your
beauty. You must see how beautiful you are.

187
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,070
You are so handsome.”

188
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,520
He said, “Really?”

189
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,370
“Yes,” she said. “There’s a very simple
way of testing.”

190
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,340
“Is how?”

191
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:30,340
She said, “There’s a wedding coming up
of a very beautiful woman. She is the princess

192
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:40,620
of the beauty … city, is called Rupadaka
– and you should go there and see how she

193
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,050
will appreciate you.”

194
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:54,050
So he, in his ego, became so stupid that he
went there. And he was sitting and lots of

195
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:06,030
people were coming, big, big maharajas, rajas,
all of them were sitting and he was thinking,

196
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:16,380
“Oh, I’m the best among all of them. Who
are these? The princess will just garland

197
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,980
me, no doubt about it.”

198
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,400
And these two were, you see, putting that
illusion into his head, bhranti. With the

199
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:48,980
Agnya, you get bhranti. This princess came
round. She looked at him and she laughed aloud.

200
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:00,940
She couldn't control herself and she moved
on giggling. Couldn't understand why she laughed

201
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:11,410
at him. She didn’t garland him or nothing
but she just laughed. So couldn’t understand,

202
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,850
“I’m such a handsome man,” this thing.

203
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:27,850
So these two gandharvas told him, “Oh, doesn’t
matter. You see, she doesn’t understand.

204
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,580
She'll come back,” this, that. Then they
went out and near a lake and he sat down to

205
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:42,580
wash his face and looked at in the water his
reflection. He, looked like a monkey. He looked

206
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,830
at these two and he cursed them.

207
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:56,230
He said, “I look like a monkey.”

208
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:02,540
Said, “To us, you look like very handsome.”

209
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:09,540
“But I really look like a monkey.”

210
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:19,630
So this bhranti, this illusion was created
in his mind by his ego. But this power, itself,

211
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:25,100
Mahakali’s power, She puts this ego right
by creating illusion, bhranti. And this is

212
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:32,100
responsible for many illusions we run after.
It’s a mirage, running after it, running

213
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:40,020
after it. Once we are satisfied within ourselves,
then we don't run after mirages. This illusion,

214
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,760
if it is not created, people would be so egoistical
that whole world will be finished.

215
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,620
So this is the great work of Mahakali Power
within us, that She creates illusions. Many

216
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:53,870
people talk of maya. “This is, Mother, maya.
This is maya. That is maya.” Is the work

217
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:53,870
of Mahakali. She wants to test you. She wants
to test you. But in Sahaja Yoga it's not such

218
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:53,870
a strong one.

219
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,429
For example, you know Abraham had a son. One
son He had after a long time. And God asked

220
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:56,270
Him that He should sacrifice his son. His
wife said, “ I also was feeling terrible

221
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:56,530
that He has to sacrifice His son.” So He
went down to the place where the child was

222
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:56,790
to be sacrificed. He made a fire, everything
and He was about to put the child on that

223
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,150
pyre of fire when the voice came, “This
is Mahakali, that you don’t have to sacrifice

224
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,400
your child.”

225
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,160
We have many such stories in Indian mythology
also where they were tested. So to test Sahaja

226
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,450
yogis also, this Mahakali helps you. There
was a gentleman who was very egoistical, so

227
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,740
I told him to come to Delhi because I didn’t
know how to do it here. Came to Delhi and

228
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,650
he told everybody, “See, Mother told me
to come here just to cure Her.”

229
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:09,960
I said, “All right. Come along.”

230
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,210
He came.

231
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,220
I said, “What’s wrong with Me?”

232
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,679
He said, “Mother, Your Nabhi is very bad.”

233
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,470
I said, “Really? You put a bandhan to yourself
and now see for yourself.”

234
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:13,720
“Oh my God, what’s happening to me here?”

235
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:13,800
I said, “That’s My Nabhi.”

236
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,130
So this is how the illusion corrects you.
If there is no illusion, you would not ever

237
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,140
be corrected directly. Supposing I say, “Don't
do this.” You may not like. Of course, mostly

238
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,929
you like, but sometimes you don't. And then
the illusion works and then you realize, “Where

239
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:19,160
was I and where am I now? I should not have
done this. How is it I have landed into this

240
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:26,160
problem? What has made me so stupid?” So
this is something which She does.

241
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:36,820
Another is She's the one who relaxes you completely.
When you are tired and fed up, when you don't

242
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:46,870
know what to do, then She makes you sleep.
She’s the one who gives you sleep. All day's

243
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,200
work you do, ultimately the Mahakali power
acts on you as sleep. She makes you sleep,

244
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:07,210
sleep like a child. You know, at that time,
all that wrong we have done to ourselves and

245
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:15,179
to others are forgiven. In Her lap we sleep
nicely, quietly and all our problems are solved.

246
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:28,190
In those dreams, when you are, She brings
forth solutions to you. I know so many people

247
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,450
told Me, “Mother, you came in my dream and
told me that this is the medicine you should

248
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:43,450
take.” “You came in my dream and You told
me that this particular type of life will

249
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,200
suit you.” They see Me clearly coming, but
there it is not whole of Me, but I think the

250
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,740
Mahakali Power acts. Into very deep sleep
you are, it is called, as the sushupti. There

251
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,150
She appears.

252
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:04,150
One lady came to Me and she said, “Mother,
You came in my dream and you said that “I’m

253
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,599
here in Bombay.” Nobody told me.

254
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:17,599
So, so many things happen like this. In the
dream She guides you and tells you. Now what

255
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:27,589
happens sometimes, people tell Me that I had
such and such dream, which is all falsehood,

256
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,759
I know. They never dreamt like that. They
never saw like this. But, just to impress

257
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:40,759
Me, they tell Me that “Oh, I had a dream,”
this, that. I just show complete ignorance,

258
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:48,690
“Ya, must be.” Then they are put into
again bhranti, means illusion. Gradually,

259
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:55,690
they realize that it was wrong to tell lies
to Mother. So the correction part takes place.

260
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:07,039
But the greatest thing that She does is to
give you the sense of chastity and security.

261
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:21,170
When the children are born, they have sense
of chastity, shame, decency, decorous behavior.

262
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:29,809
But gradually, when they start others misbehaving,
they start misbehaving. To them, decency becomes

263
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:38,349
a bondage. But, naturally, She's there to
tell you that “This is indecent. You shouldn't

264
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:46,309
do it. This is wrong. This is not the proper
thing to do." But gradually, you grow up and

265
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:56,579
mature, then you go, “What’s wrong?”
You start disrespecting your chastity and

266
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:09,460
you start becoming like immature, stupid people.

267
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:16,460
All this, if is understood through meditation,
the Mahakali helps you a lot. In meditation,

268
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,599
She helps you a lot because She's the one
who creates the proper passage for kundalini

269
00:36:31,049 --> 00:36:38,049
to rise. Mahakali is the same as the kundalini
because She is the residual energy of Mahakali

270
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:46,190
Power, full of it there. But the function
is different. The function of Mahakali is

271
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:55,980
to protect you, is to guide you, to give you
wisdom. And the function of the kundalini

272
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:05,359
is to cleanse you, to clear it out, not to
play about with you, to forgive you and help

273
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,180
you to grow properly.

274
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Now in your life, as Sahaja yogis, you will
see how Mahakali helps you in every way. It

275
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:25,160
is so interesting to watch Her work, how She
brings forth all kinds of satisfactions to

276
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:34,759
you. The greed goes away. The temptations
go away. The temper goes away. All these things

277
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:41,970
disappear. The most helpful thing She does,
that you get rid of your bad habits. Absolutely.

278
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:51,980
Automatically, in the light of Mahakali's
power, you just do not want anything destructive

279
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,480
to be practiced. If you have been practicing
anything destructive, you try to get rid of

280
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:09,400
it. Just you stop it. “I don’t want to
have it.” I never tell you, “Don’t do

281
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,079
this. Don’t do that.”

282
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:17,539
It's the Mahakali power within you which is
awakened, does all these things. And She has

283
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:24,140
made you so beautiful, so angelic. She has,
by Her corrections and by Her illusions, She

284
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:31,140
has made you like this so you don't get so
much attached to money, to greed, to lust,

285
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:47,809
all these things which are responsible for
putting you down; also possessiveness for

286
00:38:47,809 --> 00:38:52,329
children, possessiveness for husband, possessiveness
of matter. You just start understanding that

287
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:59,329
the joy is in sharing. You want to share everything
with others and that sharing starts when this

288
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:08,499
Mahakali Powers start giving you blessings
of joy, of sharing, of being collective, of

289
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:24,019
being pure. These blessings come to you from
the Mahakali Power.

290
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,420
So today we are going to worship that Mahakali
Power.

291
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,609
May God bless you!
