WEBVTT

00:15.613 --> 00:18.378
Now of course, it is also true, the second
point

00:18.579 --> 00:22.279
is that in Sahaja Yoga you have to become.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.735
You cannot just say that, “All right,
I have become a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:25.936 --> 00:28.689
No, you cannot. Nor can you say,
“I am following Shri Mataji;”

00:28.890 --> 00:31.616
that also cannot be said. Nor you can
say that,

00:31.817 --> 00:34.391
“All right, we have an organization,”
or something like that,

00:34.592 --> 00:37.531
or, “I’m wearing this just because She is
my guru.” You can’t say that.

00:37.732 --> 00:41.002
You have to become. You have to become
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:41.203 --> 00:45.761
If you have to become a Sahaja Yogi,
then it has to be worked out

00:45.923 --> 00:48.706
and that takes time.

00:48.907 --> 00:54.875
To rise from Nirvichara to Nirvikalp
it takes time.

00:55.076 --> 00:58.783
For some people it takes more time.
For some people it takes less time.

00:58.984 --> 01:02.784
Depends on the preparation of a person.
Also I would say,

01:02.985 --> 01:06.906
previous lives, good deeds and this
life’s understanding,

01:07.107 --> 01:11.314
so many things are there. So it takes time.

01:11.514 --> 01:17.517
But at least one can talk about it
so the atmosphere is created.

01:17.718 --> 01:22.531
You can talk to people, tell them that,
“We have found the truth

01:22.732 --> 01:27.461
and it’s very simple. You can’t pay for it.
It just works.

01:27.662 --> 01:32.562
It’s spontaneous. It’s a living process.
It’s a evolutionary process.”

01:32.763 --> 01:38.780
You can talk like that. Not about Me, but
about Sahaja Yoga, in an abstract manner.

01:38.981 --> 01:42.859
“And it’s such a wonderful thing,
one should do it.”

01:43.060 --> 01:46.180
All such talks are going to help us a lot

01:46.381 --> 01:52.173
though I would say, those who listen to you
may not get Realization,

01:52.374 --> 01:56.578
but at least in the atmosphere it will be.
And that is going to help us a lot.

01:56.779 --> 02:01.845
If it is in the atmosphere, people know
that there’s something like this coming up.

02:02.046 --> 02:07.845
For you people, of course, you have to work
hard and you have to become Sahaja Yogis.

02:08.046 --> 02:13.659
Becoming is a little bit difficult task
sometimes

02:13.860 --> 02:18.950
because there is this great Mr. Ego or may
be certain conditionings, you see,

02:19.151 --> 02:27.572
that people can’t give up, and that they
find it difficult to get out.

02:27.773 --> 02:31.652
But if you know how to raise your
Kundalini, She will manage it.

02:31.853 --> 02:35.514
She knows how to do it and She will give
you that status.

02:35.715 --> 02:39.892
But first and foremost thing is to meditate
and to raise your Kundalini.

02:40.093 --> 02:44.407
Meditation is the only way you can grow.
There’s no other way out.

02:44.608 --> 02:49.992
Because when you meditate you are in
silence, you are in thoughtless awareness.

02:50.193 --> 02:54.828
Then the growth of awareness takes place,
then it opens out.

02:55.029 --> 02:58.129
But if you are thinking - supposing
there is a lake

02:58.330 --> 03:02.583
and the lake is completely in a turmoil.
Nothing can grow.

03:02.784 --> 03:07.884
But supposing it is silent, then lotuses
can grow, anything can grow in it.

03:08.085 --> 03:12.668
In the same way, if your mind is agitated
and your growth

03:12.869 --> 03:19.254
is not yet fully expressing
itself,

03:19.455 --> 03:25.497
then it’s such a vicious circle that
you are agitated

03:25.698 --> 03:30.348
and your growth is hindered, again you
are agitated, your growth is hindered.

03:30.549 --> 03:34.328
So the best way is to take to meditation.

03:34.513 --> 03:39.873
When you take to meditation this turmoil
will settle down.

03:40.074 --> 03:43.322
And when it will settle down, your growth
will take place.

03:43.523 --> 03:47.423
After meditation you’ll feel definitely
that you have come out very well,

03:47.624 --> 03:51.879
you have grown very well. But for that
one has to be very honest.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.255
You cannot force people to be honest.
That’s one thing you can’t do.

03:55.442 --> 03:58.767
You have to be honest yourself. You are
not to be hypocrite.

03:58.968 --> 04:01.308
You have to see for yourself that whatever
you are doing

04:01.509 --> 04:04.708
is for your benevolence, is for your good,

04:04.909 --> 04:09.189
and that you have to do it because it is
good for you, to begin with.

04:09.390 --> 04:14.530
And then for the good of the humanity.
You are doing for the good of the humanity.

04:14.731 --> 04:18.384
Now some people who come for the first
time will have lots of doubts

04:18.585 --> 04:21.672
because of ego. They have lots of doubts
because of ego.

04:21.873 --> 04:28.432
“How can that be? How can this be? How?”
I mean all kinds of things they ask.

04:28.633 --> 04:33.440
Now, you have to say that first of all
you develop your insight.

04:33.641 --> 04:37.483
You develop your enlightenment. Your light
is not sufficient.

04:37.684 --> 04:42.352
In the light only there are no doubts.
Supposing in darkness

04:42.553 --> 04:46.327
you think that this table has no cover.

04:46.528 --> 04:49.353
Is all right. You can think whatever
you like, but when there is light

04:49.554 --> 04:53.556
you see for yourself there is a beautiful
cover on top of this table.

04:53.757 --> 04:59.887
In the same way, it happens to us that
we have to achieve a state.

05:00.096 --> 05:04.870
And once we achieve that state then
there’s no question,

05:05.071 --> 05:08.922
there’s no doubt, there’s nothing, and you
become so empowered.

05:09.123 --> 05:15.657
It is such a simultaneous thing. It works.
As soon as you achieve something, it works.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.917
When it works, then you are convinced.

05:19.125 --> 05:25.170
It’s a, I’d say, is a very beautiful new
chain starts within yourself

05:25.371 --> 05:31.107
and then you really starts enjoying
your joy of your Self.

05:31.397 --> 05:34.493
Now it is for your gain you have come
to Sahaja Yoga,

05:34.678 --> 05:38.362
not for anybody else’s gain. First of all
your gain.

05:38.563 --> 05:42.055
And once you gain something, then you
can only help others

05:42.255 --> 05:47.130
to do something about it. So it is
important to understand

05:47.331 --> 05:52.056
the first rule of Sahaja Yoga is that you
look at yourself.

05:52.257 --> 05:59.570
How are you? Are you really progressing?

05:59.771 --> 06:04.213
Or you are worried about other thing,
like your business, this that?

06:04.414 --> 06:09.990
Or you are worried about your ascent?
What are you worried about?

06:10.191 --> 06:12.746
Are you worried about your ascent?

06:12.931 --> 06:16.290
If you are worried about your ascent,
what are you doing about it?

06:16.491 --> 06:21.811
That has to be the main object of life.
The rest of the things follow it.

06:22.012 --> 06:27.843
Once you ascend, the whole cosmos can
look after your problems,

06:28.035 --> 06:32.298
but you must ascend into the kingdom
of God; that’s the main point is.

06:32.499 --> 06:40.537
So first of all you have to ascertain
about yourself. Am I ascending?

06:40.753 --> 06:46.750
Am I transforming? Am I giving up all
my bad habits?

06:46.951 --> 06:49.687
Am I getting rid of my temper?

06:49.888 --> 06:54.295
Am I getting peaceful? Am I now sweet?

06:54.496 --> 07:01.918
Or am I now still the same horrible
criticizer of others?

07:02.119 --> 07:06.566
Just put your attention to yourself and see
for yourself. It’s like a mirror;

07:06.767 --> 07:10.611
you start seeing yourself in the mirror,
what’s wrong with you.

07:10.812 --> 07:13.360
And then you try to correct it.

07:13.561 --> 07:17.809
Now second point is that you must see
your vibrations,

07:18.010 --> 07:23.219
what centers you are catching yourself. For
that you have to give yourself a bandhan.

07:23.420 --> 07:27.318
You give yourself a bandhan and see for
yourself what’s wrong with you.

07:27.519 --> 07:31.433
When you give yourself a bandhan you will
know about your chakras,

07:31.602 --> 07:33.251
and you’ll be amazed.

07:33.623 --> 07:36.251
So that is how first pay attention
to yourself.

07:36.452 --> 07:40.996
You find out what’s wrong with you. Some
of you might be having terrible ego.

07:41.197 --> 07:44.108
Then may be you might be having a very
bad Agnya chakra.

07:44.309 --> 07:47.477
Then you should find out, have you got
Agnya chakra? This is ego.

07:47.678 --> 07:51.641
Then there’s a very good remedy in Sahaja
Yoga, which may look ridiculous

07:51.842 --> 07:54.347
but it’s very good remedy is to beat
yourselves with shoes,

07:54.555 --> 08:01.096
as they know is the beating with the shoes
is called as a shoe treatment.

08:03.495 --> 08:06.240
Now, then you have to go further.

08:06.441 --> 08:10.279
See you find yourself that your right side
is hot.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.701
What you do is put your right side
towards the photograph

08:13.902 --> 08:20.265
and the left side up towards the ether.
The ether takes away the heat.

08:20.466 --> 08:25.721
But what actually happens is that your
right side gets the vibration

08:25.922 --> 08:31.552
and the heat is pushed towards your left
and passes out into the ether.

08:31.753 --> 08:36.201
Now this heat comes from too much
futuristic living.

08:36.402 --> 08:40.029
Those people who are too much futuristic,
they have too much heat.

08:40.230 --> 08:45.036
And too much heat has to go away, and when
this heat starts going away

08:45.237 --> 08:48.348
then you are amazed how it works.

08:48.549 --> 08:50.583
For that there are various things we have
to use,

08:50.784 --> 08:55.802
but mainly for right-sided people they
should not use any light at all.

08:56.003 --> 08:59.904
They should not sit in the sun. They should
sit in the moonlight.

09:00.105 --> 09:04.685
They should read some poetry. They should
not tie up watches.

09:04.886 --> 09:12.271
They should not look at time. They should
allow the time to pass,

09:12.472 --> 09:16.247
and they should just become very,
sort of emotional people.

09:16.448 --> 09:20.269
They should sing songs of bhakti.
They should not do Hatha Yoga.

09:20.470 --> 09:24.907
There are so many things they should not
do if they are right sided.

09:25.203 --> 09:29.207
You will be surprised how people have been
helped through this kind

09:29.408 --> 09:34.231
of a treatment, which treats one side
of your being.

09:34.432 --> 09:43.685
On the left hand side people are the people
as you know are the ones who are docile,

09:43.886 --> 09:47.149
who bear up lots of things from others
and cry and weep

09:47.350 --> 09:53.900
and all the time are on the losers end.

09:54.536 --> 09:59.557
Such people have problems also because
all their organs are lethargic

09:59.758 --> 10:03.292
and they have problems of a lethargic
heart,

10:03.493 --> 10:09.763
lethargic liver, lethargic intestines.
Everything becomes very lethargic.

10:09.972 --> 10:13.518
All these left side things can be cured.

10:13.719 --> 10:16.340
Plus they might have some sort of a badha
in them,

10:16.541 --> 10:18.681
in the sense they are possessed by someone.

10:18.882 --> 10:21.851
Of course, some of them are possessed
by right side also.

10:22.052 --> 10:24.196
Not that only the left side is possessed.

10:24.397 --> 10:26.729
But from the right side also they are
possessed.

10:26.930 --> 10:31.887
And left sided possessions are
of a peculiar type,

10:32.088 --> 10:35.966
because they give you pain in the body.
You get pains in the body.

10:36.167 --> 10:40.616
Right sided person doesn’t get any pain
himself. He gives pain to others.

10:40.817 --> 10:44.645
He is very sarcastic, he is very
aggressive, he troubles others,

10:44.846 --> 10:47.838
but the left sided people have pains
themselves.

10:48.039 --> 10:50.744
They get a pain here and a pain there
and pain here.

10:50.945 --> 10:54.677
So left side has to be cleared, as you know
very well through the light.

10:54.878 --> 10:57.771
Light is put before the photograph,
left hand towards the photograph,

10:57.972 --> 11:00.686
right hand on the Mother Earth.

11:00.887 --> 11:05.230
So the left hand gets the light and
the light passes through

11:05.431 --> 11:09.434
and the negativity of the left side passes
to the right hand,

11:09.635 --> 11:11.799
and the right hand is on the Mother Earth.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.736
The Mother Earth is the one who sucks in
all these

11:15.937 --> 11:20.412
negative forces of the left hand side.
So these are the two sides which we clear.

11:20.613 --> 11:24.034
But once you have cleared these two sides
then you can use the photograph.

11:24.235 --> 11:26.522
Sit with your both the hands towards
the photograph

11:26.723 --> 11:31.065
and put both the feet in the water,
little bit of salt in it

11:31.266 --> 11:37.223
and about five ten minutes you must allow
the vibrations to clear you out.

11:37.424 --> 11:42.455
Then wipe your feet. Put the water properly
into some disposal

11:42.656 --> 11:46.185
and then sit down for meditation.

11:46.512 --> 11:51.841
If you can do that everyday, even ten
minutes, is more than sufficient.

11:52.066 --> 11:55.726
Don’t have to do anything in an extreme
manner.

11:55.927 --> 11:59.938
In the morning time, you have to give
yourself a bandhan when you are going out.

12:00.139 --> 12:02.807
Don’t go out without giving a bandhan.

12:02.986 --> 12:07.009
And attention should be all the time
inside,

12:07.210 --> 12:10.226
in the sense that, walking on the road
people have habit

12:10.427 --> 12:14.541
of seeing this, seeing that, seeing like
that. The attention gets frittered away.

12:14.742 --> 12:18.101
What you should see is you should see about
three feet or four feet at the most

12:18.302 --> 12:22.310
from the ground and not above. Because you
can see all the beautiful children,

12:22.511 --> 12:27.075
flowers everything. There is nothing
very beautiful above that.

12:27.276 --> 12:30.057
So better is to see only up three four feet

12:30.258 --> 12:35.440
if possible, to fix your attention, so
the attention becomes concentrated.

12:35.641 --> 12:41.587
And you feel very relaxed and relieved
of too much of wobbling of your eyes.

12:41.788 --> 12:45.084
Eyes are very important. Very important,

12:45.285 --> 12:49.763
and as you will notice, because you are
all realized souls, that your eyes now

12:49.964 --> 12:53.282
have got a glint, a kind of a light
in the eye.

12:53.483 --> 12:56.375
And that light shows that you are
realized souls.

12:56.747 --> 13:01.668
So best thing is that you should,

13:05.401 --> 13:12.824
you should try to put your attention
within yourself

13:13.025 --> 13:16.805
to see for yourself how far you have come,

13:17.006 --> 13:22.692
through your vibrations, know yourself,
what is required in you.

13:22.893 --> 13:27.236
First and foremost thing, the light has
to be clean.

13:27.437 --> 13:31.848
Then see how far you can reach your light,

13:32.049 --> 13:38.721
how far you can increase your dimension
how far you can go with others.

13:38.922 --> 13:46.120
I hope this little, small little
explanation about your meditation

13:46.321 --> 13:52.962
and your method of rising and ascending
will help you to grow further.

13:53.163 --> 13:56.985
But I don’t mind if you have any questions,
I would like to answer them.

13:57.186 --> 14:02.003
May God bless you all. May God bless you.
May God bless you.

14:03.447 --> 14:07.996
Question: Shri Mataji, through meditation
and through using the fire

14:08.197 --> 14:14.239
we try to be in thoughtless awareness
and we try to control our thinking.

14:14.440 --> 14:18.707
But many times, what happens to me
is though I meditate,

14:18.908 --> 14:21.823
thoughts come into my head.

14:22.024 --> 14:25.927
They just come all of a sudden and I know
they are not part of me.

14:26.128 --> 14:32.118
Is there a method to control these thoughts
so we can meditate?

14:35.196 --> 14:40.553
Shri Mataji: See, you must raise your
Kundalini. Try to raise it.

14:40.754 --> 14:45.039
Put your attention to your Sahastrara.
Say, “Mother come in my head.”

14:45.240 --> 14:49.308
As soon as Kundalini crosses the Agnya
you cannot have those thoughts.

14:49.509 --> 14:55.317
You should allow this simple method also,

14:55.518 --> 15:00.497
that if you see any thought coming in,
you should say, “I forgive”.

15:00.698 --> 15:06.199
I forgive is a very big mantra. Say that,
thought will stop.

15:08.245 --> 15:13.539
Question: Shri Mataji, this week we were
talking about a similar experience

15:13.740 --> 15:17.099
that many of us have when we listen
to Your lectures,

15:17.300 --> 15:20.593
mostly when we listen to the tapes
or watch the videos.

15:20.794 --> 15:25.001
And if it happens to be those times when
we are fortunate enough not to be

15:25.202 --> 15:28.956
to the left or to the right, but to be
as centered as we can be,

15:29.157 --> 15:32.496
and we are listening attentively
to everything You say,

15:32.697 --> 15:37.867
why is it that sometimes, right afterwards,
someone would ask something about the tape

15:38.068 --> 15:42.046
and often we can’t remember consciously
a word of what we heard?

15:42.247 --> 15:45.481
It wasn’t that we were off thinking or that
we were, You know, sick,

15:45.690 --> 15:48.565
we were listening attentively, but then
afterwards,

15:48.766 --> 15:53.087
You know, it’s not a conscious thing that
we can recall or speak about.

15:53.288 --> 15:57.935
We were talking about that this week.
Shri Mataji: What happens? What happens?

15:58.136 --> 16:01.017
Lady: That after listening to one of Your
tapes

16:01.218 --> 16:04.061
sometimes we can’t remember what You
have said,

16:04.262 --> 16:06.770
even if it’s not one of those times

16:06.971 --> 16:10.266
when we are to the left or to the right.
We seem to be relatively…

16:10.467 --> 16:17.550
Shri Mataji: But it has an effect,
all right. It has an effect.

16:17.751 --> 16:21.541
But after that I think you all should go
into meditation for a while.

16:21.742 --> 16:25.838
After listening to My lecture you just go
into My meditation.

16:26.039 --> 16:29.160
Actually, My lectures are not to be
understood by your brains

16:29.361 --> 16:33.029
but through your Kundalini, and through
your heart.

16:33.230 --> 16:36.286
So it doesn’t matter if you don’t remember
something. It’s all right.

16:36.487 --> 16:38.662
It’s so many lectures I have given.
How can you remember?

16:38.863 --> 16:42.331
I also don’t remember much of it.

16:44.786 --> 16:49.188
But it will come handy whenever you want
to use some words or sentence

16:49.389 --> 16:53.146
it will come handy. You’ll not know from
where it is coming.

16:53.347 --> 16:56.058
It’s all recorded.

16:58.853 --> 17:01.845
It’s all recorded.
