00:00.198 --> 00:10.566
I am very happy to see so many people here
to know about Sahaja Yoga in all its details.

00:10.591 --> 00:17.710
But in this short time, what can you be told?

00:18.606 --> 00:30.342
That firstly you got your realization, you
felt the cool breeze all right, and that it

00:30.367 --> 00:31.953
was an experience.

00:32.629 --> 00:37.409
But beyond this experience you have to settle
down.

00:37.409 --> 00:46.749
It is very, very important that you must have
desire to settle down.

00:46.749 --> 00:53.178
You don’t know the importance of your personality.

00:53.178 --> 01:00.809
You are the one who’ll save this world.

01:00.809 --> 01:15.009
Because the salvation of the whole world is
not possible with Myself; and you people who

01:15.009 --> 01:23.918
will be really developed, it will be such
a force.

01:23.918 --> 01:34.215
I told about England yesterday, another thing
is that England is the heart of the universe,

01:34.215 --> 01:35.429
I think.

01:35.429 --> 01:43.259
Everything circulates from here, whatever
happens small or big, it circulates.

01:43.259 --> 01:54.819
It is not that only England has many newspapers
or television centers but somehow it circulates

01:54.819 --> 01:56.698
everywhere.

01:56.698 --> 02:00.369
I used to think only in India, it’s not
so.

02:00.369 --> 02:08.139
I’ve seen everywhere, every country, there's
news about England.

02:08.139 --> 02:14.739
Even in America, even in South America, I
was surprised how people are worried about

02:14.739 --> 02:21.519
England so much that they want to know what’s
happening in England.

02:21.519 --> 02:31.759
My own experience is this, that they get so
upset with the things that upset your country,

02:31.759 --> 02:46.169
not only that but anything that happens of
a very small importance is noted down and

02:46.169 --> 02:52.459
they always tell Me, “Mother, we have seen
in the newspaper, we have seen in the television.”

02:52.459 --> 03:00.019
America is such a vast country and also the
newspapers are vast, and their television

03:00.019 --> 03:05.689
is impossible to gauge anything out of it.

03:05.689 --> 03:06.689
Horrible.

03:06.689 --> 03:11.739
What they say also language wise, we are not
so good for American language.

03:11.739 --> 03:18.739
So, they’re little exclusive people, I think
their idea is to be exclusive.

03:18.739 --> 03:32.559
For example, if they produce anything electrical,
it has to have 110 watt, while normally people

03:32.559 --> 03:35.671
have 220, so nobody can buy their electrical
productions.

03:35.671 --> 03:42.309
Now they have started a small production of
that.

03:42.309 --> 03:47.909
They try to be exclusive, while I think England
is not like that, it’s not exclusive, it’s

03:47.909 --> 03:49.549
not only keeping all its things to itself.

03:49.549 --> 04:01.969
This is something, a very great quality that
England has.

04:01.969 --> 04:07.689
It has many other qualities, as I told you
yesterday, there has to be self-esteem.

04:07.689 --> 04:14.178
One quality is that they never go to extremes.

04:14.178 --> 04:21.089
I mean we had some hippies, we had little
bit of this and that, but they don’t go

04:21.089 --> 04:22.089
to extremes.

04:22.089 --> 04:31.839
But in America or any other country, if something
starts it really blasts the whole atmosphere.

04:31.839 --> 04:43.989
This balancing in England is something really
very surprising.

04:43.989 --> 04:50.109
Also they are disciplined people, they have
their own discipline, and with their discipline,

04:50.109 --> 05:00.719
they… like people who are disciplined, who
are very much in time, properly dressed for

05:00.719 --> 05:08.619
the occasion and I’m not trying to just
praise you, but this is My observation.

05:08.619 --> 05:14.309
And in this observation I find, once Sahaja
Yoga settles down in England, it will spread

05:14.309 --> 05:15.689
all over the world.

05:15.689 --> 05:19.209
Then I don’t have to run about in every
country.

05:19.209 --> 05:27.299
That’s very important, that it should settle
down here, that is you should all understand

05:27.299 --> 05:32.439
the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

05:32.439 --> 05:42.918
When I first came to London, My husband had
a job and I started My work with seven people,

05:42.918 --> 05:47.888
out of them I think five were hippies.

05:47.888 --> 05:57.219
But immediately they got rid of their drugs,
alcohols and all that.

05:57.219 --> 05:58.249
Immediately.

05:58.249 --> 06:00.728
Next day they were different people.

06:00.728 --> 06:07.869
But how to prove, how to tell, was a problem.

06:07.869 --> 06:12.459
They improved so much, unbelievable.

06:12.459 --> 06:17.819
And I felt very close to them that they are
the people who have achieved it in such a

06:17.819 --> 06:18.959
short time.

06:18.959 --> 06:24.529
For which, I think otherwise I have to work
very hard for others.

06:24.529 --> 06:30.828
They became hippies because of some sort of
a fashion maybe?

06:30.828 --> 06:33.519
But English don’t take to fashions so much.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.519
I don’t know why.

06:35.519 --> 06:42.499
Why they had become hippies, and they were
very well educated, all were professors, this,

06:42.499 --> 06:43.499
that.

06:43.499 --> 06:50.329
And they said that we have taken to this hippiedom
because we wanted to experiment as to what

06:50.329 --> 06:51.739
it is.

06:51.739 --> 07:00.019
I said “You can’t experiment with a snake,
that ‘let the snake bite us and then we’ll

07:00.019 --> 07:01.019
experiment.’

07:01.019 --> 07:06.108
Once it bites you, you are finished.”

07:06.108 --> 07:15.469
All these things have been always, kept Me
attached to London and I have been here for

07:15.469 --> 07:19.019
twenty years continuously.

07:19.019 --> 07:27.209
But the work that we did, I don’t know why
it did not reach intellectuals, and newspaper

07:27.209 --> 07:34.918
people, while all other stupid people who
came here were so much enamored, and were

07:34.918 --> 07:45.578
given so much prominence, everybody was talking
about them.

07:45.578 --> 07:51.358
So that’s how the London is based about
Sahaja Yoga.

07:51.358 --> 07:57.599
It is a spontaneous happening within, a spontaneous.

07:57.599 --> 08:05.289
Yesterday you saw, I didn’t do anything,
it just worked spontaneously, because it is

08:05.289 --> 08:09.379
there and it has to be awakened, that’s
all.

08:09.379 --> 08:17.139
But I know also people who have been cured,
have been completely cured of very difficult

08:17.139 --> 08:19.809
diseases with Sahaja Yoga.

08:19.809 --> 08:27.209
It’s a fact, it’s not just I’m boasting
about it, but it’s a fact.

08:27.209 --> 08:29.969
It’s a very powerful thing within us.

08:29.969 --> 08:40.419
This power of Kundalini is extremely, extremely
kind, loving, affectionate and effective.

08:40.419 --> 08:49.819
As I said it’s your Mother, and when it
acts, it works so well, it works so well.

08:49.819 --> 09:00.849
It is impossible to avoid Kundalini awakening
once it has been awakened.

09:00.849 --> 09:08.709
But I know some people who have been able
to defy it, maybe because of basically they

09:08.709 --> 09:17.609
were cheats or immoral or some sort of people,
but they were very, very few.

09:17.609 --> 09:26.148
Mostly I have seen people have grown to great
heights with Sahaja Yoga.

09:26.148 --> 09:33.789
Today I want to tell you a special thing about
Sahaja Yoga.

09:33.789 --> 09:49.392
That in Sahaja Yoga, slowly, slowly you’ll
find, most of your problems, most of your,

09:49.733 --> 09:58.958
I should say enemies, as in Sanskrit they
are called shadripus, all these will just

09:58.958 --> 09:59.958
disappear.

09:59.958 --> 10:05.395
You’ll be amazed, how they are just disappearing.

10:05.420 --> 10:16.559
Jealousy, anger, racism, all kinds of stupid
things that are lingering, of which you may

10:16.559 --> 10:20.889
not be even aware, just drop out.

10:20.889 --> 10:28.879
And you feel such love and such affection
for everyone who comes across.

10:28.879 --> 10:34.648
You try to give them Sahaja Yoga, you try
to tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

10:34.648 --> 10:36.819
They may like it, they may not like it.

10:36.819 --> 10:46.729
English are little conservative, so that conservatism
has gone a little bit sometimes, too much.

10:46.729 --> 10:50.338
There’s no harm in talking about Sahaja
Yoga.

10:50.338 --> 10:58.329
I have seen people who have gurus, of the
worst type, worst type.

10:58.329 --> 11:01.159
One lady was sitting next to Me…

11:01.159 --> 11:04.719
It’s quite warm today?

11:04.719 --> 11:10.049
They told Me it’s very cold.

11:10.049 --> 11:12.719
That’s England [laughs].

11:12.719 --> 11:16.278
It’s cold or hot.

11:47.286 --> 11:51.507
The climate is whimsical, agreed.

11:51.507 --> 12:00.137
Very whimsical, if you are going out, say,
we were living in Oxsted, 25 miles away, and

12:00.137 --> 12:08.466
when I started from there it was, surprisingly,
it was absolutely clear sky.

12:08.466 --> 12:17.786
And by the time I reached Victoria station,
it was pouring cats and dogs as you say.

12:17.786 --> 12:20.567
Horrible, I couldn’t understand.

12:20.567 --> 12:23.427
Or vice versa.

12:23.427 --> 12:32.377
So the climate is whimsical, but that makes
you prepared for every kind of climate, every

12:32.377 --> 12:35.757
kind of incident.

12:35.757 --> 12:41.127
And you understand, that that is what is the
nature.

12:41.127 --> 12:48.377
We shouldn’t fight with the nature, but
we shouldn’t expect everything to be absolutely

12:48.377 --> 12:52.547
first class when we are going out.

12:52.547 --> 13:01.476
So this kind of taking risk has made you people
very courageous, I must say.

13:01.476 --> 13:02.476
Courageous.

13:02.476 --> 13:07.346
And this courage is to be used now in Sahaja
Yoga.

13:07.346 --> 13:11.457
You have to use this for spreading Sahaja
Yoga.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.799
This is your mission.

13:12.799 --> 13:13.987
This is what you’ll enjoy.

13:13.987 --> 13:19.536
You’ll be amazed, the more you spread, the
higher you’ll go.

13:19.536 --> 13:27.427
You’ll develop much more, much more powers
within you, and unlimited powers.

13:27.427 --> 13:36.357
As far as miracles are concerned, I’m just
- don’t know how to explain them.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.457
Such miracles take place.

13:38.457 --> 13:48.027
We had a lady from America, she was staying
with us and she had some sort of a funny disease,

13:48.027 --> 13:55.517
that all her intestines and stomach were all
entangled with some sort of a growth.

13:55.517 --> 13:57.667
And she had it before also.

13:57.667 --> 14:01.677
So she had an operation and they took out
everything.

14:01.677 --> 14:04.447
Again she came to Cabella, and she was staying
there.

14:04.447 --> 14:07.657
Again she developed the same problems, the
same symptoms.

14:07.657 --> 14:10.267
She was quite worried.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.997
So they said, “All right, we’ll take you
to the hospital.”

14:12.997 --> 14:19.737
She said, “No, let me first meditate,”
and with meditation, you’ll be amazed, when

14:19.737 --> 14:22.867
she went to the hospital, the doctor said
“There is nothing, you’re absolutely clear.

14:22.867 --> 14:26.887
You are cleared out.”

14:26.887 --> 14:30.557
This meditation can help you in so many ways.

14:30.557 --> 14:40.147
It’s not a meditation of some sort of a
chanting, or some sort of a going into, as

14:40.147 --> 14:44.887
they said you’ll fly in the air or all those
things, no.

14:44.887 --> 14:50.987
It just is meditation by which you enter within
yourself.

14:50.987 --> 14:54.557
Your Kundalini works out with this meditation.

14:54.557 --> 14:59.367
She looks after your illness, she looks after
about your curing.

14:59.367 --> 15:02.656
All kinds of things she looks after.

15:02.656 --> 15:08.257
Even the traffic you know, you’ll be surprised,
it works in so many ways.

15:08.257 --> 15:16.757
It is so miraculous, you will find all the
time as if you are helped by some people,

15:16.757 --> 15:20.067
some angels are there who are helping you.

15:20.067 --> 15:24.087
You’ll be amazed at yourself, when it starts
working out.

15:24.087 --> 15:30.797
So, instead of doubting, you keep watching
what’s happening, how it works out.

15:30.797 --> 15:37.357
So many things work out in such a beautiful
manner, that you are amazed, as if you have

15:37.357 --> 15:39.257
entered into the kingdom of God.

15:39.257 --> 15:41.427
Which you have.

15:41.427 --> 15:48.827
All the possible help, all the possible solutions,
just come like that.

15:48.827 --> 15:55.966
I’ve seen one fellow who had some case on
him, and he told Me, “Mother, I have this

15:55.966 --> 15:59.067
case, and this and that.”

15:59.067 --> 16:02.937
I said, “All right, you meditate,” and
when he went to the court, they said that

16:02.937 --> 16:06.396
you’re already solved, that thing is solved
already.

16:06.396 --> 16:10.197
He was amazed, “How is it solved?

16:10.197 --> 16:13.857
I never even went to the court.”

16:13.857 --> 16:20.537
Then he went to the lawyer, and the lawyer
said, “Yes, they have solved, but I don’t

16:20.537 --> 16:23.417
know how, because I didn’t go to the court.

16:23.417 --> 16:27.467
I was sitting with Mataji, I didn’t go to
the court.

16:27.467 --> 16:33.216
But your problem is solved, because when I
went to the court next day, they said it’s

16:33.216 --> 16:34.216
all done.”

16:34.216 --> 16:36.976
“But who was arguing the case?”

16:36.976 --> 16:38.396
“They said you.”

16:38.396 --> 16:39.396
“I?

16:39.396 --> 16:43.427
I was not arguing, so who was arguing the
case?”

16:43.427 --> 16:50.357
“There was, and even you see, the remark
of the magistrate is this, that you argued

16:50.357 --> 16:51.406
very well.”

16:51.406 --> 16:57.567
It’s a fact, I’m not telling you stories,
it’s a fact, it happened.

16:57.567 --> 17:00.716
He said, “Mother, did you go to argue the
case?”

17:00.716 --> 17:14.127
I said, “I am very bad at that, I do not
know how to argue.”

17:14.127 --> 17:19.346
But such wonderful things have happened, I
mean, you won’t believe, unbelievable things

17:19.346 --> 17:20.346
happen.

17:20.346 --> 17:23.096
And, it is just to be seen.

17:23.096 --> 17:28.097
As I told you yesterday, you have to be in
the witness state.

17:28.097 --> 17:35.006
Don’t you think that there’s anything
less or more with anybody.

17:35.006 --> 17:37.917
You are all there and are looked after.

17:37.917 --> 17:40.677
But have faith in yourself is the main point.

17:40.677 --> 17:44.246
If you don’t have faith in yourself, it
doesn’t work.

17:44.246 --> 17:45.457
Just have faith in yourself.

17:45.457 --> 17:48.577
I’m not telling you just tall stories, I
tell you.

17:48.577 --> 17:54.967
It is the fact, I Myself I’m amazed how
things work out.

17:54.967 --> 17:59.847
I’ll tell you about Dr Spiro, one day what
happened, interesting.

17:59.847 --> 18:08.477
You see, I had told the boys not to go in
the sun - in Indian sun, you know?- after

18:08.477 --> 18:09.947
10 o’clock.

18:09.947 --> 18:15.837
But they wanted, I don’t know, to burn their
skin or whatever they wanted to do.

18:15.837 --> 18:25.746
Five, six boys were there, and when they came
away, they had all blisters all over in their

18:25.746 --> 18:26.746
hands.

18:26.746 --> 18:30.990
So he said, they have to be given tetanus,
that has to be done and all that.

18:31.178 --> 18:35.522
I said, “Don’t worry, it can be solved.”

18:36.417 --> 18:48.867
I just took some water and a little cotton
wool and put it on them.

18:48.892 --> 18:56.407
And I was, as I was taking it down, it all
disappeared, it was all disappearing.

18:56.407 --> 19:02.697
But I told them, that in the evening, go and
sit in the sea so your heat is taken out.

19:02.697 --> 19:04.506
I think they didn’t do it.

19:04.506 --> 19:08.067
I sent them My saris to cover themselves.

19:08.067 --> 19:13.756
I said, “Take these saris, cover yourselves,
sleep with them.”

19:13.756 --> 19:17.817
After that, I went to My brother’s place
in Aurangabad.

19:17.817 --> 19:22.357
He was the judge of the high court there.

19:22.357 --> 19:30.347
I went there and My brother came and he said,
“What has happened to Your saris?”

19:30.347 --> 19:31.427
I said, “Why?”

19:31.427 --> 19:35.217
“See how many big, big holes there are.”

19:35.217 --> 19:36.366
And I said “How do you know?”

19:36.366 --> 19:40.277
He said, “These girls went to take out Your
sari for Your bath and there are big, big

19:40.277 --> 19:41.577
holes all over.”

19:41.577 --> 19:43.517
All the saris had those holes.

19:43.517 --> 19:46.077
So he said, “How will You manage?”

19:46.077 --> 19:49.736
I said, “I’ll manage with one sari, it
doesn’t matter.”

19:49.736 --> 19:53.787
But, I just remember these boys, the amount
of heat they had.

19:53.787 --> 19:56.607
They burnt the saris so badly.

19:56.607 --> 20:00.667
But they were not aware of their heat, that
was inside.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.677
Though they were cured, the heat was inside.

20:03.677 --> 20:10.647
Like this, there are many, many things that
have happened, and I don’t know how to explain

20:10.647 --> 20:14.297
to you all these miracles.

20:14.297 --> 20:21.857
Now, why do these miracles are there?

20:21.857 --> 20:24.617
Why there is these miraculous photographs?

20:24.617 --> 20:25.887
You must have seen them.

20:25.887 --> 20:27.996
To convince people.

20:27.996 --> 20:31.447
They were never convinced you see.

20:31.447 --> 20:34.697
Christ came, He crucified Himself.

20:34.697 --> 20:38.147
Nobody was convinced that He was divine.

20:38.147 --> 20:49.577
The problem is, human mind is so stuck up
that they cannot accept anybody as divine.

20:49.577 --> 20:53.937
And at this time, in modern times, when there
are so many false gurus, all kinds of things

20:53.937 --> 21:03.097
going on, I think it was necessary for them
to produce these miraculous photographs.

21:03.097 --> 21:07.517
Actually, I don’t do anything, to be very
frank, I don’t do.

21:07.517 --> 21:11.657
It’s all done by this all-pervading Power.

21:11.657 --> 21:23.067
I was once in Brisbane in Australia and I
was sleeping, daytime, so one girl saw a beautiful

21:23.067 --> 21:27.907
rainbow and she wanted to take a picture.

21:27.907 --> 21:34.967
She took a picture of the rainbow, but can
you imagine a painting I love very much of

21:34.967 --> 21:40.037
Raphael, of the Mother and the Child, I like
it very much.

21:40.037 --> 21:43.887
And she sees that thing on the photograph.

21:43.887 --> 21:53.887
And the circular light that Raphaello has
shown was on top of Her head.

21:53.887 --> 21:58.496
I thought Raphaello himself has painted or
what has happened?

21:58.496 --> 22:00.397
I couldn’t believe Myself.

22:00.397 --> 22:07.417
Like this, so many things, so many things,
you can see one by one, some are they have

22:07.417 --> 22:09.407
collected, some are not.

22:09.407 --> 22:17.287
Recently we had a program in Bombay where
we get at least 2 lakhs of people, that means

22:17.287 --> 22:31.027
200 000 people and they were all preparing,
arranging the stage, and in the photograph,

22:31.027 --> 22:33.907
I’m already there.

22:33.907 --> 22:36.307
And with Me is Ganesha sitting.

22:36.307 --> 22:43.087
Even Shri Ganesha’s actual body, actual
face was there in one of the other pictures.

22:43.087 --> 22:48.006
I myself start wondering what is all going
on.

22:48.006 --> 22:53.767
This is the work of Paramachaitanya, which
is trying to convince people who cannot be

22:53.767 --> 22:54.837
easily convinced.

22:54.837 --> 23:01.837
It’s trying to make people understand that
this is divine, this is Divinity.

23:01.837 --> 23:05.866
They never believed in Christ, they never
believed in anyone.

23:05.866 --> 23:13.047
All kinds of things they have said about Christ,
all sorts of things they have tried to talk

23:13.047 --> 23:14.637
about Krishna, Rama.

23:14.637 --> 23:18.626
But, still there are very few people who really
believe in them.

23:18.626 --> 23:22.366
They think it’s a myth.

23:22.366 --> 23:25.787
But all these myths become real.

23:25.787 --> 23:34.597
You’ll be amazed how you will change.

23:34.597 --> 23:40.577
You’ll start looking so much younger first
of all.

23:40.577 --> 23:45.499
Myself, you know, I’m very good at recognizing
people, but some people I could not recognize.

23:45.499 --> 23:48.537
I said “Are you the same?”

23:48.537 --> 23:49.537
“Yes.”

23:49.537 --> 23:53.967
So transformed, the whole face changes, looking
so much different.

23:53.967 --> 23:59.907
One fellow was bald, he’s got all the hair
on his head.

23:59.907 --> 24:01.567
And what did he do?

24:01.567 --> 24:05.236
He said, “No, Mother, I just raised my Kundalini,
that’s all.”

24:05.236 --> 24:06.567
“You didn’t do anything?”

24:06.567 --> 24:08.567
“No, no, I didn’t do anything.”

24:08.567 --> 24:15.236
And he had become so bald, so much bald headed,
that in the passport, his photograph was there,

24:15.236 --> 24:21.207
and when the passport fellow saw him he said,
“You?”

24:21.207 --> 24:28.437
Because he was bald-headed at that time, but
he had hair before, but now, his hair has

24:28.437 --> 24:29.587
come back.

24:29.587 --> 24:33.247
Unbelievable things have happened.

24:33.247 --> 24:34.807
Unbelievable.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.357
And all this is for you.

24:37.357 --> 24:39.557
You’re in for it.

24:39.557 --> 24:43.226
You can have many, many miracles.

24:43.226 --> 24:52.708
My, another name is also Daisy, because My
mother was very fond of a teacher, her name

24:52.708 --> 24:56.717
was Daisy, apart from this, she gave Me the
name of Daisy.

24:56.717 --> 25:02.807
Now, when I came to England, I found daisies
everywhere, but they had no fragrance, no

25:02.807 --> 25:03.807
fragrance.

25:03.807 --> 25:09.047
We don’t get daisies in India, you will
be surprised.

25:09.047 --> 25:10.937
But then, they got fragrance.

25:10.937 --> 25:13.927
All daisies got fragrance, very surprising.

25:13.927 --> 25:24.217
They never had fragrance and they started
smelling very well, in a very beautiful manner.

25:24.217 --> 25:26.587
So it works also in the nature somehow.

25:26.587 --> 25:32.907
I mean, that nature should know My name is
Daisy, that this - it’s remarkable.

25:32.907 --> 25:36.417
There’s no end to it.

25:36.417 --> 25:44.787
So many angels and so many divine vibrations
are working it out.

25:44.787 --> 25:50.517
So I have to first tell you that you must
have faith in yourself, very important, and

25:50.517 --> 25:51.517
you must meditate.

25:51.517 --> 25:56.927
Once you start meditating, you’ll become
masters of Sahaja Yoga.

25:56.927 --> 26:04.767
For this, color is no bar, religion no bar,
race no bar, nothing.

26:04.767 --> 26:15.017
As long as you are a human being and you have
got your realization, you can really go very

26:15.017 --> 26:16.177
far.

26:16.177 --> 26:21.847
So many miracles have happened to Sahaja Yogis,
so many miracles.

26:21.847 --> 26:27.547
And I was surprised, even when they write
to Me, they say Mother, nobody will believe,

26:27.547 --> 26:30.427
but this is what has happened to us.

26:30.427 --> 26:35.777
So, I would request you to have faith in yourself
and do meditation.

26:35.777 --> 26:37.917
Very important.

26:37.917 --> 26:42.347
Then the growth within, you’ll be amazed.

26:42.347 --> 26:48.127
I have seen people who never wrote any single
line are great poets.

26:48.127 --> 26:54.447
Those who could not stand on the dais to speak
have become great orators.

26:54.447 --> 26:57.787
So many people have achieved so much.

26:57.787 --> 27:04.857
But I just told them, don’t talk about it,
if you talk about it they’ll think we are

27:04.857 --> 27:06.687
telling some sort of a story.

27:06.687 --> 27:07.687
It’s a fact.

27:07.687 --> 27:15.527
Now you also find out in your own life, the
experience of all these changes that take

27:15.527 --> 27:16.527
place.

27:16.527 --> 27:17.547
How the relationships change.

27:17.547 --> 27:24.006
There was one fellow in America, very rich
man, and he told Me, “I don’t know what

27:24.006 --> 27:25.047
You did to me.”

27:25.047 --> 27:26.537
I said, “What happened?”

27:26.537 --> 27:32.427
“See, I hated my cousin, I really hated
him, but the other day I saw him and I felt

27:32.427 --> 27:34.335
like hugging him.

27:34.360 --> 27:40.543
And I kissed him so he started looking at
me, what’s gone wrong with me?”

27:40.568 --> 27:48.436
You see, like, you change so enjoy now, you
enjoy the collectivity.

27:48.461 --> 27:54.546
Now in India we have a seminar of Sahaja Yogis.

27:55.058 --> 27:59.845
You see we have people from all over the world.

27:59.870 --> 28:06.957
We have from Brazil, from Argentina, say from
England, also Spain, everywhere.

28:06.982 --> 28:10.058
Russia, such a lot from Russia.

28:10.083 --> 28:17.275
And when they meet, I’ve never heard anybody
quarrelling or hitting or anything.

28:17.981 --> 28:25.068
They are in thousands, last time we had ten
thousand, but I’ve never seen anybody - but

28:25.093 --> 28:27.563
such understanding and love.

28:27.563 --> 28:35.363
Of course, they pull each other’s legs,
that’s true, as friends, but on the whole

28:35.363 --> 28:40.433
there’s never a fight, never a quarrel.

28:40.433 --> 28:44.452
Can you imagine if this thing happened to
the whole world?

28:44.452 --> 28:52.763
All these wars that they have started, all
this kind of problems they have created in

28:52.763 --> 29:00.522
the name of God, in the name of land, or whatever
it is, will be finished.

29:00.522 --> 29:07.293
This should happen, this should happen to
the whole world, and I want this world to

29:07.293 --> 29:12.753
be a very happy and a beautiful place.

29:12.753 --> 29:14.833
And I’m sure you all can achieve it.

29:14.833 --> 29:19.623
Because of you, the vibrations will spread.

29:19.623 --> 29:26.103
Vibrations of love, vibrations of compassion.

29:26.103 --> 29:33.793
We have also a great idea of having compassion
for the people who are suffering.

29:33.793 --> 29:38.243
So I’ve started a hospital which is very
successful, and we don’t have to charge

29:38.243 --> 29:43.503
anything except for what they have to pay
for their food and stay.

29:43.503 --> 29:45.523
And it’s working wonders.

29:45.523 --> 29:47.442
What has happened?

29:47.442 --> 29:51.423
What has happened, how is it working like
that?

29:51.423 --> 29:55.303
It is nothing but sheer divine power.

29:55.303 --> 30:03.802
We have another hospital now we are starting
in Delhi, and also destitute women, and it’s

30:03.802 --> 30:06.822
surprising how things work out.

30:06.822 --> 30:10.513
There was a lady who came and complained about
her husband.

30:10.513 --> 30:14.593
That he has been very unkind to her and this
and that.

30:14.593 --> 30:19.723
I said “All right, once we have destitute
women’s home you come there.”

30:19.723 --> 30:25.033
Amazing, the husband came next day and she
tells Me, “Mother, he’s became a very

30:25.033 --> 30:26.113
nice man now.

30:26.113 --> 30:30.370
He’s become very nice.”

30:30.759 --> 30:31.734
“Really?”

30:31.759 --> 30:36.981
He didn’t come to meditation, he didn’t
get his realization, how has he become so

30:37.006 --> 30:38.006
nice?

30:38.174 --> 30:40.944
How suddenly he has become so nice to his
wife?

30:40.944 --> 30:46.105
It’s really unbelievable how it acts.

30:46.397 --> 30:52.633
I tell you, we don’t know, this all-pervading
power is the power of love.

30:52.666 --> 30:55.794
God is Truth, but Truth is Love.

30:55.794 --> 31:05.212
Love not biased, love not because there is
some sort of a gain or some relationship,

31:05.386 --> 31:07.981
but love which is just love.

31:08.006 --> 31:12.393
The ocean of love, and you’ll just start
enjoying that ocean.

31:12.615 --> 31:17.807
I have seen it Myself happening and you also
should see.

31:17.958 --> 31:22.885
Whenever is possible please come to Cabella
at least, is in Italy.

31:22.910 --> 31:24.831
There you can see.

31:24.856 --> 31:29.964
And we have nothing but a hangar, and they
didn’t want Me to build anything for them.

31:29.964 --> 31:32.856
I said in the hangar how do you live?

31:32.881 --> 31:35.397
“That’s the best Mother, we want to live
in the camp.

31:35.422 --> 31:37.049
We don’t want to live in rooms.

31:37.074 --> 31:38.831
We have had enough of it.”

31:38.982 --> 31:53.293
Imagine, Russians, Americans, all of them
in such beautiful enjoyment.

31:54.128 --> 31:57.258
I tell you, we have to enjoy life.

31:57.258 --> 32:03.357
God has not created us to weep and cry, but
to enjoy.

32:03.588 --> 32:10.438
It’s good for you, it’s good for your
children, good for your family, good for your

32:10.463 --> 32:13.025
nation and for the whole world.

32:13.073 --> 32:18.610
As I told you that you are important because
from England everything circulates, circulates,

32:18.635 --> 32:19.825
circulates.

32:19.889 --> 32:25.828
So, how important you are in Sahaja Yoga I’m
just trying to tell you.

32:25.828 --> 32:29.599
Very important and you can do a lot.

32:29.599 --> 32:34.828
One person went to Russia and now we have
thousands of Russian Sahaja Yogis.

32:34.828 --> 32:43.259
Thousands of them, they are so dedicated,
so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

32:43.259 --> 32:54.710
Once I was in Moscow when this coup took place
and big problem was there.

32:54.735 --> 33:00.715
So I asked the Sahaja Yogis, “Aren’t you
worried about this coup that has taken place?”

33:00.715 --> 33:02.057
“Which coup, Mother?”

33:02.082 --> 33:04.724
I said, “Which you had in Moscow.“

33:04.749 --> 33:08.731
“Mother, we don’t live in Moscow, we live
in the Kingdom of God.”

33:08.756 --> 33:11.040
Just imagine.

33:13.843 --> 33:23.013
So when you face reality you are enamored,
you are just filled with joy, because reality

33:23.013 --> 33:24.353
is joy.

33:24.353 --> 33:28.432
Today’s function, I have never attended
before like this.

33:28.432 --> 33:34.033
But they said “Mother, You should come”
so I’ve tried to make it, but I would like

33:34.033 --> 33:35.763
you to ask Me questions now.

33:35.763 --> 33:40.850
It’s very important, if you have any doubts,
please ask, or if you have anything to say,

33:40.875 --> 33:42.586
please ask.

33:42.611 --> 33:43.853
Thank you.

34:05.064 --> 34:08.954
Q. Shri Mataji, what do you think of Buddhism?

34:08.954 --> 34:13.875
A. Now see, Buddhism is very different from
Buddha.

34:13.875 --> 34:14.875
Absolutely.

34:14.875 --> 34:19.625
Buddha first got his realization.

34:19.625 --> 34:23.325
First he became a Buddha and then he started
Buddha religion.

34:23.333 --> 34:26.426
But the way people are doing Buddhism is the
other way round.

34:26.451 --> 34:32.980
That you give up your wife, you give up your
children, you give up even your dress, everything.

34:33.005 --> 34:34.824
To whom?

34:34.849 --> 34:37.580
To these people.

34:38.720 --> 34:42.650
Buddha started after his realization.

34:42.650 --> 34:51.500
After your realization only you can become
Buddha, means a realized soul.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.770
And he said it the same way.

34:54.770 --> 35:04.040
He said Buddham Sharanam Gachami, I surrender
myself to other realized souls, Buddham Sharanam

35:04.040 --> 35:05.090
Gachami.

35:05.090 --> 35:13.630
Then he said Sangham Sharanam Gachami, Dharmam
Sharanam Gachami, I surrender myself to the

35:13.630 --> 35:19.839
religion which is within me, innate religion.

35:19.839 --> 35:33.110
And thirdly he says, Sangham Sharanam Gachami,
I surrender myself to the collective.

35:33.110 --> 35:42.810
This nonsense of giving up this, giving up
that, I mean, it’s too much.

35:42.810 --> 35:46.770
If you are holding onto something then you
can give up.

35:46.770 --> 35:52.970
If you are not holding onto anything then
what are you going to give up?

35:52.970 --> 35:59.821
Simple thing like that, for example, in Canada,
one fellow came wearing that Buddhist’s

35:59.846 --> 36:00.846
dress.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.308
I don’t like it.

36:04.308 --> 36:07.931
A Sahaja Yogi said “You’d better go and
change, Mother will not give you realization

36:07.956 --> 36:11.478
if you are wearing this dress.”

36:11.890 --> 36:17.185
So he came to Me and, “Mother, please forgive
me, I have no other dress left.”

36:17.210 --> 36:18.614
I said, “Why?”

36:18.906 --> 36:20.596
“I have lost everything.”

36:20.621 --> 36:21.621
He was a big business man.

36:21.621 --> 36:26.791
“I’ve lost everything, I’ve given away
to the Buddhists and I’m left with two pair

36:26.791 --> 36:31.313
of these clothes and if you don’t give me
realization, what will I do?”

36:31.629 --> 36:32.865
“Really?”

36:32.890 --> 36:33.890
“Yes.”

36:36.111 --> 36:41.976
So, what is there to give up is the point,
what is there to give up?

36:42.001 --> 36:46.863
If you are not holding onto anything what
are you going to give up?

36:47.697 --> 36:49.927
Simple thing like that.

36:49.927 --> 36:53.322
Buddha never gave up his clothes, nothing
of the kind.

36:53.449 --> 36:57.988
But he wanted to find out, what is the truth.

36:58.013 --> 37:04.894
So he went round, I mean he tried his level
best and everything, ultimately his Kundalini

37:04.894 --> 37:06.852
rose and he got the realization.

37:06.877 --> 37:13.047
But what he was doing there, he was just lying
down under a banyan tree.

37:14.103 --> 37:18.311
Now, whatever mistakes he has committed, we
need not do, that you give up your wife, you

37:18.336 --> 37:22.174
give up your child, give up this, give up
that.

37:22.174 --> 37:30.534
Just the
contrast of what really Buddha achieved, is

37:30.534 --> 37:34.280
the contrast of that.

37:34.305 --> 37:46.895
So Buddhism is not Buddha by any chance.

37:51.777 --> 37:58.376
Q. The gentleman wants to know what happens
after we die, Mother?

37:58.401 --> 38:00.790
A. Now, that’s another point.

38:00.815 --> 38:05.465
Everybody worried about what will happen if
we die.

38:05.490 --> 38:12.078
I would say that, as a Sahaja Yogi, you should
not worry about the future because it doesn’t

38:12.103 --> 38:13.103
exist.

38:13.128 --> 38:15.928
You shouldn’t worry about your past because
it’s finished.

38:16.155 --> 38:20.005
You should be in the presence which is the
reality.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.824
Present is the reality.

38:23.110 --> 38:27.065
What’s the use if I tell you what will happen,
you’ll become a bird or anything, are you

38:27.065 --> 38:30.125
going to believe Me?

38:30.125 --> 38:35.185
You shouldn’t.

38:37.025 --> 38:53.065
Q. Could you tell us about angels Shri Mataji?

38:58.794 --> 39:03.395
A. They are very beautiful, just like flowers,
very fragrant.

39:03.395 --> 39:11.155
And they will help you; you’ll be amazed
how they’ll help you.

39:11.155 --> 39:15.685
You won’t see them, you don’t see them.

39:15.685 --> 39:28.915
But they are there, in the form of some human
being - in so many ways.

39:28.915 --> 39:33.655
So you cannot describe them because you can’t
see them.

39:33.655 --> 39:40.612
But you’ll see their help, and you’ll
be amazed how they guide you to the right

39:40.637 --> 39:41.637
path.

39:41.733 --> 39:48.230
Now, supposing you lose your way somewhere,
don’t get frustrated, don’t get upset

39:48.255 --> 39:49.665
about it.

39:49.665 --> 39:54.025
If you have lost your way it must be some
purpose.

39:54.025 --> 39:59.985
On that way when you go you’ll find somebody
whom you have been looking for ages, or maybe

39:59.985 --> 40:02.005
some sort of a thing you’ll find, some treasure
you’ll find.

40:02.005 --> 40:07.355
So, if you have lost your way, there’s nothing
to worry.

40:07.355 --> 40:13.295
They work very smoothly and sweetly.

40:13.295 --> 40:29.405
Q. She’s asking how you begin to meditate,
Shri Mataji.

40:29.405 --> 40:33.735
A. That of course they will tell you.

40:33.735 --> 40:38.975
There’s a photograph of Mine, first you
have to work on that.

40:38.975 --> 40:45.085
Afterwards you will know that how it works,
but first you have to use My photograph, I

40:45.085 --> 40:50.241
don’t know what to do because the photograph
has the vibrations.

40:50.312 --> 40:54.460
You can test it, you’ll get tremendous vibrations
from the photograph.

40:54.485 --> 41:01.065
It’s a kind, as we can call, a figure, which
emits vibrations.

41:01.065 --> 41:04.285
I do not gain anything by that, but you will
gain.

41:04.285 --> 41:10.465
You will gain, so you have to sit down and
meditate before the photograph.

41:10.465 --> 41:14.465
It’s full of vibrations.

41:14.465 --> 41:22.995
It’s so effective I tell you, that when
you put these photographs of Mine all over

41:22.995 --> 41:32.605
London, it works.

41:32.605 --> 41:45.005
Q. Is prayer the same as meditation?

41:45.005 --> 41:52.905
A. See, before you are connected to the Divine,
what is your prayer?

41:52.905 --> 41:54.145
It’s nothing.

41:54.145 --> 41:59.205
If you telephone without the connection, what
is it?

41:59.205 --> 42:03.585
So after realization, the prayer very much
helps.

42:03.585 --> 42:12.685
But meditation is inner, prayer is outside.

42:12.685 --> 42:15.355
For your inner growth, meditation is necessary.

42:15.355 --> 42:22.605
You don’t have to spend too much time, say
about in the evening before sleeping, if you

42:22.605 --> 42:34.825
can do it for about say ten minutes, or maybe
five minutes in the morning, that’s very

42:34.825 --> 42:36.845
good.

42:36.845 --> 42:58.875
Q. Sahaja Yoga is available to everybody,
is it even available to politicians, Mother?

42:58.875 --> 43:12.335
A. I mean, you know, you’ll be surprised,
in India so many politicians have come to

43:12.335 --> 43:13.465
Sahaja Yoga.

43:13.465 --> 43:14.595
In India.

43:14.595 --> 43:18.554
But I don’t know about English politicians.

43:18.554 --> 43:28.945
I have met some, but they are so much involved
into their own positions and things.

43:28.945 --> 43:43.054
So far none of them, but if you can grab some
people it’s a good idea.

43:43.054 --> 44:02.635
Q. The gentleman asks for your personal blessing
Shri Mataji, he wants your personal blessing.

44:02.635 --> 44:08.335
A. May God bless you, may God bless you.

44:08.335 --> 44:12.625
It is for everyone.

44:12.625 --> 44:16.925
It’s for everyone.

44:16.925 --> 44:23.615
Q. What is the difference between the soul
and the spirit.

44:23.615 --> 44:27.125
A. The soul and the spirit?

44:27.125 --> 44:34.615
It’s a subject should be dealt later on
but little in short I’ll tell you.

44:34.615 --> 44:44.785
The soul is the essence, essence of the five
elements.

44:44.785 --> 44:45.825
Essence.

44:45.825 --> 44:58.085
For example, for Mother Earth, the essence
is fragrance, so all these five elements have

44:58.085 --> 45:04.945
essence, and this essence contains the soul
in the sense that the soul is the reflection

45:04.945 --> 45:09.635
of God Almighty within us.

45:09.635 --> 45:20.575
So the body is that of the five elements,
the essence of the five elements and theSpirit

45:20.575 --> 45:30.866
is the one which is reflected on it, that
is the reflection of God Almighty.

45:30.891 --> 45:42.761
But later on you’ll know much more.

45:49.465 --> 46:00.145
Q. Mother he wants to know if You still meditate
Yourself?

46:00.145 --> 46:03.352
A. I am in meditation all the time.

46:03.377 --> 46:53.455
(A gentleman starts to speak for a very long
time, Shri Mataji says “It’s a big lecture.”)

46:53.455 --> 47:23.264
Q. He wants to know, there are different meditations
he says, and he’s confused, Mother.

47:23.264 --> 47:39.905
A. Meditation cannot be different, it has
to be one, and the one that makes you deep

47:39.905 --> 47:43.425
is the meditation.

47:43.425 --> 47:50.775
All kinds of meditation, there was one meditation
they had started here by which you will start

47:50.775 --> 47:54.655
moving three feet higher than normal.

47:54.655 --> 48:01.725
Now think of it, already we have traffic jams.

48:01.725 --> 48:08.965
You can find the stupidity in all of them.

48:08.965 --> 48:15.635
If you use your intelligence, you’ll find
out, because you don’t grow.

48:15.635 --> 48:20.475
Meditation that is good is the one by which
you grow.

48:20.475 --> 48:24.735
Everything is not the food.

48:24.735 --> 48:41.615
The food that you can eat is the food.

48:41.615 --> 48:51.505
Q. What do you think about Islam Mother?

48:51.505 --> 48:54.128
A. Islam is great, no doubt.

48:54.153 --> 48:56.462
But nobody follows Islam.

48:56.487 --> 49:00.485
Nobody follows, nobody has read even Koran.

49:00.485 --> 49:01.625
You’ll be amazed.

49:01.625 --> 49:06.575
They are fighting without understanding what
Islam has written.

49:06.575 --> 49:14.261
Mohammed Sahib was one of the incarnations
of the real Gurus, but Muslims, stupid as

49:14.286 --> 49:16.266
they are, they don’t follow.

49:16.291 --> 49:20.759
They don’t follow the exact sayings of Koran.

49:20.784 --> 49:27.645
Now in Koran is written, that at the time
of resurrection your hands will speak.

49:27.670 --> 49:28.670
See?

49:28.708 --> 49:36.485
And without that you cannot be Muslim, I mean
Muslim means surrendered.

49:36.485 --> 49:42.036
Just imagine, it’s all Sahaja Yoga, if you
can read between the lines.

49:42.036 --> 49:56.965
We have a book called as “Koran Enlightened,”
we have also “Bible Enlightened,” we have

49:56.965 --> 49:59.634
“Gita Enlightened.”

49:59.659 --> 50:03.403
All right?

50:05.737 --> 50:31.765
Q. He says he finds it difficult to meditate
because his mind is wandering.

50:31.765 --> 50:35.005
How to control the mind Mother?

50:35.005 --> 50:36.615
A. Never control.

50:36.615 --> 50:42.005
Don’t try to control it.

50:42.005 --> 50:44.605
There’s no need to control.

50:44.605 --> 50:52.895
Your Kundalini itself will give you thoughtless
awareness, She’ll work it out.

50:52.895 --> 51:04.425
Try on the photograph, it will work out.

51:04.425 --> 51:20.335
Q. It’s a request Mother, will you come
to Ireland one day?

51:20.335 --> 51:26.475
A. Oh, of course!

51:26.475 --> 51:34.325
They are lost, fighting among themselves.

51:34.350 --> 51:36.778
But I have a special feeling for Ireland.

51:37.155 --> 51:43.306
Because of ignorance, complete ignorance,
now the Catholics were fighting Protestants,

51:43.306 --> 51:51.304
now Protestants are fighting each other, now
Catholics will start fighting each other.

51:51.304 --> 52:00.115
I don’t want to say anything, but you must
understand that all these religions have created

52:00.115 --> 52:07.375
nothing but fighting mongerers.

52:07.375 --> 52:11.784
Crucified Christ and how can you think of
fighting?

52:11.784 --> 52:16.275
All over the world there’s fight in the
name of God.

52:16.275 --> 52:22.875
Can you imagine the stupidity?

52:22.875 --> 52:35.725
Irish are very nice people, very simple, but
they get lost into these different, different

52:35.750 --> 52:37.106
ideas.

52:37.217 --> 52:49.485
Actually, religion should never make you fight,
but the religions have misled them, the religions

52:49.485 --> 52:52.185
have misled them, all right?

52:52.185 --> 52:57.105
We have to give them that real religion of
within.

52:58.818 --> 53:00.593
Innate religion.

53:01.244 --> 53:10.925
In Italy they started an argument with Me
and they said, “We don’t” - ultimately,

53:10.925 --> 53:14.745
they said, “We don’t want to have one
religion for the whole world.”

53:14.745 --> 53:15.745
I said, “Why?

53:15.745 --> 53:19.304
Because then you can’t fight, isn’t it?”

53:19.304 --> 53:25.385
You want to have many religions so you can
nicely fight with each other.

53:25.385 --> 53:30.955
Like Rwanda and all these people.

53:30.955 --> 53:37.705
Religion must bring peace, joy, otherwise
what’s the use of having any religion?

53:37.705 --> 53:46.325
Q. Will you one day come to Scotland, Mother?

53:46.325 --> 53:50.524
A. Scotland I have been.

53:50.524 --> 54:24.465
I have been to Scotland, but, the problem
was, at about 12 o’clock everybody was drunk.

54:24.465 --> 54:43.235
Q. Can Sahaja Yoga change your fate, change
your karma, change your destiny?

54:43.235 --> 54:45.665
Can Sahaja Yoga change it?

54:45.665 --> 54:48.004
A. Your karmas are finished.

54:48.004 --> 54:51.284
After Sahaja Yoga, your karmas are finished.

54:51.284 --> 54:59.284
And can change your face also, but why do
you want to change your face?

54:59.284 --> 55:01.784
- Fate, fate!!

55:01.784 --> 55:09.294
I thought she wanted to change….

55:09.294 --> 55:13.675
Ah, of course, of course it can.

55:13.675 --> 55:25.815
It can change your fate and all your aspirations
are changed.

55:25.815 --> 55:38.655
Then you just want to spread Sahaja Yoga,
and enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis.

55:38.655 --> 55:54.448
Q. He is a student Mother, how can Sahaja
Yoga help with being a student, with education?

55:54.448 --> 55:55.448
A. Very much.

55:55.448 --> 55:59.465
For student, it’s a blessing I say.

55:59.465 --> 56:05.655
Do you know, Sahaja Yogis who have been very
bad students, have stood first, have got first

56:05.655 --> 56:13.825
class, first all over the world Sahaja Yogis
are doing so well in their studies because

56:13.825 --> 56:14.945
you get a clear cut vision.

56:14.945 --> 56:19.949
It’s tremendous, for students it’s very
good.

56:30.839 --> 56:33.723
Q. Is it important to be a vegetarian Mother?

56:33.748 --> 56:34.699
A. Not at all.

56:34.724 --> 56:41.841
You see, in Sahaja Yoga we don’t eat animals
which are bigger than us and you need not

56:41.866 --> 56:43.634
eat animals in case
