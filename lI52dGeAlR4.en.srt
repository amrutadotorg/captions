00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,550
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,950
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,040
where the evil has been suppressed.

4
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:53,870
The evil that spreads its power all over

5
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,120
is only because of two factors.

6
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:06,950
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

7
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,870
you are still blind,

8
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,160
and you follow things

9
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,910
which are not right but you think are powerful.

10
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,830
This illusion creates not only problems,

11
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,160
but absolute destruction.

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,080
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

13
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,950
and it was easily solved.

14
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,910
It was based on all wrong basis,

15
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,950
just to create a problem.

16
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:12,120
Problem was created with a purpose,

17
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,990
and nobody could imagine

18
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,200
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,160
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

20
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,830
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

21
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,950
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

22
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,950
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

23
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,950
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

24
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,950
and they cling on to the fact

25
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,830
that they know everything.

26
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,040
With all this happening,

27
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,790
there have been so many fractions,

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,160
so many stupid people

29
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:43,830
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

30
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,950
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

31
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,830
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

32
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,120
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

33
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,990
it is very subtle.

34
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,200
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

35
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,120
they fall into the wrong path of,

36
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,950
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

37
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,790
the people who are doing good.

38
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,830
But above all is the power of God.

39
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,870
All this drama is played to prove the existence

40
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,040
of that great Power.

41
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,080
It has all worked out so well,

42
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,160
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

43
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,790
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

44
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,120
Many people who have achieved

45
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,120
so-called success cannot see that point,

46
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,830
but you can see it because you are spectators.

47
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,790
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

48
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,120
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

49
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,240
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

50
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,240
that would finish before Diwali.

51
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,910
So it goes like this, the stupidity

52
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,990
which is being created;

53
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,290
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

54
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,200
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

55
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,830
If you see among all these people who have lost,

56
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,950
what impression have they created?

57
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,990
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

58
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,870
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

59
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,290
But what impression they have created?

60
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,990
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

61
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,870
they can see that it’s a miracle,

62
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,120
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

63
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,950
Now the new phase has started.

64
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,950
You all have a very, very open challenge

65
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,160
to get people into enlightenment.

66
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,240
People are not so ignorant now,

67
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,120
they are not so much blasted.

68
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,950
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

69
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:00,830
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

70
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,120
and they understand

71
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,120
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

72
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,990
It’s very important,

73
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,830
because if a human being starts thinking

74
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,040
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

75
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,910
At any cost, whatever may happen,

76
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,240
he’ll go on sticking to that.

77
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,870
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

78
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:40,200
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

79
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,200
to smell the evil – innate.

80
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,240
We cannot, human beings cannot.

81
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,290
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

82
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,950
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

83
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,040
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

84
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,240
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

85
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,950
who is a thief and who is not?

86
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,240
We have a higher awareness.

87
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,830
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

88
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,160
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

89
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,080
We cook our food – they don’t.

90
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,950
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

91
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,870
because the way people behave

92
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,790
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

93
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,200
All this happening

94
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,120
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

95
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,330
and apply it to yourself, and see

96
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,160
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

97
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,240
For that, you have to rise higher.

98
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,950
You have to rise higher

99
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,870
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

100
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,200
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

101
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,830
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

102
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,950
Why my attention is like that?

103
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,870
What is the main reason

104
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,870
for my own

105
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,990
possession, I should say, or my own

106
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,200
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

107
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Once you’ll start seeing that,

108
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
and if you find even a wee bit of such

109
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,790
nonsensical understanding within you,

110
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,870
then you can forgive also people

111
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,910
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

112
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,330
absolutely brainwashed,

113
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,200
and they did everything under that influence.

114
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,120
As it is now you have risen much higher

115
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,830
than all these people,

116
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,910
and much more aware than all of them.

117
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,830
So you have to just understand this point,

118
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,830
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

119
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,950
And for the people who are actually bad,

120
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
you don’t have to worry.

121
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,040
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

122
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,040
But watch yourself and see for yourself

123
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,240
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

124
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,160
You should try to cleanse the mirror

125
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:41,080
so you see your complete image

126
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,910
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

127
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,990
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

128
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,120
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

129
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,790
I simply pity them.

130
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,330
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

131
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,950
to see what they have been doing.

132
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,120
Why have they been doing like that?

133
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,160
What is the need to do that?

134
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,330
All this introspection will work out so well.

135
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,080
Then your real powers will come out

136
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:47,040
– your powers of giving realization,

137
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:55,950
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

138
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,120
of the whole world.

139
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:07,330
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

140
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,990
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

141
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,160
then things will work out.

142
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:20,120
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

143
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:27,370
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

144
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,830
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

145
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:41,200
Of course, with that beautiful idea

146
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,950
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

147
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,450
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

148
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,450
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

149
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,950
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

150
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,910
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

151
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,910
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

152
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:22,490
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

153
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,330
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

154
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,830
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

155
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,410
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

156
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,950
and that you cannot do it.

157
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,120
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

158
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,040
because looks there’s a very little distance

159
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,950
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

160
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,370
It is a very difficult task sometimes

161
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,990
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

162
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,450
At that point I find some of you fail.

163
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,990
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

164
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,870
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

165
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,120
it’s best is to introspect,

166
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,490
“Am I doing everything right?

167
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,330
How am I working for my betterment?”

168
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,080
The illusion is such

169
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,040
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

170
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,160
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

171
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,910
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

172
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,910
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

173
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,990
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

174
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,290
The purpose should be

175
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,200
that you should be able to see yourself within.

176
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,950
You must see what is the problem inside,

177
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,490
and you can very well understand

178
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:34,790
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

179
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:42,830
For example, there’s a very big building,

180
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,870
and all the buildings in the nearby area

181
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,160
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

182
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,120
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

183
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,450
is constructed on very solid grounds.

184
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,990
In the same way

185
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,370
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

186
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:18,240
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

187
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,200
and every person has to do that.

188
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,410
For example, some people told Me,

189
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,200
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

190
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,950
they are big show-offs and that.”

191
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,240
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

192
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,450
that they could be like that.

193
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,120
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

194
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,450
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

195
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,490
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

196
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,370
I said, “Myself I know everything,

197
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,950
but I want you to know everything.”

198
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:19,490
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

199
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,200
– but find out faults within yourself.

200
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,870
What are these things that are strangling us?

201
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:38,490
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

202
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:46,950
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

203
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,910
you have to know how you are driving,

204
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,080
you have to see what are the problems.

205
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,240
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

206
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,330
– it won’t work out.

207
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,160
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

208
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,120
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

209
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,370
joyous thing.

210
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,950
But this joy is not for ourselves;

211
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,910
this joy is for the whole world.

212
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,490
We have to work for the whole world.

213
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,450
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

214
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,830
but what are you doing for others?

215
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,910
That you should see for yourself,

216
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:57,240
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

217
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,330
because they have concern, they have care,

218
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,290
and they are doing something for others.

219
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,790
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

220
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,160
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

221
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,910
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

222
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,120
that we have to do something ourselves

223
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,290
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

224
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,410
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

225
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,200
to make this light unshaky

226
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,790
and full of enthusiasm.

227
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,950
It’s there. It is you who are

228
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:09,370
anxious to fill your pitchers.

229
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,040
You can do it.

230
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,160
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

231
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,200
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

232
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,950
complete picture about yourself,

233
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:37,830
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

234
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,490
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

235
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,290
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

236
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,450
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

237
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,450
what is the aim of our lives?

238
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:07,450
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

239
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,290
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

240
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,410
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

241
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,200
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

242
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,790
then can you imagine what will happen?

243
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,330
Think of that dream I have,

244
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,950
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

245
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,990
and we have to transform them into good people.

246
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,950
If they are not transformed

247
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,490
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

248
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,040
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

249
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:03,490
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

250
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,160
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

251
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,330
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

252
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,790
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

253
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,790
– you have now overcome it.

254
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,870
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

255
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,790
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

256
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,790
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

257
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,950
your method of working it out,

258
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,490
your anxiety to work it out.

259
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,200
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

260
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,290
You can transform anyone.

261
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,200
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

262
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,160
Like when we came in the plane,

263
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,040
I found at the airport so many people

264
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,870
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

265
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,950
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

266
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,830
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

267
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,830
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

268
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,370
” They didn’t know anything about it,

269
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,990
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

270
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Then what is this cool coming?

271
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,950
That basically they are there to get their realization,

272
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,870
only we have to extend our ideals,

273
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,370
we have to extend our love to them.

274
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,370
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

275
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,990
better is to give them a chance

276
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,160
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

277
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:09,490
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

278
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,240
It’s over now. You will be amazed

279
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,240
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

280
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:25,200
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

281
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,830
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

282
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
You have to have more and more of candles,

283
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,080
and that’s what is your job.

284
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,330
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

285
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,330
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

286
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,410
at any cost, at any place?

287
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,160
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

288
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,830
I asked them, “What did you do?”

289
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,160
They said, “No, nothing.”

290
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,830
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

291
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,040
“No, nothing.”

292
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,490
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

293
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,410
If you have done nothing,

294
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,990
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

295
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,450
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

296
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,870
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

297
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,160
we are coming from a program.”

298
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,370
“How are you so late?”

299
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,080
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

300
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,910
“So you were waiting outside?”

301
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,240
“Yes.” “How many?”

302
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,950
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

303
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,080
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

304
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,040
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

305
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,410
“But you were realized souls?”

306
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,200
“No, we had our realization,

307
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,240
that sometimes we have to wait too.

308
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,910
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

309
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,990
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

310
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,330
Only we do it to ourselves.”

311
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,790
So again I will say introspection

312
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,200
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,240
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

314
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:42,240
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

315
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,160
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

316
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,290
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

317
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,790
– how timely they were! It never happened,

318
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,080
in the history of this world it never happened;

319
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,240
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

320
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,990
give a new experience of the showers?

321
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:18,200
All this is a time, we should say,

322
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:25,790
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

323
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,240
that this is the time for a special thing.

324
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,290
Normally I get letters

325
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,870
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

326
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,160
this is sick, all kinds of things.

327
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,240
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

328
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,290
then somebody has children, they are sick –

329
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,330
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

330
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,290
The reason is they

331
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,910
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

332
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,160
or maybe they are halfway,

333
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,950
because they could themself say

334
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,040
that “Why should we write to Mother?

335
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,200
We can get it done ourselves.”

336
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,870
Instead of that, one has to write

337
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,830
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

338
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,950
how they have got love from others,

339
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,240
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

340
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,370
All this is much better to write,

341
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,240
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

342
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:42,160
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

343
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,240
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

344
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,120
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

345
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,950
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

346
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,240
So let it be. That’s not your job,

347
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,240
you don’t have to work it out.

348
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,240
Even before coming I got letters like that:

349
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,080
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

350
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,990
So I asked this lady, I said,

351
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,080
“Why do you write all these things

352
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,790
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

353
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,870
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

354
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,240
“How?”

355
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,490
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

356
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,410
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

357
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,870
This looks like advertising or something,

358
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,490
speciality that you should cure somebody,

359
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,330
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

360
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,490
We just don’t want such people to come.

361
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,290
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

362
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,950
and understanding, and the wisdom.

363
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,200
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

364
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:05,370
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

365
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,290
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

366
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,870
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

367
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:21,370
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

368
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,410
You have to respect yourself.

369
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,830
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

370
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,080
Like understanding,

371
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:40,490
wisdom that we have come here for a

372
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,490
very,  very special work of very high quality:

373
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,040
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

374
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,870
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

375
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,240
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

376
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,290
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

377
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,160
And all my relations are now saying,

378
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,240
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

379
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,040
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

380
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,240
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

381
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,790
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

382
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,160
that “all my family people are saying ...

383
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,450
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

384
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,120
If this marriage doesn’t become

385
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,200
all right, then they will say there’s

386
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,370
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

387
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,990
We have not committed that way.

388
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,990
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

389
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,200
father, this, that.

390
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,830
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

391
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,240
You yourself can cure them

392
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,120
you can work it out yourself.

393
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,120
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

394
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,950
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

395
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
“Mother?" " No.”

396
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,790
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

397
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:28,790
So why are you asking Me?

398
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,950
What relationship I have with them?

399
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,240
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

400
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,200
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

401
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,830
It is impossible to understand.

402
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,410
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

403
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,790
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

404
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,910
you can give them and fix them properly.

405
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,410
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

406
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,870
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

407
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,410
all kinds of things

408
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,990
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

409
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,990
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

410
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,870
What you should do is to see

411
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,370
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

412
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,290
And you must tell them,

413
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,870
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

414
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,830
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

415
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,950
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

416
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,040
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

417
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,490
so everybody comes there.

418
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,330
I would request you on a Diwali day

419
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:01,290
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

420
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,080
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

421
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,450
” It’s very important,

422
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,490
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

423
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,330
and on wrong basis.

424
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,870
If you have some intelligence

425
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,290
you must know that now you belong

426
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,160
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

427
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:39,370
which are very few. In this world

428
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:46,240
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

429
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:53,410
to see that this quality

430
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,490
must be in so many people,

431
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,490
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

432
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,370
Find out such people, tell them

433
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,330
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

434
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,370
But don’t worry about things

435
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,450
which are of no value to us.

436
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,870
You must know you are a special race.

437
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,160
You are special soldiers

438
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,240
who have been trained

439
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,990
for doing Sahaj work only.

440
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,200
So wasting energy on your relations

441
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,370
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

442
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,200
It is to be understood now

443
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:54,410
that you have your own energy reserved

444
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,120
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

445
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,830
You should help everyone

446
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,990
who is a Sahaja yogi

447
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,490
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

448
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,990
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

449
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,450
you must help them; because we are one Personality

450
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,160
and these are all the different hands

451
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:31,950
of one Personality, one God.

452
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,040
So this oneness must be established

453
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:45,410
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

454
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,950
There are some people who are very active.

455
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,910
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

456
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,870
All that will work out, I’m sure,

457
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,080
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

458
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,200
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

459
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,080
nothing will work out.

460
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,160
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

461
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:32,080
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

462
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,450
All the armament they have, everything they have;

463
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,040
but we need more.

464
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,450
And for that we have to work out collectively,

465
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,120
must plan what should we do.

466
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,290
Recently there has been a big

467
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,080
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

468
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,910
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

469
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:12,950
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

470
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,490
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

471
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:22,450
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

472
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,910
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

473
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:30,490
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

474
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,200
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

475
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,040
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

476
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,240
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

477
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:52,330
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

478
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:58,410
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

479
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,410
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

480
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,410
And you will definitely try to correct it,

481
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,450
if you love them

482
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,040
– or you give up.

483
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,450
These are special people, specially selected

484
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,290
for a very special cause,

485
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,910
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

486
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,080
That is one thing you should know.

487
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,330
On this Diwali day you have to know

488
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,990
that you have to burn yourself

489
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:46,330
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

490
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,450
But don’t do it too much.

491
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,120
Like some people came and told Me,

492
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:57,080
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

493
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,410
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

494
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Still we are not good.”

495
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,160
So I said, “Why should you give up?

496
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:09,160
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

497
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,830
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

498
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,290
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

499
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,160
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

500
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,790
Such half-baked people are no good,

501
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,910
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

502
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,160
They don’t deserve any attention.

503
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,990
That is very much to be understood,

504
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,990
that you should not be also like that,

505
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,200
nor you should have friends like that,.

506
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,410
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

507
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,910
Sahaja yogi is a special character

508
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,870
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

509
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:08,370
That kind of a personality when you will have,

510
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,040
there will be lights all over.

511
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,040
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

512
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,910
and I want you to respect yourself

513
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,910
and understand what is the position of

514
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,830
your being in this

515
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:42,330
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

516
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,240
And how are we working it out?

517
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:50,040
The attention should move from

518
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:54,240
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

519
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,870
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

520
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,990
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

521
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,040
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

522
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,950
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

523
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,120
May God bless you.
