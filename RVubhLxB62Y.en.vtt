00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:08.918
Today in the land of Shri Krishna

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:15.001
we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:24.918
Is something very unprecedented

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:36.335
and of a very significant value

00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:43.627
that you should be celebrating

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:54.627
the birthday of Shri Krishna’s Son in His own land.

00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:58.834
You know that Shri Ganesha incarnated

00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:02.543
on this Earth as Mahavishnu

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:09.959
and He was the Son of Radha,

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:21.210
who incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:26.126
So by celebrating this birthday

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:30.793
today you are recognizing the greatest truth

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.043
that Lord Jesus Christ was the son of Shri Krishna.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:49.126
There’s a story about it if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam,

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:58.752
how this Primordial Child took a form of an egg

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.126
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesha

00:02:03.502 --> 00:02:10.793
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:23.959
In the evolutionary process all these happenings

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:29.460
of the antiquities

00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:35.126
have been recorded

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.084
but today

00:02:39.376 --> 00:02:41.793
I feel so gratified that

00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:46.418
on the human level people have understood,

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:59.126
Christ is the incarnation of Lord Ganesha.

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:05.418
He is the Eternal Child

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:10.210
but in the form when He came as Christ,

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:17.627
He came as the son of Shri Krishna.

00:03:18.543 --> 00:03:24.710
But when Parvati made Shri Ganesha,

00:03:25.168 --> 00:03:30.792
He was the son of Parvati alone.

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:34.710
There was no Father.

00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:41.918
Parvati Herself wanted to have a child of Her own.

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:47.793
There were angels who were dedicated

00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:52.001
either to Vishnu or to Shiva,

00:03:54.585 --> 00:04:00.710
like ganas were dedicated

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.959
to Shiva alone.

00:04:07.752 --> 00:04:13.502
So, She wanted to have Her own Son

00:04:14.668 --> 00:04:16.752
who can

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:24.668
permeate

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:32.126
Her powers on this Earth.

00:04:41.168 --> 00:04:47.876
So to begin with when the Shakti created this Universe

00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:52.460
and Sadashiva was watching Her creation,

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:59.126
the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence

00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:05.792
and the embodiment of that innocence was Shri Ganesha.

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:13.543
The whole Universe was covered with innocence,

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:19.752
which we call as Omkara.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:33.792
This innocence protected all the creation of the world

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:38.084
and penetrated into all that is matter.

00:05:38.418 --> 00:05:42.251
Matter is innocent.

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:48.418
If you hit the matter, it will hit you back

00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:50.793
because it is built like that.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.126
It doesn’t want to harm you by any method

00:05:55.502 --> 00:05:57.710
except that if you try to hit it,

00:05:58.043 --> 00:06:04.460
it hits you back, in its own nature.

00:06:06.376 --> 00:06:09.043
So it was called as Jada,

00:06:09.376 --> 00:06:17.251
the one that acts according to the built-in nature.

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:26.210
Innocence in the animals is of another kind,

00:06:26.793 --> 00:06:28.710
where the animals do not know

00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:32.043
that they are committing crimes.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.376
Animals

00:06:36.502 --> 00:06:40.793
when they say, kill an animal, another animal,

00:06:44.627 --> 00:06:47.251
or trespass your properties,

00:06:49.793 --> 00:06:51.834
create nuisance all over,

00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:54.502
they don’t know they are committing a sin

00:06:54.793 --> 00:06:58.627
or they are disobeying some laws.

00:07:00.543 --> 00:07:06.126
They live with the laws that are built within them,

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:11.084
that’s why they are called as pashus means bondage

00:07:11.418 --> 00:07:14.043
– the pasha. Pasha means the bondage.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:21.752
They are under the bondage of the laws of God.

00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:32.418
Shri Shiva is called as Pashupati.

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:40.293
Up to that stage the innocence remains intact

00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:49.918
because there is no development of ego in them.

00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:55.251
So they are innocent.

00:07:55.627 --> 00:08:00.710
A tiger may eat a cow, still he is innocent

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:03.543
or an elephant may trample

00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:10.210
over a human body, still he is innocent.

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:20.876
But when going to a higher state,

00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:26.792
the Mother Shakti, the Primordial Mother thought

00:08:27.168 --> 00:08:30.752
of creating a personality

00:08:31.918 --> 00:08:38.251
who will protect the innocence of human beings.

00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:42.043
Above the matter, above the animals,

00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:46.834
She created Shri Ganesha.

00:08:47.418 --> 00:08:49.627
And you know the story of Shri Ganesha

00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:53.168
how He got the head of an elephant

00:08:53.668 --> 00:08:56.543
– symbolizing that Shri Ganesha,

00:08:56.918 --> 00:08:58.793
though He is a human being,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.084
He is like an animal as far as His head is concerned,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:09.001
that too of Shri Gajanana, in the sense that

00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:14.585
He has got the head of an elephant

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:22.168
which is the wisest animal in the animal kingdom.

00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:28.502
So in such a head, which is innocent,

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.668
ego cannot develop.

00:09:31.084 --> 00:09:35.959
There is no ego. It’s an ego-less state.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:46.251
But human beings were created in a different manner

00:09:48.418 --> 00:09:55.376
and when carbon was placed to create aminoacids,

00:09:57.376 --> 00:10:02.418
it also settled them in motion,

00:10:02.959 --> 00:10:07.876
a new type of evolution in human beings

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.668
that at the Vishuddhi level human beings raised

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.834
[his head] their heads like this.

00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:19.084
Animals’ heads are on the ground

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:28.126
so the energy flows downward into Mother Earth

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:31.834
but when man raised his head above,

00:10:32.293 --> 00:10:36.834
against the energy of gravity,

00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:44.710
then a new complication started in the energy flow

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:49.793
and that is how at the Vishuddhi,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:55.752
a problem started where Kundalini

00:10:57.293 --> 00:10:59.752
could not

00:11:03.543 --> 00:11:05.418
nourish

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:11.792
or look after that problematic Vishuddhi.

00:11:14.084 --> 00:11:17.918
The reason is when you raise your head

00:11:18.543 --> 00:11:20.710
from the Mother Earth,

00:11:21.126 --> 00:11:23.752
you remove yourself away

00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:28.335
from the natural power of Mother Earth.

00:11:29.834 --> 00:11:35.084
When you take your Vishuddhi upward like that,

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.668
you see the result of that in this country

00:11:40.084 --> 00:11:45.043
which is the country of Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:11:46.168 --> 00:11:51.668
that you started going to machines which are against nature,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.834
extracting the nature,

00:11:55.543 --> 00:12:00.502
disturbing the nature by creating atomic bombs,

00:12:03.293 --> 00:12:07.834
by changing the atom, breaking it.

00:12:09.376 --> 00:12:12.502
That means you went against the nature itself

00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:16.293
by raising your head.

00:12:17.293 --> 00:12:20.585
But if it was done

00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:26.376
in complete surrender to God,

00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:32.710
with your bent head towards the Mother Earth,

00:12:33.126 --> 00:12:37.001
it would not have harmed you.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:45.668
But when you completely cut off yourself from that nature,

00:12:46.043 --> 00:12:50.793
which is so bountiful, which is so gracious.

00:12:51.293 --> 00:12:53.834
Yesterday you saw the beautiful pictures

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:58.959
of the nature that surrounds you in this country.

00:12:59.834 --> 00:13:05.876
Such a rich country like America,

00:13:07.251 --> 00:13:12.084
without any gratitude towards its Creator

00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:15.251
raised its head upward

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:20.959
– that’s how the Vishuddhi problem started coming up.

00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:29.418
In every walk of life, the whole social structure

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:33.043
was built up to fight the nature,

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.210
not to go along with the nature.

00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:44.043
So the first attack came on the innocence itself

00:13:45.376 --> 00:13:49.001
– on the Mooladhara itself.

00:13:49.543 --> 00:13:55.210
So the natural ways of Mooladhara were given up.

00:13:56.627 --> 00:14:04.834
Marriage system has been here much before Christ,

00:14:06.126 --> 00:14:13.668
much before Abraham, much before Moses

00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:26.126
and a sanctified marriage, which was blessed by the society,

00:14:28.793 --> 00:14:33.585
was acceptable since long.

00:14:34.543 --> 00:14:38.168
But man in his arrogance

00:14:38.585 --> 00:14:42.752
raised his voice against the marriage,

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:50.793
against the natural way of leading a life of sanity.

00:14:52.376 --> 00:15:02.752
If it was natural to be the way people lead their private life,

00:15:03.793 --> 00:15:10.627
why do they get all kinds of diseases?

00:15:12.126 --> 00:15:15.793
If you are a natural person, you don’t get any diseases.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.502
Because you are anti-nature,

00:15:25.168 --> 00:15:27.293
that’s why

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:34.543
in this country now many man and women were murdered

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:37.418
for jealousy?

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.418
If it was natural

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:44.668
to be in love with ten men and ten women

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.460
then why jealousy?

00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:55.752
You should be happy, it’s very natural.

00:15:58.752 --> 00:16:02.001
Because the head was raised at Vishuddhi Chakra

00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:07.959
without surrendering to Shri Krishna,

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:22.543
anti-life, anti-biotic atmosphere started growing.

00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:31.834
And this kind of life has taken this great country,

00:16:32.335 --> 00:16:38.418
now to the brink of complete destruction.

00:16:40.168 --> 00:16:44.502
The attack of innocence

00:16:44.918 --> 00:16:50.502
is the greatest weakness of this country.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:17:00.752
Not to value the power of chastity and a chaste life

00:17:03.043 --> 00:17:10.418
is the biggest mistake that was created by the people

00:17:10.834 --> 00:17:15.876
who started all kinds of trends and fads.

00:17:16.418 --> 00:17:23.210
Ganesha is the root of Creation.

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:27.627
When you go against Shri Ganesh

00:17:28.043 --> 00:17:32.876
you start losing your roots, you have no roots at all.

00:17:33.502 --> 00:17:37.918
Then you get drifted into anything stupid,

00:17:38.335 --> 00:17:43.210
anything new that comes up.

00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:51.502
So much so that a person like Freud was worshipped

00:17:52.376 --> 00:17:55.668
and they forgot Christ,

00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:59.834
who said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:18:00.335 --> 00:18:05.210
Ganesha to that level, that even the eyes have to be innocent.

00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:10.710
There should be no lust in your eyes.

00:18:13.543 --> 00:18:17.460
But arrogance

00:18:19.251 --> 00:18:21.210
made them feel, “What’s wrong?

00:18:22.126 --> 00:18:25.335
What’s wrong in this? What’s wrong in this?”

00:18:25.752 --> 00:18:33.418
Now the whole country is facing a great crisis

00:18:35.168 --> 00:18:42.251
because of arrogant enterprises.

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:55.460
Still they make a martyrdom out of all that is destructive.

00:18:59.918 --> 00:19:04.959
It’s a very great responsibility on the Sahaja yogis

00:19:05.293 --> 00:19:10.543
who live on the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:21.293
But for the people who live in the land of Shri Krishna,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:29.752
the responsibility is absolutely on your neck

00:19:31.502 --> 00:19:36.793
and you can’t get out of it.

00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:42.001
Unless and until you understand the importance

00:19:42.376 --> 00:19:45.585
of innocence in your life

00:19:45.959 --> 00:19:51.543
you cannot save this country whatever I may try to do for it.

00:19:51.959 --> 00:19:56.293
It’s only you who are going to save it.

00:19:56.793 --> 00:20:04.251
It’s only you who are going to make it.

00:20:07.126 --> 00:20:09.126
When the Kundalini rises

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:12.793
Shri Ganesha is awakened in you,

00:20:13.752 --> 00:20:18.792
the Ganesha whom you never respected,

00:20:19.627 --> 00:20:27.834
slowly comes up from His slumber,

00:20:28.502 --> 00:20:33.168
out of the hurt and the injuries inflicted on Him,

00:20:33.502 --> 00:20:37.168
still He stands up.

00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:38.668
But still weak

00:20:42.876 --> 00:20:45.793
How are we going to nourish it?

00:20:46.251 --> 00:20:53.752
How are we going to look after its growth?

00:20:57.043 --> 00:21:04.543
The responsibility of Sahaja yogis of America is very great.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:10.293
They cannot cheat any more themselves.

00:21:10.752 --> 00:21:16.168
They cannot be satisfied with their arrogance.

00:21:16.627 --> 00:21:21.792
The mistakes have been grievous.

00:21:22.752 --> 00:21:27.460
So you have to take it up as a crusade

00:21:28.126 --> 00:21:30.293
against those mistakes

00:21:31.168 --> 00:21:35.918
and to establish your Shri Ganesha in a full form

00:21:36.543 --> 00:21:40.084
so that He gives you the necessary balance

00:21:40.084 --> 00:21:44.834
and the roots to nourish yourself.

00:21:45.668 --> 00:21:47.251
It is shocking first.

00:21:47.585 --> 00:21:50.793
I mean you just can’t understand;

00:21:51.668 --> 00:21:53.210
it is impossible

00:21:55.335 --> 00:22:00.710
to see how you could accept such absurd ideas;

00:22:04.043 --> 00:22:10.251
how you could take to such funny things,

00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:19.543
which are obviously horrid.

00:22:26.043 --> 00:22:30.585
Are we not aware of certain words like prostitution?

00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:32.959
And all other dirty words that they use,

00:22:33.335 --> 00:22:36.084
which I don’t want to say just now,

00:22:36.418 --> 00:22:41.251
or they have lost their meanings?

00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:48.918
We were all aware of it, we all knew about it.

00:22:49.627 --> 00:22:53.959
[Don’t do that … You should not.

00:22:54.418 --> 00:22:59.793
When I’m speaking must be quiet, all right?]

00:23:01.168 --> 00:23:06.752
Have we lost all wisdom from our minds

00:23:07.543 --> 00:23:10.752
that we cannot see

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.210
what we have done to ourselves?

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:21.834
We have no self-respect.

00:23:24.168 --> 00:23:30.376
Arrogance to that limit is very dangerous,

00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:37.418
extremely unpredictable.

00:23:37.918 --> 00:23:41.543
And God knows what can come through

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:48.834
with all these ventures we have gone into.

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.627
I would say for Sahaja yogis,

00:23:54.959 --> 00:24:00.502
I have given some instructions with people

00:24:00.876 --> 00:24:07.585
– how they should respect their privacy of life,

00:24:11.834 --> 00:24:15.793
specially the women of America.

00:24:16.502 --> 00:24:19.585
If they have to be the shaktis,

00:24:20.084 --> 00:24:26.668
they have to respect their chastity.

00:24:28.335 --> 00:24:37.418
But so surprising that when we see outside

00:24:37.918 --> 00:24:43.460
all these things happening, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:44.084 --> 00:24:51.335
some of us try to be one of them who are going to hell.

00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:54.710
If you have to save them,

00:24:55.168 --> 00:25:03.834
then try to fix your positions, properly.

00:25:05.418 --> 00:25:10.918
Shri Ganesha has four hands

00:25:12.335 --> 00:25:19.834
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

00:25:21.168 --> 00:25:26.585
is the one you have to be careful about.

00:25:31.627 --> 00:25:34.168
That is His job

00:25:36.959 --> 00:25:39.335
and if you neglect Him,

00:25:41.752 --> 00:25:44.168
that force will act

00:25:45.834 --> 00:25:48.668
and act so vehemently

00:25:49.293 --> 00:25:51.792
that despite your realization

00:25:52.168 --> 00:25:57.001
you may not be able to save yourself.

00:25:57.627 --> 00:26:00.668
Do not take your realization for granted.

00:26:01.084 --> 00:26:03.668
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:07.335
your realization has no meaning at all.

00:26:07.918 --> 00:26:09.959
Watch yourself,

00:26:11.376 --> 00:26:14.502
have you got adulterous eyes?

00:26:18.585 --> 00:26:23.834
Have you got an adulterous mind?

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:34.335
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

00:26:35.585 --> 00:26:39.084
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

00:26:39.502 --> 00:26:45.502
then you must get a good amount of health,

00:26:46.001 --> 00:26:47.792
money

00:26:51.251 --> 00:26:53.126
and position,

00:26:53.376 --> 00:26:55.210
power.

00:26:59.001 --> 00:27:06.335
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha,

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:11.293
Nirmal Ganesha.

00:27:14.959 --> 00:27:20.293
“Oh, Mother, please give us

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:26.793
the blessings of establishment of purity

00:27:27.752 --> 00:27:33.126
in our Ganesha principle.”

00:27:34.543 --> 00:27:36.043
In relationships,

00:27:41.084 --> 00:27:43.335
in attitudes,

00:27:47.043 --> 00:27:48.793
in behavior,

00:27:53.001 --> 00:27:57.585
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:09.418
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

00:28:09.876 --> 00:28:15.210
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

00:28:16.126 --> 00:28:21.834
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

00:28:22.418 --> 00:28:26.627
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

00:28:27.084 --> 00:28:33.585
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

00:28:34.084 --> 00:28:39.210
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

00:28:39.668 --> 00:28:45.126
Everything that is done against Him after realization

00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:50.043
will tell upon you

00:28:53.043 --> 00:28:58.168
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

00:28:59.293 --> 00:29:03.376
as absolutely degraded people.

00:29:03.793 --> 00:29:07.792
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:14.834
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.126
Whatever you have done in the past is finished now

00:29:19.543 --> 00:29:22.210
because you are a new bird.

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:25.668
But after becoming this,

00:29:26.168 --> 00:29:32.543
if you try to take to these wrong ideas

00:29:33.502 --> 00:29:42.001
or to indulge into them, I cannot help you at all.

00:29:45.585 --> 00:29:50.918
After all Shri Ganesha is My Son

00:29:52.502 --> 00:29:56.627
because He is pure.

00:29:59.001 --> 00:30:02.502
Now He is not the only son I have.

00:30:02.876 --> 00:30:06.001
I have so many sons and daughters

00:30:06.376 --> 00:30:08.834
and I have made you in the same way

00:30:08.834 --> 00:30:13.126
as I created Shri Ganesha, without the Father,

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.793
on My own.

00:30:20.126 --> 00:30:24.460
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

00:30:24.793 --> 00:30:33.627
and purity of your body is going to please.

00:30:35.627 --> 00:30:39.376
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

00:30:39.752 --> 00:30:44.585
My name itself means purity.

00:30:45.918 --> 00:30:47.876
You can do it.

00:30:48.168 --> 00:30:49.793
You are empowered to do it.

00:30:50.126 --> 00:30:51.668
You have a Kundalini to do it.

00:30:52.001 --> 00:30:57.876
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

00:31:00.043 --> 00:31:02.668
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

00:31:03.001 --> 00:31:07.001
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

00:31:07.543 --> 00:31:12.793
One chakra you keep clean, the rest is looked after.

00:31:15.168 --> 00:31:21.168
All your incurable diseases right from

00:31:24.084 --> 00:31:28.126
all muscular troubles like myelitis and all that,

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.460
all your incurable diseases right from cancer onwards,

00:31:35.792 --> 00:31:38.502
all your psychosomatic problems

00:31:40.376 --> 00:31:43.376
right from schizophrenia, everything

00:31:44.126 --> 00:31:48.293
come because of the disturbance in Mooladhara.

00:31:51.752 --> 00:31:54.668
When the roots are not all right,

00:31:56.084 --> 00:31:58.959
how can you cure the tree?

00:31:59.543 --> 00:32:01.335
If the roots are all right

00:32:01.792 --> 00:32:05.710
then any medicine can reach any center,

00:32:06.376 --> 00:32:10.585
any area, any place, any fruit.

00:32:12.376 --> 00:32:15.001
But if the roots are not all right,

00:32:16.293 --> 00:32:18.502
how can you work it out?

00:32:20.959 --> 00:32:23.627
Today you have called Me here,

00:32:23.959 --> 00:32:28.834
to worship Shri Ganesha, within Me.

00:32:31.668 --> 00:32:37.793
Shri Ganesha within Me is a powerful identity.

00:32:39.585 --> 00:32:45.168
While worshipping Him you have to know

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:52.043
that such a powerful thing

00:32:52.585 --> 00:32:56.543
you have to establish within yourself

00:32:58.126 --> 00:33:00.918
and by that establishment

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:12.251
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:19.668
and the power of Shri Ganesha’s

00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:26.084
greatness is auspiciousness.

00:33:31.001 --> 00:33:35.710
It’s a coefficience;

00:33:36.792 --> 00:33:41.876
it’s a formula, we can say in scientific language,

00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:48.543
that emits auspiciousness.

00:33:53.876 --> 00:34:00.418
It’s a magnet in the Mother Earth.

00:34:01.585 --> 00:34:05.502
The same magnet is within you,

00:34:05.834 --> 00:34:07.793
which is Shri Ganesha.

00:34:08.084 --> 00:34:10.543
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

00:34:10.834 --> 00:34:18.168
which is the north, south, east, west.

00:34:18.834 --> 00:34:21.793
Close My eyes, still I’ll tell you.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.168
You know there are so many birds who fly out

00:34:25.543 --> 00:34:28.460
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

00:34:28.793 --> 00:34:30.918
because they have that magnet with them,

00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:33.251
they have that innocence with them.

00:34:33.668 --> 00:34:35.126
There are so many fishes,

00:34:35.502 --> 00:34:40.418
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

00:34:41.335 --> 00:34:43.627
Scientists should find out.

00:34:44.043 --> 00:34:51.918
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

00:34:52.668 --> 00:35:01.460
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

00:35:02.668 --> 00:35:03.460
becomes magnetic

00:35:12.918 --> 00:35:19.084
and magnet attracts the steel

00:35:20.335 --> 00:35:25.668
– not dried leaves, does not – steel.

00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:29.585
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

00:35:30.001 --> 00:35:33.627
Is a man with the steel, say.

00:35:34.084 --> 00:35:40.293
“Man of steel” – a person who has character, conviction

00:35:40.792 --> 00:35:45.418
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

00:35:45.793 --> 00:35:49.335
is a man of steel.

00:35:49.793 --> 00:35:58.001
So this magnet attracts the steel.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:05.376
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

00:36:06.834 --> 00:36:13.001
not pliable, it’s rather dry

00:36:15.418 --> 00:36:19.168
but the magnet attracts, means

00:36:20.543 --> 00:36:25.460
it creates that special quality in the steel

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:30.210
that it moves towards the magnet.

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:39.418
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

00:36:39.918 --> 00:36:42.834
you’ll be amazed.

00:36:43.335 --> 00:36:45.543
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

00:36:45.918 --> 00:36:47.627
they’ll be running towards you.

00:36:48.043 --> 00:36:52.335
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

00:36:53.084 --> 00:36:57.793
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

00:36:58.502 --> 00:37:03.752
– anywhere, any place.

00:37:04.126 --> 00:37:08.585
So what is this magnet?

00:37:09.376 --> 00:37:13.001
Is pure love.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.084
Is pure love

00:37:16.502 --> 00:37:21.210
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn’t depend

00:37:21.668 --> 00:37:25.460
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:30.043
It is the support of itself.

00:37:30.668 --> 00:37:34.210
It’s like light that spreads just by its own nature,

00:37:34.668 --> 00:37:35.918
doesn’t want anything,

00:37:36.293 --> 00:37:38.126
doesn’t expect anything.

00:37:38.585 --> 00:37:44.210
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people’s hearts.

00:37:44.627 --> 00:37:50.502
That’s why they get attracted.

00:37:53.752 --> 00:37:56.168
Those who have not even seen Me,

00:37:56.668 --> 00:37:59.502
those who have not even known Me,

00:38:00.418 --> 00:38:02.543
just with My name, I’ve seen,

00:38:03.376 --> 00:38:07.084
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

00:38:07.668 --> 00:38:09.543
that they said, “We have to call the police”.

00:38:09.834 --> 00:38:11.585
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

00:38:11.793 --> 00:38:13.460
we'll manage somehow.”

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.251
In Poona we had such crowds

00:38:15.251 --> 00:38:18.793
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

00:38:18.876 --> 00:38:22.376
He said, “Mother, I’ll give You very big area

00:38:22.668 --> 00:38:24.918
where You can sit down in a big open place

00:38:25.668 --> 00:38:28.668
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished.”

00:38:28.918 --> 00:38:31.876
I said, “You don’t worry,

00:38:32.335 --> 00:38:34.918
everything will be in proper place.”

00:38:35.335 --> 00:38:38.710
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

00:38:39.084 --> 00:38:43.668
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

00:38:44.084 --> 00:38:50.084
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

00:38:50.502 --> 00:38:53.335
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

00:38:53.668 --> 00:38:55.460
Just like a picture.

00:38:55.876 --> 00:38:59.752
No movement of hand, feet, eyes – nothing.

00:39:00.084 --> 00:39:04.168
Just sitting like a picture.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.959
And the gentleman who owned that hall

00:39:08.418 --> 00:39:12.460
had never seen such a thing before.

00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:15.710
Throughout for one and half hour,

00:39:16.627 --> 00:39:19.168
no movement of any kind.

00:39:22.251 --> 00:39:26.376
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

00:39:26.876 --> 00:39:31.710
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

00:39:32.126 --> 00:39:34.460
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

00:39:34.876 --> 00:39:39.543
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

00:39:39.876 --> 00:39:45.168
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

00:39:45.792 --> 00:39:56.168
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

00:39:57.418 --> 00:39:59.168
A child, there’s one child,

00:39:59.543 --> 00:40:03.001
everybody is attracted towards the child.

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:07.876
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

00:40:08.418 --> 00:40:13.418
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

00:40:13.876 --> 00:40:16.084
everybody would be worried about the child.

00:40:16.543 --> 00:40:17.710
What’s happening to the child?

00:40:18.084 --> 00:40:23.001
They will not think: it’s an Arab child or an American child, no.

00:40:23.502 --> 00:40:28.043
Unless and until it’s a devil.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.418
Why this attraction for children?

00:40:31.834 --> 00:40:33.376
Because their magnets are intact.

00:40:33.793 --> 00:40:35.918
Their ego has not yet developed.

00:40:36.335 --> 00:40:39.376
Our ego developed, had to develop

00:40:39.793 --> 00:40:43.792
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

00:40:44.168 --> 00:40:47.460
what is right and what is wrong.

00:40:47.918 --> 00:40:49.918
So the ego developed was all right.

00:40:50.335 --> 00:40:54.084
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

00:40:54.627 --> 00:40:58.668
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

00:40:59.001 --> 00:41:00.959
overlapped the superego also.

00:41:01.376 --> 00:41:03.793
No conditioning, nothing.

00:41:04.335 --> 00:41:06.210
We’ll do whatever we like.

00:41:06.585 --> 00:41:08.752
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

00:41:09.126 --> 00:41:12.043
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

00:41:12.418 --> 00:41:16.210
Then we’ll cut our hair or we’ll do this, we’ll do that.

00:41:16.792 --> 00:41:18.710
No conditioning of any kind.

00:41:19.126 --> 00:41:24.418
All superego was also covered – ego.

00:41:26.543 --> 00:41:31.293
This ego would have been all right

00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:36.251
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

00:41:36.876 --> 00:41:42.251
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

00:41:42.752 --> 00:41:48.834
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

00:41:49.502 --> 00:41:54.918
If you see a farmer and a big professor

00:41:55.376 --> 00:41:59.210
or a very well educated man

00:41:59.668 --> 00:42:01.792
and talk to both of them. You’ll find the farmer

00:42:02.084 --> 00:42:09.792
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:14.043
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

00:42:14.502 --> 00:42:16.126
He knows the living process.

00:42:16.585 --> 00:42:21.918
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:28.251
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:35.335
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

00:42:35.792 --> 00:42:40.543
ten ego-oriented people.

00:42:42.792 --> 00:42:47.918
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

00:42:48.376 --> 00:42:52.918
is that you become a wise person.

00:42:53.293 --> 00:42:56.834
When you speak, people start looking at you.

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:02.001
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

00:43:02.543 --> 00:43:13.710
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

00:43:15.084 --> 00:43:18.752
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

00:43:19.084 --> 00:43:22.918
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

00:43:23.418 --> 00:43:26.585
is good for nothing.

00:43:26.918 --> 00:43:29.918
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

00:43:30.293 --> 00:43:33.959
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.585
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

00:43:36.918 --> 00:43:39.585
and hitting that person.

00:43:40.001 --> 00:43:42.418
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

00:43:42.793 --> 00:43:44.543
they say, “That bull, the same bull”.

00:43:44.959 --> 00:43:46.668
Everybody reports about the same bull.

00:43:47.126 --> 00:43:51.710
“Oh, that’s the one, all right.”

00:43:54.752 --> 00:43:59.793
So it grants you wisdom.

00:44:01.335 --> 00:44:04.543
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

00:44:04.959 --> 00:44:07.168
your eyes are radiant.

00:44:07.627 --> 00:44:12.126
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

00:44:12.752 --> 00:44:15.460
when He is enlightening you;

00:44:15.834 --> 00:44:25.585
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.418
But this glance is so powerful

00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:33.126
that even one glance is sufficient

00:44:33.585 --> 00:44:38.502
to purify thousands of people.

00:44:40.251 --> 00:44:44.792
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:49.293
and you find whole thing changes

00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:52.959
into a beautiful morning

00:44:53.376 --> 00:44:59.460
from a complete dark night.

00:45:03.668 --> 00:45:07.627
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

00:45:08.543 --> 00:45:11.668
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

00:45:12.084 --> 00:45:16.668
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:21.168
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:30.126
He has to certify, “All right. Pass. Go,” on every chakra.

00:45:30.834 --> 00:45:32.793
And when the Kundalini rises,

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:39.001
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

00:45:39.543 --> 00:45:41.460
But then when He sleeps down,

00:45:41.834 --> 00:45:47.001
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

00:45:52.126 --> 00:45:54.460
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

00:45:54.834 --> 00:45:58.793
That’s not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

00:45:59.376 --> 00:46:06.876
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

00:46:07.335 --> 00:46:13.834
with something that cannot allow

00:46:14.335 --> 00:46:18.376
Shri Ganesha’s principle to manifest in us.

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:23.251
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

00:46:23.792 --> 00:46:28.585
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:35.084
That’s all, but it never dies.

00:46:35.627 --> 00:46:42.710
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

00:46:47.834 --> 00:46:52.168
The another quality of a person who is endowed

00:46:52.752 --> 00:46:56.418
with Shri Ganesha’s powers is that

00:46:56.834 --> 00:46:59.376
He removes all the hurdles.

00:46:59.752 --> 00:47:05.460
If one person of this nature is in some place,

00:47:05.959 --> 00:47:08.335
all the rest of the people who are nearby

00:47:08.752 --> 00:47:13.210
will be saved if there’s an accident or if there’s any problem,

00:47:13.792 --> 00:47:19.210
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

00:47:25.418 --> 00:47:28.792
You will find this happening.

00:47:29.168 --> 00:47:36.168
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

00:47:36.834 --> 00:47:39.959
He guides you.

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.293
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

00:47:43.668 --> 00:47:46.585
He is the one who is Sahaja.

00:47:47.001 --> 00:47:51.418
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

00:47:51.918 --> 00:47:54.376
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

00:47:54.793 --> 00:47:58.001
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

00:47:58.502 --> 00:48:01.543
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

00:48:01.918 --> 00:48:09.710
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

00:48:11.793 --> 00:48:17.752
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

00:48:18.293 --> 00:48:25.959
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

00:48:28.001 --> 00:48:29.793
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

00:48:30.251 --> 00:48:32.834
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

00:48:33.293 --> 00:48:35.001
because all the Gods and Goddesses

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.668
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:42.001
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

00:48:42.502 --> 00:48:43.752
He knows,

00:48:44.168 --> 00:48:53.876
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

00:48:54.752 --> 00:48:57.792
To have all the powers of the world,

00:48:58.168 --> 00:49:02.792
just keep the Mother pleased.

00:49:05.793 --> 00:49:08.959
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

00:49:09.335 --> 00:49:11.418
which can be described.

00:49:11.834 --> 00:49:18.834
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:28.001
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.792
but He is the one who will tell you

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:34.668
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

00:49:35.168 --> 00:49:39.293
That means He gives you the taste of love

00:49:39.834 --> 00:49:42.834
in the food that is cooked for you.

00:49:43.376 --> 00:49:47.084
Because He is love.

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:54.251
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.

00:49:55.752 --> 00:49:58.376
Once they asked Me to sing a song.

00:49:58.792 --> 00:50:00.792
I used to sing very well once upon a time

00:50:01.251 --> 00:50:03.043
but then after lecturing so many times,

00:50:03.585 --> 00:50:05.502
you see I think I lost My voice.

00:50:05.918 --> 00:50:08.126
I couldn’t sing well, I thought so.

00:50:08.627 --> 00:50:11.418
One day they asked Me to sing a song

00:50:11.918 --> 00:50:17.126
and I thought of some song and sang to them.

00:50:17.876 --> 00:50:23.001
And after a year or so in a program they said,

00:50:23.418 --> 00:50:25.543
“Mother we want to sing You a song.”

00:50:25.918 --> 00:50:29.084
This was a song unknown to everyone,

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:31.752
I don’t know from where they got it,

00:50:32.251 --> 00:50:33.918
from where they made the tune.

00:50:34.335 --> 00:50:37.793
They started singing the same song.

00:50:38.293 --> 00:50:43.043
And such joy, I mean, it all became waves of tears

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:47.126
in My eyes. I couldn’t control My joy.

00:50:47.627 --> 00:50:52.502
Now all this feeling of joy

00:50:53.293 --> 00:50:58.710
comes from the devices produced by Shri Ganesha.

00:50:59.126 --> 00:51:05.418
He is busy creating relationships, beautiful.

00:51:05.793 --> 00:51:10.460
How? In a birthday, a child’s birthday, what do we say?

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:13.543
“All right, so tomorrow morning

00:51:13.918 --> 00:51:18.084
there’s a bird is going to drop a present for you.”

00:51:19.084 --> 00:51:21.834
And then the child gets up and sees there’s no bird.

00:51:22.335 --> 00:51:24.376
It’s only Ganesha who has given the idea.

00:51:24.876 --> 00:51:29.585
We can say He is a Santa Claus.

00:51:30.293 --> 00:51:33.792
He gives you ways and methods and He tells you

00:51:34.293 --> 00:51:39.668
how to delicately build up relationships, pure relationships.

00:51:46.834 --> 00:51:51.627
How you hide, how you wrap a little present,

00:51:51.959 --> 00:51:58.460
just put it there and a person who has to take it, sees it,

00:51:59.084 --> 00:52:03.084
“Oh God.” And then you see that flowers

00:52:03.585 --> 00:52:06.876
which you suddenly bring out, you put them,

00:52:07.335 --> 00:52:13.168
is all Shri Ganesha’s efforts, His ways, His suggestions.

00:52:14.418 --> 00:52:20.251
Among the creation, flowers are expressing

00:52:20.668 --> 00:52:24.084
Shri Ganesha’s essence.

00:52:24.502 --> 00:52:25.959
And the essence of Shri Ganesha

00:52:26.418 --> 00:52:33.543
comes from the Mother Earth’s essence, is the fragrance.

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:40.126
So a person who is endowed

00:52:40.792 --> 00:52:44.792
with Shri Ganesha’s blessings has fragrance,

00:52:45.251 --> 00:52:50.793
sometimes chandan, sometime roses,

00:52:51.418 --> 00:52:57.293
sometimes these gardenia.

00:52:57.959 --> 00:53:01.627
You just don’t know from where the fragrance is coming.

00:53:02.001 --> 00:53:07.627
The fragrance is coming from Shri Ganesh

00:53:08.793 --> 00:53:14.543
and that is what is the magnet within you.

00:53:15.918 --> 00:53:22.251
Such a person is fragrant, absolutely fragrant all the time.

00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:31.876
Shri Ganesha emits all kinds of fragrance from such a person.

00:53:37.084 --> 00:53:43.959
And that you can only feel when your Shri Ganesha is all right.

00:53:47.543 --> 00:53:52.752
There’s no end to the description of this great Deity within you.

00:53:53.126 --> 00:53:56.543
He’s just settled down there, He’s all the time there,

00:53:57.001 --> 00:54:01.585
waiting to be cleansed out, for Him to raise His head,

00:54:02.043 --> 00:54:05.293
like a lotus in the mud.

00:54:05.792 --> 00:54:08.460
You just help it out by respecting it

00:54:08.918 --> 00:54:12.126
and He’ll be there, fragrant within you.

00:54:12.627 --> 00:54:16.168
So important for this country

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:25.210
where we have raised our head without surrendering

00:54:25.792 --> 00:54:34.418
it to the Virata, to the collectivity, to Shri Krishna.

00:54:34.959 --> 00:54:38.126
We have raised our head,

00:54:38.627 --> 00:54:42.959
with Shri Ganesha we bow down our head,

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:48.502
for all the bounties that God has bestowed upon us.

00:54:49.001 --> 00:54:50.585
All arrogance will disappear at the

00:54:51.084 --> 00:54:53.376
Lotus Feet of Shri Ganesha.

00:54:53.585 --> 00:54:55.793
He’ll give us wisdom.

00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:58.460
He’ll give us sense to understand.

00:54:58.792 --> 00:55:01.418
He’ll give us power to overcome our arrogance

00:55:01.793 --> 00:55:03.210
that is within us.

00:55:04.001 --> 00:55:08.418
He’s the one who is the giver of knowledge.

00:55:08.918 --> 00:55:11.043
He’s the one who is give us light.

00:55:11.543 --> 00:55:13.918
Many people in India also worship Shri Ganesha,

00:55:14.376 --> 00:55:17.502
go on “Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha,

00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:23.834
and do all kinds of funny things.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:28.918
That’s like cheating yourself unnecessarily.

00:55:29.502 --> 00:55:33.585
It’s so simple to establish Shri Ganesha within you.

00:55:34.043 --> 00:55:40.918
But understand that it is vital

00:55:41.585 --> 00:55:45.460
that you people who are Sahaja yogis

00:55:46.001 --> 00:55:49.376
should establish Shri Ganesha,

00:55:49.918 --> 00:55:53.001
which is a silent power within you, doesn’t talk.

00:55:53.543 --> 00:55:57.834
It’s a silent power, which acts.

00:55:58.502 --> 00:56:02.834
Just a power that’s dynamic

00:56:03.418 --> 00:56:09.918
without any noise, without any show.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:15.792
And that is what I would say that today

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:22.251
when I have said all these things from My heart,

00:56:22.793 --> 00:56:28.210
you the Sahaja yogis will establish Shri Ganesha within you.

00:56:28.668 --> 00:56:33.793
And from you, you will emit such powers

00:56:34.293 --> 00:56:38.418
that others will be able to establish

00:56:38.793 --> 00:56:42.126
their Shri Ganesha in this country.

00:56:42.792 --> 00:56:43.668
May God bless you.

00:59:08.293 --> 00:59:09.834
We’ll call her as Gauri.

00:59:10.335 --> 00:59:14.710
Today is Ganesha’s day so Gauri is the name.

01:00:07.376 --> 01:00:08.084
