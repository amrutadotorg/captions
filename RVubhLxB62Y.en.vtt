WEBVTT

00:04.335 --> 00:08.918
Today in the land of Shri Krishna

00:10.126 --> 00:15.001
we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

00:17.627 --> 00:24.918
Is something very unprecedented

00:26.043 --> 00:36.335
and of a very significant value

00:39.502 --> 00:43.627
that you should be celebrating

00:46.876 --> 00:54.627
the birthday of Shri Krishna’s Son in His own land.

00:56.251 --> 00:58.834
You know that Shri Ganesha incarnated

00:59.168 --> 01:02.543
on this Earth as Mahavishnu

01:04.376 --> 01:09.959
and He was the Son of Radha,

01:12.502 --> 01:21.210
who incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

01:22.585 --> 01:26.126
So by celebrating this birthday

01:26.834 --> 01:30.793
today you are recognizing the greatest truth

01:31.210 --> 01:40.043
that Lord Jesus Christ was the son of Shri Krishna.

01:43.502 --> 01:49.126
There’s a story about it if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam,

01:50.668 --> 01:58.752
how this Primordial Child took a form of an egg

01:59.210 --> 02:03.126
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesha

02:03.502 --> 02:10.793
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

02:13.918 --> 02:23.959
In the evolutionary process all these happenings

02:25.792 --> 02:29.460
of the antiquities

02:32.627 --> 02:35.126
have been recorded

02:35.210 --> 02:37.084
but today

02:39.376 --> 02:41.793
I feel so gratified that

02:42.126 --> 02:46.418
on the human level people have understood,

02:50.502 --> 02:59.126
Christ is the incarnation of Lord Ganesha.

03:00.001 --> 03:05.418
He is the Eternal Child

03:05.876 --> 03:10.210
but in the form when He came as Christ,

03:10.627 --> 03:17.627
He came as the son of Shri Krishna.

03:18.543 --> 03:24.710
But when Parvati made Shri Ganesha,

03:25.168 --> 03:30.792
He was the son of Parvati alone.

03:31.793 --> 03:34.710
There was no Father.

03:35.168 --> 03:41.918
Parvati Herself wanted to have a child of Her own.

03:42.376 --> 03:47.793
There were angels who were dedicated

03:48.585 --> 03:52.001
either to Vishnu or to Shiva,

03:54.585 --> 04:00.710
like ganas were dedicated

04:04.710 --> 04:06.959
to Shiva alone.

04:07.752 --> 04:13.502
So, She wanted to have Her own Son

04:14.668 --> 04:16.752
who can

04:22.084 --> 04:24.668
permeate

04:27.376 --> 04:32.126
Her powers on this Earth.

04:41.168 --> 04:47.876
So to begin with when the Shakti created this Universe

04:48.376 --> 04:52.460
and Sadashiva was watching Her creation,

04:52.792 --> 04:59.126
the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence

04:59.752 --> 05:05.792
and the embodiment of that innocence was Shri Ganesha.

05:08.251 --> 05:13.543
The whole Universe was covered with innocence,

05:13.959 --> 05:19.752
which we call as Omkara.

05:24.710 --> 05:33.792
This innocence protected all the creation of the world

05:34.251 --> 05:38.084
and penetrated into all that is matter.

05:38.418 --> 05:42.251
Matter is innocent.

05:45.585 --> 05:48.418
If you hit the matter, it will hit you back

05:48.834 --> 05:50.793
because it is built like that.

05:51.210 --> 05:55.126
It doesn’t want to harm you by any method

05:55.502 --> 05:57.710
except that if you try to hit it,

05:58.043 --> 06:04.460
it hits you back, in its own nature.

06:06.376 --> 06:09.043
So it was called as Jada,

06:09.376 --> 06:17.251
the one that acts according to the built-in nature.

06:20.585 --> 06:26.210
Innocence in the animals is of another kind,

06:26.793 --> 06:28.710
where the animals do not know

06:29.001 --> 06:32.043
that they are committing crimes.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.376
Animals

06:36.502 --> 06:40.793
when they say, kill an animal, another animal,

06:44.627 --> 06:47.251
or trespass your properties,

06:49.793 --> 06:51.834
create nuisance all over,

06:52.168 --> 06:54.502
they don’t know they are committing a sin

06:54.793 --> 06:58.627
or they are disobeying some laws.

07:00.543 --> 07:06.126
They live with the laws that are built within them,

07:06.585 --> 07:11.084
that’s why they are called as pashus means bondage

07:11.418 --> 07:14.043
– the pasha. Pasha means the bondage.

07:14.460 --> 07:21.752
They are under the bondage of the laws of God.

07:26.543 --> 07:32.418
Shri Shiva is called as Pashupati.

07:32.792 --> 07:40.293
Up to that stage the innocence remains intact

07:43.001 --> 07:49.918
because there is no development of ego in them.

07:52.834 --> 07:55.251
So they are innocent.

07:55.627 --> 08:00.710
A tiger may eat a cow, still he is innocent

08:01.126 --> 08:03.543
or an elephant may trample

08:03.918 --> 08:10.210
over a human body, still he is innocent.

08:14.335 --> 08:20.876
But when going to a higher state,

08:23.627 --> 08:26.792
the Mother Shakti, the Primordial Mother thought

08:27.168 --> 08:30.752
of creating a personality

08:31.918 --> 08:38.251
who will protect the innocence of human beings.

08:38.752 --> 08:42.043
Above the matter, above the animals,

08:42.418 --> 08:46.834
She created Shri Ganesha.

08:47.418 --> 08:49.627
And you know the story of Shri Ganesha

08:50.001 --> 08:53.168
how He got the head of an elephant

08:53.668 --> 08:56.543
– symbolizing that Shri Ganesha,

08:56.918 --> 08:58.793
though He is a human being,

08:59.210 --> 09:03.084
He is like an animal as far as His head is concerned,

09:03.460 --> 09:09.001
that too of Shri Gajanana, in the sense that

09:09.418 --> 09:14.585
He has got the head of an elephant

09:14.959 --> 09:22.168
which is the wisest animal in the animal kingdom.

09:23.084 --> 09:28.502
So in such a head, which is innocent,

09:28.834 --> 09:30.668
ego cannot develop.

09:31.084 --> 09:35.959
There is no ego. It’s an ego-less state.

09:37.460 --> 09:46.251
But human beings were created in a different manner

09:48.418 --> 09:55.376
and when carbon was placed to create aminoacids,

09:57.376 --> 10:02.418
it also settled them in motion,

10:02.959 --> 10:07.876
a new type of evolution in human beings

10:08.460 --> 10:12.668
that at the Vishuddhi level human beings raised

10:12.959 --> 10:15.834
[his head] their heads like this.

10:16.335 --> 10:19.084
Animals’ heads are on the ground

10:19.752 --> 10:28.126
so the energy flows downward into Mother Earth

10:28.627 --> 10:31.834
but when man raised his head above,

10:32.293 --> 10:36.834
against the energy of gravity,

10:37.834 --> 10:44.710
then a new complication started in the energy flow

10:46.793 --> 10:49.793
and that is how at the Vishuddhi,

10:50.210 --> 10:55.752
a problem started where Kundalini

10:57.293 --> 10:59.752
could not

11:03.543 --> 11:05.418
nourish

11:05.792 --> 11:11.792
or look after that problematic Vishuddhi.

11:14.084 --> 11:17.918
The reason is when you raise your head

11:18.543 --> 11:20.710
from the Mother Earth,

11:21.126 --> 11:23.752
you remove yourself away

11:24.168 --> 11:28.335
from the natural power of Mother Earth.

11:29.834 --> 11:35.084
When you take your Vishuddhi upward like that,

11:37.210 --> 11:39.668
you see the result of that in this country

11:40.084 --> 11:45.043
which is the country of Vishuddhi Chakra,

11:46.168 --> 11:51.668
that you started going to machines which are against nature,

11:52.460 --> 11:54.834
extracting the nature,

11:55.543 --> 12:00.502
disturbing the nature by creating atomic bombs,

12:03.293 --> 12:07.834
by changing the atom, breaking it.

12:09.376 --> 12:12.502
That means you went against the nature itself

12:12.793 --> 12:16.293
by raising your head.

12:17.293 --> 12:20.585
But if it was done

12:23.793 --> 12:26.376
in complete surrender to God,

12:28.251 --> 12:32.710
with your bent head towards the Mother Earth,

12:33.126 --> 12:37.001
it would not have harmed you.

12:37.460 --> 12:45.668
But when you completely cut off yourself from that nature,

12:46.043 --> 12:50.793
which is so bountiful, which is so gracious.

12:51.293 --> 12:53.834
Yesterday you saw the beautiful pictures

12:54.210 --> 12:58.959
of the nature that surrounds you in this country.

12:59.834 --> 13:05.876
Such a rich country like America,

13:07.251 --> 13:12.084
without any gratitude towards its Creator

13:12.585 --> 13:15.251
raised its head upward

13:15.710 --> 13:20.959
– that’s how the Vishuddhi problem started coming up.

13:23.251 --> 13:29.418
In every walk of life, the whole social structure

13:29.876 --> 13:33.043
was built up to fight the nature,

13:33.460 --> 13:37.210
not to go along with the nature.

13:38.418 --> 13:44.043
So the first attack came on the innocence itself

13:45.376 --> 13:49.001
– on the Mooladhara itself.

13:49.543 --> 13:55.210
So the natural ways of Mooladhara were given up.

13:56.627 --> 14:04.834
Marriage system has been here much before Christ,

14:06.126 --> 14:13.668
much before Abraham, much before Moses

14:15.876 --> 14:26.126
and a sanctified marriage, which was blessed by the society,

14:28.793 --> 14:33.585
was acceptable since long.

14:34.543 --> 14:38.168
But man in his arrogance

14:38.585 --> 14:42.752
raised his voice against the marriage,

14:43.210 --> 14:50.793
against the natural way of leading a life of sanity.

14:52.376 --> 15:02.752
If it was natural to be the way people lead their private life,

15:03.793 --> 15:10.627
why do they get all kinds of diseases?

15:12.126 --> 15:15.793
If you are a natural person, you don’t get any diseases.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.502
Because you are anti-nature,

15:25.168 --> 15:27.293
that’s why

15:30.876 --> 15:34.543
in this country now many man and women were murdered

15:35.335 --> 15:37.418
for jealousy?

15:38.710 --> 15:41.418
If it was natural

15:42.376 --> 15:44.668
to be in love with ten men and ten women

15:46.460 --> 15:48.460
then why jealousy?

15:50.543 --> 15:55.752
You should be happy, it’s very natural.

15:58.752 --> 16:02.001
Because the head was raised at Vishuddhi Chakra

16:02.376 --> 16:07.959
without surrendering to Shri Krishna,

16:10.959 --> 16:22.543
anti-life, anti-biotic atmosphere started growing.

16:25.834 --> 16:31.834
And this kind of life has taken this great country,

16:32.335 --> 16:38.418
now to the brink of complete destruction.

16:40.168 --> 16:44.502
The attack of innocence

16:44.918 --> 16:50.502
is the greatest weakness of this country.

16:51.710 --> 17:00.752
Not to value the power of chastity and a chaste life

17:03.043 --> 17:10.418
is the biggest mistake that was created by the people

17:10.834 --> 17:15.876
who started all kinds of trends and fads.

17:16.418 --> 17:23.210
Ganesha is the root of Creation.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.627
When you go against Shri Ganesh

17:28.043 --> 17:32.876
you start losing your roots, you have no roots at all.

17:33.502 --> 17:37.918
Then you get drifted into anything stupid,

17:38.335 --> 17:43.210
anything new that comes up.

17:44.001 --> 17:51.502
So much so that a person like Freud was worshipped

17:52.376 --> 17:55.668
and they forgot Christ,

17:56.043 --> 17:59.834
who said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

18:00.335 --> 18:05.210
Ganesha to that level, that even the eyes have to be innocent.

18:05.668 --> 18:10.710
There should be no lust in your eyes.

18:13.543 --> 18:17.460
But arrogance

18:19.251 --> 18:21.210
made them feel, “What’s wrong?

18:22.126 --> 18:25.335
What’s wrong in this? What’s wrong in this?”

18:25.752 --> 18:33.418
Now the whole country is facing a great crisis

18:35.168 --> 18:42.251
because of arrogant enterprises.

18:44.959 --> 18:55.460
Still they make a martyrdom out of all that is destructive.

18:59.918 --> 19:04.959
It’s a very great responsibility on the Sahaja yogis

19:05.293 --> 19:10.543
who live on the land of Shri Ganesha.

19:10.959 --> 19:21.293
But for the people who live in the land of Shri Krishna,

19:21.710 --> 19:29.752
the responsibility is absolutely on your neck

19:31.502 --> 19:36.793
and you can’t get out of it.

19:38.792 --> 19:42.001
Unless and until you understand the importance

19:42.376 --> 19:45.585
of innocence in your life

19:45.959 --> 19:51.543
you cannot save this country whatever I may try to do for it.

19:51.959 --> 19:56.293
It’s only you who are going to save it.

19:56.793 --> 20:04.251
It’s only you who are going to make it.

20:07.126 --> 20:09.126
When the Kundalini rises

20:09.792 --> 20:12.793
Shri Ganesha is awakened in you,

20:13.752 --> 20:18.792
the Ganesha whom you never respected,

20:19.627 --> 20:27.834
slowly comes up from His slumber,

20:28.502 --> 20:33.168
out of the hurt and the injuries inflicted on Him,

20:33.502 --> 20:37.168
still He stands up.

20:37.834 --> 20:38.668
But still weak

20:42.876 --> 20:45.793
How are we going to nourish it?

20:46.251 --> 20:53.752
How are we going to look after its growth?

20:57.043 --> 21:04.543
The responsibility of Sahaja yogis of America is very great.

21:05.210 --> 21:10.293
They cannot cheat any more themselves.

21:10.752 --> 21:16.168
They cannot be satisfied with their arrogance.

21:16.627 --> 21:21.792
The mistakes have been grievous.

21:22.752 --> 21:27.460
So you have to take it up as a crusade

21:28.126 --> 21:30.293
against those mistakes

21:31.168 --> 21:35.918
and to establish your Shri Ganesha in a full form

21:36.543 --> 21:40.084
so that He gives you the necessary balance

21:40.084 --> 21:44.834
and the roots to nourish yourself.

21:45.668 --> 21:47.251
It is shocking first.

21:47.585 --> 21:50.793
I mean you just can’t understand;

21:51.668 --> 21:53.210
it is impossible

21:55.335 --> 22:00.710
to see how you could accept such absurd ideas;

22:04.043 --> 22:10.251
how you could take to such funny things,

22:13.834 --> 22:19.543
which are obviously horrid.

22:26.043 --> 22:30.585
Are we not aware of certain words like prostitution?

22:31.001 --> 22:32.959
And all other dirty words that they use,

22:33.335 --> 22:36.084
which I don’t want to say just now,

22:36.418 --> 22:41.251
or they have lost their meanings?

22:42.959 --> 22:48.918
We were all aware of it, we all knew about it.

22:49.627 --> 22:53.959
[Don’t do that … You should not.

22:54.418 --> 22:59.793
When I’m speaking must be quiet, all right?]

23:01.168 --> 23:06.752
Have we lost all wisdom from our minds

23:07.543 --> 23:10.752
that we cannot see

23:13.460 --> 23:16.210
what we have done to ourselves?

23:17.210 --> 23:21.834
We have no self-respect.

23:24.168 --> 23:30.376
Arrogance to that limit is very dangerous,

23:31.792 --> 23:37.418
extremely unpredictable.

23:37.918 --> 23:41.543
And God knows what can come through

23:41.876 --> 23:48.834
with all these ventures we have gone into.

23:52.210 --> 23:54.627
I would say for Sahaja yogis,

23:54.959 --> 24:00.502
I have given some instructions with people

24:00.876 --> 24:07.585
– how they should respect their privacy of life,

24:11.834 --> 24:15.793
specially the women of America.

24:16.502 --> 24:19.585
If they have to be the shaktis,

24:20.084 --> 24:26.668
they have to respect their chastity.

24:28.335 --> 24:37.418
But so surprising that when we see outside

24:37.918 --> 24:43.460
all these things happening, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

24:44.084 --> 24:51.335
some of us try to be one of them who are going to hell.

24:52.251 --> 24:54.710
If you have to save them,

24:55.168 --> 25:03.834
then try to fix your positions, properly.

25:05.418 --> 25:10.918
Shri Ganesha has four hands

25:12.335 --> 25:19.834
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

25:21.168 --> 25:26.585
is the one you have to be careful about.

25:31.627 --> 25:34.168
That is His job

25:36.959 --> 25:39.335
and if you neglect Him,

25:41.752 --> 25:44.168
that force will act

25:45.834 --> 25:48.668
and act so vehemently

25:49.293 --> 25:51.792
that despite your realization

25:52.168 --> 25:57.001
you may not be able to save yourself.

25:57.627 --> 26:00.668
Do not take your realization for granted.

26:01.084 --> 26:03.668
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

26:04.001 --> 26:07.335
your realization has no meaning at all.

26:07.918 --> 26:09.959
Watch yourself,

26:11.376 --> 26:14.502
have you got adulterous eyes?

26:18.585 --> 26:23.834
Have you got an adulterous mind?

26:27.460 --> 26:34.335
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

26:35.585 --> 26:39.084
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

26:39.502 --> 26:45.502
then you must get a good amount of health,

26:46.001 --> 26:47.792
money

26:51.251 --> 26:53.126
and position,

26:53.376 --> 26:55.210
power.

26:59.001 --> 27:06.335
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha,

27:06.710 --> 27:11.293
Nirmal Ganesha.

27:14.959 --> 27:20.293
“Oh, Mother, please give us

27:21.210 --> 27:26.793
the blessings of establishment of purity

27:27.752 --> 27:33.126
in our Ganesha principle.”

27:34.543 --> 27:36.043
In relationships,

27:41.084 --> 27:43.335
in attitudes,

27:47.043 --> 27:48.793
in behavior,

27:53.001 --> 27:57.585
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

28:01.710 --> 28:09.418
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

28:09.876 --> 28:15.210
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

28:16.126 --> 28:21.834
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

28:22.418 --> 28:26.627
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

28:27.084 --> 28:33.585
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

28:34.084 --> 28:39.210
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

28:39.668 --> 28:45.126
Everything that is done against Him after realization

28:46.126 --> 28:50.043
will tell upon you

28:53.043 --> 28:58.168
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

28:59.293 --> 29:03.376
as absolutely degraded people.

29:03.793 --> 29:07.792
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

29:08.210 --> 29:14.834
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

29:16.710 --> 29:19.126
Whatever you have done in the past is finished now

29:19.543 --> 29:22.210
because you are a new bird.

29:22.627 --> 29:25.668
But after becoming this,

29:26.168 --> 29:32.543
if you try to take to these wrong ideas

29:33.502 --> 29:42.001
or to indulge into them, I cannot help you at all.

29:45.585 --> 29:50.918
After all Shri Ganesha is My Son

29:52.502 --> 29:56.627
because He is pure.

29:59.001 --> 30:02.502
Now He is not the only son I have.

30:02.876 --> 30:06.001
I have so many sons and daughters

30:06.376 --> 30:08.834
and I have made you in the same way

30:08.834 --> 30:13.126
as I created Shri Ganesha, without the Father,

30:13.710 --> 30:16.793
on My own.

30:20.126 --> 30:24.460
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

30:24.793 --> 30:33.627
and purity of your body is going to please.

30:35.627 --> 30:39.376
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

30:39.752 --> 30:44.585
My name itself means purity.

30:45.918 --> 30:47.876
You can do it.

30:48.168 --> 30:49.793
You are empowered to do it.

30:50.126 --> 30:51.668
You have a Kundalini to do it.

30:52.001 --> 30:57.876
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

31:00.043 --> 31:02.668
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

31:03.001 --> 31:07.001
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

31:07.543 --> 31:12.793
One chakra you keep clean, the rest is looked after.

31:15.168 --> 31:21.168
All your incurable diseases right from

31:24.084 --> 31:28.126
all muscular troubles like mellitus and all that,

31:28.460 --> 31:33.460
all your incurable diseases right from cancer onwards,

31:35.792 --> 31:38.502
all your psychosomatic problems

31:40.376 --> 31:43.376
right from schizophrenia, everything

31:44.126 --> 31:48.293
come because of the disturbance in Mooladhara.

31:51.752 --> 31:54.668
When the roots are not all right,

31:56.084 --> 31:58.959
how can you cure the tree?

31:59.543 --> 32:01.335
If the roots are all right

32:01.792 --> 32:05.710
then any medicine can reach any center,

32:06.376 --> 32:10.585
any area, any place, any fruit.

32:12.376 --> 32:15.001
But if the roots are not all right,

32:16.293 --> 32:18.502
how can you work it out?

32:20.959 --> 32:23.627
Today you have called Me here,

32:23.959 --> 32:28.834
to worship Shri Ganesha, within Me.

32:31.668 --> 32:37.793
Shri Ganesha within Me is a powerful identity.

32:39.585 --> 32:45.168
While worshipping Him you have to know

32:46.460 --> 32:52.043
that such a powerful thing

32:52.585 --> 32:56.543
you have to establish within yourself

32:58.126 --> 33:00.918
and by that establishment

33:03.460 --> 33:12.251
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

33:16.627 --> 33:19.668
and the power of Shri Ganesha’s

33:21.834 --> 33:26.084
greatness is auspiciousness.

33:31.001 --> 33:35.710
It’s a coefficience;

33:36.792 --> 33:41.876
it’s a formula, we can say in scientific language,

33:42.585 --> 33:48.543
that emits auspiciousness.

33:53.876 --> 34:00.418
It’s a magnet in the Mother Earth.

34:01.585 --> 34:05.502
The same magnet is within you,

34:05.834 --> 34:07.793
which is Shri Ganesha.

34:08.084 --> 34:10.543
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

34:10.834 --> 34:18.168
which is the north, south, east, west.

34:18.834 --> 34:21.793
Close My eyes, still I’ll tell you.

34:22.210 --> 34:25.168
You know there are so many birds who fly out

34:25.543 --> 34:28.460
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

34:28.793 --> 34:30.918
because they have that magnet with them,

34:31.251 --> 34:33.251
they have that innocence with them.

34:33.668 --> 34:35.126
There are so many fishes,

34:35.502 --> 34:40.418
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

34:41.335 --> 34:43.627
Scientists should find out.

34:44.043 --> 34:51.918
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

34:52.668 --> 35:01.460
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

35:02.668 --> 35:03.460
becomes magnetic

35:12.918 --> 35:19.084
and magnet attracts the steel

35:20.335 --> 35:25.668
– not dried leaves, does not – steel.

35:26.126 --> 35:29.585
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

35:30.001 --> 35:33.627
Is a man with the steel, say.

35:34.084 --> 35:40.293
“Man of steel” – a person who has character, conviction

35:40.792 --> 35:45.418
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

35:45.793 --> 35:49.335
is a man of steel.

35:49.793 --> 35:58.001
So this magnet attracts the steel.

35:58.710 --> 36:05.376
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

36:06.834 --> 36:13.001
not pliable, it’s rather dry

36:15.418 --> 36:19.168
but the magnet attracts, means

36:20.543 --> 36:25.460
it creates that special quality in the steel

36:27.084 --> 36:30.210
that it moves towards the magnet.

36:35.293 --> 36:39.418
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

36:39.918 --> 36:42.834
you’ll be amazed.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.543
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

36:45.918 --> 36:47.627
they’ll be running towards you.

36:48.043 --> 36:52.335
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

36:53.084 --> 36:57.793
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

36:58.502 --> 37:03.752
– anywhere, any place.

37:04.126 --> 37:08.585
So what is this magnet?

37:09.376 --> 37:13.001
Is pure love.

37:13.710 --> 37:16.084
Is pure love

37:16.502 --> 37:21.210
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn’t depend

37:21.668 --> 37:25.460
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

37:25.876 --> 37:30.043
It is the support of itself.

37:30.668 --> 37:34.210
It’s like light that spreads just by its own nature,

37:34.668 --> 37:35.918
doesn’t want anything,

37:36.293 --> 37:38.126
doesn’t expect anything.

37:38.585 --> 37:44.210
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people’s hearts.

37:44.627 --> 37:50.502
That’s why they get attracted.

37:53.752 --> 37:56.168
Those who have not even seen Me,

37:56.668 --> 37:59.502
those who have not even known Me,

38:00.418 --> 38:02.543
just with My name, I’ve seen,

38:03.376 --> 38:07.084
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

38:07.668 --> 38:09.543
that they said, “We have to call the police”.

38:09.834 --> 38:11.585
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

38:11.793 --> 38:13.460
we'll manage somehow.”

38:13.710 --> 38:15.251
In Poona we had such crowds

38:15.251 --> 38:18.793
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

38:18.876 --> 38:22.376
He said, “Mother, I’ll give You very big area

38:22.668 --> 38:24.918
where You can sit down in a big open place

38:25.668 --> 38:28.668
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished.”

38:28.918 --> 38:31.876
I said, “You don’t worry,

38:32.335 --> 38:34.918
everything will be in proper place.”

38:35.335 --> 38:38.710
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

38:39.084 --> 38:43.668
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

38:44.084 --> 38:50.084
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

38:50.502 --> 38:53.335
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

38:53.668 --> 38:55.460
Just like a picture.

38:55.876 --> 38:59.752
No movement of hand, feet, eyes – nothing.

39:00.084 --> 39:04.168
Just sitting like a picture.

39:04.710 --> 39:07.959
And the gentleman who owned that hall

39:08.418 --> 39:12.460
had never seen such a thing before.

39:13.001 --> 39:15.710
Throughout for one and half hour,

39:16.627 --> 39:19.168
no movement of any kind.

39:22.251 --> 39:26.376
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

39:26.876 --> 39:31.710
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

39:32.126 --> 39:34.460
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

39:34.876 --> 39:39.543
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

39:39.876 --> 39:45.168
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

39:45.792 --> 39:56.168
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

39:57.418 --> 39:59.168
A child, there’s one child,

39:59.543 --> 40:03.001
everybody is attracted towards the child.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.876
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

40:08.418 --> 40:13.418
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

40:13.876 --> 40:16.084
everybody would be worried about the child.

40:16.543 --> 40:17.710
What’s happening to the child?

40:18.084 --> 40:23.001
They will not think: it’s an Arab child or an American child, no.

40:23.502 --> 40:28.043
Unless and until it’s a devil.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.418
Why this attraction for children?

40:31.834 --> 40:33.376
Because their magnets are intact.

40:33.793 --> 40:35.918
Their ego has not yet developed.

40:36.335 --> 40:39.376
Our ego developed, had to develop

40:39.793 --> 40:43.792
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

40:44.168 --> 40:47.460
what is right and what is wrong.

40:47.918 --> 40:49.918
So the ego developed was all right.

40:50.335 --> 40:54.084
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

40:54.627 --> 40:58.668
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

40:59.001 --> 41:00.959
overlapped the superego also.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.793
No conditioning, nothing.

41:04.335 --> 41:06.210
We’ll do whatever we like.

41:06.585 --> 41:08.752
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

41:09.126 --> 41:12.043
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

41:12.418 --> 41:16.210
Then we’ll cut our hair or we’ll do this, we’ll do that.

41:16.792 --> 41:18.710
No conditioning of any kind.

41:19.126 --> 41:24.418
All superego was also covered – ego.

41:26.543 --> 41:31.293
This ego would have been all right

41:31.792 --> 41:36.251
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

41:36.876 --> 41:42.251
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

41:42.752 --> 41:48.834
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

41:49.502 --> 41:54.918
If you see a farmer and a big professor

41:55.376 --> 41:59.210
or a very well educated man

41:59.668 --> 42:01.792
and talk to both of them. You’ll find the farmer

42:02.084 --> 42:09.792
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

42:10.959 --> 42:14.043
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

42:14.502 --> 42:16.126
He knows the living process.

42:16.585 --> 42:21.918
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

42:23.001 --> 42:28.251
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

42:28.710 --> 42:35.335
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

42:35.792 --> 42:40.543
ten ego-oriented people.

42:42.792 --> 42:47.918
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

42:48.376 --> 42:52.918
is that you become a wise person.

42:53.293 --> 42:56.834
When you speak, people start looking at you.

42:57.210 --> 43:02.001
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

43:02.543 --> 43:13.710
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

43:15.084 --> 43:18.752
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

43:19.084 --> 43:22.918
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

43:23.418 --> 43:26.585
is good for nothing.

43:26.918 --> 43:29.918
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

43:30.293 --> 43:33.959
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

43:34.460 --> 43:36.585
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

43:36.918 --> 43:39.585
and hitting that person.

43:40.001 --> 43:42.418
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

43:42.793 --> 43:44.543
they say, “That bull, the same bull”.

43:44.959 --> 43:46.668
Everybody reports about the same bull.

43:47.126 --> 43:51.710
“Oh, that’s the one, all right.”

43:54.752 --> 43:59.793
So it grants you wisdom.

44:01.335 --> 44:04.543
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

44:04.959 --> 44:07.168
your eyes are radiant.

44:07.627 --> 44:12.126
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

44:12.752 --> 44:15.460
when He is enlightening you;

44:15.834 --> 44:25.585
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

44:26.210 --> 44:29.418
But this glance is so powerful

44:29.792 --> 44:33.126
that even one glance is sufficient

44:33.585 --> 44:38.502
to purify thousands of people.

44:40.251 --> 44:44.792
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

44:45.460 --> 44:49.293
and you find whole thing changes

44:49.792 --> 44:52.959
into a beautiful morning

44:53.376 --> 44:59.460
from a complete dark night.

45:03.668 --> 45:07.627
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

45:08.543 --> 45:11.668
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

45:12.084 --> 45:16.668
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

45:17.251 --> 45:21.168
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

45:21.752 --> 45:30.126
He has to certify, “All right. Pass. Go,” on every chakra.

45:30.834 --> 45:32.793
And when the Kundalini rises,

45:33.210 --> 45:39.001
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

45:39.543 --> 45:41.460
But then when He sleeps down,

45:41.834 --> 45:47.001
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

45:52.126 --> 45:54.460
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

45:54.834 --> 45:58.793
That’s not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

45:59.376 --> 46:06.876
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

46:07.335 --> 46:13.834
with something that cannot allow

46:14.335 --> 46:18.376
Shri Ganesha’s principle to manifest in us.

46:18.876 --> 46:23.251
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

46:23.792 --> 46:28.585
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

46:30.710 --> 46:35.084
That’s all, but it never dies.

46:35.627 --> 46:42.710
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

46:47.834 --> 46:52.168
The another quality of a person who is endowed

46:52.752 --> 46:56.418
with Shri Ganesha’s powers is that

46:56.834 --> 46:59.376
He removes all the hurdles.

46:59.752 --> 47:05.460
If one person of this nature is in some place,

47:05.959 --> 47:08.335
all the rest of the people who are nearby

47:08.752 --> 47:13.210
will be saved if there’s an accident or if there’s any problem,

47:13.792 --> 47:19.210
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

47:25.418 --> 47:28.792
You will find this happening.

47:29.168 --> 47:36.168
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

47:36.834 --> 47:39.959
He guides you.

47:40.460 --> 47:43.293
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

47:43.668 --> 47:46.585
He is the one who is Sahaja.

47:47.001 --> 47:51.418
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

47:51.918 --> 47:54.376
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

47:54.793 --> 47:58.001
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

47:58.502 --> 48:01.543
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

48:01.918 --> 48:09.710
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

48:11.793 --> 48:17.752
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

48:18.293 --> 48:25.959
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

48:28.001 --> 48:29.793
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

48:30.251 --> 48:32.834
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

48:33.293 --> 48:35.001
because all the Gods and Goddesses

48:35.460 --> 48:39.668
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

48:40.084 --> 48:42.001
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

48:42.502 --> 48:43.752
He knows,

48:44.168 --> 48:53.876
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

48:54.752 --> 48:57.792
To have all the powers of the world,

48:58.168 --> 49:02.792
just keep the Mother pleased.

49:05.793 --> 49:08.959
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

49:09.335 --> 49:11.418
which can be described.

49:11.834 --> 49:18.834
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

49:21.460 --> 49:28.001
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

49:28.460 --> 49:30.792
but He is the one who will tell you

49:31.168 --> 49:34.668
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

49:35.168 --> 49:39.293
That means He gives you the taste of love

49:39.834 --> 49:42.834
in the food that is cooked for you.

49:43.376 --> 49:47.084
Because He is love.

49:48.251 --> 49:54.251
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.

49:55.752 --> 49:58.376
Once they asked Me to sing a song.

49:58.792 --> 50:00.792
I used to sing very well once upon a time

50:01.251 --> 50:03.043
but then after lecturing so many times,

50:03.585 --> 50:05.502
you see I think I lost My voice.

50:05.918 --> 50:08.126
I couldn’t sing well, I thought so.

50:08.627 --> 50:11.418
One day they asked Me to sing a song

50:11.918 --> 50:17.126
and I thought of some song and sang to them.

50:17.876 --> 50:23.001
And after a year or so in a program they said,

50:23.418 --> 50:25.543
“Mother we want to sing You a song.”

50:25.918 --> 50:29.084
This was a song unknown to everyone,

50:29.710 --> 50:31.752
I don’t know from where they got it,

50:32.251 --> 50:33.918
from where they made the tune.

50:34.335 --> 50:37.793
They started singing the same song.

50:38.293 --> 50:43.043
And such joy, I mean, it all became waves of tears

50:43.460 --> 50:47.126
in My eyes. I couldn’t control My joy.

50:47.627 --> 50:52.502
Now all this feeling of joy

50:53.293 --> 50:58.710
comes from the devices produced by Shri Ganesha.

50:59.126 --> 51:05.418
He is busy creating relationships, beautiful.

51:05.793 --> 51:10.460
How? In a birthday, a child’s birthday, what do we say?

51:10.834 --> 51:13.543
“All right, so tomorrow morning

51:13.918 --> 51:18.084
there’s a bird is going to drop a present for you.”

51:19.084 --> 51:21.834
And then the child gets up and sees there’s no bird.

51:22.335 --> 51:24.376
It’s only Ganesha who has given the idea.

51:24.876 --> 51:29.585
We can say He is a Santa Claus.

51:30.293 --> 51:33.792
He gives you ways and methods and He tells you

51:34.293 --> 51:39.668
how to delicately build up relationships, pure relationships.

51:46.834 --> 51:51.627
How you hide, how you wrap a little present,

51:51.959 --> 51:58.460
just put it there and a person who has to take it, sees it,

51:59.084 --> 52:03.084
“Oh God.” And then you see that flowers

52:03.585 --> 52:06.876
which you suddenly bring out, you put them,

52:07.335 --> 52:13.168
is all Shri Ganesha’s efforts, His ways, His suggestions.

52:14.418 --> 52:20.251
Among the creation, flowers are expressing

52:20.668 --> 52:24.084
Shri Ganesha’s essence.

52:24.502 --> 52:25.959
And the essence of Shri Ganesha

52:26.418 --> 52:33.543
comes from the Mother Earth’s essence, is the fragrance.

52:35.418 --> 52:40.126
So a person who is endowed

52:40.792 --> 52:44.792
with Shri Ganesha’s blessings has fragrance,

52:45.251 --> 52:50.793
sometimes chandan, sometime roses,

52:51.418 --> 52:57.293
sometimes these gardenia.

52:57.959 --> 53:01.627
You just don’t know from where the fragrance is coming.

53:02.001 --> 53:07.627
The fragrance is coming from Shri Ganesh

53:08.793 --> 53:14.543
and that is what is the magnet within you.

53:15.918 --> 53:22.251
Such a person is fragrant, absolutely fragrant all the time.

53:24.418 --> 53:31.876
Shri Ganesha emits all kinds of fragrance from such a person.

53:37.084 --> 53:43.959
And that you can only feel when your Shri Ganesha is all right.

53:47.543 --> 53:52.752
There’s no end to the description of this great Deity within you.

53:53.126 --> 53:56.543
He’s just settled down there, He’s all the time there,

53:57.001 --> 54:01.585
waiting to be cleansed out, for Him to raise His head,

54:02.043 --> 54:05.293
like a lotus in the mud.

54:05.792 --> 54:08.460
You just help it out by respecting it

54:08.918 --> 54:12.126
and He’ll be there, fragrant within you.

54:12.627 --> 54:16.168
So important for this country

54:16.710 --> 54:25.210
where we have raised our head without surrendering

54:25.792 --> 54:34.418
it to the Virata, to the collectivity, to Shri Krishna.

54:34.959 --> 54:38.126
We have raised our head,

54:38.627 --> 54:42.959
with Shri Ganesha we bow down our head,

54:43.460 --> 54:48.502
for all the bounties that God has bestowed upon us.

54:49.001 --> 54:50.585
All arrogance will disappear at the

54:51.084 --> 54:53.376
Lotus Feet of Shri Ganesha.

54:53.585 --> 54:55.793
He’ll give us wisdom.

54:56.293 --> 54:58.460
He’ll give us sense to understand.

54:58.792 --> 55:01.418
He’ll give us power to overcome our arrogance

55:01.793 --> 55:03.210
that is within us.

55:04.001 --> 55:08.418
He’s the one who is the giver of knowledge.

55:08.918 --> 55:11.043
He’s the one who is give us light.

55:11.543 --> 55:13.918
Many people in India also worship Shri Ganesha,

55:14.376 --> 55:17.502
go on “Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha,

55:18.001 --> 55:23.834
and do all kinds of funny things.

55:24.460 --> 55:28.918
That’s like cheating yourself unnecessarily.

55:29.502 --> 55:33.585
It’s so simple to establish Shri Ganesha within you.

55:34.043 --> 55:40.918
But understand that it is vital

55:41.585 --> 55:45.460
that you people who are Sahaja yogis

55:46.001 --> 55:49.376
should establish Shri Ganesha,

55:49.918 --> 55:53.001
which is a silent power within you, doesn’t talk.

55:53.543 --> 55:57.834
It’s a silent power, which acts.

55:58.502 --> 56:02.834
Just a power that’s dynamic

56:03.418 --> 56:09.918
without any noise, without any show.

56:11.210 --> 56:15.792
And that is what I would say that today

56:16.210 --> 56:22.251
when I have said all these things from My heart,

56:22.793 --> 56:28.210
you the Sahaja yogis will establish Shri Ganesha within you.

56:28.668 --> 56:33.793
And from you, you will emit such powers

56:34.293 --> 56:38.418
that others will be able to establish

56:38.793 --> 56:42.126
their Shri Ganesha in this country.

56:42.792 --> 56:43.668
May God bless you.

59:08.293 --> 59:09.834
We’ll call her as Gauri.

59:10.335 --> 59:14.710
Today is Ganesha’s day so Gauri is the name.

01:00:07.376 --> 01:00:08.084
Hello.

01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:45.335
Now on a Diwali day to worship Shri Ganesha

01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:48.710
and also Shri Lakshmi on that day,

01:00:49.126 --> 01:00:53.043
so today as we are worshipping Shri Ganesha also,

01:00:53.502 --> 01:00:55.210
we have to worship Shri Lakshmi,

01:00:55.627 --> 01:00:58.251
so I’ll call her as Lakshmi today.

01:00:58.585 --> 01:01:02.793
All right? Thank you.

01:01:15.001 --> 01:01:22.418
Look at this little baby, doesn’t cry. You’re such a big girl.

01:01:39.293 --> 01:01:41.752
But see the little babies do not cry.

01:01:42.084 --> 01:01:43.959
You’re a big girl …why are you crying?

01:01:44.376 --> 01:01:47.001
And what are you wearing on your feet? Let Me see.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.627
Do they make a noise?

01:01:51.001 --> 01:01:51.752
No?

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.293
So we can get you better ones.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:56.210
Let Me see how big your feet are.

01:01:56.627 --> 01:01:59.710
Let Me see. They’re very small, aren’t they.

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:02.502
You are a big girl or a small girl?

01:02:02.918 --> 01:02:07.084
Small? No, no, she’s big, she can stand up, let's see?

01:02:07.502 --> 01:02:14.752
Let’s see. Hallo. Come along, come here.

01:02:22.793 --> 01:02:25.792
What’s the matter with her?

01:02:26.335 --> 01:02:30.710
She always like this?

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:33.668
We’ll call her Siddhi. This is the power.

01:02:34.043 --> 01:02:36.043
Siddhi is a good name.

01:02:49.001 --> 01:02:52.668
All right. May God bless you.

01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:54.585
She’ll be all right.

01:03:19.834 --> 01:03:24.251
Look at that. Take a picture.

01:03:24.502 --> 01:03:28.793
May God bless you. May God bless you.

01:03:29.168 --> 01:03:32.376
Get up now. All right.

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:36.168
You must get up. Come here. Come here. Aah.

01:03:36.543 --> 01:03:38.210
So now we’ll call him as Vinayaka.

01:03:38.543 --> 01:03:43.668
That’s the name of Shri Ganesha, Vinayaka.

01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:55.126
Who else is there?

01:04:00.126 --> 01:04:01.460
Come along.

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:30.335
Hello. We’ll call him Ganapati.

01:05:02.418 --> 01:05:04.918
May God bless you.

01:05:05.792 --> 01:05:12.585
Come here. We’ll call them as Gauri and Ganesha.

01:05:16.876 --> 01:05:20.834
Gauri and Ganesha.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.126
Can you come?

01:05:44.585 --> 01:05:50.293
Ganesha’s another name is Omkara. We’ll call him Omkara.

01:05:52.418 --> 01:05:55.668
May God bless you.

01:05:57.543 --> 01:06:01.502
Come here. Good. You are Omkara now. All right?

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:06.168
Good name, Omkara.

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.335
So now...

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:53.876
Ramma. Ramma is name of the Devi, name of Parvati.

01:07:01.834 --> 01:07:05.918
Is the name of the Mother of Ganesha, Ramma.

01:07:06.376 --> 01:07:16.210
Ramma is the one that plays in the heart.

01:07:22.418 --> 01:07:24.210
Janaki. Janaki.

01:08:29.084 --> 01:08:31.876
Sharmila, Sharmadayini, Sharmila, Sharmadayani

01:08:37.710 --> 01:08:39.210
Sharmadayani is the bliss-giver.

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:43.502
Giver of bliss. Giver of bliss.

01:08:55.251 --> 01:08:56.918
Sharmila is the name of the Goddess.

01:08:57.418 --> 01:09:00.376
She’s the giver of bliss, Sharmadayani,

01:09:00.752 --> 01:09:03.834
is the giver of bliss. May God bless you.

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:36.502
You can come here just to help with the puja.
