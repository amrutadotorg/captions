1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,160
The first power that you get is that you become,

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,200
your awareness becomes collectively conscious,

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,240
that you can feel another person\hon your fingertips,

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,480
that means\hyou become absolutely aware.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,800
Like, I went today to Mexico

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,280
and I could feel\h the whole country.

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,440
I knew about it before,

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,200
but my attention was not so deeply there.

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,200
I\hcould feel the whole country has a very bad left side problem

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and the left side\hproblem is affecting even this area.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,600
And the left side problem, you can feel it very clearly

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,200
that your left side becomes heavy

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,160
and you feel the heat in all your\hcenters.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,960
So, you start feeling the atmosphere,

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,520
the country, the\hpeople and individual and yourself.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,320
So, you know the problem of a particular place.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,920
I\hmean you may not feel that much, in the beginning,

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,800
you may just feel yourself to begin with.

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,440
Then you start feeling others.

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,160
So, thus the awareness grows more and more.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:51,160
In the central nervous system, you start feeling the problems of other people,

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,280
your own problems.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,760
But it is not that you feel them as something, which is painful or troublesome,

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,840
but you feel them as little heat

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,560
or sometimes little pain, very little,

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,720
as\hif you are recording it like a barometer.

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,720
And when that happens you want to get rid of it,

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,120
as if they are your own problem,

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,320
and if you know how to get rid of it, you can do it.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,600
That’s what I was doing and that’s how I’m late,

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,320
something on the collective.

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,600
If you\hare working on something you want to finish the job

33
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,240
and then you want to attend to another.

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,800
Don’t want to leave something half done.

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,920
For human beings, it is difficult in the beginning,

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,520
because from human awareness you are rising to super humaness

37
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,160
or you can call it to super awareness,

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,800
into a subtler awareness.

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:17,000
So, first the awareness\his gross and then your awareness becomes subtler.

40
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,520
But with that, you do not fell in\hany way uncomfortable

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,840
or upset,\hbecause you become extremely\hpowerful.

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Such power of compassion,\h\hthat you don’t feel anything,

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:43,600
no pain, no\hproblems, the illusions disappear completely.

44
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,400
There’s no more illusion in the mind.

45
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:57,360
Like, people say that when you face something you are filled with the greed,

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,520
or\hgreed or lust.

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,880
But when your eyes become pure, there is no greed or lust.

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:14,040
But what happens, that you start feeling the oneness

49
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,920
with another thing, whatever it is,

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,920
in a way\hthat it is joy giving.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,480
Like, you see someone, an attractive person,

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,680
there is no sensation\hof baser feelings for that person.

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,000
But the sensation just disappears

54
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,400
and you start feeling the joy

55
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,520
of the creation of that person or the thing.

56
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,120
Like in Mexico, people have made so many things with hand.

57
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,000
If you watch them, you might think,

58
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,600
"How much it will cost? what will be the price? Who has made it?"

59
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,240
But if there is no thought, then you see something,

60
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,960
which looks very\hjoyous,

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,320
because you can feel the vibrations.

62
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,400
And you know somebody has made it, who might have been a Realized soul,

63
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,480
who might have been a very great devotee of God,

64
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,440
might have been a person who must have thought that, “This is your creation, oh God.”

65
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,600
Such a person might have made, with that\hfeeling

66
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,040
which is to be gratified, and you feel\hthat, "We should take it".

67
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
The matter has only one\hcapacity

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,560
that it gives joy in giving to others,

69
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,760
so that you can express your happiness into it.

70
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,520
So, you become very subtly aware of the matter,

71
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,760
that you start understanding the matter, what it means

72
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,560
and what is the use of a particular thing.

73
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,120
In the same way, when you meet people,

74
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,200
new people, absolutely never known,

75
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,720
you know what are their needs,

76
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,000
what\hproblems they have,

77
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,680
on a wider scale, on a collective scale,

78
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,800
and also you know one\hsimple thing

79
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,680
that there are people in Mexico,

80
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,080
who are seeking God, who are to be helped,

81
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,440
who are to be given something that they want.

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,960
They may not be so much aware of it.

83
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,080
But we become aware of them.

84
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,400
And a kind of a rapport of a very subtle type is established

85
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:05,320
and you get attracted towards other people not through any lust or greed or any purpose

86
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:13,040
but in oneness with the joy that they have within themselves,

87
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,320
the joy of the Spirit.

88
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:27,160
You look at them and you feel, “This person is such a wonderful person”.

89
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:34,160
How do you know? You start feeling the cool vibrations in your hand from that person.

90
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,080
And you just enjoy that person for that person’s sake,

91
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,840
not for anything, whether poor, rich,

92
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,400
good looking, bad looking, doesn’t matter.

93
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,360
You approach the Spirit of another person because you have become the Spirit.

94
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,920
People talk of big things, of organizing peace missions,

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,920
this mission, that mission, to create a better relationship.

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,760
All relationships,\hwhich are at a gross level create problems,

97
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,000
because there is some sort of a lurking selfishness behind it.

98
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,873
But once it becomes the spiritual
relationship you just enjoy the other person

99
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:25,480
without getting into any discussion about what is your gain,

100
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:35,360
what is you are going to achieve
through going nearer to that personality.

101
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,914
Thus you become the receiver of the\hjoy.
