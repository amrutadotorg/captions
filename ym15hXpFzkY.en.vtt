SHRI GANESHA PUJA
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:08.276
September 13, 2003

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:23.779
Now we are facing little children.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:32.658
They are the ones who are incarnations.

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:40.090
They are the ones who are going to lead humanity

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.254
into some great advancement.

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:55.037
The humanity has to be looked after.

00:00:55.453 --> 00:01:01.245
They are tomorrow's humanity. And we are today's.

00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:08.285
And what are we giving to them for them to follow?

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:13.193
What is their aim in life?

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:18.262
Very, very difficult to say.

00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:26.823
But with the Sahaja Yoga they will all go in the proper way.

00:01:27.326 --> 00:01:30.352
They'll behave in a proper way

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:32.887
and the whole thing will be

00:01:33.087 --> 00:01:39.197
a different mass of Sahaja Yogis coming up.

00:01:39.397 --> 00:01:45.658
But it is the duty of bigger Sahaja Yogis to look after them;

00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:48.691
to have better moral standards,

00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:51.233
to have better lives

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:54.544
so that they follow your life

00:01:54.744 --> 00:02:01.181
and become genuinely good Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:04.187
It's a very big responsibility. Perhaps

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:09.387
we don't recognize it, we don't understand,

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:14.696
but all these are little creatures

00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:25.482
which are after the image of great souls

00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:28.716
and they should be brought up in that way,

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.124
respected in that manner

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:39.390
and loved with great care. This is to be understood.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.676
The problem with our elderly people is this,

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:47.919
that we do not consider them

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:53.234
to be considered, to be bothered about,

00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:55.360
to be understood about.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.482
We think we are too intelligent, too good

00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:03.142
and we need not waste our energy with them.

00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:07.024
This is the trouble of the elderly people.

00:03:07.224 --> 00:03:14.689
But today when we are sitting here to worship Shri Ganesha

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.171
we should know they are all Incarnations of Shri Ganesha

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:23.378
and they should be given proper attention,

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:28.069
proper understanding, about themselves.

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.228
I find certain amount of children who are very well-behaved,

00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:38.019
which are very sensible,

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:44.142
and there are some who have no idea as to what they are doing.

00:03:44.342 --> 00:03:50.541
So it is the duty of the elders to put ideas into their head,

00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:53.887
to proper understanding about themselves

00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:56.601
and  the self-respect.

00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:03.237
Same thing I would say for the elder Sahaja Yogis

00:04:03.437 --> 00:04:07.937
who have to look after their younger brothers and sisters.

00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:14.210
In this family of ours which we call as Sahaja Yogis

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.666
there are all kinds of people, all types, all behaviors.

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:24.086
Of course they should not be regimented,

00:04:24.286 --> 00:04:28.141
there should not be uniformity,

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:31.923
but in that variety there should be this beauty,

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:39.624
there should be beautiful trend of being one with each other.

00:04:39.824 --> 00:04:42.336
For that what should we do

00:04:42.536 --> 00:04:44.441
is the problem.

00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:49.042
What should the elders do to achieve that?

00:04:49.242 --> 00:04:57.369
What is our solid contribution to their lives?

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:08.777
The first will be to tell them who is Shri Ganesha,

00:05:09.944 --> 00:05:14.881
and that what are the qualities of Ganesha,

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.765
what does He represent.

00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:23.705
What does He represent? What qualities He has.

00:05:23.905 --> 00:05:26.670
And once they start understanding,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.888
that though being a little boy,

00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:36.764
He's so generous, He's so kind, He's so forgiving,

00:05:36.964 --> 00:05:42.193
they'll be amazed because they are also small

00:05:42.393 --> 00:05:47.834
and they'll also take to that kind of life.

00:05:48.034 --> 00:05:54.243
I find some children very sensible, very good here.

00:05:54.443 --> 00:05:56.479
Some are naughty,

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:00.399
and some don't understand what we are doing here.

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.156
Whatever it is, they are after all children.

00:06:05.356 --> 00:06:07.419
And what you have to do

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:14.165
is to look after them,  respect them, and give them

00:06:14.365 --> 00:06:19.699
the  full idea about Shri Ganesha.

00:06:20.362 --> 00:06:28.110
I think everybody must have a statue of Shri Ganesha in your house

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.652
so the children will see it and ask,

00:06:30.852 --> 00:06:33.804
"Who is He? What is He doing?"

00:06:34.004 --> 00:06:38.025
And you will be amazed  how they will understand Him,

00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:40.847
how they will understand His qualities

00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:43.879
and how they will work it out.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:46.754
It is important for all of you

00:06:46.954 --> 00:06:51.425
to have at least one Shri Ganesha in your house,

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:54.185
so that you can tell your children

00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:57.807
that "You all have to become like Him."

00:06:58.007 --> 00:07:02.503
Now what are the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

00:07:02.703 --> 00:07:06.774
They won't understand chastity, they are too small.

00:07:06.974 --> 00:07:10.509
They won't understand all those qualities.

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:17.091
But one quality they will understand is to be honest,

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:20.291
is to be honest.

00:08:00.802 --> 00:08:06.718
Gradually you will find all difficult ones will go down.

00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:09.638
It will work out that way.

00:08:09.838 --> 00:08:15.490
Because you see they don't understand My lecture,

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.717
they don't understand what I am saying.

00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:24.548
But one thing is there.
If there are some oppositions within,

00:08:24.748 --> 00:08:28.392
they will show - show very well -

00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:32.930
because they are so innocent and so simple,

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:40.713
their innocence will help them,  to expose them to reality.

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:45.574
I hope you all look after your children,

00:08:45.774 --> 00:08:48.216
guide them properly

00:08:48.416 --> 00:08:55.015
and take them to a level of understanding

00:08:55.215 --> 00:09:01.264
that they understand what is their position,

00:09:01.464 --> 00:09:04.121
what qualities they should have,

00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:06.934
why will they be respected.

00:09:07.134 --> 00:09:13.677
You'll be amazed, that their behavior will change

00:09:13.877 --> 00:09:18.157
the behavior of all the other children.

00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:26.501
What I have to say that nobody should think that

00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:31.902
because you can keep quiet, sit quietly and all that.

00:09:32.102 --> 00:09:35.202
You are grown-up only if you can

00:09:35.402 --> 00:09:39.049
imbibe the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:43.817
I have seen people who are very grown-up still do not have

00:09:44.017 --> 00:09:51.398
simple qualities of chastity, of honesty

00:09:51.598 --> 00:09:55.286
- they don't have, and they can't have,

00:09:55.486 --> 00:09:58.764
because they don't think it is important.

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:06.463
So I leave it to you to find out Shri Ganesha within yourself.

00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:34.216
I enjoy their company because they're so innocent,

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:37.152
and so simple hearted,

00:10:37.352 --> 00:10:42.144
and I like them very, very much.

00:10:51.415 --> 00:10:56.200
So you should not get afraid  or frightened

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.291
of their mischief.

00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:05.142
On the contrary, you should know they deserve much more love,

00:11:05.342 --> 00:11:12.175
much more understanding and much more scope to grow.

00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:15.865
I hope by the time they will be of your age,

00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:18.833
they'll be great Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:22.250
They'll understand what we are doing here.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:29.819
I had to face mountains of nonsense with the older people,

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:32.527
but these won't have that.

00:11:32.727 --> 00:11:40.650
They'll be very simple  very sweet and they'll understand love.

00:11:42.132 --> 00:11:46.443
So I would say we can allow these children to go out and play

00:11:46.643 --> 00:11:48.746
and somebody can look after them

00:11:48.946 --> 00:11:52.256
so that you'll be at peace.

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.380
Who can take them out?
