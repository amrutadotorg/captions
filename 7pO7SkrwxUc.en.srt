1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:15,809
…and how it resides within us and how we
are lost in the curtains of Maya.

2
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:23,609
Today I am going to tell you how we get to
that Spirit.

3
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:39,540
There are two types of methods people employ
in finding out that Spirit.

4
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,480
One is called as anuvopai, and another one
is called as shaktopai.

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,040
‘Anu’ means a molecule.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:07,900
When we are lost in the Maya, as I had told
you last time, actually the Spirit is eternal,

7
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,170
It is all-powerful.

8
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:18,509
It never loses Its power whether we are old,
young, whatever condition we may be, the Spirit

9
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,140
has Its own power, all the time.

10
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:32,060
But, the reflection of the Spirit in us, the
light of the Spirit in us, depends on the

11
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,560
quality of our reflector, how we are.

12
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:46,259
And because of the quality being so poor sometimes,
darkness is created within us and in that

13
00:01:46,259 --> 00:02:00,960
darkness, we do not know sometimes, even to
that extent, that there is something beyond.

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:10,070
So the first style of seeking is anuvopai
as you call it, which is depending on separating

15
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,980
molecules after molecules.

16
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:21,470
Because under these circumstances, when you
are surrounded by darkness, you see Spirit

17
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,370
just as a molecule or you can say a spark
or a flicker.

18
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,510
Sometimes you just get a flicker of it.

19
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,200
As you know the thoughts arise within us and
fade away.

20
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,600
We see the thoughts rising and fading away.

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,570
And there are many thoughts all around us.

22
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:47,590
Our attention is on those thoughts, moving
all the time.

23
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:54,180
It is very hard to find that space in between
two thoughts, that’s why what we see is

24
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:02,840
just a flicker, you can call it, or a little
atom of that Spirit, sometimes sparkling.

25
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,820
And then the search starts among human beings.

26
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:14,060
From that darkness, from Tamoguna they start
searching and the kriya (action) starts within

27
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,060
us.

28
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:27,070
So we can see in the left hand side as you
see the Ida Nadi, by which we live in Tamoguna,

29
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:39,200
in desiring for it, and then we move to the
right hand side, on the Pingala Nadi, in which

30
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,550
we act.

31
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,870
In that action we try to find the Spirit.

32
00:03:50,870 --> 00:04:03,230
Of course, first we think it is in getting
material advancement that you will find that

33
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:11,330
Spirit, that flicker, and so we go in for
material advancement.

34
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:21,000
Now, material advancement is very different
from the spiritual advancement.

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,460
Or we can say the material happening, what
we see, like a plane landing or a plane taking

36
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:42,069
off or a collision of two trains or any such
happenings are outside and spiritual happening

37
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:49,090
is within.

38
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:56,620
Our attention is always attracted towards
outside happenings and it is an impossibility

39
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:05,020
to take this attention inside.

40
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:14,520
That is why something has to happen within
us to attract that attention inside.

41
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:26,800
We cannot force our attention inside, so people
try, normally, the anuvopai is that what you

42
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:37,889
call Ashtanga Yoga and other Yogas, by which
they try separating themselves from myth,

43
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:54,570
from darkness; for which you need very astute,
honest, sincere people, very young celibate,

44
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:01,069
innocent people, those who have to live in
the forest with their Gurus.

45
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,719
So they keep out their attention, which is
called as nirodha (restraint).

46
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:11,580
They stop their attention spreading itself.

47
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,960
They concentrate their attention with the
help of a Realised soul.

48
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,150
If you come to India you’ll meet some real
sages like that who live on top of hills and

49
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,340
mountains, who are not easily available to
people.

50
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:36,030
They do not sell their religion or they do
not sell their Realisation to people.

51
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,639
Hidden away from the madding crowd, they exist
there.

52
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:47,279
One of them has told someone, some Sahaja
Yogis that he has practiced anuvopai for twenty-one

53
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:54,219
thousand years from when he was just a frog!

54
00:06:54,219 --> 00:07:01,069
It’s fantastic that he carried on for twenty-one
thousand years, every year, life, he was born

55
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:06,411
and still he cannot raise the Kundalini of
others very easily!

56
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:15,339
Still he does not have the power to raise
the Kundalini the way you Sahaja Yogis can

57
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,339
raise!

58
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:18,309
It’s most surprising!

59
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:23,229
He has given Realisation to only one person,
only one.

60
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,910
In twenty five years he worked on him; the
same way, anuvopai.

61
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,559
These are the people who are detached, veetragas.

62
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:38,139
Not that you have to run way from anywhere,
but living in the society only you can achieve

63
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:43,169
it through our Sahaja Yoga or Mahayoga.

64
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,629
This is shaktopai.

65
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:53,659
But these people still are afraid to come
in the cities because they could not make

66
00:07:53,659 --> 00:08:00,469
people understand.

67
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:08,070
They do not trust human beings and they want
to keep away from them.

68
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,070
They are not married.

69
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,360
They lead a celibate life.

70
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,669
They live up to two hundred years sometimes,
sometimes a thousand years also.

71
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:23,840
But it is a very individualistic movement,
works on one or two people.

72
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,060
Births after births they cleansed themselves.

73
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,789
This is anuvopai.

74
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:35,110
So the search for the Divine or for the Spirit
has been on for ages now, it’s not a new

75
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,659
thing that we are doing here.

76
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:47,290
And you also have been seeking that Divine
in your previous lives and many lives before.

77
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,790
But you must know that for seeking you have
to go inside.

78
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,610
It’s not outside.

79
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:00,180
And how do you go inside?

80
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,970
Is the problem.

81
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,820
Some people say that if you go on suggesting,
“I’m going inside,” you go inside.

82
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:18,889
It’s all imagination, because when the attention
is out, the knower and the knowledge, both

83
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:20,740
are different.

84
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,750
Like if I see this thing now, for example,
if I am not a Realised soul, I’ll see this

85
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,540
one and I will just think, “How much they
must have paid for it?

86
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,870
What is it made of?

87
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,880
From where did they get it?”

88
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,019
All sorts of these superficial things as you
can call it.

89
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,029
At the most somebody might say, “It’s
very aesthetically placed and it has very

90
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,010
great balance,” and all that.

91
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,230
At the most!

92
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:52,870
But it is all outside, because the knower
who knows about it is outside the knowledge.

93
00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:06,529
So there’s a tremendous difference between
the happening outside and happening inside.

94
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:12,029
When you see a train colliding you will say,
“Oh, look at this!

95
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,630
What is this they have done?

96
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,730
This driver is wrong!” and that, “These
people have suffered so much,” and all sorts

97
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,730
of things.

98
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,730
You’ll start collecting money.

99
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,620
Whatever we do normally, you see.

100
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:33,180
But the knowledge about it is outside the
knower that is your Self.

101
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:43,860
But when the spiritual happening takes place
the knowledge and the knower become one.

102
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:55,310
For example now this machine that is here,
to a normal person as I told you will be,

103
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,569
“It is so much, it costs so much,” or
whatever it is, you see.

104
00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:02,639
But to a Realised soul it would be, “Is
it vibrating?

105
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,960
Is it emitting vibrations?

106
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,250
What sort of vibrations is it emitting?

107
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,910
It is good or bad?”

108
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:16,990
Because then you start understanding it according
to spiritual value and not according to material

109
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,300
value.

110
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,510
I hope you understand this point.

111
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,320
Spiritual value is an absolute value.

112
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:32,880
And what is the measure of that is the spiritual
joy.

113
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,389
The vibrations give you spiritual joy – the
good vibrations, I mean.

114
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:40,720
What are good vibrations?

115
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,650
Are nothing but the coefficience (sic) of
this whole thing is emitting through it, the

116
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,760
All Pervading Power, which is giving you joy.

117
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,730
It is an absolute value.

118
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:03,720
You take ten children who are Realised souls:
you tie their eyes and ask them to put their

119
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,069
hands towards one person.

120
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:11,750
All of them will show you the same finger,
which is burning; whichever is the chakra

121
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,970
they are catching.

122
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,315
There will be no confusion, no second opinion
about it, no quarrelling, because that’s

123
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:30,209
what it is, because the knower and the knowledge
is the same.

124
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:36,460
That is why when our attention is outside
and we are seeking something or knowing something,

125
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:46,529
then we start seeing it according to our thinking
and who does the thinking is Mr. Ego or maybe

126
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:47,529
Superego.

127
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:55,769
We are not there to think about it, so anything
you give them, say for example you marry two

128
00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:00,610
persons in modern times.

129
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,160
So they’ll sit down and work it out.

130
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,350
How can you work out a marriage with your
brains?

131
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,490
It’s a question of your heart.

132
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,490
Just enjoy it.

133
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,959
You give them food, they’ll sit down and
work it out, start analysing it.

134
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,769
They cannot synthesise it.

135
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:23,160
The food will get cold, it will lose all its
taste and the whole thing will be wasted.

136
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,639
They make the same thing out of their lives.

137
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,720
For nothing at all they create problems by
thinking.

138
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:37,850
Analysis starts outside, synthesis starts
inside.

139
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:45,100
Now this nirodha is the withdrawing of your
attention inside as I told you is only possible

140
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,290
through a happening within.

141
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,779
Now how do you get the happening within yourself?

142
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:56,269
For example, I am talking to you, you are
paying attention to Me: supposing something

143
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,740
falls down, immediately your attention goes
to that happening.

144
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,230
So there has to be some happening within.

145
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:10,310
Now, what is that happening, is Kundalini
Yoga, and this Kundalini Yoga is the shaktopai,

146
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:16,390
is the, is known as shaktipath, is the giving
of the Shakti.

147
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,259
Very few are entitled with this, I mean today
these are all selling ‘shaktis’ there.

148
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:28,110
There have their ashramas, and this that,
they are talking of shakti, when that people

149
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,240
start dancing, jumping, screaming like possessed
people.

150
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,149
That is not Shakti at all.

151
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:46,069
Only a person of a very high quality can raise
the Kundalini because he is to be authorised

152
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:48,079
by God.

153
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:58,130
It’s a very rare thing to give Realisation
to people.

154
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:07,300
Only such people who have been authorised
by God can just move the Kundalini straight

155
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,720
forward.

156
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:21,080
So the anuvopai is a very slow action, is
for few individuals who get out of this maya,

157
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:28,189
this illusion and tell people that, “This
is all illusion, is a mirage, you are running

158
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,189
after a mirage.

159
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,899
Don’t run after this mirage.”

160
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,860
But still, people can’t believe them.

161
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,040
They crucify them, they poison them, they
beat them, they do all kinds of things to

162
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,079
them.

163
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,980
I mean, they did not do any harm to anyone
whatsoever that they should be treated so

164
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:54,329
badly by human beings.

165
00:15:54,329 --> 00:16:05,570
So, it is to be understood that your attention
has to be sucked in.

166
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:11,930
The nirodha has to work out.

167
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,829
Not by denying things, “Don’t look at
the women.”

168
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:16,990
“Don’t look at the gold.”

169
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,060
“Don’t look at things, your attention
will be spoiled.”

170
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,290
Not by those methods.

171
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:27,319
Or by taking you to the jungles, leading you
a celibate life, making a very holy atmosphere

172
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:34,450
around and just forcing you that you do not
see that [which] is evil.

173
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:41,240
But when you see it again you go back to the
same!

174
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,589
There’s no immunity developed.

175
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:53,740
So the attention when it’s sucked in by
Kundalini rising, the first thing you notice

176
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,279
is that there is dilatation of the pupil.

177
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:03,199
Now, dilatation of the pupil will cause a
kind of a blindness, normally.

178
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,429
There was a lady doctor who had come for her
Realisation to me once and I tried to raise

179
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:10,520
her Kundalini, it wouldn’t go beyond Agya.

180
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,839
While she was driving suddenly she felt that
her eyes were dilating and she couldn’t

181
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,380
see, so she took her car on one side and she
said , “For about a minute I just could

182
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,360
not see anything, I was quite worried.

183
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,220
I felt my dilatation of the pupil is taking
place and I was worried about it that how

184
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,220
I’ve become blind.”

185
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:36,430
And then again she got back but when she went
back, she was seeing much better and there

186
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,760
was a sparkle in her eyes, eyes were sparkling.

187
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,460
She telephoned to me, she said , “Does it
happen?”

188
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,840
I said , “Yes.”

189
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:53,010
To attract your attention from outside inward,
Kundalini does that to you, that She dilates

190
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,830
your pupil.

191
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:01,630
Now the doctors may come on my head and say
that it is a parasympathetic or a sympathetic

192
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,630
action.

193
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,630
They do not know, they have not yet decided.

194
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,340
It’s the action of Kundalini.

195
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,559
They don’t know about Kundalini.

196
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,779
Even if you show them pulsating they will
not believe it.

197
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,309
They don’t want to believe it.

198
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:16,500
They want to remain outside, in ignorance.

199
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,830
All of them are like that.

200
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:25,540
Now, everybody is saying that now outside
battles are over, we have to have battle inside,

201
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,100
we have to fight ourselves.

202
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,270
Anywhere you go they will say that, “We
must find our wholesomeness.”

203
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,659
Oh, big lectures you know!

204
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,419
Conferences after conferences people are talking
so big!

205
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,039
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

206
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:48,490
But when it comes to reality that you can
have it, it’s a very slow movement [but]

207
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,820
still better than anuvopai!

208
00:18:49,820 --> 00:19:00,220
By anuvopai [those] who are living in the
city they will not reach anywhere, they cannot.

209
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,500
If you try to do all those things, if you
do not have a Realised soul as your guru and

210
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,850
also the atmosphere, either you’ll get into
ego or into superego; you’ll have a problem

211
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:20,010
there, either onto to the left or onto the
right.

212
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,240
Supposing you tell them , “Now, don’t
drink, don’t smoke!”

213
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,720
Immediately you will get conditioned and Mr.
Freud will stand up and say, “See, you are

214
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,039
conditioned, you should have all the freedom!”

215
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,039
Alright.

216
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,980
So you go ahead [and] do whatever you please.

217
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,409
So your Mr. Ego will become like a big balloon
on your head if you do whatever you please.

218
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:42,790
And then you have a big forehead coming out,
eating everyone out like that.

219
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:49,059
(laughing) And I have given a nice speech
on Mr. Ego, how it tries to strangle everyone

220
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,820
and how we are raising against everyone.

221
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:58,289
This Mr. Ego gives us the feeling that we
are something and that is the one which keeps

222
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:01,260
us in bondage of ignorance.

223
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,230
And it’s like, I sometimes feel, like the
fist of a boxer!

224
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,740
Anybody tries to go near it, it gives you
a bang back!

225
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,890
Anybody tries to say anything about it, it
will come out with a big bang on your head.

226
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:22,080
So if you do not pay attention to your ego
and say, “No, no, no, no, I must not eat

227
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,740
this, I must not do this, I must not do that,”
finished!

228
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,510
You go onto the left hand side and then you
get the conditioning and then you may fall

229
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:32,570
into the traps of Mr. Rajneesh or someone
like that, who is conditioning you.

230
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,120
And you cannot get out of it.

231
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,960
You try your level best, you cannot get out
of it, because they entrap you with their

232
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,549
hypnosis, you go into your superego, you are
hypnotised, you are possessed and whatever

233
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:52,520
you may try, all such people are very difficult
for Sahaja Yoga.

234
00:20:52,520 --> 00:21:00,179
They think I don’t know what they are doing,
but it is not my knowing, it is your knowing

235
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,179
is the point.

236
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:04,409
The loser is within you, and the winner is
also within you.

237
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,980
It is you [who] have to gain, not me.

238
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,740
Sahaja Yoga is not for me at all.

239
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,090
I don’t have to do it.

240
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:21,909
It is for you to do it to gain that knowledge
which is your Self.

241
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:29,809
Only thing I can do is the Shakti path but
actually I don’t do it either, I can tell

242
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:30,809
you.

243
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:31,809
I don’t do anything.

244
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:32,809
I’m just sitting quiet.

245
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:35,049
It just emits, what can I do?

246
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,620
That’s my nature, it just flows.

247
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,549
It works out that way.

248
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:46,590
But, because of our ego, we want all challenges.

249
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:55,399
Supposing I tell you tomorrow that, “You
can only get it by jumping hundred times,”

250
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,480
you will immediately start doing that!

251
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:06,649
If I tell you, say, on another sort of a efficiency
trip, that, “Supposing you do a hundred

252
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:13,620
jumps in five minutes, you will get it faster,”
you will do that.

253
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:21,890
Or else I give you another kind of a pralobhan
(प्रलोभन) as they call it, a

254
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,890
temptation.

255
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:29,059
Like you put five rupees today then I say,
“No, no, you better put ten rupees,” and

256
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,059
you put that.

257
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,700
It’s like a running a horse, race.

258
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,750
See how superficially we look at this.

259
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,679
In this superficiality we are going to get
lost completely.

260
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,390
If you are really seeking then you find it
and be there and get it!

261
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:55,070
This is your own!

262
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:59,460
We talk big; I find very – I mean I meet
the people who are the cream of every nation,

263
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,860
I should say, and they are creaming each other,
that’s all!

264
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,550
Nothing more than that.

265
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,159
They do not want to go deeper into it and
talking about, “Oh, we understand.

266
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:16,780
There has to be a Messiah.

267
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,640
There has to be [that] something must happen
to us.”

268
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,330
“We should all become wholesome.”

269
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,610
Now they are finding fanaticism is troubling
them so they are saying, “No, these fanatics

270
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,149
are there.”

271
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:30,210
And we are all fanatics when we are outside.

272
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:38,539
I mean, if you ask me, they look like mad
people to me.

273
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,309
Such extremists!

274
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,850
All [their] attention outside.

275
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,899
And an arrangement has been made within you,
as I told you, of Kundalini being placed at

276
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,309
the triangular bone there.

277
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:54,940
It’s so beautiful it is constructed, just
see the beauty of the Kundalini.

278
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,690
Even in seeking we have gone all out to torture
our Kundalini.

279
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:08,059
We are not honest to ourselves and to our
Mother, the Kundalini, the One who is sitting

280
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:14,690
there for us to give us our Realisation, our
re-birth.

281
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,600
She is there, you can see for yourself with
your naked eyes.

282
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,350
For example, one of the Sahaja Yogis who is
a doctor went and talked to the doctors.

283
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,669
I said, “Now, what are they doing?”

284
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:29,640
They said, “Yes, we know, we got the cool
breeze in the hand, alright.”

285
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
“Then?”

286
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,990
“And yes we see, we know there is something
pulsating in the triangular bone.”

287
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,990
“Then?

288
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,610
Does not intrigue you?”

289
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:47,000
“But still, how can that be Self Realisation?”

290
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:01,970
I mean, it is beyond any one to drink water
for others and digest it and enjoy it.

291
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:09,990
You can take somebody to the water, make them
drink, push them down into it, but if they

292
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,309
just refuse then what can you do about it?

293
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:19,630
And then they will come out of it and have
a big conference: “It’s a big conference.

294
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,900
Having, a big, big conferences!”

295
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
Halls they’ll fill up!

296
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,210
And what are they discussing?

297
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:30,690
How to know that you are a part of the one
living organism!

298
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:37,140
Again you take out some books, read here,
have a big discussion, have a big party out

299
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,410
of that and finished.

300
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:47,799
This ‘Sunday School’ seeking, is not going
to help us.

301
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:56,059
First thing we have to be genuine about it
that we want to seek it.

302
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:07,399
As you know in Sahaja Yoga, those who have
advanced, those who have really worked genuinely,

303
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:23,400
without paying attention outside, have been
able to know the Divine, to enjoy It and to

304
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,919
give It to others.

305
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:34,380
But anywhere in life you see, without genuineness,
what are you going to achieve?

306
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,720
It’s like some mad man who’s a Liaison
Officer, you see.

307
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,220
Imagine what a job and a half!

308
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,570
He’s a Liaison Officer, so he is running
with the flowers for one person, another for

309
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,130
another person, he doesn’t know who is coming.

310
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,510
He may give flowers to somebody else, all
sorts of madness.

311
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:55,880
In the same way, we are like Liaison Officers,
without any feelings within our heart.

312
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,029
But with this happening you start feeling
the other within you.

313
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,130
You start feeling.

314
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,809
It’s an actualisation, as I told you last
time.

315
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:12,909
And when that actualisation takes place the
only thing you have to do, is to allow it

316
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:20,049
to grow, because it has happened spontaneously
without your effort being put into it and

317
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:22,230
it is going to work out spontaneously.

318
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:29,889
Only don’t stop its progress by your own
ego and your own style of looking at things.

319
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:37,789
You cannot make a career out of it or a business.

320
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,930
It is to be enjoyed!

321
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,510
Now I am surprised how human beings are not
selling their children.

322
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,150
I mean they are selling everything.

323
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:56,320
They are selling their hair, nose, eyes, everything
that is possible under the sun, blood.

324
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:09,480
But the source of all the joy that is within
you is in the heart pulsating.

325
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,450
That is called as the pranashakti, is the
pulsating power of the Spirit within you,

326
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:22,740
which is just to be enlightened so [that]
the whole attention gets enlightened.

327
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:29,679
And the difference between an ordinary awareness,
where the knower and the knowledge are two

328
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:36,809
different things and an enlightened awareness,
where both become one, it is tremendous!

329
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:43,690
But nobody wants to practice it and see for
yourself how dynamic it is!

330
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:51,280
This is what the whole world is seeking today,
this is what we are talking about and that

331
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:59,350
is how the supply department from India for
all the kinds of thugs are coming here!

332
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:05,840
So it’s a big circus going on everywhere!

333
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,049
Do you want to also run in the same circus?

334
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:16,420
I mean, it is not to please me, sir, but is
to please your Self.

335
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:22,549
Because it is only the spiritual value of
everything whatsoever is going to give you

336
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:25,429
joy, nothing else.

337
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:30,250
Let the awakening take place.

338
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,070
Give some time to it.

339
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,600
You have problems, the Kundalini rises, alright.

340
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,269
It touches the Sahastrara, that’s also correct.

341
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:45,100
But many people they say, “Mother, when
it has touched, why should it fall?”

342
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,919
Now, it’s not my fault.

343
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,919
Mine does not fall.

344
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,980
It falls because of your faults, whatever
you have done to yourself.

345
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,029
The Kundalini has to supply, she has to look
after you.

346
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:02,419
You have been so cruel to yourself or to others,
whatever you have done.

347
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:06,230
You have done all wrong things so far, so
Kundalini falls.

348
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,510
Let Her look after all these things.

349
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,570
She knows you have a problem.

350
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,559
But if you are not genuine, she knows also
that you are not genuine.

351
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,350
She’ll just disappear into your Mooladhara
there in the triangular bone and will never

352
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,350
rise.

353
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,780
She’ll be very badly frozen.

354
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,529
When you start thinking about the Kundalini,
you just close her completely there and she

355
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,529
just goes down.

356
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:38,510
She sees, “This man doesn’t know anything.

357
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:45,260
He’ll have to take another ten births perhaps
to get his Kundalini again back in place.”

358
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:51,970
But with some people it comes up and stays
there.

359
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,800
You must respect it.

360
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,580
You must value it.

361
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,330
If you value that, you have valued yourself
and nobody else.

362
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:11,450
By crucifying Christ, you cannot reduce his
value by any chance.

363
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:17,169
You have crucified yourself by that, when
you crucified you.

364
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:22,480
So the good time is coming, Christmas ahead.

365
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,190
Let Christ be born within us on our Agya here
in the crossing point.

366
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:39,769
Let us remember all these great incarnations
and prophets who came on this earth, who lived

367
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:47,670
like us, like ordinary human beings, in the
most ordinary way.

368
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,789
They led a very ordinary simple life.

369
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:52,279
Some of them married also, had children.

370
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,279
Why?

371
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:05,690
They could have lived on the hills and mountains
very easily avoiding all the nonsense.

372
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:18,570
No, they did come to give you a milestone
in your achievement of your evolution, and

373
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:27,100
this is what is the evolution, the Maha Yoga,
where you become one with the Spirit.

374
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:34,890
All the rest is useless, of no value.

375
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:41,330
Spirit is your Self, is you.

376
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:49,200
You are identified with your ego, so you want
to always satisfy your ego, “I like it.”

377
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,400
“I like it,” means Mr. Ego likes it, really,
most of the time.

378
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,440
And the Self doesn’t say , “I like it.”

379
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,029
It feels it.

380
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:08,870
It feels within Itself.

381
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,289
It’s absolute.

382
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:16,649
This is the shaktopai, which many people are
practicing.

383
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:20,820
I haven’t come across even one genuine person
who does this, so far.

384
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,870
I mean we had: Nanaka was there, Kabira was
there, we had in India – great people.

385
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:33,830
And they have talked about these fake people.

386
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:41,409
Even in the anuvopai, also Kundalini has to
rise in any case!

387
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:43,990
It has happened in the case of Buddha and
Mahavira.

388
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:50,049
But I told you that they were the children
of Rama and thousands of years later, they

389
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:56,790
got their Realisation, and they are like incarnations
only, you can say, but they are different

390
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,790
styles.

391
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,890
We have no time to waste now.

392
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:09,800
This is the Last Judgment where we have to
give up all our nonsensical ideas.

393
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:18,389
You see, it’s difficult to talk to people
who have made business out of God, or some

394
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:25,940
sort of a political issue out of a God.

395
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,501
But sensible people should know that they
have to know themselves first of all, they

396
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:37,810
have to become themselves and then they will
know that they are really a part and parcel

397
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:45,980
of the whole, of the Viraat, the Akbar.

398
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,580
You cannot know religion from outside like
these people are saying, “Allah ho Akbar,

399
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,990
Allah ho Akbar,” and killing you!

400
00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:00,119
Or sitting in the Church and, “Let’s us
sing hymn number such and such.”

401
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:07,530
Or in our temples selling all kinds of drugs.

402
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:18,620
That’s why this contrast one doesn’t understand
how religious people could be like that.

403
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:27,520
And then you get some nice people, ‘gentlemen’,
you know, ‘very good people’.

404
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,600
Useless!

405
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,352
“Oh, they are very good,” alright, what
will they do?

406
00:35:33,352 --> 00:35:42,380
They’ll make some bridges or may have some
tunnels or may do some creative work of writing

407
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,490
some novels or something.

408
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,670
But still the knower and the knowledge is
separated in them.

409
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:57,589
They are useless to themselves, I am saying,
not to others.

410
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:02,240
And the confusion has to go by achieving your
absolute.

411
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,770
But all the time our attention is outside
criticising others or finding faults with

412
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:11,000
others or some sort of a trivial thing.

413
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:20,630
All this sounds so trivial in this world,
the way we are wasting our energy.

414
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:34,109
Here is the store within us of our own earnings,
of our own punyas by which you have to get

415
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:45,089
that [which] is promised to you and to enjoy
that and here is the key for you!

416
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:52,770
Keep your minds open and take in, have it,
it’s a gift.

417
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:57,619
As you yourself know that – you have got
so many gifts from God.

418
00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:01,550
How is it you have become a human being?

419
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,320
What have you done to become a human being?

420
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:12,910
This is a gift of God, this beautiful human
body, mind, everything you have got it.

421
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:24,359
And now that gift itself is going to transform
you into the greatest of greatest gift – is

422
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,290
to know your Father.

423
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:35,440
The One who has created you is anxious to
bestow all His powers to you, like a father

424
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,850
wants to bestow all his property.

425
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:44,950
So take it with both the hands and have it,
and enjoy it.

426
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:53,260
Before Realisation, I do not tell you that
you give up drinking, smoking or any kind

427
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
of nirodh.

428
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,329
No, I cannot ask you to do that.

429
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:07,079
But after Realisation, jolly well you give
it up, you just do it, because you now taste

430
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,390
the ambrosia, the amruta.

431
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,829
Then you don’t want to have anything else.

432
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:21,900
But, till you have tasted it, give some time,
have some patience.

433
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,810
You need not be very well educated for this.

434
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:31,210
You need not have a very good practice of
say, standing on your heads!

435
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:36,170
You need not be going to churches or anything.

436
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,250
If you are a normal human being, it is going
to work out.

437
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:44,370
But mostly, when we do all these things, we
are abnormal.

438
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:49,910
Even in saying that we are seeking God, we
are doing lots of abnormal things.

439
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,160
We have to be absolutely normal.

440
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,569
It is like this room being dark, you are sitting
down here, now sit down!

441
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:57,950
It’s going to work out.

442
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:00,990
But we start jumping here and there and we
get hurt.

443
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:10,670
It’s like going in a boat: just keep quiet,
just be in the centre, with the centre of

444
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,000
gravity of the boat.

445
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,420
Just be there!

446
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,070
That is dharma.

447
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:22,720
In your sustenance, stay there.

448
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,700
I mean to remain good, you don’t have to
do anything.

449
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:34,670
I mean to become bad, you have to do something,
isn’t it?

450
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:44,329
All these things will come to you automatically
when there is light.

451
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:45,359
Just be quiet.

452
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,530
All of you are going to get it.

453
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:58,060
That is being ordained, that’s being arranged,
organised, very well within you, beautifully.

454
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:07,070
As in a seed everything is arranged, to create
a tree, it’s arranged within you.

455
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:21,670
But you have to be together, work it out,
understand each other and this group grows

456
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:38,119
in that understanding, in collectivity, and
creates a nucleus for others to follow it.

457
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:52,220
So, there should be no problem for you to
understand that it is a special grace.

458
00:40:52,220 --> 00:41:01,830
Because you are special, maybe I am also special,
and special people needed somebody special,

459
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,849
so I had to come down here!

460
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:11,250
Let’s have it in a mutual admiration way,
will be a good idea.

461
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:17,160
There is no need to feel obliged because I
have to do it.

462
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:27,240
I feel loaded with it and I feel lighter when
you get it.

463
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:33,780
Like a mother I tell you.

464
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,809
Sometimes I have to be stern.

465
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:41,770
I know the job of a mother.

466
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,750
You need not be afraid of me at all.

467
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,900
I know everything about you, somehow.

468
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,040
Like we had one Douglas (Fry) with us and
I suddenly asked him, “What about your birthday?”

469
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,079
He was taken aback!

470
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,559
He didn’t know – he’s sitting here – how
I knew that his birthday was there.

471
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,910
And he really had a rebirth from the life
he had.

472
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,890
And when I said, he said , “How do You know,
Mother?”

473
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,540
I said , “I know what about your birthday.”

474
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,600
And I went to his house and saw him.

475
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:20,200
[I was] so overjoyed to see him settled down.

476
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:29,400
It is amazing how your seed grows and how
fragrant you become.

477
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,630
May God bless you all.

478
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:43,130
If you have any questions, please ask me.

479
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:57,829
We have little time.

480
00:42:57,829 --> 00:43:12,780
There are eighty-four tapes already with these
people and, if you want to have tapes for

481
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:32,089
yourself, you can give them the tapes and
they can tape for you or perhaps…

482
00:43:32,089 --> 00:44:01,710
Those who do not feel vibration should not
get upset.

483
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,069
There’s something wrong somewhere.

484
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:07,420
I may not tell you on your face, because I
don’t want to hurt you in any way.

485
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,580
But doesn’t matter, I am going to work it
out, you see, doctor doesn’t come and tell

486
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:17,970
you that, “You have got all these diseases
and you may die next moment.”

487
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,840
If doctor can do that, I am after all your
Mother, so I am not going to tell you.

488
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:28,910
You yourself will know, later on, what was
wrong with you.

489
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,390
Because by knowing that, you are not going
to help yourself.

490
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:39,420
On the contrary, you are going to feel dejected.

491
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:49,390
Now please put your hands just like this,
just like this.

492
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,750
And both the feet on the ground, straight.

493
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,390
On the ground.

494
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:02,480
I think perhaps next Monday is the last meeting,
is it?

495
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,869
Two more?

496
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:09,880
You are going to have me till the the end
is it?

497
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,880
Alright!

498
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,740
So I was thinking of, next Monday, I’ll
be telling about elements and all those things

499
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,740
how we are made.

500
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,740
That would be better.

501
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,740
Now close your eyes please.

502
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:58,510
If you watch your thoughts you’ll find there
are no thoughts.

503
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:16,460
Keep your eyes shut.

504
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:25,430
Just see.

505
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:56,849
There are no thoughts in your mind.

506
00:46:56,849 --> 00:47:50,700
Now, in your finger tips you’ll feel a cool
breeze coming in.

507
00:47:50,700 --> 00:48:14,451
That means the Realisation has taken place
because the cool breeze is the sign of the

508
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:22,490
Holy Ghost, in Sanskrit it is, “salilam,
salilam,” described that the Spirit emits

509
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:40,369
or radiates, you can say, Itself as cool breeze.

510
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:45,010
The light of the Spirit is the cool breeze.

511
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,510
Power of God.

512
00:48:47,510 --> 00:49:04,590
It’s a breeze like thing which starts floating
or going inside your…If any one of you are

513
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,930
feeling sleepy, keep your eyes open please.

514
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,260
Be alert.

515
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:21,970
You have to be alert because this is the happening
for which you have been desiring.

516
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:26,530
See for yourself.

517
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:31,680
The more desirous you are the better it is.

518
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:44,150
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

519
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,150
Good.

520
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,150
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

521
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,150
All those who are getting cool breeze, please
raise your hands, all of you.

522
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,150
All those who are getting cool breeze in the
hand, please raise your hands.

523
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,150
All those who are feeling cool breeze in the
hand, please raise your hands.

524
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,150
Now those who have come today and not yet
Realised and are not getting cool breeze,

525
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,150
please raise your hands.

526
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,150
Can you come forward?

527
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,150
Keep your eyes shut, please.

528
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:54,150
That lady?

529
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,150
You’re getting the cool breeze in the hands?

530
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,150
Are you feeling any cool breeze?

531
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,150
Lady: Not so much.

532
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,150
Shri Mataji: Not so much?

533
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,150
So you started thinking about it, that’s
all.

534
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:00,150
Alright.

535
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,150
So for that you ask for forgiveness, that,
“I should not think about it,” and it

536
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,150
will start flowing.

537
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,150
Alright?

538
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,150
By thinking you did not get it.

539
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,150
So, it’s alright now.

540
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,150
Good!

541
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,150
See how clever it is!

542
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,150
Still wearing that?

543
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,150
What is that?

544
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,150
Now see him what’s the matter.

545
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,150
On the heart he is catching.

546
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,150
Now, better now ? It plays tricks.

547
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,150
John, see here, this side.

548
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,150
Don’t watch others at this time.

549
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,150
You watch yourself, alright?

550
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,150
Very important.

551
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,150
You catch people.

552
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,150
Just don’t watch.

553
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,150
Watch yourself.

554
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,150
This is the time to watch yourself, alright?

555
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,150
David, come forward, here.

556
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,150
John, you also come here, I would like to
see you.

557
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,150
John, you come here.

558
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,150
David, you come here.

559
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,150
Lindsey, you also come here.

560
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:26,150
Let’s see.

561
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,150
You sit down here first.

562
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,150
Lindsey just come here I would like to see
you also.

563
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,150
Just there.

564
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,150
Just somewhere here.

565
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,150
Just sit.

566
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,150
Is that Alan?

567
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,150
How are you?

568
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,150
Better now?

569
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,150
Better?

570
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,150
Can you come forward.

571
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,150
You also.

572
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,150
Just let me see.

573
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,150
I wanted to see your vibrations also.

574
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,150
Yes, please.

575
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,150
Come forward.

576
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,150
Can you take two chairs?

577
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,150
You must see your vibrations.

578
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,150
We must get ourselves corrected.

579
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,150
There may be some sort of a thing because
the vibrations if they are not sucking in

580
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,150
alright, then there is some problem.

581
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,150
Let’s get it alright.

582
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,150
What is there to feel bad about anything whatsoever?

583
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,150
Well, Alan, just come here, if possible.

584
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,150
Alright.

585
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,150
You can take a chair here next to John.

586
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:51,156
Alan, please open your eyes, please.
