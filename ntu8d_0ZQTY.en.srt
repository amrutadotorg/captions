1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,880
So you, once you are in thoughtless awareness what happens

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,160
that no thoughts bombard your mind.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,120
Wherever you may be, you may be in America, you may be in any place.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,360
You are not bombarded by thoughts.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,000
So, what does that mean? Into very simple language we can say,

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,720
it means that you do not reflect.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,160
You do not have a reflecting mind.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,840
Now this is the basic problem of Sahaja Yogis of today,

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,960
which one should try to conquer.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,680
That you do not reflect.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,520
That's the only way you can achieve your steadiness.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,360
For example I have seen people,

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,800
for nothing at all they'll just start laughing,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,400
nothing at all.

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,320
They see somebody, immediately they react

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,960
"This was nice but not so good."

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,280
They start giving their opinions, especially in the West, about everything.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,400
Everybody seems to be very knowledgeable

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,400
and start telling what is best

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,280
and what is not the best, what is not good.

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,760
And once they start saying something like that,

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,880
mind becomes reflective.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,920
If the mind is not reflective, then you are thoughtless awareness.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,640
Watch anything, just you watch.

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,040
Just witness. You should not reflect.

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:49,360
If you are using your mental power, then this power subsides.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,240
This is a very common defect with people because,

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,480
I think, you people

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,200
are more intelligent, you think. Maybe

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,160
I think, you are well educated, might be.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,440
I don't know, whatever you think.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,320
But this reflecting mind

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,760
is a very dangerous thing for spirituality.

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,400
You'll never grow. And then with the reflecting mind,

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,480
you have different emotions with something you reflect on somebody.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,320
Now if it's your son or daughter or something, you get identified.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,480
Identification with some is artificial.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,600
It's not in reality.

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,400
But because this mind reflects, it identifies.

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,040
Now many identifications you have dropped out.

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,960
For example your bias about religion,

42
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,680
about races,

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,240
about maybe nationalities, you have dropped out.

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,800
But still I would say, the reflecting mind still acts

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,400
and this is the greatest hurdle for the progress of Sahaja Yogis of today.

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,360
I've been thinking "Why is it the reflecting mind

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,440
is so active in Sahaja Yogis of today?"

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,840
If you could stop reflecting,

49
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,640
immediately you establish yourself

50
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,480
in the ocean of peace.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,440
You watch something, just watch.

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,200
There's no ripple of thought in your mind.

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,480
Then you become extremely creative.

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,160
You become extremely dynamic,

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,760
you become extremely compassionate.

56
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,600
You have no fear.

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,280
Some people think, "If you are compassionate

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
you see this man might lynch me". You have no fear.

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,520
All virtues that you have to enjoy

60
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,240
you can only enjoy

61
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,760
when you do not reflect.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,600
That means that you leave everything to the Divine.

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,320
You are not in charge.

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,280
You don't see that you have to be reflecting on something.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,800
This is the greatest power you have got, is not to reflect,

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,680
not to look at somebody with that kind of thing.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,880
I have seen this is still there lingering.

68
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,160
Perhaps I never told you about it, maybe one of the reasons.

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,600
I don't say that it's only your fault but maybe Mine,

70
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,120
because I couldn't find what was exactly wrong,

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,320
that is the reflection that you have about others.

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,840
Now I told you, have introspection.

73
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,240
For introspection also it can be reflection,

74
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,400
but that at least gives you idea as to where you are.

75
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,720
But with that psychologically you can become extremely depressed.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
You can condemn yourself.

77
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,920
Then you may not understand yourself

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
as a personality that you are

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,680
and you'll go on, sort of,

80
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,080
losing your vibrations, losing your power.

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,920
Because you are not control of yourself.

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,200
So introspection, also, if it brings

83
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,280
about depression and demeaning of your personality,

84
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,680
best is not to introspect also.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,640
Because all these mental activities, I have seen, create problems.

86
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,360
But in a state where you are thoughtlessly aware,

87
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,880
introspection comes to you automatically.

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,080
You see it automatically.

89
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,240
You understand it automatically. You do not think about it,

90
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,160
it just comes to you. The whole picture comes to you

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,560
and you are at peace with yourself.

92
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,040
You are never in turmoil,

93
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,880
never in trouble.

94
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
Then you don't get angry.

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,640
Then you do not argue,

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,360
then you do not discuss,

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:26,480
but you become as if dropped in to the ocean of awareness

98
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,520
and you don't have to worry

99
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,200
as to solve something.

100
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,840
When you are reflecting,

101
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,880
then you find that this power works.

102
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,240
Now it becomes very contradictory to say that you have to project

103
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,640
and you don't have to reflect.

104
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,520
Now when we reflect we absorb.

105
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,800
When we reflect on something, we absorb that thing.

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,200
And mostly our attention goes to the defects of others,

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,120
"This person is no good, that is not good, this is,

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,480
her hair is not all right, the sari's not all right."

109
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,880
This, that and all nonsense.

110
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,920
So what are we doing, we are absorbing all the bad things also.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,480
Now when you start admiration of something.

112
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,080
Then what happens that you may not get the bad things

113
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,320
but at least you are on a better line.

114
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,000
But still, the admiration in thoughtless awareness

115
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,880
is really very deep.

116
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,040
I saw this in the eyes of this great scientist.

117
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,880
Absolutely he was just one with Me,

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,360
and his eyes were like an ocean of peace.

119
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,080
He was just looking at Me,

120
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,680
and for quite some time and then he came to his thoughts

121
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,200
and he told Me that "This is what we can do with Your photograph."

122
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,040
So the depth in you will only come when you do not reflect.

123
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,480
But it's very common with human beings, specially in the West,

124
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,600
"this carpet is no good, that is no good,

125
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,960
this smell is coming, that is there,"

126
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,720
always trying to judge others,

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,920
judge other things.

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,440
This is important? What is so important?

129
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,680
If you are sitting in the garden of heavens

130
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,960
what does it matter where you are sitting, what you are doing?

131
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:48,480
This sets in, this reflection, sets in waves of thoughts in our mind.

132
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,440
I have already, once, described it by drawing.

133
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,960
How the energy that falls on the right side

134
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,440
goes to the left side

135
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,280
and the falls on the left goes to the right.

136
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:09,960
Crosses over because of two types of cells we have.

137
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
Then out of this energy that goes to the right,

138
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,760
the energy that goes to the left

139
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,720
it is sucked in partly into the sympathetic.

140
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,840
Now whatever is left out is the one that reflects.

141
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,240
That is the way it goes on reflecting.

142
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,960
Now if you can suck in all that energy and put it on our sympathetic,

143
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,000
then all our energies will be thousand fold much more.
