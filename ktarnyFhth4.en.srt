1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,520
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,320
At the very outset, I have to say that truth is what it is.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
You cannot change it, you cannot transform it,

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,200
and it cannot compromise with you.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,600
It is, it has been, it will be the same.

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,720
Whatever I have to tell you tonight

7
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,800
you need not accept it blindfolded.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,800
We have had already very big problems with these blind faiths.

9
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,800
You should have an open mind like a scientist

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,600
and treat this talk as a hypothesis.

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,720
But if it is proved then you have to accept as honest people.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,720
Because it is for your benevolence,

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,000
it is for the benevolence of your country,

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,800
it is for the benevolence of the whole world.

15
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,400
The truth is that you are not this body, this mind,

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,400
these emotions, intelligence, ego or your conditionings,

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
but you are the pure Spirit.

18
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,400
We see beautiful flowers around us, it's actually a miracle.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,320
But we take it for granted.

20
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,000
If we ask a doctor, "Who runs our heart?"

21
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,040
he will say, "The autonomous nervous system."

22
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,840
But who is this 'auto'?

23
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,120
This they cannot answer.

24
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,840
And who does all this living work?

25
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Who brought forth our evolution?

26
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,520
There is no answer.

27
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,040
The second truth is

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,440
that there is a All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

29
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,920
It is a subtle energy which does all this living work.

30
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,440
Now, unless and until

31
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,640
we evolve more than what we are today,

32
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,520
it's not possible with this human awareness

33
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,320
to feel the existence of this All-Pervading Power.

34
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,520
And if you have to have this ascent,

35
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,640
then you have to just have pure desire for it.

36
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,920
The pure desire

37
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,920
is a desire from our mundane desire is very different.

38
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,640
According to economics, wants are not satiable in general.

39
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,440
Today we want to have a house, then a car,

40
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,240
then a helicopter, goes on like that.

41
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,240
But the pure desire of which you are not aware is this

42
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,960
that you want to evolve

43
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,760
and to feel this union with this All-Pervading Power.

44
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,840
To feel this All-Pervading Power,

45
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,760
to be in union with it is the yoga, spiritual yoga.

46
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,360
Sahaja means 'born with you'.

47
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,440
Is this right to get this union, this yoga.

48
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,360
So, the time has come

49
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,960
for all of us to use this right.

50
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,760
So when this Kundalini, this power,

51
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,640
from the sacrum bone rises like a primule of a seed,

52
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,360
it passes through six centers.

53
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,760
Most of the global problems come from human beings,

54
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,440
and most of the human problems come from their centers.

55
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,440
By any chance, by any method

56
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:39,440
if we could improve or nourish these centers, all our physical,

57
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,760
mental, emotional, and spiritual problems will be solved.

58
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,440
It's a fact

59
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,960
that through Sahaja Yoga many diseases have been cured.

60
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,760
Cancer, also many incurable diseases have been cured.

61
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
It's your own power.

62
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,560
It is waiting for this moment,

63
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,480
is your Mother,

64
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,280
anxious to give you your Second Birth.

65
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,960
So when you say you are born again

66
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,760
you have to have powers with it.

67
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,680
For example, in Sanskrit language

68
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,880
we call a bird as Dwijaha and a Realized soul also Dwijaha,

69
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,480
meaning twice born.

70
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,760
That means you are completely transformed

71
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,960
- physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

72
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,760
When this Kundalini rises,

73
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,480
and She pierces through the sixth center,

74
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,480
becomes one with this All-Pervading Subtle Power,

75
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,280
you also become subtler.

76
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,480
On your fingertips you start feeling your centers.

77
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,280
And if you know how to correct your centers

78
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,560
you are all right, problems are solved.

79
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,560
But also you can feel the centers of others.

80
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,880
It's like microcosm becoming macrocosm,

81
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,080
it's like a drop becoming an ocean.

82
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,800
It sounds fantastic,

83
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,400
but you don't know how glorious you are, how fantastic you are.

84
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
You don't know yourself at all.

85
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,280
You have no knowledge of your inner being.

86
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:31,280
So you feel sometimes frustrated as if you have no identity.

87
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,680
But once you start feeling this All-Pervading Power

88
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,400
then you understand that you have many powers.

89
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,680
You can cure yourself, you can cure others.

90
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,960
You can raise others' Kundalini, give them Realization.

91
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,400
When the Kundalini comes in this part

92
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,480
When the Kundalini comes in this part

93
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:25,680
She enlightens within you your religion which is innate.

94
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,280
That means you become righteous.

95
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,960
Like people who are they may be Christians, Hindu, Muslims, anything

96
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,400
- it's just a brand, they can commit any sin they want.

97
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:09,280
But after this happening you become really a righteous person.

98
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,680
Christ has described it in the second chapter Mathews.

99
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,080
He says, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

100
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,200
Means innocent eyes without any greed, without any lust in the eye.

101
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,520
Actually your eyes become like that.

102
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,800
Innocence cannot be lost.

103
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,600
It is covered with clouds because of our wrong doings,

104
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,920
but it cannot be lost.

105
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,520
It cannot be destroyed.

106
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:20,000
And you become so powerful that even a glance of such a person

107
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,400
can create beautiful peaceful atmosphere.

108
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,720
Then, when your Spirit comes into your attention,

109
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,120
you know the absolute truth

110
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,400
- about everything.

111
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Supposing you have ten children who are Realized souls

112
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,800
and tie up their eyes and ask them,

113
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,920
"What's wrong with this gentleman?"

114
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,000
And all the children will say - take out one finger,

115
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,400
say this finger supposing.

116
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
You ask that gentleman, "Have you got heart trouble?"

117
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
He'll say, "Yes of course, but how do you know?"

118
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,600
You get the diagnosis on your fingertips.

119
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,720
You can say what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others,

120
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,000
and you speak the language of centers, chakras.

121
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,320
Absolute truth means everybody sees the same truth.

122
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,920
Now, we are human beings,

123
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,040
we have freedom to think the way we want to think.

124
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,720
So one thinks like that, another thinks like that,

125
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,320
another thinks like that,

126
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,840
and that's why the problem.

127
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Some think they are correct, another think they are correct,

128
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,640
some think this is the best, and they fight.

129
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,040
If you know the absolute truth,

130
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,040
there's no question of fight,

131
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,440
quarrel, of course no war.

132
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,520
Now, we have this Sahaja Yoga working in 65 Nations,

133
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,040
and I've not seen

134
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,440
- even if they are 5'000 together from different countries

135
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,840
- ever fighting, quarrelling, even using a bad word.

136
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,520
They just enjoy each other.

137
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,520
The families in Sahaja Yoga are really excellent families,

138
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,440
and so many Realized souls are born to them.

139
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,640
It's a new race of angels I feel.

140
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,040
For all this you don't have to pay a single pai.

141
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,560
It's a living process.

142
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,960
When we put one seed in the Mother Earth,

143
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,360
how much do we pay to the Mother Earth?

144
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,960
She sprouts the seed

145
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,040
because the seed has the built-in mechanism to sprout,

146
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,040
and the Mother Earth has the power to germinate.

147
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,840
So the first thing we have to know that,

148
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,960
you cannot pay for your spirituality.

149
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,440
I know there have been many who tried to exploit

150
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,840
all over the world, but they are mostly now exposed.

151
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,960
I would say it was your mistake

152
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,840
because how much did you pay to Christ?

153
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:46,440
Now, one has to understand that I'm talking about Divine love.

154
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,240
They all talk of love, all right,

155
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,840
but it's the actualization of that Divine love.

156
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,360
It is the becoming which is important,

157
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
not just talking about it.

158
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,240
There has been lot of talk, we are this, we are that.

159
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,240
So you become extremely dynamic with this power,

160
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,240
at the same time extremely compassionate.

161
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,280
You don't have to suggest, you don't have to think,

162
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,880
you just - you become compassionate.

163
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,880
The compassion just works.

164
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,560
Then another thing is that we think about future and past.

165
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,960
The thought rises, falls, another thought rises and falls,

166
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,360
and we are jumping on the cusp of future and past.

167
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,960
We cannot be in the present,

168
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,560
which is the reality.

169
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,160
Present is the reality.

170
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,360
The past is finished, and the future doesn't exist.

171
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,680
When the Kundalini rises

172
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,360
She elongates those thoughts and establishes in the center

173
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,360
where there is complete thoughtless awareness.

174
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,480
And spiritually you grow in that thoughtless awareness

175
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,680
which in Sanskrit we call as Nirvichaar Samadhi.

176
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,880
The second state we call as Nirvikalpa Samadhi means

177
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,560
doubtless awareness,

178
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,560
when you become your own master.

179
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,360
Because in the light of the Spirit you know what is the truth is.

180
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,080
What is destructive for you and what is constructive for you.

181
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,080
And you just disregard all that is destructive.

182
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,600
I don't have to tell you, "Don't do this, don't - no."

183
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,600
If I say that, half of you will go away.

184
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,480
It's like this, supposing I have a snake in My hand,

185
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,080
and I am very adamant

186
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,280
and it's darkness

187
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,800
and somebody says that,  "There's a snake in your hand."

188
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
I will say, "No, it is a rope."

189
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,200
Until the snake bites Me I will say, "It's a rope."

190
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,880
But if there is little light

191
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,880
immediately I will throw away the snake.

192
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,200
Nobody has to tell you.

193
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,400
This is how your attention becomes enlightened,

194
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,880
and you become a very wise and sane personality.

195
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,800
And then you understand your value,

196
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,480
your identity.

197
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,960
Then you know you have become the instrument of this Divine love.

198
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,600
It's a pure love.

199
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,960
Like a sap rises in a tree,

200
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,880
it gives whatever is needed for every part of the tree

201
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,600
- ultimately it evaporates.

202
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,800
But supposing it likes one flower,

203
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,720
gets attached.

204
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Then the tree will die and the flower will die also.

205
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,320
So this detachment comes from within.

206
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,520
It's not to wear these dresses of renouncing

207
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,400
or to shave your head, that's not needed.

208
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,120
It's an inner happening.

209
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,800
You don't have to give up your families,

210
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,200
you don't have to give up your jobs,

211
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
you have to be absolutely normal.

212
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,520
But when you become thoughtlessly aware,

213
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,000
the peace is established within.

214
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,200
I have known many people who have got peace awards,

215
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,520
this award, that award - they have no peace within,

216
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,200
I don't know how they got it.

217
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,120
Actually most of them are very hot tempered.

218
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,920
If you have to reach them you have to take a barge pole, somehow.

219
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,600
You establish your peace within

220
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,520
and then the whole world becomes like a drama.

221
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,240
You get out of your problems and see them clearly.

222
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,920
Like if you are standing in the water you are afraid of the waves,

223
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,520
but if you get into the boat you can see the waves.

224
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,640
But if you know how to swim you can jump in and save many others.

225
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
This is how Sahaja Yoga works.

226
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,640
Your attention can go to any limit,

227
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:03,240
you can find out about anyone dead or alive in any country.

228
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,920
When we see television, we know about the ether.

229
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,920
But I am talking about the subtle of the ether,

230
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,240
which is so efficient, which is so fast,

231
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,840
which is so active, and which is so loving.

232
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,520
You find your life so blissful.

233
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,120
People write to Me about the miracles they have had.

234
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,440
I asked somebody to compile them,

235
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,520
and in one month he told Me,

236
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,840
"They have come up to my head like that, now what am I to do?"

237
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,640
They said, "You better sort it out, Mother."

238
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I said, "I have no time, all right, forget it."

239
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,640
Then you realize how glorified you are,

240
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,240
what great thing you are.

241
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,560
Now, you are at the epitome of evolution.

242
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,160
Little more advancement and you are there in the Kingdom of God,

243
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,840
absolutely protected and loved.

244
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,440
The time has come, this is a special time.

245
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,440
I call it the Blossom Time.

246
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,760
In Indian prophecies,

247
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,040
they have described this time very clearly that,

248
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,240
"So many souls will take birth

249
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,440
and there will be increase in the population

250
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,360
and they will find themselves, they will know the self-knowledge."

251
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,760
It's not that the body will come out of the grave,

252
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,840
after 500 years what is left of the body in the grave?

253
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,160
Muslims believe, Christians believe, Jews believe

254
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,360
- I think there is something wrong.

255
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,160
It's the soul which is going to take birth.

256
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,840
Above all you jump into the ocean of joy.

257
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,440
Joy is singular.

258
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,560
When our ego is happy we become happy,

259
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,160
when it is punctured we feel unhappy.

260
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,640
So we move from happiness to unhappiness

261
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,280
and happiness to unhappiness.

262
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:21,160
But joy is an experience - which has no alternative.

263
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,680
You can enjoy everything,

264
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,360
and you can find solutions to everything.

265
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:46,680
Today as it is you know, world has come to a point of great shock.

266
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,160
They are talking about breaking families,

267
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,080
they are killing children,

268
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,480
I mean, unbelievable things are happening.

269
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,960
But at this time it is predicted that,  "You will be seeking

270
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,160
the truth and you'll find it."

271
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,080
Only thing I have to tell you

272
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,880
that if you don't have desire I cannot force on you,

273
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,560
I respect your freedom.

274
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,080
The experience is not mental, it is beyond mental.

275
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,080
So if you don't want to have it's better you leave the hall.

276
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,680
But it's your right to have it if you desire.

277
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,360
In this short lecture I cannot tell you everything about it.

278
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,360
Also lecturing is also a mental acrobat.

279
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:43,280
So it will take hardly ten minutes to get your Self-Realization.

280
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,560
So those who don't want to have should leave the hall first.

281
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,880
All right.

282
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,600
There are three conditions.

283
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,600
First one is that you have to be absolutely

284
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,200
self-confident that you are going to get your Self-Realization.

285
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,680
That means you should not condemn yourself for anything.

286
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
You should not feel guilty.

287
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,600
Guilty at all about anything that has happened in the past.

288
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,280
At this moment the past is finished.

289
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,600
Unfortunately if you feel guilty,

290
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,800
then this center catches very badly

291
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,800
and you get disease called angina,

292
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,080
also spondylitis, and also lethargic organs.

293
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,680
It's a fashion to feel guilty.

294
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,680
I mean, some people feel guilty for their forefathers,

295
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,880
some feel guilty, say for Rwanda people,

296
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,880
you can't help these things.

297
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,200
It's a myth.

298
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,480
And at this moment it's important that please don't feel guilty,

299
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,960
because the Kundalini will stop at this center.

300
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
All your life you have tortured yourself and now

301
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,520
at this important moment you should not feel guilty,

302
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
so the Kundalini doesn't rise

303
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,400
and you miss your Self-Realization.

304
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,120
In short you should be presently

305
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,600
pleasantly placed towards yourself.

306
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,600
As I respect you, you must respect yourself.

307
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,200
As I love you, you must love yourself.

308
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,800
That's all I want.

309
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,520
The second condition is

310
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,200
that you have to forgive everyone in general,

311
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,520
that means you don't even have to think about

312
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,920
whom you have to forgive,

313
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,720
because that's a headache.

314
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,120
Logically, whether you forgive or you don't forgive

315
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,520
you don't do anything.

316
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,120
It's a myth.

317
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,520
But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands,

318
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,920
and the center on the optic chiasma is like this - constricted.

319
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,920
At this moment, if you don't forgive it won't open like this

320
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,000
and you will miss your chance,

321
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,720
such an important thing of Self-Realization.

322
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,920
So please forgive - in general I say.

323
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:42,120
Now, the third condition is

324
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,440
you have to take out your shoes.

325
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,440
Because this Mother Earth helps us.

326
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,520
Many people don't like the third condition sometimes.

327
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,920
In England, first time when I asked them

328
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,240
to take out their shoes, half of them walked off

329
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,640
very seriously.

330
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,120
Now, somebody will show you.

331
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,720
First you should see what we are going to do.

332
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,520
He must have told you that we have two channels, left and right

333
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,320
which are opposite to each other but are complimentary.

334
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:28,520
They look after the sympathetic nervous systems, left and right.

335
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,440
So the left one is for the power of desire, by which we desire,

336
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
mundane desire,

337
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,240
and in the right we have the power of action.

338
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,640
So you have to put your both feet apart from each other.

339
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,040
And put your left hand on your left lap

340
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,240
like this very comfortably.

341
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,240
This is suggestive and symbolic

342
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,560
of your desire to have Self-Realization.

343
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,560
So we use our right hand for the action.

344
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,160
Please be seated,

345
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,560
we have room here for you.

346
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,240
All of you have to sit down, please,

347
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,560
be comfortable.

348
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,960
You don't have to go to Himalaya,

349
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,440
stand on your head, shave off your hair, nothing of the kind.

350
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,640
Be comfortable.

351
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,840
So, now we put our right hand on our heart.

352
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,840
In the heart resides the Spirit.

353
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,640
Now if you become the Spirit,

354
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,240
you become your own guide and your own master.

355
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,360
Now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

356
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,160
on the left hand side.

357
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,560
We are working only on the left hand side.

358
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,440
Here is the center for your mastery.

359
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,760
Mastery over yourself and mastery over the knowledge,

360
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,480
the pure Divine knowledge.

361
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,680
It's created by great prophets and seers,

362
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,680
which is to be enlightened.

363
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,160
Now take down your hand into the lower portion of your abdomen

364
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,880
on the left hand side.

365
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,360
Surprisingly this is the center for pure Divine knowledge.

366
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,280
Now raise your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen.

367
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,880
Then on your heart.

368
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,280
Then in the corner of your neck and shoulder

369
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,280
and turn your head to your right.

370
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,960
Oh. It is there, that means you are feeling guilty.

371
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,560
Please don't feel guilty.

372
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,480
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across

373
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,480
and put down your head

374
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,480
this is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness

375
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,960
or forgive everyone.

376
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,160
In general without thinking about them.

377
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,760
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head

378
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,760
and push back your head as far as possible.

379
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,880
This is the center where without feeling guilty,

380
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,560
without counting your mistakes for your own satisfaction

381
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,280
you have to ask  forgiveness

382
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,280
from the All-Pervading Power of Divine love.

383
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,200
Now, the last center is very important, stretch your palm fully.

384
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,400
Now put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

385
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,400
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

386
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,960
Now push back your fingers, it's very important,

387
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,880
so that there's a good pressure on your scalp.

388
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,280
Now put down your head

389
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,280
and move your scalp slowly 16

390
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,600
- 7 times, 7 times, clockwise.

391
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,480
Now, that's all we have to do.

392
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,200
But please remember to push back your fingers.

393
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:03,200
Now again, see that your both legs are apart from each other,

394
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,200
and the left hand is on your left lap.

395
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,880
You can close your eyes and take out your spectacles,

396
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,080
please don't open your eyes till I tell you.

397
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,480
So now, put your right hand on your heart

398
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,400
and close your eyes.

399
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,680
Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental

400
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,480
question about yourself

401
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,320
- you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother.

402
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:06,320
Please say three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

403
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,320
Say in your heart.

404
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,920
As I told you, when you are the Spirit

405
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,600
you become your own guide, your own master.

406
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,120
So now please bring your right hand

407
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,000
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

408
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,320
and here you ask another fundamental question about yourself,

409
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:06,800
three times in your heart, "Mother, am I my own master?"

410
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,800
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

411
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,120
and I cannot force Self-Realization

412
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,600
or pure Divine knowledge on you

413
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,320
- so you have to ask for it.

414
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,600
So now, please take your right hand

415
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,720
in the lower portion of your abdomen

416
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:08,800
and ask six times, because this center has got six petals,

417
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,320
"Mother, please give me pure Divine knowledge."

418
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,320
As soon as you ask for the pure divine knowledge

419
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,120
the Kundalini starts rising within you.

420
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,320
So we have to nourish our upper centers

421
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,120
with our full self-confidence.

422
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,320
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

423
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,840
on the left hand side.

424
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,920
Here you have to say with full confidence ten times,

425
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,920
"Mother, I am my own master."

426
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,920
At the very outset, I told you

427
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,440
that you are not this body, this mind,

428
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,320
these emotions, this intelligence, these conditionings,

429
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,240
and the ego, but you are the pure Spirit.

430
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,240
So raise your right hand on your heart

431
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,040
and say with full confidence again, twelve times,

432
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,640
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

433
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,920
This All-Pervading Divine Power of Love

434
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,640
is the ocean of knowledge,

435
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,640
is the ocean of bliss and compassion,

436
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,920
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

437
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,120
So whatever mistakes you might have committed

438
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,920
can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness at this moment.

439
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,840
So please forgive yourself

440
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,240
and raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder

441
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,440
and turn your head to your right.

442
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,440
Here you have to say 16 times,

443
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,560
"Mother I am not guilty at all."

444
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Say it with full confidence.

445
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:04,760
I have already told you that logically,

446
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,560
whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything.

447
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,440
It is a myth,

448
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,560
but you are playing into wrong hands and torturing yourself.

449
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,960
At this moment, if you do not forgive,

450
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,240
the center of Agnya won't open and the Kundalini won't rise.

451
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,960
So please, please forgive, forgive everyone in general.

452
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,360
By raising your hand on top of your forehead,

453
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,640
put down your head.

454
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,240
And here you say,

455
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:17,440
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

456
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,640
Now without feeling guilty,

457
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,360
without counting your mistakes for your satisfaction

458
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,240
you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

459
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,160
So please take your right hand on the back side of your head

460
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,240
and push back your head.

461
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,280
Here you have to say,

462
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,160
"Oh Divine power, please forgive me,

463
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:26,360
if I have done any mistakes, knowingly or unknowingly."

464
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,880
Please say it in your heart, not how many times.

465
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,960
Now the last center you have to stretch your palm fully,

466
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,360
put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area

467
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,280
and put down your head.

468
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,160
Here again,

469
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,280
I cannot force Self-Realization on you, you have to ask for it.

470
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,760
Now, push back your fingers,

471
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,480
put a pressure on your scalp

472
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,560
and move it seven times saying,

473
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:46,480
"Mother, please give me my Self-Realization",

474
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,960
clockwise you have to move.

475
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,160
Push back your fingers

476
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,160
and move the scalp clockwise.

477
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,880
Please bend your heads, bend your heads.

478
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:00,760
Now, take down your hands

479
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,360
and please open your eyes slowly.

480
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,280
Put both the hands towards Me

481
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,400
and watch Me without thinking.

482
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,800
Now put the right hand towards Me

483
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,800
and put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area

484
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,400
and see for yourself if there's a cool, or a hot,

485
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,080
breeze-like vibrations are coming

486
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,960
out of your own fontanel bone area.

487
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:44,200
Now please put your left hand towards Me.

488
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,480
And now see with the right hand

489
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,800
if there is a cool or a hot breeze-like vibrations

490
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,960
coming from your own fontanel bone area.

491
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,480
If it is hot means you have not forgiven.

492
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,800
Please forgive now, at this moment.

493
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,680
Now, again with the right hand once again.

494
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,080
Please bend your head.

495
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,600
Now raise both your hands towards the sky,

496
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,400
push back your head.

497
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,080
Here you have to ask one of these three questions three times.

498
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,200
First one is,

499
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:09,480
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

500
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,320
Second is, "Mother

501
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:23,120
is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love,

502
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,120
is this the Ruh?"

503
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,400
The third is, "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?"

504
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,720
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

505
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,720
Now, take down your hands.

506
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,400
Please put your hands to Me.

507
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:09,800
All those who have felt the cool breeze on the fingertips

508
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:17,320
or on the palm or through their fontanel bone area,

509
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,520
cool breeze or hot breeze, raise both your hands.

510
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,600
May God bless you all,

511
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,920
you all have become saints now, I bow to you.

512
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,920
Now respect your Self-Realization.

513
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,600
Still you have to grow.

514
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,800
We have to understand that this is a collective process.

515
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,000
You cannot do it alone anyway.

516
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,000
So you have to come to collective.

517
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,400
Of course, you don't have to pay at all for anything.

518
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,320
But you have to give some time,

519
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,800
some importance to your Self-Realization.

520
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,920
So please, make it a point to come to the collective.

521
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,720
Very surprising, you don't know Me,

522
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,840
I am not an Austrian,

523
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,440
but when I come always the halls are full,

524
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,920
but when I go away they don't follow up, I don't know why.

525
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:20,120
Only in Russia, I have seen people have gone very deep,

526
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,920
they are so deep people, very deep people.

527
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,320
Once they get Realization they just get to it.

528
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:41,040
It's very surprising.

529
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,440
So I have to make a request to you

530
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,720
that though you have got it everything

531
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,640
so easily you have to grow into it.

532
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,320
You have to have the whole knowledge.

533
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:10,040
I must have spoken only in English language at least

534
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,640
- there must be 4'000, 5'000 lectures.

535
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:25,320
But they are only indications to know

536
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:29,840
what you are and to experience it.

537
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,320
Sahaja Yoga is an experience.

538
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:44,240
In Sanskrit, we have a word called Budha or Vida

539
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,440
that means to know the knowledge on your central nervous system.

540
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,840
From Budha the word Buddha has come.

541
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,840
From Vida the word Vedas has come.

542
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:18,360
So this knowledge is your own.

543
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,040
It was the ancient treasure,

544
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,440
but now is available to all of us.

545
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:37,560
So please try to understand the importance of your being.

546
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,560
I always come after one year

547
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,560
and I hope to come back to see you all.

548
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,360
May God bless you!

549
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,440
Thank you very much! May God bless you all!
