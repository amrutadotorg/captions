SHRI ADI SHAKTI PUJA

00:11:31.177 --> 00:11:40.902
Today we are going to do the puja
of Adi Shakti.

00:11:47.287 --> 00:11:54.079
It’s a difficult subject to talk about
Adi Shakti

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:05.233
because it’s not easy to understand

00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:11.727
that Adi Shakti is the power of Sadashiva.

00:12:11.973 --> 00:12:17.975
Sadashiva is the God Almighty.

00:12:18.998 --> 00:12:23.150
She is His breath, as they some people
call it.

00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:27.750
Some say She is the desire

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:39.549
and some say that She’s the entire power
of Sadashiva,

00:12:39.856 --> 00:12:49.496
and Sadashiva cannot do anything without
Her powers.

00:12:53.288 --> 00:13:02.101
This subject has been described by many
people in various books in different ways.

00:13:02.906 --> 00:13:09.181
But actually we need not go

00:13:09.382 --> 00:13:13.640
to the background of the creation
of Adi Shakti,

00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:20.670
for that at least you’ll need seven
lectures. But we’ll come to the point

00:13:20.871 --> 00:13:26.463
where Adi Shakti started working on this
Mother Earth.

00:13:28.077 --> 00:13:30.675
The first thing is we must know,

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:36.623
that She created a Kundalini in the Mother
Earth itself

00:13:37.658 --> 00:13:46.559
and She created Shri Ganesha out of
the Mother Earth, it’s very interesting.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.283
So the Mother Earth becomes a very
important thing for us.

00:13:52.484 --> 00:13:56.844
If we do not know how to respect the Mother
Earth,

00:13:57.315 --> 00:14:03.030
we do not know how to respect ourselves.

00:14:03.411 --> 00:14:08.727
The expression of Adi Shakti within you
is the Kundalini, no doubt.

00:14:08.928 --> 00:14:13.786
That is the reflection of Adi Shakti
in you.

00:14:13.987 --> 00:14:20.158
But the reflection in the Mother Earth is
also expressed,

00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:29.573
as you all know, in different places,
different countries, different cities,

00:14:29.774 --> 00:14:38.794
as the manifestation of chakras and
Adi Shakti’s creations.

00:14:38.995 --> 00:14:47.724
It was very important first to create
a very holy Mother Earth

00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:52.077
for human beings to be born on that.

00:14:52.958 --> 00:15:03.872
So the reflection of the Adi Shakti as
Kundalini first was on the Mother Earth.

00:15:04.073 --> 00:15:12.458
Kundalini is a, we should say, is a wee
part of the Adi Shakti,

00:15:13.104 --> 00:15:21.797
or we can say that She is the desire,
pure desire of the Adi Shakti.

00:15:21.998 --> 00:15:28.116
So Adi Shakti is the desire, complete
desire of Sadashiva

00:15:28.317 --> 00:15:41.388
and Kundalini, Adi Kundalini, is the desire,
complete desire of Adi Shakti.

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:46.048
Now this one was first expressed

00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:53.166
in the Mother Earth, inside the Mother
Earth.

00:15:54.602 --> 00:16:00.340
Inside the Mother Earth, the Kundalini
came up

00:16:01.264 --> 00:16:08.214
in such a way that it cooled down the inner
part of the Mother Earth

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:11.839
as much as it could,

00:16:12.925 --> 00:16:25.175
and then it manifested on the surface
of the earth as different chakras.

00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:34.920
So it’s tremendous similarity that we have

00:16:36.166 --> 00:16:43.190
with Virata, the Mother Earth and the human
beings.

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:56.913
If all of them are being reflected by
the Adi Kundalini,

00:16:57.114 --> 00:17:03.097
so there has to be a great connection
between them.

00:17:03.963 --> 00:17:13.705
It is not understood by human beings how
they are connected to this Mother Earth.

00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:19.170
This Kundalini passed through different
centers, creating different centers

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:26.859
in the Mother Earth and ultimately broke
through Kailasha.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.718
And I don’t know how many have you been
to Kailash you’ll see

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:36.915
tremendous vibrations flowing out
of Kailash.

00:17:37.738 --> 00:17:42.870
Now the way we insult our Mother Earth,

00:17:43.164 --> 00:17:50.839
what we are doing is we are insulting
the Adi Shakti.

00:17:51.157 --> 00:17:57.167
So many ways there are we should respect
the Mother Earth.

00:17:57.368 --> 00:18:05.318
I mean it was an Indian custom to begin
with, when you got up from your bed

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:09.399
and you touched the Mother Earth with
your feet,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.424
you have to say, “Oh Mother Earth, please
forgive me

00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:19.130
because I’m touching you with my feet”.

00:18:21.265 --> 00:18:30.276
All the movements of Mother Earth are
controlled by this inner Kundalini,

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:34.317
which is the reflection of Adi Shakti.

00:18:34.518 --> 00:18:40.395
The gravity that it has also is
the manifestation

00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:46.326
of the Kundalini of the Mother Earth.

00:18:46.527 --> 00:18:55.910
Now, why we are suffering in this beautiful
planet,

00:18:56.111 --> 00:19:02.559
because we do not respect what we have
to respect the most.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.950
Mother Earth is to be respected, meaning
what?

00:19:08.151 --> 00:19:17.166
Meaning that whatever is created on this
earth, by the movement of the earth,

00:19:17.367 --> 00:19:24.525
by the sea, by all the elements, has to be
respected.

00:19:24.894 --> 00:19:33.448
Today’s problem is pollution, all kinds
of things people talk of.

00:19:33.649 --> 00:19:38.603
The reason behind it, people never
understood the importance

00:19:38.804 --> 00:19:46.496
of all these five elements which are
supportive of our life.

00:19:46.697 --> 00:19:51.539
So to respect the Mother Earth people do
Bhumi Puja.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.066
Many people, when they are building
a house,

00:19:55.267 --> 00:20:00.062
they will do the Bhumi Pujan, means they
will respect the Mother Earth,

00:20:00.263 --> 00:20:06.289
because if She is not being respected maybe
there could be an earthquake,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:16.606
which means that this Mother Earth
understands, knows and acts.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:25.524
It acts in such a manner that human beings
don’t understand why such things happen.

00:20:25.725 --> 00:20:32.207
Now, we can say that, in a place called
Latur,

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:43.379
it was Shri Ganesha’s fourteenth day and
they had to submerge

00:20:44.124 --> 00:20:53.424
the statues into the sea or into the river,
so they went all out, singing, dancing.

00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:58.763
After coming from there they all started
drinking,

00:20:59.122 --> 00:21:06.365
and drinking is not liked by Mother Earth
at all.

00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:12.222
If you are drunk and you are walking
on the road you’ll fall down.

00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:22.735
It so happened with their drinking that
a big earthquake broke in,

00:21:22.936 --> 00:21:27.805
and all those who were dancing, were
drinking, all of them

00:21:28.006 --> 00:21:33.272
were engulfed into that earthquake by
Mother Earth.

00:21:33.473 --> 00:21:41.267
Only our center, which is there, was
surrounded by a big gap

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:50.627
but nothing happened to our center and not
one single Sahaja Yogi was ruined by that.

00:21:50.828 --> 00:21:56.723
We can understand because we are Sahaja
Yogis, how the Mother Earth has acted

00:21:56.924 --> 00:22:01.500
to save those people, who were Sahaja
Yogis.

00:22:01.701 --> 00:22:08.606
So the understanding of Mother Earth about
saints is very great.

00:22:08.807 --> 00:22:17.333
She knows who is a saint, She knows
the feet of a saint

00:22:17.534 --> 00:22:23.687
and that’s why, you know so many things
were created, like Moses,

00:22:23.888 --> 00:22:29.931
He went to the sea and the Mother Earth
came up, for them to walk through.

00:22:30.132 --> 00:22:37.499
If all the Jews had walked, it would not
have worked, but it was Moses

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:44.493
and His saintliness that the Mother Earth
Herself came up and helped.

00:22:44.694 --> 00:22:55.213
In the same way when Rama was building
a big bridge between Lanka and India,

00:22:55.414 --> 00:22:59.588
the Mother Earth came up as a bridge.

00:22:59.881 --> 00:23:07.511
So we should not try to curse the Mother
Earth for any mishaps on this Earth.

00:23:07.725 --> 00:23:13.548
If people are saintly they will be always
protected by Mother Earth.

00:23:13.749 --> 00:23:19.446
She will always try to give them whatever
they want.

00:23:19.647 --> 00:23:26.284
You can see in the minute way, that
supposing now, in our Cabella here,

00:23:26.485 --> 00:23:32.033
the roses are of such a big size, such
a big size roses,

00:23:32.242 --> 00:23:38.768
you won’t find such big size in the whole
world. But we have here, such big ones.

00:23:38.969 --> 00:23:43.844
In Pratisthan we had

00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:51.167
flowers of sunflower so big as that.
One man could not lift it.

00:23:51.368 --> 00:23:56.714
Now, how is it all this is happening
in particular places?

00:23:56.915 --> 00:24:02.159
Is the Mother Earth who knows who is living
here,

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:11.552
who is walking on Her back we should say,
or on Her soil,

00:24:11.753 --> 00:24:16.543
because Mother Earth understands
vibrations.

00:24:16.744 --> 00:24:24.102
Now, certain places we say that are very
holy.

00:24:30.558 --> 00:24:37.574
How have they discovered that these places
are holy, because of magnetic forces.

00:24:37.775 --> 00:24:42.781
The magnetic forces in England I was
surprised, were crossing each other

00:24:42.982 --> 00:24:45.912
at a place called Oxted where we lived.

00:24:46.113 --> 00:24:50.706
They were crossing since long, but we lived
there later on.

00:24:50.907 --> 00:25:00.093
So Mother Earth also organizes and arranges
things for saintly people.

00:25:00.294 --> 00:25:06.903
It's very interesting to see how the Mother
Earth guides you in a proper way.

00:25:07.104 --> 00:25:10.054
I mean, I don't know how many instances
I can give you.

00:25:10.255 --> 00:25:15.780
But we don’t understand the value of
the understanding of this Mother Earth

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:22.054
and Her loving protection for all
he saints.

00:25:22.275 --> 00:25:29.102
In the same way, we have to understand how
the whole atmosphere, the rain,

00:25:29.303 --> 00:25:33.344
comes in at the right time, the moon,
the sun,

00:25:33.545 --> 00:25:40.418
everything works out in such a beautiful
manner because they know it’s a saint.

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:47.742
They know these are saintly people sitting
here. They know that they are pure people,

00:25:47.943 --> 00:25:54.551
that they are the essence of life and they
should be looked after,

00:25:54.752 --> 00:25:59.000
they should be cared for, they should be
bothered for.

00:25:59.201 --> 00:26:05.444
It is not bothered about people who are
of no use.

00:26:05.645 --> 00:26:12.142
For example now for Haj, so many people
went and so many were killed.

00:26:12.343 --> 00:26:17.200
Some went to Amarnath and they were killed
because they were not saints,

00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:22.978
just ritualistic people, going for a ritual
which,

00:26:23.179 --> 00:26:32.360
in the discretion of the Mother Earth, was
of no avail and of no advantage to them.

00:26:32.561 --> 00:26:35.899
But nobody learns from this, nobody learns.

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:40.086
When so many people were going to say,
Amarnath were killed,

00:26:40.287 --> 00:26:44.627
Pakistan said, “See, they should not have
gone to this Amarnath,

00:26:44.828 --> 00:26:50.896
it’s a false place, why did they go there?
And by going there

00:26:51.097 --> 00:26:55.541
what has proved is that it’s not a holy
place”.

00:26:55.742 --> 00:26:59.487
But when the Haj thing took place, they had
nothing to say,

00:26:59.688 --> 00:27:02.738
they didn’t know how to explain this
Haj business

00:27:02.939 --> 00:27:07.712
and the killing – dying of so many people.

00:27:07.913 --> 00:27:15.437
The reason is this, that these people have
been going to Haj all the time.

00:27:15.638 --> 00:27:19.460
Once there was a stampede with thirty-two
thousand people being

00:27:19.661 --> 00:27:24.118
injured and troubled and killed. Now this
is it.

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:32.429
Now, what is Mother Earth suggesting, that
going to these places,

00:27:32.635 --> 00:27:39.305
holy places, they are really holy, no doubt;
going to these places,

00:27:39.506 --> 00:27:43.671
you are not doing any spiritual ascent.

00:27:43.872 --> 00:27:51.098
You are not achieving anything by going
to these places, which are really holy.

00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:55.157
That cannot be challenged. They are holy
places.

00:27:55.358 --> 00:28:00.210
You must be knowing that I was born
in Chindwara, and Mecca and Chindwara

00:28:00.411 --> 00:28:05.852
are on the same Cancer line. How is it?

00:28:06.053 --> 00:28:13.022
What is about Mecca? Mecca is
Makkeshwarashiv – it’s a Shiva.

00:28:13.223 --> 00:28:19.803
Why did Mohammed Sahib ask people
to worship a stone?

00:28:20.004 --> 00:28:24.752
He didn’t believe in stones, He was against
all kinds of idol worship;

00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:29.765
then why did He say this black stone,
which is there, has to be worshipped,

00:28:29.966 --> 00:28:33.582
for that people have to go there. What was
the reason?

00:28:33.783 --> 00:28:38.924
Because He could feel the vibrations, He
could feel that it’s a swayambhu,

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:42.977
so He said it. So all the Muslims like mad
are going there.

00:28:43.178 --> 00:28:49.620
By going there nobody has improved, I have
not seen anybody improved by going to Mecca.

00:28:49.821 --> 00:28:53.996
It's just a kind of a ritual. They think
if they go there,

00:28:54.197 --> 00:28:58.186
when they will die tomorrow they will tell
God, “See now, we have a certificate,

00:28:58.387 --> 00:29:01.316
we have been to Mecca.”

00:29:03.319 --> 00:29:09.149
Like our pope once upon a time used to give
certificate, that when you go to heaven,

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:15.383
you can show the certificate that now you
are a real Christian.

00:29:15.584 --> 00:29:22.536
In this way, all these artificial things
came up, but there is reality behind it.

00:29:22.737 --> 00:29:29.108
The difference is the reality is for
the real people and not for false people.

00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:32.444
But this ritualism has grown too much.

00:29:32.645 --> 00:29:39.655
Like in India we have many swayambhus
created by the Kundalini again I would say,

00:29:39.856 --> 00:29:43.053
and which are really worshipped.

00:29:43.254 --> 00:29:49.974
I’ve been to most of them and I was
surprised that most of the pujaris

00:29:50.175 --> 00:29:55.244
were suffering from some sort of a serious
disease. Like one was a paralyzed fellow.

00:29:55.445 --> 00:29:59.669
He said, “We are serving this God here,
and You said this is swayambhu;

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.393
then Mother, how, why is it we are
suffering from this disease?”

00:30:03.594 --> 00:30:08.389
I said, “Because you are just making money.
You can’t make money out of God.

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:12.981
If you don’t want to serve God, you don’t
stay here, but if you want to serve God,

00:30:13.182 --> 00:30:18.170
then you can stay here, but don’t make
money out of this”.

00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:25.450
It’s very common, I have seen, those people
who make money get paralysis, I’ve seen it.

00:30:27.515 --> 00:30:35.210
It’s a very deep understanding all these
elements, Mother Earth,

00:30:35.411 --> 00:30:40.162
everybody has about everything.

00:30:41.233 --> 00:30:46.369
Because their Kundalini is not like your
Kundalini,

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:56.727
which is, though in itself is pure, but
because of your human endeavors,

00:30:56.928 --> 00:31:02.376
human mistakes, ego, superego, all sorts
of nonsense,

00:31:02.577 --> 00:31:11.058
the Kundalini is not so sensitive, nor does
it tell you what is happening.

00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:20.505
It has to be very alert, sensitive
spirituality within you,

00:31:20.706 --> 00:31:27.759
by which you can say immediately what you
think,

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.743
what you know, what you understand about
anything.

00:31:32.944 --> 00:31:38.597
But the problem is that this doesn’t exist.

00:31:38.884 --> 00:31:43.830
Why is it you should not be so sensitive?

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:48.503
On the contrary, I have seen, if their
mind works against somebody,

00:31:48.704 --> 00:31:51.341
then they start saying, “You are catching
on this, you are catching on that,

00:31:51.461 --> 00:31:56.960
you are catching on that”. Actually
the person who’s saying that is catching.

00:31:57.662 --> 00:32:03.140
So with this thing one has to understand
that if we are the true reflection

00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:14.652
of Adi Shakti, then we should be pure,
absolutely pure, like the white snow.

00:32:14.853 --> 00:32:19.847
Even one black drop – that’s why I wore
today the white sari -

00:32:20.048 --> 00:32:23.866
falls on the white, it shows.

00:32:24.129 --> 00:32:34.580
You should be so white that anything,
any minute black spot

00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:44.430
also should be seen by you, and in others
also to be felt by you.

00:32:45.057 --> 00:32:59.538
If that height is achieved by pure life,
by pure thinking, by pure heart,

00:32:59.739 --> 00:33:05.654
it is not necessary to manipulate anything;
no, no need at all.

00:33:05.855 --> 00:33:12.944
It’s all natural like the Mother Earth is.
Does She manipulate anything? Nothing.

00:33:13.145 --> 00:33:18.162
Just see how spontaneous She is. You put
a seed in the Mother Earth

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:22.274
and see how it sprouts.

00:33:22.475 --> 00:33:28.298
She is so spontaneous, Her activity is so
spontaneous, we never wonder about it.

00:33:28.499 --> 00:33:32.542
See different types of flowers, different
types of fragrance,

00:33:32.743 --> 00:33:36.885
different types of shrubs and trees,

00:33:37.086 --> 00:33:42.372
how She grows with such balance in every
place.

00:33:42.573 --> 00:33:51.906
In every minute atom and molecule of that
Mother Earth there is sense.

00:33:53.886 --> 00:34:01.716
So before us is the best reflection of the
Adi Shakti and that is this Mother Earth.

00:34:01.917 --> 00:34:05.097
So first we must respect the Mother Earth.

00:34:05.298 --> 00:34:08.942
I like you people because you are sitting
on the ground, it’s very good.

00:34:09.143 --> 00:34:13.886
For meditation if you can sit on the Mother
Earth it will be extremely good

00:34:14.087 --> 00:34:19.131
because the special quality of the Mother
Earth, which also I have unfortunately,

00:34:19.332 --> 00:34:26.440
that I suck your problems. She too sucks
your problem

00:34:26.641 --> 00:34:32.174
and when She sucks your problem you get
rid of them without any difficulties.

00:34:32.375 --> 00:34:39.536
So, if you cannot, say, sit on the ground,
then you take a stone, better is,

00:34:39.737 --> 00:34:45.963
or you can have a marble, or something which
is natural on which you should try to sit.

00:34:46.164 --> 00:34:50.404
But if you sit on the plastic and do your
meditation, I don’t know

00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:54.286
what is going to help you – the plastic?

00:34:54.522 --> 00:34:59.050
That’s why I request you always, that use
natural things,

00:34:59.251 --> 00:35:06.437
because natural things can absorb your
problems very well.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:10.185
Unnaturally also we live otherwise.

00:35:10.386 --> 00:35:14.217
You see it is on the physical line, also
on mental line.

00:35:14.418 --> 00:35:23.509
On mental line what do we do, that we go on
arguing, explaining,

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:28.650
it’s going on and on and on and on! There’s
no end to it.

00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:34.227
One should get headache, you see, actually
with all that. But if you are spontaneous,

00:35:34.428 --> 00:35:38.569
if you are very spontaneous, immediately
you will know

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:44.204
what the other fellow is trying to do or
to say or to communicate.

00:35:44.405 --> 00:35:46.694
You don’t need much thinking about it,

00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:51.367
because you can absorb even the thought
of another person.

00:35:51.568 --> 00:35:56.413
Absorb doesn’t mean that you take the bad
thing of that person,

00:35:56.614 --> 00:36:02.773
but it’s like the sieving out. You absorb
what another person is saying

00:36:02.974 --> 00:36:05.840
and you sieve it out.

00:36:07.672 --> 00:36:14.039
Now the problem of this Adi Shakti is this,
that I decided

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:21.928
that I will have all of you enter into
My body, absorb all of you.

00:36:22.133 --> 00:36:26.215
It’s a very dangerous game I know, but
I did play,

00:36:26.416 --> 00:36:31.072
because I’m supposed to do at this stage
of time,

00:36:31.273 --> 00:36:35.018
that I should absorb you all in My body.

00:36:35.219 --> 00:36:39.255
So with you, all your problems are also
gone into Me,

00:36:39.456 --> 00:36:42.438
all your troubles also have gone into Me.

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:46.977
But by absorbing it, see, it’s like ocean
into which you are put

00:36:47.178 --> 00:36:56.341
and you are cleansed. But what about
the ocean?

00:36:56.738 --> 00:37:03.477
Ocean has got still your problems and things
lingering and they are very troublesome.

00:37:03.678 --> 00:37:09.157
So the best thing would be for you
to cleanse yourself.

00:37:09.403 --> 00:37:14.543
Cleansing is very important through
introspection.

00:37:14.744 --> 00:37:18.009
But doesn’t mean thinking, never means
thinking.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:23.684
But introspection means meditation and that
you all should meditate.

00:37:23.885 --> 00:37:28.415
I must tell you, we had a meeting
of the leaders

00:37:28.616 --> 00:37:32.278
and they came out and sat in the drawing
room.

00:37:32.479 --> 00:37:36.986
As soon as they assembled I had such
a severe pain in the stomach

00:37:37.187 --> 00:37:42.902
and I had such a bad diarrhea that you
can’t believe.

00:37:43.103 --> 00:37:47.731
Now, who has got those problems, I don’t
know.

00:37:52.251 --> 00:37:55.287
Who has brought these problems, I don’t
know.

00:37:55.488 --> 00:38:02.353
But as a Mother, as a Mother, I don’t mind
anything,

00:38:02.554 --> 00:38:06.590
as long as you all get well and purified.

00:38:06.791 --> 00:38:11.575
Just like as the Mother Earth cares for you,
I also care for you.

00:38:11.776 --> 00:38:15.936
And just like as the Mother Earth loves you,
I also love you,

00:38:16.137 --> 00:38:19.356
whether you are bad or good is not
the point.

00:38:19.557 --> 00:38:26.474
But to be kind to Me if you could try to be
really good Sahaja Yogis,

00:38:26.675 --> 00:38:32.178
not a showoffs, not business-like, not only
thinking type,

00:38:32.379 --> 00:38:36.060
not argumentative, not criticizing others;

00:38:36.261 --> 00:38:41.049
if you just try to meditate every day ten
to fifteen minutes,

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:47.021
I tell you, My health will be first class.
Because I have taken your injections inside

00:38:47.222 --> 00:38:51.533
and they start torturing My life for nothing
at all.

00:38:51.734 --> 00:38:57.422
See so, now, it’s a risk I have run, and
I am sure you are all very sensible people,

00:38:57.623 --> 00:39:01.817
and you will understand that your Mother
shouldn’t suffer.

00:39:02.018 --> 00:39:05.158
This is every-day crucifixion for Me
sometimes you know,

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:11.030
and I don’t know what to say. For example,
the other day in Delhi,

00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:14.929
one gentleman who is a leader, came to Me,
to see Me,

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:19.430
and My one foot started going like that
and paining so much.

00:39:19.597 --> 00:39:22.507
I mean I didn’t know what to tell him that,
“You get out now,”

00:39:22.708 --> 00:39:24.899
because I just can’t hurt him, you know.

00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:28.979
But I said, “What’s the matter, where have
you been, what did you do?”

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:34.459
And so he realized and he went out, and
really it improved.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:40.527
Nearness also, I think, has an effect,
because if a man like that is,

00:39:40.728 --> 00:39:45.745
or a lady like that is full of problems and
she comes

00:39:45.961 --> 00:39:53.972
very much closer to My attention, then I
have to take up the cross, it’s like this.

00:39:54.173 --> 00:40:00.235
A very simple understanding should be that,
“Why are we in Sahaja Yoga?”.

00:40:00.441 --> 00:40:07.705
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend, to go
higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:13.720
It was very entertaining yesterday the way
you talked about your

00:40:13.921 --> 00:40:21.717
ambition to be higher and higher. Really
it was very joy-giving, no doubt.

00:40:21.918 --> 00:40:27.999
But what are we doing about it, what are
we trying about it, we should see.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.325
Seriously we must think, are we meditating,

00:40:32.526 --> 00:40:37.768
are we all doing something to elevate
others also,

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:41.806
to give realizations to others? Specially
women I have seen,

00:40:42.007 --> 00:40:46.836
don’t do much of this, which is very bad,
because you are the mothers.

00:40:47.037 --> 00:40:51.255
You have to go all out to give realizations
to others.

00:40:51.456 --> 00:40:57.117
But men are more active that way and women
are not. So it works the other way round.

00:40:57.318 --> 00:41:03.232
Now on one side the men are, I think are
active but don’t meditate.

00:41:03.433 --> 00:41:08.759
Women meditate and men do the outside work,
it’s sort of a part-time,

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:16.924
or you can call it a good labor division
that, “You meditate at home

00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:20.328
and we’ll go all out”. It’s not going
to work out.

00:41:20.529 --> 00:41:27.542
So one has to meditate and one has to also
go out

00:41:27.743 --> 00:41:33.037
to spread Sahaja Yoga.  Both things have
to be done.

00:41:33.238 --> 00:41:39.615
Supposing now you meditate and you don’t
spread Sahaja Yoga, you will never ascend.

00:41:39.816 --> 00:41:45.499
Because after all this Kundalini, you see,
She’s a sensible woman, na,

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:52.660
She’s very sensible. She thinks, “Why
should I make her a saint?

00:41:52.861 --> 00:41:58.171
What is the use?”. Sahaja Yoga is not
individualistic,

00:41:58.372 --> 00:42:04.601
it’s not for one person to become a saint
and sit somewhere, it’s not like that.

00:42:05.129 --> 00:42:09.160
It’s not meant for one person, for oneself,

00:42:09.361 --> 00:42:13.670
it’s not individualistic. It’s a collective
happening.

00:42:13.871 --> 00:42:16.937
So if you are not helping to
the collective,

00:42:17.138 --> 00:42:21.647
Kundalini says, “All right, you are
all right as it is”, just like our body.

00:42:21.848 --> 00:42:26.099
See, in our body if one organ says,
“All right, now I am all right,

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:31.004
I am not going to work out”, or one cell
says that, “I am not going to now grow,

00:42:31.124 --> 00:42:35.066
it’s all right. Why should I worry about
the whole body?”, it won’t work.

00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:39.780
It’s a living, it’s a living organism,
I have told you hundred times,

00:42:39.981 --> 00:42:48.277
when it is a living organism it has to grow,
it has to grow and also to absorb.

00:42:48.478 --> 00:42:52.254
To have energy you have to meditate and
you have to grow.

00:42:52.455 --> 00:42:56.795
If you don’t grow, you are finished. You
are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

00:42:56.996 --> 00:43:03.923
I wouldn’t call a person a Sahaja Yogi who
has not even given one person realization.

00:43:04.403 --> 00:43:09.702
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi, Sahaja Yogi has
to give realizations to others.

00:43:09.903 --> 00:43:13.733
Apart from other activities, the main
activity should be

00:43:13.934 --> 00:43:16.923
how we give realizations to others.

00:43:17.124 --> 00:43:22.556
Unless and until we really look after that
side of life

00:43:22.757 --> 00:43:27.164
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:27.742 --> 00:43:35.501
For example now, take My position. I’m
all right, I’m complete, I have no problem.

00:43:35.719 --> 00:43:44.142
But why did I work so hard and wanted
so many Sahaja Yogis, why?

00:43:44.343 --> 00:43:48.335
What was the - I don’t have to grow either,
I’m overgrown already.

00:43:48.536 --> 00:43:51.900
I don’t have to do it, but why? What is
the need?

00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:56.176
The need is like this, the need is of love.

00:43:56.377 --> 00:44:00.477
I have so much love that I have
to channelize it.

00:44:00.678 --> 00:44:05.554
If I don’t I’ll suffocate, I can’t love
Myself.

00:44:05.762 --> 00:44:10.617
So this love has to spread. For that I have
to have you people,

00:44:10.818 --> 00:44:14.916
who can take this love to others and make
them happy.

00:44:15.117 --> 00:44:20.239
This is a kind of a vision I have,

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:27.832
and in this special time, it was promised
by many people, by many saints,

00:44:28.033 --> 00:44:34.788
and it is so obvious that you are all
specially chosen for this kind of thing.

00:44:34.989 --> 00:44:40.689
Now how far you understand your importance
is a different point.

00:44:45.164 --> 00:44:52.047
You do for your emancipation, all right,
you meditate.

00:44:52.248 --> 00:44:59.250
But if you are not channelizing the love,
the Divine love, what is the use?

00:44:59.451 --> 00:45:03.118
Now supposing I repair something very
nicely:

00:45:03.319 --> 00:45:08.219
I repair this machine nicely, put it right,
everything, and I don’t speak,

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.697
what’s the use of having this?

00:45:12.229 --> 00:45:16.951
In the same way, if you work very hard,
I know people who get up at four o’clock,

00:45:17.152 --> 00:45:20.194
have their baths, do meditation,

00:45:20.395 --> 00:45:24.916
sit down, in the night again they sit down
for meditation.

00:45:25.117 --> 00:45:31.211
But they never go out, they never talk
to others, they never spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:31.412 --> 00:45:38.901
They do not give Divine love to others, so
how can this great problem of this world

00:45:39.072 --> 00:45:45.121
be solved, that it has no love? It has
never known Divine love.

00:45:45.302 --> 00:45:51.255
It has to be given to them.

00:45:51.456 --> 00:46:00.783
They have to feel this Divine love, this
power of Adi Shakti.

00:46:00.984 --> 00:46:06.045
They have to know it. Otherwise you have
been selfish, I would say,

00:46:06.246 --> 00:46:12.641
that you had a nice time having all this
and you have not given it to others.

00:46:12.879 --> 00:46:17.275
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga
sometimes fails

00:46:17.476 --> 00:46:22.912
to create a proper balanced personality
in a human being.

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:27.187
Some people are like this, that now
supposing

00:46:27.368 --> 00:46:31.984
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja
Yogi, take a position like that.

00:46:32.185 --> 00:46:37.558
Now My desire is that they should develop
a complete understanding of each other,

00:46:37.759 --> 00:46:45.092
love for each other, but love for Sahaja
Yoga and for others.

00:46:45.293 --> 00:46:53.122
This is the only way we can justify
marriage in Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:53.323 --> 00:46:59.230
otherwise why should they marry? But
doesn’t happen like that.

00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:05.807
What happens is once they are married then
either they will quarrel,

00:47:06.008 --> 00:47:10.691
they will ask for divorce; if that doesn’t
happen luckily,

00:47:10.892 --> 00:47:14.261
because in Sahaja Yoga so easy to get
married, you know.

00:47:14.462 --> 00:47:20.522
If that doesn’t happen, then they start
having their own family,

00:47:20.723 --> 00:47:29.065
their own homes, they are again becoming
very small, very, very small, very limited.

00:47:29.266 --> 00:47:33.217
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

00:47:34.627 --> 00:47:37.154
You have to realize your responsibility.

00:47:37.274 --> 00:47:42.163
See this Mother Earth, how She knows
Her responsibility.

00:47:42.364 --> 00:47:48.904
She’s just made out of nothing but soil,
some mud, but look at Her.

00:47:49.105 --> 00:47:55.089
How She is conscious, how She is
particular, how She..., how She is careful.

00:47:55.291 --> 00:48:00.656
While you, though you have been blessed
so much by everything

00:48:00.857 --> 00:48:05.728
you are, are you thinking of giving it
to others?

00:48:05.929 --> 00:48:12.285
With twelve disciples, whatever was
the problem of Christianity, I mean

00:48:12.486 --> 00:48:20.481
it was nothing good job, I must say, but
still Christianity spread out.

00:48:21.054 --> 00:48:25.139
Islam was not a very good job either,
it spread out.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:32.281
All those bad jobs have spread out so much,
so why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:32.482 --> 00:48:36.695
It has to spread, it has to go to various
places.

00:48:36.896 --> 00:48:41.064
Try and find out where you can go and talk
about it

00:48:41.265 --> 00:48:46.196
and do something good to others and help
them somehow

00:48:46.397 --> 00:48:56.667
to rise above this common existence
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

00:48:56.898 --> 00:49:02.022
The time is very short and I think if you
see the time,

00:49:02.223 --> 00:49:06.866
the rate at which we are moving is not
proper.

00:49:07.067 --> 00:49:10.523
We have to be much faster, we have to go
much ahead

00:49:10.724 --> 00:49:16.121
and we have to create much more Sahaja
Yogis

00:49:16.322 --> 00:49:24.565
through our consistent, very intensive
effort.

00:49:24.766 --> 00:49:30.807
But we - it’s a side issue, you see, it’s
by the way, Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

00:49:31.008 --> 00:49:34.941
And this is where we are failing in our
responsibility.

00:49:35.125 --> 00:49:37.637
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

00:49:37.838 --> 00:49:43.086
You might say that, “Mataji, how can we be
like you? After all You are Adi Shakti”.

00:49:43.287 --> 00:49:46.302
Many people say that. “You are Adi Shakti,
so what,

00:49:46.503 --> 00:49:49.578
you see, with one finger You can move
things like that”.

00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:55.731
But why should I? Why should I, what
is the need?

00:49:56.150 --> 00:50:01.359
So in that reflection that you are Me,

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:06.374
in that reflection that the Mother Earth
is Me,

00:50:06.575 --> 00:50:11.321
in that beautiful creation within you,

00:50:11.522 --> 00:50:19.630
you have to become very sensitive
to the need of the world.

00:50:19.912 --> 00:50:24.318
What is the need of the world? Today,
if you fail,

00:50:24.519 --> 00:50:29.721
the whole thing will fail forever. Only
very few will be there.

00:50:29.922 --> 00:50:36.981
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja
Yoga, because this love

00:50:37.182 --> 00:50:42.666
is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed
by you,

00:50:42.856 --> 00:50:50.619
but is to be enjoyed by as many possible
in the whole world.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:56.890
So today we have to decide that, as
the children of Adi Shakti,

00:50:57.091 --> 00:51:02.426
we have to go all out, everywhere, every
corner,

00:51:02.627 --> 00:51:12.068
we have to shout and we have to tell loudly
what is the time in which we are living,

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:24.261
and what is the responsibility that you
have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.

00:51:24.462 --> 00:51:28.471
There must be some reason why you are here.

00:51:28.672 --> 00:51:34.524
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used
to ask Me, “Mother, was I this last life,

00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:39.548
was I Shivaji last life?” I said, “What’s
the use?

00:51:39.749 --> 00:51:42.962
You might have been anything, but what are
you today is much higher”.

00:51:43.163 --> 00:51:47.975
Try to understand. You might be, say,
Napoleon,

00:51:48.176 --> 00:51:55.067
you might be, say, one of the kings say,
or maybe the queen from somewhere.

00:51:55.268 --> 00:52:00.939
So what, what did they do? Did they raise
anybody’s Kundalini?

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:05.662
Did they have any power? Even the disciples
of Christ

00:52:05.863 --> 00:52:11.325
or even Mohammed Sahib’s disciples, anyone
- did they do it?

00:52:11.526 --> 00:52:16.373
Did they have any understanding
of Kundalini?

00:52:16.574 --> 00:52:24.461
Did they have any love for others, that
they should give them realization?

00:52:24.662 --> 00:52:28.449
There were some Sufis, they never gave
realization to anyone.

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:32.101
There were so many saints who never gave
realization to anybody.

00:52:32.302 --> 00:52:35.093
Mohammed Sahib never gave realization
to anybody.

00:52:35.294 --> 00:52:39.422
Gautam Buddha never gave realization
to anybody, think of it.

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:43.433
Christ never gave realization to anybody.
Anybody.

00:52:43.634 --> 00:52:50.001
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not. Nobody
- but you can do it!

00:52:51.645 --> 00:52:56.972
You can do it and you know everything about
Kundalini.

00:52:57.173 --> 00:53:03.602
It’s a very big thing because you are
children of the Adi Shakti.

00:53:03.803 --> 00:53:08.045
You are here and your Mother is here.

00:53:08.246 --> 00:53:15.185
It’s a very, very fortunate thing for Me
that you are here.

00:53:15.386 --> 00:53:21.097
I’m very proud of you, but again and again
I have to tell you that

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:27.564
the work has to be with a faster speed,
we have to move with a faster speed

00:53:27.765 --> 00:53:30.846
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:31.047 --> 00:53:37.799
It is rather, rather difficult for Me to say
something forcefully,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.529
that’s not My nature you know. Can’t get
into tempers and cannot get angry,

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:50.840
and I cannot forcefully say something
to you, but if you fail,

00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:56.573
then only thing will be that you have
failed Me completely.

00:53:56.783 --> 00:54:02.078
It means that, nothing less than that, and
if you don’t want to do it,

00:54:02.279 --> 00:54:07.674
then I would request all of you to take a
vow today that you will spread Sahaja Yoga

00:54:07.875 --> 00:54:11.273
and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga, know
about Sahaj Yog.

00:54:11.474 --> 00:54:14.045
There are many who don’t know anything.

00:54:14.246 --> 00:54:17.946
Also it’s very surprising they are Sahaja
Yogis, they don’t know anything.

00:54:18.147 --> 00:54:21.917
And don’t create problems for Me, like
marriage:

00:54:22.118 --> 00:54:25.156
“We can’t now live now with the wife,
we can’t live with the husband”.

00:54:25.357 --> 00:54:30.907
All sorts of nonsensical problems people
create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:31.108 --> 00:54:35.766
Are you here to create problems, or
to remove problems of people?

00:54:35.967 --> 00:54:41.527
So on the whole we have done well I must
say, but it’s not the final.

00:54:41.728 --> 00:54:47.753
We have to work faster with more enthusiasm
and joyfully.

00:54:47.954 --> 00:54:51.963
You don’t know what joy you get when you
give realization to somebody.

00:54:52.164 --> 00:54:58.014
It’s the most joyful moment is when you
give realizations to others.

00:54:58.215 --> 00:55:02.149
Just try, you must try once, you’ll
enjoy it,

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:06.552
then you’ll want more and more and more.
Now after Sahaja Yoga really

00:55:06.753 --> 00:55:12.618
the want disappears into this desire that,
“My God, this man is going,

00:55:12.819 --> 00:55:14.752
should I call him and give him
realization?”

00:55:14.953 --> 00:55:17.280
On the street you will feel like calling
him, “Come here, come here,

00:55:17.481 --> 00:55:22.459
I want to give you something”, then make
him sit down, give realization.

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:27.238
This will be your style, like mad - you’ll
say, “Oh no, no, look at this,

00:55:27.439 --> 00:55:32.316
this gentleman is without any realization,
let us give him”.

00:55:32.517 --> 00:55:35.098
You’ll have to go to churches, you’ll have
to go to universities,

00:55:35.218 --> 00:55:37.503
you have to go to all such congregations

00:55:37.704 --> 00:55:40.834
where they have no idea about what they
can achieve;

00:55:41.035 --> 00:55:45.115
and then tell them without any fear,
without any malice.

00:55:45.316 --> 00:55:47.735
You can talk to them and you should tell
them,

00:55:47.936 --> 00:55:50.371
“Now we are here to help you, for your
good.

00:55:50.572 --> 00:55:54.191
We have not come for our good but for your
good, now listen to us”.

00:55:54.392 --> 00:56:00.480
And I am sure, very sure, that the Kundalini
within you will be very happy.

00:56:00.681 --> 00:56:05.910
She is not happy you see, She is not happy
with people who are not using her fully.

00:56:06.111 --> 00:56:10.839
So She will be very happy to help you and
to do the needful

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:14.238
for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:56:14.373 --> 00:56:17.253
May God bless you.
