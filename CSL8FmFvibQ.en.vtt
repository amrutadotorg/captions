00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.530
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:25.680
I do not know how to thank the mayor of Oakland
and mayor of Berkeley for being so kind to

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.480
give this certificate to Me. I must say this
is a wonderful country where people recognize

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:50.690
something that is doing good work. Really
remarkable it is. I had been here before,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:00.370
to Berkeley, because everybody tells Me that
there are lots of seekers of truth in Berkeley.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.499
This is the thing that attracted Me very much.
But first of all we should know what are we

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:16.170
seeking all these days. Once you start seeking
it goes on like a rat-race of seeking. Or

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:26.100
have you been able to find something? So what
do you have to find in your seeking? As you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.060
know, in all the scriptures it is been told
that you have to know yourself. You don’t

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:45.499
know yourself, you don’t know what problems
you have within. People get into diseases

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:56.279
without knowing until it develops into a very
serious trouble. Also they go on hurting others,

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:05.119
being jealous with others, being in tension
and stress. All kind of problems come to them,

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.670
and they don’t know why it happens, why,
what is the reason?

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.170
So today I’m going to tell you how you have
to know yourself. First of all you must decide

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.200
that you have been seeking, seeking, seeking
and this is the place known for its seeking.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.770
It’s high time you better come to the end
of it and seek what you have been seeking

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:48.420
and you get it, that’s the promise. First
and foremost thing, when we are seeking we

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.760
should know what are we within ourselves.
What do we know about ourselves is only through

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.110
doctors, or through psychologists or some
people, which is very superficial knowledge

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.460
about ourselves. In our depth, in our within,
what do we have which doctors don’t know,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.710
is the para-sympathetic nervous system. They
don’t know. Sympathetic system is the system

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.490
by which when we work very hard, we run and
do all kinds of things, the sympathetic goes

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:34.880
into action, heart will start beating fast.
But what brings it to normal is the para-sympathetic

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.430
and this is what we have to know within ourselves,
that it exists and it operates automatically

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:51.990
How it exists and how works out that’s why
we have to know. Moreover what are we? When

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.680
you see the whole world, it is so full violence,
full of all kinds of nonsense that’s going

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.819
on, and you can’t imagine why people do
it. What is the need to do all these horrible

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.290
things in the name of God, in the name of
religion, in the name of some political party,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.139
or some sort of a name they must have to fight
with each other, torture others, kill each

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:32.340
other. All this works out through human beings,
through people who are supposed to be at the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:41.159
top of evolution. Human awareness is at the
highest point. So now what’s happening to

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:51.219
our awareness? Why do we get into jealousies,
into angers, into all kinds of funny type

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:59.710
of behavior, which animals also don’t do?
Because we have freedom, we can do what we

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:07.590
like, we can do what we like with ourselves
and with others. But still we must know our

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.639
vehicle better, we should know what is within
us.

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:22.849
Now for that, there is placed within us a
beautiful thing called Kundalini which lies

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.240
in the triangular bone, which is called as
“sacrum”. That means Greeks knew about

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.629
it, that’s why they called it a sacred bone.
In the triangular bone it lies at the base

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:44.659
of your spine and this is the one which is
going to give you a real ascent. This is the

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:52.340
one which is going to connect you to the All
Pervading Power of Divine Love. They have

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.169
all talked about God, Power of God, Divine
love, all kinds of things, but we don’t

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.569
know where it is, where does it exist, how
it works. If really it is there or not, also

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:15.150
we are not very sure. So this power lies within
your triangular bone, can you show them? All

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:43.139
of you have this power within you. It is not
anyone who belongs to any nationality, or

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:52.889
to any culture but everyone has this power
within himself. But you’ll be surprised,

00:06:52.889 --> 00:07:01.319
how people have made such a horrible picture
of Kundalini and they say that when the Kundalini

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:08.229
rises you may go mad, you may shout, you must
do all kinds of things. Because they have

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.270
no authority to do it, because they don’t
know how to do it – that’s why they make

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:19.469
up a story like that and tell you, because
they don’t want you to ascend, I think.

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:25.789
Or they don’t know, they are incapable of
awakening the Kundalini. But I must tell you

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:32.900
that She is your Mother, She is your individual
Mother, She knows everything about you. It

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:42.229
is all recorded, whatever was your past, whatever
mistakes you committed, whatever aspirations

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:50.210
you have, everything She knows about it, it’s
all recorded there in the 3-1/2 coils. But

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:57.430
She is your Mother, your own Mother and when
you were born, your Mother took all the trouble

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:04.159
upon Herself. She didn’t give you trouble.
In the same way when this Kundalini rises,

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:11.529
She doesn’t give you any trouble. Now people
are afraid even to talk about Kundalini because

00:08:11.529 --> 00:08:18.419
those who talked about Kundalini were I don’t
know what sort of people they were, and it

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:29.069
was such a misleading thing that they thought,
it’s better not to talk about it. But talk

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:31.770
is talk, talk is not everything.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:37.940
What has to happen is the awakening of this
Kundalini. It’s an actualization, it is

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:44.550
not just talking, giving lectures, you do
this, you stand like this, put your hand this

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:51.640
way, your legs that way, it’s not that.
It is very simple, that this Kundalini, which

00:08:51.640 --> 00:09:05.530
is responsible for your last ascent, your,
I should say, the last step in your evolution,

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:16.000
this Kundalini is your own Mother and She
cannot harm you. She can never do that. This

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.650
is the fact I would like to tell you first
of all. Because I know in America all kinds

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:29.780
of people have come from India, those people
also they were released from jail, wore some

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:34.650
sort of a dress and came here. They are all
minting money, that’s what they are doing,

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:42.830
they are good at it. So if you have any understanding
about Divinity you must understand that you

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:52.530
cannot sell it and you cannot purchase it.
If you can purchase some person then such

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:59.300
a person cannot be your master, he can be
your servant but not your master. So once

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:08.200
you understand this point, it is very important
for you people to know that it is not saleable

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.970
because you know this is a consumer society,
and everything has to be sold. But not spirituality,

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:22.830
you cannot sell spirituality. And those who
sell spirituality are spurious people, they

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:29.700
are not real, they are absolutely bogus people
as they call them, and you don’t waste your

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.630
energy and money on them.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:42.880
So now, we have before you this triangular
bone and this Kundalini and She rises through

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:51.890
six centers. The seventh center is below the
Kundalini, it is below the Kundalini and it

00:10:51.890 --> 00:11:01.890
protects the chastity of the Mother. Now those
people who talk about sex as one of the instruments

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:11.670
for ascent are absolutely befooling you. Nobody
has said that in any scripture, but suddenly

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:20.260
they started a kind of a myth or fashion I
should say or fad, and people get drawn into

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:27.490
it. So I have come to warn you about it, that
it has nothing to do with sex, but as Christ

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:34.780
has said you have to be like children when
you enter into the Kingdom of God. So your

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.280
innocence gets awakened. Many people feel
they have lost their innocence, you can never

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:48.110
lose it. It comes back to you. It is dormant,
it might be bruised, it might be a little

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:52.260
bit hurt, but it’s all there intact, and
you will be amazed to see what you are.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.060
Because you don’t know what you are. So
I would say you are not this body, this mind,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:11.860
but
you are the Spirit and that’s what you have
to become. Once you become the Spirit, you

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:17.770
will know what you are, you’ll know everything
about yourself. But for that to happen you

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:23.970
don’t have to do any acrobatic thing, it’s
just very simple. Wherever you are sitting

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:30.590
it will work out. But first tell your mind
to stop little bit thinking, because this

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:37.750
mind has been reacting all the time, reacting
to this, reacting to that, reacting with the

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:47.250
result that Kundalini doesn’t rise, but
when She rises, She’s wonderful. The thoughts

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:52.450
rise like that and fall down, again thoughts
come up and fall down. They come from the

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:59.250
future or from the past. Present you cannot
be, you cannot be in the present. But when

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:05.800
Kundalini rises, She elongates these thoughts
and there is a space created. It’s called

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.650
as pause, you can call it. In Sanskrit, it
is called as vilamba. So your mind stands

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:20.560
at that place where you have thoughtless awareness.
Is told by, also Jung has talked about it,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:29.190
that you get into thoughtless awareness. Pantanjali
has talked about it. But talking about it

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.110
is not sufficient as I told you, it has to
happen.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.770
So first thing that happens to you, you become
thoughtlessly aware. There is no thought,

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:46.640
no reaction. For example, I see this beautiful
carpet here, and if I react I would say oh,

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:53.890
what a beautiful carpet. If it is Mine, I
would be worried I should insure it. If it

00:13:53.890 --> 00:14:00.470
is not mine, I would say that how much they
must have paid for it and, to whom does it

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:06.620
belong? And all kinds of things. But supposing
I’m in thoughtless awareness, then I just

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:15.910
see it. While seeing it also I’m just witnessing,
and what I’m getting is the complete joy

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:25.590
of the creator who has done this job, complete
get filled with that joy. There is no reaction,

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:32.310
it is just thoughtless awareness in which
Divine works. You don’t have to then think

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:42.760
about it, it all works out. Now this Kundalini
rising through six centers – now you don’t

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:51.130
know you have any centers within yourself,
and you don’t know how they are placed.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:58.960
After this rising, this Kundalini rises, passes
through the fontanel bone area and becomes

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:06.230
one with the All Pervading Power of Divine
Love, which is very subtle and you also start

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:13.970
becoming your subtler personality. When the
Kundalini rises through these six centers

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:21.740
which are responsible for your physical, mental
and emotional being, She nourishes them. She

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:32.810
nourishes them with light, and then She integrates
them. And when She reaches this spot, She

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:41.790
opens up this fontanel bone area and becomes
one with this All Pervading Power. This is

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:48.460
the actualization of baptism, this is the
baptism. It is not just some priest comes,

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:56.560
puts his hand on your head, it’s not the
way. It has to be the actualization of this

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:04.279
happening, which is for your ascent. This
is the last break-through of your evolution.

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:14.700
Whatever I’m saying we can prove it also,
it’s not just talking. But this Kundalini,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:28.450
Kundalini’s awakening which takes places,
it actually makes your hands speak. You start

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:37.980
feeling the cool breeze coming out of your
fingers and through your hands and here also.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:46.180
You feel the cool breeze, actually and then
if you know what do these mean 5, 6, and 7

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:54.730
center, in the same way, 5, 6 and 7 center,
these seven centers are on the sympathetic

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:04.240
nervous system. But when the sympathetic centers,
two of them they mix, the central system is

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:17.620
formed of para-sympathetic. So when you get
enlightenment your Spirit gets awakened in

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:30.770
your heart, and in the Spirit is the reflection
of the complete Divine force. Then you become

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:39.850
a, really, a spiritual personality. It is
a reality I’m talking about, and in the

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:51.220
light of the Spirit your attention becomes
purified. Not only that, but you know what

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:59.130
is good for you and what is destructive for
you. You give up all nonsense in no time.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:04.950
Of course Sahaja Yoga has cured many people
with all kinds of addictions, all kinds of

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:12.250
problems, it’s a fact. But that is this
Kundalini has done it, which is your own,

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:22.980
which has enlightened your own chakras, your
own centers and has brought forth this result.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:30.010
The second thing that happens to you apart
from your attention being enlightened, that

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:37.100
you become a collective personality. People
have talked about it, said about it but this

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:46.460
is in the books. Like a drop falls into the
ocean, becomes the ocean. It doesn’t mean

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:54.680
that you are lost, you are nowhere. But your
ego is lost, your so called pretensions are

00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:02.920
lost and what you become is part and parcel
of the whole. Whole global race belongs to

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:09.490
you, then how will you fight each other? If
you are part and parcel of the whole, nothing

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:18.350
but love, nothing but compassion. We have
now people in 86 countries, and when I see

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:25.400
them, I see the dream fulfilled because I’ve
never seen them fighting or saying anything

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:33.280
harsh to each other. They come from all kinds
of religions, they come from all kinds of

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:40.470
countries, every type of knowledge they have.
Because you get the absolute knowledge, absolute

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:48.190
knowledge. Now we don’t know what absolute
knowledge is. For example there is a person

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:55.340
comes say from India or from any other country,
and says “I’m a real great saint, I’ll

00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:01.680
give you a great experience”. How will you
know that person is not telling you lies,

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:07.890
and that he is not coming from the prison?
How will you find out? You just put your hands

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.890
when you are realized, when you are enlightened,
towards that person. Immediately what you

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:21.440
will get? Will be a hot breeze, that’s the
minimum. You might get tingling very bad,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.280
perhaps maybe you might even get a blister,
one or two.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:31.840
So you will be amazed how you judge people
on your finger-tips – absolute knowledge

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:39.500
about people, absolute knowledge about Spirit,
absolute knowledge about the whole global

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:47.380
problem you get. You become collectively conscious,
you can connect yourself to the whole world

00:20:47.380 --> 00:21:00.470
in a way that is spiritual. Whatever you want,
whatever you think becomes very pure, compassionate

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:08.410
and beautiful. That is what you are, that
whatever you are that you become. There’s

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:17.110
nothing to be said. Like this now, this instrument
is before Me, I’m speaking to you, but supposing

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:24.870
it is not connected how can it, what is the
use of this instrument? In the same way you

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:34.440
do not have that spirituality within you.
Sometimes people must think that we are very

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:42.150
spiritual. Don’t believe in that. You must
have absolute knowledge about yourself and

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:46.860
about everything else.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:54.670
Also we can say lots of things have happened
in Sahaja Yoga. Like I know of somebody who

00:21:54.670 --> 00:22:03.960
was just a Chartered Accountant, knew only
about finances. He’s become a great poet.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:19.179
All kind of balances work out, and it is so
surprising the amount of aptitudes that you

00:22:19.179 --> 00:22:26.270
develop. You are amazed, you never knew you
had these aptitudes within you. I have an

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:35.980
Academy of Music in India, and the people
even from America and other countries came

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:42.580
and three months, only in three months they
started singing a very difficult raga called

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:48.260
as [unclear word, Malcos]. I was amazed. For
which people have to work at least 5 to 7

00:22:48.260 --> 00:23:01.150
years, and here they are. So your capacity
to absorb knowledge, to render it, is so much

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:06.790
increased because you don’t know your potential.
You don’t know what you are, that’s what

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:13.179
the point is. That’s why they said that
know yourself, know thyself because after

00:23:13.179 --> 00:23:21.730
knowing yourself, you’ll have absolute knowledge,
absolute reality and you won’t live in the

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:26.610
mental world “oh this is this, this is that”.
I know many books have written like that,

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:32.940
about a person who was seeking and they ended
up into nothing. Your seeking should not end

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:38.210
up like that. You should get what you are
seeking.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:44.620
You have been seeking, and seeking and seeking
and it is My greatest desire that you the

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:49.299
well known seekers all over the world, because
they say Berkeley University has the maximum

00:23:49.299 --> 00:24:03.010
number of seekers. So I mean I don’t know,
you should come to the end of it. There are

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:09.309
many I know who came to Berkeley because they
thought they were a group of people who are

00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:14.490
seeking. They went to meetings after meetings.
When they got their realization they wrote

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:21.670
to them that we have found, we have found
the reality. So they wrote back all their

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:27.600
friends and groups “oh I see, that we see
that you have found it your own way, we’ll

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:37.540
find our it own way”. So he was so, this
gentleman who came, he was so disappointed,

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:44.179
that still they are seeking. Seeking has become
like a fashion. It cannot. It must come to

00:24:44.179 --> 00:24:52.100
an end. Your journey must come to an end,
otherwise it will go on, one after another.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:58.670
So many will come and tell you “this is
it, this is it, this is it”, but the experience

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:05.910
of the spirit, experience of realization is
the thing you should ask for. If somebody

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:11.690
doesn’t give you the experience, don’t
be satisfied with what they say. Even with

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.380
Me.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:21.309
I’m sure tonight all of you all of you will
have that experience, if you are truly seeking,

00:25:21.309 --> 00:25:28.580
and there are a few things which I would like
to tell you. Would you like to ask Me some

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:43.280
questions? One by one. Yes Madam?

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:54.340
[Audience]: How does it play into politics?
Shri Mataji: Oh very great. Politics is, see

00:25:54.340 --> 00:26:03.940
why the trouble with politics is, because
it is not pure politics. If the politicians

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:14.530
become, think of that, if they all become
realized souls, we’ll have benevolent people.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:19.950
They will be very different. We have some
politicians in India who got their realization,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:29.440
also we have in Benin and Ivory Coast, we
have people who are realized souls and also

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:38.970
politicians. Without realization if you are
a politician, God save the people. But you

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:50.270
will understand the politics of the collective.
You will see what’s wrong where, what you

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:57.290
have to correct, what you have to do, how
you have to behave. You won’t run after

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:03.450
[unclear – bootie?], no, your life itself
will work it out. I’ll tell you, My father

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:09.770
himself, he was a realized soul and he was
a member of the Central Assembly Constituent

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:17.549
Assembly and Parliament. But he was a realized
soul. So he came out of jail and there was

00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:24.309
the [unclear name of person] who was there
one of the great politicians, and a great

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:30.120
man, who was with [unclear name of person].
He wrote a letter to my father that I want

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:37.860
you to stand for election, so My father told
him I am just not come from jail and I’m

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:47.040
not very well but if you want, I don’t mind
contesting the election. So at that time he

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:54.210
sent 3,000 rupees to My father, saying that
this you can use for your propagation and

00:27:54.210 --> 00:28:01.950
all. So My father sent it back saying, Sir
if I’m to spend money for my election I

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:11.380
better not contest it. And without spending
a single pi he contested the election and

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:18.750
the person who was opposing him lost, forfeited
his deposit. But his daughter, she was My

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:26.470
friend, she helped My father. She told her
father you are nowhere compared to Her father

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:34.240
and I’m not going to support you in any
way. That’s how it comes. See everything

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:45.100
works out so well, but we must have many people
in this to understand. If there is only one

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.470
or two people, they will torture them, they’ll
trouble them, do all kinds of, all saints

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:55.809
have suffered. But now we have to be, all
of us we can be saints, and we have to be

00:28:55.809 --> 00:29:13.370
saints and we’ll have saints who will be
politicians. The whole world will change.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:25.950
Any other question?

00:29:25.950 --> 00:30:06.080
[Audience]: My dear Shri Mataji, I was very
recently became aware of You and actually

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:15.070
through Your web site, and when I first saw
Your face before reading anything about You

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:21.030
I said “I’m seeing the Divine Mother”,
and I was so amazed by Your aura, by Your

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:43.940
energy that it inspired me to write something
for You and if it will please You

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.640
I would be very honored to sing it to You.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:31:01.140
Moderator confirms: Recently she became aware
of You and saw You on the Internet web site

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:08.090
and when she saw Your face…..

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:19.049
Audience: I have a special presentation I
want to …..

00:31:19.049 --> 00:31:30.710
Moderator: …..she has a poetry she has written
for You.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:40.340
Shri Mataji: You are a very sensitive person,
I must say.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:52.010
Audience: Actually I would like to sing it
to you.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:32:34.510
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much.
May God Bless you. Beautiful. Beautiful. It

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:49.500
is very touching. So lastly, ha, yes Sir?

00:32:49.500 --> 00:33:00.110
Audience: unclear question about Anahata

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:09.840
Shri Mataji: that is what I am going to tell
you, alright? I’m happy you people have

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:24.390
been reading quite a lot. We have three nadis
here, you can see it clearly. One is Ida,

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:38.200
another Pingala & Sushumna is the center.
Ida and Pingala are responsible for the sympathetic

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:52.169
nervous system, and the centre one, Sushumna
is for your ascent, for the para-sympathetic

00:33:52.169 --> 00:34:06.410
nervous system. Now the center one is the
one is the Anahata nadi. This goes up to the

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:14.050
fontanel bone area, and when the Kundalini
reaches there, She makes the same sound as

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:20.790
in the heart we have, we call it Anahata.
Anahata means without percussion. That is

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:35.340
Kabira has said, that at the Anahata sound,
when it reaches the Sahasrara, in this part

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:41.609
this limbic area, then you know that you are
about to enter into the Kingdom of God. You

00:34:41.609 --> 00:34:49.710
see Indian poets, some of them were such great
saints, but they wrote mostly in this poetry

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:55.710
and it was not so much understood by people.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:02.859
Like Kabira wrote, he has used Anahata very
much word that [Sanskrit word, unclear] he

00:35:02.859 --> 00:35:17.010
means the, it
can mean in the normal way is my lover went
away and I did not fight with him. Now how

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:24.910
can Kabira have these ideas? But some people
did feel that it is that. But I told him,

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:34.490
told them that see Sayiam means the life,
he’s talking about his death, that my life

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:41.460
went away, I never fought with it. And now
you follow it that way, and they were amazed,

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.570
when I told them this meaning. They said we
never knew this was the meaning, we studied

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:52.369
Hindi language, we studied him. I said, you
see the trouble is, these poets were sitting

00:35:52.369 --> 00:36:01.630
there and writing something of that level,
how can it enter the minds of human beings?

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:07.790
That was the fact and in the same way anything
you see you read now, it will be very, very

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:13.510
clear for you to understand, if it is the
right reading of course. And then you will

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:23.869
know what everything means. All these words
have great meaning and they are indicating.

00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:30.369
Despite that, we can see that people have
always misunderstood. They have misunderstood

00:36:30.369 --> 00:36:38.359
everything, in every scripture, every saint.
Everything they have misunderstood, maybe

00:36:38.359 --> 00:36:44.920
because I shouldn’t say they didn’t have
brains, that they were brainless. But that

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:51.980
they had an angle to their brains and they
saw everything with that angle and that’s

00:36:51.980 --> 00:37:12.109
why it was not a proper understanding. Anything
else?

00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:27.170
[Moderator]: confirms audience statement:
I just wanted to thank you for the gift you

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:33.960
have given to the world and he came to Your
program in Vancouver 10 years ago and has

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.260
not been in touch since then.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:41.869
Shri Mataji: Oh I’m again going to Vancouver.
See I’ve been traveling too much, I’m

00:37:41.869 --> 00:37:47.710
now 77 will be 78 years of age, and somehow
my family people think that I shouldn’t

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:57.280
travel so much, but this time I sneaked through.
You should come, you should come, to our programs

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:06.010
in New York. We have a very nice program now,
very nice program. What’s the date? 16th

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:13.740
of June. We are having a very, very nice program.
You are all welcome there in New York. We

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:21.869
have a big land there, and you’ll enjoy
it very much. It is for your enjoyment, that

00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:31.690
you get joy. Joy is not double like happiness/unhappiness.
It’s pure, it’s singular and you get the

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:41.540
joy from the spirit, and you get the peace,
complete peace. Just image human beings getting

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:48.980
transformed like that, what will happen to
this world? Maybe from Berkeley we might get

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:56.320
a great force of this world to be changing
it, because so many students come here from

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:04.250
all over the world and if it works out, you
can change the whole world. That is the importance

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:11.400
of Berkeley message.

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:33.520
Alright, we’ll have the session for realization.
But I would definitely request people who

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:43.970
don’t want to have their realization to
leave the hall, because they create a little

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:50.119
problem. So it would be very kind of you to
leave the hall if you don’t want to have

00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:57.700
realization. Of course nothing goes wrong
with you, nothing will happen to you I assure

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:05.820
you, you won’t be jumping, nothing of the
kind. It is a very soothing effect. First

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:15.140
of all, you’ll get your realization and
then I hope they have here a follow-up for

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:22.680
which you have to go, not to pay anything,
again I tell you. And you can learn everything

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:31.770
there about yourself, about others, for which
you don’t have to spend more than a month.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:38.760
Within 1 month you will be the masters, I
know you will be. But whatever seeking you

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:50.140
have had so far, forget about it, forget completely
about it and just try to know your own value.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:58.250
Know that you are very precious, very precious
persons, and these precious people should

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:11.200
not get disturbed or destroyed by wrong type of people.
