00:25.590 --> 00:28.312
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella (Italy), 30 August 1992.

00:29.080 --> 00:35.160
Last time you had asked Me for Gurupada,

00:36.160 --> 00:44.217
and you should know that the essence of Guru

00:44.520 --> 00:48.000
is Shri Ganesha, the innocence.

00:49.720 --> 00:55.280
You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife,

00:55.400 --> 00:59.600
faithful wife, of a sati.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.040
Her name was Anasuya,

01:04.400 --> 01:10.440
and she was so religious

01:11.360 --> 01:14.200
and so dedicated

01:14.480 --> 01:18.760
that they say that the wives of all the gods,

01:19.000 --> 01:25.600
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, got very jealous of her.

01:26.527 --> 01:32.567
So they told their husbands that "You must go and test her,

01:32.840 --> 01:38.880
if she's really a woman with chastity or not."

01:39.440 --> 01:43.120
So all of them came down as sadhus,

01:43.320 --> 01:47.080
dressed up like sanyasis.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.920
And she said she wanted to serve them,

01:53.200 --> 01:55.920
give them something. They said, "No, we want to have food."

01:56.160 --> 01:59.320
She said, "All right, come and sit down."

01:59.600 --> 02:02.800
She cooked food for them.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.760
So they said, "No, we will not have the food

02:05.920 --> 02:09.320
unless and until you take out all your clothes.

02:09.680 --> 02:13.720
We'll only have the food if you take out all your clothes."

02:14.360 --> 02:17.120
She said, "Is it so?" She said, "Yes."

02:17.400 --> 02:21.760
So she made them into little, little children, three little children,

02:22.600 --> 02:25.040
and then she became nude,

02:25.360 --> 02:29.080
because innocent doesn't understand anything about it.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.480
And then she joined them together,

02:32.800 --> 02:36.920
their three innocences were joined together

02:39.440 --> 02:46.000
and they got their Gurupada.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.000
That's how the Adi Guru was created.

02:51.840 --> 02:57.280
So the first thing is that if you want your Gurupad,

02:57.480 --> 03:00.120
you have to be innocent.

03:00.520 --> 03:05.440
"Innocent" is a very vague term, very vague,

03:07.880 --> 03:13.320
and difficult to really understand what is innocent.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.000
But what is the nature of innocence?

03:17.320 --> 03:22.760
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

03:23.120 --> 03:23.800
First of all

03:24.040 --> 03:31.040
He's endowed with wisdom,

03:34.320 --> 03:37.880
and He puts wisdom into us.

03:38.920 --> 03:45.920
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

03:46.920 --> 03:53.400
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

03:53.840 --> 04:00.520
It is He who puts genetics in us.

04:02.480 --> 04:08.480
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

04:09.480 --> 04:12.600
and when He puts wisdom in us,

04:12.880 --> 04:17.440
then we are wise.

04:18.680 --> 04:24.000
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

04:25.160 --> 04:28.920
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.720
They have no wisdom.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.400
They do things without wisdom.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.920
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.560
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,

04:43.760 --> 04:46.000
whatever it is - you may brand yourself with anything;

04:46.200 --> 04:48.480
but you can see from their behavior they're,

04:48.720 --> 04:52.400
that they have no wisdom at all.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.720
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.760
In some people who are not yet evolved,

05:02.920 --> 05:05.800
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

05:06.160 --> 05:09.400
this wisdom is lacking.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.560
Apart from that,

05:12.880 --> 05:19.160
this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

05:21.280 --> 05:27.560
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

05:28.520 --> 05:31.760
all kinds of bad habits.

05:32.280 --> 05:36.200
We don't like to look at nudity.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.720
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

05:44.520 --> 05:50.000
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

05:50.880 --> 05:57.480
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

05:58.200 --> 06:03.840
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

06:04.200 --> 06:09.000
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.760
We are automatically dharmic.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.920
We don't kill others,

06:15.200 --> 06:17.040
we don't aggress others,

06:17.360 --> 06:19.320
we don't torture others.

06:19.600 --> 06:24.800
We do not occupy anybody else's land or house

06:25.000 --> 06:28.640
or take away anything,

06:29.640 --> 06:33.080
another's property or another's things.

06:33.480 --> 06:38.480
This wisdom comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.760
In short, He makes you absolutely ready for Self-Realization.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.120
It is He only ultimately

06:50.440 --> 06:52.200
who looks after us

06:52.440 --> 06:57.120
at the time of our nirvana, at the time of our realization,

06:57.760 --> 07:00.600
because

07:00.880 --> 07:05.800
He stops all other activities of excretion

07:06.280 --> 07:13.200
when you are ascending into new realm.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.400
You have seen, I'm sitting here for nine hours, ten hours.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.240
Once I sat down for eighteen hours together,

07:21.440 --> 07:24.920
didn't go at all, even to bathroom.

07:25.400 --> 07:30.560
Because it is He who stops all these activities -

07:30.840 --> 07:34.680
even when kundalini is rising, it stops.

07:35.640 --> 07:39.160
So this wisdom is innate,

07:39.600 --> 07:43.560
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

07:43.760 --> 07:48.280
He becomes, manifesting in us -

07:48.480 --> 07:53.080
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.800
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

07:58.040 --> 08:02.080
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.000
You become the child,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.800
at that time you become a child.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.040
And with the kundalini rising,

08:10.240 --> 08:13.760
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

08:14.440 --> 08:17.009
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

08:17.184 --> 08:20.240
He's the power in the kundalini.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.280
He gives wisdom in the brain.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.640
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

08:29.160 --> 08:33.240
all your attachments which are wrong,

08:33.520 --> 08:39.240
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.760
He changes, your genetics are changed.

08:43.040 --> 08:46.680
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

08:46.920 --> 08:49.240
about the same I would say,

08:49.600 --> 08:55.680
and the genetics of other people would be different.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.880
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

08:59.200 --> 09:02.200
because Indians normally are very wise people.

09:02.384 --> 09:04.952
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

09:05.073 --> 09:08.160
the superiority of races from wisdom point of view,

09:08.360 --> 09:09.840
Indians are very wise.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.560
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.040
Even the children I have seen, children from the West

09:17.320 --> 09:19.680
when they go to India: they went for this school,

09:19.801 --> 09:22.678
they are doing all kinds of destructive things to themselves --

09:22.799 --> 09:24.479
nobody could understand.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.280
Once they jumped into a dirty pond.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.920
They got malaria.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.200
Then they ran out of the house, of the school

09:33.520 --> 09:38.240
and came out and went to the roads, went to the shops.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.120
So they put a gate.

09:40.360 --> 09:43.280
When they put the gate the newspaper is criticizing us,

09:43.560 --> 09:46.480
there's no sense in it, every school has a gate.

09:46.920 --> 09:53.040
So these all unwise, stupid things they do because they lack wisdom.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.800
A child who has wisdom is extremely cautious,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.080
he understands the importance of his life.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.200
He respects his parents, he respects everything

10:01.560 --> 10:04.920
- automatically, you don't have to tell them.

10:05.280 --> 10:10.800
Automatically they know what is dharma is, you don't have to tell them.

10:11.280 --> 10:17.560
That wisdom, this great deity of Ganesha,

10:18.080 --> 10:21.360
He took His form as Jesus Christ.

10:21.760 --> 10:28.800
And you all accepted Him as the Lord, which is true also.

10:30.080 --> 10:35.000
But because your Ganesh Principle was not

10:35.320 --> 10:38.640
so much developed in these Western countries,

10:38.920 --> 10:42.320
people took to stupid things.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.840
This pornography and this kind of a interest in nude women shows

10:48.040 --> 10:52.360
that there is no wisdom in them, there is no Ganesha in them.

10:52.481 --> 10:55.800
Though they follow Christ, it's just a lipservice going to the church.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.752
I don't know if the church also has any Ganesha in them,

10:58.873 --> 11:00.600
they have no Ganesha.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.040
The way they lead their life, nobody can say

11:03.240 --> 11:06.480
they have any sense of holiness and auspiciousness.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.920
As soon as you get wisdom, you understand holiness and auspiciousness.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.560
Before that you just call "holy father",

11:13.760 --> 11:15.880
and holy father is doing all kinds of things

11:16.080 --> 11:20.360
which can create holes in the organization;

11:21.000 --> 11:26.240
who takes money, bribes, creates bombs, have women,

11:26.440 --> 11:31.040
I mean everything -- how can he be holy?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.600
So this wisdom part is so important,

11:35.800 --> 11:37.990
and that's what we should ask

11:38.111 --> 11:40.360
Ganesha, to make us like children.

11:40.560 --> 11:46.120
Children have basically wisdom, but not all the children.

11:46.320 --> 11:47.480
This is the thing is,

11:47.720 --> 11:51.600
that children in which Shri Ganesha has activated,

11:51.880 --> 11:56.640
has put this genetic of wisdom, it is there.

11:58.440 --> 12:02.160
This is one of the greatest things we have to think about:

12:02.360 --> 12:07.440
is it wise, it is sane? It's not to be logically -

12:07.640 --> 12:10.640
logically if you believe in something then you can go wrong,

12:10.840 --> 12:13.479
because there's no strength from within.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.119
But innately if it becomes that, you won't do it at any cost.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.039
Now you know yourself,

12:19.160 --> 12:21.559
all the Sahaja yogis are so different:

12:21.680 --> 12:23.840
they behave differently, they stand differently,

12:24.040 --> 12:26.674
they talk differently, they think differently, they

12:26.795 --> 12:28.280
- everything is different.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.160
Suddenly he has become, they have become like that.

12:33.040 --> 12:37.200
And you can't understand, how is it we have become like this?

12:38.120 --> 12:40.640
They were drinking, they were smoking, drug-taking,

12:40.840 --> 12:42.000
everything they did.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.880
But how is it suddenly you changed?

12:45.080 --> 12:50.000
Because Shri Ganesha has put this wisdom in you.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.640
Now if you see His character, it's very interesting to watch.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.680
He's a child, and He's entirely dedicated to His Mother.

13:00.920 --> 13:06.480
He doesn't know any other god, anything else -- complete dedication.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.440
But is it so with us?

13:09.640 --> 13:14.240
There also sometimes I find some of the Sahaja Yogis are lacking.

13:14.840 --> 13:19.280
They lack sincerity, loyalties.

13:19.520 --> 13:22.800
And I'm shocked sometimes at the periphery they are like that;

13:23.040 --> 13:26.480
that means they have to ascend still.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.240
People who have worked with Me,

13:29.440 --> 13:31.880
I have always tried to pay them sufficiently.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.680
There's no need to pay,

13:33.880 --> 13:37.000
because after all I have done so much for your building,

13:37.280 --> 13:39.000
your body, why should I pay you?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.920
But I always pay sumptuously,

13:41.160 --> 13:42.800
I look after them, give them ...

13:43.000 --> 13:46.920
My, My loyalties to you and love cannot be challenged.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.800
But I find them, them being very selfish sometimes,

13:51.040 --> 13:52.360
extremely selfish.

13:52.560 --> 13:56.480
They'll do half the work and run away, sometimes they are ....

13:56.720 --> 14:01.400
their problems, their own problems are much more important.

14:02.040 --> 14:07.280
Or they just try to find some excuse.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.760
So many Sahaja Yogis are also like that.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.600
They are not sincere.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.280
Sahaja Yoga has given them so much.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.920
We have to always find out, are we sincere to Sahaja Yoga?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.680
What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?

14:21.920 --> 14:25.160
What have we achieved and what are we doing?

14:25.440 --> 14:28.920
On the contrary, they become liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.640
Ganesha is never a liability on His Mother.

14:39.640 --> 14:45.200
For example, someone becomes sick.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.920
All right, Sahaja Yoga can help you -

14:49.120 --> 14:52.760
may be, may not be; may be cured, may not be cured.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.920
If they are not cured then they will say that "See now,

14:56.120 --> 14:59.080
I was not cured. I'm going to leave Sahaja Yoga."

14:59.280 --> 15:02.800
Then one has to say, "Please leave."

15:03.640 --> 15:07.080
With the slightest thing they go off, not understanding

15:07.320 --> 15:10.760
what is important.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.200
Then they are liabilities, like somebody gets married,

15:15.440 --> 15:17.800
comes here, "I don't like this wife." Now do what you like,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.160
the wife sits on My head, and the husband also.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.680
All kinds of liabilities come in,

15:24.920 --> 15:28.440
"My husband doesn't do Sahaja Yoga, what should I do?"

15:28.680 --> 15:31.400
You solve the problem with your husband.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.680
You solve the problem with your children.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.600
You have the power to do it; have patience, work it out.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.920
They'll put us into cases, this, that.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.600
It is only Sahaja Yogis who can harm Sahaja Yoga,

15:43.800 --> 15:44.920
can you believe that?

15:45.120 --> 15:47.080
Nobody else can touch it.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.560
Unless and until a Sahaja Yogi misbehaves,

15:49.760 --> 15:52.080
nobody can touch Sahaja Yoga.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.400
So we have many cases like that.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.160
I mean, they have seen My photographs,

15:56.360 --> 15:58.120
they have seen miraculous photographs,

15:58.320 --> 16:01.560
they have had realization, everything happened to them,

16:01.760 --> 16:04.320
they have been so many times helped.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.880
But suddenly they say, "I want to leave Sahaja Yoga."

16:08.080 --> 16:09.600
"Very good," I say,

16:09.800 --> 16:13.320
"those who have to leave should leave immediately."

16:13.520 --> 16:18.480
As it is there's very little space left in the Heaven,

16:19.800 --> 16:23.280
and no place for such half-hearted people.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.680
If they have to leave, they should leave.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.920
You have to have Ganesha as your ideal.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.787
It should not be that "I worship Ganesha."

16:33.001 --> 16:34.958
That way you were worshipping Christ,

16:35.079 --> 16:37.079
you were worshipping this, worshipping that.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.560
But what has come inside you, is the point.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.480
Have you got Shri Ganesha within you?

16:45.000 --> 16:50.560
Are you following Shri Ganesha with the same devotion, dedication?

16:50.920 --> 16:55.920
If you ... But you are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

16:56.440 --> 17:01.240
Shri Ganesha was made with immaculate conception.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.120
You are also made the same way.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.360
Your kundalini was raised, was given you the realization

17:09.560 --> 17:12.880
and you got your second birth, and now you are Sahaja yogis.

17:13.080 --> 17:16.480
All these things have happened to you

17:16.680 --> 17:20.800
without having a father.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.560
If I had not told you that you have a Father,

17:25.760 --> 17:28.920
you would never have known.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.720
Like, other gurus, you see,

17:32.920 --> 17:37.000
they don't want to give credit to anyone.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.920
So this actually has happened with you,

17:40.120 --> 17:45.159
you are being made in the same manner as Shri Ganesh.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.879
Of course you must be having something, you know,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.560
otherwise I could not have made -- that's also true.

17:50.840 --> 17:56.120
Supposing the kundalini was missing, now what could I have done?

17:56.800 --> 18:01.120
If not missing, if it was absolutely crooked;

18:01.400 --> 18:02.280
if not crooked,

18:02.480 --> 18:06.520
supposing there were some chakras which were horribly damaged.

18:06.760 --> 18:13.200
So, you were also people just ready to have your realization,

18:13.560 --> 18:15.480
that you were seeking it truly,

18:15.800 --> 18:21.720
that you had the pure desire to become Sahaja Yogis, no doubt.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.520
Still, when the growth is taking place,

18:25.840 --> 18:27.720
you must watch,

18:27.920 --> 18:32.520
you must see how much sincerity we are giving,

18:32.760 --> 18:38.720
with what dedication we are working out?

18:39.080 --> 18:41.600
Now, we have people

18:41.920 --> 18:45.400
who must have gone for postering somewhere, some places

18:45.720 --> 18:47.400
- not now, it's long time back -

18:47.640 --> 18:51.160
so they charged Me for their coffee also.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.560
I said, "All right." Thank God they were not smoking,

18:54.760 --> 18:58.520
otherwise they would have charged Me!

19:01.440 --> 19:05.600
So from that level, now we are very much changed,

19:06.040 --> 19:08.600
and some of them have become perfect Sahaja Yogis.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.080
But still we have people on the periphery,

19:12.400 --> 19:14.640
and they get nervous at the smallest thing.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.400
Yesterday there was a storm - has to be a storm.

19:18.680 --> 19:19.320
You don't know,

19:19.520 --> 19:25.280
when Christ was carrying His disciples there was a very big storm,

19:25.920 --> 19:27.720
and then He stopped it.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.240
Yesterday when you started singing the songs,

19:30.440 --> 19:32.160
then only the storm stopped,

19:32.480 --> 19:36.080
just to prove that these songs have such power.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.999
If such things don't happen,

19:38.120 --> 19:41.048
how will you know that these songs have the power?

19:41.169 --> 19:44.245
You think you are just singing just because you are singing.

19:44.366 --> 19:46.697
No, it has a power, these are mantras, these are

19:46.818 --> 19:49.149
all awakened songs.

19:49.270 --> 19:52.800
And then it stopped.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.200
They were saying, "Should we say mantras?" I said,

19:56.400 --> 19:58.879
"No, nothing." I didn't say things, what you have to do.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.600
Suddenly they thought of singing,

20:01.800 --> 20:03.720
and then it worked out.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.640
Because every time if I have to suggest,

20:06.840 --> 20:10.280
then when will you use your power?

20:10.560 --> 20:12.120
All such incidents take place,

20:12.320 --> 20:14.640
now it was Shri Ganesha's special trick.

20:14.761 --> 20:16.262
He's the real judge for you.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.000
You must know because you have seen in Sistine Chapel,

20:19.160 --> 20:22.800
He is standing there and moving you left and right.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.880
So there is a testing point also.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.120
In Sahaja Yoga the door is open, this way.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.800
But there's a bigger door on the back side

20:32.040 --> 20:34.880
to throw out people.

20:39.680 --> 20:43.880
And the judgment is not done by Me so much as by this Ganesha.

20:44.120 --> 20:48.360
He judges you, and then you are thrown out.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.520
Then to come back is very difficult.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.520
Even if you come back you are suspicious of yourself,

20:55.760 --> 20:58.000
and others are also suspicious of you.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.600
So you see, what you have to understand

21:01.800 --> 21:04.360
is that this is a judgment point.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.280
Introspect yourself, find out,

21:07.520 --> 21:11.920
"Am I wise? If I'm doing this, am I doing wise things?

21:12.280 --> 21:14.680
Is it wise for me to do?

21:15.000 --> 21:18.640
Is it all right for me as a Sahaja Yogi to do it?

21:18.920 --> 21:20.320
Should I do it or not?"

21:20.600 --> 21:22.480
At every point you should see.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.360
I mean, you know that I don't want any money,

21:25.481 --> 21:28.038
and I don't want any presents -- I've said hundred times,

21:28.159 --> 21:29.279
but they won't listen.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.273
Now they are saying that

21:30.394 --> 21:32.747
"Mother if you stop giving us present, we'll stop."

21:32.868 --> 21:35.679
I said, "You stop first, then I'll stop."

21:35.800 --> 21:37.920
But despite all this quarrel and fight,

21:38.041 --> 21:39.556
there's one thing definitely:

21:39.677 --> 21:43.437
there's love, and you want to express it.

21:43.640 --> 21:47.640
But love here is not attached;

21:47.880 --> 21:54.160
it's detached love, where it flows to its greatest extent,

21:54.520 --> 21:58.160
takes all the responsibility.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.000
There is people, there are people

22:02.200 --> 22:04.520
who go on criticizing other Sahaja Yogis

22:04.760 --> 22:06.440
-- I have seen it, it's very common.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.440
That's a sign of a very low type of a Sahaja Yogi,

22:09.760 --> 22:12.000
because he doesn't see what's wrong with him.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.160
He's trying to criticize others,

22:14.480 --> 22:17.920
does he see what is wrong with him?

22:18.240 --> 22:21.760
There are other kinds of Sahaja Yogis

22:22.240 --> 22:26.920
who do not realize that they are like ganas.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.400
They are like ganas, and imagine the ganas, how quick they are.

22:31.760 --> 22:36.480
The Ganesha is creating those ganas,

22:36.680 --> 22:39.560
and they are in the sternum bones first,

22:39.800 --> 22:42.040
and then they go all over the body.

22:42.280 --> 22:45.880
As soon as this Center Heart, the Mother's place,

22:46.080 --> 22:50.840
starts little bit vibrating, they get alerted.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.600
So we have to be alert.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.400
It's very important that we have to be alert.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.480
For about twelve years of your age

22:59.680 --> 23:03.600
these ganas stay there in the sternum bone,

23:03.800 --> 23:05.960
and then they go to the whole body,

23:06.081 --> 23:07.639
because they are matured enough.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.276
They are kept there till they are completely matured

23:10.397 --> 23:12.160
to fight the enemies.

23:12.400 --> 23:16.440
And they know what kind of enemies they have, they know everything:

23:16.640 --> 23:20.920
what kind of fighting is needed, what kind of opposition is there.

23:21.240 --> 23:26.680
They will just select and they will appoint themselves,

23:26.880 --> 23:30.560
who should fight whom, who should do this.

23:30.840 --> 23:35.920
But they just don't sit all the time in the Mother's house.

23:36.160 --> 23:40.560
So we have to go to the people.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.120
We have to go into the Virata's body.

23:44.320 --> 23:48.240
We have to move out, we have to go all out;

23:48.440 --> 23:51.920
without having any fear you have to fight them.

23:52.041 --> 23:54.168
Not to sit at home crying like a baby,

23:54.289 --> 23:56.640
now you are all grown-up people.

23:56.880 --> 24:03.760
So this is what is written in the Buddha's future life,

24:03.920 --> 24:08.920
that He becomes Matreya, means He has three Mothers in Him

24:09.120 --> 24:10.240
"Ma treya."

24:10.440 --> 24:13.760
But also that He goes all out in the society,

24:14.000 --> 24:18.920
He goes out everywhere and He changes people.

24:19.360 --> 24:24.280
When you asked for Gurupada you don't know, you were in trouble.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.360
Guru doesn't sit at home.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.560
He has to go all out, meet all kinds of people,

24:31.760 --> 24:36.160
tell them about Sahaja Yoga; not to be afraid.

24:36.281 --> 24:38.025
You have to live in the society,

24:38.146 --> 24:40.430
you don't have to have exclusive society

24:40.551 --> 24:44.360
where we enjoy bhajans and things - that's over now.

24:44.640 --> 24:48.920
I mean, of course we'll always have bhajans, it doesn't mean that.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.400
But you have to go beyond.

24:52.680 --> 24:56.560
Not only to be involved only in your own problems

24:56.760 --> 25:01.160
which are being now solved, so only in Sahaja Yoga,but Sahaja Yogis;

25:01.360 --> 25:03.480
but you have to go all out,

25:03.680 --> 25:05.160
meet other people,

25:05.360 --> 25:06.760
tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.920
The best is to wear badges so people ask, "Who is this?"

25:10.120 --> 25:14.400
- then you can talk to them, your friends, your society.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.560
You don't have to give up anything,

25:17.880 --> 25:20.000
don't have to give up anything.

25:20.240 --> 25:25.562
You are detached, you just go and see for yourself, this is wrong.

25:25.683 --> 25:27.997
Like yesterday they showed all kinds of things,

25:28.118 --> 25:30.040
also disco dance they showed you.

25:30.240 --> 25:33.080
You should go to the disco and give them the pamphlets,

25:33.280 --> 25:37.200
show them, "What are you doing, are you mad?"¨

25:39.920 --> 25:42.240
Or do this kind of a disco more there

25:42.440 --> 25:44.400
so they'll say, "What's wrong with them?"

25:44.600 --> 25:48.400
Then you say, "We are copying you."

25:52.200 --> 25:53.785
That will put them down.

25:53.906 --> 25:56.600
You see a lady who is, say, smoking and this and that,

25:56.800 --> 25:59.478
standing with a pose - go and stand before her with a pose

25:59.599 --> 26:01.199
and smoking like this.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.160
She'll stop it.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.600
So by copying them, one way,

26:07.880 --> 26:10.920
showing them what they are - another, writing.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.520
You must have writing.

26:12.720 --> 26:16.080
It's very important to write and answer.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.840
I must tell that there's a very nice article

26:19.040 --> 26:20.640
which has come now with Me,

26:20.761 --> 26:23.153
and the English Sahaja Yogis should take it from Me

26:23.274 --> 26:25.074
and answer the gentleman.

26:25.195 --> 26:29.120
It's very important. It's in My room, I'll give them.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.640
You must know what's happening all around -

26:32.880 --> 26:36.320
what's happening in Bosnia,

26:36.520 --> 26:38.920
what's happening in Italy, what's happening here.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.120
You should read newspapers.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.920
You can see television also,

26:44.240 --> 26:46.840
when - and now, when you are matured.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.680
Otherwise if you see television,

26:48.920 --> 26:52.640
you'll go mad like other television people are.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.600
So what's the use of seeing the television?

26:57.600 --> 27:00.400
But if you see the television with a detached mind,

27:00.600 --> 27:04.480
you'll immediately get the point where you have to hit.

27:04.800 --> 27:08.680
Otherwise you are sitting in the house nicely covered up,

27:08.880 --> 27:14.080
"Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother." That's not so.

27:17.280 --> 27:21.280
Ganesha gives powers to these ganas and they fight.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.640
That's why He's called as Ganapati.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.840
If you want to call Me Ganapati,

27:26.040 --> 27:28.840
then you have to be like ganas

27:29.160 --> 27:33.280
who go all out, and work it out.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.560
In so many ways, there's so many tricks

27:36.841 --> 27:38.438
which you can play on these people

27:38.559 --> 27:40.559
and try to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.560
And with you is this all-pervading Power.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.120
You should not shun them.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.520
For example, laws of your countries are so horrible,

27:48.840 --> 27:52.120
some of the laws are so horrible, the peculiar type.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.040
You should write.

27:54.280 --> 27:59.120
There's no equity, there's no sense in so many laws that you have,

27:59.320 --> 28:00.560
which are money-oriented

28:00.760 --> 28:05.040
- say, in France they have very, very funny laws.

28:05.480 --> 28:09.720
And they never maintain the law, they don't believe in it.

28:10.440 --> 28:16.080
There's no morals, there are no laws. You write to them.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.560
You must go and see newspaper people, tell them about it.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.440
Try to now assert yourself.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.080
Unless and until you do that,

28:26.280 --> 28:31.000
nobody is going to get to Sahaja Yoga.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.080
You might get very great people out of that.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.560
You can invite some people, you can call them.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.880
The modus operandi of these gurus I have seen.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.920
They write very nice letters to all these big, big johnnies,

28:44.120 --> 28:46.080
as soon as they go to some house.

28:46.280 --> 28:49.880
Then they seek interview, go and see that person, talk to him.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.320
They carry, you see, a sort of a -

28:53.760 --> 28:57.280
you can say a kind of a

29:01.240 --> 29:03.360
negotiations, you can call it,

29:03.600 --> 29:07.480
or a some sort of a panel will go and see them.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.000
It's all that level. And then they show them books.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.440
"See now this is happening, why don't you take to it?

29:12.640 --> 29:14.480
We don't want money,"  this thing, that thing.

29:14.720 --> 29:18.140
You might get lots of people. But you have to invite them,

29:18.261 --> 29:21.559
because unless and until you invite them, they'll not come to you.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.640
So you have to invite them, and you have to tell them

29:24.840 --> 29:26.880
that "We want to meet you. This is it."

29:27.080 --> 29:31.320
Out of at least hundred, if not, at least twenty will reply.

29:31.441 --> 29:33.449
They would like to meet you. You should say:

29:33.570 --> 29:35.359
"We found out this, we found out that."

29:35.480 --> 29:39.120
So now today as Ganesha's ganas

29:39.400 --> 29:41.520
you have to do this special work,

29:41.840 --> 29:44.440
is to understand now you are matured enough,

29:44.640 --> 29:46.840
you have to go in the society.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.320
Now if you get upset,

29:48.441 --> 29:51.292
"Mother, I went there and this happened and that happened."

29:51.413 --> 29:53.520
It doesn't matter.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.560
You are not going to be crucified,

29:55.880 --> 29:57.640
you are not going to be murdered.

29:57.920 --> 30:01.040
And do you know there's all the time My protection on you?

30:01.360 --> 30:03.680
If you want you can see a photograph we have,

30:03.880 --> 30:08.440
with, ah, him, you can see that, complete protection.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.600
It follows you, you have seen light on your heads.

30:12.930 --> 30:15.174
You are the marked people, who are going -

30:15.295 --> 30:18.160
you are already sitting in the Kingdom of God.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.280
Why should you be afraid?

30:20.520 --> 30:23.080
Why should you not meet people?

30:23.440 --> 30:25.920
Then also I said, make some music.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.359
Like yesterday's, I liked the way they were singing.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.935
At least, you see, whatever they were singing,

30:31.056 --> 30:37.600
may not be pop music sort or something, but it was clear.

30:38.720 --> 30:42.600
The message should be clear - you can use pop style, doesn't matter -

30:42.880 --> 30:45.280
but the message should be clear, it should not be

30:45.480 --> 30:48.240
- I can never understand what they are singing.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.160
So every word should be clear-cut.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.000
We can go all out to have real publicity,

30:55.240 --> 30:58.600
but for that we need people who are really matured enough.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.840
Otherwise with the slightest provocation

31:01.080 --> 31:05.000
they get upset, start fighting - finished.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.280
Also we should not say

31:07.480 --> 31:10.000
that "You are intellectual, you cannot understand."

31:10.200 --> 31:13.200
You say "You can, mentally also you can understand,

31:13.480 --> 31:15.840
we can explain to you." Prepare yourself.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.320
We can even have some sort of seminars or classes

31:19.560 --> 31:21.840
where we can discuss about these things.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.560
In the pujas you can have some sort of a

31:24.800 --> 31:26.880
- morning time is always free -

31:27.160 --> 31:30.680
some sort of a seminar or a discussion,

31:30.880 --> 31:33.720
or they call a brain trust or whatever it is.

31:33.841 --> 31:35.604
And there you can discuss things,

31:35.725 --> 31:38.045
how we can proceed, what we can do.

31:38.166 --> 31:40.680
Now the time has come. It's over now,

31:40.880 --> 31:44.320
all this preparation is over, you are prepared for it.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.600
Now you have to go all out, tell people.

31:47.920 --> 31:51.360
You know these people from this Brahmakumari what they tell,

31:51.600 --> 31:53.360
"Now the doomsday has come.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.360
You are all going to be doomed" - openly -

31:56.720 --> 32:01.240
"and so that you give us money, you'll be saved."

32:02.080 --> 32:05.440
So now you have to say that "This is the last judgment.

32:05.680 --> 32:09.080
You take your realization, otherwise you'll be doomed."

32:09.360 --> 32:11.880
Unless and until you take your realization,

32:12.120 --> 32:16.640
without your ascent you cannot get out of your genetic problems.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.080
All these genetic problems can be only solved

32:20.320 --> 32:22.920
if you get your realization.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.800
So you have to tell others, "Get out of your personal problems."

32:27.080 --> 32:31.520
"Mother, my wife has no children." It doesn't matter.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.480
There are so many children in this world,

32:33.680 --> 32:36.680
you are doing a good work by not having a child.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.760
And if you want to have a child, you can adopt a child.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.480
Then, "My child is like this, my child is like that, my child ..."

32:44.880 --> 32:47.320
So much attachment to children I've never seen.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.840
Before marriage

32:50.120 --> 32:54.160
if they have children, I've seen people treat them better.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.709
But if they are married, they kill their children.

32:56.830 --> 32:58.479
So many people kill their children,

32:58.600 --> 33:00.720
abuse their children, do all kinds of things.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.000
But once they are Sahaja Yogis they,

33:03.240 --> 33:08.920
from this end to that end, they just get glued to their children.

33:09.480 --> 33:15.720
So there should be a detached attitude towards everything,

33:17.040 --> 33:20.840
and no attachments. Then only you'll be free.

33:21.240 --> 33:24.880
But that doesn't mean that you are not doing your duty,

33:25.080 --> 33:29.440
your nourishment that is needed.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.600
You have to give love to everyone,

33:31.840 --> 33:33.440
you have to care for everyone,

33:33.640 --> 33:36.120
but you shouldn't get attached.

33:36.440 --> 33:40.200
I have seen people, they get attached even to Sahaja yogis.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.920
One Sahaja yogi misbehaved and went out of the Sahaja Yoga,

33:44.200 --> 33:48.000
ten Sahaja Yogis went away with him.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.080
They are not attached to Me but to that stupid Sahaja Yogi.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.800
He went to Nepal, he learnt some avidya,

33:54.000 --> 33:57.680
he came back, and they went away with him.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.640
That shows you have not developed your personality.

34:01.840 --> 34:06.360
How dare anybody influence you and say that get out of Sahaja Yoga!

34:06.560 --> 34:10.280
If you have a matured personality and responsibility, you will say

34:10.480 --> 34:15.120
"I have to do Sahaja Yoga work. That's the main thing I have to do."

34:15.760 --> 34:19.120
You must know that though you look ordinary people,

34:19.440 --> 34:22.480
but God has chosen you.

34:22.760 --> 34:29.480
If any one of you do not do Sahaja Yoga work, who will be blamed?

34:30.440 --> 34:33.240
In every aspect of life one should understand.

34:33.361 --> 34:36.120
You see, I don't say that you give Me money or anything,

34:36.241 --> 34:37.635
I don't want anything from you;

34:37.756 --> 34:39.716
as it is you know how much I am spending.

34:39.837 --> 34:42.640
But definitely if money is needed somewhere,

34:42.880 --> 34:46.840
you must go all out to help with money also.

34:47.240 --> 34:50.760
People will, they spend money in, say, races

34:51.080 --> 34:54.840
or spend money on some sort of a pub.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.880
All that money is saved now,

34:57.200 --> 34:59.320
you don't have to go to a pub, nothing.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.760
So if money is needed, you have to spend.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.400
Then another thing is, people just start asking

35:06.600 --> 35:09.760
why it's so expensive, why this, why that?

35:10.080 --> 35:14.520
In Sahaja Yoga everybody knows accounts, everybody has accounts,

35:14.880 --> 35:18.680
there's nothing secret - where money goes, what we are using for.

35:18.880 --> 35:21.040
How do you have this, say, tent?

35:21.240 --> 35:24.040
How do you have this land?

35:24.280 --> 35:27.400
How do you have Daglio?

35:30.391 --> 35:32.318
Just think, and nobody thinks like that,

35:32.439 --> 35:35.559
from where Mother gets money to do all this things?

35:35.680 --> 35:40.760
I don't need such a big castle, do I - for what?

35:41.320 --> 35:46.360
I've already bought another house in London from My own money. Why?

35:46.840 --> 35:50.760
It's already you have spent so much money for this Shudy Camp.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.680
It's giving no money at all.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.360
Well, I don't need Sahaja Yoga, it is you people who need it.

35:57.680 --> 36:01.840
And if you start saving money on that also,

36:02.160 --> 36:05.040
then I don't know what to say to you.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.520
It doesn't mean like

36:06.641 --> 36:09.603
in the church they say you must give money and all that,

36:09.724 --> 36:13.244
but your dedication.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.440
If you have the dedication

36:16.680 --> 36:20.640
then you will yourself think, that is my responsibility.

36:20.761 --> 36:23.482
On the contrary, you'll say, "Oh, you need money? All right."

36:23.603 --> 36:25.438
Now school has to be built.

36:25.559 --> 36:28.119
Who has built Vashi?

36:28.240 --> 36:30.320
Who has built this Ganapatipule?

36:30.640 --> 36:35.240
Who has built such a big ashram now you'll see in Delhi?

36:37.520 --> 36:42.280
Who has donated money for Sahaja Yoga so far?

36:44.200 --> 36:45.880
You all have prospered in life,

36:46.080 --> 36:48.440
you all have got sufficient money,

36:48.640 --> 36:53.120
but what are you doing?

36:57.000 --> 37:00.920
So in this aspect is,

37:01.160 --> 37:06.680
you have to see that you do your level best for Sahaja Yoga.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.760
Another side is your creativity.

37:10.080 --> 37:14.120
There have been very great artists who came out of Sahaja Yoga.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.360
If they have to give any present

37:16.680 --> 37:20.040
they'll give the smallest possible, the cheapest possible.

37:20.360 --> 37:24.560
The most expensive one they keep with themselves and sell it.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.760
If they could give even one piece like that

37:27.000 --> 37:30.760
we can sell it in the market, just for Sahaja Yoga.

37:31.200 --> 37:35.280
But they'll give something very cheapish which cannot be used;

37:35.560 --> 37:38.920
it's just adding up to My personal archives.

37:39.440 --> 37:43.200
But if they give something sensible it can be sold.

37:43.560 --> 37:46.840
The musicians who go abroad, they can give some,

37:47.560 --> 37:51.000
their programs and things can make some money.

37:51.360 --> 37:55.240
And also if it is needed, that money can be used.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.160
Do you know we, I just asked once

37:58.400 --> 38:01.680
that collect some money for Indian project,

38:02.040 --> 38:04.040
one year, in Sahasrara.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.280
You must know that,

38:05.480 --> 38:09.080
that there were only five thousand pounds collected,

38:09.440 --> 38:12.840
and I was so ashamed that they are still there as it is,

38:13.120 --> 38:15.120
in the bank.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.000
How can you send five thousand to India?

38:18.200 --> 38:21.240
What will they think of you?

38:24.480 --> 38:29.920
Even the school for you, it is for your children,

38:32.160 --> 38:33.640
not for Indian children.

38:33.880 --> 38:38.400
But still it will be built by Indians, I know that -- or by Me.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.560
Thus we should realize

38:41.840 --> 38:44.120
that if we are wasting some money somewhere,

38:44.400 --> 38:47.080
we can utilize some money for Sahaja Yoga.

38:47.320 --> 38:51.120
We should have some money for our organization.

38:51.480 --> 38:54.880
Otherwise this is how, whatever we save on food or anything,

38:55.080 --> 38:56.800
that's very little amount;

38:57.040 --> 39:00.320
but still we are managing.

39:01.920 --> 39:07.040
Every guru takes money outside first and then come to the puja

39:07.680 --> 39:12.840
- outside, and that too, real, sumptuous one.

39:13.265 --> 39:14.612
I don't need any money.

39:14.733 --> 39:18.680
Even your puja money, everything, you know it goes into silver,

39:19.000 --> 39:22.360
because you cannot have puja with plastics.

39:22.680 --> 39:28.640
So to understand this you have to have auspiciousness, holiness.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.760
Now, you call Me "Holy Mother,"

39:32.120 --> 39:34.920
but are you respectful like that?

39:35.280 --> 39:40.000
Do you know what I am? Ganesha knew.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.800
Once, His Father said that

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
"Whosoever goes round the Mother Earth first,

39:47.280 --> 39:50.520
I'll give that person a present."

39:51.000 --> 39:53.720
So another brother, Kartikeya,

39:54.040 --> 39:59.080
He had a nice vahana, a nice vehicle -

39:59.400 --> 40:01.720
was a peacock,

40:02.000 --> 40:08.200
while Ganesha had just a little rat, a mouse,

40:08.720 --> 40:11.160
and He could never have competed with Him.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.440
So He said, "Who is greater than My Mother?

40:13.680 --> 40:15.200
She is the greatest of all.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.280
What is this Mother Earth or anyone?

40:18.401 --> 40:20.668
She can create so many Mother Earths like that."

40:20.789 --> 40:23.480
So He just went round Her and He got the prize,

40:23.680 --> 40:27.840
and this Kartikeya was still flying.

40:30.280 --> 40:35.400
So that is what it is, to understand the auspiciousness.

40:36.760 --> 40:40.080
I mean, though I must say I'm a Mahamaya, no doubt, it's not easy.

40:40.280 --> 40:44.080
You will never know Me fully, never -- that should not be;

40:44.360 --> 40:48.280
because then you won't sit here, you'll all run away.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.640
But despite that, try to understand.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.720
As Ganesha has understood His Mother, you have to understand.

40:55.080 --> 40:59.440
That extent is rather difficult, but still try:

41:00.000 --> 41:02.920
that this is the Power sitting before you.

41:03.240 --> 41:06.720
How we behave, how we talk, how we take decisions,

41:07.000 --> 41:10.240
what we do, is all wrong.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.440
If this doesn't penetrate into your brains

41:14.800 --> 41:17.560
that means kundalini has not come there.

41:17.840 --> 41:22.400
People could not raise even one kundalini, one person's kundalini.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.840
Even this artist who came, she said, "How can it be possible?

41:26.200 --> 41:29.200
I'm not so - I've done nothing.

41:29.480 --> 41:33.560
I'm not a person who is a saint. How can I get realization?"

41:33.760 --> 41:37.720
She was telling Me like this, "How can it be, Mother?"

41:38.600 --> 41:41.000
But you all got it, no doubt you have,

41:41.280 --> 41:43.480
none of you have doubts about it.

41:43.680 --> 41:46.400
And not only that it's happening through Me,

41:46.600 --> 41:48.120
but you also can do it now.

41:48.320 --> 41:52.840
Who can do this kind of a thing, in the history of spirituality?

41:53.240 --> 41:59.720
But I keep a kind of a image of Myself,

41:59.920 --> 42:02.560
I joke, I make fun,

42:03.520 --> 42:08.280
I do everything just like a normal mother.

42:08.640 --> 42:12.120
But that should not give you liberties -- that should not.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.560
Some people have written very rude letters to Me.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.840
I must tell you: be careful,

42:17.120 --> 42:20.033
you can't write rude letters to Me.

42:20.154 --> 42:22.279
Better not. When you suffer then you'll say,

42:22.400 --> 42:24.399
"Mother, this has happened, that has happened."

42:24.520 --> 42:27.239
You have no business to write rude letters to Me.

42:27.360 --> 42:31.320
And though I read them and I forgive, no doubt,

42:31.520 --> 42:35.160
because you are ignorant. But you must have knowledge,

42:35.440 --> 42:36.760
you must understand this,

42:36.920 --> 42:40.360
that Whom are you writing and what you are writing.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.240
This side is, of course,

42:44.480 --> 42:50.280
we have to see that Shri Ganesha has also a parasha in his hand.

42:51.000 --> 42:58.040
He is one of the most strict deity, very strict.

42:59.520 --> 43:02.320
Others may little bit hesitate,

43:02.560 --> 43:05.600
but He cannot tolerate. That's why Christ has said that

43:05.800 --> 43:07.480
"I will tolerate anything against Me,

43:07.680 --> 43:12.320
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

43:13.480 --> 43:19.760
Clearly He has warned - clearly,

43:21.520 --> 43:25.000
because He has a parasha in His hand

43:25.560 --> 43:29.600
and people get punished, no doubt.

43:31.160 --> 43:34.760
So this is another thing one has to understand,

43:35.040 --> 43:38.360
that Shri Ganesha has this parasha.

43:38.640 --> 43:42.240
And you too all have this parasha in your hand,

43:42.480 --> 43:45.600
which you don't know.

43:46.920 --> 43:51.400
Anybody who will try to trouble you will be in trouble.

43:53.760 --> 43:57.320
But what is missing is the faith.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.880
not blind but enlightened faith.

44:01.200 --> 44:04.840
If you have enlightened faith, then it works.

44:05.280 --> 44:08.560
There's one gentleman working in London airport,

44:08.760 --> 44:10.840
he's an Indian

44:11.040 --> 44:15.120
but I think he was looked after by some Western foreigner people

44:15.400 --> 44:16.840
- very good man.

44:17.080 --> 44:21.440
So he cannot come to program, he is very busy and all that, he cannot.

44:22.360 --> 44:26.040
But if I am in the airport he knows I am there.

44:26.320 --> 44:29.480
Some people tried to trouble him.

44:30.560 --> 44:35.120
So he said that "Don't trouble me.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.360
My Mother is very strong, you know; don't trouble me."

44:38.600 --> 44:41.400
They wouldn't listen, three of them.

44:41.640 --> 44:45.240
And the three of them next day lost their jobs.

44:45.361 --> 44:47.598
He said, "Why?" They said, "We don't know.

44:47.719 --> 44:50.160
The boss told us, 'You get out of the jobs.'

44:50.360 --> 44:53.160
We don't know how we lost our jobs."

44:53.640 --> 44:57.440
And still today they haven't got jobs.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.040
He said, "I had told you."

45:03.161 --> 45:05.918
They said, "Who is your Mother? Let us meet Her also.

45:06.039 --> 45:09.199
You see, this is what has happened to us, sorry we did this to you..."

45:09.320 --> 45:12.640
But nothing works out now.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.080
So you must have full faith in Sahaja Yoga,

45:18.400 --> 45:21.720
in Me, and in yourself.

45:21.841 --> 45:24.013
Those who do not have faith in themselves,

45:24.134 --> 45:26.920
how can they have faith in others?

45:28.720 --> 45:32.200
This is another one thing you must understand,

45:32.480 --> 45:36.040
that you have tremendous powers,

45:36.480 --> 45:39.560
tremendous powers if you have faith.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.040
You'll just pray,

45:42.161 --> 45:44.311
"Mother, I want this gentleman to be cured,

45:44.432 --> 45:45.830
or this lady to be cured."

45:45.951 --> 45:48.240
It will be cured, you don't have to even touch that person --

45:48.480 --> 45:50.640
but your faith.

45:50.840 --> 45:53.480
Like yesterday they brought one lady.

45:53.720 --> 45:55.840
I was very busy, I was talking, doing this,

45:56.040 --> 45:58.680
and these are only two,three days when I have to really

45:58.880 --> 46:03.880
work very hard  with all the problems, and I couldn't see her.

46:04.120 --> 46:06.840
I said, "Why don't you go and cure? You can cure."

46:07.040 --> 46:09.520
Why should any Sahaja Yogi suffer from anything

46:09.720 --> 46:13.040
when there are other Sahaja Yogis?

46:13.360 --> 46:14.880
Why should I cure anymore?

46:15.080 --> 46:18.800
You all just put your hands and see if you can cure or not.

46:19.240 --> 46:22.360
Even your prayers are so powerful, you have no idea.

46:22.640 --> 46:24.160
Just pray.

46:24.440 --> 46:27.800
You have got the parasha in your hand, and nobody can harm you.

46:28.160 --> 46:32.200
And you have got the hand that can bless others.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.760
You have got that.

46:35.040 --> 46:39.720
You start your generosity and see, the Lakshmi will flow.

46:40.120 --> 46:42.000
But if you are not generous,

46:42.200 --> 46:45.200
calculating each and every pai - finished.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.520
Why should you?

46:47.840 --> 46:50.640
The Lakshmi will serve you.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.160
Know your powers, as Shri Ganesha knew it very well.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.160
He never bothered.

46:56.360 --> 46:59.680
Even with an elephant head He managed so many things.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.560
With human heads you should manage much better -

47:04.240 --> 47:08.000
or do you need elephant heads?

47:11.440 --> 47:13.000
Then another thing He has,

47:13.240 --> 47:16.560
that He's a satisfied person, extremely satisfied.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.880
And what He eats is a modoka, they have given Me just now here,

47:20.120 --> 47:23.000
is the modoka He eats.

47:23.760 --> 47:30.200
So that means that He eats something which is substantial,

47:30.600 --> 47:32.720
which has got all these dry fruits

47:32.920 --> 47:35.480
and everything in it, that's what He eats.

47:35.840 --> 47:41.840
And that is one capacity He has,

47:42.320 --> 47:44.000
to eat;

47:44.280 --> 47:46.720
because you can please Him by giving Him things.

47:46.920 --> 47:48.920
But Mine is just the other way round:

47:49.160 --> 47:51.640
I can't eat much, and you want to give Me.

47:51.920 --> 47:55.680
I don't know, He has taken all My capacity to eat, I think.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.920
But He can eat well.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.400
And whatever you eat,

48:00.640 --> 48:05.520
if you think of Him, "Shri Ganesha, I offer you this food also,"

48:05.920 --> 48:10.400
you'll never find dearth of food at all, never.

48:12.680 --> 48:18.200
Anything you want - like the other day it was very hot.

48:18.600 --> 48:21.440
They said, "Mother, let's cool it down."

48:21.640 --> 48:23.000
I said, "All right."

48:23.200 --> 48:24.760
As soon as we cooled it down,

48:25.000 --> 48:27.840
left to the right, Shri Ganesha comes in.

48:28.160 --> 48:30.120
So He came with full force,

48:30.320 --> 48:31.480
He cooled it down

48:31.680 --> 48:34.480
and rained, and rained and rained, brought water also

48:34.680 --> 48:36.880
because there was no water in these streams.

48:37.120 --> 48:41.440
You had to do your footsoaking, so water came also.

48:42.560 --> 48:46.800
And what a testing it - in one thing, how much happened.

48:47.360 --> 48:50.200
He tested you, He saw you, nothing happened.

48:50.440 --> 48:53.280
Even a little tent was not blown off.

48:53.640 --> 48:57.000
It was all fun.

48:59.760 --> 49:01.880
This is what is,

49:02.240 --> 49:05.840
that you are also a testing ground for others.

49:06.280 --> 49:08.440
Immediately you will know what sort of a man is.

49:08.640 --> 49:11.920
You are so powerful.

49:12.680 --> 49:16.280
Use your powers, use your powers.

49:16.480 --> 49:20.040
But what happens if your attention is on other things,

49:20.320 --> 49:23.280
it's not pure. Attention is on other

49:23.480 --> 49:28.760
- keep attention on Shri Ganesh,

49:29.240 --> 49:31.920
keep attention on Me.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.800
Everything will work out. Why should you work when

49:35.000 --> 49:37.640
He is there to work out everything for you,

49:37.880 --> 49:41.480
His ganas are there to work out for you?

49:41.880 --> 49:45.840
So put your attention in such a way

49:46.080 --> 49:53.200
that you know you are alert, daksha, you are alert,

49:53.440 --> 49:57.000
you know where is your attention going.

49:57.600 --> 50:01.760
And then you see the attention how it works.

50:02.520 --> 50:08.000
I never expected that I'll mature you so fast, but you have matured.

50:09.840 --> 50:14.000
But unless and until you know yourself fully what you have got,

50:14.280 --> 50:17.440
how am I to give you certificate?

50:17.640 --> 50:20.553
Even if I give certificate you won't believe.

50:20.674 --> 50:22.549
Like they say you have graduated.

50:22.670 --> 50:26.790
Now you are not only graduated, but you are masters.

50:27.000 --> 50:31.120
Otherwise I would never have told you to ask for Gurupada.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.520
You are praveenas now.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.760
"Praveen" means a master.

50:37.160 --> 50:38.920
Use your mastery.

50:39.240 --> 50:42.000
But still you are sitting at home, this, that,

50:42.200 --> 50:45.440
"My father is sick." Go and treat him

50:45.720 --> 50:48.920
- you are a master.

50:49.520 --> 50:53.480
Like Shri Ganesha, such a little thing like that

50:53.840 --> 50:57.440
is the master, you are also masters.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.680
The ladies also should know they are also masters.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.560
Instead of getting involved into smaller things

51:04.760 --> 51:08.840
and brickbats and all that, rise!

51:14.400 --> 51:18.240
The another great quality of Him is that

51:18.520 --> 51:23.920
He uses His teeth to write.

51:24.120 --> 51:28.600
Teeth come to you from Shri Krishna --

51:29.920 --> 51:33.760
wisdom of Shri Krishna which becomes the Virat, the brain.

51:34.160 --> 51:37.360
So He uses the teeth to write.

51:37.680 --> 51:41.080
He wrote Mahabharata with His teeth.

51:41.520 --> 51:45.760
So it is said that you must use

51:46.880 --> 51:50.680
your brain

51:51.920 --> 51:55.120
with the enlightenment of Shri Krishna

51:55.440 --> 51:58.640
and write, write, and write,

51:59.040 --> 52:03.880
and produce it into books.

52:04.200 --> 52:09.200
All these gurus have been successful because they created books.

52:09.920 --> 52:13.200
And these books were read by people

52:13.400 --> 52:15.480
and they were so much impressed,

52:15.680 --> 52:19.560
because anything black and white becomes something great.

52:19.880 --> 52:22.600
You can also make nice dramas as you have made.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.520
You can approach the televisions

52:25.720 --> 52:28.120
and things, that "We have a nice drama for children."

52:28.320 --> 52:31.920
Now think about going in to people,

52:32.320 --> 52:34.600
live in the society, live with them,

52:34.920 --> 52:38.400
deliver to them what you have got it. It's your duty.

52:38.800 --> 52:41.840
It's not only that but it is also,

52:42.120 --> 52:45.800
it's a special privilege to you.

52:46.080 --> 52:50.280
I mean, for today as it is we had to delay,

52:50.520 --> 52:54.720
and I've tried to give you

52:55.000 --> 52:57.240
some points about Shri Ganesh.

52:57.520 --> 53:00.640
I think even if you give Me hundred lectures I cannot finish it,

53:00.840 --> 53:04.040
it's so great, it's like an ocean to Me.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.000
So I hope you will understand the essential,

53:08.680 --> 53:11.800
the fundamental principles of Shri Ganesha,

53:12.040 --> 53:16.880
and what is innocence is. The first is wisdom.

53:21.480 --> 53:25.680
May God bless you all.

53:34.360 --> 53:37.800
Where is Sandeep?

53:43.640 --> 53:46.160
The tower we had, where is it?

53:46.360 --> 53:48.680
I had an ivory tower, where is it?.

53:49.840 --> 53:52.600
A tower like... It's kept there, I think, in the room.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.840
We should get it here.

54:03.280 --> 54:07.760
So today only the children will come, and unmarried girls,

54:08.040 --> 54:14.440
because today is - I mean, She was married, but She is the Virgin.

54:15.360 --> 54:18.880
She's a Virgin, when She created Ganesha,

54:19.080 --> 54:24.080
so we'll have unmarried girls as Gauris.

54:25.840 --> 54:30.400
Go and get the musicians now, you call the  musicians.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.360
You can send somebody to call the musicians.

54:36.560 --> 54:39.040
Who is in charge of the musicians now?

54:40.440 --> 54:42.520
They are already here.

54:45.200 --> 54:46.800
Alright.
