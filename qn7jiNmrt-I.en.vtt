WEBVTT

00:02.134 --> 00:05.460
Shri Hanumana had attained it.

00:05.570 --> 00:08.720
Just as Anjani Devi (Mother of Shri Hanumana)
had attained it.

00:09.110 --> 00:14.280
Like Anjani Devi and Hanumana, if we can,

00:14.570 --> 00:18.570
see the Spirit residing in our heart,

00:18.770 --> 00:21.500
if we get our Self-Realization,

00:21.710 --> 00:24.920
then there will be no question standing before us.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.280
All pain, wretchedness, poverty can go far away.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.050
We have many principles within us.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.259
They are still in the dormant state.

00:37.419 --> 00:39.809
They should get awakened.

00:40.010 --> 00:44.780
Unless they get awakened, there is no meaning of our lives.

00:44.972 --> 00:48.852
Our connection with God Almighty has not been established until now.

00:49.180 --> 00:52.100
Till our relationship with God Almighty is not established,

00:52.310 --> 00:54.950
how we will enter then into His Kingdom?

00:55.160 --> 00:58.364
And how we will get the boons that He wants to bestow upon us.

00:58.523 --> 01:00.970
That's why our relationship with God Almighty

01:01.170 --> 01:03.600
has to be established and has to be everlasting.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.610
This is the main thing, that it has to be ever-lasting.

01:07.810 --> 01:13.350
If meaninglessly we repeatedly call Vitthala

01:13.611 --> 01:17.588
and if He comes and stands before you, how will you recognize Him?

01:17.850 --> 01:19.930
Thus, the Apara Bhakti which exists

01:20.130 --> 01:23.830
and which is done without seeing, without knowing God Almighty,

01:24.030 --> 01:28.330
its fruit is today our Sahaja Yoga.

01:41.091 --> 01:43.070
To Ganesha we say,

01:43.280 --> 01:45.480
that, "Spontaneously we dived into the current

01:45.680 --> 01:48.880
so at the time of salvation, You protect us".

01:49.158 --> 01:51.288
The time of salvation has arrived today.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.882
It must be preserved and we should stay forever in it.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.610
For that there is no need to give money.

01:57.820 --> 02:00.250
God doesn't know what to do with money.

02:00.450 --> 02:04.602
This many people may not know that to God money is unknown.

02:04.803 --> 02:07.710
Now we went to rural places and told them, â€œSee,

02:07.920 --> 02:09.930
you should not give us money or anything like that."

02:10.140 --> 02:13.290
So they said, "Instead of 10 paisa should we give 20?"

02:13.500 --> 02:15.850
Does God understand money?

02:16.060 --> 02:17.550
When Shri Rama has come here,

02:17.760 --> 02:20.320
did He know what for are the money?

02:20.480 --> 02:23.080
Otherwise, there is an example of Hanumana,

02:23.290 --> 02:26.310
that Sitaji gave Him a big necklace of gold,

02:26.520 --> 02:28.750
and He was breaking every jewel seeing into it.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.670
They said, "Why are You breaking these golden balls?"

02:31.880 --> 02:34.300
He said, "I'm seeing if there is Shri Rama in it or not?

02:34.380 --> 02:36.150
In none of it is Shri Rama."

02:36.360 --> 02:39.160
The whole gold He thought was useless and He threw it away.

02:39.390 --> 02:42.140
Because Shri Rama was not there the gold was useless.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.137
This is what Hanumana showed you.

02:44.336 --> 02:46.629
Hence, Shri Ram who is residing within us,

02:46.830 --> 02:48.700
has to be attained by us.

02:48.910 --> 02:51.900
And after travelling in Shri Rama's kingdom,

02:52.030 --> 02:54.750
all our sorrows will end. This we know.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.310
And that happens.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.530
I want to tell you of a recent miracle.

02:59.740 --> 03:02.240
It doesn't mean that you should believe in it,

03:02.430 --> 03:05.150
but, it can happen, and has happened

03:05.350 --> 03:07.270
and similarly all of you should get your wellbeing

03:07.480 --> 03:08.830
and all of you should be happy.

03:09.030 --> 03:11.260
That's why God has made this plan,

03:11.470 --> 03:14.190
that "My devotees who are living in India,

03:14.389 --> 03:16.720
who have kept so much faith in God Almighty,

03:16.880 --> 03:19.360
should verily get this.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.490
They should verily get this. They should be blessed,

03:22.700 --> 03:25.790
that your benevolence should manifest.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.900
You should attain God.

03:30.910 --> 03:34.560
I'll tell you an experience.

03:34.820 --> 03:37.850
There is a small village called as Kalwa.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.490
A householder by the name Rajaram Patil stays there.

03:40.690 --> 03:45.150
He was very humbly placed in life, his situation was very humble.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.421
And he used to attend My program

03:47.652 --> 03:51.273
and would bring along his son and other fellows.

03:51.474 --> 03:54.190
So he used to bring his family and friends from Kalwa,

03:54.400 --> 03:57.447
and would bring garlands and things for Me. I said, "Rajaram Patil,

03:57.648 --> 04:00.909
at least allow Me to pay for your conveyance, it's too much for you.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.910
You feel like meeting Me is alright but how do you manage this?"

04:04.110 --> 04:06.355
He said, "God arranged everything for me, Mother."

04:06.556 --> 04:08.000
I asked him, "What happened?"

04:08.201 --> 04:10.244
He said, â€œI had a small uncultivated plot of land.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.079
There, I do meditation in the morning.

04:13.280 --> 04:18.453
One day a man came and said, "Your land has some special properties.

04:18.700 --> 04:21.841
Using this soil,

04:22.042 --> 04:24.920
someone told me that the bricks become like stones.

04:25.094 --> 04:27.420
That's why we have come here to see it.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.840
And this soil we shall buy in units of share (measuring unit).

04:31.000 --> 04:34.600
That land which he thought was barren and has abandoned,

04:34.730 --> 04:36.109
it got transformed into gold.

04:36.284 --> 04:39.061
This golden Dwarika, God can establish for you,

04:39.262 --> 04:41.530
if you attain God.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.920
His principle is extremely great. Many people just do not accept.

04:45.120 --> 04:49.524
Educated people do not accept that there is some Power of God.

04:49.770 --> 04:52.920
Now, just see around, all these trees that we see

04:53.130 --> 04:58.009
where do they come from? Who made them green?

04:58.210 --> 05:00.590
Who produces mangoes in a mango tree?

05:00.800 --> 05:02.710
Why does it not bear any other fruit?

05:02.920 --> 05:05.180
All this is being done by the Divine Power.

05:05.390 --> 05:09.580
And you are going to witness today
if this Divine Power exists or not.

05:09.780 --> 05:12.734
And when that Divine Power of God will come in you

05:12.940 --> 05:15.430
then the dormant, extremely

05:15.640 --> 05:18.390
deep type of principles, even the principle of Lakshmi itself,

05:18.600 --> 05:22.050
will get awakened and your life will change tremendously.

05:22.250 --> 05:25.160
People got many benefits out of Sahaja Yoga. First and foremost is

05:25.370 --> 05:28.400
that people have attained physical well being.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.750
Physical illnesses get cured.

05:33.265 --> 05:37.655
Because of that plenty of our money and

05:38.190 --> 05:40.200
troubles get saved.

05:40.400 --> 05:45.290
Then, many people who have mental problems get cured.

05:45.670 --> 05:49.550
Then, many who have intellectual problems are saved from them.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.798
You are luckily not so highly educated,

05:51.999 --> 05:53.405
having less intellectual problems.

05:53.606 --> 05:56.180
Highly educated people have plenty of intellectual problems.

05:56.380 --> 05:59.911
So, lacking those problems is a good thing.

06:01.103 --> 06:03.520
And, after that

06:03.750 --> 06:07.000
those people

06:07.240 --> 06:10.200
who have Lakshmi problems (financial problems), that also gets solved.

06:10.460 --> 06:15.349
This way, many problems which we are in fear of, get destroyed,

06:15.550 --> 06:18.180
and we enter into the Kingdom of God

06:18.380 --> 06:21.600
and there we live in peace and joy.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.168
This is Sahaja Yoga,

06:23.343 --> 06:25.827
and no matter how much is told about it, it's still too less.

06:26.028 --> 06:31.790
I mean I'm constantly, daily, giving one lecture.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.060
And at every place,

06:34.260 --> 06:37.260
I speak so much and still people say that I have said something new.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.963
So, there is no end to it.

06:39.106 --> 06:42.411
If you have any question, please ask Me now.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.819
He was Pawan Putra (Son of Wind God), isnt it?

06:59.002 --> 07:00.879
So the wind is blowing.

07:01.080 --> 07:05.880
Ha, if there are any questions, you should ask.

07:08.580 --> 07:11.760
Are there no questions?

07:25.760 --> 07:28.860
Some questions should be asked, isn't it?

07:29.020 --> 07:33.130
O.k. Now I'll tell you one question.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.623
One question which should be asked is,

07:37.824 --> 07:39.859
"Mataji how does this all happen?

07:40.060 --> 07:43.370
How does it take place?" Shouldn't we ask such a question?

07:43.700 --> 07:48.100
Just because somebody says something, we should not believe it.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.820
You should ask, "How can it be like this? You say so,

07:52.020 --> 07:55.560
all these big stories are true or not?"

07:55.760 --> 07:58.650
So within us there is one such power,

07:58.850 --> 08:02.060
which is known as Kundalini.

08:02.300 --> 08:07.457
She resides at the base of our spine in the triangular bone,

08:07.680 --> 08:09.440
coiled like a serpent.

08:09.640 --> 08:13.000
She is stationed as a power in the shape of three and a half coils.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.120
This power is called as Kundalini.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.046
And since immemorial times She has been described

08:19.247 --> 08:22.438
by Dattatreya and so on.

08:22.653 --> 08:27.363
It is described in many books. Markandeya existed 1400 years back.

08:27.470 --> 08:30.600
Even he has described Kundalini.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.530
In the Devi Mahatmyam and Devi Puran that he has written

08:33.740 --> 08:35.834
he has described the Kundalini.

08:36.048 --> 08:39.870
This power is in a dormant state within us,

08:40.080 --> 08:45.740
because this power is our pure desire, our true desire.

08:46.221 --> 08:50.021
Now we think that our true desire means that today

08:50.230 --> 08:52.550
if we have a house is enough, It is not so.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.359
If you get the house then you want to have a vehicle.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.400
After the vehicle you want to have children.

08:57.610 --> 08:59.287
After children you want something else.

08:59.488 --> 09:02.650
So which is the pure, true desire?

09:03.070 --> 09:06.190
She is a power within us. Pure desire is

09:06.391 --> 09:09.261
that our relationship with God Almighty

09:09.460 --> 09:11.434
should be established,

09:11.635 --> 09:13.869
that we should meet God Almighty,

09:14.070 --> 09:16.990
that our connection (Yoga) with God Almighty should be established.

09:17.150 --> 09:20.680
This is the pure desire and it has not yet been awakened.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.590
She is the Kundalini power which resides in our triangular bone.

09:24.860 --> 09:28.060
If She gets awakened then this work manifests.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.370
And many times She will also be visible to your eyes.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.620
In the triangular bone She is working like a heart,

09:34.830 --> 09:36.650
because She pulsates.

09:36.850 --> 09:39.030
And if that Kundalini power gets awakened,

09:39.240 --> 09:41.880
the cool breeze of the divine power starts flowing in our hands.

09:42.080 --> 09:46.513
and you experience chaitanya which spreads in all four directions.

09:46.719 --> 09:50.460
This Divine Power which is working in all four directions

09:50.660 --> 09:53.420
which does all the Divine work,

09:53.630 --> 09:56.400
is first and foremost experienced.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.310
And how to do it? That in short words,

09:59.520 --> 10:04.497
I am thinking to do it now. But if you have questions better ask.

10:09.930 --> 10:14.910
Ask, ask because otherwise your attention remains there, I've seen.

10:16.530 --> 10:19.480
Ask, ask.

10:21.690 --> 10:25.770
Ask. A question or so should be asked.

10:26.840 --> 10:33.100
S: (Inaudible)

10:35.010 --> 10:37.450
SM: [unclear]

10:37.660 --> 10:41.913
S: The road going to and from the Hanuman Temple and vehicle -

10:42.114 --> 10:46.101
these issues raised by the Trust;
will this pure desire get fulfilled?

10:46.370 --> 10:49.040
SM: It will happen.

10:49.530 --> 10:52.230
But it is not such a big issue.

10:52.430 --> 10:55.056
Road for going to Hanumana will be made. You do not know,

10:55.257 --> 10:58.040
many things will come to this country,

10:58.410 --> 11:01.520
but with that your satisfaction will not be gained.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.670
This is the main thing to be told.

11:03.870 --> 11:06.590
The road will be built, everything will happen,

11:06.790 --> 11:09.079
maybe here one of our ashrams will also be built.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.060
Something will happen, quite a lot will happen.

11:11.261 --> 11:13.200
but still it will not bring any satisfaction.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.740
Satisfaction will come after attaining God.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.870
Means what? What will happen?

11:18.080 --> 11:22.430
The biggest thing is that all your addictions will drop off.

11:22.700 --> 11:27.220
For attaining Hanumana the addictions should be dropped, shouldn't they?

11:27.420 --> 11:31.829
If we have all the addictions how will Hanumana be pleased with us?

11:32.030 --> 11:35.370
And if you want to go to the temple, go there, get your legs broken,

11:35.500 --> 11:37.800
and finally what will you get?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.470
Then I will ask one question on behalf of God.

11:40.680 --> 11:44.540
First your addictions should go away, shouldn't they?

11:45.065 --> 11:50.680
To get the blessings of God, should
we not be capable of receiving them?

11:50.990 --> 11:53.790
As I said, first you get that capability.

11:53.936 --> 11:55.426
That's Mother's work, so I'll do it.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.493
Hanumana's mother did everything she could.

11:57.700 --> 12:00.269
Now, let your Mother do what She wants to do.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.570
That capability you should attain and then everything will happen.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.800
Then whatever you say will happen.

12:06.010 --> 12:09.680
But first shall we not enter into the Kingdom of God?

12:10.070 --> 12:14.382
Now ask the second question. The question was too good.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.980
I'm a Mother after all. so there is no problem in asking Me any question.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.890
Mother is all ours. We ask her all the questions, don't we?

12:21.100 --> 12:24.490
If we don't ask Mother, then whom shall we ask?

12:24.890 --> 12:27.960
Yes ask some more.

12:28.157 --> 12:30.490
S: What should be done for raising the Kundalini?

12:30.720 --> 12:32.125
SM: That's the right question.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.501
That I will do. I'll tell you about, but otherwise?

12:34.702 --> 12:38.190
Right. He asked the right question. This is a seeker's question.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.390
This is the right question. For that very little has to be done.

12:41.550 --> 12:43.054
She rises spontaneously.

12:43.260 --> 12:46.932
As if there is some seed. If we want to sprout it, what do we do?

12:47.083 --> 12:48.912
You will say, "Plant it in the Mother Earth".

12:49.029 --> 12:52.570
It's just like that. This is the work of the Mother Earth.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.610
It happens spontaneously.

12:54.869 --> 12:58.185
"Saha-ja", "Saha" means: born with you.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.401
This Kundalini is born with you.

13:00.575 --> 13:02.561
And the connection that you get with Her,

13:02.724 --> 13:05.129
is your right, it's your birth right.

13:05.330 --> 13:07.555
Getting the connection established is your birth right.

13:07.756 --> 13:09.613
That you should take.

13:10.480 --> 13:15.004
Once you get enlightened, just like a lamp enlightens another one,

13:15.205 --> 13:18.730
similarly you can enlighten others also.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.280
Just a little bit of it you should know.

13:22.480 --> 13:26.670
Small children can also do it. Everyone can do it.

13:27.790 --> 13:30.952
Now ask one more question and then we will do it.

13:31.127 --> 13:32.952
S: Provision for water also?

13:33.160 --> 13:36.570
SM: Yes, everything.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.620
Everything that you have asked for, is material.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.519
Provision for water should be made, there's so much poverty,

13:42.720 --> 13:45.020
there's so much distress.

13:45.400 --> 13:49.310
If I'm to speak, the village from where my father hailed,

13:49.510 --> 13:51.392
I'd been to that village...

13:51.559 --> 13:53.145
L: What is this Sahaja Yoga?

13:54.526 --> 13:57.100
SM: What did she say?

14:03.859 --> 14:06.458
What do you want, tell Me.

14:07.985 --> 14:11.375
What did she say? Her language is different.

14:11.576 --> 14:14.265
How should a person get rid of Tamo guna?

14:14.464 --> 14:17.170
How can we establish oneness and affection with others?

14:17.371 --> 14:20.647
The Tamo-guna that exists in a person, how can it be reduced?

14:20.812 --> 14:23.237
And, how can a person experience oneness with others.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.090
SM: That's right. That's a very nice question.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.814
His question is related to dharma,

14:28.053 --> 14:30.999
that how can we get the feeling of love for others.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.480
Because of Tamo-guna we don't feel love for others;

14:34.681 --> 14:39.729
also because of Rajo-guna when people become bumptious.

14:39.930 --> 14:42.750
Then how does this happen?

14:42.940 --> 14:45.020
Now, these people are here from 14 countries.

14:45.220 --> 14:48.670
They have love for you. They came here to meet you.

14:48.890 --> 14:52.240
But you people lack oneness. What's the reason for that?

14:52.440 --> 14:54.440
Now see this finger of Mine;

14:54.640 --> 14:57.344
if it gets hurt,

14:57.530 --> 15:00.400
I don't need to tell anyone, because if I get hurt,

15:00.600 --> 15:04.090
then I will soothe it and relieve it Myself.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.070
Isn't it? Because it's My own finger.

15:07.370 --> 15:12.822
Similarly, you are part and parcel of the Viratha Purusha.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.200
All of you are! But still the awareness is missing,

15:17.618 --> 15:21.750
the awareness that we are part and parcel of Almighty God

15:21.988 --> 15:23.555
This awareness is missing.

15:23.763 --> 15:26.466
The moment this Realization takes place,

15:26.667 --> 15:28.509
the cool breeze comes in your hands,

15:28.710 --> 15:31.690
and a new awareness gets awakened.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.990
Now, we have various awarenesses.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.828
Compared to animals we are much more evolved.

15:38.035 --> 15:39.273
Evolution has taken place.

15:39.474 --> 15:41.070
Suppose an animal is told,

15:41.280 --> 15:43.660
"You walk across this filth", it will walk across.

15:43.870 --> 15:46.881
But, if you tell a human being, he won't be able to.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.910
But, when you realize your Self

15:51.242 --> 15:55.817
then, the first and foremost awareness that you get is,

15:56.010 --> 16:00.080
that we all are part and parcel of the same Being.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.830
On you fingers you will know

16:03.040 --> 16:05.530
what problems a person is having.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.690
What problems does a person have?

16:07.820 --> 16:10.670
His stomach is paining. You'll be sitting and you'll say,

16:10.880 --> 16:12.970
"Do you have a headache?", "How do you know?".

16:13.170 --> 16:15.440
Means, "I know it through my fingers".

16:15.640 --> 16:17.440
Your fingers  will start speaking

16:17.580 --> 16:19.870
and you will know that he has that problem,

16:20.080 --> 16:22.140
that his one chakra or another is catching.

16:22.280 --> 16:26.320
That means that the collective consciousness gets awakened.

16:26.658 --> 16:28.091
Who is the other?

16:28.292 --> 16:30.781
It is told to Me, "Mataji, You have done lot of favors",

16:30.982 --> 16:32.391
but who is the other?

16:32.592 --> 16:35.300
If everyone is part and parcel of our being, then who is the other?

16:35.492 --> 16:37.572
If you are having any pain I'll also get the pain.

16:37.780 --> 16:41.870
If I remove my own pain then what favor have I bestowed upon you?

16:42.110 --> 16:45.020
So, this awareness is not yet awakened in us.

16:45.230 --> 16:47.230
Once it gets awakened,

16:47.430 --> 16:52.452
we'll give our life for each other because as our nose, eyes, mouth

16:52.620 --> 16:55.260
is all ours, similarly all these people are also ours;

16:55.470 --> 16:58.410
this awareness comes into us.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.520
This is an awareness and it comes within us.

17:01.702 --> 17:07.842
This is the transition from the state of "human" to "super-human".

17:08.068 --> 17:10.878
When a human becomes a super-human

17:11.080 --> 17:14.060
then we realize what are the troubles of others.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.940
This awareness has to be awakened.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.880
And that will happen.

17:19.070 --> 17:22.709
Then there will be love among us. Jealously, hatred, all will go.

17:22.910 --> 17:27.195
Because we are all one, we should help each other.

17:27.396 --> 17:29.758
Because we are one, one and the same being.

17:29.950 --> 17:32.080
But because this awareness is not yet awakened,

17:32.280 --> 17:33.900
due to the ignorance,

17:34.110 --> 17:36.201
this knowledge has to be awakened within,

17:36.402 --> 17:38.223
we should feel it on our central nervous system.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.960
On your fingers you should feel it.

17:41.120 --> 17:44.310
It should be felt. Jaaniv, is a very good Marathi word.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.440
You should know it, not with your brain,

17:47.610 --> 17:50.760
like saying "we are brothers and sisters" and then start quarrelling.

17:51.230 --> 17:55.070
We should feel it from within.

17:55.950 --> 17:59.500
This will happen in the whole universe.

17:59.760 --> 18:03.429
All right? Very nice question.

18:03.630 --> 18:05.245
Such thought should exist

18:05.446 --> 18:07.344
that there should be oneness between all of us.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.550
We are all one, but due to the ignorance,

18:09.760 --> 18:12.270
blind people always feel that we are all different.

18:12.410 --> 18:15.160
But once we get the vision then we are all one,

18:15.320 --> 18:18.460
then there is no difference.

18:19.970 --> 18:22.280
As they say Avya(Spirit) has no caste.

18:22.490 --> 18:25.710
The one who becomes a Yogi, to him caste and so on. has no meaning.

18:25.910 --> 18:28.090
It's all the same.

18:29.740 --> 18:33.920
O.k. now, what has to be done for it?

18:34.640 --> 18:37.919
First of all I'm a Mother, so no need of wearing a cap in front of Me.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.223
You sit straight as you sit in front of your mother.

18:40.424 --> 18:43.346
Sit as you sit in front of your mother, absolutely simple and sober.

18:43.547 --> 18:47.157
There should be no difficulty in it. Sit in a very simple posture.

18:47.350 --> 18:48.851
How do we sit in front of our mother?

18:49.052 --> 18:52.527
Think of it while sitting in front of Me.

18:52.755 --> 18:55.741
You should have the same kind of love that you have for your mother.

18:55.942 --> 18:57.309
All our work is that of love.

18:57.510 --> 19:00.657
So we should sit in complete love.

19:01.370 --> 19:05.436
Now, just place both the hands like this on your lap, slowly.

19:05.635 --> 19:08.043
Place them like this slowly.

19:13.866 --> 19:16.501
Quietly.

19:35.920 --> 19:40.440
And now we should close our eyes. Everybody should close the eyes.

19:40.842 --> 19:43.866
No giggling. See,

19:44.067 --> 19:47.141
it's not going to work out like this. Be quiet,

19:47.350 --> 19:49.960
we are doing Divine work, aren't we?

19:50.270 --> 19:52.970
Close your eyes. Close your eyes and sit down.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.950
What's there to giggle in closing your eyes?

19:56.160 --> 19:58.680
Because of this in our villages,

19:58.840 --> 20:01.761
that's why it doesn't work out in villages.
