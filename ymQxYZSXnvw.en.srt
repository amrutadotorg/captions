1
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,105
To all the seekers of truth, I bow.

2
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:25,421
Warren has said something today

3
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:29,949
which I've been trying
to avoid all these years

4
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:35,552
because I thought it was
not advisable at this time

5
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:41,920
to talk so directly to
human beings about it.

6
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:46,589
Because as soon as
somebody says such a thing

7
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:51,134
a snake called ego comes up

8
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,720
or else

9
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:04,725
people try to harm the cause.

10
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,979
They don't want to hear about it.

11
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:12,091
This has happened with all
the great incarnations.

12
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:15,275
And you have seen how Christ

13
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:18,770
was crucified by people because he said

14
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:23,347
that "I'm the light, I'm
the path," which He was.

15
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:26,267
This was the truth, no doubt.

16
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:32,450
But I realized that everything
that is truth is not to be said.

17
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:35,477
As He Himself has said

18
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:39,689
that "Don't throw your pearls."

19
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:48,158
Because who do not understand
the value of the pearls

20
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,352
will destroy

21
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,659
out of ignorance

22
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:59,302
or out of aggression.

23
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:06,024
I have to accept today that in
Australia today is a first moon day

24
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:10,542
that what Warren has
said is the truth.

25
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:18,363
When people ask me how can it be
possible to have realization so fast

26
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,977
in India it is not necessary to tell them.
They just know.

27
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:28,485
Because Adi Shankarcharya has
written so many books about me.

28
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:32,707
And He said it is only She who will
come and give en masse realization.

29
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:37,820
What ever you may try
else, it's of no use.

30
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,296
And that is why,

31
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,929
it is very easy for
them to recognize me.

32
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:49,394
But we have also westernized
Indians in the cities

33
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:53,982
which are left to the gurus who
teach them nonsensical things that

34
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,940
you can achieve God through your sex.

35
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:02,138
Because they have certain
weaknesses developed

36
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:08,045
and they don't want to
accept Christ at all.

37
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:14,081
They accept what these pseudo
gurus are telling them

38
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:18,565
and pay money for it an
harm themselves very badly.

39
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:26,517
As I told yesterday, Christ has said

40
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,491
that ten commandments

41
00:16:31,094 --> 00:16:34,687
it is said "Thou shall
not commit adultry."

42
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:38,618
But I say, "Thou shall not
have adultrous eyes."

43
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:42,093
What a subtle idea of purity He had.

44
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:46,770
Do we understand what
He was saying to us?

45
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:51,552
Or thus by going to the church we think
we have become the followers of Christs?

46
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:53,674
And that's why He said again,

47
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:57,374
"You'll be calling me Christ, Christ.
I won't recognize you."

48
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,809
That's a fact.

49
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:04,309
I'm not against any church

50
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:07,475
or any organization whatsoever.

51
00:17:07,764 --> 00:17:13,120
But when they profess that they are
following a particular ideology

52
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:16,522
or a particular incarnation,

53
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:19,585
they should not do just the opposite

54
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:23,435
what the incarnations taught them.

55
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,839
It is hard to understand
in these modern times

56
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:33,268
that people still have
some faith in Christ.

57
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:40,301
Today I'm going to tell
you where He resides

58
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,651
and how we have to awaken Him

59
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,880
and is so important
about Christ's life

60
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:51,018
and why did He die on the cross when
He could kill every one of them

61
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:54,136
and destroy the whole universe.

62
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:58,656
He has got eleven <i>rudras</i>. That is He
has got eleven powers to destroy.

63
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,262
When He will come in His real form,

64
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:05,571
then there will be no
time for us to think,

65
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,102
no time for us to meditate,

66
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:11,611
no time for Me to counsel
or to redeem you.

67
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:15,515
That time is such

68
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:20,111
that you will be just sorted out,

69
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:24,825
no arguements, no
talking, no questioning.

70
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,349
You will be just redeemed

71
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:33,786
by just being get sent to
the hell or to heaven.

72
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:38,275
There won't be any
compromise at that time,

73
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:43,545
when His powers of the eleven
<i>rudras</i> will start working.

74
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:49,648
Even today there are people who do not
believe in the incarnation of Christ.

75
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:54,372
Very nice because that's
the ego behind them

76
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,902
and those who pamper
their ego like this

77
00:19:02,135 --> 00:19:04,333
they like such people.

78
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:10,241
We do not understand what
Christ has done for us.

79
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:13,093
Let me tell you about

80
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:17,028
His own subtle methods by
which He came on this earth.

81
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:23,436
In the Devi Puran,

82
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,394
which you people seldom read,

83
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:31,830
I think it is translated in English,

84
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:34,260
which was written 14
thousand years back.

85
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:37,966
As I told, only 50 years back all
these people came

86
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:42,331
and got all the perverted,
useless literature printed

87
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,914
and everbody is basing their
analogies on those 50 years,

88
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:52,424
which are nothing compared to the
traditional thousands of years

89
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:56,045
which were spent in
India in seeking God.

90
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:04,029
Fourteen thousand years back,
Markendaya, a great poet,

91
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,037
has written about Kundalini,

92
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,593
has written about the Mother.

93
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,698
He has written about Christ.

94
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,648
He called Him Mahavishnu

95
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:19,579
because He is the son of Vishnu.

96
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:25,546
He has described it in such a way that
if you read it you will be amazed.

97
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:29,787
You'll think all the special
points of Christ are described.

98
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:35,552
He was called as the support,
Adhara, of the universe.

99
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:40,284
On Kundalini it can be prooved
also that He was Mahavishnu.

100
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:43,046
Because when the Kundalini rises,

101
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:46,165
which is a living process as I
told you, is not some humbug

102
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,934
that you just start
jumping and shooting and

103
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:51,409
this thing, all this
kind of a nonsense,

104
00:20:51,523 --> 00:20:55,185
but when actually you see
pulsation rising within you.

105
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,628
Then you can see very clearly

106
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:00,533
that when it stops here

107
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:04,985
you have to take the name
of Lord Jesus Christ,

108
00:21:05,316 --> 00:21:07,437
otherwise it won't open out.

109
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:11,763
This position where you
see the agnya chakra is.

110
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:17,007
It won't open out unless and until you
take the name of Lord Jesus Christ.

111
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:22,956
All over the world whether they were Hindus,
Christians, Muslims or any one, Jews,

112
00:21:23,189 --> 00:21:25,623
they have to accept Christ,

113
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,492
as the gate through
which you have to pass.

114
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,479
Of course other
incarnations are there,

115
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:37,179
but He is at this gate through which

116
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,298
everyone has to pass.

117
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,188
Not by going to church

118
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,452
or by artificial method of baptism,

119
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,613
but actualization of the baptism.

120
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:55,732
It's the actualization is the
point, not artificial things.

121
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,222
And when it crosses that,

122
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:05,381
you suddenly find that there
is a suction that takes place

123
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:10,708
of these two institutions
of ego and superego.

124
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:13,736
That's how it takes away our sins,

125
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:15,744
our conditionings,

126
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:18,053
and our karmas.

127
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:20,657
Everything He sucks in within Himself.

128
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:24,101
By that suction you find

129
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:28,717
a space is created in the talu
area, in the fontanelle bone area,

130
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:32,535
and where the Kundalini
pearces through you can feel

131
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,872
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

132
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:38,188
That is the real baptism.

133
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:42,609
Because the churches could
not deliver the goods,

134
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:46,468
people took to another kind of life.

135
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:50,017
They are also exactly the same.

136
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:52,331
You go to any religion,

137
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:55,457
every religion is doing
artificial things.

138
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,554
For example in the morning

139
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:02,073
Muslims are standing saying,
"Allah hu Akar, Allah hu Akbar."

140
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:05,627
They don't know where
Akbar exists within them.

141
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:08,640
Akbar exists here, is the Virat.

142
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:14,320
Is the great Primordial Being
starts from here and is over here

143
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,431
expressed in the brain.

144
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:22,048
There is no connection what
so ever with that Akbar

145
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:29,503
and mechanically they
are doing this namaz,

146
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:32,511
while namaz is nothing but the
awakening of the kundalini.

147
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,276
It can be proved now.

148
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:43,308
 Once you get your realization
everything can be proved.

149
00:23:44,784 --> 00:23:46,791
But you can not force

150
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:49,364
truth to be the way you are.

151
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:57,243
You can not ask God to
be organized by you.

152
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:01,930
You have to surrender to His ways

153
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:05,230
and His methods if you want

154
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:08,915
to benefit and to become
the higher personality.

155
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:16,764
If we are seekers, we
are seekers of truth

156
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,939
and truth is the Spirit,

157
00:24:21,956 --> 00:24:26,495
that resides in the
heart of human beings

158
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,011
is the reflection of God Almighty.

159
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,639
He's the one who represents

160
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,216
all the three aspects

161
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:48,024
of existence, of
creation and evolution.

162
00:24:52,014 --> 00:24:54,879
He is reflected in your heart.

163
00:24:55,388 --> 00:24:58,029
Depends on the kind
of a heart you have

164
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:01,435
if the heart is clean,

165
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:03,958
is beautiful,

166
00:25:04,657 --> 00:25:07,686
above the mundane things of life,

167
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:15,157
above the animal instincts within us,

168
00:25:16,787 --> 00:25:18,658
that heart reflects

169
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,189
God very easily.

170
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,779
Holy Ghost is the power of God.

171
00:25:24,835 --> 00:25:29,007
I know in the bible not
much was written about Her,

172
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:33,991
because they allowed Him

173
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:37,374
just to live for four
years, just imagine.

174
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:41,208
I'll tell you about my own life.

175
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:46,651
In London I was struggling with 7 sahaja
yogis for 4 years. 7 sahaj yogis.

176
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:49,962
It's not easy to crack
that English brain.

177
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:52,911
It's a horrible nutty thing,

178
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,619
thinks no end of itself.

179
00:25:56,113 --> 00:26:00,704
7 of them, I fought with them for 4 years.
You can not believe.

180
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:04,465
In those short period of 4
years what could Christ do?

181
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,316
What could He achieve? It is not easy.

182
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,236
You know the people
are so ego oriented,

183
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,172
that they can not accept a
carpenter's son to be God,

184
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,287
to be the incarnation.

185
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:27,197
It is so difficult for them
to accept any such thing.

186
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:30,280
They immediately get identified

187
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:34,144
with their riches, with their power,
with all these worldly things,

188
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:36,216
which has no meaning to Christ.

189
00:26:40,715 --> 00:26:45,297
To think that Moses was separate from
Christ is another very big mistake.

190
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,317
There's no difference at all.

191
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:55,724
Christ Himself has said, "Those who
are not against Me are with Me."

192
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:58,054
Who are those who are against him?

193
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,206
Moses was there on this earth

194
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:07,209
to cross only this path.

195
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:10,280
It is very symbolic the
way He crossed the sea

196
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:14,557
to show how to cross this path.

197
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:16,893
He was the incarnation,

198
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:20,655
one of the the incarnations,
of the Parmordial Master.

199
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,328
There were ten, great incarnations
of Primordial Masters.

200
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,480
One of them was Moses,

201
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:30,972
Abraham,

202
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:33,393
Lao Tze,

203
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,924
Janaka, Nanak.

204
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,509
There are ten of them who were major

205
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:44,002
incarnations of the same principle.

206
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,081
Mohammed

207
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,470
They are all related to each other.

208
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,383
You'll be surprised what
relation exists between them.

209
00:27:56,236 --> 00:28:00,002
There's no fight, which you
learn in your kundalini.

210
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:04,472
They are so intergrated and such
concord exists between them.

211
00:28:04,521 --> 00:28:06,542
There is no fight at all.

212
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:10,257
If there is any fight it is
between the evil and the good.

213
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:13,520
But the good is all together.

214
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:17,986
They talked of righteousness.

215
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,613
We want to have God,

216
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,196
but we don't want to have goodness.

217
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,557
We go against Him every minute.

218
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:33,488
We do every work which
is anti-God activitiy,

219
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:37,247
either harming ourselves
or harming others,

220
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,378
and then we think we
are seekers of God.

221
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:45,202
There should be no delusion,
no deception of yourself.

222
00:28:45,548 --> 00:28:47,265
Please remember,

223
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:50,781
this is the last chance.
This is the last judgement.

224
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:53,288
This is the resurrection time.

225
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:55,828
You have to be very careful about it

226
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,073
and if you loose your chances now,

227
00:29:00,764 --> 00:29:05,002
you will have problems later on

228
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,557
of such variety that you
won't be able to solve.

229
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:17,248
Already there are signs
of these problems,

230
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,655
which are incurable,

231
00:29:19,997 --> 00:29:22,052
which can not be solved,

232
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:26,437
which are beyong human solution.

233
00:29:28,943 --> 00:29:32,937
So we have another center here
which we didn't deal yesterday,

234
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,309
is the heart center.

235
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,363
But before that in this void,

236
00:29:40,383 --> 00:29:46,349
this place where there is a gap,

237
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,084
ten incarnations, as
I told you, reside

238
00:29:51,204 --> 00:29:53,338
and they give us the balance.

239
00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:57,046
The balance of our Being.

240
00:29:57,856 --> 00:29:59,831
That is the religion.

241
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,387
The valancy that we have,

242
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:06,151
the ten valencies that are within us

243
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,668
are balanced by this.

244
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:14,446
People say that why
should we be righteous?

245
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:17,246
All right be not.

246
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:20,016
You suffer only in this world.

247
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:25,489
Those who think they can make money by
deceiving others are not happy people.

248
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,387
They can't sleep in the night.

249
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,693
They have problems.

250
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:32,968
All the gurus are sufferning
from diseases and things.

251
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:38,082
There are some who can
not even smell flowers.

252
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:40,257
You can imagine this
is their situation.

253
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:44,754
Flower which is the most beautiful thing
that God has created they can not smell.

254
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:49,725
While it is written in all the ancient
scriptures that God is fond of flowers.

255
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:51,872
In the name of Shri Vishnu

256
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:54,707
there are atleast 15 names which say

257
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:57,779
that he is mad after flowers,

258
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:00,866
he very fond of flowers,
he must smell the flowers

259
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:09,104
and we also know that
God is fond of flowers.

260
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:13,306
Somehow we know through our
unconscious understanding

261
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:17,237
that God is fond of
everything that is beautiful.

262
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,831
He doesn't like ugliness,

263
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,511
but beauty that is sublime.

264
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:28,469
Now these ten incarnations
came on this earth,

265
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,180
one after another at different places,

266
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:33,934
to teach us how to be in balance.

267
00:31:35,195 --> 00:31:39,398
And they said do this and don't
do that and don't do that.

268
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:43,144
But human beings are very good
at finding out loop holes.

269
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:46,580
At the time,

270
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:49,779
say at Mohammed sahab's time

271
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:54,350
they had alcohols, but
no smoking was there.

272
00:31:56,613 --> 00:32:00,183
So He said, "Alcohol is of no good.

273
00:32:00,463 --> 00:32:03,366
Should not touch alcohol
because it spoils your liver."

274
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,628
It spoils your awareness is the point.

275
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,850
It goes against your awareness.
He said, "Don't take alcohol."

276
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:15,799
But He didn't say don't take smoking.
He didn't know that

277
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,694
human beings are going to discover
more methods of destroying themselves,

278
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:21,678
that they will take to smoking.

279
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,344
Not that tobacco was not
there in those days.

280
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:26,523
It was there.

281
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:29,633
But he never said so clearly
that don't take to smoking

282
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,992
because He did not know
that people going to

283
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,865
take this insecticide for smoking.

284
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:45,230
They will be so stupid to spoil
their center of vishuddhi.

285
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:47,619
So He did not say it clearly,

286
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,819
neither He mentioned it I should say.

287
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,288
But when he found out that you
all the Muslims were smoking,

288
00:32:56,453 --> 00:33:00,418
He came back again as Guru Nanaka

289
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:05,290
and He prohibited and
He precisely said,

290
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:08,495
"Anything that gives you
intoxication should not be taken

291
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:10,781
and harms your body
should not be taken."

292
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:13,608
But smoking He said,
"Absolutely prohibited."

293
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:16,997
He had to correct Himself.

294
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:19,918
Because human beings are
such great adventurers

295
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:22,037
that every time

296
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:25,015
these great incarnations
had to come to tell them,

297
00:33:25,428 --> 00:33:27,777
"This is a mistake. You
go the other way."

298
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:30,506
Then you put them on the other way,
they will start moving that side.

299
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:33,109
Not that way now keep in the center.

300
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:35,809
Everybody has said,
"Keep in the center."

301
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,101
Keep in the center.

302
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,550
Because the ascent can only
take place in the center.

303
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:42,923
Keep in moderation life.

304
00:33:43,192 --> 00:33:48,692
Any kind of immoderation
takes you to trouble.

305
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:53,476
Extremes take you to trouble.

306
00:33:53,522 --> 00:33:56,318
You have seen now fanataism
where it has gone.

307
00:33:56,642 --> 00:34:00,641
Fanatics, what has happened to them?
Where are they going?

308
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,581
How they are behaving?

309
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:05,953
They are becoming cruel
people, killing others,

310
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:07,974
destroying other human beings.

311
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:11,268
Only the human beings
can do such a thing.

312
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,047
No other animal does this
en masse destruction.

313
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:18,478
This is a speciality of human beings,

314
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:21,828
which are the most
beautiful creation of God.

315
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:28,322
God has spent all His energy in
developing you into a human being.

316
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:32,691
You can see how beautifully He has
made within you all this thing.

317
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:36,412
And despite the fact you have been
always trying to destroy yourself,

318
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:38,802
how He is going to help you further.

319
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:43,405
How He cleanses you. How
He gives you the bliss.

320
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:46,712
You may deserve it or not.
Does not matter.

321
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,923
It happens to you and you get it.

322
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:52,468
This is what one has to realize.

323
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:56,283
The Divine is so gracious

324
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,593
and is so anxious to bestow upon you

325
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:03,834
the grace, the beauty, the love,

326
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,352
by forgiving everything
that you have done.

327
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,959
So the center that is above that

328
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:14,995
is the center what we
call as the heart center

329
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:21,025
or in sanskrit language
it is called as Anahata.

330
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,863
Anahata mean the sound
without permission.

331
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:29,785
In the heart you hear the
sound, lub tub, lub tub.

332
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:34,436
That is called as Anahat.

333
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:39,726
That sound, according to that sound,
this one is called as anahata.

334
00:35:40,695 --> 00:35:46,004
This center is placed in
the medula oblonguta,

335
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:52,990
along the spinal cord,
behind the sternum bone.

336
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:57,489
The beauty of these gurus is that
they don't know even the physiology,

337
00:35:57,593 --> 00:36:00,435
or anatomy or anything of human beings

338
00:36:00,466 --> 00:36:03,069
and they think they are God.
How can it be?

339
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:07,579
You should atleast know what is
inside the body of a human being.

340
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,566
Now in the sternum bone

341
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:16,507
till the age of 12 years

342
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:20,099
the antibodies are created

343
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:23,279
and the deity is called as Jagadamba,

344
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:27,173
meaning Mother of the Universe.

345
00:36:27,681 --> 00:36:29,502
She resides there.

346
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:34,508
On one side She protects Her bhaktas,

347
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:39,632
Her children,

348
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:41,988
Her true seekers,

349
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:46,657
to cross through this
ocean of illusion.

350
00:36:47,553 --> 00:36:49,941
We live in an ocean of illusion.

351
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:55,108
And on the other side
She creates within us

352
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:58,100
those antibodies who fight

353
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:02,782
all the other anti-God

354
00:37:03,775 --> 00:37:05,671
or anti-productive

355
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:07,941
or anti-life

356
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:10,211
agressions on us.

357
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:14,971
So these bodies are
created in this part

358
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:18,427
and they get distributed
all over the body

359
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:21,280
till the age of 12 years.

360
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:24,510
After 12 years of age

361
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,844
this portion is just a communicator.

362
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:33,191
So when you see some sort of
a horrible thing or a fear

363
00:37:33,223 --> 00:37:36,930
that comes into you, this
starts pulsating fast

364
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,115
and informs with that
frequency, without any doubts,

365
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,869
without any other method of
message, but through reflection,

366
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:49,210
the antibodies to fight

367
00:37:51,044 --> 00:37:56,530
the disease or any other
kind of aggression on them.

368
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:04,423
Now this special time

369
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:08,564
of an incarnation is alone, single.

370
00:38:10,392 --> 00:38:12,326
All other incarnations

371
00:38:12,437 --> 00:38:16,364
have been so far accompanied
by their powers.

372
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:22,799
But this one came on this earth
just to protect the seekers.

373
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,443
Just to remove them

374
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:31,887
from their hurdles and their
attacks into safer places

375
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,204
and give them the sense of security.

376
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,380
This is the center of the Mother.

377
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:42,385
On a subtler way you must understand

378
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,758
that it is very important

379
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:48,222
to respect the motherhood
in every place.

380
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:52,829
Woman is great, not because she
is an actress or a prostitute,

381
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,575
but because she is a mother.

382
00:38:56,845 --> 00:38:59,980
Every woman should aspire
to be a good mother.

383
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:03,386
That is what you are walking
in the path of God.

384
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,430
This motherhood when is challenged
in the lifetime of women,

385
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:13,113
say the husband doesn't
respect her motherhood.

386
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:15,646
He runs after other
women who are younger

387
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:17,943
or some sort of a thing
that way nowadays.

388
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:22,789
She may develop trouble of this center

389
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:26,638
and may develop a kind of a

390
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:31,912
disease like breast cancer
or any breast trouble.

391
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:35,617
If this center is put right,

392
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:40,571
breast cancer can be cured completely
without any operation or anything.

393
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:43,250
Sahaja yoga has done
that for many people

394
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:48,570
and we have saved many people from
going into horrible operations.

395
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:54,010
On the left hand side of this,
if you see, is another center.

396
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,486
is of you physical mother.

397
00:39:57,376 --> 00:40:01,367
The physical mother if she is
doing some anti-God activities

398
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:05,035
or if you have been

399
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:08,392
nasty to her for nothing at all

400
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:12,940
or any such relationship between
her and you is disturbed

401
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:16,218
or if she has died very early in life,

402
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,503
you have never felt the love
of the mother within you,

403
00:40:19,734 --> 00:40:25,138
you develop this center and such
people lack confidence in life.

404
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:27,564
They hang on to people.

405
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:32,176
They can be very irritable,

406
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:34,974
sometimes getting into tantrums

407
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:37,659
and can end up as lunatics also.

408
00:40:39,922 --> 00:40:41,850
Because the basic thing

409
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,009
is the security of a
mother in childhood

410
00:40:46,025 --> 00:40:48,247
and this is what the father has to see

411
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:51,342
that you give that
security to that mother

412
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:55,072
so that she looks after
her children very well.

413
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:59,001
But as a result of the insecurity,

414
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,953
the women have suffered
in the western countries.

415
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:04,628
They thought that money will
give them that security.

416
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:07,279
So they have made horrible laws

417
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,350
and these laws are responsible

418
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:15,182
for the irresponsible
behaviour of todays mothers.

419
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:18,722
She can never be happy
without a husband

420
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:21,841
and husband can never be
happy without a woman.

421
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,343
So why not have one who
loves you and be with her.

422
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:28,177
In the same why it
applys to the woman.

423
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:31,026
This kind of choice

424
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,074
which has started in the west.

425
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:36,542
After marriage also the choice is on,

426
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:38,526
in every thing they go on choosing.

427
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:41,605
It's a kind of an ego
trip one must know.

428
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:45,074
Like in America I found every

429
00:41:45,122 --> 00:41:48,097
tap has a different handle,
a different opening.

430
00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:50,216
You don't know where you
land up in that place

431
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,764
because you don't know
how to open the door.

432
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:55,988
You go into get locked into one
thing you don't know how to open.

433
00:41:56,015 --> 00:42:00,137
Even the doors of cars
are differently made.

434
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,604
The four doors could
also differently made,

435
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:04,810
because they think it is their choice.

436
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,226
In everything they say "I like it."
But what is this 'I' that likes it?

437
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:15,751
Why waste so much energy on these
things of choices? I can't understand.

438
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:19,936
Everytime there is a choice of this
going on, choice of that going on.

439
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,303
Such a headache it is.

440
00:42:21,435 --> 00:42:23,728
Why not settle down once for all.

441
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:28,850
At a certain age that finished. Now no
more choices. Done. Now lets enjoy it.

442
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:34,106
But if you go on choosing, choosing
all your life, you'll be like a

443
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:37,882
spinner going round
and round and round,

444
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:40,264
without getting anything out of it.

445
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:41,918
You must stop

446
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:44,652
and enjoy what you have.

447
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:48,546
There's no end to it.
It is a mad race.

448
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:53,200
I have seen people in England or
America, because now I'm living there.

449
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:58,454
They have truck loads of
things going out of the house

450
00:42:58,835 --> 00:43:00,987
and getting another
truck loads inside.

451
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:03,022
So i said, "Why? What's the problem?"

452
00:43:03,228 --> 00:43:05,794
"Now we don't like it, so
we've thrown it away."

453
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,484
"Why don't you like it?"

454
00:43:08,564 --> 00:43:11,742
"Because when we bought it we
were in a different temperment."

455
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:13,796
"Now in a different temperment."

456
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:15,783
The reason is,

457
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:19,756
we do not put our attention
to it, from a deeper side.

458
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:26,002
Even one chair made beautifully,
with good vibrations,

459
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:29,106
is better than a hundred chairs,

460
00:43:29,135 --> 00:43:32,394
which are going to become
plastic mountains later on.

461
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:36,073
So this is how we go on madly

462
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,915
possessing things more
and more and more

463
00:43:39,479 --> 00:43:43,288
and what is lost in that is
the absolute motherhood.

464
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,891
She has to worry so much about
all these plastic things

465
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:51,097
and not to worry about the special
thing that is the child in the family.

466
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:54,161
The child that has to have the love.

467
00:43:54,828 --> 00:43:57,113
The child which is to be cared for.

468
00:43:58,691 --> 00:44:04,021
I mean here till the age of 18 years if
they stay at home is a very big thing.

469
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:08,994
But in India, even they
become old 65 year old,

470
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:13,022
they won't leave their mother or father.
They stick on to the parents

471
00:44:13,534 --> 00:44:15,253
and they respect their parents.

472
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,522
They love them and the
parents also love them.

473
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:20,653
Because for them the
children are the highest.

474
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,965
Nothing is more important.

475
00:44:23,003 --> 00:44:26,255
All these worldly things are
of no importance at all.

476
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:31,224
Even if a child spoils say a carpet,
we say, "All right, it's auspicious."

477
00:44:31,884 --> 00:44:33,622
We can clean it.

478
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:38,346
So the main importance must
be given to the child.

479
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:40,422
But not to spoil them.

480
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:44,707
The way people handle the children
these days, is just spoiling them,

481
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:47,211
buy them expensive presents,

482
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:49,402
expensive toys.

483
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:52,865
They are busy with the
toys made of plastic.

484
00:44:54,982 --> 00:44:57,084
But why not talk to them?

485
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,965
Why not have friendship with them?

486
00:45:01,203 --> 00:45:02,898
Why not play with them?

487
00:45:02,944 --> 00:45:07,542
Why to have something in between?
Even if they are sitting together,

488
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,742
they will have a television,
a third thing going on.

489
00:45:09,982 --> 00:45:11,537
So there is no rapport.

490
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:14,037
How can we live like this?

491
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:16,441
If father and child

492
00:45:16,545 --> 00:45:18,957
and mother and child
can not have rapport,

493
00:45:19,577 --> 00:45:22,354
how can we have rapport
of the whole world?

494
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:25,830
How can we have connection
with the whole world?

495
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,767
So the motherhood must
take its responsibility,

496
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:33,605
must understand that you are
no more a bride, you a mother.

497
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,327
Be proud of it. It's
great to be mother.

498
00:45:37,525 --> 00:45:40,140
It's alright for a change
once to be a bride.

499
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:43,251
It's really great to be a mother

500
00:45:43,593 --> 00:45:46,747
and this is what is in this chakra.

501
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:51,275
If you are a confident mother,
this center is such a

502
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:56,084
great help, support,

503
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:58,933
gives you confidence all the time

504
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,425
and you can not

505
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:04,921
feel afraid of anything in this world,

506
00:46:04,944 --> 00:46:07,333
if you have that center
properly built up within you.

507
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:11,048
I know some of you are very
angry with your mothers

508
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:13,010
because they have been unkind to you.

509
00:46:13,035 --> 00:46:16,004
 Forgive them, forgive them,
because they are ignorant.

510
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,419
Because they have been
ignorant forgive them.

511
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:24,378
That's the only way you can live
happily, that by forgiving them.

512
00:46:24,405 --> 00:46:27,105
 And you'll be amazed, if you
forgive them they will come round.

513
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:30,177
It will all change once
you get your realization.

514
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:32,084
All relationship changes.

515
00:46:32,402 --> 00:46:35,679
In sahaja yoga all those who
have forsaken their parents,

516
00:46:35,974 --> 00:46:38,037
have forsaken their
mothers especially,

517
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:42,235
have gave got back their mothers and
mothers are also in the sahaja yoga

518
00:46:42,355 --> 00:46:45,433
and they are all enjoying together.
There's no age difference.

519
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,933
There's no adolesence
and this and that.

520
00:46:48,196 --> 00:46:51,737
Everyone enjoys together, speak
the same language of love.

521
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:59,703
It's such a beautiful
ocean of human beings,

522
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:04,457
as if connected by the same wave
of love that flows through them.

523
00:47:07,934 --> 00:47:12,632
Now on the right hand side you have
another center, center of the father.

524
00:47:14,591 --> 00:47:18,290
Father also is a very important thing

525
00:47:19,815 --> 00:47:24,433
and I think western fathers
are a bit too docile.

526
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,179
That's not a good thing.

527
00:47:28,534 --> 00:47:32,064
The father has not to be docile.
Mother has to be docile,

528
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:34,973
because she is a woman

529
00:47:35,973 --> 00:47:42,336
and a woman has to have her powers
so great, that she can bear so much.

530
00:47:42,437 --> 00:47:45,695
She is a powerful thing. She
is the shakti behind the man.

531
00:47:46,036 --> 00:47:50,100
Men are just like children. Because
you don't know how to handle them,

532
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,816
that's why it's all problems that you
want to have liberty and liberation.

533
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,463
You can't live without men.
Try anything.

534
00:47:57,989 --> 00:48:02,815
But not by dominating them or becoming
like that, but by becoming like women.

535
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:07,843
I would say, many people think
that Indian women are dominated,

536
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:10,177
but you see our Prime
Minister is a woman.

537
00:48:11,577 --> 00:48:13,481
Nobody can dominate us.

538
00:48:13,813 --> 00:48:15,632
We live with our values

539
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:18,561
and they can't live without us,

540
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:20,750
because they know how
substancial we are.

541
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,886
We have estabilished
that within their minds.

542
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:28,321
That's how you know that we have
very few divorces or anything.

543
00:48:28,512 --> 00:48:31,162
Woman is respected because
she is respectful.

544
00:48:31,504 --> 00:48:33,996
She will not be respected
because she has money.

545
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,035
She will not be respected
if she is dominating.

546
00:48:37,353 --> 00:48:41,162
She will not be respected if
she tries to have her own way.

547
00:48:41,909 --> 00:48:44,170
But she is respected
because she is respectful.

548
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:47,043
Her ways are such that
you have to respect her.

549
00:48:47,687 --> 00:48:49,515
You just can't help it.

550
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:53,570
You have to respect your woman and
that's what a woman has to be.

551
00:48:53,593 --> 00:48:57,369
She is much above man and she
should not try to stoop down

552
00:48:57,404 --> 00:48:59,967
to the level of men,
wearing pants and things.

553
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:02,296
I mean if anybody ask me to wear that,

554
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:04,698
I would say this sari is
the much better dress

555
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:07,852
for me because the sari gives

556
00:49:08,094 --> 00:49:10,179
food to thousands of Indians,

557
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:14,298
thousands of villagers,
they make the sari.

558
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,007
How can we forget that we are women?

559
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,292
Men are men and women are women.

560
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:23,681
Don't take these funny ideas.

561
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:27,792
You see you can't put your
nose here and your eyes here.

562
00:49:28,118 --> 00:49:31,634
They are placed at right places. God
has placed you in right places.

563
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:33,927
Now don't try to shift them.

564
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:35,578
That you can not do.

565
00:49:35,649 --> 00:49:39,928
In no way I would tell
you, you can be humiliated

566
00:49:40,006 --> 00:49:43,205
or subjugated, if you
establish your importance.

567
00:49:44,221 --> 00:49:48,903
If you estabilish it with proper
understanding, it is you who can bear.

568
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,347
You are like this mother earth around.

569
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:54,626
Mother earth gives us everything.
She bears up.

570
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,737
Can we do without the mother
earth, specially Australians?

571
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:01,943
She is the one who is giving
you all your ores, everything.

572
00:50:02,785 --> 00:50:05,626
You can't exist without her and
how much she is bearing up?

573
00:50:07,586 --> 00:50:10,491
So many things you have done against
God, but She is bearing it up.

574
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:12,746
Of course She'll become
volcanic one day,

575
00:50:12,786 --> 00:50:14,920
if you try to be too much like this.

576
00:50:15,158 --> 00:50:18,237
You have to take to God
because She is one with God.

577
00:50:19,094 --> 00:50:21,919
She is absolutely one
with God and She knows.

578
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:24,689
She forgives you because
God forgives you.

579
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:27,673
So we have to take the methods of God

580
00:50:27,721 --> 00:50:29,816
and not of our own ego

581
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:32,435
and of our own ideas. "What's wrong?"

582
00:50:34,571 --> 00:50:39,266
This Mother earth, as She bears us,
the woman has to bear all the family.

583
00:50:40,634 --> 00:50:43,364
In my own work as a mother,

584
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,080
I have seen people coming and
insulting me, misbehaving.

585
00:50:48,096 --> 00:50:50,943
All kinds of things they have done to me.
There is no end to it.

586
00:50:52,475 --> 00:50:56,467
But to me it's a joke.
They are all children.

587
00:50:57,372 --> 00:51:01,673
They are stupid. They are foolish.
They'll be alright.

588
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:06,451
I don't loose my temper.
I'm unruffled.

589
00:51:07,404 --> 00:51:10,322
One lady one came with a
bible to hit me hard.

590
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:15,951
In a temple and they have taken my
tv and I'm just laughing at her.

591
00:51:15,983 --> 00:51:18,514
I couldn't understand how could
she use a bible to hit me?

592
00:51:18,554 --> 00:51:21,681
Something else she could have had.

593
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:26,665
But it is so. It's so
surprising you see

594
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,943
that how people are in a paradox

595
00:51:30,118 --> 00:51:31,943
and such a confusion.

596
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:34,935
A complete confusion exists now.

597
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:39,292
Only way to get rid of it
is to become your Spirit.

598
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:41,879
Because Spirit is absolute.

599
00:51:42,022 --> 00:51:45,371
It is absolutely there within you,

600
00:51:45,412 --> 00:51:47,943
which is the absolute.
It's not relative.

601
00:51:48,277 --> 00:51:50,308
We live in a relative world.

602
00:51:51,054 --> 00:51:53,284
We haven't got our absolute values.

603
00:51:53,959 --> 00:51:58,840
But Spirit when it manifests you start
feeling these vibrations of cool breeze.

604
00:51:58,919 --> 00:52:02,267
All over you start feeling
this all pervading power.

605
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:04,268
And you ask any absolute question

606
00:52:04,324 --> 00:52:06,554
and you get an absolute answer to it,

607
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,109
an absolute answer to it.

608
00:52:09,285 --> 00:52:11,292
Because what ever you are doing

609
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:14,419
you are doing in a relative way.

610
00:52:14,586 --> 00:52:19,684
Because you are harmed, because you
are supressed, you have a reaction.

611
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,038
Because that thing has happened to
you, that's why there is a reaction.

612
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:26,012
Reaction is not the
way we have to live.

613
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:28,964
We have to live on our absolute wealth

614
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:33,043
and that is the Spirit within us,
which has to come in our attention.

615
00:52:33,106 --> 00:52:37,110
Means, it has to manifest in
our central nervous system.

616
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,114
Now beyond that is the center here.

617
00:52:41,218 --> 00:52:43,297
So about fathers I have to say

618
00:52:43,385 --> 00:52:46,503
that fathers have to be very
kind to their children.

619
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:50,194
They are not to shout at women.
They have to respect.

620
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:53,519
They must respect because she
is the goddess of the family.

621
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,273
If they respect her there
won't be any problem.

622
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:58,082
I can tell you this much.

623
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:02,582
If you don't know how to respect
your women, they can become shrews.

624
00:53:03,501 --> 00:53:05,540
They can become horrid things.

625
00:53:05,588 --> 00:53:08,790
You see you make them what ever
you want to do, you make them.

626
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,509
Whatever your ideas, if you run after
prostitutes, they'll become prostitutes.

627
00:53:13,154 --> 00:53:16,440
If you run after another men,
they willl run after another men.

628
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:18,948
If you run after money,
they'll run after money.

629
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,717
What ever you do, they will do.

630
00:53:21,075 --> 00:53:23,495
So it is the men who
spoil the society.

631
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:27,233
But the women must have their courage

632
00:53:27,845 --> 00:53:32,321
to stand up to it, because for the
society the women are responsible.

633
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,463
If children are the
most important thing,

634
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:39,186
then for a mother the society
is the most important thing

635
00:53:39,265 --> 00:53:43,440
and she keeps up the society
in a proper method by

636
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:47,979
educating her children to be
good citizens of that society.

637
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,162
But if your father is a cruel man,

638
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:56,709
or if you have lost your
father in your childhood,

639
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:01,491
or maybe there is some problem
between you and your father,

640
00:54:01,563 --> 00:54:03,773
 or if you have been
a very bad father,

641
00:54:04,393 --> 00:54:08,852
or the children are tortured by you,

642
00:54:09,638 --> 00:54:13,878
or you have lost some child early,

643
00:54:13,995 --> 00:54:18,598
all these things the principle
of father gets into problem.

644
00:54:19,004 --> 00:54:20,955
And when this is in problem

645
00:54:21,546 --> 00:54:24,982
you get asthma.

646
00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:28,227
Asthma comes because of this.

647
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:30,894
Asthma can be easily cured,

648
00:54:31,265 --> 00:54:33,368
if you can assure the fatherhood

649
00:54:33,506 --> 00:54:37,928
to be settled down through the
vibrations, asthma can be cured.

650
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:41,372
 I have cured an asthma of
the governer of Kashmir,

651
00:54:41,464 --> 00:54:45,562
 who was suffering from 25
years, within 10 minutes time.

652
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:49,030
It is very easy to cure
asthma, which can cured.

653
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:55,069
Because the compassion that people talk
of, love, love, love, it doesn't work.

654
00:54:56,607 --> 00:54:59,996
God's compassion works. It works.

655
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:02,562
It doesn't talk about itself

656
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:05,542
that" I am love, I am
compassion", nothing of the kind.

657
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:11,020
It just works. You can feel it.
It works because it redeems you,

658
00:55:15,298 --> 00:55:16,980
gives you salvation,

659
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,694
gives you realization,

660
00:55:19,052 --> 00:55:21,051
gives you all that is the best.

661
00:55:21,377 --> 00:55:25,026
It is the benefitial force which acts

662
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:29,269
and you see it every moment and you
are amazed how you are looked after

663
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:32,051
by this great force of compassion.

664
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:36,107
Sometimes you feel as if the
angels are taking you up somewhere

665
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,512
and you are avoiding all
the hurdles of life.

666
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:41,448
It's so amazing if you
talk to sahaj yogis,

667
00:55:41,584 --> 00:55:45,567
you will think these people are
talking something imaginary.

668
00:55:45,623 --> 00:55:47,734
But it's a fact. It's a fact.

669
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:51,440
But to establish yourself into
sahaja yoga is difficult,

670
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:55,363
because we have no outer
ways of doing it.

671
00:55:55,387 --> 00:55:58,099
Like we can not say
you pay your money,

672
00:55:58,219 --> 00:55:59,845
or you become your member,

673
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:02,567
or we can say that all
right now supposing

674
00:56:02,607 --> 00:56:05,631
you all to become a
sahaja yogi we give you a

675
00:56:05,711 --> 00:56:08,758
plate here or plaque here
and all that, not possible.

676
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:11,789
You have to actually become, inside.

677
00:56:12,076 --> 00:56:13,726
There's no hipocracy about it.

678
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,408
You have to be inside. There's
no pronouncemnt about it.

679
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:22,845
It has to be inside,
something has to happen.

680
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:25,655
You have to be transformed actually.

681
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:29,218
Has to be honestly done.

682
00:56:29,282 --> 00:56:31,480
It should be a truth

683
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:34,543
and not a myth, with
which you have to live.

684
00:56:36,972 --> 00:56:39,533
So we have another center
which is very important,

685
00:56:39,558 --> 00:56:41,184
 is called as the vishuddhi chakra.

686
00:56:42,576 --> 00:56:48,240
This is the center presided
by Shri Krishna himself.

687
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:52,455
Shri Krishna actually first manifests

688
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:54,709
at the solar plexis

689
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:56,647
as Shri Vishnu.

690
00:56:57,828 --> 00:57:00,891
The power of Vishnu is
Laxshmi at that point.

691
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:05,232
Laxshmi is the power by which

692
00:57:06,225 --> 00:57:09,629
people get the blessings
of the Goddess,

693
00:57:10,431 --> 00:57:11,867
on material level,

694
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:14,415
but not the way we understand it.

695
00:57:15,487 --> 00:57:18,375
Laxshmi is a Godess because She
is a woman, She is a mother.

696
00:57:18,447 --> 00:57:21,875
First of all a man who is
wealthy has to be motherly.

697
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:23,661
That you don't find anywhere.

698
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:28,784
Then there are the image
is made so beautifully

699
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:30,836
that in the hands there
are two lotuses.

700
00:57:31,669 --> 00:57:33,338
They are pink in colour.

701
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:36,495
The pink colour suggests the love.

702
00:57:37,694 --> 00:57:40,749
The house should be cozy like a lotus.

703
00:57:41,511 --> 00:57:45,312
And there's a very, I don't
know what you call it,

704
00:57:45,543 --> 00:57:48,400
gnat or something, you
call it a gnat,I think,

705
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:51,463
that horrible insect

706
00:57:51,495 --> 00:57:55,082
gnat like think that has got
lots of thorns on its body,

707
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:57,487
also enters into this

708
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:01,003
delicate lotus,

709
00:58:01,926 --> 00:58:03,830
but it has a place to rest.

710
00:58:05,037 --> 00:58:08,219
It does not judge

711
00:58:08,457 --> 00:58:11,124
the outward thing of a person.

712
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:15,806
So it has to be a cozy
place, a welcome place,

713
00:58:16,395 --> 00:58:19,553
where people should
enter and be happy.

714
00:58:20,823 --> 00:58:23,228
That is called as a laxshmi pati,

715
00:58:23,284 --> 00:58:26,902
the one who is rich, in the sense
he is the owner of laxshmi.

716
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,474
Then one hand is like this
another hand is like that.

717
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:33,831
The hand like this
means he is the giver.

718
00:58:33,966 --> 00:58:36,640
He has to be extremely generous.

719
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:40,196
All the time flowing, the generosity.

720
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,752
Generosity not to
wrong type of people,

721
00:58:45,117 --> 00:58:47,037
but to the people who are needy.

722
00:58:47,696 --> 00:58:50,394
But he doesn't say that I am giving.

723
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:53,878
He doesn't talk about it.
He just does it secretly.

724
00:58:54,554 --> 00:58:56,220
And this hand like this

725
00:58:56,927 --> 00:58:59,505
is the hand for protection.

726
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:01,061
Protection to the weak.

727
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:04,498
Protection to people who
do not have so much.

728
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:09,013
This is the sign of a
laxshmi pati, a rich man.

729
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:11,823
And she stands on the lotus,

730
00:59:12,363 --> 00:59:16,577
means she doesn' t exsert
her pressure on anyone.

731
00:59:17,363 --> 00:59:19,839
She doesn't exsert pressure on anyone.

732
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,117
Is a very beautiful image mande

733
00:59:23,141 --> 00:59:25,168
of the power of Shri Vishnu,

734
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:29,934
who is the aspect of God
which gives us our evolution,

735
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:32,442
The force which gives
us our evolution.

736
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:37,196
The force by which, that aspect by
which, we have become human beings.

737
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:41,259
This is the whole thing is called
as the power of Mahalaxshmi.

738
00:59:41,673 --> 00:59:48,097
And Christ's Mother was the incarnation
of this Mahalaxshmi, of the great.

739
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:51,561
 Mahalaxshmi represents

740
00:59:54,189 --> 00:59:55,442
the seeking,

741
00:59:56,895 --> 00:59:58,585
the power of seeking,

742
00:59:59,379 --> 01:00:01,299
of highest goal,

743
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:05,394
seeking of God,

744
01:00:06,252 --> 01:00:09,212
seeking of your spiritual ascent.

745
01:00:09,942 --> 01:00:12,196
She was representing that.

746
01:00:13,022 --> 01:00:14,442
And that's how

747
01:00:14,998 --> 01:00:16,371
She came on this earth.

748
01:00:17,435 --> 01:00:19,299
She was to an Indian

749
01:00:19,371 --> 01:00:21,577
people she was told that She was

750
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,577
Mahalaxshmi they can't believe it.

751
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:27,886
They She was crying all the
while, how was She a Mahalaxshmi?

752
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,410
To them it doesn't go into their heads

753
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:33,688
that how can a person who
is a Mahalaxshmi could be

754
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:35,767
 just a mother crying for her son.

755
01:00:37,196 --> 01:00:41,799
 but why she was not she exposed
us, Warren has told you.

756
01:00:42,085 --> 01:00:45,244
that if Christ has mentioned that

757
01:00:45,292 --> 01:00:48,664
She is Mahalaxshmi, the Adi
Shakti, or the Holy Ghost

758
01:00:48,752 --> 01:00:50,783
 people would have attacked Her first,

759
01:00:51,355 --> 01:00:53,140
instead of attacking Him

760
01:00:53,935 --> 01:00:55,601
and that was not the game

761
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:59,901
The drama was for Christ
to get Himself crusified.

762
01:00:59,953 --> 01:01:04,663
And why Christ ? Because Christ
is the embodiment of the Spirit.

763
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:08,386
He's made of these vibrations

764
01:01:08,593 --> 01:01:11,926
He's Omkara. He's without body.
He's a bodiless person.

765
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:14,648
It's only He who could do it.

766
01:01:15,183 --> 01:01:18,942
Nobody, no other
incarnation is like that.

767
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:21,950
All other incarnations
come on this earth,

768
01:01:22,204 --> 01:01:24,069
they have to have a body.

769
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:26,672
But He was made specially.

770
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:32,783
The body was taken down. It's a big
story, which I'll tell you later on.

771
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:36,350
But the part that was the
Spirit Christ was made,

772
01:01:36,469 --> 01:01:40,545
because the message was
resurrection and not crucifixion.

773
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:45,820
Resurrection means He passed
through this cross here.

774
01:01:45,963 --> 01:01:51,894
You see the agnya is between the
ego and superego overlapping

775
01:01:52,022 --> 01:01:55,654
and when we have a very thick
conditioning and a thick ego,

776
01:01:55,718 --> 01:01:57,836
just there is no space at all.

777
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,212
And it is He who came and
established Himself there,

778
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:04,878
in that little space, because

779
01:02:05,831 --> 01:02:08,275
He is chaitanya,

780
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:14,906
he is this subtle power omkara.

781
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:22,708
It's all described. What ever I'm
telling you is not my story.

782
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:25,136
It's all described about Him.

783
01:02:25,232 --> 01:02:28,129
Unfortunately you people
have not read these books.

784
01:02:28,383 --> 01:02:32,224
But you can later on after
realization get to these books

785
01:02:32,288 --> 01:02:35,192
and understand what I'm
telling is true or not.

786
01:02:36,113 --> 01:02:39,748
If you have to depend on books, but
if you have to depend on vibrations

787
01:02:39,947 --> 01:02:42,843
you can ask the question,
'Was He Omkara?'

788
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,367
So He crosses over

789
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:50,335
into the limbic area.

790
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:58,263
Here, which is the kingdom of God and
that is why He's called as the gate.

791
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:04,533
But Vishuddhi chakra is the one which
is bestoyed upon by Shri Krishna,

792
01:03:04,978 --> 01:03:07,660
who is actually the

793
01:03:08,113 --> 01:03:11,898
evolved manifestation of Shri Vishnu.

794
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:15,589
The story of Shri
Vishnu's incarnations

795
01:03:15,732 --> 01:03:18,089
suggest that we have gone

796
01:03:18,185 --> 01:03:22,375
through different, various
aspects of evolution.

797
01:03:22,796 --> 01:03:25,763
If Christ has not
talked about evolution,

798
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:28,041
that doesn't mean He did not know it.

799
01:03:28,343 --> 01:03:30,660
People never gave Him
any chance to talk.

800
01:03:30,748 --> 01:03:34,351
Even Darwin had no
business to criticize Him.

801
01:03:35,177 --> 01:03:38,748
He Himself has said, "We have come
so far we have to go further"

802
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:42,009
and Christ also said, "You
have to be born again".

803
01:03:42,642 --> 01:03:46,245
Christ also said the same thing in
His own words, in His own style.

804
01:03:47,285 --> 01:03:49,753
In evolutionary process is described,

805
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:52,446
in the dashavatars, in
the 10 incarnations,

806
01:03:52,482 --> 01:03:54,777
which is exactly the
same as has happened.

807
01:03:55,515 --> 01:03:56,991
First is the fish

808
01:03:57,555 --> 01:04:00,443
and then is the turtoise.

809
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,832
I know Indian names so I.

810
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:05,570
Then is the quadruped

811
01:04:05,602 --> 01:04:08,054
Like that it moves
from one to another.

812
01:04:08,126 --> 01:04:09,864
Then a small man

813
01:04:10,237 --> 01:04:14,022
and then a large man
and then Shri Rama.

814
01:04:14,325 --> 01:04:18,149
Shri Rama resides on the right side, as
the father, right side of the heart.

815
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:24,507
So now Vishuddhi chakra
is Shri Krishna's one.

816
01:04:24,801 --> 01:04:29,269
He came 2000 years
after Shri Rama came.

817
01:04:30,118 --> 01:04:34,245
Like Treta and Dvapara, we have two
yugas out of which he came here.

818
01:04:34,356 --> 01:04:36,872
There are many people who
say they are Shri Krishna

819
01:04:36,904 --> 01:04:40,149
and they don't know any thing about Him.
They don't know anything

820
01:04:41,761 --> 01:04:43,872
and to the ninth people.

821
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:47,665
They can't understand that how
this man is Shri Krishna.

822
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:52,206
It's very easy to say I'm Christ,
you see the other day in London,

823
01:04:52,249 --> 01:04:54,237
somebody told me, "Mother
he is saying I'm Christ".

824
01:04:54,293 --> 01:04:57,340
"All right," I said, "you ask
him to walk on the water".

825
01:04:57,507 --> 01:05:01,340
That's the sign. Find out.
It's very easy.

826
01:05:01,515 --> 01:05:05,530
If I say I'm Adi Shakti or Holy
Ghost let me give you realization.

827
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:09,268
That's the sign given that She raises
the kundalini of thousands of people.

828
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,935
It's described already.

829
01:05:12,785 --> 01:05:14,792
But if he said he was Christ,

830
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:17,294
then let him walk on the
water you will say

831
01:05:18,888 --> 01:05:23,065
and the one who says he is Shri
Krishna he has samhara shakti.

832
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:26,311
So many, there are so many thing
by which you can make it out

833
01:05:26,362 --> 01:05:30,308
a person who describe
themselves as this and that.

834
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:37,649
So now we have come to this
Vishuddhi chakra which 16 petals

835
01:05:38,785 --> 01:05:40,594
and these 16 petals

836
01:05:42,182 --> 01:05:45,569
represent 16 sub-plexuses

837
01:05:45,705 --> 01:05:47,483
of the cervical plexus.

838
01:05:47,689 --> 01:05:50,181
Now these are all gross
plexuses outside,

839
01:05:50,451 --> 01:05:52,832
but in the subtle it
is Vishuddhi chakra,

840
01:05:52,936 --> 01:05:57,522
with all the vowels, the 16
vowels as the bija matras in it.

841
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:03,172
This is the most important
center for human beings

842
01:06:03,196 --> 01:06:05,744
 because when human
beings raised their head

843
01:06:06,324 --> 01:06:10,157
this center started becoming
complete by itself.

844
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:16,245
By raising it only we have
created this ego business.

845
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:19,406
Because we raised our head

846
01:06:21,951 --> 01:06:25,657
we actually symbolized
it with our freedom.

847
01:06:27,522 --> 01:06:29,442
This I-ness develops.

848
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,824
As this ego develops within us,

849
01:06:33,594 --> 01:06:37,252
the ego and super ego both meet
at the fontanelle bone area.

850
01:06:37,405 --> 01:06:39,310
By about 12 years of age

851
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,507
it becomes absolutely calcified

852
01:06:41,673 --> 01:06:43,601
and we develop our I-ness.

853
01:06:44,396 --> 01:06:48,054
Before this we are under the
complete control of the nature

854
01:06:48,562 --> 01:06:52,157
that's far as animals
are called as pashu.

855
01:06:52,499 --> 01:06:54,364
Pashu means the pa shakti,

856
01:06:54,459 --> 01:06:57,229
the control of God, control of nature.

857
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,887
But human beings have
been given freedom

858
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:03,245
and individuality to grow.

859
01:07:03,816 --> 01:07:06,530
Because if you have to go
to the supreme freedom

860
01:07:07,134 --> 01:07:09,419
you have to know what freedom is

861
01:07:10,062 --> 01:07:13,736
and in that freedom, of course it
could have been short circuited also

862
01:07:13,824 --> 01:07:17,237
if Adam and Eve had listened
to God, but they did not.

863
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:22,395
They just wanted to find out for
themselves when the freedom was given

864
01:07:22,475 --> 01:07:26,610
and the mistake was carried on to this
extent that the incarnations had to come

865
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:28,991
to correct it and it was
such a long process.

866
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:32,022
And now it has come to this position

867
01:07:32,062 --> 01:07:34,403
that to achieve that supreme freedom

868
01:07:34,459 --> 01:07:38,062
you must learn to use
your freedom properly.

869
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:40,538
This is trial and error man tries.

870
01:07:40,705 --> 01:07:42,784
I have seen many people.

871
01:07:43,428 --> 01:07:46,268
I went to Tehran once.

872
01:07:46,578 --> 01:07:49,586
I saw many Muslims sitting before me

873
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:52,095
and I thought and they looked

874
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:55,155
like brahmins of India,

875
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:56,935
who were another fanatic group.

876
01:07:57,523 --> 01:08:00,819
They are not brahmins because
they say they are brahmins.

877
01:08:00,852 --> 01:08:02,478
They don't know anything of Brahma.

878
01:08:03,055 --> 01:08:06,760
So they looked exactly like those
brahmins in their past lives.

879
01:08:06,912 --> 01:08:12,554
That means these extreme people from India
are born as muslims to hate themselves

880
01:08:13,158 --> 01:08:17,689
and this extreme movement goes on like
a pendulum from one to another end

881
01:08:17,959 --> 01:08:22,312
till you come to a point where you
understand that fanaticism is wrong.

882
01:08:22,328 --> 01:08:23,757
This extreme behaviour is wrong.

883
01:08:23,845 --> 01:08:27,670
This why do I do it to such an extent?
Can I not come to moderation?

884
01:08:27,741 --> 01:08:32,194
and the family system is one of
them which makes you understand

885
01:08:32,416 --> 01:08:35,049
that balance in life is very good,

886
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:37,938
without the balance and moderation

887
01:08:38,311 --> 01:08:40,549
you can not have proper
growth or proper children.

888
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:43,513
A day will come if
you go on like this,

889
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,548
you will have children
who'll be just devils.

890
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:48,938
I have seen children in England
some of them are really devils.

891
01:08:49,183 --> 01:08:50,553
Absolutely devilish,

892
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:56,673
some children kill their grandmother and
grandfather rocking her and his chairs.

893
01:08:56,689 --> 01:08:57,705
Can you believe it such a thing.

894
01:08:57,745 --> 01:09:01,001
Only six, seven year old children.
Devils actually.

895
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:06,808
Six, seven years old children they kill
their grandmother and grandfather like that

896
01:09:07,153 --> 01:09:09,557
and in England it is said that

897
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:12,469
two children are killed
every week by the parents.

898
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:14,462
I mean this is devilish.

899
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:16,914
Even the devils don't do that I think.

900
01:09:17,748 --> 01:09:21,359
It is done by human beings and
how can children be born there?

901
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:25,574
What child would like to be born in a
country where there is no love for them?

902
01:09:25,702 --> 01:09:29,051
Perhaps that's why India is suffering
so much with over population.

903
01:09:29,805 --> 01:09:32,749
All the children must be wanting
to be born in our country,

904
01:09:32,884 --> 01:09:36,328
and also your children who are seeking
God are coming to our country.

905
01:09:36,388 --> 01:09:39,995
Of course they fall atrap. They fall
into wrong traps. It's all right.

906
01:09:40,321 --> 01:09:42,146
But they are seeking.

907
01:09:43,361 --> 01:09:46,249
They are seekers and that's
why they are going to India

908
01:09:46,392 --> 01:09:49,138
and in India you can seek it better.

909
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,281
Because that's a country
of love and affection.

910
01:09:52,456 --> 01:09:56,154
But these people do no come in
contact with any Indians at all.

911
01:09:56,170 --> 01:10:00,238
Because Indians don't like these gurus at all.
They have nothing to do with these Indians.

912
01:10:02,535 --> 01:10:04,828
They are hated by all the Indians.

913
01:10:05,432 --> 01:10:07,352
They think they are inauspicious.

914
01:10:07,654 --> 01:10:09,725
Where ever they stay there is fire.

915
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:12,233
Where ever they stay
there is bad time.

916
01:10:12,262 --> 01:10:16,477
No one likes except for business people
who try to make money out of these.

917
01:10:18,128 --> 01:10:19,805
Indians have no rapport.

918
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:22,408
But you should ask sahaj
yogis, they go to villages.

919
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:26,000
How they mix up with Indian. How they talk
to them. How they have lived with them.

920
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:27,692
They live with them in their huts.

921
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:33,366
We live with them with their beautiful
generousity that they have.

922
01:10:35,096 --> 01:10:39,064
So Vishuddhi chakra, which is
the chakra of Shri Krishna,

923
01:10:39,684 --> 01:10:44,318
is to be understood that ultimately
this becomes the Virat, the primordial.

924
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:48,445
So the heart,

925
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:54,191
which is the reflexion
of the God Almighty,

926
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:57,881
has three aspects, as I told you.

927
01:10:58,461 --> 01:11:01,135
The first aspect is of existence,

928
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:04,239
which is expressed in the left side

929
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:08,818
power of existence and when existence
finishes also it is destruction.

930
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:14,079
So it is called as the giver of
existence, as well as destroyer.

931
01:11:14,707 --> 01:11:18,160
The another one, on the right
hand side, is the creator

932
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:23,200
and the center one is one
who gives you evolution

933
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:29,109
and one who gives you evolution
becomes ultimately 16 petals.

934
01:11:29,173 --> 01:11:34,163
It starts from the 10 becomes 16
petals and becomes Shri Krishna here.

935
01:11:36,757 --> 01:11:39,232
Now there are people who
are standing the streets

936
01:11:39,256 --> 01:11:40,756
singing 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna.'

937
01:11:40,786 --> 01:11:42,435
I really feel so ashame of them.

938
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:50,459
Imagine the people who worship
Krishna as their God should beg.

939
01:11:50,546 --> 01:11:52,418
It's something I just
can't understand.

940
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:55,453
Is impossible for me to see.

941
01:11:56,414 --> 01:12:02,432
Krishna's friend was a very
poor man called Sudama.

942
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:07,317
In childhood they used to study
together in a school of a guru

943
01:12:08,373 --> 01:12:12,087
and when he became the king
Sudama went to see him

944
01:12:12,682 --> 01:12:18,952
and he just sent a message that go and tell
Shri Krishna that I'm his friend Sudama.

945
01:12:19,007 --> 01:12:20,776
So everybody laughed at him.

946
01:12:21,135 --> 01:12:24,222
But he said no please tell
him, He will recognize me,

947
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:30,111
and Sudama didn't know what to take.
So he had taken a little bit of rice,

948
01:12:30,864 --> 01:12:32,555
a kind of a rice we get,

949
01:12:33,452 --> 01:12:35,984
pounded rice, with him to
give it to shri Krishna.

950
01:12:38,286 --> 01:12:41,357
When Shri Krishna heard
that Sudama has come

951
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,134
He started shouting and roaring,

952
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,730
so happy and joyous saying, "Oh
my great friend has come."

953
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:52,682
He came down from his throne and
he ran to the door and he just

954
01:12:53,183 --> 01:12:57,630
took him in His heart and said, "Oh
my great friend you have come."

955
01:12:58,024 --> 01:13:01,388
"I'm so much happy that you have
remembered me and have come."

956
01:13:01,802 --> 01:13:04,571
He brought him in, made
him sit in His throne.

957
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,326
He was so embarassed. He
you'll sleep on my bed.

958
01:13:08,358 --> 01:13:10,420
I'm going to sleep near you here.

959
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,746
He asked his all queens
to look after him,

960
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:15,119
all the maids to look after him,

961
01:13:15,175 --> 01:13:17,960
all the men to give
everything that he wanted.

962
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:22,095
Then he dressed him up very well. He said,
"You are my friend. You are my king."

963
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:26,642
He took him on his chariot
carried him along.

964
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:29,991
and on the chariot they were throwing.

965
01:13:30,029 --> 01:13:32,641
In their custom in India
is to take the bad eye

966
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:35,554
you have to throw some
coins or some pearls.

967
01:13:35,673 --> 01:13:40,403
They were thowing pearls and
diamonds and rubies on his chariot.

968
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:44,959
And Sudama was saying, "Let
one fall into my lap also,"

969
01:13:46,071 --> 01:13:48,777
in a very sweet way,

970
01:13:49,516 --> 01:13:55,583
and then Sudama just
came back to his family

971
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,511
and he found his family was not there.

972
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:00,566
He said, "Where is my family gone?"

973
01:14:00,643 --> 01:14:03,198
They said, "They have moved
to that another house."

974
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:08,055
He saw a huge big house made
of gold and beautiful things.

975
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:09,512
He said, "This is not my house."

976
01:14:09,532 --> 01:14:12,055
They said, "This your house
where you have to go."

977
01:14:12,116 --> 01:14:13,727
So he went there,

978
01:14:13,775 --> 01:14:17,230
and he saw his wife, his children

979
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:22,055
given with all comforts of life,
all the beauties of life.

980
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:25,730
Krishna has said,"
Yoga Kshem vahamyam."

981
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:30,277
You should come to yoga first,
then I give you the well being.

982
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:33,857
First come to you. First
receive your realization.

983
01:14:33,905 --> 01:14:37,190
First yoga and then
kshema, not kshema yoga.

984
01:14:38,214 --> 01:14:40,222
Look at that and look at this.

985
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:46,332
Any Indian who knows feels
ashamed. But they beg so much.

986
01:14:46,577 --> 01:14:51,023
You see they go in the South
Hall and beg all the time.

987
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,976
So the Indians are quite rich in England.
They give them money.

988
01:14:54,106 --> 01:14:56,559
They can't bare to see this
begging in the name of Krishna.

989
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,455
 Just to get rid of it.

990
01:14:58,484 --> 01:15:00,722
But every Saturday they are there.

991
01:15:01,571 --> 01:15:04,166
Because Saturday there is
crowd they are there begging.

992
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:08,858
Even on Oxford circus they are
standing there and begging.

993
01:15:08,874 --> 01:15:10,428
 Such a shameful thing.

994
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:16,120
As Krishna's disciple you have to
have self-esteem, self-respect.

995
01:15:16,168 --> 01:15:18,007
Beggars can not have that.

996
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:20,404
Begging is not the way
a yogi should behave.

997
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:25,039
He has to have self
respect and self esteem.

998
01:15:25,102 --> 01:15:27,412
Otherwise who is going
to respect a beggar.

999
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,341
Apart from that when you
go on saying these mantras

1000
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:36,964
from this throat of yours which
is not been yet initiated,

1001
01:15:37,043 --> 01:15:40,882
in the sense the Kundalini
has not crossed this chakra,

1002
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:45,834
then you develop troubles of this throat
maybe cancer also of this throat.

1003
01:15:45,873 --> 01:15:49,882
I have got three people coming from there.
They all had cancer of the throat.

1004
01:15:51,722 --> 01:15:53,587
So it is a very wretched condition.

1005
01:15:54,706 --> 01:15:57,793
There is no need for you to say,

1006
01:15:57,817 --> 01:16:00,060
"I should live like this. I
should discipline myself."

1007
01:16:00,092 --> 01:16:03,087
"I should go to that extent
that I just destroy myself."

1008
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,230
It should be in the center.

1009
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:07,666
You should not do something too much

1010
01:16:07,698 --> 01:16:09,888
to destroy yourself by indulgences

1011
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:14,752
and you should not do any
kind of a cruelty to youself.

1012
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,406
Also that is destruction.

1013
01:16:16,515 --> 01:16:18,525
Try to be in the center.

1014
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:22,366
Again I say, as Buddha has said,
that you be in the center.

1015
01:16:23,151 --> 01:16:28,452
Now today, I have described to you
all these centers in very short.

1016
01:16:28,944 --> 01:16:31,412
I have given lectures on every center

1017
01:16:31,897 --> 01:16:34,936
and there are thousands
and more lectures

1018
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,706
with the ashram people here.

1019
01:16:38,429 --> 01:16:43,166
When you get your realization
then you can hear them very well

1020
01:16:43,738 --> 01:16:47,059
and you can understand what
I am saying about these

1021
01:16:47,071 --> 01:16:50,515
chakras is true or not, which
you can verify yourself.

1022
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:55,404
But today in short I have told
you about these three chakras

1023
01:16:55,944 --> 01:17:00,968
and tomorrow I hope to tell you
something about realization,

1024
01:17:01,286 --> 01:17:04,547
spirit, and what after realization.

1025
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,849
Now you why we are putting our
feel on the Mother earth,

1026
01:18:27,856 --> 01:18:30,785
 but keep them separately
because these are two powers.

1027
01:18:30,937 --> 01:18:33,087
So keep them separately.

1028
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:36,151
Put your left hand towards me

1029
01:18:40,093 --> 01:18:43,759
and the right hand also towards
me, for the time being.

1030
01:18:44,132 --> 01:18:48,227
But then we have use the
right hand for the action

1031
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:51,243
of raising our kundalini
on the left hand side.

1032
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:55,219
As I told you the left hand
is the power of desire.

1033
01:18:55,402 --> 01:19:00,560
So first there should be a desire
to ascend, to be the Spirit.

1034
01:19:02,434 --> 01:19:05,910
Put your left hand towards me.
You should not be adament.

1035
01:19:06,029 --> 01:19:09,457
Just let it go. It will
work out for all fo you.

1036
01:19:10,236 --> 01:19:13,830
If it doesn't work out then
there is something wrong.

1037
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:16,932
Maybe your principle of Guru is wrong,

1038
01:19:16,963 --> 01:19:21,703
or maybe you have got some
problems with your physical side,

1039
01:19:22,093 --> 01:19:24,892
or maybe some emotional
problems are there.

1040
01:19:24,931 --> 01:19:27,885
Anything like that can be corrected.

1041
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:30,401
Everybody will get realization.

1042
01:19:30,426 --> 01:19:33,746
And nobody should get
anxious about it.

1043
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:35,477
There should be no anxiety.

1044
01:19:35,493 --> 01:19:39,330
 With all cheerfullness you must
sit with your left hand towards me

1045
01:19:39,386 --> 01:19:43,919
and right hand little easy easy
so we can move it later on.

1046
01:19:43,974 --> 01:19:46,394
But just now put both
the hands on your lap

1047
01:19:47,609 --> 01:19:49,299
and close your eyes.

1048
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:51,799
Please close your eyes.

1049
01:19:53,675 --> 01:19:56,261
Please take out your malas
and things like that.

1050
01:19:56,378 --> 01:19:58,808
You see that work out.
Vishuddhi it won't work out.

1051
01:19:58,832 --> 01:20:00,435
So please take them out
if you don't mind.

1052
01:20:00,482 --> 01:20:03,275
If you want to have your realization,
please take out your malas.

1053
01:20:04,251 --> 01:20:09,330
Please help yourself a little bit.
Please listen to me take out your malas.

1054
01:20:10,424 --> 01:20:14,560
Because we want to achieve it for you.

1055
01:20:18,004 --> 01:20:22,512
If you have also some neck ties very tight
on your neck you can loosen it a little.

1056
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:25,909
Or on your neck if you

1057
01:20:26,393 --> 01:20:30,545
have any heavy, very heavy
thing you can remove it.

1058
01:20:30,553 --> 01:20:33,897
Better to remove it, if there
is anything heavy on your neck.

1059
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:39,774
Or on your waiste there
is anyting very tight

1060
01:20:39,838 --> 01:20:44,337
better to remove anything
heavy on your neck or on your

1061
01:20:46,155 --> 01:20:48,829
Yes, if there is anything that
is tight better to remove.

1062
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:50,828
It's better.

1063
01:21:02,176 --> 01:21:04,557
Just put your right hand.

1064
01:21:06,073 --> 01:21:07,648
Close your eyes please first.

1065
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:11,481
Now don't open your eyes at
any time till I tell you,

1066
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:13,938
because the Kundalini won't rise

1067
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:17,986
up to after agnya if
you open your eyes.

1068
01:21:31,867 --> 01:21:35,022
You'll feel a cool breeze
in your hand first of all

1069
01:21:35,029 --> 01:21:38,359
or maybe on top of your
head as we go through

1070
01:21:38,445 --> 01:21:42,015
various levels of our chakras.

1071
01:21:42,653 --> 01:21:47,089
So first of all you put your
right hand on your heart

1072
01:21:49,486 --> 01:21:51,843
and just say,

1073
01:21:55,613 --> 01:21:59,033
Mother I am the Spirit.

1074
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:24,978
Now put this right hand down on
your stomach on the left hand side

1075
01:22:29,692 --> 01:22:35,138
and say, Mother I am my own guru.

1076
01:22:35,146 --> 01:22:37,986
With all confidence, I am my own guru.

1077
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:50,120
I am my own master.

1078
01:22:52,613 --> 01:22:56,605
You have to say it ten times, as I
told you there are ten plexuses.

1079
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:02,660
I am my own guru. That's how you
will neutralize all the bad effects

1080
01:23:03,168 --> 01:23:06,255
and your principle of guru,

1081
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:09,011
principle of master.

1082
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,383
You must shine.

1083
01:23:37,106 --> 01:23:39,510
Now again put the right hand.

1084
01:23:39,535 --> 01:23:42,415
Left hand towards me.
Keep it steady toward Me.

1085
01:23:43,352 --> 01:23:45,444
Your fingers towards me, left hand.

1086
01:23:45,475 --> 01:23:48,388
Please keep it on your lap.
Left hand towards me.

1087
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:51,709
Now put the right hand
again on the heart

1088
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,701
and say Mother I am the Spiriti.

1089
01:23:58,796 --> 01:24:02,867
With confidence. Now you
have to say it 12 times.

1090
01:24:04,138 --> 01:24:06,153
Because there are 12 petals.

1091
01:24:27,606 --> 01:24:29,828
Now put this right hand

1092
01:24:30,082 --> 01:24:33,082
on your neck on the left hand side

1093
01:24:35,796 --> 01:24:39,534
at this point you have to
say Mother I am not guilty.

1094
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:43,375
What ever you have done at this moment

1095
01:24:44,225 --> 01:24:45,345
is all finished.

1096
01:24:46,955 --> 01:24:49,010
You are going to be reborn.

1097
01:24:50,582 --> 01:24:53,661
Like an egg may have
any number of specks,

1098
01:24:53,693 --> 01:24:57,304
but a bird doesn't show that.
In the same way

1099
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:03,218
you should say, Mother
I am not guilty.

1100
01:25:04,947 --> 01:25:06,471
If you are the Spirit,

1101
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:10,240
the Spirit can not get any blemish.

1102
01:25:13,876 --> 01:25:16,042
16 times we say.

1103
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:40,912
Believe me that you can
not comit any guilt

1104
01:25:40,922 --> 01:25:43,890
which can not be washed
by the grace of God.

1105
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:57,952
Now raise the same right hand,
keeping the left hand towards me.

1106
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:00,513
On your forehead across

1107
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,507
touch your forehead across

1108
01:26:05,404 --> 01:26:06,793
and say now,

1109
01:26:07,396 --> 01:26:10,340
Mother I forgive everyone.

1110
01:26:10,952 --> 01:26:12,072
It's not difficult.

1111
01:26:12,754 --> 01:26:14,888
If you understand that it is a myth,

1112
01:26:16,261 --> 01:26:19,197
that you do not forgive.
Actually you don't do anything.

1113
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:22,118
Like that only thing you are
torturing yourself by not forgiving.

1114
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:24,586
So just say Mother

1115
01:26:26,262 --> 01:26:28,388
I forgive everyone.

1116
01:26:32,014 --> 01:26:36,340
Because this is the center of christ
say, Mother I forgive everyone.

1117
01:26:43,222 --> 01:26:46,904
There is no need to see other people,
just now you have to see yourself.

1118
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:51,118
You have seen all of them
before, better see yourself.

1119
01:26:51,643 --> 01:26:53,959
So put your right hand
across your head.

1120
01:26:56,896 --> 01:26:59,555
Better get it. It's a
very great chance.

1121
01:27:02,595 --> 01:27:05,888
And now put your hand
on top of your head.

1122
01:27:10,087 --> 01:27:11,891
On top of your head

1123
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:17,707
where you had a soft bone, the
area, fontenlle bone area.

1124
01:27:18,295 --> 01:27:22,298
Put your left hand towards Me. Left
hand should be down below towards Me.

1125
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,251
On top of your head,

1126
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:26,044
in the center of your head,

1127
01:27:26,315 --> 01:27:29,386
just press it, with the palm of your hand.

1128
01:27:34,069 --> 01:27:36,203
Now raise your hand above

1129
01:27:37,227 --> 01:27:38,347
4 inches

1130
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:40,790
and say that

1131
01:27:41,775 --> 01:27:45,787
you want your realization because
you are free not to have it.

1132
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,557
I can not force you.

1133
01:27:48,438 --> 01:27:52,184
So just say Mother I
want my realization

1134
01:27:52,811 --> 01:27:55,509
or please give me realization Mother.

1135
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,160
Now you can change your hand.

1136
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:07,747
Put your right hand down
and left hand up and see,

1137
01:28:12,462 --> 01:28:14,374
if there is a cool breeze coming in.

1138
01:28:29,557 --> 01:28:32,795
You can change again and see if
there is a cool breeze coming in.

1139
01:28:33,073 --> 01:28:36,668
Some people might be getting little hot.
Doesn't matter.

1140
01:28:37,414 --> 01:28:39,080
Raise your hand higher.

1141
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:43,128
On your head move it and see if there is
a cool breeze coming in, not very high

1142
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:46,120
see about 6-7 inches.

1143
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,063
That's the wind of the Holy Ghost.

1144
01:28:56,184 --> 01:29:00,225
Now ask a question by
putting up both your hands,

1145
01:29:00,531 --> 01:29:02,729
up there facing Me

1146
01:29:03,517 --> 01:29:06,544
both the hands up in the air

1147
01:29:06,697 --> 01:29:10,852
and ask the question Mother is
this the wind of the Holy Ghost?

1148
01:29:29,332 --> 01:29:31,030
Now bring down your hands

1149
01:29:31,753 --> 01:29:34,720
and see you are feeling any
cool breeze in your hands.

1150
01:29:53,260 --> 01:30:00,823
It's all right. We'll balance it. I know
left is less all right. Now it's better.

1151
01:30:04,173 --> 01:30:06,561
You may gradually open your eyes now.

1152
01:30:09,768 --> 01:30:12,899
Also Mr Warren will show you

1153
01:30:12,963 --> 01:30:16,645
Dr. Warren will show you how
to raise your own Kundalini.

1154
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:24,817
Just follow him.

1155
01:30:54,306 --> 01:30:55,797
Push back your hands.

1156
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:14,576
Push back your hands.

1157
01:31:21,652 --> 01:31:22,953
Now three times knots.

1158
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:27,904
Don't have to take down the
hands, now come along.

1159
01:31:46,874 --> 01:31:47,994
Now see.

1160
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:52,779
All right?

1161
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,120
It's very subtle.

1162
01:31:56,490 --> 01:31:59,815
We are going from gross
attention to subtler attention.

1163
01:32:07,335 --> 01:32:10,660
You are absolutely thoughtless.
There is no thought in your mind.

1164
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:19,701
Those who have felt the cool breeze
please raise your hands, all of you.

1165
01:32:23,559 --> 01:32:27,122
Those who have felt the cool
breeze raise your hands please.

1166
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:28,259
Both hands

1167
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:31,431
Those who have felt it.

1168
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:35,433
It's all right, if you have
felt it better rasie it.

1169
01:32:37,332 --> 01:32:38,452
It's good.

1170
01:32:39,269 --> 01:32:41,292
Quite alot of them have felt it.

1171
01:32:43,011 --> 01:32:45,058
Now what we have to do

1172
01:32:45,676 --> 01:32:48,811
is tomorrow is the last day,

1173
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:51,596
and I will explain to you

1174
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:55,113
last center which is very important

1175
01:32:56,056 --> 01:32:59,088
and how to keep your realization.

1176
01:33:03,307 --> 01:33:07,378
First of all you can't think about it.
It is beyond thought.

1177
01:33:07,911 --> 01:33:09,831
So you don't discuss it.

1178
01:33:11,245 --> 01:33:12,924
That is definate.

1179
01:33:12,988 --> 01:33:15,885
Then it is a very delicate thing.

1180
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,431
Just now is just the premule.

1181
01:33:19,757 --> 01:33:23,027
The germ has touched it.

1182
01:33:23,076 --> 01:33:28,198
It's a very thin line which
passes through the Brahma nadi.

1183
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:31,313
The whole kundalini is like a
rope with many, many threads

1184
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,925
and one thread has touched it.

1185
01:33:34,799 --> 01:33:38,544
So you have to learn
how to keep it there.

1186
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,536
How to maintain it there,

1187
01:33:40,674 --> 01:33:44,006
and use it for your own ascent,

1188
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:48,099
for repairs of your
self to begin with,

1189
01:33:48,279 --> 01:33:50,850
and then how to go to the collective,

1190
01:33:51,438 --> 01:33:53,699
how to help the others.

1191
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:57,126
So first of all one has
to be very careful.

1192
01:33:57,724 --> 01:34:01,620
Tomorrow I will be able to tell
you about self realization.

1193
01:34:01,692 --> 01:34:05,684
how to continue with and what
powers you have got now.

1194
01:34:06,002 --> 01:34:09,731
Because you have felt the cool breeze but
you don't know what powers you have got.

1195
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:14,444
So tomorrow I will be able to tell you
exactly what powers you have got already

1196
01:34:14,746 --> 01:34:15,866
and how to use them.

1197
01:34:16,952 --> 01:34:18,072
May God bless you.
