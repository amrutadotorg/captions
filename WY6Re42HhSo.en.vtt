WEBVTT

06:05.915 --> 06:12.197
I’m sorry for being late but I have been
working, I tell you, since morning.

06:12.398 --> 06:19.003
Now, today we are here

06:19.204 --> 06:22.917
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

06:23.118 --> 06:30.018
Resurrection of Christ has the greatest
significance for all the Sahaj Yogis.

06:30.219 --> 06:35.121
And we have to understand that He
resurrected Himself

06:35.322 --> 06:38.663
so that we could resurrect ourselves.

06:38.864 --> 06:44.662
The message of His life is His resurrection
and not His cross.

06:44.863 --> 06:50.612
He bore the cross for us and we don’t have
to bear anymore.

06:50.813 --> 06:54.094
I see lots of people having this drama
going on:

06:54.295 --> 06:57.938
they are carrying the cross across

06:58.139 --> 07:01.704
to show as if we are going to do the job
for Christ!

07:01.905 --> 07:07.051
As if He has left some work to be done
by these people who play a drama.

07:07.252 --> 07:11.778
But all this drama is to deceive yourself
and to deceive others.

07:11.979 --> 07:21.240
There’s no sense in playing such useless
things to show how Christ suffered.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.676
To make you weep and to make you cry,
Christ did not suffer.

07:25.877 --> 07:29.877
He suffered that you should enjoy,
that you should be happy,

07:30.078 --> 07:35.914
that you should lead a life of complete
bliss and gratitude

07:36.115 --> 07:38.888
to the Almighty who has created you.

07:39.089 --> 07:41.772
He would never like you to be unhappy.

07:41.973 --> 07:46.473
Which father would like his son to be
unhappy?

07:46.674 --> 07:52.704
So we have to understand that His message
of His life,

07:52.905 --> 07:59.130
why He came on this Earth to do the
greatest job is that of resurrection.

07:59.331 --> 08:04.455
If He had not resurrected Himself, I could
not have worked out Sahaj Yoga.

08:04.656 --> 08:08.529
So we have to be eternally thankful
to His life and to Him,

08:08.730 --> 08:15.313
the way He did all these difficult tasks,
taking upon Himself.

08:15.514 --> 08:18.740
That, we cannot do, we human beings, cannot
do it.

08:18.941 --> 08:23.243
It’s only He being the Divine, He being
the Om,

08:23.444 --> 08:29.728
He being the Logos, He being the Brahma
could do it.

08:30.323 --> 08:33.413
But now you all have ascended.

08:33.614 --> 08:38.949
I can see on your faces: Christ writ large
on your faces.

08:39.150 --> 08:43.374
It’s beautifully shining in your eyes and
twinkling.

08:43.575 --> 08:48.896
He’s there within us, in our hearts,
in our eyes,

08:49.097 --> 08:54.412
and He has resurrected Himself and
He has resurrected you, too.

08:54.613 --> 08:58.564
But now it is for you to resurrect other
people.

08:58.765 --> 09:02.989
You can resurrect other people, this is
the power you have got it

09:03.294 --> 09:06.490
through Him, maybe, or through your
Kundalini.

09:06.691 --> 09:10.118
But you have this power to resurrect other
people,

09:10.319 --> 09:14.431
but first and foremost thing [is] you have
to be strong like Christ:

09:14.632 --> 09:21.641
how He obeyed His Mother and how He
obeyed all the demands of His life.

09:21.842 --> 09:28.528
How He was committed and how He dedicated
Himself to this single task.

09:28.729 --> 09:33.144
He didn’t bother as to develop His monetary
side

09:33.345 --> 09:35.954
or to become some sort of a big officer

09:36.154 --> 09:39.950
or to become another great rider,
or a swimmer,

09:40.151 --> 09:45.036
or climb on the Alps, some sort of a thing
like that.

09:46.544 --> 09:51.311
He didn’t try all these tricks, and didn’t
try to hanker after all these things

09:51.512 --> 09:56.804
that sometimes make us quite mad.

09:57.005 --> 10:09.046
What He did was to establish His identity
as the Brahma itself,

10:09.247 --> 10:13.963
as the Divine vibrations itself, which He
established.

10:14.164 --> 10:20.874
And what you have to do is to establish
yourself as the resurrected people,

10:21.075 --> 10:25.866
as the realised souls, as the Sahaj Yogis.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.114
And this is going to be very easy.

10:29.315 --> 10:33.817
Now everything is made easy for you:
your realisation,

10:34.018 --> 10:41.689
then your powers, everything has
beautifully settled within you.

10:41.890 --> 10:46.072
It has worked out so beautifully, slowly
and steadily.

10:46.295 --> 10:55.921
I don’t think I have ever tried to force
you to do something

10:56.122 --> 10:59.665
or have compelled you to do something.

10:59.871 --> 11:04.589
But through your own ascent you can see
what’s wrong with you

11:04.790 --> 11:08.862
or with the people about whom we are
talking.

11:09.063 --> 11:17.634
And then you can also know through all
these powers whatever is to be known.

11:17.835 --> 11:22.007
All that is unknown can be your own,
everything.

11:22.216 --> 11:27.003
But the attention should be towards your
ascent, towards the state.

11:27.204 --> 11:31.969
Now ascent is not some sort of a physical
process.

11:32.170 --> 11:35.330
It is not that you ascend some staircases.

11:35.531 --> 11:41.531
It is a state. It’s a state of your
personality.

11:41.732 --> 11:43.716
And there where I always say…

11:43.917 --> 11:49.264
Excuse me, I think I’ll... The sun is
showing its results.

11:49.465 --> 11:51.454
See how the sun listens to me!

11:51.655 --> 11:54.993
Can you help me, a little bit, to take out
things.

11:55.194 --> 12:00.019
Very hot for me, I don’t know what
about you people.

12:00.384 --> 12:03.940
He’s just telling me off (the Sun).

12:20.052 --> 12:23.351
I forgot to tell you about the Sun so he’s
just troubling me,

12:23.552 --> 12:26.589
so I better tell!

12:39.564 --> 12:46.626
They have been telling for the last one
year, you see,

12:46.827 --> 12:51.228
we’ve been thinking of coming here
for this puja.

12:51.429 --> 12:56.296
And I was very anxious that we should have
the Easter Puja here,

12:56.497 --> 12:59.648
but the dates were not very suitable,

12:59.849 --> 13:02.754
because those days the moon would be
waning.

13:02.955 --> 13:05.609
So I thought, “How will I do it without
the moon?

13:05.810 --> 13:08.914
We have to have the moon there.
It’s important.”

13:09.115 --> 13:12.957
So I thought, “We’ll have it sometimes
later.”

13:13.158 --> 13:17.963
And suddenly it happened that I had to come
here: luckily I was here.

13:18.164 --> 13:21.879
And then on the television for the last one
week, they have been telling

13:22.080 --> 13:27.946
that it’s going to rain heavily, it’s going
to be very clouded

13:28.147 --> 13:31.158
and the temperature is going to be very bad

13:31.359 --> 13:37.832
and it’s going to be very, very heavy
rains.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.650
And again and again, every night, every
time

13:54.851 --> 14:00.349
they announced about the weather it was
looking even worse, every time.

14:00.563 --> 14:05.750
So I thought, “Now what to do?”

14:08.821 --> 14:11.852
If you ask the clouds to move out

14:12.071 --> 14:18.280
you have to have a tremendous breeze
and that may spoil your tent.

14:18.481 --> 14:20.800
So somehow or other, you see,

14:21.001 --> 14:26.920
I just told the clouds that, “You’d better
move on to Newfoundland,

14:27.121 --> 14:33.576
slowly, steadily, not with great speed.”
And they did it.

14:35.627 --> 14:38.755
And then the Sun which was very bright came
out.

14:38.956 --> 14:42.929
Early in the morning I saw Him, red like my
sari.

14:43.143 --> 14:49.487
So beautiful it was. And you were all
asleep but I was awake, very early.

14:49.688 --> 14:55.375
And I was watching the way it came up: just
like my bindi it came up.

14:55.576 --> 14:58.906
I saw it, and I said, “Look at the sun!

14:59.107 --> 15:05.520
How obedient, how dedicated, how
beautiful!”

15:05.721 --> 15:08.953
Whatever it is: today is Mother’s Puja,

15:09.154 --> 15:14.252
you have to have proper light, you have
to have proper temperature.

15:14.453 --> 15:17.202
So look at the sky! Look at everything!

15:17.403 --> 15:21.220
And then gradually it became pink like your
faces.

15:21.421 --> 15:26.622
It’s beautiful! It became pink, beautifully
pink, and then now it’s shining.

15:26.823 --> 15:33.542
I’m sorry I should have given full tribute
to the Sun, the way He has acted.

15:33.743 --> 15:39.256
So that’s why He is troubling me a little
bit, you see, to remind me!

15:40.941 --> 15:52.603
So, as you know the Sun is the Agnya
chakra.

15:52.874 --> 15:57.967
Christ resides in the Sun.

15:58.213 --> 16:06.800
And in the body, in the being, He is
the Spirit.

16:07.001 --> 16:09.448
When He’s the Spirit, He’s the moon.

16:09.663 --> 16:14.066
And when He acts on the Agnya, He’s
the Sun.

16:14.267 --> 16:19.033
Now we have seen in His life

16:19.234 --> 16:24.993
that He was absolutely spotlessly
immaculate.

16:25.359 --> 16:33.279
He had no defects in Him. He was
a perfect personality.

16:33.779 --> 16:37.803
“Then why did He want to resurrect?”, one
can ask.

16:38.004 --> 16:42.330
What is in His time, is the resurrection.

16:42.531 --> 16:49.951
His resurrection is like making the way
through the Agnya chakra

16:50.152 --> 16:53.842
for all of you to pass through it.

16:54.043 --> 16:58.545
He was like the gate, or we should say
He was the One

16:58.746 --> 17:03.177
who opened the gate for all of
you.

17:03.378 --> 17:07.145
Because He was so perfect,

17:07.562 --> 17:12.168
He had no problems as we have of our
chakras, our Kundalini.

17:12.369 --> 17:20.956
He had no problems. But He was
the complete compassion

17:21.157 --> 17:29.659
in the nature of vibrations: the vibrations
became complete compassion.

17:29.860 --> 17:33.802
So much so that even when He was
resurrected

17:34.003 --> 17:38.579
and even before that when He was crucified

17:38.780 --> 17:46.406
He said that, “Oh, God, the Father, please
forgive those people

17:46.607 --> 17:49.379
because they do not know what they
are doing.‎”

17:49.609 --> 17:53.426
Such forgiveness, such compassion!

17:53.627 --> 17:57.315
And the Mother had to watch all that,
keeping quiet,

17:57.538 --> 18:02.701
because that was the game, that was
the thing one had to do.

18:02.902 --> 18:06.619
He had to play His game and He played it
so well.

18:06.820 --> 18:11.672
So now when we talk about Christ, we have
to remember one thing:

18:11.873 --> 18:17.875
that He has done all this for us, now what
are we going to do for Him?

18:18.076 --> 18:20.577
He is the pattern we have to follow.

18:20.778 --> 18:23.454
Supposing if that is the pattern we have to
follow,

18:23.655 --> 18:29.066
then it’s not that we carry the cross
on our shoulder.

18:29.267 --> 18:31.371
That’s not the pattern you have to follow.

18:31.572 --> 18:34.505
Many people think [that] because He carried
the cross, we can carry the cross.

18:34.706 --> 18:36.602
Anybody can carry the cross!

18:36.803 --> 18:44.774
In India, if you give about five rupees to
a loader, he can carry a cross across!

18:44.975 --> 18:46.755
What is so great about it?

18:46.993 --> 18:52.163
What is so great in carrying a cross
on your shoulder?

18:52.364 --> 18:57.208
It’s nothing something great. Any wrestler
can do it, anybody can do it.

18:57.416 --> 19:01.603
That’s not the point! The point is we have
to carry

19:01.804 --> 19:07.094
the work of Christ, of resurrection.
That is what we have to realise.

19:07.294 --> 19:13.039
We have to understand the importance
of our being, of our lives,

19:13.240 --> 19:18.377
like Christ understood that He has come
for this great job here.

19:18.578 --> 19:20.726
And though He came as a human being,

19:20.927 --> 19:25.440
though He came as an ordinary son
of an ordinary carpenter.

19:25.641 --> 19:31.033
Though on this Earth He had a body and He
lived like other human beings,

19:31.247 --> 19:35.105
still He knew what He had to do,

19:35.306 --> 19:38.714
He knew what He had to achieve and He
achieved it.

19:38.914 --> 19:41.902
I think His was the most difficult task,

19:42.124 --> 19:45.465
which He achieved and which He
furnished it, so well,

19:45.666 --> 19:49.158
that today we are having all the benefits
of that.

19:49.359 --> 19:53.888
Now let us see if we have done something
for Sahaj Yoga or not.

19:54.089 --> 19:57.874
We all should examine ourselves: what have
we done for Sahaj Yoga?

19:58.074 --> 20:00.763
Not carrying the cross, I mean to say.

20:00.964 --> 20:04.446
Some people think when they travel in India
and if they carry

20:04.647 --> 20:08.482
the luggage of people downward, they are
carrying the cross of Christ.

20:08.683 --> 20:10.000
That’s not the way!

20:10.201 --> 20:13.267
It’s something very, very serious one has
to think about.

20:13.474 --> 20:20.973
And that seriousness is: how far we have
achieved that state,

20:21.330 --> 20:23.355
for that what have we done?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.565
And a simple thing I have been asking
all of you:

20:26.766 --> 20:30.389
you have to meditate every day!

20:30.590 --> 20:33.986
All of you have to meditate everyday.

20:34.187 --> 20:39.229
But somehow nobody has time to meditate.

20:39.430 --> 20:45.247
We are having these watches just to know
that we have to meditate,

20:45.448 --> 20:48.765
not for anything else. Our lives are
for meditation.

20:48.966 --> 20:54.340
You need not spend all your twenty-four
hours, but you have to meditate!

20:54.541 --> 20:59.492
Everyday you must meditate. If you
meditate your children will meditate.

20:59.693 --> 21:04.647
And meditation is such a simple thing
for you, made so easy

21:04.848 --> 21:09.110
that all the elements you can see work
it out.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.321
All your chakras are made of different
elements

21:12.522 --> 21:16.023
and when you clear out with the different
style —

21:16.224 --> 21:19.806
I mean, you know all the methods and
the techniques of Sahaj Yoga —

21:20.007 --> 21:24.014
with that when you clear out the chakras,
when you clear them out

21:24.215 --> 21:32.590
you are absolutely free, absolutely at that
stage where you have to be.

21:32.791 --> 21:37.049
But if you do not do this much even —
is to meditate —

21:37.250 --> 21:41.835
it’s going to be very, very difficult
for me and for you

21:42.036 --> 21:45.902
to achieve, for which you have come
on this Earth.

21:46.103 --> 21:50.059
It’s a tremendous task that I have taken
over, I know that,

21:50.260 --> 21:54.065
but I know how to do it, and you also
know how to do it.

21:54.266 --> 22:00.411
But the trouble is you get entangled into
your different conditionings.

22:00.612 --> 22:04.435
Now, by now you must have realised,
all these so-called religions

22:04.636 --> 22:09.540
in anybody’s name: whether it is in the
name of Islam, in the name of Christianity,

22:09.741 --> 22:16.315
in the name of Hinduism, in the name
of Sikhism — all this is falsehood.

22:16.516 --> 22:20.561
It has no truth in it.

22:20.762 --> 22:24.611
They have all tried to use it for their
own purposes.

22:24.812 --> 22:30.497
There’s only one truth and that is:
all these great prophets

22:30.698 --> 22:35.287
and all these great incarnations came
on this Earth for your ascent

22:35.488 --> 22:41.461
and not for establishing those religions
who are just interested in money.

22:41.662 --> 22:44.450
In these religions also you will find
there are people

22:44.651 --> 22:47.659
who are either left-sided or right-sided.

22:47.860 --> 22:52.435
There are some religions which preach
you should be very, very strict:

22:52.650 --> 22:55.252
you should not do this, you should not
do that,

22:55.453 --> 22:57.815
you should not drink, you should not smoke.

22:58.016 --> 23:01.724
There are some who say you should not
marry, you should not look at women,

23:01.970 --> 23:05.315
you should not look at men — all kinds
of restrictions.

23:05.537 --> 23:10.048
Even in Hinduism you will be surprised,
there are so many restrictions.

23:10.249 --> 23:17.907
If you see the amount of superstitions
that exist

23:18.108 --> 23:22.343
and that are created by brahmins in India
you will be shocked.

23:22.543 --> 23:24.421
For everything there’s a superstition:

23:24.622 --> 23:27.732
if you walk with the left hand ahead,
that means this,

23:27.933 --> 23:30.773
if you walk with the right hand, then
that means this;

23:30.974 --> 23:34.351
if you sit like this, that means that.
Everything!

23:34.552 --> 23:38.891
They have made a human being into a machine
and there’s no spontaneity about it.

23:39.092 --> 23:42.386
All kinds of absurdities there are
in Islam, too.

23:42.587 --> 23:46.841
But when we find them in a free place
like England,

23:47.042 --> 23:50.892
where there’s complete left-sidedness,
where you can do what you like,

23:51.093 --> 23:53.959
still you are a Christian: if you drink,
it’s all right;

23:54.160 --> 23:58.642
if you have ten wives, it’s all right; you
have fifteen keeps, it’s all right.

23:58.843 --> 24:04.328
Anything you do is all right as long as you
go to church and pay money!

24:05.219 --> 24:09.693
So there’s nothing, especially for
the Protestants –

24:09.894 --> 24:14.653
that’s the religion I was born in, where
everything is allowed.

24:14.854 --> 24:18.560
Now when we come to this kind of a thing,
what is the Christian religion is,

24:18.775 --> 24:21.432
then, comes to, that, if you ask them
the road,

24:21.633 --> 24:26.597
they’ll tell you which way to go — that’s
Christianity. It’s coming to that end.

24:26.798 --> 24:31.398
Now, all these religions either are
indulging into the Right Side

24:31.599 --> 24:33.281
or onto the Left Side.

24:33.482 --> 24:38.242
Some people like the Left Side and some
people like the Right Side.

24:38.443 --> 24:41.673
I will tell you the story of a priest,
I went to see him in Russia.

24:41.874 --> 24:45.164
I think I have told it to some people
before.

24:45.365 --> 24:50.932
I went to Russia and the Russian people
asked me, “What would you like to see?”

24:51.133 --> 24:54.097
So I told them I would like to go and see
some churches.

24:54.298 --> 24:56.824
So they said, “All right, very good, we’ll
take you to a church.”

24:57.024 --> 25:02.193
So they took me to church and it was that
Greek Orthodox Church, you see,

25:02.394 --> 25:06.618
and a Black Order, which is supposed to be
the highest. I don’t know how they call it.

25:06.819 --> 25:12.369
So we went inside and the priest said,
“All right, today I’m sorry,

25:12.570 --> 25:17.584
we cannot offer you meat because our
fasting is there. But we’ll have lunch.”

25:17.784 --> 25:19.835
So we had a very sumptuous lunch and
all that.

25:20.036 --> 25:23.318
But the priest was only busy drinking,
because it was a fasting,

25:23.519 --> 25:25.889
so drinking is allowed, according to them.

25:26.090 --> 25:28.264
So he was drinking and drinking and
drinking.

25:28.464 --> 25:31.530
He drank so much that he forgot that
we were there!

25:31.731 --> 25:35.401
We were supposed to be VIPs, you see:
just lost himself into drinking!

25:35.608 --> 25:38.903
So we thought better now have an honourable
retreat, you see.

25:39.104 --> 25:43.459
So we got up and walked out of that place

25:43.660 --> 25:45.421
and this fellow didn’t even come
to wish us.

25:45.622 --> 25:48.583
And these officers, the Russian officers,
didn’t drink,

25:48.784 --> 25:51.313
and didn’t do anything, and they were
laughing and laughing.

25:51.514 --> 25:53.386
He said, “See now, this is Christianity!

25:53.587 --> 25:56.406
That’s why we didn’t want to take
to Christianity.”

25:56.607 --> 25:59.558
So I said, “But see, that’s not Christ.”

25:59.759 --> 26:03.365
They said, “That’s true, but what these
people are saying, is it Christianity?”

26:03.566 --> 26:05.184
I said, “It’s not.”

26:05.384 --> 26:09.804
Now this gentleman, you see, was supposed
to be

26:10.005 --> 26:14.988
the highest person in spirituality living
in Russia!

26:15.189 --> 26:18.318
So they have told me a story about
the tzars.

26:18.519 --> 26:22.013
You see, tzars wanted to have some religion
because they thought,

26:22.214 --> 26:26.421
“Everybody’s having a religion, we have
no religion. Must have some religion.”

26:26.622 --> 26:30.750
So they sent for some people

26:30.951 --> 26:34.223
and the people who came forward were
Catholics to begin with.

26:34.424 --> 26:39.751
So the Catholics said, “All right, you can
drink in Catholic religion.”

26:39.952 --> 26:42.564
I don’t know how they got this idea, but
it’s all right.

26:42.765 --> 26:48.832
“Catholic religion you can drink but you
cannot have more than one wife.”

26:49.033 --> 26:51.055
The tzar said, “No, that’s not possible!

26:51.256 --> 26:54.154
We have to have many tsarinas, you see,
for different purposes.

26:54.355 --> 26:58.393
So we can’t have that religion!”
So they cancelled it.

26:58.594 --> 27:02.623
So then the Islam: you see that time
I think they were no hindus available,

27:02.824 --> 27:05.286
thank God!

27:06.040 --> 27:09.745
They had the Islam, Islam people went,
and the Islamic people said,

27:09.946 --> 27:14.160
“No, all right, you can have five wives,
it’s all right,

27:14.361 --> 27:20.558
but you cannot drink.” They said,
“That’s impossible!

27:20.759 --> 27:25.555
How can we follow Islam? That’s not
possible!” So, cancel it!

27:25.756 --> 27:28.605
So these orthodox people — orthodox,
you see,

27:28.806 --> 27:31.212
the word orthodox remember that — they
came.

27:31.413 --> 27:34.212
They said, “No, we are just in the centre,
you see.

27:34.413 --> 27:37.652
We don’t mind if you drink,

27:37.853 --> 27:40.634
we don’t mind if you have many wives,
we don’t mind.

27:40.856 --> 27:43.508
Only thing is, you have to pay us well!”

27:43.709 --> 27:48.022
Tzars said, “All right, that’s good, let’s
have this religion!”

27:48.760 --> 27:51.770
And that’s how they had this religion
there.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.702
So this is the situation of the religion
today.

27:54.903 --> 28:03.983
All these religions have become sort
of deformed statues, good for nothing.

28:04.184 --> 28:08.067
So now the inner religion within us is
the Sahaja dharma,

28:08.268 --> 28:12.261
which has to be fully followed.

28:12.462 --> 28:17.178
Now, I told, say in India, that now you
are all become Sahajas.

28:17.379 --> 28:24.570
The story is like this, that there was
a villager who became Christian.

28:24.771 --> 28:29.286
So he came down to Allahabad to become
Christian.

28:29.487 --> 28:31.467
So he told them that, “You have to give
me a big name

28:31.668 --> 28:34.853
because now I am Saheb, you see, I have
become an English man.

28:35.054 --> 28:37.549
So you better give me a big name.”
They said, “What name you want?”

28:37.750 --> 28:40.258
He said, “Give me the name of Alexander
the Great!”

28:40.459 --> 28:44.266
So they called him Alexander. But his name
was Blondie, you see.

28:44.467 --> 28:50.434
His real Indian name was Bhoora, so they
called him Alexander Bhoora.

28:50.634 --> 28:53.620
So Mr. Alexander Bhoora came to Allahabad

28:53.821 --> 28:56.818
and went to the River Ganges for having
his bath.

28:57.019 --> 29:01.026
So the priest said, the pastor, he said,
“You can’t do that!”

29:01.227 --> 29:03.492
He said, “Why? Why can’t I do that?”

29:03.693 --> 29:06.281
He said, “No, you can’t go and have bath
in the River Ganges

29:06.482 --> 29:08.430
because the Christianity will drop out,
you see!”

29:08.631 --> 29:11.616
If he goes and has a bath in the River
Ganges.

29:11.817 --> 29:13.659
He said, “This you can’t do!”

29:13.860 --> 29:18.039
So Alexander Bhoora said, “If I have become
saheb,

29:18.240 --> 29:22.361
I have become an Englishman, that doesn’t
mean I have given up my religion!”

29:22.562 --> 29:27.440
You see! This is exactly what is happening
to us

29:27.641 --> 29:31.193
when we try to follow any religion
whatsoever.

29:31.394 --> 29:37.111
Now we are all identified with our
so-called religions in which we were born.

29:37.312 --> 29:41.831
For example, if I told Indians, “Now,
you don’t go to temples!

29:42.032 --> 29:45.971
You are not to go to any temple, even if it
is a swayambhu temple,

29:46.172 --> 29:50.633
unless and until you have told me, don’t go
to a swayambhu temple at any cost.”

29:50.834 --> 29:58.162
There are many churches also where there
are very good statues, we can say,

29:58.363 --> 30:03.560
or have got something which are really
swayambhus, but they are very few.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.841
So you tell me and then go. But they
wouldn’t listen to me,

30:07.042 --> 30:11.882
they won’t listen, and when they go there
they catch on their Agnyas.

30:12.104 --> 30:17.786
Once I went to see one temple which was
of course a swayambhu temple, no doubt,

30:17.987 --> 30:21.826
so some Sahaj Yogis decided to go there.

30:22.027 --> 30:24.234
But I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell
me.

30:24.434 --> 30:27.073
When they came back, as soon as they
saw me, they all fainted.

30:27.280 --> 30:32.012
I said, “What happened? Where did you go?”
“Oh, we went to this temple.”

30:32.213 --> 30:35.387
I said, “Why? You never told me. And what
do you have here?”

30:35.588 --> 30:38.900
You see, the Brahmin put the teeka
(bindi) and it’s finished!

30:39.101 --> 30:41.649
Then it took them one month to clear out!

30:41.850 --> 30:46.484
Now they don’t go, they’ve had enough
of it.

30:46.685 --> 30:50.173
Same with the Christians:

30:50.374 --> 30:53.680
now the other day I heard about the Paris
episode

30:53.881 --> 31:01.023
where people wanted to have weddings
in the church, in Paris.

31:01.224 --> 31:03.227
So they must have special dresses!

31:03.428 --> 31:08.613
So somebody came here to buy some special
dresses from… what shop is that?

31:08.814 --> 31:11.029
I forgot the name, some big name.

31:11.230 --> 31:17.578
So the special dresses must be worn because
they have to go to the church!

31:17.779 --> 31:23.439
And when they came out of the church with
those dresses, they had become bhoots.

31:23.640 --> 31:27.161
I was surprised, what has happened to these
twenty-five of them?

31:27.362 --> 31:31.932
What has happened is that in the church
there are many dead bodies buried,

31:32.133 --> 31:34.072
and they are all caught up.

31:34.273 --> 31:39.060
So when you go also to see the beautiful
architecture,

31:39.261 --> 31:45.222
go with a detached mind. Don’t think
that you belong to that church.

31:45.423 --> 31:48.481
You don’t belong to any church. You don’t
belong to any temple.

31:48.682 --> 31:53.193
Don’t belong to any one of these forms,
then only you will ascend.

31:53.394 --> 32:00.012
And I have to tell you today that Christ
did not belong to any religion.

32:02.335 --> 32:08.930
He didn’t follow any religion. He followed
His own spiritual religion.

32:09.131 --> 32:12.098
When He went to one church where there
were people who were discussing,

32:12.299 --> 32:17.235
I mean they were Jews, He went there
and He was talking to them.

32:17.436 --> 32:22.036
The other day I saw a beautiful painting
they had given on the newspaper,

32:22.237 --> 32:27.050
a very beautiful famous painting where
Christ is talking to the doctors

32:27.251 --> 32:36.196
and He is holding His, rubbing His Left
Swadhishthana, very nicely,

32:36.397 --> 32:39.433
and all the doctors, you see, one of them
is listening to Him,

32:39.634 --> 32:41.927
one of them is looking at Him, sneering
at Him,

32:42.128 --> 32:44.322
another one is little bit paying attention
to Him.

32:44.523 --> 32:49.333
He’s just rubbing His Left Swadhishthan.

32:49.684 --> 32:52.711
It’s clearly [shown]. You can see it
so clearly!

32:52.912 --> 32:57.145
And so now, with these new achievements,
you must rise above all these things

32:57.346 --> 33:03.029
and you must understand that we have to be
very independently looking at ourselves.

33:03.230 --> 33:07.168
We are no more belonging to any religion.

33:07.369 --> 33:12.833
We belong to the religion of God which is
Sahaj.

33:13.034 --> 33:16.138
And Sahaj is the religion, it will spread

33:16.339 --> 33:20.674
only when you really become nothing
but Sahaj.

33:20.875 --> 33:24.408
But that’s something I don’t understand —
it doesn’t work out.

33:24.609 --> 33:30.084
I met somebody from, I forget that, there
was, say, called

33:30.285 --> 33:37.003
‘Hamaty’ or something who was supposed
to be an incarnation or something.

33:37.204 --> 33:41.739
His disciples absolutely, you should say
that they behave in such a manner

33:41.940 --> 33:47.972
that you can’t believe it, how ardently
they believe in this man.

33:48.173 --> 33:52.568
Whatever he says, whatever he does,
how they believe in him.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.591
It’s very surprising.

33:54.792 --> 34:00.910
You meet anyone who is following any guru,
anyone,

34:01.111 --> 34:05.251
you’ll be surprised the way they are
fanatic about this fellow

34:05.452 --> 34:08.668
and they will not hear anything against.
Leave alone that,

34:08.869 --> 34:14.074
but if he says, “You stand on your head
for the whole night,” they will do it!

34:14.296 --> 34:18.867
I don’t know what happens: when it comes
to falsehood, we try to follow it,

34:19.068 --> 34:22.753
and when we know the truth, this is
the truth,

34:22.954 --> 34:28.872
then we take advantage and we try
to compromise.

34:29.073 --> 34:35.018
We think the truth will not do anything
about it.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.146
Not that truth will punish you, it will
not,

34:38.347 --> 34:41.593
because you are realised souls. It will
not.

34:41.794 --> 34:44.980
It will not punish you up to a point.

34:45.181 --> 34:52.486
But remember that Ekadasha is absolutely
working at the same time.

34:52.687 --> 34:54.624
If we do anything wrong,

34:54.825 --> 34:59.263
like these people went to the church,
they were all caught up.

34:59.676 --> 35:03.027
Now they may say that, “Mother, why should
we be caught up?

35:03.228 --> 35:06.034
We are Sahaj Yogis.”

35:06.235 --> 35:11.648
Because you are vulnerable, you are
vulnerable.

35:11.849 --> 35:14.024
Yet you have not reached that stage.

35:14.225 --> 35:17.211
If you reach that stage, then when you
go there,

35:17.412 --> 35:22.183
all the church people will come out
of the church and run away.

35:22.384 --> 35:25.725
They’ll start shaking before you.

35:25.926 --> 35:27.594
They will not know what has happened.

35:27.795 --> 35:30.438
I have seen when I enter into any church

35:30.639 --> 35:33.798
all the candles start going chuk, chuk,
chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk,

35:33.999 --> 35:36.525
and people start wondering what has
happened.

35:36.726 --> 35:41.032
Even when they are having a dinner or
something and there is a candlelight dinner

35:41.233 --> 35:46.861
I am surprised the way every candle starts
flickering and people start looking.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.635
Because the bhoots are sitting before them,
you see,

35:49.836 --> 35:54.814
so the candles immediately show that
these are the bhoots sitting here.

35:55.015 --> 35:59.569
With all this knowledge that you have,
the light you have within yourself,

35:59.770 --> 36:02.301
by which you are enlightened, still if you
are going

36:02.502 --> 36:07.018
to these left and right-sided things,
it’s very, very dangerous.

36:07.219 --> 36:14.173
We see that also, today, I must tell you
about the part that is politics.

36:14.374 --> 36:17.730
In politics also these people have
developed two types of theories:

36:17.931 --> 36:20.102
one is left-sided, one right-sided.

36:20.303 --> 36:23.264
The left-sided theories are democratic,

36:23.465 --> 36:26.324
where you can indulge into anything
you like.

36:26.525 --> 36:28.754
It’s the individual that is important.

36:28.963 --> 36:31.313
The individual indulges into everything

36:31.514 --> 36:35.745
and you should not stop him from doing
whatever he likes, he’s an individual:

36:35.946 --> 36:38.915
so he has a right to cut his nose, he has
a right to cut his eyes,

36:39.116 --> 36:42.085
to do what he likes.

36:42.286 --> 36:46.026
An individual is allowed to do what
he likes to do,

36:46.227 --> 36:52.808
and then what happens [is] that we find
this democracy becomes a demonocracy:

36:53.009 --> 36:57.743
everybody is a demon. Everybody is busy
cutting throats,

36:57.944 --> 37:03.468
cutting all the basis and the roots of life

37:03.669 --> 37:07.631
because everybody is Brahma, becomes
a great personality,

37:07.832 --> 37:13.253
because the individual is so great and
the collective is lost, completely lost.

37:13.454 --> 37:18.197
But on the other side, where it is more
discipline,

37:18.398 --> 37:23.400
more aggressiveness, more controls and
everything [with] the Right Side,

37:23.601 --> 37:28.500
which we can call as communism, where
people are controlled all the time.

37:28.701 --> 37:33.441
Now why? Because for the collective
the individual must sacrifice.

37:33.642 --> 37:38.228
In that case, the individuals become weak
and if the individuals are weak,

37:38.429 --> 37:42.768
then the collective cannot be strong:
it cannot be strong.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.954
The individuals have to be strong.
For example, you will see

37:46.155 --> 37:50.083
that the people who come from communist
countries,

37:50.284 --> 37:54.123
they drink more than people who can
drink here.

37:54.324 --> 37:58.717
Or those who come, say from Islamic
countries, where they don’t touch anything,

37:58.918 --> 38:01.812
can drink more than even sardarjees.

38:02.013 --> 38:06.528
So you can imagine what is the situation
of human beings is

38:06.729 --> 38:11.830
that, out of fear if you try to control
him, he goes to the Right Side.

38:12.031 --> 38:16.217
But he is in no way perfected, he’s not
transformed,

38:16.418 --> 38:22.143
he doesn’t accept the situation, he doesn’t
become that,

38:22.344 --> 38:26.752
he doesn’t have that power to control
himself.

38:26.953 --> 38:33.761
He doesn’t get over his sinning aptitudes.
He’s still there.

38:33.962 --> 38:38.312
As soon as he gets a chance he falls
into it. So that fails.

38:38.513 --> 38:40.963
So the individuals are weak in that case.

38:41.164 --> 38:45.018
And where there is complete abandonment,
do what you like,

38:45.219 --> 38:50.953
live the way you like, indulgences, all
kinds of things, so you find [decadence].

38:51.154 --> 38:53.336
I mean, everyday you see and you say,

38:53.537 --> 38:56.703
“Oh God, this is a decadent society,
this is happening!”

38:56.904 --> 39:02.190
Decadence is because an individual
[to] whom you have given all these powers,

39:02.391 --> 39:05.275
has no power to bear them.

39:05.476 --> 39:11.227
An individual cannot bear money. He
cannot bear power of any kind.

39:11.428 --> 39:17.305
He cannot bear love. He cannot bear
kindness.

39:17.506 --> 39:23.725
He cannot understand peace because he’s
still an individual.

39:23.926 --> 39:28.596
But when an individual becomes
the collective -

39:28.797 --> 39:32.043
this is the ascent through the central
path -

39:32.244 --> 39:41.029
when he becomes the collective, in his
strength he strengthens the collective.

39:41.230 --> 39:47.307
And also the collective looks after,
protects, and guides the individual.

39:47.508 --> 39:49.221
This is what Sahaj Yoga is.

39:49.422 --> 39:56.497
So the politics of Sahaj Yoga is that you
have to become the collective personality.

39:56.746 --> 40:03.355
And there where we feel that still we are
something great,

40:03.556 --> 40:11.840
we are different, we are Indians or we are
from England or from France,

40:12.041 --> 40:15.629
still if you are identified then you are
not collective.

40:15.830 --> 40:21.414
In collective sense we are all one, part
and parcel of one being.

40:21.615 --> 40:26.009
Then you are really acting as collective
being

40:26.223 --> 40:29.253
and you are one with the Divine. Where
the Sun is looking after you,

40:29.454 --> 40:32.750
the Moon is looking after you, the winds
are looking after you;

40:32.951 --> 40:39.432
all the Mother Earth and all these
elements are working.

40:39.633 --> 40:44.814
Ether, everything is working for you and
you are so well-protected

40:45.015 --> 40:51.834
and blessed by the special quality to enjoy
the joy.

40:52.035 --> 40:55.140
Then you really become sensitive to that
joy,

40:55.341 --> 40:58.262
when you are one with the whole.

40:58.463 --> 41:03.113
Like if supposing this finger or this
finger is not one with the whole,

41:03.314 --> 41:07.420
is numbed out… as it happens in leprosy,
what happens

41:07.621 --> 41:09.823
that this finger becomes numbed out.

41:10.024 --> 41:15.804
Even if a rat eats it off we don’t know

41:16.005 --> 41:21.239
because there is no connection, no nerves
acting, it’s insensitive.

41:21.440 --> 41:25.267
In the same way if you are not collective

41:25.468 --> 41:32.575
and not bothered about collective you are
going to be dropped out.

41:32.776 --> 41:36.542
You are not going to be there to enjoy

41:36.743 --> 41:42.403
the beauties of your own glory and that
of the collective.

41:42.604 --> 41:46.437
So one has to understand that we have to be
strong ourselves,

41:46.643 --> 41:50.356
we have to ascend and we have to be
collective.

41:50.557 --> 41:53.847
It’s very easy to find out faults with
others.

41:54.048 --> 41:57.149
Very easy to find faults with the leaders.

41:57.350 --> 42:02.416
Very easy to find faults also with Sahaj
Yoga, sometimes with me.

42:02.617 --> 42:07.811
Better find faults with yourself. The rest
I’ll look after.

42:08.012 --> 42:12.508
First you just find faults with yourself
and try to understand others

42:12.709 --> 42:17.742
and love others and enjoy the company
of others.

42:17.943 --> 42:21.574
This, once you decide that we have
to enjoy,

42:21.775 --> 42:25.259
I tell you, it’s so spontaneous.

42:25.460 --> 42:29.097
Just this decision, this faith, within you

42:29.298 --> 42:32.869
that, “I’m going to enjoy now my Spirit.

42:33.070 --> 42:36.973
I’m going to enjoy the collective within
me,” that’s the Spirit.

42:37.174 --> 42:42.833
Just this decision itself will give you
the power to enjoy.

42:43.034 --> 42:46.576
But the decision should be firm,
no hypocrisy,

42:46.777 --> 42:50.652
no playing games, no ego, no conditioning,
nothing,

42:50.853 --> 42:56.761
just pure desire within us that we have
to be the Spirit.

42:56.962 --> 43:01.178
And the Spirit which is the collective
being within us.

43:01.379 --> 43:06.151
I hope today on this day of resurrection,

43:06.352 --> 43:13.076
we have to be thankful to Christ very much
for showing us the way

43:13.277 --> 43:24.255
and also we have to be very much concerned
and alerted about ourselves:

43:24.456 --> 43:27.273
Where are we? Where do we stand?

43:27.474 --> 43:30.834
What are we up to? What are we doing?

43:31.035 --> 43:34.775
What is our responsibility? What is
expected of us?

43:34.976 --> 43:37.865
Why all these blessings are given to us?

43:38.066 --> 43:41.809
There’s no sacrifice in Sahaj Yoga,
no sacrifice.

43:42.010 --> 43:46.851
Nobody wants you anything to commit
or to do

43:47.052 --> 43:50.158
or membership or anything like that.

43:50.359 --> 43:55.804
I think it’s my commitment. As I said,
that God has the commitment

43:56.005 --> 44:03.192
but you also have one commitment that
your desire should be pure.

44:03.393 --> 44:07.254
That’s the only thing, that, “Let my desire
be pure!

44:07.455 --> 44:10.709
No impurities of any kind, should work it
out.”

44:10.910 --> 44:15.428
As Christ had His desire, so pure, and
that’s what He achieved.

44:15.629 --> 44:18.750
I am sure you can all achieve a lot in your
life.

44:18.951 --> 44:23.659
Today is my sixty-fifth birthday. Now
imagine, I’m sixty-five years of age

44:23.860 --> 44:32.012
and at this age most of the ladies, you
see, just, I don’t know what they do.

44:33.307 --> 44:41.838
So now you must come up and work out
everything

44:42.039 --> 44:47.764
as far as possible, thinking that we all
have to stand up.

44:47.965 --> 44:52.213
Now the children are coming up. They are
also going to stand up.

44:52.414 --> 44:54.685
You are all looking younger to me and
younger to me.

44:54.886 --> 44:58.186
Every day I see you, you look younger.
Sometimes I don’t even recognise you,

44:58.387 --> 45:04.284
the way you look younger and I think,
is he the son or is he the father?

45:08.130 --> 45:14.756
So, the situation is such that you are
all blessed:

45:14.986 --> 45:18.225
you’ve got jobs, you’ve got everything.
And everybody tells me,

45:18.426 --> 45:20.791
“Mother, this is what has happened,
that has happened!” everything.

45:20.992 --> 45:25.923
Now, so what? These are temptations,
be careful.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.213
This is not what you wanted.

45:28.414 --> 45:35.269
What you wanted is the state of that
complete faith within yourself

45:35.475 --> 45:40.585
where you don’t have to ask, nothing —
everything will work out.

45:40.824 --> 45:46.126
Everything will work out. It works!
That’s the point is.

45:46.327 --> 45:50.290
So, I hope next time when we meet

45:50.491 --> 45:54.954
I’ll see even younger people than what
I see today

45:55.155 --> 45:57.992
and I’ll be able to recognise you.

45:58.193 --> 46:01.202
Christ died at a very, very young age, very
young age.

46:01.403 --> 46:09.185
He was very young, I must say. But how
much He has done for humanity.

46:09.386 --> 46:13.398
Nobody could have achieved that much
in that small age as He has done it.

46:13.599 --> 46:16.526
It’s remarkable! It’s really remarkable!

46:16.727 --> 46:21.555
That’s what I expect you to follow, His
footsteps in doing remarkable things.

46:21.756 --> 46:26.544
And let me see all of you, every one of you
have to do something great.

46:26.745 --> 46:29.372
And today is the day of certain promises.

46:29.573 --> 46:31.080
May God bless you for that.

46:31.281 --> 46:36.491
And I thank you very much for this birthday
of mine.
