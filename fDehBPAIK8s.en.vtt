00:00:02.275 --> 00:00:13.566
Today is a great day for all of us to be jubilant

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:21.317
that the Primordial Being Himself incarnated on this earth

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:24.359
as Shri Krishna.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:38.359
So many aspects of His being have been described

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.192
in so many of my lectures to you all;

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:47.775
but the greatest and greatest of all the aspects

00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:51.775
of this Primordial Being

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:55.650
was that He was the Yogeshwara.

00:00:55.691 --> 00:01:01.983
He was the God of Yoga - Yogeshwara.

00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:15.150
He was the Lord of our Union with the Divine.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.483
Without His permission and without His sanction we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:35.441
He was Yogeshwara and a real Yogi is a person

00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:45.317
who gets this Yogeshwara awakened within him.

00:01:45.317 --> 00:01:50.275
The word "Yoga", that we understand,

00:01:50.275 --> 00:02:03.942
is the union of our attention with the Divine.

00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:09.608
But still we do not realize the implications --

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:18.359
what does it mean? What should happen to us?

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.067
Of course you get powers.

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.691
As soon as you become the spirit you get powers.

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:28.400
One of the powers you get is of collective consciousness --

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.192
that is also the gift of Shri Krishna --

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:35.150
and that you start feeling the collectivity.

00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:39.691
Your ego and superego is sucked in,

00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:45.942
so you get rid of your karmas and your conditionings

00:02:45.942 --> 00:02:51.150
and a new sprouting of the new life of the new age starts.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:01.234
But still what is the speciality, the greatness of Yogeshwara?

00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:12.483
Because He is Ishwara for you. He is the Ishwara of all the Yogis

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:20.566
and what is His capacity, what is His nature?

00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:27.483
That for Him everything is a play - Leela.

00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:30.858
For Shri Rama it was not a play.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:44.359
For Him life was a platform on which he had to demonstrate

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:53.608
how to lead a very dharmic life as Maryada Purushottama.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:10.150
But Shri Krishna came up to show that He is the Leeladhara --

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.359
the one who plays the Leela, the play.

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:21.234
The whole thing is a play, the whole universe is a play.

00:04:21.234 --> 00:04:25.691
All that is created by Adi Shakti, all these three gunas

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:33.359
is nothing but a play. And that is what He manifested

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:39.399
in His own incarnation. But still what is Yogeshwara?

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:45.650
Leeladhara is the one for whom this whole universe is a play,

00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:49.817
that He is at the axis, and for the whole periphery

00:04:49.858 --> 00:04:59.900
is nothing but a play. Because everything is false.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.317
Except for your spirit everything is false.

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:13.359
It's all a joke going on, you can say,

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:16.109
a drama going on, nothing so serious.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.900
Spirit is the only truth within us the rest is all untruth.

00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:25.942
There cannot be many types of truths you see.

00:05:25.983 --> 00:05:28.650
In Sanskrit language there is only truth or untruth,

00:05:29.234 --> 00:05:32.109
satya or asatya, there are no ten words for truth.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.608
So when this happens,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:42.067
this great happening takes place within you,

00:05:42.109 --> 00:05:46.067
when you become one with [the] Spirit you get powers

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:53.109
without even your maturity reaching that stage,

00:05:53.109 --> 00:05:57.650
your understanding reaching that stage

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.900
and your heart opening out.

00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:12.650
so that you have faith with open understanding.

00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:17.192
You should have faith with experience of it

00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:21.067
so it starts off. When you start using your powers

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:25.359
you see it is manifesting, you are sometimes amazed,

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:27.359
how you raise Kundalini of people,

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:31.983
how you tie them up, how you give them realization,

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:33.942
how you cure people.

00:06:33.942 --> 00:06:36.067
You are amazed, how it has happened.

00:06:36.109 --> 00:06:40.192
So we can say it is all built within you

00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:42.275
which has started manifesting.

00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:48.234
But there is so much more that has to still manifest,

00:06:48.275 --> 00:06:54.025
which has to establish and make you grow.

00:06:54.067 --> 00:06:59.025
One of the very important points is the Yogeshwara

00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:04.566
and that point we must understand

00:07:04.608 --> 00:07:13.317
that unless and until you follow the path of Yogeshwara,

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:16.900
you cannot establish yourself fully.

00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:20.067
So Krishna has said that:

00:07:20.109 --> 00:07:24.608
"Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja"

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.858
"You give up all your relationships...",

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.275
dharma is relationship. Like your sister, your brother

00:07:34.317 --> 00:07:40.441
you see these are dharmas, like Sri dharma  a woman's job.

00:07:40.483 --> 00:07:46.359
Then we can say also there is Rashta dharma.

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:51.317
Today is the day of India's freedom.

00:07:51.317 --> 00:07:56.441
So we have Rashta dharma, we are patriotic people.

00:07:56.441 --> 00:08:01.858
Patriotism to your own country is Rashta dharma.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.608
Then you have got Samaj dharma

00:08:06.608 --> 00:08:13.399
that is duty towards your society, is Samaj dharma.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.275
Then you have got Pati dharma, husbands' duties,

00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:28.025
wives' duties. Everybody's duties are called as dharmas

00:08:28.067 --> 00:08:30.942
because this is what you have to do,

00:08:30.942 --> 00:08:34.858
you are duty bound - they form your dharmas.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.109
But He says, "Give up all these dharmas,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.691
give up all the duties, just surrender yourself fully to Me"

00:08:42.691 --> 00:08:46.566
"Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja".

00:08:46.608 --> 00:08:51.275
Because you have become now the collective being,

00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:54.234
now you have become one with Him,

00:08:54.275 --> 00:08:56.608
now He looks after your dharmas,

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.608
He looks after your relationships,

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.942
He cleanses them, He purifies them,

00:09:00.983 --> 00:09:04.192
so you just surrender yourself to Him fully.

00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:10.900
He said it to Shri Arjuna only not to everyone.

00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:13.733
He didn't say to everyone they didn't deserve it,

00:09:13.775 --> 00:09:16.441
or He didn't think it proper to say to them.

00:09:16.483 --> 00:09:20.525
But I think you are proper people to know this

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:25.192
so I'm telling you that: forget every other duty

00:09:25.234 --> 00:09:28.025
to every other thing but do your duty

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:32.942
to your collective being, to your collectivity.

00:09:32.983 --> 00:09:39.025
But He is Yogeshwara. That's the main point.

00:09:39.025 --> 00:09:43.359
And to do duty to Him first and foremost thing

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:49.733
is you have to develop that purity of a Yogeshwara.

00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:59.817
For Him sublimation was not needed  He was sublime.

00:09:59.858 --> 00:10:02.109
He was the source of sublimation.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.317
He did not need sublimation from the baser instincts

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:13.150
of human beings. He did not need anything to do,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.441
to be done to Himself to raise Himself out of the maya

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:22.150
as they call it. Especially in the West, as you know,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:28.525
we have created a hell for ourselves - real hell.

00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:34.192
All kinds of perverted ideas are within us.

00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:37.067
To a Yogeshwara this is nothing but maya,

00:10:37.109 --> 00:10:44.608
absolutely filth. Never comes into His [mind]

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.817
that such things are possible - they are shocking.

00:10:47.858 --> 00:10:52.775
On His birthday - I would say if today is His birthday

00:10:52.817 --> 00:10:57.150
and if He was born as He was at that time --

00:10:57.192 --> 00:11:01.359
He would have gone back immediately.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:06.733
He would have said, "No sorry, I've nothing to do,

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:08.817
had enough." And that too,

00:11:08.858 --> 00:11:10.858
if He had met the Western culture,

00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:12.234
He would have been shocked back

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:14.817
he [would have] said, "Oh God, no, nothing doing.

00:11:14.858 --> 00:11:17.275
I'm not coming here.

00:11:17.317 --> 00:11:21.067
Despite the times when He was born,

00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:23.317
where there was dharma, there were people

00:11:23.317 --> 00:11:25.234
[who] understood what was right, what was wrong.

00:11:25.234 --> 00:11:27.858
When there was none of these nonsensical things

00:11:27.858 --> 00:11:32.858
were there - He came as Yogeshwara - pure.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:41.858
The story of His is that once His wives wanted to go...

00:11:41.858 --> 00:11:46.067
to Him what was wives? Nothing - is just a play.

00:11:46.067 --> 00:11:48.483
To Him no sin can be attached.

00:11:48.525 --> 00:11:51.192
He married because He had to marry

00:11:51.234 --> 00:11:56.317
His five principles or the five elements.

00:11:56.359 --> 00:11:58.983
So He made them into women and married them.

00:11:59.025 --> 00:12:01.691
He had to marry 16,000 women

00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:06.817
because He had to have 16,000 powers

00:12:06.817 --> 00:12:12.650
and He had to channelize them through some bodies,

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.775
so they came as women.

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:19.317
To Him it was not a relationship of a wife

00:12:19.359 --> 00:12:22.150
but a pure relationship.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.483
To Him sex had no existence at all.

00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:30.817
He was beyond it.

00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:32.608
So no question of temptations

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.025
and perversions - is out of [the] question.

00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:40.942
The story is that once His five wives wanted to go

00:12:40.983 --> 00:12:45.400
and pray to some saint who had come,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:53.817
a great saint, to their town.

00:12:53.817 --> 00:12:57.650
But he really stayed across the river.

00:12:57.691 --> 00:13:01.525
So they wanted to go and worship him

00:13:01.566 --> 00:13:05.359
and they found a very good time when they could go and see him.

00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:10.650
So when they went near the river they said

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.525
"It is in spate we cannot cross it,

00:13:13.566 --> 00:13:16.359
it's not the time that you can cross it."

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:22.566
So they felt it was very inauspicious if they did not go

00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:24.900
and that was such an auspicious time.

00:13:24.942 --> 00:13:29.733
They wanted to go at that time and worship this guru.

00:13:29.775 --> 00:13:32.775
So they went to Krishna and said that

00:13:32.817 --> 00:13:35.608
"Now, how can we cross, the river is in spate?"

00:13:35.608 --> 00:13:41.942
He said: "Really? Doesn't matter.

00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:49.192
You go and tell the river.." - that is the river Yamuna river,

00:13:49.192 --> 00:13:52.400
no I'm sorry  Tapi, Tapi river..

00:13:52.441 --> 00:14:03.566
He said "Go and tell the river that 'if we have a husband

00:14:03.608 --> 00:14:11.234
who is Shri Krishna, is a Yogeshwara - that means

00:14:11.234 --> 00:14:14.192
who has never indulged into any sex activity..."

00:14:14.234 --> 00:14:18.025
Yogeshwara means a person who has never indulged

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:21.483
into any sex relationships.

00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:26.441
That's not possible. One cannot think of such a thing.

00:14:26.483 --> 00:14:29.650
Means though He indulged, He never indulged into [it].

00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:37.650
Though He was in it still He was not there, like a lotus. "...

00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:45.525
If He has not indulged into any such action..." --

00:14:45.566 --> 00:14:51.566
it's a... only possible for Him, nobody else.

00:14:51.608 --> 00:14:53.400
That's why He is an incarnation,

00:14:53.441 --> 00:14:55.150
He's not a human being.

00:14:55.192 --> 00:14:56.817
Only incarnations can do it.

00:14:56.817 --> 00:14:58.733
If some human being starts saying that

00:14:58.775 --> 00:15:02.150
"I am Shri Krishna, so I am doing this and I am doing that",

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:04.150
like you see, there are very bombastic ones,

00:15:04.192 --> 00:15:05.691
you must have heard about them.

00:15:05.733 --> 00:15:10.817
They do not become, is only an incarnation can do it.

00:15:10.858 --> 00:15:19.400
That means Yogeshwara is the one who had incarnated.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.983
So they went and told the river that,

00:15:23.983 --> 00:15:28.150
"If He is the Yogeshwara, then please you subside."

00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:35.566
And she went down. So they went to the other side,

00:15:35.566 --> 00:15:37.858
did the puja to the guru and they came back.

00:15:37.858 --> 00:15:40.983
Again the river was in spate and they could not cross.

00:15:40.983 --> 00:15:45.942
So they went to the guru.

00:15:45.983 --> 00:15:52.399
This is the sign of a good guru or a real guru,

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:57.942
is an incarnated guru. And they said that

00:15:57.983 --> 00:16:01.650
"See, we cannot cross, the river is in spate."

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.691
So they said: "Really, how did you come?"

00:16:05.733 --> 00:16:08.650
They said, "Shri Krishna asked us,

00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:15.400
that 'if I am the Yogeshwara, it will go down, you ask the question'."

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:20.234
So he said: "All right, now you go and ask the question,

00:16:20.275 --> 00:16:37.733
that if I am the bhukta. Bhukta, that means

00:16:37.775 --> 00:16:41.608
if I have eaten all the food you have given me,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.441
but I have not enjoyed it, I've not indulged into it,

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:50.566
then let the river subside."

00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:52.566
They went and told the river,

00:16:52.608 --> 00:16:54.317
I mean they could not believe it

00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:56.817
because they had fed him, that:

00:16:56.858 --> 00:16:58.650
"Whatever food we offered him,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:05.566
if he has not eaten any food, then you subside".

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:07.400
And the river subsided!

00:17:07.441 --> 00:17:18.775
So the moral of the whole thing is that your ideal,

00:17:18.817 --> 00:17:28.234
your ideal again, in this respect, is Shri Krishna.

00:17:28.275 --> 00:17:37.691
Not that you think you are the ideal of the rest.

00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:41.733
This is the big mistake Sahaja Yogis do.

00:17:41.733 --> 00:17:44.858
They think immediately they have become now

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:50.025
Shri Krishna or they have become something greater

00:17:50.067 --> 00:17:59.942
or that there is an ideal that they have imbibed within themselves

00:17:59.983 --> 00:18:05.067
It's not so - that one thing one has to know,

00:18:05.109 --> 00:18:12.900
that that is the ideal you have to reachand your eyes

00:18:12.942 --> 00:18:15.775
should be towards that ideal and the movement

00:18:15.775 --> 00:18:18.441
should be towards that. Before that,

00:18:18.483 --> 00:18:23.275
if you fall into any such thing like perversions

00:18:23.317 --> 00:18:26.150
and nonsensical sexual things and all that,

00:18:26.192 --> 00:18:28.817
you must know that you are falling down very badly.

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:32.566
It's a possession that is working on you.

00:18:32.566 --> 00:18:36.942
That's an ideal - they are incarnations.

00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:41.067
You are not incarnations nor can you become incarnations.

00:18:41.109 --> 00:18:45.858
But they are the light, which are enlightening your path,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.400
on which you are walking. They are taking you to the realm

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.566
where they are the Kings and they are the Lords.

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:56.150
He is Ishwara - He is your Ishwara.

00:18:56.192 --> 00:19:01.858
You are not Ishwaras. But you are at least the Yogis.

00:19:01.858 --> 00:19:08.275
We have to be the yogis first, then He is our Ishwara, nah?

00:19:08.317 --> 00:19:10.359
Otherwise He doesn't want to rule you.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:15.942
So what we have to do, is to become the Yogis first.

00:19:15.942 --> 00:19:21.067
And one of the signs of a yogi is

00:19:21.109 --> 00:19:28.399
that he is in his sex life extremely pure.

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:40.441
Absolutely purity must exist

00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:44.483
and after some time one should get beyond.

00:19:44.525 --> 00:19:53.067
Your relationships with other people,

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:57.858
whether it is your sister or a brother

00:19:57.858 --> 00:20:00.650
or any other woman or any other man,

00:20:00.691 --> 00:20:05.525
there should be complete purity.

00:20:05.566 --> 00:20:11.817
And this is extremely important.

00:20:11.817 --> 00:20:18.817
Now in the countries like India, people are extremely corrupt,

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:23.942
very corrupt, extremely corrupt. You can give them 5 rupees

00:20:23.983 --> 00:20:26.483
and you can buy anybody there.

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:29.608
It's very corrupt, moneywise.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.858
But people are not so immoral, they know it is immorality,

00:20:34.858 --> 00:20:37.150
I mean they know. I mean if they do immoral thing

00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:39.817
they know it is not moral.

00:20:39.858 --> 00:20:44.399
In the West the immorality has become a general rule.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.525
For them the 'morality' word should vanish now.

00:20:47.566 --> 00:20:49.817
I mean it doesn't exist like morality.

00:20:49.817 --> 00:20:51.400
Do anything whatever you like,

00:20:51.441 --> 00:20:53.900
people don't think of immorality.

00:20:53.942 --> 00:20:58.067
They don't want to talk of it, "it is Victorian."

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:01.483
And if somebody says that one should be moral,

00:21:01.483 --> 00:21:03.733
they start thinking he's an hypocrite.

00:21:03.733 --> 00:21:06.067
I mean they cannot think there can be any connection

00:21:06.109 --> 00:21:09.525
between human being and morality in a genuine way.

00:21:09.566 --> 00:21:14.400
This is a big problem we have. It's the biggest problem we have.

00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:19.983
Now corruption is something you can avoid

00:21:20.025 --> 00:21:25.192
because if you are not corrupt, it is alright, you can be.

00:21:25.192 --> 00:21:28.483
But immorality is such a thing that,

00:21:28.483 --> 00:21:35.441
if you live in an immoral world, it has effect on everyone.

00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:38.359
For example, a moral woman is walking on the road

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:41.150
and there is a man full of lust and all that looking at her.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.691
In any way she looses her chastity.

00:21:45.691 --> 00:21:48.359
She doesn't mean to attract him or anything,

00:21:48.399 --> 00:21:50.150
she doesn't want to loose her chastity,

00:21:50.192 --> 00:21:53.359
but the way he is looking at her, you see,

00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:58.483
though her simple methods are there, she may be responsible

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:01.983
in a distant way to ruin his chastity,

00:22:02.025 --> 00:22:06.900
his morality. Even a little child, who is a simple,

00:22:06.942 --> 00:22:10.109
innocent child but if there''s a dirty man with a dirty eyes,

00:22:10.109 --> 00:22:13.733
he can have very dirty feelings for the child.

00:22:13.775 --> 00:22:18.608
So, though of course that person himself is dirty and all that,

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.650
we cannot say the child is not affected.

00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:23.359
But in a way, that becomes an object,

00:22:23.359 --> 00:22:25.900
a sort of a Vastu as you call it.

00:22:25.942 --> 00:22:30.733
A thing which makes another person

00:22:30.775 --> 00:22:33.817
even lower than what he is.

00:22:33.858 --> 00:22:38.067
Even an ordinary picture, which has nothing to do,

00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:40.858
is placed there, any funny thing

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:46.025
which is giving some dirty feelings.

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:51.150
Because these days I have seen so many symbols

00:22:51.192 --> 00:22:55.025
have started, which to my eye I don't even see

00:22:55.025 --> 00:22:56.942
there is anything wrong in it.

00:22:56.983 --> 00:23:00.234
That to my eye I can't see because I'm too innocent.

00:23:00.234 --> 00:23:03.150
My eyes can't see [that] there''s anything wrong.

00:23:03.192 --> 00:23:05.900
But to somebody, who is an expert on these things,

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.525
[he] will immediately say, "oh look at this."

00:23:08.566 --> 00:23:13.608
I mean really it is impossible to understand

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.317
how the human mind has really woven their yarns

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:19.691
all around and made these patterns

00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:22.192
to ruin themselves and ruin others.

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:33.150
So to worship Yogeshwara we must know

00:23:33.192 --> 00:23:40.234
that our relationships with everyone in this world

00:23:40.275 --> 00:23:42.399
has to be pure.

00:23:42.399 --> 00:23:49.109
He played lots of things in His lifetime.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.025
The time when He came,

00:23:52.067 --> 00:23:58.275
the whole country was absolutely drowned

00:23:58.317 --> 00:24:01.942
into fanatic ideas about religion.

00:24:01.983 --> 00:24:07.566
If Freud was there he would have said,

00:24:07.608 --> 00:24:11.359
"oh this is all nonsense" you see, "What's wrong? Go ahead."

00:24:11.359 --> 00:24:16.275
Krishna did not do that.

00:24:16.275 --> 00:24:22.983
He wanted to break all the nonsensical shackles

00:24:23.025 --> 00:24:30.025
of traditions and shackles of false fanaticism.

00:24:30.067 --> 00:24:35.067
But He did it in a very beautiful manner

00:24:35.109 --> 00:24:39.067
keeping the relationship absolutely pure.

00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:44.359
Now people ask questions,

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:46.858
"Mother, was He married to Radha?"

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.775
You know He's eternally married to Her, doesn't matter.

00:24:49.817 --> 00:24:53.608
But He actually performed the marriage

00:24:53.608 --> 00:24:59.775
just the day He was born. He was brought by His father

00:24:59.775 --> 00:25:04.858
across the river and put down on the bank of the river,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.359
when Shri Brahmadeva himself came on this earth.

00:25:09.399 --> 00:25:13.359
That's why He wears a yellow thing, always,

00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:18.359
as a blessing from Brahmadeva to cover His lower part,

00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:23.733
lower than the waist with a cloth. That's the sign.

00:25:23.733 --> 00:25:26.525
That's why He always wears yellow.

00:25:26.566 --> 00:25:34.775
He himself came, made Him into man and married Him to Radhaji.

00:25:34.817 --> 00:25:43.192
Then again He became a child just to appear to be a child.

00:25:43.192 --> 00:25:45.483
Somebody may appear to be a child.

00:25:45.483 --> 00:25:48.109
To some of you I appear to you to be a sixteen-year-old girl

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.400
as you say, but I'm not.

00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:54.817
While I may be, according to counting,

00:25:54.817 --> 00:25:58.192
might be sixty years of age, but I'm not.

00:25:58.234 --> 00:26:04.733
My age is eternal. I can't say what age is Mine.

00:26:04.733 --> 00:26:11.441
It could be two years old or it could be absolutelyancient.

00:26:11.483 --> 00:26:13.566
It could be anything.

00:26:13.566 --> 00:26:21.942
So in His whole life, whatever He did,

00:26:21.983 --> 00:26:25.359
He did with the purity of understanding.

00:26:25.399 --> 00:26:28.109
So Radhaji was married to Him first.

00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:35.317
And afterwards when He came as a child,

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:40.400
when He was a child, He did all kinds of pranks and things.

00:26:40.441 --> 00:26:43.109
It was nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.608
It was not sitting like this and seriously telling about things.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.109
But with little bit here and there

00:26:49.109 --> 00:26:56.650
He tried to improve their chakras and raise their Kundalinis.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.359
Of course realization was not possible in a game.

00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:03.983
You cannot do it. Supposing I just play about with you

00:27:04.025 --> 00:27:06.858
you cannot get your realization

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.359
because at the Sahastrara stage

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:12.900
you have to completely recognize.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:24.400
It has to be a game of serenity.

00:27:24.441 --> 00:27:29.608
Of course, you can just raise your hand

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.150
and give realization to people.

00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:34.942
But you have to bring them to serene level.

00:27:34.983 --> 00:27:39.566
If you just came andsaid, "alright, you now play about",

00:27:39.608 --> 00:27:41.900
it would be all finished.

00:27:41.942 --> 00:27:43.942
You have to sit down and meditate.

00:27:43.942 --> 00:27:47.483
Though He has said it in Geeta you have to do it.

00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:52.067
So one could not say that all the time if you are playing,

00:27:52.067 --> 00:27:54.150
if you are just singing songs,

00:27:54.150 --> 00:28:00.025
or if you are in a very happy mood, a mirthful mood,

00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:03.067
then it's the end of Sahaja Yoga. It is not.

00:28:03.067 --> 00:28:06.067
It's a serious matter.

00:28:06.067 --> 00:28:10.317
So He did not give them realization

00:28:10.359 --> 00:28:13.317
but He reduced the tension on their minds

00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:19.858
of the so-called dharma and its shackles of fanaticism

00:28:19.858 --> 00:28:24.650
and He made it loose and then He wanted them

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:29.025
to understand that dharma is not

00:28:29.067 --> 00:28:32.525
going to enslave you.

00:28:32.566 --> 00:28:34.525
You have to rise above the dharma --

00:28:34.566 --> 00:28:38.942
become dharma itself.

00:28:38.983 --> 00:28:51.900
But Yogeshwara is to be worshipped with pure heart.

00:28:51.942 --> 00:29:00.566
In this atmosphere it''s difficult, I know.

00:29:00.608 --> 00:29:05.025
You just go out and you see a horrid thing there.

00:29:05.025 --> 00:29:07.608
You open any page of the magazine,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:11.483
there''s another horrid thing. Anywhere you advertise Me

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:15.608
the next page I turn I find a discotheque nonsense

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.817
going on there. I mean what can you do,

00:29:17.817 --> 00:29:22.150
you just can't help it. And all this is on, I mean,

00:29:22.192 --> 00:29:27.441
if you look at it - how gross, dirty, filthy the whole thing is.

00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:32.733
To add to problems, psychologists have come forward.

00:29:32.775 --> 00:29:37.150
They themselves are affected by their methods

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.192
and everything, they are so possessed

00:29:39.234 --> 00:29:46.650
and their sense about morality is absolutely in complete confusion.

00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:48.109
No doubt about it.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.234
You know Freud, what happened to him?

00:29:50.275 --> 00:29:52.566
He was having relations with his mother.

00:29:52.608 --> 00:29:54.733
He couldn't even understand, I mean imagine

00:29:54.733 --> 00:29:57.858
what a adharmi he must be, horrible wretched fellow,

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.775
he did not even have that purity to understand

00:30:01.817 --> 00:30:04.234
relationship with a mother. I mean, imagine.

00:30:04.275 --> 00:30:08.067
It is such a clear-cut background of this man.

00:30:08.109 --> 00:30:10.942
Shows how wrong he must have been.

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:16.150
Because what was in him, such filth, such dirt,

00:30:16.192 --> 00:30:21.817
that he could not even look at his mother with clear heart.

00:30:21.858 --> 00:30:25.858
Must be all mud in his eyes or I don't know what he be like,

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.275
to see things like that.

00:30:28.317 --> 00:30:36.109
You are shaking with my vibrations already.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:42.566
Now when we think of Him as Yogeshwara

00:30:42.608 --> 00:30:46.566
that means we are Yogis and He is our Ishwara.

00:30:46.608 --> 00:30:55.691
Ishwara is to be praised - Dhayaati??

00:30:55.733 --> 00:31:03.483
you have to praise Him. You have to praise Him

00:31:03.483 --> 00:31:09.441
for his quality as Yogeshwara because He is your Ishwara

00:31:09.441 --> 00:31:11.399
so you have to praise Him.

00:31:11.399 --> 00:31:14.359
Now what praise can we give Him.

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:20.359
Today He's born. What should we do

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:23.733
on such a great occasion when He is born?

00:31:23.775 --> 00:31:32.067
We have to decide that He is our Ishwara.

00:31:32.109 --> 00:31:40.067
He is the Ishwara aspect and if He is our Ishwara

00:31:40.067 --> 00:31:48.150
then we have to cleanse our attitude towards sex,

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:57.275
towards the gross way of life that we have developed,

00:31:57.317 --> 00:32:03.025
to just shun it and throw it away. Absolutely.

00:32:03.067 --> 00:32:06.067
There cannot be compromise on that

00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:15.150
otherwise you cannot be a yogi, you cannot be a yogi.

00:32:15.192 --> 00:32:19.317
You may become very powerful, maybe for the time being.

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:21.608
Because I play with you, you get ideas

00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:25.817
that you are very powerful and all that. But that's not true.

00:32:25.858 --> 00:32:32.150
As My name is Nirmala, as My name is purity --

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.109
you have to be pure yogis.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:41.109
Nobody says you should not marry.

00:32:41.109 --> 00:32:44.400
Nobody says you should not have proper sex relationships

00:32:44.441 --> 00:32:47.399
with you wives, that's not done.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.942
But that's one thing people may avoid and spoil it.

00:32:52.983 --> 00:32:58.691
But the other thing, which is the most important, is your attention

00:32:58.691 --> 00:33:06.566
to be pure of sex attractions [of] any kind.

00:33:06.566 --> 00:33:11.234
Your attention should never go to anything like that.

00:33:11.234 --> 00:33:24.775
You see to Me, I mean I'm now supposed to be an old lady, I don't see things

00:33:24.775 --> 00:33:28.942
which normally people see. This is something surprising.

00:33:28.983 --> 00:33:32.192
You see, I see something and I don't know what's happening

00:33:32.234 --> 00:33:34.691
and everybody laughs at me in the house you see.

00:33:34.733 --> 00:33:37.483
They don't understand that - how I didn't see the point.

00:33:37.483 --> 00:33:39.691
But I don't understand these jokes

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:42.817
because the attention never goes into these dirty things,

00:33:42.858 --> 00:33:45.983
never goes into these things. I can't see,

00:33:46.025 --> 00:33:48.441
till somebody tells me that 'this is this.'

00:33:48.483 --> 00:33:50.817
But they have to explain ten times.

00:33:50.817 --> 00:33:57.025
So all these sophisticated methods of nonsense

00:33:57.025 --> 00:34:02.441
and the filth and the dirt that we have accumulated here,

00:34:02.441 --> 00:34:05.525
please wash off your hands of that.

00:34:05.566 --> 00:34:09.483
That's one thing, will not be tolerated in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:09.525 --> 00:34:12.109
Every Sahaja Yogi I must tell.

00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:18.109
Itself, sex cannot be enjoyed, if you live like this.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.817
You cannot! You don't enjoy sex at all in this country.

00:34:20.858 --> 00:34:24.192
None of them.

00:34:24.234 --> 00:34:26.650
Only in a country, where people are innocent,

00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:29.025
you can enjoy. If you were enjoying,

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:31.067
you would not run from one woman to another woman,

00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:33.733
you would not run from man to woman and man to man

00:34:33.775 --> 00:34:36.983
and then to all donkeys all those things.

00:34:37.025 --> 00:34:44.817
It is impossible that you could be a yogi

00:34:44.817 --> 00:34:47.775
with all these dirty ideas.

00:34:47.817 --> 00:34:54.441
And then you cannot mature,

00:34:54.483 --> 00:34:56.441
even a normal person won't mature.

00:34:56.483 --> 00:34:58.566
In India a person who is about 40 years,

00:34:58.566 --> 00:35:00.733
he becomes a matured father.

00:35:00.733 --> 00:35:03.067
You leave any girls with him, anybody with him,

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:04.983
it will not even get into his head

00:35:05.025 --> 00:35:08.150
that there's something could exist between them.

00:35:08.192 --> 00:35:10.109
Once you are married it should not.

00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:11.942
I mean I have seen my two son-inlaws,

00:35:11.983 --> 00:35:14.150
they never get these ideas into their heads.

00:35:14.192 --> 00:35:25.483
So try to put your attention onto proper track

00:35:25.525 --> 00:35:28.691
because your Ishwara is Yogeshwara.

00:35:28.733 --> 00:35:31.566
Now the other side of Shri Krishna

00:35:31.566 --> 00:35:33.775
people do not know.

00:35:33.817 --> 00:35:38.192
It's a play, all right. But He is Samhara-shakti.

00:35:38.192 --> 00:35:45.983
He is the power of destruction. It's very good,

00:35:45.983 --> 00:35:49.983
He's there, comes with everything to protect us.

00:35:50.025 --> 00:35:55.150
But He also has got Sudarshan chakra. Sudarshan,

00:35:55.192 --> 00:36:00.234
'su' means auspicious, "darshan" is vision.

00:36:00.275 --> 00:36:04.234
He gives us auspicious visions, you see.

00:36:04.234 --> 00:36:09.234
If you try tricks with Him, that goes round your neck

00:36:09.234 --> 00:36:14.942
and then you have auspicious darshans of yourself,

00:36:14.983 --> 00:36:17.775
that you are hanging in the air somewhere.

00:36:17.817 --> 00:36:24.192
So Shri Krishna's methods; on one side

00:36:24.234 --> 00:36:30.691
He is a "Leelamayi", He is compassionate,

00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:36.775
He stands by His bhaktas, He comes on this earth

00:36:36.817 --> 00:36:42.399
to revive the dharma. If the dharma goes down,

00:36:42.399 --> 00:36:47.192
He comes to uplift it. "Yada yada hi dharmasya" --

00:36:47.234 --> 00:36:50.317
"whenever there is the decline of dharma."

00:36:50.359 --> 00:36:53.109
But dharma doesn't mean only corruption,

00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:55.942
it doesn't mean only honesty and dishonesty.

00:36:55.983 --> 00:37:01.733
Basically it means Mooladhara.

00:37:01.775 --> 00:37:07.109
That is the beginning of the end.

00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:11.608
And He comes to - "sa sansthapana arthaya" --

00:37:11.608 --> 00:37:16.858
again to establish into the holy state.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:22.400
He comes on this earth to raise human beings to that level.

00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:37.566
This is what He does. So if we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:37:37.608 --> 00:37:41.775
we are part and parcel of His Being.

00:37:41.775 --> 00:37:48.900
We are instruments into His working.

00:37:48.942 --> 00:37:52.483
So we have to establish dharma, but the one,

00:37:52.483 --> 00:37:54.817
who has no dharma within himself,

00:37:54.858 --> 00:37:58.150
what dharma is he going to establish anywhere?

00:37:58.192 --> 00:38:04.025
You have come on this earth to establish the dharma

00:38:04.067 --> 00:38:09.192
in its holy aspect. Not like Roman Catholic church

00:38:09.192 --> 00:38:12.399
or another Pentecostal church

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.691
or these Hindu religious activities

00:38:17.691 --> 00:38:19.733
or these Hindu temples

00:38:19.733 --> 00:38:22.399
or the Islamic state.

00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:27.109
But dharma in its pure state you have to establish.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.900
But if there is no dharma within us,

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:33.025
how are we going to establish?

00:38:33.025 --> 00:38:35.691
So He comes on this earth every time

00:38:35.733 --> 00:38:38.900
to establish dharma at Vishnu level.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.234
But at Shri Krishna level, He comes at Yogeshwara.

00:38:42.275 --> 00:38:47.691
This is the point many people have not even thought out.

00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:50.441
For Vishnu they may not say Yogeshwara.

00:38:50.483 --> 00:38:56.234
That is He is the Ishwara of Yogis,

00:38:56.234 --> 00:39:10.483
as Ganesha is the Ishwara of the Ganas.

00:39:10.525 --> 00:39:17.608
You see, it's the Ganapati [who] looks after the Ganas,

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:22.983
and He is our Ishwara.

00:39:23.025 --> 00:39:27.441
That is we have to have Him as our ideal.

00:39:27.483 --> 00:39:33.150
With the understanding that today is the day --

00:39:33.192 --> 00:39:35.817
in the night about 12 o'clock,

00:39:35.817 --> 00:39:39.566
now must be about 12 o'clock in India also, about that,

00:39:39.566 --> 00:39:51.441
so it matches - He was born at this time in the night,

00:39:51.483 --> 00:39:55.775
because it was real night symbolically,

00:39:55.817 --> 00:40:00.900
under horrible circumstances.

00:40:00.942 --> 00:40:07.775
He came, at a time,

00:40:07.775 --> 00:40:15.608
when His own birth was very dangerously placed.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:21.900
He was saved, and then, in His very childhood

00:40:21.942 --> 00:40:33.359
He killed Rakshasas. But all this He did

00:40:33.399 --> 00:40:34.942
because He was an incarnation.

00:40:34.983 --> 00:40:38.399
Nobody is asking you to go and kill Rakshasas. Is it?

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.483
In Sahaja Yoga did I ask you to go and kill some Rakshasas?

00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:46.025
On the contrary I'm just saying -keep yourself protected.

00:40:46.067 --> 00:40:53.942
There was a Rakshasin who came, her name was Putana

00:40:53.942 --> 00:41:01.067
and she wanted to put poison through her breast

00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:05.275
and she took the child and started nursing.

00:41:05.317 --> 00:41:09.566
He was a little baby. And when He started sucking her breast,

00:41:09.608 --> 00:41:18.150
she came out in her true form and she died.

00:41:18.192 --> 00:41:23.983
Because He was, after all, He was an incarnation.

00:41:23.983 --> 00:41:26.192
Can anyone of us do that?

00:41:28.775 --> 00:41:30.025
I mean the Sahaja Yogis?

00:41:30.067 --> 00:41:37.275
Then as a child He was very mischievous.

00:41:37.275 --> 00:41:47.067
He ate some clay, I think.

00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:50.150
Whether He ate it or not, His mother doubted.

00:41:50.192 --> 00:41:52.067
She got very angry and she said:

00:41:52.067 --> 00:41:54.983
"Open your mouth, I would like to see, did you eat that?"

00:41:54.983 --> 00:41:57.817
When He opened the mouth - she saw a complete universe

00:41:57.858 --> 00:42:04.608
moving in His throat - because Vishuddhi chakra She saw.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:08.234
Because she could see. She had power to see, she could see.

00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:11.900
Not...everybody can't see that.

00:42:11.942 --> 00:42:16.150
Those who have powers can see.

00:42:16.192 --> 00:42:21.359
We don't even have the powers as much as she had

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:24.608
to see the universe.

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:32.359
So one has to understand that first, as Sahaja Yogis,

00:42:32.359 --> 00:42:37.400
we get the powers much before we have passed,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:44.067
really, the test of Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:46.109
Just the other way round it is.

00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:50.400
In the university they will first give you the degree,

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.858
the certificate and then you will get a job,

00:42:54.900 --> 00:43:00.858
may not get job also, these days!

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:07.317
Here you get the job first of all, you get all the powers

00:43:07.317 --> 00:43:12.109
you are paid for, but the degree is still not sure.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.858
Anybody walks about as Sahaja Yogi,

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.858
next day I find him coming out with something else.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:25.983
They are certified Sahaja Yogis, I have seen.

00:43:26.025 --> 00:43:33.483
They become afterwards certified something else.

00:43:33.525 --> 00:43:37.608
God knows how. So this is the thing of Sahaja Yoga

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.317
that you can become a Sahaja Yogi

00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:44.317
even without having the real certificate.

00:43:44.317 --> 00:43:49.983
It's definitely so. And the certificate is given,

00:43:50.025 --> 00:43:52.608
as you know, by Lord Jesus Christ.

00:43:52.608 --> 00:43:57.608
He doesn't give certificate easily.

00:43:57.608 --> 00:44:02.900
That way He is very, very strict.

00:44:02.942 --> 00:44:08.483
He is not going to give you. He''s extremely strict

00:44:08.525 --> 00:44:11.775
as far as the Sahaja Yogis are concerned,

00:44:11.775 --> 00:44:13.775
He''s not going to give you certificates,

00:44:13.775 --> 00:44:19.150
He's going to judge you. And what is His basic nature, is He's innocence.

00:44:19.192 --> 00:44:23.525
He is going to judge you on your innocence.

00:44:23.566 --> 00:44:27.608
If you are a superego you can say,

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.400
Oh I got possessed by a bhoot, you see,

00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:32.400
and the bhoot did this. So He will say:

00:44:32.441 --> 00:44:36.441
"Alright you go to the bhoot for the certificate not to me."

00:44:36.441 --> 00:44:40.608
Even when Yogis fight, I've seen, they tell me,

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.733
"Mother, must be my bhoot and his bhoot must have fought".

00:44:43.775 --> 00:44:45.900
And what were you doing?

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:54.400
They were witnessing it like Shri Krishnas!

00:44:54.441 --> 00:44:59.192
With all these things happening,

00:44:59.234 --> 00:45:10.525
I get a big promise sometimes, that, "Mother, alright,

00:45:10.525 --> 00:45:13.359
now we are not going to quarrel,

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:18.192
there's not going to be any problem, you rest assured,

00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:24.733
we'll all live in harmony." Then suddenly I find

00:45:24.733 --> 00:45:27.275
that somebody is fighting for a bathroom

00:45:27.317 --> 00:45:30.566
or for a soap or something like that.

00:45:30.608 --> 00:45:34.525
That's not for a Sahaja Yogi to behave.

00:45:34.525 --> 00:45:40.359
First of all you have to be a satisfied person,

00:45:40.359 --> 00:45:45.691
a person of great dignity and forbearance,

00:45:45.733 --> 00:45:49.317
otherwise what are you going to bear?

00:45:49.317 --> 00:46:01.566
"I love him very much, but he should not have taken my towel."

00:46:01.608 --> 00:46:07.691
For small, small things if you go on insisting,

00:46:07.733 --> 00:46:15.150
be sure you are not a yogi as yet.

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:18.192
If you are fighting for things,

00:46:18.234 --> 00:46:20.983
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:46:21.025 --> 00:46:22.441
What do these things matter?

00:46:22.483 --> 00:46:25.025
I never say anything about anything, do I?

00:46:25.067 --> 00:46:27.150
That "I must have this, I must have that,

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:28.775
how did you prepare this?"

00:46:28.817 --> 00:46:31.525
Though it is sometimes really wrong and unprotocolish.

00:46:31.525 --> 00:46:34.275
I never say that, "Why did you bring these bananas,

00:46:34.317 --> 00:46:37.858
they are no good, I'm not going to eat!" Did I say so?

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:42.733
I mean, even the flowers you use may not be auspicious.

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:45.608
I know certain flowers should not be used for puja.

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.608
But I have not opened my mouth. If I have to tell you,

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.691
I just tell you because you have to know it

00:46:51.733 --> 00:46:56.025
for your own good, not for my good.

00:46:56.067 --> 00:47:04.109
So, on a day like this, which is a day of great joy

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.817
to all the world, and happiness,

00:47:06.817 --> 00:47:11.192
you should know one thing, that, when Christ was born,

00:47:11.192 --> 00:47:14.608
he was born in a very humble place,

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.858
but when Krishna was born,

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:25.317
He was born in the most horrifying circumstances.

00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:31.775
Same is the case of Sahaja Yogis today.

00:47:31.817 --> 00:47:34.441
It's a thing of great joy and jubilation, no doubt,

00:47:34.441 --> 00:47:37.441
that He came and he gave us His Vishuddi power,

00:47:37.441 --> 00:47:40.359
but we must understand that we are born

00:47:40.359 --> 00:47:42.942
in a very precarious time.

00:47:42.983 --> 00:47:46.025
I've been saying this so many times.

00:47:46.067 --> 00:47:49.942
There''s not only one Kamsa there. So many are there.

00:47:49.942 --> 00:47:52.566
There''s a big fight going on,

00:47:52.608 --> 00:47:55.817
in that you people are here in charge.

00:47:55.817 --> 00:47:59.775
You are the ones employed by God, you are the ones,

00:47:59.775 --> 00:48:07.983
who have been given this great work. You have powers.

00:48:08.025 --> 00:48:10.400
Like Shri Krishna, when He was crossing,

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.858
as a child was put in a basket

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.650
and the father was carrying the child in the basket

00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:20.067
and when His feet touched the river Yamuna,

00:48:20.067 --> 00:48:22.317
the river went down.

00:48:22.359 --> 00:48:24.858
Because she was in spate, she went down.

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.566
In the same way, you too have all these powers.

00:48:28.566 --> 00:48:31.359
Krishna has given you all the powers.

00:48:31.399 --> 00:48:35.775
Though they will be really known to you,

00:48:35.817 --> 00:48:42.359
when only Lord Jesus Christ accepts you as Sahaja Yogis.

00:48:42.399 --> 00:48:48.399
That's important because you have to be innocent.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:52.275
Purity must be brought in.

00:48:52.275 --> 00:48:57.566
Last time on this great day we had 16 marriages.

00:48:57.566 --> 00:49:00.608
They came out well most of them.

00:49:00.608 --> 00:49:05.067
Not all, but most of them were very good

00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:06.983
and I am really very happy

00:49:07.025 --> 00:49:10.483
that such good couples came on that day.

00:49:10.483 --> 00:49:12.067
It was very auspicious.

00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:21.650
And marriage gives you a sense of purity

00:49:21.691 --> 00:49:29.525
and that's why our marriage is important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:29.525 --> 00:49:33.691
But that's not the last word, like this is not

00:49:33.691 --> 00:49:35.525
a hunting ground for everyone,

00:49:35.525 --> 00:49:38.608
"I'm finding out this husband or I'm finding out that husband."

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:42.275
That must be stopped completely. Leave it to Sahaja.

00:49:42.275 --> 00:49:46.234
You are not to search out your wives in Sahaja Yogis,

00:49:46.234 --> 00:49:49.400
no, not at all, nor husbands! Leave it!

00:49:49.441 --> 00:49:57.483
If you have done something like that, then you may be harmed.

00:49:57.483 --> 00:50:00.817
Don't do any searching or any thing.

00:50:00.858 --> 00:50:04.733
A time will come, when you will find,

00:50:04.733 --> 00:50:07.900
I will myself tell you "alright, marry this person."

00:50:07.942 --> 00:50:10.775
It's still on among Sahaja Yogis, I have known people

00:50:10.817 --> 00:50:14.775
who just take out people and try courting.

00:50:14.817 --> 00:50:17.817
That's not needed in Sahaja Yoga, no courting needed.

00:50:17.817 --> 00:50:19.525
See, we have got so many cases,

00:50:19.566 --> 00:50:21.317
where the marriage was decided like that,

00:50:21.317 --> 00:50:23.192
they married, they are very happily married,

00:50:23.192 --> 00:50:25.983
than people who had courting, this thing, selections,

00:50:26.025 --> 00:50:29.775
and nominations and elections and everything.

00:50:29.775 --> 00:50:35.317
And after that you find within 2 days they are out for divorce.

00:50:35.317 --> 00:50:39.608
In Sahaja Yoga it is spontaneous,instantaneous.

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.234
You don't have to do all these things

00:50:43.275 --> 00:50:45.942
with all these deliberations what have you achieved?

00:50:45.983 --> 00:50:50.441
It's just spontaneous. So you don't have to worry

00:50:50.441 --> 00:50:53.399
and you don't have to think. You don't have to say,

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.942
that "Oh Mother, I have to find a girl for me"

00:50:55.983 --> 00:51:00.525
You see, you don't! Leave it me, it's my headache.

00:51:00.566 --> 00:51:04.234
But once you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

00:51:04.275 --> 00:51:06.566
you must know what it means.

00:51:06.608 --> 00:51:09.234
And both of you must work it out properly

00:51:09.275 --> 00:51:11.691
and it is for the good of everyone.

00:51:11.691 --> 00:51:20.900
Should be good for everyone.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:33.317
So, this is what it is. And I would say that, on this day,

00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:37.317
let us take one vow:

00:52:00.566 --> 00:52:06.192
To decide that we will be worshippingYogeshwara.

00:52:06.234 --> 00:52:08.067
We have to worship Him.

00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:14.858
Means our relationships about these things has to be clean.

00:52:14.858 --> 00:52:18.983
We should not get involved into it, it''s nothing important.

00:52:19.025 --> 00:52:23.525
It's just like having your food,

00:52:23.566 --> 00:52:31.983
you have to be with your wife. Is the need of the body.

00:52:32.025 --> 00:52:44.900
You don't eat from the dirty plates, do you?

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.109
You want to have a clean plate.

00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:51.566
You want to have a plate, which you have used yourself,

00:52:51.566 --> 00:52:56.399
your own plate that should be clean.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.275
If you could have a cleaner plate, you would like to have,

00:52:59.317 --> 00:53:01.359
if you can get a silver plate, you would like.

00:53:01.399 --> 00:53:04.983
If it is even a golden plate is even better.

00:53:04.983 --> 00:53:09.025
In the same way, we should also have

00:53:09.067 --> 00:53:15.400
a very pure understanding that, it is the need of the body,

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.275
the body which can be very subtle.

00:53:19.317 --> 00:53:26.399
So let us not just go on shopping for it everywhere,

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.650
looking out, "oh this is that, this one that one,"

00:53:28.691 --> 00:53:37.317
then discard this one. It has to come to you specially.

00:53:37.359 --> 00:53:43.109
And all great things happen suddenly. Always.

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:51.317
The more deliberations you will have, the worse it will be.

00:53:51.359 --> 00:53:58.775
So don't form ideas, don't plan about it.

00:53:58.817 --> 00:54:02.234
It will happen. It''s not so important.

00:54:02.234 --> 00:54:09.483
That will give you a lot of purity. Your ego will be perfect.

00:54:09.483 --> 00:54:16.691
I know of someone, whom nobody wanted to marry.

00:54:16.691 --> 00:54:21.400
And when I suggested someone,

00:54:21.441 --> 00:54:24.275
who agreed with great difficulty, she said,

00:54:24.275 --> 00:54:34.441
"I don't want to marry." It's funny. It is very funny that,

00:54:34.483 --> 00:54:36.983
the way our ego is working out. Because, you see,

00:54:36.983 --> 00:54:40.691
when we are looking at another person for marriage or anything,

00:54:40.733 --> 00:54:43.317
we are not thinking of Yogeshwara.

00:54:43.317 --> 00:54:45.942
We don't think that it is Yogeshwara,

00:54:45.983 --> 00:54:48.566
who will do everything for us, we are thinking,

00:54:48.608 --> 00:54:51.650
we have to do it. Alright, so we go ahead with this,

00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:58.150
that, and spoil our attention completely.

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:02.983
""Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja."

00:55:02.983 --> 00:55:09.275
In this part of your decision, if you can leave it to God,

00:55:09.317 --> 00:55:17.525
it would be better. I tell you, if you can do that,

00:55:17.525 --> 00:55:21.691
you have crossed your ego half way through.

00:55:21.733 --> 00:55:27.109
Because at least 50% ego is used in this.

00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:29.942
In the West especially.

00:55:29.942 --> 00:55:33.067
In India this question doesn't arise much.

00:55:33.067 --> 00:55:38.399
Because the parents can't decide here, nobody can decide,

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.650
you have to decide yourself. It's a big responsibility

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:45.109
and a big thing for you.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:49.067
So 50% of your ego problem will be finished,

00:55:49.067 --> 00:55:56.858
I tell you, once you just give up this responsibility

00:55:56.900 --> 00:56:08.525
of choosing a bride or a bridegroom for yourself. Just forget it.

00:56:08.525 --> 00:56:15.234
Such a waste of energy, I tell you.

00:56:15.275 --> 00:56:21.900
When I see people, young people, doing all these things

00:56:21.942 --> 00:56:25.441
I wish they could understand the value of their lives,

00:56:25.441 --> 00:56:32.275
the esteem of their lives. Their Ishwara is Shri Krishna.

00:56:32.317 --> 00:56:43.234
He''s not Ishwara of everyone, only of yogis.

00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:45.150
Anybody else who tries to say

00:56:45.192 --> 00:56:49.441
"Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" will get throat cancer.

00:56:49.483 --> 00:56:55.025
Anybody who tries to call Him

00:56:55.067 --> 00:57:02.400
who is not a yogi gets a problem in the throat, you know.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:13.900
So He is only available to you, He is only your Ishwara.

00:57:13.942 --> 00:57:22.817
He manifests only for you. He is your own.

00:57:22.858 --> 00:57:28.525
He won't act for any Dick, Tom and Harry.

00:57:28.566 --> 00:57:30.483
Maybe you might be a prime minister,

00:57:30.483 --> 00:57:33.566
you might be a king or queen, it makes no difference to him.

00:57:33.608 --> 00:57:38.817
To him only a yogi, only a yogi can call him.

00:57:38.817 --> 00:57:42.983
Only a yogi can ask for his help.

00:57:42.983 --> 00:57:46.359
He is not bothered about anybody else.

00:57:46.399 --> 00:57:55.691
And if a yogi recommends, then only He can look after someone.

00:57:55.691 --> 00:57:59.359
Otherwise He will not bother about him.

00:57:59.399 --> 00:58:12.983
So He is actually your own king, who is always there,

00:58:13.025 --> 00:58:20.234
looking after you. When you call Him,

00:58:20.275 --> 00:58:27.775
He comes with all His powers to support you.

00:58:27.817 --> 00:58:35.067
But you have to be a yogi. If you are not a yogi,

00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:41.608
which is of course certified by Lord Jesus Christ,

00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:44.858
then Krishna has nothing to do with you.

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:48.399
So before the entry to Shri Krishna,

00:58:48.399 --> 00:58:52.192
though He is not the one who is going to judge your innocence,

00:58:52.192 --> 00:58:59.566
in the door resides Lord Jesus Christ.

00:58:59.608 --> 00:59:02.858
When you get in, then it's all right.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:09.483
But to get in, also is difficult because He''s always throwing you out.

00:59:09.483 --> 00:59:18.650
Shri Krishna has said, that "You will be the ...",

00:59:18.691 --> 00:59:23.817
to Jesus, He said, "You will be the Adhara, the support of the universe."

00:59:23.858 --> 00:59:26.441
Means the innocence is your support, innocence.

00:59:26.483 --> 00:59:29.192
If that innocence is not established in you,

00:59:29.234 --> 00:59:36.399
then Shri Krishna cannot help you. He is helpless.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.192
Because you don't become a yogi and

00:59:39.192 --> 00:59:44.067
so He''s not your Ishwara any more.

00:59:44.067 --> 00:59:47.399
Now one may say that, "Mother the Agnya chakra

00:59:47.399 --> 00:59:51.942
is here and He is here," Alright,

00:59:51.942 --> 00:59:59.234
but Agnya chakra when you cross, here he is.

00:59:59.275 --> 01:00:05.942
When, you cross your Agnya chakra,

01:00:05.983 --> 01:00:10.399
that means He is sitting there and the Virata is sitting here.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:17.650
So unless and until you pass your Agnya Chakra

01:00:17.691 --> 01:00:23.025
properly, you can't get to Virat.

01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:27.067
And Yogeshwara is the Virat.

01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:34.983
That is the aspect we have to worship, we have to worship!

01:00:34.983 --> 01:00:39.775
Worshipping doesn't mean that you become that person.

01:00:39.817 --> 01:00:42.691
You worship Me, you don't become Me.

01:00:42.691 --> 01:00:45.275
What do you do, when you worship?

01:00:45.317 --> 01:00:51.483
You surrender all that is not liked by Me,

01:00:51.525 --> 01:01:05.566
in the fire, in the water, outside. In the elements you throw them away.

01:01:05.608 --> 01:01:11.608
And you bring to Me your heart. That''s what it is, worshipping.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:15.150
In the same way we have to worship the aspect

01:01:15.192 --> 01:01:21.400
of Shri Krishna in me, which is Yogeshwara.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.608
I am Yogeshwara.

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:28.025
Things do not come into My head at all,

01:01:28.067 --> 01:01:30.359
I don't see things like that.

01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:32.817
I don't know what is temptation is, what attraction is,

01:01:32.817 --> 01:01:37.192
I just don't understand. On the contrary

01:01:37.234 --> 01:01:41.359
these things repel me, repel absolutely, I vomit.

01:01:41.399 --> 01:01:47.025
Even to hear these things, I don't want to open My ears,

01:01:47.025 --> 01:01:51.275
My ears become deaf. I can't hear these things.

01:01:51.317 --> 01:01:53.900
I can't understand any dirty jokes.

01:01:53.942 --> 01:01:57.150
I have no brains [for this]. My brains refuse to understand.

01:01:57.192 --> 01:02:06.775
I become a dull person, absolutely. Deaf and dumb.

01:02:06.817 --> 01:02:09.483
People have written books and books on these things,

01:02:09.483 --> 01:02:11.150
I don't know what they must be writing.

01:02:11.192 --> 01:02:14.109
What is there to write on this?

01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:21.608
So today we have to know that our personal life

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:24.983
has to be extremely clean.

01:02:24.983 --> 01:02:27.608
We face ourselves every moment

01:02:27.608 --> 01:02:29.650
and find out within ourselves --

01:02:29.691 --> 01:02:33.150
are we really worshipping Yogeshwara within ourselves

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:39.109
who resides within us? Let us develop that purity.

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:45.025
Then innocence will be established in our eyes.

01:02:45.067 --> 01:02:49.359
We'll be innocent. The eyes will speak of innocence.

01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:53.192
What's the use of having eyes,

01:02:53.234 --> 01:02:56.858
which are all the time shifting,

01:02:56.858 --> 01:02:59.150
you don't know where they are going, wobbling eyes,

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.150
you see, like this, like this, like this.

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:03.900
You can't trust these eyes at all.

01:03:03.942 --> 01:03:09.691
But the eyes, which are innocent,

01:03:09.733 --> 01:03:18.399
receive nothing they just give. They just give.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.900
Innocence is very penetrating, very purifying,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:32.109
very soothing and very beautiful.

01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:39.775
We have to become beautiful people.

01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:46.483
Today I said on these things

01:03:46.483 --> 01:03:53.025
because I'm sometimes disturbed the way people

01:03:53.067 --> 01:03:58.900
don't understand that purity of sex life

01:03:58.942 --> 01:04:03.192
is so important to Sahaja Yoga, especially in the West.

01:04:03.192 --> 01:04:06.733
People don't understand.

01:04:06.775 --> 01:04:11.234
To Indians this lecture has no meaning, they will think,

01:04:11.234 --> 01:04:13.733
"Why Mother is wasting Her energy so much?"

01:04:13.775 --> 01:04:16.275
Because they don't understand.

01:04:16.275 --> 01:04:22.067
But to Me it is very important here.

01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:30.900
Whatever I have seen and heard and see all around.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:37.650
I think today's message should be of Yogeshwara.

01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:42.025
Let us worship Yogeshwara with our heart.

01:04:42.067 --> 01:04:43.983
When you worship Me today,

01:04:44.025 --> 01:04:49.441
it should be the worship of Yogeshwara and nothing else.

01:04:49.441 --> 01:04:53.525
May God bless you.
