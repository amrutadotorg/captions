00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,880
Public Program  25 April 2001
 Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey)

2
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,760
.... we have false pride,

3
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,366
now we have jealousy

4
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:18,500
we have attachments.

5
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:25,745
People are corrupt because
they are attached to their children,

6
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,558
they want to make money for them,
so  they are corrupt.

7
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:44,124
And we have  also attraction.

8
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:48,078
We are attracted supposing somebody is attracted,

9
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:53,130
  say towards good clothes somebody attracted or good house

10
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:55,306
attractions.

11
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,207
We cannot explain.

12
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:18,239
We cannot explain why we do that.

13
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:27,262
Why we suffer from all these enemies we don't know.

14
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,393
Once you become the spirit,

15
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:40,919
spirit drops out everything,

16
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:43,799
it is so clear, so clean,

17
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:48,377
and  what is the spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

18
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:07,390
The spirit , that is within you.

19
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:13,396
once it  enlightens you, you become such a wonderful person,

20
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:18,341
such a nice person and you develop this spirituality.

21
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:35,268
What, actually what happens is

22
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,818
that when  Kundalini rises

23
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:42,594
your spirit starts emitting vibrations

24
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,342
spiritual vibrations on your central nervous system.

25
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:05,123
And you start feeling cool breeze on your hands

26
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:07,992
out of your fontanel bone area.

27
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:26,175
And then this  fingers which represent

28
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:31,088
the centers within you  starts speaking telling you
 what's wrong and what's kind.

29
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:52,870
Also they tell you about others, 
what is wrong with the others.

30
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:05,804
This connection with the divine
gives you this blessing

31
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:09,472
that you  know what is wrong with you
and what is wrong with others.

32
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,502
Even the doctors will not tell you,

33
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:30,853
nobody can tell you, just now on your fingertips

34
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:47,407
So in the Kuran it says at the time of kıyam
 your hands will speak.

35
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:59,184
So this is the kiyam time, kiyamat is different.

36
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,433
[UNCLEAR]

37
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,021
Kıyamat and kıyama

38
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:12,544
Kyam because this is the last judgement.

39
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:22,919
Those who do not accept their self realisation,

40
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:29,664
and who don't get into the heavenly bliss of divinity,

41
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:34,311
they go to hell – that is the wisdom.

42
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:49,094
So, for you it is important that your hands must speak

43
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,898
and tell you about you and others.

44
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,897
That is how you are mussulman, otherwise you are not.

45
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,059
If your hands do not speak

46
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:18,150
than you are not a mussulman in surrendering.

47
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:28,433
It`s all said, it is all written in the Quran

48
00:07:28,453 --> 00:07:33,256
but once you be  able to read it after 
you have got your realization.

49
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:46,859
It is high time that you should realize

50
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:50,464
that we  have been following something so much

51
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:52,950
and why is it we are in trouble,

52
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,069
why we have not been able to achieve whatever is promised.

53
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,018
It is something missing

54
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:18,697
that so far we have not been able to

55
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,191
achieve what is doing promised.

56
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:49,036
You all can have your self realization.

57
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:57,242
Don’t have any fear about it and some

58
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:00,221
sort of funny ideas about it.

59
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:12,054
Because whatever will happen, you will feel it.

60
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:21,163
It`s not something imaginary.

61
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,651
It’s the actualization.

62
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:35,944
To the Christians I say this actualization of  baptism.

63
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:49,552
So, it's your chance now all of you so many have  come

64
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,997
to have that self realization.

65
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:05,644
It was prophesied that it will happen collectively.

66
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,300
And so, you all deserve it.

67
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:15,991
And you should have it.

68
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,053
Because İt is what  is promised.

69
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:30,164
So ultimately what happens

70
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:33,159
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

71
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,578
You become powerfull.

72
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,575
But you don't have ego.

73
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:54,293
And you know how you get help others

74
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:57,579
and yourself and help the family.

75
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,333
All of you can get  it.

76
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:18,580
I mean those who want can all get it ,
 it can't be forced [UNCLEAR].

77
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:33,782
Thus you will know what you are and also what othes are.

78
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:45,958
Many people have  been cured in sahaja yoga, no doubt.

79
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:49,101
We also have a hospital in India.

80
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:04,683
Where people are cured without any medicine
 with their own vibrations.

81
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:19,718
Moreover mentally there are so many people
 who have been cured.

82
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:29,564
And your problems are solved.

83
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:34,191
Because you get out  of your problems.

84
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:47,681
Will be amazed how miraculously
 you achieve such small small things

85
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:50,740
which really look great [UNCLEAR] to begin with.

86
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,667
Every human being has a right  to get self realization.

87
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:16,919
All negative forces and energies  just 
drop out and run away.

88
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:30,359
Just like whether light comes in all darkness goes away.

89
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:38,682
It sometimes  people don't believe.

90
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:43,424
Because, they don't think they are
 capable of getting self realization.

91
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:58,472
But, I am sure tonight you will learn what you are.

92
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:10,340
Will be absolutely relaxed person and

93
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:15,292
the whole being  will be filled with joy and divine love.

94
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:30,364
It's not because of me, it's because of you.

95
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:44,247
You have once you have what only
 I have to open the window here.

96
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:55,050
That to you do because It is your desire,

97
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,885
to become your pure desire to be.

98
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:11,299
Otherwise no other desire is pure.

99
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:23,016
All economics is based on one point
 that no human desire is complete.

100
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,282
Today you want  to have one thing then
 you want to have another thing.

101
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,125
And you are never satisfied.

102
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,898
But this  is pure desire.

103
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:58,965
Kundalini is the energy of pure desire
 because the desire of our Almighty

104
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:11,305
So, when you get your realization,

105
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:17,158
you feel absolutely satisfied and 
enjoy whatever you have.

106
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:32,323
And also you enjoy others and their things

107
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:36,539
without thinking that they don't belong to you.

108
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:52,726
The whole panorama changes

109
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:58,789
and you become a very universal personality.

110
00:17:06,203 --> 00:17:08,949
You really become global

111
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:14,386
and everybody who is in sahaja yoga are such great friends.

112
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:33,228
I'll give an example that
 Palestinians were fighting Israelis

113
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:38,050
and one of the Israeli fellow, telephoned  to me

114
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:45,357
that Mother we have some Sahaja Yogis
 in  the  one of the villages of  Palestine.

115
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:03,643
They were friends,  despite the fact that
[UNCLEAR] is fighting, countries were fighting.

116
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:07,387
But they were Sahaja Yogis,
 so they were friends they are friends.

117
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:28,569
So this Israilian knew that
 they are going to drop a big bomb

118
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:33,215
in a particular village and he told me that
please pay  attention Mother

119
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,933
 I don't want  people to be killed  there.

120
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:55,123
I give pay attention and they never drop the bomb.

121
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:04,961
Love is the most powerful thing human beings have all.

122
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:13,602
We have never used it.

123
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:18,873
We have always use hatred to over power others.

124
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:30,614
We have never used love.

125
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:40,030
There is divine love allover  allover the world
 that's why we are existing .

126
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:50,247
You have to just become one within that's all.

127
00:19:56,351 --> 00:20:00,811
It's allover, it is called Ruh , It's allover.

128
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:03,289
But we have not yet felt.

129
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:15,718
But today is now, you have the time to feel it.

130
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,938
For that you don’t have to concentrate or do anything,

131
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:27,478
it will  just work automatically.

132
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:40,220
Have faith in yourself.

133
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,608
Do not condemn yourself.

134
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:53,180
This will change the whole world.

135
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:57,393
Once they realize that there is divine love
 which [UNCLEAR] us.

136
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:13,129
So, the first state is thoughtless awareness

137
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:20,626
and the second state  is what we called
 as the doubtless awareness.

138
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,657
That state comes to people automatically

139
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:44,035
sometimes together and they have no doubts about it.

140
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,484
It works that way.

141
00:21:55,509 --> 00:22:01,177
 It doesn't give you any doubts anymore
 you are sure this is what it is.

142
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,018
Today somebody came to see me

143
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,537
he used to perspire and hot.

144
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:21,622
And I saw him, he had  problem with his heart,

145
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:24,257
to  look working very hard.

146
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:41,562
I raised his Kundalini,  he got his realization

147
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:43,388
his perspiration stopped.

148
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,876
So I told him that you should forgive,

149
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:01,539
forgive others and that worked.

150
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:15,217
And this young fellow would have been very seriously ill

151
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:18,787
 or dead by that kind of a  heart.

152
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,646
So you get an awareness which is doubtless.

153
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:48,765
So all those who want to have their self realization

154
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:49,964
please stay on.

155
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:52,996
If you don't want to have
should live the hall.

156
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:08,960
One thing, you should not, you cannot pay for spirituality.

157
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:18,681
There are many false people 
who are doing all  kinds of nonsense,

158
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,479
only thing is you must take  to your self realization.

159
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:38,034
So that you all become Sufis.

160
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:44,201
You don't have to give up everything.

161
