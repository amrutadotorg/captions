1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:12,500
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

2
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,980
to see so many Sahaja yogis

3
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:38,380
sitting here with such shining faces

4
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,900
from all over the world,

5
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,540
as if My vision has taken its form today.

6
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:07,260
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

7
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,420
who are going to save this world

8
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,660
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

9
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,260
that are surrounding us.

10
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,980
Is coming from all sides,

11
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:33,380
while you people have really taken your second birth

12
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,860
from this pond of Kali Yuga

13
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,540
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

14
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,340
hues, fragrance and beauty.

15
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,540
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

16
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,580
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

17
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,380
As I told you the other day that

18
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:16,220
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

19
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,020
that it could work out,

20
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,660
otherwise it would have been impossible.

21
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,140
To even transform one person is very difficult,

22
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,660
but you were so sensitive

23
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,020
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

24
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,780
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

25
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,340
It's unbelievable.

26
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,220
I can't believe Myself

27
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:59,260
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

28
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,380
No one can believe that there are so many

29
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,900
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

30
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,620
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

31
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,220
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

32
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,180
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

33
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,500
and devas, not so many.

34
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,460
One better than the other

35
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,940
such beautiful heart,

36
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,940
such brilliant brains

37
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:55,780
and such active attention, is really

38
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,500
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,100
so many people, which I never expected.

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,940
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

41
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,100
and then those who came also,

42
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,940
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

43
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,340
all kinds of people created problems for us.

44
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,900
One after another, so many problems came

45
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,220
and also there were many who were

46
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,780
of a very low-level seekers.

47
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:44,140
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

48
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,060
I cannot distinguish one from another,

49
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,780
the way it has happened.

50
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,260
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

51
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,500
is the greatest blessings for this world.

52
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,140
I could not do it alone. You know that.

53
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,380
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

54
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,340
You are the channels

55
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,900
and you have to work it out further and further.

56
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,340
It is really remarkable the way

57
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,660
Delhi people have organized everything.

58
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,300
First of all, everybody was very much

59
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,140
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

60
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,460
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

61
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,820
and then Delhi people said,

62
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
"This time we are going to celebrate,

63
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,780
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

64
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,900
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

65
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,940
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

66
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,260
So many will be coming down."

67
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,860
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

68
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,060
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

69
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,260
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

70
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,580
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

71
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,100
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

72
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,780
the way they have done it.

73
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,700
The best part of it,

74
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,060
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

75
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,260
have groups and politics and all that,

76
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,540
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

77
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,380
There is no quarrelling.

78
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,300
There is no pulling each other's legs.

79
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,140
Is very remarkable thing

80
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,260
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

81
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,380
where every day what you hear

82
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,700
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

83
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,540
Perhaps, in this hell only,

84
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,420
this goodness was to be born and

85
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,500
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

86
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,220
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

87
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,340
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

88
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,980
and it's not easy

89
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,500
to penetrate into the so-called

90
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,980
people who call themselves intellectuals

91
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:09,100
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

92
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,180
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

93
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,980
another side the classes who live in the frame

94
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,620
that they have made out of their brains.

95
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,620
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

96
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:35,020
But the way they have absorbed

97
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:44,220
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

98
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,980
Nobody can comprehend even

99
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:03,620
that there were so many born after My birth,

100
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,100
on this Earth,

101
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,060
or some maybe before also, very few.

102
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,860
Just after My birth they were born here

103
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,220
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,620
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

105
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,180
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

106
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,980
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

107
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,140
My family members,

108
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,620
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

109
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:50,860
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

110
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,460
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

111
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,580
there is totality waiting for them?

112
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,700
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

113
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,020
which had no connection with reality.

114
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,940
And it was impossible even to envisage

115
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,060
the method by which I could talk to them.

116
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,180
I remember the first incident

117
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:32,580
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

118
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,900
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

119
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,700
Immediately, all the other,

120
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,220
there were hardly about thirty-five people

121
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,780
they started saying that

122
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,580
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

123
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,380
so Mother has given him realization."

124
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,420
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

125
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,340
I started shouting at them,

126
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,340
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

127
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,220
you can never take to Divinity,"

128
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,980
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

129
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,500
One has to take another life,

130
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,220
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,260
But after that, suddenly,

132
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,540
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

133
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,420
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

134
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,940
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

135
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,820
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

136
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,540
Thus, we got twelve people

137
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:51,700
and one lady whom I had given before also,

138
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,860
she was the fourteenth.

139
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,740
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

140
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,620
for whom it was something out of the blue.

141
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,220
They were all flabbergasted.

142
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,980
They didn't know what it was.

143
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,420
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

144
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:31,940
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

145
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,660
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

146
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,100
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

147
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,380
I've never told otherwise also.

148
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,700
So then, she recited a poem

149
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,580
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

150
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,980
and she was just a maidservant.

151
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,220
And in a man's voice.

152
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,220
So everybody was shocked

153
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,980
that the bhoots should say all these things.

154
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,540
And then she went away.

155
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,820
After that, these people started probing into it.

156
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,980
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

157
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,140
in My house itself.

158
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:30,660
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

159
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,540
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

160
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,900
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

161
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,540
and something will happen to us."

162
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,140
But after the Puja they said,

163
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,220
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

164
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,700
They all felt the cool breeze

165
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,500
and the entire atmosphere changed.

166
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,700
They started understanding that

167
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,380
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

168
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:10,580
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

169
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:18,460
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

170
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,540
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

171
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,780
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

172
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,700
and that's what happened with all of you,

173
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:44,540
that you found out that everywhere

174
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,820
people were following whatever they're following,

175
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,660
they were not reaching any point.

176
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,540
Like a cocoon,

177
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,380
they're hitting their head here and there.

178
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,660
They got their realizations

179
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,940
so quickly and when they told Me

180
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,260
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

181
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,340
I was amazed.

182
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,700
How this seeking was working within them

183
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,660
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,860
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

185
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:34,500
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

186
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

187
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,500
You are just representing your country,

188
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,420
but there are many more in your countries.

189
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,140
Even in India we have many more.

190
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,820
You are just here, come to represent them.

191
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,900
So, multiple of this number,

192
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,380
I do not know how many would be there.

193
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,900
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

194
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,780
"I don't know."

195
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,900
Say, "You don't know?"

196
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,660
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

197
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,140
So they can't understand. I said,

198
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:20,300
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

199
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,300
I don't know how to type.

200
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,020
I don't know how to write even My check."

201
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,980
They can't understand

202
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,100
person like Me existing in these modern times.

203
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,220
But everything gets done, somehow.

204
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,180
Despite all My modern ignorance,

205
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,660
everything gets absolutely

206
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,380
done in the most perfect manner

207
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,500
like a remote control.

208
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,580
Now this whole thing,

209
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:05,220
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

210
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,020
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

211
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,700
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

212
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,860
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

213
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,780
because you all have commitment

214
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,420
and that commitment gives you

215
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,820
all these organizing capacities.

216
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,900
So many things you have seen get organized

217
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,780
because also this Paramchaitanya

218
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,100
has come into Krita Yuga

219
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,340
where it is working it out. It's acting.

220
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,980
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

221
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,860
For example, the police people told us

222
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,140
that there are Muslims living here

223
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,820
and you might have some danger from them.

224
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,300
They might do some harm to you.

225
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,460
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

226
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,100
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

227
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,980
I said, "They'll never harm us."

228
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,100
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

229
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,860
and he was a great realized soul

230
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,140
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

231
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,540
at least, believers of Sufism.

232
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,700
How can they harm us?"

233
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,860
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

234
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,260
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

235
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,660
and they were so impressed

236
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,780
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

237
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,460
morning time, and they were so respectful.

238
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,620
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

239
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,060
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

240
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,860
all kinds of things.

241
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,900
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

242
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,460
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

243
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,180
and I always have admired his poetry

244
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:27,620
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

245
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,820
and divinity.

246
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,540
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

247
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,620
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

248
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,860
I said, "This is Ruh."

249
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,620
"Ah, this is Ruh."

250
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,620
Once these people start getting Ruh,

251
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,140
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

252
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,620
and you may have to have ...

253
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,780
There are so many Sufis all over the world

254
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,860
and we are going to take their addresses

255
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,300
and we are going to meet them;

256
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,020
then you might have to have another big pendal,

257
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,820
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

258
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:31,980
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

259
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,420
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

260
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,580
Also contemporarily,

261
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,860
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

262
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,660
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

263
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,980
to give wisdom to those people

264
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,780
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

265
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,260
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

266
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,660
With all these Sahaja yogis

267
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,020
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

268
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,500
See, on top of your head

269
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,140
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

270
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,100
though there is no breeze outside,

271
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,260
the leaves are just steady,

272
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,740
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

273
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,700
So I'm sure these vibrations

274
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,460
will cool down and will bring peace

275
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,220
to our politicians and to the people

276
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,620
who are at the helm of affairs.

277
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,900
At this juncture, when in the whole world

278
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,380
there are so many things going on

279
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,340
of uncertainties,

280
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,820
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

281
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,980
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

282
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,980
in England there's recession,

283
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,140
America there is recession,

284
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,220
Spain there is recession,

285
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,020
everybody is suffering from the pangs

286
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,060
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

287
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,140
So, I'm sure this polarity

288
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,340
that they see now will correct

289
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,540
their behavior towards materialism

290
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:46,220
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

291
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,140
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

292
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:57,220
this world will be so beautiful,

293
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:06,180
so enchanting that in the history,

294
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,500
people will describe

295
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,140
that the world itself became a lotus

296
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,500
full of fragrance of Divinity.

297
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,260
You are the petals,

298
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,980
you are the corona,

299
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,980
you are the color,

300
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,540
you are the beauty,

301
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,020
you are the pollen

302
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,700
of that beautiful lotus

303
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,420
which is My vision of this world.

304
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,260
I hope today

305
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:04,780
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

306
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,220
to spread Sahaja Yoga

307
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,020
and work for yourself also.

308
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,180
The only danger is

309
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,220
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

310
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,260
That's the only horse.

311
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,060
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

312
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,340
you'll progress very fast,

313
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,540
beautifully.

314
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:43,580
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

315
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:52,140
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

316
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:57,580
I don't know what vow I should take.

317
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,380
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

318
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,260
I'm working very hard,

319
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,620
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

320
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,620
In the same way, you also,

321
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,500
all of you, have to take a vow today

322
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,340
that we'll go all out in the commitment

323
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,580
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,460
We'll think about it.

325
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,300
There are scientists who should produce books,

326
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,980
there are doctors who should produce books,

327
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,460
writings,

328
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,780
go round,

329
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,700
talk to their colleagues,

330
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,660
organize meetings,

331
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,180
seminars with your colleagues.

332
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,460
There are architects

333
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,980
and other professionals

334
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,900
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

335
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,620
Even the people who are dealing with finances

336
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,140
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

337
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,740
Is very important because

338
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,980
financial problems can only be

339
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,860
solved by the Divine Power.

340
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,420
Nobody else can solve it.

341
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,580
So everyone in this world,

342
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,020
whether it is law or any other field,

343
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:42,260
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

344
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,780
and also to creative work.

345
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,100
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

346
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,580
to your surroundings,

347
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:02,100
to villages, to cities,

348
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,140
wherever it is possible,

349
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,540
wherever you can organize,

350
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,420
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

351
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,140
As far as curing is concerned,

352
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,500
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

353
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,300
Please use only My photograph.

354
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,140
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

355
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,580
and less sick people.

356
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,100
Also, people will be cured

357
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,860
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

358
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,460
We have also agricultural field

359
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,900
on which we have done something,

360
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,300
but much can be done about agriculture.

361
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,980
One should see the government and tell them

362
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,380
what agriculture can do.

363
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,460
You can form a committee and go and see them

364
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,580
and talk to them that

365
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:03,500
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,140
We have to help our children.

367
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,500
We have to look after them

368
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:17,700
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

369
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,900
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

370
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,340
even in India.

371
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,140
So we have to see that our children

372
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,380
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

373
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
Is very important

374
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,500
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

375
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,340
So many of them are born realized,

376
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,020
so we have to discipline them properly

377
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,660
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

378
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,220
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

379
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:05,660
It is also our family life which is very important.

380
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,700
Is shocking that

381
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,260
family life is nowadays becoming

382
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,180
a kind of a stupid thing.

383
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,380
No one understands the importance of it.

384
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,940
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

385
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:26,660
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

386
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:32,020
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

387
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:37,900
and there should be a proper rapport

388
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:45,460
between husband and wife to begin with,

389
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,100
so that there is a companionship

390
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,420
and the children also see that companionship

391
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,340
and enjoy it.

392
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,940
In our dress, in our life,

393
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,820
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

394
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,300
Is very important.

395
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,780
We should wear whatever suits us

396
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,540
in whatever country we are.

397
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,580
I mean, imagine in summer climate

398
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,340
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

399
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,780
what will happen to him?

400
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,060
Whatever suits us,

401
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,380
whatever fits our culture,

402
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,940
one should try to wear decent dresses,

403
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,660
traditional dresses.

404
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,460
Specially for women, it is very important

405
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,300
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

406
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,580
Also, another point I would like to say,

407
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,460
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

408
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,980
at least newspapers.

409
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,140
If your attention is on the problems

410
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,740
that are in this world, it's very effective

411
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,580
because you know your attention is active, it works.

412
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,900
So use your attention.

413
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,380
You see the newspapers,

414
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,020
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

415
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,820
you can give a bandhan,

416
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,180
but you must see what's happening where,

417
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,980
is very important.

418
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,900
Also men should not just read something sensational,

419
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,060
but read something that's happening

420
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,460
and also think, what are the solutions.

421
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,860
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

422
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,140
in a collective way or in an individual way.

423
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:56,940
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

424
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,020
Also one has to read good books,

425
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,060
good films one has to see,

426
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,780
and have your reflection on them.

427
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,740
Keep your mind alert.

428
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,980
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

429
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,460
coming out of

430
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,380
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

431
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,940
beautiful, very high class.

432
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,420
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

433
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,540
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

434
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,060
from everywhere.

435
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,460
They are trying to systematize now.

436
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,420
And now, in this system,

437
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,060
if you can all help spontaneously,

438
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,500
it will be a great achievement

439
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,020
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

440
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,220
all these datas and keep them with us.

441
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,260
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

442
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,980
All have to meditate.

443
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,740
Only in meditation you are in present

444
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,540
and you grow in your spirituality.

445
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,540
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

446
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,100
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

447
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,700
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

448
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,580
no doubt.

449
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,660
We really grow very fast.

450
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,460
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

451
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,620
the way he has changed.

452
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,420
And then, once you get used to it,

453
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,140
you'll never give it up.

454
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,100
Is very simple meditation.

455
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,860
You have foot soaking or something like that

456
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,980
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

457
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,660
that's all.

458
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,700
Is not that you have to do

459
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,140
one lakh jappas or something.

460
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,620
Nothing of the kind.

461
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,340
Is very simple.

462
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,540
But this, you have to do for yourself,

463
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:53,860
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

464
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:03,100
We have lots of advantages over others.

465
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,380
But one thing I have to tell you,

466
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,580
those people who are not prone to seeking,

467
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,140
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

468
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,140
Don't waste your energy on such people,

469
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,140
discussing and arguing,

470
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,900
because it cannot be discussed much.

471
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,580
You just forget them and leave them alone.

472
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,180
I'll look after them.

473
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,980
You just take to simple people, good people,

474
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,060
who are seeking the truth.

475
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,620
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

476
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,380
who are just believing in discussion,

477
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,740
arguments and shabda jaal.

478
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,060
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

479
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,180
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

480
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,700
there's something special

481
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,740
and that they have something very unique

482
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,540
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

483
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,100
All these things, you should understand,

484
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,220
have come to you spontaneously from within,

485
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,780
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

486
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,260
Should never be shy of your virtues.

487
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,420
And whatever people may try

488
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,820
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

489
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,780
if it is wrong you should never do it.

490
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:29,620
Because, now, you are very powerful

491
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,380
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

492
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,820
and that you have to lead the people

493
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,500
and people don't have to lead you.

494
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,460
Fashions don't have to lead you,

495
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,940
but you have to create fashions.

496
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,660
You have to create a path for them.

497
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,540
It's not that you have to

498
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,500
trod on the path that they have made.

499
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,940
Try to understand

500
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,300
that your own personality

501
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,500
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

502
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,140
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

503
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,380
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

504
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,460
Don't get ideas from them

505
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,100
and don't get frightened

506
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,580
when they try to tell you something

507
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,500
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

508
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,620
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

509
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,540
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

510
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,940
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

511
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,940
that it worked out.

512
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,300
I didn't have to,

513
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,500
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

514
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,140
I just started it.

515
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,300
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

516
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,220
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

517
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,260
I started the whole thing on My own,

518
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,100
worked it out on My own,

519
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,420
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

520
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,740
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

521
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,820
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

522
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,900
It has happened.

523
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,860
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

524
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,660
All of you should, first of all,

525
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,980
see that you are not a conditioned person

526
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,260
and you do not have an ego

527
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,140
and then you should go ahead with it

528
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,500
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

529
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,260
Today's puja is very short puja.

530
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,740
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

531
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,380
There are so many things which I cannot,

532
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,140
at this time, which is short, tell you

533
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,100
but if you sit down, you can easily make

534
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:52,220
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

535
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,580
So, now put your mind to it

536
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,100
in a way that you are the organizer.

537
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,860
Then what should you do? What can you do?

538
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,140
What are you going to achieve?

539
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,780
Please try and it will work out.

540
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,260
All of you can do it.

541
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,300
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

542
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,340
and write it down in that: what you have done,

543
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,420
how many people you have given realization,

544
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,060
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

545
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,620
But now, if there's no diary,

546
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,940
Sahaja yogis can say among,

547
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,020
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

548
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,060
you start it today.

549
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,420
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

550
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,340
is that they take things little lightly.

551
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,740
Of course, that is their character.

552
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,300
But not Sahaja Yoga.

553
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,580
Other things you can take lightly.

554
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,340
If somebody shouts at you,

555
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,820
somebody gets angry with you,

556
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,380
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

557
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,340
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

558
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,300
because you are the spirit.

559
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,900
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

560
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,780
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

561
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,140
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

562
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,420
your attitude should be different.

563
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,620
If you are relaxing on one side,

564
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,980
another side you have to be dynamic

565
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,860
and that side is where you have to put forward

566
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,420
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

567
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,180
when you have to talk to people,

568
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,460
you have to organize a press conference

569
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,580
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

570
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
At whatever level you want to work it out,

571
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,020
please make a proper plan about it

572
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,140
and just do it.

573
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,500
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

574
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,180
With all these ideas that I have,

575
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,300
you have many more

576
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,260
and I hope by next year,

577
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,980
we'll see manifestation of those.

578
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,140
I hope many people will write books

579
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,460
like U.C. Rai has written.

580
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,380
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

581
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,220
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

582
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,940
Everything he has done single-handed.

583
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,660
So beautifully he has worked it out.

584
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:25,140
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

585
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,420
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

586
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,380
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

587
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,500
But it should be honest, very honest book.

588
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,900
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

589
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,500
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

590
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,700
All those who have such ideas

591
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:52,300
should make an effort to create some new books,

592
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,540
some new ideas, some new creation.

593
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,580
Is very important

594
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,620
because in these modern times

595
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,900
people want to do something new,

596
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,820
something novel.

597
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,620
Under these circumstances,

598
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,420
I'm sure you all will work out.

599
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,500
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

600
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,620
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

601
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,460
and then these can be properly put together,

602
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,420
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

603
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,420
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

604
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,700
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

605
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,340
This is a very opportune time.

606
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:53,420
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

607
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,460
And what will be the symptom

608
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,380
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

609
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,420
Whatever people may try,

610
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,340
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

611
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,820
Satyame vijayate.

612
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:40,740
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

613
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,580
For this I congratulate you again and again.

614
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,260
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

615
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,820
May God bless you all.
