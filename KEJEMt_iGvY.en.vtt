00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.650
then the deity disappears from them, all right?

00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:14.170
The attention goes away from the place.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.147
Then they bring the Satan there and play the havoc.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.308
See these tantrikas have no relationship with our ancient Scriptures,

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:24.924
no relationship at all.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:28.664
For example Rajneesh will never mention any one of our ancient Scriptures,

00:00:28.664 --> 00:00:29.814
nothing.

00:00:29.814 --> 00:00:32.295
They have no relationship with any deities.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.816
They have no relationship with

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:38.993
any great writers we have had, like Adi Shankaracharya.

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:40.516
Not a word.

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:47.152
Holiness is the basis of religion and spirituality.

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:51.562
In which Scripture this is written?

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:55.173
Does he mean to say that he is,

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:58.865
he has nothing to do with Christ, nothing to do with God,

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:01.784
nothing to do with anyone, but only sex?

00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:06.239
Deluded you people are really, why don’t you think are you only sex point?

00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:08.962
So many things are written about it.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.783
Because you people wanted.

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:13.403
Audience: (inaudible}

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.683
Where is it?

00:01:14.694 --> 00:01:15.583
(Inaudible)

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:16.686
No. No, no, no, no.

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:17.783
There’s nothing about sex?

00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:19.245
Not a word.

00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:20.388
(Questioner Inaudible)

00:01:20.394 --> 00:01:21.397
No, no…

00:01:22.188 --> 00:01:23.808
What?

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:26.481
You see that way these people have spoiled

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:30.981
even Ashwa Medha Yagna which was the…, such a great thing, you know.

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:34.787
They have used it for their own purpose saying that this is the symbol of this.

00:01:34.798 --> 00:01:38.234
Even Shiva and Shakti, nonsensical people call it sex.

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:40.784
How can you do that to God?

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:43.388
You sublimate into that, the greater thing.

00:01:43.477 --> 00:01:44.594
What is sex?

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:48.085
Every Dick, Tom, Harry can do sex…

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:49.814
We are used to do it so…

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:50.825
Yes, then what?

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:56.718
That’s why they are telling you to do it and, but if you do it in a wrong way you’ll have diseases,

00:01:56.737 --> 00:01:59.697
you’ll have impotency,

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.962
no children will be born to you if you misuse it.

00:02:05.072 --> 00:02:08.205
There is a sanctity about it.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.467
May I ask you a question?

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:09.985
Yes.

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.459
Do you say that one should never use sex?

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.788
No, no, one should.

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:15.278
One should be married.

00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:16.628
One should use sex.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:21.015
It’s meant for a happy married life and for having children,

00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:24.096
and leading a very happy and a good life.

00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:28.645
You must have a good sex life. You see, we do not think of sex at all in India.

00:02:28.643 --> 00:02:29.742
Never.

00:02:29.802 --> 00:02:31.772
This is spontaneous.

00:02:31.862 --> 00:02:34.582
You see, we never think of sex and all this nonsense.

00:02:34.652 --> 00:02:36.269
We don’t read about it.

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:42.677
I mean, I can tell you except for few anglicised and westernised Indians whom you meet,

00:02:42.687 --> 00:02:45.895
you will hardly find anyone asking. Now they have met villagers.

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:47.433
They don’t even think about sex,

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:51.153
is a thing, relationship with the wife, very sacred relationship.

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:55.808
When you are with your wife, you see you indulge into it at an extreme point.

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:57.419
That’s all.

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.378
We do not sit and read about sex.

00:02:59.438 --> 00:03:04.014
Why should you read about it? This is spontaneous thing. Why should you read?

00:03:04.014 --> 00:03:05.044
I don’t read this.

00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:05.835
That’s it.

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:08.034
But that’s what they are doing it.

00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:13.094
This is another kind of Hitlerism.

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:17.465
I can tell you this is another kind of a cruelty to human beings.

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:21.106
See, you will be enticed absolutely;

00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:24.947
you would not find out, you will not know that this is a mistake.

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:27.713
You’ll get into it and then you’ll realize it’s a mistake.

00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:30.084
This is a destruction of your own being.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.223
By wars you have destroyed others.

00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:35.364
By this you will destroy yourself.

00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:41.335
What I say has a bearing in the Bible,

00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:42.905
has a bearing in Koran,

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:48.623
has a bearing in what you call any of the Scriptures, of Upanishads and all that,

00:03:48.623 --> 00:03:50.683
every word of it,

00:03:50.693 --> 00:03:54.039
Gita and also of Adi Shankaracharya,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.361
every word of it.

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:05.592
He has made forty crores of rupees.

00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:07.502
This also you don’t understand

00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:10.013
that he’s playing on your ego.

00:04:10.013 --> 00:04:11.623
You think you can purchase him,

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:13.903
you can handle him.

00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:17.403
You don’t understand this, you see. He is too cunning for you.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:24.492
But how can you explain that so many western people

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:25.153
Mad!

00:04:25.213 --> 00:04:27.673
went to him and go to him every time?

00:04:27.723 --> 00:04:29.932
How can you explain so many Germans

00:04:29.983 --> 00:04:33.142
wanted to kill thousands of people

00:04:33.223 --> 00:04:36.368
like so many of them were burnt alive

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:41.238
and put in the gas chamber? Do you, can you explain it?

00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:45.170
Very easy to befool you people,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.225
very easy.

00:04:46.214 --> 00:04:48.795
The trouble is you all think you are very clever.

00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:52.324
You can be outwitted by a cleverer cunning fellow.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.369
You are not cunning. You are only clever.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.079
Any cunning man can outwit you just like this.

00:04:59.088 --> 00:05:01.269
It’s very easy to befool you.

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:05.478
Then you should also think why is it that Indians do not even take his name in the morning?

00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:09.629
Indian Government is anxious to oust him.

00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:13.404
Why don’t you think like that?

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.774
If India is a place of wisdom,

00:05:15.785 --> 00:05:19.324
then why he is not at all respected in this country?

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:27.448
In fact in all houses if name is also mentioned he’s considered most inauspicious

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.677
Inauspicious. In his house, you see, if anybody mentions his name

00:05:31.737 --> 00:05:34.079
in Indian homes we think it is inauspicious;

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.759
we think he’s a Ravana.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.108
He’s the incarnation of Ravana, Rajneesh is.

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.651
Incarnation of?

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:42.769
The Ravana.

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:43.432
There is a…

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:46.331
The one who fought against Rama.

00:05:46.322 --> 00:05:49.718
Demon, he is a demon no doubt. He is what?  Is he not?

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:54.348
He is, hundred per cent he is Ravana. Be sure of it.

00:05:58.497 --> 00:06:04.399
(Shri Mataji talks to a child.)

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.230
She’s a born realised child.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.933
He is very nicely playing with your mind.

00:06:24.406 --> 00:06:27.333
In London, just imagine, in London,

00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:30.130
nine people got hold of a basement

00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:34.341
and took out their clothes and danced ecstatically,

00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:38.360
just take out all your clothes and say, “No, no, no, no, no, no”.

00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:41.004
And they have within five months time, I don’t know,

00:06:40.995 --> 00:06:44.545
they have thousands of people. They are buying the whole of London.

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:49.314
Why can’t you see this stupidity?

00:06:53.595 --> 00:06:58.331
I mean, at least at the time of Hitler you could say that people had this feeling to kill others.

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:01.785
But in this, to be stupid is the feeling, is it?

00:07:01.805 --> 00:07:05.016
Absolute stupidity, nonsense!

00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:12.959
If by becoming naked you can reach God,

00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:15.988
then in the bathroom every day you are like that.

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:19.738
I told you that don’t go in the sun too much. Be careful.

00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:24.293
You see, this is also very wrong the way you expose your body to sun.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.110
You will develop skin cancers.

00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:28.521
Believe Me, you will develop skin cancers.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.964
You shouldn’t burn your skin so much.

00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:32.884
It's not a good thing, you know.

00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:36.375
For sun also, you cover yourself and take the thing.

00:07:36.404 --> 00:07:38.555
Otherwise you will develop skin cancers.

00:07:40.504 --> 00:07:42.416
You should not overdo anything.

00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:45.033
Extremes should be avoided.

00:07:48.024 --> 00:07:50.004
That is how you land into difficulties,

00:07:51.173 --> 00:07:55.132
How many people in Sweden are committing suicide today?

00:07:56.223 --> 00:08:00.091
You are rich people. Why are you committing suicide?

00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:03.660
While you find there Indians so happy, don’t you?

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:05.920
They haven’t got riches or anything.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.521
How are they happy?

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:10.500
Even when they are starving they are happier.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:14.927
Why?

00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:17.360
I’m not sure whether they are so…

00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:19.480
Not all, not all, but many.

00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:28.064
Because India is also [unclear]. They are much influenced by Europeans as well as [unclear].

00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:32.471
No, no… They could not influence us… They tried, they tried…

00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:34.451
(Unclear)

00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.467
What is it?

00:08:39.577 --> 00:08:40.288
Culture

00:08:40.307 --> 00:08:44.488
(Unclear)

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.677
What's he saying?

00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:52.432
I think he says that also the India’s cultural background has been modified like that, by the West

00:08:52.501 --> 00:08:54.561
That is true but still we are Indians.

00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:56.522
(Unclear)

00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:57.282
Yes, I agree.

00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:03.649
But you know it can be about of the mind of the Indian people, you know the source and the education of lot of Indians, you know.

00:09:03.749 --> 00:09:06.178
That is what you are doing now to give us ideas.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:10.094
You see, you people are coming and give us, giving us ideas.

00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:13.576
See, we never knew that hashish could be sold like this.

00:09:13.677 --> 00:09:16.453
Now you are giving us ideas.

00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:19.506
Apart from that you are trying to develop our country,

00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:22.297
I agree, I agree,

00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:25.919
but there’s a great aggression still on.

00:09:25.942 --> 00:09:28.366
But our this culture cannot be destroyed.

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:31.649
Because our culture is a very deep thing,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.389
is very deeply built in our inside, you see.

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:38.629
Our family structures cannot be destroyed easily.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:44.850
These are just permissions on the periphery, but inside India you cannot enter.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.710
You cannot.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.759
This is also another aggression, you don’t know, for us even the sex is an aggression from you people.

00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:54.639
We never had these ideas.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:00.190
For us it is difficult to maintain these horrible demons in this country

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.307
but for you people who are maintaining them there.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.546
We would like them to be sent to you people

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:11.035
so that you leave us alone with our auspiciousness, holiness and spirituality.

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:16.952
It’s a very subtle aggression coming to us and you people are saints.

00:10:17.023 --> 00:10:20.442
You must understand you were saints in India in previous lives.

00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:25.491
You have to understand our difficulty.

00:10:28.273 --> 00:10:30.964
You can have your sex, you can have your sex shops,

00:10:30.994 --> 00:10:33.323
you can have all nonsense, all your lives, doesn’t matter,

00:10:33.403 --> 00:10:36.134
but for us you spare us now.

00:10:40.354 --> 00:10:44.437
In India we have a very, absolutely different ideas about the saint.

00:10:44.456 --> 00:10:47.806
A saint has to lead a very holy life.

00:10:47.817 --> 00:10:51.691
He has to be a holy person, very kind, affectionate.

00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:55.100
He doesn’t take any money from you. He’s not a parasite.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.841
He lives with self-respect.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.642
Villagers just laugh, you see.

00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:05.131
They cannot understand.

00:11:05.192 --> 00:11:09.331
If you tell them, “Why do you go and sell them hashish?”

00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:12.076
They said, “Only the children go and do it. We don’t do it.”

00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:16.067
I said, “The children will have the sin. Why do you go and tell them?”

00:11:16.116 --> 00:11:20.582
They said, “No, the children can go and have bath in the river, they're innocent they don’t know.

00:11:22.373 --> 00:11:25.073
But they are committing sins by doing these things.

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:33.956
You must understand it is a very serious matter, My children.

00:11:34.075 --> 00:11:38.263
It’s a very serious matter and responsibility will be your own.

00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:44.025
You are saints and how are you going about it?

00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:49.655
Where is it, in which Scripture it is written

00:11:49.726 --> 00:11:54.807
that sex should be the criteria for a saint?

00:11:56.307 --> 00:11:59.142
All right, I don’t say suppress it like that.

00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:01.611
Your churches have done nonsensical thing.

00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:04.491
Of course, that’s all nonsense, I agree. …

00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:06.782
But this is another extreme,

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:09.561
one is the suppression of sex, all right?

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:15.542
Like nunneries and all that. That’s all nonsense, but the other is even worse.

00:12:18.772 --> 00:12:21.547
You are going from one extreme to another extreme.

00:12:21.687 --> 00:12:24.326
God is in the centre.

00:12:32.437 --> 00:12:36.477
This over excitement and these wrong ideas,

00:12:36.508 --> 00:12:39.484
I don’t know how I... you should accept.

00:12:42.903 --> 00:12:45.504
It is high time you people now understand

00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:48.149
because it will be very late, later on.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.975
As you said, “Why” to Me? now I am giving you an example.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:58.562
It’s a, it’s a… sort of a hypnosis, a kind of a hypnosis.

00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:01.331
You are just hypnotised.

00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:04.131
He does not explain how he does it.

00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:07.384
He does not as I do. They know how to do it themselves.

00:13:09.214 --> 00:13:11.783
They know all the methods, how it is done,

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.344
how Kundalini is brought up,

00:13:13.403 --> 00:13:19.452
how your heart has got the Spirit, which is brought into your parasympathetic.

00:13:19.472 --> 00:13:24.211
It’s all written down in our books, how to make it out.

00:13:24.232 --> 00:13:26.911
As yesterday, that music you heard?

00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:32.671
Of Chitananda Lahari, you see you get these vibrations you must get  in the hands.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:40.023
This is what is written in our Scriptures, is there, and this is how one has to achieve.

00:13:43.092 --> 00:13:46.730
And even a person like Shankaracharya has said

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.172
that, “Na yoghe na sankhen”, means “neither by yoga”,

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:55.525
means the way you do Hatha yoga “neither by sankhen it works out”

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:57.870
but it works out through the grace of Mother.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.842
A person like Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya, such a learned man,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.186
who wrote Vivekachudamani, later on he just wrote the praise of Mother, that’s all.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.456
He said, “Nothing more is needed.”

00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:14.716
Now Rajneesh is just the opposite of it.

00:14:14.765 --> 00:14:18.076
He’s teaching you how to insult your Mother.

00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:28.947
Nothing was wrong with Freud as you can say,

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:32.054
because you cannot understand what was wrong with him.

00:14:32.075 --> 00:14:36.054
You do not have the complete idea as to what you are.

00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:40.274
I will tell you just now what you are and what you have to achieve.

00:14:40.284 --> 00:14:42.095
I’m waiting for all of them to come.

00:14:42.154 --> 00:14:45.581
You just think over; it’s a very big responsibility.

00:14:45.662 --> 00:14:50.731
You people have given up materialism, you have started seeking God.

00:14:52.163 --> 00:14:52.851
Why?

00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:55.654
Because you were saints in your last life.

00:14:55.638 --> 00:15:01.764
It is described that saints would be seeking much more in the Kali Yuga, at this time.

00:15:01.764 --> 00:15:08.576
When these demands started all these thugs have also started supplying.

00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:18.683
What is the transformation of the person who talks to you intermittently?

00:15:18.788 --> 00:15:22.028
What did he get within himself, an experience.

00:15:22.109 --> 00:15:24.178
What given experience?

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:28.167
You see if he says," Is an experience." You should say, “Can you make out what’s wrong with me?”

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:29.708
Ask him.

00:15:29.778 --> 00:15:31.527
These people can make out.

00:15:31.537 --> 00:15:33.976
He told me this chakra is catching,

00:15:33.976 --> 00:15:35.940
you will also say.

00:15:35.927 --> 00:15:39.480
Isn’t it? I mean, there should be some knowledge of yourself.

00:15:39.491 --> 00:15:41.581
You must get some knowledge within yourself.

00:15:41.652 --> 00:15:46.402
Your consciousness must have a wider dimension, do you understand?

00:15:46.392 --> 00:15:49.234
Now he told me that your left Vishuddhi is catching.

00:15:49.251 --> 00:15:52.004
So I asked you left Swadishthan to be, to be settled.

00:15:52.014 --> 00:15:54.620
It pains you there also.

00:15:54.644 --> 00:15:58.640
Now he doesn’t know where it pains you. How did he tell Me?

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.860
See now.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.961
So he could feel that this chakra is catching.

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:04.998
Catched.

00:16:05.008 --> 00:16:06.421
Catched, caught up.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.500
Now I asked, “Do you feel guilty?”

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.190
That’s it.

00:16:12.181 --> 00:16:14.453
It has been other things also.

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:20.562
All of them can tell you. All of them can tell you what’s wrong with you.

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:25.145
Even if you have ten realised children here, if you tie up their eyes

00:16:25.296 --> 00:16:29.537
they will tell the same thing, that this is catching in this person and you will also feel the same.

00:16:29.616 --> 00:16:33.567
You put your hands and you will feel this finger burning.

00:16:37.966 --> 00:16:38.876
See?

00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:48.616
When your sensitivity will improve you will also tell about others.

00:16:52.628 --> 00:16:55.961
It is your instrument must start working.

00:16:55.951 --> 00:16:58.138
What are the experiences you are talking about?

00:16:58.128 --> 00:17:02.878
Like a hashish experience, then like a hallucination experience,

00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:06.667
then other experience; you had many like that, you see.

00:17:06.728 --> 00:17:12.978
“I was very high. Somebody says I’m very high.” But what did you get?

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:18.357
You see, you are, you are just regarding to something by some sort of a chemical thing or a hypnosis.

00:17:20.317 --> 00:17:22.518
Still all of us have not come.

00:17:23.728 --> 00:17:25.557
You have taken the photographs?

00:17:25.657 --> 00:17:29.294
Very nice then, I must say. I have professional photographs also.

00:17:29.374 --> 00:17:32.794
I think you are very good. Did a good job and we were all surprised.

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:37.513
If you want you can take just now but they all have not yet arrived

00:17:47.659 --> 00:17:51.598
No, but let Mr. George come and see Me. Tell him. Because he still gets sick, you see.

00:17:51.782 --> 00:17:55.722
I must get him cured. You tell him today because tomorrow I won’t have any chance.

00:17:55.936 --> 00:17:56.707
All right?

00:17:58.366 --> 00:17:59.916
If you want you can.

00:17:59.924 --> 00:18:02.936
Come along, come forward.

00:18:05.817 --> 00:18:08.196
This sit space is free if you want to get…

00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:16.738
Now you are better. Much better now, see.

00:18:19.768 --> 00:18:24.655
See, you are in a way more sort of connected with Sanskrit language, you see.

00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:28.796
You are the vehicle now for Sanskrit language.

00:18:28.823 --> 00:18:34.232
But I was surprised that how Germans were influenced by these horrible tantrikas.

00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:37.949
They, they don’t know superficial things.

00:18:37.965 --> 00:18:43.135
You know, to know about tantrikas is like entering into the house through the sewage.

00:18:46.086 --> 00:18:51.380
First enter into the sewage only and then they got, I mean they never got any knowledge.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.749
No German has written about Shankaracharya. Most surprising.

00:18:56.358 --> 00:18:57.628
Not a word.

00:18:58.598 --> 00:19:04.178
They have written books after books over tantrikas, which is sewage for us, absolutely sewage.

00:19:05.013 --> 00:19:11.347
They could never enter because perhaps some way or other they were guided into it or taken into it.

00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:14.087
Mislaid completely.

00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:20.771
Even Jung I was surprised, even Jung, you see.

00:19:20.832 --> 00:19:28.556
Poor thing, you know, they, they come to whatever they read and whatever it is, they could never reach the reality.

00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:30.846
We have to reach to the bone of this country.

00:19:30.905 --> 00:19:35.016
Then only you’ll get that peace and bliss which is promised.

00:19:35.036 --> 00:19:38.334
You must understand them not from outside but from inside.

00:19:39.354 --> 00:19:41.564
For that you have to go inside.

00:19:41.673 --> 00:19:48.672
But these all superficial experiences, if you depend on, then what’s the use?

00:20:05.531 --> 00:20:08.935
What’s your name? You’ve done really that photograph?

00:20:10.395 --> 00:20:11.516
Eldon?

00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:12.455
Really?

00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:15.816
You see here you’re walking or what?

00:20:21.965 --> 00:20:24.295
That’s all right. She has got light also.

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.355
Whatever comes in, in a general way…

00:20:34.829 --> 00:20:37.192
This is a very subtle happening;

00:20:37.243 --> 00:20:39.261
it’s a very, very subtle happening.

00:20:39.332 --> 00:20:47.238
It is not a gross happening where you think of women and think of these dirty things that you’ve before liked having casinos and busy life.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.240
It is not like this. It’s a deep happening.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:58.671
It’s a very, very deep happening and a very subtle happening for you will have to be very, very religious people.

00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:04.949
While you have no idea of religion in that country, I can tell you.

00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:08.288
Religion is within, not without.

00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:10.659
Like there are some priests and they are coming …

00:21:10.808 --> 00:21:12.196
"We don’t believe in our priests

00:21:12.267 --> 00:21:16.317
just for play sake we do, but we don’t think that they are saints."

00:21:16.487 --> 00:21:18.257
Saints are very different.

00:21:22.507 --> 00:21:28.598
So the value of saints is so much reduced because your Pope has started certifying somebody as a saint.

00:21:28.679 --> 00:21:30.939
Naturally the Pope himself is not a saint.

00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:33.721
How does he know somebody is a saint or not?

00:21:34.691 --> 00:21:42.560
So I don’t blame you, naturally. You are quite a sort of disillusioned,

00:21:42.721 --> 00:21:44.303
absolutely correct.

00:21:44.383 --> 00:21:48.549
but, by just one disillusionment you don't go to another illusion also.

00:21:53.905 --> 00:21:55.884
What is the reality?

00:21:57.721 --> 00:22:05.137
By knowing yourself you should know your inner being and you should know the inner beings of others, isn’t it, Peter?

00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:08.785
Supposing you are an engineer, take it like that, all right?

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.375
If you are an engineer, if you have become an engineer

00:22:12.381 --> 00:22:17.723
you will know about the instruments that are in your house and in anybody else’s houses.

00:22:22.344 --> 00:22:24.903
Sit down, sit down.

00:22:27.126 --> 00:22:32.019
This is what should happen, by knowing self-knowledge means knowing yourself.

00:22:32.038 --> 00:22:34.378
What are you thinking about these experiences?

00:22:34.378 --> 00:22:39.814
You see, anybody can give you by putting you out somewhere.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:54.574
The experience of the Spirit is that by which you get the knowledge of your being and the knowledge of another person.

00:22:59.384 --> 00:23:03.869
Then something that you cannot achieve yourself,

00:23:03.876 --> 00:23:07.201
It has to come as grace to you. It has to come as grace.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:12.191
If you can achieve God then He is no more God.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.686
If He is the Almighty then you cannot capture Him.

00:23:18.777 --> 00:23:24.452
He has to come to you, He has to give you, He has to do the job.

00:23:32.566 --> 00:23:35.003
This is like a kick you get, you see?

00:23:35.074 --> 00:23:40.338
What you call a kick, that kind of a kick which brings you down.

00:23:40.381 --> 00:23:44.540
It gives you a kick. The way it is given a kick, you come down the same way.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.381
Nowhere in the scriptures described it.

00:23:52.196 --> 00:23:54.846
Either you wipe out all the history of human beings

00:23:54.906 --> 00:23:57.487
and put these horrible people on the list,

00:23:57.596 --> 00:24:04.846
or this, their behaviour, their theories,

00:24:04.967 --> 00:24:08.465
must tally with the theories of the previous people.

00:24:09.336 --> 00:24:12.175
They must relate to that.

00:24:12.195 --> 00:24:16.516
So as I say, this is not a superficial thing, just a kick.

00:24:16.596 --> 00:24:21.089
It’s a deep, embedded thing, which works out, flowers out.

00:24:21.089 --> 00:24:24.079
It’s a reality,

00:24:24.069 --> 00:24:25.619
and reality takes time.

00:24:27.589 --> 00:24:33.365
Thousands of people going to Rajneesh itself suggest that it is plastic.

00:24:40.068 --> 00:24:43.568
There are gurus and gurus one better than other.

00:24:43.574 --> 00:24:46.213
Can I [UNCLEAR] Dalai Lama?

00:24:47.425 --> 00:24:50.705
What Dalai Lama has done, also? Think about it.

00:24:50.816 --> 00:24:54.115
See, what you should do is to use your brains.

00:24:54.115 --> 00:24:57.605
Because somebody is a Dalai Lama must you accept?

00:24:57.644 --> 00:25:01.744
All right, what Dalai Lama has done, think it over.

00:25:02.565 --> 00:25:05.509
Has he given Realization to anyone?

00:25:05.509 --> 00:25:08.069
Has he transformed anybody’s life,

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.789
by which his life has become a king of happiness, joy?

00:25:18.819 --> 00:25:22.188
Has he given any peace to anyone? Think it over.

00:25:22.268 --> 00:25:25.627
You see, somebody says, “Now this is the place where you will get peace.”

00:25:25.728 --> 00:25:29.048
You at least see the people who are coming out of it.

00:25:31.298 --> 00:25:36.798
Dalai Lama, I never knew was such a crook, to be very frank,

00:25:36.877 --> 00:25:43.357
till I sat just next to him because my husband was with the Prime Minister in Tibet.

00:25:43.367 --> 00:25:47.478
The Prime Minister sat, so I could not come out, Lal Bahadur Shastri. So I sat next to him.

00:25:47.538 --> 00:25:49.759
I was just burning, all burning.

00:25:49.878 --> 00:25:56.929
So the Prime Minister said, “What’s the matter?” I said, “Oh, God”, I said, “Ma” in Hindi language, I said “You put Me on the other side”.

00:25:58.868 --> 00:26:03.221
He was a parasite, these Tibetians were such poor people.

00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:05.536
Sit down, sit down, good.

00:26:06.425 --> 00:26:10.707
He was just a parasite… Hello, how are you? Better? Now, that’s it.

00:26:10.717 --> 00:26:13.967
Come along, sit down. If you want you can take another…Yes, good.

00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:30.327
He was like a parasite, and they were so poor, Tibetans were so poor, where as this man had nothing but some spirits, because of supraconscious.

00:26:31.249 --> 00:26:33.835
You will see that in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:34.525 --> 00:26:38.035
See, we have people in this country who have called these spirits,

00:26:38.125 --> 00:26:42.775
what you call these, as we call it a Smashan Vidya.

00:26:42.855 --> 00:26:44.836
What do you say to Smashan in English?

00:26:46.276 --> 00:26:49.675
Crematorium, the knowledge of the crematorium you see.

00:26:49.736 --> 00:26:54.242
So they master some of the spirits, and they use these spirits for this purpose.

00:26:54.282 --> 00:26:57.353
They will tell you what horse you are going to win.

00:26:57.383 --> 00:26:59.403
Even that they can tell you.

00:26:59.462 --> 00:27:03.577
Now we must understand what is the interest of God in these things.

00:27:05.407 --> 00:27:08.938
Why should God tell you who is going to win the horse,

00:27:09.038 --> 00:27:12.417
what’s wrong with your father, who is going to become Dalai Lama, this, that?

00:27:12.468 --> 00:27:14.520
God has no interest in all that.

00:27:14.592 --> 00:27:18.832
He has only one interest, only one interest,

00:27:18.922 --> 00:27:24.901
that you become your self, that you get connected with the mains

00:27:24.921 --> 00:27:28.416
and start understanding Him

00:27:28.431 --> 00:27:33.385
and that the instrument that you are should have your fulfilment.

00:27:33.465 --> 00:27:35.786
That’s the only interest He has.

00:27:35.806 --> 00:27:43.558
He doesn’t believe in giving you gifts and these experiences so-called of such sort of a hashish and things, no.

00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:49.558
He wants to give you the complete understanding of yourself through your awareness.

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:53.949
It’s an actualisation. It is not just lecturing that I lecture you.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.130
Actually I was not going to give you a lecture because you said, “You must give us a lecture,” so I am giving you.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.071
You ask them. I’ve been working on their back for hours together now.

00:28:03.122 --> 00:28:06.538
He will tell you, from Denmark.

00:28:07.848 --> 00:28:09.547
I have to work hard.

00:28:12.498 --> 00:28:17.567
While this Rajneesh works no hard and he has made forty crores of rupees.

00:28:18.468 --> 00:28:21.438
Just he is telling you that you go into sex like this.

00:28:21.448 --> 00:28:27.086
I still cannot understand how can you ask for a guru for this.

00:28:29.425 --> 00:28:31.974
Even a dog and a bitch knows.

00:28:35.484 --> 00:28:40.237
Don’t debase yourselves. You are the Spirit. You are not sex points.

00:28:43.965 --> 00:28:49.690
He will lead you to impotency, complete impotency.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:52.970
He’ll destroy you completely.

00:28:53.829 --> 00:28:56.279
He’s just trying to pamper your ego.

00:28:56.309 --> 00:29:02.058
He’s just trying to say, “Oh, you are great, you are…” Then “You’ll go there... oh you are very great.”

00:29:02.189 --> 00:29:05.959
If you are a rich man then you are even greater.

00:29:08.878 --> 00:29:11.615
He knows all about your status and everything.

00:29:15.434 --> 00:29:17.884
He has all the interest in the rich people.

00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:25.028
In India also he’s using the Indian women who are rich women and supplying them with men.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:32.536
We had a boy known as Mario, who came to me and told me that he was used by a lady of sixty-five years old for six months

00:29:32.558 --> 00:29:36.648
and this lady was giving money to him. I know her name also. Her name is Sharmishta

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:41.092
I get disciples from him who are disillusioned.

00:29:42.425 --> 00:29:49.473
But I would blame your brains only that you cannot understand these things.

00:29:49.501 --> 00:29:51.138
How can he?

00:29:52.009 --> 00:29:55.967
You understand machines, but you don’t understand human beings.

00:30:05.499 --> 00:30:07.942
He plays on your ego,

00:30:07.952 --> 00:30:11.063
he pampers your ego

00:30:12.363 --> 00:30:14.833
and you like it.

00:30:19.383 --> 00:30:24.358
You have forgotten Christ completely. What was Christ like?

00:30:25.699 --> 00:30:26.989
He was a good man.

00:30:27.048 --> 00:30:28.161
He was a very good man

00:30:28.221 --> 00:30:37.624
He was very, very…. full of knowledge more than other people at His time.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.854
Not only.

00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:41.773
If He lives now He would, He would…

00:30:41.792 --> 00:30:42.863
You would deny Him.

00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:45.315
unclear

00:30:45.335 --> 00:30:47.204
No, they would not.

00:30:47.275 --> 00:30:50.753
You would deny Him much more than you would deny anybody else, because

00:30:50.753 --> 00:30:55.936
you see, He would not fit in to your conception of heavenly and Godly people.

00:30:55.942 --> 00:31:00.449
But only through Sahaja Yoga you will know that Christ exists within you here.

00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:04.380
You will know that He is there.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:10.111
You see when the Kundalini stops here you have to say Lord’s Prayer and you have to take the name of Christ.

00:31:10.851 --> 00:31:14.220
Indians do it just like that because they know who He is,

00:31:14.221 --> 00:31:19.000
they know more than you people.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:25.862
I was thinking that still in everybody of us there’s a Father God working. So we can...

00:31:25.891 --> 00:31:29.511
You can become that, all right. That’s it, that’s it, I’m

00:31:29.536 --> 00:31:39.236
I came just to see You. I’ve seen You one year ago, I don’t know. You must remember, I’ve seen You in Delhi, Gandhi Bavan. You were there, about a year ago.

00:31:39.317 --> 00:31:39.863
Is it?

00:31:39.895 --> 00:31:44.026
Yes…. You gave Spontaneous Realization

00:31:45.256 --> 00:31:50.593
So now, that’s what I am saying that there is a part in you now I will tell you today, once for good, all right? Now.

00:31:54.053 --> 00:31:57.593
Now this is the human being and [unclear]… All right?

00:31:57.663 --> 00:31:59.663
Now please pay attention fully.

00:31:59.792 --> 00:32:02.286
Just see here.

00:32:05.675 --> 00:32:10.973
Here now this is the human being

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:16.094
or you have read that God has made man in His own image.

00:32:16.099 --> 00:32:21.578
So God also, you can say, this is a microcosm

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:23.499
or the base.

00:32:23.507 --> 00:32:31.799
Great God and you all are the cells in Him. Made in the same image as this one is.

00:32:33.904 --> 00:32:35.650
Now how are you made?

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:42.403
You are made from amoeba to a human being. All right?

00:32:42.403 --> 00:32:46.625
First you were even carbon, even matter.

00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:51.336
You were evolved from amoeba to this stage.

00:32:55.185 --> 00:32:57.345
Why were you evolved?

00:32:57.375 --> 00:33:01.194
How were you evolved, that you know. But why?

00:33:04.924 --> 00:33:09.525
These are different places of your evolution.

00:33:10.865 --> 00:33:14.041
Like when you are making a machine

00:33:14.055 --> 00:33:19.702
first you create a part of it, the base and then the upper part and the upper part, like that.

00:33:19.752 --> 00:33:25.690
The whole being that you are is created like this

00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:31.968
and these are the three main undercurrents, which have made you as a human being.

00:33:36.228 --> 00:33:42.068
This, this one, the first one , gives you the existence, the first one.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.550
This channel is called as the Ida Nadi.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:57.681
This channel gives you existence and passes over your heart where resides your Spirit.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.788
The Spirit has nothing to do….

00:34:05.837 --> 00:34:10.498
Come in, come in, come in.

00:34:10.994 --> 00:34:14.403
Sit down.

00:34:21.148 --> 00:34:24.088
Sit down. You can come this side.

00:34:24.108 --> 00:34:28.646
The men can sit that side. You can come this side, and the ladies can…

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:38.173
Ah, you can sit there. They will come to this side. All the men should move this side. The ladies can sit there. It’s all right.

00:34:47.664 --> 00:34:54.838
So Indians know this better, that because it has the Virata, you see,

00:34:54.856 --> 00:35:02.880
God Almighty you can say, the Virata, in which we are small cells in His being.

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:07.530
We are made the same way as the Virata is made,

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.233
the Great Primordial Being, is Virata.

00:35:11.432 --> 00:35:19.032
In that blue line that you see is the undercurrent for our existence

00:35:19.152 --> 00:35:22.373
and called as Ida channel within us.

00:35:22.382 --> 00:35:26.469
Now these are subtle channels within us.

00:35:26.471 --> 00:35:34.507
It is for our existence and also it gives us the activity of our emotional life, left side.

00:35:35.617 --> 00:35:39.431
Also it gives you your subconscious area.

00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:47.103
Where whatever you are listening to Me now, goes into that, in your past.

00:35:47.121 --> 00:35:54.617
This is a recording of all your past and all the subtle recording of your past goes into this.

00:35:58.668 --> 00:36:03.106
On the right side there is another channel here,

00:36:03.126 --> 00:36:05.666
which is golden colour.

00:36:06.556 --> 00:36:13.335
This one is called as the Pingala Nadi or the Sun line.

00:36:13.329 --> 00:36:19.697
This is the Moon line and this is the Sun line within us called as Pingala Nadi,

00:36:19.726 --> 00:36:28.201
which gives us the physical being of our physical being and also our mental being.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:32.762
So we have left and right, two channels, Ida and Pingala.

00:36:32.831 --> 00:36:37.364
One is the moon line, another is the sun line.

00:36:37.371 --> 00:36:45.097
Now, this one outside is expressed, these two are expressed outside, this is the subtle current inside.

00:36:45.157 --> 00:36:51.518
In the medical terminology you can call them left and right sympathetic nervous systems.

00:36:53.637 --> 00:36:57.264
In the centre is our evolutionary path

00:36:58.364 --> 00:37:06.541
by which arising from the amoeba stage, from here, we have gone up gradually like that.

00:37:06.592 --> 00:37:12.664
From here we came first of all, from the carbon state to the amoeba state.

00:37:12.724 --> 00:37:24.034
Then we rose and there have been altogether nine incarnations so far of the Divine power of evolution.

00:37:24.144 --> 00:37:32.045
So here the aspects of evolutionary Divine Power work

00:37:32.074 --> 00:37:39.846
while this side the aspect of the existence and desire, aspect of God work

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:47.277
and this side this is physical being and the mental being or the creative being works on that.

00:37:49.552 --> 00:37:53.891
So God has mainly three aspects:

00:37:53.902 --> 00:37:56.668
one is the existence;

00:37:56.672 --> 00:37:58.822
second is the creation;

00:37:58.942 --> 00:38:01.481
and the third is the evolutionary aspect.

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:12.628
This one represents the Shiva Tattwa, is the principle of Shiva or Sadashiva.

00:38:12.677 --> 00:38:17.601
This is the first and the last, it starts with this,

00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:20.686
manifests all this, again dissolves back.

00:38:20.786 --> 00:38:23.177
That’s why it is called as Sadashiva.

00:38:24.626 --> 00:38:30.996
Then the second principle of creation is represented by Brahmadeva

00:38:30.981 --> 00:38:34.713
and His power is called as Saraswati.

00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:38.364
The third one in the centre, which is evolutionary,

00:38:38.387 --> 00:38:44.737
is manifested through the incarnation of Vishnu,

00:38:44.797 --> 00:38:47.108
of Shri Vishnu.

00:38:47.115 --> 00:38:50.596
Shri Vishnu is here

00:38:50.686 --> 00:38:55.235
and when He grows to his full maturity He becomes this Virata.

00:38:58.856 --> 00:39:03.378
You go on developing from here up to this point.

00:39:03.393 --> 00:39:08.088
When you reach that point then only your Sahasrara,

00:39:08.106 --> 00:39:09.565
this

00:39:11.726 --> 00:39:17.177
petaled, as a thousand lotus petals, opens;

00:39:17.179 --> 00:39:22.239
it has got thousand petals. But you have to grow into a human being.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:29.280
Now this is the point, lowest, is the centre,

00:39:29.278 --> 00:39:34.628
is the centre of innocence, occupied by Shri Ganesha,

00:39:35.969 --> 00:39:40.563
it has nothing to do with the evolutionary piercing.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:48.240
You see, this, this force that is here, the force residual energy that is here, the Kundalini, passes above it.

00:39:48.851 --> 00:39:53.648
Only this controls the protocol of this force,

00:39:53.708 --> 00:39:58.958
which is inside; this is the triangular bone called as the coccyx.

00:39:59.038 --> 00:40:01.188
You have got the triangular bone.

00:40:01.248 --> 00:40:05.760
This energy is placed in this; you can say like the coil it is kept there.

00:40:05.768 --> 00:40:12.188
This is the main. So this coil has to come out to go to the mains.

00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:16.617
Now this is a living process.

00:40:16.677 --> 00:40:21.677
It is an evolutionary, divine process.

00:40:21.737 --> 00:40:24.838
You cannot pay for it, first thing.

00:40:24.898 --> 00:40:27.568
It’s like the plumule

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:32.978
or you can call it, it is like the

00:40:33.168 --> 00:40:39.231
germinating force of a seed which sprouts by itself.

00:40:39.282 --> 00:40:42.862
You cannot force it.

00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:46.172
You cannot.

00:40:46.568 --> 00:40:49.621
You cannot do it.

00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:55.340
It just works spontaneously through the grace of a Realized soul.

00:40:58.851 --> 00:41:02.748
You cannot do anything about it except for one thing

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:05.427
that is this portion,

00:41:05.568 --> 00:41:09.637
which you see here it gets stuck.

00:41:09.719 --> 00:41:17.150
This is the place where a human sustenance is regulated.

00:41:19.112 --> 00:41:23.574
This is the part of sustenance, of evolution.

00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:29.568
Now this portion of the stomach

00:41:29.659 --> 00:41:32.668
is being sustained

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:44.190
and is guarded and guided by the forces of religion.

00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:51.458
Not the religion you know of outside, like some Brahmins coming and doing Puja, or say some Pope giving you a lecture, not by that,

00:41:52.907 --> 00:41:59.485
but by maintaining it through your balancing system within yourselves,

00:41:59.505 --> 00:42:04.034
leading a life which is balanced and not extreme.

00:42:05.844 --> 00:42:09.135
Any extremes will take you out this side to the left,

00:42:09.188 --> 00:42:13.909
to the subconscious, the collective subconscious or this side to the supraconscious.

00:42:13.938 --> 00:42:17.028
So any extreme is against Me.

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:23.206
All the Ten Commandments described in the Bible

00:42:23.226 --> 00:42:27.956
are the ten religions we have to follow.

00:42:33.385 --> 00:42:37.018
This one is a very important thing for Western people to understand.

00:42:37.039 --> 00:42:40.148
Of course in India they know that.

00:42:40.208 --> 00:42:49.027
I was just telling you that if you ask any Indian that you can reach God through sex, they’ll just pull their ears to hear such a thing.

00:42:52.168 --> 00:42:54.960
But they have been told like this

00:42:55.021 --> 00:42:58.951
and they believe into it. Surprisingly... just imagine.

00:43:00.581 --> 00:43:07.032
Even I mean, my husband when I told him he said that, “No, no. You see, they may not be believing but they must be just trying.

00:43:07.112 --> 00:43:10.003
They cannot. How can they believe such a silly thing?”

00:43:12.983 --> 00:43:17.405
He’s an intelligent Indian and we have many here people intelligent …

00:43:17.425 --> 00:43:20.885
Can you ever think such a thing will be accepted to us in India?

00:43:24.025 --> 00:43:26.411
She’s a lady doctor sitting here.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:33.681
And because this is placed down below here, He’s an embodiment of innocence.

00:43:34.369 --> 00:43:37.735
And this is your Mother, the Kundalini, sitting there.

00:43:37.795 --> 00:43:41.565
She’s your Mother. Everybody has that Mother within them.

00:43:43.635 --> 00:43:47.367
And this Mother has to rise and open it out.

00:43:49.117 --> 00:43:53.367
This is not possible by forcing it. Nothing.

00:43:53.478 --> 00:43:57.818
If you are ready it will work out. Like a candle

00:43:57.878 --> 00:44:04.998
if it is ready, if it is not wet, then an enlightened candle can enlighten it without any difficulty.

00:44:05.057 --> 00:44:10.329
But if the candle is not all right, then the candle has to be put right.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.599
That’s what I’ve been doing for the last three days, you know, is to put your candle right.

00:44:15.889 --> 00:44:19.768
Once the candle is put right, then only the Kundalini is going to rise

00:44:19.898 --> 00:44:27.528
and give you that experience of the being by which you get this Chitananda Lahari,

00:44:27.625 --> 00:44:32.574
these vibrations, which are described in all the Scriptures

00:44:33.875 --> 00:44:42.869
that when you are realized these vibrations start flowing not just talking. I’ve seen many people just talk, “not good vibrations, bad vibrations”. How do you know?

00:44:46.228 --> 00:44:48.844
You are not yet connected to the mains.

00:44:48.838 --> 00:44:56.753
Like this instrument, when you are connected to the mains the record is established, like a computer.

00:44:56.768 --> 00:44:59.014
You are made very carefully.

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:02.643
For thousands of years this body has been created as a human being.

00:45:05.054 --> 00:45:09.083
And this is the last evolutionary thing that has to happen and get.

00:45:10.902 --> 00:45:14.382
For that you don’t have to be very well educated.

00:45:14.501 --> 00:45:16.132
There is no need for you to know much.

00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:19.414
On the contrary, simpler people get it just like that.

00:45:23.184 --> 00:45:27.364
The more you are complicated the more you’ll get problems.

00:45:27.375 --> 00:45:33.228
Now cancer is the answer, because without cancer you will not understand. So cancer has come, just to teach you.

00:45:35.197 --> 00:45:46.217
This is the parasympathetic nervous system in the centre, which is giving you the energy to both the sides, like this. I will show you. This starts…
