00:08.199 --> 00:11.650
then the deity disappears from them, all right?

00:11.641 --> 00:14.170
The attention goes away from the place.

00:14.180 --> 00:17.147
Then they bring the Satan there and play the havoc.

00:18.850 --> 00:23.308
See these tantrikas have no relationship with our ancient Scriptures,

00:23.334 --> 00:24.924
no relationship at all.

00:25.024 --> 00:28.664
For example Rajneesh will never mention any one of our ancient Scriptures,

00:28.664 --> 00:29.814
nothing.

00:29.814 --> 00:32.295
They have no relationship with any deities.

00:32.310 --> 00:33.816
They have no relationship with

00:33.835 --> 00:38.993
any great writers we have had, like Adi Shankaracharya.

00:38.994 --> 00:40.516
Not a word.

00:43.505 --> 00:47.152
Holiness is the basis of religion and spirituality.

00:48.884 --> 00:51.562
In which Scripture this is written?

00:53.015 --> 00:55.173
Does he mean to say that he is,

00:55.174 --> 00:58.865
he has nothing to do with Christ, nothing to do with God,

00:58.954 --> 01:01.784
nothing to do with anyone, but only sex?

01:01.851 --> 01:06.239
Deluded you people are really, why don’t you think are you only sex point?

01:07.013 --> 01:08.962
So many things are written about it.

01:09.102 --> 01:11.783
Because you people wanted.

01:11.802 --> 01:13.403
Audience: (inaudible}

01:13.373 --> 01:14.683
Where is it?

01:14.694 --> 01:15.583
(Inaudible)

01:15.605 --> 01:16.686
No. No, no, no, no.

01:16.676 --> 01:17.783
There’s nothing about sex?

01:17.816 --> 01:19.245
Not a word.

01:19.268 --> 01:20.388
(Questioner Inaudible)

01:20.394 --> 01:21.397
No, no…

01:22.188 --> 01:23.808
What?

01:23.831 --> 01:26.481
You see that way these people have spoiled

01:26.552 --> 01:30.981
even Ashwa Medha Yagna which was the…, such a great thing, you know.

01:31.042 --> 01:34.787
They have used it for their own purpose saying that this is the symbol of this.

01:34.798 --> 01:38.234
Even Shiva and Shakti, nonsensical people call it sex.

01:38.248 --> 01:40.784
How can you do that to God?

01:40.817 --> 01:43.388
You sublimate into that, the greater thing.

01:43.477 --> 01:44.594
What is sex?

01:44.665 --> 01:48.085
Every Dick, Tom, Harry can do sex…

01:48.091 --> 01:49.814
We are used to do it so…

01:49.885 --> 01:50.825
Yes, then what?

01:50.905 --> 01:56.718
That’s why they are telling you to do it and, but if you do it in a wrong way you’ll have diseases,

01:56.737 --> 01:59.697
you’ll have impotency,

01:59.701 --> 02:02.962
no children will be born to you if you misuse it.

02:05.072 --> 02:08.205
There is a sanctity about it.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.467
May I ask you a question?

02:09.455 --> 02:09.985
Yes.

02:09.989 --> 02:12.459
Do you say that one should never use sex?

02:12.519 --> 02:13.788
No, no, one should.

02:13.848 --> 02:15.278
One should be married.

02:15.338 --> 02:16.628
One should use sex.

02:16.639 --> 02:21.015
It’s meant for a happy married life and for having children,

02:21.027 --> 02:24.096
and leading a very happy and a good life.

02:24.127 --> 02:28.645
You must have a good sex life. You see, we do not think of sex at all in India.

02:28.643 --> 02:29.742
Never.

02:29.802 --> 02:31.772
This is spontaneous.

02:31.862 --> 02:34.582
You see, we never think of sex and all this nonsense.

02:34.652 --> 02:36.269
We don’t read about it.

02:36.294 --> 02:42.677
I mean, I can tell you except for few anglicised and westernised Indians whom you meet,

02:42.687 --> 02:45.895
you will hardly find anyone asking. Now they have met villagers.

02:45.903 --> 02:47.433
They don’t even think about sex,

02:47.503 --> 02:51.153
is a thing, relationship with the wife, very sacred relationship.

02:51.213 --> 02:55.808
When you are with your wife, you see you indulge into it at an extreme point.

02:55.818 --> 02:57.419
That’s all.

02:57.419 --> 02:59.378
We do not sit and read about sex.

02:59.438 --> 03:04.014
Why should you read about it? This is spontaneous thing. Why should you read?

03:04.014 --> 03:05.044
I don’t read this.

03:05.115 --> 03:05.835
That’s it.

03:05.884 --> 03:08.034
But that’s what they are doing it.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.094
This is another kind of Hitlerism.

03:13.155 --> 03:17.465
I can tell you this is another kind of a cruelty to human beings.

03:18.675 --> 03:21.106
See, you will be enticed absolutely;

03:21.104 --> 03:24.947
you would not find out, you will not know that this is a mistake.

03:24.935 --> 03:27.713
You’ll get into it and then you’ll realize it’s a mistake.

03:27.794 --> 03:30.084
This is a destruction of your own being.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.223
By wars you have destroyed others.

03:33.294 --> 03:35.364
By this you will destroy yourself.

03:38.794 --> 03:41.335
What I say has a bearing in the Bible,

03:41.414 --> 03:42.905
has a bearing in Koran,

03:42.905 --> 03:48.623
has a bearing in what you call any of the Scriptures, of Upanishads and all that,

03:48.623 --> 03:50.683
every word of it,

03:50.693 --> 03:54.039
Gita and also of Adi Shankaracharya,

03:54.060 --> 03:56.361
every word of it.

04:01.282 --> 04:05.592
He has made forty crores of rupees.

04:05.592 --> 04:07.502
This also you don’t understand

04:07.502 --> 04:10.013
that he’s playing on your ego.

04:10.013 --> 04:11.623
You think you can purchase him,

04:11.633 --> 04:13.903
you can handle him.

04:13.924 --> 04:17.403
You don’t understand this, you see. He is too cunning for you.

04:19.884 --> 04:24.492
But how can you explain that so many western people

04:24.502 --> 04:25.153
Mad!

04:25.213 --> 04:27.673
went to him and go to him every time?

04:27.723 --> 04:29.932
How can you explain so many Germans

04:29.983 --> 04:33.142
wanted to kill thousands of people

04:33.223 --> 04:36.368
like so many of them were burnt alive

04:36.368 --> 04:41.238
and put in the gas chamber? Do you, can you explain it?

04:42.925 --> 04:45.170
Very easy to befool you people,

04:45.180 --> 04:46.225
very easy.

04:46.214 --> 04:48.795
The trouble is you all think you are very clever.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.324
You can be outwitted by a cleverer cunning fellow.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.369
You are not cunning. You are only clever.

04:55.379 --> 04:59.079
Any cunning man can outwit you just like this.

04:59.088 --> 05:01.269
It’s very easy to befool you.

05:01.269 --> 05:05.478
Then you should also think why is it that Indians do not even take his name in the morning?

05:06.678 --> 05:09.629
Indian Government is anxious to oust him.

05:11.428 --> 05:13.404
Why don’t you think like that?

05:13.399 --> 05:15.774
If India is a place of wisdom,

05:15.785 --> 05:19.324
then why he is not at all respected in this country?

05:20.495 --> 05:27.448
In fact in all houses if name is also mentioned he’s considered most inauspicious

05:27.490 --> 05:31.677
Inauspicious. In his house, you see, if anybody mentions his name

05:31.737 --> 05:34.079
in Indian homes we think it is inauspicious;

05:34.168 --> 05:35.759
we think he’s a Ravana.

05:35.819 --> 05:39.108
He’s the incarnation of Ravana, Rajneesh is.

05:39.949 --> 05:41.651
Incarnation of?

05:41.649 --> 05:42.769
The Ravana.

05:42.793 --> 05:43.432
There is a…

05:43.442 --> 05:46.331
The one who fought against Rama.

05:46.322 --> 05:49.718
Demon, he is a demon no doubt. He is what?  Is he not?

05:49.732 --> 05:54.348
He is, hundred per cent he is Ravana. Be sure of it.

05:58.497 --> 06:04.399
(Shri Mataji talks to a child.)

06:11.680 --> 06:15.230
She’s a born realised child.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.933
He is very nicely playing with your mind.

06:24.406 --> 06:27.333
In London, just imagine, in London,

06:27.343 --> 06:30.130
nine people got hold of a basement

06:30.211 --> 06:34.341
and took out their clothes and danced ecstatically,

06:34.391 --> 06:38.360
just take out all your clothes and say, “No, no, no, no, no, no”.

06:38.401 --> 06:41.004
And they have within five months time, I don’t know,

06:40.995 --> 06:44.545
they have thousands of people. They are buying the whole of London.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.314
Why can’t you see this stupidity?

06:53.595 --> 06:58.331
I mean, at least at the time of Hitler you could say that people had this feeling to kill others.

06:58.435 --> 07:01.785
But in this, to be stupid is the feeling, is it?

07:01.805 --> 07:05.016
Absolute stupidity, nonsense!

07:08.875 --> 07:12.959
If by becoming naked you can reach God,

07:12.985 --> 07:15.988
then in the bathroom every day you are like that.

07:16.749 --> 07:19.738
I told you that don’t go in the sun too much. Be careful.

07:19.798 --> 07:24.293
You see, this is also very wrong the way you expose your body to sun.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.110
You will develop skin cancers.

07:26.161 --> 07:28.521
Believe Me, you will develop skin cancers.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.964
You shouldn’t burn your skin so much.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.884
It's not a good thing, you know.

07:32.901 --> 07:36.375
For sun also, you cover yourself and take the thing.

07:36.404 --> 07:38.555
Otherwise you will develop skin cancers.

07:40.504 --> 07:42.416
You should not overdo anything.

07:42.415 --> 07:45.033
Extremes should be avoided.

07:48.024 --> 07:50.004
That is how you land into difficulties,

07:51.173 --> 07:55.132
How many people in Sweden are committing suicide today?

07:56.223 --> 08:00.091
You are rich people. Why are you committing suicide?

08:00.093 --> 08:03.660
While you find there Indians so happy, don’t you?

08:03.689 --> 08:05.920
They haven’t got riches or anything.

08:05.930 --> 08:07.521
How are they happy?

08:07.519 --> 08:10.500
Even when they are starving they are happier.

08:12.721 --> 08:14.927
Why?

08:14.971 --> 08:17.360
I’m not sure whether they are so…

08:17.411 --> 08:19.480
Not all, not all, but many.

08:19.531 --> 08:28.064
Because India is also [unclear]. They are much influenced by Europeans as well as [unclear].

08:28.101 --> 08:32.471
No, no… They could not influence us… They tried, they tried…

08:32.601 --> 08:34.451
(Unclear)

08:38.331 --> 08:39.467
What is it?

08:39.577 --> 08:40.288
Culture

08:40.307 --> 08:44.488
(Unclear)

08:44.530 --> 08:46.677
What's he saying?

08:46.701 --> 08:52.432
I think he says that also the India’s cultural background has been modified like that, by the West

08:52.501 --> 08:54.561
That is true but still we are Indians.

08:54.581 --> 08:56.522
(Unclear)

08:56.601 --> 08:57.282
Yes, I agree.

08:57.511 --> 09:03.649
But you know it can be about of the mind of the Indian people, you know the source and the education of lot of Indians, you know.

09:03.749 --> 09:06.178
That is what you are doing now to give us ideas.

09:06.269 --> 09:10.094
You see, you people are coming and give us, giving us ideas.

09:10.119 --> 09:13.576
See, we never knew that hashish could be sold like this.

09:13.677 --> 09:16.453
Now you are giving us ideas.

09:16.466 --> 09:19.506
Apart from that you are trying to develop our country,

09:19.576 --> 09:22.297
I agree, I agree,

09:22.307 --> 09:25.919
but there’s a great aggression still on.

09:25.942 --> 09:28.366
But our this culture cannot be destroyed.

09:28.389 --> 09:31.649
Because our culture is a very deep thing,

09:31.720 --> 09:35.389
is very deeply built in our inside, you see.

09:35.399 --> 09:38.629
Our family structures cannot be destroyed easily.

09:38.690 --> 09:44.850
These are just permissions on the periphery, but inside India you cannot enter.

09:44.850 --> 09:45.710
You cannot.

09:47.590 --> 09:52.759
This is also another aggression, you don’t know, for us even the sex is an aggression from you people.

09:52.769 --> 09:54.639
We never had these ideas.

09:56.429 --> 10:00.190
For us it is difficult to maintain these horrible demons in this country

10:00.250 --> 10:03.307
but for you people who are maintaining them there.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.546
We would like them to be sent to you people

10:05.605 --> 10:11.035
so that you leave us alone with our auspiciousness, holiness and spirituality.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.952
It’s a very subtle aggression coming to us and you people are saints.

10:17.023 --> 10:20.442
You must understand you were saints in India in previous lives.

10:22.851 --> 10:25.491
You have to understand our difficulty.

10:28.273 --> 10:30.964
You can have your sex, you can have your sex shops,

10:30.994 --> 10:33.323
you can have all nonsense, all your lives, doesn’t matter,

10:33.403 --> 10:36.134
but for us you spare us now.

10:40.354 --> 10:44.437
In India we have a very, absolutely different ideas about the saint.

10:44.456 --> 10:47.806
A saint has to lead a very holy life.

10:47.817 --> 10:51.691
He has to be a holy person, very kind, affectionate.

10:51.681 --> 10:55.100
He doesn’t take any money from you. He’s not a parasite.

10:55.110 --> 10:56.841
He lives with self-respect.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.642
Villagers just laugh, you see.

11:03.701 --> 11:05.131
They cannot understand.

11:05.192 --> 11:09.331
If you tell them, “Why do you go and sell them hashish?”

11:09.331 --> 11:12.076
They said, “Only the children go and do it. We don’t do it.”

11:12.866 --> 11:16.067
I said, “The children will have the sin. Why do you go and tell them?”

11:16.116 --> 11:20.582
They said, “No, the children can go and have bath in the river, they're innocent they don’t know.

11:22.373 --> 11:25.073
But they are committing sins by doing these things.

11:30.355 --> 11:33.956
You must understand it is a very serious matter, My children.

11:34.075 --> 11:38.263
It’s a very serious matter and responsibility will be your own.

11:39.842 --> 11:44.025
You are saints and how are you going about it?

11:47.105 --> 11:49.655
Where is it, in which Scripture it is written

11:49.726 --> 11:54.807
that sex should be the criteria for a saint?

11:56.307 --> 11:59.142
All right, I don’t say suppress it like that.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.611
Your churches have done nonsensical thing.

12:01.634 --> 12:04.491
Of course, that’s all nonsense, I agree. …

12:04.511 --> 12:06.782
But this is another extreme,

12:06.892 --> 12:09.561
one is the suppression of sex, all right?

12:09.630 --> 12:15.542
Like nunneries and all that. That’s all nonsense, but the other is even worse.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.547
You are going from one extreme to another extreme.

12:21.687 --> 12:24.326
God is in the centre.

12:32.437 --> 12:36.477
This over excitement and these wrong ideas,

12:36.508 --> 12:39.484
I don’t know how I... you should accept.

12:42.903 --> 12:45.504
It is high time you people now understand

12:45.575 --> 12:48.149
because it will be very late, later on.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.975
As you said, “Why” to Me? now I am giving you an example.

12:52.605 --> 12:58.562
It’s a, it’s a… sort of a hypnosis, a kind of a hypnosis.

12:58.581 --> 13:01.331
You are just hypnotised.

13:02.461 --> 13:04.131
He does not explain how he does it.

13:04.201 --> 13:07.384
He does not as I do. They know how to do it themselves.

13:09.214 --> 13:11.783
They know all the methods, how it is done,

13:11.833 --> 13:13.344
how Kundalini is brought up,

13:13.403 --> 13:19.452
how your heart has got the Spirit, which is brought into your parasympathetic.

13:19.472 --> 13:24.211
It’s all written down in our books, how to make it out.

13:24.232 --> 13:26.911
As yesterday, that music you heard?

13:26.941 --> 13:32.671
Of Chitananda Lahari, you see you get these vibrations you must get  in the hands.

13:35.140 --> 13:40.023
This is what is written in our Scriptures, is there, and this is how one has to achieve.

13:43.092 --> 13:46.730
And even a person like Shankaracharya has said

13:46.730 --> 13:51.172
that, “Na yoghe na sankhen”, means “neither by yoga”,

13:51.149 --> 13:55.525
means the way you do Hatha yoga “neither by sankhen it works out”

13:55.529 --> 13:57.870
but it works out through the grace of Mother.

13:59.100 --> 14:02.842
A person like Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya, such a learned man,

14:02.850 --> 14:07.186
who wrote Vivekachudamani, later on he just wrote the praise of Mother, that’s all.

14:07.190 --> 14:09.456
He said, “Nothing more is needed.”

14:12.395 --> 14:14.716
Now Rajneesh is just the opposite of it.

14:14.765 --> 14:18.076
He’s teaching you how to insult your Mother.

14:24.875 --> 14:28.947
Nothing was wrong with Freud as you can say,

14:28.934 --> 14:32.054
because you cannot understand what was wrong with him.

14:32.075 --> 14:36.054
You do not have the complete idea as to what you are.

14:36.075 --> 14:40.274
I will tell you just now what you are and what you have to achieve.

14:40.284 --> 14:42.095
I’m waiting for all of them to come.

14:42.154 --> 14:45.581
You just think over; it’s a very big responsibility.

14:45.662 --> 14:50.731
You people have given up materialism, you have started seeking God.

14:52.163 --> 14:52.851
Why?

14:52.861 --> 14:55.654
Because you were saints in your last life.

14:55.638 --> 15:01.764
It is described that saints would be seeking much more in the Kali Yuga, at this time.

15:01.764 --> 15:08.576
When these demands started all these thugs have also started supplying.

15:14.014 --> 15:18.683
What is the transformation of the person who talks to you intermittently?

15:18.788 --> 15:22.028
What did he get within himself, an experience.

15:22.109 --> 15:24.178
What given experience?

15:24.208 --> 15:28.167
You see if he says," Is an experience." You should say, “Can you make out what’s wrong with me?”

15:28.178 --> 15:29.708
Ask him.

15:29.778 --> 15:31.527
These people can make out.

15:31.537 --> 15:33.976
He told me this chakra is catching,

15:33.976 --> 15:35.940
you will also say.

15:35.927 --> 15:39.480
Isn’t it? I mean, there should be some knowledge of yourself.

15:39.491 --> 15:41.581
You must get some knowledge within yourself.

15:41.652 --> 15:46.402
Your consciousness must have a wider dimension, do you understand?

15:46.392 --> 15:49.234
Now he told me that your left Vishuddhi is catching.

15:49.251 --> 15:52.004
So I asked you left Swadishthan to be, to be settled.

15:52.014 --> 15:54.620
It pains you there also.

15:54.644 --> 15:58.640
Now he doesn’t know where it pains you. How did he tell Me?

15:58.650 --> 15:59.860
See now.

15:59.870 --> 16:03.961
So he could feel that this chakra is catching.

16:04.333 --> 16:04.998
Catched.

16:05.008 --> 16:06.421
Catched, caught up.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.500
Now I asked, “Do you feel guilty?”

16:10.730 --> 16:12.190
That’s it.

16:12.181 --> 16:14.453
It has been other things also.

16:16.892 --> 16:20.562
All of them can tell you. All of them can tell you what’s wrong with you.

16:20.562 --> 16:25.145
Even if you have ten realised children here, if you tie up their eyes

16:25.296 --> 16:29.537
they will tell the same thing, that this is catching in this person and you will also feel the same.

16:29.616 --> 16:33.567
You put your hands and you will feel this finger burning.

16:37.966 --> 16:38.876
See?

16:44.697 --> 16:48.616
When your sensitivity will improve you will also tell about others.

16:52.628 --> 16:55.961
It is your instrument must start working.

16:55.951 --> 16:58.138
What are the experiences you are talking about?

16:58.128 --> 17:02.878
Like a hashish experience, then like a hallucination experience,

17:02.947 --> 17:06.667
then other experience; you had many like that, you see.

17:06.728 --> 17:12.978
“I was very high. Somebody says I’m very high.” But what did you get?

17:12.998 --> 17:18.357
You see, you are, you are just regarding to something by some sort of a chemical thing or a hypnosis.

17:20.317 --> 17:22.518
Still all of us have not come.

17:23.728 --> 17:25.557
You have taken the photographs?

17:25.657 --> 17:29.294
Very nice then, I must say. I have professional photographs also.

17:29.374 --> 17:32.794
I think you are very good. Did a good job and we were all surprised.

17:32.844 --> 17:37.513
If you want you can take just now but they all have not yet arrived

17:47.659 --> 17:51.598
No, but let Mr. George come and see Me. Tell him. Because he still gets sick, you see.

17:51.782 --> 17:55.722
I must get him cured. You tell him today because tomorrow I won’t have any chance.

17:55.936 --> 17:56.707
All right?

17:58.366 --> 17:59.916
If you want you can.

17:59.924 --> 18:02.936
Come along, come forward.

18:05.817 --> 18:08.196
This sit space is free if you want to get…

18:12.508 --> 18:16.738
Now you are better. Much better now, see.

18:19.768 --> 18:24.655
See, you are in a way more sort of connected with Sanskrit language, you see.

18:24.669 --> 18:28.796
You are the vehicle now for Sanskrit language.

18:28.823 --> 18:34.232
But I was surprised that how Germans were influenced by these horrible tantrikas.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.949
They, they don’t know superficial things.

18:37.965 --> 18:43.135
You know, to know about tantrikas is like entering into the house through the sewage.

18:46.086 --> 18:51.380
First enter into the sewage only and then they got, I mean they never got any knowledge.

18:51.390 --> 18:54.749
No German has written about Shankaracharya. Most surprising.

18:56.358 --> 18:57.628
Not a word.

18:58.598 --> 19:04.178
They have written books after books over tantrikas, which is sewage for us, absolutely sewage.

19:05.013 --> 19:11.347
They could never enter because perhaps some way or other they were guided into it or taken into it.

19:11.367 --> 19:14.087
Mislaid completely.

19:16.417 --> 19:20.771
Even Jung I was surprised, even Jung, you see.

19:20.832 --> 19:28.556
Poor thing, you know, they, they come to whatever they read and whatever it is, they could never reach the reality.

19:28.586 --> 19:30.846
We have to reach to the bone of this country.

19:30.905 --> 19:35.016
Then only you’ll get that peace and bliss which is promised.

19:35.036 --> 19:38.334
You must understand them not from outside but from inside.

19:39.354 --> 19:41.564
For that you have to go inside.

19:41.673 --> 19:48.672
But these all superficial experiences, if you depend on, then what’s the use?

20:05.531 --> 20:08.935
What’s your name? You’ve done really that photograph?

20:10.395 --> 20:11.516
Eldon?

20:11.625 --> 20:12.455
Really?

20:13.996 --> 20:15.816
You see here you’re walking or what?

20:21.965 --> 20:24.295
That’s all right. She has got light also.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.355
Whatever comes in, in a general way…

20:34.829 --> 20:37.192
This is a very subtle happening;

20:37.243 --> 20:39.261
it’s a very, very subtle happening.

20:39.332 --> 20:47.238
It is not a gross happening where you think of women and think of these dirty things that you’ve before liked having casinos and busy life.

20:47.240 --> 20:50.240
It is not like this. It’s a deep happening.

20:51.810 --> 20:58.671
It’s a very, very deep happening and a very subtle happening for you will have to be very, very religious people.

21:01.121 --> 21:04.949
While you have no idea of religion in that country, I can tell you.

21:04.979 --> 21:08.288
Religion is within, not without.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.659
Like there are some priests and they are coming …

21:10.808 --> 21:12.196
"We don’t believe in our priests

21:12.267 --> 21:16.317
just for play sake we do, but we don’t think that they are saints."

21:16.487 --> 21:18.257
Saints are very different.

21:22.507 --> 21:28.598
So the value of saints is so much reduced because your Pope has started certifying somebody as a saint.

21:28.679 --> 21:30.939
Naturally the Pope himself is not a saint.

21:31.019 --> 21:33.721
How does he know somebody is a saint or not?

21:34.691 --> 21:42.560
So I don’t blame you, naturally. You are quite a sort of disillusioned,

21:42.721 --> 21:44.303
absolutely correct.

21:44.383 --> 21:48.549
but, by just one disillusionment you don't go to another illusion also.

21:53.905 --> 21:55.884
What is the reality?

21:57.721 --> 22:05.137
By knowing yourself you should know your inner being and you should know the inner beings of others, isn’t it, Peter?

22:05.141 --> 22:08.785
Supposing you are an engineer, take it like that, all right?

22:08.750 --> 22:12.375
If you are an engineer, if you have become an engineer

22:12.381 --> 22:17.723
you will know about the instruments that are in your house and in anybody else’s houses.

22:22.344 --> 22:24.903
Sit down, sit down.

22:27.126 --> 22:32.019
This is what should happen, by knowing self-knowledge means knowing yourself.

22:32.038 --> 22:34.378
What are you thinking about these experiences?

22:34.378 --> 22:39.814
You see, anybody can give you by putting you out somewhere.

22:44.880 --> 22:54.574
The experience of the Spirit is that by which you get the knowledge of your being and the knowledge of another person.

22:59.384 --> 23:03.869
Then something that you cannot achieve yourself,

23:03.876 --> 23:07.201
It has to come as grace to you. It has to come as grace.

23:07.330 --> 23:12.191
If you can achieve God then He is no more God.

23:14.570 --> 23:18.686
If He is the Almighty then you cannot capture Him.

23:18.777 --> 23:24.452
He has to come to you, He has to give you, He has to do the job.

23:32.566 --> 23:35.003
This is like a kick you get, you see?

23:35.074 --> 23:40.338
What you call a kick, that kind of a kick which brings you down.

23:40.381 --> 23:44.540
It gives you a kick. The way it is given a kick, you come down the same way.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.381
Nowhere in the scriptures described it.

23:52.196 --> 23:54.846
Either you wipe out all the history of human beings

23:54.906 --> 23:57.487
and put these horrible people on the list,

23:57.596 --> 24:04.846
or this, their behaviour, their theories,

24:04.967 --> 24:08.465
must tally with the theories of the previous people.

24:09.336 --> 24:12.175
They must relate to that.

24:12.195 --> 24:16.516
So as I say, this is not a superficial thing, just a kick.

24:16.596 --> 24:21.089
It’s a deep, embedded thing, which works out, flowers out.

24:21.089 --> 24:24.079
It’s a reality,

24:24.069 --> 24:25.619
and reality takes time.

24:27.589 --> 24:33.365
Thousands of people going to Rajneesh itself suggest that it is plastic.

24:40.068 --> 24:43.568
There are gurus and gurus one better than other.

24:43.574 --> 24:46.213
Can I [UNCLEAR] Dalai Lama?

24:47.425 --> 24:50.705
What Dalai Lama has done, also? Think about it.

24:50.816 --> 24:54.115
See, what you should do is to use your brains.

24:54.115 --> 24:57.605
Because somebody is a Dalai Lama must you accept?

24:57.644 --> 25:01.744
All right, what Dalai Lama has done, think it over.

25:02.565 --> 25:05.509
Has he given Realization to anyone?

25:05.509 --> 25:08.069
Has he transformed anybody’s life,

25:08.140 --> 25:12.789
by which his life has become a king of happiness, joy?

25:18.819 --> 25:22.188
Has he given any peace to anyone? Think it over.

25:22.268 --> 25:25.627
You see, somebody says, “Now this is the place where you will get peace.”

25:25.728 --> 25:29.048
You at least see the people who are coming out of it.

25:31.298 --> 25:36.798
Dalai Lama, I never knew was such a crook, to be very frank,

25:36.877 --> 25:43.357
till I sat just next to him because my husband was with the Prime Minister in Tibet.

25:43.367 --> 25:47.478
The Prime Minister sat, so I could not come out, Lal Bahadur Shastri. So I sat next to him.

25:47.538 --> 25:49.759
I was just burning, all burning.

25:49.878 --> 25:56.929
So the Prime Minister said, “What’s the matter?” I said, “Oh, God”, I said, “Ma” in Hindi language, I said “You put Me on the other side”.

25:58.868 --> 26:03.221
He was a parasite, these Tibetians were such poor people.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.536
Sit down, sit down, good.

26:06.425 --> 26:10.707
He was just a parasite… Hello, how are you? Better? Now, that’s it.

26:10.717 --> 26:13.967
Come along, sit down. If you want you can take another…Yes, good.

26:21.847 --> 26:30.327
He was like a parasite, and they were so poor, Tibetans were so poor, where as this man had nothing but some spirits, because of supraconscious.

26:31.249 --> 26:33.835
You will see that in Sahaja Yoga.

26:34.525 --> 26:38.035
See, we have people in this country who have called these spirits,

26:38.125 --> 26:42.775
what you call these, as we call it a Smashan Vidya.

26:42.855 --> 26:44.836
What do you say to Smashan in English?

26:46.276 --> 26:49.675
Crematorium, the knowledge of the crematorium you see.

26:49.736 --> 26:54.242
So they master some of the spirits, and they use these spirits for this purpose.

26:54.282 --> 26:57.353
They will tell you what horse you are going to win.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.403
Even that they can tell you.

26:59.462 --> 27:03.577
Now we must understand what is the interest of God in these things.

27:05.407 --> 27:08.938
Why should God tell you who is going to win the horse,

27:09.038 --> 27:12.417
what’s wrong with your father, who is going to become Dalai Lama, this, that?

27:12.468 --> 27:14.520
God has no interest in all that.

27:14.592 --> 27:18.832
He has only one interest, only one interest,

27:18.922 --> 27:24.901
that you become your self, that you get connected with the mains

27:24.921 --> 27:28.416
and start understanding Him

27:28.431 --> 27:33.385
and that the instrument that you are should have your fulfilment.

27:33.465 --> 27:35.786
That’s the only interest He has.

27:35.806 --> 27:43.558
He doesn’t believe in giving you gifts and these experiences so-called of such sort of a hashish and things, no.

27:44.367 --> 27:49.558
He wants to give you the complete understanding of yourself through your awareness.

27:49.559 --> 27:53.949
It’s an actualisation. It is not just lecturing that I lecture you.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.130
Actually I was not going to give you a lecture because you said, “You must give us a lecture,” so I am giving you.

27:59.240 --> 28:03.071
You ask them. I’ve been working on their back for hours together now.

28:03.122 --> 28:06.538
He will tell you, from Denmark.

28:07.848 --> 28:09.547
I have to work hard.

28:12.498 --> 28:17.567
While this Rajneesh works no hard and he has made forty crores of rupees.

28:18.468 --> 28:21.438
Just he is telling you that you go into sex like this.

28:21.448 --> 28:27.086
I still cannot understand how can you ask for a guru for this.

28:29.425 --> 28:31.974
Even a dog and a bitch knows.

28:35.484 --> 28:40.237
Don’t debase yourselves. You are the Spirit. You are not sex points.

28:43.965 --> 28:49.690
He will lead you to impotency, complete impotency.

28:50.910 --> 28:52.970
He’ll destroy you completely.

28:53.829 --> 28:56.279
He’s just trying to pamper your ego.

28:56.309 --> 29:02.058
He’s just trying to say, “Oh, you are great, you are…” Then “You’ll go there... oh you are very great.”

29:02.189 --> 29:05.959
If you are a rich man then you are even greater.

29:08.878 --> 29:11.615
He knows all about your status and everything.

29:15.434 --> 29:17.884
He has all the interest in the rich people.

29:17.944 --> 29:25.028
In India also he’s using the Indian women who are rich women and supplying them with men.

29:25.040 --> 29:32.536
We had a boy known as Mario, who came to me and told me that he was used by a lady of sixty-five years old for six months

29:32.558 --> 29:36.648
and this lady was giving money to him. I know her name also. Her name is Sharmishta

29:38.159 --> 29:41.092
I get disciples from him who are disillusioned.

29:42.425 --> 29:49.473
But I would blame your brains only that you cannot understand these things.

29:49.501 --> 29:51.138
How can he?

29:52.009 --> 29:55.967
You understand machines, but you don’t understand human beings.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.942
He plays on your ego,

30:07.952 --> 30:11.063
he pampers your ego

30:12.363 --> 30:14.833
and you like it.

30:19.383 --> 30:24.358
You have forgotten Christ completely. What was Christ like?

30:25.699 --> 30:26.989
He was a good man.

30:27.048 --> 30:28.161
He was a very good man

30:28.221 --> 30:37.624
He was very, very…. full of knowledge more than other people at His time.

30:37.650 --> 30:38.854
Not only.

30:38.859 --> 30:41.773
If He lives now He would, He would…

30:41.792 --> 30:42.863
You would deny Him.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.315
unclear

30:45.335 --> 30:47.204
No, they would not.

30:47.275 --> 30:50.753
You would deny Him much more than you would deny anybody else, because

30:50.753 --> 30:55.936
you see, He would not fit in to your conception of heavenly and Godly people.

30:55.942 --> 31:00.449
But only through Sahaja Yoga you will know that Christ exists within you here.

31:00.459 --> 31:04.380
You will know that He is there.

31:04.490 --> 31:10.111
You see when the Kundalini stops here you have to say Lord’s Prayer and you have to take the name of Christ.

31:10.851 --> 31:14.220
Indians do it just like that because they know who He is,

31:14.221 --> 31:19.000
they know more than you people.

31:19.020 --> 31:25.862
I was thinking that still in everybody of us there’s a Father God working. So we can...

31:25.891 --> 31:29.511
You can become that, all right. That’s it, that’s it, I’m

31:29.536 --> 31:39.236
I came just to see You. I’ve seen You one year ago, I don’t know. You must remember, I’ve seen You in Delhi, Gandhi Bavan. You were there, about a year ago.

31:39.317 --> 31:39.863
Is it?

31:39.895 --> 31:44.026
Yes…. You gave Spontaneous Realization

31:45.256 --> 31:50.593
So now, that’s what I am saying that there is a part in you now I will tell you today, once for good, all right? Now.

31:54.053 --> 31:57.593
Now this is the human being and [unclear]… All right?

31:57.663 --> 31:59.663
Now please pay attention fully.

31:59.792 --> 32:02.286
Just see here.

32:05.675 --> 32:10.973
Here now this is the human being

32:10.990 --> 32:16.094
or you have read that God has made man in His own image.

32:16.099 --> 32:21.578
So God also, you can say, this is a microcosm

32:21.606 --> 32:23.499
or the base.

32:23.507 --> 32:31.799
Great God and you all are the cells in Him. Made in the same image as this one is.

32:33.904 --> 32:35.650
Now how are you made?

32:37.070 --> 32:42.403
You are made from amoeba to a human being. All right?

32:42.403 --> 32:46.625
First you were even carbon, even matter.

32:46.715 --> 32:51.336
You were evolved from amoeba to this stage.

32:55.185 --> 32:57.345
Why were you evolved?

32:57.375 --> 33:01.194
How were you evolved, that you know. But why?

33:04.924 --> 33:09.525
These are different places of your evolution.

33:10.865 --> 33:14.041
Like when you are making a machine

33:14.055 --> 33:19.702
first you create a part of it, the base and then the upper part and the upper part, like that.

33:19.752 --> 33:25.690
The whole being that you are is created like this

33:25.712 --> 33:31.968
and these are the three main undercurrents, which have made you as a human being.

33:36.228 --> 33:42.068
This, this one, the first one , gives you the existence, the first one.

33:44.080 --> 33:47.550
This channel is called as the Ida Nadi.

33:50.590 --> 33:57.681
This channel gives you existence and passes over your heart where resides your Spirit.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.788
The Spirit has nothing to do….

34:05.837 --> 34:10.498
Come in, come in, come in.

34:10.994 --> 34:14.403
Sit down.

34:21.148 --> 34:24.088
Sit down. You can come this side.

34:24.108 --> 34:28.646
The men can sit that side. You can come this side, and the ladies can…

34:30.639 --> 34:38.173
Ah, you can sit there. They will come to this side. All the men should move this side. The ladies can sit there. It’s all right.

34:47.664 --> 34:54.838
So Indians know this better, that because it has the Virata, you see,

34:54.856 --> 35:02.880
God Almighty you can say, the Virata, in which we are small cells in His being.

35:04.469 --> 35:07.530
We are made the same way as the Virata is made,

35:07.530 --> 35:10.233
the Great Primordial Being, is Virata.

35:11.432 --> 35:19.032
In that blue line that you see is the undercurrent for our existence

35:19.152 --> 35:22.373
and called as Ida channel within us.

35:22.382 --> 35:26.469
Now these are subtle channels within us.

35:26.471 --> 35:34.507
It is for our existence and also it gives us the activity of our emotional life, left side.

35:35.617 --> 35:39.431
Also it gives you your subconscious area.

35:39.481 --> 35:47.103
Where whatever you are listening to Me now, goes into that, in your past.

35:47.121 --> 35:54.617
This is a recording of all your past and all the subtle recording of your past goes into this.

35:58.668 --> 36:03.106
On the right side there is another channel here,

36:03.126 --> 36:05.666
which is golden colour.

36:06.556 --> 36:13.335
This one is called as the Pingala Nadi or the Sun line.

36:13.329 --> 36:19.697
This is the Moon line and this is the Sun line within us called as Pingala Nadi,

36:19.726 --> 36:28.201
which gives us the physical being of our physical being and also our mental being.

36:28.210 --> 36:32.762
So we have left and right, two channels, Ida and Pingala.

36:32.831 --> 36:37.364
One is the moon line, another is the sun line.

36:37.371 --> 36:45.097
Now, this one outside is expressed, these two are expressed outside, this is the subtle current inside.

36:45.157 --> 36:51.518
In the medical terminology you can call them left and right sympathetic nervous systems.

36:53.637 --> 36:57.264
In the centre is our evolutionary path

36:58.364 --> 37:06.541
by which arising from the amoeba stage, from here, we have gone up gradually like that.

37:06.592 --> 37:12.664
From here we came first of all, from the carbon state to the amoeba state.

37:12.724 --> 37:24.034
Then we rose and there have been altogether nine incarnations so far of the Divine power of evolution.

37:24.144 --> 37:32.045
So here the aspects of evolutionary Divine Power work

37:32.074 --> 37:39.846
while this side the aspect of the existence and desire, aspect of God work

37:39.824 --> 37:47.277
and this side this is physical being and the mental being or the creative being works on that.

37:49.552 --> 37:53.891
So God has mainly three aspects:

37:53.902 --> 37:56.668
one is the existence;

37:56.672 --> 37:58.822
second is the creation;

37:58.942 --> 38:01.481
and the third is the evolutionary aspect.

38:03.681 --> 38:12.628
This one represents the Shiva Tattwa, is the principle of Shiva or Sadashiva.

38:12.677 --> 38:17.601
This is the first and the last, it starts with this,

38:17.661 --> 38:20.686
manifests all this, again dissolves back.

38:20.786 --> 38:23.177
That’s why it is called as Sadashiva.

38:24.626 --> 38:30.996
Then the second principle of creation is represented by Brahmadeva

38:30.981 --> 38:34.713
and His power is called as Saraswati.

38:34.731 --> 38:38.364
The third one in the centre, which is evolutionary,

38:38.387 --> 38:44.737
is manifested through the incarnation of Vishnu,

38:44.797 --> 38:47.108
of Shri Vishnu.

38:47.115 --> 38:50.596
Shri Vishnu is here

38:50.686 --> 38:55.235
and when He grows to his full maturity He becomes this Virata.

38:58.856 --> 39:03.378
You go on developing from here up to this point.

39:03.393 --> 39:08.088
When you reach that point then only your Sahasrara,

39:08.106 --> 39:09.565
this

39:11.726 --> 39:17.177
petaled, as a thousand lotus petals, opens;

39:17.179 --> 39:22.239
it has got thousand petals. But you have to grow into a human being.

39:23.710 --> 39:29.280
Now this is the point, lowest, is the centre,

39:29.278 --> 39:34.628
is the centre of innocence, occupied by Shri Ganesha,

39:35.969 --> 39:40.563
it has nothing to do with the evolutionary piercing.

39:40.550 --> 39:48.240
You see, this, this force that is here, the force residual energy that is here, the Kundalini, passes above it.

39:48.851 --> 39:53.648
Only this controls the protocol of this force,

39:53.708 --> 39:58.958
which is inside; this is the triangular bone called as the coccyx.

39:59.038 --> 40:01.188
You have got the triangular bone.

40:01.248 --> 40:05.760
This energy is placed in this; you can say like the coil it is kept there.

40:05.768 --> 40:12.188
This is the main. So this coil has to come out to go to the mains.

40:13.889 --> 40:16.617
Now this is a living process.

40:16.677 --> 40:21.677
It is an evolutionary, divine process.

40:21.737 --> 40:24.838
You cannot pay for it, first thing.

40:24.898 --> 40:27.568
It’s like the plumule

40:27.659 --> 40:32.978
or you can call it, it is like the

40:33.168 --> 40:39.231
germinating force of a seed which sprouts by itself.

40:39.282 --> 40:42.862
You cannot force it.

40:44.291 --> 40:46.172
You cannot.

40:46.568 --> 40:49.621
You cannot do it.

40:49.681 --> 40:55.340
It just works spontaneously through the grace of a Realized soul.

40:58.851 --> 41:02.748
You cannot do anything about it except for one thing

41:02.827 --> 41:05.427
that is this portion,

41:05.568 --> 41:09.637
which you see here it gets stuck.

41:09.719 --> 41:17.150
This is the place where a human sustenance is regulated.

41:19.112 --> 41:23.574
This is the part of sustenance, of evolution.

41:25.389 --> 41:29.568
Now this portion of the stomach

41:29.659 --> 41:32.668
is being sustained

41:34.900 --> 41:44.190
and is guarded and guided by the forces of religion.

41:44.331 --> 41:51.458
Not the religion you know of outside, like some Brahmins coming and doing Puja, or say some Pope giving you a lecture, not by that,

41:52.907 --> 41:59.485
but by maintaining it through your balancing system within yourselves,

41:59.505 --> 42:04.034
leading a life which is balanced and not extreme.

42:05.844 --> 42:09.135
Any extremes will take you out this side to the left,

42:09.188 --> 42:13.909
to the subconscious, the collective subconscious or this side to the supraconscious.

42:13.938 --> 42:17.028
So any extreme is against Me.

42:18.369 --> 42:23.206
All the Ten Commandments described in the Bible

42:23.226 --> 42:27.956
are the ten religions we have to follow.

42:33.385 --> 42:37.018
This one is a very important thing for Western people to understand.

42:37.039 --> 42:40.148
Of course in India they know that.

42:40.208 --> 42:49.027
I was just telling you that if you ask any Indian that you can reach God through sex, they’ll just pull their ears to hear such a thing.

42:52.168 --> 42:54.960
But they have been told like this

42:55.021 --> 42:58.951
and they believe into it. Surprisingly... just imagine.

43:00.581 --> 43:07.032
Even I mean, my husband when I told him he said that, “No, no. You see, they may not be believing but they must be just trying.

43:07.112 --> 43:10.003
They cannot. How can they believe such a silly thing?”

43:12.983 --> 43:17.405
He’s an intelligent Indian and we have many here people intelligent …

43:17.425 --> 43:20.885
Can you ever think such a thing will be accepted to us in India?

43:24.025 --> 43:26.411
She’s a lady doctor sitting here.

43:29.990 --> 43:33.681
And because this is placed down below here, He’s an embodiment of innocence.

43:34.369 --> 43:37.735
And this is your Mother, the Kundalini, sitting there.

43:37.795 --> 43:41.565
She’s your Mother. Everybody has that Mother within them.

43:43.635 --> 43:47.367
And this Mother has to rise and open it out.

43:49.117 --> 43:53.367
This is not possible by forcing it. Nothing.

43:53.478 --> 43:57.818
If you are ready it will work out. Like a candle

43:57.878 --> 44:04.998
if it is ready, if it is not wet, then an enlightened candle can enlighten it without any difficulty.

44:05.057 --> 44:10.329
But if the candle is not all right, then the candle has to be put right.

44:10.340 --> 44:14.599
That’s what I’ve been doing for the last three days, you know, is to put your candle right.

44:15.889 --> 44:19.768
Once the candle is put right, then only the Kundalini is going to rise

44:19.898 --> 44:27.528
and give you that experience of the being by which you get this Chitananda Lahari,

44:27.625 --> 44:32.574
these vibrations, which are described in all the Scriptures

44:33.875 --> 44:42.869
that when you are realized these vibrations start flowing not just talking. I’ve seen many people just talk, “not good vibrations, bad vibrations”. How do you know?

44:46.228 --> 44:48.844
You are not yet connected to the mains.

44:48.838 --> 44:56.753
Like this instrument, when you are connected to the mains the record is established, like a computer.

44:56.768 --> 44:59.014
You are made very carefully.

44:59.063 --> 45:02.643
For thousands of years this body has been created as a human being.

45:05.054 --> 45:09.083
And this is the last evolutionary thing that has to happen and get.

45:10.902 --> 45:14.382
For that you don’t have to be very well educated.

45:14.501 --> 45:16.132
There is no need for you to know much.

45:16.141 --> 45:19.414
On the contrary, simpler people get it just like that.

45:23.184 --> 45:27.364
The more you are complicated the more you’ll get problems.

45:27.375 --> 45:33.228
Now cancer is the answer, because without cancer you will not understand. So cancer has come, just to teach you.

45:35.197 --> 45:46.217
This is the parasympathetic nervous system in the centre, which is giving you the energy to both the sides, like this. I will show you. This starts…
