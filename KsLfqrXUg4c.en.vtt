Diwali Puja Talk November 1, 1981 Chelsham Road Ashram, London, UK

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.515
Today I told you about the importance of Lakshmi principle

00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:14.914
within us and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.722
and the three processes

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.099
through which we pass.

00:00:24.283 --> 00:00:26.776
First is the Gruha Lakshmi.

00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:33.257
Actually, this is celebrated mostly on the thirteenth day

00:00:33.964 --> 00:00:37.382
of the moon, where they say that

00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:41.296
the housewife has to be given some present.

00:00:43.736 --> 00:00:47.765
And the best thing she can have is a some sort of an utensil.

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:53.222
So people give her some utensils, actually

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:55.247
it’s a very mutual thing, because

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:59.539
if you give an utensil, she is supposed to cook for you.

00:01:04.122 --> 00:01:08.437
It’s a very sweet way of suggesting that you cook something for us.

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:15.343
Then the fourteenth day is very important,

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:24.531
because that is the day the Goddess as a power,

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:31.680
as a power, because it was Kartikeya who killed Narakasura, the devil.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.402
And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed.

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:45.584
So Shiva and Parvati were married

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:50.885
for this special purpose to produce this powerful Shaktiputra,

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:55.037
means the son of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

00:01:56.922 --> 00:02:00.484
And He was just born to kill this horrible devil,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.420
called as Narakasura.

00:02:04.626 --> 00:02:09.385
And He killed. That is the day, fourteenth day.

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:12.587
It is something like Halloween, that day.

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:14.612
Because that is the day they opened

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:21.737
the gates of hell and put all the devils into hell.

00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:28.057
And that’s why that day one has to rest in the morning time as long as possible.

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:31.907
So that let all the devils be put in nicely

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:36.274
because some of them might be hanging around still.

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:40.124
It’s better to allow them to get out.

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:43.147
I mean in the realm that you are

00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:45.860
you do not feel much their existence.

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:49.981
But if you were in the realm of subconscious area or collective subconscious,

00:02:51.547 --> 00:02:54.123
people see even some of the spirits

00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:56.198
and also can feel their existence,

00:02:56.278 --> 00:02:58.138
they see the black spots and all that.

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:04.276
So that day is very dangerous,

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:08.005
but because Narakasura was killed,

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:12.043
people celebrated.

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:17.218
That celebration is expressed next day,

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:21.905
which that day is the day of Diwali they say.

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:25.868
That is the day they also worship Lakshmi, because

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:29.217
they think that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.429
that’s the day Lakshmi was born on this earth

00:03:33.223 --> 00:03:36.830
from the sea as I told you last time.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.447
Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards,

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:47.356
because in India in the north,

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:50.759
that’s the time people finish their crops

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:56.440
and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year.

00:03:57.488 --> 00:03:58.226
And,

00:04:01.152 --> 00:04:07.155
that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India,

00:04:07.412 --> 00:04:09.701
we need not use that,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.915
what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.940
say in Maharastra they have another New Year, as I told you where

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.759
Shalivahana in his dynasty started another

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:27.483
calendar and they celebrate that.

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:30.849
So all these things are nothing is rigid

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:34.214
about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid.

00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:37.813
Rigidity comes from ignorance.

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:41.632
It’s all for you, for your joy and happiness.

00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:44.418
The whole festival system is for your happiness

00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:48.225
and not for the happiness of the time or date.

00:04:48.536 --> 00:04:52.550
It’s for you, so it should be adjustable according to your

00:04:53.713 --> 00:04:56.625
needs and understanding.

00:04:57.984 --> 00:05:00.896
And also according to your

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.120
national way you live.

00:05:04.313 --> 00:05:08.260
They should be no addiction to any

00:05:08.277 --> 00:05:13.109
particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas.

00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:16.822
It’s all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for gods.

00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:18.745
They don’t have these festivals.

00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:22.060
It’s only for you people these festivals are there.

00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:26.203
And when you celebrate them, that’s only for your joy and your happiness.

00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:29.020
And that’s how you should celebrate in a way

00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:32.999
that gives you the greatest amount of happiness.

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.506
And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated.

00:05:37.818 --> 00:05:40.378
The more you are festive, the happier it is.

00:05:41.155 --> 00:05:43.769
Why miss the chance, you see.

00:05:44.162 --> 00:05:49.800
So as Sahaja Yogis you can celebrate, you can’t put yourselves in yawn.

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:06.460
So as a Sahaja Yogi you don’t belong to any particular

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.937
caste or community anymore now, you belong to universal caste.

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:13.512
Once you start belonging to the universal thing,

00:06:13.718 --> 00:06:16.763
then you can celebrate all the festivals of all the religions.

00:06:16.963 --> 00:06:18.714
And have the best of it.

00:06:20.634 --> 00:06:24.164
All the year out, you can celebrate all the festivals. Know about them,

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:26.526
the more you know, the better it is.

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.251
And have all kinds of sweets,

00:06:29.461 --> 00:06:32.840
whatever you use, whatever type you use, in whatever

00:06:33.146 --> 00:06:36.542
areas and countries and cultures. And that’s how

00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:42.497
we have to be more festive.

00:06:43.702 --> 00:06:47.097
Now the last day is very important,

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:50.092
is a very universal day I should say, called as

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.705
Bhaiya Duja, this day,

00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:56.453
or they call it also in Marathi Vao Dijum,

00:06:56.918 --> 00:07:00.313
different names. The brothers and sisters day.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:10.434
Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.440
has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship

00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:18.376
is to be maintained.

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:23.027
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters,

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:24.470
not necessary.

00:07:25.231 --> 00:07:28.380
But you are born, because if you are

00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:31.427
realized souls you are born as brothers and sisters.

00:07:32.028 --> 00:07:35.906
So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:42.303
Very important, that we should try to develop this

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.083
situation that brothers and sisters

00:07:48.407 --> 00:07:53.369
are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure.

00:07:54.007 --> 00:07:58.903
And they should not be at all challenged.

00:07:59.308 --> 00:08:02.832
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.119
he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship,

00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:13.351
the better your left Vishuddhi will be. Because left Vishuddhi

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:17.540
is the relationship with God as a brother

00:08:17.787 --> 00:08:20.344
or with a Goddess as a sister.

00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:26.662
So, Shri Krishna’s sister, as you know was

00:08:26.908 --> 00:08:30.360
born to Nand

00:08:30.604 --> 00:08:34.055
and Shri Krishna himself was born in a prison.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.000
So there was an exchange that took place.

00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:43.838
They had to replace Her in His place.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.798
And then when Kamsa,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:55.882
the uncle of Krishna, tried to kill that girl,

00:08:56.141 --> 00:08:58.141
She went into the sky

00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:03.238
and like a lightning She said that “Your killer is still living in Gokul,

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:07.842
is still there.” So this lightning that we see,

00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.582
is representative of that power,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.820
which we call as Vishnumaya, is the sister’s. If your sisterly feelings

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.560
towards women are good and strong,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.129
your left Vishuddhi will be very good.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.533
It has many other qualities.

00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:31.780
For example a person, who has a very good left Vishuddi,

00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:34.533
is a very confident person.

00:09:36.027 --> 00:09:39.109
Not only that, but whatever he says comes out true.

00:09:42.252 --> 00:09:44.783
Even by mistake, he says something, it comes true.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.798
It’s a very powerful center left Vishuddhi is.

00:09:51.713 --> 00:10:00.376
Such a person, whenever he speaks to, say, criticize something

00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:04.639
or to cut down something or to be against something,

00:10:05.106 --> 00:10:08.188
then it has the power to crash

00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:15.087
all that he doesn’t want. See like, you can say

00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.643
Christ, His left Vishuddhi

00:10:19.907 --> 00:10:23.789
is expressed through His relationship with Mary Magdalene.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.100
When He stood up and said that

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:35.399
“Those who have not committed any sin can stone her,” so this is His power.

00:10:37.164 --> 00:10:42.328
The sin of the people just crashed them completely;

00:10:42.395 --> 00:10:45.884
they were finished, because the sin was there. And the sin was

00:10:46.106 --> 00:10:51.403
of left Vishuddhi. There was no purity. And when there is no purity,

00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:54.442
the person who is so pure says such a thing,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.953
all these people lost their powers; they couldn’t even stone.

00:11:00.767 --> 00:11:06.143
Now this sister of His was born later on as Draupadi

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.147
and that to very near the place we have been to, Vani,

00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:15.069
you know, where we saw. Gavin do you remember when we were going to Nagpur?

00:11:15.232 --> 00:11:23.074
Near Vani she was born, that place and there’s a very big temple of that.

00:11:23.914 --> 00:11:29.058
She was called as Draupadi and you know how Shri Krishna tried to save

00:11:29.136 --> 00:11:31.136
Her chastity.

00:11:32.253 --> 00:11:35.878
Now people,

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:42.317
I have heard, are trying also to say things against Mary Magdalene

00:11:42.695 --> 00:11:46.991
and against Christ and all kinds of things, you see. This is the sign of

00:11:47.008 --> 00:11:51.061
the decadence of our brains and of our morality

00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:54.747
that we cannot see purity in any relationship.

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:59.510
We cannot see any purity in any relationship.

00:12:00.526 --> 00:12:03.419
So we as sahaja yogis have to develop

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:08.057
more of that. Instead of that what I find that people,

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:12.272
specially in the West, try to think whom we are going to marry whom.

00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:16.012
These relationships are established, is wrong.

00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:21.632
There is no need to go on organizing marriages

00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:24.988
and playing these games of romance and all that.

00:12:25.852 --> 00:12:27.994
If marriage has to take place, it will take place.

00:12:28.494 --> 00:12:30.677
But don’t spoil the atmosphere.

00:12:30.767 --> 00:12:33.142
There are some people who are just like

00:12:34.143 --> 00:12:37.507
barbers, who try to organize marriages

00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:41.083
you see and take a great pride in arranging marriages

00:12:41.082 --> 00:12:43.416
with this one to that one and that one to that one.

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:46.533
Is not a desirable thing; one should not do it. There’s no

00:12:49.491 --> 00:12:53.058
virtue in these things, is to organize marriages all the time.

00:12:53.922 --> 00:12:55.922
When the marriage time comes,

00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:56.872
it takes place.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
Now at the time of Mohammed Sahib

00:13:00.692 --> 00:13:06.825
a big question arose, because there were very few man

00:13:06.966 --> 00:13:09.658
many ladies of all age groups.

00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:12.346
And they didn’t know what to do, how to save these girls

00:13:12.618 --> 00:13:15.308
because so many men died in the war.

00:13:16.582 --> 00:13:21.427
So then they asked, “What to do now at this juncture in a position, when such

00:13:22.564 --> 00:13:24.879
a catastrophe is there and so many women are

00:13:24.924 --> 00:13:28.306
there, and very, very few men?” Then He said, “All right, you can marry

00:13:28.533 --> 00:13:32.296
four or five wives and you can marry in any age group.”

00:13:32.386 --> 00:13:34.386
Because if you have to

00:13:34.886 --> 00:13:38.983
live with dharma, means marriage, means collective sanction,

00:13:39.483 --> 00:13:41.483
not without marriage.

00:13:41.664 --> 00:13:43.664
So He said, “All right, you can even marry five times,

00:13:44.119 --> 00:13:46.494
but you must marry, without marriage you cannot live.”

00:13:48.997 --> 00:13:50.997
And that is why He was particular

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:55.463
that every person should be married and should have no relationship

00:13:55.508 --> 00:13:56.895
without marriage, was sin.

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.480
Instead of that now Muslims think that it

00:14:00.525 --> 00:14:01.783
is there right to marry five persons.

00:14:01.828 --> 00:14:04.196
I mean, when the men are more and women are less.

00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:09.973
Is a wrong thing. You have to find out the solution.

00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:14.835
And at that time the relationship between

00:14:15.846 --> 00:14:19.066
even the sisters and brothers had to delimit,

00:14:19.566 --> 00:14:20.914
because there was a big problem.

00:14:21.565 --> 00:14:26.561
So He said, “All right, the children born of the same parents cannot marry,

00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:29.844
but cousins could marry,” that time.

00:14:31.573 --> 00:14:33.951
Now that time is changed, all right,

00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.546
it’s not that time. We are not on war,

00:14:37.046 --> 00:14:40.405
there is nothing happening like that. There is no such problem.

00:14:40.905 --> 00:14:42.905
So let us develop now our

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.837
pure relationship of brothers and sisters.

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:49.685
Actually, first time when we had this

00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:52.633
this Diwali function, I asked people

00:14:53.133 --> 00:14:55.133
to find one sister for yourself.

00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:57.861
Every gentleman must have one sister,

00:14:59.089 --> 00:15:06.560
to find out one. And then that is the day, I said, let us start this way

00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:12.568
that next time when we meet on another day called as

00:15:14.297 --> 00:15:16.297
Rakhi Purnima,

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:20.075
that you tie the rakhi in the hand, the same brothers and sisters.

00:15:21.303 --> 00:15:23.808
In India also we did like that and it worked very well.

00:15:24.308 --> 00:15:28.283
But there the relationships are so strong. Once Dhumal, you see,

00:15:28.783 --> 00:15:31.876
I think tied it to Raulbai.

00:15:32.194 --> 00:15:34.957
And now even if I say something to Raulbai, he doesn’t like.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.845
It exceeded to that extent. It’s so sweet you know.

00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:43.756
And even Dhumal’s wife respects Raulbai as an elder sister, you see.

00:15:43.983 --> 00:15:47.928
It’s very sweet. Like that many relationships are established.

00:15:48.428 --> 00:15:50.096
And next year I think Raulbai

00:15:50.277 --> 00:15:54.531
became the sister of one of our trustees, who was no more there.

00:15:54.894 --> 00:15:57.269
And she always carried on all that

00:15:57.314 --> 00:16:00.510
relationship, and they also, I mean imagine.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:05.423
The whole thing is that, that relationship is so special,

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:07.923
so close and so pure.

00:16:11.154 --> 00:16:13.154
And such a relationship one should develop

00:16:13.882 --> 00:16:16.588
with a lady, any woman

00:16:17.088 --> 00:16:20.277
or any friend you want to have.

00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:23.716
One should remember that it cannot

00:16:23.897 --> 00:16:26.394
cross a certain limit, there has to have a maryada.

00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:28.248
Otherwise they will become brothers and sisters

00:16:28.247 --> 00:16:29.881
and then they marry, it’s not possible.

00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:34.571
So we have to have the boundaries; that is very important.

00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:37.300
In Sahaja Yoga we have to have maryadas

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:41.370
and boundaries. And one of them is this: that once you call somebody

00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:45.256
brother or a sister, is absolutely pure relationship.

00:16:46.529 --> 00:16:48.341
Little further we’ll go with that

00:16:48.613 --> 00:16:52.342
and that the relationship with a, as I have told you before,

00:16:52.842 --> 00:16:59.141
that with your, say, husband’s younger brothers

00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:02.235
is just like that they are like your younger brothers,

00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:04.651
all of them, husband’s younger brothers

00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:07.823
or younger Sahaja yogis than your husbands, are.

00:17:08.607 --> 00:17:10.607
The other way round is for all the ladies,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:23.555
we can say, all the men, their wives, elder ladies, elder to your wives,

00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:26.915
are like sisters, elder sisters.

00:17:27.737 --> 00:17:30.529
I mean this relationship is so sweet and

00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:33.477
gives you a certain amount of understanding

00:17:33.571 --> 00:17:36.149
how much distance is kept with whom,

00:17:36.406 --> 00:17:38.728
with whom to be free and with whom to have the distance.

00:17:39.228 --> 00:17:41.960
And this must be maintained with such a beautiful way

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:45.910
that this purity is not corrupted.

00:17:46.734 --> 00:17:51.070
You keep to pure standards. This is

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.622
the nourishment of Sahaja yoga, is the nourishment

00:17:54.879 --> 00:17:56.879
of your growth, purity.

00:17:57.095 --> 00:17:59.878
Purity is the most important thing for us,

00:18:00.378 --> 00:18:08.314
purity in every way. If you are pure, you will not do anything

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:17.180
that is, we can say, that is not pure.

00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:20.977
So first of all you’ll be pure yourself

00:18:21.477 --> 00:18:24.207
and you’ll accept purity, you’ll appreciate purity,

00:18:24.545 --> 00:18:28.240
you will be sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate

00:18:28.862 --> 00:18:32.549
or try to compromise with you.

00:18:34.144 --> 00:18:38.461
That’s why purity is your Mother’s name.

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.326
You know that My name is purity.

00:18:41.664 --> 00:18:45.798
And this purity is such that it pures everything,

00:18:46.298 --> 00:18:47.773
it just purifies.

00:18:47.949 --> 00:18:50.646
The purity should be such that it should purify,

00:18:52.444 --> 00:18:54.444
otherwise that purity has no meaning.

00:18:55.268 --> 00:18:59.915
For example, a soap purifies, all right. But you don’t purify the soap.

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:04.883
Do you clean the soap? I mean some crazy people might be.

00:19:05.991 --> 00:19:07.991
I know some people, who even wash

00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:10.491
the tap and also the water.

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:16.739
And that’s why, that’s why

00:19:16.792 --> 00:19:21.228
this water, which is the purifier, water is the purifier,

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:23.769
water purifies us physically.

00:19:25.121 --> 00:19:29.401
And also our poisons are driven out of our liver

00:19:29.495 --> 00:19:32.689
also by water. Water is a very great element

00:19:32.743 --> 00:19:34.743
element in removing all problems.

00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:38.074
You use water for so many things; you know how it works it out.

00:19:38.371 --> 00:19:44.962
So this Lakshmi, which is purification, was born out of water.

00:19:45.462 --> 00:19:48.042
That’s why She was called as Mary as I told you.

00:19:48.866 --> 00:19:52.430
And I’m also called as Nira, meaning born out of water.

00:19:57.189 --> 00:20:00.503
So one has to understand that today’s message

00:20:00.638 --> 00:20:05.533
is that we inculcate purity.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:13.051
We should not cheat ourselves. It is easy to cheat, but we should inculcate

00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:16.615
purity within ourselves

00:20:17.331 --> 00:20:26.823
as a matter of our own maturity, as our own decoration, as our own beauty

00:20:27.323 --> 00:20:33.279
and not just because it’s a laborious thing

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.178
or it is a very hard thing, not like that.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:42.211
It should be achieved with great pleasure and happiness.

00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:44.711
How do we like to have a bath

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:48.510
or to be clean and to be presentable?

00:20:48.751 --> 00:20:52.405
In the same way we should try to clean our thoughts.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.008
Just by paying attention to them, we can clean them.

00:20:57.112 --> 00:21:00.877
Thoughts must be made clean. First of all why have thoughts at all.

00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:06.020
But even if you have, have clean and pure thoughts.

00:21:07.469 --> 00:21:12.558
Even if you have to have, don’t have thoughts full of arrogance,

00:21:13.058 --> 00:21:15.058
aggression or of fear.

00:21:15.386 --> 00:21:17.608
Some people think that if you have thoughts of fear

00:21:17.677 --> 00:21:19.677
it’s a very good thing; “Oh I'm frightened,

00:21:19.703 --> 00:21:23.665
I am afraid.” It’s impurity. Why should you be afraid?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.890
That means your left Vishuddhi is catching.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.939
There’s no need to have any fear of any kind;

00:21:32.439 --> 00:21:34.439
no need to have any fear of any kind.

00:21:35.025 --> 00:21:37.732
If you have to have fear

00:21:38.103 --> 00:21:39.762
that means there’s something wrong with you.

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:43.290
If you believe that God is above all,

00:21:43.618 --> 00:21:46.213
you are a realized soul and that

00:21:46.713 --> 00:21:48.713
God is going to look after you,

00:21:49.213 --> 00:21:51.213
that He is your father,

00:21:51.454 --> 00:21:53.454
that He’s open His gates to you,

00:21:53.954 --> 00:21:55.472
what is there to be afraid of?

00:21:55.972 --> 00:21:58.820
Many people think that way that if you have the fears,

00:21:59.579 --> 00:22:02.824
you are humble. Humility is different

00:22:03.065 --> 00:22:05.065
from a frightened person.

00:22:05.436 --> 00:22:07.436
It’s absolutely a egible thing

00:22:07.548 --> 00:22:09.168
it has nothing to do with humility.

00:22:09.668 --> 00:22:12.590
So to be humble is different

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.198
and to be frightened is different. For Sahaja yogis

00:22:18.914 --> 00:22:23.389
it is very easy to find out through their vibratory awareness

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.277
what is fear and what is humility.

00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:33.385
As humility will give you vibrations and fear will catch all your left side.

00:22:39.189 --> 00:22:43.229
So our purification of our mind

00:22:43.427 --> 00:22:45.820
comes through certain methods

00:22:46.104 --> 00:22:48.104
of understanding ourselves.

00:22:48.604 --> 00:22:51.815
First of the understandings one has to have

00:23:01.907 --> 00:23:07.758
is that we are born

00:23:08.258 --> 00:23:11.508
in a family, born in a society, born in a so-called

00:23:12.008 --> 00:23:13.152
religious sect or whatever it is.

00:23:15.144 --> 00:23:22.215
So all these fixations have put into us certain amount of impurities.

00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:26.266
Which may give us ego, superego, anything it might give us.

00:23:27.619 --> 00:23:32.145
So to keep it pure and simple is:

00:23:34.137 --> 00:23:37.066
take to water element as much as you can.

00:23:38.277 --> 00:23:43.341
It helps both ways, it helps ego, it helps superego. Take to water element.

00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:51.387
And that is what Lakshmi is. Lakshmi is the one that gives you

00:23:51.887 --> 00:23:53.887
the Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

00:23:54.387 --> 00:23:58.357
From the Lakshmi only the Mahalakshmi’s principle comes in.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.818
And this is after the purification through the Lakshmi process.

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:05.318
Christ has said, “If you want

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:08.244
I can give you gold, gold parts,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:10.966
you can live with it.

00:24:12.105 --> 00:24:16.456
But those who love Me will only enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:18.956
And I will eat with them,”

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.179
means those who are pure only I will eat with them.

00:24:21.471 --> 00:24:23.679
I will not eat with people, who are impure.

00:24:26.168 --> 00:24:31.308
He was so, I mean, every, all the incarnations are aware of it,

00:24:33.229 --> 00:24:35.068
that they have to be with the pure people

00:24:35.107 --> 00:24:38.678
and they have to help the pure people. But He so clearly said it

00:24:40.277 --> 00:24:42.277
that if you want Lakshmi,

00:24:42.423 --> 00:24:44.708
you can have it, that’s money.

00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:50.778
But that’s not Mahalakshmi, so from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi state.

00:24:52.006 --> 00:24:54.599
You’ve already got your Realization,

00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:56.315
you do not know how much you have got it already

00:24:56.315 --> 00:24:59.368
You are already having the Mahalakshmi principle within you.

00:24:59.368 --> 00:25:02.571
And what is the Mahalakshmi principle? That’s the point.

00:25:02.769 --> 00:25:05.389
Can I ask this question?

00:25:13.522 --> 00:25:16.760
What is the Mahalakshmi principle within you?

00:25:20.433 --> 00:25:22.657
It’s all for the Spirit.

00:25:22.657 --> 00:25:23.157
Hum?

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.737
It’s all for the Spirit, Mother.

00:25:25.973 --> 00:25:27.973
No, no. But you have a power.

00:25:30.422 --> 00:25:34.038
You have got MahaLakshmi’s powers within you, do you know that?

00:25:35.366 --> 00:25:37.297
Mother? The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:37.297 --> 00:25:37.797
hmm?

00:25:37.797 --> 00:25:39.319
The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:39.819
I beg your pardon?

00:25:39.819 --> 00:25:41.247
The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:41.247 --> 00:25:41.760
The pleasure?

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.260
Yes.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.196
No, no, no.

00:25:43.196 --> 00:25:45.196
The power of giving Realization.

00:25:46.568 --> 00:25:49.039
Go ahead still, a little more, move.

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:54.447
Pleasure is not a power.

00:25:54.447 --> 00:25:58.560
Pleasure is what you enjoy. But it's, you have a power of Mahalakshmi.

00:26:00.551 --> 00:26:01.879
Sustaining power?

00:26:01.879 --> 00:26:02.402
What's it?

00:26:02.402 --> 00:26:05.096
Sustaining power.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:12.837
That’s no power. Power means, you have that power to do something.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.659
Potential?

00:26:17.659 --> 00:26:18.860
The power to spread Sahaja yoga.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:19.440
Hum?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.440
The power to spread Sahaja yoga, Mother.

00:26:21.857 --> 00:26:25.121
That’s rather vague: particular one.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.420
Power to give Realization.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.934
To give Realization, other.

00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:32.660
To evolve Mother.

00:26:34.222 --> 00:26:35.604
To evolve.

00:26:37.591 --> 00:26:39.591
But to evolve is your own.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.927
Power is what you do to others.

00:26:45.707 --> 00:26:49.383
The whole thing, I told you just now, is to purify.

00:26:52.323 --> 00:26:58.913
You have the power to purify. How do you cure people?

00:26:59.773 --> 00:27:05.908
By purifying them. All right?

00:27:08.759 --> 00:27:13.693
Now just think how you purify others, by talking to others

00:27:13.826 --> 00:27:15.826
you can purify them.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:24.088
By touching others, you can purify them. By looking at them,

00:27:24.404 --> 00:27:25.777
you can purify them.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.585
One person who is a Realized soul,

00:27:29.585 --> 00:27:33.405
purifies the whole atmosphere. The atmosphere is purified.

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:36.131
Since I’ve come, it has been warm enough.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:45.104
You purify everything. You purify this light, do you notice that?

00:27:46.943 --> 00:27:48.943
You awaken the light.

00:27:53.922 --> 00:27:57.042
Now what other powers you have?

00:28:03.706 --> 00:28:04.816
To raise the Kundalini.

00:28:04.836 --> 00:28:05.390
Hum?

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.351
Raise Kundalini.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.760
That’s awakening.

00:28:08.917 --> 00:28:12.323
You see, Kundalini is many powers, is many-folded.

00:28:14.608 --> 00:28:16.492
You purify yourselves,

00:28:17.727 --> 00:28:19.727
others and yourselves.

00:28:19.727 --> 00:28:23.643
Some more powers are there. Now come along, let’s have it.

00:28:25.074 --> 00:28:27.424
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them,

00:28:27.424 --> 00:28:29.366
this is the best part of it!

00:28:31.605 --> 00:28:34.681
Can’t follow it now. Now let’s have it.

00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:37.175
The power to arrange time to suit you, Mother.

00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:38.128
What's this?

00:28:39.477 --> 00:28:41.477
Power over time.

00:28:41.684 --> 00:28:44.184
Arranging time to suit yourself.

00:28:44.877 --> 00:28:47.834
But that’s not the power of Mahalakshmi.

00:28:47.834 --> 00:28:51.005
That’s another one, I’ll tell you, who does that.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.128
Balance.

00:29:02.223 --> 00:29:03.534
What do you say?

00:29:03.534 --> 00:29:07.458
It gives a balance between ego and superego.

00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:11.169
That’s true. That is one of them. But that is guru power.

00:29:11.169 --> 00:29:12.899
That is the guru’s power.

00:29:13.175 --> 00:29:14.936
Balance comes from guru.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.201
You see, Mahalakshmi is water. So, now you tell Me.

00:29:22.724 --> 00:29:23.510
To cleanse.

00:29:23.949 --> 00:29:27.600
That’s all done now, one cleansing is done. What else water does?

00:29:29.108 --> 00:29:30.571
It quenches the thirst.

00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:31.071
Ha?

00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:32.009
Quenches.

00:29:32.751 --> 00:29:33.834
Satisfy.

00:29:33.834 --> 00:29:34.762
Satisfaction.

00:29:34.762 --> 00:29:37.271
Now coming to the heart.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.166
It quenches the thirst, the spiritual thirst.

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:46.664
You can quench the spiritual thirst of people, tremendous power it is,

00:29:46.664 --> 00:29:48.664
because even you doing Realization,

00:29:48.664 --> 00:29:53.018
done! The seeking is over. All right?

00:29:53.804 --> 00:29:57.049
Then another one. Now come along.

00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:58.708
What other power?

00:30:01.589 --> 00:30:03.236
Think of the water.

00:30:07.641 --> 00:30:12.457
Nourishment, you nourish.

00:30:13.113 --> 00:30:16.834
You give spiritual nourishment to people through your power;

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.583
even if you are standing there you are nourishing others.

00:30:23.815 --> 00:30:26.508
Then it's a solvent.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.126
You dissolve their ego, you dissolve their superego.

00:30:31.369 --> 00:30:34.715
All these powers you own now, after Realization.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.760
Just think of it. What else?

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.843
Divinity.

00:30:46.313 --> 00:30:48.313
That’s very vague,

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:53.274
because divinity is how to relate it with water, people won’t understand.

00:30:53.274 --> 00:30:55.758
So, let us put it the other way round.

00:30:55.758 --> 00:30:58.178
What is it?

00:30:58.178 --> 00:30:59.628
To cool down emotions.

00:30:59.628 --> 00:31:00.360
What?

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.856
To cool down emotions and conscience.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.521
You become a cool down person.

00:31:08.327 --> 00:31:09.698
Very good!

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:18.701
Very good. You become cool,

00:31:20.092 --> 00:31:22.619
a cool personality. You have a cooling effect, very good.

00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:23.736
What else?

00:31:23.736 --> 00:31:24.992
You can carry others.

00:31:24.992 --> 00:31:25.492
Hum?

00:31:25.492 --> 00:31:27.492
You can carry others.

00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:30.724
With you, you can, very gently

00:31:30.928 --> 00:31:32.554
and also drown some of them.

00:31:38.226 --> 00:31:42.326
Drown into the love, into the ocean of love.

00:31:42.326 --> 00:31:43.310
All right?

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:48.253
But you can also push them with two running jumps, all right?

00:31:49.088 --> 00:31:52.252
That also can be done.

00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:57.635
It has another very great quality that water permeates

00:31:58.399 --> 00:32:02.814
into the smallest particle. It goes to the roots and it suck through the roots.

00:32:04.936 --> 00:32:08.388
So, Mahalakshmi power, you just see the roots of a person.

00:32:08.528 --> 00:32:10.329
You just know where the problem comes from,

00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:12.197
you jump to it.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.542
Actually, it is the awareness, it is the intelligence which

00:32:16.542 --> 00:32:21.276
sucks the truth part of it, which gets enlightened.

00:32:21.511 --> 00:32:28.155
And you understand that now where is the problem, and you just go near the root

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:33.168
when you suck through it, you can be easily sucked through, you permeate.

00:32:33.392 --> 00:32:35.881
You see, when you are sitting near a person

00:32:36.526 --> 00:32:40.837
and you tell Me, “Mother, this is catching at the back,

00:32:41.142 --> 00:32:42.495
the person doesn’t know.”

00:32:42.495 --> 00:32:44.495
You have permeated. Your personality has

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:46.495
permeated into that person. He doesn’t know.

00:32:47.422 --> 00:32:50.581
You have permeated into that person and you are feeling the roots, you see

00:32:51.081 --> 00:32:53.081
where is the problem.

00:32:53.081 --> 00:32:54.327
The water is flowing into that being.

00:32:54.327 --> 00:32:57.385
The divine water is flowing into that being

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:59.459
and you, the obstruction is felt

00:32:59.459 --> 00:33:01.907
through that divine water.

00:33:02.655 --> 00:33:05.414
And you can say that, "This is catching, that is catching."

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.740
So, the permeating.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.456
And the another one is the glistening of the water.

00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:19.473
So, your skin starts glistening, your skin becomes very radiant.

00:33:22.103 --> 00:33:25.177
And the last of all is the reflection.

00:33:26.457 --> 00:33:28.457
A person, who sees you,

00:33:29.576 --> 00:33:32.950
sees his own reflection. He gets frightened.

00:33:34.945 --> 00:33:36.945
With Me, it this happens sometimes.

00:33:37.404 --> 00:33:39.512
And I don’t mean anything bad to anyone,

00:33:40.072 --> 00:33:43.639
but people are unnecessarily frightened of Me

00:33:43.639 --> 00:33:44.966
because they see their reflection.

00:33:46.115 --> 00:33:48.930
So, when they meet you, they see their reflection can be very aggressive,

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.815
because they see their reflection. They can be very hard on you

00:33:52.815 --> 00:33:54.815
because they see their reflection.

00:34:00.814 --> 00:34:07.213
And if it is clear-cut water, then you see the depth of the person.

00:34:09.324 --> 00:34:11.324
If you are clear-cut Sahaja Yogi

00:34:11.661 --> 00:34:19.202
they feel the depth, clean, and they can see through  the Spirit shining.

00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:27.146
These are the qualities of water within us.

00:34:29.379 --> 00:34:33.611
The more of that, I would say, especially in my body,

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:36.939
the water, I actually buffer

00:34:37.296 --> 00:34:39.296
to protect the chakras.

00:34:39.296 --> 00:34:41.296
If I don’t have water in the body,

00:34:41.296 --> 00:34:43.765
then I may have problems.

00:34:43.765 --> 00:34:45.765
So, it acts as a buffer.

00:34:46.675 --> 00:34:52.037
Also, it soothes your epidermal cells, you can say.

00:34:52.037 --> 00:34:55.794
it soothes your linings, you see?

00:34:55.794 --> 00:34:59.568
If there is no moisture, it will all give dryness and all that.

00:35:00.335 --> 00:35:02.335
It soothes everyone.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:13.121
And there are other types of powers of water, which we know of that when

00:35:13.121 --> 00:35:14.795
it comes out of your eyes

00:35:15.961 --> 00:35:18.409
it expresses your compassion,

00:35:19.955 --> 00:35:21.955
your love, your emotions.

00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:25.021
That is the only thing,

00:35:26.283 --> 00:35:29.780
out of all the elements, which expresses emotions,

00:35:33.341 --> 00:35:35.954
water power, I mean.

00:35:37.841 --> 00:35:43.414
Water has other qualities also which physics people know as hydrostatics,

00:35:43.414 --> 00:35:44.451
it has the pressure.

00:35:45.139 --> 00:35:46.689
It has a pressure

00:35:47.814 --> 00:35:49.814
and a person who exists

00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:51.585
like a Sahaja Yogi,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.812
will definitely put a pressure on others. He will not,

00:35:55.944 --> 00:35:59.643
he will not aggress but there will be a pressure and pressure.

00:35:59.867 --> 00:36:05.920
And another person, if he receives it, then he gets the advantage of it.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.097
But if he does not receive it,

00:36:08.097 --> 00:36:12.516
then he feel pressurized and he feels a little bit dominated.

00:36:13.892 --> 00:36:16.055
Your neigbhors, your family people,

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.668
at the beginning will feel, "Oh, there's a pressure"

00:36:18.787 --> 00:36:22.687
because the body achieves a kind of a weight.

00:36:24.339 --> 00:36:27.583
And that’s how the Guru tattva is formed out of water.

00:36:29.813 --> 00:36:31.813
And if there is salt,

00:36:32.921 --> 00:36:36.124
that's Guru principle, then the weight is even more.

00:36:38.607 --> 00:36:43.843
So, today for water, you should really know that

00:36:44.511 --> 00:36:47.802
water is a very holy thing.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.024
And in our pujas also, we use -

00:36:51.538 --> 00:36:56.015
especially this thing signifies the Kundalini,

00:36:56.015 --> 00:37:00.570
that means the Kundalini is the water jar,

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.736
or the carrier of Aquarius.

00:37:04.042 --> 00:37:06.797
And this is the Age of the Aquarius.

00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:10.180
So, how important is water!

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:19.132
And the water is the carrier of divine love, is the best carrier.

00:37:19.132 --> 00:37:27.019
And this is the time of Aquarius means the Kundalini is made of divine water.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:34.365
So, the whole idea of celebrating,

00:37:34.895 --> 00:37:41.641
today is the Lakshmi’s day, is to understand that in us

00:37:41.641 --> 00:37:44.398
She has become a Mahalakshmi.

00:37:44.398 --> 00:37:50.447
And by that, we have so many powers of which we are not aware,
I mean we do not know also that we are Realized souls,

00:37:50.447 --> 00:37:51.760
some of us do not know,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.522
and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others.

00:37:55.522 --> 00:37:58.225
We can project our personalities onto others.

00:37:58.225 --> 00:38:00.857
We can find out what’s wrong with them.

00:38:02.005 --> 00:38:07.181
We can find out about ourselves. We can go into ourselves,
we can go into - our permeation  is like water

00:38:07.181 --> 00:38:11.585
it's going, it's flowing all the time. And this

00:38:12.803 --> 00:38:16.316
is a very important thing that we should be aware

00:38:16.316 --> 00:38:18.024
of our powers that we have achieved.

00:38:18.024 --> 00:38:21.698
Then we start respecting ourselves then the Rajalakshmi comes in

00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:23.657
and then the Gruhalakshmi comes in

00:38:23.954 --> 00:38:27.600
and everything comes with it when we become aware

00:38:27.978 --> 00:38:33.115
of what we have achieved of our self-esteem,

00:38:34.746 --> 00:38:36.746
of our dignity.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:41.344
So, this gives us dignity, Mahalakshmi gives us dignity.

00:38:41.956 --> 00:38:45.543
And that’s how we start understanding the value of human dignity.

00:38:46.987 --> 00:38:50.730
We should have also the idea of human dignity

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.992
that we cannot insult human dignity,

00:38:58.356 --> 00:39:01.814
like people who are nagging others all the time. It’s against

00:39:03.179 --> 00:39:05.392
or all the time asserting themselves about

00:39:05.373 --> 00:39:08.020
something making everybody’s life miserable.

00:39:08.232 --> 00:39:12.228
It’s against human dignity. You have to decorate another's life,

00:39:12.382 --> 00:39:17.489
you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable

00:39:17.701 --> 00:39:21.546
and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time.

00:39:22.046 --> 00:39:24.221
And if you nag that’s not a Gruhalakshmi;

00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:27.236
that is not a Gruhalakshmi. You should not nag, “Do this, do that,

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.341
stand up, what are you doing, stand this side, do, go that side.”

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.004
It’s all a nonsense. You /?/ the person to do it;

00:39:33.389 --> 00:39:35.227
the human dignity is the most important thing.

00:39:35.727 --> 00:39:37.727
Must respect the human dignity.

00:39:38.227 --> 00:39:41.125
And that’s possible because now you have got the Mahalakshmi power.

00:39:41.625 --> 00:39:44.748
Those who do not have the dignity also will get it from you

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.544
because you are dignified now.

00:39:47.678 --> 00:39:50.268
If you have sense of dignity, you will never insult other’s dignity.

00:39:50.768 --> 00:39:52.768
For small, small things we insult others

00:39:52.807 --> 00:39:56.222
“Why did you put the soap here, why did you do this, why did you do that?”

00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.392
And the another side coud be that others

00:39:59.546 --> 00:40:02.907
have no dignity so they go on doing things just like animals.

00:40:03.407 --> 00:40:05.407
The both things are wrong.

00:40:06.253 --> 00:40:11.494
But one must respect and respect brings the best results I have seen.

00:40:11.994 --> 00:40:15.442
That’s the best result, once you respect and love

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:19.730
and then the trust is grown

00:40:19.769 --> 00:40:21.411
and one should keep the trust.

00:40:21.565 --> 00:40:24.553
And that’s how the human dignity /?/

00:40:25.053 --> 00:40:27.053
We must respect every Sahaja yogi

00:40:27.899 --> 00:40:31.614
because we are all saints, to respect each other,

00:40:32.114 --> 00:40:34.114
absolutely respect because you are all saints.

00:40:34.268 --> 00:40:36.268
I don’t know you realize what I am saying.

00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:41.955
Each one of you is capable of giving realization to the whole world,

00:40:42.455 --> 00:40:43.541
each one of you

00:40:46.521 --> 00:40:50.617
and if we realize then we must respect ourselves and respect others.

00:40:51.117 --> 00:40:53.829
You should do not talk frivolously about others, make fun.

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:57.309
And specially your Mother,

00:40:57.636 --> 00:40:59.636
you can’t take liberties with Her.

00:41:00.886 --> 00:41:02.886
That is something one has to know

00:41:03.386 --> 00:41:07.544
in the west is important. This is very important

00:41:08.217 --> 00:41:10.217
that one has to know about it.

00:41:11.467 --> 00:41:13.467
The other day I was correcting somebody.

00:41:13.967 --> 00:41:15.967
So Hugh said that “You are a very lucky person

00:41:16.063 --> 00:41:17.926
that Mother is correcting you; you are very lucky

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.080
that She is correcting you, telling you something,

00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:24.807
because you are naive you see, that is why you start taking liberties.”

00:41:25.538 --> 00:41:29.158
First of all you must respect the divinity of your Mother.

00:41:29.427 --> 00:41:33.839
That’s very important. And that gives you the greatest dignity.

00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:40.189
I am telling you this because unless and until you do that, your growth

00:41:40.689 --> 00:41:42.689
cannot come up well.

00:41:42.728 --> 00:41:44.728
So that is a very important point

00:41:45.228 --> 00:41:49.556
and like in India supposing somebody is going to a temple

00:41:49.652 --> 00:41:52.423
or they come to - for example, today

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.235
She has come or somebody has come they will better,

00:41:55.331 --> 00:41:56.689
they will wear a nice dress.

00:41:57.477 --> 00:42:00.324
You see, you are going to a temple and all the ornaments they will wear,

00:42:00.478 --> 00:42:01.895
everything they will wear.

00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:04.402
That is the day they have to present all their dignity.

00:42:04.902 --> 00:42:07.076
So one should not come with

00:42:07.288 --> 00:42:10.312
dishevel hair or things like that.

00:42:12.254 --> 00:42:15.968
That is not a good thing because all these things are important,

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.180
how you respect.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.165
How you have to be dressed

00:42:23.434 --> 00:42:25.662
how you have to presentable, because these things

00:42:25.758 --> 00:42:28.001
Some people say that oh /?/

00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:30.501
we don’t need to be tidy because we are the spirit

00:42:31.001 --> 00:42:33.001
Spirit is the most tidy thing.

00:42:33.213 --> 00:42:35.574
It tidies everything you see.

00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:38.729
It tidies everything. It goes into proper synthesis, proper

00:42:38.998 --> 00:42:40.644
concord, a complete,

00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:43.558
beautiful music is created out of that.

00:42:44.058 --> 00:42:47.558
How can a chaotic person be called spiritual man? Cannot,

00:42:47.597 --> 00:42:50.492
anybody who is chaotic, their house is chaotic, their things are chaotic,

00:42:50.588 --> 00:42:52.891
you must know there is something bhootish in them,

00:42:52.915 --> 00:42:54.915
absolutely.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.280
But you should not be other way round, that

00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:01.019
so meticulous that you eat others’ heads.

00:43:01.532 --> 00:43:04.700
That’s another side. So both things should not be done.

00:43:05.025 --> 00:43:08.205
And I go on insisting on this point because it is very important

00:43:08.705 --> 00:43:10.222
for ego-oriented people

00:43:10.722 --> 00:43:12.722
because they can become anything.

00:43:13.395 --> 00:43:16.446
The other day I was going on King’s Road and I was surprised

00:43:17.004 --> 00:43:19.004
what sort of dresses people are wearing

00:43:19.043 --> 00:43:21.163
and they think that “whatever we wear, we are.”

00:43:21.259 --> 00:43:22.955
That means you must be monkeys,

00:43:23.455 --> 00:43:25.455
you wear such dresses and go about it.

00:43:25.955 --> 00:43:28.423
If you believe in that then you should be decent people,

00:43:28.635 --> 00:43:29.985
there should be decorum about it.

00:43:35.617 --> 00:43:42.297
So today we have learnt about Lakshmi's growth into Mahalakshmi

00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:46.393
but it is not that when you grow into something the rest of it is finished,

00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:50.279
is not so, that some people think that they become

00:43:50.316 --> 00:43:54.023
spiritual personality now Lakshmi Tattwa is not there, is not true.

00:43:54.869 --> 00:43:56.869
You have to be decent person,

00:43:57.369 --> 00:44:02.026
properly dressed according to your status in life, the way you live.

00:44:02.526 --> 00:44:06.877
And there should be no, what you call, hypocrisy about it,

00:44:07.377 --> 00:44:10.526
no hypocrisy. By doing any

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.680
nonsensical thing,

00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:15.547
like some people think becoming a primitive or anything,

00:44:15.759 --> 00:44:17.935
you will impress others. You will never impress,

00:44:18.147 --> 00:44:20.147
you see. It’s beggar’s thing,

00:44:20.416 --> 00:44:24.176
see, doing beggary you will get some beggars bhoot into you.

00:44:25.253 --> 00:44:28.071
So we are not to be beggars, neither we have to be

00:44:28.571 --> 00:44:32.115
a sort of dandies, but we are Sahaja yogis, dignified people.

00:44:32.615 --> 00:44:36.353
We have our own self-esteem and we live with our own dignity,

00:44:36.622 --> 00:44:40.865
and that’s how we should be pure

00:44:41.884 --> 00:44:43.884
transparent, honest,

00:44:44.961 --> 00:44:46.576
within ourselves we should be honest,

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.769
absolutely honest. Water is so honest with itself.

00:44:50.557 --> 00:44:52.557
We put anything to the water it will show.

00:44:53.807 --> 00:44:55.807
Put any color into it, it will show.

00:44:56.307 --> 00:44:58.307
Put any mud it will show.

00:44:58.403 --> 00:45:01.113
You have to be so honest, honest to yourself.

00:45:02.132 --> 00:45:05.213
And the whole thing should work out to be a personality

00:45:05.713 --> 00:45:10.467
and be congenial, beautiful, permeating, no doubt

00:45:10.794 --> 00:45:12.674
but very beautifully enlightened

00:45:13.174 --> 00:45:15.174
because Mahalakshmi Tattwa itself

00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:17.213
is enlightenment in our awareness.

00:45:17.713 --> 00:45:20.178
Such a person cannot be an idiot. If there is an idiot

00:45:20.274 --> 00:45:22.274
he is not a Sahaja yogi, definitely he is not.

00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:26.217
Idiotic person cannot be a Sahaja yogi - nitwits,

00:45:28.389 --> 00:45:31.860
absent-minded, all that has to go away.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.360
If you all have to be sahaja yogis, you cannot be,

00:45:34.687 --> 00:45:37.800
“Oh, I know, I know, I know.” All that nonsense is not be there,

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.183
should not be there.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:48.306
The lakshanas or what do you call, the seed tops, or you can say,

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.140
what do you call lakshanas,

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.271
is the way you can make out a Sahaja yogi, should be

00:45:57.771 --> 00:46:02.483
a Lakshmi putra is the sign of Lakshmi like a king /?/

00:46:03.502 --> 00:46:06.302
That doesn’t mean that he has everything to him self, no.

00:46:07.033 --> 00:46:09.033
That doesn’t mean that, king gives.

00:46:09.245 --> 00:46:11.439
He gives with generosity, known by his generosity.

00:46:11.708 --> 00:46:14.551
He is not known by how much he grabs, does he?

00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:18.285
He is a king, as it is, is giving.

00:46:21.209 --> 00:46:23.439
Then he should be cool personality.

00:46:25.323 --> 00:46:28.211
He should not be frozen. He should be cool personality,

00:46:29.345 --> 00:46:32.197
not hot- tempered. Those who are hot-tempered,

00:46:32.697 --> 00:46:35.430
I have seen people, you see, here

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.276
they first take to violence. I mean violence is

00:46:38.315 --> 00:46:40.491
something out of question for Sahaja yogis,

00:46:41.737 --> 00:46:45.706
no question. If somebody beat you also you are not to beat him back.

00:46:46.437 --> 00:46:48.437
We have ways to beat them

00:46:49.802 --> 00:46:51.802
but you are not to beat them back.

00:46:52.821 --> 00:46:54.821
You are not to resist them,

00:46:55.033 --> 00:46:58.985
but if you are a sahaja yogi you have no business to be violent to anyone,

00:46:59.485 --> 00:47:01.968
even with your tongue. Some people are

00:47:02.064 --> 00:47:04.064
more with the tongue provocating type.

00:47:04.564 --> 00:47:07.476
You must know that you must correct all these points.

00:47:07.976 --> 00:47:11.958
It is important because tomorrow if you are going to show to the world

00:47:12.458 --> 00:47:14.458
what Sahaja Yoga is not /?/

00:47:19.745 --> 00:47:21.745
So we have to dedicate ourselves

00:47:21.957 --> 00:47:23.490
to our purification,

00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:26.522
to our glorification because water glorifies,

00:47:27.022 --> 00:47:29.022
gives you glory.

00:47:29.118 --> 00:47:32.441
You are all looking so nice and glistening on the face and I can see

00:47:32.479 --> 00:47:34.361
the Ganti Rupena Samasthita.

00:47:34.515 --> 00:47:38.856
He said that “Ya Devi Sarva Butheshu Ganti Rupena,” the glistening,

00:47:38.895 --> 00:47:43.609
the light and that’s there I can see you in you all.

00:47:43.821 --> 00:47:49.188
It has already come but it should be inside also.

00:47:50.553 --> 00:47:53.596
And that person who is a realized soul

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.151
one doesn’t have to vow for it.

00:47:56.939 --> 00:47:58.939
people just know that he is realized soul.

00:47:59.958 --> 00:48:03.940
You don’t have to tell anyone people just know the way he is.

00:48:06.574 --> 00:48:08.574
So many points we have covered today.

00:48:08.901 --> 00:48:10.901
I hope you will

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:12.414
again listen to them because,

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.904
see, Mataji’s lecture goes from one ear and comes out from the other.

00:48:16.807 --> 00:48:20.657
Thank God we have a way of localizing it.

00:48:20.926 --> 00:48:22.926
I hope you people will take these tapes

00:48:23.022 --> 00:48:26.288
and listen to them everyday one by one

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.576
and also act, not planning

00:48:29.788 --> 00:48:33.782
in the paper or in the ear. But it should go in the heart.

00:48:36.185 --> 00:48:38.185
That’s how we are all going to mature

00:48:38.397 --> 00:48:41.713
beautiful children. I’m just counting

00:48:42.213 --> 00:48:48.066
now again C.P. will be elected for four years and then I have to

00:48:48.566 --> 00:48:53.911
there is hardly three years it will pass away and

00:48:54.988 --> 00:48:57.289
I won’t be able to go so much in U.K.

00:48:57.789 --> 00:49:00.426
The responsibility, such a lot on you people.

00:49:02.887 --> 00:49:05.554
I hope we celebrate some more Diwalis together.

00:49:06.382 --> 00:49:08.382
May God bless you!
