00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.780
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:17.120
I was very happy to learn that in Fremantle there are many seekers of truth.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.980
Maybe, the blessings of the sea and the expanse

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:32.540
gives rise to the curiosities to know what is beyond and the time has come today, I think

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.660
that we're trying to find out

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.100
what is beyond this human awareness, what is beyond human endeavor.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.860
Is it all a fruitless life? So many questions are peeping in.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.960
That's why I call it a blossom time.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.000
Because there were never so many seekers in the world before as they're today.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.940
Of course in ignorance they might be mislaid into wrong paths and they might be

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.020
completely disillusioned as well. But whatever maybe, truth exists, it is there

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.740
and to find it out should be the easiest thing for us,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.980
it should not be difficult because it is so vital and so important.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.600
Whatever is vital has to be, has to be very simple and so we call it sahaja.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.920
Sahaja also means spontaneous - it means born with you. Is the spontaneous happening

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.960
of this living process within you, of sprouting

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.260
the Kundalini, just like a seed sprouts when you put it in the Mother Earth.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.060
You can't pay for it first of all, no you can't. You can't have a course in it -

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.900
it's not mental, it's something that is inside.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:14.000
Anything that says that by paying you can purchase God or gurus, then know that they're not

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.660
anywhere near Divinity, they have nothing to do with God.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.100
Because God doesn't understand money at all, He can only understand love and genuineness within you.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.860
So now, we come to this subtle system that exists within us -

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.160
I hope, you are listening to Me, can you hear Me?

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.600
This subtle system that exists within us has been known

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.240
to many people, since long, but was kept a secret.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.640
I would say, there were very few flowers on the tree of life at that time and, as I said, this is the blossom time

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.660
and many people have to have their realization. So, this is the breakthrough into the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.280
evolutionary process, as you are a human-being.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.860
You have to just have a little more jump to get to that point where you become the spirit.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.380
It is your own, all this system belongs to you - is within you. Only thing,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.160
that a one enlightened candle can enlighten another candle, that's how it works out.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.300
But there's no obligation, it just a.. , you can say, a triggering

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.380
or like a catalyst it works. Now, in this system yesterday I was telling you about is, there are three

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.900
type of channels you can see clearly - have you talked about that to them? No.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.720
Now, these channels are, the first one is, is the left-side channel, which uh, which is called

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.300
which supplies to the left-side sympathetic nervous system but in Sanskrit language it is called as the Ida Nadi.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.760
Also it is called as the Moon channel - is the left-side, which caters to your

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.240
Sub-conscious mind and to your Collective Sub-conscious.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.920
On the right hand side there's another area which, we can call it as the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.860
one which nourishes the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.700
This one is for your future. So,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.800
we can say that, the left one is the one, which emits the power of desire

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.180
and the right one emits the power of action through your physical and mental being.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.480
So, we have these two Sympathetic Nervous Systems within us. In the center is the Parasympathetic Nervous System

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.340
which in Sanskrit called as the Sushumna Nadi. So, the left is the Ida Nadi

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:27.640
which is the Moon channel, left, right is the Pingala Nadi which is the Sun's

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:35.380
channel and the central one is the Sushumna Nadi through which we have now

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.680
come to this stage of human awareness. From Amoeba to this stage we have arrived

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.980
through this system of Parasympathetic activity. And whatever we have achieved through our evolution,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.140
we can feel it on our Central Nervous System. For example, if you have some dog or a

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.620
animal, any, say a, a, a horse, it can pass through any dirty lane -

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:10.660
it doesn't see the beauty of a building, it just goes through. But it's only, a human-being can feel

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.480
the filth and the dirt and also the beauty. So, in our awareness we have achieved a lot

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.440
but still, there's something more we have to achieve and that achievement is, the Absolute Truth.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.500
So far, whatever truth we have, is all relative.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:37.220
We're finding this is nice, somebody says this is very nice, somebody says that's very nice - somebody says Communism is good somebody says Capitalism is good -

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.380
somebody says this religion is good, somebody says that religion is good - it's all relative terminology,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.120
there's nothing Absolute about it. So, whatever is Absolute, we have to know on our Central Nervous System.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.620
That's what is called as bodha in the Buddha religion and as uh..

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:05.780
as vid in the Vedas, also what the early Christians called themselves as Gnostic.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:13.180
'Gna' the word 'Gna' comes from the word 'Gnya', 'Gnya'. Some people call it Gyana, some people call it Gyan.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:20.700
So the 'Gyna', from the 'Gyna' means the one who has known on the Central Nervous System, not mentally,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.740
not reading something. It is something that you have to know on your Central Nervous System. And what do you have to know,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.200
is the All-Pervading power, which is described

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.780
by all the saints, prophets and all the Incarnations. You have to feel that

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:48.140
subtle power which works out all that is living.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.200
We cannot explain how it works out. A little seed sprouts, becomes a big tree

00:07:53.420 --> 00:08:00.800
and the tree bears all so many seeds which has so many trees. So the one little seed has all the maps of all the

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:08.700
progeny it is going to produce - it's a tremendous thing. And this Infinity, all that is built-in, in one little seed

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.840
is like a, something, is beyond our imagination, beyond our understanding.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.720
In the same way, within us lies this very subtle uh... system,

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.020
which works out the last ascent.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:31.520
There's the power as he must have told you - is the triangular bone called as sacrum - called as Kundalini.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.960
The other day, somebody asked Me the question, that people say the Kundalini awakening is a very dangerous thing.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.120
It's not at all because Kundalini is your pure desire.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:49.860
So now, we have three powers, as I told you. The first power we have is the power of desire

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.260
ordinary desire. Now, desire

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:02.780
is never fulfilled in general - is a principle of Economics, as you know, that in general is never satiable.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.840
Supposing, today uh.. we want to buy a car all right, you have a car, then we want to have a house, then we want to have this we want to have that.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.760
Whatever we have, we cannot enjoy. The desire goes jumping from one to another.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.780
That's power of desire and the second one is the power of action by which

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.160
we put in physical effort and mental effort - we think we'll have this, we'll work it out, we plan it

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.900
and sometimes, that also leads us nowhere and we really get absolutely

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.880
flabbergasted the way we have missed the point.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:45.020
So, all these two powers work separately

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.340
but human-beings have a capacity to go to extremes, to left or to the right.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.920
If they go too much to the right they cause a problem to their centers

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:04.880
which, I would say, are like this in the center. Now, the left and the right and in the center you see this,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.260
is, you can say, is the spinal cord. Now, in this lies the center, the subtle center.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.900
Now, if you use too much of this or use too much of this, it breaks.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:23.280
When it breaks, you lose the control or you can say that the connection with the whole is lost

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.880
and you become on your own. That's how, diseases like cancer set in.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.580
Cancer is simple thing, that you go to extremes on the right side

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:40.080
or to the left side and is, when it is triggered also by the right or the left side, it just separate like that

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.920
and then the cells start growing on their own, which is called as malignancy.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:50.780
Now somehow, if you can bring them back to their original position, cancer can be cured.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:57.500
There are so many things like that, which can be corrected very easily, only

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.680
if you know the fundamentals, the roots on which we stand.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:08.680
Our civilization has grown outside like a very, very big tree but we haven't found out our roots that's why

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.680
they're writing these days that we are verge, on the verge of shock - this is going to happen, that is going to happen.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:21.340
We have to find out our roots. Now, when we depend so much on Science and the advancement

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:28.440
we have to understand that it has certain defects in it. For example, science doesn't have any humanity,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:35.460
science doesn't have any consideration of love and affection, it has no art in it.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:42.880
It has no consideration for other human-beings - science is blind. And if you go after science to that extent

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:49.880
that the whole nation becomes blind then is possibility that you might just create something like

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:56.000
atom bomb, hydrogen bomb - devil sitting on our heads, you see, telling us what we have created.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.840
So, to get the balance, we have to see to the roots of this tree

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.640
and the roots are within ourselves, which we have to find out. These roots are,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:14.060
as he has told you, these three systems that work within us - one which is the desire power, another

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.480
which is the thinking power you can call it or a mental

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.860
uh.. understanding that we have about things or mental action and the physical action.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.280
The central one is the ascending.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:39.280
As Christ has said, that Holy Ghost will have three capacities. One is She Comforter -

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:47.160
then Comforter is the left side, then Counselor is the right side and the central path

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.080
is the ascending part, is the Redeemer, by which you're redeemed.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:59.100
Now, when one system starts working, say the right system, which works very much in the modern times with people -

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:06.200
we're planning, planning, planning like mad and all the time thinking, thinking, thinking to create something

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.760
new, to create something great. In that uh.., in that endeavor

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:19.260
to create something new and to create something great, what do we do, is to use our right side too much.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:27.880
Now, if you see, the right side is connected to a yellow uh.. colored center, a chakra, sukshma chakra.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:36.160
Now, this yellow center is the one, that represents the energy for all the organs of the stomach.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:45.060
It helps to work out your liver, your pancreas, uh.. your

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:53.040
spleen, kidneys and part of your intestines. But it has some very important work to do

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.720
and that important work is to convert your fat for

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:06.440
the replacement of the grey cells in your brain. That fat is converted to make it into grey cells.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:14.160
Now, when you use too much of your brain - all the time you start using it too much - then what happens, there, there's an imbalance.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.620
and you start neglecting the viscera, the, the, we should say, the organs of your stomach.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:26.440
At that time, all these things like your liver, your pancreas, your spleen,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:34.440
your kidneys, all of them go out of order. I'm just giving you an example of one, of one, one side working too hard.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:43.060
So, such people might get liver troubles. The liver is responsible for absorbing the heat in the body.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.500
It absorbs all the heat that you have and then it uh..

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.780
releases into the water which is in the blood.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.640
But when the liver goes out of order, the heat remains as it is. Then it starts spreading upward.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:07.580
When it goes upward it can cause you Asthma and all such diseases which are due to the heat of the liver.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.500
Then, if your pancreas is

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.720
also neglected, then you get a disease like Diabetes.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:23.540
Now, Diabetes is a disease very common with the people who think too much, who sit in the, on their chairs and are planning -

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.840
they get Diabetes - not the villagers. Say, in Indian village

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:33.920
they take sugar in such a way that the spoon has to stand at perpendicular,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.740
then only they think it's tea otherwise it's no tea.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.900
And they never get, they never get Diabetes - they don't know what is Diabetes is. It's only the people

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:50.660
who are sitting on their chairs and thinking too much get Diabetes. So, this neglect of the pancreas creates this problem.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.180
The third one is much more dangerous, is the one, is the spleen.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.940
The life today is so hectic and so full of tensions -

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:05.700
early in the morning first of all you read the newspaper. Of course the newspaper always give the horrid,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.680
most horrid news in the first page, you see, so it's a sensation.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.880
But as soon as you read that newspaper, your spleen goes into contractions.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.920
Because the spleen has a job to create Red blood corpuscles for the emergencies

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.840
and such an emergency is a reason, so poor spleen doesn't know what to do.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.480
After that, you in a hurry, you just don't take your breakfast or may take it somehow,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:37.600
jump into your car, shouting at all the people who have jammed on the way and then ultimately if you reach your office somehow or the other

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:45.760
little late then you had it. So, all this spoils the rhythmic system of your spleen - it's the rhythmic system.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:52.600
It gives you the rhythm of life and when it becomes unrhythmically active, then it goes crazy.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.640
Because our life is little crazy and the poor spleen also becomes crazy with it.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:04.480
That craziness causes the vulnerability to a very serious disease called as Blood cancer.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.660
It doesn't know when to produce more blood, when to reduce it and it just behaves in such a crazy manner

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:16.580
that a disease like Blood cancer is caused. You'll be surprised we, with sahaja yoga, with this Kundalini awakening

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.880
many people, at least I know about 10 or 12 people have been cured of Blood cancer

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:29.240
who were certified to be dead within one year's time or minimum of one month also, they're all nicely

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.060
kicking because it's about, I think,

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.260
6-7 years back they were cured of their diseases and still living all right.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:47.800
So such diseases can be cured only by putting uh.. your Kundalini, through those centers, nourishing them

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:55.780
and bringing them back to normal and connecting them through the central uh.. path, it passes through the

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:01.660
last center, as we call it, the limbic area - you see, there's a limbic area, beyond that

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:07.280
crosses over the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone on your head and

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.300
that's how you get the actualization of your baptism.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:20.700
It's not just something artificial that I take the child and child is crying loudly and put some oil on that and say now you're baptised.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.560
No, it's, there has to be the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:34.660
And such a person has to have the powers of a realized soul and the powers of the realized souls are many fold.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.260
We can describe them in short that first of all, once you get your realization

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.140
you know about yourself, about your centers. You know what's wrong with you,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:52.000
you know what's wrong with others because there's another thin g that happens to you that you become collectively conscious.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.660
That means on your Central Nervous System you can feel others on your finger-tips.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:03.020
That's how you know what's wrong with them, what's wrong with you. If you know how to correct that part

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.920
you're all right. So, health-wise you become all right.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:15.100
Then, mentally we have seen many people who have been suffering from depressions and Schizophrenia - all so many diseases, even some cases

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:22.180
cases of retardation of small children, have been cured by Kundalini awakening. It's remarkable!

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:30.500
Some people take more time, some people take very little time - it has worked out. It's fantastic the way it works out your corrections.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:36.620
It's like, putting to the mains and you get all the energy flowing into you and you just get corrected.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:44.300
The third thing that happens to you, apart from Collective Consciousness, is that, when the Kundalini crosses over this center

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.380
of Agnya, we become absolutely a person which

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:56.020
has got a capacity, what we call, is of thoughtless awareness. That means you're absolutely aware.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.800
Now, if you want to think you'll think otherwise you won't think. You just get, don't get bothered about thinking,

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:07.740
just it's there, you see everything like a witness - you just see everything. Now say, for example,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.620
I see something beautiful, like these flowers now, somebody would say, "Oh, from where to get this?" lots of thoughts,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:20.160
"From where to get these flowers, uh..how much should I pay for it, what should I do about it?"

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.840
or else, I just watch it. And when I just watch it, just witness

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:32.980
then what happens, the joy of that creation, of that Creator, just starts flowing

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:39.920
from My head downward, cooling Me down completely. There's no thought, it's like a lake

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:47.500
which is absolutely ripple-less - that's how the mind becomes - and all that is created around it, reflects completely into it

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.920
without any disturbance. Such a mind you develop and that's what I call,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.360
is the mind of a realized soul which is so peaceful.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:05.260
Now, we talk of peace, foundation of peace and all that - I've seen the people, now in the other life of [UNCLEAR] one  I lead

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:12.880
as a wife of someone, I've met many people who are supposed to be uh...Nobel Prize winners

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:19.680
on Peace and who have founded Peace Foundations and things but in the Foundation there is no peace at all.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:27.920
They're one of the most disturbed people I've come across - and how can they emit peace to others when there's no peace within yourself.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.560
And this is your own glory, your own quality, within yourself - it is just to be awakened

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:40.460
to have that peace. That, as if, you go from your peripheries to your axis

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:46.440
and you're just looking at all those things that are happening. This is the peace that you develop.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:52.120
Then, you get the capacity to know the Absolute Truth.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:59.860
For example, you can feel it on your finger-tips. Now supposing, there's a gentleman just coming out of the jail and wearing these

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:07.680
robes and things, comes to Australia, you see, everybody thinks he's a big guru. How will you make out whether he's real or not?

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:16.000
In the beginning he may not even take money from you but ultimately he will. I mean, that 's the attitude. After all he's come all the way here not for, just for

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:21.180
your benevolence but for some money making propositions. But still,

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:28.760
if you put your hands towards such a person, you'll feel heat in your hand - maybe sometimes a little blistering might...

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:36.440
But if it's a real person, if it's a realized soul, whether dead or whether away from us, we can make it out

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.780
whether that person is realized or not, if he's truthful or not.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.560
Even if you have ten children and tie their eyes, if they're realized souls, you ask them, "What's wrong with this gentleman?"

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.800
They'll show the same finger, all of them, meaning, this is the center which is catching.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.940
So, it's Absolute Truth you know through that. And last of all, you become the joy.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.640
And joy doesn't have unhappiness and happiness - you just become joy.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.820
Cannot be described - is to be experienced and enjoyed.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:14.380
As it is, when it passes through the center there, the green part, you see, we call it as void.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.920
This is a different void from what Zen talk about but this void is where

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.620
our valency is. We have ten valencies.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:31.420
As you know, all matter has 8 valencies, animals have 9 and we have 10.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.100
These valencies get enlightened so, we,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:41.960
we get awakened in our own valencies which is the innate religion within us.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.680
Such people don't commit any sins automatically.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:52.560
Like the saints never committed any sins in the same way we do not because we become so powerful.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:24:01.360
Now, if you, if you're following any religion, you are capable of committing any sin that you like - there's no bondage on you.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:08.220
But once this happens you just don't do it - you just enjoy your virtues and virtues of others.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.960
It's such a beautiful life, is ahead of us, which we call as the Kingdom of God, where we have to enter into.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.600
These are the few things that happen but the best that I have seen in England is that

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:27.760
overnight people have given up drugs, overnight. It's very surprising, alcoholism. There was a doctor who was an alcoholic

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.500
and a very learned and a good doctor but took to alcoholism and he was just about to finish.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.540
When he came to us, he got his realization, now he's in-charge of seven hospital

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.800
and he's reading paper about sahaja yoga in Helsinki and also in

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:50.400
New York and then he went to Boston and now sahaja yoga is taking a very, sort of a, official

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.900
form because when I went to Russia, I was surprised at the Russian people, really very much surprised,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:03.700
never expected even ten people to come to My program but there were two thousand inside the hall and two thousand sitting outside.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.200
And they were all sitting till I was speaking to others - when I came out they were still there.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.880
And they said, "Mother, now what are we all going to do?" I said, "All right, tomorrow you all come here, in the morning time I'll be here."

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:22.240
And all of them - the two thousand inside and two thousand inside, all of them were sitting there waiting for Me to get their realization.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:28.400
And such beautiful people and the reason maybe that they're not conditioned like we are.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.940
We are free to think all right, it's all right to think about politics and all that but it's nothing to think about politics, what is there to think about?

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:41.000
Whatever is there, is there. You can see that clearly but the way they are, I think because

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:47.000
they don't talk of religion, they don't talk of God - there's no conditioning. They don't say, "We are chosen ones

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:54.840
and that Jews are bad or Christians are bad or Hindus are bad and they are bad." Nothing, they don't know anything about it, they are like clean slates.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:59.540
And it's perfectly all right. I talk to them about God, Jesus Christ and everything -

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.180
they didn't mind at all - they were very happy about it. That they said, "This is the knowledge we were waiting for."

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:11.000
And now, you'll be surprised that Russia has accepted us as an independent organization - we are the only people who have got this.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.640
There are three doctors in Delhi, those who have got M.D. in Sahaja yoga for

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:23.520
curing Epilepsy, curing Asthma and other Psychosomatic diseases. Now, there are seven doctors in London, who are now

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:31.980
doing researches. Of course, we have to now prove the existence of God, existence of this All-Pervading Power.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:37.580
Existence of this power which is God's love - it exists.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:42.120
We should not be so desperate in life, whatever we are seeking, is just at hand.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.400
I'm so happy to be here with you all. Yesterday,

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:53.600
I allowed them to ask some question, they asked really very good question, very relevant and I think, at least

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:58.540
ninety percent got realization. I was very happy to see yesterday's crowd

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:02.260
and today, I'm sure, all of you are going to experience it.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.000
Your own being, your own glory, your own Self - what Christ has said that you're to be born again.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:13.680
It's not a certificate, it cannot be an organization - we have no organization as such.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:20.200
You cannot be a member of anything - you cannot pay for it but it just becoming, becoming is the point.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:26.340
May God bless you all! I would like to have some questions from you and then I'll, I hope

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.480
we'll be able to do something about Self-realization. All right.

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:40.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.420
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.660
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.400
- What is the question he asked?
 -[INAUDIBLE]
  -Unnh?
   - [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:24.980
- Valency?
 - [INAUDIBLE]
  - Have you been a student of Chemistry, please - the gentleman who asked Me about valency?

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.500
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - No, no, all right, then it's quite a big story.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.820
How to explain?

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:42.880
You see, if you see the Periodic laws of all the chemicals,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:49.680
you'll be amazed how they're planned out. They're divided into eight different categories

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:57.500
and where there are two types of chemicals. One which give-in unnh..

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.700
to others and join and some which take it from others and join.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:10.140
So, that is what is the valency, for example, something like

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:18.360
Hydrogen has one, Oxygen has two, like that, and at the end of it, the last is the

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:23.900
eight valencies, as they call it, so there could be 4+ or 4-.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:30.300
In the human-beings we have ten valencies and these ten valencies act

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:37.940
but Carbon has four valencies that's why Carbon is very important for forming Amino acids because it can

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.760
join on both the sides, it has four, it can give four or take four - it's a neutral sort of a thing

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.140
and unless and until you have Carbon you cannot form Organic Chemistry

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:53.680
and after that you have to have Nitrogen with it, so you form unnh.. what you call, amino acids.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:30:00.400
So, it's not so important at this point to talk about these things uh.. I just mentioned it that there are, there are

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:06.400
ten valencies within us, meaning there are ten dharmas,  there are ten religions within us.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:12.300
But if I say religion, you would jump , so I used, unnh.. the word valency -

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:18.960
is the dharma. Dharma means the one  you should sustain. Like the quality of the light is to give light

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:26.640
in the same way you have ten qualities as human-beings - these are the ten commandments.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.980
You can say, it's in every religion there are these ten commandments.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:48.420
Pankha laga do, pankha, pankha nahin laaye. Rehne do, yeh nahin chahiye. Yeh nahin chahiye, iski zaroorat nahin.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:00.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.960
- What's she saying?
 -  [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:12.400
It has, it has some problem but you see, Kundalini is such a beautiful thing, She's your mother, She's your individual mother

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:19.920
and She has been like a tape recorder for you. She knows all about your problems and She knows how to work it out.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:27.520
So, though it is damaged, of course in the beginning little difficult but then Kundalini itself goes and works it out and She builds it up,

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:34.780
repairs it and it's so beautiful the way She looks after. Supposing, you have a liver problem - of course you'll get your realization -

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:43.020
but then, She will go down to the liver and show that, "See, this is the point". You can actually see the pulsation at the liver point, just like heart.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:03.320
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - [INAUDIBLE] dreams [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:10.520
Dreams could be from 3-4 areas - from the Collective Subconscious, could be

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:18.140
from the Subconscious of the last lives, could be the Subconscious of this life - it can be

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:25.640
from different areas. And unless and until you are a deep person, you cannot decode it and understand it -

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:33.160
it's all haphazard and comes. So, it is a suggestion that comes to us through our Subconscious area sometimes

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:41.280
but it can also come from the Unconscious area and when it comes from Unconscious area, then it is very suggestive, what is to be done.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:48.720
Hume has done lot of work on that and he's really reached quite a great explanation on this point of dreams.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:56.820
But better than dreams or anything else, which is rather vague, and you have to go to a Psychiatrist to find out and maybe, he might be also wrong

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:02.180
but here it is on your finger-tips, you can feel everything - so what's the need to know through the dreams?

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:22.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:36.060
When the Kundalini rises there are spiritual effects, does this [INAUDIBLE] to physical effect as well?

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:42.500
Yes, there are. There are many physical uh..effects you can see that the

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.480
other pupils dilate and your eyes start sparkling.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Then also, you start feeling the cool breeze on your finger-tips, you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:01.020
and I've seen people who got realization and I met them after one year, I couldn't recognize them

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:09.280
because they had suddenly become very young - about 10 years younger than what they were. And the face shines and the skin becomes very nice.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:17.340
So also, the because the health improves and the temperament improves, person becomes very sweet,

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:25.520
kind, compassionate and dynamic and sometimes you're amazed at yourself and others are very much amazed too, the way you are changed.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:38.740
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:46.980
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:55.180
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:59.260
She's [UNCLEAR] that Hatha Yoga [UNCLEAR]

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:06.260
Yes, it is. Please be seated, I'll answer that question to you. Bhakti yoga means devotion to God - it's very important.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:12.820
But if you see Gita, it was written by Shri Krishna, who was very intelligent

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.380
and knew that human-beings are little not up to the point. So,

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:26.640
uh.. He tried to say things in a way uh.. where we have to read between the lines. For Bhakti He said that,

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:33.180
"If you give Me flowers and water - pusham, falam, toyam - and also fruits, I'll accept."

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:41.220
But when it comes to Bhakti He said it should be ananya. There's a very important word - ananya, means when there is not the other.

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.280
That means, when you become one with Me, that means when you are realized soul.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:54.500
That's what is the Bhakti. Bhakti, without the connection is like telephoning God without the connection -

00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:02.140
- is as simple as that.
 - [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.180
- What she's saying?
 - [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.520
She says, surely Bhakti means union through love.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:17.480
No, but you see, the love that is true love but we say is imagination without connection - it's just imagination,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:25.080
is not the truth. Unless and until you have got your realization, your Bhakti is just imagination.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.280
Anything else, please [UNCLEAR - MADAM?]

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:06.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:14.240
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:23.480
The person's been practicing yoga and experiences all of negative emotions like anger
 - Very [UNCLEAR - MUCH OR WELL?]
  - heart, the subtle system is affected

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:29.720
Uh.. you see, the so called yoga, is just the right side activity of Prana

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:39.140
Actually, Patanjali started Hatha yoga - 'Ha' means the, 'Ha' is the Sun 'Tha' is the Moon - so both the things.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:44.500
And if you read the whole Patanjali, so big is that - you see the Patanjali yoga shastra is so big.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:52.260
He's dealt with, first of all, the cleansing of the right side and then of the left side and then he has talked of all these things that I'm telling you,

00:37:52.680 --> 00:38:00.680
about thoughtless awareness and doubtless awareness that is called as nirvichar samadhi and then it is called as nirvikalpa samadhi.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.040
All that he has talked throughout - 'Rutambhara Pragnya' he's called into the All-Pervading power.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:11.400
But some people who must have been to some guru somewhere and must have had the first wee part of it

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.920
so they came down and have started teaching people these yogas of exercise and acrobats.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:24.420
This is all right sided because is all physical. We're not only physical being. As a result of that what happens, such people dry out.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:29.700
Right side dries you, like the Sun dries you - you dry out. I mean, you say, it's true, I mean,

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:36.820
the other day I was telling you that if you have to reach any Hatha yogi, better carry a barge pole with you because can be any time they might jump at you.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:44.160
They're good at curses, they're good at anger, so, that's not yoga - in yoga you're completely integrated.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.400
Only your liver gets bad and sometimes they get very bad massive heart attacks also.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:59.300
So, this is like indiscriminate use of something. Like you take all the, all the medicines from the medical,

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:05.680
medicine box without knowing what is to be done. Of course, we also use certain physical,

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:12.760
physical things, like supposing as you asked Me, that for the uh.. if there's any problem in the spinal cord

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:19.100
you see, we might tell you that you do a particular type of an asana but we must know it scientifically what's to be done.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:26.120
Unless and until the Kundalini rises, how are we to know where is the obstruction. Just before that, what's the use of doing all these things.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:31.900
You might be having problem here and you might be doing the exercise of your stomach - what's the use?

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.600
So, it is very scientific. You must know what is to be done where. We do use very rarely, but we do use it.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.060
But it is precise - it's a science.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:53.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:59.620
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:05.880
- What's she talking about?
 - [INAUDIBLE]
  - She says Hatha yoga is a science too.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:13.240
No, it is, if you know the whole of it, not half way. You see, a, a half-baked doctor is more dangerous than

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:21.320
an ordinary person and that's what they are. So madam, if you care for your benevolence, you have some patience and take your realization

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:29.300
then you'll understand how wrong it is - all right? Just certifying like that, is not proper - you must first go into it

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:34.380
and find out what is what and then you can say something about, something very definitely.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.900
It's a science, no doubt, but how many are equipped?

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:46.580
They haven't even read the whole of Patanjali - none of them - it's a business.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.200
Is best is go jogging instead, don't have to pay at least.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:41:00.220
That's also sometimes not good, too much of it. You have to be in moderation in everything.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:12.640
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:21.280
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:28.820
- What's say?
 - Is the role of realization of sahaja yoga protecting the environment?

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.000
Oh, very much, very much!

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:38.240
Annh, as it cleanses you, it cleanses also the atmosphere.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:46.940
There's a doctor we have, Dr. Hamid from Austria, who has, who has tried sahaja yoga vibrations

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:53.260
on the, on the trees which are afflicted by acid rain

00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:00.580
and they were surprised that 60% of those trees which were uh..

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:09.160
I mean most of them which were lower than the 60 years of age have survived and thriving

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.300
because this clears the whole thing.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:23.840
That's the vital energy which neutralizes environmental problems absolutely.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:30.440
It helps agriculture very much. You won't believe if I tell you, it's so fantastic.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:36.940
Because understand that this is the energy from where we get everything.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:47.900
This energy thinks, as I told you, coordinates, organizes everything and above all, it loves.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:04.300
It solves all the problems - I think, human problems will be solved on three levels, I should say. First of all, that human beings get

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.440
transformed, so human-beings improve.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.520
Then, because of Collective Consciousness, they relate to each other very well.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:21.800
The, we are travelling like criminals with our passports all over, you see, while this world is made one by God.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:28.020
And all this division by races, by

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:33.180
religions, by all kinds of rationalities, everything disappears -

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:41.660
second level is and the third level, the atmosphere. The whole atmosphere improves, the society improves,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.220
the political atmosphere will improve - is also the

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:55.420
natural atmosphere will improve because we become so sensible and wise and we don't go to extremes of producing plastics.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:05.540
We get satisfied - there's no need to produce so much of plastics but it is so because, say about, when I was young

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:12.280
young, eh..we didn't need so many tumblers in the house but somehow now, we want to have disposal ones.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:18.660
So, once you start disposal ones, there's no end to it and you can't dispose them ultimately, that's what they are.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:28.540
One good tumbler could be cleaned out for one person and can be used for various things but now we have so many things. And

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:35.400
then another modern problem is of creating new fashions everyday so you go to any house and you find

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:42.160
piles and piles of clothes from nineteen such and such to nineteen such and such

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:48.720
and every year they're changing. So, all these nonsensical ideas go and you really

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:54.440
become such a wise person. You know what to use, how much to use, how to have a balance in life -

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.540
we lead a very imbalanced life in modern times

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:07.680
and we're playing into the hands of entrepreneur. Then we play into the hands of the people who produce these

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:13.760
eh.. things like seeds, which are eh..

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.620
to  be, they cannot be reproduced and the seeds are specially made as hybrid they are

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:25.440
but if you have even ordinary seeds vibrated they give much more yield than the non-hybrid.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:33.640
Even the animals, we try to do all kinds of things with them and, I must say, that the animals like this are real bizarre, horrible people.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:40.320
They don't understand anything, they can walk on the street, get killed or they have no brains and if you take milk from such

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:44.440
animals, we also become little pulpy there.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:51.940
We have experimented in India, that animals who have been unnh.. hybrid type

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:57.680
are something, schizophrenic of that kind

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.280
while animals which are natural, understand.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.480
Even the chickens, they have found out the same thing.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:17.480
So, all this hybrid feeding our body, can create lot of problems

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.900
for us in our brains. So though, there is the, we are more more worried about the

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.960
environment but within ourselves we're creating lots of problems already.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:38.360
To get to natural food is impossible because as it is, you see the natural seeds and the natural things

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:46.240
are not capable of reproduction but if you give them vibrations they produce much more - that's how you solve those problems.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:54.500
But first, we must believe in ourselves that we can do all that.

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:58.920
If we can go on to the moon, why can't we go to our Spirit?

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:10.700
Excuse me, Mother. Can You sent excellent vibrations to somebody to get Self-realization without him being

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.340
-  in front of You?
 - Yeah
  - Yes, please.
   - You can.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:22.300
You see, it's like the subtlest of the Ether, supposing, subtlest of the Ether. Now, through the Ether

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:29.760
you can see anything, you see. If you put on the television, you can see anything that's from India or from England. In the same way, it's the subtle thing.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:36.060
But this ether is something so wonderful that it not only that

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.340
eh.. it [UNCLEAR - TRANSLATES OR TRANSPATES?] your ideas, not only, but it acts.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:47.660
Like you can see that eh.. a television you eh.. you supposing eh.. use a television

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:54.320
now you just see the image but the image does not come out and act on you but here this goes and act.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:02.160
That's why they say that Kaliyuga is over. The worst times of Kaliyuga means the

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:07.620
bad days are over. Now Krityuga has started when this All-Pervading power is working it out.

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:15.860
But the problem is, how many are going to get to it?

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.280
It's said only 144 thousand people - we already have it -

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:30.240
in the Bible, it's quite - I hope they don't mean exactly that. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:42.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:50.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:57.340
[INAUDIBLE ] practical exercise which carries this flow of energy.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.600
That's like a real seeker. That's what we are going to do now. That's like a real seeker.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.920
That's the best question, I was waiting for.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.460
All right, so we are all ready for it, isn't it?

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.140
Can you put it up, please, a little, for Me?

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:25.720
You have, I'm sorry, you have to take out your shoes unnh to touch the Mother Earth, though She's for...

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:33.280
- [UNCLEAR] You should stand?
 - I think, I'll sit down and stand up. You stand up here, yes please.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:40.540
You can take out your shoes also, I think. They..

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:48.380
First of all, of course as I told you, it acts spontaneously but I will tell you this because

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:54.800
you should know, later on, how to raise your Kundalini again and again, which is a very, very simple thing.

00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:00.400
At the very outset, there are two conditions, of course.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:06.820
The first condition is, that you have to be very self-confident about yourself -

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.740
that you all can get your realization and forget your past.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:19.840
There's nothing like sin at this moment, nothing like mistakes at this moment.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:27.500
Whatever has happened, has happened, is finished. So, first of all, you must forgive yourself

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:36.500
completely - that's first condition. Then the second condition, that you have

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:43.300
to forgive everybody else, at this moment.

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:47.300
Not to remember who has tortured  you or troubled you.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:55.460
It's nothing difficult - it's a myth, it's a myth that you don't forgive or you forgive - what do you do, nothing?

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:03.400
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. So, I would request you, that you just

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:07.960
say that, "I forgive everyone and I forgive myself."

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.240
After all, we are human-beings, you see - we're not God.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:17.480
So, human-beings will create mistakes and will do something wrong, isn't it?

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:23.160
It's nothing wrong in it and the Divine power has

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:27.680
such powers of forgiveness, is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.980
So also, not to feel guilty at all.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.960
This idea of sin and all that, I don't know, from where it has come into the heads of people.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:45.960
So, just forget about it and I'm sure, it will work out. Because today I can feel it it's, on this center you can feel it, it's too much catching.

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:51.680
So people are just feeling guilty, that how can I get realization - you are going to get it,

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.320
have confidence - that's the promise, all right?

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:03.460
Now, he's going to show you, how we're going to work it out.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:11.020
Both the feet have to be away from each other, as I told you, left and, left and right side are two energies, so, away from each other.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:18.680
Now, the left hand has to be towards Me, like this,

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:26.640
in a comfortable way, whichever you want, you can put it on your lap or can have it like this - because it's the desire to get Self-realization.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:32.740
And the right hand has to be put on different centers as I tell you. First on the heart

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:41.600
because in the heart is the reflection of God Almighty as the spirit, in the heart.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.080
And then,

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:54.700
we have to go to another center on the left-hand side - we work only on left-hand side.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.860
We put our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:08.080
This is the center of your mastery. You have to become master of yourself.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:16.420
This is created by all the great masters and we have to just awaken it.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:22.720
Then you go down to the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side, press it hard -

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:29.880
this is the center of pure knowledge. This pure knowledge acts through your Central Nervous System,

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.260
acts through your Central Nervous System.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:40.860
Then we go up again, into the upper portion of our abdomen, on the center of the

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:48.240
guru principle, the mastery and then again we go to the heart, where we're the spirit.

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:55.140
Then, we take our right hand in the corner of our neck and our head, here

00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:02.800
and turn our head towards the right, like this - this center is the one, I'm telling you, is

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:08.840
today very much catching - which is that people feel guilty, so

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:13.960
this center is a very dangerous one. If it catches on the left-hand side

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:18.340
one develops horrible things like angina and also spondylitis

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:23.040
so better is to turn your head right, towards the right, fully.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:32.300
Now, you have to stretch your hand - not stretch your hand but put your hand across, like this, on your forehead,

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.600
hold your forehead and put it down, as much as you can.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:41.500
This is the center for forgiving others.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:50.080
I'll tell you later on when you close your eyes in full way. Now, take back this hand on the back side of your head, back side of your head

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.520
and push back your head completely,

00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:01.360
resting on that hand, and here now, is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:09.380
from the Divine, without counting your mistakes, without eh.. counting the people eh. whom eh..

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:17.460
whom you have hurt or anything, so just without feeling any such guilt, you have to just ask for forgiveness.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:25.100
Now, stretch your hand, right hand, fully and the center of your palm has to be put exactly

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:31.280
on the spot where it was a soft bone in your childhood - press it hard, put down your head.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:39.180
Now here, push back your fingers, as back as possible and put a pressure on your scalp.

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:47.580
Now, you have to move the scalp, very slowly, clockwise. Clockwise, very slowly, seven times just like that.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:09.100
Done. That's all we have to do but now, please take out your spectacles

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:16.540
and close your eyes, until I tell you don't open your eyes - it might help your eyesight also.

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:23.780
Everyone should do it and you'll see the results will be good.

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:32.020
[UNCLEAR] Now, we close our eyes, put both the feet apart.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:40.640
Don't worry about your thoughts, let them come. They'll all disappear after some time. Put your left hand towards Me.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.860
Put your right hand on your heart.

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:04.200
Now, here lies the Spirit. So, like a computer you have to ask Me a question,

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:07.560
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:15.280
Ask the question in your heart three times, please. "Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask this question.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:28.920
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your own guide because in the light of Spirit you know your way, you become a master.

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:36.140
So now, take down your right hand on the left hand side of your abdomen,

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.340
the upper part, press it hard. Here

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:46.440
you ask another question to Me - you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:54.400
"Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times.

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:24.520
Now, take down your hand on the left hand side of your abdomen in the lower region and press it hard.

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:33.160
Here, I have to say, that I respect your freedom

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:39.240
as you have to have the ultimate freedom. I cannot force on you

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:46.820
the pure knowledge so please ask six times in your heart,

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:52.060
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge." Now,

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:57.740
it is six times because this center has got six petals.

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:20.040
As soon as you say that, the Kundalini starts moving upward. So, we have

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:25.340
to now nourish the upper centers with our self-confidence.

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:34.160
So now, take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, press it on the left hand side and

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.840
with full confidence, you say, to open this center,

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:45.300
"Mother, I am my own master," just say that

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:53.640
ten times - it has got ten petals. "Mother, I am my own master."

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.740
The greatest truth about you is that, you are the Spirit.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:08.240
You are not this body, you are not this mind, you're not these emotions,

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:12.700
you're not this ego but you are pure Spirit.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.180
So now, raise your right hand on

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:29.660
on your heart, press it, and say it with full confidence, the greatest truth about yourself,

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:35.140
twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:52.020
The All-Pervading power is the ocean of bliss

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.620
and of peace. It is the ocean of

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:07.220
knowledge and joy but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:16.340
So, whatever mistakes you might have committed, can be easily dissolved by this power of forgiveness.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:23.960
So, please forgive yourself and now, raise your hand, right hand

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:30.800
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head towards the right side.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.780
Here, with full confidence, you have to say,

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:45.700
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it sixteen times. "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:26.860
Now, it is a myth whether you forgive others or you don't forgive.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:35.420
But if you don't forgive, you play into the wrong hands. So now, raise your hand to your forehead across

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:41.620
and put down your forehead, on that hand, bend it down as much as you can.

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:49.420
Here, you have to say, without thinking about it

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:56.640
"Mother, I forgive everyone." Please don't count people whom you have to forgive but just say, "Mother, I

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.200
forgive everyone," just say - it's not difficult, it's just a myth.

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:25.680
Say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone." From your heart, not how many times.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:38.700
Now, take back this right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head,

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:45.260
push back your head on that hand, as far as possible.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:53.140
Now here you have to say, without feeling guilty again,

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:59.480
from your heart, "Mother,"

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:08.520
or you can say, "The Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me."

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:18.360
This is the time you don't have to count your mistakes. Just for your own satisfaction you're saying that

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:24.100
from your heart, "If I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:30.000
This forgiveness you're asking from the Divine Power which knows everything about you.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:49.660
Now, spread your hand fully and the palms stretched

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:57.740
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:04.660
in your childhood. Now, press it hard and push back your fingers.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.920
Now move it

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.200
seven times - by putting down your head, you'll do it better -

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:24.300
clockwise. Here again, I cannot trespass your freedom,

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:32.260
I cannot force Self-realization on you, you have to ask for it. So, seven times please say,

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.840
"Mother, give me my Self-realization."

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.760

Right hand towards Me, like this,

01:06:52.680 --> 01:07:00.200
and bend your head and with the left hand see if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:04.980
You have to certify yourself - now don't start doubting because

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.900
you see, it is coming out of your head. Just try to see here,

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:17.800
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head. Maybe, wee bit - some people get it here, some people get it closer.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.580
So, but it should not be touching the head, it should be above the head. Just try to see,

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.140
if there is a cool breeze emitting out of your heads.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:37.900
Now, please put your left hand towards Me. Again bend your head and see for yourself,

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:43.880
yourself to be seen - just see if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:55.280
Now, put your right hand again, last and again see, put your left hand,

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:01.160
bend your head, please see clearly, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head -

could be very far away, could be closer.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:11.500
Could be hot, doesn't matter - the heat has to come out - doesn't matter if there is heat.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.220
Now, you have to put up both your hands in the air, like that

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:24.680
and ask a question - push back your head and ask a question, "Mother, is this  the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:33.720
Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?" Ask this question, thrice, ask this question.
