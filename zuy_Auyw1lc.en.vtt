About Indian Sages
Aurangabad, India, 19 December 1989

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.783
So now most of you are here,

00:02:45.823 --> 00:02:57.721
and it’s a nice place for all of you
to meet from different countries.

00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:04.272
Aurangabad has a special significance in my own life

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:10.877
because my forefathers came from
a place very near from here,

00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:15.546
called as Pathan
but originally known as Pratishthan.

00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:20.930
I think about two years back we were there,

00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:29.108
and this is the place where Valmiki,
who wrote the great epic of Ramayana,

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:35.900
lived here. And when Sita came,

00:03:35.984 --> 00:03:43.473
was taken away from her house

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:46.881
and when she was pregnant,

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:53.009
there was another ashram of his in Nepal where she stayed,

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:57.718
and then she was brought here.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:03.276
That’s why you see a kind of a

00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:13.604
culture of Maharashtra, going to the hills
and also to Nepal, through her

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:21.376
and her children who went down,
went to Russia and another to China.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.952
The name of one who went to Russia
was Luv,

00:04:26.977 --> 00:04:30.381
and another who went to China was Kush.

00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:33.238
So they are called as Slavs.

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:35.870
They were mostly called as Lev,

00:04:36.094 --> 00:04:40.188
and those who went to China
are called as Kusha.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:44.467
So they lived here from their birth

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:48.353
till they became about, say, twelve years of age,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.145
when Valmiki composed Ramayana

00:04:52.177 --> 00:04:57.349
and taught them how to sing that song of Ramayana.

00:04:57.492 --> 00:05:01.062
So then they went to Ayodhya

00:05:01.087 --> 00:05:05.012
and there they started singing the song.

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:08.764
With that singing, Shri Rama was very much touched.

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.597
They challenged him in a way, that
there is a lady who was such a chaste person,

00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:20.449
who was driven out of - they didn’t know
that was Rama was their father.

00:05:21.616 --> 00:05:27.409
Then they came back and stayed here

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.915
for some time and then went again to Nepal
because  she was a Nepali lady.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.021
So I think her father must have arranged
something for her to stay in Nepal

00:05:39.046 --> 00:05:45.408
in that Valmiki ashram,
which can be only approached from Bihar,

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:48.012
which I have seen Myself.

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:56.000
Also that’s a very important spot where
this ashram was established by Valmiki,

00:05:56.017 --> 00:05:59.841
because here there was a big struggle of evolution

00:05:59.866 --> 00:06:03.388
going on between the big animals like mammoth

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.439
and all those big, big animals,

00:06:06.464 --> 00:06:09.997
between the others who were very quick to turn

00:06:10.022 --> 00:06:16.031
and were very clever, intelligent and supple.

00:06:16.238 --> 00:06:19.923
They destroyed most of these big animals.

00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:26.288
And in that river there were lots of crocodiles,

00:06:26.743 --> 00:06:33.312
and when the king of the elephant, known as Gajendra,

00:06:33.337 --> 00:06:37.216
was drinking in water, one of them, a big one,

00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:43.281
attacked to kill him so that the whole clan,

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:49.297
or you can say the whole genii
of these elephants, would be destroyed.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.092
That spot is very important

00:06:54.117 --> 00:06:56.680
because there Shri Vishnu appeared

00:06:56.705 --> 00:07:00.081
and he killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:03.778
So out of all these
big animals, only the elephant was saved,

00:07:03.803 --> 00:07:08.203
and that’s why that place is called as Gajendramoksh.

00:07:08.322 --> 00:07:13.077
So there’s a big quarrel going on because
Valmiki had his ashrams in different places,

00:07:13.077 --> 00:07:15.742
where [was real of Valmiki’s things].

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:19.499
But actually he lived here in this area

00:07:19.516 --> 00:07:22.636
on the other side of the Godavari River

00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:30.089
which was going along the

00:07:30.336 --> 00:07:35.282
Paithan or the Pratishthan, the kingdom of Shalivana.

00:07:35.576 --> 00:07:40.894
And he used to plunder people and he was a plunderer.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.245
He was a fisherman and he was a plunderer.

00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:48.942
Then from there they say Narada came as a
saint from there,

00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:53.629
from the other side, and they plundered him also.

00:07:53.654 --> 00:07:57.371
So he said ,“Why are you plundering me?” Narada asked.

00:07:57.396 --> 00:08:01.625
He said, “Because I have to feed my children.
I have to feed my wife.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.457
I have to feed my family. I have to look after them.

00:08:04.482 --> 00:08:07.731
I have a large family. So how am I to maintain all that?

00:08:07.756 --> 00:08:10.688
I am the only person who is the earning member. “

00:08:10.713 --> 00:08:13.988
But he said, “Do you think
they will sacrifice everything for you?”

00:08:14.013 --> 00:08:16.876
He said, “I am sure they will.”
He said, “All right."

00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:20.416
Now you become like a dead man.”

00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:24.363
And they took his dead body, so-called, four of them,

00:08:24.372 --> 00:08:27.506
four saints, and put it in the house

00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:32.404
and told them that this fellow died in plundering us.

00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:37.264
“But there is a way to again bring him to life,

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.729
that you have to promise that somebody from you,

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:45.534
you all, have to die in his place.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:52.559
If you agree that you will die in his place,
then one person has to replace him.”

00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:56.904
They tried and tried.

00:08:56.929 --> 00:09:00.383
And somebody said, “No, I cannot die. I am too young.”

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:03.283
Another said,“No, I have to look after my children.”

00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:08.189
Another said, “What will happen to my grandchildren?”
all kinds of things.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:11.571
And nobody offered themselves.

00:09:11.596 --> 00:09:16.317
So Valmiki got up and he realised that so far

00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:20.216
he has been really doing something wrong.

00:09:20.362 --> 00:09:24.402
So he said then, “What should I say?”

00:09:24.427 --> 00:09:26.876
He said, “What would you say then if you
die?”

00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:29.545
He said, “I’ll say, ‘Mara, mara’,” means,

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.610
‘I am dead. I am dead. I am dead’.”

00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:33.190
He said, “All right, say the other way.

00:09:33.215 --> 00:09:36.949
Go on saying.” So it came to,
“Rama, Rama,” like that.

00:09:36.974 --> 00:09:38.887
But they said, “It won’t work out.

00:09:38.896 --> 00:09:40.892
You have to do a penance

00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:44.225
because you have done lots of bad things in your life

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.738
and you have hurt many people.

00:09:46.774 --> 00:09:50.262
So you have to do the penance.”

00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:56.954
So he sat down for penance on a big mountain here

00:09:56.992 --> 00:09:59.321
which is called as the Valmiki Mountain.

00:10:00.624 --> 00:10:03.510
And the termites ate up his body,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.607
and he became like a termite.

00:10:05.623 --> 00:10:07.878
Only his neck was up and he was saying that

00:10:07.903 --> 00:10:11.145
and the whole body was eaten up by termites.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.471
So then again Shri Vishnu appeared before him

00:10:14.496 --> 00:10:18.716
and removed his termites and gave him his realisation.

00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:23.156
And a termite in Sanskrit language is called as valmi.

00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:25.796
That’s why he was called as valmi ki. That’s why

00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:28.114
he was called as Valmiki.

00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:35.844
So the story then afterwards leads
to the coming of Sita there.

00:10:35.945 --> 00:10:40.396
So it is a very important part of Ramayana was played here,

00:10:40.421 --> 00:10:44.362
and it is said that Shalivahanas helped

00:10:44.387 --> 00:10:50.139
this Valmiki temple and Valmiki person to prosper,

00:10:50.164 --> 00:10:54.760
and they treated him with great respect as their master.

00:10:54.785 --> 00:10:58.765
But actually, their master was long
time back was one Chandalia

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.372
where we have taken the land near Nira River.

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:07.871
So it’s a very ancient time thousands of years back

00:11:07.896 --> 00:11:13.000
because Rama must have lived before Krishna,
say about eight thousand years back.

00:11:13.025 --> 00:11:17.691
So it is a very ancient place, this one is.

00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:20.672
After that people removed all the trees and all that.

00:11:20.697 --> 00:11:23.148
So it has become such a barren land

00:11:23.173 --> 00:11:30.974
and it is not sort of so fertile now,

00:11:30.999 --> 00:11:35.189
but once upon a time it was a beautiful forest here

00:11:35.214 --> 00:11:39.786
and in that forest Valmiki used to live.

00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:42.174
So this is the story of this place, I hope

00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:46.442
you will be happy to know you are in a very
historical place just now.

00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:49.758
And I am trying to find out if you can on your way go to

00:11:49.783 --> 00:11:53.006
also to this Paithan, Pratishthan

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.014
on your way, maybe. I don’t know how,

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:57.306
because we are all running short of time

00:11:57.331 --> 00:12:00.355
because of aeroplane timings, as you know.

00:12:00.372 --> 00:12:04.140
But in any case I am very happy
that also Italians have arrived,

00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:07.089
and they have taken so much trouble to come all the way

00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:10.142
directly from there to get to the puja.

00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:15.030
Though I had arranged in Pratishthan
all their food, everything, breakfast,

00:12:15.055 --> 00:12:18.104
so they could sleep in the night and early in the morning

00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:21.518
take the food and come here.

00:12:22.695 --> 00:12:25.099
All these stories these
people know very well.

00:12:25.124 --> 00:12:29.272
We all know everything about our country,
these ancient times,

00:12:29.297 --> 00:12:36.730
you see, grand, beautiful, and the
work of all these saints and all these

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:45.033
seers has woven into the character of Maharashtran people.

00:12:45.058 --> 00:12:49.998
So you will find them that they have certain gifts

00:12:50.023 --> 00:12:54.935
already to protect themselves,
which has come because of the

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:02.741
following of these saints and
the following of a realised soul.

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:05.460
And the people are very God-fearing

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:11.215
and they respect saints and
they also know who is a real saint mostly.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.607
I hope you all will understand that

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:21.424
when we think of the comfort of our spirit,

00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:25.955
the whole life is sort of penetrated
with the light of the spirit,

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.102
and we start changing our attitude towards life.

00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:33.988
Not only that, but also we have a kind of a

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.542
tremendous confidence in our virtues
and we enjoy them.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.443
We do not indulge into any such thing.

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:45.748
Though in a way we can say that the,

00:13:45.773 --> 00:13:51.466
in this culture there is not much of finesse,
not much of artificiality.

00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:54.911
They won’t say thank you a hundred times.
That is not done.

00:13:54.943 --> 00:13:56.522
They don’t say sorry.

00:13:56.547 --> 00:13:59.438
They won’t even fold their hands to normally,

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:02.883
the women especially to men, and say namaskar.

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:05.547
Only to God they fold their hands.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.952
So there are certain things, that

00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:10.663
all the time we go on shaking hands in the West.

00:14:10.688 --> 00:14:14.085
All the time we start bowing to everyone, saying sorry,

00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:15.833
thank you and all that.

00:14:15.846 --> 00:14:17.559
That you will find they don’t do,

00:14:17.584 --> 00:14:20.957
but at heart they are very simple people.

00:14:20.982 --> 00:14:25.870
They live among rocks; so they
have that rocky character.

00:14:25.895 --> 00:14:28.006
And I hope you will enjoy them.

00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:30.463
May God bless you.
