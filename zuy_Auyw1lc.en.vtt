About Indian Sages
Aurangabad, India, 19 December 1989

02:42.859 --> 02:45.783
So now most of you are here,

02:45.823 --> 02:57.721
and it’s a nice place for all of you
to meet from different countries.

02:59.014 --> 03:04.272
Aurangabad has a special significance in my own life

03:04.289 --> 03:10.877
because my forefathers came from
a place very near from here,

03:10.902 --> 03:15.546
called as Pathan
but originally known as Pratishthan.

03:15.571 --> 03:20.930
I think about two years back we were there,

03:21.447 --> 03:29.108
and this is the place where Valmiki,
who wrote the great epic of Ramayana,

03:29.133 --> 03:35.900
lived here. And when Sita came,

03:35.984 --> 03:43.473
was taken away from her house

03:43.708 --> 03:46.881
and when she was pregnant,

03:46.906 --> 03:53.009
there was another ashram of his in Nepal where she stayed,

03:53.668 --> 03:57.718
and then she was brought here.

03:57.737 --> 04:03.276
That’s why you see a kind of a

04:06.506 --> 04:13.604
culture of Maharashtra, going to the hills
and also to Nepal, through her

04:13.629 --> 04:21.376
and her children who went down,
went to Russia and another to China.

04:22.129 --> 04:26.952
The name of one who went to Russia
was Luv,

04:26.977 --> 04:30.381
and another who went to China was Kush.

04:30.406 --> 04:33.238
So they are called as Slavs.

04:33.291 --> 04:35.870
They were mostly called as Lev,

04:36.094 --> 04:40.188
and those who went to China
are called as Kusha.

04:40.213 --> 04:44.467
So they lived here from their birth

04:44.492 --> 04:48.353
till they became about, say, twelve years of age,

04:48.420 --> 04:52.145
when Valmiki composed Ramayana

04:52.177 --> 04:57.349
and taught them how to sing that song of Ramayana.

04:57.492 --> 05:01.062
So then they went to Ayodhya

05:01.087 --> 05:05.012
and there they started singing the song.

05:05.167 --> 05:08.764
With that singing, Shri Rama was very much touched.

05:08.789 --> 05:13.597
They challenged him in a way, that
there is a lady who was such a chaste person,

05:13.622 --> 05:20.449
who was driven out of - they didn’t know
that was Rama was their father.

05:21.616 --> 05:27.409
Then they came back and stayed here

05:28.460 --> 05:33.915
for some time and then went again to Nepal
because  she was a Nepali lady.

05:33.940 --> 05:39.021
So I think her father must have arranged
something for her to stay in Nepal

05:39.046 --> 05:45.408
in that Valmiki ashram,
which can be only approached from Bihar,

05:45.433 --> 05:48.012
which I have seen Myself.

05:49.529 --> 05:56.000
Also that’s a very important spot where
this ashram was established by Valmiki,

05:56.017 --> 05:59.841
because here there was a big struggle of evolution

05:59.866 --> 06:03.388
going on between the big animals like mammoth

06:03.409 --> 06:06.439
and all those big, big animals,

06:06.464 --> 06:09.997
between the others who were very quick to turn

06:10.022 --> 06:16.031
and were very clever, intelligent and supple.

06:16.238 --> 06:19.923
They destroyed most of these big animals.

06:19.948 --> 06:26.288
And in that river there were lots of crocodiles,

06:26.743 --> 06:33.312
and when the king of the elephant, known as Gajendra,

06:33.337 --> 06:37.216
was drinking in water, one of them, a big one,

06:37.241 --> 06:43.281
attacked to kill him so that the whole clan,

06:43.306 --> 06:49.297
or you can say the whole genii
of these elephants, would be destroyed.

06:50.360 --> 06:54.092
That spot is very important

06:54.117 --> 06:56.680
because there Shri Vishnu appeared

06:56.705 --> 07:00.081
and he killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.

07:00.106 --> 07:03.778
So out of all these
big animals, only the elephant was saved,

07:03.803 --> 07:08.203
and that’s why that place is called as Gajendramoksh.

07:08.322 --> 07:13.077
So there’s a big quarrel going on because
Valmiki had his ashrams in different places,

07:13.077 --> 07:15.742
where [was real of Valmiki’s things].

07:15.767 --> 07:19.499
But actually he lived here in this area

07:19.516 --> 07:22.636
on the other side of the Godavari River

07:22.661 --> 07:30.089
which was going along the

07:30.336 --> 07:35.282
Paithan or the Pratishthan, the kingdom of Shalivana.

07:35.576 --> 07:40.894
And he used to plunder people and he was a plunderer.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.245
He was a fisherman and he was a plunderer.

07:45.016 --> 07:48.942
Then from there they say Narada came as a
saint from there,

07:48.967 --> 07:53.629
from the other side, and they plundered him also.

07:53.654 --> 07:57.371
So he said ,“Why are you plundering me?” Narada asked.

07:57.396 --> 08:01.625
He said, “Because I have to feed my children.
I have to feed my wife.

08:01.650 --> 08:04.457
I have to feed my family. I have to look after them.

08:04.482 --> 08:07.731
I have a large family. So how am I to maintain all that?

08:07.756 --> 08:10.688
I am the only person who is the earning member. “

08:10.713 --> 08:13.988
But he said, “Do you think
they will sacrifice everything for you?”

08:14.013 --> 08:16.876
He said, “I am sure they will.”
He said, “All right."

08:16.901 --> 08:20.416
Now you become like a dead man.”

08:20.441 --> 08:24.363
And they took his dead body, so-called, four of them,

08:24.372 --> 08:27.506
four saints, and put it in the house

08:27.531 --> 08:32.404
and told them that this fellow died in plundering us.

08:32.452 --> 08:37.264
“But there is a way to again bring him to life,

08:37.289 --> 08:41.729
that you have to promise that somebody from you,

08:41.754 --> 08:45.534
you all, have to die in his place.

08:45.559 --> 08:52.559
If you agree that you will die in his place,
then one person has to replace him.”

08:54.231 --> 08:56.904
They tried and tried.

08:56.929 --> 09:00.383
And somebody said, “No, I cannot die. I am too young.”

09:00.408 --> 09:03.283
Another said,“No, I have to look after my children.”

09:03.308 --> 09:08.189
Another said, “What will happen to my grandchildren?”
all kinds of things.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.571
And nobody offered themselves.

09:11.596 --> 09:16.317
So Valmiki got up and he realised that so far

09:16.341 --> 09:20.216
he has been really doing something wrong.

09:20.362 --> 09:24.402
So he said then, “What should I say?”

09:24.427 --> 09:26.876
He said, “What would you say then if you
die?”

09:26.901 --> 09:29.545
He said, “I’ll say, ‘Mara, mara’,” means,

09:29.569 --> 09:31.610
‘I am dead. I am dead. I am dead’.”

09:31.635 --> 09:33.190
He said, “All right, say the other way.

09:33.215 --> 09:36.949
Go on saying.” So it came to,
“Rama, Rama,” like that.

09:36.974 --> 09:38.887
But they said, “It won’t work out.

09:38.896 --> 09:40.892
You have to do a penance

09:40.917 --> 09:44.225
because you have done lots of bad things in your life

09:44.250 --> 09:46.738
and you have hurt many people.

09:46.774 --> 09:50.262
So you have to do the penance.”

09:50.616 --> 09:56.954
So he sat down for penance on a big mountain here

09:56.992 --> 09:59.321
which is called as the Valmiki Mountain.

10:00.624 --> 10:03.510
And the termites ate up his body,

10:03.560 --> 10:05.607
and he became like a termite.

10:05.623 --> 10:07.878
Only his neck was up and he was saying that

10:07.903 --> 10:11.145
and the whole body was eaten up by termites.

10:11.170 --> 10:14.471
So then again Shri Vishnu appeared before him

10:14.496 --> 10:18.716
and removed his termites and gave him his realisation.

10:18.749 --> 10:23.156
And a termite in Sanskrit language is called as valmi.

10:23.181 --> 10:25.796
That’s why he was called as valmi ki. That’s why

10:25.821 --> 10:28.114
he was called as Valmiki.

10:28.139 --> 10:35.844
So the story then afterwards leads
to the coming of Sita there.

10:35.945 --> 10:40.396
So it is a very important part of Ramayana was played here,

10:40.421 --> 10:44.362
and it is said that Shalivahanas helped

10:44.387 --> 10:50.139
this Valmiki temple and Valmiki person to prosper,

10:50.164 --> 10:54.760
and they treated him with great respect as their master.

10:54.785 --> 10:58.765
But actually, their master was long
time back was one Chandalia

10:58.790 --> 11:03.372
where we have taken the land near Nira River.

11:03.389 --> 11:07.871
So it’s a very ancient time thousands of years back

11:07.896 --> 11:13.000
because Rama must have lived before Krishna,
say about eight thousand years back.

11:13.025 --> 11:17.691
So it is a very ancient place, this one is.

11:17.716 --> 11:20.672
After that people removed all the trees and all that.

11:20.697 --> 11:23.148
So it has become such a barren land

11:23.173 --> 11:30.974
and it is not sort of so fertile now,

11:30.999 --> 11:35.189
but once upon a time it was a beautiful forest here

11:35.214 --> 11:39.786
and in that forest Valmiki used to live.

11:39.811 --> 11:42.174
So this is the story of this place, I hope

11:42.199 --> 11:46.442
you will be happy to know you are in a very
historical place just now.

11:46.467 --> 11:49.758
And I am trying to find out if you can on your way go to

11:49.783 --> 11:53.006
also to this Paithan, Pratishthan

11:53.030 --> 11:55.014
on your way, maybe. I don’t know how,

11:55.039 --> 11:57.306
because we are all running short of time

11:57.331 --> 12:00.355
because of aeroplane timings, as you know.

12:00.372 --> 12:04.140
But in any case I am very happy
that also Italians have arrived,

12:04.165 --> 12:07.089
and they have taken so much trouble to come all the way

12:07.114 --> 12:10.142
directly from there to get to the puja.

12:10.151 --> 12:15.030
Though I had arranged in Pratishthan
all their food, everything, breakfast,

12:15.055 --> 12:18.104
so they could sleep in the night and early in the morning

12:18.129 --> 12:21.518
take the food and come here.

12:22.695 --> 12:25.099
All these stories these
people know very well.

12:25.124 --> 12:29.272
We all know everything about our country,
these ancient times,

12:29.297 --> 12:36.730
you see, grand, beautiful, and the
work of all these saints and all these

12:36.755 --> 12:45.033
seers has woven into the character of Maharashtran people.

12:45.058 --> 12:49.998
So you will find them that they have certain gifts

12:50.023 --> 12:54.935
already to protect themselves,
which has come because of the

12:54.960 --> 13:02.741
following of these saints and
the following of a realised soul.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.460
And the people are very God-fearing

13:05.485 --> 13:11.215
and they respect saints and
they also know who is a real saint mostly.

13:13.580 --> 13:17.607
I hope you all will understand that

13:17.631 --> 13:21.424
when we think of the comfort of our spirit,

13:21.454 --> 13:25.955
the whole life is sort of penetrated
with the light of the spirit,

13:25.980 --> 13:29.102
and we start changing our attitude towards life.

13:29.127 --> 13:33.988
Not only that, but also we have a kind of a

13:34.020 --> 13:38.542
tremendous confidence in our virtues
and we enjoy them.

13:38.920 --> 13:43.443
We do not indulge into any such thing.

13:43.476 --> 13:45.748
Though in a way we can say that the,

13:45.773 --> 13:51.466
in this culture there is not much of finesse,
not much of artificiality.

13:51.491 --> 13:54.911
They won’t say thank you a hundred times.
That is not done.

13:54.943 --> 13:56.522
They don’t say sorry.

13:56.547 --> 13:59.438
They won’t even fold their hands to normally,

13:59.463 --> 14:02.883
the women especially to men, and say namaskar.

14:02.908 --> 14:05.547
Only to God they fold their hands.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.952
So there are certain things, that

14:07.977 --> 14:10.663
all the time we go on shaking hands in the West.

14:10.688 --> 14:14.085
All the time we start bowing to everyone, saying sorry,

14:14.085 --> 14:15.833
thank you and all that.

14:15.846 --> 14:17.559
That you will find they don’t do,

14:17.584 --> 14:20.957
but at heart they are very simple people.

14:20.982 --> 14:25.870
They live among rocks; so they
have that rocky character.

14:25.895 --> 14:28.006
And I hope you will enjoy them.

14:28.031 --> 14:30.463
May God bless you.
