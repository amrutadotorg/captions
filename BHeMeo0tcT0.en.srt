1
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:09,156
All these years

2
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:19,075
I have been waiting for this day.

3
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:32,356
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

4
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:43,989
so is a very important turning point

5
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:57,908
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

6
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,398
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

7
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:11,519
And so now is a new change has to come

8
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:16,857
and you can see the announcement.

9
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:35,225
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

10
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:44,640
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

11
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:49,789
We are collectively conscious.

12
00:04:49,990 --> 00:05:01,610
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

13
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:10,144
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

14
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:18,914
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

15
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:29,952
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

16
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:36,316
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

17
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:43,085
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

18
00:05:55,549 --> 00:06:01,842
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

19
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:05,850
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

20
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:12,323
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

21
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:26,204
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

22
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:32,834
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

23
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:36,840
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

24
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:42,969
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

25
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,361
All the time they are helping you.

26
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:49,430
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

27
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:53,721
they are using them at the right time.

28
00:06:53,922 --> 00:07:02,524
 Now be confident that you have powers.

29
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:14,536
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

30
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:19,464
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

31
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:25,359
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

32
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:34,879
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

33
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:42,576
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

34
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:47,175
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

35
00:07:47,376 --> 00:07:52,069
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

36
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,742
and the new character is announcement.

37
00:07:55,956 --> 00:08:03,242
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

38
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:09,209
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

39
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:12,728
Now you have to all start talking about it,

40
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:16,493
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

41
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:22,612
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

42
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:30,316
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

43
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:34,342
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

44
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:39,548
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

45
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:44,844
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

46
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:48,800
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

47
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:52,930
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

48
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:59,642
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

49
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:06,058
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

50
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:12,919
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

51
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:18,413
and very different type of people.

52
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:25,682
Now that assumption has to be there.

53
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:33,331
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

54
00:09:33,512 --> 00:09:38,966
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

55
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:45,180
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

56
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:48,772
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

57
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:56,103
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

58
00:09:56,305 --> 00:10:00,577
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

59
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:07,340
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

60
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:12,607
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

61
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:27,128
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

62
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:29,423
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

63
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:32,521
now leave them in the water.”

64
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:33,917
His attention was here and there,

65
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:38,100
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

66
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:41,730
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

67
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:46,321
and lasted for five days more after that.

68
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:49,852
Then he was convinced.

69
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:59,550
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

70
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:03,944
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

71
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:07,798
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

72
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:13,097
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

73
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:17,554
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

74
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:23,530
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

75
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:28,709
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

76
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:36,316
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

77
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,264
for your countries and for the whole world.

78
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:44,891
Now, assume your powers.

79
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:50,998
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

80
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:55,880
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

81
00:11:56,081 --> 00:12:02,478
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

82
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:07,839
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

83
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,250
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

84
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:15,414
Now you have to count your powers:

85
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:21,046
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

86
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:24,945
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

87
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:30,333
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

88
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:33,236
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

89
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:37,281
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

90
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:41,001
and how you are going to work out.

91
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:48,786
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

92
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:54,380
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

93
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:58,668
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

94
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:03,900
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

95
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:07,131
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

96
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:11,302
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

97
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:14,948
that I have put many a times before
you people,

98
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,995
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

99
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,791
Now don’t have diffidence.

100
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:25,666
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

101
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:30,076
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

102
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,625
This work is not going to be done
by special people

103
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:36,576
because they are suffering from ego.

104
00:13:36,777 --> 00:13:40,341
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

105
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:47,255
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

106
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:51,577
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

107
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:56,183
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

108
00:13:56,384 --> 00:14:07,742
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

109
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:11,510
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

110
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,288
any animal you could think of.

111
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:20,162
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

112
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:27,305
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

113
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:34,249
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

114
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,541
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

115
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:42,494
So many letters of confessions come to me,

116
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:46,608
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

117
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:50,112
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

118
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:54,363
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

119
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:57,725
I am a Maha Yogi.”

120
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,672
This is the confession you have to make.

121
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:05,929
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

122
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,888
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

123
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,472
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

124
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:18,611
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

125
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:24,087
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

126
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:31,291
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

127
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:41,233
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

128
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:44,520
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

129
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,746
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

130
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,532
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

131
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,809
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

132
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,627
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

133
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:59,693
running after something that is a mirage

134
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:04,015
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

135
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:06,924
We have to openly say it, this thing.

136
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,809
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

137
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,599
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

138
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,585
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

139
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:20,582
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

140
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:26,161
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

141
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:29,074
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

142
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:32,319
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

143
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,266
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

144
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:47,275
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

145
00:16:47,476 --> 00:16:50,584
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

146
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:55,286
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

147
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:59,798
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

148
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:05,634
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

149
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:10,791
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

150
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:16,982
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

151
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:20,074
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

152
00:17:20,275 --> 00:17:26,048
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

153
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:29,034
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

154
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:33,777
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

155
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:38,734
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

156
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:42,290
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

157
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:45,265
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

158
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:49,646
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

159
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:55,356
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

160
00:17:55,557 --> 00:18:01,625
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

161
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:07,463
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

162
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:12,219
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

163
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:18,375
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

164
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:22,844
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

165
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:28,146
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

166
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:32,646
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

167
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:36,066
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

168
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,285
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

169
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:40,939
for every small little nonsensical things.

170
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,157
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

171
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,380
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

172
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:48,929
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

173
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,500
they are not going to come out.”

174
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:56,077
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

175
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:59,353
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

176
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:02,439
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

177
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,722
You are not entangled with anyone.

178
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:07,733
You are not any way attached to anyone.

179
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:11,680
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

180
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:15,104
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

181
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:18,078
your country and ultimately the world.

182
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:26,426
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

183
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:29,771
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

184
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:33,106
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

185
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:36,026
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

186
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:41,655
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

187
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:47,178
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

188
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:49,674
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

189
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,845
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

190
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,347
But there is all knowledge within you.

191
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:59,810
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

192
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:02,943
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

193
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:06,894
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

194
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:11,265
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

195
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:15,739
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

196
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:20,804
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

197
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:25,058
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

198
00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:28,619
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

199
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,076
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

200
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:35,078
But these are very, very mundane things

201
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,529
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

202
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,236
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

203
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:45,702
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

204
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:48,258
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

205
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:51,730
whether you are a child or a grown up.

206
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:55,945
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

207
00:20:56,146 --> 00:21:00,858
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

208
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,937
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

209
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,853
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

210
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:10,512
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

211
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:15,440
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

212
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,781
is a commitment and complete involvement.

213
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:22,460
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

214
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:25,342
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

215
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:28,848
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

216
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:32,818
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

217
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,927
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

218
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,421
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

219
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:42,721
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

220
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:46,080
The whole attention should be on that.

221
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:50,905
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

222
00:21:51,106 --> 00:21:55,909
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

223
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,753
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

224
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:04,824
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

225
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:08,130
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

226
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:11,990
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

227
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:17,599
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

228
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,595
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

229
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:25,529
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

230
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,179
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

231
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,376
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

232
00:22:31,577 --> 00:22:36,082
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

233
00:22:36,283 --> 00:22:39,567
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

234
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:44,382
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

235
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:53,376
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

236
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:57,524
because attention which was involved
into negative things

237
00:22:57,725 --> 00:23:03,021
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

238
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:07,446
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

239
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:10,617
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

240
00:23:10,818 --> 00:23:13,197
then we should think that you are still
backdated

241
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:20,335
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

242
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:24,908
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

243
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:31,931
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

244
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:36,877
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

245
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:42,213
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

246
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:49,944
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

247
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,711
You just experiment and see for yourself.

248
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:55,563
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

249
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:58,622
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

250
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:02,229
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

251
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,424
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

252
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,709
Now those days are gone!

253
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,708
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

254
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:20,407
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

255
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:31,933
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

256
00:24:32,134 --> 00:24:34,944
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:38,257
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

258
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,801
You can eat the way you want to eat.

259
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:46,029
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

260
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:55,100
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

261
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:58,960
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

262
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:03,897
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

263
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:07,375
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

264
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:12,071
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

265
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:18,513
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

266
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:22,143
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

267
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:26,291
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

268
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:30,772
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

269
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:33,223
and we have to work it out that way.

270
00:25:33,424 --> 00:25:36,207
Today we have here people from all over
the world

271
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:39,528
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

272
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:43,666
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

273
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:48,947
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

274
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:56,649
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

275
00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:00,889
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

276
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,068
May God bless you all.

277
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,426
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

278
00:26:19,627 --> 00:26:22,072
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

279
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:24,690
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

280
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:28,196
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

281
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:33,487
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

282
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:37,866
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

283
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:42,327
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

284
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:48,111
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

285
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:53,511
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

286
00:26:53,712 --> 00:27:01,039
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

287
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:07,556
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

288
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:14,045
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

289
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,866
But only thing what you need is a courage

290
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:24,988
and a complete commitment to go forward

291
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:32,424
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
