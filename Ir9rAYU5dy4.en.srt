1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,760
So yesterday was a nice day for all of us, and I said something

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,480
of a different level.

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,360
We've been talking all the time

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,080
about the mundane things

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,800
and these things sometimes are very ...

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,000
are of so much importance, we think.

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,760
But when I talked to you yesterday,

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,000
I hope you all realized

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,280
that we have to now jump into

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,280
another realm of a subtler understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,480
First we are worried about

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,880
our families, our children,

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,200
our households;

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,680
then, our marriages.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,360
One after another all these questions came up,

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,200
and we were concerned about all these things;

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,000
little, little things.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,360
Then we also got concerned about the ashrams

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,920
which we were running:

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,000
the problems of the ashram,

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,640
what we have been doing,

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,400
how we have been facing the problems,

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,880
how people are creating problems.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,200
That's how our humanity started

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,400
acquiring a subtler understanding.

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,000
And then we also realized that

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
we are blessed by God,

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,160
that there's something great

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,640
that is always looking after us,

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,800
some higher Force,

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,160
some special Attention is there about us.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,880
This is what we realized.

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,400
Today I was explaining how it happens,

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,640
that how we realize

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,880
that God is helping us too.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,840
Any problem is an effect of some sort of a cause

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,320
- every problem.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,720
Like Mona wrote a letter that she was driving

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,040
in a motorway

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,480
and the car went out of control,

41
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,320
and the brake would not act.

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,080
And there was a car coming from the right,

43
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,720
car coming from the left,

44
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,680
cars going through in front and behind.

45
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,120
And she felt that they'll be finished

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,440
- two of them were traveling, two Sahaja yoginis.

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,680
So the cause was the car or the brake or whatever it was,

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,240
the mechanism, and the effect was all the problem.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,320
So now, how to overcome that problem?

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Supposing you try to neutralize the effect, you cannot,

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,680
because cause is still there.

52
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,920
You try to improve the cause, it doesn't work out.

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
Then what to do?

54
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,120
So the easiest thing is to cross the cause,

55
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,720
to ascend over, to go beyond the cause;

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,800
so the cause does not exist for you,

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,960
so the effect does not exist for you.

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,560
As long as the cause exists in your attention,

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,680
the effect will be there.

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
So what did she do?

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,760
She just prayed to Me, just thought of Me that

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,680
"Mother, now it's my last chance" - that's all.

63
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,000
So the cause disappeared, because you go beyond it.

64
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,160
And the effect also disappeared, and she was surprised.

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,760
So you must ascend away from the cause.

66
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,760
Now a problem: "my wife is like this",

67
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,160
"my husband like this," "my family life is this,"

68
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,080
"Sahaja yogis are like this" - all kinds of things are there.

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,160
It's an effect. Now what's the cause?

70
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,360
- is such and such person.

71
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,960
All right, now what are we to get - relation of the cause.

72
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,880
Surrender it.

73
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,560
You are, you have the right to do that.

74
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,480
You have a knack to do it, you can do it.

75
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,880
You are capable of it, you are entitled to do it

76
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,640
- but you don't do it, you forget.

77
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,960
You just forget.

78
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,840
If you surrender that cause,

79
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,000
the effects will go away.

80
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,680
But that is the thing at that time to remember,

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,200
that you have to ascend.

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,880
To go beyond the cause is the best way to get rid of it.

83
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,360
So I've been playing with you.

84
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
You had causes to say,

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,000
"Oh Mother, this is the problem. I have no job."

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
Now I have a job, then the job is to be hard.

87
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,280
Then the wife is not there, so must have a wife.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,680
The wife has a problem, so she is to be divorced

89
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,800
- and that and that, and this is that.

90
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,280
Then, "I am like that.

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,160
I am very bad because there's a bhoot in me."

92
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,080
So the bhoot is the cause.

93
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,800
"And I am behaving like this because there's a bhoot in me."

94
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,400
That's also a scapegoat, I think.

95
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,200
So first you go beyond that, saying,

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,280
"What is bhoot? Who is bhoot?

97
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,040
I know my Mother.

98
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,080
And Mother, You look after this bhoot of mine" - that's all.

99
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,320
But for that an emergency has to come to you,

100
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,400
otherwise you just don't do it, with that power.

101
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,800
When you are in emergent condition,

102
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,920
then it works out faster.

103
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,640
When it is not emergency then it's half-hearted,

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,040
like Mona's condition.

105
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,360
There was another case where a

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,160
journalist was traveling from ...

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,040
or something and his brakes broke down,

108
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,960
and he was with another journalist,

109
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,000
so both of them were coming - this another journalist told me.

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,160
The another one was Sahaja yogi.

111
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,480
So he found his brakes are not working

112
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,840
and he found his car is going,

113
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,120
in front there is a big truck coming up

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
and another truck coming from behind.

115
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,960
And there was no way for him to turn or to get out of it,

116
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,760
and his brakes were horrid.

117
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,120
That was a emergency, you see.

118
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,440
Such an emergency that developed into his mind,

119
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,040
that "Oh God, now the last moment has come.

120
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,440
Now we're finished."

121
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,160
There is a truck coming from there and another truck,

122
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,720
and within a split of a second he was to be finished.

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,840
And he just told his friend, "Think of Mother" - that's all.

124
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,960
And what he found, that he was nicely crawling on the road

125
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,720
and the trucks were left behind, and the brake was working.

126
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,640
But that emergency has to come.

127
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,920
Human beings are such that unless and until

128
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,040
they are put into tight corners, they never do that.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,120
Once they are in a tight corner, then they do it.

130
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,840
That is the reason why people try to take ascetic life,

131
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,240
because if you are an ascetic then you are in a tight corner.

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,360
They go to Gobi Desert to create that emergency within you,

133
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,960
so that you think of God.

134
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,040
But that's too late to go to the Gobi Desert.

135
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,480
They create problems for them to get into tight corners,

136
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,080
so that they can get out of it.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,080
But for Sahaja yogis if they are wise, they need not have.

138
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,000
But how do we achieve it otherwise, without any ... ?

139
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,400
Only way is meditation.

140
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,080
Everybody must meditate, it's the point.

141
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,200
If you do not meditate, you can continue for a while.

142
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,400
You may be all right for a while

143
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,120
for two, three months, maybe two years,

144
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,880
but then you drop out.

145
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,600
Many people think, "Oh, what's the need to meditate?

146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,000
You see, it's all right.

147
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,200
If we don't meditate, doesn't matter." It's not so.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,920
Because in meditation only you grow.

149
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,200
In emergency you suddenly grow, no doubt.

150
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,800
I mean, you jump like a jack-in-the- box.

151
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,080
You just come up with a spring.

152
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,080
But if you have to have continuous growth

153
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,200
then you must meditate,

154
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,720
allow the thoughts after thoughts coming,

155
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
and then allow them to subside,

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,680
because you rise into the state of thoughtless awareness.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And in that thoughtless awareness you grow.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,280
And you grow in your detachment

159
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,920
to the cause of all the effects.

160
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,720
If there is no cause, there is no effect.

161
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
But this is the problem with us,

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,080
is that we do not meditate, normally.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,280
Only when it comes to absolute last point,

164
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,240
now you'll have to fall in the well - then we think of it.

165
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,120
Maybe at that moment you are helped,

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,080
but you don't grow.

167
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
Growth can only come if you meditate.

168
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,560
That is one very important part,

169
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:01,200
is complete help to people who meditate in the normal way.

170
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,000
In the normal life, how do we grow?

171
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,800
If we have no oxygen, we cannot grow.

172
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,320
We have to have sufficient oxygen,

173
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,120
we have to have sufficient food,

174
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,080
we have to have all these things.

175
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,680
But in spirituality you grow through meditation.

176
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
There's no way out.

177
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
Those who think they can grow are bumptious,

178
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,400
actually bumptious people,

179
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,440
because they can talk a lot about Sahaja Yoga.

180
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,000
I have seen people who talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,400
They can give big lectures, this, that,

182
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,080
but have no vibrations at all.

183
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,080
They can't do any work for Sahaja Yoga,

184
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,280
they are not collective,

185
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,680
they have no sense to be collective,

186
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,240
all kinds of problems.

187
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,000
But the growth is to be achieved through meditation.
