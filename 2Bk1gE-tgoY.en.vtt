00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:01.348
Sahaja Yoga

00:00:01.373 --> 00:00:05.602
It's founder is now in Turkey and speaking only with us.

00:00:05.627 --> 00:00:07.920
Who is she? Shri Mataji.

00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:11.285
Listen to what she is saying.

00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:19.476
All those watching me, if they have a desire,
 should open their hands like this.

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:25.729
Put your right hand on your heart and say inside,

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.161
"Mother, I am not this mind, this body, these feelings,

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:36.808
these conditionings".

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:39.700
I am the pure spirit.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.012
We are carrying a feeling  of guilt inside.

00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:53.466
But it is harmful to this center here.

00:00:53.517 --> 00:00:57.202
Now stretch your right hand towards Me like this.

00:00:57.227 --> 00:01:01.558
and put your left hand above your  head.

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:06.424
And see carefully if you feel a cool or a hot breeze

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:11.860
You can close your eyes if you like.

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:16.809
Now stretch your left hand towards Me.

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:20.993
and check with your right hand above your head.

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:25.573
Do you feel a cool or a hot breeze?

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:28.398
You can move your hand slowly up or down.

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:33.305
Now raise your both hands.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.495
And ask one of these questions from your heart.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.895
Mother, is what I have felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:49.174
Or Mother, is this the Spirit?

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:55.867
Or Mother, is this the all pervading power of Divine Love?

00:01:55.892 --> 00:01:59.464
Now look at Me but don't think.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.842
And you will feel a cool or a hot breeze on your hands.

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:09.867
also  you can feel it above your fontanel bone area.

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:16.546
This is the moment when your spirit starts to grow.

00:02:19.943 --> 00:02:22.831
How Long you will stay  in Turkey

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:24.823
I'm going on Monday

00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:32.734
Did you like Turkey.

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:33.937
Of course

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.099
very much.

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:44.654
In very short time we are waiting you again in Turkey

00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:48.160
Ohh, I think, next time I will came for a long time.

00:02:50.688 --> 00:02:55.194
That those were felt the  cool breeze should write the letter

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.107
for should inform them it will be a good idea

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:20.477
But it is spring time now, there is no one 
who does not fee a breeze above one's head.

00:03:20.541 --> 00:03:26.763
In generally, people in the world are not happy
 with their life and with themselves.

00:03:26.818 --> 00:03:30.684
Everything they want happens
they earn money

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.110
but however still somehow people do not become happy

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:35.295
they do not fee happy inside.

00:03:35.328 --> 00:03:39.236
As it was said in the Koran, Mirage has to take place.

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.516
The ascend has to be

00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:47.559
and a transformation has  to give

00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:56.031
Prophet Mohammed has said,
you will feel your spirit on your fingertips.

00:03:56.056 --> 00:04:00.123
and you will know yourself 
 you will face yourself.

00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:02.342
This reality you should know.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.997
Christ never went to any  university

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:18.975
Some people , for example Christ never went to any univertsity.

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.973
Mohammed did not to even know how to read and write.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.292
When you are standing in the water 
you may be afraid of the waves.

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:30.308
But you are standing in a boat

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:34.532
you will watch the waves and enjoy them.

00:04:34.582 --> 00:04:37.821
But if you can swim, you are not afraid of the water.

00:04:37.846 --> 00:04:41.326
you can jump into the water and save people there.

00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.077
As Shri Mataji loves people, she also likes flowers.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.785
Is there any special flower She identifies Herself with?

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:50.674
My name  is also daisy

00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:54.571
margarita

00:04:59.283 --> 00:05:02.147
thank you very much, thank you.

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:05.174
Beautiful.

00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:06.928
It is the eye of  Shri Fatima

00:05:06.953 --> 00:05:08.428
I know, I know.
