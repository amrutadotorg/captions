00:27:35.929 --> 00:27:39.839
I have been telling them that

00:27:40.403 --> 00:27:44.496
the style of Indian knowledge

00:27:44.521 --> 00:27:47.749
is very different from the Western mind.

00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:51.720
In the West, you see, if you say something,

00:27:51.745 --> 00:27:56.661
then they want to have an experimental approval.

00:27:56.878 --> 00:28:02.972
They will go to the scientists or to other
people who are equipped

00:28:02.997 --> 00:28:08.120
with knowledge to know what they said
in these books is true or not.

00:28:08.145 --> 00:28:09.917
They will even judge Christ.

00:28:09.942 --> 00:28:13.513
They would even judge Moses.

00:28:13.538 --> 00:28:15.290
They would judge everybody

00:28:15.315 --> 00:28:20.340
as if they are the most intelligent
and the most capable people.

00:28:21.236 --> 00:28:24.687
And they write books after books against them

00:28:25.672 --> 00:28:31.489
disclosing as if they are those people
who have said something,

00:28:31.514 --> 00:28:35.120
have said out of their
minds or something.

00:28:35.932 --> 00:28:40.337
It is never accepted normally

00:28:40.401 --> 00:28:44.578
and if it is accepted they become absolutely fanatics.

00:28:44.603 --> 00:28:51.326
So, now according to Indian style of

00:28:51.874 --> 00:28:57.480
understanding is that first of all if a great Rishi

00:28:57.505 --> 00:28:59.914
or great Muni or a great...

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.601
you can call a saint has
said something,

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:09.921
then he has said it, while you have to just listen to that

00:29:11.254 --> 00:29:14.031
because you are not equally the same.

00:29:14.056 --> 00:29:20.401
Whatever he has said is his own experience,
his own knowledge

00:29:20.693 --> 00:29:24.764
and you have no business to judge him or to say

00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:29.166
this is not true, that is not true.

00:29:29.997 --> 00:29:32.259
You accept it

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:37.435
and once you get your self-realization,
it is clearly written down

00:29:38.062 --> 00:29:41.336
after self-realization,
you have to grow.

00:29:41.832 --> 00:29:47.976
Grow into perfect being and then you can see
for yourself

00:29:48.001 --> 00:29:52.942
what he has said or they have said is the truth.

00:29:53.515 --> 00:29:56.032
So the approach is different.

00:29:56.219 --> 00:29:59.886
In one way if you start going through science,

00:29:59.974 --> 00:30:03.872
through this, through that, you cannot reach anywhere

00:30:03.897 --> 00:30:06.746
and moreover your growth is stunted.

00:30:07.035 --> 00:30:12.598
So, what you have to do is to go to this knowledge

00:30:13.108 --> 00:30:16.612
through believing in what they have said.

00:30:16.637 --> 00:30:19.637
Whatever Christ has said, you have to believe,

00:30:20.129 --> 00:30:23.176
whatever Mohammad has said, you have to believe,

00:30:23.569 --> 00:30:27.034
whatever Guru Nanak has said,
you have to believe,

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:31.536
whatever Gyandeva has said, you have to believe,

00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:33.898
Lao Tse you have to believe: like that.

00:30:33.923 --> 00:30:38.630
Because you are not of that spiritual level.

00:30:39.261 --> 00:30:40.832
So accept it.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:45.078
Now do not try to analyze it.
Everything you try to analyze

00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:48.200
and in that analysis you get lost.

00:30:48.935 --> 00:30:54.223
So once you are a realized soul of that level

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:59.477
and then you grow into your fullness

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.945
what we call sampurna --

00:31:02.295 --> 00:31:06.180
then only you will know whether whatever they have

00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:10.312
said is true or not and then you can find out.

00:31:10.745 --> 00:31:15.964
It is very easy, then, to know whatever is
said is true or not.

00:31:17.525 --> 00:31:23.311
For Sahaja Yogis now is very easy to find
out if something is real or unreal,

00:31:23.336 --> 00:31:27.711
if it is truth or untruth, it is love or hatred.

00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:30.625
Only through vibrations you can do.

00:31:31.319 --> 00:31:34.061
But going beyond that, I am saying,

00:31:35.061 --> 00:31:38.684
beyond that one has to know
what are these vibrations

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:43.111
and what are they made of.

00:31:57.479 --> 00:32:03.116
What is the subtle force which is
behind those vibrations.

00:32:03.783 --> 00:32:07.605
We call it Paramchaitanya, alright.
Paramchaitanya, so what.

00:32:08.304 --> 00:32:12.579
What happens to you when you get Paramchaitanya,

00:32:12.605 --> 00:32:16.008
is something to be understood, the subtleties.

00:32:16.596 --> 00:32:22.095
As I said, we are made of five elements, alright?

00:32:22.446 --> 00:32:25.902
So when you get your awakening,
when the Kundalini reaches

00:32:25.927 --> 00:32:29.517
Sahasrara and opens out your fontanel bone area,

00:32:29.542 --> 00:32:37.807
you become one with the Divine power,
then this Divine power itself starts flowing through you.

00:32:38.676 --> 00:32:41.245
A connection is established.

00:32:41.765 --> 00:32:47.620
Now when it starts flowing through you, this
Shakti starts flowing through you,

00:32:48.938 --> 00:32:51.386
then what happens?

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.782
The subtle part we should understand.

00:32:56.025 --> 00:33:02.788
The subtle part is like this, that these five
elements, we are made of,

00:33:02.883 --> 00:33:07.421
these vibrations gradually start breaking into

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:11.683
the subtler form of which they are made.

00:33:12.101 --> 00:33:17.698
So the first thing such a person has
is the breaks, you see,

00:33:17.723 --> 00:33:22.142
as it is said that "Word is God."

00:33:23.015 --> 00:33:26.183
It's said also in the Bible, "The Word is God."

00:33:26.208 --> 00:33:28.256
Now what is this Word?

00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:36.878
Word is a silent, we can say, silent commandment.

00:33:37.076 --> 00:33:39.045
We can call it like that.

00:33:39.207 --> 00:33:43.719
But from that Word comes,
according to Indian Philosophy,

00:33:43.767 --> 00:33:47.830
is another thing that we call as "Bindu"...

00:33:52.915 --> 00:33:57.491
or we can say if Word becomes
Naad, is a sound...

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:06.843
and then it becomes the Bindu means
one small dot, you can see

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.979
and then from this dot...

00:34:10.209 --> 00:34:15.595
you see, all these five elements
start coming one after another.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:21.879
The first element that comes out is light...

00:34:23.379 --> 00:34:29.202
"Tej" light ... is the first element that comes out.

00:34:29.578 --> 00:34:34.591
So the essence of the first element is light.

00:34:37.258 --> 00:34:40.335
We call it Tej, Tejas.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.697
It is written, of course, in Sanskrit but we should understand

00:34:45.087 --> 00:34:50.488
that how the light pervades Sahaja Yoga so much

00:34:50.615 --> 00:34:53.713
and you see the light everywhere.

00:34:53.841 --> 00:34:58.904
So the first element which is light

00:34:58.985 --> 00:35:08.055
and you can say in English the light's subtle thing

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:15.348
is, we can say, "enlightenment", you can say.

00:35:15.663 --> 00:35:22.067
But enlightenment has another meaning, so
we can say it is Tej, Tej.

00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:27.036
For example a person who gets realization has a face

00:35:27.061 --> 00:35:31.372
which is very radiant, so you can say the "radiance".

00:35:31.397 --> 00:35:37.007
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

00:35:37.077 --> 00:35:40.931
So this radiance starts showing on your face.

00:35:41.042 --> 00:35:44.572
Radiance starts expressing itself

00:35:44.604 --> 00:35:50.410
and with that radiance people get impressed

00:35:50.435 --> 00:35:56.889
and they start thinking something special about
this personality which has a radiance.

00:35:56.914 --> 00:36:01.034
Now you have seen my photographs also wherever they are,

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:04.423
many a times you find lots of light around.

00:36:04.448 --> 00:36:12.772
That is nothing but the light in me is giving radiance

00:36:12.809 --> 00:36:15.499
because the light becomes subtler.

00:36:15.784 --> 00:36:19.195
When the light becomes subtle in me, -- light,

00:36:19.267 --> 00:36:24.292
light is one of the elements -- when it becomes subtler

00:36:24.317 --> 00:36:33.853
then it gives radiance and so this is the
subtle growth within you that takes place.

00:36:34.023 --> 00:36:36.818
Your faces also start shining.

00:36:36.843 --> 00:36:45.819
They too have radiance and they too have a
kind of a different complexion, I would say.

00:36:46.429 --> 00:36:54.035
This radiance is to be understood, is the subtle of the light

00:36:54.365 --> 00:36:58.780
of which we are made, light in the gross manner.

00:36:59.549 --> 00:37:05.477
Then after this from the light comes the second thing,

00:37:05.502 --> 00:37:10.892
which we call as Vayu in Sanskrit, meaning the air.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.909
So the air that we have which is gross air,

00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:20.862
what is subtle of air is the "cool breeze" that you get.

00:37:20.926 --> 00:37:25.419
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

00:37:25.503 --> 00:37:32.863
So the subtle of what you understand as cool breeze is

00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:38.796
what we call vibrations, the subtle of that is air;

00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:42.770
which is a part and parcel of our making.

00:37:42.876 --> 00:37:50.919
So this cool breeze is the second thing that
you start getting subtler and subtler.

00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:57.616
When your growth takes place, all these subtle
things start expressing themselves.

00:37:57.641 --> 00:38:02.203
It is not only that you get vibrations
but you get the cool breeze

00:38:02.228 --> 00:38:07.291
and that is the subtler of air that has built you up.

00:38:10.292 --> 00:38:13.148
Then comes the Water.

00:38:13.703 --> 00:38:16.159
We are also made of water.

00:38:16.276 --> 00:38:21.306
What is the subtle of water is...

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.739
sometimes English language,
you know, becomes little short of...

00:38:29.764 --> 00:38:34.897
especially but they call it...

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:41.464
I mean which makes the skin, hard skin soft.

00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:45.427
The skin becomes soft.

00:38:47.046 --> 00:38:54.050
This is another sign of a realized soul that his...

00:38:55.884 --> 00:39:00.310
there is some cream they use, isn't it, to soften the face.

00:39:00.967 --> 00:39:11.027
But this is the water in us, gives us that
luster, that nourishment to make our skin

00:39:11.396 --> 00:39:16.137
very soft and that softness
of the skin becomes very visible.

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:19.460
This is the minimum of minimum, I would say.

00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:28.162
But then a person who is a realized soul becomes
very soft person, very delicate.

00:39:28.187 --> 00:39:39.120
When he talks to some body, in his voice there
is warmth or I should say there is...

00:39:39.145 --> 00:39:50.610
[Mother speeks Hindi]... to have that flow,
watery flow and coolness of the water.

00:39:50.761 --> 00:39:57.871
So that is the another subtle thing that should
be expressed in your behavior, on your skin,

00:39:58.166 --> 00:40:06.117
on your dealings with others, that you should
be like the water, which is mobile,

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:12.365
which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

00:40:12.442 --> 00:40:19.722
So this also becomes a part and parcel of
your being, once you become a realized soul.

00:40:20.573 --> 00:40:27.334
With this water you have also another thing
which we call it as Agni, means the fire.

00:40:27.726 --> 00:40:32.186
So you also have fire but it is a very silent fire.

00:40:32.211 --> 00:40:37.201
It does not burn anybody but it burns all
the wrong things within you.

00:40:37.226 --> 00:40:39.762
Whatever wrong things you have it burns

00:40:39.787 --> 00:40:42.837
and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

00:40:42.862 --> 00:40:47.272
For example, a person comes
with a great anger towards me.

00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:55.109
What happens that this anger becomes cooldown
with the fire that is there.

00:40:55.396 --> 00:41:00.371
Moreover, a realized soul cannot get burnt,

00:41:00.396 --> 00:41:06.313
fire cannot burn, the burning cannot come to him.

00:41:06.567 --> 00:41:08.958
It is very important to understand.

00:41:08.983 --> 00:41:13.209
Also if you are doing something wrong,

00:41:13.258 --> 00:41:17.936
it may burn you but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi

00:41:17.961 --> 00:41:23.131
and I should say, perfect Sahaja Yogi,
fire will never burn you.

00:41:23.593 --> 00:41:30.241
We have an example of Sita Ji that she went
into the fire Pariksha... nothing burnt.

00:41:30.498 --> 00:41:36.938
So this is what one has to understand, that
once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

00:41:37.088 --> 00:41:44.556
so the fire and the water both of them
become sort of Divine.

00:41:44.866 --> 00:41:48.852
For example, the water which you touch,

00:41:48.885 --> 00:41:54.781
water you drink, whatever you put
your hand in the water,

00:41:54.806 --> 00:41:56.949
the water becomes vibrated.

00:41:56.974 --> 00:41:57.974
Means What?

00:41:58.289 --> 00:42:02.691
The subtleties of the water comes in it, the coolness,

00:42:02.716 --> 00:42:07.280
curing power also comes in that water.

00:42:07.495 --> 00:42:11.986
So when it becomes subtler,
all these powers start showing

00:42:12.011 --> 00:42:16.291
which you can see for yourself.
You do not have to experiment.

00:42:18.585 --> 00:42:25.256
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth... is
most important... is Mother Earth.

00:42:25.817 --> 00:42:30.825
There is a photograph you might see which
was taken in Russia in My Dacha

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.975
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.916
They have shown clearly.

00:42:36.154 --> 00:42:40.794
It is there and it is the Mother Earth which shows.

00:42:41.056 --> 00:42:47.164
For example, I have seen flowers, if you keep
them in my room, they blossom.

00:42:47.189 --> 00:42:49.726
They can become very big like that,

00:42:49.751 --> 00:42:54.230
never people have seen such big flowers,
sometimes they say.

00:42:54.255 --> 00:42:55.428
I am doing nothing.

00:42:55.453 --> 00:42:58.031
I am just sitting down and
what happens to the flowers?

00:42:58.056 --> 00:43:03.589
You see now there this principle of
the Mother Earth works...

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:07.381
the subtle Mother Earth, is works, it's a mother.

00:43:07.532 --> 00:43:14.821
And that gives you all the nourishment and
makes you grow healthy,

00:43:15.038 --> 00:43:19.946
and this is how this subtlety works of the Mother Earth .

00:43:20.415 --> 00:43:26.143
Mother Earth is the one who is giver of virtue
to all these flowers

00:43:26.168 --> 00:43:31.382
and to all these trees and to all that,
but it also plays a big part in us.

00:43:31.407 --> 00:43:35.771
It is not only the Mother Earth that exists

00:43:35.796 --> 00:43:40.154
without our connection and we do not respect the Mother Earth.

00:43:40.179 --> 00:43:43.351
We have polluted it, we have done all kinds of things,

00:43:43.376 --> 00:43:48.776
we have removed the trees and we have made
a mess out of her, but she is our Mother

00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:52.414
and so many subtle things of this Mother Earth

00:43:52.439 --> 00:43:56.376
come into us. One of them is gravity.

00:43:56.689 --> 00:44:02.363
A person becomes very attractive, not in the physical sense

00:44:02.371 --> 00:44:05.339
but in the spiritual sense.

00:44:05.364 --> 00:44:08.404
Such a person attracts others.

00:44:08.726 --> 00:44:16.565
They feel attrackted and they feel that something
special is about this person.

00:44:16.864 --> 00:44:20.013
This is one of the qualities of the Mother Earth.

00:44:20.038 --> 00:44:25.861
If she had not kept us attracted we would
have fallen off with her movement

00:44:25.886 --> 00:44:30.066
and also other qualities of the Mother Earth also

00:44:30.091 --> 00:44:34.821
start manifesting within us, and we become very,

00:44:34.822 --> 00:44:42.324
I should say, extremely tolerant, patient... person.

00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:46.706
Tolerant and patient... extremely tolerant and patient.

00:44:46.731 --> 00:44:51.268
But if you are not tolerant, if you are hot
tempered and all that,

00:44:51.293 --> 00:44:54.945
then Mother Earth's principle is not expressed I should say.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:58.233
Look at the Mother Earth.
How much she tolerates our nonsense,

00:44:58.258 --> 00:45:03.590
how many wrong things we do against her,
but still she tolerates.

00:45:03.615 --> 00:45:07.309
Sri Ganesha's quality is to tolerate, to begin with.

00:45:07.334 --> 00:45:10.923
Up to a point, he tolerates.
In the same way,

00:45:10.948 --> 00:45:16.699
we too become extremely tolerant,
patient and forgiving.

00:45:17.104 --> 00:45:22.665
This is the minimum of minimum that should
happen to all the Sahajayogis who have vibrations,

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:27.900
because now I have told you all the things
that are expressed in your vibrations.

00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:34.861
It is a thing to be understood that what you
have become now is something very great,

00:45:35.245 --> 00:45:42.352
it has not happened to others, it has not happened
to somebody who is not being a Sahaja Yogi.

00:45:42.377 --> 00:45:48.586
You see the people who go to Church or to
Mosques or to Temple, see their faces.

00:45:49.337 --> 00:45:51.616
Look at them, how do they look like?

00:45:51.641 --> 00:45:55.279
They haven't got anything from the Temple,
they haven't got anything

00:45:55.304 --> 00:46:02.855
from the Mosque, they haven't got anything from
any one of these places where they go to worship.

00:46:02.996 --> 00:46:05.029
So, that is artificial.

00:46:05.054 --> 00:46:12.341
That has become something, I should say, without
any connection with the reality.

00:46:12.366 --> 00:46:18.841
Only after realization you are connected with
reality and you can get

00:46:18.866 --> 00:46:25.763
the understanding of all these
subtleties working through you.

00:46:25.788 --> 00:46:31.111
Why I am telling you this, because I want
you to know and recognize yourself,

00:46:31.136 --> 00:46:34.392
to understand what you are, what you have got.

00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:40.011
Once you recognize yourself and understand
yourself you can do a lot.

00:46:40.036 --> 00:46:47.660
First of all to say that I am a Sahaja Yogi
itself it should be very much with self confidence

00:46:47.685 --> 00:46:52.482
and as a self confident person should find
out what have I done as Sahaja Yogi?

00:46:52.507 --> 00:46:54.215
What can I do as Sahaja Yogi?

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.760
Some Sahaja Yogis have done wonders.

00:46:56.785 --> 00:47:03.118
They have done such a lot of work of Sahaja Yoga,
while some Sahaja Yogis are still writing to me

00:47:03.143 --> 00:47:09.816
that "my husband is fighting with me,
my son is like this, my mother like this";

00:47:09.816 --> 00:47:14.243
all the time, you see, letters after letters
come to me.

00:47:14.268 --> 00:47:16.903
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:21.733
Now you just see to your subtleties, work it out.

00:47:21.767 --> 00:47:26.175
They think I am here to solve their problems,
their family problems,

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:30.222
and their jobs and things.
I am not here for that.

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:33.247
I am here to give you self-realization

00:47:33.272 --> 00:47:39.360
and the understanding that whatever you have got,
you must accept as a challenge,

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.889
take it up as a challenge and you will be amazed,
how you will be helped

00:47:43.914 --> 00:47:46.250
and how you will get the results!

00:47:46.275 --> 00:47:51.383
"Sahaja" does not mean only
that you get spontaneous realization.

00:47:51.408 --> 00:47:54.052
It also means that you get spontaneity.

00:47:54.077 --> 00:47:56.396
The whole nature gets spontaneity.

00:47:56.421 --> 00:48:00.147
All these subtle things that I have told you,
they also get spontaneous

00:48:00.172 --> 00:48:02.025
and they work it out.

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:06.698
Of course, there are Angels and there are
Ganas who are helping you

00:48:06.723 --> 00:48:09.390
but you need not worry about them just now.

00:48:09.415 --> 00:48:13.606
Main thing is you must realize what you are,
what have you got

00:48:13.631 --> 00:48:18.725
and how much you have faced it,
you have got it and how it has worked?

00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:26.196
I have seen every time I just have a little
problem of something, immediately it works.

00:48:27.509 --> 00:48:34.661
It works in such quarters and such people
that I never expected.

00:48:34.686 --> 00:48:36.550
Just  comes in.

00:48:36.575 --> 00:48:38.434
Everything works out.

00:48:38.631 --> 00:48:44.452
But whatever works out is for your good,
is for your growth,

00:48:44.477 --> 00:48:47.977
for your understanding that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:48:48.002 --> 00:48:53.201
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,
but this you have to develop.

00:48:53.210 --> 00:49:00.140
Also, introspection can tell you that are
you working out all those things or not?

00:49:00.165 --> 00:49:06.752
If you take to introspection, you will be
surprised to see, yes, you have these powers

00:49:06.868 --> 00:49:09.153
and you can do wonders.

00:49:09.217 --> 00:49:14.637
So I bless you all, please develop those subtle
things within you.

00:49:14.661 --> 00:49:17.408
They are already there; you do not
have to do anything.

00:49:17.433 --> 00:49:19.603
Only understand and locate.

00:49:19.628 --> 00:49:23.008
Thank you very much.
