00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.490
Shri Mataji: You must put some heated butter
in the nose, all of you.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.020
Sahaja Yogi: Inside?

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.300
Shri Mataji: Inside, with a dropper, alright?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.230
Heat butter and fill it up.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.640
And then, when it is slightly warm, not very
warm, absolutely slightly warm, then put it

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.740
in your nose, very important, because the-
I don’t know in this country, people, it’s

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.750
a very simple thing to be done once in a while,
about say two or three days later or even

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.600
every day you do, doesn’t matter.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.230
It’s like putting cream on your hands, you
see, because the cold weather also chaps inside

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.060
the lining of the nose.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:54.380
And when you put this, it makes the nose smooth
and you don’t get troubles of it.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.500
It’s very simple.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.359
All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.480
There are so many things that a Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do, one of them is this, that

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.610
try to keep you Hamsa Chakra alright.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.470
By keeping your nose alright you are keeping
your Hamsa Chakra better.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.670
So better use this simple method of heating
some ghee, we call it.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.200
You see, you can prepare it, heat the butter,
keep it in a bottle with a dropper, and heat

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.380
it in the hot water and then put it in the
nose, just like that, in the night, before

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.380
sleeping.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.740
Even in the ears, we must put olive oil.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.460
It’s very important.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.390
For the teeth also, you must take some salt,
put some olive oil and rub your gums.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.649
With that, you won’t have to go to the dentist
anymore.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.854
That’s the best, I’ve never been to a
dentist all my life, and I don’t want you

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:51.380
to go to the dentist anymore.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.680
So that’s a very good way of rubbing your
gums with vibrated salt and what you call

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.880
the olive oil.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.170
Also you must oil your heads, every Saturday,
with so much of oil, nicely, oil it, massage

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.510
your head and sleep off and next day, wash
up your hair.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.290
You’ll feel very much better.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.020
If any of you cannot give olive oil the best
is almond oil for the head.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.670
You’ll keep very peaceful.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.840
Specially your children, you must massage
them till they’re five years of age, every

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.060
night, when they go out to sleep in the night,
nicely very- before sleeping.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.590
And then put some powder, clean it out, let
them sleep.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.610
Then the children won’t be running and upset
and all that.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.420
They’ll become very quiet children, well-behaved
children.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.030
Because you people don’t massage the children,
all their lives they are jumping.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.250
And all their lives they are slightly violent,
you see, the nose must be smooth out.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.989
It’s a very simple method and as you are
Realised people you’ll smooth them much

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:51.989
more.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.393
All these small, small things must be taken
care of, you see.

00:02:54.393 --> 00:03:00.590
Now if you have too much of cold, if you have
too much of cold, then you can mix up with

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.879
a bit of camphor, with oil, and put that in
the nose, little actually, not much, that

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.100
also is very good, that also smooth your cold
and puts you right.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.450
This country has one big problem with Vishuddhi
chakra everywhere in the West, because of

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.450
the cold.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.769
And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory that you
must wear an undershirt.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.490
It is compulsory.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.300
Whatever may be, it is hot, cold, in India
when it’s steaming hot, you must wear an

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.750
undershirt, because, when it is very hot you
start perspiring and that perspiration causes

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.750
problems.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.000
So, always wear an undershirt, whether you
are in a hot season or in a cold season.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.299
That’s a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis that
they must wear.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.040
And for all of them, also is compulsory that
they should always wear a muffler when they

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.849
go out in the winter time this is an important
thing.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.939
And also put some cotton wool in the ears
as I put it.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.349
For your sake I’ve told you to put it cause
you are careless, so I look after you but

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.440
putting it to my ears like this.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.760
You all should put it before going out.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.829
And keep your head covered in the night, when
you sleep, cover your head with something

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.829
and then sleep.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.470
Because most of the time, your body is all
covered, but the head is not covered.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.280
Because now you are Realised-souls and your
Sahastrara is weak, so you must look after

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280
your Sahastrara.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.530
Cover your head so that you won’t have any
problem.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.840
Also you must verify what sort of a person
you are.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.100
If you have a liver problem, you must get
a diet for that, which is here, people will

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.100
tell you.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.570
If you are left sided person, if you have
left sided problems, then you must know about

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.570
the diet that you have to take.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.220
For example, a person who is a left sided
should not take carbohydrates at all, on the

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.360
contrary should eat proteins, in whatever
form it is possible.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.280
In Sahaja Yoga you know we don’t believe
in vegetarianism or anything, but we do believe

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:10.390
that the muscles of bigger animals than us,
are not good for our teeth, or for our body

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:17.530
also because the structure of a muscular cell
of a bigger animal is much bigger than ours.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.420
And that’s how they heat up, I mean, even
by mistake if I eat some beef, or anybody

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.730
ask me, the other day, my cheeks were swollen
up, so that’s why it happens, it is an automatic

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.730
reaction.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:38.130
And we are not supposed to use plastics; in
our clothes, also try to avoid.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.400
Some person, [?] plastic can be used but not
all the time plastics and nylons.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.680
And also the food should not be eaten in plastics.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.450
You can eat it in paper, paper is alright
because it is –what you call- is wood, it

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.520
doesn’t matter.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.080
But you shouldn’t eat in plastic food, plactic
with fork and spoon of plastic and it’s

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.840
too much plastic in this country, be careful
because plastic is anti-God.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.930
It is anti-human life, it is anti-biological
processes.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.470
So avoid plastic as far as possible, be careful
on that.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.630
Also don’t use, I mean, something out of
absolute plastic like, I’ve seen I wanted

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.670
to buy one pair of slippers for myself, I
couldn’t get one in the all of New-York.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.050
Because I didn’t want a plastic.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.310
And if you wear that then you develop all
kinds of skin problems and diseases, so be

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.780
careful on that.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.930
There are so many other things we have to
be careful about.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.600
And because we have found out that these things
are harmful, that’s why we have made it

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.330
compulsory that every one of you must be careful.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.660
Because now you have become the temple of
God and the temple of God should be healthy.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.560
We don’t want tubercular patients to go
around as saints nobody is going to believe

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.560
them.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.870
Sahaja Yogi: Can you just tell us about sugar.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.160
Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.250
Now there is another falsehood about- thank’s
God it’s now broken- that the sugar is against

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.150
our growth and all that.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.530
Sugar is very important for attention, specially
people who suffer from liver.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.930
For example, people who are thin, mostly,
suffer from liver trouble.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.770
For them, sugar is so important, that if they
don’t take sugar, they’ll become like

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.420
the sugar cane which is, comes out of the
machine, pressing machine, you see.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.600
They’d better take some sugar.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.740
Sugar is very important for your liver!

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.710
Best carbohydrate is the white sugar, not
the red sugar; red sugar is not good because

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.300
it has got molasses, it’s very heating.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.500
Some people have funny ideas here, also about
food.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.800
Like, some of them believe, that if you eat
natural food- and once I got something from

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.750
natural store and I got diarrhoea for five
days!

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.940
Because it was meant for animals not for human
beings.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.830
Like some people eat, what you call them [Shri
Mataji speaks in Marathi] cotton seed.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:10.600
Now cotton seeds we give only to animals.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.600
I can’t believe it.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.150
But I’ve seen in Switzerland, they give
cotton seed in the bread.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:20.810
There was cotton seeds in the bread, one or
two is alright, but imagine [Shri Mataji speaks

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.590
in Hindi] – Laughs from Hindi speakers.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.830
I mean it has to be given to buffalos only!

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.950
[Laughter] Like that, I was given a [inaudible]
You see, these are very strong things.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.930
In the same way, very soft food is also not
good, we have to be in the centre in everything.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:38.409
Don’t eat very raw food you see, like some
of the bread in France you know, even in England

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.210
we find, the bread cereals [inaudible] completely.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.550
So that kind of a crispy stuff is not needed.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:51.650
It should be such that your gums are looked
after, there are delicate things, and have

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.630
food which is good for you.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:59.650
Don’t go with rationality, don’t go with
the fashion, but whatever is good for you

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.650
that should be done.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:05.420
And you find out about yourself, what is your
temperament, what sort of a food will suit

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.590
you, and accordingly you should eat.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:13.770
Of course, everybody is free to do what they
like but we can only advise them that this

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.790
will suit you and you’ll find out it will
be very useful to all of you, it will help

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:19.790
you.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.780
For your hair growth, also you should get
vibrated oil and use it.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.590
Now, you’ll be surprised that day, somebody
saw Warren and he said: “He is the same

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.590
fellow?

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.590
He looks much younger”.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.730
So I said: “Yes”.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.910
he had a bald head from here to here like
that and now he’s grown hair.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:41.640
With proper care, you can have you hair quite
intact, for quite some time, if you look after

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.640
your hair.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.540
But hair is very important is not so much
the look, but it’s Sahastrara.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:54.780
And if you put oil in your Sahastrara every
week, you will have a smooth personality,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:03.000
a smooth behaviour, a smooth movement; you’ll
deal with other people in a gentle manner.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.040
So this is very necessary.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.070
In India we actually have a big masseur attached
to a family, you see, he’s a very hefty

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.140
fellow, and he comes to masseur [massage]
the men, you see, and he just sits on their

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.230
body and really finishes them off completely!

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.690
At the first shot, they’re dead!

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:26.510
Then he uses their body fully and pushes them
and sits on them rub them with one clap!

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.210
You see, five, six of them will be jumping
on five, six people.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.010
With clap, they’ll go round.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.850
By the time the second clap comes in, the
person is finished!

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.860
That’s how, that’s how they manage.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.530
But there is no importance on massage in here,
you see.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.860
And don’t ask a non Sahaja Yogi to massage
you, never.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:50.490
Don’t allow anybody to touch you that way
because, you see, these people carry all bad

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.320
vibrations and you may suffer.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.310
You must allow only the Realised souls to
massage you, if possible, or you yourself

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.500
should massage yourself.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:05.100
But don’t go to these masseurs and people
who are massaging all kind of people and they

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.550
might be giving you some troubles.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.620
So one has to be very careful about certain
things and certain personal habits also which

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.620
we have discussed.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:19.130
And you can ask Warren, he’ll tell you about
it, which are very important for Mooladhara

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.220
and all those things, which must be followed,
whether you are in England, America, anywhere.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:28.020
These must be followed to keep yourself clean
outside and inside.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.380
Now if you have any question.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:34.620
Sahaja Yogi: I was only wondering about the
kind of techniques that we should use when

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.790
massaging the children.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.390
But I guess we can talk about that another
time.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:43.520
Shri Mataji: I mean, anyway you use is alright,
but always, you put it upwards, you see?

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.980
The movement should be upwards, but use oil
otherwise you pull up, you pull up their hair.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.410
So use oil to put it upwards.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.760
Sahaja Yogi: And don’t forget the Sahasrara.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.150
Shri Mataji: Sahasrara, don’t forget.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.960
Sahasrara you must put lot of oil on children.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:10.920
Sahaja Yogi: Mother we’re gone need more
hairdressers, people who can cut hair, who

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.920
are Realised souls, cause they are touching
our Sahastrara while cutting.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.920
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.920
Otherwise you can grow, what’s the harm?

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.920
Sahaja Yogi: We can grow our hair Mother?

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.720
Shri Mataji: Yes here, up to here [below the
ears] you can grow and turn them round.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:24.140
Shri Mataji: You see, you’ll look like a
philosopher, quite impressive.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.290
Shri Mataji: But you should not be a funny
looking person.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:34.420
That’s one thing very important you see.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.800
You have to, not to adopt some funny methods,
you see?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.040
Like people have.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.090
Specially, nowadays, the fashion is to disable
your hair and keep them absolutely disabled,

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.720
there’s no need of doing-
Sahaja Yogi: The hair must be up there, over

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.720
the forehead.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.720
Shri Mataji: Ah!

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.640
It should be keep back over the forehead,
don’t cover your forehead or your eyes,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.640
never.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.330
Sahaja Yogis: Agnya chakra
Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.330
Agnya chakra.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.040
You must keep it open, you see, always open.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.840
You must have a centre path if it’s possible,
but keep the forehead open, this is important.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.070
You should keep the forehead open, it’s
very good for others you see, and don’t

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.279
cover your eyes with any hair.

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:19.460
Many people have a habit of allowing the hair
to come in the eyes and you’ll have [inaudible].

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.180
Children also, never allow hair to come on
their eyes.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.400
Then we have something for the eyes also,
what you call Netranjan, I don’t have now

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.270
anything, but it’s a very good, simple thing,
cots you nothing about- [Shri Mataji speaks

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.020
aside] one cent of a dollar.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.920
Sahaja Yogi: We have some, we can send them
tomorrow.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.570
Shri Mataji: Alright, they have some, they’ll
give you, which is to be applied first very

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.570
carefully.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.660
Because if you are not used to it, it will
a little bit burn and the tears will start

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.910
coming out of your eyes, it will clear your
eyes.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.529
And you’ll be surprised, with that, if you
use it, you don’t develop these bags [dark

00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:55.650
circles] and things like that.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:56.740
And the water flows out.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.850
It’s a very simple thing.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:07.500
And for soap also, try to use natural soaps,
better use, because here the soaps are such

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.470
that I don’t know what to say.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.590
Sahaja Yogi: Paramolove Mother?

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.230
Paramolove, I think that is about the only
soap you can get here.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:27.761
Shri Mataji: Yes that is good, Paramolove
is good.

00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:28.761
It’s very good.

00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:29.761
Gap in the video

00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:33.850
Shri Mataji: What to do, is to take a little
oil, and heat with some clove, Cloves.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.680
Sahaja Yogi: Cloves?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.510
Shri Mataji: Cloves.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:47.080
And let the oil be a little bit cool down,
when it is quite cooled down, nor burning

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.220
out at all, but just warm, you can feel it,
then put it in the ears.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.760
Sahaja Yogini: Olive oil is better?

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.300
Shri Mataji: Olive oil is alright.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300
Gap in the video

00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:00.650
Sahaja Yogi: Mother can you explain to us
the techniques of vibrated sugar and vibrated

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.690
salt, by giving vibrations, I don’t quite
understand you see…

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:11.640
Shri Mataji: You see, because God has given
you vibrations, the power is flowing through

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.900
you now, the vibrations are there.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.190
So whatever you get from outside is touched
by so many people, so many people have created

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.040
it and they have got a good mind or may be
something’s wrong with them, best thing

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.480
is to give them a bandhan before eating.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.620
[Shri Mataji turns tree times her hand]
Any food you eat you must give it a bandhan

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.600
like this three times, so your vibrations
flow into the food and you get it sanctified.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.550
Or else, you can also use your hands for eating
if you have washed your hands, then it’s

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.550
alright.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.720
Or else, if you are taking the water, you
can just put your hands there, then it gets

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.050
vibrated, then drink it.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.080
Because, the thing is, the vibrations have
started flowing through your hands, but still

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.540
have not spread to your body fully.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.180
You see my point?
