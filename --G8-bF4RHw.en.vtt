Mahakali Puja Talk, Paris, France, 1993-0711

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:09.953
Today we have decided to have the puja of the Devi.

00:00:12.676 --> 00:00:18.390
This time we are not talking about Adi Shakti,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:28.673
about Kundalini or about Saraswati, Mahalakshmi.

00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:34.783
We are talking about the Mahakali.

00:00:37.377 --> 00:00:47.061
That’s the Goddess which is the first one,

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:50.792
which comes first

00:00:50.993 --> 00:01:00.611
and establishes Shri Ganesha,

00:01:00.812 --> 00:01:05.083
in the form of Gauri.

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:22.223
She’s the complete form of Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:30.834
Out of Her only these energies emit.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:43.857
So She’s the one who is the power of desire of God.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.904
Within us also She creates desires.

00:01:54.233 --> 00:02:06.470
These desires within us start emitting outside

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:16.193
and we develop a kind of a reaction to all our desires.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.123
The first and foremost desire, as you know very much,

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:29.441
the most primitive, is to feed yourself.

00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:41.187
And this is given to us by the Goddess.

00:02:41.387 --> 00:02:46.079
She gives us the desire to feed ourselves.

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:50.493
Now if we don’t feed ourselves, then we cannot survive.

00:02:50.693 --> 00:03:00.586
We have to have food. It is very
important that we should feed ourselves

00:03:00.786 --> 00:03:05.148
sufficiently enough to exist on this Earth.

00:03:05.348 --> 00:03:08.343
And also we have seen that

00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:19.250
when this kind of desire grows very much more than normal,

00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:28.804
then you become slaves of this desire

00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:34.493
and any amount of food cannot satisfy you.

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:39.638
All the time you think of nothing else but food.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.415
I have told you many a times that the French

00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:47.505
are very particular as to what they should eat.

00:03:47.714 --> 00:03:51.120
You see, they take at least forty-five minutes on a dinner table

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.097
to decide what they will eat.

00:03:56.297 --> 00:04:00.105
Ultimately, it’s just the same. I mean, I don’t understand

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:06.254
how can you need forty-five minutes to decide what you want to eat?

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:13.203
But this desire starts acting through your ego.

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:25.179
So it satisfies you. And also those
people who are manufacturing food

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.851
or who are supplying food in hotels and all that

00:04:29.051 --> 00:04:33.142
know how to satisfy your desires.

00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:35.689
So they bring it in a way, show it round

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.978
and then place it before you, so that you approve of it

00:04:40.178 --> 00:04:44.369
and when you approve of it then they serve.

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.562
They know how to befool you and you
feel quite happy, "Oh, it’s very good.“

00:04:52.265 --> 00:04:55.846
Even the wine is given for testing first of all

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.291
and, whether you like it or not, you have to say it’s very good

00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:04.032
and you better show that you like it.

00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:11.784
So this desire gets completely controlled by your ego

00:05:11.984 --> 00:05:18.511
and when it becomes a kind of a collective desire

00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:24.049
and a collective ego expression,

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:28.533
then we become like gluttons, you see.

00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:31.673
I would say sophisticated.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:36.414
They’re sophisticated, but we are gluttons.

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:40.368
Now with that, other things also people want to have,

00:05:40.568 --> 00:05:48.082
like proper sort of a table lying and linen, this, that.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.750
Of course, if ego is not there,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:02.723
then people would like to see to please others by feeding them.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.179
This desire reacts.

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.429
And then the new desire comes in

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.906
through the blessings of the Mahakali

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:21.554
that you like to see others eating the food.

00:06:21.754 --> 00:06:25.104
You enjoy when others eat the food cooked by you,

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:28.550
served by you, given by you.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.374
Just want to watch. That gives you satisfaction.

00:06:34.574 --> 00:06:39.249
But food, to any extent you may go, you will never be satisfied.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.566
Today you will ask for this, tomorrow for that, this, that.

00:06:43.766 --> 00:06:47.347
Now, in the Western life today, it has become very important

00:06:47.547 --> 00:06:51.113
to ask a child every day, "What will you have?"

00:06:51.313 --> 00:06:54.516
In olden days the food was cooked for all the family.

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:57.352
Everybody would eat the same food.

00:06:57.552 --> 00:07:00.867
But now you must ask the child, "What will you have?"

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:03.320
Then the child has to say, "I’ll have this."

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.172
Now, supposing you don’t have that
in your fridge, you are finished.

00:07:08.372 --> 00:07:12.640
Early in the morning there will be no shop open, nothing.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.474
How will you please that boy in his ego

00:07:15.675 --> 00:07:18.230
because he wants a particular thing?

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.475
So gradually we build up even the ego of our children.

00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:27.975
We have to say, "This is cooked, this is nice and you eat this."

00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:31.912
Is the duty of parents not to allow children

00:07:32.112 --> 00:07:37.327
to grow their ego by what they want.

00:07:37.527 --> 00:07:40.288
You should know what they have to have.

00:07:40.488 --> 00:07:44.089
Then it starts growing and growing and growing

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:52.393
till they become quite grown up, but very primitive.

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:56.672
So, actually, the blessing of the Devi on this point is that

00:07:56.872 --> 00:08:03.591
She gives you a desire that you should serve others.

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:08.984
Also you then get concerned about people who are starving,

00:08:09.184 --> 00:08:13.512
want to find out why they are starving.

00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:17.483
The another extreme of this could be that some people think

00:08:17.683 --> 00:08:25.743
we should not eat so much, a kind of a sacrificing nonsense.

00:08:25.943 --> 00:08:30.134
Whatever one has to eat, one should eat.

00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:32.851
Then they say, "Why should we eat so much, Mother?

00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:36.124
After all, there are people who are starving."

00:08:36.324 --> 00:08:39.319
By your eating less or more,

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.280
you cannot save those who are starving, can you?

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.652
So there’s no wisdom in this kind of austerity.

00:08:45.852 --> 00:08:51.230
And when the people enter into this kind of austerity,

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.218
then they have sufferings and troubles

00:08:55.418 --> 00:08:59.819
and such people become extremely, I should say, ascetic

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:03.585
and hot-tempered and you should never go near to a person

00:09:03.785 --> 00:09:06.623
who is of that kind without a barge pole.

00:09:06.824 --> 00:09:10.178
God knows when he will jump on you.

00:09:10.378 --> 00:09:12.586
So a person who is hungry is

00:09:12.787 --> 00:09:15.996
as bad as a person who is overfed.

00:09:16.197 --> 00:09:20.360
I think hungry is worse.

00:09:20.652 --> 00:09:24.496
Now if you look at yourself, the second desire

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:33.604
that comes to you is that everyone should love you.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:43.714
This comes because that makes you good person.

00:09:43.914 --> 00:09:47.128
You know that everybody likes goodness.

00:09:47.328 --> 00:09:51.542
So people try to be good to others, nice to others,

00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:54.367
say a hundred times thank you,

00:09:54.567 --> 00:09:57.562
do all kinds of things to please others.

00:09:57.762 --> 00:10:04.315
By pleasing others, they think others will like us very much.

00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:09.729
But then it develops again out of bounds

00:10:09.929 --> 00:10:13.908
and then all the time you try to please others

00:10:14.108 --> 00:10:17.559
so that you become absolutely slavish.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.550
You become so artificial that people can make out

00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:24.177
that it’s nothing natural with this gentleman.

00:10:24.377 --> 00:10:27.575
He’s just trying to please us.

00:10:27.775 --> 00:10:33.059
Now, with that, the pleasing behind

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:38.672
is some sort of an advantage out of it.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.808
If you please another one with a detached mind,

00:10:44.008 --> 00:10:48.362
not expecting anything, that should be done for you

00:10:48.562 --> 00:10:51.537
or that could be achieved through that pleasing.

00:10:51.737 --> 00:10:54.272
It’s very pure pleasing and it’s very good.

00:10:54.472 --> 00:10:56.960
That makes you really righteous and good.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.155
But supposing you try to please others

00:11:00.355 --> 00:11:04.351
only just to take advantage of that person,

00:11:04.551 --> 00:11:10.917
then you develop hypocrisy, hypocrisy of the worst type.

00:11:15.088 --> 00:11:17.544
And you get lost.

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.208
People mock at you, laugh at you. They’re never pleased.

00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:24.433
They know that you are a hypocrite and you’re doing it

00:11:24.634 --> 00:11:28.786
for some sort of an advantage or an exploitation.

00:11:28.986 --> 00:11:34.613
You are not doing it because you
want to be good really, to be nice.

00:11:34.814 --> 00:11:39.154
A person who is good, automatically pleases others.

00:11:39.354 --> 00:11:42.396
But he doesn’t try to please.

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:47.520
He’s just – his nature is such, his temperament is such

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.249
that he just pleases people.

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:56.546
This, when taken over again by Mister Ego,

00:11:56.746 --> 00:12:01.311
then really you can’t beat it. Then they become diplomats.

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:07.379
You see, could be politicians, all
these doomed classes, they become

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:09.746
and they cannot get out of it.

00:12:09.946 --> 00:12:13.668
They get so much used to it, that they cannot get out of it.

00:12:13.868 --> 00:12:20.199
Now what does the Devi do? She brings the truth before them.

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:23.035
She shows that what you have been doing

00:12:23.235 --> 00:12:27.246
for a particular exploitation doesn’t work out.

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:31.317
After a point it does. She exposes them.

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:35.755
The exposure starts and with that exposure, they’re surprised,

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:42.305
"How am I exposed? How am I caught, how people know?"

00:12:43.532 --> 00:12:48.394
This is the job of the power of Mahakali.

00:12:48.594 --> 00:12:53.737
She exposes all that is wrong, all that is falsehood,

00:12:53.937 --> 00:12:57.643
that is untruth, She exposes.

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:04.535
Then the third desire people have is to possess material things,

00:13:04.735 --> 00:13:10.473
from which materialism has come.
But there’s no end to it.

00:13:10.673 --> 00:13:13.856
End can never come because

00:13:14.056 --> 00:13:17.879
they have no satisfaction in getting one thing.

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:20.284
Supposing today I want to have this carpet.

00:13:20.484 --> 00:13:23.925
All right, I’ll get this one. Then I want to have another one.

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:27.290
Then I want to have another one. Then I want to have a car

00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:29.541
and then I want to have a helicopter, then an aeroplane.

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:34.475
I don’t know what I want to have then.
So it goes on and on and on and on

00:13:34.676 --> 00:13:38.734
until you reach a time where people start thinking,

00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:40.934
"What’s the matter with him?"

00:13:41.135 --> 00:13:45.109
And you cannot enjoy anything that you get.

00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:47.864
This is also a human failing

00:13:48.064 --> 00:13:52.520
and this human failing creates economics, you know that.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:59.101
Economics is created because wants, in general, are not satiable.

00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:02.057
They are not satiable.

00:14:02.257 --> 00:14:04.252
So what happens? We go on from jumping from one

00:14:04.452 --> 00:14:07.425
to another to another to another and another.

00:14:07.625 --> 00:14:13.855
So then you become slaves of entrepreneurs

00:14:14.055 --> 00:14:20.288
so much so, that you lose your individuality completely.

00:14:20.488 --> 00:14:27.606
For example, an entrepreneur produces
a funny kind of a dress, one year.

00:14:27.806 --> 00:14:31.911
So everybody wants to wear the same

00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:35.551
without thinking if it is necessary or not.

00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:40.639
Then he brings in another form.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:45.373
Next year everything is given up, buy the another one.

00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:52.782
Third year another one. So pile of all these clothes are there

00:14:52.982 --> 00:14:56.946
and nicely the manufacturer has become a great man of designs,

00:14:57.146 --> 00:15:00.530
his very good designs, how to befool human beings.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.108
He has become a rich man and you have become poor

00:15:03.308 --> 00:15:10.593
with all this kind of clothes which has no meaning for you anymore.

00:15:10.793 --> 00:15:15.894
About the same thing, about everything, something is fashionable.

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:20.015
That means you have no individuality.

00:15:20.215 --> 00:15:22.328
We talk of individuality,

00:15:22.528 --> 00:15:26.179
but we want to do things which everybody’s doing.

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.208
I mean, you know that all kinds of absurd things people have done

00:15:29.408 --> 00:15:32.591
in the name of fashion

00:15:32.791 --> 00:15:36.302
and specially people who are traditionally bound,

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:40.218
who have had no traditions like Americans, I would say.

00:15:40.418 --> 00:15:44.764
They go on changing after every six months.

00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:48.914
Every year you go, you find a new type of people there,

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:51.914
new type of clothes.

00:15:52.114 --> 00:15:55.094
It’s very surprising how they change so fast

00:15:55.294 --> 00:15:59.653
without even thinking whether this will suit me or not.

00:15:59.853 --> 00:16:02.684
Somebody says wear tight clothes, they’ll go with tight clothes.

00:16:02.884 --> 00:16:07.520
Then they develop varicose veins, so they wear with the holes.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.774
Then they develop some other problem,

00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:13.131
then they wear another kind.

00:16:13.332 --> 00:16:17.897
Nobody wants to think, "Why should I change my dress?"

00:16:18.097 --> 00:16:22.721
Like, say, in India we wear saris, finished.

00:16:22.921 --> 00:16:27.581
Nothing there. No problem with the tailor, nothing doing.

00:16:27.781 --> 00:16:30.171
Whatever sari we like, we’ll buy.

00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:34.296
And a sari came called as mini sari in India,

00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:37.384
which was up to here maybe, I don’t know, not six inches,

00:16:37.584 --> 00:16:40.245
but at least up to the knee.

00:16:40.445 --> 00:16:44.089
It came for about, I think, eight, seven days in Bombay

00:16:44.289 --> 00:16:49.085
and went back. People said, "Get lost. We don’t want it."

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:57.421
So this headache of all the time getting into a fashion

00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:04.141
like horse without any sense in the head

00:17:04.341 --> 00:17:08.958
has to be understood properly.

00:17:10.135 --> 00:17:12.647
Why people do it? Because they have no brains.

00:17:12.847 --> 00:17:16.405
They’re brainless people.

00:17:16.605 --> 00:17:21.991
They’re not intelligent to see that we are befooled every year.

00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:27.523
But, for Sahaja Yogis, the Mahakali power works

00:17:27.723 --> 00:17:35.835
and She teaches them that "All right,
this dress suits you. Have this one."

00:17:36.035 --> 00:17:38.296
And it’s the best for you.

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:42.445
Once for all, your lifelong problem is solved.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:47.239
With this kind of blouse, I started wearing from the very beginning perhaps

00:17:47.439 --> 00:17:52.931
and I’ve been wearing it and now I find everybody wears the same style.

00:17:54.314 --> 00:17:57.396
Why to waste your energy in changing every day this blouse

00:17:57.596 --> 00:18:02.428
starting from here to here, to here and going back again like this? You see.

00:18:02.628 --> 00:18:07.955
It’s such a waste of energy, such a waste of cloth.

00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:11.126
And we make ourselves so cheap running with the race

00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:15.033
of reducing the sleeves, reducing this, reducing that,

00:18:15.233 --> 00:18:18.248
all increasing.

00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:28.718
Is all a desire to impress people that we are very up to date.

00:18:29.413 --> 00:18:32.939
Who wants to know?

00:18:33.139 --> 00:18:38.648
Who wants to find out that you are up to date or not?

00:18:39.297 --> 00:18:45.355
And we have no courage to keep to
our own dress that we have purchased.

00:18:45.555 --> 00:18:48.152
Why to waste so much money? We don’t even think.

00:18:48.352 --> 00:18:53.605
Go on changing, changing, changing for nothing at all.

00:18:53.805 --> 00:18:57.352
So this is desire is there to impress others

00:18:57.552 --> 00:19:01.341
with our outside things.

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:07.494
So many thing like dress there are, which we try to impress.

00:19:08.924 --> 00:19:13.103
Now, hairstyle.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.990
I read an article. They said that

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:23.560
these hairstyles are responsible for many divorces.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.518
I was wondering, "How can it be hairstyles

00:19:26.719 --> 00:19:29.521
responsible for divorces?"

00:19:29.722 --> 00:19:32.780
Because they had made a survey.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.999
A man had liked a hairstyle of his fiancée

00:19:38.199 --> 00:19:43.441
and then she changed her hairstyle, so he divorced her.

00:19:44.676 --> 00:19:47.311
And the other way round.

00:19:47.511 --> 00:19:50.405
When it is so cheap way of disposing of

00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:55.386
such a deep relationship of husband and wife.

00:20:02.525 --> 00:20:06.212
Now certain facts start.

00:20:06.412 --> 00:20:13.587
I also saw one documentary about a lady

00:20:13.787 --> 00:20:19.302
who’d said that it was in one of the advertisements,

00:20:19.503 --> 00:20:21.930
something, sort of a thing appeared that your legs should be

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:27.599
of this shape and what you should do.

00:20:27.799 --> 00:20:30.846
So poor thing spent so much time, energy,

00:20:31.047 --> 00:20:32.916
ran up and down to make the legs.

00:20:33.117 --> 00:20:36.169
I mean what is the importance of these legs, except for walking?

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:39.411
So she went to make the shape like that.

00:20:39.611 --> 00:20:44.505
She used to measure it, would be always something missing here and there.

00:20:44.705 --> 00:20:48.326
Then many people joined. They had a class for it.

00:20:48.526 --> 00:20:52.956
And a group joined to make legs like that.

00:20:53.156 --> 00:20:59.633
And, ultimately, they found out that that leg was made out of wood.

00:21:00.951 --> 00:21:04.040
And they spent so much money, so much energy

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.451
to make legs like that. For what?

00:21:08.927 --> 00:21:12.399
What is the purpose?

00:21:12.599 --> 00:21:16.579
If anybody says, "You run like this," they start running.

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:22.647
They say, "Jump like this," they start jumping. But why?

00:21:23.413 --> 00:21:25.994
Have we gone all nuts in our heads

00:21:26.194 --> 00:21:31.119
that we should accept whatever one says, we start doing that.

00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:34.572
What is the purpose?

00:21:34.773 --> 00:21:38.315
So this kind of stupidity comes in our heads

00:21:38.515 --> 00:21:40.815
when we start using our ego.

00:21:41.015 --> 00:21:46.484
With the ego a person becomes absolutely stupid.

00:21:47.036 --> 00:21:57.668
Because he’ll say, "What’s wrong? What’s wrong if I,

00:21:57.869 --> 00:22:04.322
if I have just a little hair here? What’s wrong?

00:22:04.522 --> 00:22:14.963
If I just try to wear a very short dress here, what’s wrong?"

00:22:15.463 --> 00:22:19.794
The wrong is why are you wearing?

00:22:19.994 --> 00:22:25.000
Why don’t you ask a question? Why are you wearing?

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.563
If you ask a question to yourself, "Why do I have this kind of hairstyle?"

00:22:29.763 --> 00:22:33.801
"Why do I do like this?"

00:22:34.231 --> 00:22:38.414
It is really difficult to tell people to do right things,

00:22:38.614 --> 00:22:43.023
but wrong things people take to like that.

00:22:43.223 --> 00:22:48.584
For example, I told everyone that you put oil, if not every day,

00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:53.164
just before bath, a lot of oil in your hair and wash.

00:22:53.364 --> 00:22:57.642
Now I find many people getting bald.

00:22:58.259 --> 00:23:02.981
But they didn’t put the oil. What can I do about it?

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:08.676
But such a simple thing they won’t have.

00:23:09.285 --> 00:23:12.280
Such a simple thing they would not believe,

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.400
that you need something for your nourishment.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.697
But they will do something which is absurd,

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:26.031
nonsensical without even thinking, "What is going to harm us."

00:23:27.023 --> 00:23:30.479
Here the Mahakali, what does She do?

00:23:30.679 --> 00:23:33.807
She punishes you.

00:23:34.007 --> 00:23:38.878
Your body is punished. If you wear very tight clothes,

00:23:39.078 --> 00:23:42.253
you develop problems of your legs.

00:23:42.453 --> 00:23:49.401
If you wear holey pants, then you get cramps.

00:23:49.601 --> 00:23:54.227
Anything you do abnormal, you have to pay for it.

00:23:54.427 --> 00:23:56.922
First you have to pay for doing it

00:23:57.122 --> 00:24:02.083
and then you have to pay for it physically.

00:24:02.544 --> 00:24:08.359
So many things can be avoided if we just had a simple life,

00:24:08.559 --> 00:24:11.132
decide once for all that

00:24:11.332 --> 00:24:16.870
"I will have this kind of dress for this lifetime, finished."

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:23.405
Every day to change, itself, is a headache.

00:24:23.605 --> 00:24:28.214
But that satisfied the ego, not your Self.

00:24:29.183 --> 00:24:36.412
So the Mahalaxmi Principle in us raises higher and higher.

00:24:36.612 --> 00:24:41.096
Despite that, we are pulled down.

00:24:41.948 --> 00:24:47.541
Then this Mahakali, She comes forward

00:24:47.741 --> 00:24:52.213
and shows what wrong we have done,

00:24:52.413 --> 00:24:59.881
how we have gone wrong,
how we have missed the point.

00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:08.876
Instead of thinking what is wrong,
She teaches you, "It is wrong."

00:25:10.618 --> 00:25:13.670
Then another thing She does, which is a very beautiful thing She does,

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:20.654
I think sometimes, that She creates an illusion

00:25:20.854 --> 00:25:26.495
to test your intelligence, to test your sensibility.

00:25:26.695 --> 00:25:30.971
She creates an illusion. Branti rupena samstita.

00:25:31.171 --> 00:25:35.959
She makes a branti in your head. Illusion.

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:39.108
So you become illusive

00:25:39.308 --> 00:25:43.904
or others become illusive or a situation becomes illusive.

00:25:44.104 --> 00:25:47.060
And you are lost in it.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:54.224
Then you really understand that it’s wrong thing I have done.

00:25:54.424 --> 00:25:58.752
It’s a very nice story about Narada.

00:25:58.952 --> 00:26:04.862
Narada was under an impression about himself

00:26:05.062 --> 00:26:10.146
and ultimately he became ego-oriented and he started saying,

00:26:10.347 --> 00:26:14.124
"Oh, look at me. I am never enticed by any woman.

00:26:14.324 --> 00:26:18.624
Even Shiva was enticed by Cupid. I am never enticed.

00:26:18.824 --> 00:26:23.740
I am the highest of highest, Brahmachari."

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:31.554
So Vishnu sent two gandharvas to entice him.

00:26:31.754 --> 00:26:34.570
So they met him in a forest and told him,

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.796
"Oh, Narada, you are such a handsome man,

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:41.797
such a beautiful man and all your beauty’s wasted.

00:26:41.997 --> 00:26:44.352
You must test your beauty. You must see how beautiful you are.

00:26:44.552 --> 00:26:47.555
You’re so handsome."

00:26:47.755 --> 00:26:50.454
He said, "Really?" "Yes. There’s a very simple way of testing you."

00:26:50.654 --> 00:26:55.547
"It’s how?" They said, "There’s a

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:59.508
wedding coming up of a very beautiful woman.

00:26:59.708 --> 00:27:09.050
She is the princess of the beauty city, is called Roop Nagar,

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:13.949
and you should go there and see how she will appreciate you.

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:20.980
So he, in his ego, became so stupid that he went there.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.160
And he was sitting and lots of people were coming,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.227
big big maharajas, rajas, all of them were sitting

00:27:28.428 --> 00:27:33.105
and he was thinking, "Oh, I’m the
best among all of them. Who are these?

00:27:33.305 --> 00:27:36.500
The princess will just garland me, no doubt about it."

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:42.586
And these two were putting that illusion in his head, branti.

00:27:42.786 --> 00:27:46.504
With the Agnya, you get branti.

00:27:46.704 --> 00:27:51.918
This princess came round. She
looked at him and she laughed aloud.

00:27:52.118 --> 00:27:56.013
She couldn’t control herself and she moved on giggling.

00:27:56.213 --> 00:27:58.544
He couldn’t understand why she laughed at him.

00:27:58.744 --> 00:28:03.130
She didn’t garland him or nothing but she just laughed.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.832
So he couldn’t understand, "I’m such a handsome man," this thing.

00:28:07.032 --> 00:28:10.355
So these two gandharvas told him, "Oh, it doesn’t matter.

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:14.066
You see, she doesn’t understand. She’ll come back," this, that.

00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:17.550
Then they went out and near a lake and he sat down

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:22.316
to wash his face and looked at in the water his reflection.

00:28:22.516 --> 00:28:26.970
He looked like a monkey.

00:28:27.907 --> 00:28:30.278
He looked at these two and he cursed them.

00:28:30.478 --> 00:28:32.516
He said, "I look like a monkey."

00:28:32.717 --> 00:28:36.197
Said, "To us, you look like very handsome."

00:28:36.397 --> 00:28:40.658
"But I really look like a monkey."

00:28:40.858 --> 00:28:47.552
So this branti, this illusion was created in his mind by his ego.

00:28:47.752 --> 00:28:50.881
But this power, itself, Mahakali’s power,

00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:58.339
She puts this ego right by creating illusion, branti.

00:29:00.855 --> 00:29:07.477
And this is responsible for many illusions we run after.

00:29:07.677 --> 00:29:13.732
It’s a mirage, running after it, running after it.

00:29:14.492 --> 00:29:19.198
Once we are satisfied within ourselves,

00:29:19.398 --> 00:29:25.437
then we don’t run after mirages.

00:29:25.984 --> 00:29:28.186
This illusion, if it would not be created,

00:29:28.386 --> 00:29:34.101
people would be so egoistical that whole world will be finished.

00:29:35.035 --> 00:29:40.921
So this is the great work of Mahakali Power within us,

00:29:41.121 --> 00:29:44.703
that She creates illusions.

00:29:44.903 --> 00:29:47.617
Many people talk of maya. "This is Mother, maya.

00:29:47.817 --> 00:29:51.281
This is maya. That is maya."

00:29:51.481 --> 00:29:54.432
Is the work of Mahakali.

00:29:54.632 --> 00:29:57.960
She wants to test you.

00:29:58.265 --> 00:30:06.153
She wants to test you. But in Sahaja Yoga it’s not such a strong one.

00:30:06.353 --> 00:30:09.388
For example, you know Abraham had a son.

00:30:09.588 --> 00:30:13.997
One son he had after a long time.

00:30:14.197 --> 00:30:18.726
And God asked him that he should sacrifice his son.

00:30:18.926 --> 00:30:21.543
His wife said also was feeling terrible that

00:30:21.744 --> 00:30:25.219
he has to sacrifice his son.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:31.384
So he went down to the place where the child was to be sacrificed.

00:30:31.584 --> 00:30:35.389
He made a fire, everything and was about to put the child

00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:40.943
on that pyre of fire when the voice came.

00:30:41.143 --> 00:30:45.102
This is Mahakali,

00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:50.076
that you don’t have to sacrifice your child.

00:30:50.599 --> 00:30:54.079
We have many such stories in Indian mythology also

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:58.064
where they were tested.

00:30:58.264 --> 00:31:05.256
So to test Sahaja Yogis also, this Mahakali helps you.

00:31:06.812 --> 00:31:11.260
There was a gentleman who was very egoistical,

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.901
so I told him to come to Delhi

00:31:14.101 --> 00:31:17.430
because I didn’t know how to do it here.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.797
He came to Delhi and he told everybody, "See,

00:31:19.997 --> 00:31:23.407
Mother told me to come here just to cure Her."

00:31:23.607 --> 00:31:28.387
I said, "All right." He came. I said, "What’s wrong with Me?"

00:31:28.587 --> 00:31:31.465
He said, "Mother, Your Nabhi is very bad." I said, "Really?

00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:34.715
Acha, you put a bandhan to yourself and now see for yourself."

00:31:34.915 --> 00:31:37.245
"Oh my God, you see, what’s happening to me here?"

00:31:37.445 --> 00:31:41.376
I said, "That’s My Nabhi."

00:31:41.576 --> 00:31:45.298
So this is how the illusion corrects you.

00:31:45.498 --> 00:31:49.483
If there is no illusion, you would not ever be corrected directly.

00:31:49.683 --> 00:31:54.779
Supposing I say, "Don’t do this." You may not like.

00:31:54.979 --> 00:32:00.363
Of yourse, mostly you like, but sometimes you don’t.

00:32:00.563 --> 00:32:05.331
And then the illusion works and then you realize,

00:32:05.531 --> 00:32:11.223
"Where was I and where am I now? I should not have done this.

00:32:11.423 --> 00:32:14.731
How is it I have landed into this problem?

00:32:14.931 --> 00:32:19.307
What has made me so stupid?"

00:32:19.507 --> 00:32:24.288
So this is something which She does.

00:32:25.054 --> 00:32:30.444
Another is She’s the one who relaxes you completely.

00:32:30.644 --> 00:32:36.895
When you are tired and fed up, when you don’t know what to do,

00:32:37.095 --> 00:32:42.708
then She makes you sleep. She’s the one who gives you sleep.

00:32:42.908 --> 00:32:45.528
All day’s work you do,

00:32:45.728 --> 00:32:51.089
ultimately the Mahakali power acts on you as sleep.

00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:55.862
She makes you sleep, sleep like a child.

00:32:56.062 --> 00:33:00.766
You know, at that time, all that wrong we have done to ourselves

00:33:00.966 --> 00:33:04.574
and to others are forgiven.

00:33:04.774 --> 00:33:07.463
In Her lap we sleep nicely,

00:33:07.664 --> 00:33:13.761
quietly and all our problems are solved.

00:33:14.982 --> 00:33:23.564
In those dreams, when you are, She brings forth solutions to you.

00:33:23.764 --> 00:33:26.871
I know so many people told Me, "Mother, you came in my dream

00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:30.980
and told me that this is the medicine you should take.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.379
You came in my dream and You told me that

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:39.474
this particular type of life will suit you."

00:33:39.674 --> 00:33:43.701
They see Me clearly coming, but there it is not whole of Me,

00:33:43.901 --> 00:33:47.793
but I think the Mahakali Power acts.

00:33:47.993 --> 00:33:53.816
Into very deep sleep you are, it is called, at the Sushupti.

00:33:54.016 --> 00:33:58.504
There She appears. One lady came to me and she said,

00:33:58.704 --> 00:34:01.688
"Mother, You came in the dream and you said that

00:34:01.889 --> 00:34:05.501
I’m here in Bombay. Nobody told me."

00:34:05.701 --> 00:34:08.083
So so many things happen like this.

00:34:08.283 --> 00:34:14.044
In the dream She guides you and tells you.

00:34:14.244 --> 00:34:16.708
Now what happens sometimes,

00:34:16.908 --> 00:34:19.995
people tell Me that I had such and such dream,

00:34:20.195 --> 00:34:23.109
which is all falsehood, I know.

00:34:23.309 --> 00:34:26.640
They never dreamt like that. They never saw like this.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.050
But, just to impress Me, they tell Me that,

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:33.068
"Oh, I had a dream," this, that.

00:34:33.268 --> 00:34:37.729
I just show complete ignorance. I ask, "Must be?"

00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:43.003
Then they are put into again branti, means illusion.

00:34:43.203 --> 00:34:48.382
Gradually, they realize that

00:34:48.582 --> 00:34:53.090
it was wrong to tell lies to Mother.

00:34:53.785 --> 00:34:57.671
So the correction part takes place,

00:34:57.871 --> 00:35:01.897
but the greatest thing that She does

00:35:02.097 --> 00:35:10.050
is to give you the sense of chastity and security.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.855
When the children are born, they have sense of chastity,

00:35:14.055 --> 00:35:18.826
shame, decency, decorous behaviour.

00:35:19.026 --> 00:35:21.959
But gradually, when they start others misbehaving,

00:35:22.159 --> 00:35:28.338
they start misbehaving. To them, decency becomes a bondage.

00:35:29.083 --> 00:35:32.501
But, naturally, She’s there to tell you that

00:35:32.701 --> 00:35:37.657
"This is indecent. You shouldn’t do it. This is wrong.

00:35:37.857 --> 00:35:41.208
This is not the proper thing to do."

00:35:41.408 --> 00:35:44.232
But gradually, you grow up and mature,

00:35:44.432 --> 00:35:48.510
then you go, "What’s wrong?"

00:35:49.264 --> 00:35:55.298
You start disrespecting your chastity

00:35:55.498 --> 00:36:03.164
and you start becoming like immature, stupid people.

00:36:03.364 --> 00:36:10.529
All this, if is understood through meditation,

00:36:10.729 --> 00:36:14.365
the Mahakali helps you a lot.

00:36:14.565 --> 00:36:21.854
In meditation, She helps you a lot,
because She’s the one who creates

00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:26.479
the proper passage for Kundalini to rise.

00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:30.496
Mahakali is the same as the Kundalini

00:36:30.696 --> 00:36:36.480
because She is the residual energy of Mahakali Power,

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.659
full of it there. But the function is different.

00:36:41.859 --> 00:36:46.081
The function of Mahakali is to protect you,

00:36:46.281 --> 00:36:50.352
is to guide you, to give you wisdom.

00:36:50.552 --> 00:36:54.320
And the function of the Kundalini is to cleanse you,

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.180
to clear it out, not to play about with you,

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.893
to forgive you and help you to grow properly.

00:37:04.093 --> 00:37:07.549
Now in your life, as Sahaja Yogis, you will see

00:37:07.749 --> 00:37:11.716
how Mahakali helps you in every way.

00:37:11.916 --> 00:37:15.529
It is so interesting to watch Her work,

00:37:15.729 --> 00:37:22.450
how She brings forth all kinds of satisfactions to you.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:26.161
The greed goes away. The temptations go away.

00:37:26.361 --> 00:37:30.149
The temper goes away. All these things disappear.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:34.645
The most helpful thing She does,

00:37:34.845 --> 00:37:39.635
that you get rid of your bad habits. Absolutely.

00:37:39.835 --> 00:37:44.346
Automatically, in the light of Mahakali’s power,

00:37:44.546 --> 00:37:51.796
you just do not want anything destructive to be practised.

00:37:51.996 --> 00:37:58.182
If you have been practising anything
destructive, you try to get rid of it.

00:37:58.382 --> 00:38:01.112
Just you stop it. "I don’t want to have it."

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:03.995
I never tell you, "Don’t do this. Don’t do that."

00:38:04.195 --> 00:38:07.001
It’s the Mahakali power within you which is awakened,

00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:11.189
does all these things. And She has made you so beautiful,

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:18.457
so angelic. She has, by Her corrections and by Her illusions,

00:38:18.657 --> 00:38:20.879
She has made you like this.

00:38:21.079 --> 00:38:29.838
So you don’t get so much attached to money, to greed, to lust,

00:38:30.038 --> 00:38:36.634
all these things which are responsible for putting you down.

00:38:36.834 --> 00:38:41.095
Also possessiveness for children, possessiveness for husband,

00:38:41.295 --> 00:38:43.915
possessiveness of matter.

00:38:44.115 --> 00:38:48.639
You just start understanding that the joy is in sharing.

00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:54.194
You want to share everything with others and that sharing starts

00:38:54.394 --> 00:39:00.668
when these Mahakali Powers start giving you blessings

00:39:00.868 --> 00:39:06.184
of joy, of sharing,

00:39:06.384 --> 00:39:14.167
of being collective, of being pure.

00:39:14.367 --> 00:39:20.456
These blessings come to you from the Mahalakshmi Power, Mahakali Power.

00:39:20.657 --> 00:39:24.081
So today we are going to worship that Mahakali power.

00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:26.937
May God bless you.
