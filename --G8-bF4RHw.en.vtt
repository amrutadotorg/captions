Mahakali Puja Talk, Paris, France, 1993-0711

00:01.599 --> 00:09.953
Today we have decided to have the puja of the Devi.

00:12.676 --> 00:18.390
This time we are not talking about Adi Shakti,

00:18.590 --> 00:28.673
about Kundalini or about Saraswati, Mahalakshmi.

00:28.911 --> 00:34.783
We are talking about the Mahakali.

00:37.377 --> 00:47.061
That’s the Goddess which is the first one,

00:47.262 --> 00:50.792
which comes first

00:50.993 --> 01:00.611
and establishes Shri Ganesha,

01:00.812 --> 01:05.083
in the form of Gauri.

01:08.809 --> 01:22.223
She’s the complete form of Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi.

01:23.116 --> 01:30.834
Out of Her only these energies emit.

01:32.358 --> 01:43.857
So She’s the one who is the power of desire of God.

01:45.099 --> 01:50.904
Within us also She creates desires.

01:54.233 --> 02:06.470
These desires within us start emitting outside

02:06.670 --> 02:16.193
and we develop a kind of a reaction to all our desires.

02:20.990 --> 02:24.123
The first and foremost desire, as you know very much,

02:24.323 --> 02:29.441
the most primitive, is to feed yourself.

02:34.082 --> 02:41.187
And this is given to us by the Goddess.

02:41.387 --> 02:46.079
She gives us the desire to feed ourselves.

02:46.279 --> 02:50.493
Now if we don’t feed ourselves, then we cannot survive.

02:50.693 --> 03:00.586
We have to have food. It is very
important that we should feed ourselves

03:00.786 --> 03:05.148
sufficiently enough to exist on this Earth.

03:05.348 --> 03:08.343
And also we have seen that

03:08.543 --> 03:19.250
when this kind of desire grows very much more than normal,

03:19.451 --> 03:28.804
then you become slaves of this desire

03:29.004 --> 03:34.493
and any amount of food cannot satisfy you.

03:34.693 --> 03:39.638
All the time you think of nothing else but food.

03:41.169 --> 03:44.415
I have told you many a times that the French

03:44.615 --> 03:47.505
are very particular as to what they should eat.

03:47.714 --> 03:51.120
You see, they take at least forty-five minutes on a dinner table

03:51.320 --> 03:56.097
to decide what they will eat.

03:56.297 --> 04:00.105
Ultimately, it’s just the same. I mean, I don’t understand

04:00.305 --> 04:06.254
how can you need forty-five minutes to decide what you want to eat?

04:06.454 --> 04:13.203
But this desire starts acting through your ego.

04:13.403 --> 04:25.179
So it satisfies you. And also those
people who are manufacturing food

04:25.379 --> 04:28.851
or who are supplying food in hotels and all that

04:29.051 --> 04:33.142
know how to satisfy your desires.

04:33.342 --> 04:35.689
So they bring it in a way, show it round

04:35.889 --> 04:39.978
and then place it before you, so that you approve of it

04:40.178 --> 04:44.369
and when you approve of it then they serve.

04:44.569 --> 04:50.562
They know how to befool you and you
feel quite happy, "Oh, it’s very good.“

04:52.265 --> 04:55.846
Even the wine is given for testing first of all

04:56.046 --> 04:58.291
and, whether you like it or not, you have to say it’s very good

04:58.491 --> 05:04.032
and you better show that you like it.

05:04.232 --> 05:11.784
So this desire gets completely controlled by your ego

05:11.984 --> 05:18.511
and when it becomes a kind of a collective desire

05:18.711 --> 05:24.049
and a collective ego expression,

05:24.249 --> 05:28.533
then we become like gluttons, you see.

05:28.733 --> 05:31.673
I would say sophisticated.

05:31.873 --> 05:36.414
They’re sophisticated, but we are gluttons.

05:36.615 --> 05:40.368
Now with that, other things also people want to have,

05:40.568 --> 05:48.082
like proper sort of a table lying and linen, this, that.

05:48.590 --> 05:53.750
Of course, if ego is not there,

05:53.950 --> 06:02.723
then people would like to see to please others by feeding them.

06:03.629 --> 06:07.179
This desire reacts.

06:07.379 --> 06:11.429
And then the new desire comes in

06:11.629 --> 06:14.906
through the blessings of the Mahakali

06:15.106 --> 06:21.554
that you like to see others eating the food.

06:21.754 --> 06:25.104
You enjoy when others eat the food cooked by you,

06:25.304 --> 06:28.550
served by you, given by you.

06:28.750 --> 06:34.374
Just want to watch. That gives you satisfaction.

06:34.574 --> 06:39.249
But food, to any extent you may go, you will never be satisfied.

06:39.449 --> 06:43.566
Today you will ask for this, tomorrow for that, this, that.

06:43.766 --> 06:47.347
Now, in the Western life today, it has become very important

06:47.547 --> 06:51.113
to ask a child every day, "What will you have?"

06:51.313 --> 06:54.516
In olden days the food was cooked for all the family.

06:54.716 --> 06:57.352
Everybody would eat the same food.

06:57.552 --> 07:00.867
But now you must ask the child, "What will you have?"

07:01.067 --> 07:03.320
Then the child has to say, "I’ll have this."

07:03.520 --> 07:08.172
Now, supposing you don’t have that
in your fridge, you are finished.

07:08.372 --> 07:12.640
Early in the morning there will be no shop open, nothing.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.474
How will you please that boy in his ego

07:15.675 --> 07:18.230
because he wants a particular thing?

07:18.430 --> 07:23.475
So gradually we build up even the ego of our children.

07:23.675 --> 07:27.975
We have to say, "This is cooked, this is nice and you eat this."

07:28.175 --> 07:31.912
Is the duty of parents not to allow children

07:32.112 --> 07:37.327
to grow their ego by what they want.

07:37.527 --> 07:40.288
You should know what they have to have.

07:40.488 --> 07:44.089
Then it starts growing and growing and growing

07:44.289 --> 07:52.393
till they become quite grown up, but very primitive.

07:52.593 --> 07:56.672
So, actually, the blessing of the Devi on this point is that

07:56.872 --> 08:03.591
She gives you a desire that you should serve others.

08:04.426 --> 08:08.984
Also you then get concerned about people who are starving,

08:09.184 --> 08:13.512
want to find out why they are starving.

08:13.784 --> 08:17.483
The another extreme of this could be that some people think

08:17.683 --> 08:25.743
we should not eat so much, a kind of a sacrificing nonsense.

08:25.943 --> 08:30.134
Whatever one has to eat, one should eat.

08:30.334 --> 08:32.851
Then they say, "Why should we eat so much, Mother?

08:33.051 --> 08:36.124
After all, there are people who are starving."

08:36.324 --> 08:39.319
By your eating less or more,

08:39.519 --> 08:42.280
you cannot save those who are starving, can you?

08:42.480 --> 08:45.652
So there’s no wisdom in this kind of austerity.

08:45.852 --> 08:51.230
And when the people enter into this kind of austerity,

08:51.430 --> 08:55.218
then they have sufferings and troubles

08:55.418 --> 08:59.819
and such people become extremely, I should say, ascetic

09:00.019 --> 09:03.585
and hot-tempered and you should never go near to a person

09:03.785 --> 09:06.623
who is of that kind without a barge pole.

09:06.824 --> 09:10.178
God knows when he will jump on you.

09:10.378 --> 09:12.586
So a person who is hungry is

09:12.787 --> 09:15.996
as bad as a person who is overfed.

09:16.197 --> 09:20.360
I think hungry is worse.

09:20.652 --> 09:24.496
Now if you look at yourself, the second desire

09:24.697 --> 09:33.604
that comes to you is that everyone should love you.

09:34.950 --> 09:43.714
This comes because that makes you good person.

09:43.914 --> 09:47.128
You know that everybody likes goodness.

09:47.328 --> 09:51.542
So people try to be good to others, nice to others,

09:51.742 --> 09:54.367
say a hundred times thank you,

09:54.567 --> 09:57.562
do all kinds of things to please others.

09:57.762 --> 10:04.315
By pleasing others, they think others will like us very much.

10:04.515 --> 10:09.729
But then it develops again out of bounds

10:09.929 --> 10:13.908
and then all the time you try to please others

10:14.108 --> 10:17.559
so that you become absolutely slavish.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.550
You become so artificial that people can make out

10:21.751 --> 10:24.177
that it’s nothing natural with this gentleman.

10:24.377 --> 10:27.575
He’s just trying to please us.

10:27.775 --> 10:33.059
Now, with that, the pleasing behind

10:33.259 --> 10:38.672
is some sort of an advantage out of it.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.808
If you please another one with a detached mind,

10:44.008 --> 10:48.362
not expecting anything, that should be done for you

10:48.562 --> 10:51.537
or that could be achieved through that pleasing.

10:51.737 --> 10:54.272
It’s very pure pleasing and it’s very good.

10:54.472 --> 10:56.960
That makes you really righteous and good.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.155
But supposing you try to please others

11:00.355 --> 11:04.351
only just to take advantage of that person,

11:04.551 --> 11:10.917
then you develop hypocrisy, hypocrisy of the worst type.

11:15.088 --> 11:17.544
And you get lost.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.208
People mock at you, laugh at you. They’re never pleased.

11:20.408 --> 11:24.433
They know that you are a hypocrite and you’re doing it

11:24.634 --> 11:28.786
for some sort of an advantage or an exploitation.

11:28.986 --> 11:34.613
You are not doing it because you
want to be good really, to be nice.

11:34.814 --> 11:39.154
A person who is good, automatically pleases others.

11:39.354 --> 11:42.396
But he doesn’t try to please.

11:42.596 --> 11:47.520
He’s just – his nature is such, his temperament is such

11:47.720 --> 11:51.249
that he just pleases people.

11:51.449 --> 11:56.546
This, when taken over again by Mister Ego,

11:56.746 --> 12:01.311
then really you can’t beat it. Then they become diplomats.

12:01.512 --> 12:07.379
You see, could be politicians, all
these doomed classes, they become

12:07.579 --> 12:09.746
and they cannot get out of it.

12:09.946 --> 12:13.668
They get so much used to it, that they cannot get out of it.

12:13.868 --> 12:20.199
Now what does the Devi do? She brings the truth before them.

12:20.399 --> 12:23.035
She shows that what you have been doing

12:23.235 --> 12:27.246
for a particular exploitation doesn’t work out.

12:27.446 --> 12:31.317
After a point it does. She exposes them.

12:31.517 --> 12:35.755
The exposure starts and with that exposure, they’re surprised,

12:35.955 --> 12:42.305
"How am I exposed? How am I caught, how people know?"

12:43.532 --> 12:48.394
This is the job of the power of Mahakali.

12:48.594 --> 12:53.737
She exposes all that is wrong, all that is falsehood,

12:53.937 --> 12:57.643
that is untruth, She exposes.

12:57.843 --> 13:04.535
Then the third desire people have is to possess material things,

13:04.735 --> 13:10.473
from which materialism has come.
But there’s no end to it.

13:10.673 --> 13:13.856
End can never come because

13:14.056 --> 13:17.879
they have no satisfaction in getting one thing.

13:18.079 --> 13:20.284
Supposing today I want to have this carpet.

13:20.484 --> 13:23.925
All right, I’ll get this one. Then I want to have another one.

13:24.125 --> 13:27.290
Then I want to have another one. Then I want to have a car

13:27.491 --> 13:29.541
and then I want to have a helicopter, then an aeroplane.

13:29.742 --> 13:34.475
I don’t know what I want to have then.
So it goes on and on and on and on

13:34.676 --> 13:38.734
until you reach a time where people start thinking,

13:38.934 --> 13:40.934
"What’s the matter with him?"

13:41.135 --> 13:45.109
And you cannot enjoy anything that you get.

13:45.309 --> 13:47.864
This is also a human failing

13:48.064 --> 13:52.520
and this human failing creates economics, you know that.

13:52.720 --> 13:59.101
Economics is created because wants, in general, are not satiable.

13:59.921 --> 14:02.057
They are not satiable.

14:02.257 --> 14:04.252
So what happens? We go on from jumping from one

14:04.452 --> 14:07.425
to another to another to another and another.

14:07.625 --> 14:13.855
So then you become slaves of entrepreneurs

14:14.055 --> 14:20.288
so much so, that you lose your individuality completely.

14:20.488 --> 14:27.606
For example, an entrepreneur produces
a funny kind of a dress, one year.

14:27.806 --> 14:31.911
So everybody wants to wear the same

14:32.111 --> 14:35.551
without thinking if it is necessary or not.

14:35.751 --> 14:40.639
Then he brings in another form.

14:40.839 --> 14:45.373
Next year everything is given up, buy the another one.

14:45.573 --> 14:52.782
Third year another one. So pile of all these clothes are there

14:52.982 --> 14:56.946
and nicely the manufacturer has become a great man of designs,

14:57.146 --> 15:00.530
his very good designs, how to befool human beings.

15:00.730 --> 15:03.108
He has become a rich man and you have become poor

15:03.308 --> 15:10.593
with all this kind of clothes which has no meaning for you anymore.

15:10.793 --> 15:15.894
About the same thing, about everything, something is fashionable.

15:16.949 --> 15:20.015
That means you have no individuality.

15:20.215 --> 15:22.328
We talk of individuality,

15:22.528 --> 15:26.179
but we want to do things which everybody’s doing.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.208
I mean, you know that all kinds of absurd things people have done

15:29.408 --> 15:32.591
in the name of fashion

15:32.791 --> 15:36.302
and specially people who are traditionally bound,

15:36.502 --> 15:40.218
who have had no traditions like Americans, I would say.

15:40.418 --> 15:44.764
They go on changing after every six months.

15:44.964 --> 15:48.914
Every year you go, you find a new type of people there,

15:49.114 --> 15:51.914
new type of clothes.

15:52.114 --> 15:55.094
It’s very surprising how they change so fast

15:55.294 --> 15:59.653
without even thinking whether this will suit me or not.

15:59.853 --> 16:02.684
Somebody says wear tight clothes, they’ll go with tight clothes.

16:02.884 --> 16:07.520
Then they develop varicose veins, so they wear with the holes.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.774
Then they develop some other problem,

16:10.975 --> 16:13.131
then they wear another kind.

16:13.332 --> 16:17.897
Nobody wants to think, "Why should I change my dress?"

16:18.097 --> 16:22.721
Like, say, in India we wear saris, finished.

16:22.921 --> 16:27.581
Nothing there. No problem with the tailor, nothing doing.

16:27.781 --> 16:30.171
Whatever sari we like, we’ll buy.

16:30.371 --> 16:34.296
And a sari came called as mini sari in India,

16:34.496 --> 16:37.384
which was up to here maybe, I don’t know, not six inches,

16:37.584 --> 16:40.245
but at least up to the knee.

16:40.445 --> 16:44.089
It came for about, I think, eight, seven days in Bombay

16:44.289 --> 16:49.085
and went back. People said, "Get lost. We don’t want it."

16:50.676 --> 16:57.421
So this headache of all the time getting into a fashion

16:57.621 --> 17:04.141
like horse without any sense in the head

17:04.341 --> 17:08.958
has to be understood properly.

17:10.135 --> 17:12.647
Why people do it? Because they have no brains.

17:12.847 --> 17:16.405
They’re brainless people.

17:16.605 --> 17:21.991
They’re not intelligent to see that we are befooled every year.

17:22.191 --> 17:27.523
But, for Sahaja Yogis, the Mahakali power works

17:27.723 --> 17:35.835
and She teaches them that "All right,
this dress suits you. Have this one."

17:36.035 --> 17:38.296
And it’s the best for you.

17:38.496 --> 17:42.445
Once for all, your lifelong problem is solved.

17:42.645 --> 17:47.239
With this kind of blouse, I started wearing from the very beginning perhaps

17:47.439 --> 17:52.931
and I’ve been wearing it and now I find everybody wears the same style.

17:54.314 --> 17:57.396
Why to waste your energy in changing every day this blouse

17:57.596 --> 18:02.428
starting from here to here, to here and going back again like this? You see.

18:02.628 --> 18:07.955
It’s such a waste of energy, such a waste of cloth.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.126
And we make ourselves so cheap running with the race

18:11.326 --> 18:15.033
of reducing the sleeves, reducing this, reducing that,

18:15.233 --> 18:18.248
all increasing.

18:19.436 --> 18:28.718
Is all a desire to impress people that we are very up to date.

18:29.413 --> 18:32.939
Who wants to know?

18:33.139 --> 18:38.648
Who wants to find out that you are up to date or not?

18:39.297 --> 18:45.355
And we have no courage to keep to
our own dress that we have purchased.

18:45.555 --> 18:48.152
Why to waste so much money? We don’t even think.

18:48.352 --> 18:53.605
Go on changing, changing, changing for nothing at all.

18:53.805 --> 18:57.352
So this is desire is there to impress others

18:57.552 --> 19:01.341
with our outside things.

19:01.841 --> 19:07.494
So many thing like dress there are, which we try to impress.

19:08.924 --> 19:13.103
Now, hairstyle.

19:14.580 --> 19:17.990
I read an article. They said that

19:18.190 --> 19:23.560
these hairstyles are responsible for many divorces.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.518
I was wondering, "How can it be hairstyles

19:26.719 --> 19:29.521
responsible for divorces?"

19:29.722 --> 19:32.780
Because they had made a survey.

19:32.980 --> 19:37.999
A man had liked a hairstyle of his fiancée

19:38.199 --> 19:43.441
and then she changed her hairstyle, so he divorced her.

19:44.676 --> 19:47.311
And the other way round.

19:47.511 --> 19:50.405
When it is so cheap way of disposing of

19:50.605 --> 19:55.386
such a deep relationship of husband and wife.

20:02.525 --> 20:06.212
Now certain facts start.

20:06.412 --> 20:13.587
I also saw one documentary about a lady

20:13.787 --> 20:19.302
who’d said that it was in one of the advertisements,

20:19.503 --> 20:21.930
something, sort of a thing appeared that your legs should be

20:22.130 --> 20:27.599
of this shape and what you should do.

20:27.799 --> 20:30.846
So poor thing spent so much time, energy,

20:31.047 --> 20:32.916
ran up and down to make the legs.

20:33.117 --> 20:36.169
I mean what is the importance of these legs, except for walking?

20:36.369 --> 20:39.411
So she went to make the shape like that.

20:39.611 --> 20:44.505
She used to measure it, would be always something missing here and there.

20:44.705 --> 20:48.326
Then many people joined. They had a class for it.

20:48.526 --> 20:52.956
And a group joined to make legs like that.

20:53.156 --> 20:59.633
And, ultimately, they found out that that leg was made out of wood.

21:00.951 --> 21:04.040
And they spent so much money, so much energy

21:04.240 --> 21:08.451
to make legs like that. For what?

21:08.927 --> 21:12.399
What is the purpose?

21:12.599 --> 21:16.579
If anybody says, "You run like this," they start running.

21:16.779 --> 21:22.647
They say, "Jump like this," they start jumping. But why?

21:23.413 --> 21:25.994
Have we gone all nuts in our heads

21:26.194 --> 21:31.119
that we should accept whatever one says, we start doing that.

21:31.319 --> 21:34.572
What is the purpose?

21:34.773 --> 21:38.315
So this kind of stupidity comes in our heads

21:38.515 --> 21:40.815
when we start using our ego.

21:41.015 --> 21:46.484
With the ego a person becomes absolutely stupid.

21:47.036 --> 21:57.668
Because he’ll say, "What’s wrong? What’s wrong if I,

21:57.869 --> 22:04.322
if I have just a little hair here? What’s wrong?

22:04.522 --> 22:14.963
If I just try to wear a very short dress here, what’s wrong?"

22:15.463 --> 22:19.794
The wrong is why are you wearing?

22:19.994 --> 22:25.000
Why don’t you ask a question? Why are you wearing?

22:25.200 --> 22:29.563
If you ask a question to yourself, "Why do I have this kind of hairstyle?"

22:29.763 --> 22:33.801
"Why do I do like this?"

22:34.231 --> 22:38.414
It is really difficult to tell people to do right things,

22:38.614 --> 22:43.023
but wrong things people take to like that.

22:43.223 --> 22:48.584
For example, I told everyone that you put oil, if not every day,

22:48.785 --> 22:53.164
just before bath, a lot of oil in your hair and wash.

22:53.364 --> 22:57.642
Now I find many people getting bald.

22:58.259 --> 23:02.981
But they didn’t put the oil. What can I do about it?

23:03.181 --> 23:08.676
But such a simple thing they won’t have.

23:09.285 --> 23:12.280
Such a simple thing they would not believe,

23:12.480 --> 23:15.400
that you need something for your nourishment.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.697
But they will do something which is absurd,

23:18.897 --> 23:26.031
nonsensical without even thinking, "What is going to harm us."

23:27.023 --> 23:30.479
Here the Mahakali, what does She do?

23:30.679 --> 23:33.807
She punishes you.

23:34.007 --> 23:38.878
Your body is punished. If you wear very tight clothes,

23:39.078 --> 23:42.253
you develop problems of your legs.

23:42.453 --> 23:49.401
If you wear holey pants, then you get cramps.

23:49.601 --> 23:54.227
Anything you do abnormal, you have to pay for it.

23:54.427 --> 23:56.922
First you have to pay for doing it

23:57.122 --> 24:02.083
and then you have to pay for it physically.

24:02.544 --> 24:08.359
So many things can be avoided if we just had a simple life,

24:08.559 --> 24:11.132
decide once for all that

24:11.332 --> 24:16.870
"I will have this kind of dress for this lifetime, finished."

24:18.620 --> 24:23.405
Every day to change, itself, is a headache.

24:23.605 --> 24:28.214
But that satisfied the ego, not your Self.

24:29.183 --> 24:36.412
So the Mahalaxmi Principle in us raises higher and higher.

24:36.612 --> 24:41.096
Despite that, we are pulled down.

24:41.948 --> 24:47.541
Then this Mahakali, She comes forward

24:47.741 --> 24:52.213
and shows what wrong we have done,

24:52.413 --> 24:59.881
how we have gone wrong,
how we have missed the point.

25:01.319 --> 25:08.876
Instead of thinking what is wrong,
She teaches you, "It is wrong."

25:10.618 --> 25:13.670
Then another thing She does, which is a very beautiful thing She does,

25:13.870 --> 25:20.654
I think sometimes, that She creates an illusion

25:20.854 --> 25:26.495
to test your intelligence, to test your sensibility.

25:26.695 --> 25:30.971
She creates an illusion. Branti rupena samstita.

25:31.171 --> 25:35.959
She makes a branti in your head. Illusion.

25:36.159 --> 25:39.108
So you become illusive

25:39.308 --> 25:43.904
or others become illusive or a situation becomes illusive.

25:44.104 --> 25:47.060
And you are lost in it.

25:47.260 --> 25:54.224
Then you really understand that it’s wrong thing I have done.

25:54.424 --> 25:58.752
It’s a very nice story about Narada.

25:58.952 --> 26:04.862
Narada was under an impression about himself

26:05.062 --> 26:10.146
and ultimately he became ego-oriented and he started saying,

26:10.347 --> 26:14.124
"Oh, look at me. I am never enticed by any woman.

26:14.324 --> 26:18.624
Even Shiva was enticed by Cupid. I am never enticed.

26:18.824 --> 26:23.740
I am the highest of highest, Brahmachari."

26:23.940 --> 26:31.554
So Vishnu sent two gandharvas to entice him.

26:31.754 --> 26:34.570
So they met him in a forest and told him,

26:34.770 --> 26:37.796
"Oh, Narada, you are such a handsome man,

26:37.996 --> 26:41.797
such a beautiful man and all your beauty’s wasted.

26:41.997 --> 26:44.352
You must test your beauty. You must see how beautiful you are.

26:44.552 --> 26:47.555
You’re so handsome."

26:47.755 --> 26:50.454
He said, "Really?" "Yes. There’s a very simple way of testing you."

26:50.654 --> 26:55.547
"It’s how?" They said, "There’s a

26:55.747 --> 26:59.508
wedding coming up of a very beautiful woman.

26:59.708 --> 27:09.050
She is the princess of the beauty city, is called Roop Nagar,

27:09.250 --> 27:13.949
and you should go there and see how she will appreciate you.

27:14.149 --> 27:20.980
So he, in his ego, became so stupid that he went there.

27:21.180 --> 27:25.160
And he was sitting and lots of people were coming,

27:25.360 --> 27:28.227
big big maharajas, rajas, all of them were sitting

27:28.428 --> 27:33.105
and he was thinking, "Oh, I’m the
best among all of them. Who are these?

27:33.305 --> 27:36.500
The princess will just garland me, no doubt about it."

27:36.700 --> 27:42.586
And these two were putting that illusion in his head, branti.

27:42.786 --> 27:46.504
With the Agnya, you get branti.

27:46.704 --> 27:51.918
This princess came round. She
looked at him and she laughed aloud.

27:52.118 --> 27:56.013
She couldn’t control herself and she moved on giggling.

27:56.213 --> 27:58.544
He couldn’t understand why she laughed at him.

27:58.744 --> 28:03.130
She didn’t garland him or nothing but she just laughed.

28:03.330 --> 28:06.832
So he couldn’t understand, "I’m such a handsome man," this thing.

28:07.032 --> 28:10.355
So these two gandharvas told him, "Oh, it doesn’t matter.

28:10.555 --> 28:14.066
You see, she doesn’t understand. She’ll come back," this, that.

28:14.266 --> 28:17.550
Then they went out and near a lake and he sat down

28:17.750 --> 28:22.316
to wash his face and looked at in the water his reflection.

28:22.516 --> 28:26.970
He looked like a monkey.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.278
He looked at these two and he cursed them.

28:30.478 --> 28:32.516
He said, "I look like a monkey."

28:32.717 --> 28:36.197
Said, "To us, you look like very handsome."

28:36.397 --> 28:40.658
"But I really look like a monkey."

28:40.858 --> 28:47.552
So this branti, this illusion was created in his mind by his ego.

28:47.752 --> 28:50.881
But this power, itself, Mahakali’s power,

28:51.081 --> 28:58.339
She puts this ego right by creating illusion, branti.

29:00.855 --> 29:07.477
And this is responsible for many illusions we run after.

29:07.677 --> 29:13.732
It’s a mirage, running after it, running after it.

29:14.492 --> 29:19.198
Once we are satisfied within ourselves,

29:19.398 --> 29:25.437
then we don’t run after mirages.

29:25.984 --> 29:28.186
This illusion, if it would not be created,

29:28.386 --> 29:34.101
people would be so egoistical that whole world will be finished.

29:35.035 --> 29:40.921
So this is the great work of Mahakali Power within us,

29:41.121 --> 29:44.703
that She creates illusions.

29:44.903 --> 29:47.617
Many people talk of maya. "This is Mother, maya.

29:47.817 --> 29:51.281
This is maya. That is maya."

29:51.481 --> 29:54.432
Is the work of Mahakali.

29:54.632 --> 29:57.960
She wants to test you.

29:58.265 --> 30:06.153
She wants to test you. But in Sahaja Yoga it’s not such a strong one.

30:06.353 --> 30:09.388
For example, you know Abraham had a son.

30:09.588 --> 30:13.997
One son he had after a long time.

30:14.197 --> 30:18.726
And God asked him that he should sacrifice his son.

30:18.926 --> 30:21.543
His wife said also was feeling terrible that

30:21.744 --> 30:25.219
he has to sacrifice his son.

30:25.420 --> 30:31.384
So he went down to the place where the child was to be sacrificed.

30:31.584 --> 30:35.389
He made a fire, everything and was about to put the child

30:35.589 --> 30:40.943
on that pyre of fire when the voice came.

30:41.143 --> 30:45.102
This is Mahakali,

30:45.302 --> 30:50.076
that you don’t have to sacrifice your child.

30:50.599 --> 30:54.079
We have many such stories in Indian mythology also

30:54.279 --> 30:58.064
where they were tested.

30:58.264 --> 31:05.256
So to test Sahaja Yogis also, this Mahakali helps you.

31:06.812 --> 31:11.260
There was a gentleman who was very egoistical,

31:11.460 --> 31:13.901
so I told him to come to Delhi

31:14.101 --> 31:17.430
because I didn’t know how to do it here.

31:17.630 --> 31:19.797
He came to Delhi and he told everybody, "See,

31:19.997 --> 31:23.407
Mother told me to come here just to cure Her."

31:23.607 --> 31:28.387
I said, "All right." He came. I said, "What’s wrong with Me?"

31:28.587 --> 31:31.465
He said, "Mother, Your Nabhi is very bad." I said, "Really?

31:31.665 --> 31:34.715
Acha, you put a bandhan to yourself and now see for yourself."

31:34.915 --> 31:37.245
"Oh my God, you see, what’s happening to me here?"

31:37.445 --> 31:41.376
I said, "That’s My Nabhi."

31:41.576 --> 31:45.298
So this is how the illusion corrects you.

31:45.498 --> 31:49.483
If there is no illusion, you would not ever be corrected directly.

31:49.683 --> 31:54.779
Supposing I say, "Don’t do this." You may not like.

31:54.979 --> 32:00.363
Of yourse, mostly you like, but sometimes you don’t.

32:00.563 --> 32:05.331
And then the illusion works and then you realize,

32:05.531 --> 32:11.223
"Where was I and where am I now? I should not have done this.

32:11.423 --> 32:14.731
How is it I have landed into this problem?

32:14.931 --> 32:19.307
What has made me so stupid?"

32:19.507 --> 32:24.288
So this is something which She does.

32:25.054 --> 32:30.444
Another is She’s the one who relaxes you completely.

32:30.644 --> 32:36.895
When you are tired and fed up, when you don’t know what to do,

32:37.095 --> 32:42.708
then She makes you sleep. She’s the one who gives you sleep.

32:42.908 --> 32:45.528
All day’s work you do,

32:45.728 --> 32:51.089
ultimately the Mahakali power acts on you as sleep.

32:51.289 --> 32:55.862
She makes you sleep, sleep like a child.

32:56.062 --> 33:00.766
You know, at that time, all that wrong we have done to ourselves

33:00.966 --> 33:04.574
and to others are forgiven.

33:04.774 --> 33:07.463
In Her lap we sleep nicely,

33:07.664 --> 33:13.761
quietly and all our problems are solved.

33:14.982 --> 33:23.564
In those dreams, when you are, She brings forth solutions to you.

33:23.764 --> 33:26.871
I know so many people told Me, "Mother, you came in my dream

33:27.071 --> 33:30.980
and told me that this is the medicine you should take.

33:31.180 --> 33:34.379
You came in my dream and You told me that

33:34.579 --> 33:39.474
this particular type of life will suit you."

33:39.674 --> 33:43.701
They see Me clearly coming, but there it is not whole of Me,

33:43.901 --> 33:47.793
but I think the Mahakali Power acts.

33:47.993 --> 33:53.816
Into very deep sleep you are, it is called, at the Sushupti.

33:54.016 --> 33:58.504
There She appears. One lady came to me and she said,

33:58.704 --> 34:01.688
"Mother, You came in the dream and you said that

34:01.889 --> 34:05.501
I’m here in Bombay. Nobody told me."

34:05.701 --> 34:08.083
So so many things happen like this.

34:08.283 --> 34:14.044
In the dream She guides you and tells you.

34:14.244 --> 34:16.708
Now what happens sometimes,

34:16.908 --> 34:19.995
people tell Me that I had such and such dream,

34:20.195 --> 34:23.109
which is all falsehood, I know.

34:23.309 --> 34:26.640
They never dreamt like that. They never saw like this.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.050
But, just to impress Me, they tell Me that,

34:29.250 --> 34:33.068
"Oh, I had a dream," this, that.

34:33.268 --> 34:37.729
I just show complete ignorance. I ask, "Must be?"

34:38.781 --> 34:43.003
Then they are put into again branti, means illusion.

34:43.203 --> 34:48.382
Gradually, they realize that

34:48.582 --> 34:53.090
it was wrong to tell lies to Mother.

34:53.785 --> 34:57.671
So the correction part takes place,

34:57.871 --> 35:01.897
but the greatest thing that She does

35:02.097 --> 35:10.050
is to give you the sense of chastity and security.

35:10.250 --> 35:13.855
When the children are born, they have sense of chastity,

35:14.055 --> 35:18.826
shame, decency, decorous behaviour.

35:19.026 --> 35:21.959
But gradually, when they start others misbehaving,

35:22.159 --> 35:28.338
they start misbehaving. To them, decency becomes a bondage.

35:29.083 --> 35:32.501
But, naturally, She’s there to tell you that

35:32.701 --> 35:37.657
"This is indecent. You shouldn’t do it. This is wrong.

35:37.857 --> 35:41.208
This is not the proper thing to do."

35:41.408 --> 35:44.232
But gradually, you grow up and mature,

35:44.432 --> 35:48.510
then you go, "What’s wrong?"

35:49.264 --> 35:55.298
You start disrespecting your chastity

35:55.498 --> 36:03.164
and you start becoming like immature, stupid people.

36:03.364 --> 36:10.529
All this, if is understood through meditation,

36:10.729 --> 36:14.365
the Mahakali helps you a lot.

36:14.565 --> 36:21.854
In meditation, She helps you a lot,
because She’s the one who creates

36:22.054 --> 36:26.479
the proper passage for Kundalini to rise.

36:26.679 --> 36:30.496
Mahakali is the same as the Kundalini

36:30.696 --> 36:36.480
because She is the residual energy of Mahakali Power,

36:36.680 --> 36:41.659
full of it there. But the function is different.

36:41.859 --> 36:46.081
The function of Mahakali is to protect you,

36:46.281 --> 36:50.352
is to guide you, to give you wisdom.

36:50.552 --> 36:54.320
And the function of the Kundalini is to cleanse you,

36:54.520 --> 36:58.180
to clear it out, not to play about with you,

36:58.380 --> 37:03.893
to forgive you and help you to grow properly.

37:04.093 --> 37:07.549
Now in your life, as Sahaja Yogis, you will see

37:07.749 --> 37:11.716
how Mahakali helps you in every way.

37:11.916 --> 37:15.529
It is so interesting to watch Her work,

37:15.729 --> 37:22.450
how She brings forth all kinds of satisfactions to you.

37:22.650 --> 37:26.161
The greed goes away. The temptations go away.

37:26.361 --> 37:30.149
The temper goes away. All these things disappear.

37:30.350 --> 37:34.645
The most helpful thing She does,

37:34.845 --> 37:39.635
that you get rid of your bad habits. Absolutely.

37:39.835 --> 37:44.346
Automatically, in the light of Mahakali’s power,

37:44.546 --> 37:51.796
you just do not want anything destructive to be practised.

37:51.996 --> 37:58.182
If you have been practising anything
destructive, you try to get rid of it.

37:58.382 --> 38:01.112
Just you stop it. "I don’t want to have it."

38:01.312 --> 38:03.995
I never tell you, "Don’t do this. Don’t do that."

38:04.195 --> 38:07.001
It’s the Mahakali power within you which is awakened,

38:07.201 --> 38:11.189
does all these things. And She has made you so beautiful,

38:11.389 --> 38:18.457
so angelic. She has, by Her corrections and by Her illusions,

38:18.657 --> 38:20.879
She has made you like this.

38:21.079 --> 38:29.838
So you don’t get so much attached to money, to greed, to lust,

38:30.038 --> 38:36.634
all these things which are responsible for putting you down.

38:36.834 --> 38:41.095
Also possessiveness for children, possessiveness for husband,

38:41.295 --> 38:43.915
possessiveness of matter.

38:44.115 --> 38:48.639
You just start understanding that the joy is in sharing.

38:48.839 --> 38:54.194
You want to share everything with others and that sharing starts

38:54.394 --> 39:00.668
when these Mahakali Powers start giving you blessings

39:00.868 --> 39:06.184
of joy, of sharing,

39:06.384 --> 39:14.167
of being collective, of being pure.

39:14.367 --> 39:20.456
These blessings come to you from the Mahalakshmi Power, Mahakali Power.

39:20.657 --> 39:24.081
So today we are going to worship that Mahakali power.

39:24.281 --> 39:26.937
May God bless you.
