00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.978
And this is what it is that when you are realized you have to give it.

00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:16.669
If you don’t give it then you stagnate,

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:24.924
you stagnate and there is no fragrance about it, no fragrance, no fragrance.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:30.630
And you lose your vibrations. Your progress also retires.

00:00:31.087 --> 00:00:34.827
I know it’s very hard in these modern times

00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:39.626
to create a group of people who can love.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.306
You can create a group of people who can hate.

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:49.117
Supposing tomorrow you start one big procession,

00:00:49.197 --> 00:00:53.101
“We hate God. We hate love. We hate this,”

00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:55.736
you’ll get thousands of them standing with you,

00:00:55.816 --> 00:00:57.541
“Yes, oh, we hate,” you see.

00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:00.898
For hatred you’ll get thousands of them with banners, you know.

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.151
They’ll pay for it and come down to show that they hate,

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:11.047
because hatred is a very cementing force among human beings, surprisingly.

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:12.852
Hatred is a cementing force.

00:01:12.932 --> 00:01:19.599
It looks like something, such a contrast, but it is so.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:25.767
I mean, when you try to collect people in the name of hatred, people join.

00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:29.670
They have never exploited the powers of love, never.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.109
I wish they had.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.839
All our wars, all our things have come out because we hate each other.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:39.607
Imagine, only human beings can hate that much.

00:01:39.687 --> 00:01:42.593
Animals can’t hate so much as they can.

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:46.414
So this love, which is divine love,

00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:52.098
which thinks, which coordinates, which understands, which is dynamic,

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:56.224
it’s so fantastic, it’s so all-pervading,

00:01:56.304 --> 00:02:02.455
it lives in every particle of the matter,

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:06.116
of the emotions, of the mind, of the heart.

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:14.298
Everywhere it exists that power you can have within yourself.

00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:16.093
It’s too much to believe.

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:19.930
Too much a tall story for anyone, but this is the fact.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.343
The time has come.

00:02:22.623 --> 00:02:26.675
It could not be done earlier, I agreed, but the time has come.

00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:31.752
You have evolved to that state and that’s why it has to happen.

00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:37.023
Now if people do not accept, I must say this, futuristic problem,

00:02:37.537 --> 00:02:42.424
in case human beings do not accept it in a big number and become that,

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:44.925
we cannot avoid the third world war.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:49.756
By that war a new consciousness may rise

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:53.107
where people will understand this hatred is the worse thing.

00:02:53.187 --> 00:02:55.844
Perhaps we need a third shock; we have had two.

00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:59.008
Perhaps we need a third shock, to give us that elevation,

00:02:59.088 --> 00:03:03.233
to get that position of higher consciousness,

00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:11.337
where we start realizing that this thing’s based on materialistic and on hatred,

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:16.852
gross living, is most dangerous to humanity.

00:03:16.932 --> 00:03:21.921
Then such people who really believe in love will rise and come up

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.246
and they might be the ones who will be saved.

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:29.181
So we should at this stage try to save as many as possible

00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:35.428
from this horrible sinking maya of hatred.

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:39.274
Now talking about it has been done.

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:44.390
Establishment of your sustenance has been done in the sense

00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.702
that if you can awaken that sustenance within you,

00:03:47.782 --> 00:03:51.780
on the void, you can achieve it.

00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:57.912
But main thing is even after Realization

00:03:57.992 --> 00:04:01.799
to identify yourself as a Realized soul, absolutely,

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.084
that you are being given something very special,

00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:07.764
that you have your Spirit, which is manifesting

00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:10.238
and that you have to make good out of it,

00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:13.671
that you have to give it to others, that you have to work it out,

00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:15.366
you have to be a collective being,

00:04:15.446 --> 00:04:19.979
and not a secluded person just attached to few minds,

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:27.170
my house, my husband, my wife, my children, my chair,

00:04:28.276 --> 00:04:32.434
you can say, my hair, my nose, everything, whatsoever.

00:04:32.514 --> 00:04:37.024
To reduce yourself to that small world but to expand yourself

00:04:37.137 --> 00:04:40.942
to that great world which is Jehovah’s world,

00:04:41.022 --> 00:04:42.721
which is Krishna’s world,

00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:44.370
which is Virata’s world,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.042
where you become one with that primordial being,

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:53.450
where you become an active cell of that primordial being,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.191
that’s the thing one has to do.

00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:58.506
And that breakthrough has to take place.

00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:04.349
Now one may say that all the Scriptures are wrong, everything is wrong,

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.259
that all these manifestations are wrong,

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.116
Christ was no good, that He was not practical,

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:15.317
anything one may say, there’s – I mean, you have freedom to say what you like.

00:05:15.397 --> 00:05:22.631
But you must have wisdom to see that if there is a way, what must be the way?

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:27.887
If there is a way for the emancipation of human beings there is only one way;

00:05:27.975 --> 00:05:31.733
there’s no other way. I mean, whatever you may be, an intellectual or

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.213
say, a emotional person or anything, whatever it is,

00:05:36.293 --> 00:05:38.424
but you will reach one conclusion.

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:43.703
There’s only one way and one way is transformation of human beings

00:05:44.296 --> 00:05:50.352
to that level where they really say what they mean. They become.

00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:53.843
They talk of world-wide brotherhood. They talk of everything.

00:05:53.923 --> 00:05:58.036
We have all kinds of organisations doing all this nonsensical work, you see.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.315
We have U.N. system, and we have World Government ideas.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:05.318
We talk of love, helping Vietnamese, this, that.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.204
All sorts of things are there.

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:10.137
But actually we are not.

00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:12.489
Face to face we are not.

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.962
Face to face we become ourselves

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:21.796
and that’s why to become that, the becoming of it is important;

00:06:21.876 --> 00:06:24.739
the transformation is important.

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.792
Once you are transformed to identify yourself with that transformed state

00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:33.712
is also important and that is only possible

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:39.164
when you start allowing that transformation to take place within you,

00:06:39.244 --> 00:06:43.263
in thoughtless awareness where you do not think and impose things on you.

00:06:43.344 --> 00:06:45.324
People get their Realization, all right.

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:49.263
Last time so many got it. I do not know how many came back.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.066
And then they do not think that there is any further is needed,

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:55.835
because once you get your Realization

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.716
you can be very in a joyous state, blissful state.

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:01.017
You might feel the vibrations very well,

00:07:01.097 --> 00:07:03.306
you’ll be very happy and then you’ll get lost.

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:05.166
That’s not the point.

00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:07.459
You have not achieved your complete growth

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:10.365
unless and until you have manifested your self.

00:07:10.445 --> 00:07:13.704
But such people may be very few, I do not know,

00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:18.424
may be very few who will really take to that maturity.

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.746
Once you have matured is joy, is happiness.

00:07:21.826 --> 00:07:26.973
You become what you have to become, you find your absolute meaning

00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:28.733
and that has to happen.
