04:54.291 --> 05:03.542
Today it’s a great day because Sahasrara day and

05:03.542 --> 05:07.917
Mother’s day have come together.

05:08.542 --> 05:14.333
That’s a very Sahaj happening, I think,

05:17.291 --> 05:21.625
and that is what we have to understand,

05:22.667 --> 05:30.792
how Sahasrara and the motherhood go together.

05:36.834 --> 05:43.542
Sahasrara was definitely opened

05:46.583 --> 05:50.250
and Mother had to do it,

05:52.834 --> 06:00.250
because formerly those people who came on this earth

06:01.667 --> 06:08.083
tried to teach people about Dharma,

06:08.792 --> 06:11.834
to bring them to the central path,

06:11.834 --> 06:15.959
to the straightforward path of ascent.

06:16.917 --> 06:19.125
They tried everything,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.709
whatever way they thought was good for a particular community,

06:24.083 --> 06:27.333
particular area, particular country.

06:27.667 --> 06:33.375
They talked about it and lots of books came out of it.

06:33.834 --> 06:46.667
But instead of all these books creating people of religious,

06:48.250 --> 06:53.709
spiritual and a united nature,

06:53.709 --> 06:58.667
created people who were all against each other.

06:58.667 --> 07:04.125
Absurd, it’s an absurd thing, but it happened.

07:04.458 --> 07:08.625
So all these books that were written,

07:08.625 --> 07:16.041
all this knowledge that was given, was all misused by human beings

07:16.041 --> 07:24.500
just to get their own power, I should say;

07:24.959 --> 07:31.917
so it was all a power-orientated, also money-orientated, game going on.

07:32.250 --> 07:41.375
When we see the outcome of all these religions, we feel it’s all empty.

07:41.375 --> 07:52.208
They talk of love, they talk of compassion but it is all for a purpose.

07:52.625 --> 07:56.458
It is all a political game sometimes,

07:57.333 --> 08:03.458
because they still feel that they should have power,

08:03.959 --> 08:07.500
not the spiritual power but the worldly power,

08:07.500 --> 08:11.250
so that they can dominate the whole world.

08:11.959 --> 08:18.166
So this domination started working so much in the human mind

08:18.625 --> 08:23.750
that we had lots of wars, killings, all kinds of things.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
And when it subsided I felt that now,

08:30.000 --> 08:36.834
maybe, opening Sahasrara might help people to see the truth.

08:36.834 --> 08:43.000
At the level of Sahasrara, you know the truth.

08:44.166 --> 08:51.917
So all kinds of illusions, all kinds of misunderstandings,

08:51.917 --> 09:01.834
all kinds of self-imposed ignorance, they all have to disappear.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.917
Because what you know is the truth.

09:07.583 --> 09:14.583
The truth is not sharp, it’s not harsh,

09:14.959 --> 09:21.500
it is not something which is difficult to assimilate.

09:21.917 --> 09:28.291
People thought truth must be something that would be just very

09:28.959 --> 09:33.834
damaging or could be very harsh,

09:33.834 --> 09:39.750
could create problems between human beings, which it should not have,

09:40.041 --> 09:44.375
it should not have, it was not meant to be.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.000
But whenever they talked of truth

09:47.000 --> 09:51.959
the people used it for a wrong purpose.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.625
It’s something special about human beings

09:54.875 --> 10:05.750
that they start using things for a wrong attitude, for a wrong message,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.583
and try to use it for their own purpose.

10:09.583 --> 10:13.709
It’s such a common thing with human beings

10:13.709 --> 10:17.625
that they want to have power over other men.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.458
Now I’ve seen in My own country when

10:20.458 --> 10:24.750
people wanted to have separate nations.

10:25.125 --> 10:30.000
Those people who wanted to have separate nations actually did it,

10:30.000 --> 10:35.041
not to achieve anything great but just because they can become,

10:35.417 --> 10:38.291
those people who wanted, few of them,

10:38.291 --> 10:42.166
they'll become something great in their own country.

10:42.417 --> 10:45.709
So they never wanted to be in a country where

10:45.709 --> 10:48.417
they may not rise to that height.

10:48.709 --> 10:53.166
So then, they separated those countries and by separating I have seen

10:53.166 --> 10:58.125
all these countries are suffering, suffering very much.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.291
There’s no growth, there are financial problems,

11:01.291 --> 11:03.500
all kinds of problems are there and

11:03.500 --> 11:09.709
also the main country is suffering because they have now developed

11:09.709 --> 11:15.041
enmity and all this is working out against the main country.

11:15.041 --> 11:20.999
So to have a separatist idea itself is against Sahaj.

11:20.999 --> 11:27.959
Say, for example, a flower growing on the tree looks very nice,

11:28.291 --> 11:33.625
it develops there, matures there and it produces seeds also.

11:33.625 --> 11:40.709
But supposing you cut the flower and take it away, then what happens?

11:40.709 --> 11:43.333
The tree loses the flower, no doubt,

11:43.333 --> 11:47.500
but mostly it is the loss of the flower.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.375
Now this they did, all of them, and when they did it,

11:51.625 --> 11:53.709
you see, what is the result?

11:53.709 --> 12:03.917
That people who tried to have their own country, their own domain,

12:04.125 --> 12:11.583
they were killed, murdered, abused and some of them are in jail.

12:11.583 --> 12:16.041
So the attitude, even outside Sahaja Yoga,

12:16.041 --> 12:19.333
has shown that it doesn’t help.

12:19.625 --> 12:25.458
So we must learn to be one.

12:25.458 --> 12:30.166
If after Sahaja Yoga, after your realization,

12:30.166 --> 12:36.709
if you do not understand this message that we all have to be one,

12:36.709 --> 12:40.500
one single unit, one single body;

12:40.500 --> 12:45.250
if we cannot be, if you are identified with other things,

12:45.250 --> 12:50.750
then it’s no way you have grown, you have not matured.

12:50.750 --> 12:54.709
A very important point on Sahasrara day, one has to understand,

12:54.709 --> 13:00.041
that all the seven chakras have their peethas in the Sahasrara.

13:00.041 --> 13:02.041
All the seven chakras.

13:02.041 --> 13:06.959
They are nicely settled down in the midriff of your brain

13:06.959 --> 13:14.458
and they act through that area, wherever they are,

13:14.458 --> 13:17.500
on the chakras and work it out.

13:17.500 --> 13:23.834
Now all these seven chakras become one,

13:23.834 --> 13:26.375
I should say, or go into unison.

13:26.375 --> 13:33.166
Complete integration takes place in these centers.

13:33.166 --> 13:41.125
Because these are governed by these seven main chakras,

13:41.125 --> 13:43.959
we can call them, you can call them by any name,

13:43.959 --> 13:47.000
and they govern all the other chakras

13:47.000 --> 13:51.875
and because they are in unison, completely integrated,

13:51.875 --> 13:56.291
that’s why all your chakras are integrated.

13:56.291 --> 14:05.999
Is the peethas which are enlightened, I should say, by Kundalini,

14:06.250 --> 14:15.250
also blessed by the Divine power, immediately become integrated.

14:15.625 --> 14:20.250
They say that like pearls in one string.

14:20.250 --> 14:24.709
It’s even more than that, it’s more than that,

14:24.999 --> 14:31.208
all these peethas within you get integrated in such a manner

14:31.208 --> 14:37.291
as if there’s no difference in their manifestation.

14:37.291 --> 14:44.417
Supposing you have a chakra which is not alright,

14:44.417 --> 14:46.792
something wrong physically, mentally, emotionally,

14:46.792 --> 14:49.667
whatever it is, the other chakras try

14:49.667 --> 15:00.291
to help this sick chakra and try to evolve a personality

15:00.291 --> 15:05.041
of a Sahaja Yogi in a way that he’s integrated.

15:05.041 --> 15:08.999
Now integration within yourself is very important,

15:08.999 --> 15:12.208
unless and until you are integrated within yourself

15:12.500 --> 15:15.166
you cannot be integrated outside.

15:15.166 --> 15:17.625
And the within yourself the integration

15:17.625 --> 15:21.208
is such a blessing of Sahaja Yoga that a person

15:21.208 --> 15:28.542
who gets this realization becomes a personality

15:28.542 --> 15:33.417
which is above the normal personality.

15:33.417 --> 15:38.999
It is not attached to all the negative forces,

15:38.999 --> 15:40.875
the destructive forces.

15:40.875 --> 15:45.125
It just gives up so many things

15:45.125 --> 15:49.250
which normally very difficult to give up.

15:49.250 --> 15:53.375
All these seven chakras, that we have within ourselves,

15:53.375 --> 15:59.875
are then guided by these peethas in unison.

16:00.417 --> 16:04.959
Just the help that comes from this unison

16:04.959 --> 16:09.542
helps all the chakras to get completely integrated.

16:09.542 --> 16:12.291
As it is we are not integrated because

16:12.291 --> 16:18.834
our mind goes on one side, our body goes on another side,

16:19.041 --> 16:23.291
our heart goes on another side, our emotions are different.

16:23.291 --> 16:27.542
We do not know which is the right thing to do,

16:27.875 --> 16:30.166
what is the best thing to do.

16:30.166 --> 16:33.625
But after realization, in the light of the Spirit,

16:33.875 --> 16:38.041
you get the truth and you know what is to be done.

16:38.291 --> 16:41.542
For example, after self realization

16:41.875 --> 16:45.542
you can judge people on their vibrations.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.709
You don’t have to use your brains for that,

16:47.709 --> 16:49.250
just on your vibrations,

16:49.250 --> 16:55.750
immediately you know what’s wrong with yourself and with others.

16:55.750 --> 17:01.875
So here it is a double correction, one is you see your own being,

17:01.875 --> 17:05.166
your own self, your self knowledge comes to you

17:05.166 --> 17:08.667
and secondly you can also make out another person,

17:08.667 --> 17:10.875
what sort of a thing he’s done.

17:10.875 --> 17:14.959
If somebody is not Sahaj and claims to be Sahaj,

17:15.166 --> 17:18.500
you can easily find out that he’s not Sahaj,

17:18.500 --> 17:20.500
his behaviour is not Sahaj.

17:20.500 --> 17:24.542
So the best thing is for all of us is

17:24.542 --> 17:29.667
to get this integration absolutely working out within ourselves.

17:29.667 --> 17:34.166
We should not shun it but we should accept that

17:34.166 --> 17:38.875
whatever defects we had, whatever wrong we have been doing,

17:38.875 --> 17:45.500
what wrong thinking we had, whatever destructive we had taken to,

17:45.750 --> 17:51.750
all this has to disappear because you are Sahaja Yogis.

17:51.750 --> 17:57.375
Sahaja Yogis have a special job to be done.

17:57.375 --> 18:02.041
They’re not like other people who are just working for money,

18:02.291 --> 18:05.542
working for power, working for domination.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.625
You are not.

18:06.625 --> 18:12.291
You are working in Sahaja Yoga for the emancipation of humanity.

18:12.291 --> 18:16.625
So whole thing is that this Sahasrara

18:16.875 --> 18:22.166
is a global field where we enter in.

18:22.417 --> 18:29.041
We enter into a global field and when we are there we just become,

18:29.041 --> 18:31.667
ourselves, a global personality.

18:31.667 --> 18:36.333
So all these minor things like your race, your country,

18:36.625 --> 18:40.166
your religion and all these,

18:40.166 --> 18:43.667
which are artificial barriers between human beings,

18:43.667 --> 18:48.083
just drops out and you become a realized soul,

18:48.083 --> 18:53.083
and you know what is humanity, you understand the humanity.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.625
This has to happen in all the Sahaja Yogis.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.291
When they are together.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.458
They should understand that we are not,

19:00.750 --> 19:03.083
no more ordinary human beings,

19:03.083 --> 19:06.792
we are special people chosen for a very special work

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
which is the most important thing today.

19:10.291 --> 19:13.750
Now, as you know what is going on in Kali yuga,

19:13.999 --> 19:16.333
I need not describe all that to you,

19:16.333 --> 19:21.417
but what is the light of the Spirit which is going to show you

19:21.667 --> 19:27.000
what you can do to remove the ills of Kali Yuga.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.333
Starting right from yourself,

19:30.667 --> 19:33.917
you just see for yourself with great amusement,

19:33.917 --> 19:37.083
what you have been doing was all stupid.

19:37.417 --> 19:40.417
You should not have done that but you have been doing,

19:40.417 --> 19:42.999
so it’s alright, you can forgive others who are doing it.

19:42.999 --> 19:46.917
And you’ll understand that those who have been doing it

19:46.917 --> 19:49.875
have been doing all this out of ignorance.

19:49.875 --> 19:53.750
But now you have your Sahasrara open.

19:53.750 --> 19:56.792
In the open Sahasrara you are getting,

19:57.041 --> 20:02.041
or the Divine is pouring Its grace all the time.

20:02.333 --> 20:08.208
With that reception, with that, we should say,

20:08.500 --> 20:11.542
the nourishing of your Sahasrara,

20:11.792 --> 20:15.083
what happens is something really great.

20:15.083 --> 20:19.542
One thing happens that you get detached from yourself,

20:19.542 --> 20:22.999
you can see yourself, you can see your past,

20:22.999 --> 20:25.917
you can understand yourself that you have been doing

20:25.917 --> 20:32.208
so many wrong things and misunderstanding people.

20:32.542 --> 20:38.166
This sometimes takes you too far away from yourself.

20:38.166 --> 20:42.542
But once this light comes and the Sahasrara is nourished,

20:42.542 --> 20:45.333
in that light you see clearly

20:45.625 --> 20:48.208
what wrong you have been doing to yourself.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.041
Then, as a person, you can see your faults

20:52.291 --> 20:56.291
but also you see the faults of your society, where you live.

20:56.792 --> 21:00.667
I’ve seen immediately after people get their realization

21:00.667 --> 21:02.041
they start telling Me,

21:02.041 --> 21:06.166
“Mother, I was a Christian but see, this is Christianity”.

21:06.166 --> 21:09.333
Somebody will say, “Mother, I was very patriotic,

21:09.667 --> 21:12.208
but I see now what is patriotism is”.

21:12.208 --> 21:18.125
Like, everybody starts seeing its own background,

21:18.417 --> 21:26.083
its own styles in which he has lived and just gets out of it.

21:26.458 --> 21:30.917
And once you are out of it it’s no more identified with you.

21:30.917 --> 21:33.709
And it’s such a spontaneous happening.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.458
Only thing, you have to learn to be spontaneous.

21:36.709 --> 21:41.333
And that’s what I find that, in Sahaj, people still,

21:41.333 --> 21:48.250
though they are out of this illusion, this ocean of illusion,

21:48.542 --> 21:53.999
still sometimes their one leg is still there in the ocean

21:53.999 --> 21:57.542
and still they’re pulling it out and pushing it back.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.792
That should not be.

22:00.125 --> 22:04.208
That is only because people don’t meditate.

22:04.542 --> 22:08.250
Now to say you must meditate, people think it’s a kind of a ritual,

22:08.583 --> 22:14.208
or maybe a kind of a style of Sahaja Yoga, no.

22:14.208 --> 22:20.542
Meditation is for you, to go deep down into yourself,

22:20.834 --> 22:25.208
to achieve all that your Sahasrara wants to give you.

22:25.542 --> 22:30.458
To achieve that height of detachment,

22:30.834 --> 22:37.458
of understanding is only through meditation.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.999
So what happens in meditation is

22:39.999 --> 22:45.917
that your awareness crosses over Agnya, goes above,

22:46.250 --> 22:52.458
and is now stationed in the Sahasrara, in thoughtless awareness.

22:52.709 --> 22:58.125
Then the reality of Sahasrara, the beauty of Sahasrara,

22:58.667 --> 23:03.250
starts pouring in your own character, in your own temperament.

23:03.542 --> 23:07.583
Unless and until you meditate, not meditate just to get well

23:07.583 --> 23:10.792
or just to feel that “I must meditate“.

23:10.792 --> 23:14.458
But meditation is very important for all of you

23:14.709 --> 23:18.000
that you develop your Sahasrara in such a manner

23:18.375 --> 23:23.208
that you imbibe the beauty of your Sahasrara.

23:23.458 --> 23:27.542
If you don’t use your Sahasrara in this way,

23:27.834 --> 23:31.792
after some time you’ll find Sahasrara will close down,

23:31.792 --> 23:33.375
you’ll have no vibrations

23:33.625 --> 23:37.083
and you’ll have no understanding of yourself.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.417
So very, very important thing is to meditate.

23:40.417 --> 23:44.375
I can immediately make out a person who has been meditating

23:44.625 --> 23:49.125
and the one who has not been meditating.

23:49.125 --> 23:52.959
Because a person who does not meditate he still thinks that

23:52.959 --> 23:56.083
“Oh, it’s alright, I’m doing this, I’m doing that.”

23:56.083 --> 23:59.709
Meditation is the only way you can

23:59.709 --> 24:06.250
enrich yourself with the beauty of reality.

24:06.250 --> 24:07.999
There’s no other way.

24:07.999 --> 24:12.041
I cannot find any other way but meditation

24:12.041 --> 24:18.083
by which you rise into the realm of divinity.

24:18.375 --> 24:21.834
For example, I would say that Myself,

24:21.834 --> 24:24.625
whatever I have done is this,

24:24.625 --> 24:26.875
that I have been able to find out a method

24:26.875 --> 24:30.083
how to give Self-realization to masses.

24:30.083 --> 24:33.166
But that doesn’t mean that if I give to masses,

24:33.166 --> 24:35.959
they are all Sahaja Yogis, no.

24:36.166 --> 24:38.834
You must have seen whenever you have your programs,

24:39.166 --> 24:41.083
people get realization when I’m there

24:41.083 --> 24:50.500
and they come to programs for a while and then they drop out.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.500
The reason is, they have not meditated.

24:53.834 --> 24:57.041
If they had meditated they would have known

24:57.291 --> 25:03.041
what is their quality, what are they.

25:03.375 --> 25:11.500
Without meditation you don’t understand what is best for you.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.999
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

25:15.208 --> 25:18.208
that you’ll meditate every night,

25:18.208 --> 25:21.166
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

25:21.417 --> 25:25.500
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

25:25.500 --> 25:30.999
you are in contact with this Divine power.

25:31.291 --> 25:37.166
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

25:37.166 --> 25:42.166
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

25:42.417 --> 25:46.375
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

25:46.667 --> 25:49.417
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

25:49.750 --> 25:57.083
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

25:57.083 --> 26:02.083
which is another great blessing to us.

26:03.792 --> 26:07.417
Unless and until your Sahasrara is opened

26:07.750 --> 26:14.291
all the blessings of the Divine power cannot come to you, cannot.

26:14.291 --> 26:18.041
Maybe you might get some money, you might get some jobs,

26:18.041 --> 26:19.999
you might get this and that.

26:20.208 --> 26:24.291
But your own development is only possible when you meditate

26:24.291 --> 26:30.500
and your Sahasrara is completely open and open to truth.

26:30.792 --> 26:38.166
Now the truth is that this Divine power is compassion, is love.

26:38.542 --> 26:40.750
This is the truth.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.500
They say God is love and God is truth,

26:43.750 --> 26:49.041
so the equation has to be made that truth is love and love is truth.

26:49.291 --> 26:52.750
But it’s not a truth that, as you have for your own children,

26:52.750 --> 26:55.542
you have for your family, attached.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.875
Attached love is not truth.

26:59.083 --> 27:01.166
If you are attached to somebody

27:01.166 --> 27:05.083
then you never see the bad points of that person.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.208
If you are angry with somebody,

27:07.208 --> 27:10.542
then you can never see the good points of that person.

27:10.542 --> 27:14.792
But it’s a complete detached love

27:14.792 --> 27:18.083
and that love is extremely powerful

27:18.458 --> 27:22.999
because whenever you project that love to anyone,

27:22.999 --> 27:26.542
you’ll be surprised, the problems of that person will be solved,

27:26.542 --> 27:28.291
his personality will improve,

27:28.625 --> 27:33.667
everything will work out in a very big way and his life will be changed.

27:33.999 --> 27:37.667
But if you’re attached to anything whatsoever,

27:38.041 --> 27:50.291
that attachment itself causes problems and doesn’t allow Sahaj to grow.

27:50.625 --> 27:55.208
This attachment could be any kind, for example,

27:55.208 --> 27:59.208
you can be attached to your country, attached to your society,

27:59.208 --> 28:02.166
attached to your family, it can be of any kind.

28:02.542 --> 28:07.667
But when Sahasrara is open, you’ll learn one thing, is detachment.

28:07.917 --> 28:09.792
It just happens that you get detached.

28:10.083 --> 28:13.208
Though, I mean, you are not running away.

28:13.542 --> 28:17.542
As it is in Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in people who run away

28:17.875 --> 28:23.083
from society and go to Himalayas, all that I call escapism,

28:23.333 --> 28:24.542
that is not the point.

28:24.542 --> 28:29.000
What happens is that you are there, you see everyone,

28:29.000 --> 28:33.166
you watch everyone, you know everyone,

28:33.417 --> 28:38.458
you are close to everyone, but you are a detached person.

28:38.750 --> 28:43.542
It’s a state of mind that you achieve when Sahasrara is open.

28:43.875 --> 28:47.750
In that state you are dealing with people,

28:48.750 --> 28:53.583
you are dealing with problems, you are dealing with situations,

28:53.583 --> 28:59.000
but you are not involved in it, there’s no involvement;

28:59.417 --> 29:02.000
and that involvement which you had before

29:02.417 --> 29:07.542
can never give a complete insight, what is happening,

29:07.792 --> 29:10.208
what the truth is, about any situation.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.583
So this detachment helps.

29:13.875 --> 29:18.792
The greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not affected.

29:19.583 --> 29:23.959
No use saying that, “oh you are not affected,

29:23.959 --> 29:29.583
Mother, so how can you feel for another person?

29:29.959 --> 29:34.041
How can you have compassion for another person?

29:34.375 --> 29:38.333
Because if you feel for another person

29:38.709 --> 29:41.834
then only you can solve the problem”.

29:42.041 --> 29:47.125
But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment.

29:47.375 --> 29:52.917
It is not a real feeling, because it doesn’t help.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.375
The person is crying, you are also crying,

29:56.792 --> 29:59.250
the person is trouble, you are also in trouble.

29:59.250 --> 30:04.458
And this does not help that person, nor will it help you.

30:04.792 --> 30:08.458
So to have detached in no way means

30:08.792 --> 30:13.500
you do not feel for another person.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.625
You do feel.

30:14.625 --> 30:19.834
You feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that person,

30:20.041 --> 30:25.041
of the whole society sometimes and of the whole country.

30:25.375 --> 30:27.834
But that your feeling is so detached

30:28.834 --> 30:33.917
that the All-pervading Power takes over.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.000
First we must have full faith

30:36.250 --> 30:40.375
in the capability of this All-pervading Power.

30:40.709 --> 30:42.709
As soon as you are detached.

30:43.125 --> 30:47.166
You say, “You do it” - finished.

30:47.166 --> 30:49.125
Once you say that, “You are going to do it,

30:49.375 --> 30:51.500
it’s You who is going to do it,”

30:51.792 --> 30:53.834
whole thing changes completely.

30:53.834 --> 30:58.709
Because you transfer all your responsibilities, all your problems,

30:58.709 --> 31:02.125
to this Divine power, which is so powerful,

31:02.125 --> 31:06.834
which is so capable, which can work out anything.

31:07.041 --> 31:12.458
So whenever you think that this problem you are going to solve,

31:12.709 --> 31:15.333
you are the one who’s going to do it,

31:15.333 --> 31:20.500
then, alright, the Divine power says: “Alright, try your luck.”

31:21.000 --> 31:25.166
But if you can really put this problem to the Divine power,

31:25.166 --> 31:26.583
it will work out.

31:26.583 --> 31:29.709
We have all kinds of problems in Sahaja Yoga,

31:30.041 --> 31:33.000
especially when we find that people

31:33.000 --> 31:35.917
are not so much attracted to Sahaja Yoga,

31:36.208 --> 31:39.625
they are few in number then you feel very bad about it.

31:39.917 --> 31:43.041
But have you tried to meditate on this point,

31:43.041 --> 31:48.125
and have you tried to put this problem to the Divine power?

31:48.375 --> 31:49.834
Why should we worry?

31:49.834 --> 31:52.834
When we have Divine power available through our Sahasrara,

31:53.041 --> 31:54.125
why should we worry?

31:54.125 --> 31:56.375
Why should we think about it?

31:56.375 --> 31:59.500
Just leave it to the Divine power.

31:59.834 --> 32:04.000
If that is possible, if that you can achieve,

32:04.375 --> 32:06.917
which is very difficult for human beings,

32:07.250 --> 32:09.166
because they live with their ego,

32:09.583 --> 32:11.375
they live with their conditionings;

32:11.709 --> 32:16.375
but if that attachment to all these things goes away,

32:16.625 --> 32:21.959
then what you do is just leave things to this power.

32:22.834 --> 32:24.583
Krishna has said in His Gita:

32:24.917 --> 32:28.625
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”

32:28.917 --> 32:30.709
“Forget about all your dharmas”.

32:30.709 --> 32:35.333
Dharmas means, He means, meaning that we have a dharma of a wife,

32:35.709 --> 32:39.625
of a husband, of a member of the society,

32:39.959 --> 32:41.917
all of them have their own dharma.

32:42.250 --> 32:47.500
But He says “Leave them. And leave it, them to Me and I’ll manage.”

32:47.834 --> 32:51.041
This is it what we have to learn, is to say that

32:51.333 --> 32:55.625
“It’s this Divine power which will solve our problems.”

32:55.959 --> 32:59.250
As human beings it’s a very difficult state

32:59.583 --> 33:03.500
and this state only can be achieved through meditation.

33:03.750 --> 33:07.625
But I’m not saying that you go on meditating for hours together.

33:07.625 --> 33:08.709
That’s not necessary.

33:08.959 --> 33:14.709
But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine power.

33:14.709 --> 33:18.041
If you work it out, I’m sure it’s not difficult

33:18.041 --> 33:22.250
to rise to that state of consciousness.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.500
That is what we have to achieve.

33:24.834 --> 33:28.709
It’s possible for men as well as for women.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.625
They don’t have to think: “How can we, Mother, do it after all?”

33:33.000 --> 33:36.250
You see, all such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

33:36.583 --> 33:42.375
Those who have diffidence about themselves cannot do anything.

33:42.625 --> 33:46.625
But those who are surrendered and those who think they can do it,

33:47.125 --> 33:56.375
can manage all this transfer of their power to the Divine power.

33:56.959 --> 33:58.834
Just put it on the Divine power.

33:58.834 --> 34:03.458
Now supposing I have a car which can drive Me down.

34:03.792 --> 34:08.000
So, if I have a car then I don’t put bullocks on it,

34:08.375 --> 34:14.333
that I don’t push My car, I just sit inside and use it.

34:14.333 --> 34:18.000
In the same way, if you have this great power around you,

34:18.834 --> 34:23.792
if your Sahasrara is absolutely, completely submerged in it,

34:24.166 --> 34:29.875
then you’ll be amazed how things work out for yourself.

34:31.583 --> 34:35.291
I will give you an example of a Sahaja Yogi, he’s no more now,

34:35.834 --> 34:40.250
he was a fisherman, ordinary fisherman, but also he was educated,

34:40.583 --> 34:44.000
so he was working in a bank.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.583
This one was going one day to do some Sahaja Yoga work

34:47.834 --> 34:50.041
and he had to go by boat.

34:50.458 --> 34:53.875
So when he came out he saw that the whole place was clouded

34:53.875 --> 34:57.583
and it was about to burst out into a big havoc.

34:57.583 --> 35:04.166
So he got very much perturbed about it that – “what is this?”

35:04.709 --> 35:08.750
Immediately, his Sahasrara was so open and good, immediately he said,

35:09.000 --> 35:12.625
“Now I leave it to this Divine power

35:12.625 --> 35:15.625
to stop all these things happening.

35:15.959 --> 35:19.125
I don’t want it to rain and to have any problem

35:19.417 --> 35:22.750
till I come back home and go off to sleep”.

35:23.041 --> 35:26.625
And it was surprising, people told Me that

35:26.625 --> 35:29.875
“Mother, the clouds and everything were there

35:30.250 --> 35:35.959
all throughout but it did not rain, did not do anything,

35:36.250 --> 35:39.166
and there was no chaos of any kind”.

35:39.583 --> 35:42.417
He went to another island where he had to go,

35:42.709 --> 35:44.625
he did Sahaja Yoga and came back.

35:44.875 --> 35:47.750
And then when he went to sleep, then only,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.166
everything started pouring down.

35:50.417 --> 35:54.875
So, nature, everything, every leaf, every flower, everything,

35:55.250 --> 35:58.166
is worked out through the Divine power.

35:58.709 --> 36:02.750
So we should not have our ego that we can do something ourselves,

36:03.000 --> 36:04.375
we can manage ourselves.

36:04.625 --> 36:06.999
Once you have that kind of a thing,

36:06.999 --> 36:08.709
you are not yet that much developed,

36:08.709 --> 36:12.625
you are not that much grown up in Sahaja Yoga.

36:12.625 --> 36:16.500
But to grow up in Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult for you,

36:16.500 --> 36:18.542
because you have guidelines.

36:18.959 --> 36:23.709
Those people who got their realization, very few of them,

36:23.999 --> 36:28.166
like Sufis and we had some saints in India, all of them;

36:28.500 --> 36:30.166
how much they must have struggled.

36:30.417 --> 36:32.542
Nobody to guide them, nobody to help them,

36:32.959 --> 36:36.250
nobody to tell them about what they can achieve.

36:36.500 --> 36:41.083
And despite that they were very satisfied people,

36:41.709 --> 36:44.999
very happy people, and they worked it out so well.

36:45.291 --> 36:50.625
They saw the whole world with another angle, as you can also see,

36:50.959 --> 36:54.417
but they were not upset and they had such self-confidence,

36:54.709 --> 36:59.999
they had such knowledge of their own

37:00.250 --> 37:04.625
that they achieved through their meditative process.

37:04.959 --> 37:06.709
And the way they have written books,

37:06.709 --> 37:09.750
some of them are so great, it’s very surprisingly,

37:09.999 --> 37:17.999
how they have achieved these great verses, such full of knowledge.

37:18.417 --> 37:22.834
One cannot understand that they had no guidance,

37:23.083 --> 37:25.750
nobody was to tell them.

37:25.999 --> 37:28.083
But one thing with them was

37:28.625 --> 37:33.667
that they always tried to look after their Sahasrara.

37:34.500 --> 37:38.041
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

37:38.291 --> 37:44.083
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

37:44.083 --> 37:48.083
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

37:48.083 --> 37:51.667
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

37:51.959 --> 37:55.291
Thoughts are coming all the time,

37:55.625 --> 37:59.959
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

38:00.250 --> 38:01.750
react to this and react to that

38:01.750 --> 38:05.083
and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

38:05.083 --> 38:07.083
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

38:07.083 --> 38:10.875
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

38:11.166 --> 38:15.291
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

38:15.667 --> 38:20.834
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

38:21.041 --> 38:23.041
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

38:23.500 --> 38:27.041
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

38:27.041 --> 38:30.375
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

38:30.667 --> 38:35.542
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

38:35.959 --> 38:38.417
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

38:38.417 --> 38:41.875
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

38:42.083 --> 38:45.959
And these are so much built up within you,

38:45.959 --> 38:50.166
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

38:51.041 --> 38:54.999
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.750
First one is, when it is conditioning,

38:57.750 --> 39:00.417
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

39:00.667 --> 39:03.166
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

39:03.417 --> 39:06.625
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

39:06.959 --> 39:08.667
That’s the conditioning part of it.

39:08.959 --> 39:10.625
Conditioning can be of many types.

39:10.959 --> 39:12.500
But the ego part of it is that,

39:12.500 --> 39:14.999
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

39:15.208 --> 39:19.083
I must be able to rule everyone.”

39:20.000 --> 39:23.333
These two things are there in the mind

39:23.750 --> 39:26.917
which are all the time crossing over.

39:27.542 --> 39:32.750
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

39:33.083 --> 39:37.667
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

39:37.917 --> 39:43.208
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

39:43.458 --> 39:48.208
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

39:48.542 --> 39:52.291
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

39:52.542 --> 39:54.583
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

39:54.917 --> 39:57.583
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

39:57.875 --> 40:01.000
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

40:01.291 --> 40:04.417
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,

40:04.417 --> 40:05.875
“I’m an extrovert”.

40:05.875 --> 40:07.667
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

40:07.917 --> 40:13.667
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

40:13.917 --> 40:17.542
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

40:17.542 --> 40:23.542
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

40:23.542 --> 40:29.583
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

40:29.875 --> 40:34.208
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

40:34.542 --> 40:36.999
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

40:37.208 --> 40:40.917
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

40:41.208 --> 40:45.125
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

40:45.417 --> 40:48.000
this Agnya can be opened out.

40:48.333 --> 40:51.000
With surrendering to the Divine,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.208
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

40:53.542 --> 40:57.208
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

40:57.458 --> 41:02.125
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

41:02.125 --> 41:08.999
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

41:09.208 --> 41:13.583
Your connection of Sahasrara with

41:13.583 --> 41:15.875
the All-pervading Power is established.

41:15.875 --> 41:22.667
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

41:22.667 --> 41:27.834
how they help you, how they try to give you whatever

41:27.834 --> 41:31.542
is the real knowledge about everything.

41:31.542 --> 41:35.667
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.333
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

41:39.333 --> 41:43.125
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

41:43.125 --> 41:48.458
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

41:48.709 --> 41:56.000
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

41:56.333 --> 42:04.333
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

42:04.667 --> 42:07.583
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

42:09.709 --> 42:13.083
Kabira has said something great about this,

42:13.083 --> 42:20.709
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

42:21.000 --> 42:25.458
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

42:25.709 --> 42:33.458
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

42:33.792 --> 42:37.458
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

42:37.709 --> 42:40.834
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

42:41.083 --> 42:44.375
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

42:44.667 --> 42:52.667
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

42:53.125 --> 42:56.083
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

42:56.333 --> 43:00.458
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

43:00.959 --> 43:06.458
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

43:06.917 --> 43:11.917
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

43:12.458 --> 43:17.333
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

43:17.709 --> 43:21.834
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

43:22.250 --> 43:26.959
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

43:27.250 --> 43:31.000
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

43:31.667 --> 43:33.458
But the greatest thing happend to you

43:33.709 --> 43:35.667
that you become a global personality.

43:36.041 --> 43:39.083
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

43:39.834 --> 43:43.709
of every other nation where they have problems.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.333
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.959
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

43:51.250 --> 43:53.959
maybe for media, maybe for something.

43:53.959 --> 43:58.125
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

43:58.500 --> 44:04.000
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

44:04.375 --> 44:09.000
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

44:09.250 --> 44:14.500
that it, whatever disturbs you,

44:14.792 --> 44:19.125
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

44:19.500 --> 44:23.333
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

44:23.709 --> 44:27.834
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

44:28.125 --> 44:31.041
if you are a global person.

44:31.041 --> 44:32.792
If you are a global person then

44:32.792 --> 44:38.125
what happens is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

44:38.500 --> 44:42.917
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

44:42.917 --> 44:47.166
to act because you are purely a global personality.

44:47.625 --> 44:49.500
Not attached to this, attached to that,

44:49.792 --> 44:53.959
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

44:53.959 --> 44:56.959
by this Divine power very easily.

44:57.333 --> 45:00.000
For that, as I told in the afternoon also,

45:00.458 --> 45:04.375
that we have to be careful about few things that we have.

45:04.709 --> 45:09.125
Firstly anger, anger is the worst thing that we have.

45:09.125 --> 45:10.834
Angry for what?

45:10.834 --> 45:12.792
There are people who talk like this - “I was very angry” -

45:13.041 --> 45:14.625
as if they’re proud of their anger.

45:14.625 --> 45:18.959
Anger is a sign of complete stupidity, absolute stupidity.

45:19.375 --> 45:22.917
And there’s no need to get angry with anyone because,

45:23.166 --> 45:26.000
by anger, you don’t solve the problem.

45:26.375 --> 45:28.709
With anger you spoil yourself.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.250
With anger you ruin your own, own nature.

45:33.583 --> 45:37.333
With anger you really spoil the whole situation.

45:37.625 --> 45:44.250
So no use, no use having any anger about anything.

45:44.583 --> 45:47.458
But if anything happens that angers you,

45:47.458 --> 45:49.834
you should settle down and see for yourself

45:50.041 --> 45:54.375
why is it wrong, why is it disturbing you?

45:54.709 --> 46:00.750
Your seeing itself will help this problem to be solved.

46:01.375 --> 46:03.709
You must first of all realize that you are

46:03.709 --> 46:06.500
a special personality that your Sahasrara

46:06.834 --> 46:09.917
has been opened out to this all Divine power,

46:10.458 --> 46:14.375
as if you have entered into the realm of divinity.

46:15.625 --> 46:29.500
You are great guests in that great court of Divine domain.

46:29.917 --> 46:32.166
You are not an ordinary person.

46:32.166 --> 46:37.375
And so once you understand why you have Sahaja Yoga

46:37.750 --> 46:43.125
and why you have got realization, is that there’s something special.

46:43.458 --> 46:46.125
But that should not give you any ego.

46:47.709 --> 46:50.458
It’s not for ego that you have to have this,

46:50.709 --> 46:52.500
but it’s for understanding that

46:52.917 --> 46:56.458
you have to play into the hands of the Divine.

46:56.709 --> 47:00.959
It is this play is something I could explain like this,

47:01.166 --> 47:03.625
that: if you are, supposing, an artist,

47:03.959 --> 47:06.583
then in the hand of the artist is the brush

47:06.875 --> 47:10.875
and the brush never thinks that it is doing anything.

47:11.250 --> 47:13.875
It’s the artist who is doing everything.

47:14.250 --> 47:18.125
In the same way, when you are one with the Divine power,

47:18.709 --> 47:23.041
you just feel “I’m not doing anything.

47:23.041 --> 47:25.750
It’s the Artist who’s doing it.

47:26.375 --> 47:28.250
It’s the Artist who is managing”.

47:28.250 --> 47:29.291
And who is the Artist?

47:29.291 --> 47:33.750
It’s this Divine power, which loves you, which cares for you,

47:34.000 --> 47:38.417
which looks after you, which absolutely is identified with you.

47:38.792 --> 47:39.709
You’ll be surprised,

47:39.709 --> 47:44.709
I have got so many letters from people how Sahaj has helped them.

47:44.959 --> 47:47.333
How at the right moment they got the help.

47:47.667 --> 47:54.208
At the point of complete destruction, how they were saved.

47:54.542 --> 47:56.375
So many people have written to Me.

47:56.375 --> 47:58.000
But I’m not surprised.

47:58.333 --> 48:02.375
Because if you are one with the Divine, it looks after you.

48:02.375 --> 48:06.041
It has all the powers, all the powers.

48:06.041 --> 48:12.959
Only one power it doesn’t have, to control you.

48:13.166 --> 48:19.291
If you want to ruin yourself, it gives you freedom, complete freedom.

48:19.291 --> 48:21.375
If you want to ruin yourself, ruin.

48:21.375 --> 48:25.875
If you don’t want to accept Divine power, alright, don’t accept.

48:25.875 --> 48:30.500
It’s a complete freedom to do what you like with yourself.

48:30.750 --> 48:33.375
That is one thing it has given and that’s why

48:33.625 --> 48:39.417
you must curb down that freedom and respect the Divine power.

48:39.417 --> 48:47.417
Today is, I like the day when it is a Mother’s, I should say,

48:47.417 --> 48:48.959
Mother's day also,

48:48.959 --> 48:52.959
because I think only a mother can work it out that way.

48:53.250 --> 48:55.875
One has to have lots of patience with people.

48:56.125 --> 48:59.291
What I’ve seen about all these great incarnations who came,

48:59.875 --> 49:08.166
they just disappeared; in a very short time they lived, very short time.

49:08.417 --> 49:13.500
Somebody was crucified about 33 years of age.

49:13.792 --> 49:17.291
Somebody took a samadhi at 23 years of age.

49:17.625 --> 49:21.083
Because I think they couldn’t bear the way people were stupid.

49:21.417 --> 49:22.875
They couldn’t see the point

49:23.083 --> 49:25.792
that they could do something for human beings.

49:25.792 --> 49:29.291
They lost their confidence I think, or maybe that they thought

49:29.625 --> 49:31.500
it’s useless to work for these people.

49:31.875 --> 49:36.291
Like that they took a position that, it’s better to disappear.

49:36.750 --> 49:39.083
But Mother’s position is different,

49:39.333 --> 49:44.500
She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child.

49:44.500 --> 49:47.542
She’ll fight it out to the last to see

49:47.542 --> 49:50.500
that the child gets all the benefits.

49:50.750 --> 49:55.333
And this patience and this love and this forgiveness

49:55.792 --> 49:58.542
is innately built in a mother,

49:58.999 --> 50:01.667
see, because her attitude is very different.

50:01.792 --> 50:11.583
Not any achievement, not any big name

50:11.792 --> 50:15.875
or a, what you call a sort of an award or anything.

50:15.875 --> 50:19.166
It is just she does it because she is a mother.

50:19.667 --> 50:23.291
And that is what is the sign of any mother,

50:23.625 --> 50:26.333
if she’s a real mother, at least for her own children,

50:26.667 --> 50:30.458
she will go all out, she will work out everything

50:30.875 --> 50:35.875
for day in and day out and try to save the child from disaster.

50:36.208 --> 50:38.667
But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family

50:38.917 --> 50:43.333
and for that you really had to be worked out

50:43.333 --> 50:45.458
through the mother’s principle.

50:45.792 --> 50:48.041
You cannot take any other principle.

50:48.041 --> 50:51.291
Like there were very great warriors we had

50:51.917 --> 50:54.417
and they have done a great job also

50:54.750 --> 50:57.417
and they have worked out as warriors.

50:57.750 --> 51:00.083
Then we had some who were very sacrificing.

51:00.083 --> 51:03.083
All kinds of people there were.

51:03.083 --> 51:07.417
They worked very hard to establish dharma in people

51:07.750 --> 51:08.999
but they could not.

51:09.291 --> 51:13.458
I thought of one thing that, no use establishing dharma.

51:13.792 --> 51:15.667
First of all give them realization.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.458
When in the light of the Spirit they see what’s wrong,

51:21.792 --> 51:24.166
they become dharmic automatically.

51:24.166 --> 51:28.000
The best way is to do that, not to force dharma on them.

51:28.291 --> 51:29.999
Because if you put dharma on them,

51:30.208 --> 51:34.166
they don’t know how to bear it, they can’t digest.

51:35.458 --> 51:36.875
So this will be the best way,

51:37.083 --> 51:42.667
is to just make them aware of their Spirit.

51:43.208 --> 51:45.333
Once the light of the Spirit comes,

51:45.583 --> 51:47.875
in the light they see everything clearly,

51:48.166 --> 51:50.208
then no problem is there.

51:50.458 --> 51:53.999
And that’s why this Mother’s quality is very helpful.

51:53.999 --> 51:56.750
I mean in every country there has been

51:57.000 --> 52:01.583
a manifestation of the Mother Principle, in every country,

52:01.875 --> 52:04.999
and it has been depicted and said.

52:05.291 --> 52:08.917
But later on, it was taken over by people

52:09.166 --> 52:11.875
who didn’t want to talk about Mother.

52:12.125 --> 52:14.583
Because they could not justify themselves

52:14.875 --> 52:15.667
the way they were behaving.

52:15.667 --> 52:18.333
So they said, best is not to talk of the Mother.

52:18.667 --> 52:21.792
Also those who were very much advanced people,

52:22.208 --> 52:25.291
very matured, who were really incarnations

52:25.542 --> 52:27.667
did talk about the mother all the time.

52:27.917 --> 52:29.875
But still talk was talk.

52:30.125 --> 52:34.792
Now this has to be worked out as a Mother has to work it out.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.333
So in your own way,

52:36.667 --> 52:42.999
when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother.

52:43.333 --> 52:46.417
More mother’s quality than the father’s quality,

52:46.875 --> 52:51.208
that: there’s no ambition, there’s no competition,

52:51.709 --> 52:54.875
there’s no jealousies, nothing.

52:55.125 --> 52:59.083
Just you want your children to come up

52:59.333 --> 53:02.792
and to grow in their spirituality.

53:03.125 --> 53:06.417
If that is the only attitude we have,

53:06.792 --> 53:10.792
then you’ll be amazed how satisfied you’ll feel.

53:11.125 --> 53:18.000
Because this is a very, very joy-giving thing

53:18.000 --> 53:21.792
to see people growing in spirituality.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.208
Not only talking about it, not only reading about it,

53:25.542 --> 53:29.208
but actually happening, actualizing within us.

53:30.125 --> 53:32.792
So this quality is very helpful

53:33.083 --> 53:36.999
and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi;

53:37.208 --> 53:41.000
to be patient, to be kind, to be humble.

53:41.709 --> 53:44.250
But you have to correct also.

53:44.917 --> 53:48.125
But there’s a way of correction of another person,

53:48.667 --> 53:53.417
of people who are coming, not from the Divine world

53:53.417 --> 53:55.125
but from the normal world.

53:55.458 --> 53:59.917
So it’s a difficult task to correct them.

54:00.208 --> 54:02.834
Some people are so hot tempered they can’t bear it.

54:03.208 --> 54:05.917
Doesn’t matter, you have to forgive them.

54:06.250 --> 54:11.375
But best is to concentrate on people who are simple,

54:11.709 --> 54:14.583
who are loving, who are affectionate

54:14.875 --> 54:19.083
and then gradually all these complicated people, also, will join.

54:19.333 --> 54:26.333
Your way of dealing with others has to be motherly.

54:26.667 --> 54:30.083
The motherly relationship has to be there.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.417
Now I was surprised that in the western literature,

54:34.417 --> 54:39.709
I don’t find any description of a child and a mother’s relationship,

54:39.999 --> 54:41.000
very surprising.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.208
There’s no description at all.

54:43.458 --> 54:47.250
How the mother sees the child, how he walks, how he falls down,

54:47.709 --> 54:51.000
then how he gets up and how he talks.

54:51.792 --> 54:54.458
All kinds of beautiful things has described,

54:54.834 --> 54:57.583
but not in the Western countries.

54:57.583 --> 54:59.375
I don’t know, they never saw this point,

54:59.667 --> 55:03.000
I think, that it is very important that to describe

55:03.333 --> 55:05.667
the attention of the mother.

55:05.667 --> 55:07.458
How she’s loving, how she’s kind,

55:07.709 --> 55:14.208
how she tolerates so much nonsense and how she keeps it as a,

55:14.208 --> 55:19.000
sort of a, forgiving thing.

55:19.250 --> 55:22.667
Not just to use it against the child or to trouble.

55:22.959 --> 55:25.542
Sometimes you have to correct, you have to tell.

55:25.834 --> 55:28.667
But at the right time, at the right place,

55:28.917 --> 55:35.333
if they are told, the child also sees the point, whatever is there.

55:35.333 --> 55:39.083
The first, most convincing thing is the affection

55:39.083 --> 55:41.125
and the love of the Mother.

55:41.375 --> 55:47.667
She goes on forgiving and giving that assurance that

55:47.667 --> 55:51.458
“I have a mother, nothing can happen to me.”

55:51.834 --> 55:55.083
And this assurance works very well.

55:55.333 --> 55:59.000
But the same assurance you have to give to other Sahaja Yogis

55:59.333 --> 56:01.834
who are getting realization from you.

56:02.083 --> 56:04.583
Let them feel that you are not angry with them.

56:04.917 --> 56:07.000
They are stupid, I know.

56:07.333 --> 56:09.792
They are sometimes violent.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.834
I have gone through all kinds of people.

56:14.125 --> 56:20.125
But the only thing that has worked is pure love.

56:20.709 --> 56:28.208
Pure love has no attributes of expecting something.

56:29.041 --> 56:36.959
You just give love and try to improve that person, with full attention.

56:37.208 --> 56:42.458
But in Divine work, you don’t have to get attached to that person.

56:42.709 --> 56:46.917
Supposing, there’s somebody who is not up to the point,

56:47.250 --> 56:50.041
is also troublesome, gets angry with you, annoyed,

56:50.041 --> 56:52.375
insults you and everything, so forget it!

56:53.000 --> 56:54.333
There are many others.

56:54.625 --> 56:56.583
There’s no need to run after one person,

56:56.959 --> 57:01.125
to get attached to that person or to make them fear.

57:01.125 --> 57:02.917
Now main thing is that,

57:03.125 --> 57:07.917
I feel all the Sahaja Yogis always feel that I’m their own,

57:07.917 --> 57:08.959
which is a fact.

57:08.959 --> 57:13.000
Whether I talk to you, whether I meet you or whatever it is,

57:13.333 --> 57:16.333
you have to know that I’m your Mother

57:16.333 --> 57:20.458
and any problem you have you can always tell Me.

57:20.834 --> 57:23.458
But sometimes the way people tell Me problems also,

57:23.834 --> 57:26.500
I feel, how low they are.

57:26.792 --> 57:28.834
Their mentality is so low.

57:29.125 --> 57:30.458
What are they asking Me?

57:30.792 --> 57:35.625
Supposing you go to some king and ask him for, say,

57:35.917 --> 57:38.417
half a dollar, then what will the king say?

57:38.417 --> 57:40.166
“What is the matter with this person?

57:40.458 --> 57:43.000
He doesn’t know what he should ask for.”

57:43.333 --> 57:45.667
In the same way, one feels that way that

57:46.166 --> 57:49.542
when you are asking anything to your Mother,

57:49.875 --> 57:52.583
it should be of some value.

57:52.583 --> 58:01.417
Some great value, it should have the value of complete satisfaction.

58:01.750 --> 58:05.542
When you ask for something it should give you complete satisfaction.

58:05.542 --> 58:09.166
But I’ve seen people asking for this thing, for that thing.

58:09.166 --> 58:12.458
I mean it’s to such an extent that I sometimes feel,

58:12.458 --> 58:15.542
“Oh God, how am I getting all these people around Me

58:15.917 --> 58:21.875
who are desiring something very low, very mean, very insipid?”

58:23.083 --> 58:29.542
But if you are one with the Sahasrara, then Sahasrara itself works.

58:30.125 --> 58:32.750
It will bring you contact with people,

58:33.917 --> 58:39.875
in contact with such people that you are amazed how it works.

58:40.583 --> 58:42.875
I went to Turkey and My experience of Turkey

58:43.458 --> 58:45.750
has proved that beyond doubt.

58:45.999 --> 58:49.083
I never expected, but the Turkish people,

58:49.083 --> 58:53.041
of all the people of the world,

58:53.834 --> 58:57.625
have taken to Sahaja Yoga just like a windfall.

58:57.875 --> 59:01.125
I can’t understand how they have accepted it.

59:01.375 --> 59:03.834
And they were at least two thousand people

59:04.041 --> 59:07.750
in the follow-up and people were finding it impossible

59:08.500 --> 59:11.041
to get them round and tell them.

59:11.417 --> 59:13.999
And when they had very close meetings also

59:14.291 --> 59:17.959
they had so many people and they continued to be there.

59:18.250 --> 59:21.417
Now maybe that it’s a very disturbed country

59:21.750 --> 59:24.834
with fundamentalism very much working out.

59:25.041 --> 59:32.250
But everywhere, every country has problems and has, we should say,

59:32.542 --> 59:39.875
a kind of a very destructive image, every country has.

59:40.166 --> 59:43.250
But in some countries, I don’t know how,

59:43.250 --> 59:47.291
it sparks and once they become Sahaja Yogis, no problem.

59:47.750 --> 59:50.166
There’s no problem about anything,

59:50.166 --> 59:53.041
means they are Sahaja Yogis you see, you don’t have to tell them.

59:53.417 --> 59:56.999
They themselves work it out, they understand it, what is it.

59:57.250 --> 01:00:01.417
Like we have every country which has problems,

01:00:01.709 --> 01:00:05.291
which has people who are not of a very great level,

01:00:05.542 --> 01:00:06.999
who are not great seekers.

01:00:07.291 --> 01:00:11.250
Maybe in some countries, I feel, those who were great seekers are lost.

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:15.999
Like England, I feel that all the seekers are lost by drugs,

01:00:16.417 --> 01:00:18.375
hippyism, all nonsense.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:24.291
America is the worst of all, which is so much lost into wrong seeking;

01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:29.625
and it’s difficult to find people there who have right seeking.

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:35.625
Gradually it is working out, but still, I must say,

01:00:35.959 --> 01:00:39.999
we should not think of any one particular country where Sahaja Yoga

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:44.375
is not working out so much or in some places working out so much.

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:49.875
It is, what we have to think, globally that Sahaja Yoga is growing.

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:54.417
And you are part and parcel of that society which is Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:58.208
It’s a very rare society which they never had.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.959
They had one or two sufis here and there,

01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:04.875
one or two realized souls here and there, who only suffered.

01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:09.291
All their lives they were tortured, nobody looked at them.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:13.417
I had great hopes about Maharashtra, but I’m so disappointed,

01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:18.917
because they tortured all these great saints all throughout,

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:22.417
so badly, in such a mean manner,

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:25.166
that I think they are still paying for it.

01:01:25.458 --> 01:01:28.999
And despite the fact that I’ve done so much work there,

01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:34.458
what I feel is that, their karmas are not good because they still,

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:38.792
I would say, it’s a rotten country, become so rotten.

01:01:41.041 --> 01:01:47.834
You can see that, the way people are behaving, whole thing is so bad.

01:01:47.834 --> 01:01:50.500
Though Sahaja Yoga is there, no doubt,

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.041
but I wouldn’t say it is of that level

01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:55.834
as it is in the north, north of India.

01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:57.041
It’s very surprising.

01:01:57.333 --> 01:02:00.041
North Indians never knew anything about Sahaja Yoga,

01:02:00.458 --> 01:02:03.000
they were not such religious people either.

01:02:03.333 --> 01:02:07.834
But how the north people have taken to Sahaja Yoga it`s very surprising.

01:02:08.041 --> 01:02:11.917
So you can’t say where the light will show, just can’t say.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:14.250
And wherever it shows we should accept.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.917
Wherever it doesn’t show, we should not feel bad about it.

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.333
What can you do?

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:22.250
You cannot sort of break their heads for Sahasrara,

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:25.000
their Sahasrara has to be opened out.

01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:27.375
And with your motherly love,

01:02:27.709 --> 01:02:31.041
with your motherly understanding I’m sure you can do it.

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:37.500
Not, may not be, to the same extent in every country,

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:41.375
but I’m sure, as I feel that,

01:02:41.625 --> 01:02:48.709
maybe the punyas of these great saints will work and maybe,

01:02:48.959 --> 01:02:53.000
wherever I felt a little bit disappointed,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.583
I feel that all these places will work out and Sahaja Yoga will grow.

01:02:59.834 --> 01:03:03.125
But first and foremost is your Sahasrara.

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:07.166
Only your Sahasrara can reflect the light of the Divine.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.041
So, your Sahasrara is extremely important.

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:14.834
You must meditate to enrich your Sahasrara,

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:19.583
to cure it, to make it completely nourished by the Kundalini.

01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:22.583
There`s no need to do many rituals but meditation

01:03:22.875 --> 01:03:28.250
and also little bit of taking Bandhan, even now today,

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:33.291
is necessary I think, when you go out.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:40.500
Because still Kali Yuga is working it’s own pangs and the Satya Yuga

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.625
is trying to come out.

01:03:42.959 --> 01:03:48.834
We are the ones who are going to support, look after the Satya Yuga.

01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:52.959
And that’s why the Sahasrara opening is very,

01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:55.625
very important, it’s very important.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.375
And those who want to grow should meditate every day,

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:07.125
whatever time you may come home, maybe in the morning,

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:09.500
maybe in the evening, anytime.

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:12.625
But you will know that you are meditating when

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:16.709
you can get into thoughtless awareness, then you will know.

01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:18.625
Your reaction will be zero.

01:04:18.999 --> 01:04:20.875
Look at something you will just look at it,

01:04:21.125 --> 01:04:23.750
you won`t react, because you are thoughtless.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.125
You won`t react.

01:04:26.417 --> 01:04:29.875
When that reaction is not there then everything,

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.959
you’ll be surprised, is Divine.

01:04:33.291 --> 01:04:38.041
Because reaction is your Agnyas problem.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.750
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware,

01:04:41.999 --> 01:04:43.625
you are one with the Divine.

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:48.166
So much so that the Divine takes over, every activity,

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.875
every moment of your life and looks after you.

01:04:53.875 --> 01:04:58.125
And you feel completely secured, one with the Divine.

01:04:58.375 --> 01:05:01.125
And enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:05.041
May God bless you!

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.999
Now we have so many children.

01:05:36.625 --> 01:05:40.417
I don't know what to do with all these children here.

01:05:40.709 --> 01:05:43.166
They can just come up on the stage

01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:47.999
and they can sing the song of Shri Ganesha.
