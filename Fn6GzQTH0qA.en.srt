00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:17,825
Yogini: Mother, in the spiritual seeking, can you get too right sided,

3
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:25,544
wanting to go faster and faster?

4
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:31,672
Shri Mataji: In the spiritual seeking? In the spiritual seeking there is,

5
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:35,102
a speed is not felt at all you see.

6
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:40,766
In that you just feel the state. Your state you feel.

7
00:00:40,966 --> 00:00:47,141
You don’t feel the speed. You don’t feel that you must do [something].

8
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:50,044
Like, I have seen some people, even when I am giving lecture

9
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:52,626
they are doing like this or they are doing like that.

10
00:00:52,826 --> 00:00:57,508
This madness is not necessary. Just be quiet.

11
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:01,251
Quietitude (sic) is the best way to ascend.

12
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:05,141
I have said that there should be thoughtless awareness.

13
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:08,693
Just do it quietly. Your speed will reduce actually;

14
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:15,367
will come to a position when it is maximum for your quietitude.

15
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:20,810
Quietness within, the peace within, that’s very important.

16
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:24,282
If there is peace you will grow. There’s no other way out.

17
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:26,266
But you see, all this ritualism,

18
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:30,896
sometimes giving bandhan all the time or raising Kundalini all the time

19
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:36,169
and people even would like to see the table if it has vibrations!

20
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:41,583
That’s going too far. There’s no need to do all that nonsense.

21
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:46,328
Sahaja Yoga is sense, it’s not nonsense.
