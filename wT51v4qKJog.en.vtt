00:36:26.552 --> 00:36:32.299
[HINDI - We don't even know as to
what we are searching.]

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:45.560
[HINDI - Some people think that, if they
get power, they'll be very happy,]

00:36:46.578 --> 00:36:55.568
[HINDI - some think that, if they get too
much money, they'll be very pleased]

00:36:56.381 --> 00:37:08.021
[HINDI - and some people also think that, if they
become very powerful, they can overpower others]

00:37:12.058 --> 00:37:19.288
[HINDI - but in this seeking you are
seeking something else.]

00:37:20.249 --> 00:37:28.229
[HINDI - But if this seeking of yours is right
or good, still, even after attaining all this,]

00:37:28.229 --> 00:37:34.900
[HINDI - you are not happy, you have no
satisfaction even when you have got all this.]

00:37:41.456 --> 00:37:47.096
[HINDI - Then, what is the inherent
seeking you have?]

00:37:49.022 --> 00:37:59.612
[HINDI - It should not be difficult for us to
understand this because we are Indians living
in India.]

00:38:00.412 --> 00:38:06.692
[HINDI - We have been hearing day and night
since our childhood that beyond this world,]

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:17.623
[HINDI - beyond this illusion, is the joy of the
Spirit. We have to receive that joy of the Spirit.]

00:38:20.315 --> 00:38:27.045
[HINDI - And this seeking in this
Kaliyuga, I'm surprised,]

00:38:27.395 --> 00:38:36.506
[HINDI - is working out even more in
foreign countries as compared to India]

00:38:37.373 --> 00:38:48.253
[HINDI - and there's exportation of many
people from our country, who take people]

00:38:48.491 --> 00:39:00.671
[HINDI - to wrong paths and earn money. And
when we see those people, who believe in God]

00:39:01.177 --> 00:39:07.857
[HINDI - worship Him day and night, go to temples
all the time and are doing all charitable work]

00:39:08.634 --> 00:39:18.234
[HINDI - but they are not good humans,
there's no humanity in them, seeing this]

00:39:18.234 --> 00:39:23.597
[HINDI - we become remorseful and
we start thinking]

00:39:25.757 --> 00:39:31.247
[HINDI - what should we understand
from this pensiveness?]

00:39:31.772 --> 00:39:41.032
[HINDI - Is this a disappointment or
should we search in something else?]

00:39:44.751 --> 00:39:56.981
[HINDI - In the end when this search is one
with the Spirit(Atma) then we come to know]

00:39:57.475 --> 00:40:03.055
[HINDI - that we have to receive that joy,
which is known by various names like]

00:40:03.055 --> 00:40:10.591
[HINDI - Atmaanand, Paramanand
and Niraanand.]

00:40:12.844 --> 00:40:19.294
[HINDI - Like mad, some people, jump and dance
and think that they have received the joy.]

00:40:21.632 --> 00:40:32.142
[HINDI - Some people in disillusion think that if
they have taken drugs they have got great joy]

00:40:32.936 --> 00:40:42.756
[HINDI - . But this pleasure is so momentous this
they know and how harmful it is, this also they know.]

00:40:47.232 --> 00:40:53.422
Today, I'm talking to you about the
excitement people are seeking.

00:40:55.272 --> 00:41:11.222
Some sort of a sensational feeling. It seems
that our sensitivity has dulled so much

00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:24.908
that we need some sort of a nerve rocking
music or some sort of a sensational atmosphere

00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:39.965
that puts you into another kind of
personality where you become like a beast.

00:41:42.236 --> 00:41:46.846
You start jumping, you start shouting,
you start screaming -

00:41:47.727 --> 00:41:55.267
is a very common sight, in the West, when you
go there that people indulge into such things.

00:41:56.062 --> 00:42:04.279
Even very old people try to compete with
young people. They are so stupid sometimes.

00:42:05.669 --> 00:42:19.791
Like once I saw a documentary made in Los
Angeles, where some actors and actresses

00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:26.656
who were all above 90 years, were coming
for a shake dance. As it is, when they're

00:42:26.656 --> 00:42:31.749
getting out of their cars, they were shaking
as it is, there was no need to have a dance.

00:42:32.677 --> 00:42:37.117
There was already a dance going on. They
were carrying their sticks and shaking.

00:42:37.814 --> 00:42:47.854
And all these stupid thing are now also
trickling into our country very softly.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:58.140
Please remember, these are symptoms
of our destruction.

00:42:59.672 --> 00:43:08.552
Sitting down here we do not understand
what is the West and what is the East.

00:43:11.217 --> 00:43:20.377
For example, if you are going to New York,
you can't even wear your wedding ring.

00:43:20.992 --> 00:43:32.832
You don't know somebody may cut your finger
just for the wedding ring. Drug addiction is not the

00:43:32.832 --> 00:43:41.219
only problem. There are many other problems,
which we have no idea and we cannot

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:50.088
comprehend, what stupid things people are
doing in their frantic search for enjoyment.

00:43:53.343 --> 00:44:00.093
I do not blame them because they did
not have this heritage that we have,

00:44:00.451 --> 00:44:06.491
these great saints that we have had, the
great kings we have had in this country

00:44:11.304 --> 00:44:26.664
but we have nothing to learn from them. In
that frenzy, in that mad world, what you find

00:44:27.878 --> 00:44:35.378
that so many of them are trying to break
that cocoon and trying to find out the reality

00:44:36.274 --> 00:44:50.874
because it is too much oppressive, it is too much
for them to bear any more for human consumption

00:44:52.356 --> 00:45:01.106
and that's why their seeking is very deep.
Even the hippies that you know of, are really,

00:45:01.106 --> 00:45:09.321
actually, they were real seekers. Of course,
so many are lost but they were real seekers,

00:45:09.699 --> 00:45:16.369
seekers of Truth, of that joy, of that
eternal life which was promised to them.

00:45:18.366 --> 00:45:24.416
But as luck could have it, in this lifetime
they couldn't get it, many a times.

00:45:27.367 --> 00:45:41.718
But for us, we, we are ancient people. If in
Germany anybody sees the Swastika, he gets a fright.

00:45:42.928 --> 00:45:49.464
He doesn't know this is the symbol, in our
country, of auspiciousness and holiness,

00:45:49.721 --> 00:45:58.521
for thousands of years. Of course, the complete
Swastika is very different from the one that

00:45:58.692 --> 00:46:07.292
Hitler chose. And when he used stencils
in the right way, it was alright but

00:46:07.292 --> 00:46:11.812
when he started using the other way
round, is disgusting sight.

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:22.488
All these symbols that we are using,
are absolutely existing within us.

00:46:25.256 --> 00:46:38.656
We had once two very great scientists,
who asked Me about the symbol of 'Aum'.

00:46:41.407 --> 00:46:52.737
I said that, "If you can make the model of the
Carbon atom," because the first chakra of Mooladhara

00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:14.890
the quality is that of Carbon because the Carbon is
the element which is used to create that chakra.

00:47:16.427 --> 00:47:24.237
And I said that, "You take the photograph
of that atom." I said, "One from the left

00:47:24.237 --> 00:47:28.881
to the right and then from right to the
left and one from down upward."

00:47:30.253 --> 00:47:35.603
And when they took the photograph,
on the right side what do they see -

00:47:35.603 --> 00:47:45.032
from the left when they took, the complete
'Aum' is there and they took the another one

00:47:45.105 --> 00:47:56.295
from the right to the left, what do they see,
is Swastika. And when they took it from below

00:47:56.994 --> 00:48:10.404
it was the cross. It exists within us as
Carbon atom. As scientists, you know

00:48:10.404 --> 00:48:21.245
we have to have Carbon to have Organic
Chemistry. Without Organic Chemistry

00:48:22.535 --> 00:48:30.397
life cannot be made but to that is added Nitrogen
and that's how amino acids have formed.

00:48:32.365 --> 00:48:38.625
That is how the evolution has taken place
through these different centers within us, which

00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:51.256
are just like milestones built on our central
path or we can call it, in Sushumna Naadi.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:49:01.710
And these centers represent all the
evolution we have gone through.

00:49:04.223 --> 00:49:15.083
This is our past which is built-in within
us. And now, the last. The last is the

00:49:15.083 --> 00:49:22.664
seventh center of Sahastrara, which is in the
medical terminology called as Limbic area.

00:49:25.946 --> 00:49:37.656
It covers, like this, as a lotus and when the
Kundalini rises or awakens, it opens beautifully -

00:49:38.491 --> 00:49:47.911
in Sanskrit called as 'Sahastra Chedam'. Because
the Modern Science has come from West,

00:49:47.911 --> 00:49:51.857
that doesn't mean that India
never had any Science.

00:49:52.376 --> 00:50:02.126
It had very much advanced Science but the
attention of the saints and the scientists in those days

00:50:02.126 --> 00:50:12.152
was not on the material exploration but on the
inner being and that's how they discovered

00:50:13.466 --> 00:50:23.616
that within us are all these centers
which are the milestones of our evolution

00:50:24.336 --> 00:50:38.606
and also there is this power of Kundalini,
which has to be awakened by some authority,

00:50:38.606 --> 00:50:52.671
Spiritual authority and if it is awakened,
then it passes through these six centers,

00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:59.279
not the seventh one but the six centers -
the seventh one, also called as the first one,

00:50:59.279 --> 00:51:08.996
is below the Kundalini, to pierce through
the fontanel bone area, which gives you

00:51:08.996 --> 00:51:17.387
the actualization of Self-realization, which
you call as baptism. It's nothing artificial

00:51:18.337 --> 00:51:25.477
Now is the inner [UNCLEAR] to do, to be
treated as a hypothesis, if you are a scientist

00:51:25.477 --> 00:51:30.015
and keep your mind open and see for
yourself it is working or not.

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:43.183
If it works, it is the Truth and once you
have an open mind and the half-baked people,

00:51:43.183 --> 00:51:52.849
who are neither here nor there, have no
idea as to what was the knowledge we had

00:51:52.849 --> 00:52:00.679
in our country for centuries and that is
knowledge of roots to give Self-realization.

00:52:04.245 --> 00:52:14.435
Of course it was not given to each and
every person. Very selective after they

00:52:14.435 --> 00:52:26.091
self-validated, like Raja Janaka, who gave
Self-realization to Nachiketa, after taking

00:52:26.091 --> 00:52:36.869
his test for days together but today it is
very different. As I told you yesterday,

00:52:36.869 --> 00:52:44.820
it is the blossom time. This is the promised time
of Last judgment. Even in the Koran it is said

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:54.568
that 'Your hands will speak when the Kiama
will come,' means the resurrection time.

00:52:54.568 --> 00:53:07.162
When the resurrection time will come, then your
hands will speak. It is said in all our Scriptures,

00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:16.419
whether it is in India, China or anywhere,
that you have to get your Self-realization.

00:53:17.983 --> 00:53:24.463
That is the most important thing about
which Buddha also wrote and Mahavira

00:53:24.463 --> 00:53:32.327
also emphasized. They did not want to talk of
God even because if they start talking of God,

00:53:32.327 --> 00:53:40.330
then people just become enamored by that
because they say they are God or the people

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:45.025
start thinking, "Oh, we have one God,
so it's alright. We can do what we like,

00:53:45.025 --> 00:53:53.634
God will look after us." Then your desire,
you have your Self-realization.

00:53:53.634 --> 00:53:59.512
As we have many in India, they think, if
they go to the temple their spirituality

00:53:59.512 --> 00:54:05.761
is over. If they, in the morning, do little pooja
in the house, then their spirituality is over.

00:54:07.218 --> 00:54:18.368
It is not. You have to get your Self-realization.
That is, your Spirit has to come in your attention.

00:54:19.298 --> 00:54:32.198
The Spirit is the witness of the play. It's
watching the play of all your activities, everything

00:54:32.945 --> 00:54:39.895
but is not in your attention but when you
get your realization, then the Spirit

00:54:41.472 --> 00:54:57.912
comes as light in your attention and you get
Bodha. The Christians, who were just after Christ,

00:54:58.186 --> 00:55:04.986
got realization, were called as Gnostics.
Now the word 'gna' as you know 'gyana',

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:12.840
we say gyana. 'Gna' means knowledge.
Knowledge is not mental knowledge but

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:19.395
knowledge on your Central Nervous system.
And these gnostics were tortured and troubled

00:55:19.395 --> 00:55:26.273
by many bishops and who called them, this
is a blasphemy, they have no powers.

00:55:27.096 --> 00:55:32.426
As a result, when Thomas when he was
coming - the disciple of Christ, Saint Thomas -

00:55:32.426 --> 00:55:40.725
when he was coming to India, he wrote all
the treatise and hid them in a beautiful jar

00:55:40.725 --> 00:55:47.369
in Egypt, which was found only about 50 years
back and now being decoded and surprisingly

00:55:47.432 --> 00:55:58.722
it's called third [UNCLEAR] that, it is a
spontaneous happening that has to come

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:07.790
within you and that has to give you enlightenment.
But this book is now going to be banned, I think,

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:15.872
because it's just going against all these churches
and all these people, who have created huge, big

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:24.972
organizations in the name of God and Christ.
Because it is talking about Self realization only.

00:56:29.571 --> 00:56:37.571
Also we have in the West, another problem of
people who call themselves intellectuals,

00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:45.343
who are rather perverted in their brains. They want
to deny all that has been written down so far,

00:56:46.245 --> 00:56:53.265
they don't want to accept that there is
God, with them Spirituality is a myth

00:56:54.775 --> 00:56:59.689
and they are only there to criticize
everything that is in them.

00:57:02.525 --> 00:57:09.905
This criticism in the West, I know presently things
are too much and as a result of this criticism,

00:57:10.756 --> 00:57:19.376
not only of God but of beauty and of all
beautiful creations of artists criticize,

00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:29.731
so there are no more Rembrandts, no more
Michaelangelos - they're all finished.

00:57:30.339 --> 00:57:39.819
No body will have even strength to come up to
say that, "We are artists." This is the situation.

00:57:42.366 --> 00:57:51.126
This intellectual criticism has become
a gift built-in in the West. I hope this

00:57:51.126 --> 00:57:55.949
doesn't trickle down to our country though
our media has to be very careful.

00:57:56.648 --> 00:58:05.468
To keep to their personality as Indians
and not as Western journalists, who want

00:58:05.468 --> 00:58:12.614
to have all the time something stupid and
controversial. The other day, I asked some

00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:18.937
journalist that, "Why are you writing all these
things about Me." He said, "Mother, I must confess

00:58:18.937 --> 00:58:26.221
that as I am a scoundrel." I said, "Better
write that instead of writing such a thing."

00:58:26.464 --> 00:58:34.744
So all these things are there which are working
as negative forces and this is the best time

00:58:35.697 --> 00:58:42.867
for you to have your ascent, to get to
your Spirit, to know your Spirit.

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:50.220
This is true as [UNCLEAR] has said that,
"Once you get your Self-realization,

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:59.498
most of your problems just disappear." Now
how it happens, how these problems disappear?

00:59:00.951 --> 00:59:07.911
Supposing, you are standing in the deep
water and you see waves coming and going

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:12.100
and you are afraid of these waves. You're
watching them and you are all the time

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:17.111
frightened that now I'll be drowned but
supposing you are saved and put on a boat,

00:59:18.331 --> 00:59:25.801
then you can watch these waves, also enjoy
them. But supposing you learn swimming,

00:59:25.801 --> 00:59:32.936
you become a master of swimming, you can
jump down and save others. Today that kind of a

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:40.855
special atmosphere is around, as I told you
yesterday, that this All-Pervading Power

00:59:41.255 --> 00:59:48.780
has become now dynamic because it is
Kritayuga and this dynamism of this Kritayuga

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:57.640
is going to work out everything so beautifully,
so miraculously, that you can't believe

00:59:58.846 --> 01:00:07.196
because the Divine itself, is very anxious
that you should enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:00:08.207 --> 01:00:14.087
And that's how it is going to work out but
those people, who are going to shun the Truth

01:00:14.087 --> 01:00:22.757
and those who have also shut their eyes to the
Reality, will be responsible for misleading others.

01:00:25.466 --> 01:00:29.786
But what is the advantage, why
should we do it?

01:00:30.217 --> 01:00:40.167
By doing this kind of destructive work,
what is the result?

01:00:41.512 --> 01:00:48.982
What are we going to get out of it?
Instead of that, why not see for yourself,

01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:57.203
if it is possible to give realization to
thousands of people and if, transformation

01:00:57.203 --> 01:01:04.149
of these lives is possible, why shouldn't
we all work it out to say to the whole world?

01:01:04.149 --> 01:01:12.408
And if in this country of ours, which I know is the
holy country, we can do it better than anyone else,

01:01:12.408 --> 01:01:17.874
why not we, instead of following this kind
of a group and that kind of a sangha,

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:27.678
why not we become the Spirit, the powerful
Spirit and the power is that of love.

01:01:29.806 --> 01:01:38.336
Love, which is like the sap in the tree, rises,
goes to the various areas, it is either

01:01:38.336 --> 01:01:47.684
evaporated or it comes back to the roots. It
does not get attached to any part, to any flower

01:01:48.293 --> 01:01:55.773
because if it gets involved into one flower, the
tree will be killed and the flower will be killed.

01:01:58.167 --> 01:02:07.447
This love, which you call as Nirvaajya in
Sanskrit language, is the power of God's love,

01:02:08.073 --> 01:02:17.733
which is so encouraging, so considerate,
so delicately it works out everything.

01:02:18.222 --> 01:02:30.702
Now think of a seed, if you plant it in the soil,
how the root comes out and at the end of the root

01:02:30.702 --> 01:02:38.108
there is a very small little cell, which
is very intelligent, which goes around

01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:44.819
and sees the passage if it is there and
supposing there is a boulder, then it goes

01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:49.726
round that boulder, to create a support
for the future tree.

01:02:51.094 --> 01:02:58.084
From where does this intelligence come?
It's from the same Power of Love of God.

01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:14.350
This Power of Love is so kind, so generous,
it forgives whatever we might have done.

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:20.106
It does not want to bother you about what
has happened or what you have been doing,

01:03:20.106 --> 01:03:26.745
what wrong you have done - no. It's only
aim is to give you your Self-realization.

01:03:29.651 --> 01:03:42.471
And later on to give you all the proof, all the
pranmaan, that there is God and there is His love,

01:03:42.812 --> 01:03:53.532
which looks after, which guides us, which
gives us all the blessings that we want.

01:03:55.292 --> 01:04:09.082
These blessings are already there but we
cannot receive it. If you go to the river Ganges

01:04:10.516 --> 01:04:19.616
and do not want to fill your pitcher, the
river Ganges cannot do anything about it.

01:04:21.462 --> 01:04:30.972
You have to have desire yourself to
get the nectar of these blessings.

01:04:32.434 --> 01:04:44.204
When we think about ourselves, we think a very
mundane manner but we are not mundane people.

01:04:44.432 --> 01:04:51.692
As I told you yesterday, look at our eyes, what
a camera, look at our brain, what a computer!

01:04:52.143 --> 01:05:01.923
We are not mundane, we are not ordinary people,
we are not animals. We are much above all of them.

01:05:03.013 --> 01:05:12.956
Just a little more journey for you to be
that state of bliss. It is to be experienced.

01:05:12.956 --> 01:05:20.245
Yesterday all of you felt the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost, as they say, which is

01:05:20.245 --> 01:05:28.175
described by Adi Shakaracharya 'Saleelam,
saleelam' means He's called this Saundrya Lahiri

01:05:30.943 --> 01:05:37.923
They always felt in olden days are those
which have written that they are in a realm

01:05:37.929 --> 01:05:45.109
where people are not yet and how to bring
them up within. Kabira has said,

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:49.350
[HINDI COUPLET - Kaise samjahaoon sab jag
andha] means, how to make them understand ,
the whole world is blind.

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:57.220
It is very, very difficult to convince people
that there is another beautiful world waiting

01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:06.189
for you, to receive you - very difficult. To them
these mundane things are reality - but is not -

01:06:06.679 --> 01:06:19.481
and this, if you can ask within yourself,
you can get it because the biggest time of

01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:27.075
blossoming has come and this is really a
very, very great time that you are born

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:36.150
at this time in this country. We have to
understand our concern, which is very great

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:44.891
based on pujas. All the culture is built on
pujas. Also in West it was [UNCLEAR] it was

01:06:44.891 --> 01:06:53.055
but not anymore, not anymore. But even
now in our country we have this puja,

01:06:53.055 --> 01:07:02.265
which is built-in within us and the sense of
morality is there. But, despite all these things,

01:07:04.139 --> 01:07:11.219
our attention is not towards God. Our
attention is not towards becoming the Spirit.

01:07:12.073 --> 01:07:17.653
We have very funny ideas that if we become
the Spirit, God knows what will happen,

01:07:17.653 --> 01:07:21.422
will be become a sanyasi, we'll have to leave
our treasures, we'll have to go away.

01:07:21.422 --> 01:07:29.325
In Sahaja yoga you don't have to leave
anything, you become within yourself.

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:37.757
It's the becoming which is important. We do not
have anymore [UNCLEAR] it's the becoming.

01:07:37.757 --> 01:07:43.568
And the becoming is only possible that once
you get your Self-realization, you have to

01:07:43.568 --> 01:07:49.367
go to the Collective, as I told you yesterday
but when you go to the collective, there only

01:07:49.367 --> 01:07:58.472
the cleansing will take place automatically.
You all have heard many a times about Kundalini

01:07:58.472 --> 01:08:05.077
and the chakras [UNCLEAR] also for
you to see.

01:08:05.077 --> 01:08:12.355
But the actual experience of Self-realization is
what you should ask for, otherwise what's the use?

01:08:12.474 --> 01:08:18.694
There are so many people giving lectures all over.
What's the use of listening to any lecture?

01:08:18.785 --> 01:08:26.695
We have had enough of this - the brain is
full of it but now no more of these talks.

01:08:26.695 --> 01:08:39.808
In Maharashtra it is said [MARATHI COUPLET].
Let us have it. Thus great joy which is promised

01:08:39.808 --> 01:08:51.429
to us in all the scriptures. It's very easy, it's
Sahaja and I'm surprised because how people,

01:08:51.429 --> 01:09:01.444
who, I never expect, just jump so deep
and understand. For example,

01:09:01.444 --> 01:09:05.527
[UNCLEAR]

01:09:06.157 --> 01:09:14.625
but in God realization, the way you
understood it in such a short time

01:09:14.985 --> 01:09:21.516
I thought already you people were Sahaja
[UNCLEAR]

01:09:23.086 --> 01:09:30.346
There are many people like that, whom I've
met, they may be rich or poor, maybe anywhere,

01:09:30.465 --> 01:09:40.995
who just immediately get the experience
and also know the greatness within them.

01:09:43.992 --> 01:09:59.272
Deep, inside of us, is the ocean of bliss, of
joy but we have to take our attention inside

01:09:59.598 --> 01:10:07.028
and that only happens when Kundalini rises,
your attention is taken inside and you feel it.

01:10:07.624 --> 01:10:14.974
This is what it is one has to ask for. The
rest of the things you'll find are insipid

01:10:14.974 --> 01:10:21.653
and useless. No use wasting time for
these things but to enjoy yourself.

01:10:23.389 --> 01:10:36.959
How it happens, how a seed sprouts. You
sow a seed. The seed has all the maps of

01:10:36.959 --> 01:10:43.195
all the trees it is going to produce, it has
an idea and this Mother Earth has the power

01:10:43.195 --> 01:10:50.601
to germinate it - that's all. You don't
have to stand on your head, you don't have

01:10:50.601 --> 01:11:00.264
to go to read some book or to [UNCLEAR]
idea. It is so spontaneous,

01:11:00.264 --> 01:11:12.360
it is so simple. This simple trait is to be
enjoyed, that's what we're here for, today

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:24.850
and I think, I should now request you all to get
your realization but people who are intelligent,

01:11:25.836 --> 01:11:31.746
really super intelligent, I should say,
jump into Sahaja yoga very fast.

01:11:33.221 --> 01:11:39.331
We had people in Sahaja yoga, who always
got a top degree, were first class first

01:11:40.303 --> 01:11:50.473
and also those who are very dedicated and
very affectionate, simple people, get their

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:59.435
realization without any difficulty. It is
very surprising and amazing, how in the villages -

01:11:59.435 --> 01:12:05.383
this time I went to Srirampur, there were many
people, about a thousand people there and

01:12:05.383 --> 01:12:13.723
each one of them got realization. So it is
working so fast. As I told you yesterday,

01:12:13.723 --> 01:12:20.595
no organization can work that fast as it
is working. We have no membership, we have

01:12:20.595 --> 01:12:27.749
no register of members - nothing but people
are becoming Sahaja yogis, all over the world.

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:41.985
So, as is here, basically as Maharashtrians,
people who speak Marathi, we have great capacity

01:12:42.999 --> 01:12:55.369
to express our Spirituality to others. Our
young boys, our younger women have really

01:12:55.369 --> 01:13:03.581
sparked the whole country. Instead of wasting
their time in drugs and nonsensical things

01:13:03.581 --> 01:13:14.114
they have really achieved self vision because,
as I told you yesterday, that now the

01:13:14.114 --> 01:13:22.090
time of Bodhisattwa, the future Buddha has
come. At the time of Buddha, it was all

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:36.323
kinds of rituals and all kinds of hardship,
individual progress was there to achieve the

01:13:36.323 --> 01:13:46.312
state of Buddha - bodh. Bodh, meaning, to
know on you Central Nervous System but in

01:13:46.312 --> 01:13:55.574
the future, the Bodhisattwa has to come
and the Bodhisattwa is the one, who receives

01:13:55.574 --> 01:14:03.763
Self-realization because he's Buddha but
he's capable of giving realization to others,

01:14:05.031 --> 01:14:11.361
if he has come as the benevolent of the
whole society. He works for the benevolence

01:14:11.361 --> 01:14:17.389
of the society. He doesn't have to run away from
the society, he doesn't have to take to sanyasa,

01:14:17.389 --> 01:14:25.544
nothing of the kind but he becomes that and he
gives it to others. This is what is a Bodhisattwa

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:34.892
and this is the time of Bodhisattwa. Buddha's
time now over, Christ's time now over.

01:14:35.464 --> 01:14:41.974
Now whatever They have prophesied, this
is the time to be fulfilled and we all,

01:14:42.023 --> 01:14:48.753
whatever religion we may follow, whatever ideas
we may have, we take to our Self-realization

01:14:48.967 --> 01:14:59.917
and then see everything in the light of our
Spirit. I hope you people have understood

01:14:59.931 --> 01:15:09.841
what is My desire is. I'm quite desirous that
all of you should not only get your Self-realization

01:15:09.841 --> 01:15:18.922
but you should go deep into your own being
and all your powers should be expressed.

01:15:18.922 --> 01:15:25.136
A Mother wants that Her child should be
greater than the Mother - why not?

01:15:25.317 --> 01:15:36.807
You can do it, you should try. Just work it
out in a very simple way. As I requested you,

01:15:36.807 --> 01:15:42.013
that you have to go to the collective, if
you want to have your cleansing done,

01:15:42.013 --> 01:15:50.742
forgetting what is your position, what is
your [UNCLEAR] and you'll be surprised,

01:15:50.742 --> 01:15:55.778
in that collective the microcosm of
yours will become the macrocosm -

01:15:56.339 --> 01:16:07.449
a drop becomes the ocean. That's what you have
to become - the ocean, as that was [UNCLEAR]

01:16:07.449 --> 01:16:15.001
in Pasayadaan, for which things have been
described very beautifully, is the modern times,

01:16:15.001 --> 01:16:27.706
where He says that, 'Let the forests of
Kalptaru walk - they are Sahaja yogis,

01:16:29.849 --> 01:16:42.504
let the ocean of talking Ambrosia walk go
ahead - what are, they are Sahaja yogis

01:16:43.604 --> 01:16:47.884
and they become your relations
taking towards Sahaja Yog.

01:16:49.599 --> 01:16:56.339
Gyaneshwara has seen the vision of Yoga,
meaning the sustenance [UNCLEAR]

01:16:56.339 --> 01:17:01.839
He has seen the vision of all the saints,
[UNCLEAR]

01:17:01.839 --> 01:17:08.140
He has seen the vision of these
happenings He has described very clearly,

01:17:08.348 --> 01:17:17.808
very clearly. And also he had written it
long time back. Bhrigumuni has described

01:17:17.808 --> 01:17:24.645
the time when the Kundalini will rise and people
will achieve their good health and good mind.

01:17:25.061 --> 01:17:30.721
It's all described all the people will be
realized and the time has come when

01:17:30.721 --> 01:17:35.354
you should have whatever has been
prophesized and whatever has been promised.

01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:44.659
So why not, we take the full advantage
of it. I'm trying to give you

01:17:44.919 --> 01:17:51.879
[UNCLEAR] where you can really understand
that we haven't got the Absolute,

01:17:51.879 --> 01:17:57.217
we have to get to the Absolute
and this is very important

01:17:57.217 --> 01:18:02.006
because we are living in a relative world
and crossing from this end to that end.

01:18:03.259 --> 01:18:14.699
So we have to be in the Absolute. I wish
today, all of you get your realization and

01:18:14.699 --> 01:18:23.877
you go in the collective and master this,
master this Shudh Vidya (Pure Knowledge).

01:18:23.877 --> 01:18:31.406
You have to know all about it.
May God bless you!
