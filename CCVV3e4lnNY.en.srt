Thank you very much

16

Somebody will translate Me or...

17
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,240
The song is written by a relation of ours.

18
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,760
He was a convert to Christianity, but a realized soul, and

19
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,840
he could never cope with the system of conversion

20
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,960
and also the way the Hindus were treated among themselves,

21
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,040
with the caste system, and all that,

22
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,880
and he has written very good,

23
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,120
some of the very good hymns, I should say,

24
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,400
this is one of the hymns.

25
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,840
The song is something

26
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,880
I really always used to sing in my childhood very much,

27
00:05:48,240 --> 00:06:02,320
and the theme of the song is like this:

28
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,400
"The one who has got God,

29
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,280
or the one who has owned the God,

30
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,200
why should he have any fear?

31
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,880
The one

32
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:47,080
who moves about or the one who goes about..."

33
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
I don't know what is the English word for

34
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,920
'extensive travelling'.

35
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,600
The one who moves about extensively,

36
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:05,440
for the sake of God and for doing good to others,

37
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,320
but he does not belong to this world,

38
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,720
such a person has no fear.

39
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,320
He stands above...

40
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,720
-the language, Marathi language you see, is a very,

41
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,120
very intense language, I should say, and it touches many corners

42
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,880
when you say one word to it. It's like this one is:

43
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,760
"Adhi Vyadhi Varana Varati Payi Asha Purusha Chari."

44
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:57,560
It means: A person of this caliber is standing above.

45
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,200
His foot is above the sickness,

46
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,720
the mental problems,

47
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,360
and the death itself.

48
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,840
But when you say that

49
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,040
such a person has the foot on top of this, means also,

50
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,560
you see, it's meaning is, that with the effect of his foot,

51
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
it can get over it.

52
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,640
It's a double language you see.

53
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,320
Like such a person has his foot on top of all these three things,

54
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:37,240
is the sickness, the mental problems, and the death.

55
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,960
The foot is on top of that.

56
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,120
It means that such a person is above this.

57
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,960
Thus, if you have somebody of this caliber

58
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,160
and the foot touches the sick,

59
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,920
or the mentally disturbed people,

60
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,720
or the dead,

61
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,480
such a person can raise them higher,

62
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,040
can take them out of it.

63
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,880
It has a double meaning.

64
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,920
So the whole theme works out this way:

65
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,600
that the person who belongs to God,

66
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,280
who owns the God,

67
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,480
should not have fear,

68
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,120
should not get frustrated.

69
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,840
I needed it very much today.

70
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,320
Because one side of course, is

71
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,160
the joy of seeing so many Sahaja Yogis, real Sahaja Yogis,

72
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,280
not artificial disciples or dramatists,

73
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,240
but real Sahaja Yogis of very high caliber,

74
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,480
and some of the people who stand on the periphery,

75
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,400
have been on periphery for such a long time,

76
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,800
that's, sometimes is dangerous for Me to see

77
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,120
they will be destroyed.

78
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,920
At this time, you need a song like this

79
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,760
and in childhood whenever I felt really desperate,

80
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,760
I used to sing this song.

81
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,240
It's a very touching song.

82
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,240
All right?

83
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,160
But word by word I could not.

84
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm not in a, sort of a proper mood I think.

85
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,200
So it's touched Me very much.

86
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,640
This is Rutambhara  Pragnya.

87
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,080
I wanted it very much today.

88
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:38,240
So this morning I was telling you about this new awareness.

89
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,560
Pragnya. 'Gnya' means the knowledge

90
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,520
and 'Pra' means the awakened knowledge.

91
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,760
Which comes out of meditation,

92
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,960
sustenance of meditation,

93
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,400
and then the Samadhi is the effect of that.

94
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:09,600
It's a kind of a fruit ripening.

95
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:17,160
When this ripens, then you get the taste,

96
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,400
the sweetness of character,

97
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,120
and then you start seeing around,

98
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,120
how the Nature, the Divine,

99
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,640
is sweetly playing with you.

100
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,120
This state must be achieved.

101
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,520
For every Sahaja Yogi, it is important

102
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,800
that they must achieve this state,

103
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,760
because unless and until you have minimum achieved this state,

104
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,880
you'll be still in a dangerous zone,

105
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,800
which, as I told you, upsets Me very much.

106
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,240
So everybody must decide to reach a state

107
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:15,960
where you every day see the blessings of God manifesting.

108
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,880
That means you enter into the kingdom of God.

109
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,080
This is the kingdom of God,

110
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,920
in which you are looked after, protected, guided,

111
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,760
and properly taken to the place of heavenly bliss.

112
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,760
Through material manifestation,

113
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,360
through mental manifestation,

114
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,480
through financial manifestation,

115
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,720
through relationship manifestation,

116
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,480
through so many things,

117
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,800
and also the natural manifestation

118
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:02,560
by which you see the sun, the moon, the stars, the heavens,

119
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,080
and all the five elements help you.

120
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,280
This state, all of you must achieve.

121
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,520
All of you. Again the word is 'all' of you should achieve.

122
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,760
And then only the higher ascent works out.

123
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:43,160
Now, "How to achieve this state?" is a common question.

124
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,200
Now, the first thing as I told you today,

125
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
that you are extremely fortunate people,

126
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,480
compared to all the seekers of the world,

127
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,880
who have been, who will be, and who are.

128
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,960
Because so many things are,

129
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,080
which were used by seekers to overcome,

130
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,160
you don't have to overcome.

131
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,360
For example they used to meditate, say,

132
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,600
on some name of God,

133
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,360
and the attention would go on, say, repeating the name

134
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,960
of, praying to that God,

135
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,480
or thinking about that God and all that,

136
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,200
but the whole thing would be mechanical,

137
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,520
and always they would jump into some sort of a

138
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,880
low type of a siddhi, so-called, means they get possessed.

139
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:54,480
Those people who start taking the name, say, of Rama,

140
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,680
you have seen so many of them,

141
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,520
they start jumping,

142
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,520
and they start behaving in a funny manner.

143
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,960
So the attention instead of being, becoming concentrated,

144
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:17,160
would become extremely disturbed, very disturbed,

145
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,040
and a funny attention, wobbly-type.

146
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,920
And when they became wobbly,

147
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,680
and a kind of a left-sidedness came into them,

148
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:37,160
they would go on enjoying it,

149
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,600
just like a drunkard enjoys.

150
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,080
Then such people would weep, cry,

151
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,560
enjoy their crying, trouble others by their crying,

152
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,800
and they would not have power to overcome that.

153
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,880
So much they would be possessed.

154
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,960
Then another kind who were, say, ambitious people,

155
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,080
like we have many scientists, and these kind of people,

156
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:07,280
ambitious people, they would get auto-hypnotized.

157
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,600
Thinking no end of themselves,

158
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,480
behaving in the most stupid manner

159
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,520
and also they would get possessed,

160
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,960
and you can see people like Hitler, and all sorts.

161
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,920
So many of these people today,

162
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,480
who are ruling the world, supposed to be

163
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,320
in democracy or, say, communism, or anyway.

164
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:38,240
Most of them are actually the despots

165
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,640
and that's why the chaos today.

166
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,680
And a theme like nationalistic-spirit

167
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,120
or something like that they would develop,

168
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
and try to take the advantage

169
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,760
of people's right-sidedness and involve them into wars,

170
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,880
and all sorts of destructive things.

171
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,200
This kind of attention

172
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,480
is possible for people who think they are very great,

173
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,280
say, Hindus, Christians, mostly they are warring people.

174
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,680
Muslims... Nowadays the Muslims are all warring, imagine,

175
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,000
among themselves, that's the best part of it.

176
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,920
And the Christians are all warring among themselves.

177
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,880
And the Hindus are all warring among themselves.

178
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,680
Like there are only two nations

179
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,960
where there is Hindu majority, so called, is

180
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,040
one is Nepal, and one is India,

181
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,960
and all the time they are quarrelling.

182
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,200
There's not one day passes

183
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,560
without hearing some news of some sort of a quarrel,

184
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,240
because Hindus won't use the swords,

185
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,120
but a very cold-blooded quarrel is on.

186
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,640
So this is the situation.

187
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,360
In the name of God, again I say,

188
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,880
because they started on a very different level,

189
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,800
and their attention goes left or right,

190
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,600
and they develop those siddhis.

191
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,360
So what have we to do?

192
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,800
First of all, by God's grace, as I told you,

193
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,600
you all are realized people

194
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,640
so your ascent is made in the center,

195
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,080
which is a very, very, difficult thing,

196
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,920
absolutely difficult, no doubt.

197
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,200
But you should learn to keep in the center.

198
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,880
But how to keep the attention in the center

199
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,080
is the problem for many people

200
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:51,560
who are still not above themselves.

201
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,320
Now when you meditate,

202
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,480
try to meditate in a sustained way, first of all sustain it.

203
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,320
Then you find

204
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,880
that you are getting into the state

205
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,240
of Samadhi, means at a state

206
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,960
where you start feeling the joy

207
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,240
and the bliss of God's blessings,

208
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,480
and then you start saying "O God, what a blessing,

209
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,040
what a blessing, and what a blessing".

210
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,360
Once you have reached that state

211
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,960
then you have to realize "Who am I".

212
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,720
Who are you?

213
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,080
What are you?

214
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,000
You are the Spirit.

215
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:08,280
After establishing your sustained attention on the Spirit

216
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,800
you'll develop a state where you'll be

217
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,840
in a complete state of witnessing with joy.

218
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,280
Now those, say, who are here,

219
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,960
can judge themselves very simply in a way.

220
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,800
Those who tried to have the best rooms,

221
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,160
they must have booked ten days ahead of time

222
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,280
then must have done this, that, to get a good room.

223
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,480
Those who want to have the best food,

224
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,000
or the best time, tried to have a position, in the mind.

225
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,960
Face yourself honestly.

226
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,080
Sahaja Yoga is an honest endeavor.

227
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,800
The best privacy for themselves.

228
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,760
You all should face yourself.

229
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,960
Then the husband/wife, they want the privacy to themselves.

230
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,120
This is not the time for husband/wife to be gathered

231
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,480
or for you to talk loudly and move about and have fun.

232
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,680
No, this is meditative time you have come for.

233
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,200
Is very short time according to Me,

234
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:28,080
because people spend thousands and thousands of days

235
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,160
to establish their meditative mood.

236
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,480
But in this speedy life

237
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,560
you have to have intensity to establish.

238
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,240
So get into meditative mood. Some people feel

239
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,080
that they have come for a proper

240
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,600
holiday making and there's no sea here,

241
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,840
so how will they have a swim -- sort of temperament.

242
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,560
Those who are not so badly off,

243
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,600
would be asking for more comfort,

244
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,360
"I couldn't get food, I should have this,

245
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,640
the best to be given to my child,

246
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,360
or to my husband, or to my wife." "My."

247
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,520
It doesn't matter for one day or night you sleep,

248
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,200
boys together and ladies together.

249
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,240
If there are children, all right,

250
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,720
but there's no need, for husband/wife to sleep together

251
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,560
in this time when you are meditating all in one room, at all.

252
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,360
You have come for a very special purpose here.

253
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:38,880
You have paid for it!

254
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,600
So be meditative.

255
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,480
What I find, everybody was talking loudly.

256
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,480
I didn't find them in that meditative mood.

257
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,600
Everybody was thinking they are enjoying here,

258
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,400
very much nice, good, you see.

259
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,320
All these ideas are old ideas.

260
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,200
The silence must be established within and without.

261
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,000
I must say, for this, of course Indians are,

262
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,200
they know all that so I would not say Indian qualities,

263
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,200
but Australia.

264
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,120
Australia, I stayed there in all these Ashrams.

265
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,560
In Sydney we had fifty to sixty people living there

266
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,680
every day. I never heard a voice

267
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,320
or even the movement of the foot till I was there,

268
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,920
when I was there. And I was not there for a day or so,

269
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,840
I was there for about ten, fifteen days.

270
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,320
Not even the movement and the children crying, nothing,

271
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,880
I never heard a sound.

272
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:57,200
This was one of the ways you can control your attention,

273
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,520
that in My presence, what do you speak?

274
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,280
What do you say?

275
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
You must know the protocol part of it.

276
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,320
Whom are you talking?

277
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,040
You can't make fun, you can't joke.

278
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,280
I can joke.

279
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,080
You can sometimes smile, all right, or laugh sometimes,

280
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,560
but it has to be done with a weight.

281
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,680
Whom are you talking to. The reason is,

282
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,400
I'm talking to you all this,

283
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,960
because it's only all this rapport,

284
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,320
all this behavior is going to help you.

285
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,880
I'm not going to be helped.

286
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm not going to be saved,

287
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,080
I'm not going to get My realization.

288
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,920
It is you who have to gain something out of Me.

289
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,600
So try to settle your attention with that.

290
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,760
I've seen people who stay with Me sometimes.

291
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,040
Sometimes I deliberately call them to see what's the problem is.

292
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,000
Some of them who stay with Me, I find,

293
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,960
become subtler and subtler and subtler and deeper.

294
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,440
And some of them start taking advantage,

295
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:28,160
taking liberties, then taking a kind of a course of life

296
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,640
which is so mundane and so stupid

297
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,640
that I can't understand.

298
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,800
So this awareness should be within your heart,

299
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,040
that the time is very important.

300
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,760
You have come here at a very, very important time.

301
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
And that when you are with Me,

302
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,720
is the most important time, of that important time.

303
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,920
Historically this is the most important time,

304
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,960
and take full advantage in the real sense of the word.

305
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,680
Some people think if they can get some money out of Me

306
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,480
then it's a big advantage. All right, you can take it.

307
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,280
Some people think if they can take some of My time,

308
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,960
they are at a very great advantage. All right you can, have it.

309
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,360
Or some people think if they can take advantage of Me,

310
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,720
sort of feeling ego-pampered or something-

311
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,200
"I m a great lord" and some sort of a thing, you know

312
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,240
All right!

313
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,240
But those who are wise take the best advantage

314
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,840
and the best advantage is the growth within.

315
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,360
So the first awareness has to be

316
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,000
that you are such lucky people

317
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,280
that before you stands someone

318
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,920
who has the control over all the centers,

319
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,400
over all the powers or, say, who is all-powerful.

320
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,120
How much advantage you have taken of that

321
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,400
is the important thing.

322
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,560
Now where I stay there are two places you can say,

323
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,440
in England, and in India, mostly,

324
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,600
and the contrast I feel English and Indian thing,

325
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,120
in India the more I have stayed, they become more protocolish

326
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:38,560
because they have old traditional training.

327
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,640
But in England I find, people start taking advantage,

328
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,760
making fun, joking.

329
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,680
You cannot!

330
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:00,440
You see, it is different to please,

331
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,360
but it is different to be frivolous

332
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,160
and shallow with somebody so intense.

333
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,880
For example if there's a tin-board

334
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,640
and you take it under the Niagara fall,

335
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,880
what will happen to the tin-board?

336
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,680
It won't be able to bear even the slightest shower of that.

337
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,520
So despite Rutambhara Pragnya, like the sun today,

338
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,920
You must have been upset yesterday, thinking that,

339
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,040
"Now we have come here, we have to live in the tents,

340
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,840
and the water is raining",

341
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,440
I know many of you must have been.

342
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,160
But the one who has achieved that state would not be:

343
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,840
"What is there? If I've to live doesn't matter.

344
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,240
I'm here for a special purpose.

345
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,440
As long as I achieve that purpose nothing matters to me.

346
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,680
What discomfort, what all these things happen to me,

347
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,600
I have to achieve that purpose."

348
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,480
Some of you people cannot see Me so closely,

349
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,120
some of you are still not capable, doesn't matter.

350
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,120
What is most important is:

351
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:26,120
"I should achieve that state, I have come here for that.

352
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,560
Not for fun, not for food, not for comfort.

353
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,920
Not for anything, but for achieving a special state

354
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,960
where I become the Guru.

355
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,880
What is my preparation for that?"

356
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,600
We have to be extremely careful,

357
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,600
because the attention of the Divine

358
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,040
is not raising you directly.

359
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,600
It is a balance.

360
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,400
You are all the time in a balance, remember that,

361
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,960
and you have to be extremely careful

362
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,360
how far you go with that balance.

363
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,680
So now, how do you develop?

364
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,840
It's all right, don't worry, about the sun,

365
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,120
I like it.

366
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,080
I only called him this morning.

367
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:43,960
So how do you manage this attention?

368
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,320
Now let us see what are the states of attentions are.

369
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,760
Either your attention would be a cunning attention.

370
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,720
Anything you see, you see from a cunning angle.

371
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,680
Many people develop that in an ego-oriented society.

372
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,920
And moreover if you are sort of possessed by cunning bhoots,

373
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,160
then God save you and save others.

374
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,560
Like the cunning attention would be that,

375
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,600
anything you see, you start thinking

376
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,880
"What advantage I can take out of this.

377
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,080
How much money I can save", you see.

378
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,720
It's very, very quick.

379
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,440
"It would be cheaper this way."

380
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,560
"If I go by this way I'll save some time",

381
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,800
you see, "save pounds", "save time",

382
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,720
save everything and save your own Self.

383
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,360
So just to save you are going on.

384
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,920
The attention becomes cunning when you try to save money.

385
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,360
Save here. Save there.

386
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,760
With your own calculations.

387
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,720
But if you try to save the money spontaneously,

388
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,280
actually there is nothing to be tried,

389
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,600
just it happens that you save.

390
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,240
But the cunning attention tries all the time

391
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,600
to be smart about things.

392
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:22,920
It argues, it gives explanations,

393
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,680
"Is it better....?" These days

394
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,640
it's such a cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap thing

395
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,840
that you go mad really.

396
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,400
Like I had a ticket to go to America.

397
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,600
I said, "Don't give Me an expensive ticket, first class, or ....

398
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,520
I'll go by a cheap ticket".

399
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,480
So they gave Me a ticket, of such a kind

400
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,920
that, I would never have come back to London

401
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,320
at least for a year,

402
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,880
and I would have lost in that American English, I tell you,

403
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,400
somewhere.

404
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,640
So it's so much [they ?] had worked out, you know,

405
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,200
this into that, into that.

406
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,960
That kind of a horrible attention is useless.

407
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,320
Leave it, forget it.

408
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,800
With that saving also I've not seen anybody becoming rich.

409
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,160
Like you want, I want to go and buy some paint.

410
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,880
So we buy some paint.

411
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,520
Then they think, "All right, if you bring it back,

412
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,000
then how can we return it,

413
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,400
what should we do, this, that." Nonsense!

414
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,640
All the time the mind is on that level.

415
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,920
I'll give you an example, the other day

416
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,400
we got some paint to paint the glass.

417
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,880
See the subtle part of it,

418
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,520
you see, in the gross there is a subtler indication,

419
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,080
and the paint was brought.

420
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,360
And then, it was worth nothing, eighty p (pence) or something.

421
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,200
All right, I mean I can afford it,

422
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,440
so that's why I bought.

423
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,960
If you can't afford don't buy!

424
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,560
So they said, "Now we should return" I said,

425
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,600
"But why? Now it's come out, now go and return.

426
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,720
You spend so much petrol going there.

427
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,960
If you want to calculate also it's stupid,

428
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,880
and the time you'll be wasting."

429
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,680
"No but Mother, you see, ultimately we save two p!"

430
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,160
I said, "All right,

431
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,400
now I'll save a lot of money, and I'll show you how."

432
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,760
I took that paint and painted many things

433
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,320
which looked like glass, or which was stone-like,

434
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,200
and the whole thing looked so beautiful.

435
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:35,520
So the mind that is destructive is only calculating.

436
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,880
If you have such a mind

437
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,440
know yourself that you have to get rid of

438
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,160
that kind of a calculation.

439
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,480
Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, things

440
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,120
you should just give up. Keep in the centre.

441
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,080
You should not be, of course, over-indulgent.

442
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,920
But you should not be also going for, all the time,

443
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
for this kind of a calculation,

444
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,240
because you are wasting your important awakened attention

445
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,960
which very few people have in this world.

446
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,960
Must know that you are realized souls,

447
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,400
you are not ordinary mundane type of people.

448
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,720
You are special people and you are not to waste

449
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,400
your attention in useless calculating money, 'p',

450
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,080
and this and that.

451
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,760
Let's go ahead. What happens, let's see.

452
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,160
I never calculate you know that, but I live very cheaply,

453
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,840
and you can also do that.

454
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,120
This attention, cunning attention,

455
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,560
is also a very fussy attention.

456
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,200
Here it starts saving money

457
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,960
and then, there it is in the evening it must drink.

458
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,280
So all the saving of p, p, p, p, goes into

459
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,120
the gutters of drinking.

460
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,080
Just sin. The sum total of such a personality is what?

461
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,400
So this mentality has to be controlled.

462
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,520
Specially for ego-oriented people are extremely calculating

463
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,320
most surprising it is.

464
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,440
But the people like Indians who are not calculating

465
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,120
are not so rich.

466
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,800
They are very generous, they always have money for Sahaja Yoga.

467
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,080
I have had never a problem of money with them, never,

468
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,960
because they are not so calculating.

469
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:45,600
To them, to do for others, not for yourself, but for others.

470
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,880
To spend for others.

471
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,440
If they have to come to your house:

472
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,920
"All right, open your heart. Now this is the time to spend."

473
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,520
Not for drinking and self-indulgence,

474
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,080
but for the indulgence of doing for others.

475
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,720
That's their practice and tradition.

476
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,960
So in this respect, you have to take to that tradition:

477
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,680
"Oh they have come. Let's spend now.

478
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,440
What can we do?"

479
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,920
This is the main thing one should understand,

480
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,640
those who are mostly self-indulgent

481
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,240
are extremely miserly people.

482
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,680
So the attention which is cunning,

483
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,600
is the worse attention, because you see,

484
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,000
cunningness also cheats yourself. It is cunning with you,

485
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,360
and you think, "Oh I've been smart enough, you see,

486
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,960
I've saved two p".

487
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,920
But you have lost your soul.

488
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,080
You are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

489
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,200
I'll give you an example.

490
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,680
I told somebody that,

491
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,240
"Keep the van down there, go by train,

492
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,840
this van seems to be a horrible van."

493
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,240
And there was a lot of a, you see, explanation,

494
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,080
with both the fingers going on like this to Me, you see,

495
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,080
and I got so fed up with the bomb shells coming on Me

496
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,360
that I said, to go ahead.

497
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,320
And the thing fell,

498
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,840
and the thing got spoilt or whatever it is,

499
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,840
is out of order now.

500
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
So they had to do what I was telling them.

501
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,480
Without the bomb shell, if they had listened to Me

502
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,200
it would have been all right.

503
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,840
So your attention should not be on saving material things

504
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,160
and worldly things and all that,

505
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,920
but attention itself must be saved.

506
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,080
Ask a question, "Where is my attention?".

507
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,800
I've seen in the programs

508
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,200
some people are concentratedly listening to me,

509
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,280
but some people cannot.

510
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,400
Some are concentrated for a short while,

511
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,680
and some get disinterested after some time.

512
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,840
Some are looking here. Some are looking there.

513
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,560
So how much attention you have saved is the only concern

514
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,120
of a Sahaja Yogi. Forget about others,

515
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,360
they are all garbage cleaners, you see.

516
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,720
Forget about others who are not seeking,

517
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,600
who are not of your quality, but you are a quality.

518
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,400
Now what do you have to save?

519
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,960
For example somebody is a king.

520
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,080
He doesn't bother of two p being saved.

521
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,520
I don't know baba, these days, I can't say definitely!

522
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,720
They must be also doing that kind of a thing, you know, but

523
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,920
what is he bothered to save his grace, to dignity.

524
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,360
But for a Sahaja Yogi the most important thing is,

525
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,640
you must save your attention.

526
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,600
It's called as Chitta Nirodha.

527
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,880
Nirodh -- is saving of your attention.

528
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,200
"Where is it going, It's such a precious thing for me.

529
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,920
Where is it running?"

530
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,360
Then how do you save your attention?

531
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,400
Is through concentration.

532
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,320
Concentrate. Try to concentrate.

533
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,840
Don't allow your attention to wobble.

534
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:37,200
Gradually you will develop concentration.

535
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,040
You can watch My photograph, it's the best.

536
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,960
Concentrate, bring it in your heart,

537
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,440
let it be integrated in your heart.

538
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,040
You are lucky people,

539
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,640
you don't have to build up a photograph,

540
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,200
and then give it up because it is just a Avalambana,

541
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,160
means it's just a dependence,

542
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,600
and then you remove it.

543
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,120
It's a complete dependence for you

544
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,400
and a load for Me -- of complete joy.

545
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,800
So when you are concentrating in Sahaja Yoga,

546
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,920
absolutely fully in Sahaja Yoga,

547
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,560
then you are controlling, saving, your attention.

548
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,040
This is one type of people.

549
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,840
Then the another type of an attention, what we call,

550
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:44,200
are the people who are sort of take a very negative attitude.

551
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,760
The first are the positive, so called,

552
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,600
so called positive,

553
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:57,440
who are saving money, saving everything that is useless.

554
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:05,400
Now the second type are the archbishops of all that is disaster,

555
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,840
misery, mishaps

556
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,120
This type of an attention.

557
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,680
If you read newspaper every morning

558
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,920
you will have an attention like that.

559
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,680
All the newspaper people have that kind of an attention,

560
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,640
to find where is the disaster.

561
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,880
I mean, in a sinister way,

562
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,400
they feel happy there's a disaster.

563
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,960
I've seen people, "Oh Mother, I came to the seminar

564
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,880
but the problem is, you see, there was no water."

565
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,880
The attention is in finding disasters

566
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,800
within and without.

567
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,960
"What happened?", "There's a disaster",

568
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,400
"What happened?" "I lost the pin".

569
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,120
Absurd, to have such stupid ideas.

570
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,840
They will cry and weep and make everyone miserable,

571
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,080
"Oooh, I'm so miserable."

572
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,440
"What?", "My husband doesn't talk to me",

573
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,240
or "My child is not with me."

574
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,560
Such people are extremely self-indulgent

575
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,920
as far as their relationships are concerned.

576
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,880
They make everyone like that,

577
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,280
"Oh, the person didn't talk to me nicely

578
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,120
and he was this way and that way."

579
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,320
They feel hurt at the slightest touch

580
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,800
and by that they think they are saving their emotions

581
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,880
if not the material things.

582
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,560
Such people are very frightened people to talk to anyone,

583
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,640
and anybody says nice things also, they get a fright,

584
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,840
like this, they'll frown.

585
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,360
The reason is they do not know what they have to save,

586
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,040
is not their emotions at all.

587
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,400
There's no need to save your emotions, you are protected.

588
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,520
What does it matter if somebody says anything to you,

589
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,160
you are above there, nobody can touch you!

590
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,760
You are wasting your attention all the time

591
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,920
by trying to save your emotions.

592
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,800
There's nothing to be frightened of anyone,

593
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,440
because somebody is going to say something, harsh word,

594
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,160
that's why you don't want to do something.

595
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,920
Such compromising people, so called,

596
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,920
have not understood Sahaja Yoga.

597
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,400
There is no compromise in Sahaja Yoga at all.

598
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,480
It is just like a diamond.

599
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,360
Diamond will remain a diamond whatever you do,

600
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,960
it's for ever and ever,

601
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,200
it's like that.

602
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,160
So one has to understand that the attention should not be allowed

603
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,080
to drift into this kind of an indulgence

604
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,320
which is of a drunkard,

605
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,880
that, they are the most miserable people, the drunkards are

606
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,840
Just imagine. They'll be always crying, weeping,

607
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,320
and people would think they are very miserable.

608
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,000
So what you have to save at that time is your attention

609
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,880
from such indulgences

610
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,120
into useless expression of your fear

611
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,160
about your emotions.

612
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,480
See now, today they sang the song.

613
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,960
The song did fill Me.

614
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,120
Completely brought out some of the expressions

615
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,480
which would not spontaneously come out at this time.

616
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,560
But the greatest thing it has done is to remind Me

617
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:53,040
that, "You are God. You are not to get frustrated,

618
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,280
You have to look after all of them,

619
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,160
and You are powerful.

620
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:06,440
How dare to suspect yourself or feel frustrated.

621
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,520
That thing which is so much reflecting,

622
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,080
like a mirror, I see My mirror

623
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,880
In the same way you should also

624
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,600
have your emotional understanding

625
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,400
and the emotion should be a mirror,

626
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,480
you should see yourself in your emotions,

627
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,720
how you behave, how you treat, how you talk

628
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,760
So such people should always keep a mirror

629
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,280
and feel elevated.

630
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,760
You are a Sahaja Yogi

631
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,160
and the mirror, in the reflection, you should see Me and not yourself.

632
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,880
Sometimes I've an eye that really frustrated with Sahaja Yogis,

633
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,920
very much. Then I just stand before the mirror

634
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,320
and I say, "Now, come along.

635
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,120
You are the one who has all the powers,

636
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,160
who has all the chakras awakened.

637
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,720
None of the Advents had this.

638
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,120
You are the one who has created this world

639
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,680
and You are the one who has to save it. So now, get up."

640
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,200
Not to lose courage,

641
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,960
not to worry.

642
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,560
Only in the emotional things I sometimes

643
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,720
feel that now I'll have to give up some of them, completely.

644
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,400
They are My children, as a Mother, not as a Guru.

645
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,080
For a Guru they don't have problem.

646
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,120
And then the stirring up comes in, within Myself that,

647
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,800
"No, even if I have to give up, doesn't matter, I have to raise,

648
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,560
absolutely", and with that power it works.

649
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,320
So the reflection should be of Me,

650
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,880
of something that is ideal before you,

651
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,480
the one that gives you energy, like this song

652
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,600
and not the reflection of a miserable person.

653
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,400
Christ who's standing before you

654
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,800
as in the Sistine Chapel and not some miserable skeleton

655
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,800
which is even worse than you.

656
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,720
So create those images of your Mother

657
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,880
which you should see in your emotions and rise.

658
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,120
This is the second type of attention you have to control.

659
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,640
The third one is a very horrid idiotic one.

660
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,440
The idiotic one comes from the second type,

661
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,640
where the person is emotionally indulgent.

662
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,160
That is the "A" of the third.

663
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,640
And the "B" of the third comes from the first type,

664
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,600
which is stupid. So we have two types of people,

665
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,720
one idiotic and another are stupid.

666
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,600
But in Indian language there's only one word,

667
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,200
specially in Marathi -- is murkha.

668
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,120
For them both categories are the same,

669
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,240
as if the circle meets at the same point.

670
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,040
I mean English language in some ways is good

671
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,400
at least it differentiates between the murkhas,

672
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,680
like they can be stupid or they can be idiotic, you see.

673
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,200
Because of psyche being so confused here,

674
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,680
that psychologists have brought out. Some are schizophrenic,

675
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:59,560
some are idiots, some are stupid, some are donkeys.

676
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:08,240
So this, the third type is the worst, is most frustrating for Me.

677
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,360
They'll stick onto Me like leeches,

678
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,760
they'll be saying stupid things all the time.

679
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,800
Just can't bear an idiot, isn't it?

680
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,600
They can bore a person. I mean all sorts of this put together

681
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,160
is called as murkha.

682
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,960
So I don't want to analyze it, it's a bit too much.

683
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,760
So that kind of an attention you have, then you better keep quiet.

684
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,680
Don't talk. Just listen to others what they talk, what they say.

685
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,280
There are some people who will just go on talking, talking, talking,

686
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,000
irrelevantly, uselessly, wasting their energy,

687
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,360
and such people are always friends of the cunning.

688
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,960
The cunning and such people go hand in hand,

689
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,440
because the cunning wants to befool someone,

690
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,960
and the fool wants to be befooled.

691
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,240
Like a king will have a jester,

692
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,200
it's like that you see, these combinations work out.

693
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:08,480
So for such people the best thing is to keep quiet.

694
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,120
Preserve all their attention,

695
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,640
all their energies just for cleansing.

696
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,880
All this idiocity will pass away very soon

697
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,480
if you try to preserve yourself. Don't talk,

698
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,840
don't say things which are stupid,

699
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,440
which are idiotic, just keep quiet, and watch others.

700
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,240
Sometimes such people can become very great vehicle

701
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,880
of God's power,

702
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:47,880
but if they do not take to stupidity and idiocy.

703
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,200
This is the type of people, three types I would say,

704
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,920
but the fourth type are the people who lead a life of concentration.

705
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,440
I mean a person who is working very hard,

706
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,440
say, in the office, is a very remarkably successful person,

707
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,280
and this and that, and that, and that, and that,

708
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,640
is also very concentrated.

709
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,440
Somebody who works very well, anywhere,

710
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,960
with a concentrated mind, is concentrated.

711
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,880
A housewife who looks after her husband and children is very concentrated,

712
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,080
and a husband who looks after his family

713
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,440
and his things in a very concentrated way.

714
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,240
They know how to paint well, they know how to do things,

715
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,160
and their hands are deft, and they know everything.

716
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:42,040
But such people can have a very immobile attention,

717
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,240
very immobile, like plastic,

718
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,640
or you can call it, like rubber.

719
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,520
At the most, to improve on it, we can say,

720
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,240
like some of the things I have seen which you use

721
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,440
for damp-proofing, you see,

722
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:04,080
you just apply it, after some time it's just parched, into it.

723
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,560
They just can't get out of it.

724
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,320
They just can't. They can't enjoy anything.

725
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,680
Unless and until you show them a file you can't talk to them.

726
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,560
You see, if you have to talk to such a person,

727
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,080
better take a file before you,

728
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,880
and before starting you put the file before you.

729
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,880
If it is on the file only, they will see,

730
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,960
but if you talk, they say, "Make a file."

731
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,560
Very parched, and they cannot enjoy life.

732
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,120
There's no mobility, they cannot be creative.

733
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,880
They can be creative only as far as their style is concerned,

734
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:44,120
but not the creative of the joy.

735
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,960
So that kind of concentration is there,

736
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,000
concentrated effort people put in.

737
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,720
Like there are people who are fanatics.

738
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,400
They are very concentrated in their effort, extremely.

739
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,960
That's how all these religions have spread, like Christianity,

740
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,040
Islam, Hinduism and all that,

741
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,240
because they had a concentrated effort of fanaticism

742
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,240
concentrated effort.

743
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,200
If you read the letters of Paul in the Bible,

744
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,280
you will see the concentration of it:

745
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,800
"You go there and you go there and establish a church and do this"

746
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,320
and "What you have done?". Very organized, very systematic,

747
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:25,400
absolutely moving like a belt on a machine.

748
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:31,960
And they all the time have that after effects of that movement.

749
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,960
Charlie Chaplin has shown in his picture "Modern Times".

750
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,760
I used to enjoy that very much,

751
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,040
that he used to tie up a belt, you see, standing

752
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,880
for about an hour, and then

753
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,200
after some time when he was released of the job,

754
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,280
he used to go on like that.

755
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,040
That kind of an attention,

756
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,400
that is concentrated, means stuck onto something.

757
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,800
It's not that, it's not penetrating.

758
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,760
Because if your attention doesn't become, by concentration,

759
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,280
subtler and subtler, then it is not that

760
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,880
but it is getting stuck, and the stuck attention

761
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,400
is of no use for Sahaja Yoga.

762
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,680
Such people, I do not know, will never be saved perhaps.

763
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,440
So called successful.

764
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,280
They'll go with all their badges, everything,

765
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,440
and God will say, "Go back gentlemen,

766
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,680
you are not yet been passed through the customs."

767
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,720
There is another organization,

768
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,640
which works much faster, much smarter way,

769
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,720
and a very specially efficient thing.

770
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:50,040
So these people will be just 'stuck' people.

771
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:59,360
Now there are fourth type of people which are concentrated.

772
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,040
They are intense, deep.

773
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,400
They penetrate

774
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,160
because they are living minds.

775
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,880
Theirs are not dead, parched minds, they have living mind,

776
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,120
they penetrate.

777
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,960
I watch sometimes, I ask some people

778
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,120
what do you think of a particular person?

779
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,720
Immediately I know, what they talk.

780
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,360
If they just talk in a mundane way,

781
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,280
"He is a fine person, he is a bad person, this thing, that thing",

782
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,680
then I know what it is. Very superficial, shallow.

783
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:39,520
But a person who sees the possibilities and the potentialities of

784
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,200
it's awakening, and the problems a person is facing,

785
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,920
then I know that he is the one who has that concentration

786
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,480
into the subject.

787
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,400
And the subject of Sahaja Yoga requires the maximum,

788
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,920
maximum, penetration, because Sahaja Yoga,

789
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,800
if you have understood, I don't know if you have understood

790
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,440
or you are aware of it or not,

791
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,720
but is learned through experience and through nothing else.

792
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,320
You have to experience and then believe into it.

793
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,080
It is not that what I told you is a conditioning on your mind,

794
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,000
nothing, you experience it yourself and learn.

795
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,320
But those who have that penetrating intelligence,

796
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,800
who have that penetrating love, emotions

797
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,400
and those [who] have that penetrating movement

798
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,480
of their understanding,

799
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,960
they are the ones who experience, learn, experience,

800
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,480
learn, experience, learn.

801
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,440
They do not allow their mind to play on them,

802
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,640
"No, no, no.

803
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,960
This mind of mine has got experiences of the past,

804
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,640
and is based on that. No, I have to take everyday

805
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,400
a new experience

806
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,000
and that experience must be silenced within me,

807
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,520
must be sustained within me,

808
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,080
must be conditioned within me."

809
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:14,760
Sahaja Yoga experiences are the good conditionings,

810
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,520
"How can it be? I've seen it,

811
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,200
I have faced it, I've had it. How can it be?".

812
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,040
But for that also, to have the best experiences,

813
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,600
first condition is of Rutambhara Pragnya,

814
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
where you should be of that level

815
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,600
that you really get those experiences,

816
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,120
otherwise you'll be just a mundane type of a person all the time,

817
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,000
and you may live with Me,

818
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,040
but you will not have those experiences,

819
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,040
you'll not have that blissful feeling,

820
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,440
nothing, that joy.

821
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:57,360
So this penetration starts by your meditation

822
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,880
and sustenance of the meditation,

823
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:06,400
and the Samadhi seed sprouting,

824
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,720
manifesting the new dimension within.

825
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,960
This sort of an attention, one has to develop,

826
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,520
by watching the attention, Chitta Nirodha.

827
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,360
As you watch your money,

828
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,240
as you watch your road when you drive,

829
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,960
as you watch your child when it is growing,

830
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,240
as you watch the beauty of your wife,

831
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,760
or the care of your husband.

832
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,240
All put together, you watch yourself, your attention,

833
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,520
where is it going?

834
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,640
Where is it lagging behind?

835
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,640
What is happening to my attention?

836
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,600
Such people have no problems.

837
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,080
You'll be surprised, that such people

838
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,760
when they want to do something it becomes dynamic.

839
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,600
They can work it out. Nobody has any problem,

840
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,400
and if there is a problem,

841
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,960
which you are facing all the time,

842
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,200
in you then know there is something wrong with you.

843
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,520
Something is wrong with the instrument.

844
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,080
If you don't have a tin cutter

845
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,280
and you start using a knife to cut a tin, doesn't work out.

846
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,000
Then you'll say, "The tin is, something wrong with the tin",

847
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,320
or something wrong with you?

848
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,400
No, it's wrong with the instrument

849
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,480
and that instrument has to be corrected.

850
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,640
When the instrument is all right,

851
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,720
after all, with all the powers you have,

852
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,160
with all the blessings you have,

853
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,280
and the source of power behind it,

854
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,520
everything should work out. It should work out.

855
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,680
You have had experiences of things working out.

856
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,280
You have had experiences

857
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,360
of many of miracles happening before your eyes,

858
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:08,720
but still the attention has not settled down

859
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,720
with those experiences. Still 'gatanubhavas'

860
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,720
means the old experiences continue.

861
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,040
Old identifications continue.

862
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,240
You still continue with that

863
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,760
and the filth of that is still on your being.

864
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,640
Change everything.

865
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,640
Become a fresh new person.

866
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,560
You are blooming out as a flower

867
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,200
and then as a tree

868
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,360
and assume your position.

869
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:48,160
Assume your position as the Sahaj yogi.

870
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,480
So this attention must be brought round.

871
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,800
You judge yourself, where is your attention

872
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,640
and what is the point of understanding?

873
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,560
What is the measure of understanding?

874
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,760
It's very simple: I have to be pleased.

875
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,560
Because I'm the attention.

876
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,800
If I am pleased then you have done the job.

877
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,040
But I cannot be pleased by mundane things,

878
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,640
by any arguments with that, but only by your ascent.

879
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,000
So you judge yourself on that.

880
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,640
Whether you give Me a flower,

881
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,920
or anything

882
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:41,920
I'm only pleased when the essence of that doing

883
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:47,200
has that height, has that special manifestation.

884
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,800
You say, "I love you very much Mother."

885
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,280
All right, you say,

886
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,680
but I must see that love that you are saying,

887
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,920
or doing, has that essence that gives Me joy.

888
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:11,320
It's such a mutual thing between us, you can't imagine.

889
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,080
I can't live without you and you can't live without Me.

890
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,240
It's so mutual.

891
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,840
But from one side

892
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,400
it is absolutely hundred per cent benevolent.

893
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,880
Whether I get angry with you, whether I scold you,

894
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,840
whether I pamper you, whether I say, "Don't do that."

895
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,840
If I tell you, "Don't come very close to Me. Keep away",

896
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,880
anything that I do like that, is benevolent

897
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,520
to you.

898
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:46,080
And to Me the benevolence is only one,

899
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:51,080
that you should be emancipated,

900
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,800
that you should gain something out of Me,

901
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,720
that you should prosper out of Me.

902
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,080
Like the Mother Earth feels so elated

903
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,800
to see Her manifestation into these beautiful green trees,

904
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:09,320
it's like that. She's nothing. We stand on Her, we walk on Her.

905
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,600
Where do we see Her? But She sees us, in those.

906
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,960
It's a same sort of a situation.

907
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,200
She is the one who changes all the seasons.

908
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,400
'Rutambhara' means the one, the attention,

909
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,880
which changes the seasons. 'Rutu' means the seasons.

910
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,400
So all the seasons are created by Her

911
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,320
just to please us.

912
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,280
But what do we do, to please Her?

913
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,560
We exhaust Her, torture Her,

914
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,680
take out everything from Her, pollute it,

915
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,480
do all kinds of nonsensical things,

916
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:47,840
and then She gets angry.

917
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,520
The same thing that She is Love.

918
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,800
In the same love She becomes angry,

919
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:58,400
and then you have volcanoes, and you have earthquakes,

920
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,760
and all kinds of things happening to you.

921
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,320
But of course your Mother takes time to get angry.

922
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,080
Takes time. That doesn't mean you take time.

923
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,680
Look after yourselves, it's very important.

924
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,080
Suddenly you will find elevated.

925
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,320
Some people will just elevate themselves

926
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,720
and others will be completely cut out.

927
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,560
So be careful, I'm warning.

928
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:33,160
So today is the day, previous day to this fifteenth day.

929
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:39,800
And the fourteenth day, one has to become a killer.

930
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,160
Killer of all that is ignorance,

931
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,440
of all that is stupid, idiotic,

932
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:52,640
all that is cunning and all that is emotional.

933
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,800
Kill that part, become a Sahaja Yogi,

934
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,680
tomorrow, to receive the blessings.

935
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,320
May God Bless you.
