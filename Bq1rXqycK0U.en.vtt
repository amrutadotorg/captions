00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:09.517
Of course, one should not get attached to anything.

00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:14.739
Whatever is created, is created. 
One should never be attached.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:20.489
Because we have done this, so we should be 
attached to it, is not the way: aSahaja

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:22.252
Yogi should think about it.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.656
But one should think about that,
now we have created something beautiful

00:00:25.743 --> 00:00:27.634
we can recreate another thing

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.658
and we can produce other better things.

00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:34.992
That’s how an artist
can go on producing and producing.

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:39.650
Of course, there’s one thing: 
that if there is

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:42.621
within us the joy,

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:48.781
then only you produce joy.

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:51.188
If there is no joy you cannot.

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:54.394
So first of all

00:00:54.475 --> 00:00:56.825
before doing any work

00:00:57.046 --> 00:00:58.706
creating anything

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:06.513
one must measure up 
the amount of joy one has received,

00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:09.871
the blessings one has received from the Divine,

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:11.994
and then recreate.

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:15.539
With that consciousness, with that awareness

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.114
you’ll find your creation will be very beautiful.

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:24.186
And we have to bring the world to 
a new method of creativity

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.955
where there is exuberance,
exuberance,

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:34.733
of joy and

00:01:34.814 --> 00:01:39.639
of Divine aesthetics,

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:42.847
because the world is going from bad to worse.

00:01:42.928 --> 00:01:46.274
I find nowadays people may just like to have

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:50.562
some sort of a white cloth hanging and calling it a painting.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:53.418
That’s not a painting because there is nothing inside.

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:56.154
It has become hollow, empty; there’s nothing inside,

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:58.031
so that there is no exuberance.

00:01:58.112 --> 00:02:02.810
So, to recreate that,
you people have to

00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:05.385
desire and ask for it,

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.486
and we’ll have people of that kind.

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.352
It is just to be desired,

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.878
and you all should desire for such things:

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.274
that people of exuberance should come forward

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:19.055
to value such things which are full of joy.

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.075
May God bless you.
