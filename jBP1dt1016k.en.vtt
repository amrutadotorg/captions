00:08.709 --> 00:12.667
Shri Mataji: The Question is like this, I am asking Mr. Chavan,

00:12.792 --> 00:14.500
he said you must forgive everyone.

00:14.584 --> 00:17.999
Now supposing somebody abuses your Mataji,

00:17.999 --> 00:22.125
says horrible things about her and see sort of infuriates you,

00:22.250 --> 00:25.083
then what to do? How to overcome that?

00:25.167 --> 00:31.334
Sahaja yogi: Now, I’ll just try to again translate in the reply

00:33.334 --> 00:46.167
that I gave was that, I feel that suppose a situation comes across

00:46.292 --> 00:49.626
where a certain person is abusing mother.

00:49.709 --> 00:52.209
So, what is our first reaction?

00:52.292 --> 00:58.876
If you are stable, I feel you should be immediately able to make out

00:59.709 --> 01:05.167
as to whether that person is a knowledgeable person, where he is realized,

01:05.999 --> 01:09.083
because a realized soul will never be able to abuse mother,

01:09.209 --> 01:12.459
never be able to talk anything against mother.

01:12.542 --> 01:19.999
That is just impossible, its only because he is in avidya

01:19.999 --> 01:24.709
he doesn’t have the knowledge that he is abusing the mother.

01:24.792 --> 01:28.792
When he comes to reality, he will not do so.

01:29.584 --> 01:36.083
Now, I told that our elder brother Shri Jesus Christ,

01:36.167 --> 01:40.999
has shown us the way in this regard.

01:41.417 --> 01:45.918
He has said that whenever you come across any such person who abuses God,

01:45.999 --> 01:49.999
then you have to tell, you have to pray God that

01:50.000 --> 01:56.751
please, please we have to say please Mother, you forgive him.

01:56.834 --> 02:00.459
When mother forgives everything comes in it.

02:00.626 --> 02:04.876
I feel it is not necessary to give him punishment. I am nobody to punish him.

02:04.959 --> 02:08.834
It is the forgiveness of the Mother itself will act as punishment

02:08.959 --> 02:10.999
and reward for that person.

02:10.999 --> 02:14.375
Because as soon as she forgives, the person will get realized

02:14.500 --> 02:18.292
and he will get everything.
There is no other good punishment.

02:18.417 --> 02:19.500
Thank you!

02:26.000 --> 02:28.999
Shri Mataji: It’s very well said.

02:29.083 --> 02:32.167
But it’s a very subtle point you see

02:32.250 --> 02:36.792
because God has given us also temper and anger as well as forgiveness.

02:36.918 --> 02:38.918
Both qualities are within us.

02:38.999 --> 02:42.792
And he has not given us temper for something that is useless,

02:42.876 --> 02:45.834
as even temper is necessary.

02:45.999 --> 02:50.334
Once you are realized, once you are a realized soul,

02:50.417 --> 02:53.459
your temper is also dynamic, it is needed.

02:53.584 --> 02:58.292
When somebody says something against God and against your mother,

02:58.375 --> 03:01.999
if he is a realized soul or if he is not a realized soul

03:01.999 --> 03:04.167
is a very important point, no doubt.

03:04.292 --> 03:09.125
Supposing he is not a realized soul

03:09.209 --> 03:12.751
then the best thing is to pity such a man and say that O God forgive,

03:12.876 --> 03:15.500
because they do not know what they are doing.

03:15.626 --> 03:17.083
But say even Christ,

03:17.167 --> 03:20.417
supposing something had happened to the mother of Christ,

03:20.500 --> 03:23.375
now how he would have reacted?

03:25.334 --> 03:28.292
Then he would have come up as her son

03:28.375 --> 03:33.334
and he would have taken the cross in his hands and hit all the people there.

03:34.083 --> 03:39.209
So, when somebody abuses who is a realized soul,

03:39.334 --> 03:44.292
there are many realized souls, whom I have given realization,

03:44.375 --> 03:49.375
who have come up very well but who fall out,

03:49.542 --> 03:53.042
who try to abuse and try to say bad things,

03:53.167 --> 03:56.667
now at that time it’s the whole collectivity is challenged,

03:56.751 --> 03:59.125
the whole collectivity, the whole collective being is challenged

03:59.209 --> 04:00.792
when he says something like that.

04:00.876 --> 04:04.918
He is a part and parcel of your being.

04:04.999 --> 04:09.959
Think if in your finger you have some pain, what do you do? You rub it off.

04:11.959 --> 04:17.417
When a person who is a realized soul, if he tries to be funny

04:17.500 --> 04:23.292
or if he tries to abuse anything that is divine,

04:23.417 --> 04:27.999
you have to get into a temper, that’s a part,

04:27.999 --> 04:32.667
but this temper is to be diverted into Sahaja Yoga system

04:33.292 --> 04:41.167
like you beat him with shoes, you write his names and burn it,

04:42.250 --> 04:47.999
you write his names on the ground and stamp it,

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
you take out your anger on them.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.959
Your anger is divine anger, it has a meaning.

04:52.999 --> 04:56.918
You are part of the whole divine. If you are angry the divine is angry.

04:56.999 --> 05:01.375
But this anger is hithkaari, is the one that is benevolent,

05:01.500 --> 05:03.292
is a benevolent anger.

05:03.417 --> 05:05.125
This benevolent anger is necessary

05:05.250 --> 05:08.959
because he is the part and parcel of the whole

05:10.125 --> 05:12.584
and you go all out.

05:12.834 --> 05:17.417
There are so many ways by which you really punish in a symbolic way.

05:17.542 --> 05:23.626
But that punishment brings him out of his negativity.

05:23.751 --> 05:29.876
But for people who are not realized also, these things come up.

05:29.999 --> 05:33.999
When negativity is very powerful and wants to take a challenge

05:33.999 --> 05:38.876
with the positivity, supposing there’s a negative person

05:40.876 --> 05:44.999
and he wants to disturb say our work,

05:45.417 --> 05:46.999
at that time you will be amazed

05:47.042 --> 05:49.792
that those who will be negative will start supporting the person.

05:49.918 --> 05:53.792
Immediately, you can pick them out and say that these are negative.

05:53.876 --> 05:56.999
And those who are positive will be in anger,

05:57.042 --> 05:59.500
they’ll keep quiet, some of them will be boiling

05:59.584 --> 06:03.292
and some of them might get up and say you get out from here.

06:05.500 --> 06:10.959
That we have to do, that challenge we have to take up and say to people,

06:11.999 --> 06:17.999
that is only possible when you have full discretion, how to use your anger?

06:18.042 --> 06:19.999
You have to say it out.

06:20.042 --> 06:26.500
It is necessary because if you allow these negativities to be there,

06:27.626 --> 06:32.999
they will get hold of people who are
sitting on the fences who are half baked,

06:33.542 --> 06:37.792
at that time it is necessary to show your strength,

06:37.918 --> 06:41.417
not to get lost in your temper, but to stand up to say

06:41.500 --> 06:44.834
you get out from here, don’t know what you are doing,

06:44.918 --> 06:50.999
that is very important, because whatever you see, say is a mantra,

06:50.999 --> 06:55.292
is a dynamite that will change the whole atmosphere.

06:55.375 --> 06:58.375
The negativity will run away, but if you say that,

06:58.459 --> 07:03.584
alright let it happen, it will have a bad effect.

07:05.042 --> 07:14.250
Christ allowed them to torture him, but not his mother nor God.

07:14.334 --> 07:18.792
He took a hunter in his hand when people were selling in the market.

07:19.125 --> 07:24.500
So, he has a double side also and in you also there is Kalki.

07:24.584 --> 07:27.292
And you, I have awakened Kalki in you.

07:27.375 --> 07:32.292
So, you are also Kalki but you must reach a certain maturity,

07:32.375 --> 07:35.334
then only you can do it. Sometimes it is very important,

07:35.417 --> 07:39.876
but the way you do it, with what dignity you do it is very important.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.999
But one has to learn that also,

07:41.999 --> 07:45.999
you have to learn how to say it with sternness and with strength

07:46.000 --> 07:48.999
that you shut up now. You are not to say a word,

07:49.000 --> 07:53.959
and only saying this will make all the negativities run away.

07:53.999 --> 07:56.042
At a point one has to say,

07:56.125 --> 08:01.584
that’s what I feel that when you grow in this atmosphere here,

08:01.667 --> 08:10.167
let you find yourself which is also very very strong as well as forgiving.

08:10.292 --> 08:13.667
You know that your mother’s nature is Atisoumya, Atiroudrya;

08:13.792 --> 08:18.709
she lives in two extremes. She can be extremely gentle,

08:18.834 --> 08:20.792
and she can be terrific.

08:20.918 --> 08:24.000
And these two qualities you should also imbibe,

08:24.083 --> 08:27.500
but it should never be directed against your own brothers and sisters,

08:27.584 --> 08:29.209
you don’t direct all destructive forces.

08:29.334 --> 08:34.125
But against the negativity, because the time has come for us to fight.

08:34.250 --> 08:38.209
The time has started now for us to fight these negative forces

08:38.334 --> 08:43.000
and for that we all must take up strength within,

08:43.083 --> 08:46.167
you see compromising with them all that is not going to help us.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.999
So, the strength must be there,

08:47.999 --> 08:51.999
a dignity and with all understanding and discretion you have to tell.

08:51.999 --> 08:57.834
But I have seen mostly negative people
will stand up and say you shut up, you go away.

08:57.959 --> 09:01.334
So, the positivity should reach that stage where you are matured

09:01.417 --> 09:05.999
and when you just say stand up and shut up, it means something.

09:06.626 --> 09:09.751
That’s a part one has to play, one has to accept

09:09.834 --> 09:13.876
we are not going to run away from our parts and some time,

09:13.999 --> 09:18.125
as I said, you have to take swords in your hand.

09:18.959 --> 09:26.500
So, this is a very courageous role full of valor.

09:26.999 --> 09:31.042
It does not mean that we are cowards, or we are weak people.

09:31.167 --> 09:36.626
We are very strong, extremely powerful people and you have tremendous power.

09:36.709 --> 09:41.417
But you have the greatest power is that of forgiveness,

09:41.500 --> 09:44.167
but behind that forgiveness, there is no weakness.

09:44.250 --> 09:49.167
What is the forgiveness of a weak person, he has to forgive in any case?

09:49.250 --> 09:54.042
But the strength of a Sahaja yogi can forgive.

09:54.918 --> 09:59.125
So, if somebody says something against the divinity itself,

09:59.209 --> 10:02.417
you have to stand up in a way, in a dignified way.

10:02.500 --> 10:06.417
And use your discretion and if necessary, you have to tell them

10:06.500 --> 10:10.709
that you are in for trouble. This much I can say.

10:10.792 --> 10:14.125
Because this is also an important part where step by step

10:14.250 --> 10:17.999
as you are growing you will be amazed that as you are flowers,

10:17.999 --> 10:24.667
you are also the thorns that have to protect the flower within.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.999
We have both roles and we are not to avoid anything

10:28.999 --> 10:33.999
that is within us, that is our part but the only thing is the channelizing,

10:34.083 --> 10:38.334
this is very important and this subtle point we must understand.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.792
Mr. Chavan is a very very competent man

10:40.876 --> 10:45.459
and he knows how to handle situations and things but

10:46.751 --> 10:49.999
him also and to everyone, I am telling, if you find anybody

10:49.999 --> 10:53.417
any sahaja yogi who is deviating from the path of Sahaja yoga,

10:53.542 --> 10:56.584
you have to tell him, straight on the face

10:56.667 --> 10:58.999
that this is wrong.

10:59.167 --> 11:00.542
This you should not do,

11:00.667 --> 11:04.667
and you should support a man who says that,
is important.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.709
Because all of us must join hands together to find out

11:07.792 --> 11:10.959
the weaknesses that we have and how to get rid of them,

11:10.999 --> 11:12.751
is very important.

11:12.834 --> 11:15.999
Because unless and until we take a strong attitude towards ourselves

11:15.999 --> 11:19.626
and towards our whole collectivity, you don’t know

11:19.751 --> 11:23.876
there is such a tremendous force collected against divinity

11:23.959 --> 11:28.667
that we may give in. So, let us build up ourselves also

11:28.792 --> 11:32.876
with courage and with the full idea of our powers of divinity

11:32.959 --> 11:34.834
that we have within ourselves.

11:34.918 --> 11:37.999
May God bless you, it’s a very good point that came up, I am very happy.

11:37.999 --> 11:41.999
Mr. Chavan is a very good leader, a nice man and compromising

11:41.999 --> 11:43.918
and a very powerful person.

11:43.999 --> 11:48.459
He comes from a community which is known for its valor

11:48.584 --> 11:54.584
and so he is so strong because, he has built up himself like that

11:54.667 --> 11:57.584
and such a person will have patience and everything he can have,

11:57.709 --> 12:00.500
but to a point, to a point.

12:00.584 --> 12:05.500
Then you have to come out and tell off people,

12:06.709 --> 12:07.834
Thank you!
