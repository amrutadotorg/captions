1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:02,230
I talk to you about the right side.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:17,150
Right side sympathetic nervous system which 
is expressed by other subtle energy of Mahasaraswati

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:37,400
which gives us the power to act - by left 
side we desire and by using the right side,

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,720
the power of pingala nadi, we act.

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,840
I was telling you about the right side the 
other day.

6
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,300
Let us see how our right side is built up.

7
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,590
I’m sorry for people who have come for the 
first time but every time when I start the

8
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,580
introduction to the subject, again it becomes 
the same but later on I’ll explain to you

9
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,080
about Sahaja.

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:26,659
Now this right side pingala nadi is a very, 
very important energy-giving energy

11
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:30,150
which makes us act and activate.

12
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:38,210
Now this one is made of all the five elements.

13
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:46,070
You know all the five elements that have created 
our physical being and our mental being.

14
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:57,060
That’s how it helps us to work out all our 
physical and mental problems, mental activities

15
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,070
and mental and physical growth.

16
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:14,680
Now this being made by those five elements, 
when first time human beings started thinking

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:27,859
of doing some action about anything, say in 
India, they first thought why not somehow

18
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:37,760
or other reach to the principle of these elements, 
which is beyond physics, which is beyond chemistry.

19
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:51,931
And to reach to that point, they thought it 
would be better if we try to invoke or to

20
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:59,319
awaken the Deities which are governing those 
five elements.

21
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,180
This was a very big mistake though, I should 
say.

22
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:11,839
Because human beings, whatever they take up, 
they do not know where to stop.

23
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:20,569
If you tell them that you have to clean your 
teeth everyday, then they’ll go on cleaning

24
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,879
it 12 times in 12 hours.

25
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:31,939
You tell them anything, they’ll go so far 
that they will destroy the instrument which

26
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,729
is suppose to be looked after.

27
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:39,720
That’s the nature of human beings, they 
cannot have brakes to themselves.

28
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,720
They do not have common sense as far as balance 
in their life.

29
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:59,290
So anything you give them, they become so 
mad after it that in Marathi there is a word

30
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,369
is that they ultimately put ashes on their 
head, to say to declare that I am dead now,

31
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,390
I’ve become ashes.

32
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:14,680
Like that, they get so frantic that even while 
doing this awakening of these principles,

33
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,319
they forgot, lost their sight that we are 
after all spirit and not these elements.

34
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,180
We are beyond that.

35
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,090
You have to reach beyond that.

36
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:34,419
All these elements are only useful for us 
to achieve a state in which we can create

37
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:46,330
things and we can have more time to devote 
to meditation to enjoy our self-realisation.

38
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:57,270
They got completely blinded by the advances 
they made on this side which is in pure and

39
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,849
simple words is materialism.

40
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:06,229
They became so responsible, so efficient.

41
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:15,490
First in the Vedas, it’s written, the first 
stanza is such that by reading these Vedas,

42
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:22,849
if you do not know your spirit then it is 
absolutely useless.

43
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:26,680
But this stanza they always close down I think.

44
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,650
Then they started worshipping those Deities, 
this, that, exciting them, doing all ritualism,

45
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,290
and all that and they just went into it headlong, 
absolutely headlong.

46
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,510
They would not turn back.

47
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:47,949
So by exciting these elements, they discovered 
the principles of these elements.

48
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:53,890
For example, they discovered that gravity 
is the essence of the Mother Earth.

49
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,469
But it is not.

50
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:59,830
That is not the essence of the Mother Earth.

51
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:06,990
That is the energy that is asserted by Her 
but Her essence is Her fragrance.

52
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:15,659
They could not cross that limit where they 
could see really the subtle thing which was

53
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:19,930
the subtle principle of this energy of gravity 
is the fragrance.

54
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:28,419
All the fragrances come from Her.

55
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,830
Of course man made there are, that’s different.

56
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,199
But even the man made, are also coming from 
Her, if you go trace the source, it’s up

57
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,949
to the point, it is from there.

58
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:48,310
Like that they went on discovering the subtler, 
so called subtler energies or the principles

59
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,300
of these elements from the Vedas style.

60
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,900
Then it became a science.

61
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:02,139
People started studying physics, chemistry, 
this, that, understanding what was there before

62
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:07,610
them, by going into it and trying to find 
out what is it made of.

63
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:16,749
For example, they went into atoms, they went 
into say molecules and things and they tried

64
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:26,810
to find out and there they find the oscillation 
of the protons and they find the oscillation

65
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,210
of these atoms.

66
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:35,610
And they just can’t understand, from where 
does this energy of this oscillation is coming.

67
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:43,509
They could not capture that energy so they 
thought better use the energy, so they started

68
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:45,729
using the energy.

69
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:51,120
Now it has gone to such a limit of the whole 
thing is, now I read, saw that microchips

70
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,689
or something coming up.

71
00:07:52,689 --> 00:08:00,129
After some time you won’t be using hands 
or head or anything, it will be that microchips

72
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:01,330
will be going on.

73
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,930
But with this kind of a thing, with this extreme 
behaviour, you’ll become a machine yourself.

74
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,340
A slave of the machine.

75
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,629
Today the petrol is exhausted, tomorrow electricity 
is exhausted, then what are you going to do?

76
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,080
You don’t know even to count two plus two.

77
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,770
So you are left without any counting, you’ll 
become the same primitive man and I don’t

78
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:29,590
know what you will be doing, climbing on the 
trees and living like monkeys, I don’t know

79
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,249
what will happen.

80
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:36,409
So all these advancement that you did has 
gone too far.

81
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:43,529
But as a result of too much efficiency, too 
much responsibility and all that, you became

82
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,860
sort of addicted to it and then with that 
you started dominating other people.

83
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,541
The machinery came in, that you produced such 
a lot of machinery style that you didn’t

84
00:08:55,541 --> 00:09:00,570
know what to do so you had to find out markets 
where you sell them so you started capturing

85
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,970
other markets where you started selling them 
and that’s how all these economic problems

86
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,350
and all this have started.

87
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,540
There are developing countries, there are 
developed countries, all things going on in

88
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,060
this mad world.

89
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:19,620
But we reach a point now where we realise 
that this machine has done something nonsensical

90
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
within us.

91
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,910
When we reach that point, we start thinking 
now what are we to do.

92
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:33,769
We have been very responsible, not you people 
but your forefathers may be, who went to fight

93
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:39,860
the whole world and do this and they had to 
be at right time at right places and do all

94
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,209
sorts of things.

95
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:47,580
By that over-responsibility you became sort 
of fed up, you just didn’t know what to

96
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,580
do.

97
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,770
For example, morning you wear a grey suit, 
in the night you have to wear a tail coat

98
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:57,100
and then if you have to drink your wine, you 
have to take a separate glass and for that

99
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
this.

100
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,290
It became too much messy you said “Throw 
them in the sea”.

101
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:10,709
We have collected all this nonsense, we have 
collected all these forms and horrible things

102
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,750
that have made us so rigid.

103
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,899
That’s how you try to throw away everything 
but even then when you throw away, where do

104
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:17,899
you go?

105
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,750
I mean you have to exist, you cannot just 
hang in the air.

106
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,890
So you said now take another style.

107
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,260
And another style is even worse, much worse.

108
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:35,590
Because then no responsibility, no respect, 
no understanding, so this power goes absolutely

109
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,590
zero.

110
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,899
You are tired very soon.

111
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,880
I’ve seen, I mean in the BBC and all that, 
young people, I’m a very old woman compared

112
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,730
to them, after saying two three words, they 
say “Ahhh”, they go down.

113
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,209
Again after saying something, “Ahhh”.

114
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,279
This is very big acting these days.

115
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,630
In any play you see a person saying, “Ahhh”.

116
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:04,170
What does it take to act for this kind of 
a thing.

117
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,540
This is what is very common.

118
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,209
Now you notice, the reason is you are tired.

119
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,380
You’re absolutely tired, why?

120
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:23,320
Because your brain is the same old brain and 
you have taken a new life, you cannot adjust

121
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,730
yourself to that.

122
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,290
You say that now I am sitting down, doing 
nothing, I am not going to be efficient anymore

123
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,880
and all that, I’m sitting down, the brain 
is going, chug-chug-chug-chug-chug, morning

124
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
till evening.

125
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,120
How to stop this brain?

126
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,370
This brain is working so hard, using up all 
your energy, you have no strength.

127
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:48,139
So to counteract you will say let’s take 
to some sort of a thing by which we go out

128
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,389
of this madness.

129
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:56,269
Let’s take to something that takes you as 
we call it the right or the left side, take

130
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:03,630
something like say hashish, or something like 
another thing, LSD, to go to the right or

131
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,690
to the left.

132
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,910
Now what happens with that you know very well.

133
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,070
Now thank God you have realised also to that 
was nonsensical action, that was wrong.

134
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,160
These are two areas within us which are called 
as Adi Bhautik and Adi Devik.

135
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:28,790
Now the Adi Bhautik are the ones which take 
you to the left side is the subconscious and

136
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,680
the Adi Devik are the ones where you try to 
invoke the devas and all that on the right

137
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:42,269
hand side, that one is the Adi Devik where 
we call it supra-conscious area.

138
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:47,230
These two are of no use to human beings, actually.

139
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,750
They are not meant for human beings.

140
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:57,050
They are meant for people who are dead, who 
are dead souls, who are good for nothing.

141
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,720
Now they cannot get realisation.

142
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,910
It’s not meant for you.

143
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,209
That’s the area you should not reside.

144
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:08,110
But you enter into these areas because of 
extreme natures.

145
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:14,100
Some people by going into these drugs, some 
taking to some sort of movements like mesmerisms,

146
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,740
spiritualisms and all sorts of isms.

147
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:24,990
Some people onto the right hand side like 
taking to what you call these people who are

148
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,090
racialists and all such organisations which 
are racialist and this and that and you know

149
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,000
all that kind of a people, like Hitlerish 
type.

150
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,410
All this is nothing but is a kind of intoxicant 
which makes you forget the reality, that you

151
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:46,339
are a human being, that you have to become 
the spirit, that you are the spirit is the

152
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:47,339
reality.

153
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:55,990
Now the present trend in the Western life 
is very much set in this country about which

154
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,700
I am very much concerned.

155
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:04,250
I’ve talked about to many people in person 
and also the vibes (?), that the quality of

156
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,870
the mind, because we are with the English, 
let’s talk about the English.

157
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,610
Quality of mind of English is excellent, I’ve 
said it always.

158
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,470
And the young people of English have a very 
good quality of mind.

159
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,709
But their heart is lacking.

160
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:25,259
They’re frightened of what God alone knows 
but they are frightened.

161
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,800
Why they have taken this course, I don’t 
know.

162
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,450
Now to do any work, also they’re frightened.

163
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:36,269
Supposing we put this colour, then it may 
not match, it doesn’t matter, doesn’t

164
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:37,269
matter.

165
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:38,329
What does it matter?

166
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:43,620
Because of those previous ideas they are so 
frightened of doing anything, though they

167
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:51,660
say they have broken all those ideas and they 
have taken to new liberated ways and all that.

168
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,110
But this liberation is also another madness 
in which they’re fear has now gone.

169
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:05,819
So the quality of mind of we the English sahaja 
yogis and English people is excellent.

170
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:11,220
If you talk to them, you’ll think you are 
talking to a scholar, I mean no less than

171
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,220
Shakespeare.

172
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,000
They could be very well read, they will know 
about anything you ask them, what is this

173
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
road?

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is the road!

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,160
Now, what is the name of this road?

176
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
This is the gentleman.

177
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Who was his grandfather, what he did, what 
was the gossip about him, scandals, everything.

178
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,910
You can get everything from them, they know 
everything about everything.

179
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:37,529
Sometimes I’m amazed the way people know 
about things.

180
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:41,730
About all the details as to how many women 
he had, and how many wives he divorced and

181
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,279
what he did and where he went and what he 
wrote.

182
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:51,100
Take anyone, take a writer, or take an artist, 
or take a hooligan, or take a robber or anyone

183
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,160
who has appeared on the newspaper as if they 
have drunk all the newspaper into their memory.

184
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,040
The whole thing is so clear cut in their mind 
that is sometimes, I mean.

185
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:13,970
But if you tell them to fix one chair, never 
trust that chair (everyone laughing).

186
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,970
Never trust it.

187
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,829
If you ask them to do anything, they’ll 
tell you: ‘Alright, tomorrow at 7 sharp,

188
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,319
I’ll be there.’

189
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:27,279
Even if he comes after 7 days, thank your 
stars.

190
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,569
I’ve known people who have been done this 
to me.

191
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:35,899
Now it’s 4 years, I’ve never seen their 
faces again.

192
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:43,510
They’re supposed to be XYZ from Oxford and 
ABCD from Cambridge.

193
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,500
They have got first class first and this and 
that.

194
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,430
If you go into their rooms, you will find 
it’s a pig sty.

195
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,690
You don’t know where you have landed.

196
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,589
I mean, you don’t believe that it belongs 
to any educated person, there’s no sense

197
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:57,879
of responsibility left in their head.

198
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:05,210
I mean this energy that is working in the 
head, if it is not put into a responsible

199
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,970
channel, no wonder, we find every third person 
is a paranoid, something wrong with the brain.

200
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:17,320
What is wrong with the brain is that so much 
energy is here and you are not channelizing

201
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,530
it at all.

202
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,300
By what ways are we to channelize it.

203
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:29,580
Even after realisation, I find people have 
no respect for anything.

204
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,850
Sometimes it’s most surprising that with 
all this brain activity going on, they get

205
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,440
all the satisfaction from the spirit.

206
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:43,840
They’re raising the Kundalini and all that 
but they have lost that capacity to be responsible

207
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,250
and that’s why in Sahaja Yoga also they 
are not responsible.

208
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,830
This goes on not only about their own private 
work but about Sahaja Yoga about everything.

209
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,170
So this quality of mind has no heart.

210
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,830
It has no, it has heart in nothing.

211
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:06,610
Supposing I am telling you something, I don’t 
know about sahaja yogis as such, but now…

212
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:13,020
I’ve seen with people, you give them a lecture 
for one year, one hour, it’s lost, finished.

213
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,370
They’re just the same, what has happened.

214
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,280
It’s only the vibrations, it’s only how 
you work it out that the life changes and

215
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
all that.

216
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,640
But as far as they are concerned, nothing 
is recorded in the memory.

217
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,710
Sometimes I feel how do I talk?

218
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,720
Is it too much on their heads or below their 
feet?

219
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,770
Where is it flowing?

220
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,380
So the reason is that the heart is lost.

221
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,920
If you register it through your heart, you 
will do it.

222
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,320
If you put your heart into things you will 
do it.

223
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,710
The heart is as I told you is chicken-hearted, 
is absolutely chicken-hearted.

224
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,870
And that’s why, this is what is lacking 
in our character.

225
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:04,040
For that now the stage has reached, we have 
to raise our right side, not the left side.

226
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:13,350
Our right side is absolutely finished and 
there the leader of the right side are two

227
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,350
persons.

228
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,350
The Deities are two persons.

229
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,541
Of course Brahmadeva is the one who is the 
creator, who has created this universe and

230
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:25,200
who is the one who is busy still creating 
and doing lots of things for you people.

231
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:34,680
But I would suggest that we have to pay attention 
to two ideals we have in the history.

232
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,380
For this to understand what sort of ideals 
we should have, because the right side is

233
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,800
a Rajo Guna is the one by which you become 
majestic, you become royal, you achieve all

234
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,320
the Rajo Guna as you know that.

235
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,430
Now two persons are really to be followed 
on there.

236
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,130
One of them is Shri Ram.

237
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:03,100
Shri Ram resides on the right heart and is 
the father.

238
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,400
He is the father and He is the fatherhood.

239
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,510
He is the one who came on this earth to teach 
us how to be a father as a king.

240
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,670
He is a father king.

241
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:21,390
He is a benevolent king, which was described 
before [??] He is the benevolent.

242
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:29,690
He was the ideal that came on this earth to 
teach us how to be responsible to others,

243
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:36,240
how to respect others, how to understand the 
feelings of others.

244
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:48,790
To such an extent He went that He had to sacrifice 
His own wife for the sake of His own state.

245
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:57,250
He did that and He had to ask His wife who 
was pregnant to go and live with a very great

246
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,250
sage.

247
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,500
One may say that what was He doing about His 
wife.

248
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,960
She was the Goddess.

249
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,840
She was so remarkable that He was not bothered 
about Her.

250
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,660
He was so sure of Her powers that He did it 
and there is nothing wrong in leaving things

251
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,490
to the Goddess to do instead of meddling with 
Her all the time.

252
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:30,810
But this gentleman Shri Rama, understood the 
responsibility of a king and that responsibility

253
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,740
is lacking in us.

254
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,820
That responsibility towards ourselves and 
towards others.

255
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,380
It is very, very surprising.

256
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,850
I mean I came from India.

257
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:48,570
I’d never met Englishmen at this close quarters 
till I came to England I should say.

258
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,780
Because before that we met all missionaries.

259
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,360
All missionaries were terribly responsible 
for converting all the people into Christianity.

260
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,770
They will get up early in the morning, take 
their Bible, go around to all the places,

261
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:06,110
cleaning all the dirty lanes and cleaning 
all the children like bits of paper see, cleaning

262
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,910
all the dirty people there, kiss them and 
do all impressive things to convert the people.

263
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,560
They would go even to the forest to convert.

264
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,530
They were so responsible about it that they 
felt they have to do it, this is God’s job,

265
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:28,590
they’re doing God’s job, they must convert, 
and they went on with this and that’s how

266
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,430
some of the people I met.

267
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,620
Then the rulers, the rulers are extremely 
responsible.

268
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,540
They were ruthless and they thought this was 
the greatest thing they are doing to spread

269
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,120
British Raj and that was their responsibility.

270
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,190
When it comes to spreading God’s Raj you 
are not.

271
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,170
First of all in our own life, we should see 
are we responsible.

272
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:52,890
Now in the modern times I find that we have 
got rid of that sense of responsibility, it’s

273
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,860
called as a sense of diminishing responsibility.

274
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:03,720
You’ll just say yes, yes, I know, I should 
have, I know, I know.

275
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,030
I can’t understand.

276
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,700
If you have a heart, how can you say that, 
that I know I should not have done.

277
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
I know, I should have been doing.

278
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,040
The reason is there is no heart and the heart 
always catches when your right side over acts.

279
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,510
That means your brain is active too much and 
there is no real action the outward of it.

280
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:27,320
You think too much and do not put it to practice.

281
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,780
I should have gone, I should have done this, 
I should have said so, and this is the problem

282
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,390
with our right side.

283
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:42,270
Now, among our sahaja yogis also, I find people 
have the problem of the right side.

284
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:50,630
To worship the right side, we have to see 
to Shri Ram.

285
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,860
How He felt responsible for the whole world.

286
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,680
How He use to look after people.

287
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,560
How He looked after the things of other people.

288
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,420
How He behaved towards other people, that’s 
a very important thing which we have to learn.

289
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,360
But I find people coming, if it is somebody 
else’s, they’ll throw.

290
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,670
They will just jump into something and say 
that alright, this is my house I just settle

291
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,410
down here, the way I like.

292
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,580
There’s no sense of responsibility at all 
about it, that you have come to somebody else’s

293
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,580
house.

294
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,230
You have to have some care about it.

295
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:26,520
In the same way you have to know you have 
come in the world of God.

296
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,450
This is the Kingdom of God where you have 
entered.

297
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,780
You have been a stranger.

298
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:35,080
Today you are a guest in His house, what are 
you doing about it.

299
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,140
How are you behaving?

300
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,970
Are you responsible?

301
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,750
Are you like Shri Rama who took it up Himself, 
all the problems of the world and still He

302
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,800
was so responsible.

303
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,100
He would not do anything even this much to 
disturb a person.

304
00:24:52,100 --> 00:25:01,270
As far as possible He would like to try to 
console, and have the formalities of good

305
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,270
living.

306
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,160
Formality is meant for good living and good 
understanding.

307
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,010
Unless and until you have this sense of responsibility, 
your collectivity cannot be alright.

308
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,330
You cannot be collectively alright.

309
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,930
You need not be a machine for that.

310
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:21,270
There is no need to be a machine, like Japanese, 
only one person says another doesn’t come.

311
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:27,630
But this one kind of a funny individualism 
that you have got will never give you that

312
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:32,000
collectivity that is expected of Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,940
We all have to be one, being responsible for 
each other.

314
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,540
Not only for one or two persons, because he 
is my friend, he is my husband, she is my

315
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,290
wife but for all of us.

316
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:49,440
We have to be responsible for their things, 
for their children, for their house, for everything.

317
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,250
We have to be responsible.

318
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:58,010
And if this sense of responsibility is lacking, 
how will you have responsibility for your

319
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,010
self-realisation.

320
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:04,580
Only it can be a self-centred thing, thinking 
that I’m very much better, my powers are

321
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,270
better, I must have more powers.

322
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:14,630
But if you do not have this sense of responsibility 
why should God also give you powers.

323
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:22,470
The main thing is your right side is completely 
weak, that is the surya nadi, that is the

324
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,340
nadi which is called as the nadi by which 
people hold their prana, so it gives you the

325
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,340
prana shakti.

326
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:36,710
It’s the prana shakti within you which is 
the vital force of energy within you, which

327
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,750
is lacking.

328
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:44,380
Now this lacking is added up by your heart, 
at least for a man like that whose prana shakti

329
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,530
is exhausted.

330
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:52,350
At least for such a man if the heart is there, 
he can really use that power which is accumulating

331
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:58,040
in the head and exhausting him, like eating 
up his brain.

332
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,950
If he has the heart in it.

333
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:06,420
Now this is what I have told you last time 
that the right side of human beings is very

334
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:14,210
important when it comes to Sahaja Yoga because 
when the Kundalini rises, your right side

335
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,940
is also, right side is also awakened.

336
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,620
Now the question is why Sahaja Yoga does not 
spread in England so far.

337
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,860
This is a very good question.

338
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,710
Many people have asked it.

339
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,300
While in Australia it’s spread so fast.

340
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,410
The reason is the right side is missing.

341
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,220
The right side to be awakened, first of all 
there should be some right side.

342
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,400
If there is no right side, what do you awaken?

343
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,010
If there is no light at all, what are you 
going to awaken?

344
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,740
There has to be a lamp to be awakened.

345
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,540
So all these topics and talks that we have 
in the society: ,I know, I know’, and then

346
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,940
you ask them this and they say: ‘I don’t’ 
[?]. How are you, like.

347
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,750
[?] All these accents and all that, one should 
give up.

348
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,350
One should know that you have to be responsible.

349
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,950
That’s a very, very important thing of life.

350
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:14,570
I personally think unless and until you feel 
that responsibility, that heart into Sahaja

351
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,550
Yoga you will enjoy just by talk as you would 
just enjoy anything else.

352
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:23,230
Real enjoyment comes when your spirit really 
blows out the vibrations.

353
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:28,330
You are taking my vibrations alright, you 
are feeling them.

354
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,740
But what about yours?

355
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,930
Are you blowing your vibrations out or they 
are just eating your brain.

356
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,210
Simple questions, are you blowing any vibrations 
outside?

357
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:47,360
We have some sahaja yogis when they just enter 
into a house, immediately, everyone feels

358
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
it.

359
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,760
Everyone can feel it that somebody has come.

360
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,250
Immediately, the whole thing cools down in 
no time, somebody has come.

361
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,040
There are some here also, not that there are 
none.

362
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,000
But they’re few.

363
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,880
You have to blow out vibrations, otherwise 
you are just a liability to yourself.

364
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,630
Why don’t you blow out vibrations, because 
you don’t feel responsible.

365
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:15,230
In your day to day life, morning till evening, 
you have to see that you develop this instrument

366
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,100
of responsibility within you.

367
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:24,340
Otherwise the vibrations won’t flow because 
the main reason is that our nervous system

368
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,370
comes to us through our right side.

369
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:35,980
Our nervous system is built up by our right 
side.

370
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,150
All the elements within us have built up.

371
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,020
If the elements are weakened, if the chakras 
which are made by these elements, as you know

372
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,760
all these charkas are made by elements, if 
the part is weak, nothing is going to work

373
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
out.

374
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:59,070
You should be able to hold that water of love 
or you can say the water of bliss and should

375
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:04,280
be able to pour it out to others.

376
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:10,350
Unless and until you are able to do that, 
Sahaja Yoga won’t spread.

377
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,750
It will spread very slowly.

378
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,120
This is the difference I feel between English 
and Australians.

379
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,980
That the quality of mind is thousands times 
better than Australians.

380
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,450
They are not scholars.

381
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,410
I found very few people there who are even 
graduates.

382
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,530
Here everybody is a PhD or may be a MAD.

383
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,670
But they are all very well educated.

384
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:35,900
Despite all that, Sahaja Yoga does not spread 
out, why?

385
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,670
The reason is the quality of mind is good, 
but the action is extremely poor because they’re

386
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,760
exhausted, tired, you are fighting in the 
mind.

387
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,860
You are not doing anything by which you blow 
it out.

388
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:54,480
The right side is what you call the Brahmas, 
the Brahmadeva’s creation and the Brahma

389
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,940
Shakti as they call it.

390
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,940
This is the power of Brahma which is flowing 
through you.

391
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:08,750
We call it the power of the spirit, it’s 
true.

392
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,260
But the spirit, the power of the spirit flows 
on your central nervous system.

393
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:21,020
If there is the electricity all stored up 
here and there are very weak wires, what can

394
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,970
you do with all that stored up energy.

395
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:33,140
The wires have to be improved and for this 
wire your right side has to be improved immensely.

396
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,980
Every minute you have to be responsible and 
this is what is lacking.

397
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,970
Then I find when … for [incomrehensible] 
responsible, they feel extremely hurt.

398
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,620
They feel that they should really shout and 
scream and should do something.

399
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,340
They don’t know that these are really the 
saints, they are realised souls.

400
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,230
They are great people, no doubt.

401
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,230
But their right side is weakened.

402
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:04,990
But that is not a great thing to accept, it 
is a very bad thing.

403
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,430
But that does not mean you should feel guilty 
again, I am saying.

404
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,640
Because very nice, this is the way you manage 
is to feel guilty.

405
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,030
Because feeling guilty is the best way, ‘I’m 
sorry, I’m sorry.

406
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,030
I should have done it.

407
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,610
I know, I know’ – finished!

408
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,630
Then how can you improve?

409
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,720
If you are about fear filled up all the time 
with responsibility denied, all the junk you

410
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:30,090
have created out of that, you are pushing 
into that pouch and then you say: ‘Yes,

411
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,940
yes, I know, I should not have done that!’

412
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,911
Now what can you do?

413
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:39,630
As I mother you can’t say ‘you’ll hang 
yourself by the nearest tree’.

414
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,260
What do I do?

415
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,020
I’m just look at you flabbergasted.

416
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
I said: ‘Really?’

417
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
‘Yes, I should have done but I haven’t 
done it.’

418
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,930
For example, I should tell somebody you better 
cook for 10 people, they are coming and the

419
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:53,340
person says: ‘No, I’m sorry, I forgot, 
I didn’t cook.’

420
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,500
You are doomed.

421
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
You cannot hit him with the back can you?

422
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
What to do.

423
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
That’s how you are at a standstill.

424
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
You really don’t know how to deal.

425
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,610
The point is in all this talking of spirit 
and God, one has to know the vehicle has to

426
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,610
be better.

427
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,430
The vehicle is so very poor that it cannot 
carry, otherwise you will emit vibrations

428
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,430
like that.

429
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,430
I know you can.

430
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,480
Wherever you stand you’ll attract.

431
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,610
People must gather round.

432
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:19,070
You’ll be amazed, I went to Australia for 
how many months, at the most a month or so.

433
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:26,460
I came back from there, already seven centres 
have started and every centre has got at least

434
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:33,910
300 regular people coming.

435
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:37,990
It is not to feel guilty.

436
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:43,130
I’m not saying, but to awaken yourself.

437
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,372
To arise to this point.

438
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:51,762
To be elated with understanding that you have 
to rise up to that point and that you have

439
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:55,130
to take up that position because you are the 
warriors of truth.

440
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,520
You are the people who are seekers who have 
been for ages and you have no business to

441
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
be irresponsible.

442
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,230
You have to do it.

443
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:10,100
It is my earnest desire that you understand 
what I am saying.

444
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,990
Just sitting, meditating, putting hands towards 
me or towards the photograph is not everything.

445
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,119
You are still receiving.

446
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,879
You are still at the receiving end.

447
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,049
You have to be on the giving end.

448
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:22,339
How will you do it?

449
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:27,250
You get so many vibrations sometimes that 
you cannot feel after some time, it’s so

450
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,250
filled the pitcher is so much filled.

451
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,250
But what about pouring it out?

452
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,460
Why you cannot pour it out?

453
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:39,639
The reason is that the vehicle within you, 
which is the right side, is the pingala nadi,

454
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:42,700
is out of gear.

455
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,510
And this is what one has to understand.

456
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:50,790
That can be built up only when you know about 
Shri Rama’s life, the way He led His life.

457
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,389
Every minute of His life was dynamic.

458
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:59,230
Not a single minute He wasted in life.

459
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:05,259
Every minute, whether He was in the forest 
or He went to a place with His wife when He

460
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:13,130
was in exile, and there He knew His wife was 
a very shy lady and She would not take Her

461
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,140
bath in the open.

462
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,490
So there’s a rock which is completely holed 
out.

463
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,540
Such a big rock, holed out can you imagine.

464
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,799
Inside there is a water.

465
00:35:26,799 --> 00:35:29,710
Water taps sort of a thing coming out, there’s 
a water coming out.

466
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:36,549
So that there’s stone here, stone here, 
stone there, and at the end of it there’s

467
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:40,299
an opening so that there’s light coming 
from this side, light coming from that side

468
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:42,450
but inside nobody can see.

469
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,730
There are trees.

470
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:49,359
There are trees like which are called as chikakaye 
[??] means that its kind of a soap giving

471
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,559
tree are created by Him for His wife.

472
00:35:52,559 --> 00:36:01,030
Anywhere He lived He created a new dimension, 
a new house, a new style of life.

473
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,510
Of course He was an incarnation you can say.

474
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:10,880
But He’s your ideal and not those people 
who sit out for hours together drinking something

475
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,599
and thinking they are great martials.

476
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:19,109
I see all of them sitting here at a church 
here and one of them was asked by someone

477
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:21,700
who was passing: ‘What are you doing?’

478
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,750
‘We killing ourselves!’

479
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,500
Very proudly to say that.

480
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,390
I mean I just don’t understand, what business 
have they got to kill themselves.

481
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,710
How much time it has taken God to create them 
and here they are sitting and proudly telling

482
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,500
that we are killing ourselves.

483
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:41,460
This is the situation in which I suddenly 
find myself.

484
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,440
So I ask you what should I do?

485
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,810
How should I do?

486
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:50,440
You have to feel responsible in every way 
of life.

487
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:58,070
But you do not think that there is anything 
wrong if you are a hanky panky person.

488
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,650
If your feathers are falling everywhere, it’s 
alright.

489
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,529
To you it really does not matter.

490
00:37:04,529 --> 00:37:07,160
But to the Divine it does.

491
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:15,950
That means a person cannot convey the message 
of God, cannot emit it, the bliss of God,

492
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:20,799
cannot pour that love.

493
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:24,990
We have to become very responsible in every 
day life.

494
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,730
I’m not saying that in Sahaja Yoga but in 
every day life, how you live, what you do.

495
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:32,819
Are you only worried about yourself or you 
are worried about others?

496
00:37:32,819 --> 00:37:34,710
Are you responsible for others?

497
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:40,539
I mean the modern style is not even to wish 
good morning, it’s regarded bad manners.

498
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:47,270
You see it is bad manners even to open door 
to someone, it is bad manners.

499
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,570
They think it’s slavish.

500
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,799
I mean, all manners, all those things, all 
responsibility, seems to be slavish.

501
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:58,863
And this kind of modern ideas that are floating 
in the air, you should throw them away.

502
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:00,869
You have to be human beings of a very great 
quality.

503
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:04,500
You have to be people who have created new 
worlds.

504
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,150
You are going to create that, I know.

505
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:13,890
You have to just rise up to that point and 
not to sink into your guilt’s and say: ‘Oh

506
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,890
God, what have we been doing?’

507
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:19,520
No, awake and arise and get it what you have 
to do.

508
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,559
That is what I feel about England.

509
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,299
England is so great and is the heart, is the 
heart.

510
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:34,640
And look at the condition of the heart.

511
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,799
Your heart is so weak.

512
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:43,660
There’s no heart to anything.

513
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:50,520
Alright you love Me, I love you, but what 
about you loving others, and loving other

514
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
things.

515
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,529
Loving doesn’t mean writing love letters.

516
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:58,780
Doing something about it.

517
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,730
And that’s what, ‘the doing something’ 
is missing and lacking.

518
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:08,570
And that’s what we have to build up our 
right side properly, into proper shape.

519
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:15,050
If we have to really do the cooking, we have 
to know how to light the fire within us and

520
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:18,819
not to sit down and worry how to do it.

521
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:24,869
It is a very great thing to come to England 
really.

522
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:32,529
For one reason that this is the place where 
Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

523
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:36,079
It is going to circulate in the whole world, 
I know through you people.

524
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:45,450
But if you do not improve the communication 
wires of yours is become completely stagnant

525
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,950
and the responsibility of this stagnation 
will be on you the Sahaja Yogis of London,

526
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:58,029
because you did not put your life together, 
that’s why it did not work.

527
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,640
It’s a tremendous responsibility.

528
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,099
Of course to be responsible is wrong for wrong 
things.

529
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:13,380
But not to be responsible for Divine work 
when God has blessed you with self-realisation,

530
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:23,009
is absolutely against God, against yourself, 
against Sahaja Yoga.

531
00:40:23,009 --> 00:40:27,890
The other personality which I was talking 
about is Shri Hanumana.

532
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:37,609
Shri Hanumana is such a great powerful personality 
about whom I did not tell you.

533
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:46,079
That, I mean, Rama once, you see His brother 
was hit by an arrow.

534
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:53,490
And Rama said to Hanumana, that: ‘Why don’t 
you go and get a particular type of a medicine

535
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:59,849
for him and you get it on a particular hill, 
mountain, so you go and get that particular

536
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:00,920
thing.’

537
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:07,280
So He had a power, He had nine powers, navadha 
shakti He had, nine powers, by which He could

538
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,810
become small, He could become big.

539
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,540
And He could lift anything.

540
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,440
He had lots of powers like that, so nine powers: 
anima (remark: reducing one’s physical self

541
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,069
to the size of an atom), lagima (remark: lightness), 
garima (remark: increase weight) - like that.

542
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:19,230
He could become so heavy that nobody could 
lift Him.

543
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,930
I mean these are the powers He has got of 
the right hand side.

544
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:31,140
And so He went down to that mountain and He 
couldn’t see that anywhere, He just couldn’t

545
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,140
see.

546
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,950
He said: ‘Why not take the whole mountain?’

547
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:39,500
He took the whole mountain on Himself and 
He brought it to Rama and said: ‘Now, select

548
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,599
whichever one you like.’

549
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,130
He could have come back and said: ‘Oh, I 
can’t find!

550
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,910
I’m sorry, I know, I’ve been useless.’

551
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,980
If He was an Englishman.

552
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:55,190
But He said: ‘Alright, if you want!’

553
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,539
He brought the whole mountain, now come along 
have it.

554
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:05,359
In every way of His life, you see His sense 
of responsibility and how He carries on.

555
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:16,789
For example, He was sent to Ravana and He 
was asked by Ravana that he told Him that

556
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:19,550
you cannot stay in this place, why did you 
come here.

557
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:25,599
Actually, first He was, He went to Sita and 
told Her that ‘Shri Rama had sent Me’

558
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,619
and He showed the ring and She recognised 
that was the ring of Her husband.

559
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,269
And He said: ‘Mother if you want, I can 
take you on my back.’

560
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:35,269
But She said no.

561
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:38,420
Already you see I am a woman who has come 
with another man.

562
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,710
You don’t want to have another bad name 
and you’ll have a bad name, so I will not

563
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,710
come.

564
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,710
So it’s alright.

565
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,710
You can go back and tell Rama that I am alright.

566
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,059
‘You as a husband, come and fight this man.

567
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:54,289
Otherwise I’m not going to come.’

568
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:57,420
So then He was caught up and taken to Ravana.

569
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:05,980
Now Ravana said that ‘you are a monkey and 
what have you come to do it’.

570
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,660
He said that ‘you better release His wife 
of Shri Rama and He is such and such’.

571
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,160
So He said ‘that you monkey, you are telling 
me this’.

572
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,010
Alright, he said: ‘Burn His tail.’

573
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:21,289
He said: ‘If you burn my tail, I know how 
to use.’

574
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:24,759
He knows how the responsibility of the tail 
is.

575
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:31,520
He started burning the whole of Lanka with 
His tail and He could have said that: ‘Alright

576
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,500
he burnt my tail I better run away, why to 
do such a thing, better avoid, get out, forget

577
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
it.

578
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,749
I am not going to go to Rama, he has burnt 
my tail.

579
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,259
Tomorrow he will do something else.’

580
00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:46,190
He burnt the whole of Lanka.

581
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,549
The whole of it He burnt till Ravana had to 
say, that ‘please forgive and go away.’

582
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:56,690
He did all kinds of tricks to show that He 
was really powerful.

583
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:04,119
In so many ways of His sense of responsibility 
and His dedication and love is expressed.

584
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:14,089
But they say that even if you take once His 
name, whatever work you want to do, it can

585
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:15,089
be done.

586
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:21,160
Any work that you want to be finished will 
be done and His day is a Tuesday.

587
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,859
On Tuesday, if you request Him for anything, 
He will help you to do the work.

588
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:29,171
But it is not like this that you sit down 
and say now come along Hanumana, will you

589
00:44:29,171 --> 00:44:31,510
please do this job?

590
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:35,940
But if you are doing the job, then He comes 
to help you.

591
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:44,980
Means that He activates, He activates and 
He makes your energy flow into that direction

592
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:48,559
that your work is done.

593
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:49,559
He’s so helpful in so many ways that you 
can’t imagine.

594
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:57,210
There are so many sahaja yogis have tried 
it with that and He has created such miracles

595
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:58,950
especially the Australians.

596
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,499
Somehow they have such a feeling for him.

597
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:02,210
I know the reason.

598
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,420
But they have such a feeling for Him that 
every time anything happens, better ask Hanumana.

599
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,450
They ask Hanumana.

600
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:09,510
“Hanumana, now please look after us”.

601
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:13,849
And they have told Me that such miraculous 
things have happened since they have been

602
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:15,039
using Shri Hanumana.

603
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,670
But you must have the vehicle to carry this 
Hanumana.

604
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,869
He’s a very subtle Deity within you.

605
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:27,299
And if you are irresponsible, He hates such 
a person.

606
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:30,530
He hates, He just can’t bear it.

607
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:34,839
He, He thinks they are absolutely useless 
people.

608
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:38,849
He doesn’t pay attention to such people.

609
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:43,829
Those who are not responsible, they may give 
any excuses, they may show off, they may do

610
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:44,829
anything.

611
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,829
He just has no care for such people.

612
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:50,349
He has no love, no respect, no attention for 
the people who are not responsible.

613
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:52,710
There’s a very nice English saying: ‘God 
helps those who help themselves’.

614
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,460
English language has so many beautiful things 
in it, all these nursery rhymes and everything.

615
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,660
I wish people would not just utter those sayings 
but do it.

616
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,769
They listen to Me but they don’t do it.

617
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:09,580
Now you have heard Me today you should see 
how much responsible you are.

618
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:15,240
Now we had our first ashram and if there are 
others, please excuse Me, because it is an

619
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,109
open thing and we have to talk about it.

620
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:23,029
And I was surprised that in our first ashram, 
when I went there, I was amazed.

621
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:27,769
I mean, young people living like pigs.

622
00:46:27,769 --> 00:46:28,769
I couldn’t understand.

623
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:34,200
I mean, they are not hippies, they are not 
taking any smokes, drinks, or anything.

624
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,119
They are so irresponsible!

625
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:43,180
They go to the bathroom, they come out as 
if a bull in a china shop has entered.

626
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,549
They really live like that, I was amazed.

627
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:46,549
How could they?

628
00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:48,369
And we are all graduates, PhDs, MADs, and 
everything.

629
00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:50,450
I was amazed, what has happened to these people.

630
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:51,450
Slowly, slowly they improve.

631
00:46:51,450 --> 00:47:00,010
But this lot went away and a new lot came 
in and a new lot came in.

632
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:05,960
And it’s so surprising that once they become 
responsible and good, somehow or other Hanumana

633
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,299
takes them out.

634
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:09,970
They just get out of it.

635
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:20,259
Now I have to tell you to determine today 
to decide that every moment and movement of

636
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:24,700
your life you are going to feel responsible 
as Hanumana does.

637
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:33,550
Any work that you are doing, about Him it 
is said, [sentence maybe in Hindi ??]. It

638
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:39,980
means for doing any work, He is just ready, 
He is just ready.

639
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:45,759
You tell him anything, He is just ready to 
do it.

640
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:52,730
It is His quality that you should have and 
that quality is so much lacking today in England.

641
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:57,829
All your strikes, all your problems can be 
solved.

642
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:01,359
First time when I came, I was surprised, I 
asked somebody: ‘Are you working?’

643
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,029
He said: ‘No, I am successfully unemployed.’

644
00:48:04,029 --> 00:48:11,259
I said: ‘Really, you are successfully unemployed 
so how do you eat?’

645
00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:13,609
‘Oh, we get our doles.’

646
00:48:13,609 --> 00:48:14,609
‘Oh really.’

647
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:16,680
‘We have securities.’

648
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,980
What are securities, this is nonsense, you 
are parasite.

649
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,980
There is no self-respect.

650
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:24,240
Leave alone the respect … [??], there is 
no self-respect.

651
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:33,069
I was amazed when I told them, all of you 
have to take to work.

652
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:39,170
Anybody you takes the dole is not going to 
stay in the ashram.

653
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,150
I wish your government would take some note 
of it.

654
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,450
That we have to create responsible citizens.

655
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:51,289
In England itself, we have to show that by 
Sahaja Yoga you have turned the tables, you

656
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:57,940
have got smart people, now efficient, responsible.

657
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,010
This is what we have to show.

658
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,920
Once we show this to others, people will be 
amazed.

659
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,539
With other’s money, it’s the same.

660
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:09,070
If you can get hold of somebody else’s money 
that’s the best thing.

661
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,569
This is a very common feature.

662
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:21,210
First time the sahaja yogis went to India 
they came back here, they never wrote a letter

663
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,589
back thanking them.

664
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:23,970
And I was amazed.

665
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,560
For six months, I said: ‘What are you doing?’

666
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,619
‘I know we should have written.

667
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:31,140
I know we should have written.’

668
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,660
But why, why didn’t you write?

669
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,829
No responsibility.

670
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:39,009
What is this, I could not understand.

671
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:44,819
Gradually they developed and developed and 
developed now they feel but those who have

672
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,180
started feeling are the matured sahaja yogis 
I should say.

673
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:53,069
But others who are coming to it must now that 
you have to have a sense of responsibility.

674
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:56,510
Sometimes people who are realised have a feeling: 
‘Oh, now we are realised.

675
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:00,710
Now, nothing, settle down, have the bliss 
of Mother.

676
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,410
Sit down and enjoy it, nothing doing, it will 
stop!’

677
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:08,950
You have to be able to give this to others.

678
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:14,330
You should emit, if you cannot emit those 
vibrations yourself.

679
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,190
If you are enlightened, you should be able 
to give light to others.

680
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,890
You can raise the Kundalini, alright but what 
about your own personality.

681
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:29,089
It is so irresponsible which is no where near 
Hanumana’s.

682
00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:42,050
This Hanumana style of complete obedience 
to your being, the complete emission of that

683
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,950
love that you have received, that divine power 
you have received.

684
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:52,849
Unless and until you achieve that state you 
should not be satisfied with your self-realisation.

685
00:50:52,849 --> 00:51:02,400
Self-realisation is only complete when you 
yourself become the giver of light.

686
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,940
You the guru, you the great stars.

687
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,380
That’s My ambition.

688
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:22,309
I know I expect sometimes from My children 
and I want them to understand that I want

689
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:41,529
you to be really honoured in the Kingdom of 
God as great sons of your Mother.

690
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:47,170
May God bless you.

691
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:54,480
You know that but keep it up.

692
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:03,759
I do encourage you by saying all these things.

693
00:52:03,759 --> 00:52:10,880
I do awaken Hanumana and Shri Rama within 
you.

694
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,230
No doubt, I know, but keep them awake.

695
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:43,230
Keep them alert and you have to 
be alert and active, responsible and respectable.

696
00:52:43,230 --> 00:53:09,519
You have to realise that 
you are saints.

697
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:19,910
Saints of a very special quality.

698
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:35,039
The saints who can give realisations to others.

699
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:52,460
There have been not such things like this 
before.

700
00:53:52,460 --> 00:54:39,119
Nor even today there are saints who

701
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:57,200
are realised souls but they don’t know how 
to give realisation.

702
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:12,720
They don’t know so much.

703
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:28,599
You have so much of knowledge and everything.

704
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:40,099
Except the vehicle is poor.

705
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:49,220
It cannot carry the bliss.

706
00:55:49,220 --> 00:56:00,099
The cup has to be alright.

707
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:16,729
Otherwise it cannot carry the beautiful fountain 
of love that is pouring down on this earth.

708
00:56:16,729 --> 00:56:38,640
And that is how you must know that within 
you this is awakened, keep it awakened, keep

709
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:47,829
it … (vague ?). 
Please close your eyes.

710
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:53,950
[continues with guided meditation]
