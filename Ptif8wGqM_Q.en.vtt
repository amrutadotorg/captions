WEBVTT

00:05.697 --> 00:10.346
“It is important for us to make our axis deeper.”

00:12.011 --> 00:15.065
In the whole evolutionary process
the Mother Earth

00:15.266 --> 00:18.324
has played a very big part through
her axis.

00:18.525 --> 00:23.800
In the same way in human beings, the axis
is the most important point.

00:24.001 --> 00:28.279
That’s the main principle of life we have
got, is our axis.

00:28.470 --> 00:33.528
We have to stand on our axis. Those who
do not stand on their axis,

00:33.729 --> 00:37.010
stand more towards the left or towards
the right,

00:37.211 --> 00:44.187
are capable of complete destruction;
because either they will be destroyed

00:44.388 --> 00:48.243
by too much of right side or too much
of left side.

00:48.444 --> 00:53.362
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

00:53.563 --> 01:00.047
Now those people who do not have a proper
axis can have problems of different chakras,

01:00.248 --> 01:06.684
of different kind of quality in a person.

01:06.885 --> 01:11.645
A person who stretches his axis too much,
puts back his head like this,

01:11.846 --> 01:16.602
is a person who is very right-sided and
creates problem with his ego;

01:16.803 --> 01:20.687
and the one who absolutely bends down like
a slavish person

01:20.888 --> 01:26.627
also is a person who goes towards his
destructiveness.

01:26.828 --> 01:31.633
Now there’s a big problem between these
two types of people,

01:31.834 --> 01:38.151
one trying to dominate another, and when
they start dominating another person

01:38.370 --> 01:43.072
they actually destroy themselves, as well as
destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

01:43.369 --> 01:47.654
One has to understand that what is the best
within a human being

01:47.855 --> 01:54.787
is his axis, and everybody has an axis, and
one must respect the axis of every person.

01:54.988 --> 01:59.347
In Sahaja Yoga I don’t know you by your
faces so much;

01:59.548 --> 02:04.605
I know you by your chakras, by your
Sushumna, what sort of a Sushumna you have.

02:04.806 --> 02:07.944
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you
as a deep person.

02:08.145 --> 02:10.979
If you have a superficial Sushumna, I know
you

02:11.180 --> 02:16.366
as a person with a very superficial type
of a Sushumna.

02:16.567 --> 02:23.946
And even if you make up something by sort
of being very nice or good,

02:24.147 --> 02:30.017
or talking about Sahaja Yoga or knowing too
much about Sahaja Yog, and saying things

02:30.218 --> 02:34.782
which will baffle normally anyone as if you
are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

02:34.983 --> 02:37.974
I know how deep you are.

02:38.175 --> 02:42.392
So the depth on the axis is more important
than anything else.

02:42.593 --> 02:46.070
Your axis has to be very deep.

02:46.271 --> 02:52.049
Now you will say that, “Mother, the axis is
the same as it is, so how can it be deep?”

02:52.250 --> 02:56.602
So the, in the axis as you see is made
in human beings,

02:56.803 --> 03:02.881
is like a three-and-a-half coiled
paper-like thing,

03:03.082 --> 03:09.292
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small

03:09.493 --> 03:14.302
little, we can call a very, very hair-like
thing

03:14.503 --> 03:19.218
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass
through.

03:19.419 --> 03:23.381
But when the person is deep this Brahma
Nadi is bigger,

03:23.582 --> 03:29.882
and all the rest of them which are coiled
into each other are smaller;

03:30.083 --> 03:37.413
while the people who are not deep, their
outside what you call the foldings

03:37.614 --> 03:42.028
are bigger than the inside small thing.

03:42.229 --> 03:45.667
Now such people could be apparently very
dynamic,

03:45.868 --> 03:50.735
may look very intelligent, may look very
smart, may look to be very good-looking

03:50.936 --> 03:56.775
or whatever it may be outwardly, but
inwardly they are not deep.

03:56.976 --> 04:02.899
Inwardly if they are deep, their whole
attitude is beautiful.

04:03.100 --> 04:07.101
They are very joy-giving people, they are
very joy-giving.

04:07.302 --> 04:13.562
And the more if you meet a person
of another kind he may look joyous,

04:13.763 --> 04:18.712
he may try to give you joy, but the joy
won’t be really that deep;

04:18.913 --> 04:22.564
it would be like a joy-killing.

04:23.488 --> 04:30.169
So it is important for us to make our axis
deeper, and that is where we lack

04:30.370 --> 04:37.825
the proper assiduity, the proper effort we
have to put in.

04:38.026 --> 04:43.593
Now some people have automatically a very
deep axis,

04:43.794 --> 04:47.473
and some people have very, very

04:47.674 --> 04:53.970
what you should say, a very constricted
type of the axis.

04:54.171 --> 04:58.617
This axis has to be grown. Now when you
come for My puja and all that

04:58.818 --> 05:04.599
I do expand it, I agree, but it is
a temporary thing.

05:04.800 --> 05:11.748
To retain it at that point one has to work
at home, in the collective also.

05:11.949 --> 05:17.524
One has to work very much at home with
meditation.

05:17.725 --> 05:22.460
But it should be done seriously. It should
not be just a joke,

05:22.621 --> 05:26.481
to be frivolous, to be stupid – that’s not
the way.

05:26.682 --> 05:30.272
It should be done very seriously,
in the meaning

05:30.473 --> 05:36.430
that it is a devoted task you have taken,
it’s a meditative thing;

05:36.631 --> 05:42.471
it’s a prayer to God we can call it, it’s
a puja to God.

05:43.310 --> 05:54.263
Is to be done with that reverence, because
reverence is the key of achievement.

05:54.464 --> 05:59.091
If you have no reverence about yourself and
no reverence of others,

05:59.292 --> 06:04.634
then it cannot be done. But first you must
have reverence for your own life.

06:04.835 --> 06:07.597
“What am I doing with my life? Where am I
wasting it?

06:07.798 --> 06:10.353
Why should I waste it? Why shouldn’t I be
deep?

06:10.554 --> 06:13.110
After all, there must be some purpose
of my life.

06:13.311 --> 06:16.276
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?”

06:16.477 --> 06:19.712
All these things if they pop into your
head,

06:19.913 --> 06:23.738
then you will understand it’s very easy
to fight out your ego,

06:23.939 --> 06:27.157
because normally on small, small things
people fight.

06:27.358 --> 06:31.733
I’ve seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people
fight on things like,

06:31.934 --> 06:35.091
I mean which are so useless, absolutely
useless.

06:35.292 --> 06:38.740
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

06:38.941 --> 06:42.439
the way people fight over small things
and quarrel.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.793
But a deep person, even if he doesn’t speak
much,

06:45.994 --> 06:51.842
even if he doesn’t show off much, even if
he doesn’t sit in the front line,

06:52.043 --> 06:58.624
he expresses himself through his depth,
because I can work out better through that.

06:59.484 --> 07:03.862
So to develop this one must meditate,
important thing is to meditate;

07:04.063 --> 07:08.616
every day, every day, every day. You may
not eat your food one day,

07:08.817 --> 07:13.437
you may not sleep one day, you may not go
to your office one day,

07:13.638 --> 07:16.357
you may not do anything that you are doing
every day –

07:16.534 --> 07:20.194
but you must meditate every day. That’s
an important point,

07:20.395 --> 07:28.241
to develop the central constricted part
into a bigger area.

07:28.593 --> 07:35.237
Now when that happens that you start
developing it,

07:35.438 --> 07:41.673
the first thing you'll notice about yourself
that you do not care for any comfort,

07:41.874 --> 07:48.654
you’re not bothered about any, any material
thing.

07:48.855 --> 07:53.256
Whatever it is you are above it, you just
don’t bother your head – let it be.

07:53.425 --> 07:59.533
You just don’t want to put your neck into
a thing where you do not belong.

07:59.734 --> 08:03.148
You just get out of it, and you think that,

08:03.349 --> 08:07.060
“Oh God, this is too much for me, I just
don’t care for it.”

08:07.261 --> 08:12.749
So your whole attention now moves inward.
When the attention starts moving inward

08:12.950 --> 08:19.321
then it expands more. It’s the inner part
which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

08:19.522 --> 08:23.478
and starts expanding and expanding.

08:23.679 --> 08:28.640
Now in small, small things also: say
for example

08:28.841 --> 08:36.039
if I have not mentioned somebody and
mentioned somebody else,

08:36.240 --> 08:39.584
then they feel, “Oh, why didn’t Mother
mention my name?”

08:39.785 --> 08:44.239
It's too smallest thing that it doesn’t
matter.

08:44.440 --> 08:49.346
As long as you have a deep axis you are
with Me, I am with you,

08:49.547 --> 08:52.147
absolutely one with each other.

08:52.348 --> 08:56.747
But these outward things are, “Oh, She gave
a nice sari to another one,

08:56.948 --> 09:00.222
She never gave us a sari, She didn’t do
this, didn’t do that.”

09:00.423 --> 09:02.912
All those things if it comes to your head,

09:03.113 --> 09:10.011
that means absolutely it’s true that there
is something lacking within you.

09:10.212 --> 09:14.620
Or if you try to complain, “Oh, I went
there, I had to go by a bus

09:14.821 --> 09:20.655
and I had to stand on this thing,” that
shows that you are not comforted at all.

09:21.726 --> 09:26.977
This widening comforts you. That’s
the comforting thing,

09:27.178 --> 09:32.029
and that really makes you feel so
comfortable in any circumstance,

09:32.214 --> 09:43.484
in any position, in any lifestyle, and you
do not want to have any other comfort.

09:44.814 --> 09:49.382
And this one has to develop, through
meditative effort.

09:50.095 --> 09:55.434
This balance comes through our depth, and
that depth has to be improved.

09:55.635 --> 10:02.602
Not through just by talking about it,
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

10:02.808 --> 10:10.250
but actually seriously doing meditation,
actually seriously doing meditation.
