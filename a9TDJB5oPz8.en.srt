1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,710
You know what has happened.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:22,440
You know Mathias how great he was, 
how much he fought for Sahaja Yoga,  

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,460
how much he worked for it. So generous, so 
surrendered, and very innocent person he was.

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,851
He was such a precious son of mine.

5
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,035
I did feel that he's having a bad time because 
of his other activities

6
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:58,652
And I warned him twice, once individually 

7
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:04,080
but he didn't take 
it that seriously, perhaps he might be thinking  

8
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,234
that Mother is always careful about us, 
concerned about us.

9
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:17,251
But when I called him individually and told him for half an hour, 
he should have understood what I was saying.

10
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:22,229
Apart from a Sahaja Yogi, he was a great patriot.

11
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,745
He was working for Poland trying to help them

12
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:29,858
to improve their financial conditions in there.

13
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,664
But for that, he has to go- he had to go to Poland 
many a times.

14
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,871
I had warned him not to go anymore.

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,720
But I don't think it took me 
that seriously, as I told him,  

16
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,353
I don't know how to make things look very serious.

17
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:05,325
You all have to take one lesson 
from this. I have to make very

18
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:17,280
earnest request that if I tell you not 
to do something, please just listen to me. 

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,685
You are under my protection, no doubt,

20
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:22,771
we had miracles recently

21
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:25,701
of people being saved from death traps and things.

22
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:31,663
But for that, if I warn you,
 if there's some internal trouble,  

23
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,028
you all should take it very seriously. 
I will never waste my words for nothing at all !

24
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,670
For him, it is no loss because he'll be born again.

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,559
it's just like changing your clothes I know.

26
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:54,176
But we'll miss him very much.

27
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,663
No doubt.

28
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,748
For everything, not for work but for his 
love,

29
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:03,114
for his compassion, for his forgiveness,

30
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:09,900
and extremely gentle handling of things.

31
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:14,102
There were lots of problems in Switzerland,

32
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,506
funny type of problems, which he 
solved very carefully, beautifully

33
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,902
and many things he solved on his own, without 
telling me,

34
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:28,690
which was really very remarkable.

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,041
He never wanted to trouble me for anything.

36
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,413
I don't know how to count all the good qualities 
he had

37
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,747
and how he was an expert in many things.

38
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,475
He had bought one watch for me

39
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:00,720
as 
a present from Swiss people, I think,

40
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,120
and it was known as Patek Philippe,
it's supposed to be the best.  

41
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:08,772
And that got spoiled.

42
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:14,054
He says, "Mother, this hits the ego of these Patek Philippe people".

43
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,269
So rightly said!

44
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,229
I said, "How?" He said, "They think no end  
of themselves, you see.

45
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,986
They give guarantees.

46
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:27,161
When I showed them, they said, "We don't know 
how it is spoiled".

47
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:30,000
I had not used it even.

48
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:33,904
I've seen it, that's all.

49
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,936
So, he said, "They felt very much frightened

50
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:40,868
as to what had happened how their watch has been 
spoiled".

51
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,724
I said, "They need some introspection".

52
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,856
That's why it has happened.

53
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:51,533
There're so many beautiful memories of him;

54
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:02,870
all that I'm thinking of the nice 
beautiful stories he told me about people.

55
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,687
Last time, he brought a newspaper, saying that,
 "Mother, see what these Catholics  are doing in Switzerland.

56
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,873
Now show them".

57
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,258
I said, "You'd better show them. They are not 
bothered".

58
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:23,057
He said, "They'll bother if you go on hitting them like this, they'll bother.

59
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,929
They'll have to bother. People have to bother".

60
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,315
All the time, his wisdom has helped.

61
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:41,319
And very practical sense of dealing with things.

62
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,053
But I feel now after the death of a Sahaja Yogi,

63
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:55,890
the sadness becomes collective.

64
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,094
Also, it bothers me too much.

65
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,492
I haven't slept last night at all.

66
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:14,327
And I'm sure his soul would be very 
disturbed to see that we are all very sad.

67
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,614
And he would not like it.

68
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,608
 If I had changed the program to Switzerland,  

69
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:25,602
 he would have blamed himself 

70
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:35,000
that, "Because of me, my sudden departure, it has 
all been changed or stopped". 

71
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,433
So, as Sahaja Yogis, we must understand the death,

72
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,358
that there is a soul,

73
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:43,605
and the soul is here,

74
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:47,107
watching all of us, even me.

75
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,780
And it wants to see that you are all very happy,

76
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,850
that you are not feeling it (sadness) within yourself.

77
00:06:58,006 --> 00:07:02,016
So, to give him complete peace and joy,

78
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,957
we have to just think that he has left us,

79
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:09,239
and he'll be back very soon with us.

80
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:12,216
May God bless you all.

73
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,843
Normally we don't have any programs on Fridays but they said, "We'll have programs". I said, "All right, have it". 

74
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:31,359
But it was nice because I think, little bit, it will change.

75
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,912
The clouds will go over.

76
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,024
We'll have Guru Puja on Sunday. It's a good day.

77
00:07:55,278 --> 00:08:00,194
But we should have little early, it's important.

78
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,909
Not very early but little early I hope we'll 
try to do that.

79
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,202
Now your stage is done, everything is done. I don't know what the corrections you want to do.

80
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:22,393
Whatever it is, let us try to do the Guru Puja a little early. 

81
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:25,347
Normally, we start at two o'clock. It’s too much. It should start say, about 12, if that suits you. 

82
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:29,213
 It should start say, about 12, if that suits you. 

83
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,433
Another request I have to make, is that

84
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:38,446
our water supply has, sadly, I don't know has happened to it.

85
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:41,752
So, it's best is that you go to the river to have a bath.

86
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:47,263
You might find that the river is very cold but this cold water 
is very energy giving.

87
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:54,730
into the river Ganges, in Haridwar, you feel as if it's a freeze, 

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,693
freezing point, and your feet start freezing.

89
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,768
But once you get out of it, you are red and feels so energetic and so happy.

90
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:11,556
So, I would request you to go to the river and all of you, if you go there, it won't be that cold also.

91
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,636
We had no water at all. So, I think that the consumption of water is bit too much, 

92
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,330
compared to the tanks we have.

93
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:25,215
So, it's all right, morning time, you can do anything. 

94
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,826
And also people who will be in Daglio, there’s this beautiful river there. 

95
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:33,128
You can go in that river. But here is a river, there's also swimming pool.  

96
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:36,003
And we have no- they have no objection for that. 

97
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:39,658
So, it's a nice way to go there and have some nice time. 

98
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:41,795
Thank you very much.
