00:09:33.278 --> 00:09:40.070
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:46.487
to this great country of yoga.

00:09:51.362 --> 00:09:59.778
Today first of all we have to establish

00:10:01.445 --> 00:10:07.028
our desire within ourselves

00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:09.778
that we are seekers

00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:17.028
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

00:10:18.778 --> 00:10:24.028
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

00:10:24.694 --> 00:10:29.611
The whole universe

00:10:29.778 --> 00:10:34.528
should be enlightened with your desires.

00:10:34.945 --> 00:10:38.861
Your desires should be so intense

00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:43.278
that they should emit out

00:10:43.362 --> 00:10:48.945
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

00:10:49.028 --> 00:10:54.111
which is the pure desire

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:58.528
of attaining the spirit.

00:10:58.694 --> 00:11:01.195
That's the real desire.

00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:08.527
All the other desires are like mirage.

00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:20.527
You are the people who are chosen by God.

00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:30.611
Specially, first to express your desire,

00:11:30.694 --> 00:11:34.528
and then to achieve it.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:46.278
And by intense desire of purity

00:11:46.362 --> 00:11:51.028
you have to purify the whole world.

00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:53.278
Not only the seekers,

00:11:53.362 --> 00:11:57.611
but even those who are not seekers.

00:12:02.028 --> 00:12:10.362
You have to create an aura around this universe,

00:12:10.445 --> 00:12:18.362
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

00:12:18.445 --> 00:12:21.861
the spirit.

00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:33.945
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

00:12:36.528 --> 00:12:46.028
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:50.195
is this all-pervading power,

00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:55.278
is the Kundalini within you.

00:12:55.861 --> 00:12:59.528
Kundalini has only one desire,

00:12:59.694 --> 00:13:03.111
is to be the spirit

00:13:03.278 --> 00:13:08.111
and anything else if you desire

00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:12.278
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:15.778
Only when it knows

00:13:15.861 --> 00:13:22.445
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

00:13:24.778 --> 00:13:33.445
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

00:13:34.528 --> 00:13:38.111
it is awakened.

00:13:39.028 --> 00:13:45.778
If you do not have the desire,

00:13:45.861 --> 00:13:48.778
no-one can force you.

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:51.278
Sahaja Yogis should never try

00:13:51.445 --> 00:13:56.611
to force this desire on other people.

00:13:56.694 --> 00:13:59.278
The first ordeal we face,

00:13:59.362 --> 00:14:02.861
as soon as you get your Realization,

00:14:02.945 --> 00:14:08.528
is that you just start thinking of your family.

00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:13.195
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

00:14:13.278 --> 00:14:16.527
my father has not got it,

00:14:16.528 --> 00:14:19.195
my wife has not got it,

00:14:19.362 --> 00:14:23.527
my children have not got it.'

00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:32.445
You must know that these relations are worldly.

00:14:32.527 --> 00:14:34.694
Sanskrit is loukik.

00:14:34.778 --> 00:14:37.278
They are not aloukik,

00:14:37.362 --> 00:14:41.278
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

00:14:41.445 --> 00:14:43.527
These are worldly relations,

00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:46.778
and these attachments are worldly.

00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:51.778
So if you play into that of course as you know,

00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:55.195
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

00:14:55.278 --> 00:14:58.445
You go ahead, as long as you like.

00:14:58.527 --> 00:15:02.028
People bring Me all their relations,

00:15:02.111 --> 00:15:04.278
parents, this and that

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.778
and ultimately they discover

00:15:06.945 --> 00:15:12.111
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:19.111
They lost so many precious moments,

00:15:19.195 --> 00:15:21.778
so many hours, so many years,

00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:24.694
wasting their energy on people

00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:29.861
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:36.362
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

00:15:36.694 --> 00:15:41.611
may be within you,

00:15:41.778 --> 00:15:47.362
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

00:15:47.527 --> 00:15:52.278
Makes no difference.

00:15:52.694 --> 00:15:54.694
As Christ was told

00:15:54.778 --> 00:15:58.611
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

00:15:58.694 --> 00:16:05.111
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:11.195
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:14.611
into the problems of their family all the time,

00:16:14.778 --> 00:16:17.694
and attract My attention,

00:16:17.861 --> 00:16:21.528
you must know that I am just playing about.

00:16:21.611 --> 00:16:25.611
It is of no value to you.

00:16:25.778 --> 00:16:29.278
For your ascent it is important first of all

00:16:29.362 --> 00:16:31.611
to have no desires

00:16:31.694 --> 00:16:36.778
to create desire in your kith and kin.

00:16:37.527 --> 00:16:41.778
This is the first principle of establishment

00:16:41.945 --> 00:16:45.945
of Mahakali Power.

00:16:48.611 --> 00:16:51.694
Specially in India

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:55.362
where people are too much attached to their family,

00:16:55.445 --> 00:16:59.195
it's a very big problem.

00:16:59.445 --> 00:17:02.611
If you give Realization to one person,

00:17:02.945 --> 00:17:07.362
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

00:17:07.445 --> 00:17:10.945
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:17.195
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

00:17:17.362 --> 00:17:21.445
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

00:17:21.527 --> 00:17:25.111
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:28.861
and absolutely disgusting.

00:17:29.445 --> 00:17:32.195
It should happen to you to understand

00:17:32.278 --> 00:17:35.362
that this is not auspicious.

00:17:35.445 --> 00:17:38.028
If you want to waste your time,

00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:41.945
I will allow you to waste your time.

00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:48.278
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

00:17:48.362 --> 00:17:50.527
first of all one must remember

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:55.528
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

00:17:55.611 --> 00:17:59.528
and this is not your pure desire.

00:18:00.028 --> 00:18:04.362
So try to separate your pure desire

00:18:04.445 --> 00:18:08.611
from your worldly desires.

00:18:09.445 --> 00:18:13.111
It does not by any means,

00:18:13.362 --> 00:18:17.945
suggest that you give up your family,

00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:22.527
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

00:18:22.528 --> 00:18:24.861
But you witness them

00:18:24.945 --> 00:18:31.028
and see, as you would see anybody else,

00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:36.527
and see for yourself, whether

00:18:36.611 --> 00:18:40.527
they are really desirous or not.

00:18:40.611 --> 00:18:42.278
If they are - well and good.

00:18:42.362 --> 00:18:45.945
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

00:18:46.028 --> 00:18:47.861
It works both ways.

00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:51.611
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

00:18:51.694 --> 00:18:56.945
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

00:18:57.028 --> 00:19:05.195
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

00:19:05.778 --> 00:19:12.527
you have to get out of so many things.

00:19:12.611 --> 00:19:17.111
But for people who are attached to their family,

00:19:17.362 --> 00:19:20.861
are bound by their family,

00:19:21.111 --> 00:19:23.028
they have to see to it

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:27.028
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:31.111
at least don't force them on Me.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:45.237
Now this desire within us,

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.736
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:53.195
comes to us in so many ways.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.736
As I told you first of all,

00:20:55.819 --> 00:20:58.278
it comes to us after Realization,

00:20:58.403 --> 00:21:00.653
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:00.778 --> 00:21:06.237
to do something about our relations.

00:21:06.445 --> 00:21:09.694
Then the second desire that comes to us,

00:21:09.945 --> 00:21:14.819
that let us try to cure people,

00:21:14.903 --> 00:21:19.445
who are our relations.

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:21.903
This is the second desire,

00:21:22.028 --> 00:21:23.445
you should face yourself and see,

00:21:23.528 --> 00:21:26.653
that this has happened to many of you.

00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:32.278
So, right from leprosy

00:21:32.527 --> 00:21:37.653
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

00:21:37.736 --> 00:21:39.986
whatever they have,

00:21:40.237 --> 00:21:45.945
you think you should bring to Mother.

00:21:47.736 --> 00:21:53.237
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

00:21:53.362 --> 00:21:57.778
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

00:21:57.986 --> 00:22:02.986
very simple things - which are so natural

00:22:03.278 --> 00:22:10.237
are brought into your attention.

00:22:11.403 --> 00:22:13.694
So when you have them in your attention I say:

00:22:13.819 --> 00:22:19.153
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

00:22:19.278 --> 00:22:21.903
But if you do not have them in your attention

00:22:22.028 --> 00:22:25.945
they are in My attention.

00:22:28.153 --> 00:22:32.861
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

00:22:32.945 --> 00:22:36.986
But then it's a vicious circle.

00:22:37.653 --> 00:22:41.653
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

00:22:41.736 --> 00:22:43.528
that thinks: 'All right,

00:22:43.611 --> 00:22:45.736
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

00:22:45.819 --> 00:22:51.569
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

00:22:51.653 --> 00:22:56.569
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

00:22:56.653 --> 00:23:00.362
"Have I become the spirit?

00:23:00.736 --> 00:23:04.569
Have I achieved my ultimate?

00:23:04.694 --> 00:23:09.527
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

00:23:09.569 --> 00:23:12.569
Purify it.

00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:18.403
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

00:23:18.527 --> 00:23:21.653
I'll look after that.

00:23:21.736 --> 00:23:27.653
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

00:23:29.237 --> 00:23:36.153
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

00:23:37.028 --> 00:23:45.362
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

00:23:48.028 --> 00:23:53.778
I think you have to value much more of your attention

00:23:54.819 --> 00:23:59.527
than Me, because I can manage,

00:23:59.694 --> 00:24:01.362
many more things within Myself,

00:24:01.487 --> 00:24:06.945
because everything is in My attention.

00:24:07.903 --> 00:24:12.903
But you try to purify your desires,

00:24:13.028 --> 00:24:18.028
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

00:24:18.153 --> 00:24:22.028
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

00:24:22.153 --> 00:24:29.320
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

00:24:32.736 --> 00:24:36.320
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

00:24:36.403 --> 00:24:39.986
That's more than sufficient.

00:24:43.527 --> 00:24:47.611
Then purify yourself.

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:52.819
The desire that you have, you leave it.

00:24:52.945 --> 00:24:54.527
And once you are purified

00:24:54.611 --> 00:24:57.653
that area will be covered through your attention,

00:24:57.736 --> 00:25:01.653
it's very interesting.

00:25:01.736 --> 00:25:08.445
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:11.736
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:15.403
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

00:25:15.527 --> 00:25:18.278
You all rise above that desire.

00:25:18.403 --> 00:25:21.362
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

00:25:21.487 --> 00:25:26.195
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.070
that you are facing

00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:33.527
which you think should be solved by Me.

00:25:34.403 --> 00:25:39.487
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

00:25:39.528 --> 00:25:42.819
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

00:25:42.945 --> 00:25:45.487
that's all. Is a simple thing.

00:25:45.569 --> 00:25:50.028
The rest of it is My headache.

00:25:51.945 --> 00:25:58.403
Now the problems

00:25:58.487 --> 00:26:05.487
that should take your desire on the collective

00:26:05.569 --> 00:26:13.320
should be very different.

00:26:14.237 --> 00:26:19.195
To substantiate your purity,

00:26:19.445 --> 00:26:24.445
to be fragrant with your purity,

00:26:24.528 --> 00:26:27.819
your attention should be on the other side.

00:26:27.903 --> 00:26:29.611
Now you are not facing Me,

00:26:29.694 --> 00:26:31.861
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

00:26:31.945 --> 00:26:37.278
See, the whole attitude will change.

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:42.653
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

00:26:42.778 --> 00:26:46.111
How can I give?

00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:49.527
What is my mistake in giving?

00:26:49.611 --> 00:26:52.153
I have to be more alert.

00:26:52.237 --> 00:26:56.569
Where is my attention?

00:26:56.819 --> 00:26:59.070
I have to be more alert towards myself

00:26:59.153 --> 00:27:03.445
what am I doing?

00:27:03.945 --> 00:27:08.569
What's my responsibility?'

00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:16.528
You must desire that you should be pure.

00:27:16.611 --> 00:27:19.778
You should be pure desire.

00:27:19.903 --> 00:27:23.611
That means you should be the spirit.

00:27:23.736 --> 00:27:28.653
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

00:27:28.778 --> 00:27:34.903
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

00:27:35.028 --> 00:27:38.736
should be manifested,

00:27:38.861 --> 00:27:43.320
should be complete.

00:27:43.403 --> 00:27:49.111
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:49.195 --> 00:27:53.111
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:53.195 --> 00:27:55.653
which is the work of God,

00:27:55.778 --> 00:28:02.195
which has started and you are My hands.

00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:08.070
You have to do the work of God,

00:28:08.195 --> 00:28:12.528
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

00:28:12.653 --> 00:28:15.028
the satanic elements.

00:28:15.237 --> 00:28:17.653
You are not responsible for your family any more,

00:28:17.778 --> 00:28:21.403
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

00:28:21.527 --> 00:28:25.195
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.028
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

00:28:28.111 --> 00:28:30.694
I know this is going to happen.

00:28:30.819 --> 00:28:33.195
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.945
that sorting out will start.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:42.445
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

00:28:42.528 --> 00:28:48.653
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:49.527 --> 00:28:53.819
your responsibility to understand Me,

00:28:53.945 --> 00:28:58.487
better and better and better.

00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:01.569
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

00:29:01.653 --> 00:29:04.653
that is within you,

00:29:04.778 --> 00:29:08.861
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

00:29:08.986 --> 00:29:13.528
works out everything.

00:29:13.778 --> 00:29:19.527
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

00:29:20.445 --> 00:29:25.986
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

00:29:26.111 --> 00:29:28.778
A responsibility to be a respectable person

00:29:28.903 --> 00:29:33.653
and not a cheap personality.

00:29:34.195 --> 00:29:36.778
Every one of you

00:29:36.861 --> 00:29:44.070
is worth the whole universe.

00:29:45.487 --> 00:29:50.278
If you want to rise to that height.

00:29:51.653 --> 00:29:57.945
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

00:29:58.487 --> 00:30:01.028
If you want to rise to that height,

00:30:01.111 --> 00:30:07.153
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

00:30:09.237 --> 00:30:11.736
But those people,

00:30:11.861 --> 00:30:21.778
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:26.153
For example,

00:30:26.237 --> 00:30:30.945
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:39.320
of committing the sin against the Mother,

00:30:39.445 --> 00:30:42.487
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

00:30:42.569 --> 00:30:47.278
of committing sin against the Father.

00:30:48.362 --> 00:30:54.278
It's not difficult at all

00:30:55.653 --> 00:31:00.569
for you to get out of it.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:15.403
The attention is to be kept pure.

00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:20.445
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

00:31:20.528 --> 00:31:25.819
how the attention one can keep it pure.

00:31:26.028 --> 00:31:28.070
If the attention is not pure

00:31:28.195 --> 00:31:31.278
then this desire

00:31:31.403 --> 00:31:36.070
will be always attacked

00:31:36.195 --> 00:31:39.111
by all petty nonsensical things

00:31:39.237 --> 00:31:43.195
which has no meaning in your ascent.

00:31:43.278 --> 00:31:46.237
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

00:31:46.362 --> 00:31:48.945
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:51.195
or what others are talking to him,

00:31:51.278 --> 00:31:53.111
how they are behaving towards him and

00:31:53.237 --> 00:31:56.986
the attention is not on that

00:31:57.111 --> 00:32:02.153
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

00:32:02.237 --> 00:32:08.028
Nor there is the aggressiveness

00:32:10.237 --> 00:32:14.195
of anyone else,

00:32:14.278 --> 00:32:17.237
because nobody is the other.

00:32:17.362 --> 00:32:22.111
But the problem is when I say that,

00:32:22.362 --> 00:32:28.153
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

00:32:28.278 --> 00:32:32.653
Those who are aggressive take the other role

00:32:32.778 --> 00:32:39.278
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

00:32:39.694 --> 00:32:43.611
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

00:32:43.694 --> 00:32:47.070
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

00:32:47.153 --> 00:32:50.653
not about himself.

00:32:50.736 --> 00:32:53.861
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

00:32:53.945 --> 00:32:58.527
finding faults with other people.

00:33:00.945 --> 00:33:04.819
So this desire becomes

00:33:04.945 --> 00:33:10.653
gradually lower and lower and lower

00:33:10.778 --> 00:33:15.819
because of the loads that are put onto it.

00:33:15.945 --> 00:33:19.320
So the alertness is very important,

00:33:19.445 --> 00:33:24.445
complete alertness - satarkata,

00:33:24.527 --> 00:33:29.569
that we should keep our attention

00:33:29.653 --> 00:33:37.487
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

00:33:39.195 --> 00:33:43.528
Desire comes from your heart

00:33:43.653 --> 00:33:45.403
and you are so built

00:33:45.487 --> 00:33:49.986
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:53.070
If you don't have a clean heart,

00:33:53.153 --> 00:33:57.528
this won't keep clean.

00:33:57.611 --> 00:34:00.320
There are people

00:34:00.445 --> 00:34:03.153
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

00:34:03.237 --> 00:34:06.320
and all that, they are all right.

00:34:06.403 --> 00:34:09.861
They are cheating themselves.

00:34:10.111 --> 00:34:13.861
If the heart is not open

00:34:13.986 --> 00:34:17.527
then this is closed.

00:34:17.569 --> 00:34:23.819
So try to open your heart by projecting.

00:34:28.778 --> 00:34:32.945
Projecting it.

00:34:33.028 --> 00:34:37.070
I hope today when you do this puja

00:34:37.195 --> 00:34:41.237
and you do the worship of Mahakali

00:34:41.362 --> 00:34:46.278
and this special yagya,

00:34:46.403 --> 00:34:51.070
we will definitely establish this aura,

00:34:51.195 --> 00:34:55.945
and enlighten the universe.

00:34:56.028 --> 00:34:57.861
But your outlook should be:

00:34:57.986 --> 00:35:02.986
'How much I have contributed to this.

00:35:03.903 --> 00:35:07.237
Am I still thinking of other people,

00:35:07.362 --> 00:35:12.445
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:18.778
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

00:35:20.487 --> 00:35:25.819
So, the left side

00:35:26.028 --> 00:35:33.153
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

00:35:33.237 --> 00:35:39.569
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

00:35:39.653 --> 00:35:42.528
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

00:35:42.611 --> 00:35:46.320
He does not know any other God,

00:35:46.445 --> 00:35:50.070
He does not even know His Father.

00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:52.778
He only knows His Mother

00:35:52.903 --> 00:35:59.362
and completely surrendered to Her.

00:36:02.903 --> 00:36:09.028
But this pure desire has to have the action,

00:36:09.653 --> 00:36:11.736
and about which I'll tell you later

00:36:11.819 --> 00:36:16.403
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

00:36:16.487 --> 00:36:22.320
But today let us establish ourselves

00:36:23.362 --> 00:36:30.403
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

00:36:30.778 --> 00:36:38.569
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

00:36:40.945 --> 00:36:46.070
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

00:36:46.153 --> 00:36:52.819
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

00:36:52.945 --> 00:36:57.819
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

00:36:57.945 --> 00:37:02.403
and so many other books of treaties,

00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:09.028
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

00:37:09.111 --> 00:37:11.403
And they said:

00:37:11.527 --> 00:37:14.611
'How this and how that and how?'

00:37:14.694 --> 00:37:17.195
He said: 'Forget these people.'

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.986
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:24.195
it's just a description of his Mother

00:37:24.403 --> 00:37:26.736
and his devotion to Her

00:37:26.819 --> 00:37:36.237
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

00:37:36.861 --> 00:37:38.611
It is not the surrender

00:37:38.694 --> 00:37:44.611
of your mind through your mind,

00:37:44.736 --> 00:37:50.487
but the surrender of your heart.

00:37:53.527 --> 00:37:57.445
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

00:37:57.527 --> 00:38:01.487
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

00:38:01.653 --> 00:38:05.028
how there have been attacks

00:38:05.111 --> 00:38:09.028
and attacks of negativity on them,

00:38:09.195 --> 00:38:15.694
specially when horrible people like Freud

00:38:16.237 --> 00:38:23.653
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

00:38:23.736 --> 00:38:29.028
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

00:38:29.153 --> 00:38:34.195
and put them on the path of hell.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.028
All that has to be brought out.

00:38:38.153 --> 00:38:42.320
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:47.278
against God, it's anti-God activity.

00:38:47.487 --> 00:38:50.819
Then you will realize

00:38:50.945 --> 00:38:59.320
that you will fight fully, by saying,

00:38:59.445 --> 00:39:06.111
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

00:39:06.237 --> 00:39:07.653
when our Mother is the source

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:12.528
of everything that is sublime, noble,

00:39:12.945 --> 00:39:15.903
all that is nourishing,

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:21.528
all that is elevating, emancipating.

00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:25.153
You have cutting us from our roots.

00:39:25.237 --> 00:39:30.736
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

00:39:30.819 --> 00:39:37.986
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

00:39:38.111 --> 00:39:41.694
of human beings,

00:39:41.819 --> 00:39:49.861
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

00:39:49.986 --> 00:39:53.528
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

00:39:53.653 --> 00:39:55.237
that came on you,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.819
and be alert

00:39:56.903 --> 00:40:02.527
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:05.945
Last I would say you have come to this country

00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:10.487
to see the roots and not the shoot.

00:40:10.528 --> 00:40:13.903
Change your attitude of western style.

00:40:14.028 --> 00:40:16.403
Telephones are no good.

00:40:16.487 --> 00:40:18.903
You cannot get any telephones done here.

00:40:19.028 --> 00:40:22.153
Postage is horrible.

00:40:22.278 --> 00:40:24.278
Railways are worst.

00:40:24.403 --> 00:40:30.528
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

00:40:35.487 --> 00:40:42.653
But, the people are excellent.

00:40:42.778 --> 00:40:44.611
They know what is dharma.

00:40:44.736 --> 00:40:46.528
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

00:40:46.653 --> 00:40:48.527
because it being the Kundalini.

00:40:48.569 --> 00:40:54.195
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

00:40:54.403 --> 00:40:58.653
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

00:40:58.778 --> 00:40:59.861
protecting them.

00:40:59.945 --> 00:41:03.945
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.403
And so many marutis,

00:41:06.527 --> 00:41:09.153
so who can attack this country?

00:41:09.278 --> 00:41:10.528
There is no negative attack

00:41:10.653 --> 00:41:15.945
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.111
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

00:41:19.195 --> 00:41:23.028
they are great people.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:32.945
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

00:41:33.028 --> 00:41:38.320
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

00:41:38.445 --> 00:41:43.861
So to change your attitude towards India

00:41:43.945 --> 00:41:49.278
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

00:41:49.362 --> 00:41:52.153
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

00:41:52.237 --> 00:41:54.736
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

00:41:54.819 --> 00:41:57.819
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:57.945 --> 00:42:00.320
All our railways, all our everything,

00:42:00.403 --> 00:42:02.362
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:02.445 --> 00:42:04.778
so far.

00:42:07.237 --> 00:42:11.320
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

00:42:11.445 --> 00:42:14.903
for heaven's sake.

00:42:16.153 --> 00:42:18.653
But when you arrive here

00:42:18.736 --> 00:42:21.778
you will see that the people are too innocent,

00:42:21.903 --> 00:42:24.362
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

00:42:24.445 --> 00:42:27.070
it's beyond them.

00:42:27.195 --> 00:42:29.528
They are a higher type of people in this respect

00:42:29.653 --> 00:42:31.819
now because they are not attacked,

00:42:31.945 --> 00:42:34.611
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

00:42:34.694 --> 00:42:38.111
you've come out of it.

00:42:38.237 --> 00:42:41.653
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

00:42:41.778 --> 00:42:46.861
That's something great.

00:42:46.986 --> 00:42:49.611
So you would also have a confidence

00:42:49.736 --> 00:42:52.778
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

00:42:52.861 --> 00:42:58.320
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

00:42:58.445 --> 00:43:03.527
So you shouldn't feel lost.

00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:09.320
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

00:43:09.445 --> 00:43:13.237
on Mahakali Day.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.653
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

00:43:17.778 --> 00:43:20.861
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

00:43:20.986 --> 00:43:27.487
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

00:43:27.569 --> 00:43:29.403
But according to Me,

00:43:29.487 --> 00:43:33.986
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:39.861
the desire to be pure,

00:43:43.111 --> 00:43:47.237
and to be cleansed out.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:54.569
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

00:43:55.153 --> 00:43:59.819
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

00:43:59.945 --> 00:44:06.528
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

00:44:06.611 --> 00:44:11.527
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

00:44:11.778 --> 00:44:13.611
It's not difficult.

00:44:13.694 --> 00:44:16.736
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

00:44:16.819 --> 00:44:18.819
because what you surrender,

00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:21.903
I don't want anything from you,

00:44:22.028 --> 00:44:27.070
except that you accept My Love.

00:44:27.195 --> 00:44:32.070
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

00:44:32.195 --> 00:44:35.028
Give up this ego.

00:44:35.153 --> 00:44:38.362
That's all and it will work out.

00:44:38.445 --> 00:44:42.653
I'm sure it's going to work out.

00:44:42.778 --> 00:44:46.153
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

00:44:46.278 --> 00:44:50.195
and I'll definitely settle down there.

01:09:47.278 --> 01:09:52.320
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

01:09:52.528 --> 01:09:54.569
because She is left-sided.

01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:57.070
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

01:09:57.195 --> 01:09:59.945
She weeps.

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:02.237
This is the only manifestation

01:10:02.362 --> 01:10:05.445
of Mahakali is that She desires,

01:10:05.528 --> 01:10:08.945
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

01:10:09.028 --> 01:10:10.445
then She just weeps,

01:10:10.528 --> 01:10:13.653
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

01:10:13.819 --> 01:10:18.070
And sometimes when She's full of Love

01:10:18.153 --> 01:10:21.195
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

01:10:21.278 --> 01:10:24.320
and all these people sitting down here.

01:10:24.445 --> 01:10:27.403
When She cannot express Herself fully,

01:10:27.527 --> 01:10:29.569
with full heart,

01:10:29.778 --> 01:10:39.903
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.195
May God bless you for today's puja,

01:10:42.278 --> 01:10:45.903
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

01:10:46.028 --> 01:10:48.528
that the subtlest of subtle

01:10:48.653 --> 01:10:51.195
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.320
every way, and the Love,

01:10:55.528 --> 01:10:58.611
which culminates into joy.

01:10:58.694 --> 01:11:05.028
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

01:11:05.153 --> 01:11:10.320
will manifest in today's puja.

01:11:10.403 --> 01:11:13.237
May God bless you!
