00:14.780 --> 00:20.190
now of course it is also true the second

00:18.210 --> 00:23.970
point is that in sahaja yoga you have to

00:20.190 --> 00:26.130
become you cannot just say that all

00:23.970 --> 00:28.170
right I am become a sahaja yogi no you

00:26.130 --> 00:30.900
cannot nor can you say I'm following

00:28.170 --> 00:32.489
Shri Mataji that also cannot be said nor

00:30.900 --> 00:34.559
you can say that all right we have an

00:32.489 --> 00:36.540
organization or something like that or

00:34.559 --> 00:38.520
I'm wearing this just because she's my

00:36.540 --> 00:41.489
guru you can't say that I have to become

00:38.520 --> 00:44.040
you have to become a sahaja yogi if you

00:41.489 --> 00:49.019
have to become a sahaja yogi then it has

00:44.040 --> 00:53.640
to be worked out and that takes time to

00:49.019 --> 00:55.800
rise from near each other to miracle

00:53.640 --> 00:57.870
might take style for some people it

00:55.800 --> 01:00.330
takes more time for some people it takes

00:57.870 --> 01:03.979
less time depends on the preparation of

01:00.330 --> 01:07.140
a person also I would say previous lives

01:03.979 --> 01:09.390
good deeds and this lives understanding

01:07.140 --> 01:13.760
so many things are there so it takes

01:09.390 --> 01:18.270
time but at least one can talk about it

01:13.760 --> 01:21.539
so that mas fear is created you can talk

01:18.270 --> 01:24.899
to people tell them that we have found

01:21.539 --> 01:27.780
the truth and it's very simple you can't

01:24.899 --> 01:30.840
pay for it it just works it's

01:27.780 --> 01:33.240
spontaneous it's a living process it's

01:30.840 --> 01:37.109
an evolutionary process you can talk

01:33.240 --> 01:39.780
like that not about me but about sahaja

01:37.109 --> 01:43.070
yoga in an abstract manner it's such a

01:39.780 --> 01:45.780
wonderful thing one should do it all

01:43.070 --> 01:49.590
such talks are going to help us a lot

01:45.780 --> 01:52.979
though I would say those who listen to

01:49.590 --> 01:55.200
you may not get realization but at least

01:52.979 --> 01:57.420
in that posture it will be and that is

01:55.200 --> 01:59.009
going to help us a lot if it is in the

01:57.420 --> 02:02.429
atmosphere people know that there is

01:59.009 --> 02:04.380
something like this coming up for you

02:02.429 --> 02:07.399
people of course you have to work hard

02:04.380 --> 02:12.600
and you have to become sahaja Yogi's

02:07.399 --> 02:15.120
becoming is a little bit difficult to us

02:12.600 --> 02:16.170
sometimes because there's this great

02:15.120 --> 02:18.620
mystery ego

02:16.170 --> 02:22.290
or maybe certain conditionings you see

02:18.620 --> 02:25.190
that people can't give up and that they

02:22.290 --> 02:25.190
find it difficult

02:25.650 --> 02:32.099
get out but if you know how to raise

02:29.010 --> 02:34.110
your Kundalini she will manage it she

02:32.099 --> 02:36.959
knows how to do it and she will give you

02:34.110 --> 02:39.739
that status but first and foremost thing

02:36.959 --> 02:42.360
is to meditate and to raise your body

02:39.739 --> 02:44.040
meditation is the only way you can grow

02:42.360 --> 02:47.160
there's no other way out

02:44.040 --> 02:49.349
because when you meditate you are in

02:47.160 --> 02:53.280
silence you are in thoughtless awareness

02:49.349 --> 02:56.420
then the growth of awareness takes place

02:53.280 --> 02:59.250
then it opens up but if you are thinking

02:56.420 --> 03:01.910
supposing there's a lake and the lake is

02:59.250 --> 03:06.360
completely in a turmoil nothing can grow

03:01.910 --> 03:08.370
but supposing it is silent then notices

03:06.360 --> 03:11.420
can grow anything can grow in it in the

03:08.370 --> 03:17.819
same way if your mind is agitated and

03:11.420 --> 03:22.440
your growth is not yet fully expressing

03:17.819 --> 03:25.500
itself then it's such a vicious circle

03:22.440 --> 03:27.989
that you are agitated

03:25.500 --> 03:30.720
and your growth is hindered again you

03:27.989 --> 03:33.650
are agitated your growth isn't there so

03:30.720 --> 03:38.220
the best way is to take to meditation

03:33.650 --> 03:40.980
when you take to meditation this turmoil

03:38.220 --> 03:41.310
will settle down and ready to settle

03:40.980 --> 03:43.680
down

03:41.310 --> 03:46.079
your growth will take place after

03:43.680 --> 03:48.090
meditation will feel definitely that you

03:46.079 --> 03:50.370
have come out very well you know grow

03:48.090 --> 03:53.190
very well but for that one has to be

03:50.370 --> 03:55.019
very honest you cannot force people to

03:53.190 --> 03:57.030
be honest that's one thing you can't do

03:55.019 --> 03:59.639
you have to be honest yourself you are

03:57.030 --> 04:01.500
not to be hypocrite you have to see for

03:59.639 --> 04:04.319
yourself that whatever you are doing is

04:01.500 --> 04:07.319
for your benevolence it's for your good

04:04.319 --> 04:10.560
and that you have to do it because it is

04:07.319 --> 04:12.690
good for you to begin with and then for

04:10.560 --> 04:14.370
the good of the humanity you are doing

04:12.690 --> 04:16.320
for the good of the humanity

04:14.370 --> 04:18.570
now some people who come for the first

04:16.320 --> 04:20.970
time we will have lots of doubts because

04:18.570 --> 04:23.910
of ego they have lots of doubts because

04:20.970 --> 04:27.770
of ego how can that be how can this be

04:23.910 --> 04:30.270
how I mean all kinds of things they ask

04:27.770 --> 04:34.320
now you have to say that first of all

04:30.270 --> 04:36.599
you develop your inside you develop your

04:34.320 --> 04:38.849
enlightenment your light is not

04:36.599 --> 04:39.720
sufficient in the light only there are

04:38.849 --> 04:43.460
no doubt

04:39.720 --> 04:47.400
supposing in darkness you think that

04:43.460 --> 04:48.960
this table has no cover it's alright you

04:47.400 --> 04:50.550
can think whatever you like but when

04:48.960 --> 04:52.169
there's light you see for yourself there

04:50.550 --> 04:56.699
is a beautiful cover on top of this

04:52.169 --> 05:00.569
table in the same way it happens to us

04:56.699 --> 05:04.409
that we have to achieve a state and as

05:00.569 --> 05:06.150
we achieve that state then there's no

05:04.409 --> 05:09.180
question there's no doubt there's

05:06.150 --> 05:12.330
nothing and you become so empowered it

05:09.180 --> 05:15.120
is such a simultaneous thing it works as

05:12.330 --> 05:18.569
soon as you achieve something it works

05:15.120 --> 05:21.110
when it works then you are convinced

05:18.569 --> 05:24.990
it's so I'd say it was a very beautiful

05:21.110 --> 05:28.190
new chain starts within yourself

05:24.990 --> 05:33.029
and then you really starts enjoying your

05:28.190 --> 05:35.129
joy of yourself now it is for your gain

05:33.029 --> 05:37.860
you have come to sahaja yoga not for

05:35.129 --> 05:40.469
anybody else's gain first of all your

05:37.860 --> 05:43.020
gain and once you gain something then

05:40.469 --> 05:46.680
you can only help others to do something

05:43.020 --> 05:49.050
about it so it is important to

05:46.680 --> 05:54.479
understand the first rule of sahaja Yoga

05:49.050 --> 06:00.569
is that you look at yourself how are you

05:54.479 --> 06:02.310
really progressing or you are worried

06:00.569 --> 06:05.389
about other thing like your business

06:02.310 --> 06:09.349
thing is that all you are worried about

06:05.389 --> 06:13.259
your asset what are you worried about

06:09.349 --> 06:14.729
are you worried about your ascent if you

06:13.259 --> 06:17.669
are worried about your ascent what are

06:14.729 --> 06:20.400
you doing about it that has to be the

06:17.669 --> 06:23.819
main object of life the rest of the

06:20.400 --> 06:27.000
things followed once you are saying the

06:23.819 --> 06:29.729
whole cosmos can look after your

06:27.000 --> 06:31.770
problems but you must ascend into the

06:29.729 --> 06:34.560
kingdom of God that's the main point is

06:31.770 --> 06:41.039
so first of all you have to ascertain

06:34.560 --> 06:45.089
about yourself am i ascending am i

06:41.039 --> 06:46.069
transforming am i giving up all my bad

06:45.089 --> 06:49.039
habits

06:46.069 --> 06:51.580
am i getting rid of my temper

06:49.039 --> 06:55.880
am I getting peaceful

06:51.580 --> 07:01.390
am I now sweet or am I now still the

06:55.880 --> 07:04.220
same horrible criticized er of others

07:01.390 --> 07:06.320
just put your attention to yourself and

07:04.220 --> 07:08.560
see for yourself it's like a mirror you

07:06.320 --> 07:11.750
start seeing yourself in the mirror

07:08.560 --> 07:14.930
what's wrong with you and then you try

07:11.750 --> 07:18.290
to correct it now second point is that

07:14.930 --> 07:21.200
you must see your vibrations what

07:18.290 --> 07:22.700
centers you're catching yourself for

07:21.200 --> 07:25.370
that you have to give yourself up on

07:22.700 --> 07:27.530
that you give yourself abandon and see

07:25.370 --> 07:29.450
for yourself what's wrong with you

07:27.530 --> 07:31.880
when you give yourself up and then you

07:29.450 --> 07:34.970
will know about your chakras and you'll

07:31.880 --> 07:36.980
be amazed so that is how first pay

07:34.970 --> 07:38.000
attention to yourself you find out

07:36.980 --> 07:40.190
what's wrong with you

07:38.000 --> 07:42.530
some of you might be having terrible -

07:40.190 --> 07:44.780
ego then maybe you might be having a

07:42.530 --> 07:46.640
very bad I'll getcha then you should

07:44.780 --> 07:49.070
find out how we got wrong ketchup

07:46.640 --> 07:50.810
this is equal then there's a very good

07:49.070 --> 07:53.240
remedy in sahaja yoga which may look

07:50.810 --> 07:55.220
ridiculous but it's very good remedy is

07:53.240 --> 07:56.900
to beat yourself you choose as they know

07:55.220 --> 08:04.400
it's the meeting with the shoes is

07:56.900 --> 08:07.820
called as a shoe treatment now then you

08:04.400 --> 08:11.060
have to go further see you find yourself

08:07.820 --> 08:13.100
that your right side is hot what you do

08:11.060 --> 08:16.280
is to put your right side towards the

08:13.100 --> 08:20.690
photograph and left side up towards the

08:16.280 --> 08:23.990
ether the ether takes away the heat but

08:20.690 --> 08:26.780
what actually happens is that your right

08:23.990 --> 08:30.470
side gets the vibration and the heat is

08:26.780 --> 08:34.789
pushed towards your left and passes out

08:30.470 --> 08:37.010
into theta now this heat comes from too

08:34.789 --> 08:39.050
much futuristic living those people who

08:37.010 --> 08:41.990
are too much futuristic they have too

08:39.050 --> 08:44.600
much heat and too much heat has to go

08:41.990 --> 08:47.710
away and when this heat starts going

08:44.600 --> 08:50.150
away then you are amazed how it works

08:47.710 --> 08:52.250
for that there are various things we

08:50.150 --> 08:55.310
have to use but mainly for right-sided

08:52.250 --> 08:58.160
people they should not use any light at

08:55.310 --> 09:00.410
all they should not sit in the Sun they

08:58.160 --> 09:02.990
should sit in the moon right they should

09:00.410 --> 09:04.329
read some poetry they should not die

09:02.990 --> 09:07.569
what

09:04.329 --> 09:13.029
they should not look at time they should

09:07.569 --> 09:15.579
allow the time to pass and they should

09:13.029 --> 09:18.339
just become very sort of emotional

09:15.579 --> 09:20.829
people they should sing songs of bhakti

09:18.339 --> 09:22.600
they should not do hot yoga there's so

09:20.829 --> 09:26.680
many things they should not do if their

09:22.600 --> 09:30.000
right side you'd be surprised how people

09:26.680 --> 09:33.339
have been helped through this kind of a

09:30.000 --> 09:36.250
treatment which treats one side of your

09:33.339 --> 09:40.649
being the left-hand side people are the

09:36.250 --> 09:45.430
people as you know are the ones who are

09:40.649 --> 09:50.290
those I who bear up lots of things from

09:45.430 --> 09:55.839
others cry and weep and all the time on

09:50.290 --> 09:58.600
the loser send such people have problems

09:55.839 --> 10:01.000
also because all their organs are

09:58.600 --> 10:04.829
lethargy and they have problems of a

10:01.000 --> 10:07.959
guitar cheek heart the target liver

10:04.829 --> 10:11.709
lethargic intestines everything becomes

10:07.959 --> 10:14.889
very lethargic all these left-side

10:11.709 --> 10:16.779
things can be cured plus they might have

10:14.889 --> 10:19.000
some sort of a bother in them in the

10:16.779 --> 10:20.709
sense they are possessed by someone of

10:19.000 --> 10:23.050
course some of them are possessed by

10:20.709 --> 10:25.000
right side also not that only the left

10:23.050 --> 10:28.630
side is possessed but from the right

10:25.000 --> 10:31.930
side also they're possessed and left

10:28.630 --> 10:33.699
sided positions are of a peculiar type

10:31.930 --> 10:36.910
because they give you pain in the body

10:33.699 --> 10:39.399
you get pains in the body right-sided

10:36.910 --> 10:41.319
person doesn't get any pain himself he

10:39.399 --> 10:44.380
gives pain to others he's very sarcastic

10:41.319 --> 10:47.380
he's very aggressive he troubles others

10:44.380 --> 10:49.209
but the left-sided people have pains

10:47.380 --> 10:50.620
themselves they get being here and a

10:49.209 --> 10:52.750
pain there and pain here

10:50.620 --> 10:55.060
so left side is to be cleared as you

10:52.750 --> 10:57.040
know very well through the light light

10:55.060 --> 10:58.569
is put before the photograph left hand

10:57.040 --> 11:03.579
towards the photograph right hand on the

10:58.569 --> 11:05.470
mother earth so the left hand gets the

11:03.579 --> 11:08.920
light and the light passes through and

11:05.470 --> 11:09.880
the negativity of the left side passes

11:08.920 --> 11:12.309
through the right hand and the right

11:09.880 --> 11:15.520
hand is on the mother earth the mother

11:12.309 --> 11:18.460
earth is the one who sucks in all the

11:15.520 --> 11:20.200
negative forces of the left-hand side so

11:18.460 --> 11:21.970
these are the two sides which we clear

11:20.200 --> 11:23.590
but once you have cleared these two

11:21.970 --> 11:25.720
sides then you can use the photograph

11:23.590 --> 11:28.180
sit with your both the hands towards the

11:25.720 --> 11:31.170
photograph and put both the feet in the

11:28.180 --> 11:34.650
water a little bit of salt in it and

11:31.170 --> 11:37.870
about five ten minutes you must allow

11:34.650 --> 11:41.350
vibrations to clear you out then wipe

11:37.870 --> 11:43.750
your feet put the water properly into

11:41.350 --> 11:48.730
some disposal and then sit down for

11:43.750 --> 11:51.390
meditation if you can do that every day

11:48.730 --> 11:54.940
even ten minutes is more than sufficient

11:51.390 --> 11:57.430
don't have to do anything in an extreme

11:54.940 --> 11:59.230
manner in the morning time you have to

11:57.430 --> 12:01.780
give yourself abundant when you are

11:59.230 --> 12:05.920
going out don't go out without giving a

12:01.780 --> 12:06.430
button and attention should be all the

12:05.920 --> 12:08.860
time

12:06.430 --> 12:10.870
inside in the sense that walking on the

12:08.860 --> 12:13.300
road people have habit of seeing these

12:10.870 --> 12:15.640
in that sing like that the attention

12:13.300 --> 12:17.740
gets returned away what you should do is

12:15.640 --> 12:20.380
to see about three feet or 4 feet at the

12:17.740 --> 12:22.060
most on the ground and not about because

12:20.380 --> 12:25.420
you can see are the beautiful children

12:22.060 --> 12:28.600
flowers everything there's nothing very

12:25.420 --> 12:31.360
beautiful about that so better is to see

12:28.600 --> 12:33.400
only up three four feet if possible to

12:31.360 --> 12:36.670
fix your attention so the attention

12:33.400 --> 12:39.700
becomes concentrated and you feel very

12:36.670 --> 12:42.490
relaxed and relieved of too much of

12:39.700 --> 12:45.880
wobbling of your eyes eyes are very

12:42.490 --> 12:47.290
important very important and as you will

12:45.880 --> 12:50.350
notice because you are all realized

12:47.290 --> 12:52.960
souls that your eyes now have got a

12:50.350 --> 12:55.540
gaint a kind of a light in the eye and

12:52.960 --> 12:58.660
that light shows that you are a light

12:55.540 --> 13:01.230
source so best thing is that you should

12:58.660 --> 13:01.230
try to

13:04.670 --> 13:15.079
you should try to put your attention

13:10.850 --> 13:17.449
within yourself to see for yourself how

13:15.079 --> 13:21.139
far you have grown through your

13:17.449 --> 13:24.230
vibrations know yourself what is

13:21.139 --> 13:28.549
required in you first and foremost thing

13:24.230 --> 13:32.749
the light has to be clean then see how

13:28.549 --> 13:36.589
far you can reach your mind how far you

13:32.749 --> 13:40.790
can increase your dimension how far you

13:36.589 --> 13:45.170
can go with others I hope this little

13:40.790 --> 13:49.670
small little explanation about your

13:45.170 --> 13:52.610
meditation and your method of rising and

13:49.670 --> 13:54.589
ascending will help you to grow further

13:52.610 --> 13:56.290
but I don't mind if you have any

13:54.589 --> 13:58.309
questions I would like to answer them

13:56.290 --> 14:02.529
may God bless you

13:58.309 --> 14:02.529
may God bless you may God bless

14:34.779 --> 14:41.740
see you must raise your Kundalini try to

14:39.370 --> 14:45.279
raise it put your attention to your

14:41.740 --> 14:47.290
sister say mother come in my head as

14:45.279 --> 14:49.839
soon as kundalini crosses da guia you

14:47.290 --> 14:56.019
cannot have those thoughts you should

14:49.839 --> 14:58.269
allow this simple method also that if

14:56.019 --> 15:01.870
you see any thought coming in you should

14:58.269 --> 15:06.449
say I forgive I forgive is a very big

15:01.870 --> 15:06.449
mantra see that taught me strong

15:55.050 --> 16:17.910
what happens what happens it has an

16:11.010 --> 16:19.350
effect all right it has anything but

16:17.910 --> 16:22.110
after that I think you all should go

16:19.350 --> 16:23.700

16:22.110 --> 16:27.300

16:27.300 --> 16:32.460
are not to be understood by your brains

16:29.100 --> 16:34.590
but through your Kundalini and through

16:32.460 --> 16:36.810
your heart so it's doesn't matter if you

16:34.590 --> 16:38.400
