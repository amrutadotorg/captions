00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.190
now of course it is also true the second

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.970
point is that in sahaja yoga you have to

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.130
become you cannot just say that all

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.170
right I am become a sahaja yogi no you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.900
cannot nor can you say I'm following

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.489
Shri Mataji that also cannot be said nor

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.559
you can say that all right we have an

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.540
organization or something like that or

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.520
I'm wearing this just because she's my

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.489
guru you can't say that I have to become

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.040
you have to become a sahaja yogi if you

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:49.019
have to become a sahaja yogi then it has

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:53.640
to be worked out and that takes time to

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.800
rise from near each other to miracle

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.870
might take style for some people it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.330
takes more time for some people it takes

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.979
less time depends on the preparation of

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.140
a person also I would say previous lives

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.390
good deeds and this lives understanding

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.760
so many things are there so it takes

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.270
time but at least one can talk about it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.539
so that mas fear is created you can talk

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.899
to people tell them that we have found

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:27.780
the truth and it's very simple you can't

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.840
pay for it it just works it's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.240
spontaneous it's a living process it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.109
an evolutionary process you can talk

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.780
like that not about me but about sahaja

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:43.070
yoga in an abstract manner it's such a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.780
wonderful thing one should do it all

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.590
such talks are going to help us a lot

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.979
though I would say those who listen to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.200
you may not get realization but at least

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.420
in that posture it will be and that is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.009
going to help us a lot if it is in the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.429
atmosphere people know that there is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.380
something like this coming up for you

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.399
people of course you have to work hard

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.600
and you have to become sahaja Yogi's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:15.120
becoming is a little bit difficult to us

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.170
sometimes because there's this great

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.620
mystery ego

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.290
or maybe certain conditionings you see

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.190
that people can't give up and that they

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.190
find it difficult

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.099
get out but if you know how to raise

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.110
your Kundalini she will manage it she

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.959
knows how to do it and she will give you

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.739
that status but first and foremost thing

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.360
is to meditate and to raise your body

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.040
meditation is the only way you can grow

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.160
there's no other way out

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.349
because when you meditate you are in

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.280
silence you are in thoughtless awareness

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.420
then the growth of awareness takes place

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.250
then it opens up but if you are thinking

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.910
supposing there's a lake and the lake is

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.360
completely in a turmoil nothing can grow

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.370
but supposing it is silent then notices

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.420
can grow anything can grow in it in the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:17.819
same way if your mind is agitated and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:22.440
your growth is not yet fully expressing

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:25.500
itself then it's such a vicious circle

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.989
that you are agitated

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.720
and your growth is hindered again you

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.650
are agitated your growth isn't there so

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:38.220
the best way is to take to meditation

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.980
when you take to meditation this turmoil

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.310
will settle down and ready to settle

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.680
down

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.079
your growth will take place after

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.090
meditation will feel definitely that you

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.370
have come out very well you know grow

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.190
very well but for that one has to be

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.019
very honest you cannot force people to

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.030
be honest that's one thing you can't do

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.639
you have to be honest yourself you are

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.500
not to be hypocrite you have to see for

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.319
yourself that whatever you are doing is

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.319
for your benevolence it's for your good

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.560
and that you have to do it because it is

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.690
good for you to begin with and then for

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.370
the good of the humanity you are doing

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.320
for the good of the humanity

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.570
now some people who come for the first

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.970
time we will have lots of doubts because

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.910
of ego they have lots of doubts because

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.770
of ego how can that be how can this be

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.270
how I mean all kinds of things they ask

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.320
now you have to say that first of all

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.599
you develop your inside you develop your

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.849
enlightenment your light is not

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.720
sufficient in the light only there are

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:43.460
no doubt

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.400
supposing in darkness you think that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.960
this table has no cover it's alright you

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.550
can think whatever you like but when

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.169
there's light you see for yourself there

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.699
is a beautiful cover on top of this

00:04:52.169 --> 00:05:00.569
table in the same way it happens to us

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:04.409
that we have to achieve a state and as

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:06.150
we achieve that state then there's no

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.180
question there's no doubt there's

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.330
nothing and you become so empowered it

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.120
is such a simultaneous thing it works as

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.569
soon as you achieve something it works

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.110
when it works then you are convinced

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:24.990
it's so I'd say it was a very beautiful

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.190
new chain starts within yourself

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:33.029
and then you really starts enjoying your

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:35.129
joy of yourself now it is for your gain

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.860
you have come to sahaja yoga not for

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.469
anybody else's gain first of all your

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.020
gain and once you gain something then

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:46.680
you can only help others to do something

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.050
about it so it is important to

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.479
understand the first rule of sahaja Yoga

00:05:49.050 --> 00:06:00.569
is that you look at yourself how are you

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:02.310
really progressing or you are worried

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.389
about other thing like your business

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:09.349
thing is that all you are worried about

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:13.259
your asset what are you worried about

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:14.729
are you worried about your ascent if you

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.669
are worried about your ascent what are

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:20.400
you doing about it that has to be the

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.819
main object of life the rest of the

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.000
things followed once you are saying the

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:29.729
whole cosmos can look after your

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.770
problems but you must ascend into the

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.560
kingdom of God that's the main point is

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:41.039
so first of all you have to ascertain

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:45.089
about yourself am i ascending am i

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:46.069
transforming am i giving up all my bad

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:49.039
habits

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:51.580
am i getting rid of my temper

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:55.880
am I getting peaceful

00:06:51.580 --> 00:07:01.390
am I now sweet or am I now still the

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:04.220
same horrible criticized er of others

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.320
just put your attention to yourself and

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.560
see for yourself it's like a mirror you

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.750
start seeing yourself in the mirror

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.930
what's wrong with you and then you try

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:18.290
to correct it now second point is that

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:21.200
you must see your vibrations what

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.700
centers you're catching yourself for

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.370
that you have to give yourself up on

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.530
that you give yourself abandon and see

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.450
for yourself what's wrong with you

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.880
when you give yourself up and then you

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.970
will know about your chakras and you'll

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.980
be amazed so that is how first pay

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.000
attention to yourself you find out

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.190
what's wrong with you

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.530
some of you might be having terrible -

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.780
ego then maybe you might be having a

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.640
very bad I'll getcha then you should

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.070
find out how we got wrong ketchup

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.810
this is equal then there's a very good

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.240
remedy in sahaja yoga which may look

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.220
ridiculous but it's very good remedy is

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.900
to beat yourself you choose as they know

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:04.400
it's the meeting with the shoes is

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:07.820
called as a shoe treatment now then you

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:11.060
have to go further see you find yourself

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:13.100
that your right side is hot what you do

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:16.280
is to put your right side towards the

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:20.690
photograph and left side up towards the

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:23.990
ether the ether takes away the heat but

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:26.780
what actually happens is that your right

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:30.470
side gets the vibration and the heat is

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:34.789
pushed towards your left and passes out

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:37.010
into theta now this heat comes from too

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:39.050
much futuristic living those people who

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.990
are too much futuristic they have too

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:44.600
much heat and too much heat has to go

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:47.710
away and when this heat starts going

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:50.150
away then you are amazed how it works

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.250
for that there are various things we

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:55.310
have to use but mainly for right-sided

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.160
people they should not use any light at

00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.410
all they should not sit in the Sun they

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.990
should sit in the moon right they should

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:04.329
read some poetry they should not die

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:07.569
what

00:09:04.329 --> 00:09:13.029
they should not look at time they should

00:09:07.569 --> 00:09:15.579
allow the time to pass and they should

00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:18.339
just become very sort of emotional

00:09:15.579 --> 00:09:20.829
people they should sing songs of bhakti

00:09:18.339 --> 00:09:22.600
they should not do hot yoga there's so

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:26.680
many things they should not do if their

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:30.000
right side you'd be surprised how people

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:33.339
have been helped through this kind of a

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.250
treatment which treats one side of your

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:40.649
being the left-hand side people are the

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:45.430
people as you know are the ones who are

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:50.290
those I who bear up lots of things from

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:55.839
others cry and weep and all the time on

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:58.600
the loser send such people have problems

00:09:55.839 --> 00:10:01.000
also because all their organs are

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:04.829
lethargy and they have problems of a

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.959
guitar cheek heart the target liver

00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:11.709
lethargic intestines everything becomes

00:10:07.959 --> 00:10:14.889
very lethargic all these left-side

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:16.779
things can be cured plus they might have

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:19.000
some sort of a bother in them in the

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:20.709
sense they are possessed by someone of

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.050
course some of them are possessed by

00:10:20.709 --> 00:10:25.000
right side also not that only the left

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:28.630
side is possessed but from the right

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.930
side also they're possessed and left

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:33.699
sided positions are of a peculiar type

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.910
because they give you pain in the body

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:39.399
you get pains in the body right-sided

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.319
person doesn't get any pain himself he

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:44.380
gives pain to others he's very sarcastic

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:47.380
he's very aggressive he troubles others

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.209
but the left-sided people have pains

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.620
themselves they get being here and a

00:10:49.209 --> 00:10:52.750
pain there and pain here

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.060
so left side is to be cleared as you

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.040
know very well through the light light

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.569
is put before the photograph left hand

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.579
towards the photograph right hand on the

00:10:58.569 --> 00:11:05.470
mother earth so the left hand gets the

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:08.920
light and the light passes through and

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.880
the negativity of the left side passes

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.309
through the right hand and the right

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.520
hand is on the mother earth the mother

00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:18.460
earth is the one who sucks in all the

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.200
negative forces of the left-hand side so

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.970
these are the two sides which we clear

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.590
but once you have cleared these two

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.720
sides then you can use the photograph

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.180
sit with your both the hands towards the

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.170
photograph and put both the feet in the

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:34.650
water a little bit of salt in it and

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:37.870
about five ten minutes you must allow

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:41.350
vibrations to clear you out then wipe

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:43.750
your feet put the water properly into

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:48.730
some disposal and then sit down for

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:51.390
meditation if you can do that every day

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:54.940
even ten minutes is more than sufficient

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:57.430
don't have to do anything in an extreme

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.230
manner in the morning time you have to

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.780
give yourself abundant when you are

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:05.920
going out don't go out without giving a

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.430
button and attention should be all the

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.860
time

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.870
inside in the sense that walking on the

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.300
road people have habit of seeing these

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.640
in that sing like that the attention

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.740
gets returned away what you should do is

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.380
to see about three feet or 4 feet at the

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.060
most on the ground and not about because

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.420
you can see are the beautiful children

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:28.600
flowers everything there's nothing very

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:31.360
beautiful about that so better is to see

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.400
only up three four feet if possible to

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.670
fix your attention so the attention

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:39.700
becomes concentrated and you feel very

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:42.490
relaxed and relieved of too much of

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:45.880
wobbling of your eyes eyes are very

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.290
important very important and as you will

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.350
notice because you are all realized

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.960
souls that your eyes now have got a

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:55.540
gaint a kind of a light in the eye and

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.660
that light shows that you are a light

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:01.230
source so best thing is that you should

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.230
try to

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:15.079
you should try to put your attention

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:17.449
within yourself to see for yourself how

00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:21.139
far you have grown through your

00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:24.230
vibrations know yourself what is

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:28.549
required in you first and foremost thing

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:32.749
the light has to be clean then see how

00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:36.589
far you can reach your mind how far you

00:13:32.749 --> 00:13:40.790
can increase your dimension how far you

00:13:36.589 --> 00:13:45.170
can go with others I hope this little

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:49.670
small little explanation about your

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:52.610
meditation and your method of rising and

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.589
ascending will help you to grow further

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.290
but I don't mind if you have any

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:58.309
questions I would like to answer them

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:02.529
may God bless you

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:02.529
may God bless you may God bless

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:41.740
see you must raise your Kundalini try to

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:45.279
raise it put your attention to your

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:47.290
sister say mother come in my head as

00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:49.839
soon as kundalini crosses da guia you

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:56.019
cannot have those thoughts you should

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:58.269
allow this simple method also that if

00:14:56.019 --> 00:15:01.870
you see any thought coming in you should

00:14:58.269 --> 00:15:06.449
say I forgive I forgive is a very big

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:06.449
mantra see that taught me strong

00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:17.910
what happens what happens it has an

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:19.350
effect all right it has anything but

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.110
after that I think you all should go

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.700
into meditation for a while after

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:27.300
listening to my lecture you just going

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:29.100
to my meditation actually my lectures

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.460
are not to be understood by your brains

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:34.590
but through your Kundalini and through

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.810
your heart so it's doesn't matter if you

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.400
don't remember something sorry I did so

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.140

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:49.410
it but it will come handy whenever you

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:51.330
want to use some words so sentence it

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:59.160
