00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:05.359
Interviewer: Today in Turkey is Turkey’s
National Sovereignty and Children’s Day.

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:06.121
I know.

00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:09.203
Interviewer: And national holiday.
Do you have a message for Turkey on this day?

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.912
Oh my God, I was so many happy about it.

00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:14.644
See what they don’t understand

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:18.322
that what we are doing will have an effect on our children

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:21.351
are we creating hell for them?

00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:22.719
Interviewer: We should have not, Mother.

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:26.086
That’s it. We must think from
the children’s point of you.

00:00:26.111 --> 00:00:27.906
What are we giving them?

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:29.972
And today is a great day because

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.268
I myself I feel that we are
really exploiting our children.

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:36.146
We don’t think about them

00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:39.449
and the way we are mad after our own

00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:41.364
they are maniac I must say.

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:43.028
The way they are going on.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.955
But what are you going to give to a children?

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.615
You have to give them peace.

00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:48.662
You have to give them joy.

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:50.396
Are you doing that?

00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:53.296
This is only who these elderly people,

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:55.200
they have lost their exciting

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:56.632
who are caring everyone.

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:58.325
You just think of your children

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.041
they should have a very peaceful,
beautiful, joyous country

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.073
isn’t it? That should be them

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.877
Interviewer: [UNCLEAR] Mother, yes it should.

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.490
These all journey are not going to live forever

00:01:08.507 --> 00:01:09.573
Interviewer: No

00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:12.286
This is very true, Mother.

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:19.930
Mother, you had been awarded
several prices for peace

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:22.840
including, if I’m not wrong, the UN peace medal.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:23.610
Peace?

00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:24.945
Interviewer: The peace medal.

00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:27.542
I don’t know how many I have had, My God.

00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:29.988
See I don’t care for all award all that.

00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:35.183
And recently they give one in India.
It’s called as Jewel of Humanity,

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:37.951
All kind of. I told them I don’t want it,

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:40.809
I will not go to Bombay so
they came to Pune to give me.

00:01:41.098 --> 00:01:44.138
But you see these awards and all that are

00:01:44.163 --> 00:01:46.427
for me have no value.

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:49.403
Because so many get it, so many are getting it.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:52.844
I what I don’t want any certificate from any one, I said.

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:54.066
I don’t need it.

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:56.822
But they want to give.

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:59.881
And some don’t want to give also.i There are some

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:01.526
who don’t want to give, because

00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:03.591
say I’m not a Catholic,

00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:05.776
so some people won’t give me.

00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:10.201
Because I’m not a Christian,

00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:11.577
they won’t give me.

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:13.389
It’s like that, stupid.

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:15.661
You see I’m I’m none of these

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:19.592
and they do not judge me on merits

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.993
If they judge me on merits these
awards has some meaning

00:02:23.056 --> 00:02:24.448
but they don’t.

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:26.036
Interviewer: I see Mother.

00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:29.633
What activities does Sahaja Yoga do worldwide

00:02:29.658 --> 00:02:34.248
to promote peace and protection of children for example?

00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:38.689
First and for most thing that
we are trying to transform human beings

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.638
to higher level of awareness.

00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:44.323
By that you see so many things drop out.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:48.732
For example, your addiction to things like drugs

00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:50.909
and all that they are drops out.

00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:53.330
Then so many diseases are cured

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.992
and the person becomes very
beautiful independent personality

00:02:57.997 --> 00:03:00.513
and collectively conscious, you see.

00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:05.819
So such a such a group of people
we can call such a society

00:03:05.844 --> 00:03:10.807
which is of enlighten people can change
the whole world tomorrow.

00:03:11.803 --> 00:03:15.400
Interviewer: Mother, How does a person

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:18.642
obtain this this enlightenment,

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:21.875
this self-realization as a very goal?

00:03:21.907 --> 00:03:24.434
You see, that  two things about it

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.615
that there are now very
many seekers of truth

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.848
all over the world I’ve seen whether
they are black, white, yellow anything.

00:03:33.873 --> 00:03:36.215
They are all seekers of truth.

00:03:36.243 --> 00:03:40.023
And what happens that
they have a power within them.

00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:44.026
Everyone has in the triangular
bone called as kundalini.

00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:45.855
You can call it by any name.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.937
And which rises and gives
this connection with the divine.

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:54.308
It’s very very simple thing that works out.

00:03:54.324 --> 00:03:57.881
But because the time is there, this is the time,

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.917
also because they are seekers,

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:03.879
because they are so genuine  that’s all related.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.387
Interviewer: When this
kundalini energy rises

00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:12.405
what are its effects on people

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.060
and how does a person know that this energy is active?

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.816
[UNCLEAR]  get a complete transformation, you see.

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:21.731
depends on how much you perfect it.

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:26.551
But firstly as we say there are six enemies human beings have.

00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:31.382
And these six enemies are like anger

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:38.826
and what you can call the perversion in sex habits

00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:46.262
then it is also greed for corruption

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:50.412
then also you have got attachments.

00:04:50.437 --> 00:04:53.280
You see they will become dishonest

00:04:53.312 --> 00:04:56.527
because without  there some has to be  [UNCLEAR].

00:04:56.551 --> 00:04:59.239
All this kind of identifications are there.

00:04:59.264 --> 00:05:05.053
And also pride like we are something great all this.

00:05:05.078 --> 00:05:06.078
It is ego problem.

00:05:06.103 --> 00:05:07.674
Interviewer: Like the seven deadly sins.

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:11.581
Like the English say “the seven deadly sins”.

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.720
Pride,  avarice, sloth, lust.

00:05:15.737 --> 00:05:18.057
English have but now that  coming down.

00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:18.780
Interviewer: English have.

00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:20.216
Everywhere has to come around.

00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:23.506
Every action has a reaction and they are realizing it.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.017
Now imagine, they have left our country

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.104
without doing anything about it.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:30.051
How did they manage?

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.748
So they also care for the world reputation.

00:05:35.717 --> 00:05:39.258
And things are changing I agree with you
they are very much.

00:05:39.282 --> 00:05:43.366
It is a small country and they thought,
they’ve achieved a lot and all that

00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:45.998
but this is [UNCLEAR].

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:50.447
Interviewer: Mother, is Sahaja Yoga like

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:53.241
Sufiism, Islamic Spiritualism?

00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.388
It’s not ism. That is the different between the two.

00:05:56.397 --> 00:05:59.695
Anybody can call himself a Sufi like this gentlemen who came.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.355
He call himself a Sufi but he was just argumentative

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.303
and he said the worldly so bad this that.

00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.352
But he didn’t know what to say about himself, you see.

00:06:09.377 --> 00:06:11.963
So it’s not an ism. It is a ...

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:15.788
Ism means a kind of a, we can say

00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:23.546
a kind of theory or could be a
kind of a group believes in something.

00:06:23.564 --> 00:06:25.204
It is not like that.

00:06:25.443 --> 00:06:27.968
Sahaja Yoga is makes you Sufi.

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:30.814
Sufi means cleans nirmal.

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:33.862
It means it makes you cleanses you.

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:37.358
It cleanses you and you get rid of these horrible things

00:06:37.383 --> 00:06:40.191
and you become a transform personality.

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:43.046
and you become a transform personality.

00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:46.155
an evil nature in man called nefis

00:06:46.166 --> 00:06:48.713
and by disciplining this nefis

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.479
we or the Sufi attains a link  code a  collective consciousness.

00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:54.870
That is a wrong idea.

00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:58.484
Most of the Sufis did know how they became Sufi.

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.343
They were born like that.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.361
And the others who talk about it is like Tao

00:07:03.386 --> 00:07:06.056
who you must heard about Chinese thing, Tao.

00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:08.894
When they describe a sage,

00:07:08.963 --> 00:07:11.015
the sage is like this, sage is like that.

00:07:11.024 --> 00:07:14.689
But how how does he become like that?

00:07:14.707 --> 00:07:18.292
So that part is missing even in the Sufi theories.

00:07:18.317 --> 00:07:19.858
How you become a Sufi?

00:07:19.883 --> 00:07:22.271
Just going round and round you don’t become,

00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:25.160
by falling a certain code of life you don’t become.

00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:29.004
What? Kundalini, that has to rise.

00:07:29.128 --> 00:07:33.019
Interviewer: So where other forms
of mysticism what they try

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:36.580
what they strive to achieve where Sahaja Yoga starts?

00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:37.989
Could you say that?

00:07:38.014 --> 00:07:43.093
They try to achieve by putting pressures
on themselves into

00:07:43.118 --> 00:07:46.636
all kinds of control and all that.

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:47.937
That is not the way.

00:07:47.946 --> 00:07:50.274
You have to be a free person

00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:53.880
with kundalini you become a free person,
you, nobody has to tell you

00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:58.744
don’t do this, just you become.
Becoming is the point.

00:08:03.631 --> 00:08:06.452
Interviewer:  Mother, how does Sahaja Yoga

00:08:06.477 --> 00:08:10.517
or a Sahaja Yogi benefit the society in which he lives?

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:13.369
He creates a new society of his own.

00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:17.992
And then by that others are also are helped.

00:08:18.017 --> 00:08:21.406
Because they see in society where there is no greed,

00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:24.165
there is no fighting,
there is no quarrelling,

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.625
all living together happily and
enjoying each other and understanding.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:33.873
Another thing happens that they start
seeing what is wrong with the your own country.

00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:36.619
What is wrong with your own societies?

00:08:36.633 --> 00:08:39.249
What is wrong with all the religions that are human?

00:08:39.253 --> 00:08:44.983
He just becomes a kind of a person
who sees things.

00:08:45.008 --> 00:08:48.189
So such a society’s form

00:08:48.214 --> 00:08:50.532
and these people influence others.

00:08:50.557 --> 00:08:53.725
That’s how the Sahaja Yoga is spreading so much around.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.589
Because I don’t go everywhere now
they said  destinate this is countries.

00:08:57.625 --> 00:08:59.947
I haven’t physically visit half of them.

00:08:59.981 --> 00:09:02.767
But what happens that one person, who gets it,

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:04.483
goes and gives to another.

00:09:04.488 --> 00:09:08.961
Because it is the truth, you see, it works.

00:09:09.403 --> 00:09:12.759
Interviewer: It is amazing.

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:18.389
Turkey is located in the middle of several foretime  regions,

00:09:18.414 --> 00:09:22.243
for example Balkans, Caucasus, the Middle East,

00:09:22.268 --> 00:09:26.084
with its present complect Israel and Palestine.

00:09:26.109 --> 00:09:31.093
Can Turkey and or Turkish yogis play a role

00:09:31.118 --> 00:09:33.746
in bringing peace to these regions?

00:09:33.795 --> 00:09:37.058
Of course, of course, why not, of course.

00:09:39.434 --> 00:09:42.094
Turkey has one very great blessing;

00:09:42.289 --> 00:09:45.160
it had so many Sufis here.

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:49.044
And if you read them,
it’s a description of Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:53.580
They were all Sahaja Yogis.
They didn’t call them Sahaja Yogis but they were.

00:09:53.608 --> 00:09:57.953
Because they are describe to be like this,
describe to be like that.

00:09:57.977 --> 00:10:02.758
And when they tell about their own
experiences and all that, in poetry,

00:10:02.783 --> 00:10:06.884
you are amaze to see, they are talking
like Sahaja Yogis only.

00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:09.820
That is the reason; because of that blessing

00:10:09.845 --> 00:10:13.132
Turkey has become very important for me also.

00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:16.681
That spirituality will definitely take a shape here.

00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:20.751
And maybe I’ve always feel that Islam

00:10:20.778 --> 00:10:24.107
could be really shown in Turkey very well.

00:10:24.132 --> 00:10:28.696
And maybe that it will help people to
correct their ideas about Islam.

00:10:32.906 --> 00:10:36.015
Interviewer: Mother, speaking of Islam,

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.129
the actions by the Afghan government

00:10:39.154 --> 00:10:42.424
by destroying the statue of Buddha.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:48.136
How did this, what was Indian’s reaction,
what is Sahaji’s reaction?

00:10:48.686 --> 00:10:52.352
You see, for us I mean, they have been
a curse all through out.

00:10:52.397 --> 00:10:57.112
Because for India, you see, India respects
everything, all the religion,

00:10:57.136 --> 00:11:02.026
thus the only country which respects all the religions

00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:05.263
in a same manner.

00:11:05.287 --> 00:11:09.905
So to them it was a shock because
it is very historical thing that

00:11:09.967 --> 00:11:14.059
when Alexander came to Afghanistan,

00:11:14.562 --> 00:11:16.963
this artist saw the beautiful

00:11:16.988 --> 00:11:20.214
surrendering’s they had and
beautiful mountains they had.

00:11:20.243 --> 00:11:23.862
And they said we can teach you how to hone the

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.305
hone the rocks.

00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:28.246
They taught them there.

00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:31.100
So Indians were so grateful to them for that.

00:11:31.125 --> 00:11:33.386
And even they went to this limit to say that

00:11:33.396 --> 00:11:37.194
it is only they have taught us otherwise
we didn’t know how to hone the rocks.

00:11:37.219 --> 00:11:41.460
They have done so much work like we have got hone [UNCLEAR].

00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:44.911
But then they found one lady called Yakshini

00:11:45.057 --> 00:11:47.356
who was  cowed out

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.827
that flouted that whole idea.

00:11:50.852 --> 00:11:53.427
So the Indians knew how to hone the rock

00:11:53.445 --> 00:11:54.649
but they didn’t want.

00:11:54.674 --> 00:11:57.145
Because it’s would be in the rock all the time

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.679
but why not do something that can go to houses and house.

00:12:00.699 --> 00:12:03.218
So then that idea was gone

00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:05.615
that is only the Greek start this, doesn’t matter

00:12:05.654 --> 00:12:07.373
who say what  serve or teach us.

00:12:07.398 --> 00:12:10.587
I mean they are very very well-known structures

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:13.370
and we all respect it very much, no doubt.

00:12:13.455 --> 00:12:17.439
Not because Buddhist or anything as a piece of art also.

00:12:17.748 --> 00:12:21.463
But this people have no sense left in their heads.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.183
They believe only in destruction.

00:12:24.256 --> 00:12:28.127
Now by destroying that do you think Islam will spread?

00:12:28.853 --> 00:12:30.722
What will  let you out of it?

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:33.290
Otherwise that was the place people used to visit,

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:36.488
they used to have tourist all this is finished now.

00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:38.785
That is the only glorifying thing they have.

00:12:38.812 --> 00:12:40.387
What else they have.

00:12:40.412 --> 00:12:42.183
They don’t have Taj Mahal.

00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:45.151
They don’t have anyone of old temples, nothing.

00:12:45.152 --> 00:12:47.310
They had only those statues.

00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:50.694
They had also [UNCLEAR], they don’t know what was there

00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:56.712
[UNCLEAR] no words you can call it,
their inheritance, greatest.

00:12:57.149 --> 00:12:59.680
Many people went to see that.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.655
I also in my relation many people went to see

00:13:02.682 --> 00:13:05.651
those state as we go to see Egypt.

00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:09.973
So they have lost at now. What they are
there going to see all the dead bodies.

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:12.340
Interviewer: [UNCLEAR] this is trouble, Mother

00:13:12.358 --> 00:13:14.333
I don’t know.

00:13:17.382 --> 00:13:21.151
Some sort of an idea they have about Islam.

00:13:23.325 --> 00:13:26.858
Interviewer: Mother, it has been
a very very great pleasure,

00:13:26.903 --> 00:13:32.038
asking these questions and listening
to your enlightened views.

00:13:32.287 --> 00:13:35.863
I sincerely hope that I get the pleasure

00:13:35.888 --> 00:13:39.450
to on the blessing to interview you again future someday.

00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:40.502
If I?

00:13:40.551 --> 00:13:45.466
Interviewer:  I say that again. I sincerely hope that

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:50.371
I have for I have given the blessing to
interview you again in the future someday.

00:13:50.393 --> 00:13:52.058
Of course, any time.

00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:52.911
Interviewer: It is such an honour, Mother.

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:55.169
You are a very good interviewer, I must say,

00:13:55.194 --> 00:13:57.645
because in England, I have had horrible ones.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.809
So when you said I am English, I was little frightened.

00:14:02.646 --> 00:14:04.744
Interviewer: It must be the effect of Turkey.

00:14:04.769 --> 00:14:08.576
I think its Scottish are better people definitely.

00:14:08.618 --> 00:14:11.678
One interviewer came long time back

00:14:11.822 --> 00:14:15.216
and he started ask me funny question.

00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:19.295
First of all he said why are you here in this country?

00:14:19.322 --> 00:14:22.570
I said I’ve come because my husband
has got an appointment;

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:24.431
I’ve come with him, all right.

00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:29.075
But I said I can also ask why did you go to India?

00:14:31.762 --> 00:14:33.076
He was quite.

00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:37.287
Then he asked me another question is that

00:14:37.312 --> 00:14:39.684
what about your population,

00:14:39.709 --> 00:14:42.627
why don’t you go and do
something about your population.

00:14:42.645 --> 00:14:45.244
Why is it this so much population in India?

00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:50.509
See I am sorry but if I tell you something,
I hope you won’t feel hurt.

00:14:50.525 --> 00:14:52.482
He says yes tell me why.

00:14:52.507 --> 00:14:55.690
See the reason is I read the other day in the newspaper.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.934
Then in London city itself,

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:03.257
every week two children are killed by their parents.

00:15:04.707 --> 00:15:07.326
He said really.
Yes I’ve got that.

00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:11.538
So what child would like to be born in this country

00:15:11.573 --> 00:15:13.754
where they can be killed by the parents?

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.648
He was quite shocked at it.

00:15:19.811 --> 00:15:23.285
So the children are also going to India

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.080
and taking birth because there are
people who love their children.

00:15:27.105 --> 00:15:30.962
So they want to be born in India
what can we do about it.

00:15:30.987 --> 00:15:36.213
Then second question he asked me
was very funny about

00:15:36.878 --> 00:15:40.864
that why are you so poor in your country?

00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:44.324
I said that true is. Don’t you think you are responsible?

00:15:44.332 --> 00:15:47.379
He said how, I said 300 years

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.461
without taking any visa or anything you went there

00:15:50.461 --> 00:15:55.897
and for three Indians who lived there looted us
then what will happen.

00:15:56.495 --> 00:15:59.132
What will next the net result of the whole thing?

00:15:59.164 --> 00:16:01.730
We were one of the richest country once upon a time.

00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:05.411
But new people looted us, what to do.

00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:07.848
Interviewer: Right Shri Mother

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.523
Then he came quite.

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:13.014
Interviewer: Mother, while I’ve thought,
just came to my mind.

00:16:14.053 --> 00:16:18.039
I was reading some of the Turkish newspapers,

00:16:18.135 --> 00:16:23.895
after all it is part of my job and
an interview by the Sabah newspaper

00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:27.780
infect that headline said it was greed that

00:16:27.807 --> 00:16:31.002
destroyed you, greed that took you down.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.307
I believe that was what you told reporters
about Turkey’s economic crisis.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.262
Ya it is true.

00:16:38.281 --> 00:16:43.125
See the question is they are such artist,

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.023
some beautiful artist they are you know.

00:16:46.057 --> 00:16:49.425
They make nice things out of nothing.

00:16:49.447 --> 00:16:53.357
So I don’t know why they wanted to get after money

00:16:53.382 --> 00:16:56.088
and ruin their own country.

00:16:56.165 --> 00:17:00.245
You see art that they have, is sufficient to give them

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.729
all the blessings of Lakshmi.

00:17:02.835 --> 00:17:05.640
But they are not, they are not satisfied.

00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:08.962
They want to make the modern style of money.

00:17:09.102 --> 00:17:13.622
In that you get lost. You tell lies,
you do cheat, you do everything.

00:17:13.695 --> 00:17:15.988
But as far as art is concern

00:17:16.013 --> 00:17:18.296
you have producing something great.

00:17:18.311 --> 00:17:20.612
And that is the real welcome this kind.

00:17:20.618 --> 00:17:22.926
But one should be satisfied within.

00:17:22.951 --> 00:17:24.785
The thing is if you want to have,

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:30.021
say Rockefeller things then you can’t.

00:17:30.026 --> 00:17:32.460
You cannot enjoy that.

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:36.098
What we are having now in America the decision big one..

00:17:36.132 --> 00:17:39.762
And everybody is passing through that decision  [UNCLEAR].

00:17:39.802 --> 00:17:42.262
But art cannot have decision.

00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:45.104
So they should have taken to their

00:17:45.122 --> 00:17:49.437
own knowledge of art to all love of art.

00:17:49.462 --> 00:17:51.930
And they would have been perfectly all right.

00:17:51.955 --> 00:17:54.977
But they don’t understand their own nature.

00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:59.437
And running, everybody is trying to become
American, I know even in India.

00:18:00.098 --> 00:18:03.788
Interviewer: Mother, have you travelled
anywhere else in Turkey apart from Istanbul?

00:18:03.813 --> 00:18:05.295
Not so.

00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:08.670
I would love to.
This time I have gave four days for that.

00:18:08.695 --> 00:18:11.498
I want to go to different places, see,

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:14.270
I haven’t. You see. I am so busy when I am here

00:18:14.295 --> 00:18:15.899
and then I just disappear.

00:18:15.924 --> 00:18:18.834
But I would, this time I have been selfish.

00:18:19.893 --> 00:18:21.833
Interviewer: Mother, would you like to see Konya?

00:18:22.389 --> 00:18:24.861
Interviewer: Would you like to see Konya, the home of Mevlana?

00:18:24.886 --> 00:18:26.830
I don’t know what programs they have.

00:18:26.855 --> 00:18:30.983
Because they said Mother had [UNCLEAR] gives us four days for that

00:18:30.989 --> 00:18:33.720
so I don’t know what is their program whatever it is.

00:18:33.747 --> 00:18:35.447
I would love to do that.

00:18:35.474 --> 00:18:36.643
Interviewer: Ok Mother.

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:39.416
I think it is the end of my questions Mother.

00:18:39.441 --> 00:18:40.379
Thank you.

00:18:40.403 --> 00:18:42.530
It is a wonderful country; you can do a lot here.

00:18:42.532 --> 00:18:46.408
I mean such a nice thing even this fellow here Islam,

00:18:46.433 --> 00:18:49.625
Islam, Islam he too became all right.

00:18:50.215 --> 00:18:53.279
Now this people [UNCLEAR] Krishna consciousness

00:18:54.288 --> 00:18:56.336
they spread so much.

00:18:56.474 --> 00:18:59.180
And I was in LA, I don’t know may be that is the reason

00:18:59.204 --> 00:19:01.484
they got so badly exposed.

00:19:01.546 --> 00:19:05.026
That the boy is small children who were there,

00:19:05.051 --> 00:19:08.217
children of the so call,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.098
what to call them?

00:19:13.368 --> 00:19:16.256
SY1: Krishna consciousness.

00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:20.888
So they have come grown up now.
They are adults.

00:19:21.146 --> 00:19:24.488
And they have put a case against the organizers

00:19:24.513 --> 00:19:27.618
that they always used to abuses as children.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.433
And they had to pay for only one center,
I don’t know

00:19:32.116 --> 00:19:34.563
such a lot of money.

00:19:34.635 --> 00:19:38.994
I mean all this nonsense
they started Krishna consciousness this.

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:43.253
In that they didn’t get any consciousness of the spirit.

00:19:43.278 --> 00:19:46.058
How could they do that such a dirty staff?

00:19:46.784 --> 00:19:50.253
And now they are all false it wasn’t down in America.

00:19:50.428 --> 00:19:54.185
Of course [UNCLEAR] gone, that is gone, this is finished.

00:19:54.357 --> 00:19:57.320
But this Krishna consciousness was still going on, I mean.

00:19:57.345 --> 00:20:00.886
What they are doing is to sell books.

00:20:01.406 --> 00:20:02.987
SY1: And make money out of it.

00:20:03.047 --> 00:20:06.322
To make, just making money, make money like that.

00:20:06.675 --> 00:20:09.706
And whole thing is exposed.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:14.552
SY2: Also here Shri Mataji,
now that this desire of people

00:20:14.687 --> 00:20:17.659
becoming spiritually enlightened.

00:20:17.684 --> 00:20:22.483
The desire is misused a lot by
all this wrong knowledge people.

00:20:22.508 --> 00:20:25.386
SY2: They come [UNCLEAR] seminar, all kinds of people.

00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:27.470
Even Deepak Chopra was here.

00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:28.314
Even who?

00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:29.544
SY 1: Deepak Chopra.

00:20:29.569 --> 00:20:31.824
SY 2: Even he came here to give a seminar.

00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:33.737
And you have to pay to go to the seminar.

00:20:33.762 --> 00:20:36.158
He is just making money.
He is just making money.

00:20:36.175 --> 00:20:40.764
SY 2: And, and a lot of these some
people coming I don’t know,

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:43.569
some people are asking me they made this

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:47.905
kind of workshops in hotels and this and that. It is really.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.248
Deepak Chopra is the worst.

00:20:49.273 --> 00:20:50.344
SY 2: I know.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.360
The worst.

00:20:51.385 --> 00:20:52.504
He is making too much money.

00:20:52.529 --> 00:20:54.530
SY 2: I said many others came also. [UNCLEAR]

00:20:54.608 --> 00:20:57.851
He was found in a hotel with a prostituted in America.

00:20:58.296 --> 00:21:01.424
All this thing are there. But you see,

00:21:01.449 --> 00:21:03.923
all that happen, everything happen.

00:21:03.948 --> 00:21:07.653
But people get mesmerize I think.
They never see this.

00:21:08.045 --> 00:21:11.181
They are stupid, is the last judgement.

00:21:11.557 --> 00:21:14.664
At this time stupid will go to stupid.
What can you do?

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.063
Very bad vibrations he has.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.066
But best part is he uses my lectures.

00:21:21.091 --> 00:21:22.091
SY 2: Yes.

00:21:22.264 --> 00:21:25.165
He uses all of your lectures. And I was saying

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.803
somebody must be giving Shri Mataji’s documents to him.

00:21:30.236 --> 00:21:32.688
Doesn’t matter, still he is telling the lying thing.

00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:42.292
SY 3: Shri Mataji, we have a rendezvous
with the bioenergy specialist man.

00:21:42.311 --> 00:21:42.985
Who?

00:21:42.996 --> 00:21:45.315
SY 1: Bioenergy specialist man.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.133
Is he here? All right.

00:21:47.158 --> 00:21:48.711
But Sadhana has gone out or what.

00:21:48.719 --> 00:21:51.547
SY 4: No she is sleeping, resting, she says.

00:21:52.032 --> 00:21:55.084
She is a sleeping person, all right.
You can call him.

00:21:55.101 --> 00:21:56.267
SY 3: Jai Shri Mataji.

00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:58.022
Right Vishuddhi is too much.

00:21:58.047 --> 00:22:00.295
What is the bioenergy business?

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:08.262
SY 1: They are creating energy out of biological things

00:22:08.294 --> 00:22:12.417
like [UNCLEAR], or like,

00:22:12.823 --> 00:22:18.157
or with the wind,
the power of the water.

00:22:18.327 --> 00:22:22.125
SY 2: Basically Shri Mataji, there are the kind of people

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.308
who have who have the knowledge

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:28.763
to vibrate their energies to heal people.

00:22:28.788 --> 00:22:32.243
Bioenergist are supposed to be healist,

00:22:32.268 --> 00:22:34.875
doing what kundalini is doing with the health.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:39.640
Giving vibrations to the areas
where the body is blocked.

00:22:39.777 --> 00:22:43.559
So they some of the my touching, some of the my not touching,

00:22:43.584 --> 00:22:45.227
but by just giving vibrations.

00:22:45.252 --> 00:22:47.047
What he told me is different.

00:22:47.072 --> 00:22:49.716
SY 2: This is what bioenergist do. And then

00:22:49.724 --> 00:22:51.543
they all have different knowledge.

00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:53.982
But most of them are in basically Russian

00:22:54.007 --> 00:22:55.522
based now the one we have around here.

00:22:55.547 --> 00:22:56.245
Russian?

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.769
SY 2: They are teaching this in Russia also.

00:22:58.785 --> 00:23:07.857
And they act as healist on giving
energy to people’s blockages.

00:23:09.101 --> 00:23:11.434
Then he finish.

00:23:12.021 --> 00:23:18.034
Unless and until you have the energy
within yourself you [UNCLEAR].

00:23:20.922 --> 00:23:22.675
Come in, come.

00:23:28.054 --> 00:23:34.853
SY 2: He says he is himself psychologist doctor

00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:39.541
and also he is also in bioenergy and magnetism.

00:23:39.592 --> 00:23:44.475
And he has an institution, a foundation here in Turkey

00:23:44.486 --> 00:23:49.939
to teach people and to heal help people
with the bio energies.

00:23:49.964 --> 00:23:53.705
And then three years ago through Majid,

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:58.061
he has come and touched your feet
and your hands.

00:23:58.086 --> 00:24:01.136
And he felt enlightened.

00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:04.623
So this time he wanted to visit you again

00:24:04.648 --> 00:24:06.650
to sort of get his full,

00:24:06.675 --> 00:24:12.201
to get his enlightenment process going on.

00:24:12.444 --> 00:24:18.255
Yeah but the best to do is to give
realization to people firstly.

00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:21.578
If you give realization to people they will get cured.

00:24:21.596 --> 00:24:28.346
Because that has a power by which you
get connected to the all-pervading power.

00:24:28.394 --> 00:24:33.010
Once you are with then all-pervading
power that looks after you mostly.

00:25:19.882 --> 00:25:24.875
SY 2: He has also. He is trying to do the same kind

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:31.015
of things with their knowledge of using
their energies to help others.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.715
No. But one should be clear cut
about everything, you know.

00:25:33.724 --> 00:25:36.350
Sometimes it can be dangerous.

00:25:36.362 --> 00:25:39.354
If you don’t know the whole knowledge
and you do something,

00:25:39.378 --> 00:25:42.920
he might spoil your health and maybe
does spoil the health of others.

00:26:01.746 --> 00:26:06.015
SY2: He has been doing bioenergy for 18 years.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.917
And he has had his education in India, he says, in Panjab.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.349
What education he had in [UNCLEAR]?

00:26:29.365 --> 00:26:31.793
But you have the complete comprehensive knowledge,

00:26:31.818 --> 00:26:34.594
absolute knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:39.379
And then you should work it out
because it can create problems.

00:26:57.781 --> 00:26:59.823
SY 1: He agrees, Mother.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:04.391
Because I have seen people who have done work.

00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:10.174
Those they were not such good
Sahaja Yogis have harmed.

00:27:29.609 --> 00:27:31.466
Also they must know the protection.

00:27:32.569 --> 00:27:34.344
How to protect from others.

00:27:35.562 --> 00:27:38.617
All these things are complete
science in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:42.267 --> 00:27:44.370
SY 2: He says he can see the auras.

00:27:44.395 --> 00:27:45.529
That he should not.

00:27:47.958 --> 00:27:52.813
SY 2: And then he can feel inside
if somebody is left or right, he says.

00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:54.555
On the finger tips, on the hands.

00:28:09.153 --> 00:28:12.581
All right let’s see, let him see my auras,
let’s see what does he see?

00:28:31.994 --> 00:28:35.409
SY 2: Three years ago when he first met you,

00:28:35.425 --> 00:28:40.308
he saw a huge green colour around you, green.

00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:45.941
And now he says, this time I did not
put my attention but when he did

00:28:45.966 --> 00:28:50.828
a minute ago, he says, he still sees that
green with a little bit of purple on top.

00:28:50.935 --> 00:28:51.935
Green with a?

00:28:52.006 --> 00:28:53.553
SY 2: Purple.

00:29:04.146 --> 00:29:10.360
SY 1: He felted the first time also.
He saw your aura first of all very wide, he says.

00:29:10.385 --> 00:29:12.734
What is the meaning of the green?

00:29:27.513 --> 00:29:32.555
SY 1: Specially when it is mix with
purple very deep in the spiritual world

00:29:32.579 --> 00:29:39.117
very connected, very powerful
in controlling the energies around.

00:29:39.137 --> 00:29:39.975
Green?

00:29:40.001 --> 00:29:45.474
SY 2: Green. And also big, big like
Mother’s love towards people.

00:29:45.498 --> 00:29:47.244
That is green, he says.

00:29:52.108 --> 00:29:55.750
And for the first two times.

00:29:55.776 --> 00:29:58.865
First time he saw and this time also

00:29:58.874 --> 00:30:02.464
he is also feeling his heart beat is going up.

00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:17.956
SY 2: After meeting you
three years ago and got

00:30:17.964 --> 00:30:20.856
his enlightenment his powers

00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:24.217
and his feeling observation

00:30:24.242 --> 00:30:26.253
has grown up immensely.

00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:29.168
And this time the reason he came here

00:30:29.193 --> 00:30:33.427
is for that hunger so he wants to have the…

00:30:33.452 --> 00:30:36.499
What I am saying that it takes hurdy anytime.

00:30:44.575 --> 00:30:48.140
SY 2: Also they say, the lady said that

00:30:48.164 --> 00:30:51.175
they also see a white light coming out

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.669
of your head going upwards.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.802
But when you are in that that you don’t see.

00:31:02.182 --> 00:31:04.999
When you are in that.

00:31:05.247 --> 00:31:08.161
When you are outside then you are only see.

00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:25.806
SY 2: He says he tries not to see. [UNCLEAR]

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.394
Not to see is the best state.
When you are inside you don’t see.

00:31:44.377 --> 00:31:49.649
[UNCLEAR] so judging by the aura will be all right

00:31:49.675 --> 00:31:55.178
but for not for you. You are not there,
you have to be inside.

00:32:20.213 --> 00:32:22.620
SY 2: Well they he says, he has to think,

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:26.297
he is starting from zero so he is learning.

00:32:26.317 --> 00:32:28.435
So here we have some people,

00:32:28.444 --> 00:32:31.534
they should come to them
and understand Sahaja Yoga

00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:33.439
very well, mastered it.

00:32:46.346 --> 00:32:48.750
By that he will be safe himself.

00:32:51.297 --> 00:32:55.632
One thing. And another thing is
whatever he do, will be perfect.

00:32:59.294 --> 00:33:01.079
No guest work.

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:20.553
SY 2: He wants to be a member of
the Sahaja Yoga Foundation here.

00:33:20.578 --> 00:33:24.778
And he wants to have
the combinations between also

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:28.925
their foundation which is called
the bioenergy foundation.

00:33:29.191 --> 00:33:31.699
But first he must have
the knowledge, perfectly.

00:33:48.014 --> 00:33:52.125
SY 2: He says we are already in Turkey

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:57.695
trying to proof people that
this bioenergy is scientific

00:33:57.735 --> 00:34:03.281
so that’s why I already very well
know that Sahaja Yoga is a science.

00:34:03.298 --> 00:34:05.672
[UNCLEAR] then could be complications, you see,

00:34:05.697 --> 00:34:07.959
so you must know what is this?

00:34:07.984 --> 00:34:10.422
What is happening?
What people are catching?

00:34:10.446 --> 00:34:13.658
What are their problems?
How to correct? exact.

00:34:38.258 --> 00:34:42.019
They have to raise the kundalini, give them realization.

00:34:46.837 --> 00:34:47.543
Everything.

00:35:12.045 --> 00:35:19.137
SY 2: He is even sending some of his clients,
some of his patients to Sahaja Yoga centre.

00:35:19.957 --> 00:35:22.728
Why don’t you do?
You should master yourself.

00:35:25.979 --> 00:35:27.669
Become a master very easily.

00:35:30.866 --> 00:35:33.667
SY 2: He says, he doesn’t know who to learn it from.

00:35:33.688 --> 00:35:34.688
All of them.

00:35:37.706 --> 00:35:38.999
Selim can do it.

00:35:45.016 --> 00:35:48.277
SY 2: He already knows Selim
but he lost his telephone number.

00:35:48.805 --> 00:35:49.901
Selim is there.

00:35:51.435 --> 00:35:55.111
SY 3: Jai Shri Mataji,
We have a lot of people.

00:36:01.581 --> 00:36:04.542
SY 2: They are coming, they are coming, they say

00:36:04.568 --> 00:36:06.845
to do the Sahaja Yoga centre.

00:36:10.972 --> 00:36:15.616
The first point is that first you know yourself.

00:36:16.223 --> 00:36:17.739
That is Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:50.919 --> 00:36:53.611
SY 2: He says he is already trying to project himself

00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:56.931
from his patients by meditation but

00:36:56.948 --> 00:37:00.251
if he learns all the technics of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:18.174
SY 2: He has some knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:18.199 --> 00:37:21.734
He is reading some but not enough.
He should perfect it.

00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:27.692
And one thing he will not see colours
or anything these auras, he will not see.

00:37:42.196 --> 00:37:45.775
SY 2: He doesn’t want to see himself either, Shri Mataji.

00:38:27.671 --> 00:38:32.308
SY 2: She just realized because she also knew

00:38:32.333 --> 00:38:35.859
that something she saw also.

00:38:35.924 --> 00:38:38.801
After she gets deeper and deeper,

00:38:38.809 --> 00:38:41.035
she started not to see.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:44.805
And she didn’t know why and
got the answer from you.

00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:52.560
HHSBecause if you see
from outside, it is there.

00:38:52.675 --> 00:38:56.556
Supposing you are outside the sea,
you can see the sea.

00:38:56.582 --> 00:38:59.195
But if you sank inside the sea
what would you see?

00:39:12.276 --> 00:39:16.196
SY 2: There is the compliment
since three years ago

00:39:16.212 --> 00:39:17.993
you become younger Mother. Yes.

00:39:21.585 --> 00:39:24.618
I’ve go on working like this, I don’t know.

00:39:55.298 --> 00:39:58.480
SY 2: He wants to be enlightened more and more.

00:39:58.505 --> 00:40:03.093
And he would like to hear your last words

00:40:03.118 --> 00:40:07.765
to them before they live. So that
they can regulate their life accordingly

00:40:07.802 --> 00:40:10.754
See there are stages in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:14.837
The one is called as thoughtless awareness,

00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:21.518
is a, I have made it even
shorter than Patanjali.

00:40:22.046 --> 00:40:27.946
He said first it should be awareness
with the thoughts.

00:40:28.252 --> 00:40:32.547
Then second stage he says there
should be thoughtless awareness.

00:40:32.706 --> 00:40:37.806
Then the second, third stage
he says should be

00:40:37.823 --> 00:40:42.096
what we call “nirvi kalpa” that
there should be no doubts

00:40:42.123 --> 00:40:46.886
but he says first you will have
doubts and Samadhi

00:40:47.207 --> 00:40:50.812
with the doubts.
But then you have no doubts.

00:40:50.852 --> 00:40:54.000
So this is the fourth stage
when you go beyond that ...
