00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:26.960
Today we have gathered here to do the Kundalini
Puja or the Adishakti Puja.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.879
There's a difference between the two.

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:57.800
Adishakti is the total power of God, of His
desire; while Kundalini 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:16.320
is the one that is reflected, part, which
is reflected in the human beings as Kundalini.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.391
So there's a difference between the Adi Kundalini
and the Adishakti.

00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:42.170
Adishakti is the Parashakti, is the power,
which is beyond all the powers, which controls

00:01:42.170 --> 00:02:00.850
all the powers and one of the powers of Adishakti
is Kundalini.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:12.340
For example the Kundalini which is placed
within Me in the triangular bone is not totality

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.290
of Me.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.379
In the same way the Kundalini, which is placed
within you, is not the totality.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:33.409
Of course it is the power, which is there
to give you your self-realization.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:45.639
Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes
you, that enlightens your centers.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:55.159
But there are two other powers as you know
very powerful, which are working through Ida

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:07.299
and Pingala and the third one is Mahalakshmi
which is in the center.

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:25.989
Now Kundalini's main job is to give you your
self-realization because She is your individual

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.959
Mother.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:39.169
Everyone has the Kundalini within himself
or herself reflected whatever maybe the quality

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.680
of that person.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.229
Now as you see reflections fall on everything.

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:56.579
Say, the reflection of the Moon falls on the
stone; you don't see any reflection.

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:09.089
It then falls on a better reflector - say
the water, then we can see the reflection.

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:22.580
But when it falls on a mirror, which is very
nicely made, say in Belgium, it reflects better.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.430
So that is how the reflection gradually goes
on improving.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:40.370
In the same way we have human beings who have
different reflectors but they can be improved

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.669
and they can be made absolutely top class,
its possible.

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.800
It depends now here it comes into other powers
that are within.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.479
One power which is the desire.

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:07.919
Though the Kundalini as you see is the power
of pure desire that it doesn't want anything.

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.020
But it wants to give you self-realization.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:21.460
The other two powers - one of them is the
mundane desire.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:33.990
This mundane desire if it becomes nothing
but pure desire, then Kundalini has no problems

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.219
from the left side.

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:50.479
But if it is not a pure desire, but full of
other desires - for example: the first desire

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:57.170
of human beings, which comes from animals
I think, is food.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:04.210
He wants food to nourish himself.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:12.330
But human being don't only take food to nourish,
also for the taste of it, or for the beauty

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.110
of it, which is innately working in them.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:37.840
That's why we run after food, which is very
good, very tasty, all kinds of ideas we have

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.090
and there's no standard.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:51.370
Somebody can like this, somebody can like
that, but the one who understands that the

00:06:51.370 --> 00:07:06.320
taste of the food is not important and can
practice it, then it works.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:26.889
It works wonders because the lowest desire,
which is of food, comes under your control.

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:36.340
If you can sometimes go without food, of course
not for God but for yourself, God doesn't

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.470
want you to starve.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:54.590
If you can live without food, if you can enjoy
every type of food, then you have done a lot

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:03.180
to improve the path of Shushumna for the Kundalini.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:17.779
I've seen in many cases that Kundalini just
doesn't rise, She doesn't rise, even if She

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:21.069
rises, She falls back.

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:33.210
This happens when a person is very self-indulgent
- is all the time thinking of things, which

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:42.750
are not of very great importance for Spirituality.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:58.100
Apart from this there's another horrible one
desire we have is to grab as much money as

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.870
possible, to think about money.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:09.470
This time I had a bad experience because Sahaja
Yogis came down to Me and told Me, "Mother

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:15.190
they are asking if I, if we should reduce
the puja money or something?"

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.790
I was shocked because I never decide about
it.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.190
It's all decided by the leaders.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.730
I said, "I am not concerned."

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:33.410
Then they would like to have a bargain as
you have in the shop you see or maybe some

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.970
sort of a sale or some sort of a thing.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:42.260
This is one of the greatest dangers in your
ascent.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.399
For a guru people pay millions and millions.

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:52.250
Where you know I am working it out for your
projects, I am buying lands for you, I am

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.940
doing things for you and for which you need
money.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:04.070
But nobody comes forward with any donations
as such.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:11.720
They won't, they don't understand that it
is for you I have to have all these things

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:20.580
not for Me and they pestered people many a
times like this.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:26.009
Once suddenly they decided that we could have
fifty percent payment.

00:10:26.009 --> 00:10:32.160
Immediately so many telephone - "Ah are you
going to have fifty percent less the bargain

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.160
price?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.860
We are coming for the bargain".

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.279
Is the sale programming.

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:45.020
For example in the sale what do they do?

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:57.370
They offer you something, so that they can
get a lot more customers or things like that.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:02.243
Sahaja yoga is just the opposite of that.

00:11:02.243 --> 00:11:05.980
You don't have to give anything but you get
lot.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:12.660
But this is not for sale; this is not for
sale by any chance.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:20.660
It is a thing where you have to pay because
we have to have all these things and I have

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:26.779
to pay so many things which you do not know
- like last time we had about I think fifty

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:32.300
people who came just free.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.040
Some of the leaders know.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:41.550
But some of the leaders, they just go on asking
like this because I don't know perhaps they

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:47.200
want to save money or they want to popularize
themselves among the disciples maybe, that

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.170
is the reason.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:12:04.250
So this thinking about money itself is a very
detrimental force for your spirituality.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.410
Otherwise what others are doing is the same.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.360
All the time they are thinking of money, thinking
of money.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:20.120
Now if you are thinking of money and thinking
of earning more, for Sahaja Yoga to help Sahaja

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.870
Yoga it's all right.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.209
But it is for yours own ideas.

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:28.709
In the West it's very common.

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:36.800
Not in India I must tell you, we; India is
the poor country but one day Yogi told Me,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.100
"Mother I need some money for the school".

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.060
I said, "All right I'll give you".

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.779
"No, no", he said, "I'll collect".

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:48.060
And he collected in one meeting eighteen lakhs
of Rupees.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:56.399
Of course I told him, "Now don't take it,
I've got money to pay, don't collect".

00:12:56.399 --> 00:13:01.200
But so much of money orientation all the time.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:12.210
Thinking about money, saving money, these
things are absolutely against Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.980
You can ask anyone how much I understand about
money.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:21.900
I don't understand banking, I cannot count,
even thousand pounds I cannot count.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.310
I'll count them two thousand or three thousand;
I don't know what I do?

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:30.610
My brain goes off when it comes to money.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.640
I don't know how to count.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.750
I am not worried about what money we have,
what we have, what we have to do is this money

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:45.649
is here let us do something about it.

00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:50.860
Today I don't know why I have to tell about
this gross subject.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:56.089
But it has been pointed out to Me, "Mother
you never say anything about it and the people

00:13:56.089 --> 00:13:59.690
are getting really materialistic".

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.410
That's a very sad affair.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:09.050
Even one person, who is materialistic, will
have to go out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:21.070
Gradually it will work that way and you'll
be surprised that you are out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:32.069
It is very amazing how after getting realization
also, getting on top of the world, we still

00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:42.509
live in small little holes like rats of this
money business.

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:53.910
This money has brought so much problems to
our world, you can see it clearly.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:15:00.770
All this Economics and all this knowledge
of Economics where it has gone?

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.629
Is the world better by it?

00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:10.319
There's recession going on everywhere, everybody
is unemployed.

00:15:10.319 --> 00:15:16.089
In every country you go there's unemployment
so much; this is so much.

00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:25.100
That shows that this Economics is also a very
artificial science and dealing with the weakness

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:32.410
of human being, not with their strength.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:39.540
If they could know the strength of human beings,
they would have done much better than they

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:44.170
have done so far.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:57.529
I'll give a simple example: Now, we have very
sophisticated places in the West, very sophisticated.

00:15:57.529 --> 00:16:06.100
You know they have everything electrical,
you push the button and everything is there.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.620
Specially in these modern planes when I travel,
I don't know which one to push because they

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:20.279
are so slim and so delicate you see, need
a special artist to do that.

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:25.579
All this is for what for getting more money,
and more money and impressing people.

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:34.579
But at the same time people are fed up; when
all these sophistications are on.

00:16:34.579 --> 00:16:39.290
They are fed up with computers, they are fed
up with electricity, they are fed up with

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:45.040
cement, they are fed up all kinds of artificial
thing, is a fact.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.529
More, more, much more in the West than in
the developing countries.

00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:52.720
They are just fed up.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:59.689
Now this is the force, this is the strength.

00:16:59.689 --> 00:17:01.480
Why are they fed up?

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:11.470
They are fed up because they have realized
it doesn't give you joy.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.000
It doesn't give you soothing feeling.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.700
It irritates them.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:33.180
So it is against human mind, human character
or human civilization, something inhuman.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.890
So now what to do?

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:45.480
I went to America once, and went to see a
friend of ours and all the houses were covered

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.350
with the cow dung color you see.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:55.030
I said, "Why do they have these cow dung all
over these houses you know?

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.050
What is the matter with them?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:01.740
Why don't they have nice white or another
people like very much is this sand color?

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:07.290
He said, "Now a days these Americans want
to have cow dung."

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.600
I said, "Cow dung!

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.760
For what?"

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.570
"Because they are fed up of cement.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.370
Now they can't get so much cow dung here.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:26.290
So they have a special way of making cement
look like cow dung.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:33.850
They mix up things so the color comes out
like cow dung".

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:37.390
I said, "Why the cow dung of all the things
you see?"

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:44.660
So they said that some of them went to India
and they had to sleep in some huts, which

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.930
were covered with cow dung.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:57.200
So they found out logically that cow dung
if we have, it will be the most soothing color

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.310
for us.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:06.330
And so there were articles about it and people
have started using cow dung.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.750
So what is the force now behind?

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.640
What is the strength?

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:21.490
The strength is that they want to live in
natural way; they don't want to have artificial

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.260
things.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.600
So they go to another extreme to have cow
dung.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.760
Sahaja Yoga is in between.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:42.240
Now one has to understand that whether you
put cow dung or you put cement or anything,

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.060
it's not going to give you joy.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:58.350
Say for India people who have got cement houses
are great, you know?

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:05.480
According to them cement represents luxury
and also rank.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:14.670
But in the West if people see cement, my goodness,
cement means to them it is something like

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.850
a grave.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:25.780
So now the positive thing that is in with
them is that they now want to live with a

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.040
natural things.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.020
They want to use natural material.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.310
Natural life.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:45.820
But to the extreme if they go you see we had
anti culture like hippyism and all that.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.340
It brought no luck.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:21:02.880
So to get from one end to another extreme
it also not conducive to a human life because;

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.460
and you see a human being cannot become primitive.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:14.650
Even if he tries to dress up like a primitive
person his brain is modern.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:24.380
So when they get fed up from one to another,
they don't realize that what is the missing

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.900
point?

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:38.510
In both the things whether you live like a
rustic person or a very cementy person, any

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:51.160
type you might live, the missing point is
that in everything there is a competition.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.830
Once it starts the fashion all right everybody
will have cane chairs; everybody is having

00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:01.860
cane chairs.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:10.280
Now in this competition, they miss the point
is the joy.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:20.150
A person who is a realized soul will not desire
whether it is cement or anything or anything

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.240
doesn't matter its just the same.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:37.010
But it will come to his mind that all these
artificial things are ruining human beings.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.560
So he'll say no.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:51.290
But he will not have hair like the primitive
people; he'll not behave like primitive people

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:58.160
and lead a very normal, natural life.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.140
So when the mind starts thinking something
about it, it will never get to the point of

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:10.480
joy, from one end to another.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:18.570
So they think that they are going into a balance,
they are going into dharma.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:23.050
My experience is different.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:29.570
Even those who were hippies I know them, they
used to eat like real gluttons and they are

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:36.460
very much interested in their comforts and
they would go to any extent of snatching anything

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.570
of that belongs to somebody else.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:46.080
They thought they now become hippies so they're
already the landlords, because they have given

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.900
up this, they have given up that.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:24:00.540
So the mind that suggest that to overcome
your money orientation, your competition and

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:07.350
all these artificial things you should change
your life style.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:13.710
But that doesn't help, never.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:20.870
It's just a play of the mind from one to another.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:30.010
So how to detach yourself from this idea of
money orientation?

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:42.040
Whether you wear a sanyasi's dress or you
wear a wonderful - some very expensive dress,

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:46.100
is the same to the body.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.310
You can't even see your own dress.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.020
So is the same to the eyes.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:25:05.290
But with the mind you start convincing yourself
that now I've become a big sanyasi because

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:09.740
I am wearing a saffron dress.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:17.700
By wearing that kind of a dress you can never
get rid of this nonsense.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.710
So first thing you have to be a normal person.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.620
There is no need to be abnormal outside.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:38.960
That you are deceiving yourself.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:47.160
If you think by changing your dress, attire,
your lifestyle you have become a great sanyasi

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:54.970
or a great, detached person from this money
orientation then I must say, 'don't deceive

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.030
yourself'.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:15.160
A person who is detached from within helps
the Kundalini to rise constantly without any

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:20.450
catches.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:32.540
So for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to introspect
and see for himself what is your level?

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:41.370
As I told you about the reflector what sort
of a reflector you are?

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:48.050
No use deceiving yourself because Sahaja Yoga
is for you, for your benevolence and your

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:53.440
Kundalini is for your benevolence.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:04.480
The ascent is the aim of your life and to
perfect it is your job.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:13.650
So you don't have to take to anything outside.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:24.460
It is inside you have to see yourself what
sort of attachments you have.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:33.660
The second force which is, I am surprised
how has suddenly come up among Sahaja Yogis

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.390
that they don't have immorality problems.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.740
They have just become moral, most of them.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:46.290
Ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, I think
are moral people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:54.080
There may be here and there because they enjoy
their morality.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:28:00.460
Because they enjoy their morality they want
to be that.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.980
Not only that they want their children to
be moral, their families to be moral.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:12.320
And that is how morality is spreading in Sahaja
Yoga very fast.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:20.960
In that also one has to understand that it
is the innocence, which is the force.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:26.790
Not the morality like some people write to
Me, "Mother I get up in the morning, I sit

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:34.070
before the photograph, I do this, I do that,
then I take my bath and then I do this."

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:40.500
I don't, I cant understand this, no not necessary.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:47.490
You have to cleanse yourself once in the night
as you cleanse yourself - your body.

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:52.900
And once in the morning you have to pray,
that's all.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:58.410
Is not necessary to have this ritualism, this
kind of a rigmarole.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.520
Oh all the time you go in.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:08.850
Everyday morning till evening nonsensical
these things and they become fanatic.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:15.590
They start becoming absolutely fanatic about
Sahaja yoga and this fanaticism can be very

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:24.280
dangerous because they try to remember everything
by heart this and that.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.590
No, not necessary.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:34.490
It should be in the heart because it amounts
to the lip service there and with the lip

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:40.970
service gradually you start feeling you are
great, your father is great, you this and

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:41.970
that.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.850
So you are thrown away.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:50.000
You yourself throw yourself out like a, I
can say like a - you hit a ball and it comes

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.740
back like, I've seen people - many who try
to thrust themselves in Sahaja Yoga just are

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.430
repelled back by themselves, not by Sahaja
Yoga.

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:05.560
Sahaja Yoga attracts you, no doubt.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.180
But you must have gravity.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:14.260
If you don't have gravity how can you be attracted?

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:22.980
The seriousness about it is only this - that
you should introspect, seriously.

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.970
Find out what's wrong with you.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:30.720
Because this is a great chance for you to
ascend.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:40.820
With this kind of a mind, which becomes fanatic
in Sahaja Yoga, starts saying harsh things

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:54.990
to other and disturbing the peace of others
because they think they are very great Sahaja

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:56.310
Yogis.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:04.040
Then I think one should introspect and find
out why am I doing it?

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:09.390
So many people have the same defects but for
that they'll scold others.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.030
Perhaps maybe they think by correcting another
person they might be corrected.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.970
I don't know what is the idea of their procedure
is?

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:27.410
But it is very absurd sometimes; the way people
look at their, look at their problems as if

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.120
these are the problems of others.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:36.020
Now, if I am saying this to you somebody must
be counting - "Ah I know this one Mother is

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.980
saying about that one".

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:45.560
Never will say that it's for me and I have
to see myself and introspect and find out

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:51.880
what is dragging me down.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:58.840
So this is one of the most important things
is that you cannot be harsh, you cannot hurt

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:05.940
people, you cannot misbehave in that manner,
and if you can't do that then you are thrown

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:11.520
out of Sahaja Yoga by yourself, nobody has
to throw you.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:17.270
You have to correct you, people have to like
you and you have to be one of them.

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:23.620
If the collectivity is not there, your Kundalini
will never rise.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:29.990
Because She's rising, She's trying to give
you a second birth so that you become one

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:31.640
with the whole.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.170
The drop becomes the ocean.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.660
That's Her job, She'll never rise.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:44.990
A person who thinks he's very exclusive, special
should not come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:55.130
This is another great hurdle in raising the
Kundalini when people think that they are

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.910
something special.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:03.520
We have no priesthood.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:13.530
And leadership is also is a myth I think,
people whom I think are better off with their

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.740
Kundalini I can communicate better.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:22.320
But sometimes they too behave in such a manner
that one is shocked.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.320
How could they behave like this?

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:30.730
And these serpents you see just suddenly come
up and you see them.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:36.710
You are shocked what are they doing, where
is their attention?

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:43.590
What are they worried about?

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:49.330
So such stupid ideas if they walk into your
mind tell them, shut up now I know myself

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:50.980
very well.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:56.720
That's the best way to keep you out of it
all these nonsensical things that are working.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.160
First of all you must remember that you are
seekers of truth.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:10.930
Have been seeking truth for ages, for years
together and now, I would say for many lives

00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:13.179
and now you have found it.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:24.720
So grab it and hold it fast by understanding
that this is what you wanted you've got it

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.639
now.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:33.781
The another big problem that comes in the
awakening of the Kundalini which I feel is

00:34:33.781 --> 00:34:41.500
very important to be told to you is that some
of you think that you are very close to Me.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:50.409
That you have a special right on Me.

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:55.069
You don't know your Mother is a Mahamaya,
be careful.

00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:58.789
I am telling you again and again.

00:34:58.789 --> 00:35:02.450
Never think that way.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.970
Nobody can be My favorite, I assure you, cannot
be.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:20.660
It is like a mercury if you put it on another
metal or something doesn't stick you know.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.119
My mind never sticks to anyone, never sticks.

00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:30.559
Now supposing somebody is in trouble, somebody
has written to Me, there's some problem, then

00:35:30.559 --> 00:35:33.009
the thought comes in.

00:35:33.009 --> 00:35:44.760
But I don't stick to that, I don't stick to
anyone nor do I have any attachment to anyone

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.480
because that will be against the principle
of pure love.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:55.240
I cannot be attached, of course I see your
problems very intimately.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:36:05.380
I would love to solve them, I get worried
sometimes, you can call it worried, but the

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:12.920
thought - attention is going towards that
person.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:25.369
You've seen when there's a tide, the Moon
when it is full Moon the tide is much bigger.

00:36:25.369 --> 00:36:36.210
Does the ocean think what about the Moon?

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:45.230
Does he think that it has to attract the particular
ocean or someone?

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:51.839
It's just the nature - the swabhava, the nature
itself that acts.

00:36:51.839 --> 00:37:04.019
That's the nature, you can't help it and this
nature is the one you should also try to adopt

00:37:04.019 --> 00:37:09.160
and adore because it's very helpful.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:16.700
This gives you a great relief from your mind,
which is always thinking, thinking, thinking

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:22.259
and doesn't allow you to have thoughtless
awareness.

00:37:22.259 --> 00:37:30.089
Get attached to someone, you are worried about
some problems, even your problems sometimes,

00:37:30.089 --> 00:37:31.089
all the time your problem.

00:37:31.089 --> 00:37:38.369
Thinking about your problem or about somebody
whom you are attached to.

00:37:38.369 --> 00:37:40.100
Then this mind starts working.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.950
How to solve the problem, what to do, this
and that?

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:51.789
But then you stop your Agnya completely, how
will the Kundalini rise?

00:37:51.789 --> 00:38:00.349
In any walk of life for a Sahaja Yogi, it
is the best way to stop thinking is to think

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:03.820
how he's going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.849
Just divert your attention.

00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:15.190
This is the greatest pleasure for you, for
which you don't have to pay or anything; just

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:18.040
know what powers you have got.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:26.799
At this point I find many people are not at
all aware of their powers and not using them.

00:38:26.799 --> 00:38:31.819
When you don't use your powers also Kundalini
falls down.

00:38:31.819 --> 00:38:34.680
Why should She work?

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:46.269
She's not stupid; if you don't want to use
Her for what She has to achieve then why should

00:38:46.269 --> 00:38:48.450
She worry about you?

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:52.530
So She just drops down, She has nothing to
do with you.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.580
Then suddenly you come out, "Mother I got
this trouble, I've got that trouble, this

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.000
happened".

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:08.210
Especially troubles like arthritis and all
such troubles come from people who don't use

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.119
their vibrations.

00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:18.660
Give it to the flowers, give it to the trees,
give it to anything that is living but don't

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.230
shirk it.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:28.180
You need not touch the person but the desire
should be 'whom should I give vibrations?'

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:35.579
Only worry should be 'whom should I put attention
to?

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:39.769
Where should I put this energy of mine?'

00:39:39.769 --> 00:39:45.500
Once you start using, this Divine Power it
starts flowing much more, much more and your

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:51.910
Mother - the Kundalini is very happy.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.400
And then you start seeing wonders what's happening.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:07.619
For that you have to have first of all attention
on compassion and love; but compassion and

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:12.849
love of God - God Almighty.

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:19.869
But when I talk of compassion I find people
are more interested in the people who are,

00:40:19.869 --> 00:40:26.660
Sahaja Yogis who are suffering, who have problems,
who are thrown away from Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.519
They will write to Me, "Mother please, please
some or other take them back".

00:40:31.519 --> 00:40:33.180
That's My job not yours.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:44.609
But those who don't love God, they are not
going to achieve much.

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:53.440
They have loose tongues, they talk funnily,
they don't understand they are dealing with

00:40:53.440 --> 00:41:03.950
God Almighty and this kind of frivolous talking
and frivolous behavior; you must understand

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:10.470
that angels are around you all the time, all
the time they are with you.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.500
They watch you.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:22.869
They will help you, they'll support you, they'll
elevate you, they'll cross all kinds of hurdles

00:41:22.869 --> 00:41:36.410
but you have to love God from all your heart
and all your soul.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:52.180
You can't say things, which are not full of
protocol.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:58.900
All this is only possible when you surrender
your ego.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:04.859
God doesn't want anything from you.

00:42:04.859 --> 00:42:06.200
What can you give to God?

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.930
It's a funny idea people have.

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:13.609
But its all right you can give anything to
God.

00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:21.380
Krishna has said that you can give Me flowers,
you can give Me water, you can give Me this

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:28.259
presents, this / that, I'll accept.

00:42:28.259 --> 00:42:32.040
But what does He say?

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:45.250
That only thing that you have to do is to
be one with Me.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:51.730
You have to be one with Me, you have to connect,
be connected with Me.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:43:01.190
And this feeling of connection is so satisfying,
is so joy giving, so nice, which cannot be

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.730
described in words.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:18.930
Thus you find your Kundalini is just flowing
out with joy for yourself and for others.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:32.680
Also the right side - ambitiousness, domination,
showing off, harshness, cruelties.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.339
I don't know how many things there are on
the right side.

00:43:36.339 --> 00:43:38.520
But they can be unlimited.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:42.000
I mean the limit is Hitler you can say, so
far.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:49.249
God knows some other may come to compete with
him, but so far he's the last word.

00:43:49.249 --> 00:43:59.880
So all these also start destroying this Kundalini.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:13.809
I've seen also Kundalini of people which is
hurt, wounded, just can't rise, finished.

00:44:13.809 --> 00:44:21.589
Then I feel that let them take a second birth;
only then one can work it out because is impossible

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:27.050
for such a Kundalini to make Her rise.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:38.829
If you are selfish and you are cruel then
this Kundalini becomes hurt.

00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:43.900
A good mother feels hurt when her child misbehaves.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:52.049
So this Kundalini gets very hurt because She
wants you to have your second birth and She

00:44:52.049 --> 00:44:58.320
cant just bear it and this makes Her absolutely
incapable of rising.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:05.799
She becomes sick, ill and wounded.

00:45:05.799 --> 00:45:10.769
So all kinds of aggressiveness should be given
up.

00:45:10.769 --> 00:45:17.769
That's not going to help because you have
come to Sahaja Yoga not for saving money or

00:45:17.769 --> 00:45:19.230
bargaining or anything.

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:24.150
You have come here because you are seekers.

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:31.079
I've seen invariably people who have been
to false gurus always have this kind of a

00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:35.119
money orientation because they must have been
lynched completely by the previous gurus,

00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:39.140
maybe, I don't know what to say.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:49.849
So it is we who can rise through our own goodness
and beauty.

00:45:49.849 --> 00:46:00.460
And it is we who can come up to a level of
great Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.380
Don't keep this power with yourself.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:11.609
It is to be distributed and given to others
and make others also very happy and joyous.

00:46:11.609 --> 00:46:15.970
Is a duty of every Sahaja Yogi to do it.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:24.869
Also thinking about Sahaja Yoga, not about
yourself is the best way to avoid many problems.

00:46:24.869 --> 00:46:29.440
But once they start thinking about Sahaja
Yoga, they start thinking about the defects

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:36.089
of Sahaja Yogis; that's not going to help.

00:46:36.089 --> 00:46:42.150
You have to develop that peace of mind within
yourself by which you can become the witness

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.950
of yourself first.

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:50.200
You should be able to witness yourself and
see what are the things, which are putting

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.560
you down.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:57.829
Because today the world is absolutely chaotic,
from this chaotic world you have to rise into

00:46:57.829 --> 00:47:05.079
a very peaceful, beautiful world and you have
to take many to that.

00:47:05.079 --> 00:47:07.579
For that you have to have the quality.

00:47:07.579 --> 00:47:15.849
It's not just you become Sahaja Yogis, put
My badge here and all that.

00:47:15.849 --> 00:47:20.099
In every way you can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:25.829
But be careful because one should not feel
that you've done a great job.

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:35.570
Whatever you are doing is for your own good
not for others.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:46.930
Now we have to see what a great thing that
has happened because Kundalini was a big mystery

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:47.930
before.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:53.140
But now it is not anymore, it's all open.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:57.630
You all know about it.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:04.130
You know about its powers, you know how you
can achieve your highest goal.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:14.250
So just to balance, just to lead a mediocre
life is not the way a real true seeker of

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:15.329
truth should do.

00:48:15.329 --> 00:48:20.980
But if you are the real seeker of truth, then
you should see what's wrong with what I've

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:26.380
been doing, whatever I've been following and
what I have to achieve.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:32.019
All the scriptures have said that you have
to be the Spirit.

00:48:32.019 --> 00:48:36.880
All the scriptures had said that you have
to be born again, I am not saying that anymore.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:45.739
Only thing what I am doing it what they have
said I am trying to do it and requesting that

00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:46.739
you should do.

00:48:46.739 --> 00:48:53.779
Sahaja Yoga is not going to be like other
religions where people abuse children, do

00:48:53.779 --> 00:48:58.839
what they like, make money, this/ that, all
nonsense - like a mafia.

00:48:58.839 --> 00:49:08.619
You are people who are chosen and are special
people who believe in a good moral life and

00:49:08.619 --> 00:49:10.230
a peaceful life.

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.390
May God bless you.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.930
