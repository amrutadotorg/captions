1
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:32,323
Today we all have assembled here

2
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:46,823
to pay our respect to Shri Ganesha.

3
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:59,864
Ganapatipule has a special significance

4
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:11,989
because He is Mahaganesha.

5
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:17,989
The Ganesha at Mooladhara

6
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,406
becomes Mahaganesha

7
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:26,781
in the Virata, that is the brain.

8
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,697
That means it is the seat of Shri Ganesha.

9
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,781
That means Shri Ganesha governs

10
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:49,406
from that seat the principle of innocence.

11
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:56,031
As you know very well it is placed at the back

12
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:05,240
in the region of optic thalamus,

13
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:09,781
optic lobe as they call it,

14
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:24,365
and it is the giver of innocence to the eyes.

15
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:34,406
When He incarnated as Christ

16
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:40,240
which is in here in the front, at Agnya

17
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:44,739
He said very clearly that

18
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:48,739
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

19
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,989
It's a very subtle saying,

20
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:57,406
which people don't understand

21
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:02,156
what is the meaning of the word "adultery."

22
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:08,989
"Adultery" means "impurity" in a general word.

23
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:15,447
Any impurity in the eye "thou shalt not have"

24
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,156
it's very difficult.

25
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,864
Instead of saying that you get your realization

26
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:25,531
and clear your back Agnya,

27
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:28,240
He has said it in a very short form,

28
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:31,781
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

29
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:37,323
And people thought, it's an impossible situation.

30
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:41,156
Because He was not allowed to live long;

31
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:43,948
actually His public life is limited

32
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:46,198
to three-and-a-half years only.

33
00:09:49,906 --> 00:09:54,864
So whatever He has said has a very great significance,

34
00:09:55,156 --> 00:09:58,989
that your eyes should not be adulterous.

35
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:04,031
When there is innocence there is no adultery:

36
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:08,531
it means there's no impurity.

37
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:11,406
For example, with our eyes

38
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:19,531
we see something and we want to possess it.

39
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:22,864
We start thinking.

40
00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:26,365
The thought starts

41
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:30,365
like a chain, one after another.

42
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:43,031
And then we get into the web of horrible thoughts,

43
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:48,031
and then we become slaves of those thoughts.

44
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:50,656
Without even our knowledge,

45
00:10:50,656 --> 00:10:54,115
our eyes are turned to things

46
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,989
which are very gross

47
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:01,406
and take you downward.

48
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:10,989
As Shri Krishna has said that the Tree of Awareness

49
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:16,031
grows upside-down,

50
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:22,572
that the roots are in the brain

51
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:26,031
and the branches grow downward.

52
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:28,406
Those who have gone towards materialism

53
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:30,531
have grown downward.

54
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:35,323
Those who have gone towards Divine

55
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:38,489
have grown upwards, towards the roots.

56
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:43,198
The main root, as they call the taproot,

57
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:51,073
the main root is innocence, is Shri Ganesha.

58
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:56,739
And He becomes Mahaganesha in Ganapatipule.

59
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:02,656
Here He's surrounded

60
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,864
by the Father Principle, the Guru Principle

61
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:20,281
of the sea, the ocean - the Indian Ocean.

62
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:33,198
That is, here He becomes a Guru.

63
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,156
When a Sahaja yogi

64
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:41,656
establishes his Shri Ganesha Principle,

65
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:43,864
he's still a child.

66
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:54,073
Of course his eyes start becoming purer and purer,

67
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:58,323
and powerful and glistening.

68
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,572
You must have seen when the kundalini gives you

69
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:07,823
the realization

70
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:14,489
then your eyes start gleaming,

71
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:17,323
like a spark is there in the eyes,

72
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,323
you can make out a spark.

73
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,948
With ego it gets covered,

74
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:38,489
with ego it blinds.

75
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:45,323
With superego it is covered with tears.

76
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,989
But when they are clear

77
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:55,406
you see the beauty of the eyes,

78
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:05,989
Shri Ganesha shining through your glances.

79
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:17,281
The attention now starts flowing

80
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,906
through the window of Shri Ganesha's temple.

81
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,281
But when you mature,

82
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:34,697
you become Mahaganesha.

83
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:39,073
Then Mahaganesha is established in you

84
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:43,323
and you become a satguru,

85
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:48,823
you become a divine guru, you can teach others.

86
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:54,323
Even a child could be that

87
00:14:55,031 --> 00:14:58,406
even a grown-up person may be stupid.

88
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:07,198
It has nothing to do with age, color, creed or caste.

89
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:13,365
It is a state to which one can reach at any time.

90
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:16,864
Like we can say here we had Gyaneshwara,

91
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:19,365
who at a very young age

92
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:28,156
composed the great Gyaneshwari.

93
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:31,823
As you have seen yesterday,

94
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:34,781
at the age of twelve years Gorakhnath

95
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:39,406
established his Mahaganesha.

96
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:48,656
But if you do not try to ascend,

97
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,864
then you'll remain at the same stage

98
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:52,989
even when you grow old.

99
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,031
So maturity is the indication.

100
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:01,906
Here, as we see in Ganapatipule,

101
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,323
Shri Ganesha is in its complete, matured form

102
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:17,323
so that we develop also our Mahaganesha

103
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:18,989
within ourselves,

104
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:29,906
and our eyes become pure, powerful and divine.

105
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:40,031
With proper working out,

106
00:16:41,864 --> 00:16:50,739
I am sure we can establish that state within ourselves.

107
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:59,823
Today we came to Ganapatipule, it has a great significance,

108
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:01,948
among the Asthavinayaka (eight Swayambhus of Shri Ganesha),

109
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:05,447
It is the place of Mahaganesha.

110
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:12,989
Mahaganesha is Pithadhish (Governor of all pithas)

111
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,406
and sitting on this pitha,

112
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:23,572
he protects all the Ganesha Swayambhus.

113
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:28,281
He has the knowledge of all the Omkaras,

114
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:34,405
as he has attained the Guru Tatwa (Guru Principle).

115
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:40,115
If we see in the surroundings,

116
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,115
the ocean, so beautiful and clean

117
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:46,656
is washing the feet of this Ganapati,

118
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:56,823
because the ocean represents the Guru Tatwa,

119
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:03,156
and with that Guru Tatwa, he washes the feet of Shri Ganesha

120
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:10,198
that is how it should happen with all the Sahaja Yogis.

121
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:14,365
Ganesha Stuthi is done and then Shri Ganesha is established

122
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:18,989
and thereafter with the Mahalaxmi Tatwa

123
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,823
you have to become Mahaganeshas.

124
00:18:27,614 --> 00:18:31,281
This state can be achieved by children small and big,

125
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:36,115
elderly people, ladies and everyone,

126
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:43,531
if they can attain the straight forward behaviour,

127
00:18:44,614 --> 00:18:49,447
which we call as   Saralya  in Marathi, or they say Abhodita

128
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:55,864
or innocence, when it is once imbibed in us,

129
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,365
we can achieve the Guru Principle.

130
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:04,697
Whichever Guru, who does not have this straight forward nature

131
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,572
and innocence, he can never be a Guru,

132
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:08,906
he is a Aguru (false Guru).

133
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:13,365
The person, whose attention is always on the Divine Power,

134
00:19:14,365 --> 00:19:16,365
only he can become a real Guru.

135
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:23,365
The attention of normal human beings is perverted,

136
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:28,572
it is not clean. For this Christ has said,

137
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:32,739
there should be no adultery in your eyes,

138
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:37,989
means that if we put our attention on something,

139
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:42,614
we start thinking a lot and strange thoughts come to our mind,

140
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:44,614
as to how I can acquire this thing

141
00:19:44,864 --> 00:19:46,365
and why I did not get this thing,

142
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:47,989
and other thoughts as to why and why not.

143
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:51,115
If we see something and start thinking, then

144
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:55,864
you have not yet crossed the Agnya Chakra.

145
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,240
Whatever object you see, you should become thoughtless,

146
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:05,447
especially in the heavenly abode of wealth and prosperity

147
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:10,447
there are numerous Gods and Goddesses

148
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:12,864
at least by seeing them, one should become thoughtless.

149
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:14,323
Once we attain the state of thoughtless awareness,

150
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:16,572
no perversion will remain in our attention any more.

151
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:19,156
The thoughts perverting the mind will not come anymore,

152
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:21,405
so how will perversion influence you.

153
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,281
That means like Christ said,

154
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:27,948
thou shall not have adulterous eyes.

155
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:31,489
They should be so pure, like the rays of the sun,

156
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:37,281
when they fall on trees, they do no absorb the dirt,

157
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:42,656
they nourish and nurture them, not only that

158
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:45,406
but they also give them strength.

159
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:48,656
In a similar way,

160
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,948
the Sahaja Yogis should have such radiance in their eyes, that

161
00:20:53,156 --> 00:21:01,531
they can create a very pure atmosphere in the whole world.

162
00:21:02,156 --> 00:21:06,323
Purity in the atmosphere is what we need today, everywhere,

163
00:21:07,323 --> 00:21:15,864
so that peace, joy and divine power can prevail in this world.

164
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:23,406
Only singing the praise of Shri Ganesha may not be sufficient,

165
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:25,614
Shri Ganesha needs to be awakened within us

166
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:28,489
and he should evolve to the state of Mahaganesha.

167
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:31,323
Only after attaining the state of Mahaganesha,

168
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:35,240
can our country benefit and also through our country,

169
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:37,406
other countries can benefit from this state.

170
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,739
We are going to lead the others,

171
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:45,156
but if we do not take up this responsibility,

172
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:49,323
then I cannot say, what will happen of this whole world.

173
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:52,614
I have a request to you all,

174
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:55,697
to remove all the adultery in your eyes.

175
00:21:55,906 --> 00:22:01,115
For this we have the mantra of Nirvichara in Sahaja Yoga.

176
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:03,115
Do not allow the thoughts to dominate you,

177
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,156
if thoughts come, then say

178
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:09,781
Yen Neti Neti Vachane  (it doesn't exist)

179
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,823
or say   Kshama Keli, Kshama Keli   (I forgive, I forgive),

180
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:14,739
so that this thought is destroyed

181
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,489
and once thoughtlessness is attained,

182
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:22,240
then the perversion of the mind stops.

183
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:24,906
Everybody should make an attempt,

184
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,656
that your eyes are not adulterous.

185
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:30,405
"If there is perversion in the mind because of my eyes,

186
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:34,739
then I do not want to have such eyes ", said Saint Tukaram,

187
00:22:34,989 --> 00:22:38,073
"then, it is better to be blind ".

188
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:43,572
In one way, it is better being blind,

189
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:45,614
than have perversion in the mind.

190
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,240
Rather have inner eyes to see Divinity.

191
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:50,572
When these two principles come together properly,

192
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:53,948
then one can say that

193
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:56,365
the Sahaja Yogi has attained the Guru Principle.

194
00:22:57,281 --> 00:23:02,781
I bless you all, that here at Ganapatipule,

195
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:07,281
the place of Mahaganesha, with his special grace,

196
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:10,864
you all can attain your Guru Principle as soon as possible.

197
00:37:54,823 --> 00:38:00,989
First they will take the twenty-four names of Shri Vishnu,

198
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:05,989
so that this Sushumna Nadi will open out.

199
00:38:06,323 --> 00:38:08,531
Then they will say the Shri Sukta,

200
00:38:08,823 --> 00:38:12,739
is the one to awaken the energy within you.

201
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:19,531
Then they will say the 108 name of Mother Gauri.

202
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:25,614
After that pujan, when this puja is over,

203
00:38:25,864 --> 00:38:29,073
then we will be doing a

204
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:40,572
Eleven kundas we have got,

205
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:47,323
and we'll be doing the havana on eleven kundas.

206
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:52,989
Because the Mahaganesha is the ruler,

207
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:57,948
is the ruler of Ekadesha Rudra.

208
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:00,656
So that has to be done with great devotion

209
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:02,240
and dedication.

210
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:06,281
I would suggest that first is finished this puja,

211
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:08,281
you can have your food,

212
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:12,739
and afterwards we'll sit down for the havan.
