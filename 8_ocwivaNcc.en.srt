1
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:17,880
We have within ourselves seven centers, placed
in our medulla oblongata and in the brain.

2
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:24,602
The first one lies below the triangular
bone, which is called as sacrum,

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,940
and it’s called as the Mooladhara center,
which means "the support of the roots".

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,367
It is the support of the roots.

5
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,440
And this center embodies our innocence.

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,605
The second one … and of course it manifests
outside in the gross, the pelvic plexus.

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,817
Now, the second one is the one
that emerges from the third one,

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,253
which is called as the
Nabhi Chakra, the third one;

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,486
and the one that emerges from that is the
second one, called as the Swadishthana.

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,840
Now, the Swadishthana Chakra in the gross
— because these are subtle centers, in the

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:25,620
medulla oblongata — but outside, in the gross,
it manifests what we call the aortic plexus.

12
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,770
If there are doctors here, they’ll
understand what I’m talking about.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,472
Now, if you go further, the Nabhi Chakra manifests
outside what we call as the solar plexus.

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,960
Above that is the center that we call
as the Heart center, Anahata Chakra,

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:54,000
cardiac center, which manifests
outside the cardiac plexus.

16
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,717
And it has got, again, the left and right side.

17
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,791
Then we have the center at the root of our neck,

18
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:13,839
which is called as the Vishuddhi Chakra and
which manifests outside the cervical plexus.

19
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:21,180
Above that, here where you see the red mark on My
head — this is just the window of that center —

20
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,812
between the pituitary and the pineal body, where
the optic chiasma cross each other in the center,

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:35,940
is a very important center called as Agnya
Chakra, which looks after our ego and our

22
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,000
superego, which you can see there passing
through that, crossing over like that.

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,288
And on the top of that is the last
seventh center, called as the Sahasrara,

24
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,398
meaning "one thousand petals center".

25
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,365
And that’s the center … is just

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:03,531
in the limbic area, and when you pierce
through that in the fontanelle area,

27
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:11,471
you feel the cool breeze of the Kundalini,
or the Holy Ghost, coming out of your head.

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,885
This has to happen.

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,100
You cannot give false certificates.

30
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,393
You have to feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

31
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,060
You have to feel the cool breeze in your
hands; that means you have to feel the

32
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:39,647
all-pervading Power of God, of Love, which is
called as Brahma Shakti in Sanskrit language

33
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,150
and in the Bible is called as the
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

34
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:54,000
For the first time you have to feel it in
your hands, in your central nervous system.

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:03,517
Because the seat of your Spirit is here,
but the Spirit resides in the heart.

36
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,440
Once the seat is touched by the awakened Kundalini
— which is in the triangular bone, if you see —

37
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,940
then you start feeling the first the cool breeze

38
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,180
and then in the hand, you start feeling
the cool breeze flowing from you.

39
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,799
Thus you manifest the power of your Spirit.

40
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,460
It’s a happening that has to take place.

41
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,178
It’s a living happening.
